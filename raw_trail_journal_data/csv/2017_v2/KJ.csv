Those thirty-six pounds felt a lot heavier than the 32 lbs I carried last time. It was a valuable reminder of how important it is to keep my pack weight down.Since November, I've been walking ten or so miles of the MST most Sundays with a bunch of THOG (Triangle Hiking & Outdoor Group) regulars led by Justin P. It was a little sad to say farewell-for-now to our little group. I enjoyed their company and encouragement as I developed my plan to spend a few weeks on the AT. 
An even bigger change for me will be the end of my stint at Ciena on 31 March. I've genuinely enjoyed the 5 1/2 years I've spent there. I'll miss many co-workers who have become friends, the challenges, and the feelings of accomplishment.

Planned to spend the night at Saunders Shelter, but I felt good so put in a few more miles. Stopped at a nice campsite by a pond. Saw only three other hikers once I got into the woods.

Wind increased all afternoon and was ferocious by nightfall. It roared all night. I shivered in my sleeping bag from 6:30 until I finally was able to fall asleep at 10:30. Twice during the night I had to shake the snow off my tent so it wouldn't collapse. 
Elk Garden is on a highway at the border of two counties. Each county sent their snowplow twice during the night. Between the scraping of the plows and the backup beepers as they turned around, it was pretty noisy. 
Two thru-hikers were in hammocks next to me. I'm sure their night was worse than mine.","Pond at trail mile 481

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559444,"I was shivering again by the time I broke camp. It was too windy to light the stove and too cold to stand around and wait for water to boil, so I shoved a frozen Cliff bar into my pants pocket until it was soft enough to chew. My pack straps, soaked by yesterdays's rain, had frozen solid so I couldn't adjust them. My shoelaces were frozen too, but a little pounding with my fist loosened them sufficiently so I could tie them tightly enough that the shoes wouldn't fall off.From Elk Garden, the trail climbs up a wide-open alpine meadow to a bald. As soon as I stepped out of the trees, the wind hit hard (60 mph gusts according to NWS). There were a few stands of trees, but most of the day's walk was on open bald at 5000-ish feet. Footing was treacherous: sheer ice, deep snow (up to a foot in places), and slush. On this my third day, I wished I had worn boots instead of trail runners. Grayson Highlands, famous for its wild ponies and beautiful views, was horrendous. The white trail blazes were sparse and faded, painted on snow-covered rocks, so navigation was extremely difficult--not a challenge I enjoyed while trying to keep moving fast enough to stave off hypothermia. The roar of the wind provided a psychological downer to match the physical cold it induced. My hat blew off, and I was only able to retrieve it because it got stuck on a bush. A water bottle was blown out of my pack; I didn't even know it was gone until I looked for it when the other one froze.
The famous wild ponies were hunkered down out of sight; all but one, who was wandering around Thomas Knob Shelter looking for handouts and trying to stay out of the worst of the wind. 
As the afternoon progressed, the wind subsided from a full gale to a stiff breeze. The trail also descended, which moderated the temperature a little. It was still well below freezing when I pitched my tent near Old Orchard Shelter, but I found a protected spot between a big boulder and a copse of hemlocks. Erecting my tent numbed my already-cold fingers (wet gloves). I had to wipe out the snow that had been in the tent since I packed it during the blizzard this morning. But some weekend hikers had a campfire going, and they welcomed me to warm my fingers and chat with them by the fire.  
All in all, it was a good ending to a miserable day.","Elk Garden

I was the only to spend the night at or near Trimpi Shelter; surprising for a shelter near a trailhead on a Saturday night. Just before dark, a local couple strolled through with their dogs. We had a pleasant chat. They told me they checked out the shelter frequently and did some minor maintenance. I noticed, but didn't mention, he was carrying  a big pack for someone who was just out walking the dogs.","Old Orchard Shelter

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559457,"Todays walk was superb! Beautiful blue sky, mild temperatures, nice views, and signs of early spring in the mountains. I came across three deer, saw some early wildflowers, and got my first taste of trail magic! Crossing a fence stile shortly after starting out, I noticed a piece of trash: a cardboard soda carton. But as I got closer, I realized it was carefully placed, open, and full of cans of Sprite. A perfect way to start a hike. I suspect it had been left last night by the dog-walking couple carrying the big pack. 
Toward the end of my day's walk, I came across Partnership Shelter. A thru-hiker was zeroing (no positive trail mileage for the day). He had just ordered two large pizzas, and he was offering slices to any hikers who walked by. Trail Magic twice on the same day!
My afternoon was less exciting. I hitchhiked into Marion, checked into a cheap motel, did laundry, took a long shower, resupplied, and feasted at a Mexican restaurant.","Trimpi Shelter

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559978,"First few hours were a rough Ridge walk, like walking on rip-rap. At Chatfield Shelter, the trail transomed into a delightful rhododendron tunnel alongside a creek for a couple miles. It ended at Lindamood School, an old one-room schoolhouse where there was a trail magic extravaganza: fresh fruit, cold sodas, knee braces, ibuprofen, and much more. Mrs. Lindamood was there replenishing supplies, so I had the good fortune to meet this trail angel in person. What a delight!
Following afternoon trail magic and early supper at The Barn, I had enough energy to push on for a few more miles before dusk. Ended at Davis Path, the site of a former shelter. Although the shelter has been demolished, the picnic table and privy are still there.","Marion

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559981,"Warm and humid; the heat got to me today. The footpath was relatively smooth, not terribly steep, but there were lots of PUDS (pointless ups and downs). 
Yoda and Rooster, recent retirees I met at The Barn yesterday, caught up with me as I was breaking camp. I walked and talked with Yoda, an IT guy, for a few miles.
I had first crossed paths with Utah Jack and Permagrin five days ago, on the first day of the snowstorm. (What a contrast in weather!) They're recent grads from Smith. We criss-crossed three times today. 
Lick Creek proved to be a delightful place to camp. I found a spot under a rhododendron canopy from which I could hear the gentle sounds of the creek all night. The water was cold! Despite the warm weather, I could only stand to wade in to my ankles and wipe down with my bandana. But Utah Jack and Permagrin stopped for a dip and submerged themselves. It was almost dark when they left, planning to hike into the night. I had the place to myself after that.","Davis Path

Moderate rain overnight meant packing and carrying a heavy, wet tent. But the rain ended before dawn, so I didn't need to pack and hike in the rain. Rooster and Yoda passed by and said hello as I was breaking camp. 
The day started with a moderate 2200' climb to Chestnut Knob. The overcast sky cleared just in time to provide beatiful views into Burke's Garden. (Check out the fascinating history and aerial photos at http://www.lostworldranch.com/....) The rest of the day's hike was around the ridge line encircling the valley. It was picturesque, but footing was very rocky and uneven, making it impossible to walk and look at the same time. I goofed on water today: I walked past the last source before the long ridge-line walk. Water sources and campsites were sparse, so I pushed on to Jenkins Shelter, thirsty and exhausted after 16 miles of mostly rough trail.","Lick Creek

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559988,"Nice, easy walk on a pleasant day. I'm tired, my feet are sore, my gear is breaking, so a relatively easy day was a welcome change. I repacked and bounced a resupply box at the post office (thanks Dustin!), bought a frozen pizza at Dollar General, then headed to Zero Days Hostel for laundry, shower, and a real bed.
There's a big thru-hiker culture on the trail. (Thru-hikers are those who walk the entire 2200 mile Appalachian Trail in a calendar year.) Although I can't come close to matching their speed, endurance, and toughness, I've found many of them welcome me into their fold. It's generous of them and gratifying for me. I haven't found very many others like me who are doing more than a few days but aren't attempting a thru-hike.","Jenkins Shelter

First thing I heard on the trail were Pablo's bear bells. From Madrid, Pablo carried a huge backpack, the aforementioned and annoying bear bells, and a big folding map. But no tent! Between his limited English and my limited Spanish, I gathered he had only a few hundred miles left to complete the AT. It just didn't seem possible given how he was equipped. 
Lots of weekenders, including a Boy Scout troop, were on the trail today. It took me a while to realize it was Good Friday, the start of a long weekend for many. There was also a disgusting amount of trash on the trail. I picked up some of the most offensive lightweight stuff, keeping in mind I would have to carry it 30 miles, not just a few hundred yards back to the car. 
Most of today's was along a ridgeline with lots of ups and downs, but the treadway was smooth so the miles came and went easily. I made camp early at a large, peaceful campsite near a stream. At dusk, a deer was startled by my presence; she made a wide semi-circle around my campsite, baying at me every minute or two, until she realized I wasn't moving.","Bland

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560457,"My first, and maybe last, 20-mile day!
The trailside trash situation improved dramatically as soon as I crossed SR 608, a quarter-mile into the hike. After a ridge walk (yes, there are lots of those on the AT), the trail descended to an impressive suspension bridge over Kimberling Creek. It's interesting how the mountain tops are still winter barren, bUT 2000' lower everything is in full spring leaf. 
After some rhododendron tunneling (a personal favorite), I took a lunch break at Dismal Falls. When I arrived, there were 3 other hikers there, Jeeves and two others whose names I didn't catch. A couple arrived by car on the other side of the river and began fishing. Then a day hiking family arrived. It was still very peaceful and relaxing until a dozen 20-ish year-olds arrived with beer and a party attitude. I left as soon as I figured they weren't going to offer me a beer. 
After more rhododendrons, some muddy spots, and lots of foot bridges, I arrived at Wapiti shelter around 4:30. It was still early, and the shelter looked worn, overused, with few tenting options. So I pressed on to Sugar Run Gap, which included a 1400' climb over Sugar Mountain. The descent at the other end was tough. By the time I reached Woods Hole Hostel at 8:00, I had carried my pack some 23 miles through the mountains (but only the 20.7 miles on the AT itself ""count"").I could barely stand up, and I don't think my feet had ever felt so sore.
A warm reception really lifted my spirits. I was directed to claim a spot in the bunkhouse next door, them invited back to the lodge. Although I had arrived mman hour after dinner, I was handed a bowl of delicious homemade soup, an overflowing plate of leftovers, and a cone of handmade ice cream. Seeker, Yoda, and Rooster were all there. Now or Never, Wonder Woman, Super Mario, and a couple others sat back down at the table to chat. I was too tired to eat much, but I managed to shower and fall into bed shortly after hiker midnight... where my sore feet kept me awake for a while longer.","Campsite 1 mile north of Jenny Knob Shelter

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560463,"Easter began with a wonderful breakfast at Woods Hole Hostel. We held hands around the table and each citing a personal gratitude. Then we dug into scrambled eggs, sausage, a granola concoction that reminded me of apple crisp, and delicious bread fresh from the oven. It was unquestionably the best meal I've eaten since I left home. In fact, since long before I left home. It satisfied my soul as well as my stomach.
The hostel owner drove three of us to the trailhead. I was feeling wonderful, figuring I'd have plenty of energy and time to resupply in Pearisburg after my shortest mileage day so far. I started up the trail first, but Seeker flew past me after about 100 yards. Now or Never started more slowly. I didn't see him again, but I think he passed me 2 or 3 hours later while I was off-trail collecting water. Shortly after that, I crossed Yoda and Rooster who were slackpacking (hiking without backpacks) southbound back to Woods Hole. 
That's about when my feet really began hurting again. My pace slowed to a hobble as the trail started the 3-mile descent to Pearisburg. By the time I arrived at the Holiday Lodge at 5:00, I was as spent and sore as I had been the day before. I immediately showered and took a nap. Fortunately, the Chinese buffet across the street was open on Easter. I ate a multi-course dinner, including several Cokes, generous helpings of their veggie dishes, a big piece of baked salmon, and 4 little tubs of ice cream.

I decided to take a zero day (no trail miles) to reprovision, bounce a box, arrange to get a new set of trekking poles, and rest my feet. And, to be honest, to wait out the all-day rain.
I walked a couple miles in town, to the post office, grocery store, camping store, Dollar General, and drug store. By mid-afternoon, the sole of my right foot was aching again; could it be Morton's neuroma? I know that condition has taken hikers off the trail for months, and I'm worried about it. 
My new trekking poles should arrive tomorrow, but I don't know what time. I'm hoping it'll be early enough for me to get out of town and hike to a nearby campsite before dark. I'd much rather be hiking in the rain than stuck in this dirty, smoky, run-down motel. 
Despite my current setback, I've learned a lot on the trail. Some serious and boring stuff about myself and my life, and some frivolous stuff about life on the trail. You'll find the latter more interesting, so here goes. You might be hiker trash if...

My replacement trekking poles arrived around noon, so after taking on fuel at DQ, it was back to the trail. It felt good to be moving again and to be back in the woods. It was a mostly pleasant walk with the exception of a short segment across a river on a highway bridge. As usual, there was a big climb out of town, but it was refreshing to get my legs working and my heart pumping. 
The forecast called for rain tonight and tomorrow, so I decided to sleep in the shelter rather than set up my tent. Then the crowd arrived: Stashe, The Machine, Bridget, Oz, Lumberjill, Winter, Van Grrizzle, and Dogmouse... all part of an established trail family. (Bridget was a section hiker from Wilmington, NC who had joined her friend Oz to complete the AT; today was her first day on the trail.)

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561592,"Have you ever walked a ridgeline in cold, rainy, and windy conditions? It's hard to describe how it can sap your energy and knaw away at your morale. That was today: several miles along the crest of Peters Mountain in cold, driving rain. No leaves on the sparse trees to break the wind. 
A bunch of the trail family I met outside Pearisburg were stopping at Pine Swamp Branch Shelter for the night. I didn't want to stop so early (before 4:00 PM), so I continued. I rode the zipline to The Captain's Place and had a soda. (He must have had 200 cans in his porch fridge, all for hikers to take.) The lawn looked a little swampy, so I re-crossed the river and continued to Bailey Gap Shelter. It was empty, and I had it to myself for the night. And the rain ended just before dusk :) 
TRAIL NAME: Nancy, in a moment of whimsy, I started the hike with my late brother's initials, KJ, as my trail name. (I needed a trail name to set up this journal.)

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562083,"My inflatable sleeping pad leaks. It's a slow leak, and I can't find it. This afternoon I found a stream (Johns Creek) with a long, deep basin in which I could submerge the pad and look for telltale bubbles. My shoes and socks were already soaked, so I just waded in without taking them off. As soon as I had the pad inflated and submerged, the skies opened and the rain poured down. It was the fifth thunderstorm of the day! I couldn't see any bubbles due to the raindrops, and knee-deep in a stream wasn't a good place to be during a thunderstorm. I deflated and rolled up my pad in the mud next to the stream. Now I have a wet and muddy pad that still leaks. It won't kill me, but it's discouraging.
The day ended with a steep, unrelenting 1700' climb, followed by a long, steep descent to the shelter. The entire Pearisburg trail family was there, including Darwin, Legs, Glim Glom, Wet Wipes, and a few others. The vibe around the campfire (thanks Stache!) was friendly and welcoming. Weed was burning when I arrived at 6, and was still burning when I went to bed at 9. I don't think it went out except to repack the pipe. 
PACK: Bruce, I'm carrying an Osprey Exos 58. It's by far the most popular pack on the trail. Most weekenders carry bigger packs, and the speed hikers carry smaller ones.","Bailey Gap Shelter

Neither Bridget nor I wanted to attempt that, so I reassured her that I'd stop at the next shelter, Niday, and she'd know at least somebody there. She told me she'd been calling her parents every day, and I can imagine her dad asking lots of questions: - Who are you hiking with? - There's nobody else with you? - How long have you known him? - You don't know his real name? - You'll be spending the night alone with him at a shelter in the woods?
I learned she had no tent, no map, no trail guide, and she had never been backpacking before. It may not have been an especially good idea for her to join a friend who was already 600 miles into a thru-hike.
Morning started with a pleasant walk through pasture. Afternoon brought another ridge walk in the rain. Good news was that some of the P-group had decided to stop at Niday Shelter instead of going on 10 more miles, so Bridget and I had familiar company for the night.
FOOD - Pat: food is all about calories. Protein is secondary, and nothing else matters. I've been consuming 3500 or more calories most days. Breakfast is usually a half-bag of granola with protein or 2 instant oatmeals; sometimes 4 Pop Tarts. Lunch is usually peanut butter and dried fruit in a tortilla. Supper may be a Knorr Pasta Side or a pack of instant mashed potatoes, usually with a pouch of tuna; sometimes a Mountain House for a treat. I also eat 3-4 energy bars and some other snacks (bag of yogurt-coated cranberries today) during the day. I try not to go more than 2 hours without eating.","Laurel Creek Shelter

I slept really well, and I was the second-last to leave in the morning. Only Bridget was behind me. Her motivation seems to be slipping away (not surprising since the friend she came to hike with is now a full day ahead).
It rained most of the morning, but the footing was good and I walked at a good clip until the trail became rocky and uneven a couple miles before Dragon's Tooth. The rain let up in time for a photo in front of the rock. I was astounded to learn later that Winter had climbed the wet tower to be photographed on top. The descent from Dragon's Tooth required scrambling (climbing with hands and feet) on wet rocks and even a couple of ladders (re-bar cemented into the rock). It was a nice break from plain old walking, but it would have been more fun and less treacherous had the rocks been dry. 
4 Pines Hostel is a 6-bay garage with some old sofas and army cots crammed in haphazardly. Crowded, stuffy, and smelly. But with a resident cat, at least we didn't need to worry about mice. (In shelters, mice will chew through backpacks, clothes, food bags, anything that has even a trace of food inside.) Since I arrived late, I slept on the floor. Along with most of the P-group, I rode the ""Dragon Wagon"" (very beat-up old minivan with a cool paint job) to an all-you-can-eat restaurant, The Homeplace. There are two high school proms tonight, so the place was packed and it took nearly an hour and half to be seated. At dinner, I met Beetle and Friendly Ghost, a married couple from Denmark who are thru-hiking.

It had rained though the night, and the forecast called for 3"" more rain today. There wasn't much enthusiasm for hiking. The place looked like an infirmary: army cots, limping hikers, Ace bandages, knee and ankle braces, needles and bandages for popping and covering blisters, bottles of ibuprofen and naproxen. The ""no pain, no Maine"" mantra struck me; everybody was suffering in some way... yet I didn't hear any whining. 
Today's hike took me to McAfee Knob and Tinker Cliffs, which normally offer spectacular views and photo opportunities. (McAfee Knob is the iconic photo spot of the entire trail.) But visibility was limited to about 200' in the rain. I was surprised to see a few day hikers on the trail nevertheless. A volunteer in the parking lot at the closest road crossing told me there's usually a lineup for photos at McAfee, but there wasn't a single person on the knob to take my picture. That was disappointing, but the solitude was pleasant. 
I didn't see anybody after McAfee Knob except a few hikers huddled in Campbell Shelter. It was still early when I got there, so I went on. Tinker Cliffs were very wet and slippery, and the trail ran over rocks precariously close to the edge. The gusty wind made it seem even more dangerous. I bushwacked 3 or 4 times to avoid the really scary spots. The rain intensified, the wind picked up, and the temperature dropped. Although I was pushing the pace to keep warm, I shivered the last few miles to Lamberts Meadow Shelter. I was very grateful there was space left in the shelter. I crawled into my sleeping bag for an hour to warm up before I could cook and eat supper.

Distance hikers who hike together only occasionally walk together. Usually, each hiker walks at their own pace during the day, sometimes stopping at the same place for a break. Today was an exception. Uncharacteristically, I was packed and ready to go early, and I left the shelter on Lumberjill's heels. She and I talked for the first hour, and then we fell into a comfortable silence. Stashe caught up with us after a while, and we walked as a group of 3 for the last few miles. When we reached town, I realized we had covered 9.4 miles in 2:45. Although the trail was mostly easy-going by AT standards, that's not a pace I'm accustomed to maintaining in the mountains!
I took a long, hot shower at the Ho Jo, followed by a nap. But not before encountering Seeker in the lobby. I hadn't seen him for a week, and I had figured he was 2 or 3 days ahead. Sadly, he was leaving the trail due to injury; he was waiting for a ride home. Then again, I wouldn't be at all surprised to see him again a week from now. Our paths keep crossing.
Had dinner with Stashe, Lumberjill, and Dogmouse at Three Li'l Pigs BBQ. I showed up a little late wearing my rain suit because my wet clothes were still tumbling in the slowest dryer in Virginia. My friends had saved a chair that, according to a plaque, had been sat upon by Pres. GHW Bush. Dunno whether they were saving it for me as an honor, or whether none of them could bring themselves to sit on it. Winter joined us later (after hiking 26 trail miles in the rain) and told us Bridget had left the trail. It was sad, but not surprising, to hear.

Caught up with Dogmouse, Stashe, Winter, and Lumberjill at an overflowing creek that needed to be forded. My feet were already soaked, so I just tromped through, but the others were trying to keep their socks at least a little dry. You can only get so wet. It had stopped raining by the time we reached the shelter, so Stashe and I pitched tents. I sleep better in a tent than in a shelter, but it's a pain to set up or take down in the rain.Sunshine in the forecast for tomorrow!TIMELINESS OF JOURNAL ENTRIES: Limited phone battery and lousy mobile coverage (ATT is known to stand for Appalachian Trail Terrible) limit me to posting updates when I'm in town.

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562518,"Woke up well-rested, thanks in part to the new pad I picked up in Daleville. Funny how having to get up 2 or 3 times each night to reinflate your pad can spoil a good night's sleep. The dry, sunny morning added to my good spirits. 
Had a pleasant chat over coffee with Shoelace, another long-distance section hiker. He's from Maine, and we fell into an easy conversation.
The treadway was smooth, with moderate ups and downs, so I made good time, perhaps 3 mph. Crossing the Blue Ridge Parkway  (BRP) for the first time was almost like a homecoming. It was also a relief to be able to jettison my trash at one of the overlooks (into a bear-resistant trash can, not over the edge of the overlook).
The P-group had planned to camp at a ""swimming hole"" listed in AWOL,  but they were nowhere to be found when I arrived. (Most hikers use David Miller's AT Guide, and they refer to it by his trail name, AWOL.) Glimglom, who was lingering there, told me the others had moved ahead to the next shelter. The campsite was next to a road and not very appealing, so I waited for Dogmouse and we decided to walk the extra four miles as well. Unlike what we'd covered earlier in the day, the last four miles were steep and rocky... tough going.
The shelter was one of the best I've seen. The five of us plus Joker, a thru hiker, spread out comfortably and spent the night.","Wilson Creek Shelter
",Bryant Ridge Shelter,"Apr 26, Wed",20.80
KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562528,"Awoke feeling tired and sore. Pains in my left shin and both feet had kept me awake much of the night. The P-group was planning another 20+ day, and I knew I couldn't get anywhere close to that. After Joker left, I told the others I would probably fall behind them today. Nobody said goodbye (considered bad luck on the trail), but I was sad to see them go. 
The hike started with a 2300' climb over 3 miles. It's a big climb but not unusually so; there's something comparable every 2 or 3 days. This one seemed interminable. Walking was bearable after that, but all I could manage was a plodding pace. My shin hurt, I had no energy, and I was far more bummed about losing touch with the group than I expected to be. 
I got to a campsite around 5:30, completely drained. It was windy, there was thunder in the distance, and it felt like rain would start any minute. I made camp quickly (nobody else around), ate supper, and turned in early. 
I did encounter some of the others during the day. Dogmouse was sitting about 2 miles up the hill from our starting point, dejected because he had left his sleeping pad behind. Adding 4 miles to a 22-mile day is no small matter. He eventually passed me late in the afternoon, almost running down the trail. I came across Winter and Stashe taking a break at a shelter; they were leaving as I rolled in. Later, I found them at an overlook, waiting for sunset; they planned to walk the last 10 miles after dark. (After dark is one time long-distance hikers usually do walk together in groups.)

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562533,"It rained most of the night, with some thunder. But sunshine hit my tent in the morning and stayed out all day. It put me in a better mood, as I once again set out to hike my own hike. 
After a leisurely breakfast of oatmeal and coffee with the songbirds, I taped my shin and started out slowly. It was a long downhill to cross the James River, and I worked hard--perhaps not hard enough--to protect my left shin from more damage. By now there was no doubt I had shin splints. It was interesting to see the seasons change from late winter atop Apple Orchard Mountain to early summer along the banks of the James River. 
Ran into Shoelace a couple times. He's heading into Glasgow with a friend tonight. I'm sure we'll cross paths again. 
I had planned to stay at Johns Hollow Shelter, but I wasn't crazy about staying with the crowd that was already in the shelter when I arrived. The campsite at this shelter was beside the privy, the worst-situated and least inviting I've seen. I ate my supper, prepared lunch for tomorrow, collected 4L of water, and headed up the mountain with a heavy load around 6:30. 
Camped alone  at a nice big camping area in a gap. Only problem was the wind, which blew quite noisily most of the night. At least it was cooler 1400' up the hill than it was at the shelter.

SOLITUDE VS. LONELINESS: I've gone as long as 22 consecutive hours on this hike without seeing another human being. I enjoy the company and companionship of others (as evidenced by how sad I was when I fell behind the P-group), but I have genuinely enjoyed the solitude of the forest. Every turn or rise in the trail brings new sights and sounds that Nature seems to have provided for my enjoyment alone. The solitude has provided me time for introspection without the pressure of having to make decisions. I haven't had to chase away trivial or silly musings because there's something ""more important"" to think about. I've felt more lonely eating by myself in busy restaurants or staying in motel rooms during stopovers in towns than I have at any point on the trail.","Harrison Ground Spring

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562546,"Awoke to very sore and tender left shin. It was sunny, hazy, and humid all day--by far the hottest day of the hike to date, with temps in the upper 80s.
As I was breaking camp at 8:00, Dogmouse walked by. Seeing him lifted my spirits, at least temporarily. He seemed to be in a good mood, but he told me Stashe, Lumberjill, and Winter had slackpacked big miles while he was resupplying in Glasgow yesterday. I know he must be feeling bad about falling behind the rest of the group. I learned later he did a 20+ day. 
I had no climbing legs whatsoever, and every downhill step felt as if a nail was being driven through my shin. It took an agonizing 5 hours to cover the first 7 miles. 
I did meet section hiker Clever Girl for the third time in three days. She was slackpacking SOBO, which not only lightened her load but also made her day's walk more downhill than uphill. Good for young legs, but not mine. 
The trail crossed the BRP after 7 miles, and something inside me changed. My energy level increased dramatically, my shin hurt much less, and my speed increased. I actually enjoyed this part of the walk. Part of it skirted Lynchburg Reservoir, a pretty mountain lake. 
I camped beside a stream in front of the shelter. In addition to four thru-hikers and a SOBO see ction hiker, there was a group of four nurses from Newton, Mass, who were out for five days. This clearly wasn't their first hike together. Other than yellow-blazer Wonder Woman, these were the first women over 30 (and they were all well over that) I'd seen on anything longer than a weekend outing.","Little Rocky Row

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562551,"A short, quick walk up the trail took me the highway into Buena Vista. I found a good spot to hitchhike, and the second vehicle to pass picked me up! The driver Mark was heading home from early-morning (unsuccessful) turkey hunting. His SUV was so new and spotlessly clean I hesitated before climbing in. 
Buena Vista is a run-down factory town. The Budget Inn is probably the dumpiest motel I've ever stayed at. But it has a coin laundry and the shower felt wonderful. Although I put in less than two trail miles today, I walked more than five on pavement to Food Lion, the pharmacy, and a Mexican restaurant. 
At supper, I was walking back to my table after washing my hands when I recognized Shoelace. He was with two other hikers, so I joined them. I was clearly the only hiker in the restaurant when I walked in, and it was a pleasant surprise to have some company for dinner. Shoelace's friend (and former thru-hiker) Happy Warrior had been out for a few days, but he had to head home that evening. He drove me back to my motel and gave me his nearly-full fuel cannister. 
I hope to hit the trail again tomorrow,  but my shin is still sore. And there's rain in the forecast. Still, I don't want to stay in this depressing town. I'm hoping to make it to Waynesboro by Thursday, which will be a more pleasant place to spend a zero day.","Brown Mountain Creek Shelter

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563039,"I walked to the post office to bounce a box to Waynesboro and to send home a few clothes. SunSeeker was walking out with her box as I walked in with mine. She's planning to stay one more night in Buena Vista. I went back to the motel, packed, and called the only taxi in town. He was busy, so I waited (and snacked) at Subway. Finally hit the trail at noon... just as the rain started. 
Trail was mostly a gradual uphill, my favored terrain, and I made good time. The rain and wind intensified, but it wasn't uncomfortably cold as long as I was moving. I finally put on my rain jacket, more for wind than rain protection, since I was already soaked through. 
Thunder and lightning started when I was on an exposed mile-long mountaintop meadow. Visibility dropped to 100' and the wind picked up. It wasn't as bad as my experience a few weeks ago in Grayson Highlands, but the lightning on the bald was scary. 
The rain abated to a drizzle for a while. I felt good even though my clothes and shoes were soaked. Then it started raining again, hard, when I was about a mile from the shelter. This time I started to feel cold. I wished I had started in rain pants, but by now I was so wet it was too late to put them on. When I arrived at the shelter, it was full and there were 8 tents already set up, the most I've seen around a single shelter. 
Shoelace had a spot in the shelter, and he invited me to eat ""with him"" out of the rain. That would be much better than eating hunched over in the tiny vestibule of my tent. It took extra effort to keep the inside of the tent dry as I pitched it in the heavy rain and strong, gusty wind. I was drenched and shivering steadily by the time I had everything set up for the night, but I managed to keep my sleeping bag dry. I went back to the shelter for supper out of the rain, but I didn't feel like taking the time to cook. I just gobbled some protein-enriched granola and chatted briefly with Shoelace and Squire. After thanking Shoelace for the ""dinner"" invitation, I hung my bear bag in a tree and crawled into a warm, dry sleeping bag for the night. It felt wonderful!

EXIT STRATEGY: When I started in Damascus, I had doubts about being able to ""make it"" for a month. Today is day 27. Despite a few setbacks and discomforts (as today), I want to stay on the trail. It's by no means easy or comfortable, but the simplicity of trail life has drawn me in. I feel as if I belong here. I need to get home by 19 May. I'm on pace to reach Harpers Ferry, WV by the 17th or 18th, and I think ATC headquarters would be a fitting place to end. There's also train service into DC, which makes it a convenient town to get home from. So I'm headed to Harpers Ferry!","Buena Vista

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563110,"Today dawned sunny, crisp, and windy. The rain and humidity had dissipated overnight. Temperatures stayed moderate and visibility was excellent all day. Fantastic day for hiking. 
Scrambled up Spy Rock and was greeted by stunning 360-degree views. If not for the wind, I could have spent an hour taking it all in. I had begun to despair for good views, but this was worth the wait. Only problem was when I came down a different way, and it took me fifteen minutes of searching to find my trekking poles. 
Ran into the Newton-Wellesley nurses one last time; they're leaving the trail and heading home today. They were in good spirits and seemed to have enjoyed their 5-day hike in spite of the weather. They had some time to kill before their shuttle pickuo, so I suggested they consider making the detour to Spy Rock. Dunno whether they did. 
Encountered trail maintainers for the second time, today. These volunteers are the unsung heroes of the trail. They carry and use heavy tools to clear, grade, drain, and fix the trail...only for the joy of doing the work. One of then, apparently a former thru-hiker, called me a lasker, a long-assed section hiker. I took it as a compliment.
The Priest is a mountain named after a rock formation that could be construed as a parishioner making a confession to a priest. A tradition at The Priest Shelter is for hikers to confess their sins of the trail in the shelter journal. I've found some of these amusing when I've read them in the past, but this tone was special: knowing many of the confessors made their entries more poignant... and hilarious!
The 3000' descent from The Priest really beat me up, especially my sore shin. I feel as if I need to take a zero (day with zero trail miles) soon.

Today's walk started with a 2000' climb up Three Ridges Mountain. Hanging Rock provided a beautiful view, which including The Priest, yesterday's summit. I ate lunch at Maupin Field Shelter with Captain, a young Chapel Hillian, and one of only two thru-hikers I met who used a SteriPen to treat water. His dad is vice-chair of the board of trustees at UNC. 
A couple miles after Maupin Fields, the trail crossed the BRP and slabbed a hillside a few hundred feet below the road, just far enough from the roadway to not hear any noise--clever trail design. The day ended with a slog up Humpback Mountain, this time carrying 4L of water for overnight and the first few miles tomorrow morning. At least there were some pretty views along the way.
On paper, it looked like a relatively easy day. But the trail was rocky, and there were a lot of short, surprisingly steep bits. The terrain and footing were hard on my shin splints. Moving at anything more than a snail's pace would cause me to place my left foot in a way that drove a jolt of pain into my shin. More than once I found myself putting miles before smiles, which made the day seem longer and tougher than it should have been. It's easy to realize you need an attitude adjustment; making that adjustment is harder. I even began to worry about having to finish the hike by headlamp after dark. Why not just stop early? Well, I had agreed to camp with Shoelace at the summit of Humpback Mountain as that location would position us to get into Waynesboro reasonably early tomorrow. I didn't want to let him down by not showing up.
It was after 7:00 PM when I finally reached the campsite at the summit. It was a welcome relief to see Shoelace sitting at the firepit. He had lost his sit pad, so I told him to use mine while I set up my tent, hung my bear bag, etc. We chatted for only a short while because we planned an early start in the morning.

There was filtered sun in the morning, but it felt as if the weather was about to change. The forecast called for rain later in the afternoon, which provided an incentive to move along. Trail conditions made it easy to walk at a good pace, and the spring forest scenery was as pleasant as it gets. The hours and miles flew by pleasantly, and I was a tiny bit disappointed to reach the trailhead (road to Waynesboro) at Rockfish Gap.
On the trail, I met Dark Horse, a woman about my age who was hiking solo from PA to GA. Also ran into Ozark and Doctari, who hikes in a kilt. 
Waynesboro and its citizens go out of their way to be hiker-friendly. At the trailhead, I found a list of a dozen Trail Angels who offered free rides to/from town. The first one I called, Yellow Truck, picked me up 10 minutes later and drove me to the motel. (His brand-new pickup is painted in 1970s-vintage yellow.) He drove a block or two out of the way to point out the laudromat, Ming's all-you-can-eat Chinese buffet, post office, and other places of interest to hikers. He also handed me a sheet of hiker resources in town. 
The New Ming Garden Chinese buffet was not to be missed. A spacious, pleasant place, it featured a big coi pond with a bridge (kids loved it), sushi, a Mongolian wok station, a salad bar, and the usual Chinese fare. I even found a big piece of grilled salmon. Shoelace and I ate with Squire and his two sons, ages 12 and 14, who are thru-hiking with him (sic). We've crossed paths a few times, but they're doing 20+ daily, so I probably won't see them again.

It's also surprisingly upscale and cultured for a mountain town. It boasts a live theater, an art gallery, and the ultimate eye candy, an antique Porsche dealership. 
UPS delivered a new pair of shoes today. The uppers on my first pair began disintegrating after only 300 miles. I mailed them home, and I'll return them to REI. 
I wished happy trails to Beetle, Friendly Ghost, Ozark, and Daktari,  who all headed out this morning. It rained on-and-off until mid-day, when the sky cleared and it looked delightful. Good for them!
After some rest and multiple icings, my shin splint pain has abated, but not completely; about what I expected. 
A large bunch of bicyclists is staying at the Quality Inn tonight. When I got back from supper, I ogled some of their expensive machines and struck up a conversation with the mechanic who was washing them in the parking lot. He offered me a beer while we chatted. The group had ridden 100 miles down Skyline Drive today, and they were heading back tomorrow. After a while, one of the riders brought him a big pizza. He only wanted a little, and by then it had been an hour since I had finished supper, so I helped him eat it. It was the most enjoyable evening I've ever spent in a Quality Inn parking lot.
Most of the AT is in National Forests, administered by the US Forest Service (Department of Agriculture). There are many official and unofficial spots along the trail to pitch a tent in USFS-administered territory. The next stretch of the AT is in Shenandoah National Park,  administered by the National Park Service (Department of the Interior). The Park Service prefers hikers to stay in a few designated spots. That makes hike planning more difficult because it forces hikers to choose between 10- and 20-mile days rather than intermediate daily distances. I'm planning to start back tomorrow with a nearo 8-miler to the first shelter. Shoelace will probably forge ahead 20 miles, so I expect to fall behind him tomorrow. 
City life has its charms and temptations, but I can't afford a Porsche so I'd better get back on the trail. The forecast is calling for a few showers tomorrow, snow flurries on Sunday. Guess I'll be sleeping in my down puffy. 

GEAR: I've added a few notes in the gear section. I'll add to this over the next couple weeks.

Karl, a trail angel, drove me from town to the trail. He's a physician, and we talked about diet, exercise, and his convoluted connection to Hillsborough, NC. I stayed in the car chatting for a while after we got to the trailhead, and I must admit it was only partly because I was enjoying the conversation: stepping out into the rain wasn't very appealing. But I finally said thank you and started walking. 
There are some informational signs on a roadside pull-out at the entrance to Shenandoah National Park. I stopped to read them and adjust my pack in the shelter they provided from the wind. A woman approached me: ""Are you hiking?"" she asked. Fortunately, I refrained from the obvious smart-ass reply: ""Why else would I be out in the rain wearing a backpack?"" She opened the trunk of her car and offered me a choice fresh fruit and juice. Yet another reason Waynesboro has been my favorite hiker town :)
A quarter-mile into the woods is the self-service registration station for backcountry camping permits. It's not something to be ignored. The permits are free for long-distance hikers, but the Park Service levies a $200 fine for overnighting in the woods without a permit. The registration station consists of a billboard and a metal box, but no shelter from the elements. The only pen was a gel roller-ball, which didn't work particularly well in the rain. I did the best I could to write legibly while my pack rolled down a muddy hillside. 
The rain let up about an hour later, and I found myself at the turnoff to the shelter by 3:45. I didn't want to stop so early in the day, especially after a late start, so I trudged on for a couple more hours. I met Chris, who had set up his hammock near the trail (another $200 offense) a couple miles later. He had just that week been discharged from the Marines, and he was celebrating by backpacking through SNP. Nice guy.
Around 5:30, I found a suitable ""stealth"" spot near the summit of an unnamed peak, where I pitched my tent well off the trail. (The Park Service has very strict regulations, backed up by that pesky $200 fine, about tenting too close to the trail.) After a leisurely supper, I headed to bed early. The wind died down a little overnight, but it was still cool. 

PHONE PROBLEM: The TouchWiz Home app on my phone is corrupted. It's Samsung's launcher, and is critical to operation of the phone. I've tried several techniques to fix it, all without success. It will require a factory reset of the phone, which I don't want to attempt on the trail. I've found a partial workaround, but it won't let me access photos.

I hit the trail at 8:00, and Chris caught up with me a half-hour later. He shared some fascinating stories from his days as a sergeant in the Marines. We walked and talked for nearly three hours, until he needed to take a break. His walking pace was faster than mine, so I thought he'd catch me later. I was disappointed that he didn't.
All day the weather alternated between windy-cloudy-cold and sunny-mild. I had to keep stopping to add or remove a layer. The trail, on the other hand, made my shin happy. The ups and downs were gradual, and there weren't too many rocks. 
I reached Blackrock as the sun broke through the clouds--perfect timing! It was a fun scramble to the top of a giant pile of, you guessed it, black rocks at the summit of a mountain. I spent a delightful hour there. It was fun to watch a mother follow her daughter, perhaps 3 years old, up the huge rock pile. The mom stayed close, but let her daughter explore and climb on her own, only helping at particularly difficult or exposed spots. When she reached the summit, the girl gave me a high-five. It warmed my heart.
Back on the trail, I crossed an ATC ridgerunner (http://www.blueridgeoutdoors.c...). She asked whether I was a thru-hiker. I took her question as a compliment, but I guess I'm starting to look and smell like hiker trash. 
Just before arriving at my destination for the night,  I came across a cooler of trail magic. I took an apple, and it tasted wonderful. Fresh fruit and veggies are the foods I miss most on the trail. 
It was cloudy, windy, and raw when I arrived at Loft Mountain Campground on a side trail. The campground, run by the National Park Service, is a huge facility that sprawls across an entire mountaintop. There was nobody about, just some big camper trailers buttoned up against the weather. The campground didn't look very appealing at all, but eventually I found a tenting-only area off a perimeter road. The first and only person I saw there was Doctari, whom I had met just before Waynesboro. He quickly invited me to share his campsite. He's an EMT, he hikes in a kilt, and he sleeps in a hammock at home as well as on the trail. I'll let you guess whether he's an interesting character. Friendly company and stimulating conversation made for a good ending to a good day. 

TRAIL NAMES -- Nancy: Trail names are part of the tradition and culture of long-distance hiking, particularly on the AT. In more than a month on the trail, I've met only one long-distance hiker who doesn't go by a trail name. Trail names can be easy to remember (Lioness has a mane of dirty blond dreads, Strider has incredibly long legs). They tend to be unique (I'm sure there are plenty of Justins on the trail, but there's probably only one Glim Glom). And some trail names help people escape their ""back home"" personalities (Joker was trying hard to act less dour). Choosing KJ, my late brother's initials, as my trail name is probably a form of catharsis or grieving, but you'll need to ask my shrink to be sure.","Unnamed peak (AT mile 872)

I started walking at 8:00, following the AT as it circled the huge campground, just out of view of the big camper trailers. A full mile later, I re-entered the campground on the far side to buy insect repellent and stove fuel at the camp store. The camp store catered to car campers, not backpackers: almost all their merchandise was in Walmart-size packages. I was pleasantly surprised to find small fuel canisters. 
Doctari had made his way to the store in a straighter line, through the campground. After some procrastination, I wished him happy trails, and I set out. He was moving more slowly, covering less daily distance, so we don't expect to see each other again.
Shortly before reaching Ivy Creek, I saw a bear. Finally, after 34 days and more than 400 miles on the trail! It was on a steep hillside, downslope and slightly ahead of me. It looked at me, and took a few steps further down the hill. When I kept walking slowly and talking loudly, it looked back at me and ambled off into the underbrush, apparently not scared but not ready to have a close encounter. 
A little later, I came across SunSeeker at Ivy Creek Overlook. We met about a week ago, at the Buena Vista post office. (She had wisely decided to stay put in town while I was getting caught in a lightning storm on a treeless summit.) Although we didn't walk together, we encountered each other a couple more times during the day, and we camped next to the same shelter that evening.
Late in the afternoon, I realized I had left my SteriPen water purification device on a rock next to the stream where I had collected drinking water. By the time I realized my error, I had covered 4 1/2 miles, and it was late in the day. To recover the SteriPen, I'd need to walk an extra 9 miles, and the backtrack would cost me a full day's trail progress (thanks to SNP's restrictive camping regulations). I decided not to go back. I carry chemical treatment tablets as an emergency backup. At the cool temperatures we've been experiencing, the tablets take 4 hours to kill Giardia parasites. I'll order a replacement SteriPen to be delivered to the next town, but until then I'll need to carry enough water to get me to the next water source, plus a 4-hour reserve. I'll need to manage my water supply carefully, and the extra water weight will make the hills feel longer and steeper. It was a costly mistake.","Loft Mountain Campground

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564935,"It was cold again overnight, 32°F. I didn't see any signs of freezing, but others did. The day dawned crisp and clear. It stayed that way all day, with outstanding visibility. 
Coffee and oatmeal warmed me. I've taken to combining Fruit Crisps with two packs of Quaker Instant Oatmeal in a freezer bag, adding boiling water, and putting it in my cozy to soak. It's my favorite trail breakfast. 
I stopped for lunch at South River Picnic Area, hoping to find potable water so I wouldn't need to use (and taste) the chemical tablets. There were several water spigots, but signs warned the water needed to be treated. Disappointing! Although it was sunny, the air was still cool and there was a breeze, so I didn't linger. 
The air had warmed a little by the time I reached Lewis Mountain Campground, which did have potable water. I filled my bottles and stopped by the camp store. The camp stores carry everything a car camper could ever want, but almost nothing for backpackers. Fortunately, car campers enjoy ice cream. As I was eating my ice cream sandwich on a bench outside the store, Towelie joined me. He's a smart, enthusiastic, and supportive 19-year-old thru-hiker. I think he walks 25 miles a day, but he advances only about 17 up the trail. The other 8 miles he walks are to visit waterfalls and other sites of interest off the trail. But he's no flake: he knows exactly what pace he needs to maintain to meet his deadline--he even maintains a bank of zero days in case he wants or needs to take time off the trail. I like him.
I passed a large, spread-out group of retired women, day hiking in the opposite direction. I stopped briefly to chat with a couple of them. I also encountered a trail maintainer who told me he had been volunteering in the park for 30 years; I thanked him profusely for making the trail more enjoyable. Hikers enthuse about trail angels who leave food and other goodies, but the trail maintainers are the unsung heroes of the AT. The entire 2200-mile trail is maintained by volunteers who remove deadfall, cut back branches, mow weeds, fix drainage problems, move rocks into place, and more. It's hard work, and the trail wouldn't be the treasure it is without the maintainers.
Late in the afternoon, I blue-blazed (detoured) to the summit of Bearfence Mountain for more views on this beautiful clear day. I completed most of a long rock scramble, but eventually turned around after nearly bumping my head on an overhanging rock. I hadn't seen any other hikers in a while, it was getting late, I was tired, and I still needed to find a place to camp. 
My topo map suggested there might be some flat area to set up camp on the far side of the next peak, Hazeltop. Sure enough, I spied a promising spot 30-40 yards back from the trail close to where I expected to find one. It turned out to be perfect: lightly used, flat, and mostly obscured from the trail. I arrived a little before 6:30, and was ""lights out"" by 8:00, well before dark. 

SETTING UP CAMP: Long-distance hiking is more about hiking than camping. The picnic table at a shelter is a social gathering spot, but there's obviously not much socializing when you're overnighting alone at a stealth campsite. My routine takes about an hour:
1. Find tent site, set up footprint, tent, and rain fly. 2. Inflate sleeping pad, unroll and fluff up sleeping pad.
3. Pick a spot to cook and eat, away from the tent.
4. Find a suitable tree branch for hanging a bear bag, away from sleeping and eating areas. Tie a rock to a length of paracord, and throw it over the branch. This usually involves a few (or more) failed attempts and some cursing. 
5. Dig a 6"" cat hole at least 200' from the campsite and mark it with a twig. I find it easier to do this in the evening than in the morning, when nature can call urgently. 
6. Cook and eat supper. Roll up tomorrow's lunch tortilla while supper is rehydrating in a freezer bag.
7. Clean up. Move everything scented (food, stove, trash, sunscreen, lip balm, toothbrush, etc.) from pack and pants pockets into food bag.
8. Tie food bag to paracord and hoist it out of bears' reach (4' below limb, 4' away from tree trunk, 10' off the ground). 
8a. Lower food bag to add the item I forgot earlier. There's always something!
9. Crawl into tent, change into dry socks (the best!) and long johns, snuggle into sleeping bag, write journal entry, fall asleep. 
The birds wake me every morning at dawn. My brain and my bladder argue about whether to get up or sleep a little longer. Then I reverse the process from the night before, and I start walking. (Putting on cold, wet socks is the worst!) For some reason, it takes me twice as long to get moving in the morning as it does to get to bed in the evening.","Hightop Hut

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565035,"Last night was very quiet, with no wind, no foot traffic, and no whip-poor-wills. But the full moon on a cloudless night kept the tent eerily bright. I awoke a couple times thinking it was dawn, then realizing the birds hadn't started singing. 
Once on the trail, the first five miles were easy going, mostly downhill on a smooth trail. I detoured into Big Meadows Lodge to seek breakfast and potable water. Three deer were grazing near the trail and didn't seem bothered by my presence. One seemed quite willing to strike different poses while I took photos at close range. Eventually it left the trail to allow me to pass. Big Meadows Lodge and Dining Room were about to open for the season... later in the day. But a friendly kitchen worker invited me into the kitchen to fill my water bottles. 
Eight miles up the trail was Skyland Dining Room, where I bought a ""real"" sit-down lunch with silverware and linen napkins... at a reasonable price. The hostess seated me near a power outlet so I could charge my phone while I ate. That's when I discovered a major problem with my phone: TouchWiz Home has stopped working. TouchWiz is the launcher that presents the home screen and launches apps. Without it, my phone has become little more than a text-and-talk flip phone. [That's why this journal entry is being posted so long after the fact.]
After a good meal and face washing in a real sink with running hot water, I felt much better. I was surprised to see Towlie as I was leaving; he had also eaten there but we hadn't noticed each other until we walked out. 
The last section of trail for the day was surprisingly rocky. But another ""tame"" deer encounter made the walk go by quickly. 
Towlie, SunSeeker, and I were the only ones at Byrds Nest #3 Hut. We all normally prefer to spend the nights in our respective tents, but the forecast was calling for heavy rain, so we decided to sleep in the shelter. After supper, I stepped away from the picnic table and the shelter to brush my teeth. When I looked up, I noticed a bear foraging in the brush about 50 feet away. It looked at me, and then it went back to foraging. The bear was obviously not alarmed, angry, or even curious about my presence, so I stood in place and finished brushing my teeth as I watched the bear. [SunSeeker later mentioned how surreal the situation was, both the bear and I behaving as if the encounter was the most routine thing in the world.] Eventually I walked slowly back to the shelter to get my camera, but by then Towlie had scared the bear away. I won't soon forget the experience. 
Stakes, who is section hiking the Shenandoah at similar speed to the three of us, arrived just before hiker midnight (dark), too late to see the bear. 

""STOPPING IN"": I've written several times that I've ""stopped in"" somewhere in SNP. That may give you the impression that campgrounds, stores, etc. line the trail just as fast food restaurants line a commercial section of highway. In fact, the Park Service has gone to great lengths to preserve the natural beauty of the trail. The commercial establishments, and even the shelters, are mostly invisible from the trail. ""Stopping in"" usually requires a detour of 0.1 to 0.5 mile on a blue-blazed side trail... each way. Those side trails aren't considered trail miles, so their distance aren't included in the mileage counts.","Hazeltop

KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565092,"Q: What do hikers do when it rains?
A: They hike.
An intense thunderstorm woke three of us at 5:00 AM, but Towelie managed to sleep through it. It's difficult to get motivated to transfer from a warm, dry sleeping bag into a cold rain, so we all moved slowly. I stepped into light mist at 8:00. It changed to a steady rain, then back to mist, then back to steady rain as the temperature dropped through the day. 
Rainy days make for fast walking. There's no point detouring to overlooks, cameras and phones are stashed in waterproof bags, and stopping doesn't get you dryer, just colder. I wore gloves and my thin rainsuit over shorts and a light fleece top. It was comfortable through the morning, but I got chilled by mid-afternoon. I regretted having discarded my worn-out glove liners in town during a warm spell.
I was looking forward to taking a break this afternoon at Elkwallow Wayside. (Waysides in SNP are short-order restaurants along Skyline Drive.) The trail passed close to this one, and I was looking forward to getting some warm food out of the rain. This wayside was attached to a camp/gift store, but there was no designated eating area inside. The food workers were pleasant, but the two store clerks were on high alert: any hiker who opened their food indoors was immediately scolded and ushered outside. A bunch of us huddled under the bathroom roof overhang to escape the rain while we ate. The overhang didn't offer much protection from the wind, though. Hoops and Sitting Bull called a shuttle to take them to a hostel; they were going to wait out the rain indoors. Stakes, who had been with us the past three nights, had hurt his foot, and sadly he was abandoning his hike. Towlie, SunSeeker, and a couple others were pressing on.
The rain and wind intensified after the break, and I was glad to see Gravel Springs Shelter at day's end. It's a double-decker shelter, and I snagged the last spot on the upper level. I changed into dry clothes and crawled into my sleeping bag to warm up before supper. 
SunSeeker and I have been walking at the same pace since we met in Buena Vista a week ago. She had hiked a little more than a quarter of the trail a few years ago, and she she's back to finish the job. We don't walk together, both preferring the solitude, but we've been happy to see each other at the end of the day. She plans to stop at a hostel tomorrow while I head into Front Royal. Don't know whether our paths will cross again.","Byrds Nest #3 Hut
",Gravel Springs Hut,"May 11, Thu",17.50
KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565094,"One of the shelter occupants turned on his headlamp at 4:00 AM and proceeded to swing the bright spot beam all over the shelter for several minutes while he searched for something in his personal belongings. He didn't use the red bulb, dim the lamp, or make any attempt to avoid pointing the beam at sleeping hikers. I think he managed to wake every one of us. There are boors on the trail, too. 
The day dawned cloudy, cold and raw, but the forecast all-day rain held off. The trail was well-graded, and I made good time, covering 13 miles in 5 hours, including a short lunch break at a shelter. And there was trail magic at the trailhead! 
The trailhead is 4 miles up the road from Front Royal, and there are no pullouts for picking up hitchhikers. Another hiker gave me the phone number of a reasonably priced taxi, and my phone had service! It started to rain as I was waiting to be picked up. It was pouring an hour later, but by then I was in the laundry room at the Quality Inn. Funny moment: the taxi driver asked whether I needed help carrying my bag into the hotel, the bag I've carried 500 miles up and down mountains. Yep, today I crossed the 500-mile threshold. 
I spent most of the afternoon trying unsuccessfully to resuscitate my phone with help from the guest PC in the hotel lobby. Shoelace texted me; he's still in town after taking a zero. We headed to the beer and BBQ place across the street for supper. As we were finishing, a bunch of hikers from the hostel down the road, including SunSeeker, came in. We had a fun evening.","Gravel Springs Hut

My pack will be heavy all the way to Harpers Ferry. Back at the hotel, I checked schedules and connections, and I made arrangements to travel home on the 18th. 
It was 1:20 when I finally hit the trail. The rain had stopped, but the trail was a series of rivulets and mud puddles. I wasted time trying to keep my feet at least partially dry. I arrived at the shelter around 6:30, set up camp about 100 yards away, and had supper at the picnic table with Shoelace and three docs from South Carolina who were out for 5 days. As I was eating, two mice scampered around my feet. They were fun to watch, but I'm glad I'm not sleeping in the shelter tonight.","Front Royal

The trail was still very muddy and flooded in places, but there were lots of day hikers and weekenders out for Mother's Day. 
I passed a side trail to Rod Hollow Shelter at 4:30, but it was too early to stop. Almost immediately, I was onto the Roller Coaster. The Roller Coaster is 13-mile stretch of trail containing 12 significant climbs totaling 5000' elevation gain, and it's surprisingly rocky after the relatively soft and smooth footpath through the Shenandoah. It was tougher than I expected it to be. 
I found a very large, but not very level, campsite at Morgan Mill Stream. It shows signs of heavy use, but I'm the only one here tonight. This part of the trail is close to Washington Dulles airport, and there's nearly constant noise from jets landing there. I pitched my tent near the stream, which, swollen from recent rain, drowns out most of the jet noise. It feels a bit weird spending the night alone in the woods so close to a major international airport.","Manassas Gap Shelter
",Morgan Mill Stream,"May 14, Sun",16.20
KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565104,"Enjoyed a leisurely breakfast and pack-out. There was no noise from landing aircraft, so the wind direction must have changed overnight. 
The Roller Coaster ups and downs continued unabated. Although I was in no hurry, the slow going was frustrating. My left knee and shin contributed to the challenge. I've found that putting my foot down quickly at an odd angle can result in shooting pain. So I'm taking very slow, tentative steps on uneven, rocky terrain. It took me 6 hours to cover the first 7 miles today. 
I stopped briefly at Bears Den Hostel, built of stone in the 1930s. I grabbed a cold soda and charged my phone for a few minutes. It's a nice place, and there were a few pleasant hikers hanging around. A couple months ago, I would have have stopped for the night, glad for an opportunity to rest my sore body. But it was only 2:30 on a gorgeous afternoon, and the trail beckoned. 
My next plan was to stay at a campsite with a spring at the exit of the Roller Coaster, as described in AWOL's guide. When I got there, there was neither a campsite nor a spring, and I was down to less than a liter of water. So it was on for another 4 miles to the Blackburn AT Center. Blackburn is primarily a day-use facility for Potomac Appalachian Trail Club functions. But it also has a small bunkhouse and a few nice tent pads. There was room in the bunkhouse, but the weather was perfect for sleeping outdoors, so I pitched my tent for the last time.","Morgan Mill Stream
",Blackburn AT Center,"May 15, Mon",14.60
KJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565105,"I woke several times during the night, thinking about the end of my hike. I rose late to a beautiful day and had a good chat with the caretaker Cheryl before setting out. A LASHer herself, she had moved in just yesterday for the summer. 
I had hoped to camp one last night just beyond Harpers Ferry, but I couldn't find any good options in AWOL. So I took advantage of cell service at Buzzard Rocks to reserve two nights at the Econolodge in Harpers Ferry. Then I strolled along slowly, savoring the last few miles. Perhaps too slowly. Around noon I realized I'd need to pick up the pace to reach the ATC office before they closed at 5:00. 
There were only a few day hikers on the trail, and they seemed less friendly now that we were closer to big cities. An exception was a woman about my age backpacking southbound with two adult children. She was out for a 4-5 day shakedown before starting a SOBO thru-hike from Maine next month. She seemed a little short on confidence, so I encouraged her as much as I could. A little, just a little, self-doubt may actually increase your chances of success on a task as difficult as a thru-hike.
As I neared Harpers Ferry, the reality of finishing started to sink in. At trail mile 1023.1, a blue-blazed side trail leaves the AT and leads uphill to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy Visitors Center, my destination. Turning onto that trail brought on more emotion than I expected. I was glad I had reached Harpers Ferry and I was pleased that I had ""survived"" 42 days on the trail, but I was also sad. I'll miss the peacefulness of the woods, the time for deep contemplation, the simple lifestyle, the physical and psychological challenges, and most of all, the trail community. Alone at this point, I shed a few tears.
At the ATC office, I got a warm welcome from the  staff, had my photo taken in front of the building, and was escorted to the hikers' lounge at the back. The ATC office was a strange experience. In addition to hikers, it attracts a lot of people who are just curious or who may have walked a couple miles on the trail. Mostly they marvel at why anybody would want to walk the entire trail. They peer into the hikers lounge as if it were a zoo, with its scruffy, smelly inhabitants having relaxed conversations among themselves. One asked, ""What do they do when it rains?"" I'll miss being in that back room with what are, but will no longer be, my peeps.
Among other hikers, Squire was there with his sons Remix and Stretch, ages 12 and 14. They'd been doing big miles, and I thought they were several days ahead of me. Turns out they were. They've shuttled back to Harpers Ferry to attempt the 4-state challenge: 4 states in one day. They were preparing to hike 43 miles of mountain trail in 24 hours, starting at midnight. Remarkable that they'd even consider it!
Reluctantly, I left the ATC office and checked into my motel. I went to dinner alone at a small pizza place. I was feeling melancholy until seven other hikers, including Hoops and Sitting Bull, walked in. Joining them and sharing a few beers cheered me up. For one last hour, I was still part of the trail community. 

MORE TO COME: I'll be back in the next few days with some final thoughts, lessons learned, and a link to photos. I'll also add a few more comments on clothing and gear.","Blackburn AT Center

I retraced my steps to the ATC office, then continued another mile on the AT. It took me through Lower Town Harpers Ferry and across a railway bridge into Maryland. From there, I blue blazed. I took a trail to an overlook on Maryland Heights, which provided a spectacular view of the town and the confluence of the Shenandoah and Potomac Rivers. The trail and the overlook were packed with day hikers, some without even a water bottle on a 90-degree day. After six weeks on the trail and now carrying a nearly-empty pack, I effortlessly flew past every other hiker on the steep but short hills. That's not a feeble boast by an aging man; it's what humping a backpack up mountains every day will do to anybody's leg muscles and stamina. While it was fun to be ""king of the hill"" for a day, it's really sinking in that I'm not a long-distance hiker any more. The 8-mile loop I walked didn't feel like real hiking.
I went back to the ATC office in the afternoon to sign the log book. There were no familiar faces there, nor among the hikers I encountered in town. Most of my hiking buddies are already somewhere up the trail. Although the new faces were open and friendly, they clearly didn't want to invest too much time or emotion getting to know someone who is off the trail. Although my mood was mostly melancholy, the day helped me transition back into my other life. It reinforced that hiking is over, at least for now, and it's time to start the next phase of my life.
My mood picked up in the evening. SunSeeker arrived in town mid-day, and we had dinner together. Walking back to the hotel, she tried to convince me to stay on the trail. I think she was only half-joking, which made me feel good.","Harpers Ferry

Weather was mostly cloudy but dry in the morning. It rained lightly for ~2 hours in the afternoon.
Walked with Anthony and Jayne for a while, then I pushed ahead alone for a few hours to meet Sharon. She was meeting us to start her hike at Dicks Creek Gap. It was nice to get a few hours of solitude on this group trip. I ate lunch while Sharon started up the trail. She and her husband had moved from Georgia to Florida a few months ago, and she had lost her mountain trail legs. It doesn't take long!
I'm feeling really good after two 15+ mile days, but John and Amelia look very tired. Plumorchard Gap Shelter is a triple-decker. Good thing, because there were three groups staying there. Most seemed to be beginners, all walking well under 10 miles/day. Funny how all members of our group wanted to sleep in our tents/hammocks every night instead of in the shelters. 
SOBO thru-hiker Dirt arrived while we were eating supper. She's from Damascus, finished her bachelor's degree. She's moving to Chapel Hill (near Maple View Farm) after her hike. She was young and attractive, and a couple of the other geezers in the shelter were obviously envious that I engaged here in a friendly conversation almost immediately. I've noticed I can connect easily with most thru-hikers, regardless of their age or gender. Wish I had that ability with ""normal"" people when I'm not on the trail.
