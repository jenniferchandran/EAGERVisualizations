Jolly Rancher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567846,"Day 3. Spent a great night at low gap shelter. (Hard to keep up with the gaps ). Andrew enjoyed a Great nights sleep in his hammock and I was free to snore away in the tent. I don't think the guy camped below me will be sending a Christmas card this year. We hit the trail at 8 and the first 5 miles were forgiving with only a few altitude changes. The last two miles were nasty with a thunder storm and hail. We made blue mountain shelter in our usual ...one mile per hour. Andrew is pictured in the shelter. Several hikers are racked out on the platform. We are happy to be out of the rain in dry clothes. We should have a break in the weather to set up camp dry but no hammock tonight as the rain chances stay at 40%. The trail is it's usual nasty self as we endure hours of pain followed by the best camping on earth! We are going to hike down to Unicoy gap tomorrow and figure out the next move.

Jolly Rancher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563325,"Started the day hiking from Hawk Mountain. Up and over Sassafras, justice, and Gooch Mountain made for a 9 hour 9 mile trek. We treated ourselves to $15 hostile in Suches GA. Folks in the bunk house won't like me tonight, I really stink and will moan and groan with pain... All in all, a good day. We are backing it down a notch tomorrow. Kids we met were way out their element. They were packing 10 lbs. of potatoes, 10 lbs. of apples, can goods, etc. I helped one with some incredibly sore blisters. He was pissed as we arrived on a Sunday and the hostel/Gas Station didn't sell beer on Sundays. As he didn't have a trail name yet, I named him ""Blue Law"". When the store opened at 7:00 AM on Monday morning, the team immediately grabbed a six of tall boys each. They drank three while in the bunk house bandaging and preparing for the days hike. I cracked up when they said they only wanted to carry three each because otherwise they would be packed too heavy! Oh well, you meet all kinds out here and weight is something I also struggle with. So glad I'm not tempted to carry beer! I can really see how one can get closer with God while journeying on the Appalachian Trail. BTW, Alex thinks these kids are so cool and we are going to hike with them, at least this morning. Blue law is pictured in the photo. 
 Enjoyed chatting with ""Late start"", ""Gusto""
and “still unnamed who I call Blue Law most of the morning. Late start is
through hiking at age 53, Gusto and no name are 19 year olds heading for New
York by school start on Aug 26th. These dudes are packing 30 lbs. of food and
no clue but don't care as they are on and adventure without worries. They are
currently on their 3 beer as we wait for a shuttle back to the gap. Love their spirit!

We
found a queen sized mattress in another room and moved out of the bunk house
and flopped in the front area under the air conditioning. Excellent sleeping
and I'm feeling rested. Lots of FB posts this mining until I turn my phone off

a beautiful day heading to the base of Blood Mountain, highest elevation in GA.
Plan is to camp at Lance creek and summit Blood tomorrow so we can camp at the
top after a strenuous hike. God has blessed me on this day. Alex is enjoying
the free spirits of Gusto and Blue Law has
they hike ahead of me along with Late Start. I saw my first rattle snake
today. He wasn't bothering anyone, just enjoying the sunshine of the trial.
When he heard my footsteps, he simply crawled off the trail into some brush. He
never rattled or coiled, just went about his business. I did drop my pack
and walked back to the watering hole where a father, his wife, and two
daughters were refilling. I discretely walked the father up to the point where
the snake moved not knowing how far off the trail he rested. I didn't want to
alarm the girls.

from AL and PB&J from TN. We talked into the night along with Alex. At
dusk a scout troop rolled into the small camp after a long Trek southbound. I
felt right at home as the scouts recovered cooked and acted silly until their
aching little bodies collapsed. Rodney, a retired school teacher, and I rose
early and discussed God and how little control we as men possess. The AT gives
one countless hours to reflect on who is driving the bus. We just completed a
strenuous 1500' climb to the top of Blood Mountain where we plan to camp for
the night. Blood Mountain is so cool. As we are down to our last bite of food,
we offered to store another group’s food, casually mentioning that our canister
was empty and we had plenty of room. hint hint hint... It didn't work until
early the next morning when they tossed us each a Cliff bar. My spam sandwich

Jolly Rancher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563328,"Shout out to our friend Jen Coad who loves everything about section hiking except the camping and stinking part. Jen, we found a nice cabin near the trail with showers and 13"" satellite TV. That left money on the table @ $60 per night. A short distance from our cabin is Turner Corner cafe. It's amazing how good a greasy old cheeseburger tastes after many days of freeze dried food, nuts, and granola bars. The trail was fairly empty today as most hiked beyond Neels Gap and the rest went home after the holiday. I treated myself to a new shirt at Mountain Crossing which is a historic outfitter and hostile located on the trail. Reviews of the hostile said ""dungeon like"" so we went the short path to Blood Mountain Cabins. Looking forward to a real bed tonight. 

Turners Corner Cafe Est. 1928.

As we prepare our packs to shuttle north near Hiawassee I'm struck with the addictive nature of back packing. I have been dragging around a 6lb 55 cu"" pack for 10 years. Yesterday I was looking at the modern 3lb packs at Mountain crossing and told myself after laboring down the mountain, ""why spend the money when you don't know if you’re ever doing this again?"" Last night as I slept in a bed for the first time I routed in next section hike and easily drifted to sleep without the interruption of shifting from side to side. The trail is much the same. One hikes until you can't walk another step. Then you rest, recover, hydrate, and let God do the rest.","Blood Mountain Shelter

Jolly Rancher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567845,"Day 2 morning. Yes, that's the Appalachian trail in front of the tent. Whitey Gap shelter was. 1.2 mile side hike and we were spent at 830 Last night. Andrew Johnson went for water and I didn't even come close to 50 yards off the trail. Slept Ok, except for peeing 3 times. We mostly ran into day hikers yesterday. Everyone is so friendly. A nice family is camped below us. Lots of bear and rattle snake reports but we only saw the occasional lizard. Trying for an early start beat the heat. Water is plentiful and our 5 days of food is in fine shape much to Andrews dismay as his pack remains heavy. Unless the terrain gives us a break, 6 miles will be full day making the car at the end of 40 miles seem a long way. Unlike Alex Johnson, Andrew hikes my speed so we were together all day. He is a tough kid and I'm loving the quality time together.
Not much service. Camping at low gap shelter tonight. 5 hard miles again today. Andrew is digging his new hammock. Trying to rest up for a hard climb to blue mountain shelter tomorrow. Lots of campers with us tonight.

Jolly Rancher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567847,"Day 4. We spent a great night on Blue Mountain. Andrew in the pictured shelter and me in the snoring lodge. We met some great people. Travis and Tray from Atlanta, a young couple who are engineers from Rockford Illinois, and Andrew , Jakob, and Tim from University of GA who hiked in after 20 brutal miles from the north. Everyone up and moving their different directions. We are thinking about a hostile tonight after a 3 mile hike down to Unicoy gap. We stink! 
We found a great hostle. Top of Georgia is the name. Free foot soak included in $21 per night stay. Very clean and scenic. In a bunk tonight. We had a good day. The terrain took it easy on us as we snaked our way off of Blue Mountain. We chatted with Travis and Todd and everyone was feeling full of themselves until the mountain took a last minute 200' elevation gain. The steep climb down was wet from yesterday's rain and I was left bringing up the rear. No way I'm hurting myself and I like to admire the beauty of the rocks and forest. We made our way to this Hostel (not a hostile as my friend Jennifer Coad pointed out) It opened in March of this year and isn't in the literature yet. We met two through hikers from Boston and Maine. They made the 69 miles from Springer but one had injured his knee. I listened to one way conversation as they made arrangements to fly back to Boston, seek medical for the knee, then start a southbound trek from Maine. I giggled as they asked "" how long is the bar open?"", as they made hotel arrangements in Atlanta. They gave us hospital gowns and did our laundry for $2.50. In the evening Josheia the free spirited hand shuttled us along with Aaron into Hiawasse where we ate at Daniels, an all you can eat southern Buffet. It was heaven! We sat in rocking chairs and admired Gods beauty, well I admired Gods beauty while Andrew Johnson watched Net Flix on his phone, until bed time. We ran into Mark Lester and his wife here yesterday. Mark is a registered leader in Troop 16 and still active in the district. Mark mentioned he is going to Philmont with Dave Remleys troop and they are here dropping their Eagle Scout son for a through hike. He hasn't made it here from Springer yet so they were on recon mission. I'm enjoying coffee on the front porch.
 We shuttled off the Appalachian trail to the Dillard House near Clayton Georgia. A retired couple was raving about the home style food and then unsolicited my friends Bob and Joy Heustess Garrett recommended. The breakfast was outstanding! We filled our humps then headed north to Ashville NC where we visited the Biltmore mansion. Andrew and I are enjoying a wonderful outdoor (and now indoor) experience. The characters we met on the trail will stick with us for a lifetime. Last night we ordered pizza and enjoyed the comforts of the Holiday Inn Express as we almost made it through ""The World Wars"" on History channel. We will make our way into North TN today then on to Virginia and Kentucky as we count down the hours until we meet the in laws at this weekends Scottish festival in Glasco Kentucky. Jenny was able to get us a last minute room at the Barron River State Park lodge where we will register tomorrow. Andrew Johnson has been participating with Mary and Bob in the Clan Shaw Society since he was a little boy. He looks forward to the weekend annually and he dresses in full kilt and armor. We will probably stay around Somerset tonight then make the short drive to Barron River on Friday morning.

Jolly Rancher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567851,"The shuttle is almost ready to move me to Unicoi Gap. I'm reminded of my training up to this point. "" stretch often to avoid injury and don't do any exercise that will remind you of how far out of shape you are. Wait until you can't turn back"". Now I'm thinking that was a bad plan! currently at Indian grave gap. Working my way to Tray Mountain shelter. Heart and lungs are holding out. So far so good. I probably won't be as optimistic after the 3 mile climb up to 4400 at Tray Mountain. Stoping for water at the old cheese factory site. Other than leaving 1 crock shoe in the shuttle ( fell off my pack) I'm doing great! Many hikers on the trail. Fun visiting with them. 
Day 1 (cont) I made Tray mountain shelter. Good day on the trail. I hiked in with a couple of guys from NC who started on the approach trail. I have been playing leap frog with a scout troop who appear to be camping here also. Great view from the top of Tray Mountain with the Hemlocks blooming. I set up hammock and tent. Hammock for longing and reading and tent for sleeping. (Something about 4 walls and sleep) I'm not sure where I'll end up tomorrow but will study the route tonight and post my next destination. Weather is fantastic and I feel pretty good despite 8 tough miles.

Jolly Rancher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569630,"Day 2 : wind howled all night with cool temps. Very peaceful sleep despite rocky surface. Sat in the shelter with some hard core hikers who's goal is to make the trek on $0 dollars. Picking up food is easy they said since so many GA hikers are packed too heavy and much food is left behind in the shelters. They found a full bottle of unopened whiskey that they sold at Mountain Crossing to pay the Smokey Mountain permit fee of $20. They are also picking up trash everywhere they find. ( too many don't understand leave no trace) breakfast with a young college student who is suffering sore knees and out of toilet paper. I gave him a few squares. Hiking to Adidas gap or shelter 2 miles past today. I'm moving slow as fog has set in on top of the mountain. Happy Trails! 
Day 2 (cont); trail was less rugged however I was less rugged so it evened out to kick my ass. I'm making camp at Adidas Gap. Water is .5 miles but I found a good site just off the trail. At least the 1 mile round trip will be without my pack. I hiked with a guy from Chicago and a older gentleman and his grown son. Weather was great Again today. Calling for rain Tuesday and Wednesday. If you ever wondered what the AT looks like see the 2nd pic. Well worn trail, many trees, and white blazes to show the way. Up and over Kelly's Knob tomorrow ( the reason I quit early today ) I'm sure Kelly's Knob will be kicked after that nasty little 3 miles. 
In my happy place. Just finished a freeze dried chicken and rice meal along with the freeze dried chicken salad from breakfast. A couple of hikers spotted a Moma bear and her cubs up the trail. I long to see a bear out here, just not when I'm sleeping! Hung my food and cooked according to the Philmont triangle. Tomorrow is going to be miserably difficult.

Day 3 (cont) made the top of Kelly's knob lick then down to deep gap shelter. Everyone is hiking fast today (except me) as the storm is coming! My car is at dicks creek gap so I can either re supply or call it quits. Will double check the forecast which doesn't look good.
Day 3 (cont) a man and his son recommended I day hike a blue blaze to see the view from Powell Mountain. Well worth the extra 15 minutes! 2 miles to Dicks Creek and a steak lunch!
I ran into a little delay. This guy is blocking the trail. Rattle is clearly visible. Taking a break to warn other hikers. I don't have enough energy to run if he gets pissed so I'm giving him room and time to make the first move.
Day 3 final: well the free spirited college kids move the rattle snake and I was behind them every step of the way. I made it to Dicks Creek and moved my operation to Murphy NC. Eating a not freeze dried steak and roughing it at the Holiday Inn. Bad weather is keeping my off the trail so this is it.

I'm planning to spend a night at Top of GA hostile. I end up there every year and really enjoy the hospitality, proximity to the trail, and characters I meet. I have plenty of time to complete the 40 to 100 miles and depending On date, state on mind, weather, and health (muscles, blisters, etc...) may do a little more or less. I have been section hiking for 3 of the last four years and finished last at Dicks Creek Gap. I love the serenity that comes after a day on the trail when we visit and swap stories in the camps. I'm a very married 54 year old man and am very prayerfully taking this Trek by myself (years 1 and 2 with my Eagle Scout sons Alex and Andrew; year three alone; and year 4 was supposed to be with my bride Jenny but had to cancel at last minute) As you can see, 70 miles over 3 short trips isn't much however every single mile is very special to me and my relationship with God and family. I don't use drugs or alcohol but know that I smell the pungent aroma from our camps and shelters and respect your space. I'm happy to have found a better way of living and share my story (sparingly) based on attraction rather than promotions.

Today’s shake down was in full pack getting ready for AT. Along with me is my son Andrew and of course Sherman, the German Sheppard. The loop is 8 miles in to a wonderful (#2) camp site that we visited in 2011 with my son Alex and our Philmont crew. Easy access to water everywhere as both the north and south whispering pine loops meander around Crystal clear Pickle Creek. Due to a 1:30 start we took the white connector trail shaving off 3 miles. The 5 (I added the 3 miles from Train #1 that isn't in journal) miles really was a beautiful walk in the pine forest. Sandy trails and only a few 600' climbs were very easy on the feet. My ultra-cool Apple Watch showed 1642 calories so we did get some exercise. Sherman spent the day with Andrew who hikes quickly and can do 5 mikes standing on his head. Watching him now I can read his mind, “Ok this was fun but how do I get back to the truck and the furniture at home?"" Currently Andrew is leisurely napping and reading in his hammock. Dinner will be freeze dried chicken Alfredo and I can't wait! Andrew packed my heavy 2 man ALPS tent that Sherman and I will share. We jumped some deer and experience will prove these Pine Hills are loaded with screech owls and coyotes. Sherman already stinks so tonight's camping will be interesting! 4 miles out in the morning. 
Trail was rather quiet and peaceful. Ran into a conservation officer named Al at the trail head who reminded us Sherman needed to be on a leash.

After hauling water last night, I realized the insertion tube to my gravity filter was missing. For those not familiar with trail lingo, a gravity filter is a sack of water from any source on the trail that is filtered and purified for the best drinking water in the world! It's how we get clean water in the back country. I borrowed Tom's water filter pump so Andrew and I had fresh drinking water for breakfast and the 4 mile trek out. Tom was actually a very nice guy. We spoke for about an hour. He is retired from Washington University, originally from San Diego, and an experienced hiker. Last night was cold! Andrew woke me about midnight to borrow my jacket. Sherman and I were in the ALPS heavy tent but I was cold too. Andrew eventually bailed out of the hammock and snuggled with Sherman and I. Sherman was on duty off and on all night when the occasional owl and/or coyote filled the woods with mystery. He actually did very good and was a joy to hike and camp with. After the trek out and a few 800' hills, we hit the Midway in Weingarten for a fantastic carb filled lunch. Everyone home now. I'm settling in for a nap and the Masters. Andrew in his room and Sherman... well he is plum tuckered out! A very strange thing happened last night. I was awoken several times by light fingers touching my ears and my eyes.

personal business that didn't commence until 4:00 so spent the morning and
early afternoon hike with daypack and camera from my hotel to downtown, 2 miles
one way. Three hours in the County Music hall of fame, lunch, and a brisk hike
back made for a great day. I kept thinking about General Albert Sidney Johnston
and how he pulled his army back to Corinth Mississippi in lieu of defending
Nashville from the impending Union assault during the Civil War's western
campaign. There were no secrets during the civil war as armies consisting of
hundreds of thousands of men were difficult to hide. Spies and Calvary kept
constant watch on Buell and Grant as they assaulted the Tennessee valley. The
residents of Nashville weren't kind to the confederate army and many looked
down their entitled noses at the rural and mostly uneducated soldiers and
officers. In the end, Nashville wasn't defensible and Johnston new it. Adding
fuel to his frustration, the citizens and leaders of Civil War Nashville made
his decision much easier. Walking the now paved West End and Broadway Avenue
river hills illustrated this to me. Since he wasn't appreciated, defensive was
impossible, he opted to protect the rails at Corinth that kept the Natchez
Trace moving goods south and west. In the end, Johnston was killed during a
brilliant surprise assault at Shiloh. At the outbreak of the American Civil
War, Johnston was the commander of the U.S. Army Department of the Pacific in
California. Like many regular army officers from the South, he was opposed to
secession. But he resigned his commission soon after he heard of the secession
of his adopted state of Texas.
Great
day visiting Hall of Fame and old RCA studio B on Music Row. I'm reminded how
much country music shaped my youth. Everything from Hee Haw to Merle Haggard
and Johnny Cash reminds me of the innocent times of my youth!

In the end, I pack for camp comforts. This season’s additions include a big Agnes thermal sleeping pad and a solar cell phone charger and battery pack. I'm guessing about 38 lbs. with 5 days of food. Needless to say the 800 footers, humidity, and blue jeans made this a tough little hike. Hoping my Trail legs will come sooner after a few pre hikes. Along with me again today is my trusty pack dog, Sherman. He really is fun to hike with, doesn't complain much, but does leave valuable water in his pack dish!

Jolly Rancher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560462,"I spent last night in Chattanooga TN. As I just read some historical accounts last year on the battle of Chattanooga, it was cool seeing the confederate stronghold of Missionary Ridge with Lookout mountain silhouetted from I-24 in the evening shadows as I entered town after a fantastic Easter weekend with family. Basically the battle was yet another officer blunder from the South who's officers stopped short after their earlier route at Chickamuqua to hold the high ground.The Union quickly dug in at Chattanooga and were easily re-supplied from the North and West. In the end newly appointed General Grant who had just assumed authority over the Army in Middle Tennessee after his victories at Shiloh and Vicksburg, simply out manuvered Brixton Bragg and sent his troops to the East side of Missionary Ridge where the Conferderate sharp shooters rifles didn't have firing positions to the base of the ridge. The Rebs panicked and began to unravel. Braggs officers shifted the artillery off of Lookout Mountain allowing Union to grab the high ground with few casualties. The route was on after that as the Union moved on into Atlanta and Sherman's march to the sea! 
Today's hike was very cool. Rather than kill my self on day 1, I opted for 4.5 miles to the first shelter. Spent about 5 hours on the trail and took my pack off every 30 minutes to hydrate and smell the roses. Weather never looked like rain as the forecast predicted. Been visiting with through hikers and free spirits Free spirts from here on out are defined as young milinials who may or may not know what they are doing. They are usually through hikers who have 1 goal, ""Get to Maine in 6 months."" They usually smoke a lot of weed, say ""dude,fuck,and no way"" a lot but are always polite and courteous. Many have great respect for nature and the trail but some have no idea of ""leave no trace"". They usually are just out of college or nomadic travelers who love the thrill of high adventure and the next cool thing. I usually ask Free Spirits a lot of question, always hearing differnt tales and stories. I have to say they are my most favorite part of the trai. I never preach to them and always try to help however most are bullet proof (boy, do I understand that)and need no help. I have been taking it easy since arrival. Don't be fooled, the 1200' assent over 3 miles from Dicks to Cowart Gap gave me all I needed! Apple Watch recorded 2396 calories burned and this doesn't account for the 39 lbs on my back. A kid in camp from Wisconsin along with his quiet sidekick has been talking about his case of giraddi, a bacterial infection that stems from beaver piss and the demise of all outdoorsman who have to purify drinking water. I'm about to conjur one up just listening to him! He has a hurt knee and seems to be over compensating for the eventual exit from the trail. 80% of all who leave the trail in the first 100 miles do so because of injury, usually knees. I always try to stretch, especially, my knees each morning before hiking. Constipation is a real good thing on the trail however only hikers know the beauty of an open latrine from a scenic vista at sunrise. All good folks on the trail and I look forward to settling down for a beautiful evening on the monntain top. I'm asking God to help me be of service to others. Hit previous for earlier entries.

The owls sang beautiful songs until dawn when the turkeys took the lead in the early dawn. I must say I do miss my Fly Creek 3 that was just returned from repair after an accident Alex and his friends had when he sat on the zipper while he and his friends were hiking around Chattanooga’s Lookout Mountain. I didn't know if it would return in time so I bought the lighter and much smaller 1 man version. With all my gear in the tent because there wasn't enough room in the rain fly entrance, organization was cluttered. A quick view of my nifty Apple Watch showed rain chances around 20% until 1 so decided to break camp and head north. 4.5 mikes to Bly Gap and the North Carolina border or 7.3 miles to Muskrat Creek Shelter. I was giving myself options. Last night after visiting with the free spirited through hikers, good conversation with Jim, Trail name, Just Jim. 60 something from Colorado who is on his third attempt at Maine. He blew out his knee and is leisurely hiking back to his pickup spot, resting his knee and healing. He seemed to have found peace with it and was a very friendly man and experienced hiker. After hitting the trail around 9:30, the rain started again. A soaking rain that really changed the scenery to a bright green. (See picture) I stopped and talked with many including a pair of men my age going all the way. They were from upstate New York. I overheard them commenting on a talk Bob, the Top of Ga hostel gave about packing heavy. “its fear and fear alone that causes us to pack heavy"" I plan to drop some gear and jack rabbit my final days into the Nantahala Outdoor Center. Since I'm working through a stupid 2 year fear of the 40 mile section, I may as well go all the way! Hiking really teaches us the less is more and God will always provide. I enjoyed my lunch on top of a 3900' rock outcropping. Not sure of the mountains name. I met Cherie trail named Doc and her husband Ben, trail name Turbo, at the water hole at Bly Creek Gap. Doc just graduated medical school and will begin residency in Memphis. They are section hiking before getting off for a wedding and are from Charlotte.

Mike also on his 4th year of section hiking. They are southbound known on the trail as ""flipfloopers"". Loved his reasoning. ""You get to talk with so many more people as the endlessly stream of North bound through hikers move towards you."" I woke up to pee about 8:45 PM and the free spirits had built a large fire and were swaping tales. The mountain wind and cooler temps forced me back into my 20 degree mummy bag and the insulated heat of my tent. So far my favourite trail story is about Little Orphan Eddie. Eddie and his father started at the approach trail, a nasty 8 mile section that connects Amicalola Falls state park to the head of the AT at Springer Mountain. During a break Eddie's father was separated and mistakenly headed south instead of north. He kept passing people asking how far to Springer? People must not have understood. Eddie on the other hand kept on moving and made it to Springer solo. Hikers were relaying messages however Dad had to stay another night at the Falls. Eddie kept moving north and between hiker and text the two stayed in contact. Thus folks on the trail gave Eddie his new trail name, "" Little Orphan Eddie"". Oh yea, in case readers are worried, Eddie is 32. Ran into many on the trail. Helped Lucky Star from Texas fill her water and gave Wisconsin's trail mate, while Wisconsine was again telling the girardi bacteria story again, a cell phone charge.

Jolly Rancher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561014,"It was fun sharing camp with Dynamite, Knobe, Jim from St. Augustine, and Journey. They were all much older than I and had all met and banded in the trail. They laughed all through dinner sharing their aches and pains. One woman, Pam, trail name Savior of mankind, had left the trail twice. Once to help a young person who had a severe gall bladder infection and again to help a boy 11 miles who had blown out his knee? She took them to Blairsville hospital and saw that they made their buses home. One to Florida and the knee victim to Maine. 36 hours on a Greyhound with a blown up knee. She wasn't a nurse just a good person doing the next right thing. After thinking about her story the night prior, I passed her on the trail and thanked her for her unselfish act of kindness. Too many people hell bent on miles and time. I think the number #1 cause of injury, gall bladder infection aside, is knees. Only problem with sharing camp with folks my own age was early morning privy time. I had to conjure one up while others waited. No time to read my morning meditation but did say a rosary in the early dawn as I waited for sunrise and break camp time. I met the guy on the trail who writes trail journal. He was on a 22 Mike trail. Taught me about ramps and eatable plant. The root tastes like a very sweet onion. Outstanding! I fell into a patch of them and ate a bunch. (See ramp photo in pictures) The first 2 miles were the easiest of my hike making me feel bullet proof and thinking I may have my trail legs. Wrong, the climb up then down to deep gap followed by the mile up to Standing Indian Shelter left me wanting no more. I have been enjoying the afternoon at the shelter and talking with hikers. Most are moving up the 1.8 miles to 5400' on Standing Indian Mountain then another 2 miles down to the next camp. I'm going to tackle the mountain with fresh legs in the morning. Camp is filling with hikers and some families with young children. I met a couple, Becky and James, who paid their bills, sold their home, and plan to relocate to Eastern KY after they finish in Maine. I really like Becky and James and very respectful and full of admiration of living their dream Cooked dinner with a cross between a free spirit and an adult name David who is a bar tender along with some outdoors work in Alaska for 6 months out of the year and takes high adventure trips during the rest of time. David is from Utah and is very polite and respectful to all he meets. It’s obvious he is from a good family and has a personality that breaths life! I'm made my first ever Shelter sleep. The mice didn't creep me out! So glad I used the shelter as the rain showers came again. Breaking camp dry really is easier. Andrew, I used the thermal shield you gave me for Christmas as the liner for my bag. The wind and openness of the shelter made it cold. Best gift ever! I was snug as a bug in a rug! I’m at the 1/2 point with no idea when I will finish. I start the day aggressive then some mountain kicks my ass. Battery and solar charger not keeping up.

After breaking camp and hitting the trail at 9:00, I once again kept the pack on for an hour. At 1.76 miles, I found a beautiful overlook at 4900'. Very inspiring as the eastern sun warmed my bones. I found time to pray one Decade of the Rosary to our Blessed Mother, Mary, about my love for Jenny and the boys, I moved on with the planned rendezvous with David and maybe Becky James and Wolfgang at the top of Albert Mountain at 5200' and the 5 mile mark.

No cell service! Baby I tried and I love you! Met Potato, Bison, and a no name the others called Fluffy. Potato's husband is deployed with the Navy so her claim to fame is that she is making money by keeping her military housing allowance and keeping her expenses below the Navy's monthly allowance.

Right up there with the approach trail Alex and I hiked 4 years ago. Albert Mountain is the 100 mile spot from Springer so it was fun watching everyone celebrate. I was too busy catching my breath to do much celebrating! Made it into camp just after 5. Spending the night at Long Branch Shelter. Tent sites on the side of the hill and not very level.

I was reading about some place on this hike that gets more annual rainfall than any place on the trail, some 59 inches annually. Well, I think I found it! Had to breakdown camp in the rain and just no way to avoid getting wet. We decided to hike the 4 miles to Rock Gap, then catch a ride to my truck at Winding stair Gap. Met a famous AT guy named Seven at the Gap who ran us to my truck for a small donation in an old ""van usually found down by the river"" (Chris Farley from Sat Night Live). We let James, Becky, and Wolfgang, off at the Budget Inn, a famous AT spot. Nicer than a hostel but not nearly as nice as the Hampton Inn James and I are sharing. Food was our first order of business. I drove everyone to Huddle House. Becky had it confused with an all you can eat pancake house and was disappointed that it was a chain. Becky is from Michigan and hadn't heard of Hubble House. No worries, the chicken fried steak and eggs along with all the way hash browns and bottomless coffee suited me just fine. After checking into our room and hanging our wet gear, James and I called home then headed down the hill to do our laundry, a must after 7 damp days on the trail. We hit the Dillard house just 15 miles south on the Georgia border. Must stop for anyone! (See pictures) Southern fried chicken, country stewed steak, rice gravy, cream corn, green/lima beans, butternut squash sweetened with spice and sugar, homemade rolls, pickled tomatoes and cucumbers, fried okra, slaw, and fresh strawberry cooler with ice cream.

Jolly Rancher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561444,"I fell into my usual business routine at the Hampton, getting up early and tending to some business and personal affairs. As my new position at CE will involve getting customers up and running on our ""buy from your phone app"", I have transferred everything, and am living from my phone. Banking, bill pay, shopping, and personal communication are now on my phone. I really want to live with my phone to be better able to make changes to our app that make our next generation of customers uses this technology to keep our nimble company moving forward for the next generation of employees and customers. After 7 days of no coffee, I started drinking it at Huddle House with new friends and didn't quit until returning from the Dillard House. Man, was that food good! I met Pete in the Lobby who is the retired Fire Chief from Franklin. I learned a lot about last fall’s forest fires that eventually spread into a fierce wind storm and devastated the Gatlinburg area and took some lives. What I am about to write is disappointing to mankind and reminds me that God gave his only son to forgive our sins. You see, firefighting is big business. Millions of dollars are spent each year fighting fires and entire industry of free-lance contractors and locals have figured out the game. The fires were intentionally set and actually began at Standing Indian Mountain along the AT. (See earlier entry) It was obvious to me that that the fires swept NE along the trail as the burned evidence was everywhere. These people many times set the fires so the Federal, State, and local Governments will declare disasters and open the money chest to pay fire fighters. Pete said the real culprit is the forest service in the GA/NC area who simply watched the fires for days and weeks, trying to determine the direction. Once they start, more fires are set until the situation becomes out of control. Wow, was this eye-opening but in the end, not surprising. You can trace everything back to money. I 
haven't been there yet but many on the trail have spoken about the AT section between NOC and the Park where the winds picked up and eventually spread over the top of Clingman's Dome (the Highest point on the AT 6644') and into nearby Gatlinburg and Sevierville. I hit 9:00 mass at St Francis of Assisi, just 2 miles from the Hampton. Very appropriate as I'm praying for St Francis's intercession daily and enjoyed a full 5 decades of the Rosary, to our Blessed Mother Mary. I prayed for those that Pete told me were already at the airport waiting for some fires to start. I guess they don't even understand 59 inches of rain with high humidity and not much dead underbrush because of last year's fire. Experience proves that criminals are never very smart. Pete mentioned that for decades the fires always start along the AT and hikers building camp fires aren't the culprits. He stated ""Since the 1960's there is always a fire that starts near Winding Stair gap,"" the gap I left my truck on the 17th. ""They start there because it's easy for the arsonist to park, walk a short bit into the forest, start the fire, and then drive away until the call and promise of pay comes. Local fireman hate forest fires because it pulls them away from their primary responsibility, property and people."" After picking up David after mass we hit 76 outdoors, a famous AT destination on the Franklin Square. I bought gifts for the family and picked up a few close out deals for myself. New items for the final trek include a firm camp pillow, some electrolyte enhancing grape flavored water tablets, and a new Columbia SPF 40 hiking shirt. I was wearing a full cotton fishing shirt that became saturated with sweat or rain. Although it dried quickly, it was cold when damp especially when cooling down after arrival in camp. I had to sleep with it in my bag each night so it would be dry for the next morning’s hike. I also dropped my stove, fuel canister, and a few other unneeded items. I'm going to Jack Rabbit Hike for the next 4 days with a much lighter pack. The only weight I added was my Fly Creek UL 3, which weighs 2.8 lbs. vs 2.0 lbs. from the UL1. With more rain predicted Thursday and Friday, the extra room and middle of the night pee factor make it so much more spacious with easy in, easy out access than my UL1. So easy to lock and load all gear, dress for the day, then breakdown tent and ground cloth in the rain if necessary. All the while keeping myself and the rest of my gear dry! We made numerous shopping stops including trips to the post office, Walmart, several outdoors stores, and a great lunch at the Root and Barrel, another hiker destination in the Franklin Square. (See my burger and fries!) Becky allowed me to try some of her mac and cheese and it accidently mixed with my fries. I had to ask for another sample! David and I made a dry run in the truck up to NOC. The winding mountain road of HWY 28 made for a great drive as the 20 miles snaked into the NC Mountains revealing a simple way of life on some very dangerous curves. I kept thinking about Eustis from Mountain Men, a History channel series I watch from time to time. Arrived at NOC after 5 and most of the through hikers were already enjoying a snack and a cold one. I had purchased some trail magic at Walmart including candy bars and Gaiter Aide but will save it for the trip out and a stop at Clingman's Dome. I always say you leave Appalachia when you start the descent from the Cherokee NC side of the park into the commercial world of Tennessee's Gatlinburg and Sevierville. Sometimes I just move all the way out to I-40 and stay at the Hampton or Holiday Inn at Bass Pro. I'm hoping to use a free night from Hampton in Gatlinburg so I can at least enjoy a last stroll through town and maybe some ice cream before thinking about my next move late this weekend. I really won't be in a position to book another stay until I see how the hike goes this week. I am anxious to get back on the trail and David and I each commented that we feel like we have been in town for a week! After a 6 AM breakfast we plan to pick up David and Becky around 6:30. I'll drop the 3 of them (Wolfgang from Germany is sleeping in and leaving the pose) around 7 at Rock Gap. I'm meeting Katheryn Singer my most Christian shuttle driver at 8:30 in the upper long term parking lot of NOC for the shuttle back to Winding Stairs at Hwy 64, 10 miles west of Franklin. Weather looks great and I'm packing a cold cut combo loaded with vegetables and mustard for one last taste of civilization during evening meal. The rest of the week will consist of spam packs, tortillas, and condiments I grabbed at the hotel breakfast bar. Still packing many granola bars and nuts from a March Sam's club run for breakfast, lunch, and snacks. Defiantly not going hungry. I'm asking God to help me be of service to others.

Jolly Rancher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561583,"After one last Hampton Inn breakfast, too many cups of coffee, and a foggy morning drive up to NOC on Route 28, it was back to the task at hand. Katheryn picked me up at NOC and together we navigated the foggy mountain roads as she spoke of always keeping bibles in her vehicles. I'm telling you, I needed to read a few comforting Jesus Parables as she snaked around corner after corner, driving at her usual mountain speed while I clung to the handrail privately citing some quick Hail Mary’s! All good, and I made it safe and sound for the morning's hike into the backcountry of North Carolina. David, Becky, and James are starting 4 miles before me at Rock Gap, our rainy take out spot on Sunday. As I already have a short section Alex and I missed, it will be simple enough to come back some day and pick up the missed 4 miles along with the missed 7 miles in GA from 4 years ago. It will be a good test for some Kelly and Jenny training hikes someday. Speaking of Jenny, I miss her, the boys, and the animals so much. If it wasn't for the love of family, and I mean everyone, I would consider to just keep going, hoping God would show the way. God has shown me the way and its back to Cape Girardeau for an upcoming weekend visit to help Alex and friends move into a summer apartment in St Charles MO just west of St Louis. God will show me the way and I always knew a continued through hike isn't in the playbook right now. It wasn't even an option but a high adventure thrill seeker like me can't help but think, ""Could it be someday?"" Meeting Becky and James showed me that anyone can reach for the stars and how cool it is doing it with the ones we love! Of course just spending time with Jenny in any shape, form, or fashion is all I need. She is my everything and I think about her constantly. I downloaded a few Vince Gill songs that she recommended that make me verklempt with emotion, longing to be back in her arms. David on the other hand taught me that capturing adventure is so cool during our youth. I don't regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it, but love seeing the trail and hospitality through his eager eyes. He is a good dude and all I ask is for him to pass it on some day. We have enjoyed each other’s company and even caught up on the NBA playoffs during our nose picking time. Hike started with the usual 2 miles up from Winding Stair Gap. Pack feels much better since I dropped stove and a few non essentials. 2 nights in a soft bed definitely softened me as well. Definitely easier than last Monday! Sky turned overcast but sun started poking through at the top of mountain before Panther Gap. I stopped at the 3.7 mark when David and Wolfgang caught up so we decided to stop for lunch. David ate his Subway club sandwich; I opted to save my cold cut combo for dinner tonight. Sun came out and I caught a short nap, basking in the sunshine of Gods spirit. Several joined us including a bunch from Florida we have seen off and on including my favorite guy, Lunchbox. Lunchbox has been cussing every mile of the trail. Likes hiking, hates sleeping outdoors? Wolfgang taught me Gluckliche Wanderwege pronounced ""goodenveich"" meaning happy trails in German. David and I stopped at Wyaha Gap. I was packing an extra 5 liters of water. No way was I going up 1200' to Winespring mountain top with the extra water. We decided to drink all we could, dump the rest, and move 2 more miles to Winespring. 1/2 way up mountain with water. When we stopped to drink and dump the water, David admitted his shins were in very intense pain. Having watched years of high school athletes suffer from shin splints, we sat at Wylaha Gap for an hour while we talked through a very hard decision on David's part. In the end some field google diagnosis revealed he was either suffering from shin splints or a stress fracture. A paved road 13 miles from Franklin on a beautiful sunny afternoon with much traffic was the correct decision. I hung around until he thumbed a ride from what looked like a respectable local in a grey Nissan. I'll be near until Friday and will check with my new friend before we go our separate ways. Resting a shin splint on the bench in Franklin may not keep young David out of the game! Good thing David exited. The last 2 miles up Winecreek Mountain were brutally hard. No so much slope but a rocky surface that wouldn't end. In the end it was worth it as it always is. Beautiful sunset while we all enjoyed a heavy meal. Joined by Sky who did 20 today and just earned her PHD in Bio Chemistry at Emery in Atlanta. Everyone concerned about David and not much cell signal up here. GO figure, 5300' and no cell signal?

Jolly Rancher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561846,"My morning started early. Hampton breakfast bar on Tuesday, plenty of fiber on the trail, and my subway cold cut combo run through the garden needed an exit plan. No wind, beautiful sunrise, and a fallen oak limb contoured slightly away from my lower 1/2 and on a gentle downward incline made for a beautiful set of perfect S missiles that exited the chamber with all the grace and ease God built my body. Thanks again God for building me exactly the way I'm supposed to be! I think I'll compose a gratitude list today! On top of mountains early in the morning, I hear almost an inner ear sound that seems to emit from the ground. Low thud that sounds like a kid is bouncing a basketball in the basement with a high dribble down to a series a quick low dribbles. I need to Google that or talk to someone more in tune with the Earth. This morning a small cross was hanging from a tree limb 2 feet from my tent. No way would I have missed it last night. A trail Angel must have left it last night. (See Hope Cross picture) I treated myself to a dispenser of Nuun Active at 76 the other day. These contain 12 tablets of a vitamin enriched water flavoring that really jump starts hydration and turns a filtered bottle of mountain water into an electrolyte replacing energy drink similar to Gator Aid. Not much sugar and only adds 8 carbs to a 32 oz. Nalgene bottle. I also tried one package of scratch labs lemon lime but preferred the less expensive grape nuun better. Made the short 2 mile hike to the other side of the mountain at Wyaha Bald observation tower. Wow! Is all I can say? With 76 degree and a cool mountain breeze, it was spectacular. (See pictures) The full sun allowed my best in class Anker solar panels that clip on the back of my Osprey Atmos 65 backpack to fully charge my phone and battery pack. I talked with many through and day hikers during my long stay at that peaceful place. I heard from David. He has a stress fracture, is getting a boot, then heading home to Utah. Very disappointed for David and know he will be back sooner than later. I hung around at the bald too long, caught too much sun, and missed the fact that Cold Springs was 7 miles away. Kicked it hard and made it just at sunset. Great day! I'm asking God to help me be of service to others. Hit previous for earlier entries. Sign my guest book often.","Winespring Side Mountain Camp

Jolly Rancher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562144,"When I arrived at Cold Spring Shelter just after dark it was open except for Macon Bacon, a young software geek from Maryland. This 24 year old was nervous as a blind queer at a wiener roast. He reminded me of one of the characters from Big Bang Theory. Had read and studied everything about AT, and was now doing it by the book. Nice enough boy who is obviously smart and raised right. Glad I slept in the shelter as the rain came back. Some ladies my age moved in to repackage their gear and gave me some trail magic! Instead of spam and flour tortillas for dinner, I now have spaghetti and mac and cheese! Spam for lunch today instead of my last granola bar. Life is good! Hiked my usual 1.76 miles in the rain. Stopped at the 1 hour mark and hunkered down out of the wind and found cell service. Confirmed room at the Hampton in Cherokee for Friday night. I'm thinking casino Buffett! It's amazing how much the body craves calories when it's burning 3000 to 5000 per day. I have been thinking a lot about Allen Toole's mom who just turned 90. She was our grade school cook in the cafeteria and man could she do wonders with government meat, cheese, flour, yeast, peanut butter, milk, eggs, oranges, celery, carrots, and beans. At the 4 mile point, I stopped at Teleco Gap for lunch. Then the rain came. I mean buckets of rain. I hunkered down under my poncho and the women who gave me the food took pity on me and let me get in their warm car. This was their take out point. Wow was that a miracle! I'm guessing these gals don't have men waiting for them but very sweet indeed! I stayed in the car till they kicked me out then started the 3.0 mile slosh to the next shelter. Well after the 3 mile slosh, arriving at 3, the pose decided to do the next 6 miles and make the NOC by 7. They reserved a room for 8 and needed an 8th. Ole Kelbob said, “count me in"". Cheeseburgers and a warm dry room were too much to pass up even if it meant navigating the stairs down to 1700' in the dark. I left Weiser Bald shelter at 4 listening to some free spirits chatter on and on about smoking weed. The other 1/2 of the shelter is being shared by the women who have no men waiting for them at home. Only a few left at Teleco pass. The rest of the evening on the trail actually sounded much better than the nonsense in the shelter. Last 6 were about the best of my hiking career. 3:49 minutes in some pretty tough terrain along the ridges of the Nantahala River. Well-deserved zero day tomorrow to rest and heal my feet.

Jolly Rancher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562240,"Treated the pose to McDonald’s breakfast. DIdgeridamn (defined as like the instrument Didgeridoo) from Australia. He was born in Berlin but grew up in Georgia. He joined us along with old trail mates Becky, James, Wolfgang, Bison, Potato, Calvin ""Calvin takes a walk"", Fluffy Puppy. Calvin has been through hiking since March and has just built himself up to 6 to 8 per day. Like this guy, kind of, rather than kill him and go home injured, he opted for 1 to 2 miles per day until he got his trail legs. We each love coffee and enjoyed a nice conversation this morning. He has been living in Boston for the past 3 years, seems to act like he knows more than he really does, and is on the trail for one reason or another. He asked that I post a picture to his FB group, “Calvin takes a walk"" which I did. We did laundry at the NOC then headed out to gift some trail magic! Becky, James, and Wolfgang caught my enthusiasm and bought drinks, real white bread, peanut butter and jelly at the gas station in Cherokee. The lucky winners were 8-10 through hikers who stumbled on us at the high point on the trail, Clingmans Dome at 6642'. Serving sugared soda, real full sized candy bars, Doritos, and PB&J to the famished hikers was a real joy and made this trip almost complete for me! We walked to the top of the Clingmans observation tower and took many photos on a rare clear, sunny, warm, spring afternoon. Wolfgang actually looked like he enjoyed my moving history of FDR's New Deal and the creation of the National Park System during the depression. I did mention that his county was building a war machine during the same time, all in good humor of course. After that we meandered into Gatlinburg, parked in the middle of town, strolled to the NOC outdoors store then ate pizza at Mellow Mushroom. It was then back to the Hampton in Cherokee for one last warm dry sleep before shuttling to Fontana Dam the back to NOC for my final 30 miles. Today turned out so much better than I planned because I turned it all over to God and just guided the bus! I'm asking God to help me be of service to others. Hit previous for earlier entries.

Jolly Rancher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562426,"My morning started out early at the Hampton in Cherokee. After showering and reorganizing our gear after the beautiful day gifting trail magic and strolling through Gatlinburg, we relaxed in our room, caught up on journals and blogs, and then started dozing as I watched ""Lincoln"", a fantastic movie about our 16th president and the real story behind his passage of the 13th amendment and Emancipation Proclamation. Many know that our family studies history and have visited many Civil War battlefields and museums. Lincoln's stall of Grant at Harpers Ferry was brilliant, allowing the right moment in history to happen just the way God intended. During my executive business travel with CE, I'm always staying in nice 4 and 5 star hotels. My biggest problem with these palaces is the lack of early morning coffee other than the mere cup that is left in the room. Hilton, IHG, always have 24 hour coffee so early morning adventurers like myself can guzzle bean juice and start at any hour with prayer, meditation, and stimulant! Becky and James shared one queen and Wolfgang opted for the floor with a comfortable pillow, his air pad and sleeping bag. He was comfortable and I slept like a baby in the comfort of the other queen. Sharing a bed with a dude, well I'm not there yet, however in my spirit of service did make the offer. Thanks God for the little things! My mind turned to gear and a possible Smoky Mountain park hike early this summer with Jenny. The backpacking industry is constantly getting better, lighter, and expensive. I only made 1 purchase, a new pair of Hi Tek Altitude IV weatherproof boots. As this technology is at least 7 years old, the price point is actually less than when I bought my first pair in 2010/2011, training for our Philmont Trek with BSA Troop 16, my beginning to yet another expensive and worthwhile hobby. My boots have over 400 miles on them and have already been repaired once. The young Free Spirits will find weight, glue, and many other flaws with these boots however I'm a firm believer of sticking with what works. The firm ankle support and all around comfort, warmth, and dryness of these boots have worked and I don't feel like breaking in new technology only to find it doesn't work and incur additional expense trying another brand and technology. The price point dropped from over $100 to around $70 so I dropped shipped a new pair home for the next hike. The old ones won't be flung into a tree or line as many often do as they have the Philmont  P (then backwards S) branded in the back. Only way to get this brand is to hike above 10k at Philmont and have staff brand them at the ranch. (See picture) Do you think Jenny will allow them as a center piece in our living room? As far as out fitting Jenny goes, I'm going to start watching eBay figuring the hiking community must be like the exercise equipment community, investing then realizing it wasn't for them and selling good equipment at bargain used prices. I'm asking Becky lots of questions. She has researched many gear items for women, is a member of the AT Women's FB page, and has lots of good tips and tricks for gear she likes and doesn't like. Black Diamond trekking poles will be my first stop when Jenny better indicates her interest in joining. I use Black Diamond and couldn't recommend or hike without poles. They have saved my butt too many times on this and the many other hikes I have completed. Taking the pressure off of knees and aiding the downhill stuff is a must for older hikers. I also bought Jenny a good book that gives many tips, tricks, and advice on a long Appalachian Trail trek. I can't wait to see her hang a bear bag! (Just kidding baby, I leave my food out for the bears) In case anyone has noticed, I stop often on the trail and keep this journal in my IPHONE notes, then post in the evenings where I can find cell service. This is why first person is used because my brain and grammar isn't that great. On this morning, the site is down for Data Migration so I am unsure if this post will stay consistent with my other daily posts. I'll know tonight and today's hike will be the hardest of the trip. 8 miles up from 1700 to 4900' the troops rallied and we met Patrice our shuttle driver in Bryson City. No room for all of us in her Fontana so I dropped James, Becky, and Wolfgang back at NOC then followed Patrice to Fontana for the return trip to NOC. Looking at packs, James carries the zpack. I've noticed the Dynema and he carried arc blast. This will be my next back allowing Jenny to inherit my Osprey Atmos 65, a gold star standard. Becky carries Gossamer gorilla and uses black diamond zpoles, carbon fiber. The weather turned to hot as the roar of Nantahala along with the sounds of Hwy 19 faded into the gentle breeze of the forested AT. The climb up was switch backed and the pain of my heart and lungs much less severe than prior starts. I'm really feeling good physically. The hot salty sweat reeking of yesterday's meat lover’s pizza stung my eyes as I gradually climbed higher into the great beauty of this land. I stopped every 30 minutes to keep myself hydrated and refilled water at the 4 mile mark. Lunch consisted of a strawberry stinger waffle and my old standby, nature valley granola bar. Water hole was nice and not many hikers up here today. Felt so much better being above 3500'! I chatted with Pearl, real name Hanna at the water hole before calling home. Pearl told me she got trail name because she brushes her teeth every night then she lifted her arm pit and I was down wind of her. Sweetheart, how about running that tooth brush on those pits every now and then? That was my thought when she kept referring to her trail family who were obviously way behind her for good reason. OK God, I know you made us smell like that for good reason. You also gave me your sense of humor and I smelled your sense of humor in Pearls glands! Could you have dialed it down any? I felt Ike Forest Gump walking the ridge line at 5000'. When I got hungry..... I ate    when I got tired..... I slept.   All the while thinking about my Jenny.  I arrived at camp around 5:45. Camp sites were few so grabbed a decent spot up near the trail, just a few yards below the ridge line to help shield the brisk west wind. Wolfgang was already there and James and Becky stayed at NOC for lunch so were an hour or so behind. Rain shower started as soon as I set up my chair and rent.  I am so glad I brought my 3 Fly Creek 3. This tent is a legend having survived 7 years of backpacking and Scout camping. You simply don't see them anymore. I almost opted for the 1lb lighter Big Agnes Fly Creek UL1 for this leg of the trek. I can sit up in my packing chair during rain and read, pray, call home, meditate. . James and Becky arrived and we cooked. I left my crew weight butterfly stove and white gas bottle behind opting to mooch a quick hot water boil from others. Too much needed light weight gear and not enough money although Alex has a good butterfly stove I should have looked before I left. Good to be in the back country again. Nice to go to bed at 8 and sleep till 7, something I can't seem to do at home or in a hotel. I started talking with the young people about heroine and the opioids that are in their world so inexpensively. Not preaching as most of them are out here to stay away from preachers. I just work it in from time to time telling them of my concern and making very general statements about caution. On occasion I point out the triangle patch hanging from my pack and casually mention that if they ever run into problems with drugs or alcohol, look for a room with a triangle on the door.

",Sassafras Gap Shelter,"Apr 29, Sat",8
Jolly Rancher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562452,"The wind howled as dawn broke on sassafras shelter and the birds began their song of plenty. I'm reminded of the Gospel (Mathew I think) where Jesus teaches that God provides birds all they need, plants have all they need, and us all we need. All we have to do is trust and place ourselves at the feet of Jesus. Backpacking really teaches that less is more and carrying our fears is simply dead weight on the trail. Excess gear nice in camp on the occasions we use but God provides soft ground to sit and sleep and beautiful trees to shade and lean our weary backs. I say all this as I watch the sunrise from my comfortable Moon Lance pack chair! I couldn't let it go even though it weighs well over 1lb. I have let go of many items this trip. When I repacked in Franklin, I left behind an estimated 8 lbs. of things that once were considered crucial and now are only fears that I outgrew over a 100 mile trek. My friend Milt says that fear is like the size 5 Keds All-stars that we wore as children. They are still there and still size 5, we just outgrew them. Hiking and encountering everyone I meet the way Jesus did is allowing me to outgrow the few fears I have about people and I'm still fighting through, with much improvement I might add, my terrible fear of economic insecurity. I think this comes from parents who were raised poor but with much love during the depression and WWII. Free Spirits on the trail seem to be free of such worries for their 6 month journey but privately they all mention life, career, and future in a passing sentences. With only 20 miles to Fontana my options are 9.1 miles to Brown Fork Gap shelter or 15.2 miles to Cable Gap shelter. I'm thinking the 15.2 is a better option since rain is predicted on Monday. This will leave a short 5 miles downhill walk into Fontana Dam at 1750'. As today is Sunday and no obvious mass locations, I'll stop and at least read the Liturgy of the word from Laudate, a great Catholic app that lists daily readings, Saint of the day, Order of the Hour prayers etc.  Hoping I can grab cell signal somewhere and the TrailJournal.com page is finished with Data Migration so I can post yesterday's journal and pictures so those I love can follow me and know that I'm safe in God's care. I passed Michelle who I met yesterday coming down from my 3 mile climb to the bald. She is training and said she enjoyed her wine but the howling wind kept her up all night. I gave her my 2 bits about fear and gear, saving God conversation for another day. Preacher from Arizona passed me on the trail. I had heard about him from others, through hiking with a cane. He described a whole plethora of back and neck surgeries and ailments. “Why Preacher,"" I asked. “I am a preacher in a religion I practice on my own out here rediscovering my faith."" Others deceived Preacher in his 60s or 70s. He is 54, same as me. Grief. I stopped at Cheoah Bald prayed, mediated, caught up on my journal then goofed around with text to close friends. Realizing I was only 2 miles into a possible 15.2 mike hike I kicked 2 miles in less than an hour before stropping to hydrate and eat a granola bar. At the six mile mark, I posted Today's journal from my notes. No clue what cell conditions or mood will be after my attempt at 15. Only other person I have seen on the trail today is Lock Smith. She and I have been leap frogging during the many 300' ups and downs of this trail section. When I arrived at the 7.5 mile marker, Stecoah Gap, someone left trail magic in the picnic area. Fresh red apples! This is the first real gift of service other than friendship from others that God has gifted me through one of his considerate children! At my age, the fiber and sugar from the apples fleshy fruit is much more needed that a candy bar or a sugared soda. Hash from California was boiling water so I decided to eat at the picnic Gap before knocking out the last 8. Down to only 3 granola bars but still had 4 3 serving freeze dried meals. Party down with a combo of mac and cheese, chicken Alfredo, and chili mac, all boiled into a taste sensation bowl for one. I started up Jacob's ladder at 4:30 and finished at 6:00. This is one of the nastiest 1.7 mile climbs on the entire trail. I left all the bad words out there so all I have to say is thanks for letting it be over. 4 miles to go at 7:43 with sunset at 8:20.  I'll be   landing with low fuel light on. Hope the runway lights are lit!  Finally arriving at camp around 11:30 PM climaxed my most challenging and rewarding day ever on the trail. I hiked 15.3 miles and according to my Apple Watch spent 9.5 hours averaging 38 minutes per mile and 15.5 hours on the trail. This included 4 hours of night hiking under Uncle Mike's crescent shaped moon. I gave all my fears to God and his son Jesus and just guided the bus with my weary legs and sore feet. Thanks God for allowing me to treat all I encountered the same way Jesus did for us. I'm asking God to help me be of service to others. Hit previous for earlier entries.

",Cable Gap Shelter,"Apr 30, Sun",15
Jolly Rancher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562772,"Well the final three miles of this chapter in my trek were uneventful yet full of gratitude and hope. Walking to Fontana Dam and seeing man's innovation surrounded by the beauty of the Great Smokey Mountain National park is something most will just have to see for themselves. By gratitude, I mean the grace from God for family and the love Jenny and I share with our sons Alex and Andrew. I'm also grateful for the beautiful sunshine, the singing of the birds, and the flowering of the mountain flowers and trees after the sometimes warm rain over the past 15 days. I believe God's Grace is always present; we just get too busy to recognize it. Habitual Grace is grace we get hooked on (a habit) and don't know we are addicted until it is removed for one reason or another. I hear this all the time from people who pray the Rosary in Adoration Chapels at crazy hours but have to quit for one reason or another. They didn't know they were addicted until they couldn't attend and pray any longer. A 97 miles stroll through the woods, mountains, valleys, and streams of one of his most beautiful creations, Appalachia, is what it took for me to slow down, outgrow my fears, and smell the roses during my time on earth. I'm happy but sorry to know that I'll miss this Habitual Grace and always long to be back on the trail. Although I did not sit at the Alter for Sunday Eucharist, I did read the liturgy of the word from Laudate IPhone app from the Gospel of Luke 24-13:35. In this reading two disciples were walking away from Jerusalem called Emmaus and were conversing about the things that had occurred during the trial and crucifixion of. Jesus happened while they were conversing and debating. Emmaus can be defined as God's home and the two were walking away believing that Jesus was dead and his ministry was over. Jesus himself drew near and walked with them. The disciple’s eyes were blinded and they did not recognize Jesus. As evening fell, Jesus gave the impression that he was going further but they urged him, ""Stay with us, for it is evening and the day is almost over."" And it happened that, while he was with them at table, he took bread, said the blessing, broke it, and gave it to them. With that their eyes were opened and they recognized him but he vanished from their sight. They set out at once and returned to Jerusalem (Home of God in the Old Testament) where they found gathered together the eleven and those with them who were saying, ""The Lord has truly been raised and has appeared to Simon!"" Then the two recounted what had taken place on the way and how he was made known to them in the breaking of the bread. As Christians, we all must break bread together with Jesus present at our table. As Catholics we have the opportunity to break bread with Jesus each and every day at the Universal Alter Table through our Sacrament of Eucharist. Our eyes are opened during Eucharist! I have been walking to Emmaus since January of 2017. It didn't start with my job or my backpacking trek. It started with Cursillo! Cursillo is a four day program that outlines a structure to practice piety, study, and action. Oddly enough, our Protestant brothers and sisters have adopted the program and call it ""Walk to Emmaus."" Hiking the Appalachian Trail, or others like it, is such a great way to break bread with our brothers and sisters and carry a message that can be seen and heard as our ""eyes are opened"". Sometimes it’s bringing someone water to drink, first aid, food to eat, and other life sustaining substances. Other times it's providing nourishment through a warm smile, greeting, friendship, and being of service to others however God chooses to place in front of us. Walk with your eyes open! For those readers who may be turned off by God and any Bible chatter, let me tell this story the way ""Ridge Runner"", a female trail volunteer shared with me at the NOC. I first met Ridge Runner when I was stripping down in the parking lot of our bunk house, too exhausted from the day’s 12 mile trek to say my name. She kept asking questions. Assuming she was a Yankee tourist, I wasn't very Christ like and was giving her brief short ""Mr. Johnson"" answers. Finally she introduced herself as the volunteer who maintains the trail section I had just hiked and was asking questions so she could provide any needed trail maintenance and feedback about hikers, bears, trash, downed trees, etc... I felt badly about being short and reintroduced myself along with an apology the next morning while we were making breakfast together in the camp common area. Our conversation moved to the tragedy of the American Cherokee Indians being forced out of this beautiful land by the Jackson administration. I'm a student of history, not a political advocate for restitution concerning action during the Indian Removal Act of 1829. I am a lover of nature and student of the American Indian through my registration with the Boy Scouts of America. (Personal political problems with BSA policy now but that's another story) Their exit from this land was on my mind hour after hour as I walked, fell, shivered and perspired, in such a beautiful place. Knowing that the Cherokees and most Indian tribes worshiped their land the way we worship Jesus. I have a deep appreciation for their love of this land if it's anything like my love of God and his son Jesus, my home, and then I understand. I know we share the same love of family and tribe. Ridge runner explained that the Cherokees had seven directions. North, South, East, West, Up, Down, and Self. This was common in their language, often shortened conversation, and was handy in the back country for hand signals when hunting game. I don't know the translation so Goggle it. Every one of my friends and family are familiar with the Trail of Tears as a memorial park is built near Cape Girardeau in a location near the place where many of the force marched Indians crossed the Mississippi river on their horrible trek to reservations in Oklahoma and other locations. The Cherokees had to walk away from their Emmaus so it truly was a Trail of Tears. Along with losing loved ones to sickness, starvation, and cruel treatment, they had to walk away from their God, the land of their ancestry. Ridge Runner explained that they truly lost direction, settling in a land that only had four directions. Without up and down, they lost their seventh direction, Self. In today's virtual world filled with mobility, travel opportunities, and endless potential journeys that lead to God and Emmaus, I would encourage readers to add three more directions. Find you’re up and down, and then find a God of your understanding who gave us life born into sin. He gives us countless opportunities and Grace to reconcile, repent, and make restitution. Always walk toward him so you can recognize and cherish the seventh direction, Self. I'm asking God to help me of service to others and remind me every day that less is more.","Fontana dam road

Jolly Rancher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/562688,"I awoke on the first day of May to the pitter patter of rain drops. Packed my gear and moved into the rain shelter of Cable Gap. The group that had it occupied during my late night entrance was my old friend Lucky Star, Pearl, and 3 others dudes. We chatted about our coffee addiction, filtered water and prepared for the days 8 rainy miles. The privy was first class so I enjoyed a granola filled movement, ate cold breakfast and hit the trail just after 8. I stopped at 2 mile mark to eat. Rain coming hard with wind gusts I later found out was at 55mph. Well, my boots are now officially retired. Water soaked feet and a cold dampness forced me off the trail at the 6 mile mark. Grabbed bunk at the Hiker Inn for a small fee. Drying was critical as a damp chill over took my weary bones. The 15 miles day prior and the heaviness of my wet boots and socks along with my gear was all I needed for the day. A fatigue is on me and I'll sleep early after enjoying the rest of my dehydrated food. I didn't encounter many today but did my best to be helpful.

Did .61 miles straight up in 30 minutes so not as far out of shape as I could be after taking off 6 weeks. Ron is a retired postal worker who once worked at a teacher and principal. The trail ran straight up on Mollies Ridge. I have read about this hike. It continues for about 10 miles up. I opted to camp at the first camp  ground at the 6 mile mark.

Moving into higher ground today with Clingmans dome at 6642 most likely tomorrow. The Chicago folks played Eucker in the shelter and built a fire last night as the WPA era shelters have stone fire places. We did encounter a hog snake working his way through the bottom set of racks. Good mouse hunting in these places! We watched him exit next to my sleeping spot.

Last 6 miles to Derrick knob were army ranger mikes. Saw a bear 1.2 miles before the shelter. I jump a bear .1 miles in the dusk who growled before he or she ran to the east. No bears in 188 miles then 2 within an hour! Grief, I camped next to the shelter and hung my food high! RAin the next few days!","

Jolly Rancher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569635,"Day4. Hiked 6 miles to a shelter and laid up for nap and took the boots off. Fairly easy 2 miles to Double spring Gap shelter. Entered the evergreens above 5500. Black tail deer and turkey everywhere! Usual gang was here. Wendy, Pete, Kristina, Ben , John, Marvin, Van, Hunter, scout father and son along with a few others. Ben and group are doctors. Ben is a walking encyclopedia. Knows everything about everything if you know what I mean. He is local and is handy to answer any and all nature. Matt the father of the scout who actually just hiked in informed me an 80 year old woman who is really struggling is behind. She is hiking with 2 nurses who had to give her additional electrolytes. As the rain is falling by the buckets, Il take my time and see if I can be of service as I can carry some extra weight. Clingmans in 2.5 miles , up in the rain. Jenny wants to talk and that old fear came rushing in at 3:30 this morning when in saw her text. We traded a few more texts and I feel better. I think everything is ok but the fear still lurks. God and I still have the plan on schedule, however family and my willingness to allow God's sunshine into my spirit still weigh heavily on my mind. I just have to remind myself that I'm still work in process and need to continue despite obstacles. I'm asking God to help me be of service to others.","Derrick Knob shelter

Jolly Rancher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569636,"Day 5. 2.5 miles to Clingmans was beautiful! Rain shower ended as I left Silers Bald shelter brought a glissoning glow to the park. I snapped a few photos pictures and chatted with tourist who were ascending the .5 mile climb from the parking lot. One lady named Mary Anne snapped my picture. I'm the first AT hiker she ever met! My fame was short lived as the rain began again in buckets. It quit 30 minutes later then began again just as I entered Mt Collins shelter. Camped with the usual along with Morgan Kelley, a young ridge runner from Nashville. Very polite young man. I'm bunking in the shelter tonight. Enjoyed my first try at mash potatoes with meat. Next time will use more water.","Silars bald Shelter

Jolly Rancher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569637,"Day 6 hiked 4.5 down to Newfound Gap. Stopped 1.7 miles for a break and mini dry out. When I arrived at the gap, I removed everything from my pack to dry from the past 2 days of rain. All the tourists were walking past snapping pictures. Many stopped to ask me about my adventure. I felt like Bear Grills! A man named Ron had his wife take a picture of the two of us. After drinking all my water there wasn't a water source so a kindly man filled my jugs from a gallon he had in his car. It tasted awful but saved my butt during the 3 mile trek up to ice water shelter. I can't tell you how beautiful it is at this 6000' Shelter ! Folks pay hundreds and thousands to vacation in this area and my view cost $20 through hiker pass. I did log the miles and God did the rest! I'm asking God to help me be of service to others.","

Jolly Rancher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569638,"day 7 Camped at Tri corner Shelter - We were joined by a group who paid $800 to REI for a 3 day adventure. It really made us appreciated the $20 through hiker permit and all we  have seen. I have befriended Senja and Lori, the two nurses from California. Senja's 80 year old friend had to leave the trail at Clingmans Dome. She has been loaning me her I phone cable and I'm grabbing a few trickles of charge with my solar panel. I lost my battery and forgot my iPhone cables. The ""tourist"" hikers are very inexperienced but their guides did bring plenty of filed meals and I finished off all the left overs! I can't get enough to eat out here and the extra calories were welcome. The guides built a fire in the stone fire place, allowing us to dry our sweat soaked stinky clothes. I'm getting good at sleeping in shelter, exhausted from the day's hike understanding that the person next to me stinks just as badly as I. Water spring is only a few yards from the shelter. This is very welcome to hikers who hate to walk any further than necessary. The quiet of hiking without my music has really been transforming to me. Feeling God's presence in the beautiful part of the world has awaken my senses. I can't tell you how serene I feel. (usually more serene on the downhill part). I'm going to  be of service to my new friends and give them a ride after our 17 mile hike out tomorrow. I'm looking forward to speaking with Jenny and boys and miss them terribly. Tomorrow is Father's day and Jenny's brother Dan and his son D are at our home. I'm guessing Missouri Fireworks are in the picture for 8 year old Dan Jr.!","

Jolly Rancher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569640,"Day 8 completed the Smokey's! My most aggressive hike of this trek! Everything working in sync and I really trekked both up and down the mountains. Scenery was the most spectacular and I paused many times to admire God's handy work. The descent down to the gap brought about higher temperatures and bugs. I was reminded of the reality of June's heat and how much I love the cooler temps and fresh air in the upper altitudes of the mountains. The dying Hemlocks were evident below 3500'. Many different theories and fears concerning this epidemic of nature. Hemlocks hold and control the moisture that make the Smokey Mountains smokey. All I can do is leave no trace and allow God to work his power and allow man kind to stop blaming each other for nature's ability to heal or not heal itself. People keep asking, ""Where are you hiking next?"". I was struck by the fact that I fell in love with the Smokey Mountains on our about 1/9/1995. Jenny and I honeymooned here after we bought a  house and and had to cancel our cruise to the Caribbean.  She had 3 free nights at the Honeymoon Hideaway. It was so tacky! Heart shaped hot tub, water bed with mirrors on the upper canopy. I fell more in love with my wife during those days and continue to fall in love my wife every day since. During our honeymoon, we  had Indian Summer weather and the Gatlenberg area along with the park all to ourselves. We drove endlessly and day hiked several short treks, visiting waterfalls and key attractions. I visited the Smokey's as a kid, but don't remember much about it. I think I decided in 1995 that if Jenny and I had children, I would make them stewards of the outdoors. I have always loved camping, fishing, and the outdoors. I was a Scout as a kid and have so many fond memories of the simple life of a child roaming the woods, rivers, and valleys God's great outdoors. You see, I bought a book soon after our honeymoon about the Smokey Mountains. I started reading and when God loaned us Alex and Andrew, we started bringing them here. We have many stories about hikes, stays, and our family days of roaming this area. Yes, I end up here almost every summer for one reason or another. It was during one of these visits that someone told me about the Appalachian trail running over the top of the Smokey Mountains. For $20, you can see a more spectacular view from the mountain shelters than money can buy in the tourist attractions and accommodations from the surrounding towns. This is when I started reading about the Appalachian Trail and the physical condition it takes to hike the park. A strange series of events brought me to Scout Leadership where I mentored Alex, Andrew, and countless other scouts to follow the 12 points of the scout law as another good road map to life. The Carpenter's Book coupled with asking questions about Trustworthy. Loyal, Helpful, Friendly, Courteous, Kind, Obedient, Thrifty, Brave, Clean, and reverent will never steer a man wrong. As a Scout I attended countless camps and in the later years learned to back pack at Philmont and canoe at Northern Tier. All because God loaned us Alex and Andrew. As Scouting concluded and Alex and Andrew moved from childhood to manhood, I was still bitten with the outdoor bug. My four years of hiking has all been an effort to see the Smokey Mountains from the top. Witness first hand what the man described in 1995. Where I am going next? Well, I'm guessing it will be somewhere on a trail, river, lake, that will continue to expose me to the love and beauty God has loaned his children. It's our job to protect it and leave no trace so mine and other generations can continue to enjoy as we gradually leave our third dimension of instincts. It's our third dimension of instincts that keeps us alive. The desire for food, shelter, water, and personal pleasures. It's only when we move in God's fourth dimension that we move closer to what  he really want's for his children. Happy Trails!","Tri corner shelter
