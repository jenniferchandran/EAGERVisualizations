Franklin Bloomer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557125,"On Sunday, March 26, I will resume section-hiking the AT by doing a 125-mile segment from Harpers Ferry, WV, to Duncannon, PA. I have hiked all of the AT from Duncannon to Katahdin over a 12-year period. I am doing this particular segment because both ends of the hike can be reached from my home in SW CT via Amtrak (Harrisburg is served by Amtrak and is an Uber ride from Duncannon). There's snow on the ground where I live, wet, soggy snow, but conditions appear to be better along the Potomac.","Stamford, CT

Franklin Bloomer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558024,"I spent the night at The Town's Inn, a lovely hostelry owned and managed by a Ms. Townsend (Town's Inn/Townsend). It is located close to the train station and offers dinner and breakfast. Highly recommended. After breakfast I walked 1/2 mile up the hill to the ATC headquarters. Friendly greeting. Had my photograph taken along with a few other formalities (none burdensome). And I met Trail Dog, who was going my way. We decided to hike together. Trail Dog is a 66-year old North Carolinian who had to abandon an AT through hike a few years ago. He been unable to resume his hike sooner due other issues but was now fit and on his way. He was now a farmer after retiring from a technical career. Intelligent, he was good company. We picked up the AT nearby, after passing through the Storer College campus, passing John Brown's ""fort"" and crossing the much-photographed foot bridge over the Potomac River. It had rained during the night, and it was misty and wet underfoot but easy going for 3 miles along the C&O Canal towpath. The AT then turns inland and begins its ascent onto South Mountain, which is a long ridge oriented north-south. Half way up we reached a side trail to Weverton Cliffs. Other hikers were at the trail junction, and chatted with them -- they were locals out for a day hike. We opted to continue on, meeting other day hikers and dog walkers. About a mile after reaching the top of the ridge we came to the Ed Garvey Shelter. This is an impressive two-level structure, well located with a view to the east down the Potomac valley. The visibility had improved, so that we could enjoy it while having lunch. We continued north with little change of elevation until descending to Garthland State Park, which has a hand-operated water pump that brings up water that requires no treatment. We topped up. After the Park the AT ascends steeply to a side trail the descends steeply to the Crampton Gap Shelter. Its somewhat inconvenient location is presumably due to its proximity to an unreliable spring, which was working (but how were we to know?). The Shelter is an older structure but well maintained. A comfortable first night's destination.","Harpers Ferry, WV

Franklin Bloomer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558025,"We had a thunderstorm at around 4 am. A precourser of what was to come today. We got started around 8:30 with a climb of 0.3 mi to get from the Shelter back onto the trail. The rain began just as we started. A cloud had settled on the mountain which lent some atmosphere to the hiking. Would that only was cloudy. It rained, sometimes heavily into the early afternoon. We passed a tent set up close to the trail, its denizon(s) out of sight. And just one other hiker, a southbounder who inquired anxiously about the next water source (we recommended Gathland State Park). The rain had stopped by the time we reached the side trail for the Rocky Run Shelter. We took the 0.2 side trail to the Shelter and used it as a lunch stop. This is a newer structure, on two levels. Continuing another 2 miles, we reached the Dahlgren Campground, which a pre-season look and feel. The sun chose to make an appearance, and we realized we were just 0.3 mi from our day's destination. We hurried on. We were picked up by Trail Dog's former work colleague, Jennifer, who took us a short distance from her and her husband, Rob's beautifully situated home. Showers, home-cooked food and a bed with sheets, unexpected treats!","Crampton Gap Shelter
",Route Alt 40,"Mar 28, Tue",7
Franklin Bloomer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558069,"We needed a short day, I because my body was still complaining about the abrupt increase in activity (a problem we section hikers have), and Trail Dog because he needed to do some shopping. So we accepted Jennifer's and Rob's kind invitation to remain a second night. In the morning we did a short segment of trail near their home, southbound.
Rob drove us to the parking lot just north of the footbridge over Route I-70. This segment of the AT proved to be a relatively easy one. The high point was visiting the original Washington Monument, which was built in 1827, apparently from stones scattered by Mother Nature around the site. The monument of the same name in Washington, DC, came later. 
We finished at the same place where we had finished yesterday, Route Alt 40, where Rob picked us up. Later we all drove into Frederick where I bought a new pack cover (the inadequacy of my old one having been evident in yesterday's rain), and Trail Dog got the items he needed. Frederick is a lovely small city, with a well-preserved downtown and an old canal running through it. NyTrail Dog and I treated Jennifer and family to a nice meal before we returned home.","Route I-70
",Route Alt 40,"Mar 29, Wed",4.90
Franklin Bloomer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558771,"I have done most of my AT hiking solo, and I did so today. Our host for the past two nights, Rob, drove us back to where we had began yesterday's hike, but today we headed north. Trail Dog wanted to make some miles, so we parted company at the foot of a climb up from the I-70 overpass. We hoped to meet again, as we were headed the same way. Once on the ridge, the trail was relatively easy. Indeed, I encountered several trail runners. The highlight of this section is probably Annapolis Rock, an overlook that is much photographed because a photograph taken from a certain angle makes it appear that a person is standing on a projection over thin air. I opted to pass it by because I had no one to take that photo, it was well off the trail and also because of reports that the site was marred by graffiti. (I learned subsequently that the graffiti has been cleaned up.). There was another overlook, Black Rocks, not much farther along that I did stop at. I find that the miles go more easily when hiking solo if I listen to music, so I bring an iPod with me. Today it was Gounod's Faust, Puccini's Messa di Gloria (yes, Puccini) and Berlioz's Te Deum. The day ended with a climb over the crest of the ridge and a steep descent to Wolfsville Road. Robert Freeman met me there and shuttled me to his hostel, Trail of Hope Hostel, in Fayetteville, PA. I was met there by my friends Nancy and Eric, who driven from my home in CT, and Chris, who had driven from MI.","Route I-70 Overpass

Franklin Bloomer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558776,"This is the first of several days of slack packing, operating out of the Trail of Hope Hostel. 
Heavy rain was predicted for today, so we opted (out of sequential order) to do the shortest of the three sections we planned to hike over the next three days. As the saying goes, ""There is no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothing"". Nancy brought my Bean boots from home, and I used them. The day was a good test of my foul weather gear, and I'm happy to say that it performed well. 1-2"" of rain had been predicted, but the heaviest was during the car shuttle. With two cars, we left one at the finish point and continued to the start in one car.We crossed the Mason-Dixon Line shortly after we started hiking. The rain continued until around midday, but it had stopped by the time we stopped for lunch at a shelter. We stopped at a market on the way back to the hostel, and Nancy cooked us a spaghetti dinner in the hostel's kitchen.","Pen-Mar, MD
",Old Forge Picnic Area,"Mar 31, Fri",7.50
Franklin Bloomer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558783,"Nancy, Eric, Chris and I then circled back and did the northernmost section in MD. The highlights of the day were two crossings of streams swollen by yesterday's rain. Both were across streams that paralleled roads. Both were unexpected. Each of us made the crossing in our own way. At the first I took off my shoes and socks, rolled up my pants and walked across a relatively shallow, sandy-bottomed stretch of the the stream; at the second I got across without shedding any footgear. Nancy got across the first without shedding footgear but went in over her boots at the second. Needless to say, the water was cold. Numerous other hikers were at both crossings, finding their ways across. Lots of good humor and not a few laughs. The last portion of the section took us over and then steeply down a jumble of rocks. With the delay crossing the streams, it was a long day.","Wolfsville Road

Franklin Bloomer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558806,"Chris was unable to hike with us today because he had aggravated a problem with his knee. Nancy opted to join us where Route 933 crosses the AT, shortening her hike to about 4-1/2 miles. So it was just Eric and myself as we started from the Old Forge Recreation Area. The hike began with a steep uphill but was relatively easy once we reached the top. That continued after Nancy joined us until the trail climbed up to the crest of the ridge we had been paralleling. Until that point, we were away from the slope of the ridge, which was a jumble of rocks. Now we were hiking through the jumble, which was quite beautiful but not easy going. And not always easy to follow. The trail then descended to the easier terrain on the flank of the ridge and continued down to Route 30 where we had left Eric's car. Then back to the hostel. We were delighted to find Trail Dog there. Eric and Nancy made a quick getaway for their long drive back to CT.","Old Forge Picnic Area
","Route 30, Fayetteville, PA","Apr 02, Sun",10.60
Franklin Bloomer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558906,"Chris stayed the night at the hostel and drove Trail Dog and me to where the AT crosses Shippenburg Road. He then continued back home in MI. The trail was not difficult, particularly at the start. The weather was pleasant, and this may have brought hikers out. In any event, we began seeing other hikers within a quarter of a mile from where we started and continued seeing them all day. The highlight of the day, however, was Quarry Gap Shelter, which we reached about 8-1/2 miles from our start. This shelter is a class act. It consists of two shelter structures connected by a roof covering an area for a picnic table, all topped by a cupola. In addition to the usual privy and tent pads, the site has a roofed bear box, a second covered picnic table, a swing and a sun dial that today told the correct time. It was a nice place to linger, and while we were there we were joined by Men in Black, with whom Trail Dog had shared a hostel room back in Harpers Ferry, Mike, who was on his way to our hostel, and Blissful. Shortly after we reached Route 30, Robert appeared and drove me back to the hostel. Trail Dog proceeded on foot to a nearby restaurant. A satisfying day.","Shippenburg Road
","Route 30, Fayetteville, PA","Apr 03, Mon",11.30
Franklin Bloomer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558914,"Trail Dog and I continued together. Robert shuttled us to the same point where we had started yesterday, but today we hiked north. It was a sunny, warm day, and the hiking was easy. In just over a mile we reached the current midpoint of the AT, which is on the curiously named Dead Woman's Hollow Road, marked by a modest, amendable and movable sign. About four miles later we reached a former midpoint marked by a more elaborate sign. Apparently there is a third midpoint marker at the AT's original midpoint somewhere north of here. The day ended at Pine Grove Furnace State Park, site of a well-known hostel called the Ironmasters Mansion. Unfortunately for us, it is closed on Tuesdays; as an AYH hostel, it closes at 9 am each morning, no problem for hikers, but then doesn't open again until 5 pm, which can be a problem. It is an impressive building and happily has a well-appointed porch where we waited for Robert to pick us up and bring us back to the hostel.","Shippenburg Toad

Franklin Bloomer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558924,"Robert shuttled Trail Dog and me back to yesterday's finish point, and we began the hike with a stroll on paved pathways through the park. The AT then left the park and followed disused roads for a time. Farther on we hiked on a disused rail bed, alongside the tracks of an active short line railroad. We crossed two busy highways and ended the day with a steep climb up an aptly-named Rocky Ridge which is topped by two rock mazes. Again Robert picked us up for what was now a long drive back to the hostel. We expect this will our last night here. I recommend it.","Pine Grove Furnace State Park
",Whiskey Spring Road,"Apr 05, Wed",13.20
Franklin Bloomer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559032,"Today's weather may have been the worst I've hiked in, at least for a full day. The rain began with a thunderstorm at 4:30 am and continued after we got on the trail at about 9 until after we got off around 4:45. We later learned that the area received 1.15"" of rain today. Robert shuttled Trail Dog and me back to Whiskey Springs Road and (so we could slack pack) then continued to our destination, where he left the contents of our packs which we had placed in two black plastic garbage bags. We trusted Robert to deliver the bags, but both of us had some anxiety until we collected them when we checked in. Not surprisingly, we met few other hikers today. Two northbound hikers we had met the day before were just crossing the road as we began, and we saw Blissful several times and a couple of trail runners.Atop Center Point Knob, after the last climb before Boiling Springs, we saw the third and oldest midpoint markers. It was a windy place, and we didn't linger. The highlight of the day was Boiling Springs. We visited the ATC regional office, an outfitter (where I bought some gloves more suitable for the conditions), had a warm and comfortable lunch at the excellent Cafe 101 and mailed some items home.Then back to the trail. We now were in the Cumberland Valley, relatively level terrain through farm country. The trail crosses Route 11 on a dedicated overpass, requiring a scramble down to the road. A short walk brought us to a Super 8 Motel, where we dried out and warmed up.","Whiskey Spring Road
","Route 11, Carlisle, PA","Apr 06, Thu",14
Franklin Bloomer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559143,"The Super 8 motel had a couple of useful amenities that we took advantage of -- a coin-operated clothes dryer and breakfast (pretty basic). After a walk down Route 11, a section of highway largely devoted to the trucking industry, we were back on the AT at about 9 am. The trail was still wet from yesterday's rain. After a couple of miles, we reached Conodoguinet Creek, the main river that drains this part of the Cumberland Valley. It was swollen from the rain, muddy, overflowing its banks and carrying tree branches along. We crossed it on a road bridge and then followed it to the apex of a deep meander. We then started the 800' climb over Blue Mountain. As the trail got steeper towards the top, it required some impressive stone work, a wall supporting the treadway as it traversed the steep slope and then a bench built of stone at a place with a particularly good view. At the top a side trail led to the Darlington Shelter, where we had lunch and made final arrangements by telephone for our shuttle into town.Also on top we experienced snow, not a lot but the real thing. It snowed harder as we neared our pickup place on Route 850. No accumulation, of course, because the ground was warm. Our shuttle provider, Trail Angel Mary, was waiting when we reached the road. She drove us to the iconic Doyle Hotel, which has most certainly seen better days but which is an AT institution.","Route 11, Carlisle, PA
",Route 850,"Apr 07, Fri",8.60
Franklin Bloomer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559301,"Trail Angel Mary collected Trail Dog and me on front of the Doyle Hotel and shuttled us back to yesterday's finish point. It was a cool (40 degrees), cloudless day -- perfect hiking weather. 
After yesterday's hike with full packs, we once again carried only what we needed for the day. The rest of my stuff was cached in Trail Dog's room at the Doyle. 
The day's hike ascended Cove Mountain, which (oddly for PA) is a ridge in the shape of a V. Shortly after the steep ascent reaches the top of the ridge, the AWOL guide warns the the trail is ""very rocky"". It certainly is rocky, but by PA standards didn't seem as bad as sections of the AT in PA that I hiked last year. 
The highlight of the day was Hawk Rock, which afforded a great view of the flooded Susquehanna River and Duncannon. For the first time, we saw other hikers, mostly young people dressed for much warmer conditions than we had experienced all day. It was a Saturday, and there were a lot of them. 
The AT goes through Duncannon and led us directly to the Doyle Hotel. I repacked my gear into my backpack and bid farewell to Trail Dog. I hope to see him again when he reaches the sections of the AT nearest to my home. I took an Uber to the Harrisburg Amtrak station for the train ride home. 
Reaching the Doyle connected this hike with the sections of the AT I had done previously, with the result that I have now done all of the AT from Katahdin to Harpers Ferry, which is over half the trail. Will I do more? Time will tell.","Route 850
",Duncannon,"Apr 08, Sat",9.10
Franklin Bloomer,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563342,"When I reached Duncannon, I had finished the section of the trail I had set out to do this Spring, and I parted company with Trail Dog, with whom I had hiked for about 10 days.  He continued north on the AT, and I returned home to southwestern CT.  We planned that he would let me know when he was where the AT is near my home, and I would play trail angel by bringing him home where he could shower, do laundry, shop and sleep indoors.  I picked him up today just north of the Fingerboard Shelter in the Sterling Forest, a day's hike south of Bear Mountain.  He had a cautionary (but somewhat amusing) tale to tell.  As he was packing up to hike out to the road where I would meet him, he took his food bag down from the bear pole where he had put it overnight and put it on a large stone near the shelter.  He then started assembling his gear and stowing it in his pack.  He heard a noise nearby and looked around to find that a black bear had the food bag in its mouth.  Trail Dog shouted at the bear, demanding that it drop the food bag, and began chasing after it.  Bears are very fast runners, and it soon occurred to Trail Dog that he wasn't going to overpower the bear even if he somehow did catch up with it.  So it was just as well that he was being picked up, because he now had no food!  The drive to my home took us over the Tappen Zee Bridge, next to a new bridge that is under construction -- an impressive bit of civil engineering.  I happened to have tickets to the Metropolitan Opera that evening, and we were able to get another ticket for Trail Dog, so his day began with an encounter with a bear and ended with an opera performance in New York City.  Life's rich pattern.",,View Entry,"May 04, Thu",0
