Gypsy J,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549565,"It is about 5 months prior to my start date. I started this journal to make it feel real. I will be 65 in 1 week. When I was in my 40's I did a lot of backpacking and hiking in Oregon and Washington. Twenty years have gone by so fast but my love of the outdoors has not diminished, if anything it has increased. I am in good health and feel there is no time like the present. I have been hiking nearly every weekend for the past 6 months. I plan on doing some backpacks over the next couple of months. I can do this and will do this.I'm heading to OK next week to backpack with my brother so it should be a good test for my equipment.","

Gypsy J,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550869,"Went on a prep hike with a full pack 27.6lbs Dupont Park NC. This was a 7 mile hike in beautiful Dupont. The trail is gradual up and down easy hike with my Hiking club EZ Hikers. Not always easy. I usually hike with them every week end and have decided that I will carry my full pack every time. This a good test for my shoes and getting used to the weight. My pack felt great and did not have any issues. I was wearing my Hoka trail runners for shoes and they did great, love them. On Sunday we hiked in the Pisgah Forest an easy 6 mile no Problem with the pack, but I was testing my Hokda waterproof boots and found a problem, They gave me a blister (NOT GOOD). It was a short hike, but when I took the boots off they were wet inside from sweat. These will not work for the AT. I took them back to REI and traded them in for another pair of trail runners, but decided on Salomon speed cross. I'll test them on the next hike. There are 146 days before I leave on my extraordinary journey, but who's counting.","

I think it stinks that all these cool things that technology is bringing us at the speed of light does not come with instructions for those that are techy illiterate. Even the instructions if you get them seem to be in another language. Anyway I usually find someone that is willing to help me, so if you are someone that is willing to share how to's in a simpler language to a kind older lady I thank you in advance.I'm looking to find a nice hike this weekend somewhere on the AT.

Gypsy J,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551059,"Saturday 10/29/16 arrived at Max Patch and started trail at 11am. It was the most perfect weekend. It was in the low 70's super blue skies, fantastic. A great day for a hike. It started with a gradual climb and meandered through the woods. The trail was covered in leaves and you had to be careful where you stepped, but it was beautiful. Every time I saw one of those white blazes I was absolutely giddy. The trail headed down gradually and I thought would it not be the cats meow if the whole trail was like this, but of course it isn't! What goes down definitely goes up and vise versa! Until you get to Lemon Gap the trail is actually fun and then the not so fun begins. Not so say that it is extreme it isn't, it is only a 300 ft climb and it's all relevant. You cross several creeks and oh by the way if your low on water get some from one of the creeks your crossing because there wasn't any at Walnut. Just an fyi. I was pretty much alone most of the hike. I ran into a couple of guys that were hiking to Walnut at Roaring Fork Shelter. I met them again at Lemon Gap and let them pass me as they were moving much faster. The guys took the shelter because I wanted to get more practice setting up my tent. I'm must say I am not a fan of this tent the more I play with it. I found one on line that I think will work much better. It's called a Niak by Hilleberg. It weighs 1lb 8oz and is super easy to set up. $$$ are the downside, but I'm thinking it will be worth it. Everything else was fine. It went down to the 40's and I was warm, maybe even a little too much. Went to bed early and did not sleep well. Had a little critter that kept walking on my plastic ground cover and drove me nuts. Woke up about 6:30 and started taking things down and packing up. Fixed a cup of Starbucks instant (love that stuff)had a breakfast meal to go, went to the privy and away I went, back to where I started. Started down hill and then up and up I went. Took me 5 hours to go the 7.4 miles. Certainly no record breaker! Check out the photos they are beautiful.Happy Trails, Gypsy J","Max Patch Rd SR 1182

Gypsy J,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551244,"Went on a pretty hike with full pack of what I will be carrying on the AT. There will be some changes in the food prep and packaging, but pretty much what I plan to take. I plan on carrying my pack on every hike I go on till I start my journey.Unless we get a lot of snow and rain this winter it will be very dry walk. Will need to carry more water than normal. Since my last entry I have changed out some gear. I went with a Zpack duplex tent, a down quilt and a therma a rest xlite pad. Just by doing this I reduced my weight almost 2lbs. I also traded the solamon trail runners for Lowa Boots. The boots are heavier, but way more stable and they didn't cause any pain in my feet. My feet are still recovering from the trail runners, blister and bruised toes and my ribs are still sore from the fall I took on the last hike. Sometimes no matter how careful you are poop still happens that is why they call them accidents.","

Gypsy J,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551270,"This hike was short but challenging. There was a lot of rock and roots along the way. There really wasn't any views to speak of. The trail is actually pretty but I was running a new app on my phone and didn't know if switching to camera mode would stop it so I didn't take any photos. Next time I will know that it will still work. It felt good on the hike, there wasn't any problems. My boots are great and worked very well on the terrain. Happy Trails, Gypsy J","pre hike

The fires are surrounding me, but not close to me. The smoke is thick and is making it hard to breathe outside.

Unfortunately the smoke also effected that area as well. It looks like until these fires are put out hiking is on the back burner. I plan to continue my prepping by focusing on the mental aspect.

Gypsy J,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/551747,"Hello Family and Friends,Myself and two other wanna be thru hikers went on a weekend backpack on the AT approach trail. It was supposed to be cold and we wanted to test our gear to make sure we had what we needed to be comfortable.(haha)I can really only speak for myself at this point on and I was fine with the hike towards Springer, but wasn't sure we would make it to Springer with the late start, somewhere between 9:30 and 10:30am. The wind was really gusting and the temp was dropping pretty quick. We all decided that with the weather getting worse we needed to set up at the first shelter, which was Black Gap. It was probably around 5pm and we started setting up. My ZPack Duplex went up pretty quick, sort of. I blew my pad up (wish it was self inflating)got my sleeping bag out, my luci light(worked like a charm)stuck my water in my bag along with my phone. Wasn't really hungry, but I sure wanted a cup of coffee! So I made coffee and later I forced myself to eat some ramen noodles with vegies(would have preferred the noodles alone). By this time the wind is picking up and the temps are dropping. I hung my bag up with the bear cables. The three of us got into one tent and chatted for a little while and I decided to go to my own tent and get into my fleece. It was probably around 7 by this time. The wind was really loud sounded like a hurricane out there blowing and it was really cold somewhere in the mid 20's. The moon was bright and seemed so bright in my ZPack. I put my eye cover on and put ear plugs in, but all I did was toss an turn until one of the stakes pulled up and my tent collapsed.(yippee)I managed to get it staked in again and it stayed up the rest of the night. I know this because I did not get any sleep. I could not wait till morning light so I could get up and get moving. I wanted a cup of coffee and try to get warm. There was a couple of lessons I learned. 1) put my boots in the sleeping bag so they don't freeze. 2)Buy a new sleep sack (mine sucked)3) Get glove liners(my hands were frozen)4) Get the Benadryl out of the pack before you hang it up. All in all I found the hike informative and enjoyable. My friends had similar experiences except the one in the hammock. She moved into the tent after a few hours it was way to windy. Can't wait to get on the trail!Happy Trails, Gypsy J","Amicalola Falls

Gypsy J,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552359,"Hello Friends and Family,Went for a short but challenging Hike today. Even though it was a short hike it was quite steep and gave me a workout. It was lovely and so nice to see water flowing. The sky was blue it was around 32 degrees, perfect hiking weather. I wore my Hoka trail runners and they did great. I wanted to see if my feet stayed warm in them while hiking in the cold. I am still not sure if I want to wear trail runners or boots. I am leaning towards the boots in the beginning because they are waterproof, very stable and best of all they are comfy! So will see. I will be hiking a longer trail tomorrow, but it is not a steep one. Happy Trails, Gypsy J",,Parking lot,"Dec 10, Sat",5
Gypsy J,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552383,"Today was a really nice hike that was mostly level with some gradual climbing. There was a creek that ran alongside for awhile. The path was wide for most of the time some of it on gravel road. I had on my brand new Hoka trail runners to start breaking them in. They felt great. That is the one thing that I really like about Hoka. They feel good from the first time I put them on.Jeff C. if you read this entry I want to thank you for your input on boots versus trail runners. I didn't really think of when the boots get wet the time it would take to dry and the fact that they would freeze. My fear is the trail runners will not be as stabile and with all the rocks it would be easy to roll my ankle. Being an older women our bones are more brittle and I really need to take all precautions I can. That being said I really do like the trail runners!We'll see. Happy Trails, Gypsy J","Parking lot

This hike was in North Florida southwest of Tallahassee. I don't remember the park name sorry! I was with my cousins. It runs along the Apalachicola River which is really pretty. We had warnings that we should not swim because there were alligators. We did not see any gators, but since I am from Florida that was ok because I have seen more than my share. We also didn't see any snakes, that did not hurt my feelings. I like them even less! It was a pretty hike and I was glad we went!","

There was a tois n of deer tracks but only caught one glimpse of the back end of one. I was surprised that I didn't see anyone else out hiking. It was a beautiful day. I went there two days in a row plus I walked around her neighborhood. I am heading home on Saturday with a couple of pit stops. One is to visit a friend and the other is to stop at Springer Mtn. to make sure I know my way when I get ready to start. It is finally fast approaching and I can't wait.

Gypsy J,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553822,"Went to Mississippi to spend time with my daughter and work on mail drops that she will be taking care of. My daughter is awesome and I am so grateful for her participation even though she is really busy with her own life. While visiting I had the opportunity to hike in Flint Creek. A very pretty park with man made lakes and up and down hills, a nature trail. I hiked 6 miles round trip and it felt great. I went back the next day and hiked again taking a different trail but hiking the same distance. I have a little over a month to go before I start so I want to prepare my mind and body as best I can. Since preparing also includes trying all the different foods that I plan on eating on the trail I was shocked to see that I gained an additional 7 pounds. Crap!! You don't think about the calories that your taking in but not burning off. At least I didn't. Now I have even more weight to drag around! Heading back to NC Saturday making a pit stop at a friends place and then heading to Springer Mtn. to make sure I can find my way when I hit the trail. Looking forward to seeing everyone!

Gypsy J,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554225,"SNAKES.......EW!!!!Ok some of my concerns or fears however you want to look at it: 1.Bears not so much because they will normally go about their way unless they feel threatened or they have cubs and you surprise them.2.Tripping or falling with injuries. I am not the most coordinated person so this is a concern. 3. Not being able to get over some of the boulders further up the trail. Yep you got it I'm short! I'm hoping that there will be a taller person around that won't mind giving me a little help.4. Lyme disease is prevalent on the trail and a genuine concern. I haven't figured out how you can check over your whole body even with a mirror. Any suggestions other than prepping clothes and gear would gladly like to hear.5. SNAKES I only like to see snakes behind a glass. I wish them no harm and would never like to harm them, but ew. I stepped on a baby snake while hiking on the Blue Ridge Parkway. First my eyes saw it, then 1 or 2 seconds later my brain registered what it was. I felt it slither under my foot, but before I could get my camera out it was gone! WHAT if it was a copperhead or a rattlesnake. I might not be so lucky next time and next time it might not be a baby. I was LOOKING really I was. I saw it but my foot still stepped on it.

Gypsy J,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554391,"Today was my 9th straight day of hiking. I have been averaging 6 miles. This is my prep for the AT. My AT hike is now only 31 days out. On my hike today on the Blue Ridge Parkway which is closed to traffic. I go there everyday Monday thru Friday and rarely see anyone, and today was no exception. So I decided that this would be a great time to practice using my go girl. For those of you who are not familiar with this apparatus it enables women to pee while standing up. I have practiced using at home quite a bit, but never out hiking. I was always afraid I would pee all over myself and have to go home and change clothes. On the AT this will not be an option so I really need practical practice. I have it in a convenient place on my pack so I took it out dropped my drawers halfway down my butt to allow access to position it where the pee will come out and prayed that it came out the end and not back down my leg and pants. Had to drip dry because I forgot to grab my towel that I will be using instead of paper. That meant I had to drip dry. I found it a little awkward, but felt it was a success! I feel I need a lot more practice to get really comfortable. I certainly would not want to attempt this if I had to go really bad without lots more practice. I'll keep trying to perfect. The trail will teach me.","Blue Ridge Parkway
