Jayhawk ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555047,"The Appalachian Trail, commonly referred to as the AT, starts on the summit of Springer Mountain in Georgia and ends on top of Mount Katahdin in Maine. The distance from Springer to Katahdin is approximately 2,189 miles. The trail passes through fourteen states. The mountains of Georgia and North Carolina are steep and densely wooded. The Great Smokey Mountains National Park has more varieties of trees than are in all of Europe. One quarter of the total AT trail is in Virginia. By the middle of Virginia, hikers have walked off the enthusiasm they had at the start of their journey, and the end is still nowhere in sight. West Virginia is the emotional halfway point near Harpers Ferry. The trail clips through Civil War battlefields in western Maryland. Pennsylvania and New Jersey are infamous for rocks. The AT in New York finds a corridor of woods between the mainland and Long Island. Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Vermont lull you with their beauty before you reach New Hampshire. The White Mountain National Forest in New Hampshire is one of the most scenic and hazardous sections of the trail. Maine welcomes you with a trek through the 100 Mile Wilderness before you finish with the longest ascent on the AT, a five mile climb to the summit of Mount Katahdin. There are many types of hikers on the AT. Day hikers are people who enjoy the trail, but return to their homes at night. Section hikers may decide to hike a portion of the trail for several days or weeks at a time. Thru hikers are attempting to hike the entire trail in one hiking season. Thru hikers normally take between 5 to 7 months to complete the trail. Northbounders (NOBO) normally start in Georgia in early spring and end in Maine in early fall. Southbounders (SOBO) start in Maine and head south to Georgia. SOBO hikers normally start in June after the snow melts in Maine and reach Georgia in late fall. Approximately 85% of all thru hikers start in Georgia and follow the warming temps as they head north.",,View Entry,"Feb 23, Thu",0
Jayhawk ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555048,"Can you get lost? Every hundred feet or so a tree or rock will be painted with a vertical bar of white, a 'white blaze', six inches tall and two inches wide, marking the AT. It is not common for a hiker to get lost. A typical thru hiker takes six months with an average of twelve miles walked per day. Depending on local terrain and physical strength, some hikers are able to hike 20+ miles in a day. A thru hike is an extended nomadic camping trip. Follow the path through the woods all day. Stop, set up camp, eat, and sleep. Get up, pack your things, and start walking again. You carry all your essentials in your backpack. If you need it, you have to carry it. Tent, sleeping bag, your stove, your food and water. AT backpackers carry enough food to last three to five days. The food needs to be lightweight and durable. Cooking is normally limited to adding boiling water to make the food edible. Drinking water comes primarily from streams along the trail. Most hikers will treat their water chemically or with a filter. Opportunities to eat real food come when the trail crosses a road within walking or hitching distance of a town. Hikers eat, clean up, and restock their packs during these town visits. Hostels or local hotels offer the chance to rest and recuperate. The exertion of carrying a pack up and down mountains day after day is incredibly fatiguing. You get hungry, you get rained on, your feet blister, and your legs ache. However, the difficulty of the endeavor is also part of the appeal.",,View Entry,"Feb 23, Thu",0
Jayhawk ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555280,"My name is David Fox. I live in the north suburbs of Atlanta, within 65 miles of Springer Mountain. My trail name will be Jayhawk. For those readers who don't understand the trail name custom, hikers take on a trail name to symbolize the new lifestyle they will be embracing throughout the hike. Hiking the AT was not on my bucket list. I don't even have a bucket list. In fact, even though I grew up in nearby Chattanooga, I never knew much about the trail and it's history. I have always enjoyed physical challenges. Especially those that involve endurance. In my younger days, when I had younger and healthier knees, I enjoyed running. Ran numerous 10K and half marathon races. Last summer a friend asked if I wanted to join him and a friend and ride bikes on a nearby bike trail. After a couple of rides, I found that I really enjoyed it. But typical for me, I found myself wanting to push the envelope with longer and longer distances. Just to see if this old man could do it! Before long, I had signed up for a couple of 100 mile Century bike rides and had a great time. In fact, my plan was join a group and ride across Georgia (about 300 miles) this coming June. You are probably thinking, what does all this have to do with hiking the AT?? Well, a neighborhood friend starting talking about the AT about a year ago. My first reaction was why would anyone want to do that? Someone would have to be crazy! Six months, no way! Sleeping on the ground every night, ridiculous idea! Getting eaten by bears, no thanks!! However, when I started reading about the physical and mental challenge of completing a thru hike, I found myself getting into that 'I think I can do this' frame of mind. So, while it seems like a crazy idea to even consider this, I guess I'm just enough crazy to start the journey. There is so much information available online about the actual hike, the physical commitment, the backpacking gear, the mental challenge, that it will suck you in like a galactic black hole. The more you read and learn, the more you desire to learn even more!",,"Sooo, Tell Me Again Why You Are Doing This??","Feb 27, Mon",0
Jayhawk ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555281,"One of the first questions people ask when you mention that you are going to attempt an AT thru hike is how in the world did this idea come about? I'm not running from anything. I'm not running toward something. I'm not even seeking some life changing revelation. At 65 years old, I'm probably past all that. I'm sure I will learn new things about myself and the world we all share. All of my limited strengths and many weaknesses will be exposed on an endeavor such as this. Someone wrote that it is exciting to know that you will face obstacles and challenges that will rely on just yourself to overcome. It's your chance to not only be strong, but feel strong. Nothing to help you but your own hands and your own head. The other question is won't you be lonely? Of course, I will miss family and friends, but you really aren't alone on the trail. You will meet and hike with many interesting people. I will have a hiking partner, trail name BoopDog, that will be a familiar face and friend. There is a world of difference between loneliness and solitude. Loneliness is marked by a sense of isolation. Solitude is the state of being alone without being lonely. During the hike, there will be many times available for solitude which can be used for reflection and self awareness. Experiencing the full beauty of nature requires some degree of solitude.",,"Calm Down Friends and Family, I'm Okay","Feb 27, Mon",0
Jayhawk ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555311,"I think the biggest learning curve for me as I prepare to hike are the many options on backpacking gear. My experience with camping equipment was limited to Boy Scout trips with my grandson which included gear primarily from Walmart and Costco. Weight of gear was not an issue since we simply walked our gear to the campsite from a nearby parking lot. I was in for a big surprise when I started researching all the latest equipment. I'm happy with my choices. I have listed the big ticket items on my gear list. My base weight should come in around 18 pounds, which I feel is good for me. My full pack with water and 5 day food supply will be close to 30 pounds. I owe a world of thanks to REI. They not only treated me with patience answering all my stupid questions, the people who work there are always very professional. I attended an AT Thru Hike Seminar at REI back in December and that was a great chance to ask questions and learn more from actual thru hikers. A special shout out needs to go to ULA. I really like their backpacks, and their customer service is exceptional. I originally went with the ULA Ohm 2.0 pack. Great pack, but when I got to the shake down overnight trips and the fully loaded pack stage, I found that it was a little too small for my needs. Called ULA up and they happily exchanged my ULA Ohm for a ULA Circuit. Great people who work there. I also had great experiences with the Enlightened Equipment company. I purchased the Revelation Quilt from them, and again, customer service was outstanding. Of course, I owe a debt of gratitude to past and present AT hikers. Information they post in journals and on YouTube are invaluable. I guess I should also thank Amazon Prime and FedEx. If Amazon has a platinum level for recent purchases, I'm sure I would qualify!",,Huge Learning Curve on Gear,"Feb 28, Tue",0
Jayhawk ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555446,"If all goes as planned, I should be on Springer Mountain one week from today. I received my new ULA Circuit backpack yesterday. I exchanged my ULA Ohm for more room that the ULA Circuit offered. I loaded up the pack last night and everything fit great. Still looking at 18 pound base weight. 30 pound fully loaded. Bought some food supplies for the first part of the hike. Just initially carrying 3 days food since I can resupply at Neels Gap. Getting ready to do a training hike after lunch to test out the new pack. I'm lucky to live in Georgia where I can easily find good hills and rocky terrain to train. I'm thinking of not hiking after next Monday so that I have rested legs to start the AT on Thursday. Seven days until the journey begins.....",,One Week to Go!,"Mar 02, Thu",0
Jayhawk ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555908,No more gear selection! No more training hikes! Tomorrow we start our journey!! Can't believe it's finally here. Weather should be perfect. Sunny skies with highs near 70. Woo Hoo! My next journal entry will be from the AT!,,Tomorrow is the Day!,"Mar 08, Wed",0
Jayhawk ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556176,"Drove to Amicalola Falls State Park to check in at visitor center. Weather was perfect. Sunny skies and temps in the 60's. From there took logging road to Springer Mountain parking lot. You have to hike about a mile south to the top of Springer to get to the official start of the AT. Took the obligatory photos and then headed north. The hike up and down Springer is very rocky, but not too steep. The rest of the days hike was relatively easy. Rolling hills without many rocks. Crossed several streams. At mile 5.2 stopped at Long Creek Falls. Beautiful waterfall. We filtered water to refill our water bottles. Reached campsite about 4 pm. Great campsite with nearby stream. Set up tent, refilled water for cooking, and talked with some other hikers. Cooked Knorrs pasta and added chicken from a sealed pouch. Tasted great after a long day. Darkness came around 7 and went to bed with the sound of a nearby owl seemingly welcoming us to the back country. All in all, a great first day.","Springer Mountain
",Hawk Mountain Campsite,"Mar 09, Thu",7.40
Jayhawk ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556180,"Strong thunderstorm came in around 3 am. Heavy rain, strong winds, and frequent lightening. Tent stayed dry, but ground was very muddy to start packing up. Lesson learned. Pick a good campsite, because you don't know how the weather can change during the night. Hike today was very challenging. Much tougher than day 1. Weather was much cooler and the wind was blowing over 40 mph all day, with gusts over 50 mph. It's amazing the sound you hear as the wind roars across the mountains. I had read that Sassafras Mountain was difficult, and it didn't disappoint. Very steep with rocks. Had to stop several times on the way up to catch my breath. After reaching top, began a steep descent down to Coopers Gap. More up and downs followed and felt the trail was testing our abilities. I have trained well prior to this hike, but found out today that this is very tough. Got to campsite around 3 pm, but all the good tent sites were taken. Finally found a spot that was sloping, but it will have to do. Very hard to set up tent in strong wind. Had to ask another hiker to help hold the tent so I could stake it down. Cooked dinner and temp was dropping quickly. Hard to believe I'm in my sleeping bag at 6:30 pm, but it's the only way to stay warm. I now know why they call it hiker midnight once darkness comes. Hoping for a better weather day tomorrow.","Hawk Mountain Campsite
",Gooch Mountain Shelter,"Mar 10, Fri",8.40
Jayhawk ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556181,"Very cold night. Even though I have a 20 degree sleeping bag, I woke up during the night feeling cold. Layered up in my down jacket, stocking cap, and gloves. Still was cold. Added to that, kept waking up at the bottom of the tent. Sleeping on a slope means you constantly slide down. Another lesson learned. Find a level tent site. Packed up and was on the trail at 8:30 am. Hiking was not as challenging as yesterday, but the wind was still strong. Sun was out early, but you could see clouds moving in and temps dropping instead of warming up. Climbed Ramrock Mountain and stopped at a fabulous overlook. Several other hikers were there resting. Trail began descent down to Woody Gap. We were surprised to see a paved road. First paved road crossing in 3 days. There was a parking lot with several cars. Looking across the road, we saw a group of people around a campfire. We were about to experience our first trail magic. A group of locals had set up a table and were offering hot chocolste, bread, crackers, and fruit to the hikers. What a blessing. They are called trail angels and people do this just to help hungry and cold hikers. Food never tasted so good. And a warm drink after 3 cold days was very welcome. Thanked them for their generosity. They warned us that snow was moving in this afternnon and night temps would be getting down in the teens. Knowing that our gear would not keep us warm in those temps, we decided to find shelter. Ken called his wife and she could be there in about 2 hours. It started sleeting and we were concerned that she might not be able to drive up the mountain highway. We hitch hiked to Dahlonega and found a great pizza restaurant. Waited on Pam and ate hot pizza. We have learned that even with good training and good gear, the trail and weather are in control. It tests and challenges you each day. Sometimes you have to use your best judgement and not put yourself in danger. We will return. The trail won't go anywhere.","Gooch Mountain Shelter
",Woody Gap,"Mar 11, Sat",4.80
Jayhawk ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557727,"Our trail group got back together and hiked the Woody Gap to Neels Gap section last Monday. Great day to hike. Blood Mountain is the highest mountain on the AT trail in Georgia. The ascent wasn't as hard as we expected, but the 2.6 mile descent was very tough. Rocky trail with very steep declines. Woody Gap was the location we left the trail when the weather turned cold and snowy the previous week. When we got back to our homes near Atlanta, BoopDog and I went to see our doctors to check out his hand injury and my continuing chest congestion. BoopDog found out that the thorn puncture on his hand had become infected and the bacteria was infecting his lymph system. Could have developed a serious blood infection if it had been left untreated. My doctor visit led to a bronchitis diagnosis. And all along I thought hiking was a healthy activity! I guess there was a reason for us to get off the trail when we did, we just didn't understand it at the time. Both of us were given antibiotics and were told not to hike for 10 days. So, we will start again from Neels Gap this Tuesday. Hoping for better weather and healthier bodies on this renewed journey.","Woody Gap

Experienced Trail Magic at Tensnatee Gap. Church group had salty snacks, soda, and my favorite PayDay candy bar. Such a good surprise. You meet great folks everyday on the trail. The only tough climb was Wildcat Mountain, right past Tensnatee Gap. But I had a sugar high from a real Coke and a PayDay bar, so I powered right through it. LOL!","Neels Gap
",Low Gap Shelter,"Mar 28, Tue",11.40
Jayhawk ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558064,"Had a good nights sleep in tent last night. Woke up at daylight and was on the trail by 8:10. Wasn't able to refill water at campsite. Stream was reportly polluted with norovirus. Didn't take a chance, so waited to get water from a mountain stream about 1/2 mile from campsite. Made good progress hiking. Already had hiked 8 miles by lunchtime. Ate lunch at Blue Mountain shelter. Beautiful views from the shelter. Trail wasn't too difficult, but extremely rocky. I was really feeling tired before getting something to eat. After a good lunch, energy returned and felt stronger the rest of the day. When we got to Unicoi Gap, Trail Magic was waiting at the road crossing. A group who only comes out one day a year, and today was the day. How cool is that timing!! I headed straight for the bananas and oranges. Funny how you crave certain things when you can't easily have them. The AT continues to challenge me. Every time you think you are getting stronger, the trail suddenly changes either with steep inclines or steep declines. Both can be very tiresome. And when you think you can make some good time, the trail suddenly becomes very rocky and that slows you way down. The trail constantly reminds you who is in control.","Low Gap Shelter
",Unicoi Gap,"Mar 29, Wed",9
Jayhawk ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558170,"I got a shuttle from Hiawassee to Unicoi Gap. Was on the trail by 9:20 am. As usual when you leave a Gap, you head straight back up another Mountain. Rocky Mountain got my blood flowing quickly with a 1,000 foot climb in the first mile. That was followed by a 900 foot descent into Indian Grave Gap. And yes, almost all gaps between mountains have names. Most with an Indian heritage. I wanted to eat lunch on the top of Tray Mountain, so it was up another 1,300 feet to the top. Needless to say, I was one hungry hiker by lunchtime. It was all worth it with great views from the top. I am camping at Deep Gap shelter. People are saying bad storms are coming through tonight. I am ready with my tent on level ground and securely staked down. That only leaves me with a ""nero"" day tomorrow before I reach the Top of Georgia Hostel. A nero is a short hike day where you get to your destination, hopefully by lunch. That will allow me to resupply food and maybe even get a shower. A ""zero"" day is where you don't hike at all. You resupply, shower, do laundry, and eat all the food in sight!! Those are usually planned near a town with local restaurants. I plan to take a zero day next Wednesday in Franklin, North Carolina.","Unicoi Gap

Lots of wind and rain during the night. Tent held up well and I stayed dry. So far, all the bad storms I have encountered have happened at night. Eventually, my luck will run out and I will be hiking in rain. All part of the journey. The Top of Georgia hostel is very nice and the employees are super friendly. I will stay in the bunkhouse tonight and hopefully get an early start on the trail tomorrow morning. It will be a milestone day for me. I will be crossing into North Carolina and say goodbye to my home state of Georgia. Looking forward to pizza tonight and hot shower.","Deep Gap Shelter

Jayhawk ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558799,"I had an eventful hiking day! My first milestone was entering North Carolina. Woo Hoo! I celebrated by eating a Kit Kat bar right on the state line. I hiked through several areas that had been part of the forest fires last Fall. You can still smell the fire scent. It seems to have moved quickly through and burnt just the smaller trees and lower brush. The taller hardwoods seem to have little damage. Had another Trail Magic surprise at lunch. A group of young people were serving breakfast burritos and soda at a Forest Service road. It was so good! Also gave me homemade smoked almonds and the Kit Kat bar that I later ate at the state border. It's amazing how ordinary people spend their own money and time to come out and feed hikers. You can't imagine how much it is appreciated. North Carolina welcomed me with the tallest mountain so far, Courthouse Bald. It was straight up, with little or no switchbacks. I had to stop and catch my breath several times. I am tenting at Muskrat Creek. Total hiking miles today was just over 12 miles. I'm hoping to get some easier terrain where I can increase the miles to over 15 per day. Looking at the trail guide, I don't see any of those days coming up anytime soon. Unless I wake up tomorrow morning with a new 25 year old body! These mountains are kicking this 65 year olds butt on most days. But I am having a great time. Yes it's hard, but I love it.","Dicks Creek Gap

Jayhawk ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558800,"Got up at daybreak and I was on the trail by 7:40 am. This was the best hiking day.   The weather was perfect with blue skies and temps in the 60's. Climbed the highest mountain so far. I ate my first Honey Bun in my life for breakfast. Maybe that helped me get over Standing Indian Mountain. 5,435 elevation. It actually wasn't too bad and the trail after that was rolling hills. I guess it's the AT rewarding you for climbing Standing Indian. Most of the day was spent again hiking through burned areas. Don't see any wildlife, but you can see new Spring plant growth starting to bloom. I'm tenting at Carters Gap tonight. Calling for storms all day tomorrow. Will decide after daybreak how bad the weather is looking. It's hiker midnight, and I'm in my tent and sleeping bag at 7:30 pm. There will be no problem falling asleep.","Muskrat Creek Shelter

Jayhawk ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558801,"Woke up to rain, strong winds, and fog this morning. I don't understand how it can be foggy when the wind is blowing so hard. It must be the altitude. Weather radar was showing strong storms coming in and I decided to wait it out. I'm glad I did. Around 10 am heavy downpours arrived with lightening and strong winds. Storms didn't let up under 3:30 pm. I ended up taking a zero day in my tent. I was hoping to take my first zero day in Franklin on Wednesday and fill up on some good food. I guess Mother Nature and the AT had different plans. It's almost useless to plan ahead on the trail. Weather and tough terrain can slow you down at any point. You just have to be flexible. Sunny skies return tomorrow and more rain on Wednesday. I'm going to be on the trail by daybreak and see if I can hike all 16 miles into Franklin and get back on schedule. If I can't make it, I will stealth camp somewhere off the trail, hopefully within 4 or 5 miles to the highway.","Carter Gap Shelter

I was ready to hit the trail at 6:30 am, but it was still dark so I waited about 15 minutes for the first signs of daybreak. Not only was the weather perfect, but I hiked 16 miles. That's my most distance so far! I also crossed my 100 mile milestone!! Highlight of the day was climbing Albert Mountain. There is an abandoned fire tower there. I had heard about Albert Mountain and it didn't disappoint. The last 1/4 mile is more like rock climbing than hiking. You have to put your trekking poles away and just use your hands to pull up over the rocks. You are rewarded with spectacular views. Also seeing more wildlife. At daybreak I saw about 8 deer staring at me as I hiked past. They didn't even move. Seeing more squirrels and I saw my first wild turkey cross the trail ahead of me. And no, still haven't seen any black bears, and that's fine with me. I'm in Franklin, NC and I caught a ride into town. Since I haven't showered in 4 days, I'm planning to shower, do laundry, and eat real food!! And thanks to everyone that has left messages in my journal.

Jayhawk ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558921,"I had a much needed zero day in Franklin, NC. During the peak AT hiking season, First Baptist Church sends a shuttle to the most popular hiker hostels and hotels at 7:15 am each morning to transport hungry hikers to their church for free pancakes, bacon, and beverages. What a great group of people! This is part of their outreach program and they seem to love what they do. And we hikers love their generosity! I spent the rest of the day making resupply visits to a local outfitter, Walmart, and Ingles Food store. You might wonder what people eat on the trail. You see about everything, but the most common things are freeze dried meal packets while in camp. Most hikers carry some type of stove to boil water. Then they can add things like pasta, rice, and ramen. Add tuna or chicken and you have some good protein. I have chosen to go stoveless. My normal day would be a breakfast bar in the morning, followed by a energy bar around mid morning. Lunch would be beef strips and something sweet. Dinner is normally tortillas with peanut butter, more steak strips, and some fruit snacks. And then probably another energy bar before bed. There is no way you can replace the calories you burn each day, so you try to pack food that has the highest calories in the lightest weight. A good rule of thumb is 130 calories per ounce. That's why you become good friends with Honey Buns, Snickers, and dark chocolate! LOL! Timing was good to be off the trail as the weather was stormy off and on all day. Would have been a very cold and wet day on the trail. Can't say enough about the people of Franklin. This is a true trail town! Back on the AT tomorrow. Weather forecast shows cool temps in the 40's and windy. I will be layered up. On cool mornings I always start off in my down jacket, but it doesn't take long before I have to stop and take it off. You are fine as long as you keep moving. You never send your down jacket home. It will be needed throughout the trip for cool mornings at high altitude. Oh by the way, just to show you how clueless I can be, I was telling a local about the mornings being so foggy even with the strong winds at my tent sites. He reminded me that it's not really fog, it's clouds!! When you camp above 5,000 feet you are at or above the cloud level. Duh!!! You learn something everyday!!","Winding Stair Gap

He drove a Jeep Wrangler and shuttles hikers throughout the day. I could have listened to his stories all day, but the trail was waiting. Weather was cloudy with increasing winds. Temps in the mid 40's. Stayed in my down jacket, stocking cap, and long pants all day. The weather is really on a roller coaster. Hiking in shorts and short sleeves one day, bundled up in layers the next. The hike wasn't too difficult with only one major uphill to Siler Bald. Total of 15.8 miles. I am camping near Cold Spring Shelter. I bought some heavy duty tent stakes in Franklin to help with the strong winds. They will be tested tonight with a wind advisory in effect for wind gusts up to 45 mph. I remember commenting in my journal in my first few days about the wind and the sound it makes as it roars across the mountains and through the gaps. After 125 miles, I'm still in awe. I have actually grown to enjoy the sound. It's like the mountains are trying to speak and welcome you to their world.

Jayhawk ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559169,"What a remarkable day! Woke up this morning at Cold Creek campsite and the name was very appropriate. Temps dropped during the night and the wind increased. Started hiking around 7:15 am and as I climbed to higher altitude, I started to hike in snow. It was so pretty and quiet to hike in that setting. And to be the first hiker out, I got to walk on pristine snow. The wind really picked up and the gusts were over 40 mph on the mountain peaks. I was glad I had my trekking poles to stay balanced. I climbed a wooden observation tower on Wesser Bald that is maintained by the Forest Service and was rewarded with unbelievable views. I could see Fontana Lake and the Smokey Mountains in the distance. It will take me about 2 to 3 more days to reach Fontana Dam and then enter the Smokies. The wind was so strong on the tower that I couldn't stay long. It was a long winding downhill to Nantahala Outdoor Center. Very rocky in spots and made more challenging with the snow and ice on the trail. All in all, a great day. Got to NOC around 2 pm and ordered a huge hiker burger and fries at their restaurant. This is a really neat place with canoeing, kayaking, zip lines, and fishing. A general store and an outfitter. Pretty much everything an outdoor enthusiast would want. And the AT goes right through the property. Planning to leave here tomorrow morning and start heading toward Fontana Dam.","Cold Creek Shelter

By lunchtime, it was sunny skies and temps in the 60's. Hiking yesterday in snow, today back into shorts! Spring is definitely showing in the mountains. I am noticing all the trees starting to get leaves and I am seeing more color throughout the forest. It was nice being able to see long distances in a winter forest, but the trees and bushes blooming is even better. Coming out of NOC, the trail starts a long uphill climb to Cheoah Bald. It was over 6 miles uphill with no breaks. Felt it was never going to end. Add to that, my pack was loaded with food and water, so I'm sure I looked like a pack mule climbing the long incline. That darn mule would have probably beat me to the top! Passed Sassafras Gap shelter near the peak and it was tempting to stop and set up my tent. I decided to eat lunch there and I felt much better after getting some food and water. Continued hiking to Locust Cove Gap at the 10.1 mile mark for the day. At that point I was very tired and decided to stealth camp there. The next shelter was 5.4 miles away. Just too far after a tough day of hiking. This has been an exhausting day physically. That's okay. It's all part of the experience, and that's what makes it all worthwhile. Ate some dinner, hung my bear bag, and refilled my water supply. It's 7:45 pm and that's hiker midnight for me. Time for sleep. Tomorrow will be a big day. Hoping to get out early and hike 18 miles to Fontana Dam. If I make it, it wIll be the most AT hiking miles I have done in a single day.

Jayhawk ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559562,"After a long uphill hike yesterday, I was able to push it today and reach Fontana Dam. It was a hike of 18 miles, but the weather was beautiful and the trail was accommodating by AT standards. Primarily rolling hills and then a somewhat long descent into Fontana. This is a beautiful area! When I arrived I noticed numerous motorcycles and sports cars around the Dam area. There is a nearby road called ""Tail of the Dragon"" which features 318 curves in 11 miles. It's Americas number one sports car and motorcycle road. There was a group of over 100 VW GTI Golf sports car enthusiasts who were meeting to socialize and drive the twisting roads for fun. I was told that other car clubs meet here often such as Porsche, MiniCooper, and BMW. When I cross Fontana Dam tomorrow morning, I will enter the Smokey Mountains. I'm very excited to finally reach the Smokies. I have seen them from a distance for several days, and now I am right at the entrance. I have been asked if I am hiking with anyone. The answer is yes and no. I hike primarily alone during the day, but you occasionally see other hikers. You do cross paths with day hikers around popular trailheads or scenic views if there is a road nearby. As I go further north, I see fewer people. Some days I don't see anyone until I reach a campsite. The shelters and campsites are where you have the most opportunity to meet people. You find that there are several people that you see over and over. It's called a bubble. Since I have been on the trail for a couple weeks straight, there are probably 6 to 8 people that I see on a regular basis. You may camp near them one night, and then not see them again for several days. And then you run into them at an overlook or maybe even at a hostel. I haven't found many hikers in my bubble that are my age. Most of them are in the 20's and 30's. Good kids. Just out for an adventure. One 18 year old was put on the trail by his Dad and told to find out what he wanted to do with his life. His Dad hiked with him for 2 nights and sent him on his way. He had never backpacked and he was really scared in the storms. He has really come a long way. He's talking now about joining the military. There is a common bond we have on the AT and the challenges we all face each day. There is a kinship from those experiences that only those who are out here understand. It's really neat in its own way. The AT has a way of leveling the playing field as far as age, lifestyle, or culture. We all share the common goal of staying hydrated, eating food, and getting over the next mountain.","Locust Grove Gap

Jayhawk ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559772,"Left Fontana Dam about 7:30 am. Weather was clear and later warmed into the 70's. Walked across the Dam and entered the Smokies!! There was a box for thru hikers to drop in their Smokey Mountain National Park permit. You drop a portion of the permit in the box and carry the other portion with you during your time in the park. It cost $20 to thru hike in the Smokies. There are lot of restrictions to preserve the natural setting. The one regulation that effects thru hikers the most is the requirement that hikers sleep in shelters only. I haven't mentioned shelters much because so far I have always tented. Shelters are 3 sided wooden structures, infamous for aggressive mice who will try to chew through your backpack to eat anything you accidentally leave in pockets. In the Smokies, no tenting is allowed unless the shelter is full. And then you can only tent in the immediate area of the shelter. Most people avoid shelters, including me. So it's funny to see people trying to show up late to a shelter hoping it will be full, and thus be able to tent. Park rangers patrol the trail and can issue a substantial fine if you don't follow the rules. In fact, I was less than 4 miles into the Smokies before I met a ridge runner on the trail and he asked to see my permit. Ridge runners live on the trail for 5 days at a time and are responsible to keep everyone safe and make sure hikers are following rules including Leave No Trace principles. They cover about 16 miles of trail and hike their section during the day and sleep in a different shelter each night. Most are young and are in training to be Park Rangers. They can be a great resource to answer questions. There is a nuisance bear in this area and the ridge runner was stressing the importance of proper food storage each night. It was a beautiful day to hike. The trail up from Fontana Dam was a difficult 4 mile uphill climb. Over 2,000 foot elevation gain before finally leveling off. It did provide great views back down on Fontana Lake. After saying yesterday that I hike mainly by myself during the day, I met some great people today. It seemed lots of hikers had staged at Fontana and a big group left to enter the Smokies this morning. Met 2 young ladies who write for The Trek. It's a website that features articles about thru hiking. Their trail names were Shutterbug and Pig Pen. I will be following their blogs. Also met CurDog. All four of us started the trail about the same time, but we hadn't met in over 170 miles. Then we all end up meeting while eating snacks on the same rock outcropping in the Smokies. Funny how that works out. They were several other hikers in their 50's and 60's, so the day went quickly with lively conversation. I also met a family of 7 that are hiking together along with a service dog. I didn't get a chance to learn their story, but the kids seem to range in age from 14 to 17 years old with possibly some adoptions blended in. That's pretty neat. I assume the parents are home schooling during the hike. Way more energy than I would have at the end of a long hiking day! I am staying at the Russell Field shelter at mile marker 180.1. Total miles today was 14.5. The shelter sleeps 12 and I'm sitting here hoping it fills up so I can pitch my tent. LOL! I'm up late. It's 8 pm and I should be asleep!","Fontana Dam Shelter

Jayhawk ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559881,"I woke up to my second day in the Smokies with clear skies and temps in the low 30's. Temps later warmed up to the mid 60's. I have been fortunate to have great weather so far while hiking in the Smokies. This area had blizzard conditions just 4 days ago, and there was still patches of snow on the ground today at the highest altitudes. Just shows how fast the weather can change even in mid April. I did end up sleeping in the shelter last night. We had about 14 hikers spread across the double decker. Understandably, I didn't sleep very well. Highlight of the day was climbing Rocky Top and Thunderhead Mountains. This is the rocky peak referenced in the popular ""Rocky Top"" song played at Tennessee Volunteer sporting events. The sky was so clear that you could look down and see Cades Cove. What a beautiful scene! Both peaks were right at 5,500 feet. I hiked 14.9 miles today and I made it to Silers Bald shelter where I will be staying tonight. Hiking this far today sets me up to make Newfound Gap tomorrow where Highway 441 intersects the AT. It will only be a 12.1 mile day. I will then hitch hike the 15 miles into Gatlinburg for a zero day. By then, I will have hiked 6 days in a row over some high peaks and I can feel my energy level needs a boost. Nothing that a good hot shower, a real bed, and some good food can't easily fix.","Russell Field Shelter

Jayhawk ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560003,"Day 3 in the Smokies went very well. Another beautiful weather day. I am seeing much more wildlife while hiking in the Smokies. There is no hunting allowed in the Smokies, so animals seem to know that are safe in their natural habitat. Seeing squirrels, turkeys, and some deer. There are elk in the area and some hikers have seem early in the morning. There is also the highest concentration of black bears in the US, but I still haven't seen any bears. During today's hike, I passed a couple of milestones. First, I climbed the highest mountain on the AT, Clingmans Dome. It felt strange to hike to the summit only to find tourists all around. There is a road that allows the public to drive and park within a 1/2 mile of the summit. After not seeing any road for over 40 miles, you are surprised by people, parking lot, cars, and a visitor center. Nevertheless, it's a beautiful setting with great views. After leaving Clingmans Dome, it's another 7 mile hike to Newfound Gap. During this section, I passed the 200 mile mark in my adventure. It's hard to believe I have hiked over 200 miles since I first started back in Georgia. It's been a great time that has been very challenging at times, but always extremely rewarding.","Silers Bald Shelter

I try to write comments each day and save them until I can upload. Sometimes you are just too tired to write at night, but someone reminded me today how important it is to capture what you are experiencing while it's fresh on your mind. As the number of days on the trail increases, the days start to blend together. I will try to be diligent in uploading entries even though some days it seems to me that it's kinda boring to someone not hiking. Having said all that, I will upload many journals today. Normally when you leave a town, the trail punishes you with a steep and long incline the very first day. Sorta it's way of welcoming you back, but leaving Gatlinburg wasn't too difficult. Experienced great views on Charley's Bunion, a rock outcropping. The weather has been perfect so far while hiking in the Smokies.

Jayhawk ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560684,"My last hiking day in the Smokies was again beautiful. I have to say hiking in the Smokies wasn't as difficult as many would think. It's hard coming out of Fontana Dam to get to the higher elevation, but once you are there, you follow the ridge lines most of the way. It is definitely beautiful throughout the entire park. The only negative is the park is not really thru hiker friendly with all their regulations. That's too bad because most thru hikers comment that they are glad to be past the Smokies. I made it to Standing Bear hostel. This is a very unusual hostel with very interesting people who work here. You quickly learn you are really in the back country and people live their lives completely different than what most of us do. I am tenting tonight for $15 in a grassy area behind their bunkhouse. That includes a free outdoor shower and a towel. After not seeing any bears through the entire Smokies, a mother bear and a newborn cub were spotted just past our tenting site. I didn't see them, but several other hikers did. The cub was so small that he was having a hard time keeping up with mama bear. Lots of hikers here tonight. Meeting some new people and I was able to catch up with the group that I met near Gatlinburg. Great group of hikers of various ages, backgrounds, and physical condition. It just shows that if you are mentally strong, you don't have to be the the be super human to keep hiking. You have to learn to listen to your body. Don't push too hard and take short breaks when it gets too strenuous.","Tri-Corner Knob Shelter
",Standing Bear Hostel,"Apr 14, Fri",14.80
Jayhawk ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560685,"I know that I have commented many times that I had just finished the best hiking day so far, well this one surpassed them all. A tough climb out of Standing Bear hostel started the morning. Passed the Groundhog Creek Shelter after 7 miles and that was way too early to stop. The next shelter was about 8 miles away so that's when you start thinking how to attack the day. 7 miles is too short, but 15 miles over very tough climbs can be a challenge. Several hikers mentioned they were going to try to reach Max Patch Bald and stealth camp on the peak. We had heard that Max Patch had unbelievable views and the weather was cooperating, so that became the plan. You have to be very cautious while hiking across balds. Balds are tops of mountains that are treeless with just grasses covering the ground. While beautiful and offering great views, you don't want to be hiking or camping on balds during any bad weather. You are totally exposed and the weather can change very quickly. Lightening can be especially dangerous. There is no clear understanding on how these balds came about. Many feel that Native Indians cleared them for some reason, but Native Indians were way too smart and knew to stay at lower elevations to build their villages. Plus they are much too large and expansive to be any type of ceremonial setting. Some historians feel that early settlers may have used the balds for cattle grazing, but again cattle weren't normally grazing on mountain tops. No one knows for sure how they were created, but I can attest it may be the most awe inspiring setting I have ever personally witnessed. After hiking over 250 miles in what would be defined as dense forest, you come to this high elevation grassy area with no trees, just a dirt footpath, and marked with wooden stakes showing the AT white blazes. You climb this treeless path to the very top and when you get there, you are rewarded with an amazing scene. Surrounded by mountains in every direction with unobstructed views as far as your eyes can see. Part of the beauty is the stark difference between what you have hiked through for over 24 days and what you are seeing before you. Took some great pics of the sunset that evening and since it was Easter the next morning, set my alarm to get up before sunrise. No one had a phone signal, but earlier in the day someone had checked and there was only a 10% chance of rain with light winds. The wind was brisk as we staked out our tents, but a fellow hiker assured us the wind would decrease once the sun went down. It got noticeably colder once the sun set. It's April 16th and I'm wearing long underwear, stocking cap, gloves, long socks, and my down jacket inside my 20 degree sleeping bag trying to stay warm. And of course the wind never decreased. It actually increased and gusted over 40 mph all night. It was hard to sleep with all the noise from the flapping tent. Once it gets dark you can't move, so you have to ride it out. Made it through the night with fitful sleep. Woke up Easter morning and did notice that our ""weather expert"" hiker friend got up early and left camp before we had a chance to pound his head!!","Standing Bear Hostel

Since there were no trees around, we couldn't hang our food bags. We had to sleep with our food in our tents. Not a good idea in bear country, but there was no choice. No bears made an appearance to which we were grateful. Quickly ate breakfast, took down the tent, and packed my backpack while trying to stay warm. After a short hike off the Bald, the wind calmed, the temps warmed and it was a great day to hike. The terrain was not near as tough as yesterday. Had planned to only hike 7 or so miles to the next shelter to so that I could reach Hot Springs the next day. Reached the shelter by noon and again had the delimna of whether to camp here or push on. After eating lunch and seeing the bad condition of the shelter, decided to move on. Several major climbs were ahead and it would be over 17 total hiking miles before reaching the next shelter. Almost ran out of water. Passed several good streams earlier in the day and assumed there would be more ahead. I usually carry about 1 1/2 liter of water just to be safe. I was down to less than 4 ounces and all the reliable water sources shown in the trail guide were dry. Nothing more frustrating than walking a good distance off the trail to get to reportedly good water only to find it dry. Plus it slows you down. Finally heard a stream up ahead and it was flowing strong. Filled up both water bottles, plus an extra liter in my filter bag. Since it was still 4.6 miles to the next shelter, decided to stealth camp on an abandoned dirt road crossing. Just got the tent set up before a short downpour of rain.

A couple of not too difficult climbs right after leaving the tent site, followed by a long downhill into Hot Springs. You could see the town as you hiked down the last mountain and it sure was a welcome sight. There is a river that flows right through town and you could hear the sound of a train rumbling down the tracks. It made you excited to see and hear, knowing good food was fast approaching. The AT trail runs right down Main Street. The trail is marked by the AT marker in the concrete sidewalk. It was lunchtime and I was hungry. Found a great place to eat right next to a flowing stream. Ate outside and ordered a salad, burger, and fries. And of course, sweet tea. The food was excellent! This is a great small town and really welcomes thru hikers. Great food, welcoming locals, several hostels, a small outfitter store, and even a laundromat for us dirty hikers. They even have a small welcome center for hikers that offers free wifi, homemde cookies, and a place to sit down and relax. The only thing that's missing is a barber shop. I haven't had a haircut in over 6 weeks and I haven't shaved in over 3 weeks. Not sure I carry the mountain man look very well, but it is what it is! LOL! I thought Franklin, NC was a great trail town, but Hot Springs is even better. Definitely my favorite town so far. Filled the rest of the day getting a hot shower, resupplying food at the local Dollar General, doing laundry, and just enjoying the beautiful afternoon. Ate dinner at Iron Horse tavern and ordered a grilled shrimp salad. It was delicious.

Great food and their portion size was enormous! After over a week of beautiful weather, it was cool and drizzling rain when I walked across the bridge and left town. I had a late start to get on the trail and ended up hiking alone all day. Several other hikers were taking a zero day in Hot Springs, but I decided to go back to the trail. You grow to enjoy the bubble of people that you are hiking with and sometimes you see and hike with them for several days. Then, when you get to town, schedules change and the core group can part ways. You find yourself missing the comradarie. It all falls back to the mantra of HYOH ""Hike Your Own Hike"". Everyone has to follow the schedule and pace that works for them personally. The trail always provides and you meet new people and create new bubbles. It was a 11 mile hike to the first shelter. It rained off and on all day and the low clouds blocked any good views. It was a day that you just have to get through on the trail. I stopped for a quick lunch, but the rain and cool temps made me cold pretty quickly. Started hiking again just to warm up. Had to wear my rain gear all day. Got to the shelter around 5 pm and it was a dump. Other hikers were complaining. I pitched my tent and ate dinner. I think everyone was just a little grumpy after hiking in cool temps and rain all day. You have to take the bad with the good. Every day is not going to be perfect hiking conditions.

My hike started in light rain and around lunchtime the sun came out, followed by more rain. You get real sweaty in rain gear as you try to hike. Sometimes it feels like a sauna. When the weather gets warmer, you can hike without rain gear. It will refresh you and maybe even wash away some of the hiker funk smell. And there is no such thing as a waterproof rain jacket. If you hike long enough in the rain, the water will find its way inside your jacket! This was one of those days that you can do a short hike of 9 miles to the next shelter, or go about 16 miles to the following shelter. I was originally going to go for 16 miles, but with the rain and a 2,400 foot climb in the middle of that 16 miles, I decided to stop at 9 miles. Sometimes you just know that you might risk injury if you go too far in tough terrain. My health has been good so far. I haven't had to take any ibuprofen for sore muscles. Hikers call ibuprofen ""vitamin i"" because most end up taking it on a nearly daily basis. The one thing you want to keep healthy is your feet. They really take a beating. Not only the long distances, but also all the pounding from rocks and tree roots. Some days it seems you never step a foot on level ground. So far, I have been very lucky with no blisters. I had one blister back in Georgia that was trying to develop, but I covered it with sports tape and it healed quickly. You constantly are aware of any new pain or discomfort while hiking. The bottom of my left heel starting hurting a couple days ago as I hiked the long downhill coming into Hot Springs. I never have felt that before and I first thought it was a blister starting. When I got to town, I didn't see anything. I think it was just the pounding of the rocks as we went downhill. It felt much better after a good nights rest. If you ask most hikers, especially older hikers, the downhills are much harder on your feet and knees than the uphills. I totally agree. Even though uphills are more strenuous, the downhills really make you sore that night. I wear Salomon Trail Runner XA Pro 3D shoes along with Darn Tough hiking socks. That combination has worked well for me. I also have a pair of Wright socks that have a double lining. Those work very well also. The shoes last about 500 miles. I will pass the 300 mile mark tomorrow, so when I add the AT miles plus the training miles I hiked before I got on the AT, I will be needing new shoes within a couple weeks. Probably buy a new pair in Damascus, Va when I arrive. They have a big outfitter store there. I will be tenting at Little Laurel shelter tonight.

Steep uphill from shelter to Camp Creek Bald lookout tower. I'm sure the views would have been lovely, but I could only see fog. I have been lucky that I have been able to view most of the major overlooks in good weather. But sometimes, you climb a mountain and not be able to see anything. It was a pretty easy hike over the last 12 miles. Rolling hills and a few streams. Ate lunch at Chestnut Log Gap, but didn't stay long. Next up was Big Butt Mountain. And yes, that was the real name. There was a Shelton grave site just to the east. Probably the poor soul who originally named Big Butt Mountain after his mother in law! However, there was no mention of that fact on the grave marker. I have passed several small grave sites lately. Many from the late 1800's. Always makes me reflect on what hardships that they faced just to survive. I passed my 300 mile mark around lunchtime. The first 100 miles in Georgia seemed so long. The last 100 miles since Gatlinburg has flown by! Looking forward to getting to Erwin, Tn on Saturday or Sunday. There is a NASCAR race in Bristol this weekend. Even though that's about 30 miles away, the local hotels jack up their rates. The trail guide shows a Super 8 rate of $49.
