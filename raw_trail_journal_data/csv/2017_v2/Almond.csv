Almond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553477,"Today I began my Appalachian Trail journey. No it's not a thru hike, in fact it may take years to complete but I couldn't be more excited about the hiking adventures to come. My friend Peaches and I will be section hiking together and occasionally our guys may tag along, Taz, Tater and Goober. Taz belongs to me. We do have somewhat of a plan to get us started. This year we hope to complete the Smokies Section and the state of Maryland. However we do want to start at Springer and finish at Katahdin. That brings me to today's hike.We left my house at 8:30 this morning for the two hour drive to Woody Gap so we could leave my car. Taz (my hubby) works in Blue Ridge, GA so he picked us up at Woody Gap and took us over to the Springer Mtn parking area. (The drive from Woody Gap to Springer is a story all to itself!) A few pictures by the sign and we were off. It was now 12:30pm, which was only 30 minutes later than we had hoped to be starting. We hiked the .9 up to the top of Springer Mountain. There was about a 30% chance of rain today and we must have been the 30% because the rain followed us most of the day. That being said there were no views from Springer Mtn. That's ok we were still glad to be there. We took the mandatory beginning of trail pictures and back down Springer Mountain we went. We were now officially hiking the Appalachian Trail!
I had thru hiked the BMT last year, so several parts of today's trail were familiar. The big difference between the two trails so far is that the AT is noticeably more worn. Also the shelters are something you will not find on the BMT, there are only two. The Stover Creek shelter was the first one we saw. A very nice two story shelter with campfire ring and a privy. (aka the potty) I signed the book that we were ""just passing threw"" and we continued down the trail. Our next stop would be Long Falls. We had camped here last fall and wanted to see if the recent rains had made a difference in the falls. Not really but they were still beautiful. We reminisced for a few minutes about our dinner table rock and how slopped the spot was we had camped last year. 
For the rest of the afternoon it was very foggy and misty. About a mile before our shelter there is the Hawk Mtn campground just off the trail. A nice diagram of the campground sits right on the trail. There are at least 30 tent camp pads here. I guess during thru hiker season it could be a busy place. I would have liked to have gone and checked it out but we were losing daylight. Not to mention it was downhill which means UPHILL to get back to the trail. Not this time!
We reached the Hawk Mtn Shelter at 5:49, at least that's what Peaches told me, I didn't look. There were 2 other people there when we arrived, a lady and her dog (Riley) and a man. They were both eating supper so they had been here long enough to get settled in. We had actually passed the lady and her dog as we were hiking up Springer. The lady is section hiking and hopes to thru hike next year, SOBO. The man is on day 2 of his thru hike. Good luck to you both! 
We did have enough cell service here to send text messages home that we made it. I also carry an inReach satellite tracker but its ""I'm here"" message never sent. Maybe it was to close to the shelter because I didn't want to sit it out in the rain. Who knows? Anyway, Peaches and I began to settle in to our home for the night. I prepared a wonderful meal of Beef Stroganoff, Mountain House of course, while Peaches took a few of our belongings to the upper bunk. This shelter has bear cables and a bear box. Since it was still raining we chose to put all our food and toiletries in the bear box and keep our packs in the shelter. I handed our packs up to Peaches and now all our gear was in place for the night. By now our dinner was ready. We just shared the meal right in the bag. It was just to much trouble to clean dishes. Besides the two other shelter tenants had already turned in, so we were trying to be quiet. For dessert we had cold Reese's cups and sweet tea. Well I had sweet tea! 
We turned in around 8:30. I worked on my trail journal and listen to the rain on the tin roof. It felt good today to be back on the trail!","Springer Mountain
",Hawk Mountain Shelter,"Jan 16, Mon",9.10
Almond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553478,"Shelters are still somewhat of an odd place to me. I have only stayed in two. The first one was in the Smokies on the BMT and it was full. There was lots of good trail conversation but this one was strangely quite. I don't think I ever heard the two hikers downstairs speak to each other as they got ready to leave. I was looking outside from the loft so when the lady and her dog left she spoke to me ""Have a good day."" she said ""You do the same."" I replied. Now when the man returned and put on his pack to leave I think he would of disappeared into the fog with out speaking a word. He took about one step and I said ""Have a good day and good luck on your hike!"" he turned and smiled and said ""Thank you. You too."" It would have bothered me if I had just let someone walk away without acknowledging their presence.It had rained most all night which made for a foggy morning. We were on the trail by 8:30, easily following the white blazes that mark the trail. By the time we ascended out of Hightower Gap the fog had lifted enough to tease us with small views of the surrounding mountains. However that was short lived as we were back in the soup by Cooper Gap. This is were we caught up with the man that was at the shelter with us last night (we called him the Ox because his pack was so large) and another man we had seen earlier on the trail. They were taking a break. I said ""Good to see you both again everyone doing ok?"" They said yes so we continued on and so did the Ox. We saw the Ox several more times through out the day. 
We made it to the Gooch Mtn shelter just before 2:00, so this was our lunch stop. Tuna wraps with hummus, a few pieces of chocolate and sweet tea was the ""lunch special"" here. We took our packs and shoes off so we could really relax during our 30 minute break. I signed the shelter journal and we loaded up and hit the trail. We came across the Ox one last time, this time he had a radio attach with carabiner around his neck. You could hear his country music playing as he came up the hill. Hats off to him, I couldn't carry his load but the things he has chosen to carry made me smile.
Just a short ways down the trail we came across a man on a day hike. We spoke with him for a minute then let him pass. Turns out he was originally from one town south of us in Tennessee but lives over in Georgia now. Gooch Gap was our last forest service road crossing. The man that passed us earlier was there loading up his car. Once again we stopped to visit. He told us he had sectioned hiked most of the trail and had been up to Katahdin. We told him this was the first of our section hikes, hopefully one day we would get there too. Just as we were about to walk away he said he would like to tell us one more story. As we stood and listened he shared with us he had been diagnosed with a brain tumor last year, was now completely well and just starting his hikes again. Peaches and I were both smiling and told him how wonderful that was. I'm sure a day hike for him was just a special as a thru hike for others.
With just 3.5 miles to go the fog had lifted and given way to gorgeous views. After being in the clouds most of the day we spent a little extra time to enjoy and take a few pictures. The last mile to Woody Gap was much more rocky than we expected. They were very slick which slowed us down. We didn't want to take a wrong step right at the end of our day. We made it to the car right before dark. Perfect timing!
We still had a two hour drive back home. So we did what any modest Hiker would do, we took a good look around the parking lot to see if anyone was there, then we stripped down and put on clean, dry clothes. Ahhh much better! On the drive home we were already planning our next AT adventure.","Hawk Mountain Shelter
",Woody Gap,"Jan 17, Tue",12.50
Almond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556236,"Finally, I was getting back on the trail! We were hoping to start our next section the end of February but work and weather had different plans. So here it was the first week of March and we were ready to go.
We were up bright in early for the two hour drive over to Woody Gap so we could meet our shuttle driver at 8:30am. He would be taking us to Unicoi Gap. Two days before our hike we decided to hike SOBO. This was for two reasons, one the bear canister restriction began March 1st for one of our chosen campsites and two everyone else this time of year is going NOBO. 
This was mine and Peaches first experience with a shuttle service so we were both a little uncertain of what to expect. Peaches' husband had made the arrangements for our shuttle and she filled me in on the details on the drive over. She said ""His name is Murris, he asked if it was ok if his dog came, and naturally I said yes. Also he is driving a Ford Ranger with a luggage rack on the top."" All of that sounded fine except for the Ford Ranger part. I ask her ""So he is in a truck?"" We both just started to laugh because it was freezing cold, very windy and a hour drive over to Unicoi Gap if we had to ride in the back. 
Sure enough when we pulled into Woody Gap there was Murris and his Ford Ranger. He came over introduced himself and helped us load our bags in the back of the truck. He then gave us the choice of where we wanted to ride, in the front with him or the back of the truck. I think my responce went something like this ""I'll sit on your lap before I ride in the back, its freezing!"" Once again we laughed and all three of us piled into the front of his truck. This is when we met Avril, the dog. Avril was a cute little lap dog and if he could talk I feel certain could give directions to anywhere around the north Georgia mountains. For the next hour Murris shared info about the trail, the local area and why he uses a truck. (He uses a truck because when hiker season really gets going it's warmer and he can help more hikers get where they need to be. Not to mention hikers can sometime stink!lol) The time flew buy and we were to Unicoi Gap before we knew it. Murris made sure we had all our belonging and asked if we wanted our picture to start our journey. After our picture he told us he was available 24 hours if we needed any assistance. Thank you Murris and Avril for making our first hiker shuttle experience great!  
The winds where howling at Unicoi so we decided another layer and a toboggan were required. (In the South a toboggan is a hat not a sled. lol) As we were closing up our packs a van load of NOBO thru hikers showed up. We said a few hellos and they head north and we crossed the highway to head south. 
I'm still comparing the AT to the BMT (which I need to quit doing) but the trail was easy to navigate today. It had everything you could ask of a trail, ups, downs, rocks, roots, water, views, shelters and camping spots. I like to check out the shelters whether we are staying or not and the Blue Mountain shelter was up first. There were already 7 NOBO thru hikers there taking early lunch breaks. The shelter was nice but the view was great! I think this one will have a view even in the summer. We wished everyone good luck and continued SOBO. The big story of the day was the wind! My nose ran all day long. Guess you can't have it all everyday, there was not a cloud in the sky and the sun was shinning, but it was cold and windy. 
Our original plan was to tent camp at the Low Gap Shelter. However, as the day went on and we passed more and more NOBO thru hikers (42 to be exact) we began to look at other options. We came up with a new plan on our late lunch stop. We had to wait till we were on the leeward side of the mountain for lunch because the winds were so strong. The new idea was to stop short at a campsite about a mile from the Low Gap Shelter. This campsite was marked in the AT Guide. We arrived there quicker than we thought and decided to press on. About a half mile from the Low Gap shelter we found a nice stealth campsite and called it home for the night. 
Once we had the tent set up I tried to find a tree to hang our food from. Maybe this is why it is not a marked campsite because there is not a could place to hang a bear bag. I finally found a less than adequate tree but we both agreed it would be ok. (Side note - I am very much a LNT backpacker however due to a bonehead maneuver there is a very nice carabiner in that tree if you can get it down! arrgghh!!)  Now that we had our rope ready for our bags it was time for supper which was Mountain House Lasagna. This makes for easy clean up and I think we were more tired than hungry. Just a few minutes after we had hung our bear bag Peaches finds her chapstick in her pocket so she heads back down to lower the bags. 
Now here is why I am telling you about her silly chapstick. We don't always stay where we can see each other during the day. Usually whoever is in the lead will make an ""owl call"" and which ever one of us is behind will answer. If the lead person doesn't get an answer we stay up until we get one. Any other time we use the ""owl call"" as the ""Can you come over here?"" It's basically because we don't want to yell for each other in the woods. 
OK back to Peaches putting her chapstick in the bear bag. Just about the time she gets there I here the ""owl call"". Now keep in mind I can see her so I say ""Do you need some help?"" her response is ""NO"". This went on for a least 3 more times before Peaches decides we must be hearing people at the shelter. It was not until the middle of the night when we heard our ""owl call"" again that we realized we had both been answering a real owl! hahahaha","Unicoi Gap
",Low Gap Steath Camp,"Mar 02, Thu",9.20
Almond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556362,"I started my forth day on the AT early. That just means I was wake and out of the tent, not making any miles. Our stealth site was close to the trail and NOBO hikers from the Low Gap shelter had already started trickling by in the dark. Turns out we had a great spot to watch the sunrise. As I stood there watching, the sun came little by little changing the dark sky of night to a magnificent orange and then to bright blue. Guess I'm a little like the sun, I move slow in the morning! 
Time to break down camp. It was a cold morning, upper 20's I would guess, so this was helping Peaches and I pick up the pace. We wanted to get hiking. Peaches and I don't have set chores of who does what, it seems to just naturally happen. We do split up the tent and food bags to carry but we each have our own snack bags. She carries lunch and the jetboil. I carry dinner, the water filter and the bandaid bag. Our packs were ready to hit the trail.
We were to the Low Gap Shelter quick. There were still at least half a dozen tents set up and several people at the shelter. With a stream right behind the shelter this is a nice place to stay. However, after seeing how many people were there we knew our stealth site was the right choice. I'm still amazed at the number of people on the AT. 
Over all the trail was nothing out of the ordinary today with the exception that it was VERY WINDY! I will say from a SOBO perspective Poor Mountain was a challenging climb, not many switchbacks. When we came to the road at Hogpen Gap there were trail magic snacks left by the sign. We didn't take any since we were section hiking, but we told a thru hiker about them and he took some. Our lunch break was on a blue blazed trail at Hogpen Gap. We never went to look for the water but water is noticeably harder to find on the trail than yesterday. During our lunch break we counted over 20 NOBOs. There were beautiful views on our way to Tesnatee Gap, but the wind was something else! Our climb up Cowrock Mountain had a few icy spots and icycles hanging off rocks. The top of Cowrock Mountain has breath taking view so we took a short break here just to enjoy. I ran out of water shortly after our break with one more mountain to climb. Oh well I still had a little sweet tea left. Just before Levelland Mountain, our final climb for the day, we came across 2 hikers that just replenish their water. It was just a small puddle with piped water from the hill. We took the time to replenish my water so we would know we had enough for supper. 
Bulls Gap was our original stopping point but we had decided earlier in the day to press on to Neels Gap. We wanted to be there when Mountain Crossing Outfitters opened in the morning. There was a nice stealth site about a half mile from Neels that we almost called home, but we continued. As we were approaching Neels a NOBO hiker told us there was free chili at the hostel so that put a little pep in our step. We took two steps and she asked ""You do know your going South Bound?"" We just laughed and ""Yes, but thank you for asking!"" I thought that was a very good question. As we rolled into Neels we passed the ""camping area"". It was terribly rocky, on a slope and maybe room for 3 tents. However 2 tents were already set up and if we camped here we would have to be right next to another tent. No time to worry about this now we need to find that free chili. 
Found it! Free chili was at the hostel. I felt like from the time we walked in the door at the hostel till the time we left we looked like lost puppies that no one wanted. When we came in the door, with our packs on, we were greeted with awkward silence and a bunch on men starring at us. In their defense they were eating chili! We managed to maneuver our packs off in the small space and set them in the corner. Guess we should have left them outside, but when your pack is your entire world at the moment your a little protective of it. Finally the ""trail angel"" that brought the meal invited us eat. As we walked back to the kitchen one of the men spoke to Peaches. It went something like this...""Uhh Ma'am?"", Yes sir, ""That door is the restroom."", oh ok thanks, ""No your packs are blocking the door."", Oh I'm sorry! Peaches went and moved our packs 3 inches right and headed straight back to the kitchen. The chili was good and we were glad not to have to fix supper tonight. The thought had crossed our mind to say at the hostel but as we ate by looks we were giving each other we both knew our faithful tent would be home. We thanked the ""trail angel"" for a delicious meal grabbed our packs and these ""two puppies"" moved on. 
Now where to set up camp? We like to play by the rules so we headed back up to the less than ideal camping area. As we were clearing rocks a man came out of his tent and said ""I snore like a freight train you probably don't want to camp here!"" Ok then! We just stood there looking at each other, once again that unwanted puppy feeling came over us. Finally I said ""Come on let's go down here."" We ended up pitching our tent on a level spot by a concrete picnic table. No we weren't supposed to camp here but at this point it was all we had. If your planning on tent camping at Neels I would keep going to the stealth site or Bulls Gap. They are both MUCH better for tents.
Our bear bag was hung, we had a extra layer of clothes on and my water was in my sleeping bag. I was ready for our coldest night on the trail so far, Low 20's.","Low Gap Steath Camp
",Neels Gap,"Mar 03, Fri",12
Almond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558550,"I woke up about 4:00am needing to go to the bathroom. Since my side of the tent was next to a concrete picnic table I could only get out on Peaches side. I whispered to Peaches ""I need to go to the bathroom. Want to go?"" Her response was ""No"". Really? So for the next two hours I laid there trying to think of anything but the bathroom. When Peach woke up the first words out of her mouth were ""I'm going to run to the bathroom."" Oh no you don't sister, I called this hours ago!! She didn't even remember telling me ""No"". We had a good laugh about that.
Turns out a 20 degree night is not that bad. I slept in my puffy jacket, two layers of cloths, two pair of socks, gloves, a wool buff and my sleeping bag is rated to 20 degrees. By morning my hands and feet were getting cold but other than that I stayed comfy. 
We both woke up early so everything could be packed up by the time Mountain Crossing Outfitters opened. That's when I got cold, breaking down camp. As we packed up the hikers from the hostel were beginning their NOBO journeys. They passed with friendly nods and the occasional ""Good Morning"" and we did the same. It was still much to early for conversation. 
Neels Gap is reportedly the only place where the AT goes through a building. This is where the register for the hostel is located. I signed us in. Just beyond the register we came upon the famous ""Tree of Shoes"". Hundreds of hiking shoes have been tossed in the tree after there owners have decided they can't take another step. Almost makes you want to look up and say ""Thank you hiking shoes!"" Hahahahaha 
""Look the Open sign is on!"" We spent the next 45 minutes checking out gear. Just like most people we didn't get out of there without spending any money. However all I bought was food, which consisted of a sandwich, Reese's, chips and a Gatorade. As we were checking out we both put our first stamp in AT Passport books. Now we felt official! (Well official section hikers anyway. Lol) 
There it was Blood Mountain. As we started our morning climb the trail was quite for about 20 minutes. Then we started reaching the NOBO thru hikers. Now we were expecting them, but what we weren't expecting were all the day hikers. Who knew this was a Saturday local hot spot for people of all ages and dogs of all sizes. It was really quite nice to see people besides backpackers enjoying the trail. We also new by their lack of packs they wouldn't be to far past Blood Mtn. Hiking SOBO puts you hiking up the rocky part. With many of the rocks being just a little taller than my natural step. It was slow and steady but so worth it.    As we neared the top the views became better and better. So much so we decided to have an early lunch and enjoy. (Side note: The Italian Sandwich that we bought back at the outfitters had banana peppers and pepperoni on it and it was delicious.....or we were just really hungry!) The Blood Mtn Shelter was a few tenths of a mile from our lunch stop. This is a stone building with two rooms, built by the CCC in the 1940's. We took a look around, Peaches signed the register and we moved on rather quickly. There were at least 50 people around the shelter. We did speak with the Ridgerunner at Blood Mtn. He was spending the day there then hiking SOBO to the Woods Hole Shelter for the evening. Hope everyone had there bear canister at Woods Hole, it's required there March 1 - June 1.
Hiking down Blood Mtn (SOBO) was a completely different trail. There were no rocks for the most part, it was a gradual descent, fewer people and the temperature was perfect. I can't guarantee you'll have those last two however.  It was basically like this all the was to Jarrard Gap. Ok a few ups but still nice. The fun part was passing the thru hikers going NOBO. They had miles of gradual uphill and it was showing. One man stopped us and asked is it all uphill to Blood Mtn. We smiled and said ""I'm afraid it is uphill to get to the top of the mountain."" He responded by telling us he was thru hiking but didn't like the uphills. I so wanted to say ""Well sir, you will be glad to know this is the last climb between here and Maine!"" Lol. Instead I said ""Just take your time you'll be fine.""
We had hiked steady since Blood Mtn with only one short break and for some reason I left my pack on then. By the time we reached the Lance Creek my body was wanting this pack off my back! Wow, it felt wonderful to stretch and eat a quick Oreo snack. We rested for about 15 minutes then it was packs back on for our final climb of the day. The top of the Big Cedar Mtn is home to Preaching Rock. You can almost picture a mountain preacher from a 100 years ago giving his once a month sermon to the locals. The views are breathtaking. The sun was quickly calling it a day and we wanted to finish before dark. The trail was once again rocky down the mountain toward Woody Gap. Peaches got ahead of me on the downhill but was waiting for at the Woody Gap sign. Our trail rule is we always finish the hike together. 
Once back at the car we changed in to clean clothes for the two hour journey back home. My husband had sent us a message that chili would be ready when we got home and Peaches family was coming over. Problem was we were starving, so we made a quick gas station stop for a ""small"" snack. The ""small"" snack ended up being a Hunt Brothers pizza. We ate the entire pizza and never told them about our stop. Lol. When we walk in the door at home I just said ""Yum, that chili smells delicious!"" Peaches and I fixed us two small bowls! Hahahahaha","Neels Gap
",Woody Gap,"Mar 04, Sat",10.80
Almond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566040,"*** Today's total miles were 9.2 but only counting 4.6 for my AT total. 
Peaches and I met early this morning for the two hour drive to Fontana Dam.  The weather was look pretty ominous but we were excited to try our new packs (ULA Circuit) so we were going.  We arrived at the Fontana Dam visitors center a little after ten and headed over to the visitors center to get our AT passports stamped. Now we were ready to hit the trail.
From the visitors center the trail crosses the dam to reach the southern end of the Smokies.  Once in the GSNP there is a short road walk before the trail enters the woods for the continuous climb to the Shuckstack fire tower.  A box for thru hikers to place their permits is located at the base of the mountain.
It's late April so the trees were just starting to green up which meant we still had views of Fontana Lake.  All along the trail wildflowers were starting to bloom, Gatsby trillium, sage, chickweed, violet, star grass, rose corn to name a few.  In true AT fashion, at least the parts I've hiked, the trail was easy to navigate.  There was one good water source about a mile from the fire tower.  As we got closer to the tower I was getting more anxious and excited about the fire tower climb.  I said to Peaches ""I'm not sure if I'll be able to climb the fire tower and if I do I might cry when I climb it!""  I snickered when I said it but I was nervous.
The fire tower trail splits off from the AT and is about a .1 steep climb to the summit.  When we arrived there was a group of about 10 day hikers getting ready to leave.  Peaches was ready to start climbing but I was going to wait till they left.  As soon as they left we headed for the tower steps.  I made it to just above the tree tops and froze.  Peaches was already several flights above me when she called down and said ""Come on more people are coming.""   Before I could go up or down a group of college aged boys were there racing up the steps.  I continued to my death grip on the 2nd level railing as they passed.  Dang it, I knew I couldn't do it now with all those people up there.  Peaches however made it to the top.  Meanwhile I sat at the base of the tower eating my Pro Bar (they are pretty tasty) disappointed in myself for not making it to the top.  However my disappointment soon changed to laughter as they all started coming down the tower and I heard Peaches call them ""college kids"" in a friendly way and they processed to call her Ma'am.  When she came and sat by me I laughed again and said ""They called you ma'am!""  In our minds and hearts we still think we are in our early 20's and not the late 20's that we really are! Hahahahahahahaha  OK not really. 
We all visited for the next few minutes before the ""college kids"" continued on.  Now was my chance for a second attempt.  This time I went first, only being able to look at the step in front of me once I got above tree level again.  Finally I made it to the lookout!  With Peaches directions on what to hold on to I made it into the lookout!!  Yes, I still had a death grip but I was so glad I did it.  We enjoyed the view for a few minutes before heading back down.  And yes the view was AMAZING!
The hike back to the dam went quick since it was all downhill.  You can see the Shuckstack firetower from the dam, it looks so far away.  We did a quick change into less stinky clothes and headed over to the Fontana Grill for supper.  Just as we got back in the car for the two hour drive back home the rain finally arrived.
It was a great day on the AT and we both loved our ULA Circuit packs.  We head back out on the AT in a few weeks to hike Maryland!","Fontana Dam
",Shuckstack Fire Tower,"Apr 22, Sat",4.60
Almond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566039,"Yesterday we told our husbands goodbye and made the 7 hour plus drive from East Tennessee up to Harpers Ferry, WV to begin our AT hike of Maryland.  We arrived just in time to check out the town and get our AT passport books stamped at the Harpers Ferry Outfitters.  Downtown seems to close up early for food.  However we found Penny's Dinner just down the road from our hotel and enjoyed a nice supper.  We stayed at the Knights Inn in Knoxville, MD.
Peaches had made arrangements with Ms Rhonda to shuttle us up north so we could hike SOBO back to our car.  We must of been excited because we were both ready early.  We made a quick sweet tea run to McDonalds and when we returned Ms Rhonda was already there.  She suggested we park our car at the Harpers Ferry National Historic Park.  The cost is $10 for up to two weeks and they have shuttles from downtown, where we hope to finish, back to our car.  Perfect!  We followed Ms Rhonda over to the park, loaded our packs and headed north.  Ms Rhonda is truly a gift to this section of the trail.  She has a lot of good trail info and is just a fun person.  
"" Ok girls here we are!""  We started a few miles north of the MD boarder.  After a few pictures and thank you's Peaches and I began following the white blazes.  The trail was relatively easy and the wild pink azaleas were in full bloom along with a few other spring wildflowers.  We made good time to our first highlight, the Mason Dixon Line.  Maryland is Peaches homeland, so this was a bit of an emotional stop for her as we took our first steps into Maryland on the AT.  For some reason I got a little choked up too and I'm a born and bread Tennessee girl, I guess it's just a southern thing!?!
From here the trail crossed the railroad tracks and took us into Pen Mar Park.  It was crazy windy but the views were great.  This is a good place for a lunch stop or break, if you need one, but we were just getting started so we continued on.  
I've always heard about the rocks in PA so when the trail started getting rocky in MD I was a bit surprised.  Maryland rocks are sneaky!  They start of with just a few and before you know it your in the middle of a bolder field looking for a blaze on an unrecognizable trail.  Ok, maybe I just got lost in the moment before I realized I was surrounded by rocks, but nun the less the white blaze search was on.  ""There's one to your left."" ""Ok, got it!""  This was our conversation for the next little bit.  It was during this section another hiker appeared.  He was wearing an old large pack and carrying a duffel bag.  Very odd we thought.  As he approached he immediately told us he was a thru hiker and asked if we had any extra trail mix or chocolate to spare.  I told him no that we didn't pack much extra food.  He mumbled a few more things then continued on.  We both questioned his ""thru hiker"" status carrying a duffel bag.  
The rocks continued for most of the afternoon.  In a few places orange flags had been placed around the rocks to help guide you to the next blaze.  After the climb to High Rock Ledges trailhead (.2 side trail that we didn't take) the trail becomes less rocky and is a gradual downhill to the Raven Rock Shelter.  This would be our camping spot for the night.  
The Raven Rock Shelter is a nice two story shelter with bear cables and lots of good tenting and hammock sites.  We found a spot across the trail from the shelter at a site with a fire ring and a picnic table.  After camp was set up we both just relaxed for awhile.  Today was a short mileage day so we had made it to camp early.  When it was time for supper, the menu was Trail Taco Tuesday.  It really was Tuesday!LOL  Dehydrated ground beef and refried beans, salsa packs with small tortillas, and BAM it's Trail Taco Tuesday.  After supper we ate Oreos around the campfire and enjoyed it's warmth.  As the sun was starting to set I made my sweet tea for in the morning and we hung our bags on the bear cables.  We were now in our tent for the night.  It was a good first day in Maryland!","PA Route 16

Almond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566703,"Just like most of my first nights on the trail I was awake a lot.  I wasn't cold, too uncomfortable or even scared, just restless.  Every time I woke up I heard the squeaking of two tree branches rubbing against each, other than that the woods were quiet.  I woke to a cool breezy morning but the skies were blue.  We had camp broken down quickly and were on the trail a little before seven.   
**Gear review - This was the first night in my new BA Copper Spur UL3 tent.  We both loved it!  The tent goes up and down quickly and is several pounds lighter than my old tent.  The vestibules are large enough for packs and shoes.  The footprint is basically like my old tent but the sides of the BA tent are almost straight.  This gives you more room to change and not hit the side of the tent. Ventilation was good.  The rain fly is a light gray, so with a moon it kind of glows inside.  
Today's trail did not disappoint!  The rocks started early with boulders the size of cars stacked along the trail.  After crossing Raven Rock Road we rock hopped across the Little Antietam Creek.  I stopped to refill my water here.  (*Side note - Confederate forces, led by General Robert E. Lee, were making a run on Maryland to gain military supplies close to this area.  They were defeated by Union forces led by General George McClellan.  The Battle of Antietam was the bloodiest single day of the Civil War with over 23,000 casualties.  September 1862.)  As we hiked on stacked stone walls meandered through the woods.  These were remnants from farmers fields now taken back by the woods.  This section also had many different spring wildflowers, of which I felt the need to take a picture of each one. Lol  
In the next section we crossed two large fields.  These both appeared to be on private land.  We also came across a milk crate with 4 one gallon jugs of water labeled ""Trail Magic"".  Thank you trail angel!  By late morning we had made it to the Ensign Cowall Shelter.  We decided today mid morning meant lunch time.  Today's menu would be hummus and tuna wraps.  It had been windy all morning so we were hoping to be out of the wind at the shelter but wouldn't you know it the wind was blowing straight in.  Oh well, it was a nice shelter.  There are good campsites here and a bear pole.  I didn't see any bear cables.  
The after lunch trail was full of large rocks but easy to navigate.  It stayed fairly rocky till the Pogo campsite.  After Pogo the trail climbs up hill.  Just before the trail begins to descend there is a side trail to Black Rock Cliffs.  The sign is posted high on a tree and easy to miss.  We spoke with a local lady out day hiking who recommended we not pass it by.  It's just .1 off the trail and the views are amazing, she was right!
Just under a mile is the side trail to Annapolis Rocks, which we would call home for the night.  The trail to the left is to the campsites, to the right is to the spring and straight ahead is to Annapolis Rocks.  Campsite #3, which sits off the trail, was our chosen spot.  We set up camp, organized our dry sacks to hang on the bear pole and laid out our supplies for supper.  Tonight we would have supper with a view from Annapolis Rocks.  
As we headed back from hanging our dry sacks we approached two other hikers.  Peaches and I moved over to let them pass when all of a sudden the man fell.  Funny thing was he fell in slow motion, almost like it was intentional.  I was in front so I asked him if he need help up.  He said yes so I extended my hand to help him.  Then he started flailing his hand all around my arm trying to grab it.  I pulled my hand back not sure what he was doing.  He proceeded to give us a ""lesson"" on not shaking hands in the wilderness, while he was still on the ground.  That's when I said ""Well you're the one on the ground so you better take help however you can get it.""  Peaches and I just looked at each other like I can't believe I just said that!  I helped him up and he was still trying to make conversation.  The lady that was with him stood by quietly.  It appeared that my sarcasm had gone unnoticed!  
With jetboil and a Mountain House meal in hand we headed to Annapolis Rocks.  The view was amazing, we just sat around for awhile to take it all in.  After relaxing and pictures we fixed Spaghetti for supper.  What a great way to end a day of hiking!","Raven Rocks Shelter

Almond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567448,"I woke up around 3 this morning and couldn't sleep so I checked the weather for today's hike.  Hmmm it looked like we may have storms by the afternoon and into tomorrow morning.  We needed to get an early start.  I dozed off a few more times and finally woke Peaches up at 4:40 and told her we needed to get going early because of weather.  She ask what time is it and said ""Let me sleep till 5:00am.""    So I woke her up again at 4:55. Lol  As we were packing up I mentioned we may want to look at pressing on to the Ed Garvey shelter in stead of Crampton Gap, just something to consider.  This would have made our day 18.3 miles.  We were on the trail around 6:30am.  
Here we go day 3 in MD.  I was excited about our 14 miles today because of the many highlights along this section of trail.  The first one was the crossing of I-70 on the footbridge.  This is one of those spots where AT hikers have their picture made and now it was our turn.  The original Washington Monument was up next.  This monument was building by the citizens of Boonsboro, MD in 1827.  It was the first monument built in memory of President George Washington.  Next was Turner Gap which is home to the Dahlgren Chapel built in 1881 and the Old South Inn, now a restaurant, built in 18??.  Several US presidents stayed here when it was an Inn.  Other points of interest where Fox Gap, where there is a marker for two Civil War Generals that were killed.  One general was Confederate and the other Union.  Gathland State Park is also full of history but our time was short here due to weather.  One other thing to mention is how beautiful the wild flowers were on this section of the AT.  
As the day progressed and we were enjoying the sights our conversation for most of the day was about how far are we going to hike with weather coming.  We both felt like we could make it to Ed Garvey shelter but would decide once we made it to Crampton Gap Shelter.  The one crazy idea that had been mentioned was hiking back to the Knights Inn, a 23 mile day!  The only thing that kept us thinking about Knights Inn was the thought of pizza.  
We soon made it to Crampton and we agreed to press on.  Then we started talking about that pizza again.  ""Do you think we can do it?  It will be our longest day ever."" we kept saying to each other.  We decided to at least make plans to hike to Knights Inn, we knew we could always stop.  Peaches called to make sure they had rooms and get a number for pizza.  Abi answered and was so unbelievably helpful.  He remembered us from earlier in the week and told us the pizza place closed at 9:00 so just have them deliver it to the front desk.  We then texted Ms Rhonda our shuttle driver from a few days ago and asked her where we get off the trail to hike to Knights Inn.  She gave us directions and asked where we were.  Peaches told her ""Crampton Gap trying to beat the weather.""  She then told us the last part was steep and rocky to be careful.  So we were now set to go to Knights Inn if our bodies and minds would let us.
Ok, there is was the sign for Ed Garvey shelter.  Time to make a decision!  My feet were already killing me from the 18.3 miles of rocks and we were at a perfectly good shelter.  It was quite clear what we would do......we were hiking to Knights Inn!  Shortly after we passed the shelter it started to rain and was getting dark.  Peaches asked ""Do you want to put our rain covers on?""  All I said was ""No"" and kept walking, my feet were hurting sooooo bad.  Looking back we should have put them on.  Just before the trail started down hill we put our headlamps on.  Mine was so much dimmer than Peaches I had to walk behind her or all I could see was my shadow.  The trail was narrow, rocky, with switchbacks and was now super slick from the rain.  Not to mention covered with snakes!!!!!  Ok, well turns out 100% of those snakes were wet sticks but by our reaction you would have never known it. LOL  We had both been quiet for awhile, me because my feet were killing me and Peaches because she was in the lead on a dark wet trail.  However we were both watching the time because at 8:15 we were ordering our pizza.  
8:15 came and we stopped on our narrow trail to place our pizza order.  Sounds simple enough, right?  I tried first only to order with my cell but coverage was poor.  Peaches was able to get through if we stood in one particular spot.  As we placed our order I dropped my credit card and had to find it, then bend over to pick it up with my pack on and not slide down the mountain.  Oh and those ""snakes""!  Finally our pizza was ordered and we were guessing our arrival at Knights Inn would be a little after 9:00pm.
By now the rain was steady and it was a little after 9:00 before we reached the road.  From here we crossed the road and the trail went back into the woods paralleling the road.  Just as we were crossing under highway 340 I saw something reflect on the other side. ""Peaches stop!"" I whispered.  She turned around to me and ask ""Is that a person?"" I said ""I don't know have your mace ready.""  As we slowly approached armed and ready we saw that it was two bags of garbage!  Boy where ""they"" lucky.  We laughed as we walked by both agreeing we would have probably just sprayed each other.  
The AT eventually crosses another road where we made our right turn off the trail and took our 1 mile rainy road walk to the Knights Inn.  It was now after 10:00 pm.  When we arrived in the parking lot Abi met us.  He said he had mentioned our arrival to a couple of guest and they were all starting to worry.  Now how sweet is that.  We followed Abi into the lobby to take care of our room reservation and pick up our pizza.  With the paper work done he carried our pizza to our room and provided us with plates, napkins and bottled water.  To say he was looking out for us is an understatement!
We were tired, cold, wet, and both of us had sore feet, but we had done it!  This was our longest day of hiking so far and we were glad we did it.  Oh and that pizza was delicious!
Hope we can move tomorrow still have to finish Maryland!","Annapolis Rocks

Almond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567495,"This morning I was surprised to find I wasn't very sore.  Especially considering how my feet felt after yesterday's 22.6 miles.  Now all we needed was for the rain to let up and head back to the trail.   Abi had agreed to give us a later checkout last night.  This gave us a little wiggle room on the rain and we only had 4 miles to finish our hike.
By 9:00 am most of the heavy rain had pasted and we started hiking with light rain showers.  We walked 1 mile up the road to rejoin the trail.  By the time we made it to the C and O Canal Towpath the rain had stopped.  This canal and towpath predates the Civil War.  The towpath, now the present AT,  follows the canal and was used for mules to pull boats up the narrow, calm waters of the canal.  
We started hiking sections of the AT this past January and today we would complete our first 100 miles of the Appalachian Trail.  At mile 1024.3 we arrived at our 100 mile spot.  We stopped to take a few pictures and celebrate the moment.  Time to move on, we wanted to get back to the hotel in time for showers.  As the trail approaches Harpers Ferry you climb a set of stairs that leads up to a rail and trail bridge.  The bridge crosses the Potomac River and takes you to downtown Harpers Ferry.  We walked on up to St. Peter's Catholic Church and completed our hike and our first state! 
Harpers Ferry is basically owned by the NPS.  The NPS provides shuttle buses from downtown to the visitors center where we had parked three days ago.  We were the only ones on the bus which meant we got a private lesson on the history of Harpers Ferry.  Very interesting! 
We were back at the Knights Inn with just enough time for us both the clean up and out the door by straight up noon.  One final stop by the lobby to check out and thank Abi again for his wonderful hospitality.  We still had one more important AT stop before we left town, the Appalachian Trail Conservancy!  
Parking was easy right behind the building.  We were like kids in a candy store as we walked in.  Neither one of us could believe we were here.  The next 45 minutes was spent looking at everything we had only seen in pictures.  Of course we got our AT passport stamped and we both purchased AT maps.  For lunch we drove up the street to the Step in Time Bakery and had a WV Pepperoni Roll and a Panini.  Right next door is the Guide Shack Cafe' where we purchased drinks for the road. They also have their very own AT passport stamp.
Now we were headed to the eastern shore to visit Peaches' parents.  Not sure how excited they will be to see her since little Goober isn't with us!  Wait, what am I saying she is bringing her crazy friend Almond, they are going to be thrilled! Hahahahahahahaha","Knights Inn - Knoxville, MD

Almond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567906,"Today we headed back to the trail and with any luck we will complete the state of Georgia during this section.  We scheduled a shuttle to meet us at Unicoi Gap, GA at 11:00 am and take us to Deep Gap, NC.  Kat was her name and she was there waiting on us when we arrived.  It was about an hour drive over to Deep Gap and Kat knew just where to go.  On the way over she told us how busy and early the season had been with thru hikers.  The road to Deep Gap is a typical forrest service road with a parking area for about 8 cars.  When we arrived the parking area was full and there were a few hikers taking a break.  It was around 12:30 when we started our hike SOBO.  
The trail was still a little damp from recent rains which made it feel a little cushiony  under foot.  This is always a welcome treat.  It seems that NC has green mile marker signs at each mile.  Not sure if this is the entire state or begins so many miles before the border.  Either way it was fun watching the miles tick down.  
There where still several wildflowers blooming through this section.  Naturally,  I stopped to take their picture.  Our first snack break was at Water Oak Gap.  Basically just a wide place in the trail but there was a nice stealth campsite here.  The Chunky Gal Trail intersection was next.  For some reason this made us giggle like 12 year olds. Lol  The trail then took us by White Oak Stamp,  Muskrat Creek Shelter and Sassafras Gap.  About a mile past Sassafras was a beautiful view looking back toward Hiawassee.  Blue skies, warm breezes and blooming mountain laurel made this stop picture perfect.  
The famous twisted oak tree at Bly Gap was up next.  Just like most hikers, we stopped to have our picture made with her.  I'd like to think she was smiling as much as we were.  Bly Gap has several good campsites and a few hikers had already set up camp for the night.  We pressed on because we had one more thing we wanted to see before this day ended,  the NC/GA border.  
The border is just a tenth of a mile past Bly Gap.  Guess we got there quicker than we realized because we almost missed it!  Once again more pictures.  I told Peaches ""This is it, we are now going to finish GA!""  Well in two more days anyway.  Now we could call it a day.  We hiked two more miles down the trail and found a good tent site.  
Camp was set up quick and since it was still early we just relaxed for a bit.  As I was looking at our plans for tomorrow I came up with the grand idea of trying to make Tray Mountain.  That would have been a 17.7 mile day, we had done 23.3 miles just a few weeks back,  surely we could do this.  If we couldn't make Tray Mtn we would stop at Sassafras Gap.  Our plans for tomorrow were in place.  It was now time for supper, beef stroganoff.  
After supper we gathered our food and toiletries and put them in our bear bags.  The hardest part with most of the campsites is finding a suitable tree to hang your bags.  After much searching I finally found one branch that looked like our bags wouldn't be right next to the tree.  There was a fork in the branch and that's where we wanted our rope.  Peaches took a few swings at it and nailed it.  Perfect!  We hoisted our bags and turned in for the night.
Question:  Why do they call them bear bags?  It's NOT for them, I hope!","Deep Gap, NC

Almond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567943,"I'm usually the one that gets us going in the morning from camp.  However, today I though I would let Peaches pull the ""let's get going trigger.""  It was after 7:00 before she mention we should get moving.  We slowly started packing up when I guess she noticed the time and said ""Wow we are getting a late start!  Why didn't you wake me sooner?""  I told her I thought I would let her decide when to get going today.   Her response was ""That's not how we do it!  Don't change it!""  We both laughed because she was right.  I will continue to start our mornings. Lol 
I decided I needed a little water before we hit the trail.  The water source was just a puddle with little movement but it was enough for me to filter about one liter.  We were on the the trail by 8:30.  One mile down the trail was Blue Ridge Gap where we found a little trail magic.  Bottled waters were laying by the sign.  We both took one.  Thank you! 
The terrain was nothing we hadn't hiked before, but we weren't making good time.  For one reason there where more wildflowers today, and yes I was taking pictures.  Also there were quite a few ""trail steps"".  I understand their purpose for erosion but I don't care for hiking on them.  I'm slow enough already!  As we were coming down the hill to Dick's Creek Gap we could hear voices.  There where picnic tables and this was our lunch stop.  What if these voices we were hearing were taking all the tables?  Since we were VERY hungry we came up with a plan of how we could ""clear"" a table.  I'll leave that to your imagination! Lol  
We took the longest trail lunch we had ever taken, almost an hour.  For lunch we had tuna again, we are both ready for a change, drank Gatorade from our trail magic water and people watched.  With our slow pace and long lunch we knew we wouldn't make it to Tray Mtn Shelter.  Looked like it would be Sassafras Gap for the night.  Break is over we had to get moving.
About .5 down the trail there was a nice water source, Carnes Cascade.  We took the time to fill all our water and would later be glad we did.  Powell Mountain was next and our biggest climb of the day.  This mountain took it out of me.  It took over two hours to climb to the top and I just couldn't cool off.  I was drinking my water like crazy.  When we got to the top I told Peaches I didn't think I would get to Sassafras before dark.  Sassafras was still two mountain climbs away.  The trail to Deep Gap Shelter was at the bottom of the Powell Mtn where we made the decision to stop for the day.  
Deep Gap shelter is .3 off the trail.  I walked this .3 feeling totally defeated by the mountain.  I knew Peaches wanted to go on so I was already saying ""I'll make sure we start early.  I'll even set my alarm for 5:00 am.""  A few minutes later the shelter and camping area appeared.  It was beautiful, we were the only ones here and best of all there was a bear box! YES, a bear box!!  It was like Christmas and this was exactly what we had asked for.  
This was one of the best nights we had had on the trail.  Our tent site was level, we had chicken fajitas for supper at a picnic table and our packs went in the bear box.  The evening was so relaxing!   Guess the ""mountain"" knew what I needed.","Campsite past Bly Gap

Almond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568060,"At 5:00 am the alarm went off.
Since we stopped a few miles short yesterday we had to get an early start to our day.  It was still dark when we started packing up.  A couple and their dog had arrived after we were in our tent last night so we were trying to be quiet.  I went to get our packs out of the bear box.  As I walked back the tent was glowing from our headlamps and signs of the day's first light were starting to appear, such a peaceful simple sight.  It was going to be a good day.
There was a small stream that crossed the trail as we left the shelter where we both resupplied our water.  As we were finishing up the lady and her dog came to get water.  The dogs name was Cooper.  
Once back on the AT the trail starts to climb almost immediately.  I just kept a steady pace and made it to the top of Kelly Knob in short order.  There is a small albeit beautiful view from the top.  I took a few pictures while I waited on Peaches.   For the next several miles Peaches and I hiked together.  When we reached Addis Gap I was surprised to see a BMT trail diamond.  (I thru hiked the BMT in 2016 and didn't remember coming through here.  I'll have to research this!). After Addis came our along awaited Sassafras Gap.  This is where we had hoped to camp last night.  We both took our packs off for a little break.  There are several good places to camp at Sassafras but no fancy bear box. Lol  
The Swag of the Blue Ridge came next.  Two other ladies came through wanting their picture made, we obliged.  Steeltrap Gap was at the base of Tray Mountain.  There was a group of 4 NOBO hikers taking a break here.  Two of them were thru hikers the others were going as far as Dick's Creek and the NOC.  Peaches and I also took a snack break before we started our climb up Tray Mountain.  
As we climbed Tray Mountain Peaches got ahead of me.  I was having a major sinking spell.  This made the summit of Tray very exciting because I could take a 15 minute ""safety nap"".  There is a nice campsite .1 from the top of Tray.  As I passed the the campsite rhododendron and flame azaleas in bloom lined the trail to the summit.  Peaches was already in the process of taking off her shoes when I arrived.  Once again the views were not vast but still beautiful.  Small views look north and south.  The disappointing part was how small and rocky the top was.  There was only one place to halfway spread out my sleeping pad for a nap but I was going to make this work.  As I laid there in the sun watching the cloud roll by (yep just 1 cloud) you could hear the bees buzzing around the blooms.  All the while Peaches is unloading EVERYTHING in my pack to find the bug spray that I was carrying.  There were a lot of nats too!  We enjoyed another snack then packed up.  Well I packed up since my pack had been completely unloaded! Hahaha!  As we were leaving two more hikers arrived, perhaps a Daddy/Daughter team.  Perfect timing it would have been crowded with four of us.  
The descent down Tray crosses 3 gravel roads about a mile apart.  Indian Grave Gap at the base of Tray and Rocky Mountains would be our last road crossing.  The climb up Rocky Mountain was our final hurdle.  It is just as it's name implies, rocky.  Not Maryland rocky but more than we have seen the past three days.  Also those ""trail steps"" are everywhere on this section.  Did I mention how they slow me down?  Just before the summit of Rocky Mountain there is a great panoramic view to the south. 
Peaches was waiting for me at the top and we started the final descent of Georgia.  More ""trail steps""  and two good streams on the descent.  Before we knew it we were to Unicoi Gap.  We hopped off the trail together excited to have completed our second state of the Appalachian Trail.....Georgia!","Deep Gap Shelter
",Unicoi Gap,"Jun 02, Fri",13.10
Almond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/573920,"As a section hiker I am continually reading about the progress of other thru hikers while I slowly chip away the miles at my own trek to Katahdin.  Each month we (we being me and Peaches) sort out the logistics of how and when we will get back to the AT.  Usually making the process much more complicated than it needs to be.  Summer is my busy time at work so when we finally found two days off at the same time in July we were ready to hit the trail!  Two days is not long, I think if it wasn't for the 100 other obligations I would of just kept walking.
It is a two hour drive over to Deep Gap, NC from home. (I have decided we are a two hour drive from Springer Mtn, the north end of the GSMNP and all points in between. LOL)  When we were here in June the parking area was full and there were several people but today there was only one truck from Florida and no one to be seen.  I was excited this was going to be a quite day on the AT.  
The weather was nice for a July day in the south.  White rhododendrons where still in bloom along with the summer wildflowers dressed in yellow, red, white and purple.  The Standing Indian Shelter is just a short ways up the the trail.  I took the blue blaze trail to check it out and take a few pictures while Peaches waited back at the trail and enjoyed a granola bar.  I take a lot of pictures! ;)
Our next point of interest was the summit of Standing Indian Mountain.  We had set our morning pace for the two mile climb when from behind I heard a concerned yell from Peaches.  ""Hey Almond wait a minute!""  I turned around to make sure she was ok.  ""I can't find my phone!""  Relieved she was ok but I knew we had to find her phone, mainly because of all the pictures of little Goober.  She remembered having it at the shelter where she took a picture of the sign.  So back down the mountain we went slowly looking for her phone.  
Peaches was now out of sight so I made our owl call.  She responded back but still no luck finding the phone.  A few minutes later I made the owl call one more time to see if she had had any luck.  No sooner had I gone ""hoo hoo"" when a group of hikers came around the turn.  I felt a little silly!  As they approached they said ""You must be Almond.""  I knew then they had talked to Peaches or our owl call is more famous on the AT than I realized!  It was the first.  They had found the phone and recognized her by the family hiking picture on her screen.  Yeah!!  We then began our second climb up Standing Indian Mountain.  
There are several nice peek views along the way to the summit.  Our next excitement came when I stepped on a yellow jackets nest.  I must of stepped on a few because  with one innocent step angry buzzing ensued.  I took off running up the mountain screaming ""KEEP RUNNING, YELLOW JACKETS"".  Once we felt like it was safe to stop running we both just started laughing.  Peaches said ""Well at least you know you can run with your pack on!""  Hahahaha!
There is a beautiful view from the summit which we decided to forgo since we were a little behind schedule.  Looking back I wish we would have taken the time.  Oh well lesson learned, take time to enjoy the view.  The trek down the mountain was full of brightly colored wildflowers.  The flowers led us to Beech Gap where we had our ""lunch nap"": sleeping pads out, shoes off and tuna wraps prepared.  We are both getting tired of tuna lunches.  There are several good camping spots at Beech Gap.  However our relaxing lunch stop was cut a little short by the sound of distant thunder.  It was time to move on.
After lunch Peaches leg started to hurt.  The Carter Gap Shelter was 3.2 miles ahead.  We would decide there if we were to keep going for the day.  The trail was in good condition with a few stream crossings.  Once at Carter Gap we took our packs off for a short break.  The floor to the old shelter is still here with the new shelter just up the hill.  I had cell service so I checked the radar.   Even though the thunder sounded close all the bad weather appeared to be moving away from us.   The next listed camping site was at Betty Creek Gap 3.7 miles away.  It was still early in the day, it was up to Peaches to decide if we would hike on since her leg was hurting.  She wanted to continue so off we went.  
As I have said before a take a lot of pictures, especially of flowers.  So I was excited to finally see a Turk's Cap Lily blooming.  This is a beautiful tall orange lily with brown spekals on the curled petals.  It almost glows under the canopy of the forest.  It wasn't to much further till we reached some of the worst 2016 fire damage I had seen.  It was like hiking in black and white.  The trail was almost void of color until we came across an outcropping view.  From here you could see the green valley and the blue mountains, not to mention the rain that was coming.  We picked up the pace for the final two miles mostly in a soft rain.  Just a few tenth from Betty Creek Gap we came across a great stealth site that would of probably had wonderful sunrise view but we continued down to the Gap.  Mistake, we should of stopped at the stealth site!  There were ""No Camping Signs"" posted for the best spots at Betty Creek Gap.  Our guide book said there were more spots down the Betty Creek Trail which I went to explore, Peaches leg was really hurting by now.  I only found a few small spots in the middle of rhododendron thickets.  Our choices were to go back up the trail or camp here and hope we are far enough from where they don't want us to camp.  We stayed there!  
Once camp was set up Peaches took a nap and I went to explored the area a little more.  I heard a big tree fall down the Betty Creek Trail and was glad we hadn't camped down there.  As 7:30 drew near I began to fix supper.  I woke Peaches up by saying ""Peaches tell me when 10 minutes is up.  That's when supper will be ready.""  She responded with a sleepy ""OK"".
After eating our delicious lasagna we gathered our ""smellables"" and hung our bear bag.  As usual there was only one slightly adequate tree limb.  Peaches tossed the rope and we hoisted up our supplies.  We were in our tent by 8:40.  However it was after 10:00 before we fell asleep.   First we got the giggles and everything we said was funny.  Then we entertained ourselves by watching our past AT movies.  We have a video from every AT section hike so far.  Probably only entertaining to us!

About a mile up the trail, just passed Mooney Gap, we came across a great water source from a culvert.  There was also a nice stealth campsite.  The packs came off and while Peaches went to filter water I found a breakfast snack and changed into shorts.  We were now ready for the Albert Mountain climb.
Climb is an understatement!  It was a short .3 from the foot of Albert Mountain to the summit but this mountain did not want to disappoint.  We were now rock climbing and rock crawling up the mountain and loving every minute!  Trekking poles were more of a hindrance than a help.  Peaches threw hers up the trail and kept climbing.  I on the other hand I laid mine on the rock above my head then repeated.  In all honesty if I had thrown mine there is really no telling where I would have ended up.  LOL  It took us 25 minutes to go .3 of a mile, now that's just comical!!!!!
Was the climb worth it you ask?  ABSOLUTELY!  The clouds were starting lift giving way to a 360 degree mountain view from the firetower.  The lookout area was locked, that was a little disappointing,  but we hung out on the upper landing for quite sometime taking in the views.  I'll let you in on a little secret...climbing firetowers scares the bageezes out of me.  However, I know if I don't do it I'll regret it later.  We enjoyed lunch at the base of the tower, tuna again.  As we were packing up to go a group of hikers came ""crawling"" in.  We exchanged pleasantries and continued on.  We had the firetower all to ourselves for an hour.  Now that was an hour well spent.  
The next 9 miles were mostly down hill with one final climb 3 miles before Winding Stair Gap.  There was plenty of water on this section.  We stopped to filter water at a nice stream near the Long Branch Shelter.  Our afternoon snacks were blackberries that we found growing at Rock Gap.  When we reached Wallace Gap we were doing good on time so we took a road side break:  sleeping pads out and shoes off.  Man 25 minutes sure goes by fast some days.  
Just as we were about to cross the road a small but loud truck pulls over.  A rather large man with a little dog leans out the window and ask if we were hiking.  I was still making some pack adjustments so I halfway ignored him.  That is until Peaches turned around with big eyes looking at me!  I then said ""Yes"".  He offered us a cold beer, which  he just happened to have with him, and Peaches politely declined.  He then went on to ask if we were NOBO or SOBO and if we had trail names yet.  Peaches told him we were SOBO and used our husbands trail names.  Which we laughed about later since trail names are made up anyway.  Guess we are getting a little attached to ours and didn't want to share them. LOL  He offered us a cold beer one more time, to which we said no thank you, before he drove off disappearing around the mountain road.  It was a somewhat odd experience but I really just think he was a local that drove by and saw us napping, grabbed some cold beers and came back just to be nice.  
The final climb had scars from fires but what was blooming were the wildflowers.  It was amazing to see the beauty amongst the scars.  The next 3 miles went fairly quickly and we arrived at Winding Stair Gap by 6:00.  As we waited for our shuttle it started to lightly rain.  This actually felt pretty good.  At 6:15 we saw our ""shuttle service"" zoom by the parking spot.  They were back to get us however in under a minute.  I say ""they"" because our husbands came to retrieve us this time and take us back to Deep Gap to get my car.  They did make us ride in the BACK of the truck to Deep Gap.  Guess we didn't smell like all those wildflowers!","Betty Creek Gap

Almond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577724,"On the road again!  It was another early morning and we were headed back to the AT for our next section hike.  My Daddy was our shuttle driver today.  He followed us to Winding Stair Gap, where I left my car.  Then we all 3 hopped in his truck and he took us to Tellico Gap.  
Yes, that's right I said 3, a first for me and Peaches.  Today our friend LongArms went with us.  This was her first AT backpacking trip and she was so excited.  She borrowed some of Tater's hiking gear gathered her snacks and was ready for her girls backpacking trip.  In full disclosure I was a little uncertain how this would go.  I never doubted her ability, she runs marathons for heavens sake, but I wasn't sure if she would enjoy the whole backpacking experience.  I also wasn't sure if we would be good trail hostess.  However I was excited for the unknown.
Just as most of our drop offs go something funny usually happens and this one was no different, I think Peaches and I burst out laughing at the same time.  I'll save that story for another time however.  Daddy successfully dropped us off by an AT sign at Tellico Gap in the middle of nowhere.  He took a few pictures for us, I gave him a hug, I love you and thanked him, and we headed SOBO.
About a mile and a half down the trail we came across a camp site with a register box. We told LongArms about the registers and let her have the honor of signing.  This was fun introducing someone to AT life.  Then LongArms said ""I think I need to go to the bathroom.""  We helped her take her pack off and she proceeds to pull out and entire roll of toilet paper.  Peaches and I both laughed and asked her how long was she planning on staying out here.  She laughed too and said ""Y'all just said bring toilet paper!""  She was right, oops!
Our first summit was Rocky Bald.  As we were nearing the top LongArms started finding North Carolina gold, aka Mica.  She asked us if we thought it was gold and I said ""Yes it is gold....fools gold.""  Once again we were laughing as we took the short side trail to Rocky Bald.  We took advantage of the large rocks to rest and have lunch.  Peaches and I still have the food and gear split between our packs.  So for this hike she is carrying extra lunch and I am carrying supper for 3 people. 
The Cold Spring Gap Shelter was next.  This shelter is a little unusual in that it sits right on the trail.  So much so I think the trail curves just to get around it.  This was fun to see since I had read about this shelter in other trail journals.
At the base of the mountain we reached Burningtown Gap, now there's a name I'd like to know the story behind.  A strange white van was parked here which made us a little nervous.  As we approach the van it had a University of Alabama sticker on it.  See I told you it was strange, Go Vols!!  The path back into the woods was lined with beautiful yellow wild flowers and butterflies all around.  It was almost magical.  
The rest of the afternoon was nice hiking with one small rest break where three grass forest service roads cross.  LongArms was back on her cell phone and we chuckled that she was going to lose her phone privileges if she keeps getting on the phone during breaks.  We were kidding of course, well kinda. 
Our planned stop was the Wayah Shelter which was a descent climb for the last mile.  I was feeling so good hiking today and had pressed on ahead the last bit.  When I reached the shelter I saw just what I was afraid of, lots of people.  We hadn't seen a sole all day which meant the Bama fans could only be one place and that was at Wayah Shelter.  Peaches arrived in short order also feeling good.  We both took a look around and found only one semi decent tent spot.  We were both ok with pressing on.   When LongArms arrived she was done hiking for the day.
Our guides showed a campsite .3 up the trail.  Since I was feeling good I decided to hike up and take a look.  Peaches stayed back with LongArms to rest.  When I reached the campsite there where more No Camping signs in the camping area.  I'm beginning the think NC stands for No Camping instead of North Carolina!  Most of the campsites in NC have had No Camping signs.  I headed back down the trail only the meet LongArms and Peaches heading up the trail.  Not the mention Peaches was carrying both our packs, I had left mine at the shelter.   ""So I guess we are staying up here?"" I asked.  
We spent the next 30 minutes trying to find a good spot out of the no camping area.  Finally Peaches and I had the tent set up.  We found a place to hang our bear bag and the fixed supper.  Tonight's menu was Chicken with rice and a chocolate mousse dessert.  Yummy!  
Peaches and I gathered all our ""smellables"" and hoisted the bear bag up.  LongArms was back at camp getting situated for the night.  We hike with a BIg Agnus UL3 Copper Spur tent.  I carry the poles, stakes and ground cover and Peaches carries the tent.  This was the first time we had 3 people in the tent.  It's very doable, but snug.  
It was a good thing we weren't at the shelter because for the next hour we talked and laughed till we cried.  LongArms had a good 1st day on the AT and I hope we have been good trail hostess.","Tellico Gap
",Stealth Campsite Mile 120.2,"Aug 15, Tue",8.70
Almond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/577731,"Today we were on the trail before 8am.  A nice water source was just a few tenths up the trail so we took the time to filter water.  This would get us through the day.  From camp we had a .6 mile climb to reach Wayah Bald.  Along the way asters were blooming and dew covered spider webs sparkled in the morning sun.  All of a sudden we reach Wayah Bald and saw the majestic stone observation tower keeping watch over the surrounding mountains.  From the tower there is a 360' view.  Thick fog had settled in the valleys which highlighted the extensive fire damage from the fall of 2016.  The fires actually burned the wooden roof off the tower.  All that remains from the roof are two post with charred wooden logs.  There is a picnic area, restrooms and trash cans on the bald, and seems to be a nice road to drive to it.  I could have stayed here all morning but we had more miles to cover.  
The late morning trail was quite and the 3 of us spread out, hiking at our own paces.  I really enjoy hiking alone, taking pictures of flowers and critters along the way, all the while knowing in short order I'll meet up with a friend on the trail.  I tried not to get to far ahead of LongArms, so I was usually in ""owl calling"" distance.  We all 3 joined back up at Wayah Gap sharing our morning experiences from the trail.  
It was now approaching lunchtime but with Siler Bald just 1.6 ahead we all were ok with waiting. Even though it was 1.6 miles of uphill.  We all hiked together for a bit but SLOWLY Peaches and I began to pull away.  I'm not good at changing my pace on a climb, I keep a slow  steady pace and usually don't stop.  The AT comes out at the base of Siler Bald leaving another .3 mile climb off the AT to reach the summit.  With the afternoon starting to warm up Peaches and I waited for LongArms at the base in the shade.  As we waited looking up the steep hill I told Peaches I didn't have to see the top unless everyone else wanted to, knowing deep down I wanted to see it.  I'm not sure if I was just trying to make it ok in my mind if LongArms didn't want to or I was being a little lazy!  A couple had hiked down from the Bald and told us how beautiful it was about the time LongArms arrived.  Guess they decided for us because we headed up the mountain.  
The view was spectacular but the actual top of the Bald was much smaller than I had imagined.  There was a tent using the best picnic spot and today there was no breeze, usually mountain tops have a nice breeze.  We enjoyed the view, took a few pictures and headed halfway down the Bald where there was a nice shady spot for lunch.  Peaches and I are tired of eating tuna so we gave that to LongArms, it was bison jerky and cheese for us.  During lunch a young man in PJ's carrying a large chicken of the woods mushroom came by.  He asked if we were camping there and said he was in the tent at the top.  As he walked on Peaches and I joked that we should give him our tuna.  Looking back we both wished we really had given him our tuna,  maybe he needed it.?.
As we finished lunch gray clouds began to roll in and we could hear thunder in the distance.  It was time to get moving.  We hadn't been on the trail 20 minutes when the skies let loose.  We hurriedly put our pack covers on and splashed on down the trail.  This was a typical summertime rain so it only lasted about 30 minutes.  With the trail now slick and downhill we hiked the rest of the day together.  When we reached the final mile we told LongArms it was her time to lead the hike to the finish.  Approaching Winding Stair there is a nice creek crossing and a waterfall.  A lovely way to end a hike.
Once back at my car it was time to get into clean clothes and go eat.  LongArms asked us where we were going to change.  Peaches and I just looked at each other and said ""Right here.""  Yep, I think she thought we were crazy!  However after we changed and started talking food she stripped down and changed in no time! Hahahaha. Our after hike meal was at ""The Best L'il Corner Ice Cream Parlor and More"", cheeseburgers and ice cream for the 3 of us.  Great little 2 day hike.
Next month Peaches and I hope to make it to Fontana Dam.","Stealth Campsite Mile 120.2
",Winding Stair Gap,"Aug 16, Wed",10.70
Almond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580342,"Here we go again, an early start back to the trail.  Today we drove to Fontana Dam to meet our shuttle driver, Mike.  It was an hour drive to Tellico Gap where we would began our 4 day section hike NoBo back to Fontana Dam.
It was a cool damp September morning as we began the climb from Tellico Gap.  You could smell fall in the air, autumn wildflowers were beginning to bloom and leaves were starting to show a hint of color.  Yes, fall seemed to be anxious to arrive, but this is the south and summer doesn't give up that easily.  About a half mile from Wesser Bald look out tower the fog had rolled in.  We passed 4 SoBo hikers that told us the views were great from the tower that the fog had rolled out.   This put a little pep in our step hopeful we would have the same luck. We had no such luck!  We did manage to get a few passing views which are beautiful in there own way.  
The trail continues down the mountain to the Wesser Bald Shelter, then continues along the ridge top for over a mile.  The ridge top section had quite a bit of fire damage and was mostly disingenuous trees that had not fully recovered.  This gave us unexpected views along the ridge.  I must say it was an unusual site with the trees looking like the dead winter and the forest floor covered in green with wildflowers blooming.  Speaking of wildflowers this area is where a saw the ""wild"" butterfly bushes.  Not sure if these are always here or a product of the fires but I have never seen them growing wild.  Either way they seemed happy.  
We had one more spectacular view as we began the 5 mile decent to the NOC, it was called ""the jump off"".  The name made perfect since because one wrong step and gravity was going to take over. Lol  Shortly after beginning the descent I came across a flower I couldn't believe I was seeing.  It was a large cluster of Bleeding Hearts!  It's not that this flower is rare but I have only seen it blooming in early spring.  I'm guessing the altitude and a nice shady spot lets us enjoy the Bleeding Hearts near the end of summer.  Whatever the reason they were fun to see.  
It was 3 o'clock when we made it to the Rufus Morgan Shelter.  The shelter looked nice with plenty of campsites.  Although we hadn't stopped for lunch we were much to close to the NOC to even consider stopping to eat.  In short order we could hear cars and then there it was, the NOC our home for the night. 
We crossed the street and checked into NOC basecamp at the General Store.  We were assigned the Kephart building room 4.  Considering we have never stayed in a hostel or basecamp we were excited to see what this was all about.  Our room had a bunk bed, outlets, heater, a bench to sit on and hooks to hang our clothes.  I was ""given"" the top bunk since I'm the short one and the ceiling was low. Hahahaha We quickly changed into clean clothes and headed over to the restaurant for supper.  Supper was pizza and a burger that we shared.
After supper we spent a little time relaxing by the river, talking about the days hike and the climb that lay ahead of us tomorrow.  As the sunset we returned to the warmth of our basecamp room.  Even though it was past hiker midnight neither of us could pass up a shower! Clean and warm makes for a good nights sleep!","Tellico Gap
",NOC Basecamp ,"Sep 06, Wed",8.20
Almond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580343,"The nice thing about staying at NOC was we were able to have a good breakfast. Usually we just start hiking and have a snack for breakfast as we hike.  We even got to go coffee and sweet tea.  After breakfast the outfitter had opened so we went to get our AT passports stamped before continuing on.
The AT is the bridge that crosses over the Nantahala river,  meanders through the NOC grounds,  crosses the railroad tracks, then into the woods for a seven mile climb.  I had gotten a little ahead of Peaches this morning and waited for her at Wright Gap which crosses a gravel forest service road.  As I waited I heard a car coming so I ran back down the trail out of site.  Sometimes my mind gets the best of me when I'm by myself and I think every car is out the get me.  It ended up being a utility truck doing maintenance in the area.  Lol  I got tired of standing around so I crossed the road and continued slowly up the mountain.  As I approached the first switchback I turned and gave our owl call down the trail.  No response, hmmmmm, I wondered where she was.  I made a few more calls and finally got a response.  I waited to hear her story.  Turns out Peaches also saw the parked truck and was thinking the worst too.  ""I thought they might have kidnapped you.  Then I saw I was a utility truck!"" she said.  Hahahahaha 
I was feeling so good today, even with the climb.  Maybe there is something to eating a good breakfast.  Just before the Wade Sutton memorial I heard music coming up the trail.  I'm guessing he was a SOBO thru hiker from his pace, pack and the ""thru hiker perfume"" he was wearing.  We nodded said hello and hiked on.  I came upon a nice open area with good sitting logs and had a snack as I waited for Peaches.  The first thing she asked me when she got there was ""Do you think that hiker was a thru hiker?""  I said ""Yep, why do you think he was?"" and we both laughed.  
Peaches and I hiked our own pace today which meant most of the day I hiked alone.  This particular day I was in the lead but other days it's Peaches, there's really no rhyme or reason for us.  I do think I enjoy hiking alone a little more than Peaches does.  She mentioned to me later it was a little lonely hiking by herself that day.  I did wait for her a water sources just in case we needed to filter water.  Shortly after we had stopped to filter water we came to the spot know as the Jump up.  The views were nice and you could see the Nantahala river far below.  We even saw a big lizard sunning on a rock.  
Our next meet up stop was the Sassafras Gap Shelter.  Here we took our packs off and  enjoyed a small lunch.  This was a nice little shelter in a hollow with a good water source.  We resupplied all our water so we would have enough for supper later.  
The last .9 we stayed together.  This was the steepest part of the day but boy was it worth it!  Cheoah Bald is the best campsite we have had on our AT journey thus far!  IMO We both just stood there amazed this was our home for the night.  We took a few pictures and then began to set up camp. (Ok, I took a lot of pictures.)  After we set up a couple arrived and set up on the other side of the trail.  They were just as taken aback by the view as we were.  We then found a place for our bear bags and prepared supper.  Just after supper a rabbit appeared from the woods.  This was the first rabbit I had seen on the AT.  Now I know for most seeing a rabbit is not a big deal but for me it was pretty special.
The sun was close to setting so we prepared and hung bear bags.  We then walked down to a small outcropping of rocks to watch the sunset on the west side of Cheoah Bald.  The couple that arrived earlier was there too and we enjoy a nice conversation as we watched the sun finish its work day.
Once we were back in our tent for the night it was breezy for awhile.  However once the wind died down this was probably the quietest I have ""heard"" the night.  No birds, no cricket, no frogs, nothing but silence, but I was certain there was a little rabbit sleeping close by.","NOC Basecamp 
",Cheoah Bald,"Sep 07, Thu",7.70
Almond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580363,"I was awake this morning by 6:30 waiting for the sunrise.  Unlike the quiet of the night the morning came with a light breeze and a few birds chirping to welcome the day.  This time of year the sunset is easier to see than the sunrise, but it is equally as beautiful as the sky turns from orange to blue, the sun kisses the mountain tops and the fog below gets brighter with each passing moment.  It was official, the day had begun.  
Peaches and I slowly broke down camp enjoying our time on Cheoah Bald as long as possible.  As you may remember yesterday was uphill, so guess how today started?  Yep, 5.7 miles of mostly downhill.  Peaches is faster than me downhill so she got ahead of me in short order.  She waited for me at Simp Gap where we prepared our new lunch of chicken salad from Pack-it-Gourmet.  All we had to do was add cold water and hope it would be ready by the time we reached Stecoah Gap, 2 miles ahead.  
When I arrived at Stecoah Gap Peaches had taken off her pack at a picnic table and was checking on our lunch.  She carries lunch and I carry dinner.  This is a lovely lunch spot with trash cans, picnic tables and a great view.  I was cool once I stopped hiking so I put on my windbreaker and took off my shoes to relax.  Our lunch turned out very good, chicken salad on ritz crackers.  As we ate several hikers came off the trail and then a local shuttle driver spoke to us.  He was on his lunch break and thought he would come see if any hikers were here.  Neat!  One hiker came off looking for water.  The guide book says there is a piped spring but he couldn't find it.  Not sure if he ever did but we later saw him continuing NOBO.  After a 50 minute stop we too headed NOBO.  This is a very long stop for us, but boy did we enjoy it.  
We now had over 2 miles of climbing and I was SLOWLY pulling away from Peaches.  I say slowly because this was probably the steepest we had seen the trail.  It was almost comical how slow I was going but I kept my same routine and didn't stop.  This climb was called ""Jacobs Ladder"" in the guidebook. (Genesis 28:10-17 if your interested)  I finally made it to the summit and continued .2 more to a side trail which led to the Brown Fork Gap Shelter.  We were both going to need water soon so I waited for Peaches at the trailhead.  I didn't know how far I was ahead of her and didn't want her to think I went on.  I took my pack off and waited.  When Peaches arrived she said ""I was starting to get nervous because I didn't know it you had gone to the overlook or went on,  then I thought I heard and bear and I also heard a tree fall!""  I replied and laughed saying ""Wow, you have had an exciting afternoon!""
We took .1 side trail down to the shelter where we met the hiker looking for water at Stecoah Gap earlier in the day.  He was eating supper and already set up for the night.  When we told him we were just filtering water and continuing on he was a little surprised since it was over 6 miles to the next shelter.  We just let him think that but these two girls where going to be pitching a tent in about 3 miles.  Lol 
The next 3 miles we hiked together.  We had one very large tree that we had to bushwhacked around and then a few rocky sections.  I knew we were both getting tired because when we saw the rocks we both just sighed!  On paper this little section looked easy.
Cody Gap is where we set up camp.  There are several good camp spots here but some are close to the trail.  We found a nice spot off the trail and set up camp.  I set the tent up while Peaches went to look for a bear bag tree.  Once we were set up we tried another new meal from Pack-it-Gourmet, Hamburger trail style.  We were pleasantly surprised it was good too.  After supper clean up we hung our smellables and were off to bed.  Tomorrow we reach a milestone!","Cheoah Bald
",Cody Gap,"Sep 08, Fri",10.90
Almond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580930,"Our plan was to start earlier today so we could make it to the restaurant in Fontana for supper.  We make a lot of decisions around food!  Knowing that I had to get up early made my sleep even more restless than usual.  I was awake every hour until 4:00.  That's when exhaustion must of kicked in because Peaches said about 5:00 she told me she was going to get the bear bag and I didn't move.  I didn't hear her leave or come back, normally I'm the first one up.
We were on the trail by 6:45, which is earlier than usual for us.  It was a nice cool September morning.  An hour into our hike we came across a spring and decided to resupply our water.  We had used a fair amount of water for last nights supper.  This would get us through the rest of the day.  
The fog was rolling across the road when we reached Yellow Creek Gap.  With the sun was beaming through in spots the scene looked magical.  As we reentered the woods we were startled by 3 dogs.  Not that we were afraid of the dogs, but at first in our minds they were bears! Lol  Their master wasn't to far behind them and they all seemed to be enjoying their morning hike.  Come to find out they all had been rescued.  I just love a good dog story!
We made good time to the Cable Gap Shelter.  This shelter is right on the trail and had room for several tents.  It was to soon for a break so we continued on with a 2 mile climb.  **Our milestone was coming up just before Walker Gap, this would be our 200th AT mile.  When we reached this point we wrote 200 in the dirt and decide the enjoy a snack lunch.  Now we realize to a thru hiker this is not a big deal, but to a section hiker chipping away at the trail 30 miles at a time as often as we can this was something the celebrate!!!
After our celebration lunch the rest of the day was basically down hill.  This section is literally a walk in the woods with no views.  We did have several down trees to climb over, around and through on our descent to Fontana Lake.  A few tenths before the lake we crossed a dirt road where the AT and the BMT join back up.  Now I was on familiar ground.  This section of the BMT is where Taz joined me last year on my BMT thru hike.    The BMT was where I fell in love with hiking.  
From the Fontana marina the trail follows the shoreline, although about 100 feet above the lake, all the way to Fontana Dam.  Once again there were quite a few down trees to navigate around.  This area must had seen some recent winds.  Less than a mile from the dam we came across the famous ""Fontana Dam Hilton"" shelter.  As shelters go this is a Hilton.  There is a beautiful view, a bathhouse with hot water, charging stations and lots of room for tents.  We were to close to our finish to do more that take a quick picture and continue on.  It was a road walk from the shelter to the dam.  When Fontana Dam came into sight I ran to the finish so I could make my goal of finishing by 4:00.  I had a minute to spare! Lol
The Fontana Dam Visitors Center also has a girl and a boys shower room.  So before Peaches and I headed to the restaurant we were able to take showers and change into clean clothes.  I sure felt better but the delay made me even hungrier.  Once at the restaurant I ordered a pitcher of sweet tea with a straw and Peaches threw in an order of loaded nachos.  Yep, that was just to get us started.
With full tummies we headed back down the ""dragon"" toward home.  We were happy to have made it to Fontana before October.  Smokies here we come! 
**Funny thing!  We were off on our miles about 4 miles.  So our 200th mile was yesterday! Hahahahaha","Cody Gap

Almond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580931,"Yesterday we headed up to the Tapoco Lodge for a relaxing evening so we would be close to Fontana Dam for the start of our Smokies section of the AT the next day.  We being me, Taz, Peaches, Tater and Goober.  
Our original plan all year has been to thru hike the Smokies section but Peaches wasn't feeling good about a week prior to our hike and agreed to hike if we were picked up at Climgman's Dome.  Time will tell, but it's not looking good that we will finish the Smokies in October.  Guess I'm selfishly pretty bummed about that because October 14, 2016, one year ago today, is when I finished my BMT thru hike.  So here I am one year later to the day lacking only the Smokies to complete the BMT/AT loops in October 2017.  I'm just a little disappointed in myself that I couldn't pull them both off in October.  Oh well if that's my biggest worry I guess things are going pretty good! 
Today is hiking day, and it started with a nice breakfast at the Tapoco Lodge.  After breakfast Peaches and I repacked our backpacks one last time.  As we were leaving the lodge we saw another hiker and Taz ask him where we was headed.  He responded ""Springer Mountain on the BMT.""  Well when anyone says BMT that gets my attention!  Taz went on to tell him that I had thru hiked the BMT last year.  I was sitting quietly in the backseat and thought I should at least say hello, so I rolled down my window.  As soon as he saw me he said ""Hey I know you!  I read your BMT trail journal,  it was really good and helpful.  Wait a minute I know all of you!  You were all mention in the trail journal.""  We felt like reality trail stars!  I told him ""thank you"" and we talked BMT for a few more minutes.  Good luck Highloom with your BMT hike. 
 The road across Fontana Dam was actually open today so our guys were able to drive us to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park entrance.  I few pictures and Peaches and I where off.  It was noon before we got on the trail but we only had 5.3 miles to reach our campsite, #119 Birch Springs.  
Most of today was a continuous climb.  The first part of the hike was warm, sticky, still air but within an hour the winds had picked up with scattered rain showers.  Which felt great!  This section has only one beautiful view about .5 mile before the Shuckstack Firetower.  The firetower is only .1 off the AT so we decided to go take a look.  Unfortunately there were no views from the firetower today because of the clouds, so we didn't climb it.  We did climb it back in April and the views are spectacular from the top!  Although it does give me the heebeegeebees up there! 
Our campsite was 1.3 miles from Shuckstack.  When we arrived bear warning signs were everywhere.  Earlier in the summer this site was closed due to an aggressive bear.  This is actually a nice site with about seven level designated campsites.  There are also two sets of bear cables and a fire pit area where it is recommended you eat your meals.  We first picked site 6 but on further investigation there was evidence of bears so we moved to spot 2.  
Once settled in with the tent up and clean clothes on we went to the fire pit to prepare a wonderful supper of Chili Mac.  While that rehydrated we filtered our water for tomorrow.  A couple from Manchester, TN had started a fire and we visited with them for awhile.  Then two girls from Nashville came to sit around the fire.  They were camping by us with 2 other friends.  There was also a lady hiking by herself but I only spoke to her when she arrived.  
It was now dark, 8:00 pm, and Peaches and I thought we should turn in.  We put our food in the Ursak and put that inside our packs.  We then put both of our packs in a garbage bag just in case it rained and hoisted the bear cable up.
About 9:00 pm it started to rain!  It has now been raining steady for 30 minutes.  It sounds like we're sleeping in a popcorn popper! Lol  I mentioned to Peaches ""Our bags are going to be nice and dry in the morning or soaking wet because the garbage bag is filling up with water!"" Hahahaha. Did I put a hole in the bottom? Nope!  I really thought this garbage bag would help with morning dew or a passing shower, not a steady all night rain.  Me and my silly ideas!

Almond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580932,"It rained all night right into morning.  These are the kind of days on the trail where it is hard to get moving, the cold rainy kind.  I woke Peaches a little after 7:00 with the hopes we would be moving by 7:30.  I knew we weren't going to accomplish our morning chores any to fast.  I changed clothes and packed up what I could of mine.  Then I went to the bear cables to retrieve our packs.  Once back at the tent I slowly took the garbage bag off hoping they were mostly dry.  To my surprise they were just a little wet on the very top.  Success! 
We left camp just before 9:00.  To be honest there is not much to say about the trail today but cold, windy, foggy and rainy.  The leaves are staring to change nicely and they didn't seem to mind the weather.  The best thing I could do on a day like today is keep moving.  I got a little ahead of Peaches and waited for her at the Gregory Bald Trail intersection.  It didn't take me long to figure out how fast I got cold when I quit moving.  So I started jumping up and down just to keep warm.  Of course 2 people come down the trail as I am doing this nonsense.  Guess they had been in this situation before because they both asked ""Trying to keep warm?""  I responded with ""Ah yes, waiting on my friend she should be here soon.""  As they hiked down the trail I was thinking ""Peaches please get here soon, I'm dyeing!""
We have been trying different hydration systems the past few hikes which is letting us carry less water but we have to stop more frequently to filter.  Today we came across a blue blazed trail which our guide showed to have piped water.  Well we never found the pipe, and even though there was plenty of water none of it was easy to filter.  The area was so wet and muddy that we couldn't even find a place to sit our packs.  Our packs stayed on as we filter water.  That wasn't a big deal until Peaches realized she couldn't get to our lunch that we were going to rehydrate with cold water.  That's when I said ""Give me your pack. I'll wear it on the front while you dig for lunch.""  This plan worked perfectly, especially since I'm the short one. Lol  Our lunch should be ready soon.  
Almost an hour after our water stop we arrived at Mollies Ridge shelter.  Thank goodness, I was ready to get out of the wind and have a little lunch.  Our lunch was chicken salad from Pack-it-gourmet and it hit the spot.  We also treated ourselves to a few Oreos.  Once again stopping meant getting cold so our break was only 25 minutes and we were on the move.  
By 3:30 the clouds were being to lift.  When reached the Russel Field Shelter blues skies were above but it was still cool and windy.  From here it was 3 more miles to the Spence Field Shelter, our home for the night. 
When we reached Spence the couple from Manchester was there and 4 teenage boys on fall break.  After a few hellos we set up our sleeping bags on the bottom level and then went down to the privy area to change into our camp/sleeping clothes.  I'm never good at knowing how, where or when to change clothes at a shelter with other people around.  This is why I prefer a tent!  Nun the less we got the job done and  started fixing supper.  Sincere we had a cold wet day I chose our favorite MH meal, chicken fajita bowl, to warm us up.  We even enjoyed some hot chocolate.  
After supper we went down the hill to a very good piped spring to filter our water for tomorrow.  The sun was disappearing fast and we hung our packs on the bear cables in the dark.  Two more hikers showed up after we had turned in.  Since I couldn't sleep I watched them go about there camp chores.  
I did have good Verizon cell service here.  This was good in that I sent a message home bad in that I forgot to turn my phone off and got a call for late night work at my ""dairy farm"".  So to work I go texting the guys to make sure things were taken care of.  As usual they had it under control and were probably wishing I would turn my phone off.  So that's what I did!","Birch Spring Campsite
",Spence Field Shelter,"Oct 16, Mon",11.10
Almond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580933,"I was wake just before first light and watched a few other hikers, from my warm sleeping bag, scurrying around in the dark preparing their breakfast.  I typically don't eat breakfast but have a snack after I've been hiking for 30-45 minutes.  The sky was getting brighter and it was time to leave the comfort of my sleeping bag and get the day started. 
I had kept my clothes in my sleeping bag so I was able to dress quickly behind the shelter.  Peaches was starting to stir around so I went to get our packs down.  It was time to start packing up.  The sun was now up with blue skies all around and a little ""frost on the pumpkin"" as they say.  It was going to be a glorious day for hiking.  
There was a pep in my step since the highlight of the day was a mile up the trail.  There it was, the one and only Rocky Top.  I couldn't believe I had actually hike to the top of ROCKY TOP!  The 360 degree views where stunning, looking east was North Carolina and looking west was, my country, Tennessee.  The couple from Manchester, TN was also enjoying the Rocky Top views.  We joked that if the views stay like this we were going to take all day to reach the Siler's Bald Shelter.  After they left Peaches rested on a rock as took pictures from every direction.  I also decided I would eat my breakfast snack here, hoping this would give me more time on Rocky Top.  I had already warned Peaches that we would have to sing ""Rocky Top"" on Rocky Top to which she obliged my silly request.  This was one of my favorite AT moments!  
After spending 40 minutes on Rocky Top it was time to hike on.  Thunderhead Mountain was next, which is about 100 feet higher than Rocky Top.  Hiking down Thunderhead was a fairly steep decent.  This always looks good on paper but I am so slow going down hill, especially if there are a lot of rocks.  Beechnut Gap is about halfway down the mountain and has a water sign on the trail.  We both thought we were still good on water so we continued on.  
The next 1.5 miles was short, steep, climbs and descents.  With the excitement of Rocky Top gone and the views limited I felt I was annoyingly slow through this part.  I didn't help matters when I stopped to look at a distance rock formation a hiker appeared out of know where carrying the tallest pack I had ever seen.  He asked if we were hiking to the next shelter.  I said ""No sir we are going on the Siler's"".  That's when he said ""Oh me too. See you there.""  My response ""Yep, see you there.""  Then he continued almost running down the trail and out of sight I'm sure thinking ""Those two won't make it before dark!""
After he had passed, Peaches and I giggled about us trying to carry a pack like that then quickly started talking about lunch.  We had planned on having lunch at the Derrick Knob Shelter but agreed we were to hungry for that.  Starkey Gap would be our new lunch stop. When we arrived it wasn't the gap we had envisioned but there was room for us to spread out our mats off the trail.  The day was beautiful but not to warm, the jackets came on as soon as we stopped.  For lunch we both had 3 jerky links with asiago cheese spread.  
It was now after 1:00 and still had over 7 miles to go.  I was beginning to wander myself if we would get to Siler's before dark. Three miles later we made it to the Derrick Knob Shelter.  The teenagers from last nights shelter were staying at Derrick Knob.  There is a spring at this shelter but since we felt we were running behind once again we skipped the water.  This was a bad idea with 5.7 miles left.
Halfway to Siler's we were both essentially out of water.  I had about 3 swallows left I was saving just in case because Peaches was dry.  Since we had no water it was hard to snack on anything.  We were both dragging!  All I could think about was getting to a full shelter and Peaches and I having find room in the dark.  Have I mentioned I'm not a big Shelter person? 
We rolled into the shelter around 6:30 and were relieved to hear other hikers talking about how challenging the last half of the day was.  And yes the hiker with the tall pack that had passed us earlier in the day was there but he did not mention any challenges from his day.  With the sun setting fast we claimed our spots (Oh, and the shelter wasn't full so that was an unnecessary worry.) and went to filter water.  By this time I was more tired than hungry but made sure I made my sweet tea.  Peaches fixed our MH meal as I set up my sleeping area and laid down for a few minutes.  
This is when I knew the mountain had won and I would not be able to finish the Smokies.  I hadn't told Peaches but I had made reservations for the Mt Collins Shelter for tomorrow night and Tater was bringing me resupply items, I packed before we left, so I could hike on and finish the Smokies and the BMT/AT loops.  This however was going to have me hiking 15.5 miles with extra weight.  After today's performance I knew I couldn't do it and reach the shelter before dark with the shorter days.  I wanted to cry but was too tired.
Peaches said supper was ready and I ate about 3 bites and couldn't eat anymore.  I went and laid back down sipping on my tea.  Peaches continued to eat what she could of the meal.  Once she finished we gathered our smellables, hung packs on the bear cables and turned in.  It didn't take long for the snoring to begin.  This makes for a long night!
Being on Rocky Top was the highlight of my day but I was laying my head down this night feeling a little sad I could not complete my journey as planned.  However, I knew I was blessed to be on the trail this starry night.","Spence Field Shelter
",Siler's Bald Shelter ,"Oct 17, Tue",11.80
Almond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580934,"This morning we had a few more chores than normal.  We had filtered water when we reached camp last night but used most of it for supper and tea.  As we were getting ready to go filter water the boys from the Derrick Knob shelter showed up to filter.  Since there were five of them we kept packing up to wait our turn.  There was a little water left from last night so I used it to make hot chocolate for breakfast.  (I went ahead and ate my breakfast snack at the shelter since I hadn't eaten much supper.). The boys had finished when we got there and we proceeded to top everything off that we had even though we were just hiking 4.5 miles today.  We were going to have plenty and hopefully not have to stop and filter.
We were both pretty quiet at the start of today's hike.  This was the first time Peaches and I hadn't agreed on where or when the hike should end.  In the end Clingman's Dome was picked, we would end on a high note.  Literally because at 6373 feet Clingman's Dome is the height point on the AT.  The quiet didn't last long however.  One amazing view and we were both giddy with excitement.  
The Double Spring Gap Shelter was under 2 miles up the trail.  This is where we noticed the scenery change from deciduous hardwoods to evergreen spruce and fir trees.  The smell was amazing!  I turned to Peaches with my nose in the air like a puppy dog and said ""It smells like Christmas!""  We both laughed as we continued to sniff our way up the trail.  As we climbed higher the forest floor became a carpet of green from the moss.  This setting continued for another 1.8 miles.
After hiking through the evergreen forest the trail follows the ridge line and the trees become less dense.  In fact we were basking in the sun through much of this section.  From this point on the views were non stop.  Look to the east at North Carolina and to the west for Tennessee.  We could also see Gregory Bald, Cades Cove, Knoxville and a nuclear plant in the far off distance.  We think it was Watts Bar in Dayton, TN, but not 100% sure.  I would literally be enjoying and taking pictures of one view and Peaches would take 20 steps ahead and turn to me and say ""Wow, Almond your not going to believe this.""  I would ask ""Is it better?"" as I hurried up the trail and sure enough it would be!  
The closer we got to Clingman's Dome the more crowded the trail became.  We had seen what we thought to be SOBO thru hikers earlier in the day but now it was mostly tourists taking in the views.  The Clingman's Dome trail ends on a large paved foot path that leads to the overlook tower.  Unfortunately the tower was closed for repair but will open again in 2018.  We still had to walk up to the base of the tower for our photo opp.  Clingman's Dome is the highest point on the AT and where we would end this section.  
When we walked down the path from the tower to the parking lot we passed a lady that looked just like a hiker whose blog I read.  I stopped and ask ""I know this may sound silly but are you Sprinkles?""  She smiled and said ""Yes I am!""  She asked us about our present hike and I told her how much her BMT thru hike trail journal help with my BMT thru hike last year.  Peaches and I were both surprised by the number of people up here.  Lots of people gave us friendly nods silently saying ""Good job girls!"",  at least that's what we thought.  Maybe they were thinking ""I hope those two find a shower soon."" Hahaha  The parking lot was full and people were just circling to find a spot.  I waited on a rock with our gear while Peaches went to see it she could find Tater and Goober.  They found each other within a few minutes and pulled up to load our packs.  Down the mountain we went in search of our next meal and ALL of us sharing our adventures from the past several days.  Let's just say this time there was a little excitement at home!","Siler's Bald Shelter 
",Clingman's Dome,"Oct 18, Wed",4.40
Almond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582024,"Today would be our first day hike on the AT.  With our schedules getting busy and Thanksgiving coming up we weren't sure if we would make it back to Clingman's Dome before the road closed for the season.  So we decided to do Clingman's Dome to Newfound Gap as a day hike.  
Not to sound like a broken record but our day started the same as our regular backpacking trips...get up early, meet at our usual spot, drive 2 hours.  Mother and Daddy drove us up and they planned to enjoy the day shopping in Pigeon Forge.  Well my Mother would enjoy the shopping and Daddy would probably enjoy naps in the truck. Lol 
The fall colors were beautiful on the drive up.  However, the mountain still showed her scars from last years huge wildfires in the area.  When we reached the parking area at Clingman's Dome it was below freezing and the winds were strong.  Peaches and I layered up, took our mandatory start of hike pictures, then started up the paved path to rejoin the AT where we had left off a few weeks ago.  We both agreed it was easier to pack for several days than it was for a day hike but the lighter packs sure were nice.
It was 2 miles from here to Mt Collins.  This section of trail is mostly an evergreen forest with the forest floor covered in moss.  There are several nice views and a few sections of open high ridge trail.  The most interesting thing I noticed was what appeared to be several Indian trail trees.  Those are trees with 90 degree bends in then.  They were bent by the Indians and used as trail markers is my understanding.  
The next three miles was the same scenery but with fewer views.  It appears that this section has a tendency to be soppy because there were several ground level foot logs.  The trail was maintained wonderfully and our shoes were mud free.  I also saw another Indian trail tree.  (Side note: A marker for the Meigs Line is on this section.  The Meigs Line was the surveyed line in the 1700's to designated the Cherokee Nation.  Read up on this if your interested, it's fascinating.)
When we reached Indian Gap Road we took a little snack break.  I told Peaches ""Wow, we are doing really well on our time.""  She agreed as we enjoyed the sunshine.  As I snacked I wonder why she told Daddy we would be done a 5:30.  It was just 2:00 and we only had a mile and a half to go.  Not a problem this was a nice place the kill some time, so I thought.  I read the info kiosk about Indian Gap and walked down a side trail to explore a few minutes.  When I came back Peaches asked if I was ready to go.  ""Sure, we are going to be early but Newfound Gap looks interesting.""  I wondered what the hurry was since she told Daddy 5:30 for pick up. ???
Our last part had us crossing 2 metal ramps that went over fencing to keep wild hogs out of this area.  Wild hogs are not native to the Smokies and are very destructive and mean. After we passed the ramps Peaches says ""Looks like we are going to be right on time!""  My silence must have gotten her attention because she turned and said it again.  My confused response made her laugh, ""You told Daddy 5:30 we are way early!""  Laughing Peaches says ""I told him 3:30.  Is that why you were stalling at Indian Gap?""  Well now I was laughing ""Yep, I thought we had 2 hours to kill and wondered why you thought it would take us so long to hike 7.7 miles!""  Laughing all the way to our 3:30 finish I had thought maybe just maybe we would have a hike without something silly happening.  It appears we are not capable of this!  Hahahaha
Mother and Daddy were there waiting, just like Peaches had told them!  We all took some time to explore around Newfound Gap and take our picture at the state line sign and the Rockefeller Memorial.  Neat NC/TN history and the dedication of the park at this location.  
This is a very nice day hike if your just needing some trail time.  Now that we were loaded up and headed back down the mountain it was time to eat.  The Old Mill in Pigeon Forge would fill our bellies.
Hope to finish the rest of the Smokies by years end.","Clingman's Dome
",Newfound Gap,"Nov 10, Fri",7.70
Almond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582021,"The definition of a ""plan"" is a follows: a detailed proposal for doing or achieving something.  That's just what we had, a great ""plan"" to finish our Smokies section of the AT before Thanksgiving.  Our shuttles were arranged, Mother and Daddy would drop us off at Newfound Gap and Tater and Goober would pick us up at Davenport Gap.  We had our shelter permits for the Smokies so we knew exactly where we would be staying and basically what time we would get there.  We even knew what meals we would eat each day.  This section was going to require little thinking and lots of hiking because we had a great ""plan""! 
As usual we left home before daylight with hopes of arriving at Newfound Gap around 8:00.  We had 10 miles ""planned"" for today and the Smokies had seen their first snow of the season just two day prior.  The odds were good the the trail would be slick and we would be slow.  Unfortunately we arrived only to discover the road to Newfound Gap was still closed.  Guess the rumors of a 6:30 am opening were just that.  The Backcountry Permit office at the Sugarlands Visitors Center didn't open till 8:00am so we waited.  
When the Backcountry Permit office opened Ranger Ramsey was there to help us.  They had no word on when the road would open and time was ticking.  The decision was made to hike SOBO and we quickly picked out two shelters for a new permit and our shuttle drivers (aka Mother and Daddy) drove us to the north end of the Smokies.  
It was now 10:00am and we were just hitting the trail and without much of a ""plan"",  but we always make time for those start of hike pictures.  We all four huddled around the trail sign and said cheese.  Then Peaches and I headed up the mountain.  
Our new shelter for the night would be Cosby Knob which gave us 9.0 miles to hike with the first 5.7 miles being all up hill, including the .6 side trail to Mt Cammerer observation tower.  We passed the intersection with the Chestnut Branch Trail at mile 1.9 which is the trail that connects the BMT to the AT.  I hope to connect the two trails by years end. 
The trail was now outlined with snow just past Chestnut Branch and snow began to completely cover the trail as we climbed in elevation.  It was icy in areas and this was slowing us down but we vowed not to skip Mt Cammerer no matter the delay.  
The side trail Mt Cammerer had much more snow and ice than the AT but boy was it worth it!  The views from the observation tower were endless for 360 degrees.  I often imagine what it was like manning these towers many years ago.  What trail did they take?  How long did they stay?  Were they lonely?   Did they have visitors?  What did they eat?  What was their daily routine?  Our time here was only 20 minutes but maybe one day I can return.
The trail stayed snowy for much of the 2.8 miles to our shelter.  We arrived about 45 minutes before dark to an almost full shelter and a roaring fire in the fireplace.  This gave us time to setup our sleeping bags, change clothes and prepare supper all before dark.  I must say changing clothes was the hardest of all these chores for me!  We were the only girls in the shelter and I tried to not draw attention to myself while I was changing in my sleeping bag, which is hard to do when Peaches is laughing at you! Hahahahaha!  
We ate our mountain house supper out on the porch area.  The blue tarps had been placed on the front of the shelters since our October hike.  This was nice to keep the wind out and you didn't bother anyone with your flashlights while you were eating.  Once supper was finished I took our bear bags down to the cables to hang for the night.  It was now dark but the bright snow covering the ground made it easy to see.  I crossed what seemed to be a good water source on my way to the cables.  Hopefully this is where we can filter our water in the morning.  
After we turned in for the night I passed the time by listening and watching other hikers.  Teenagers and a young boy kept the fire going.  You could tell the young boy was excited to be hanging out with the big kids.  A few men had already turned in as well while others stood outside reminiscing of previous hikes.  Then there were a couple of 20 something, that we had lead frogged with most of the day, telling of their thru hike.  One of them had a small guitar and they sang hiker songs for awhile.  They were actually good singers!
It was a perfect night at the Cosby Knob Shelter.  Guess you could say our ""plan"" came together!","Davenport Gap
",Cosby Knob Shelter,"Nov 20, Mon",7.80
Almond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582135,"It was a cold morning as hikers began to stir around the shelter.  Watching comfortably from my warm sleeping bag I knew I needed to get moving.  For me getting out of a warm sleeping bag is like taking off a bandaid, it must be done quick!  With puffy jacket on and boots loosely tied I head down the hill to get our bear bags.  The sun was just starting to rise, painting the clouds a soft pink.  These moments pass quickly so I stood there quietly enjoying my surroundings.  The water I had seen last night was the water source for the shelter.  It was nice not having to go far to filter.  
When I returned with our bear bags the first group of hikers were leaving, others were eating breakfast and Peaches was slowly getting out of her sleeping bag. LOL  I climbed back up to my bed and began to pack things up.  Once we were packed all the other hikers were gone, except the ""2 twenty somethings"".  They hadn't made a peep.  We stepped to the porch prepared hot chocolate, filtered water and then hit the trail by 8:30am.  We had 13.4 miles today and with an icy trail it was going to be slow going.  
As we began our 4 mile climb the winds became stronger and stronger.  This section is high ridge with steep slopes down sometimes on both sides.  There is nothing up here to block the winds and they were howling!  Just past the Snake Den Ridge intersection are a few remains of an F-4 Phantom plane that crashed in the 1980's.  This is very easy to miss but if you walk down the west side of the mountain off trail you will find more remains.  It was a surreal place to be.  
It was approaching noon and we were starting to get hungry.  Our trail guide showed in two miles there was an abandoned helicopter pad.  We decided that would be a good place for lunch.  The views were enjoyable to the helicopter pad but the winds, oh my goodness the winds!  As you might imagine the old helicopter pad was an open area and a lovely place for a cold, windy picnic. LOL  We pulled out our sleeping pads to sit on,  bundled up in all our jackets and ate our lunch; crackers, rehydrated chicken salad and some chocolate.  Well Peaches might of had Skittles.  
After lunch the trail was very icy for much of the afternoon.  The scenery had also changed to mossy evergreens.  It felt like we were walking though a fairyland.  Moss that covered the mountain spilled down to the trail and seemed to glow.  The path through the tall evergreens almost seemed unnatural and made me very aware I was a guest here.  
The howling winds from earlier were now block by the dense forest, which was a welcome reprieve.  With five miles left to go and limited water sources ahead we decided to filter at a very small spring by the trail.  It was frozen around the edges but had water flow and was just deep enough to filter with out us having to get our hands wet to make it deeper.  Shortly before the Tri Corner Knob Shelter the ""20 something guys"" from last night caught up with us.  They were stopping at Tri Corner but we needed to press on if we were to finish before Thanksgiving.  However, it was tempting to stop where we knew we could fix a relaxing supper and set of camp in the daylight.  We pressed on.
The next several miles we hike alone.  By the time I reached Eagle Rocks the sun was quickly setting.  From here you could see the city lights off in the distance, Knoxville perhaps.  I was happy to be away from that rat race.  Although from this distance it doesn't seem that busy.  I waited for Peaches here since we would now be hiking in the dark, ""unplanned"" but we were prepared.  
Now I only tell you this because it has relevance later, I had to pee so bad but for some reason I was determined to make it to the shelter.  We now had our headlights on and the wet areas on trail were starting to refreeze.  We were slow and steady.  Tonight we were staying at the Pecks Corner Shelter which is 1/2 mile off the AT on the  Hughes Ridge Trail.
There it was, the sign for the shelter, we had made it!  As we started down the path to the shelter we were stopped by a large tree that had fallen across the trail.  Peaches stayed on the trail and I tried to find a way around or through the tree.  No luck but I thought I heard voices at the shelter.  ""Hello, Hello"" I said randomly to the woods but no one answered.  As I walked back up to Peaches she asked ""Who are you talking too!""  I said ""I  thought I heard voices at the shelter"".  I couldn't see her but I'm pretty sure she gave me an eye roll. Hahahaha  
By this point I couldn't take it anymore I HAD to go to the bathroom!  Peaches stayed on the trail with my pack while I went tromping through the woods.  Just about the  time I was pulling my britches down I hear Peaches talking and see headlights from several directions. Well this will bathroom stop will have to wait!  I hurriedly went back to Peaches to see what was happening.  When I reached her she said ""There are people at the shelter and he is walking up here to get us.  They couldn't get to the shelter on the trail either."" Turns out it was 2 brothers who had gotten caught in the dark and decided to stay at this shelter instead of pressing on.  
Finally, at the shelter Peaches began to set up and I went tromping through the woods, again.  We were both so tired and cold we skipped fixing supper and ate some of our extra snacks.  
It was a challenging and fun day on the trail.","Cosby Knob Shelter

Almond,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583765,"I was the first one to stir at the shelter.  Quietly, I layered up and headed out to the bear cables to retrieve our ""smellables"".  Now that the sun was up I wanted to see the tree that was blocking the trail to the shelter last night.  I was hoping it wasn't going to be a small branch we could of walked around. Well it wasn't, this tree was HUGE!  No one will be coming down that path for awhile.  I headed back to the shelter and decided to make us some hot chocolate.  As I set the jetboil up on the porch I spilled a little water, it froze within seconds!  There wasn't any snow on the ground this morning but it seemed much colder than yesterday.  
As Peaches and I packed up, one of the brothers began to prepare breakfast as the other one continued to sleep.  While we were drinking our hot chocolate ""sleepy brother"" came out to check on breakfast.  ""Breakfast brother"" seemed to be enjoying himself more than ""sleepy brother"". Lol  We made one final check inside the shelter before heading down the hill to filter water.  During our check we couldn't help but notice the food these guys had brought: eggs in a fancy carrying case, a whole bag of carrots, apples, salt and pepper in shakers and several other fresh items.  We joke as we filtered our water that maybe we should stay for breakfast!  Hahahaha
Our highlight of the day was going to be the views from Charlie's Bunion, but what we didn't expect where the spectacular views along the way.  Now if there is anything that will slow me down more that an icy trail it's a good view.  
We reached Charlie's Bunion by mid afternoon.  The side trail from the north was icy and narrow.  There were only a few other people at the Bunion when we arrived.  After being mesmerized by the view for a few minutes we found us a nice rock for a 2:00 pm lunch.  We were quickly joined by an inquisitive little squirrel for lunch.  He gave us a look of ""Hey girls it's not free to sit there! Now hand over some snacks!""  We didn't give him any but I'm sure his ""salesmanship"" has work on others.  Lol 
After lunch we climbed up on Charlie's Bunion one more time to take a few pictures.  Grand views like this are like a strong magnet, it's hard to pull yourself away.  We decided to go back the same narrow path we came as to not miss any of the AT. The path on the north side, not our trail, was where most the other hikers had come from. 
It was now 3:00 pm and we had 4 miles to go.  The first mile was a climb up to the intersection of the Boulevard Trail.  This trail will take you to popular Mt LeConte Lodge.  About a .5 mile before this intersection (SOBO) we passed the Icewater Shelter.  Without a doubt this shelter has the best views of any other shelter along the AT in the Smokies.  Hopefully one day we can bring our boys back to this one! 
The next mile was a gradual descent to the intersection of the Sweat Heifer Creek Trail.  After this intersection the trail gets much steeper downhill all the way to Newfound Gap. The sun was getting low and what was now a wet trail with a few patches of ice would soon be turning back into a solid sheet of ice.  We hurried as best we could hoping that Tater and Goober would be waiting for us.  As we got closer to Newfound Gap we passed more people in tourist clothes exploring the winter trail if only for a short ways.  
As we came around our final turn, with the sun setting behind the mountains, we could see the Newfound Gap parking area.  By the time we reached the trail sign little Goober was there to greet us, Tater wasn't far behind.  One selfie group photo, then Peaches and I changed into less smelly clothes.  It was time to head down the mountain for home.  The next day was Thanksgiving and we all had so much to be thankful for!
Well that's a wrap for our 2017 AT section hikes.  This year we began our AT journey at Springer Mountain and have completed the trail through the north end of the Smokies, Davenport Gap, and the state of Maryland.  I don't anticipate we will get as much done in 2018 with logistics getting more difficult for section hikes but whatever Section Peaches and I hike we will be laughing!  See you on the trail!!","Pecks Corner Shelter
