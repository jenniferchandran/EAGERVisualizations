SkraM,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554313,"Hiking the Appalachian Trail (AT) has been a long time bucket-list item. The dream was renewed in July 2006 during a family vacation in north GA. Hiking was not on the vacation agenda; however, our final day’s adventure to Amicalola Falls State Park resulted in a family photo at a stone arch. The sign next to the arch stated “Appalachian Trail Approach, Springer Mtn 8.5 miles, Mt Katahdin, Maine 2,185 miles.”   I had not thought of the AT in a very long time. “Oooooo the trail” echoed through my brain as the hiking bug firmly planted its teeth into the mushy content of my skull. Arriving home, I dug out my old 20 year camping/hiking gear, searched the net for an easy trail access points, and planned a weekend getaway. I’ve logged over 500 AT miles since then but the 3-7 day ventures have not curb my appetite to hike the entire trail. My turn has finally come. On April 4 2017, I will set off for what I hope to be a complete north bound journey of the world renowned Appalachian Trail. Oh yeah!",,How it Began,"Feb 03, Fri",0
SkraM,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554312,"So many options. So many opinions. Ask 10 hikers about gear choices and you’ll get 10 answers. Tent or hammock? Canister or alcohol stove? Wool or synthetic base layers? What about rain gear, hiking poles, or shoes? I’ve come to the conclusion that there is not a perfect gear set-up. Gear choice is what works best for the individual hiker and knowing how to use that gear. Over the last 10 years of section hiking, I’ve used three different tents, two hammocks, three sleeping bag/quilts, four stoves, three packs, and a variety of sleeping pads and clothing options. Each new selection was a bit lighter weight than the previous. All previous gear setups worked well enough. I had likes and dislikes for each. So what shall I do? Use a different hammock, quilt, pack, and stove of course. My choices include: Arc Zip backpack from Zpacks. Sparrow hammock from Dream Hammock. Flight Jacket and Zepplin quilts (both 20 degree down) from Under Ground Quilts. I’m still on the fence about stove options. Base layers will be merino wool. I’ll start the hike with low cut hiking shoes and then switch to trail runners. I lean toward a lightweight setup without getting too crazy about every ounce. While keenly aware of how quickly ounces add to pounds, I’m not interested in cutting my toothbrush or towel in half. I will carry some comfort items, a small pillow, designated sleeping clothes, and a camera. Currently, my base weight is 14 lbs (food and water excluded) & (extra warm clothing is included). I’ll lose about 3 lbs of gear when the weather warms up.",,Gear Choices,"Feb 07, Tue",0
SkraM,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554406,"Training for a long distance hike is difficult, especially if you live in flat-land Florida. I have been prepping for this thru hike for nearly a year despite not knowing if it was really going to happen. Truth is, I needed to exercise more anyway. The notion of hiking was pure motivation. Most days, I fast walk a six mile course at a local park. I’ll jog parts of the course for cardio. The mixture of walking and jogging has helped a great deal but long, steep hills are what I really need. The best I can do for hills (without driving an hour) are parking garages and bike path over-passes. They’re not very exciting or picturesque but they provide a leg work-out. Recently, I added a 12 pound day pack to the walk.",,Training,"Feb 09, Thu",0

SkraM,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554788,"So much stinkin’ thinkin’. Thinking a lot about the trail. I'm eager to get started. Much of the thinking time is just good entertainment; rehashing gear choices, clothing options, start date, and am I doing enough to get ready - physically. I’m settled on most gear options but still trying to eliminate what is unnecessary. Example, do I really need that pillow, drinking mug, a designated set of sleeping clothes, or camp shoes. They’re nice to have but but add weight and volume to the pack. Cold weather clothing options are the hardest. Thin blooded from 17 years of warm Florida living has me concerned about being cold while on the trail. Heck, I’m reaching for a jacket at 60 degrees. April 4th is my start date but that seems sooooo far away. Do I dare depart late March? I’m walking six miles nearly every day with little jogging mixed in. And finally, I’m back on the diet… I’d like to shed 10 pounds before setting out. Thinking…thinking… so much stinkin’ thinkin’. I wouldn't want it any other way.",,Stinkin' Thinkin',"Feb 18, Sat",0
