MagicMan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526495,"Ok. My friends, the Troverts did this in 2012. When I discovered this, I was bitten. And now months later, it's turned into a passion. Daring. Bold. Brave. I think I'll be ready a year from now to make it all the way.",,Maine,"Apr 05, Tue",0
MagicMan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/528129,"Found some great convertible pants at Costco. Bought a used 82 liter internal frame for $35 on Craigslist. Decided to hammock all the way. All I've read says it is way better than a tent in 15 different ways. Can't wait. Still a long way till March, but I'll be doing 8 days on the AT in July for the fun of it. Probably start near Pearisburg, VA and hike north 4 days and turn around and hike back to my car for the next 4 days. I think it will be a good shake down to see what works and what doesn't. To see what I need and never use. I'm feeling almost ready. Clothes, Pack, Water, Kitchen, Sleeping, Food, Misc, Phone (extra external battery, Chargers) waterproof notepad and pencils. I'm thinking about doing magic on and off the AT and giving part of the proceeds to a charity. And I know there is a book in all this. EPIC!",,Almost ready,"Apr 15, Fri",0
MagicMan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529136,"The pack weighs 27 lbs without the food and water. That includes 2 lbs of magic ""stuff"" that will accompany me to shelters and towns and bars and restaurants and along the trail as I raise money for a great cause, Make-A-Wish. They called me several weeks ago to see if I could do a magic show that day for a 9 year old. I mostly do corporate magic for employees and customers (Think Trade Shows and Christmas parties), but I love doing magic for smart kids. The occasion? They were pulling the plug the next day and her dying wish was a magician. The goose bumps are real! What an experience. All the tears and smiles were genuine after the show. I'm a fan for life. There is more to the story, so catch me on the trail next year. Magic is the elixir of life!Wayne ""MagicMan"" Anderson",,Weighed the Pack!,"Apr 21, Thu",0
MagicMan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/539279,"So I see that some guys have gotten their pack weight down to 12 lbs! No way. I'm away from home for 6 months. There are just some things you have to take. I don't have the kitchen sink, but you have to take care of yourself. I'm pretty sure I can get to less than 30 lbs after the winter weather is over. I have 4 lbs of layering and down and hat, etc. That will go after the Smokies probably. I'm thinking of using an umbrella all the way. Light skinned and there has been so much rain on the trail the last couple of years.",,12 LBS?!!,"Jun 22, Wed",0

The AT is marked with approximately 165,000 2"" X 6"" inch white blazes along the trail guiding hikers the entire way.The AT travels through 14 different states. The southern terminus is Springer Mountain, Georgia and the northern terminus is Mt. Katahdin, Maine.

MagicMan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545112,"Hard to believe that next year this time I'll finish one of the most amazing goals of most people's lives. Maybe a week later or even a week sooner. And I get to actually live it. The AT is within the reach of most and yet a distant reality for almost all. March 4th (get it?) is so close. I've been hiking with a full 30 pound pack a lot recently in my Merrell Ventilators. Under my silver umbrella. I'm going to be a Guthook hanger. I'm playing a lot of Pickleball. And I'm so looking forward to performing magic at the UNC & STATE home football games this year and the UNC basketball games under The Dean Dome. I'm devouring your journals with all the accompanying emotions that your successes and disappointments bring. You've been through the blackberries and the blueberries. And some of you are counting down the days to Katahdin. Wishing you well. And to the class of 2017, I'm so hoping our paths cross on the adventure of a lifetime...",,Finishing! ,"Aug 09, Tue",0
