Hodge Podge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/542794,"Finally decided on a new pack and since I worked for Osprey Packs in the past, I had to go with an Atmos 65 and support the southwest Colorado businesses! Recently moved (close by) and have not had an opportunity to get out with the new pack but expect to start soon, as in this coming weekend. Really enjoying the posts from this years hikers and hope they all make it!",,View Entry,"Jul 19, Tue",0
Hodge Podge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/543496,"Congrats to North Star! He summited Katahdin yesterday. He is one of the 2016 hikers I have followed from his start in GA. Very similar in age and experience and very insightful in trials and challenges along the way. Latest is how he will integrate back in to home life, which is something I have thought about extensively. Only one way to find out!",,View Entry,"Jul 25, Mon",0
Hodge Podge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545054,"Have begun gathering gear that I can use in the future and am stuck between water filter choices. I currently use a PUR Hiker (now Katadyn) with a water bladder. This is great for filling the bladder especially from hard to reach and small water holes where the intake hose just drops right in and you can easily pump water out. Problem with this is weight, approximately 12 oz. I am trying to loose weight and this is an area of opportunity. I am intrigued by the Sawyer Mini and Squeeze water filters at 2 and 3 oz respectively. They can be spliced into a bladder hose or used on a water bottle. Obvious advantage is weight and size, I see the only down side is not being able to pump from difficult water sources, having to use a bottle to scoop out water may get challenging. Anyone have experience with these and can make a recommendation?",,View Entry,"Aug 08, Mon",0
Hodge Podge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545802,"Time has begun to continue gearing up for a future trek. I have been backpacking for a long time and have accumulated a full, large walk-in closet of great gear over the years. Unfortunately most of my tried and true pieces are just simply too heavy to bring on a thru-hike. Most notably is my Osprey Highlander from 1999 which has been all over with me. The Highlander fits like a glove and distributes and carries weight like you would want in a pack, but mine tipped the scale at almost 7 lbs. Replaced with a 2016 Osprey Atmos 65 at just under 5 lbs, more than 2 lbs saved. My dad got me a Sierra Designs Clip Flashlight in 1986 ($120 back then) which has probably been overused now but is still in good shape. Not a freestanding tent but I have always been able to find a spot to pitch it. Weighs in at 4 lbs, 7 oz. Great 30 years ago but too much in 2016. Am looking at the Big Agnes Fly Creek UL 2 weighing 2 lbs 5 oz, losing 2 lbs 2 oz, almost half, from the Clip Flashlight. Finally going to a Sawyer Squeeze water filter from my PUR Hiker, saving 8 oz.Will be more to come but have already saved almost 5 lbs off my base weight. Looking to hit that sweet spot around 15 lbs base. My old items have already section hiked all of VA, and will be sad in a way to leave them at home, but time to move on.",,View Entry,"Aug 15, Mon",0
Hodge Podge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/546069,"Have been way overthinking the gear and what I have vs what I should buy way too much lately. The dilemma is do I go for new gear or use what I have? Example: I have many packs (8, yes, I am a gear head and could probably purge some) that all have different functions. Some used more than others but all in excellent condition. I could use my old Osprey Highlander (7+ pounds), Osprey Crescent 50 (4 pounds 10 oz) or purchase a new pack (which I have done, Osprey Atmos 65 4.5 pounds) or drop into a lightweight or ultralight pack saving precious ounces to the tune of several hundred dollars. I like a beefier suspension and can find one in a lighter pack but for a price. Following much internal debate, I have decided that in the beginning I am going to go with what I have, Osprey Crescent 50, and see how it works with the thought of switching to a lighter system if needed. I can still cut at least a half pound or more from the Crescent on items not needed and call it good.Additionally, I am not going to get trapped into this again and go with what I have unless it simply will not work. I am sure I am not the only one with this problem...",,View Entry,"Aug 18, Thu",0
Hodge Podge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550046,"Still working on updating my gear, most of my current gear is from 1998-2004 and new stuff is so much lighter. We will see what gets replaced. Due to work and other commitments, I have not been able to get out as much as I would like yet but I plan on a lot of snowshoeing and XC skiing this winter! Added a couple of pics of my stomping grounds here in southwest Colorado.",,View Entry,"Oct 04, Tue",0
Hodge Podge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552522,"A snow storm over the weekend gave me an opportunity to gather my gear together and begin sorting what I would need. With everything pictured for winter hiking, am at 20 lbs 4 oz not including food, water and fuel. The hard part begins of cutting weight down while still having enough for cold weather. I am debating in my mind: ""this water bottle is 1.4 oz, should I leave it behind?"". I assume this will go on until I get through the arch in GA and am committed either way.

Hodge Podge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552749,"As 2016 finally comes to an end I am excited that I have finally committed to my upcoming adventure and saddened at the same time. The world lost a lot of wonderful people this last year, artists, musicians, actors, sports greats and one of the last great pioneers. 
Carrie Fischer's recent departure hit me particularly hard. I first saw her as a wide eyed 8 year old blown away by Star Wars. The Star Wars fascination continues to this day but she was great in Blues Brothers and other roles, even writing a play and books.

Even though I grew up on the east coast and lived near the trail for some time, I still think of every night dropping into the teens or single digits as it does in here in Colorado (even Jimmy needs a coat).

After this week I have family in town for skiing in Telluride for a week and then one more week of work before I cut loose and head east. Before I hit the trail I will be staying with my parents and visiting some old friends in Richmond, VA for a couple of days. This will be a lot of fun as I have not seen them in almost 10 years.Still tweaking my gear to drop some weight and decided to send my summer clothes to Insect Shield to be treated to do everything I can to avoid the dreaded ""Lyme disease"" (use deep loud voice when saying ""lyme disease"" think Phil Hartman). I feel that I am mentally prepared for this adventure as I have done the trail through Virginia already (but only in sections) and almost always finish things I start, but you never know how it will effect you and I will have to roll with whatever is thrown at me. I am prepared to do what is required to make it to Baxter SP in one piece (both mentally and physically).Currently I am reading ""Southbound"" by the Barefoot Sisters which is very entertaining and a good screen shot of trail life, I recommend the book.

Pretty easy day except for Sassafrass Mtn which was easier than many hikers made it out to be. Hiked almost straight through to Gooch Mtn Shelter to keep warm. Forecast is for low 20's the next couple of days so many hikers are looking for other options till the cold front passes. Lots here at the shelter as well. Trail is busy.

Lots of fun and laughter while we watched the temperature fall. 23 when we decided to sleep around 8 pm. I froze. My 30 degree quilt bag and liner could not handle the teens that night as I shivered and got no sleep even with every piece of clothing I had on. 14 degrees when the stirring began at 7:30 am for the day. No breakfast, all just wanted to get moving to create heat. My water bladder was frozen solid (2 liters) but thankfully, I had 20oz stashed in a bottle I slept with. The group of us got our food bags from the new bear box and headed up Blood Mountain which had a great view from the top.Short hike down to Neels Gap and the outfitter where Ankleman bought new boots and insoles. About 20% markup on everything so I passed on any purchases and walked the 1/4 mile to the cabins to check in.Stayed with Jimmy, Two Dogs and Jeff where we washed clothes, cleaned and dried gear and most importantly warmed up.Down to 10 tonight and teens Thursday night so we are taking a zero day and staying here.","Woods Hole Shter

Also hard because the group I had been hiking with was splitting up for numerous reasons, lots of ""see you down the trail"" partings. The Dude and I left town and headed into the hills. Pretty easy day but I slipped and tweaked my knee a little slowing me down and making every step painfull for awhille. Fortunately the pain went away.

We hiked to Allen Gap and set up our tents at a primitive site where Daddy Longlegs provided the evening entertainment by doing art on his tent's rain-fly. There was a small hiker store near our site so several hikers bought some snacks, most notably, The Dude bought a Moon-pie for the first time. He loved it but it filled him up so he could not finish his dinner, we are hikers right? The joke is we can eat anything and tons of it.

Back on the trail after a great break in Richmond. My mom dropped me off and walked a little of the trail with me before it kicked up into the woods. Great to have her do a little hike with me! Got to the Shenandoah NP hiker kiosk to sign in for a back country permit, nice not to have to pay and be able to stay where you want for the most part, unlike Smokey Mtn NP. Overall, the AT is pretty forgiving through the park with moderate ups and downs lending itself to nice, easy hiking. First peak you come across, Bears Den Mtn, has some communication towers on top where a bunch of old tractor seats are stuck in the ground making seats. I could not resist taking a break on one for awhile watching the clouds move around above. Went over Little Calf Mtn, Calf Mtn, and Turk Mtn. A little sore after taking some time off but in great spirits! Arrived at the shelter after 5:30 pm and met Floater, Sweet Spot, Lucky, some others and found Spiderman in the corner. 
After I looked around I remember this shelter as the one I was at 17 years ago where the trail log book said a Whippoorwill would sit on the fire place about 15 feet and start ""Whippoorwill""ing at 4:00 in the morning. They are very loud, and the log book said to keep a pile of small rocks to throw and it will go away. I told this story to the group there and got some laughs. We all went to bed at hiker midnight (dusk, around 8:30 this day) and fell asleep. Around 10:20 pm, I was woken up to a loud ""Whippoorwill"" bringing back memories from long ago. After a couple of calls from the bird, the laughter began from the hikers and fortunately stopped shortly thereafter but made for a funny moment!","Rockfish Gap

Nice day to be hiking, clear, sunny and slightly cool. Went over Blackrock Mtn and came across one of the thru-hiker legends of Shenandoah National Park (SNP), a camp store right off the trail! The Loft Mtn Store was only 70 yards up a small hill, so I powered up the hill to the structure for a treat of soda, sandwich, cookies and chips! The store was clean and has bathrooms with showers and laundry services, sounds like all the camp stores in the park have this too. Sat out in the sun with Floater and Scooby enjoying the warmth before heading out after almost an hour of rest. 
After a long day of hiking I arrived at the shelter beat. My feet, ankles, calves and knees were sore. Sweet Spot, Lucky and Floater were there and we had a good time laughing and going over what we ate at the store. There were several others camping around the shelter who joined in on the laughter. At one point, I mentioned that I had forgotten my rain wrap (lightweight skirt or kilt that works great) at the Priest shelter and was bummed. Hearing this, Dan Cotton, a Patomic Appalachian Trail Club (PATC) member says hold on and leaves the picnic table for his tent. He comes back a few minutes later and tosses his rain wrap to me and said ""try this on"". It fit great and he just asked that if it survives the trip, to send it back to him.

The temperature stayed low and the rain came in heavy, glad I have a rain wrap again. The trail was saturated from the previous nights rain quickly creating large pools making a cold, muddy mess of my shoes. Was looking for the side road to the Wayside and passed a graveyard. About .4 miles later a south bound (SOBO) hiker said the graveyard was where I needed to go for my turn off, so back I went. Found a trail marker and had to go back the way I had just left to Skyline Drive. Floater caught up to me at the road and we walked to Big Meadows Wayside together. Great to take a break out of the cold rain, both of our hands were so wet and cold that it took forever to release our pack buckles. Finally got inside and into the dining room where, much to my surprise, Nemo was just getting a huge breakfast. We joined him and sat at a big table, spread our jackets out to dry and enjoyed a great meal. We were not excited about going back into the rain so we enjoyed a lot of coffee and talked. Finally got up and went to the SNP Visitor Center next door and got a SNP and AT stamp for my National Park Passport I have been carrying since the Smokies. The visitor center is great and we spent several hours looking at all the displays before going back to the wayside for lunch. The rain kept coming down and visibility was about 25 feet in the clouds when we headed off to the next shelter. Stayed with Nemo, Floater, Spiderman, Peanut and a section hiker, Noah. Peanut impressed us all by coaxing a fire from all the wet wood, lifting all our spirits. Another really funny evening with lots of good humor and good people.

Walked the .1 mile to the restaurant and found a really nice coffee shop where I got a homemade espresso brownie to die for and some great coffee. Settled into a chair at a counter and struck up a conversation with a couple from Seattle originally from Holland. Lots of trail questions and I enjoyed talking with them. Left after about an hour and 4 cups of coffee (free refills, the great staff made sure my cup was full) back into the cold rain and fog.

On the trail at 9:30 and did not stop till I hit Elkwater Wayside for a last meal in SNP. Hung out on the grassy knoll while the sun popped out warning Nemo and I. Went over Humpback Mtn and got about .2 mi from the evening shelter, looked up the trail and about 20 yards away was a bear standing there looking at me. I yelled at him waving my arms and he just kept looking at me before finally wandering off. I watched him wander off to where another year-ling and the mother were watching me! 3 of them, what a treat!

Stopped at the Tom Floyd Shelter for lunch and back to hiking by noon. Passed US522 which goes to Front Royal. Ran into some trail maintainers from the PATC and thanked them for their hard work. One was the former PATC president who said this was the most vegetation he had seen at this time of year due to all the rain. 
Made it to the shelter which, in my opinion, is one of the best in the trail, it has a separate covered eating area, huge porch, solar shower and a horseshoe pit. I was relaxing on the porch in an Adirondack chair when I see a bear tear into camp, see me, and go crashing into the brush to get away. 3 section hikers arrived which had scared it. It hung around camp with multiple sightings making for an interesting evening.

Up early again after a cold night on the mountain. A cold front came through last night dropping the temps but I was warm in my bag. On the trail by 6:15 heading to the top of White Cap Mountain which provides NOBOs (northbound hikers) their first clear view of their end, Mt. Katahdin. Met many hikers on top with great views as it was a clear morning. All the NOBO's wanted to know which mountain Katahdin was so I played guide for a while pointing it out.
Headed down and ran into another old friend, Circus, who is doing great. Shortly thereafter I met Scout and Multi Tool. Ironically, it is my hat that most recognize me with and not the rave green Sounders XBOX jersey.
Went over Hay Mtn and West Peak before fording the Pleasant River. It was shallow but wide, so I had to switch out of my boots to my Croc camp shoes to cross. My feet have widened in the toes causing blisters on my little and big toes on both feet making every step painful. Nothing to do but move forward to Monson.
Got water at Chairback Pond where Fuel decided to stay for the night and I hiked on hoping to cross Chairback Mountain before stopping. Got mostly up and was beat so I found a mossy spot and threw up my tent. While I was cooking dinner, another hiker, Preacherman, came along and I invited him to sit for awhile. We talked and he decided to throw his tent up next to mine rather than continue. 
Clear night so I did not put the tent fly on allowing me to watch the stars throughout the night.","Logan Brook Lean To

Several hikers that came down it the previous day warned us not to hike it at night, not nearly as bad a climb as it was made out to be and we completed it in about 15 min. Great views at the top! 
The trail continued on with lots of ups and downs that were not easy. Many large roots and rocks breaking up my stride really slowing me down. Good views from the Barren Mtn Ledges before heading down more than 1350 feet in less than a mile, really steep.
Just after getting down, there was a big sign for trail magic, Fuel and I had to go there! Met Scout and Birdman who made us hot dogs, burgers and gave us sodas and chips in memory of Scout's son, Yogi, who thru-hiked in 1992 and is no longer with us. Thank you gentlemen!

The last 2, I landed hard on my hip twice in the same spot. The last one, I got to the top of the slope, looked down and said to myself, ""there is no way I will not fall on this"". tried to find another way down but it was pretty well cliffed out except for the trail (steep granite slab) so I tried to minimize any hard impacts by crouching as low as I could and moving slowly. This did not work and I hit hard sliding down. Very painful, will have to keep an eye on my hip. Was having a rough time and feeling down when I finally got to the shelter. When I came around the corner, there sat Floater who I hiked the Shenandoah's with! Great to see her and catching up really lifted my spirits.

NOBO's have been telling us how difficult this will be for days now.
The trail started up and over Speck Mtn to warm us up. Long climb but good views from a fire tower at the top.
Next, the Arm. I started down expecting a straight up and down I had been hearing about, never materialized much to my relief. Made it to the bottom with no problems, really no worse than anything else we had done, actually a little easier than some of the others. 
Then the Notch. Easy to tell you have hit it as you suddenly have to climb over, under and around boulders, lots of them. Hardest part was squeezing through a small slot under some rocks and having to get my pack through. Took me about 1 hour and 45 min to complete the mile, mostly because I would have to stop and find the best route as I am heading south. Going north, much of the Notch has arrows pointing which way to go showing you the best route, going south you have to figure it out yourself. Glad to be done with these two parts of the trail as it took a lot out if me. Flying Fish wanted to do some more miles so we parted ways, I hope to see him down the trail.
Climbed out of the Notch to the shelter where I ran into Tumbleweed, last saw him in TN. Large shelter and thought I would be the only hiker inside until a huge group of NOBO's came in.

Fall has hit the area and it was cold last night. I started with everything I had on to stay warm. Climbed to the summit of Goose Eye Mtn where the wind was really kicking making it even colder.

Hit the ME/NH border and have completed another state, on to the White Mtns of NH!

""Some know me by that name"" he responded.

First, out of the White Mtns so easier terrain and second Omelette Man! Hiked over Mt Mist and my body is loving the more forgiving trail. No big roots, rocks, steep climbs or boulders to climb up and down to hurt me today! Arrived at the Omelette Man just before lunch. Carl, the Omelette Man, cooks omelettes for thru hikers providing trail magic. I had 4 eggs, ham, onions, peppers and cheese on mine. Yum! Thank you Carl!

Because I am usually the first one hiking I either get all the spiderwebs that were built during the night crossing the trail or get all the water on trees and plants knocked on me. Today was a wet day so even though it was not raining, I was drenched from the vegetation. Went over Smarts Mtn first thing but there were no views so I kept going. Really enjoying the trail, without all the big rocks makes all the difference.
Stopped at the Trapper John Shelter early due to more rain forecasted for later in the afternoon and enjoyed the solitude and quiet as I was the only one there. Surprisingly it is rare on the trail to be alone at a shelter as there are so many hikers.
Raptor and Chimney came in just when the rain hit coming down hard and fast. Glad to be covered tonight and we had the shelter to ourselves. 
Discussion turned to how long we have left on the trail. For me, about 5 weeks. That took me by surprise and made me both excited and sad. I look forward to being home again but I will really miss the trail life, there really is nothing like it.","Hexacube Shelter

Once I started hiking I was heading for a ridge line and my spirits soared when I looked up and saw sun rays shooting from over the top. Came up to the ridge with an overlook and stood there soaking in the morning sun rays for some time. A moment I will remember the rest of my life...
Trail remained easy making fast work of the miles. Biggest change is the leaves are starting to turn so the green tunnel is starting to get reds and yellows mixed in. 
Checked a review of the shelter I was heading to to see if the water was running, it was not, but there was a note about a crazy drunk homeless man holed up at the shelter. I have no interest in exposing myself to that so I checked hotel rates in Hanover (Dartmouth University) which were outrageous, so I figured I would check out the shelter and simply move on if needed. When I arrived there was a lot of banging noises but it was from 5 older section hikers breaking wood for a fire. They were all affiliated with the Salvation Army in some capacity and take an annual week long trek.

I walked around and eventually stationed myself at Starbucks where a friend is coming to get me for the weekend. Surprised how friendly all the locals are to a dirty, stinky and wet hiker. Had some great conversations while sitting there. The staff was really welcoming as well, just a pleasant experience.

Lunch, water and a good dose of electrolytes made me feel much better. Read numerous recent reports in the shelter register and on Guthook's that there is a problem bear at the upcoming shelter I am headed to that is getting everyone's food. With that in mind, I stopped several miles before the shelter to set up camp and hopefully avoid the problem bear. Great weather today, am really enjoying not having to deal with rain.

We were planning on staying at a church hostel and resting tomorrow and I had left them a message asking about shuttles the day before and had not heard back yet.

We will have to wait a couple more days before we can rest.
A couple hours later at a road crossing, a beat up old pickup truck slammed on it's breaks as it passed us and spun around squealing tires and honking its horn. We waited and it stopped next to us where a guy in his 40's who looked rough (Chimney nick-named him Crazy Harry) said there was no water for 12 miles and he would take us up the road to get some if we wanted. We were low so we threw our packs in the back and jumped in. The source he took us to was dry so he took us to a gas station store where we got water, drinks and snacks. He spun out of the gas station and dropped us off, but started to drive off before we got our packs out the back. I slapped the door and he stopped long enough for us to retrieve our things before squealing away. Crazy.
We finally got to the shelter and while we were eating dinner as it was getting dark, I saw a light through the trees. I pointed it out to Chimney and we watched a guy on a motorcycle head toward us. This was unsettling as there are no motorized vehicles allowed on AT lands. He stopped right in front of us, handed us a picture of a guy and asked if we had seen him. We said no and he explained he left his girlfriends house drunk at 1am last night to go for a hike after a fight and no one has heard from him since. We talked for a while and he drove off.

Hodge Podge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579222,"Slept in as we have to wait till the Post Office opens so Chimney can pick up a drop box. While we were waiting we went to a great breakfast at the Apple Pie Cafe. Hope joined us, she is zeroing today so we will not see her again. We said our goodbyes and hit the trail at 9:30 which was late for us, but you do what you need to.Today we hit the infamous PA rocks, lots of them which really slows you down. Not a lot of elevation change but oh those rocks! My feet are tenderized. Arrived at the shelter just before sundown and filtered water by headlamp. Here with Chimney, Nameless (another SOBO) and two section hikers. Forecast is for rain which should make the rocks really interesting.","Church of Mountain Hostel

Hodge Podge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579260,"Lots of rain last night, good to sleep by but no fun to hike in. The PA rocks become very slick when they are wet so we took our time with them today. They are small but pointy and everywhere so you either step on them (ouch!) or navigate around them really slowing you down. 
We were drenched when it stopped raining around noon and my feet were prunes which brought on a couple more blisters, sigh...
We passed Wind Gap and climbed down the exposed rocks of Leigh Gap before heading to the shelter. 
Due to the rain and rocks we did a shorter day than planned but got to meet Doctor John at the shelter, he has hiked almost 25,000 miles of long trails. Too much for me!","Leroy Smith Shelter

Hodge Podge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579315,"Woke up several times to rain last night, but it let up when we woke and packed up. Rain began again shortly after we started hiking and came down hard. Chimney and I were soaked early on but when it rains, you get wet. There were several long rock scrambles that were very treacherous with the rain. This slowed us down because we were being very careful on the wet rocks. Feet were prunes by the time we stopped, no new blisters! We are alone at the shelter tonight just enjoying the woods noises of the night. 
I have about a week left and have very mixed emotions. Trail life is fun, hard and unlike anything else but I miss my wife and family. I will be enjoying my last days here and take in as much as I can.","George W. Overbridge Shelter

Hodge Podge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579365,"No rain today but everything was still wet from the last couple of days. Rocks and roots were still slick.
Chimney and I started with the first light to get to Port Clinton before the post office closes at 4:30. His dad surprised him and is coming up from South Carolina for a visit, he is excited and I am looking forward to meeting him.
We hiked by the Hawk Mountain Sanctuary after a brief lunch at the Eckville Shelter. We pushed on over more and more rocks, they really wear you down not only hurting your feet but mentally as well by not allowing any other thoughts than where to place your feet. Most of PA is relatively flat, but those rocks...
We rolled into Port Clinton around 4:00, got the package and his dad pulled up. Great to meet and hang out with him. We all got a hotel room and did all the usual town chores, some for the final time for me. 
Chimney's dad is slack-packing us tomorrow so hope to move fast!","Allentown Shelter

Hodge Podge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579393,"Chimney's dad, John, dropped us off at the trail head at 7:30am, overcast with rain predicted. We began with an uphill before hitting the rocky ridge. Light rain started after hiking for an hour and lasted just long enough to wet everything making rocks slick. Despite this, we moved at a good pace. Rain began again and came down hard in the afternoon. We were soaked, my feet were squishing in my shoes for the 4th day straight. It stopped right before we arrived at the shelter, oh well. The shelter is close to a road and a when we arrived John had set a feast. We ate like kings! 
This was my last day hiking with Chimney, he will be hiking with his dad and not doing bigger miles. I will miss him and wish him well. Only about 86 miles left!","Port Clinton

Hodge Podge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579460,"More rain last night, makes it hard to get up out of a warm dry sleeping bag, put on a wet shirt, wet shorts, wet socks and shoes and headed out. But I have miles to do...
Said goodbye to Chimney and his dad, they will be off trail visiting for next few days. I will miss his company.
No rain when I started but hit more PA rocks almost immediately. Slippery when wet. Even though it didn't rain my shoes were drenched fast due to the grasses and other vegetation which overhangs the trail and soak your feet. Squish, squish squish... You could see water coming out of them with each step. Day 5 of this and only one new blister and a small one at that. Went through Swatara Gap and SP to my finish for the day at Rausch Gap Shelter. Here with two other SOBO's, Shoe Wizard and Tailwind.","501 Shelter

Here at the shelter with Traveler and three weekend section hikers who arrived after we had gone to bed.","Rausch Gap Shelter

Here at the shelter with two SOBOs, Sara and Smiles and two Austrian section hikers.
On schedule to finish tomorrow.
I did not have any new revelations out here but many things have been reinforced. For example, how much I love my best friend and wife, my desire to make changes to simplify my life and my love of the outdoors.Although I am completing the trail, I did not view it as something to conquer but more as a way for me to connect with nature, the trail, the trail community but most importantly, myself. Thank you all for the wonderful comments and support through this journey. Sometimes a simple ""hi, I like reading your blog"" kept me going on tough days. Unfortunately I am not able to respond but I loved hearing from everyone.
I will miss trail life, there is nothing like it.
