Jake Brock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555098,"I've been planning this hike for nearly a year like so many other fellow hikers. Following college graduation, I've taken the opportunity to travel and live without many responsibilities since it'l all change come August when I interview for medical schools. My goal for this hike is to live freely while exploring the best of appalachia. I look forward to meeting diverse hikers and trail angels who will ultimately influence my perspective. I'm a little nervous but more excited after hearing of all the experiences of my friends who are former thru hikers","

Jake Brock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555419,"Olivia picked me up at 3pm at my place to take me to the airport. I arrived in Atlanta around 830 with no issues. Cody picked me up at the airport and took me back to his place to drop off my stuff before going to a local brewery for some food and beers. We got to catch up on everything at this point over some good beers before going to his favorite bar where he knew everyone. He has telling them all what I was doing and most everyone was super impressed and supportive. They were all pretty drunk tho so I didn't think too much of it. I slept on his couch and got a acceptable night of sleep. We woke up at 730 for breakfast and takeoff to amicalola state park. I officially started the trail as hiker 227 at 1045 with a 43 lb pack, which is a bit heavier than normal. Me and  Cody hiked the first 5 miles of the approach trail together before he parted with me and so began my solo hike. I made it to springer Mountain early afternoon where I met a couple fellow thru hikers also. After a short stop and photo, I made the remaining 2.8 miles to the next shelter for the night. There was a decent sized group in the shelter and in tents. I decided to tent since it was supposed to rain the next 2 days. So I set up and prepared my meal of butter noodles. I hung out with the group of hikers around the fire and was relieved that almost everyone else was in the friendless, humble position like me. There were many awkward smiles over bad jokes all around. We went to bed at 8pm. I woke up several times to adjust my clothes bag I was using as a pillow and shielding myself from the cold with my +5 degree sleeping bag. I got up at 545 and packed and ate before my 715 departure.","Amicalola State Park

Jake Brock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555420,"After a night of tossing and turning and waiting for my watch to hit 6am, I exited my tent to prep for the day. First, the stars out were incredible! It was pitch dark around the campsite so I had to use the red light setting on my headlamp to guide my Oatmeal preparation and pack up. I was out at 715 and quickly caught up with a girl that I saw the night before. I passed her after a brief conversation(everyone on the trail is SUPER friendly) and put in earphones to jam to my music for the next 9 miles until lunch. The scenery of the Georgia landscape overlaid with mist was beautiful at the early hour. I was such at a high during my hike today! While eating my PB and trail mix tortillas, a trail angel (random Georgian) came up to me with sucker and water that he was giving hikers. I finished my day as early as noon at the Gooch Mountain shelter in time to avoid the rain. There were already about ten hikers there who were cracking me up with a friendly quarrel between a girl my age and a retired Navy guy. For 8 hours we socialized, ate two dinners, filtered water, used the privy, and set up camp. It was awesome getting to know about a dozen of the fifty hikers who stayed around that shelter that night. So many are early professionals or retired folks. One girl is nearly my twin as she is applying for med school on the trail also and majored in BME and is taking two gap years and worked as a medical scribe. At the end of the night, due to my early arrival, I got a spot in the shelter so I didn't have to get my tent wet.","Stover Creek Shelter

Jake Brock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555421,"My night in the shelter wasn't much better than in my tent. I was shoulder to shoulder with a line of about 6 people on the floor of the shelter so I had to try to be considerate with a noisy sleeping pad. I got up at 6:07 after over 10 hours of being in my sleeping bag. I was ready to go at 7:10 and was the first out of the campsite. I had the tough goal of 16 miles to Neels gap which involved going over Blood mountain. I had lunch at the base of the mountain by myself in a very peaceful campsite then made it to the top after a 2.5 mile climb. The scenery was really different with its rocky, eerie feel. I quickly went over and down the mountain to Neels gap before 2pm to again avoid rain. This time I was able to book my first stay with Mountain Crossings in a bunk room filled with up to 12 other thru hikers. Nervous at first of my welcoming, they quickly considered me a bro and I settled in after resupplying on food and eating an entire pizza. I also bought rope to tie down the fly of my tent since I thoughtlessly threw it away at home. Just like every other day, I started to plan out my hike the next day. It was an easier 12 miles to Low Gap Shelter but my German friend wanted to meet up while he was in the country. So I thought about getting closer to the highway for a hitch into the town so we can hang. In the process of this decision making, I met this cyclist guy who turns out to be this big shot veterinarian/PhD consultant for pharmaceutical companies whom turns out to be pretty cool. He wanted to push forward to get to Dick Creek Gap in 2 days and wanted to do a 21 mile day with me to keep him company or some logic like that. He offered to pay for the hostel in town after hitching so I could resupply and rest then see my German friend. I thought  about it and agreed.It was good to sleep in a real bed that night even tho it was only third night in the trail.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Jake Brock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555451,"I slept great on the mattress and my sleeping bag. I got up around 6 after sleeping 10 hours so that I could get out around 7 with my new friend Clean. We went out into the foggy (always) outdoors and through the winds of the trail. We chatted about his former life in Finland (10 years), France (2) and all around the US. I was very impressed with how educated and well mannered this guy was at 47. Talking with him made the first 5 miles or so fly by. Then I put in my headphones that had been with me to find out only one bud worked. Irritated, I put them away after struggling to hear my podcast about emotional intelligence in Spanish. We met up with some other hikers (unplanned) at low gap shelter near the 12 mile point to have lunch. We powered out the next Incline to Blue Mountain and down to Unicoi gap to catch a hitch. After some time with out thumbs out(30min), we got a Jeep to pull over and hitch us to Helen. We arrived and Clean paid for the nice ass motel where we cleaned up and went out for dinner at Bigg Daddy's. We had the biggest burgers then went back for bed.","Neels gap

Jake Brock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555732,"Woke up to Clean making coffee around 530. I laid in my luxury bed (seriously one of the softest I've ever slept in) until 6 then got ready for breakfast at 630 in the lobby. It consisted of biscuits and gravy, sausage, eggs, cereal, fruit, yogurt, ect. So many good options it was overwhelming. I definitely gorged myself guiltlessly while chatting with Clean as he was looking at a full day of hiking. He got picked up from the same guy who we hitched from the day before. At this point, I had the hotel room to myself until check out at 11am. I knew I had to resupply my food for the next 4 days so I went to dollar general and  got everything for around $20. I went back to my room with a pint of butterfinger ice cream and another biscuit and ate it in my hotel room with a pop tart while watching Cops. I kept looking over my AT guide to strategize my next week or so. It was super nice to chill and let my chaffing heal... But I still felt a bit guilty as I looked outside at the nice day and I was sitting inside. I went to checkout at 11 and asked the receptionist to put my pack behind the desk but he was super awesome and told me to have the room for another 3 hours. So I chilled some more before my real checkout and walked to Wendy's to get a salad and frosty. I got to see the German architecture of the town along with their German names. I switched to our next hostel that I had reserved for my German friends and me. After waiting for the power to come back for the town, I got in my room and watched some documentary on an unknown guy who was obsessed with tickling and hired young guys thousands of dollars to be taped while tickled. Don't think I'll forget that. My German friends came around 630 finally. We caught up on the last month or so of our lives and went to Bigg Daddy's (my second time) for big burgers and $1 Pbr's! I love cheap beer! We went back to the hotel for a couple more beers then went to bed at a reasonable hour since I'm used to bedtime at 8pm and we were hiking the next morning.","Unicoa gap

Jake Brock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555733,"I woke up around 7 with my German friends and had breakfast at the hotel. We quickly set off for the trail which started off at a vertical up Rocky Mountain. The top gave us a priceless view (probably the best yet) of the surrounding mountains on a cold yet beautiful day. We continued for another 3.5 miles to the top of Tray mountain for another great view and their departure. They wanted to camp out with me at the shelter that was still another 8 miles out but were having difficulty with endurance and blisters. So we said our goodbyes and I put in my headphones to tackle the next part until low gap shelter. I made it there in good time and set up camp. With a quick dinner of ramen and mashed potatoes, I prepared for the coldest night yet. Syracuse and lasersnake who I met the first night were also there. We all went to bed before 7pm due to the freezing temperatures.","Unicoa gap

Jake Brock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555734,"I got on the trail a bit later than I wanted to. My plan was for a twenty mile day over difficult terrain to pass the GA/NC border and to Standing Indian Mountain Shelter. There were quite difficult ups and downs and my right knee began to bother me from the continued load. But I powered through and witnessed my first NC shelter which was different than GA bc it had no bear cables to protect our food. So I successfully hung my first bear bag in a nearby tree and chatted with an artist from the area who was hiking with his buddies up the mountain. He offered me beer and breakfast the following morning but I unfortunately declined both for multiple reasons. I thought it was only me and a few other unknown hikers at that shelter for the night but soon I had three other friends (Sunrise, Young Blood  and Dimbo) camp out there too. We filtered our water in this wide creek down the hill and made a campfire. Typically, everyone retreats to their tent after dark due to the cold but we were able to chat for awhile instead. Sunrise told everyone she would most likely get up around 5am for the sunrise. I was sleeping in the shelter with her and another gal named Patches that night and told her I may get up early as well. The top of the mountain was only one and a half miles up and that could be done before the sunrise at 630","Low Gap shelter 
",Standing Indian Shelter ,"Mar 04, Sat",20
Jake Brock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556042,"I heard Sunrise get up next to me in the shelter at the early hour of 515. I didn't put any ear plugs in that night so I heard everything including the scurrying or the mice around us during the night. I got up after her to make my breakfast and pack. She got out about 15 minutes before my 6am departure from camp with no one else awake yet in the pitch dark. This was the first time that I hiked in the dark using the guidance of my head lamp. Honestly, I wasn't a fan. I had to be super careful with every step and wasn't sure if I was following the white blazes correctly, having the retrace my steps every so often. It was 1.5 miles to the top of the mountain which felt like longer.  Upon finally reaching it and seeing Sunrise at the top, I was relieved to see that I wasn't too late. However, the view from  the mountain was incredible only to the west while the east was covered by trees. So we sat and watched the sunrise while she prepared her breakfast over her stove and I awkwardly tried to but lubricant on uncomfortable parts of my body without her noticing. I left first after the sunrise and started down the mountain. My first need to dig a hole to use the restroom came soon after at an inconvenient spot as I was on the mountainside with frozen ground. That day was another long 20 mile day but easier terrain. The weather was brilliant with sunny and 50s that revealed landscapes all around. I ended the day pretty exhausted at Rock Gap with a couple  others. The stream was weak for filtering but I was happy to get one of the only campsites around the shelter. I chatted with 3 section hikers and Dimbo who showed up soon after. We talked into the night since we knew we couldn't sleep the full 11 hours of nighttime. I was only 4 miles from my destination to get into town the next day for a Nero.","Standing Indian Shelter

Jake Brock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556044,"Woke up around 6 so I'd be ready to leave camp by 7. This was a success and I hiked over the mountain with knee pain all the way to the road. I got there with an hour to spare until my shuttle arrived to get into town so I chilled and looked at my AT guide book while walking around to stay warm. After about 30min a man pulled up and asked if I wanna stay in his hostel. I knew the place because of the guide book but told him I had a reservation. He told me that the owner of the other hostel stole his business the day before so I shouldn't worry about it. With the lure of more time in town and a warm car, I hopped in and stayed at his place. Everyone was super accommodating at the AT grove hostel and it was super clean. I took a shower, got my laundry done, and had a huge breakfast all before 11am! To add to that, I was able to buy a knee brace off of Lea instead of going into town looking for one. I caught up on my email and messages then went into town to get food for resupply for 4 days. I went to Dollar General and got everything plus pizza for dinner for  $31! Score! I walked back while eating pop tarts and a butterfinger ice cream with absolutely no guilt. I chilled in the hostel, watched a movie with others, chatted with my Chilean friend (can't forget my Spanish) and spoke with family. Kara is now planning to visit me in Shenandoah National Park which I hope is a success. I was very impressed with the small town of Franklin with all it had to offer.","Rock gap shelter 
",Winding stairs gap,"Mar 06, Mon",4
Jake Brock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556045,"Got a nice 9.hours of sleep and woke up at 6am. I went solo to the breakfast place called Kountry Kitchen for a big diverse breakfast like the day before. It was odd walking by myself in the dark around the small town. No one was driving or walking so I thought maybe I read the hours wrong for the restaurant. But I joined a few other old timers in the place (not at same table). I went back to the hostel and got my things together and waited for the owner to drive us back to winding stairs gap where he picked us up. We arrived there in 15min and I prepared for the rainy forecast with all my gear. The 15 mile day involved on and off rain but not too intense. At one spot, I met some guys from OU who were enjoying their spring break there. They seemed like nice frat guys and it was nice to see some fellow ohioans. I arrived at my destination shelter at 4pm with the hope of getting a spot in the shelter to avoid the rain. However, another group of spring breakers were spread out over the 7 person shelter acting like they were asleep. I was a little bothered but it wasnt too upsetting to set up my tent nearby. I did so with little rain getting in and cooked some ramen noodles in the covering in front of my tent. Then I had to filter water, set up my bear bag in the tree, cook my 2nd dinner, and put my pack down the hill under the shelter. In this process, I got my pants wet from the rain running off my rain coat. This annoyed me. I was camped on top of a hill with exposure to a Ridge that was bringing in wind which was dangerous when combined with the wetness. I climbed in my sleeping bag and warmed up.","Winding stairs gap

Jake Brock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556046,"After listening to the rain all night and shivering in my tent from the wind coming from the Ridge, I got myself up at 545. In the dark, I had to find the route to the shelter to first get my pack then my food bag. It was freaking cold and I had a hard time getting all my shit together while staying warm. In the process of packing my things and eating breakfast, the sun rose over the horizon behind me where all the wind was coming from and I got an awesome shot alongside some preteen spring breakers. I had packed away my gloves in my sleeping bag accidentally so as I put away my tent covered in frost, my hands were freezing. I had to stop several times to warm up my hands in my pockets. At this point, I was getting annoyed. Packing away wet gear looking ahead at one of the toughest days yet, it was a rough morning. I finally was on my way with all my warm gear on and went through the first 12 miles of mostly downhill while listening to a podcast on antibiotic resistance and some others. At least the day was nice in the end. I made it all the way down to the base of Sassafras mountain into the NOC. I bought a gas cannister then unexpectedly found Dingo and Young Blood taking a zero in town. I chatted with them before the 7 mile uphill that is very notorious on the trail. It seemed to never end with its eternal Incline and false summits. Finally after 4 I made it to the shelter as the first one there. I set up camp when others hikers came. I cooked a good amount of food and realized this group was definitely not my cup of tea. So I went to bed early praying that my knee would heal from the abusive 20 mile day.","Cold spring shelter

Jake Brock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556489,"Today I went only 6ish miles to Fontana Dam for a resupply pickup on food which I ordered on Amazon and then a stay in the shelter which is known for being more luxurious than others on the AT. I got to the dam around 1030 and quickly called a shuttle to take me to the village for my package. He waited in the lobby for me then took me back. I carried the package along with my gear the mile to the shelter where I met a strange crowd of pot smoking Sobos and b-line who was the weed smoker from 2 nights ago who was kinda off. I was a little uncomfortable as they got blazed off his glass bong next to me while I made food. In the end, they left and my friends unexpectedly showed up from 10 miles back. I went to the dam with Dingo so he could get a shuttle into town. I took and showed and dicked around with everyone until late when we had a fire and everyone lit up. It was a successful short day that I'm glad I took. My knee was feeling better from less abuse and a better handle on my trekking poles that reduced impact going down hill.","Sassafras gap shelter

Jake Brock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556490,"Started out the day real optimistic and feeling great after my Nero. I passed the dam and started into the smoky mountains climbing up to high elevation over 4 miles. I got a great view from the fire tower then made it to the shelter at mile 11 for lunch. My plan was to do 17 to Spence field shelter. As soon as I started my lunch, Brown Bear and Dacs showed up behind me. They snacked while we talked about the snow that had just begun to fall 5 hours early after the temp dropped from the morning. We quickly ate map bc we got cold from being stationary so we headed out. After 3 miles of fast hiking in a winter wonderland with snow covering us, we  made it to another shelter. There we met a ridge runner who told us about the trail coming up. He said weather was getting bad the next day do maybe we should hike the extra 6 miles to Derrick shelter since the terrain was difficult. We 3 guys agreed to go together bc it s dangerous with the snow and rocks. We made it through the next 9 miles through Rocky top and came out pretty tired after a personal record of 23 miles. We ate at a hurried rate to beat the cold and nightfall. We agreed to hike together the next day also since conditions could be bad.","Fontana Hilton

Jake Brock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556491,The whole shelter woke up as a group at around 730 and got things together. It was pretty damn cold and the worst part was putting on semi wet socks along with frozen shoes. I ate 2 protein bars and we were off. Snow covered the trail still and we coversed most of the way to Clingmons dome which is the highest point on the AT at 6600 ft. The original goal was to get off there and hitchhike to Gatlinburg but we learned that all the roads were closed in the area until further notice. So we all tried to find a contact in Gatlinburg for a place to stay to hide from  the frigid temps coming our way but we're disappointed to know we couldn't exit the trail for at least another day. So we got to the shelter 5 miles shy of Newfound gap which is the place to hitch. We had wet wet feet and were tired from the 15 mile day. We changed our clothes and settled in for a cold night,"Derrick shelter

Jake Brock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556492,"Around 4am it felt like someone opened a huge freezer door. It got down to 20 degrees or so and you could feel it through your sleeping bag. This time my socks were frozen solid and same with my shoes. I had to change socks and do the 5 miles to the road and possibly 15 miles down the closed highway. The hike was easy and us 5 guys arrived at newfound gap quickly. We immediately saw 2 ranger trucks and asked them about the closed highway which luckily they were opening that morning. The one ranger agreed to take us down 15 miles to Gatlinburg which greatly lifted our spirits. After being wet and cold for 2 days, we got into his warm truck and got a full tour of the town. He told us all the best places and drove us to a good hotel which was a nice price at $97 between 4 people. The receptionist gave us warm cookies and sent us to our big double bed room. We were overwhelmed by the warm showers and laundary and promise of good food. We went to Cicis pizza for $8 buffet and gorged ourselves. Later that night we went to moonshine tasting then a restaurant for a burger and beer. We went back to the hotel and met up with Charlie who would be sleeping on the floor of our hotel room. It was decided that we'd be in town till at least Thursday with the terrible weather.","Mt Collins shelter

We went down to the breakfast buffet for some great food but I couldn't eat too much which is normal after a night or drinking. We got our stuff together and went out to town via trolley to the NOC outdoor center which had everything a hiker ever needs. I bought a tyvec footprint for my tent, a fuel cannister, and picked up a food drop done via Amazon Pantry. We made our way over to the grocery store and post office where my two friends sent stuff home. Getting back to the hotel, we realized it took about 5 hours just to do a couple tasks due to the slow transportation system. We chilled in the hotel then went downstairs with plans to go to town to get some food. We'll the trolley locator lied to us and we missed it passing our hotel while we drank a beer at the bar.

For lunch, some of the guys wanted BBQ downtown so we went to eat there but I already ate my ham sandwhich and mashed potatoes as I bought food at the store to save money. During lunch, I was attempting to find a shuttle to newfound gap to get back on the trail the next morning but wasn't successful. We then went to some crazy mini golf place and got ice cream. The rest of the day was pretty chill with everyone doing their own thing in the hotel. I watched a minimalist documentary and listened to music at the pool.

Getting there was oddly satisfying since we just came from  a hotel the day before but I was hurting. We got a tour of the place then I cooked macncheese, Oatmeal, and rice.

It was a neat little town with only a handful of restaurants and stores but I kinda like places like that. I walked the half mile to the other side of the town and saw a guy who stopped me in front of the laundry mat to converse. It was another thru hiker named Million bucks who told me what he was doing in town with his wife along with some hilarious trail stories so far. I went straight to the resort and spa where I reserved an 8 person cabin for $72 for us just as Brown Bear arrived. Dacks then arrived and we showered and used modern bathrooms when Captain Jack arrived. We did our laundry and ate a huge 18oz AT burger at Spring Creek tavern with them all. Definitely noticed a high feeling with the guys after 3 days out and getting comfortable in town. Definitely enjoyed the conversation till it was time to pick up laundry and settle into our cabin. Dingo came soon after with a 26 mile day. He got his shit together as we went to resupply at the dollar general and pick up beer. Hooch came by then to complete the 6 man group for the night so we could celebrate Dacks birthday right. We brought the beer back and got to drinking rather quickly since it was already 6ish. Then went to the tavern and enjoyed more drinks and food. Didn't enjoy sitting at the bar with 6 friends since I was at the end and couldn't hear the other end of conversation.

We were all making our decisions on when to get back on the trail - either after the hot springs spa or possibly the next day since relaxing another day sounded so chill. During the spa, we decided that I was the only one who was leaving for the trail that day and the others would stay. This changed when we got out of the tub and Dacks and brown bear joined me.

Jake Brock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557394,There had been alot of unexpected events happen with the snow storm in the Smokies and injuries showing up. My quad is hurting some but I'm optimistic. My trail legs are really coming in which is super noticeable as I attack the hills with less fatigue. The views are a little repetitive now but still fantastic. I honestly look forward to each day with strategizing my moves and milage to optimize my experience and stretch the dollar. One major recent change has been the development of what some people might call a trail family. There has been 4 other guys who accumulated along the trail starting near Gatlinburg and we have been keeping pace with each other ever since. I don't think we will stick together till Maine due to different plans but it's nice to have a core team for the time being. Super enjoy my time alone hiking but good to know some folks every night near shelters. Really looking forward to last sections of TN and NC with super cool and cheap hostels.

Jake Brock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557397,Today was a tough 22 miles but nice to relax finally. I ate shit and bruised my shin then bent my trekking pole which pissed me off. But no rain despite the forecast! First night with no rain fly! Dacks just broke the news that he is getting off the trail due to finances... I thought he'd be around till New York. Shame.,"

Jake Brock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557512,"Had an uneventful morning hike after waking up with a wet sleeping bag from the rain. Got to Sams gap where Rob was scheduled to pick us up at 1pm. Checked my phone to see he texted me to tell me he was there already doing trail magic. I look in the parking lot and all I see is a big white van across the street that says ""the AT friendly van"" with a photo of Casper on the side. Shortly after I responded to the text  an old guy yells from the van and welcomes me over. I enjoy little Debbie's and pop with two other thru hikers as we chat. Soon Dacks and Brown Bear show up and we head to Robs house. He is definitely a good force of nature who helps out as many hikers as he can! He did our laundry and allowed us to take showers then off to dinner. We went to Hooters for all you can eat wings. I loved the food and ate 35 wings with fries and beer. Towards the end, Rob had a smoke and told us of a guy who wanted to meet us. Soon a guy named Dave came over and told us about how we are living his dream by hiking the AT. he offered to pay for some beer for us and we accepted. Later we were brought 2 huge pitchers of beer for us 3 to drink. After all that food, I literally couldn't fit anything else inside my stomach. So I pooped and walked around the parking lot but it didnt help. We had to give up half the beer to a stranger and left to the store to resupply. I was miserably full but got the cheapest resupply of my life. Great time running around the near empty store with the other two!","Flint Mountain Shelter

Jake Brock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557513,"Had breakfast of cereal and bagels with the crew at Robs place then he drove us out to Sams gap to start our 24 mile day. Began with an uphill where we separated into our individual paces. For some reason, I fell into this really high trance where everything was bliss on that nice spring day. The sun was shining and my backpack weighed 35 lb less than usual. I start to think about how I'm going to live my life when I get off the trail and all the changes I should make. I play with ideas during my 8 hour hikes like should I learn new languages? Visit friends from Europe and surprise them with perfect German? Bike the Transam? Stay local? It's fun to play with it. The hike was a bit tough since it was so long but much easier with day packs. We finished and went straight to the diner with Rob. Came home, had some beers with Dacks, and went to bed to do it all over again the next day","Sams gap

Jake Brock,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557515,"Was a good morning followed by a nice 20 miler with the boys. Nothing eventful but decently easy. Got back at 320 to Robs van then to shower, laundry, and pre game dinner at the buffet. We went to Golden Corral where we chowed down. Other two guys have lost significant weight (10-15lb) while I've lost 3 so I kinda feel left out.. It's nice to eat whatever I want and take advantage of buffets while I can but I'd like to get down another 15 lb before finishing, which shouldn't be too hard when I hike 20 miles a day and carry all my food with me. Decided that tomorrow I am saying bye to Rob and continuing the trail the hard way. I was able to Slackpack 44 miles these last two days with showers and restaurants following but the trail isn't supposed to be a luxury.","Erwin TN
