I did not get much sleep due to anticipation of starting the hike. The first week will be key in seeing how the body handles the pack, mileage, and hills. This is a big undertaking.

Tuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555462,At the AT archway with my parents. There is an 8.5 mile approach trail to the start of the AT trail (Springer mountain) including 6000 steps up a water fall. Spent the night in a shelter because thought it as going to rain-it did not rain. Not a big fan of shelters-to much noise and people coming and going all night (who hikes at night?).   Weather 40-50F-except on Springer Mountain freezing rain.,"Amicalola Falls Lodge

Tuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555464,"Slept in tent-first time and it rained all the time while setting up camp. A little bird got caught in my vestibule--good breakfast kidding the bird escaped and I ate oatmeal. Also, machine guns were firing not far from tent-it was the army training.

Today experienced what is called ""trail magic"" where some people treated the hikers was bbq'ed hamburgers. The picture is a shelter on the trail-they have them about every 5-6 miles. This is where a lot of hikers stay sleeping next to one another or in tents. Some hikers just tent anywhere along the trail-there are a lot of camping spots.","Poplar Stamp Gap

The visibility was around 100 feet due to fog or clouds not sure which so the photo is of a rocky portion of the trail. There are many good spots on the trail with no rocks but there are portions of the trail with a lot of rocks which are hard on the feet and knees.

Tuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555962,This morning was miserable--everything was wet due to rain and the wind was blowing. I threw my stuff in backpack and got hiking to get warm. It turned into beautiful afternoon. I hiked to US 64 which leads into Franklin NC. As soon as I hit the parking lot a gentleman-Dean--asked me if I needed a ride to Franklin--this was much appreciated. I stayed at a motel and ate a pizza.,"Carter Gap Shelter

Tuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555965,"I took what is called a Zero today where no hiking so can let the body rest and do some shopping. I bought some rain gloves (needed after hands got cold in rain the other day) and some new rain pants (not needed but my former rain pants only had Velcro to hold them up--this not work). I also talked wth Holly she said Iost too much weight (which I agree) so I need to start eating even more I.e. two dinners, big lunch etc... I also told her that I'd spend more time in cities and hotels so can eat even more. I'm told can burn 5000 calories a day hiking but no real way to carry that much food so need to try and make-up the calories when in cities.   The photo is of the hotel where I stayed.

Then, I hiked straight up (at least it seemed that way) around 3000 feet to the next shelter. I spent the night in the shelter with a couple of other hikers and 30 college kids.

Tuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556427,"I started to hike at sunrise. The hike was short 6 or so miles to Fontana Dam but the trail was covered with snow so hazardous. Then, I made it to the dam which is the Southern boundary to the Great Smoky Mountains. I hiked an additional 2.2 miles up a mountain to get to the Fontana Lodge. A lot of hikers are staying here a couple of days until the winter storm passes before entering the Smoky Mountains. In fact, the rangers where turning hikers in the Smoky mountains back to the Dam because weather was so bad. The photo gives an idea of the snow on the hike down to the dam.","Cable Gap Shelter

The weather is suppose to be ok on Thursday and then nice for several days thereafter--so good time to enter the Smoky Mountains-which can take 5-7 days to pass (so will be a while to my next update) Holly sent me a care package with a bunch of food and a Verizon flip phone. My ATT phone does not work well on the trail. I plan to eat as much as possible today to gain some calories to keep my weight up. I hope eating breakfast, brunch, lunch, snacks all day, and two dinners each day on the trail will help negate the weight loss. All the hikers have lost a bunch of weight. The photo is from just outside my room looking at the pool with the Smoky Mountains in the background--I get to climb those tomorrow.","Fontana Dam Lodge
",Fontana Dam Lodge,"Mar 15, Wed",0
Tuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557010,"Today entered the Smoky Mountains. The weather at Fontana Dam (see photo) was nice but when hiked to higher elevations 4000-5000 feet was cold (low 30s). I hiked some with a AT ridge runner who also spent the night at the shelter. In the Smoky Mountains everyone is suppose to stay in a shelter for the night and if shelter full then need to tent. Also, in Smoky Mountains I can not use my bear canister to hold food instead I need to put my food in a bag and hang it in the air using a bear cable. The bear canister weighs 2.1 pounds so not many hikers use it but I prefer just sitting the bear canister next to a tree at night rather than spending time messing with a rope to hang a food bag.","Fontana Dam Lodge

Tuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557011,"The word for this day is miserable. Freezing rain in AM with temps in low 20s to low 40s. The trail was either ice, snow or slush. I got to the shelter rather late-I'm a rather slow hiker compared to other hikers. The shelter was full so I had to use the tent. I wish to thank Engine for helping me to clear snow and ice so I could pitch the tent. At around 1AM a VERY LOUD thunder clap hit which awake everyone--Ijumped about 3feet in the air. I was camped at 4882 feet so this must make us close to the origin of thunder clap. Then it proceeded to hail and rain--everything but inner sleeping bag and 1 set of clothes was wet.","Mollies Ridge Shelter

Tuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557012,"The weather was sunny-cloudy high in 50s. But, the trail was ice, slush, or a little river--so the hiking was difficult. I did make it to the shelter in time to use it--but around 10-12 college kids on spring break showed up and could of bumped us from the shelter. In the Smoky Mountains the thru-hikers need to give their place in a shelter to non-thru-hikers. Fortunately, the college students decided to stay in their tents. I think they saw the state of the thru-hikers and did not want to bump us from the shelter. Also, today hiked to Clingman Dome which is at 6667 feet-unfortunately clouds set in so could not take a good photo--I suggest use google to see what it looks like from Clingmans Dome in good weather.","Derrick Knob Shelter

Tuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557014,"It was low 20s last night--the water frooze and boots frooze in the shelter. Most hikers where wet and cold so they headed to Newfound Gap and headed into Gatlinburg. I was one of those hikers-I originally planned to hike through the Smoky Mountains. My original plan required me to carry 7-8 days of food so my backpack was extra heavy including wet tent etc... The heavy backpack and hard hiking cause me to have stinging nerve pain in my feet.   My wife did some research and this condition (parethesias) is rather common for long distance hikers. The past few days was hard hiking-so hopefully this will not happen again. Anyways, I decided to take a zero (extra day off from hiking) in Gatlinburg.","Mt Collins Shelter

I also ate 1/2 large pizza and a few local craft beers for dinner. I need to keep my weight up as much as possible--I'm most likely less than 140 pounds. I'm going to see some of the tourist sites this afternoon. I'm passing on taking the ski lift up the mountain-I've seen the mountains from the trail-incredible views. I've seen were the fire just missed downtown Gatlinburg. The fire was devastating--there were even copy cat arsonists in North Carolina by Franklin that was also devastating.","New Found Gap

Tuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557435,The weather was perfect for hiking-sunny 50s in afternoon but clouds blocked many great views in morning. A nice way to start spring. I tented at the shelter because there where a lot of weekend hikers and they have priority to shelters in the Smoky Mountains. It rained that night-which makes breaking camp more difficult because hands get cold easy when wet. I've not mastered how to break camp wearing gloves.

The ice on the trail has mostly melted-it was still somewhat bad the day before when I had my first (hopefully last) fall where got dirty and small cut in hand. I stayed in the shelter this night.

I'm spending day doing a pack shakedown because it was too heavy at around 37 pounds. I'm sending some stuff home and will look into getting a Kevlar bear bag (so can get rid of bear canister) and look into a new back pack (since the waist belt in current backpack can not get any tighter due to weight loss). Thanks to Liz (thru-hiker last year) at REI in Dallas for taking my call and giving me some good advice on this equipment.

The younger kids can hike 20 miles but 15 miles is respectful. I had the shelter completly to my self not counting the mice which inhabit every shelter and will eat through your backpack or whatever if you leave food or wrappers in it. The mice did not bother me but it was so hot (50s or so) I sweated in the sleeping bag to make it wet which is not good. I got out off bag and slept on pad-my metabolism is in high gear.

I saw many hikers that I knew and ate breakfast, lunch and dinner with fellow hikers. I also switched backpacks to one (actually a woman's backpack) that had a better hip belt which is 2 pounds heavier but will not kill my hip and shoulders. I shipped home my old back pack, bear canister and the extra pair of pants and shirt. My apologies if the photos from here on look like I'm wearing the same clothes which I am--my shoulders appreciate the less weight.

Tuck,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558019,"Hello All, while I was taking a near zero on Hot Springs I woke up around 1am and decided I was going off the trail. My reason was two-fold: First, my weight went from147 pounds to less than 130 pounds-basically my metabolism is such that I can loose weight easily but not gain it even though I ate all I could while on the trail and during breaks. The weight loss caused my old backpack to become too small-the hip belt could not be tightened further which put the weight on my shoulders. I did switch out packs in Hot Springs-but the kicker was that the new pack was 2 plus pounds heavier. I weighed the new pack with 4 days food and just 1 liter of water and it was 40 pounds. That is too much weight to for a 130 pound and less guy to carry without causing body issues. I always said I was not going to hurt my body on this hike-it is working well and I want to keep it that way. Secondly, I've hiked the trail for 1 month and got to experience what it was like-basically very hard and rewarding. Most of the hikers are incredible people which I was glad to meet and learn from and will follow their journeys.I do plan to hike in the future-section hikes etc... I've just learned my body will not let me hike for long period of time due to weight loss.","Hot Spring NC
