Poppins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553989,"I’ve been preparing for my Appalachian Trail adventure for the past two years but I’ve arbitrarily chosen today to draft my first trail journal entry, probably because I’m finally feeling pressure to fill in the last minute gaps and wrap up my AT prep. I’ve been researching and acquiring gear and I’ve had lists of ideas growing since August, 2015. However, this weekend it hit me how rapidly this adventure is approaching. It was merely a distant dream to fantasize about until my nerves started to take over and the reality of this overwhelming ambition started to sink in.        This past weekend I had dinner with my friend Northstar (who thru hiked in 2016) and that added some momentum to my planning as he shared stories and answered my list of questions about the details I hadn’t previously considered. I was also appreciative to be at a top shack with Calvin Decker the two days preceding my weekend because he helped me get past the overwhelmed feelings that temporarily paralyzed me from continuing prep-work and reminded me why I’m excited for this adventure on the horizon. So at this point, the ball is rolling. While time appears to be moving quickly, I’m grateful that I’ve been able to allot my precious time intentionally in the past few days. I’m enjoying my life on ski patrol and as this season comes to a close, I want to make sure to remain present throughout my preparations for the next big step.",,feeling the momentum,"Jan 31, Tue",0
Poppins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554327,"Big things are happening. Bought my flight to Atlanta, GA on April 3rd and registered to start hiking on Springer Mt on April 4th. Bought lots of last minute gear items and also chopped my hair off (leaving slightly more to be shed when weather permits) because I was curious, I figure I’ve got nothing to lose and it’s less of a hassle to have to deal with.",,things are happening,"Feb 07, Tue",0
Poppins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554392,"Today I tried out my new dehydrator. My first two recipes were sweet potato bark and black bean flakes. I also made vanilla rice as part of a future rice pudding recipe and I dehydrated a bunch of apples to add to breakfasts. The dehydrator has 6 trays and seemingly holds a lot of food but I realized today that this process is going to be slow going given how much food I want to prepare. 
I often have moments where I'm feeling in over my head with this whole ordeal. I'm questing if I really want to do this hike, which I'm hoping is mainly fear and anticipation talking instead of the rational voice in my head. It's easy to become overwhelmed with all the prep work I would like to do. I hold myself to ridiculous standards and try to squeeze all of my ambitions into a time frame that's slightly too small for my desires. However, there's just enough time that I'm going to go for it. Food is so sacred and personal. I don't think I can make it through the Appalachian Trail if I'm eating gas station food along the way. 
I've been struggling to get access to a bulk food store. Finally decided to order my food at wholesale price from a bulk food website. I've found some great deals, assuming shipping is reasonable as well. I am feeling progress, but I am definitely having doubts about whether my pace is fast enough. Time is moving quickly and it doesn't help that I have a full time ski patrol life consuming my mind as well.",,Food Prep 1,"Feb 09, Thu",0
Poppins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554543,"Shout out to Tim from Basin Sports for crafting me another awesome pair of custom inserts. My first pair's been in my ski boots all season and they've been a total game changer. Happy to support my feet so they can hopefully support me in return! Apparently Tim loved these inserts so much he made himself a pair today; come spring, we'll both be rocking these soul-filled soles.",,treat your feet,"Feb 12, Sun",0
Poppins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554757,"I'm making a lot of progress with food prep. Whipped up a scrumptious ratatouille with Sabina and I'm looking forward to feasting on it in a few months and being reminded of the love that was cooked into it :-) I've been collecting materials; purchasing items and dehydrating everything in sight so today I finally started to compile meals. Also recently received my order of individualized condiment packets and today I ordered 200 lbs of wholesale nuts, dried fruits and grains. 

I'm simply eyeballing portions and figure I'll have wiggle room with the snacks I'm bringing and food I buy in town. I think I'm really going to appreciate having these tasty meals preprepared given my standards when it comes to food and my limited diet (being a lactose intolerant vegetarian). Here are some links I've used for recipes and tips. Super helpful for vegans that like to cook.

I'm quickly acquiring all of my materials so I can soon crank through meals. It was awesome to have Kate Berger's assistance making a curry spiced snack mix. Also packaged the curry and chili dishes bringing me to 31 dinners, 26 breakfasts and 17 lunches. For reference, I vacuum sealed my first meal one week ago.

Poppins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555287,I was driving myself crazy with my high expectations of myself. I have already given up my life to working on ski patrol (holiday weeks consume my life) and then I get home and cook all night. I've felt like a prisoner of this project but only because I wasn't taking the time to tend to my other needs. So I took the last two days off from cooking. Spent a night hanging out with Kate Berger and then hosted a potluck/jam night the following evening (which was a huge success). It was important to take a pause and allow myself to have fun and relax with friends. Some things I've done since my last post:- sew velcro onto my umbrella handle so I can attach it to a pack strap and have free hands- received 12 packages of various pre-dehydrated vegetables to use in future meals- made 12 chai spice mix lunches- dehydrated Red Himalayan Rice- scored a second day off for this week and potentially convince a few more ski patrol friends to cook with me- replaced the patches on my rain pants with tear aid,,Food Prep 5,"Feb 27, Mon",0
Poppins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555616,"Finally feeling like I'm making decent progress. I started making meals just over 2 weeks ago and I'm at least half done with the project. I'll be cutting it close this season, trying to fit in everything I want to but I think I just might pull all this prep off and start my adventure feeling ready to do so. I recognize my to do list will always be long, but I am setting reasonable expectations of myself current self and prioritizing to decide what needs to be done in the next month. A month from today will be my first day hiking. That date is going to sneak up on me quickly, but alternatively, a lot can happen in a month.

Poppins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557997,"Yesterday was my last day working at Killington for the season. What a wonderful winter it's been. I am very appreciative of all humans that have entered my life in the past sixth months. I've got one week until my flight to Georgia and I'll be splitting my time between Killington and Albany. Finished vacuum sealing the last of my dinners in the morning with the company of Gracie Wright! Final dinner count is 161 meals. Also spent the day getting ready for my farewell bash. Twas nice to have so many beautiful faces in one place at the same time to kick off my prep week. Seems I'll be sticking around Killington for at least a few more days (it always takes me a long time to leave a home) so I'll hopefully be seeing my coworkers more throughout the week but the party was a helpful milestone as I transition from one life to the next.

Poppins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558006,"I haven't been sleeping much, there are too many things on my to do list. But the end is in site. As soon as Monday rolls around, I'll be done with prep work whether I've done everything or not. This reminds me of the week between finishing my last college semester and the cross country road trip I did in April 2016. I'm pretty stoked about how everything is coming together. I know I will need time to truly dial it in and devise a system, but I'm getting myself pretty darn close right now and I think a near future version of myself is going to be very happy about all this work. Today I:-Cleaned my house-Finished vacuum sealing the breakfasts today (final count is 123)-Took some runs in perfect spring conditions with Moose and Natalie-Chose my first three mail drop locations-Made an anti-chafe cream with essential oils that repels bugs-Scored a free massage-Played with Luna",,"Prep week, day 2","Mar 28, Tue",0
Poppins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558590,"I've prepared for many trips before. I've spent many mornings at timberlock running around attempting to collect the exact items that we will need for our trips. I know these stresses well and now, I know it even better. These pretrip sentiments have lasted for the past two months as I have spent every free moment cooking meals, purchasing gear, testing systems, sewing and tending to old gear that needs some TLC. I'm? sitting at my gate at the Albany airport, waiting to fly to Atlanta and begin my journey back North and I'm very grateful to be leaving this portion of my adventure behind. I still have a couple items to purchase in Georgia tonight (sunscreen, a lighter etc...) and I have to figure out what addresses to give my mom for my first few re-rations but overall, I've got everything I need/want and my ducks in a line (at least as much as I can before leaving).

Poppins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558867,"made it through day one. Had a lovely send off from Porter and Sarah! They were extremely gracious hosts and helped me pull myself together last minute (with gear purchases and such). Porter and I hiked south bound for a mile together to get to the top of Springer Mt and then I went back to the parking lot, grabbed my pack and was on my way. It's crazy how warm it is here. It was 80 and super sunny all day, good thing I had my umbrella to provide some shade!The day went by pretty quickly. Didn't get my pack on my back until 2:30 but I still made it the last 6.4 miles to hawk mt campsite by 5:15. I've started to meet people but it's slow going. Still need more time to adjust to this new life but overall I'm feeling fairly comfortable here. Soaked my pasta and ratatouille for about an hour and it reconsistuted well. I love all of the food so far, super thankful for all the time I put into preparing. I'm also stoked that I didn't bring a stove, I'd be too lazy to use it and my food's great without. I could also easily score pasta water from another thruhiker if I really want hot water, I've already seen some people draining their pasta and wasting the water. I like that I can do what I want and have as much alone time or social time as I want. Definitely feels like I've been on the trail for more then 7 hours.","Springer Mt

Poppins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558878,"I didn't sleep very well last night but I'm sure that'll change soon. It started to rain as I was finishing packing my pack. New weather, still equally (if not more) happy to have an umbrella. Stopped at the shelter near by to get out of the rain and finish my sweet potato breakfast porridge. A notible quote from another hiker, ""so... what's your diet, besides healthy...?"" 
It poured all day but I stayed pretty dry. It was warm enough that I didn't need any layers other than my dress (at least that was my opinion). Stumbled upon a cave halfway through the day, it was a wonderful surprise as I came around a corner of the trail. Stopped for an hour, took my shoes off, snacked and drank some chocolate coconut milk. I've been moving at a great pace. I was passing other thruhikers all day, never got passed by anyone else (except for my hour cave break). People kept commenting on how fast I was moving as we leap frogged. I guess I'm in better shape then I thought after my winter season. I also feel more prepared then a lot of the hikers around me. My pack is lighter then anyone I've talked to yet. I have everything I want and nothing more. Quite content with my gear choices. 
Made it to the next shelter by 1:30 and ended my day early. My body's tired after my 8.4 mile day, my feet are sore and I was ready to get dry. I'm looking forward to getting in better shape and being able to crank out milage. I'm a bit surprised by how crowded it is here. There are so many thruhikers, it's a bit overwhelming. It's supposed to snow soon and most people are complaining. I kinda hope it snows. I want an excuse to wear all my layers and also, snow is much less saturating than rain.","Hawk mountain campsite
",Gooch mountain shelter,"Apr 05, Wed",8.40
Poppins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559041,"Had another rough night's sleep. There was a lightning storm hovering near my site from 9-11pm and that kept me up. The water was draining directly underneath the bed of my tent (I could see the bubbles and feel the water flowing) but my home held up well against the storm. I attempted to dry my damp clothes in my sleeping bag with my body warmth while I was sleeping at night but it turned out I didn't have enough body warmth to spare. I was quite cold. This made for a lazy morning, didn't leave camp till 11! It was tough to find the motivation to get out of my sleeping bag but I hit the trail and pushed through my days mileage in 4.5 hours. Whenever I start a new chapter, it's typically the 3rd day when I'm the most physically drained. Today was no different. My feet have been killing me and my shins hurt as a result of walking strangely to avoid making my blisters worse. I'm excited to buy wider hiking boots in town tomorrow. The rest of my body could have handled more miles but my feet need more time to adjust. Had a good view of Georgia today since it finally cleared up a bit.
It's still surreal that I'm here right now and impossible to wrap my head around how big of an undertaking this is. Feels like I've been out here for quite a long time but I haven't even dipped my toes in yet. I've been bumping into the same people repeatedly throughout the last few days which I've enjoyed. We're a traveling community, generally migrating in the same direction. Contrarily, this life also feels like a survival game show on reality TV.

Poppins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559227,"It was sunny all day today, what a wonderful change! I hiked in my Crocs and my feet were doing much better. I was able to enjoy my walking because I wasn't distracted by my painful feet. Hiked Blood mountain today, the largest mountain on the trail so far (at least in terms of time I personally spent ascending/descending). There was a dusting of snow on top. Ice chunks were falling from the tips of the trees and decorating the ground like sprinkles on a cake. I was low energy at the summit but put some music in and cruised down the mountain. It was a rocky and steep trail and I enjoyed picking lines through the rocks as if I was skiing or rafting. 
I'm used to living a crazy busy life where I've overcommitted myself but am too stubborn to compromise my ambitions and lesser my end goal. I've been nervous that committing to one thing (walking) for six months will feel limiting but I'm starting to understand the grandeur of this undertaking. While my day to day activities may be simple, this experience overall feels big, in an exciting way. I've got my whole life to build my tiny home and make projects out of trash etc.
Had my first front country experience today since starting the trail. What a wonderful time I've had here at Neels gap! I've been meeting various hikers scattered throughout the past four days and today I saw all of them at Neels gap. I scored the last bed in the bunk room. A lot of hikers were pushing forward but I decided to treat myself. Trail magic hooked me up with laundry and a free beer. Also got to shower, wash my dishes and charge my phone. What luxuries! A friend hitched into town and picked up some fresh food for dinner (cucumbers and hummus, om nom). My mail drop was supposed to be waiting for me but it hasn't arrived yet which makes me nervous. Hopefully it will come tomorrow but I'm trusting that I'll find an alternative if it doesn't make it here. This is a test of my patience and I'm intentionally trying to stay fluid throughout this journey where so much is out of my hands.
I finally feel like I'm making some friends. At this point, I've been migrating with a bubble for four days and faces are becoming more familiar. Several solo travelers have paired up and dubbed themselves ""hiking buddies"". I feel antisocial sometimes in comparison and the social pressures I'm sensing are rivaling those of my college days. I like hiking alone though, that's why I chose to hike the trail alone. There's still a sense of community regardless of if I choose a hiking partner to take on more responsibility for my well being.","Lance Creek campsites

Poppins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559328,"Today felt very busy, yet I essentially did nothing and traveled one mile further then my previous location. Frustrating day to say the least. Spent the morning killing time, waiting for the mail to arrive in hopes that there'd be a package for me. My mom mailed the food on Monday, six days ago and the package was expected to take two days to make it to GA. While I waited I bought a new pair of hiking boots. I chose to buy the men's version of the shoes I already owned because they were slightly wider and longer and seemed to do the trick.
The mail came at 11:30am, and still no resupply. I was able to make due with extra food that hikers ditched in the hiker box and some purchased food from the hostel I was staying at. I felt like I was moving through molasses all day. I always had one more thing to do and I was always slightly less organized then I wanted to be. Missing my food drop was impacting me more then I had anticipated. I was trying to be flexible and overall, I pulled my act together pretty well. It still sucks though. I put so much energy into preparing meals and figuring out a system that has been working quite well over the past few days. I feel tied down and limited by my diet but food is important to me and I like to have control over what I'm eating. I finally left Neels gap at 12:30 with hopes of hiking 12 miles that day but I was feeling very unmotivated and unprepared for my day.
A mile into my hike, I was noticing similar problems with my new shoes. There was slightly more room for my toes but I was nervous I made the wrong decision to buy the boots I chose. The friction's not just from lack of space, it's also a factor of the rigid formation of my boot and the non-breathable nature that makes my feet sweat. I was tempted to turn back and buy trail runners instead but it already had taken me seemingly forever to leave the first time around (I spent 24 hours at Neels gap!). So I kept pushing, hoping I would break the boots in throughout the next few days and wait to buy trail runners until later in the season. I took a break to tape my feet to avoid more blisters and a thruhiker that I'd yet to meet came by and started up a conversation. He convinced me to turn around and make the exchange while I still could because my boots are my most important piece of equipment and the trip back was worth it. What are the odds that this guy passed by and started a conversation saying the exact words that I needed to hear in that moment? It felt serendipitous. I turned around and trekked back to return my boots. Tomorrow will reveal if this was a good decision. 
I was discouraged when I arrived at my campsite because my day comprised of waiting around for disappointment and then wandering back and forth multiple times to end up a mile away from where I started. I am moving forward though. Since arriving at Neels gap I've done laundry, showered, demoed hiking boots, bought trail runners, acquired more aquamira and socks and managed to muster up (hopefully) enough food to get me to Hiawassee (where I'm expecting there will actually be a mail drop waiting for me, maybe even two). Definitely felt discouraged especially since I feel pressure to match the momentum of the hikers around me. I'm not the only one who took a zero day today (knee injuries and norovirus are abundant and forcing hikers to take time off) but I do feel like I'm starting to fall behind. I'm ready to start picking up more miles and feel like I'm actually making a dent in this monster of an undertaking. Tomorrow is a new day and hopefully my body will allow me to pick up the pace.

I'm glad I took a zero day (or nero because I actually traveled one mile forward). I made great timing and hiked various sections chatting with other thruhikers. I somehow ended up far ahead of everyone even though I felt like I was moving slowly and they seemed to be keeping a decent pace. I'm definitely cutting it close on food for these few days. I'm worried I ate too much while I was hiking today. 
Got my trail name today. I'm officially Poppins. As in, Mary Poppins :-) began with the umbrella but I thinking it fits me in other ways as well.

Poppins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559796,"I was super unmotivated today. I didn't leave the campsite until 10:30. I was taking my sweet time. Everyone had left and many had already passed from the campsite two miles back. The trail worked its magic though and as I was finishing packing my pack, two of my friends hiked by and insisted I join them. It was a good motivation to get started. Everyone seemed exhausted and low energy today. We've been hiking for a week now, it was 80 degrees and sunny and there was a lot of elevation changes. We were dragging. I was able to fall into a rhythm though and it was nice to be social periodically throughout the day. Had some fun singing tunes on the downs. I've been dreaming of margaritas all day and I've convinced everyone in my bubble to go to the Mexican restaurant in Hiawassee tomorrow for lunch. 
It's crazy it's only been a week out here. Feels like a lot longer. I'm definitly still moving in though. I started a list of projects I was to do this season. The longest (and most exciting list) are my brainstorms of food to make over a fire. I'm excited to bake things and roast veggies. I'm pretty stoked to go to town tomorrow. My last interaction with civilization was overwhelming but I know what to expect this time so hopefully that will help me navigate through all the luxuries that I want to take advantage of. I'm hesitant to expect my food drop to come tomorrow because I don't want to get my hopes up. I will be bummed if this one also doesn't arrive but I am going to a grocery store for the first time so that's at least a good thought to fall back on. 
I like the people I'm traveling with but they are still superficial relationships. I keep trying to remind myself of how new I am to this life. This week I've been traveling with several groups or pairs. We've named one group the power goon squad. I enjoy their company a lot and it's entertaining to watch them camp together because their definitely a power squad. It makes me a bit jealous that I'm not out here with a buddy. They can get away with living pretty luxuriously because they share items. I'm looking forward to having friends join me on the trail when I get further north!","Cheese factory site

Poppins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560034,"Unlike the previous day, I was the first to leave the campsite this morning. I was excited to get to town. Got to the Top of Georgia hostel by about 9:30 and it didn't take long for me to decide to spend the night there (though my original intentions were to head back to the trail to sleep). These hostels are perfectly catered to thruhikers, it's a bit comical. This one gave us scrubs to wear while they did our laundry so we could wash all of our items. They shuttled us into town as well and many hikers went to town in their scrubs. I had a blast finally drinking the margaritas that I'd been dreaming about for the past few hot hiking days. The restaurant was full of thruhikers, many of them there because I had planted the seed in their heads... 
I had a very productive nero day (not quite a zero day but near it). Finally received one of my mail drops!!!! Showered, did laundry, ate hot food and lots of fruits and veggies, borrowed a drill from the hostel so I could make holes in the cap of my jar for seed sprouting, cut my nails, printed my backpackers permit for the Smokies, went to my first grocery store since starting. I hate sleeping at hostels, I never sleep much, but I do love all the amenities so it's hard to pass up the opportunity.","Vista

Poppins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560035,"I woke up fairly early this morning because I wanted to catch breakfast at the hostel and the shuttle to the trail head. One of the hostel workers was nice enough to let me use her Vitamix and I got to finish off the rest of my fruit in a smoothie. What a wonderful gift!!! I added some whole raspberries too it and brought it on the trail to be consumed throughout the day. I had somewhat rested legs today but was still tired especially since it was hot out and I didn't sleep well last night. Made it to North Carolina! That was an exciting moment. I already feel a difference in scenery. Steeper trails and generally higher elevations. The forest is much more alive then when I started. It's fun to check out the plants around me, though I wish I knew more about them. I also love that my campsite tonight is fairly wooded. There are large leaved plants between the sites so I can actually have a nook to myself. Until now, the woods have been thin enough that you can see what everyone around you is doing at all times. I'm becoming quite comfortable out here. I'm definitely getting more settled, I may even be almost done moving in. I can do all of the following things while hiking: snack, drink, brush my teeth, floss, put in sunscreen, change layers, check the map, take a picture, switch from my trekking poles to umbrella and back, etc... My pack is turning into a Mary Poppins bag, slowly but surely. This efficiency doesn't stop me from taking my hour long break each afternoon though.... I generally hike all morning, snacking and adjusting as I go and then once I sit down it takes me a while to get back up. But then I'll find the energy to crank out four more miles before settling at a camp for the night. I'm making friends and we're making plans for future town trips and shelters to stay at and such. I'm tired, but feel myself getting stronger. This is a good life overall and I'm not taking that for granted. I feel very lucky to have the resources to do a trip like this. I am also very excited to have my food back! Going to a grocery store and receiving my mail drop left me feeling in control of my diet again which has been a huge relief.","Top of Georgia

Partway through the day, I noticed a group picking plants off the side of the trail. I almost kept walking but last minute turned around and asked what plant they were searching for. Ramps! I learned a new edible plant today. I foraged for a hefty pile of ramps and continued on my way. I was slow going today, didn't feel any need to rush and I wasn't even sure if I was going to make it the full 12 miles I was aiming for but I wound up at Carter gap shelter. Mike and I were pretty stoked about the ramps and we cleaned and sauteed them together and shared them with the other hikers in the shelter during dinner. I am so impressed with myself and overjoyed to have had such a successful foraging day. My tomato pesto pasta was delicious (unlike last night's dinner) even without the fresh food and the sauteed ramps made this dish unbelievably amazing.

Spent the second half of the day walking with Mike, that was the most I've ever walked with another hiker so far on this trip. When the crowd arrived at rock gap shelter we all decided to push another 4 miles to get to town. I had been talking to the owner of the Gooder Grove and he was already half expecting to come pick us up tonight. We got to the hostel around dinner time and somehow I found the energy to check out the lazy hiker brewery in Franklin. There was an awesome bluegrass band and I saw almost everyone in my bubble at the bar. Crazy how town days work. I was exhausted by the time I made it to my tent. Excited for my first zero day tomorrow.","Carter Gap Shelter

The dogs barking all morning was a little bit less nice but I was so exhausted I barely even noticed. Glad we stocked up on eggs, bread and avocado so I could feast on a breakfast sandwich without having to walk to town first. The day passed quickly. This was the first time I'd slowed down for a day since starting? the trail and I was hit with a wave of exhaustion. I was generally productive though throughout the day but had a tough time taking care of myself. It's hard to rest when you're in an unfamiliar area with lots of people always around, lots to do and only your feet as a mode of transportation around town. I have given up a lot of resources by choosing this life. I hate how much I have to mooch off of everyone around me. I like to be able to be independent. At least I could walk to a grocery store from this hostel but I'm generally dependent on the kindness of strangers in order to meet the basic needs that I have been able to satisfy by myself for a very long time This is frustrating to me.","Gooder Grove

The rainy weather and the combination of some off days was wearing at me and I was tempted to take a zero day so I could stay in my tent forever. My tent was soaked and it was still raining and I had no desire to leave my sleeping bag. Lucky turbo snail (one of the goon squad members if y'all remember them from earlier) convinced me to at least get a few miles in because the thunderstorms weren't forcasted to hit till the afternoon. By the time I got out of my tent, most hikers had cleared out of the site, but I'm pretty used to that by now. Traveled 6 miles to a shelter and was very excited to set up there for the night. It was still midday so I would have time to journal and stretch and process all of my thoughts. I had even beat the storm! An hour later, I was quite settled. I had changed into my base layers, unpacked my bag, danced around and stretched and even got to play a song with a passerby that's carrying a ukulele! After all this, the sun came out and I was inspired to keep moving. I'd been traveling on a ridgeline in the fog for days. It cleared up this afternoon though and I could actually see what's around me! Very steep decent today (lost about 3000ft of elevation today) all the way to the bottom of the Nantahala gorge. I've been traveling through a fair amount of land that has been recently impacted by forest fires. I had a dramatic view of the destruction as I would along the ridge today. There was a gradual transition to more and more life as I continued my decent and now I'm surrounded by a green and flowery, but filled environment! Nantahala outdoor center (NOC) is an awesome spot! I'm very grateful that I found the motivation to hike a full day today and stay on track with my buddies, the goon squad. They're a positive force in my life right now; good motivators and lovely company at camp. I was greeted with a warm welcome upon my arrival to the gorge because they're weren't expecting me to hike this far. We picked up some beer, swam in the river and grabbed an awesome hidden campsite along the water. Recently, I have been questioning if I really want to do the entire Appalachian trail in one go. I'm hoping I'll fall into the pattern of this life and until then I'm? trying to remind myself that I still have agency. This way I can remember that it is my choice to be here instead of feeling obligated to be here and walk each day. I'm currenly still planning on doing it all at once, but I like to allow myself room to follow the wind and avoid expectations. Glad I had a good day because I was getting discouraged.

Nice to wake up along the river and I grabbed a big ol' breakfast at the diner with No spoon and his brother and the goon squad. I was so tempted to go rafting or rent a ducky and explore some whitewater on the Nantahala but timing didn't align. I'll come back along the trail on a road trip someday and make sure there's an inner tube in my adventure mobile.My friend from college (Laura) came to get me today. We hung out by the river for a bit and then headed to Asheville. Great to have a night away and get to visit with my friend and sister.

Then I bumped into a hiker fest at NOC and wound up getting my tent floor patched by Big Agnes because it had ripped the night before (trail karma, am I right?). Bought a footprint for my tent and a solar powered light for my tent at night and hit the trail around 10am. Climbed over 3000ft today, back into the mountains. It was gradual (spread over 6ish miles) but definitely took some energy. I was hoping to do a 14 mile day so I could get back on track with my bubble of hikers after taking two days off but I didn't know how the initial climb would factor into things. Ended up pushing all the way to Stecoah gap. Set up my tent along an old dirt road near the gap because I didn't have it in me to push 2.4 more miles to the shelter. This was the most isolated camping spot I've had yet this trip. Took my time getting settled and was feeling good but when the thunderstorms rolled in, I changed my mind and called a hostel owner who put me up for the night. The storms were forecasted to last 24 hours and I didn't want to be alone in the lightening over night. Figured I'd sleep better and was tempted to take yet another zero the following day because I hate walking up and over peaks with an umbrella in storms. I left my tent set up and escaped to find shelter. It felt serendipitous that I had met this hostel owner earlier in the day at the trail head. He left his business card and told me to call if I needed anything. Had a room to myself in a trailer that I was splitting with another hiker.

No lightning, no problem. I decided to push for another 14 mile day, had my mind set on making it to town. I was low on food and feeling antsy after my two zero days. Had to go back and pack up my soaking wet tent in the morning but besides that, my gear was nice and dry because of my indoor home for the night. The trail was testing me today. Very slippery and muddy, the trees were catching my umbrella, the mud was grabbing my poles and I was thoroughly damp. Kept plotting along though and I actually had some great inner dialogues today. Had lots of ideas circulating about goals and projects for this trip and for the next few years. I'd been meeting new hikers throughout the day and trying to find people to split a room with me at the lodge tonight. This is a nice resort and I didn't want to pay for my own room but I've fallen behind my friends and wasn't sure if I'd know anyone here. Sure enough, I bumped into friends as soon as I arrived and they invited me to join their room (Pablo, Blackfoot and Victoria who I met back at the mountain crossings hostel). They were so gracious, letting me stay in their room and they even drove me back to Stecoah gap to get my tent poles that I left when I went back to pack up in the rain this morning. My legs are tired and the arches of my feet are tired but I've got a new food drop, dry clothes, my tent poles are with me, I'm caught up with my bubble, the weather is supposed to clear up, and I'm excited to head into the Smokies!","Stecoah Wolf Creek Hostel

Grabbed some boiling water at the hotel for my tea, my breakfast, and my dinner, what a treat! I'd packed up most of my pack the night before so I took some time to catch up on journal entries before hitting the trail again. Seems some people were wondering if I quit the trail because of my short hiatus from posting blog entries. All good stories need some suspense, figured I'd keep y'all on your toes for a couple days! I started off my day walking across the Fontana dam and then had another 3000ft climb up into the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. Had an amazing 360 view from a firetower today. The trails' still a bit slick but it didn't rain during the hiking day which was quite a wonderful thing. There's a lot of mist encompassing the peaks but once in a while clear views pass by. I seem to be traveling in a bubble of women now which is nice. It's always a good feeling to be surrounded with some feminine energy. I'm back in some sort of familiar bubble. They're all melding together at this point though. I love the idea that this community is so tangibly present and supportive no matter how much or little we know each other. We all need each other to keep moving forward, whether that be mentally or physically. In order to access this community though, you need to get out of your tent every morning and keep walking, otherwise you'll start to fall behind. I think this is applicable to so many aspects of life. It often doesn't matter what you do as long as you keep moving forward. I'm somewhat glad that I've split off from my original crew. I'll probably join up with them in Hot Springs and in the meantime I've been reminded that this is my own adventure and I have the freedom to go at my own pace. I also think it's unhealthy to expect one support system to satisfy all of your needs and it's important to be in the habit of feeding off the community instead of one person or group (another thought of mine that applies to much more than my AT life).It doesn't really work to go out of your way in search of something, but the trail often provides what you need when you truly need it. Whether that be people?, certain conversations, tangible items, or weather. I'm just plotting forward, following white blazes, and having faith in the unknown and the belief that I will always (or at least often) have what I need in future moments to make it through whatever surprises might be coming my way. I'd like to make note that today a challenge was established. Gareth thinks he can sneak a large rock into my pack and get me to carry it for at least one mile without me noticing. Glad I met up with with Gareth and Jono at the shelter, I haven't camped with them in a while. We had some good 'bants' (aka banter) going between our tents.","Fontana Lodge

Add on from a future me: I loved the last four miles of the day! I was cruising along the ridgeline, barely even noticing elevation change because my body is finally settling into this life.

I had to travel back to Indian Gap and finish the 1.7 miles that I skipped the day before. I had no idea how beautiful it is up here because it was so most yesterday! I stopped at Newfound Gap for a bit. I met Beverly and when I complimented her earrings she decided to send them on a 1970 mile journey with me. Also spent some miles walking with Dick who's volunteering/doing trail maintenance in the Smokies. Loved learning about some local flowers and peaks and discovering that we have a mutual friend. 
The views from up on this ridge are unreal. The laundry list of possible complaints aren't phasing me today. I barely even noticed my fatigued or the fact that the hip belt on my pack is broken. Walking along these ridges in the Smokies reminds me of walking along the he rim of the grand canyon last year or among the red woods in California. The grandeur of the peaks and ridges takes my breath away; it makes my jaw drop everytime the trees open up and provide a view. There's sun but the cool breeze and lower temperatures due to elevation create the perfect weather for hiking. I slowed my pace toward the end of the day given that today was a big mileage day, but overall I've been cruising and I even found time to play some music along the way. I don't know know anyone in this bubble which is a nice break from the social component of this life. After my long hiking day, I had no energy left to be social. I had enough time when I got to camp to set up, feast and play some music and then I was in my tent by 8 and asleep by 9. 
Today was a good food day, probably because I splurged and decided to eat all of my best food first. Dipped Ritz crackers in hummus and added rosemary + thyme roasted sunflower seeds and craisins to the hummus for some tasty final spoonfuls.

I slept pretty heavily but was also thrown off by being in a cramped shelter that oddly enough had a locked fence facing the front so we could lock our food in the shelter with us and make it bear proof. It was unsettling to sleep in a cage. I was exhausted from hiking high mileage days and I was excited to do a 10.5 mile day today and take it easy. My feet were sore and I felt stiff but I started the day with a downhill section to some big rivers so I at least had a chance to warm up. 
I walked under I-40 today. It was funny to follow white blazes along the highway and acknowledge that that road could (and in the past has) taken me horizontally across the country, but now I am choosing to walk vertically on a slightly slower highway.
I stopped at Standing Bear Hostel shortly after. The trail went within walking distance of the hostel. I had only planned to restock on some splurge items (candy bars and such) and continue on my way. I happened upon a violin though before I departed and hung out for an extra hour or two than I'd originally intended. It was amazing to have a violin in my hands! Played all the fiddle tunes I know by the river. When I finished my repetoire, I realized that Fallen, a hiker that I'd recently met, had started to play the hostels guitar. We jammed for an hour. I love singing and it's nice to have a ukulele with me but the violin was quite special today. I was able to play the melodies in my head (unlike on a uke) and there was no pressure to think of words to accompany my melody (like when I sing). I was feeling so refreshed after playing the violin, that I was tempted to push for a longer mileage day. The hostel worker had planted a seed in my head to check out Max Patch summit today and my new friend Simba had the idea to watch the sunset on the summit and then descend to the shelter by headlamp. So much for having s short day to rest! I wound up hiking 18.8 miles today! I spent 12 hours in transit today but about 3-4 of those were breaks.
The summit of Max Patch was unbelievably beautiful. It also took my breath away. There was a 360 view of rolling hills, fields and mountains. The summit was covered in grass. We decided we've finally discovered our living room (given the assumption that the Earth is our home). The grassy field felt like a green carpet. After dinner we ran around barefoot and did some yoga. This was the first time I've had a comfortable location to do yoga since starting the trail. It was amazing to have a view of surrounding mountains no matter which way I oriented myself while stretching. It was a bit too cloudy to have a sunset but there were still quite interesting patterns of clouds and reflecting light in the sky as the sun went to bed and the moon rose. Once it got dark, Simba and I finished our last few miles of the day by headlamp. Today was so unexpected and I can barely wrap my head around how much I loved every moment. Even the ten or so miles where I was steadily plotting up a mountain and sweating my butt off. My body feels good after doing an 18.8 mile day. I'm thoroughly impressed with myself. Not sure if I'll push to Hot Springs tomorrow.

I had a list of things to take care of but was so tired and overwhelmed by the pressures to get back on the trail that it was difficult to collect and direct my thoughts. I managed to run a few errands, enough to keep going and hit the trail mid afternoon. Around 4pm I stopped for a snack break and shortly after that decided that I was done hiking for the day. Most hikers took at least two zeros in Hot Springs, I felt I deserved a nero to rest my mind. I wasn't even at a campsite, but I had decided I wanted to be done for the day. I was a bit surprised by my decision to be so indulgent in my current desires but I find that out here, you often have to stop walking and take a minute to truly take care of yourself instead of pushing through the exhaustion and letting the problems build.

I probably should have been hiking with a helmet on because so many branches and debris were falling out of the sky! When I started to get tired in the afternoon, I listened to music as an energy boost. I was dancing down the trail and trying out dance moves that could be combined with hiking. Its harder to dance while hiking than it is to dance while skiing or skating but I've got plenty more miles ahead of me to perfect my dance moves. 
I arrived at camp and shortly after my friend Gareth (who is now known as Bear Bait) rolled in as well. I thought he was ahead of me but he had actually decided to take a third zero in Hot Springs (he's fast enough that he can get away with goony moves like that). There was a big storm rolling in and we wound up having a sleepover in his two person tent. It reminded me of all my days leading Voyageurs in the Adirondacks and sharing a tent with my past coleaders. I realized that a two person tent is definitely the way to go. It's like owning a king sized bed instead of a twin. It also has great host-ability. Hopefully I can win myself one at the hiker talent show at the Trail Days Festival in a couple of weeks.

When I woke up I saw that a mouse had chewed through my food bag, potentially while it was hanging from a bear cable! I spent my morning airing out my belongings, patching my food bag and organizing my trail life a bit. I had the entire campsite to myself (besides bear bait) and the sun peaked through the clouds for almost an hour so I was enjoying myself as I sang, danced and packed up. I was originally hoping to do a long mileage day but unlike bear bait, I can't leave a campsite at 11 and still squeeze in a 20 mile day.

Ended up staying at the following shelter and finally getting an early night to sleep. It was nice to be a shelter with a new crowd of hikers because I could take some guilt free alone time.

I called for a shuttle to a hostel from the gap. I haven't stayed inside since Gatlinburg, which was at least 100 miles ago. I was cold and tired and quite literally, felt like shit.

I'm going to do 22 miles and head south bound for the section. I'm very excited to switch things up a bit. The miles should be much easier without my pack and if I'm going south bound, I'll be passing friends all day! I needed something like this to motivate me through these cold and rainy days. They have pizza here for hikers but given my special diet, the hostel owner offered to make me a stir fry and happened to list off most of my favorite vegetables. He claimed it will be waiting for me when I get back from my day hike tomorrow.

Morning Tent Time:

Something always holds me here
The warmth? The privacy?
The small ounce of comfort that seems ever fleeting?

I trace the stems of indulgence to their roots,
To find the spark feeding my fire of guilt.
I am taking care of myself, right?
Inside my tent, I try to shield the external pressures
But I am merely blinding myself to the reality around me
With the opaque green walls of synthetic fabric","Flint Mountain Shelter

Poppins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564442,"I woke up excited to start my day. The shuttle got me to the trailhead and I was hiking by 9:45. It made me a bit nervous to start my long day so late but I started my hiking day and assumed I would be moving faster because I had a lighter pack on my back. I bought a lightweight, frameless sea-to-summmit bag in Franklin which worked well enough for my day hike. It was not very efficient though. I had to stop everytime I wanted something from my bag and I often had to untie myself from the Paracord hip and chest belts that I had fashioned. I found myself constantly taking breaks and having to readjust.
Heading south bound was very exciting but also slowed my pace significantly! I was having fun socializing with my bubble throughout the day. Thruhikers can communicate with hikers behind us on the trail through the log books in shelters and yesterday morning I was expressing my wish to be able to communicate with hikers ahead of us. Well, that's exactly what slackpacking south bound for a day will give you. I passed the goon squad at the start of my miles which was nice because I hadn't seen them since Hot Springs. Found out we'll both be in Erwin tomorrow. In the middle portion of the day I passed a lot of unfamiliar faces, hikers that I have been traveling close to for a month but never knew it. I was saying hi to the north bounders I passed as if they knew that I was also a thruhiker but I was disguised as a day hiker. It felt a bit like skiing at Killington on an off day. I always wave at the lift operators out of habit but I never know if they actually recognize me.It was finally sunny again! It was cold traveling along the ridges and there were even remnants of the snow storm that I had missed when I hopped off the trail yesterday. I was thoroughly enjoying having a lighter pack. It made it much easier to run and dance as I traveled along flats and downhill sections. I was feeling stressed by time constraints though because I wasn't moving fast enough. I was getting close to Sam's Gap, the gap closest to the hostel I was staying at. I knew I had plenty of energy to finish my big mile day but didn't want to make the hostel owners come pick me up at 9pm. I called to check in though and it seemed they'd be willing to come get me so I kept pushing.
When I arrived at Sam's Gap, there was trail magic and I found myself sitting with some fellow hikers, drinking a margarita at 4:30 with 8 miles still left to hike. A few minutes later, a shuttle from nature's inn rolled up to fetch the hikers I was sitting with. It felt like a sign that it was time for me to head home for the night as well. I had put myself in an awkward position because I had chosen to head south bound for the day and I didn't get all my miles in. It would now cost me an extra night at the hostel, extra shuttle rides and put me a day behind to go back for those miles tomorrow. I'm skipping those miles for now and I don't care. Well, I may feel a little guilty, but not enough to do anything different.
It was nice to get back to the hostel at a reasonable hour. I had time to cook up some tasty vegetables and farm fresh eggs that I bought from Taft, Sarah and Michael. I've had an amazing stay here and I'm very appreciative of their hospitality. I showed up cold and wet and longing for some sense of home, or at least something comfortable. This stay was a good break to allow me to recharge a bit.","Nature's inn hiker hostel

Poppins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564443,"I woke up early enough to take another warm shower and cook up more farm fresh eggs and biscuits for breakfast. The sun was out again and it was a comfortable temperature. I can't help but think about how many miles are ahead of me. I've been feeling discouraged recently and questioning my lifestyle choices. But then I think about the alternative and I know that quiting wouldn't make my life any easier or more enjoyable. I'd have to schlep around a whole lot more than what I can fit on my back and go through yet another transition if I were to try to start another life for this spring/summer.
It felt good to have my pack on my back again today. It was also nice to proceed through my hike and have a decent idea of who to expect upon my arrival at Uncle Johnny's. I had another late start to my day (11am) but the miles were relatively easy and I got in just in time for a shuttle to town for dinner. I had just enough time to re-ration for the next two days during the shuttle trip as well. I spent the night on the floor of a cabin with the goon squad (that now includes No Spoon and Coach who was originally known at Mike). It was nice to hang with this crew again because it's been a while since I've traveled with them. I think that I've been isolating myself more than I should be. I get tired in social situations and it's often easier to be alone but not out here. I know that I'm loosing intrinsic motivation so I'm intentionally going to try to stay with friends and use them to pace me because I need some more extrinsic motivation. Most hikers took some time off in Erwin but after two nights at Nature's Inn, I feeling I was fine to keep on trekking tomorrow and keep up with this crew.","Nature's inn hiker hostel

I could definitely use some more time to relax here and check off some things on my to do list while I have internet but I still ended up hitting the trail mid morning. I did find enough time though to call osprey and request a replacement piece for my broken hip belt! I was hiking in and found the goon squad chilling at the first shelter. We were going to hike a full 12 mile day but I guess their 50lb packs were enticing them to take a nero and drink the beer they were packing in. I was pretty happy to take a nero. I took a nap and rested up. We also made a fire and roasted smores after dark. Tasted like home and reminded me of Timberlock (the summer camp I've grown up going to).,"Uncle Johnny's

Poppins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564445,"We've been aiming for a long mileage day today to make up for our nero. I was one of the first to leave because I learned a few days ago that I need to start early and end late in order to pack in a lot of miles in one day. Stumbled upon some trail magic at the first road crossing. Brother John was a bit pushy about his beliefs but the baked goods he made (I mean the baked goods that God made...?) were quite tasty. 
Coach and I wound up hiking together after the trail magic and stayed together for most of the day. It was nice to have a hiking buddy and the day passed by quickly. I was also surprised that we had a similar enough pace to stay together all day. It felt good to do another big mileage day for the first time in a bit.","Curley Maple Gap Shelter

Poppins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564446,"I made an intentional effort to leave at a decent time again this morning. It's always easier to achieve this when the weather is nice. Luckily the sun was out (and so was the dew!). I had an extra 1.2 miles today than the rest of the group because I made a detour in the morning to Greasy Creek Hostel to pick up a mail drop. Grabbed some lunch there and was back on the trail midday. I was tempted to stop hiking all day and setup earlier than intended but I kept pushing because I wanted to stick with my friends. It's nice to have a consistent sense of community out here and sometimes you have to work for that. So I allowed myself to stop for a nap and play some music midday but after that, I got back on the trail. At 4:30pm I started my ascent of Roan mountain. It was quite the big climb to end my day with, climbing 2,000ft in 4 miles. The terrain was beautiful though so I almost didn't even notice the elevation gain and how heavy my pack was post resupply. The dense evergreen forest reminded me again of my home mountains and also of the Smokies. I stopped for some dinner on the summit and then rolled into camp around 7pm. I'm currently camped at 6,200ft, the highest shelter on the Appalachian Trail. The shelter has four walls, two stories and it even has a door. We slept pretty cozy.
I saw a copperhead while hiking today and a bunny rabbit.","Campsite with piped spring

Poppins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564447,"It was raining all night but I didn't even notice since our shelter was so sturdy. The forecast called for rain and storms all day but it was fairly clear so we departed late morning. Coach and I left at the same time so we ended up hiking together. As I said the other day, I often have a tendency to isolate myself. I instinctively felt like I would rather be hiking alone today. I felt low energy and was moving slowly and I didn't want to feel pressure to move faster. In retrospect though, it was nice to have the company. I can easily get bogged down by the overcast, rainy and cold days. 
We crossed paths with a middle school class that was on a field trip on the trail. They had recently finished a unit about the Appalachian trail and they were exploring in the wind and rain with backpacks full of fruit and snacks to give to us. A few hours later, we took a break together at the first shelter we passed and checked the weather. When we saw forecasted thunderstorms in the late afternoon and heard thunder in the distance, we made the call to cut our day short and head to the next shelter 2 miles away. I would have felt guilty making that call alone but Coach was confident in his idea proposal and it didn't take much (or any) convincing to get me on board. We found a bunch of ramps to harvest just before we got to the shelter!
Coach and I thought the rest of our friends would be well ahead of us so we were surprised to bump into them at the start of the trail leading to our chosen shelter. They had taken a long break here and were about to hit the trail again but we convinced everyone to stay at overmountain shelter with us tonight. This shelter is a remodeled/retired barn. There are at least 30 of us camped out in the loft of the barn. It's a good place to take refuge from the storm and get started on the math puzzle that my friend Connor (from ski patrol) made for me.
There are a fair amount of day hikers here for a weekend trip. It's interesting to converse with them and see how much this lifestyle has been impacting the way I think. I don't think I've made any wildly new life hypotheses but I can tangibly identify the influences of my primitive lifestyle as it surfaces in my conversations about community and the way we as humans interact with our surroundings.","Roan high knob shelter

Poppins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564653,"I popped my head out of my sleeping bag around 7 this morning to notice that some of my friends had already packed up and left. No spoon had departed, turbo was cooking breakfast downstairs and galexy and coach were soon to follow. I was inspired by their early start to the day and left camp by 8:30 since I knew I had big miles ahead of me. I'm impressed that we all left camp so efficiently on a cold rainy morning. 
I hiked over two balds today, both without a view because we were in a cloud. It was windy and I had to take my umbrella out because I was getting soaked by the wind. The sun came out halfway through the day and everything changed. It's amazing how our emotions are directly impacted by the weather. The skies cleared up and we had views for the first time in a few days. I came across a campsite tucked away on the Elk River and started to get settled for the night. I swam as soon as I could and then took my time snacking and airing out my belongings. I knew the goon squad was ahead and I figured they pushed on to the shelter a few miles past. Decided it was worth it though to stay along the river and have a night to myself. However, soon galexy and coach showed up looking for me because they had seen an interesting character walk my way and they were worried. Turns out they were camped 0.3 miles down the trail so I packed up and joined them for the evening. 
The trail is pretty flat for this section so it's making it much easier to do longer days. There's a hiker festival (trail days) coming up in Damascus, VA and we're planning to walk into town just in time.","Overmountain shelter

Poppins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564654,"Between my missing gear, broken gear and items that I wish I had but have yet to purchase, I feel like I'm slightly falling apart. I'm hoping to fix everything at trail days when I can talk to vendors and get my gear fixed/replaced. I am impressed with how easy it is for me to reset these days when I arrive at a location with various amenities. I used to make lists of all the things to clean on my zero days. Now I can hike 19 miles to a campground, roll in at 7pm and be clean and ready to move on for another long day by the following 7am. I hadn't done laundry in 9 days and I hadn't cleaned myself in a week so y'all can imagine that I'm feeling pretty good right now. I'm most grateful though to have access to a real toilet. Wow, what a luxury! For some reason, the shelters haven't had privies in a while and I like to set a two hole limit for myself each day. However, my fibrus diet is not a fan of this. Toilets are by far the amenity I miss the most. 
I'm lined up well to walk into Trail Days on Thursday which I'm quite excited about. I've taken a handful of neros but I haven't actually taken a zero since Hot Springs. I'm supposedly taking three days off from the trail next weekend for this festival which should leave me feeling well rested and excited to get back on the trail, especially after I fix up all my gear and take care of things I've needed to do for a while.
I'm trying to live in the present but I can't help to get excited about the familiar places I'll pass when I get further north. Nine years ago I spent my first and only summer without visiting Timberlock (the summer camp I've grown up going to). I can't really imagine a summer without at least swinging by and visiting. I also just found out that I get summer benefits at Killington, the ski resort I worked at this winter! The trail goes right over the summit of Killington and I'm looking forward to being able to take the gondola down, visit friends and still get discounts on beer and summer activities. Definitely looking forward to being closer to home. As overwhelmed as I get in NYC, I do think it will be nice to have access to public transportation as well as any store or restaurant I could possibly imagine. I'm also looking forward to being able to go to my home in Albany and have more control over my resupplies as well as switch out my splurge items. Over the past 5 years, I've hiked 85 miles of the trail between NH and ME and I'm generally more familiar with those areas. I think it will be more comfortable to feel closer to home and have a better sense of context/ feel more accurately oriented compared to now where I plot along and blindly follow my AWOL guidebook. I'm assuming my travels will be cheaper and easier when I have friends and family to host and shuttle me places up North but I'm also nervous that I'll feel a bit overwhelmed by all the people I will want to visit or that might want to visit me. I only know two people to visit in the entire southern section and I saw them both in one visit! It seems like my experience on the northern half though will be drastically different from the southern half so I guess I'll just have to wait and see what happens. I'm hoping to take 1-2 weeks off from the trail at the end of June so I'll have to forge an entirely new community when I return. Hopping off the trail for a single day can already change your social surroundings completely! Perhaps this social dynamic shift will lend itself well to the northern half though so I will have time to visit the people I pass near without feeling pressures to keep up with my bubble and socialize with my trail fam. 
I want to give a shout out to my momma on this glorious mother's day. She's been doing an amazing job as my support system and I definitely would not have made it this far without her help! She's been sending me my food drops along the way, housing my belongings and cat and who the hell knows what else when I get closer.... (sorry and thanks in advance!).

Poppins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565656,"I started my day with the seed of an idea stuck in my head. The shelter 13 miles north was closed due to bear activity so I would have to hike a 17 mile day to get past the closed section (I was allowed to hike through it but not camp in the closed section of trail). I was also feeling quite unmotivated and the thought of another big day on the trail was less than appealing. I was expecting my new hip buckle yo arrive in the mail today but didn't want to wait around all day for the mail to come. All these thoughts tempted me to slackpack again because there was a trail head 13 miles north of me that I could catch a shuttle to. I convinced four other people to join me (three of which I had met the night before) so we could all split the shuttle fee. It also made us feel less guilty about taking a slackpack day. The group took a while to get rolling though and I didn't start hiking until 11. I learned some tricks from my first time slackpacking though so I was able to set myself up for success this time. I chose a reasonable number of miles this time for starters. I also used my regular hiking pack so I could still access the system I've established (to drink, eat and brush my teeth while I hike).
Toward the beginning of the day, I accidentally followed a trail for .4 miles away from the AT because I was supposed to turn down a road instead. So I added some extra off trail miles to my day which made the start to my day feel even slower. I got back on track and after another mile or two, I found a campsite on lake wanuga and took a midday dip. It was my first lake swim of the season which was amazing! The water was cold but also the warmest I've been in yet this year. Traveled along the lake for a bit and then bumped into some trail magic. There's a group of past thruhikers called rif raf that brings trail magic and hosts parties for hikers before trail days each year. I bumped into the goon squad here and ate some snacks with them. They were done hiking for the day but I was heading south back to Black Bear resort and had many miles left. I had a mountain to go over next. I thoroughly enjoyed the climb. It took much less energy because I had lighter pack so I easily pushed up the three miles without taking a single break. It was quite enjoyable and most of the time I was toying with the idea of running a marathon post AT (it's always fun to think of new challenges when I'm feeling motivated). Took a long break at the top with blue bird, one of my slackpacking buddies for the day. I'm really good at taking breaks. We still had 5 miles left to do by 4:30 but the sun stays out late these days so we can get away with it. The last few miles of my day were pretty flat and wound along a large river. I've been traveling on fairly flat terrain at a low elevation recently today and there's been a lot of water! I love it. I passed Laurel Falls which was probably a 70ft drop with 5 main tiers. I ended my day with a steep rocky climb. I was exhausted but as I pushed through it, I thought to myself that there's no where else I'd rather be. 
Made it back to the resort around 7:45 and my belt buckle had arrived! I ate the same dinner here as the night before: poptarts, candy bars and a beer. I'm excited to have access to a grocery store again soon, it's very limiting trying to feed myself at hostels and I haven't been able to stick to my diet.","Black Bear resort

I started this day so early and I was only planning on traveling 11 miles, so it appeared to be an easy day ahead. I said this morning that I was to make these miles last all day, and that's exactly what I did. I traveled 1 mile per hour today because I could. I hiked for an hour, and took a break for an hour until I rolled in at 7:30. It was so hot today, it was hard to move during the heat. It's also getting quite crowded on the trail. I'm seeing many people I haven't seen since the beginning. Everyone is adjusting their pace to arrive in Damascus for trail days on Thursday. The shelter was very crowded with lots of tents scattered about. This environment reminds me of the beginning of the trail. 
I feel like I'm falling apart a bit. I've been losing random things and my gear needs some TLC. I lost my toothbrush today but luckily someone picked and up and hiked it back to me.

Poppins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565629,"I felt like I was moving slowly this morning as I took my time packing up camp. I looked at my watch though when I started hiking for the day and realized it was only 9am. If you recall, the campsites are becoming crowded as everyone is attempting to walk into Damascus for Trail Days and all of the bubbles are coalescing. I was deceived this morning and thought I was behind schedule because most of the campsite left early. Yesterday afternoon was unbearably hot to hike in so I was also feeling pressure to start my day early to avoid the forecasted heat. After three miles I bumped into the goon squad. They were taking it easy and having a lazy morning, they were clearly in no rush to start the day. I had no idea they were ahead of me on the trail but it turns out they had night hiked past me while I was in my tent last night. It's always nice to find friends unexpectedly. I was feeling motivated this morning, much more so than the previous 1 mile per hour day. I was also low on food for the day and wanted to keep moving so I would have enough food to last me through the hiking portion of my day. I figured hanging out for a bit could act in my favor though because I had a hunch there would be trail magic starting midday at the road crossing coming up. Since Trails Days is around the corner, both with time and distance, trail magic is abundant. So I spent some time hanging out at their camp (a few minutes in Coach's hammock, some more minutes balancing on a wobbly log) but also felt pressure to keep hiking because I knew I had a lot of miles ahead of me. Sure enough, there was trail magic waiting for me at the gap. I feasted on some snacks, drank a beer and carried on. I would have had a very hungry day had I not stumbled upon this trail magic. 
I have a lot of bug bites on my legs. They started to show up yesterday and began relatively small. I'm confused as to where they all came from. They seemed to show up all at once and I haven't noticed any bugs biting me. I'm thinking it could also be an allergic reaction to a plant that I've come in contact with. The forest is very green these days and the plants are often reaching their stalks into the trail. There was long grass brushing against my legs for the next six miles of my day, teasing me and tempting me to itch the bumps. It's easier to tune out the desire to scratch them when I'm hiking though because of the meditative nature of hiking. My patience is low. I am in need of a day off to take care of myself but instead I keep being faced with new challenges. I have not had the time or means to address these issues, instead they have been piling up. I held myself together well today though, ignoring my fatigue, until I stopped at Low Gap. I sat down at a picnic table there for a break and lost all momentum. During my break, 10-20 hikers showed up and joined me. It was overwhelming and I didn't have the energy to deal with this crowd. There was talk among the goon squad of night hiking tonight which would leave 9 more miles ahead of me. I wanted to make it to the shelter 4 miles away. While I was initially interested in pushing to Virginia tonight with my friends, my thoughts shifted during this break as my energy drained. I ate my dinner because I was out of snacks. After dinner, I started hiking my last 4 miles, mainly because I wanted alone time and needed to flee the crowd. I only made it one mile before I decided to stop at a stealth campsite to journal. It was buggy, my legs were itchy, it was getting late and I had no patience. So I set my tent up and decided I was finished hiking for the day. I don't have enough water or food to afford to camp here tonight but I don't care. I don't have it in my to move any further. I also think it's important to have some alone time tonight. I have been traveling with friends now for over a week and I'm walking into Trail Days tomorrow which will be the most social weekend I've had this entire trip. I know that my future self is going to hate me for making this decision but I need to indulge in my present needs. 
I've been working on writing a song about my AT experience for the talent show at Trail Days. It's been hard to focus though because there are always people around. It was nice to have my own space for the first time in a while. I spent a while playing music tonight because I finally had a comfortable creative space. I'm not looking forward to my hike tomorrow because I have barely any food or water. The next water source is 4 miles away and I have 14 miles until Damascus where I can buy food. I am comfortable enough for now though so that is what I am going to focus on. I can't help but scratch my legs now that I am lacking the meditative distraction of hiking. I thought I had Benadryl with me so I didn't take some from Coach earlier. Now I am alone and have no sort of anti-histamine so I will have to make it to Damascus before I can attempt to address this problem.","Iron Mountain Shelter

However, I think I would have been better off singing a song I've known for longer than one day on an instrument I've played for longer than three weeks. I think I would have won a prize if I'd sung a song I actually knew well. I guess I'll have to try again next year because they give out a fair amount of gear to the winners. 
I feel a sense of family here. I'm camping with people I've known for only a day or two but we're all looking out for each other and coexisting as a community. I love it! This is a special place. Many people return to Trail Days year after year as a way to reunite with their trail family. The people I'm camping with have been coming here for 5-7 years, no wonder why they've got this thing dialed in so well! We ended the night with a pineapple upside down cake. I've been brainstorming about this since mile 40 so it was fun to finally follow through with this idea. The project took about 3-4 hours but was a huge success so it was totally worth it. We hollowed out a pineapple and poured cake batter into the two halves. Then we wrapped everything is tin foil and placed it on the grate over the fire for about an hour. We eventually place some coals on top which helped the cake cook through. This cake was amazing. I couldn't be more pleased. It's impossible to burn the cake through the pineapple. We left one of the cakes on the fire for hours so the goon squad could feast on it when they came home later, and the cake was still perfect.","Trail Days (tent city)

I found a good deal at the outfitter here. The tent is 9 ounces lighter than my tent and it is designed to hold two humans. It also has two side entrances instead of one front entrance and it seems that I'll actually be able to sit up in it without my head constantly being smushed against the walls. I'm also going to send home some of my warm layers tomorrow. Now that I've cut down so many ounces, I'm going to have my mom send me my stove and pot (which totals to be a 9 ounce system). My pack will still be a bit lighter by the end of this gear exchange and I will have a significantly more luxurious life. Hopefully these adjustments will make this lifestyle more enjoyable.

and wait for my umbrellaSo I only actually made it a half of a mile outside of Damascus today despite my original hope to hike 16 miles today. I wanted to intentionally start up again feeling reset and excited to hike. I knew that if I rushed back onto the trail without allowing myself enough time to take care of everything I needed to, I would be more likely to revert to the 'falling apart' mental state that I was in during the miles leading up to Trail Days. I had a great day today. I had cereal and tea and chatted with blood moon while I packed and had a cozy morning. Then I went to a gear store and replaced my pillow as well as the cap to my MSR drom/ water bladder (I've been missing this cap for 250 miles). I shipped some warm layers and my old tent home and then spent some time sending emails on a computer at the library. They had Settlers of Catan (a board game that I love) and I was so excited that I tried to teach Blood Moon how to play. We didn't get very far into the game though because eventually, I decided it was time to get back on the trail. Blood Moon decided today that she's getting off the trail for 1.5 months and then she's going to head to Katahdin and start making her way South back to Damascus. This is called flip flopping. I have a handful of friends who've stopped hiking in Damascus. It's a tempting thought. I know that I need to at least get back on the trail though and remind myself what I would be giving up. I've spent the past five days preparing for the next leg of my trip. I've fixed up all my gear and I've even shaved the AT symbol into my hair, I can't stop now.
I started hiking at 5pm and bumped into Bad News. We only wound up hiking a half mile North of town because it was supposed to start raining again soon and I was still grumpy and skeptical about having to get back on the trail. I spent the night getting situated in my new tent home and reacclimating to the trail. I love my tent! It's a mansion compared to my old home and it's 9 ounces lighter! I did a good job of treating myself during my time off and I can see that's going to pay off. I can't believe I was considering quiting.

Poppins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566369,"Woke up to sunshine on my tent which was quite motivating. Bad News and I left around 9:30. I felt great and had a lot of energy. I've needed a good day on the trail to remind me about why I'm out here. The AT crossed the Virginia creeper trail multiple times today, a river side bike path leading to Damascus. It was a scenic day. It stayed sunny for the first half but turned windy and rainy by the afternoon. I ate tuna for lunch today. I've generally been a vegetarian for the past few years but I might turn into a pescatarian for the trail. I'm looking for a lunch option that's more than just a snack and somewhat fresh. As a lactose intolerant human, fish is a pretty darn good option to eat with my crackers.
I downloaded an audiobook called ""On Trails"" by Robert Moore and started listening to that today which was a nice change of pace. The author hiked the Appalachian trail in 2008. While he often alludes to his thruhike, the book has a wider scope and it discusses the general existence of trails and paths.
I was hoping to make it to the next shelter but chose to camp along the river 1.5 miles south of my destination. The spot was too beautiful to pass up. I'm camped alone here which is actually quite nice. My friends who pushed on toward the shelter expressed concern about the river level rising in the rain and flooding my tent. I can see the high water level on the shore and I'm no where near it. I love water and being able to swim at night. Took a dip this evening despite the rain and cooler temperatures. Still love my mansion of a tent. I can sit up comfortably and stretch out. I'm also excited that I now have the capacity to host friends who want to join me on the trail and I have two doors.  took a nap this afternoon and also played some ukulele tonight. I get to play so often that I can clearly notice my improvement at this point. People have been giving me pointers and I recently acquired some ukulele picks so I've got a lot of new things to practice. I'm excited to have another original in my repetoire as well.

Poppins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566370,"It was nice to wake up by the river. The forecast predicted a window in the rain storm this morning so ideally I would've left earlier to catch the clear skies but I was cold, wet and tired and moving too slow for that. I left around 10 and made it to the shelter I was aiming for yesterday by 11. I knew the rain was coming soon so I ate a substantial amount at the shelter so I wouldn't have to break in the rain later. Sure enough, the rain came right as I was beginning the ascent of my day, Whitetop Mountain. The summit was an exposed bald and the wind was strong without the protection of the trees. The gusts would hit me from various directions, as if it was trying to trick me and my umbrella. I ended up having to put he umbrella away because it was inverting too often. I became soaked in minutes, I guess this is what the non-umbrella folk have to deal with everytime it rains. Luckily we didn't stay on the bald for too long and I was able to resurrect my trusty umbrella shortly after the summit. The trail is saturated. At this point, I'm barely even trying to avoid the puddles and streams because my feet are soaked. I'm traveling at 5000 ft and it's cold up here. My hands are cold so instead of using my trekking poles, I have them braced under my armpit and my hands are woven together around the umbrella to share warmth. Hiking in the rain isn't bad when I can use my umbrella. Despite the weather, I'm enjoying the trail features today. I can feel that I'm on a mountain even though my scope of vision is narrowed by the fog. 
I reached a gap in the mid-afternoon and noticed a bathroom at the far end of the parking lot. 
""A roof!"" I thought to myself, ""I guess I'll take a break here""
I put on a couple layers so I wouldn't loose the last of the body warmth I'd mustered up during my hike and stood under the awning in front of the bathroom while I ate my lunch. Throughout the next hour, hikers filed in from behind me. There were four of us total, all people that I'd met earlier in the trail but none of us knew each other well. Most trail families have been jostled by the forces of Trail Days/Damascus days. The social scene is shifting.
We were all lured into taking too long of a break as we indulged in the pleasures of laughing at our misery (now relocated to inside the bathroom). We were getting too cold. Our only options were to push forward or put on dry clothes and set up camp. We decided to stay, I may have been a large force behind this outcome... It didn't take me long to wind up cozy in my sleeping bag. I'm impressed at how dry my gear is despite the amount of rain falling from the sky. It's supposed to be sunny all day tomorrow and I'm counting on that. I refuse to get out of this tent until the sun comes out again.","Creeper Trail

Poppins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566371,"I woke up to the sound of the wind pushing water off the tree branches. Some may confuse these drops on their tent with rain but in reality, i've learned that it's just the aftermath. We were immersed in thick fog this morning and thus my initial perspective of the day was not very optimistic. On my way to the bathroom; however, I noticed that the trail were significantly less saturated than the previous evening which instilled some hope in my day. I spotted two day hikers in the parking lot and asked about the weather. Apparently the sun will be out in the afternoon. 
I was full of complaints this morning. I entered Damascus less than enthused about hiking and I haven't been able to write over the negative attitude yet because it's been so cold and rainy. I don't understand why I've subjected myself such a sustained period of uncomfort! Given these factors, I took my time packing up, waiting for the sun to come out so I could partially dry my tent before putting it in my pack. I departed the campsite at noon. 
The landscape was brighter when I left the wooded campsite and entered the wide open expanses that the Appalachian Trail wove through at the start of my hiking day. I climbed Mt Rogers first thing. I'm so glad I have a view for this section of trail! If I had hiked this yesterday, I wouldn't have seen any of this. Today turned around in the blink of an eye. It's amazing how my mental health is in sync with the weather. It's also amazing how good days on the trail are often overloaded with highlights. There are high highs and low lows and not much in between. I summited the tallest mountain in Virginia today and traveled along a grassy and rocky ridgline all day. The sun was out all day and I allowed myself ample breaks to do yoga in the grass or climb the rocks I passed. I hit the 500 mile marker and I passed through the Grayson Highlands where there are wild ponies roaming in the fields. The scenery is unbelievably beautiful, I don't know how to process it. I could walk through this forever! I needed a day like this to refuel me and remind me why I'm here. 
I hiked with Tall Tales for the second half of the hike. We had been planning to night hike together to make up for the fact that we'd left at noon. I've partially been losing motivation because I've been moving so slowly on the trail. I hiked 40 miles in an 8 day time span! It's a vicious cycle, the less I hike, the less I want to hike. Tall Tales wanted to do a long day too because he's trying to catch up to his friends ahead of him so we pushed each other today. It felt good. We stopped for dinner and watched the sunset as we traversed another open ridgeline. We could look back and see everything we'd hiked that day from our kitchen window. We continued to hike into the sunset, taking breaks to climb a tree, play music or sit by the fire of a local couple camped along the trail. 
I was hit with a wave of exhaustion around 10:30 but we were expecting to make it to the shelter between 11 and 11:15 so we kept pushing. At 11:03pm, I noticed a flat enough spot that we decided to end our day before we made it to the shelter. We figured we were close but we were too tired to make it all the way. What a day it's been! I set up my new tent for the first time without rain and before long was fast asleep on my fairly slanted patch of land.

Poppins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566372,"I woke up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and noticed a headlamp shining in the area. I guess someone else is camping nearby, perhaps we're closer than we thought to the shelter. In the morning, I popped my head out of my tent to discover, we were indeed close to the shelter. In fact, we were camped 50 ft from the shelter and had no idea that was the case when we chose our campsite in the dark. I guess we knew intuitively that we had made it to our destination. The Earth is so dry this morning, it's amazing. I was able to leave my sleepy socks on when I walked around camp in the morning because I knew I wouldn't be trudging through mud on my way to the privy. I also had the luxury of packing up a dry tent. I was low on food this morning but I have two oatmeal packets and one dinner (that has 700 calories in it) to last me 9 miles which is more food than when I rolled into Damascus. I always run out of food at the end of my resupply cycle. I've been moving slower than expected though which threw everything off. I've never had such minimal access to food in my life. When I run out of food on the trail, there's often nothing to do but outwalk the problem until you have the opportunity to fix it. The miles were rocky but at least the trails are drying out so traveling was slightly less tedious than yesterday.
I was getting low on energy during my last two miles. A day hiker gave me a sleeve of Ritz crackers. I'd finished my food 4 miles ago so that was an appreciated energy boost. The guide book said there was an accessible resupply store 4 miles south of the gap I was hiking to. I've gone 500 miles without having to hitch hike, but today that would have to change. I didn't want to hitch alone so I asked around. I asked thruhikers if they wanted to join me and day hikers if they had room for me in their car. No luck. Finally, Gump Cheese, a thruhiker I met yesterday, came around the bend and he was excited to hitch with me. He didn't need food, in fact, he was trying to hitch in the opposite direction. But he had the time and didn't mind helping me out. The first 15 cars passed us but eventually, a car going the opposite direction, turned around and offered to help us out. Mitsy, Kenny and Mary were driving through the mountains for the afternoon and after talking for a bit, they invited me and Gump Cheese to spend the night at their place and enjoy the comforts their home has to offer. My clothing is soaked and I was hoping to having a night inside anyway, I couldn't pass on this gracious offer. I've had the most wonderful evening here and I can't help but feel the serendipity in this encounter. They fed me a hot meal, did my laundry, I got to take a shower and charge my items. We also played cards after dinner and painted our nails. It dumped outside this evening and was accompanied by a big ol' thunderstorm. I've had amazing luck with thunderstorms. I haven't had to hike or pitch a tent in one since my second day/night on the trail. It's as if the trail knows my aversions to them. I'm so grateful for this homestay! I was feeling quite low again today but the trail provides what I needed and reminded me about the beauty in the world and in this adventure. I found out I'm only a day behind the goon squad. That's reassuring because I've been traveling slowly and I was worried I'd be falling behind. I'm tempted to skip 14 miles and hike into Atkins tomorrow to join the crew but I think I'd feel too guilty doing that.

I decided not to skip any miles, I went back to where I had left and figured I'd catch up to friends later down the line.
We all hopped back in the car, ready for another cruise through the mountains. I got to go to a grocery store on the way back. It's important to me to have access to fresh food and thus I was hit with a wave of comfort and relief upon setting foot in the grocery store. It made me feel slightly more in control of my life and my physical health. Next, Mitzie, Kenny and Mary dropped me off at the trail head. I'm so grateful that they took me in.

I'm never truly traveling alone though. I may not feel confined by the hiking schedule of friends today but there are always more people to meet and familiar faces that I've been crossing paths with throughout the last couple of months.

As you can tell from my morning poem, I had quite the relaxing start to my day. However, shortly after I finished writing, the members of the goon squad passed by one by one, informing me of there plan to hike 18 miles per day for the next week. Coach stuck around while I packed up because he wanted to hike with me for the day. He's been too paranoid about rattlesnakes to hike with headphones in his ears. Thus he's been looking for other ways to entertain himself while hiking, for example, talking to me all day. My slow morning made for a late departure. We were walking by 12:30 and neither of us were concerned about pace because we decided early in the day that we were going to end up hiking into the night. We hiked together all day which I was somewhat surprised with because I often hike alone out here. A few times now I've walked 6-8 miles with a partner, but never 18! The conversation was flowing all day though which was a good distraction from hiking. My favorite conversation was when we each listed the kitchen appliances we owned as well as the recipes we often create. 
We stopped for dinner at a shelter and it was tough to find the motivation to hike on after that. A section hiker mentioned that tonight's the full moon and that was enough to push us forward. I made myself some vegan hot chocolate with chai mix which was a wonderful treat that a lactose intolerant (and previously stoveless) Poppins was very excited to drink. The sun set as we climbed a steep climb to Kelly's Knob. The tread was deteriorating down the slope at a 45 degree angle after too many muddy days with high traffic from hikers. The corridor was overgrown with 6ft tall stinging nettles. Eventually the trail widened and became more manuverable but the climb was seemingly endless at this point. Eventually we topped out, decended and rolled into camp by 10:30, well after hiker midnight. We were pleased with our accomplishment and ready for bed. 
I expressed to Coach today my hesitancy to match their mileage plan for the week. I barely made it through 18 miles today and I know that this late evening will lead to another late departure tomorrow morning. I don't foresee their mileage plan being sustainable for me.","Stony Creek Valley

I passed the 2nd largest oak tree on the trail today, it was quite impressive. Today was hot! We spent a fair amount of time winding through exposed fields and ridgelines so the sun was beating down on us all day. I attempted to hike with my umbrella but this dollar store replacement has a short shaft and didn't seem worth it to use for the sun. The fields were full of birds and butterflies so there were flying creatures to be ovserved in all levels of the sky. I enjoyed tiptoeing across the beautiful ridgelines but the increased sun exposure and tedious walking was tiring. We decided this portion of the trail was brutiful: brutal but beautiful. 
I didn't think I was going to catch up with the goon squad tonight because I discovered the hostel I'm resupplying at tomorrow is closer than I originally expected. Turns out they were also closer than I'd expected so I was still able to camp with them.

The thought of putting on the same salt and sweat saturated outfit that I've worn for the past 700 miles made my bug bitten skin crawl. As an added bonus, we spent the morning discussing mileage logistics. I was in a mental state that left me craving zero day after zero day, forever... But rather I sat in my tent and talked to my friends about 20 mile day after 20 mile day for seemingly, forever. Normally I would peal off and go my own pace without hesitation; however, I'm currently stuck in a slightly more complicated situation. There's a section of the trail approaching where we have the option to either paddle the Shenandoah River or hike the Shenandoah mountains. We've been discussing this trip since the beginning of the trail and I've been hoping to canoe with the goon squad down the river. While I'd love to go my own pace, I also want this trip to come into fruition.

I had a great moment sitting on a bench along the trail today (yeah, a bench!). I was journalling about parting ways with my 'trail fam' and simultaneously reflecting about how there are always more people to connect with out here when a hiker arrived who I had briefly met way back in the Smokies. Turns out we we had talked about playing music together but never crossed paths again. He played a song on my ukulele that I could sing along to and it was quite the special moment, best musical connect I've had on the trail involving my uke (the other jams I've enjoyed have always had a violin in the mix).
My plan was to hike 15 miles to Four Pines Hostel. However, halfway through the day I stopped at a river, took a dip and soon after a shuttle from the hostel arrived at the request of a hiker behind me. I took it as a sign that I was done hiking for the day. I'm not going back and making up the 7 miles I skipped today. I'm already feeling bogged down by miles and behind my bubble. Many of the friends ahead of me have skipped 25-70 mile sections. The hostel owner let me drive his van to the store. I would up running a couple shuttles for hikers to and from restaurants. It was fun to drive! There's no laundry at the hostel because the sewage system is backed up so I showered with my dress on so I could wash it as well as myself. Hiker standards are low.
I rationed my food very intentionally throughout the last 80 miles and had plenty of food to last today, my final day of this food supply period. I was proud of myself for finally avoiding the issue that has made me miserable several times in the past. Today I also received my replacement umbrella in the mail from sea to summit. Couldn't be more happy about this beautiful new piece of gear! We haven't had a rainy day since my umbrella broke, the trail provides. I also acquired another camping spoon today so I no longer need the plastic spoon I've been using for 200 miles.","Craig Creek

It was nice to catch up with my friends Calvin and Beth, from ski patrol. They are currently embarking on a thrupaddle from the Adirondacks to Maine and we got to share stories of our paralleled adventurous lifestyles. I was slow to hit the trail this morning, mainly because the shuttle ride back  to the trail had to make some pit stops along the way. I wound up skipping 14 miles today for a handful of reasons. I had decided yesterday when I bailed on my mileage plan that I was going to skip ahead to the hostel. Apparently the 6 miles north of here are flat and tedious rock walking without any views. I don't want to fall too far behind the goon squad because I'm hoping to aquablaze soon and I think this trip is going to be a large motivating force in my travels. I also haven't skipped many miles relatively speaking. I had thought about it way back near Partnership shelter but ended up walking. I believe us thru-hikers are also titled 2,000 milers, so as long as I skip less than 189 miles, I think I'm still an official thru-hiker. I'm not really sure how this works, or even who decides this.
I had an amazing hiking day along ridges and rocky cliffs. I made it to McAfee Knob, took the perfect Poppins picture and then hiked along the ridge for the afternoon with Sharky. Its amazing how people appear in my life so unexpectedly out here and how quickly you can find yourself deep in an intriguing conversation with a stranger. I barely even noticed I was hiking this afternoon because I was so engrossed in conversation. We found some ripe raspberries today! Mmmm trail candy! We've also had several animal spotting today: turtle, deer, rabit and a crawfish that was trying to get in my tent.
I called the aquablaze company today and also texted the goon squad with the information I'd received. Sharky recommended we set a date to meet in Waynesboro so that I can pace myself and know what's expected of me. The details are starting to come together and it seems that we are all excited and in need of this break from the trail. It's also a relief for me to have a plan and feel more in control of my pace. The boys are moving faster than me but they're also planning to take at least one zero, where I'd rather move slow and steady.","Four Pines Hostel

Poppins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569214,"Sharky woke me up as she hit the trail early this morning and we made plans to meet up and head to town together. I'm only 10 miles south of daleville, a decent sized town with ample stores to access. I'm hoping to run some errands and get back on the trail in the evening but I could easily be tempted to spend the night since sharky's planning to stay in town. I started hiking so early today! It was nice for a change. Passed some ripe blueberries today, the bushes were lining the trail. I dropped my pack and indulged for a long time. Eventually I had to force myself to walk away, it was quite difficult. I'm not sure how I'm going to maintain a decent pace once berry season truly kicks in. I received a text from Coach informing me that the goon squad decided to take a zero in daleville and then hitch hike up the trail the following day to get closer to No Spoon for his birthday. Their bodies were rebeling against them as a result of too many miles jam packed into too few days. He invited me to join their plans, since we'd be crossing paths again in only a handful of hours. I feel good about the plan I've set myself though and don't want to yellowblaze (hitch hike/skip) more miles if I don't feel it's necessary.
Today I made it the first section of trail already traced by my feet in years passed. Two years ago I was on a road trip with my momma from NY to Asheville. I realized we were relatively close to the AT on the drive home and insisted we go out of our way to find some white blazes in Virginia! We probably walked for a mile or two and then turned back and continued our road trip home. I was impressed how quickly I recognized this small portion of trail. I remembered the curvature of the tread weaving through the gentil hills and the combinations of various features: power lines, road crossings and railroad crossings. The trail felt familiar and this encounter helped put my current life into perspective with respect to past versions of myself. 
I met up with Sharky again within a mile of town. We made it to the road as a storm started to roll in, perfect timing! I decided to treat myself to a night in town. Sharky and I shared a room and we had the goon squad as our neighbors. It feels great to have clean clothes for the first time in 9 days. It's hot out these days and the sweat factor has been reaching new levels. I am so comfortable right now, this is unreal. I haven't stayed in a hotel like this since Gatlinburg back in the Smokies. Went to the grocery store a short walk away. This is the best market I've been to yet, great natural food/organic section.
I am getting so good at this life! I'm figuring out exactly what I need to have with me to be comfortable and carrying nothing more. I have my systems filed down to the exact number of band aids and condiments packets. I feel on top of the world right now! We are starting our canoe trip on June 24th which gives me 13 mile days without any zeros. We're aquablazing until the halfway point of the trail so I essentially have 130 miles and ten days left hiking the southern half of the AT!

I left my pack at the super 8 when I checked out so I could return to run more errands. The goon squad was waiting for a ride north from another hiker who's renting a car and taking a week off of the trail. His rental troubles left them with an afternoon to relax and I was easily lured into joining. We played a boardgame at a coffee shop and I even got my nails done this afternoon (if that doesn't say ''treat yourself"", I don't know what does). We watched a huge thunderstorm roll in and then grabbed some dinner at a Chinese restaurant. We have been meandering around a plaza today that has all the stores we could ever possibly want. I scored a pair of PJs shorts at Goodwill and grabbed some Kahlua to hike in and add to my chocolate soy milk! Eventually, I decided it was time to venture back to the trail. It was still raining but not hard.

I was excited to dance around in the rain and take a shower in it but the storm didn't hit until the evening and by then I had already cleaned up and gotten in my PJs. The thunder echoed throughout the mountains all night, making it hard to fall asleep.

Forecast called for more storms today but I was reminded yesterday of the potential inacurasy of weather reports. I almost stopped for the day at the first shelter because I had been hearing thunder on my tail all morning. I had only traveled 8 miles though and it was 1:30pm so I pushed on. I hate walking along these ridges when I'm expecting a storm, but then again, this entire trail is a ridgeline, so it's impossible to avoid. I seemed to outwalk the storm today. I always heard the rumbles of thunder in the distance but after 17 miles of walking I seemed to be in the clear.

It is so hot and humid today that my clothes are completely saturated with salt water. This is the most irritated my skin has ever been but I'm going to keep walking. I hobbled to the second shelter, ready to spend the night, but my friends TBD and Tarzan convinced me to push three more miles to a river. The miles were fairly flat today as we paralleles the Blue ridge parkway so I was able to hike 17 miles without too much trouble. Maybe I'm also getting better at zoning out and cruising despite the pains. My feet and chaffed skin was killing me by the time I arrived at camp but the swim was worth the push. It also feels good to be staying on track with the pace I set for myself. 
I got in the water as soon as I arrived to the creek. I left my clothes on so I could simultaneously do laundry. I need to change my system for hiking clothes when I get a chance because these shorts never retain way too much moisture. My skin is hurting right now but I made an antichaffe salve that will fix this over night. Now I just need to figure out how to avoid this happening again everyday. I refuse to wear those shorts again until they're dry. 
There's a good group camped here tonight. Sloth and Swamp Donkey both started the same day I did, April 4th. I've also know TBD and Tarzan since early on (leaving NOC). It's crazy how we're all traveling independently but somehow manage to maintain a similar pace, even after 2.5 months! We all hitched to a gas station to grab some snacks. It was fun to ride in the truck bed and have a breeze on my face. While I often mutter to myself, wondering how I've ended up in such miserable situations (like my hike today), I equally as often notice and point out the contrasting comfort that periodically comes my way. I was quite comfortable this evening in the truck bed and taking the several river dips. 
I saw a bear today while hiking. Comical timing after my dialogue regarding hanging my food last night. I also had a brief encounter with a local parked along the blue ridge highway. He asked if everything was going alright, insinuating that he'd be willing to help if I needed something. As much as I'd been cursing to myself about my superficial pains and struggles up until that point, I told him that I was fine and doing well.

I haven't been sleeping well so it was nice to get to rest up. I also took a chunk of my day catching up on writing blog posts (but I didn't have enough service to post them). My tent was pitched in a nook further upstream of the main swimming hole. I had the nook to myself for the day because everyone else how was camped there had departed early. I took two more dips throughout the day, making for 4 swims total. This is the deepest river I've been in this season. I could swim into the current and stay stationary as if I was on a treadmill.

At this point, the campsite had cleared out and the sun was high in the sky, so the bees were out for the day and I was the only target. It made for quite the adventure when packing up camp. Buzzing sounds filled my ears and made my stomach turn, an unexpected reaction. But before long, I had scurried away to my freedom and back onto the thin strip of Earth guiding my North. I had a big climb over Apple Orchard Mountain today but didn't notice the elevation change too much, seems I'm finally getting accustomed to this walking thing. I intentionally split off from my trail fam because these are my last days hiking in the Southern half and I wanted more alone time to reflect and exist. I'm still out of my element down here, I'm still far from home and friends and I intentionally wanted to isolate myself to see what happens. I felt the weight of my solitude today. I briefly talked to a few new faces throughout the day but I didn't see a single person I knew all day and for the most part, I was always alone. I found myself seeking human interaction because I wanted outside influences, I wanted food for thought. I discovered that I could still communicate with others even when I was alone through the lyrics of the music I was listening to. I also felt comforted listening to playlists that I've carefully crafted for myself over the years, as if I was receiving motivation from a past version of myself. A huge storm rolled in and caught me by surprise. I had learned not to trust the distant rumbles as indicators storms heading my way. I've learned to tune out these harbingers because I've been fooled by the boy who cried wolf. However, this time, the storm hit and it swept in fast. I tried to check my radar to see what was coming my way but the torrential downpour forced me to put my phone away and surrender to the storm. I usually avoid these things, I hop in my tent or walk under my umbrella. The rain was warm though and so strong that I sat on my pack and looked up at the sky and let it happen. I have wanted a shower recently anyway. I felt silly as I continued to walk along this ridge during the storm but I didn't see much of an alternative.

There's a pavilion here that the town built for hikers. There are hot showers, outlets, a shelter and campsites! I didn't send a food drop here because I've been thrown off with my jumbled aquablaze plans. This means I'm going to be resupplying for 4 days at a convenience store and a dollar general. It almost feels like a cooking show where I have limited ingredients to create some elaborate (and somewhat healthy if I'm lucky) meals for myself. I was able to do laundry and sit out a huge storm inside a building. The streets were flooding and I could see the lightning bolts extended it's arms into the surrounding mountains. I was nervous about my tent, sitting unattended across town in the storm. However, I returned soon to find dry belongings to accompany my recently cleaned laundry.

Become a containing pool
But it was bedtime
So I packed my belongings into 
Organized piles
And fell asleep
Ready to battle the rain and 
test the durability of my gear

Sure enough, I awoke pitched in a puddle
The thin fabric walls remain strong, for now
Providing  dry home for me to hide away in
I don't want to hike on until the rain stops
So I sink deeper into my sleeping pad
And feel the water level rising
0.5 inches by 8:30am
Forecast for heavy rain all day
I'm sick of being soaked
I'm sick of the irritated skin and pungent smells
I lie in my tent alone, without cell service
Debating my plans for the day
Still unsure whether or not to stay","Rod Hollow Shelter

Poppins,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571362,Made some new friends today and saw a friend that I haven't seen since the Smokies. The nature of this community will never ceases to amaze me. Spent a lot of time picking berries along the trail today! Yummm. I also stopped and aired out my tent from swamp city two nights ago (because the sun is finally shining again). My pack is still heavy because of all my soaked clothing but at least the tent is dry.I'm 4 miles from Harpers ferry. That feels good. I'm going into DC to visit friends tomorrow. Things are happening.,"Sam Moore Shelter
