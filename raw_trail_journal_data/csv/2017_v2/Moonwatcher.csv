Moonwatcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632801,"It has been a beautiful day in New Hampshire.  I crossed the Androscoggin River this morning, and was on Mt. Hayes well before noon.  In the early afternoon, I came to a spot where I was able to look back to civilization.  I’m not sure if I was looking at Shelburne, Gorham, or Berlin, NH.  
From atop Cascade Mountain, I could see north into the amazing woods of Maine.  
Keeping to my usual plan of having the first few days be short miles, I stopped for the day at the Trident Col tent site.","Rattle River Hostel, Shelburne, NH

Moonwatcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632802,"Today has been another beautiful, easy day on the AT.  Around 11:00 AM, I took a break by Dream Lake.   There was certainly no need to hurry, as my destination for the day was only another 2 miles ahead.  A sign reminded me this section of the Appalachian Trail is known as the Mahoosuc Trail.

I was at Moss Pond for a lunch break, then on to the Gentian Pond Shelter for the night.  After dark four hikers came to the shelter.","Trident Col Tent Site

Moonwatcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632803,"I was back on the trail by 9:00.  There other hikers were still packing up when I left.  On Mt. Success, I met up with one of them.  His trail name is “Socks”.  
This stretch of trail is strenuous.  There is one part where you climb almost straight up for 100 ft.  On another, I had to make my way down an almost straight drop.  
By 4:00 PM, I was at the Maine–N.H. State Line.  I soon came to a section where in 2015 I almost was stuck trying to make my way down.  I needed to take my pack off to make it through a section rock that was like going down a dumbwaiter shaft.  This time I took my pack off first and lowered it down using my bear line.  
Shortly before reaching the Carlo Col Shelter, I was at another treacherous stretch.  I sat on my bottom, carefully slid down a large flat rock, and then clamored down the rocks to the flat trail 15 feet below.  Upon arrival, I came upon Socks.  I was surprised to see him as he was traveling much faster than I was.  Socks was sitting on a makeshift log bench.  I could sense something was wrong and I asked him if he was doing okay.  He told me he had slid down the same section of rock I had just finished, but did it on his feet.  When he came to then end, he could not stop and fell headfirst over the cliff.  His shoulder was dislocated and he suspected his leg was broken.

Another hiker had managed to call the local rangers and after a few hours, a helicopter came to pick him up.

Tomorrow I hope to reach Mahoosuc Notch!   I can’t wait.  It was such fun the first time.  It is a fantastic experience.","Gentian Pond Shelter

Moonwatcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632804,"As always, I call my wife each day if cell service is available.  For the last couple of days, she has been watching the progress of Hurricane Irma.  I told her to let me know if she needed me to return.  She replied, telling me the local stores were out of water and that people were stocking up on supplies.  Hearing this news, I decided to return to Florida.  Fortunately, there is a trail and a forest road that brought me back to Gorham.  I walked for miles, and then was able to hitch a ride with some hunters who were out checking their hunting sites.  Once in Gorham, I hitched back to the Rattle River Hostel and caught the first of a series of bus rides that took me back to Boston for a flight home.
Note:  Hurricane Irma hit Florida as a Category 4 storm the morning of Sept. 10, 2017, ripping off roofs, flooding coastal cities, and knocking out power to more than 6.8 million.  We were without power for four days, but there was no damage at my home.",,View Entry,"Sep 05, Tue",0

Moonwatcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632812,"Today was a nice, easy start of the hike.  I left Bear's Den around 9:00 AM.  Near noon, I reached Crescent Rock and stopped for lunch.  The weather is very nice.  Shortly after lunch, I reached the northern end of “The Roller Coaster”.

Moonwatcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632813,"Today I have enjoyed a beautiful, cloudless, autumn day in Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland.  I managed all of this with only 14 miles of hiking.  
By 12:30 in the afternoon, my path left Virginia and passed into West Virginia. By 6:15 PM, I crossed the Shenandoah River Bridge.  Once in Harpers Ferry, I stopped at Jefferson Rock, where Thomas Jefferson stood in 1783.  Here he described the view:

""On your right comes up the Shenandoah, having ranged along the foot of the mountain a hundred miles to seek a vent.  On your left approaches the Patowmac (Potomac), in a quest of a passage also.  In the moment of their junction, they rush together against the mountain, rend it asunder, and pass off to the sea... This scene is worth a voyage across the Atlantic.""

I passed the ruins of St. John's Episcopal Church, built in 1852.

It was a real treat to eat dinner on the outdoor deck of the Almost Heaven Pub and Grill. 
Crossing the Potomac on the Goodloe Byron Memorial Footbridge, I found myself again in Maryland and walking along the C&O Canal Towpath.  As I walked, with the sun setting, I noticed the trees starting to get their fall colors.  

It was already dark as I neared the Sandy Hook Bridge.  Finding a footpath that allowed me to cut over a stream, cross the railroad tracks, and walk along Sandy Hook Road, I soon arrived at the Harpers Ferry Hostel. The hosts at the hostel were very nice.  Since the weather was so fair, I decided to tent in the back yard.","Blackburn Trail Center

Moonwatcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632814,"Today was another beautiful day on the Appalachian Trail.  Near 10:30, I dropped my pack at the Weverton Cliffs Trail and walked down to view the cliffs.  Here I found some day hikers who took some pictures of me atop the cliffs with the Potomac River in the background.
I stopped for lunch at the Ed Garvey Shelter.  This shelter is one of the finest on the trail.  It is a two-story structure with a balcony.  Here there is a nice picnic table too.

The rest of the day was full of history.  In the mid-afternoon, the path came upon the site of Gath’s Empty Tomb.  A rich man built this tomb, died poor and was buried in a Philadelphia cemetery.  A sign at the site states:

“Gath’s Empty Tomb mutely symbolizes the uncertainties of Life, Fame, and Fortune and the certainty of Death.” 
Just a few miles later, I came upon Brownsville Gap, where a Civil War battle occurred.  There is also a monument to War Correspondents in the area.

By 4:30 PM, I was at the Crampton Gap Shelter.","Harpers Ferry Hostel

Moonwatcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632815,"I packed up the tent and was on the trail at 8:00 AM.  From White Rocks Cliffs, I viewed the Maryland farmland in the valley below.

There were several Civil War displays along the way including “Death of Two Generals”, “Battle for Fox’s Gap”, and “Wise’s Field”.  There was also a tombstone-like memorial to the death of Brigadier General Samuel Garland Jr, a Confederate General. 
At the Dahlgren Back Pack campground, I set up my camp.","Crampton Gap Shelter

By 10:00 AM, I was again at the Washington Monument.  When I came through in ’12, I met my brother Ralph here for lunch.

The footbridge that crosses I-70 was again a treat.

I passed the Pine Knob Shelter and the trail to Annapolis Rock, but pulled over to see the amazing views of the valley from the Black Rock Cliffs.

My stopping point for the night, the Pogo Memorial Campsite, was right along the side of the trail.

Along the way there was another Civil War display about the Gettysburg Campaign.
I stopped for a rest and a coke at the Pen Mar County Park.  By 11:00 I was at the Mason Dixon line and crossed from Maryland into Pennsylvania.

As I walked through the woods, I came upon a most well plumaged chicken. I placed a picture of it in the Photos section.When I reached Pa. 16, I hitched to Waynesboro for a hotel. Just before sunset, I watched a nearly full “harvest moon” rise in the east.","Devils Racecourse Shelter

Moonwatcher,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632948,"Today I saw five shelters within a 3.6 mile stretch of trail.  There are two shelters at the Deer Lick Shelters site.  In Old Forge Park one finds the solitary Antietam Shelter, and finally there are the two Tumbling Run Shelters.
Once again, since I have so little distance to cover and so much time before the family reunion, my hike today was little more than playing in the woods.  It is nice to be able to do this from time to time.  Also, I feel no ""miles"" pressure having already finished the entire trail.

At the Deer Lick Shelters I met another hiker and we talked for a bit.  I was given the impression that he wasn't really doing miles so much as hanging around, which is fine by me.
There is a nice creek near the Antietam Shelter.

Sometime in the early afternoon, I came to the side trail that leads to the Rocky Mountain Shelter.  A few minutes later the trail rose to a rock covered peak.
