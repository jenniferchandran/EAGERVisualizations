Pink Panther,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522964,"I've decided that my next adventure in life is to hike the Appalachian Trail.I'll tell you why in later posts.It's the longest hiking-only footpath in America — with 2,189 miles of trail and an overall elevation gain equivalent to climbing Mount Everest 16 times. It wanders through 14 states. Every year, a couple thousand people try to hike the AT from beginning to end in one season, and a few hundred manage to accomplish it. My dream is do a thru hike, finishing it in 5-6 months. I would need to start in Georgia in April of 2017 and end by October 1, 2017. But, I also recognize that at the age of 64, I may have to do it in sections over the next couple of years.",,Getting started,"Mar 07, Mon",0
Pink Panther,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522966,"I just read these words written by Warren Doyle, the Director/Instructor of the Appalachian Trail Institute.1) Walking the entire Appalachian Trail is not recreation. It is an education and a job.2) Walking the entire Appalachian Trail is not 'going on a hike'. It is a challenging task - a journey with deeper ramifications. Are you willing to accept them and learn from them?3) Don't fight the Trail. You have to flow with it. Be cooperative with the Trail, neither competitive nor combative.4) Don't expect the Trail to respect or be sensitive to your domestic comfort level and desire (and past habits) to control your environment. In your avoidance of discomfort, you may become more uncomfortable. You can't make a mountain any less steep; a hot summer afternoon any cooler; a cold morning any warmer; and, daylight any longer. But you can actually. How?5) Time, distance, terrain, weather, and the Trail itself cannot be changed. You have to change. Don't waste any of your energy complaining over things you have no control over. Instead, look to yourself and adapt your mind, heart, body and soul to the Trail. Remember, you will be a guest in someone else's house the entire journey.6) The Trail knows neither prejudice nor discrimination. Don't expect any favors from the Trail. The Trail is inherently hard. Everything has to be earned. The Trail is a trial.7) Leave your cultural 'level of comfort' at home. Reduce your material wants while concentrating on your physical and spiritual needs.8) ""The more I know, the less I need."" Yes, one can wear one t-shirt the entire journey; you don't have to take any showers; don't need to cook your meals; one does not need a roof and four walls around them at night; you don't have to carry a canteen of water with you all the time.9) It is far better, and less painful, to learn to be a smart hiker rather than a strong hiker.10) Leave your emotional fat at home as well. Feel free to laugh, and to cry, and to feel lonely, and to feel afraid, and to feel socially irresponsible, and to feel foolish, and (most importantly) to feel free. Relive your childhood and play the game of the Trail. Roll with the punches and learn to laugh in the shadow of adversity. Be always optimistic - things could always be worse; don't become mired in the swamp of sorrow. Don't blame your discomfort or depression on the Trail or the weather, but look at yourself for not being able to adapt. The more afraid you are, the heavier your pack will be.Warren Doyle, 34,000+ miles hikedhttp://www.warrendoyle.com/ATI.html""",,"What to Expect, What to Do","Mar 08, Tue",0

It basically means don't ever do something you don't want or don't feel comfortable doing just because others are. It is your hike, and you should hike it your own way.Blue Blazing -- There are several other trails and sights to see off the AT.

Pink Panther,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/524249,"I've spent many hours in the past week reading trail journals and the book ""Onward to Katahdin"" by Jan D. Curran. So it did not surprise me when I woke at 4 a.m. this morning in the middle of a dream that I was on the trail. Actually, it was more of a nightmare. I had traveled to the trailhead and after getting there, I realized that my backpack was empty. I had forgotten to pack it. So, in the dream, I called my mother (who has been dead for 30 years) and she brought my gear to me. I'm wondering if she is going to be my guardian angel on my trip. Now, on to reality. Next week is my 64th birthday so I decided to get myself a gift. The tent I want was $100 off on Amazon this week so I ordered it. I also ordered my sleeping mattress that was on sale. I'm hoping to try both of them out when my grandkids and I go camping this summer. If they work well, I'll list them on my official gear list. I wish I was leaving for the trail this April, but I can't work out the details by then...so will keep dreaming.

Pink Panther,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/526805,"After some nagging, bribing and a little pouting, I was able to convince my husband to stop at Amicalola Falls on our way home from Florida to Ohio. (We usually just get in the car and drive the 20 hours straight through.) As I've mentioned before, I have hiked in some of the most beautiful places in the USA and Canada...but when I got out of the car at Amicalola, I felt something I've not felt in a long time. I was awe-struck!. It was a beautiful day to be there and after talking to 3 hikers who were beginning the next day, I wanted to go NOW! But it's not my turn yet. And after hiking up those 604 steps to the top of the falls, I knew I had to go home and get more prepared physically. Walking several miles a day on flat ground is not enough prep to hike up mountains. Until then...the dream lives on!",,Amicalola Falls,"Apr 03, Sun",0
Pink Panther,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/527095,"Tomorrow is April 10. My dream is to be on the trail one year from tomorrow. I want to be there on this day for a special reason. Had he lived, my son, Jason, would have celebrated his 39th birthday on that day. But leukemia ended his life when he was just 5 years old.One of the reasons I want to hike the trail is because he never got the chance to do it (if he had wanted to) so I’m going to do it for him. I want to hike the AT for other reasons too, (more about that later), but since I am doing this in memory of my little guy, I’d like to share a story about him with you. It’s a story I wrote that was published in “Guidepost” and reprinted in the “Huffington Post”. After reading this, you will understand why I am going to add a few extra ounces to my pack and take Big Jon with me. That clown was with my boy throughout his illness and I want him with me throughout the challenge that I will be facing on the trail.                                                                    Big Jon  It was early October, and we were on our way to the city to see my son’s doctor who was sixty miles from our rural home. We had left his dad and three sisters at home this time so it was just the three of us, my son Jason, his friend, Big Jon and me.         We had been able to leave a little early so we could stop at the park beside the river. Jason loved that park. Some days he pretended to fish in the river with a big stick that had a string attached to it. Four year old boys can catch huge imaginary fish with a pole like that. On that day, we stood by the river and threw stones into it just to see the ripples. He threw a little branch in too and watched it float away. Then we decided to take a walk in the fallen leaves.        “The leaves are purdy mom.”         “Yes Jason, they are.”        “They used to be green, now they are red and yellow and orange and brown.”        “Uh-huh.”        “Why?”         “Why what?”        “Why did they change colors?”        “That is what happens to leaves in the fall. They turn beautiful colors before they die and fall off the trees. Next spring, after winter is over, they will come back green again.”        “My friend Ryan died”        “Yes, Jason, I know”         “He had leukemia like me”        “I know.”        “Am I going to die, Mom?”        This is the question I knew would eventually come. The moment was here and I did not know how to answer it.        “I don’t know Jason, what do you think?”        Silence; but just for a few seconds.         “I guess I’ll die someday like Ryan did. But I think I will wait until you and Dad die too.”        “OK Jason. That sounds like a good idea. You know Dad and I will always be with you, no matter what happens, right?”        “Yea, I know.” I saw him give Big Jon a squeeze. He knew his friend would always be there too!        And the cool fall breeze dried my tears as we walked in the fallen leaves.        Then it was nine months later and he was five years and three months old. His kind doctor began to talk to him, “Jason, how would you like to go home and not have to come back to the hospital for any more needles or medicine?”         “Yea, that’s good.”        “Okay, here’s what we’ll do. You and Big Jon can go home and play with your sisters. Your Mom and Dad will take good care of you and will bring you back to see me once a week so I can see how you are doing.”        No, it wasn’t time to take him home because he was cured. It was time to take him home to die.         How do I do this? Yes, I can take care of him physically, after all, he is my little boy and I had been doing it for five years. But what do I say to him? What do I say to his sisters who are ten, eight and two?         No one had any answers for me. I knew I had to follow my heart.         Two weeks later, his cousin Mikey wanted to come and see him. We all knew it would be the last time. The night before he was to come, while I was tucking my son into bed, he looked up at me and said, “Mom? Where is my Big Jon?”         Big Jon? Now I’ll tell you who he is. He was that special friend that every sick child has. Jason’s Big Jon was a silly looking little homemade clown that Gramma gave him when he first got sick. He was named after Jason’s favorite uncle who lived far away.         Big Jon slept with Jason, ate with him, rode in the tricycle basket with him and threw sticks in the river with him. If Jason went to the hospital, Big Jon did too. When Jason had to get an IV, Big Jon would get one too. Big Jon was one of those friends who goes with you through the good and the bad things of life.         Thinking that Big Jon had been temporarily displaced in the bedtime ritual, we looked around and found him. I tucked them in, gave them both a kiss and said good night.         I was turning the lights off when I heard him whisper.        “Mom?”        “What Jason?”         “When Mikey comes tomorrow, I am going to give Big Jon to him”         My hand stopped on the light switch and it felt like a boulder had just been dumped into my chest. My heart began to ache and I had to think to breath.        “Why, Jason? Why would you want to give Big Jon to Mikey? Big Jon is your friend.”         “Because I don’t need him anymore and Mikey does.”         “Why does Mikey need Big Jon?”         “Because he doesn’t have a dad and he needs Big Jon.” Mikey’s dad was killed in an auto accident before he was born.        “But you might need Big Jon too.”         “No, Mom, I don’t need him anymore.”        The professionals told me later it was his way of telling me he knew he was going to die. By allowing him to give his beloved toy away, I could tell him that I understood that he was tired of being sick and he could go to a place where he would not need Big Jon anymore.         But that night after he was asleep, I did what any grieving mom would do. I slipped into his room, took Big Jon out of my little boy’s arms and hid him under the bed. After all, if my little boy was going to die, I would at least have Big Jon to get me through the grief filled days and nights ahead. I needed Big Jon.        The next morning, in the rush of getting ready for Mikey’s visit, Big Jon was forgotten; or so I thought. The boys had a good time even though Jason was tired, But he did have the energy to play with his hot wheels and the two of them painted some pictures.        Then it was time for Mikey to leave.         “Mom, where is my Big Jon?”         “He is around here somewhere Jason, we’ll find him later.”        “Mom, I need to find him now.”         And my heart told me that this was my child’s dying wish. What I did not know was the lesson he was about to teach me.        “Okay, Jason lets find him. Maybe he fell under the bed when you were sleeping last night”         That moment will forever live in my mind and in my heart. I watched as my son gave his friend, Big Jon to his cousin who needed him. He knew that Mikey would love and take care of Big Jon for him.         Jason died a week later. The only thing that seemed to matter was that Mom and Dad were with him and Big Jon was being loved.         And the lesson my son taught me?         He and Big Jon taught me that “God comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves have received from God.” Yes, I had read that verse from II Corinthians before but it meant nothing to me until the day Jason gave Big Jon to Mikey.        I took that lesson and became a hospice nurse, giving comfort as I had been comforted.         But that is not the end of Big Jon’s story.         On Christmas day, twenty one years after Jason gave Big Jon to Mikey, my sister in law handed me a gift wrapped package. From her mother’s heart, she said to me, “since Mikey got married this year, he doesn’t need this anymore and we thought you might like to have it back.”         Inside the box was Big Jon. He was a little more worn and had a few more stains on him, but Mikey had taken good care of him and now Big Jon was home.My goal is fit Big Jon into my pack...I want him with me on this adventure!© 2010 Brenda J.Young",,One Reason to Go,"Apr 09, Sat",0

We are thinking about starting during Trail days in Damascus on May 15 and going north to Harpers Ferry. That's a little over 550 miles. We're planning on 40 days in the wilderness. If you know anything about the Bible, you are aware that amazing things can happen in 40 days. I have almost all of my supplies now. and my new pack with all supplies except food and water is 28 pounds. A little heavier than I wanted. I took it out on a trail near our home yesterday and did 8 miles without too many problems, but it took me almost 4 hours. BIG difference walking with a pack vs. without one! LOL.The shorter trips I took over the weekend helped my learn how to adjust the pack for greatest comfort. It was a great hike and I met a lady who was taking pictures of one of our local eagle couples. She had a huge telescopic lens on her camera and got some amazing pictures. We exchanged facebook addresses and she sent me a couple pictures today. Meeting her reminded me that the AT is going to be full of potential new friends and acquaintances.

Pink Panther,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/529226,"Why? So, I’ve shared my dream to go hiking on the trail with a few people, and they always ask me why. (after they call me crazy. )There are many reasons, but it’s still difficult to explain. Let me try. First read my “about” section. Now, go to my blog http://bjyoung28.blogspot.com/and read the entry titled “Journeys” If you still don’t understand, I can only tell you that my heart is telling me to go, to accept the challenge. If it doesn’t work out, it doesn’t. But, I can always say I tried to do what my heart told me to do. If I succeed, I hope it will inspire others (my kids and grandkids, especially) to never give up on their dreams. If I don’t succeed, I hope it will help them see that it is okay to fail a few times in life. It makes the successes sweeter. If it still doesn’t make sense, perhaps this will help:""We need to find God, and He cannot be found in noise and restlessness. God is the friend of silence. See how nature - trees, flowers, grass- grows in silence; see the stars, the moon and the sun, how they move in silence... We need silence to be able to touch souls."" -Mother TeresaIf I've shared my dream with you and you have been encouraging, I thank you.

Pink Panther,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/548934,"As you know, it was a dream of mine to hike the whole 2176 miles of the trail from Georgia to Maine. The goal was to do it during the summer of 2017 when I am on Medicare so the government could pay the bill if I broke a hip. But when I found a friend who said she would do a section hike with me this year, I couldn’t pass that up because I didn’t know If I’d ever find someone to do the whole thing with me, and Ed said I couldn’t go alone. (he is pretty smart) So, in January, Peggy and I began to plan and prepare for a section hike of the trail for this summer.When Ed and I were coming home from Florida the 1st of April, I talked him into stopping at Amicalola Falls in Georgia where you get on the approach trail that goes to Springer Mt (the southern trailhead of the AT). I got to walk a little bit and talk to a few hikers who were starting their through hikes. Their excitement was contagious. But since only 1 out of 10 actually finishes, I wondered which ones would be in Maine this fall. On May 15, Peggy and I met in Damascus, VA for the start of our hike. It just happened to be the weekend of the huge trail days celebration that is held there every year. There were hundreds of hikers there and once again, the excitement rubbed off. But it didn’t take too long on the trail before the excitement wore off. The evening of the second day, when I was exhausted and cold after climbing two mountains, I slipped while crossing a stream and hurt my leg. But what choice did I have but to go on. Once you’ve committed to hiking that green tunnel, you just don’t want to get off it. What an adventure those 40 days on the trail were. When we arrived in Harpers Ferry, W.Va we were both physically exhausted and down 20 pounds. They say you burn 5000 calories a day hiking up and down mountains, and there is no way you can eat that many calories a day, especially since you have to carry your food on your back, getting off just once a week to resupply. But it wasn’t the physical change in me that counted. It was what I brought off that trail in my heart and in my mind. For as long as I can remember, I’ve been one of those people who was always planning for tomorrow and failing to enjoy the day I was living in. I remember living in the moment as a child, and the trail taught me to do that again. I came away with a renewed adoration for my God too. The splendor He created for us to enjoy is so varied. We see it, not just in nature but in our fellow human beings. There were only a few nights when I couldn’t sleep in my tent on the trail and had to sleep in a shelter with strangers from all over the country. One night it was me and Peggy, a lawyer, a laid off coal miner, a kid who was going to medical school in the fall, an 18 year old girl who was hiking the trail alone and a young married couple on their honeymoon. Talk about diversity and beauty! I was reminded often that we are not to judge others because we have not walked in their shoes and we don’t know where they have come from. And now we come to the end. I had been to the start of the trail in April, hiked the middle for 40 days and I needed to put the finish on this experience. Yesterday, on a clear beautiful day, I hiked 5 ½ miles to Baxter Peak on Katahdin Mountain in Maine. It is the northern trailhead of the AT. They say if you can climb it, you can climb any mountain on the trail. It’s probably true, I can barely walk today because that hike was excrutiatingly painful yesterday! But, having been through childbirth, I can say it is a little like that. When you go through it, you feel like you are going to die, but when it’s all over, you know it’s been worth it. From the summit of Katahdin Mt. I had a 360 degree view. From that point on earth I could see other mountains and valleys around me and beautiful lakes at my feet. I’ve never experience anything so breathtaking (except my own newborn babies). But what made it especially moving for me was a young couple who joined me there. They had started in Georgia in April, hiked the same 430 miles in the middle that I hiked, and now they were here at the end with me. I did not hike all 2176 miles with them, but I got to celebrate the end of their trip with them. And it felt like I was at the end of my journey too.","

Pink Panther,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574517,"As you can probably guess by my lack of entries, I did not do the trail this year as planned. When I made my entry in January,  I was having some pain in my left hip but thought it would resolve. By March 1, I could not even walk from my house to the mailbox. A MRI showed spondylolistheses and a ruptured disk. After therapies, the pain remained so I had spinal fusion in May. At 3 months post op, I am feeling good, walking several miles a day without pain and the dream to backpack the AT remains.  The surgeon said he is quite shocked I was able to do the 430 miles I did last summer without more difficulty, (I didn't tell him I fell several times) but he sees no reason why I cant plan on doing it next year. So we will see. My husband who was supportive last year, is not as thrilled about me going again. I think,  after his attempt to do Katahdin with me last September, he has better insight into the difficulty of trail. I will continue to dream though, and hope that the stars align in my favor for next year.","
