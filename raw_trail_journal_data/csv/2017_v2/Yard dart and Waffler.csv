Glen (Yard dart) and Bobbie (Waffler) will be headed north in 24 hours to resume our NOBO hike from Neels Gap on March 12th. Last Sept.29 we started from Springer and hiked the first 32 miles. Our gear is toward light side at approximately 26-28 lbs with 4 days food and 2L water.Glen has a Z-pack Arc Haul and for me a ULA Ohm. More info as we start on this adventure.,"

Yard dart and Waffler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556296,"So we spent our last day here in Blairsville going to Wal-Mart for a few last minute items. Yard dart was looking for another top to add extra warmth for the 17 degree over night temperatures predicted Wednesday and Thursday nights.Ended up at a place called Alexander's where he scored a nice UA coldgear base layer. Me, the Waffler wanted some thicker wool sox for sleeping. Had a light lunch at the Sawmill and Elaine picked up the German Chocolate cake for Yard dart's birthday celebration tonight. Getting laundry done and trying to get a good nights sleep in anticipation of a 9AM start.",,Blairsville GA,"Mar 13, Mon",0
Yard dart and Waffler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556365,So we woke up at 6 AM expecting to be dropped at Neels Gap to meet up with Ragamuffin and Leah around 9. Another look at the weather was not encouraging. Worse than before. So a plan was hatched to move our start date to the 16th with Ragamuffin taking us back to her mom's place in Baldwin. Hanging out there until Thursday AM and they will day hike Neels to Hogpen with us. Disappointing to say the least but reassured by so many hikers at Neels catching shuttles to God knows where to wait it out like us. Prayers for those out there. The weather is brutal for anyone staying on the trail.,"Blairsville GA

Yard dart and Waffler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556557,"All of of getting stir crazy so decided to hike the Raven Cliff Trail, a 5 mile out and back that was at low enough elevation and protected from the strong NW winds. Beautiful day but cold. 31 degrees at trailhead. The trail ascends slightly along a fast moving stream and with the freezing temperatures there were places that large icecicles hanging from trees fallen over the stream glistened in the sun. We passed several groups already descending. The trail was mainly dry with some dicey, muddy slippery patches. All of us used our poles and were wearing multiple layers, which was perfect for the conditions.Ate our lunch at the top of the falls. Afterwards we drove up to Hogpen Gap where the AT comes out. The temp. had dropped down to 27 and the hills, trail head were blanketed in 1-2 inches of snow. We will be crossing there tomorrow from Neels Gap on our way to Low Gap Shelter.Finally getting on the AT NOBO !","Baldwin GA

Yard dart and Waffler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556917,"Out first day back on the trail, where we left it last October.Accompanying us were Ragamuffin and Leah. They left their car at the parking area and Ragamuffin's cousin started hiking from Hog Pen to meet us and go back down. Started hiking at 9 AM. It was 27 degrees with clear skies and no wind. The trail conditions were a combination of dry, muddy, icy and slippery. Took a break at Wolf Laurel and Cow Rock where Chrissie (the cousin) met us. Originally we planned to leave the others at Hog Pen and go on to Low Gap. However after taking breaks for scenery and remove, put layers back on we didn't arrive at Hog Pen until almost 4.So we cut it short and tented at the water source, unofficial campsite at the Gap. We shared the site with 3 other hikers who got a nice fire going but we were too tired and just wanted to eat dinner and jump into the tent. Over night low predicted as 30 but thermometer and bodies told us it was 22.","Neels Gap

Yard dart and Waffler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556925,"Really short day purposely as Glen had a rough first day and we decided that a short day was in order. Knowing we had an easy day we stayed in our sleeping bags until we just had to get going. It had been a colder night than expected and we didn't sleep as soundly because it. I, Waffler had even stuck a couple hand warmers in my socks because my feet wouldn't get warm. The hike was uneventful and we were pleased with Low Gap Shelter, it was awesome. It is situated along a burbly brook on a slope with 3-4 level areas for tents besides a shelter. By nightfall there had to be over 50 people. A roaring fire and great conversation, meeting many new friends. We slept well with a gentle rain that started around 2:30 and only lasted a short while.","Hog Pen Gap

Yard dart and Waffler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556926,"Awoke to heavy fog and balmy temperatures around 7:30. Decided to forego hot coffee since it wasn't cold and we are low on fuel for the stove. Cafe Bustello instant espresso resolves just fine in cold water !So we shared a cup and snacked on my special blend of chocolate covered espresso beans, granola clusters, caramel almonds and yogurt raisins. On the trail by 9 ish. The first 5 miles are relatively flat and we made good time, the forest was still and peacefully quiet. Fog was really thick so we had no views.Layers came off until we reached the windy side. Then the sun started peaking through as we reached a technical stretch of rocks on a steep hill side. Every foot placement was deliberate and walking required all our concentration. However when you stopped and just looked ahead it was actually pretty cool.The blue grey rocks glistened in the sun and were sharp contrast to the green moss growing on them. The last mile was totally exposed and footing was better. We stopped .3 miles before shelter to filter water from a marginal, muddy stream. The shelter sits on a long ridge line and the wind was blowing a steady 20 with strong gusts. Only a few people there. We quickly pitched our tent and got inside for protection. Several people did end up here and by dark it was quiet, everyone trying to be sheltered not to mention the cold settling in as sun set. Heading into Hiawassee from Unicoi Gap via shuttle service by Budget Inn Hiker Motel. We need fuel and showers,laundry !","Low Gap Shelter

Yard dart and Waffler,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556973,"Wow what a windy night ! Thankful that our tent is good in wind. We felt secure and warm and woke with the sunrise and calm. Went without coffee at all and ate a protein bar as we packed. The trail down to Unicoi is steep, more 1000ft in 1.4 miles. The shuttle to pick us up was to arrive at 11:15 and if we missed it, it would be a long wait for the next one. It turned out to not be too bad, in fact it was a really nice morning. Got to trailhead at 10:20. Plenty of time left so Yard dart and I and a few others waited on the sunny side of road. There were 9 of us who ended up riding the shuttle to Hiawassee for the night. The Budget Inn is okay, old worn down but clean and plenty of HOT water and it is full tonight. All hikers. Our room wasn't ready so there was a Subway next door where we had afootlong and soup. After check in we put on our rain gear so we could do our laundry. 4 days wearing the same things makes them a bit stinky and so were we. Shower felt great ! Next was a walk .5 mile to Ingles for a few groceries. Ate dinner at BBQ Country, all reorganized, packed and ready to get back to Unicoi and resume our northbound journey.","Blue Mountain Shelter
