Outsider,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/499746,"I’ve been looking into the hammock thing and am leaning against it. What do you do above treeline and anywhere else there are no trees? Plus, that bear attack in the Smokies this week was on a kid in a hammock. I wonder if something about the positioning…. Who knows?Anyway, I’m currently looking into a two-person (probably) tent under 3 lbs that’s essentially free-standing, sets up quickly, does well in wind and rain. I will probably rely heavily on the tent, so as not to be dependent on shelters, though I’ll stay in them some, I’m sure. I have a two-person tent from REI that I’ve had several years that’s nice and light, but it’s in line for retirement.The other thing I’ve been thinking about is footwear. I have spent quite a bit of money over the years on hiking boots, and I’m now seeing a lot of recommendations for trail runners instead. I’m about 145 lbs, so I probably don’t need a lot of heavy-duty ankle protection. I just may try some trail running shoes on a practice hike or two and see how they work out.",,View Entry,"Jun 10, Wed",0
Outsider,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/499866,"Thinking about my hike inspired me to drag out my old circa-1980 Moss Solus II. No, I don't intend to take it along. It's retired. A great tent, though.",,View Entry,"Jun 11, Thu",0
Outsider,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/502913,"Yesterday, I had my first training hike for the 2017 ""assault on Katahdin."" This was in the relatively benign Umstead State Park, near my home. It finished out around 17 miles (my Garmin's battery punked out after about 14 miles and 5 hours). I hiked it with a nearly full backpack weighing about 23 pounds. Here's most of the course, if you're interested",,View Entry,"Jun 29, Mon",0
Outsider,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/507812,"This entry represents a series of tests. One, of making a journal entry with my phone, which I haven't done before. Two and three, of my new Brooks Cascadia trail shoes and my new Shock Doctor compression wrap. And lastly but certainly not leastly, my very old knee with newly torn meniscus. I tore it a few weeks ago while running. I had torn the other knee's meniscus two years ago and I guess it was a matter of time. This go-round, I had the obligatory orthopedist visit followed by MRI. As before, the verdict was torn meniscus and the recommendation was arthroscopic surgery. That's what I did the last time and after a few months it was okay again. Not like it was but okay. I actually scheduled surgery this time too at first, but after the symptoms subsided, I elected to cancel surgery at least until the fall or winter. Anyway, the hike went fine and I had no real problems with either knee. I hiked the 6-mile Company Mill trail in Umstead, near my house. I took it slow.
So far, so good.

(I think the old, scoped knee has more pain more than the newly torn one. Both seem okay at this point.)",,"Umstead Park, NC","Aug 06, Thu",0
