Maybe you found me from my TEDxUCLA talk?TEDxUCLA Hike Your Own Hike If you're interested in the 2015 or 2016 AT Journals, you can access them from the ""My Other Journals"" tab on the left.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * It's here again! In roughly 10 days. I have my flight, but the actual date of starting will depend on my lovely friend Gish, who picked me up from the trail last year in a car full of Appalachian root beer, pretzels, and Tasty Kakes. He has graciously offered to take me back to where he collected me last summer, which feels like an awfully auspicious way to start off the third summer of hiking the AT. Plus, he's basically the Ambassador of the Keystone State, and will be able to join me for some sections! (PA family, UFC, Pilgrim, and friends along the way - You are all invited to come out and day hike with me if you want!)The Pennsylvania section is notorious for being awful and rocky (and awfully rocky). The fact that the trail runs through a Superfund site where you can't drink the water is also discouraging. But it is also the state of my childhood, and runs near some places that are very important to my family (Hawk Mountain!), so I'm pretty excited to tackle it. In planning my trip this year, I think there's a good chance of me making it to Maine, barring serious injury, fire, horrific weather, or being sucked into Zero Day vortexes. Straw from last year, and Buddha from much longer ago, have been giving me great advice about preparing for the Whites, and I've contacted some friends and the family of a former student who I'll be visiting along the way. And there's going to be a Zero Week at Lake George! So there's going to be some exciting differences to this year's hike. Also, I'll be starting so far north I may very well begin in the thru-hiker bubble.I hate goodbyes, and the goodbyes this year as I prepare to go are much harder than they were before. I'm lucky they're so hard. :-)",,View Entry,"Jun 03, Sat",0
AT-AT Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568607,"What a day! Breakfast of champions at the Gish home (same baked French toast I devoured at the end of trail last year), then Gish drove me to Old Forge Picnic Area where Straw, Atlas, and I did some serious time under a pavilion last year.As we neared, we saw the road closure sign. So my return to the AT officially started with a 1-mile road walk!It was insanely hot and humid. But familiar. I took 2 or 3 breaks to take off my shoes, air my feet. I drank LOTS of water. I kept my promise to myself to keep my mileage low.I didn't see another person all day until just before the shelter. There I met two other English teachers! We first talked about how books are too heavy to take on the trail...and then shared the books we brought! Older man who studies Religion and Philosophy - Sins of Scripture. Me - second half of Sister Carrie. And then Fletch (whose name is synonymous with so many jokes thanks to the guys from high school obsessed with the movie) said, ""I brought two books by Neil Gaiman.""NEIL GAIMAN!Did I whip my head so fast that it nearly cracked? Did I start gushing about American Gods? Did I ask to take a photo of him and his books (Cheap Seats and Fragile Things) by the fire?You bet I did.Set up my tent for the first time this trip, crawled in, collapsed in the heat.

AT-AT Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568609,"The thing I appreciate about rattlesnakes is that they let you know where they are. This one was right next to the trail and caused quite a ruckus as I neared. First I tried throwing a rock to encourage him to move. Rattlesnake DGAF. I weighed my options...the foliage in the area was thick, to go around the snake would mean me scratching up my legs and seriously increasing the odds of poison ivy, ticks, and yeah, more snakes. So I hesitantly went past him, leaned as far over as I could get! (and then took photos to torment ya'll with later)Today was again stupid-hot. I drank my full load of water (3 liters) and now I'm lying on my thermarest in a clearing, eating a bowl of ramen with peanuts (no nori, alas!), and feeling pretty good. There are thru-hikers here with two huskies who have been traveling since Georgia! I've met several people who started in March at Springer. I asked the Ridgerunner at the shelter if this is the bubble, but she wasn't sure. So far, no Frankenlegs, no hiker hunger.

AT-AT Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568813,"I'm cheating a bit with today's pic - it's actually from yesterday. But you needed to see some PA rocks!

Today I passed the midpoint of the AT - one of them, at any rate. Harpers Ferry is celebrated at the psychological midpoint, so I think I celebrated that last summer. And it feels weird celebrating when I've only been hiking 3 days. The official midpoint, btw, changes every year as they add switchbacks, resections, etc.
Still, by whatever measure, I've done half!

Today I had a lovely 15 minute foot soak in a stream and reached  Pine Grove Furnace, where I could order food (veggie wrap!), charge my phone, and get wifi! (which is how I got blog entries up so quick)
I met a SOBO named Handy and we chatted for a spell about the usual: gear, food, feet, favorite places on the trail. I asked him where he thought the bubble was, and he said it's more like a lava lamp - dispersed groups of people. I like that analogy.

I didn't have a set plan of where to stay for the night - too soon to cave and stay in a hostel, too far to the next shelter. So I hiked up out of the park and looked for campsites with people. They were all empty. Finally I chose one, hung my bear bag, and settled in for what was likely to be a less-than-restful night of What Was That Noise?

And then a dad and his two young daughters (Icy Pop, Mosquito Bait, and Roadrunner) showed up! I had seen them briefly at Birch Run shelter the night before. 

Turns out, the littlest girl is nervous about sleeping in the woods...she prefers if other people are in the area.

""Me too,"" I confided.

I was so glad to hang out with them! They reminded me of 12 Feet Walking from last year.

AT-AT Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568814,"In my defense, the mega-day hadn't been the plan...

We all woke up at 6 am and chatted while packing up. Icy Pop was giving his girls a tutorial in blister popping...it was both gross and really sweet.

Convo with Icy Pop:
Me: Do you think the ""rock maze"" will actually be a maze??? (visions of John B's maze from S Town in my head)

Icy Pop: Probably not. Probably will be terrible.

Me: . . . (remembering last year, when I figured out things with cool names are trying to disguise how awful they are)

Actually, the rock mazes (there were two) today were fun. Only one part was steep enough that I had to put down my poles to pull myself up. They weren't ""mazes,"" but you could tell someone thought it would be fun to lead hikers through the rocks. All the scrambling reminded me of the young rock climbers I know back in LA, and how much fun they'd have here! (shout out to Chance and Naomi!)

Anyway, here was the rough plan for the day, and what happened. Two years ago, one of my students at UCLA invited me to stay with her family, the Pipers, who live right off the trail. It took me this long to get there! So I was planning to get there by the weekend. But then I did more miles yesterday, and the next shelter was just 10 miles - I hit it early afternoon, too soon to stop. There was a campground coming up, and the stop for the Pipers, which was even further. Surely I couldn't hit 20 on my 4th day back.

But the maps showed the last 8 miles to the Pipers were soooo flat....and it was going to rain. And with the weird spacing between shelters, and no camping allowed between them, it would be perfect...

Still, over 20 in the first week. I decided to play it by ear, see how I felt when I reached the campground. The flat hike was too tempting. Off I went!

I forgot from last year - weird flat lines on the map mean walking through fields and pastures. After all the green forest, it's such a shock to see gold fields and blue skies!

I took so many great photos. The ""Jesus light"" hit just as I emerged, and I took tons of shots with it.

And to entertain myself during the last two hours of walking...I concocted this:
(to be sung to ""The Sound of Silence"" by Simon & Garfunkel)

Hello frankenlegs, my friend
It's nice to walk with you again
Along the trail I'm slowly creeping
Fighting bugs even while sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Walking all the way to Maine

For restless days I walked alone
Up this Pennsylvania stone
Beneath a halo of mosquitoes 
I turned my face to a few SOBOs
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of someone's headlamp
(and I'm still damp)
Echoes the sound of hiking poles.
------I should probably keep my day job.
-----Thoughts while waiting for the ramen to cook: if it feels like something is crawling on you, it is.

(this was creepily prescient in hindsight, as once I showered at the Pipers I found my first deer tick. It was DISGUSTING. I will spare you the photo I took of it through a magnifying glass)

The Pipers are amazing. I am so delighted to have met them, had dinner with them, had lovely conversations. It is all worth whatever pain comes my way tomorrow, when my feet get me back for breaking the ""low mileage"" rule.

More to come!
P.S. Seriously, I won't get Lyme disease (at least from today) It wasn't really attached, wasn't filled with blood. It was sooo tiny. I originally thought it was a scab. I wasn't sure until the magnifying glass. See, this is why I needed to hike for 20 miles to take a shower to tick-check!
P.P.S. Also saw a copperhead snake.","Campsite at 1105.9

AT-AT Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569329,"Happy Bloomsday! In honor of the day, I hiked a bit to the start of Telemachus.
I'm  exhausted. My bag was heavy with goodies from the Pipers and I made the rookie mistake of fully loading up on water and there were both steep climbs and stupid endless expanses of rocks. Finally I get the thing about Rocksylvania. The rocks aren't consistent or pervasive. And there's different kinds.
I passed a shelter earlier and met Landlady (named for a character from Kung Fu Hustle). There were tons of kids there - some kind of outdoor ed program for kids from troubled families. They offered me a s'more, and suddenly I had a ring of kids around me:
""How do you charge your phone?""""What are the ski poles for?""""What if you see berries and you don't know what they are?""
The last question was funny, because that just happened. I saw blackberry-looking things falling from trees and showed a photo to Mrs Piper to find out if they were edible. They're mulberries! So you know what I immediately picked the next day...
The guide book had the first ""very rocky"" warning for the stretch today. And for the first hour of it, I was like, okay, this isn't so bad. During the second hour, it became ""wait a minute..."" And by the third hour: SCREW THIS! TAKE DYNAMITE TO THE WHOLE MOUNTAIN! 
It was just a field of pain as far as I could see.
The problem is that there's nowhere big enough to put down your whole foot flat. So you're constantly wobbling on your heels or the balls of your feet or getting stabbed in the softest parts of your instep. Seriously!
My feet seem okay though....I soaked them in a piped spring for 15 min.
So I was miserable by the time I reached the shelter...when who should I see sitting there, but Red!
What are the chances I'd run into someone from last year?! I was so delighted to see a familiar face.

They have less flavor / more grit than blackberries
They have a mild flavor, like plums
It's impossible to get them off the tree without the teeny stem. It's impossible to get the teeny stem off without the berry exploding.

I'm tenting in a meadow full of lightning bugs. I'm here with Al from White Horse, the Yukon. He's carrying two beautiful Irish pipes, several kinds of tobacco, and a water bladder of Laphroig 10 year old cask strength Scotch (""It tastes like the sea - the peat, the smoke, like a beach fire,"" noted Al.) Clearly, his presence classes up the place, wherever he goes.
We sat on the rocks, watched the lightning bugs, and talked. An unexpected, lovely end to a long day. I walked through Duncannon, where they were having a little AT festival. I ate scrapple and pancakes at a diner, but couldn't finish them. Hiker hunger hadn't kicked in yet. Neither has frankenlegs, although I think they're close - I feel stiffness. 
I spent 15 minutes lying on a rock photographing a turtle, who seemed to be gazing off into the abyss.

AT-AT Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569400,"I'm writing this by the side of an amazing fire Nightcrawler made. We all dried clothes at this shelter with a sweet water source with a metal trough / basin that sounds like a Zen water fountain.
Today...what a day. First time caught in the rain, but on the way down, there were two families who converged at the road crossing to do the most epic trail magic! There was a woman grilling hot dogs with one hand and holding a TARDIS umbrella in the other. There was fruit and candy and Dunkin donuts and coffee....we all gathered under the awnings and talked and ate (in the photo, you'll see Al behind me, smoking his cigar and being dapper)
The families were so lovely to talk to. Thank you!!!
It was a long day with a long climb, so the trail magic really helped. At the end of those miles, I was going through the entire Weird Al Yankovic catalog in my head, just to distract myself.
Stuff I noted during the day:
- startled a wild turkey mama and baby
- noticed how, with the insane humidity, it was just like hiking in a sauna
- ""what's on your arm?"" someone at Trail Magic asked me. And I realized there's so much crap on my arms (mosquito bites, random bug bites, sunburn, bruises, scratches) that I had no idea which he was asking about
- I ate it on the rocks today. The cuts look like paper cuts....but from rocks

A raccoon got into Fake News' and Priestess' food bag last night. It wasn't hung high enough - as opposed to mine and Nightcrawler's, which were hung up ridiculously high.

7:35 pm
Sitting by the fire, enjoying being *dry*. Today got rough. It had been so damn humid and sticky. . . and then when I finally got to the top of the mountain / ridge, it got so darn windy. I could hear the trees shaking around me and started to think about them possibly falling down. It was super rocky (big surprise) and it started raining, and I lost track of the blazes, which can easily happen on rocky sections. I knew I'd gone off trail, so I turned my phone off airplane mode to check my position on Guthook (app for the Appalachian Trail).
And as soon as I turned the phone on, it blew up with tornado warnings. ""Take shelter immediately,"" it said. Um, I'm on the top of a ridge line, two miles from the nearest shelter?
And then the lightning began. So between the tornado warnings and the lightning and me being on a ridge, I was freaked. So I did what I always do when stuck on a ridge in a storm: run. 
I was running over wet rocks. I didn't even know if tornadoes touched down in mountains, but I wasn't going to wait to find out. 
I ran so fast I caught up to Al and Nightcrawler, just as they were reaching the shelter. Al was continuing on to the infamous 501 shelter where you can get pizza delivered. But Nightcrawler and I stayed, started a fire to dry out our shoes, entertained ourselves with MREs we found in the shelter (they taste a bit like apple pie crust???). I started a batch of Jello (in honor of Atlas, who taught me to make trail Jello last year - by ""refrigerating"" it in a stream!).
Later we were joined by Sweetheart from Germany, Monkey Man, and Primo, who brought a guitar wrapped in trash bags to protect it from the rain.
Primo is currently playing the guitar - it looks like he's snake-charming the fire with it. He's playing a Justin Vernon (of Bon Iver) song and singing. It's beautiful.
I'm developing a cough. I'm worried I'm getting sick. I've never been sick on trail before....being in the wet clothes for so long can't be good. 
Guess it's me and the guys in the shelter tonight.

AT-AT Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569745,"I'm sitting on a swing - a massive, 30-foot high swing on this crazy property I don't even know how to describe. Now I'm moving to a manmade swimming hole that's fed by a spring. There are adorable little stripey frogs with green mouths that keep jumping into the water as I walk by. I'm now standing in a little outlet that leads to a waterfall - a very unusual way to get my daily 15 min foot soak!
I got here kind of by accident. Handy at Boiling Springs had mentioned it, and something about it being wrong in the AT Guide, but I didn't catch what was wrong. It was listed in the guide as a Mennonite church that takes in hikers from the 501 Shelter road crossing. It's not. It's a guy, Breathe Easy, who actually lives 9 miles further up the trail (where he leaves trail magic every day!) and takes in hikers in his home, sort of like a hostel, and offers rides to Mennonite church services.
But because it was wrong in the book, he offered to get me anyway when I called.
I'm due to hit a town, Port Clinton, in two days. But then yesterday happened, my hiking clothes were soaked, and I spent the night in a shelter full of mouse poop (with fresh mouse poop by our heads in the morning), where a cockroach crawled out from under my camp shoes...and with a cold coming on....I decided it would be good to get inside and clean up and dry out a bit, even if it meant taking a nero.
Once we arrived, Breathe Easy made me a raspberry kefir milkshake and a wrap...showed me his garden and some of his projects. Later he taught me how to make zucchini bread!

I am so utterly delighted. I got to the shelter early, after a day with a full breakfast and trail magic for lunch, and when I scouted out a place near the shelter to tent, I found this super-secret picnic table tenting spot! Tenting areas never have their own picnic tables! And I got here early enough to enjoy it. And the tree coverage is a little thin, so there's sunshine! I hung my sleeping bag up to air it out a bit. 
8:15 pm
I may have just spent an ungodly amount of time starting my first fire of the trip, with wet wood. Really wet wood. As in just-rained-a-few-hours-ago wood. It took forever. I am proud of myself. The best part is when the wind picks up and stokes the embers and turns them into flames. It's doing the work for me! 
Red called the fire ""hiker TV.""
There's one kind of new branch on the ground, still green when you break it in half, that smells like birch beer. Must be birch! The weird thing is that it really burns...better than a lot of the other stuff that's more obviously dead. Maybe because it's not as water-logged?

Added bonus: I missed Tropical Storm Cindy. I found out online that the day I had the tornado warning, a tornado did in fact touch down on the south side of Blue Mountain. So having endured that storm, I'm grateful to have missed this one.
I'm both eager to return to trail and nervous about the climb ahead...
I haven't mentioned it yet, but the last few days, my pack has been coming apart. The pack itself, the cloth body, came off the metal frame. I jerryrigged it with line to get out of the woods, then fixed it when I got off. My friend hand-sewed the arms of it onto the frame for me, reinforcing them. So now when I see the green thread there, I'll think of her.
She also gave me a set of Lymeez - neon green leg sleeves treated with Permethrin to repel ticks. They look utterly ridiculous, as if I'm preparing to go to a rave, but if they work, I don't care what they look like. I'm so grossed out by the fact that I find a tick every time I shower.

I sat at the picnic table, trying to decide. I picked a bowl of blackberries. And then other hikers arrived! Everyone was so friendly and interesting.
Rock Eye: who got his name from a climbing accident just before he started the trail. A rock hit him in the *eye*! He showed me the tiny black stitches in his eye. I didn't know you could stitch eyes! He's also a dive instructor with one neat octopus sleeve tattoo. (He's a SOBO and has been keeping a tick tally: 38 so far. Shudder)

AT-AT Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570369,"11:05 am - I am having a rough morning. I just have no energy. . . I don't know why. It's not particularly hot, and although there have been climbs I've had worse this trip. I do hate the rocks and that may be a chunk of it. It's exhausting, you're constantly watching the ground, and I've done both the ankle-giving-out-and-rolling maneuver as well as the sharp-rock-to-the-tender-side-of-your-foot move. That last one hurts a LOT. 
Having left so close to others going the same direction, we keep leapfrogging each other and that makes me feel more pressure to push on. But I decided to stop and rest, see if I can catch a second wind.
Some part of me is all paranoid about Lyme disease, since I'm fatigued (but who wouldn't be?) and felt a little nauseous at bedtime last night. But it's probably because I took a nero and zero, am carrying too much food, and still adjusting to the workload.

PA is trying to kill me. This is a terrible day to do a 17 miler. . .Not just the rocks and lack of water sources but the exposed rock bouldering that is Knife Edge. I should have enjoyed the view, but I just wanted to get it OVER with because the height and me teetering on the edges of rocks with my overweighted bag was making me nauseous. 
I made it off and as soon as I could find a spot to pull over, I collapsed onto the ground and dumped everything in my food bag to get to a cup of applesauce at the bottom, which I drank down.

Pretty much within minutes of the last entry, I totally ate it on the rocks. I was actually past the worst of Knife Edge, just coming down a relatively normal rock section. But I was really tired . . . and I slipped down and forward somehow, sending the pack up and over, and then I knew I was going down. I landed hard on my knees and left hand (just as the last rock wounds to my hand were healing!) 
""[Insert expletives of your choice],"" I was yelling as I got up to make sure I was okay. Despite how hard I fell, there was little blood. I think I managed to scrape off every layer of skin but the last one. My knees didn't hurt as much as *looking* at them did, so I decided not to look, and somehow continued, through more freaking rocks, to get to the shelter.
Red was here when I arrived, which was nice. He filled me in on trail news - the couple with the huskies got off. The caretaker at Eckville gave away hikers' tents, they got them back.
I Neospoirined the knees, put on gauze, and pulled the Lymeez up over my knees to hold the gauze in place. I have them elevated now (as much as I can, they're resting on my pack). My low back also hurts, not sure how I did that.","Eckville Shelter

AT-AT Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570379,"And here is the story of how I ended up at a nudist colony....
The hikers were all talking about the steep climb ahead and most were staying over in town to rest up. Between my knees last night and my increasing symptoms (mild nausea, lack of appetite, lower abdominal pain / cramping, trekkers trots), I decided it was a good idea for me to stop in town too. 
The guidebook only listed two places to stay - a B&B 6 miles away and a nudist colony a couple miles outside town. I wasn't in any shape to walk that far off trail and needed transportation. 
I joined forces with Noon (hiking to raise funds for Christians in Syria), who had left a message with the B&B to see if he could get a pickup. I was going to go with him if the B&B called back. They didn't. So instead I called the nudist resort to get a room and ride and arranged for Noon to get a lift into town (which we later discovered had a bunkhouse behind a restaurant).
""You know this is a nudist resort?"" the shuttle driver tactfully asked as we drove out there. 
As we neared Sunny Rest (in the Poconos!), I realized how nice it was, and started wondering how much I could really do in terms of ""when in Rome."" (turns out, this was actually going to be my second ""clothing optional"" experience on the trail, but the first I actually knew about going into the situation. . .)
The grounds were actually clothing optional. Only the pools and spa had to be nude.
And I definitely wanted the pools and spa. 
Once we got inside the resort, the first thing I saw was a naked man riding a 4-wheeler. Must. Not. Laugh! But why on earth would you want to ride a 4-wheeler in the buff?
I got the key to my delightful little cabin, dropped off my pack, showered, and began screwing up the courage to hit the pool. I was almost as embarrassed by the scars and bug bites and bruises and hair as I was to actually be seen naked.
I chastely wore a towel up to the very edge. 
The water felt amazing. To swim after all of that hiking was a dream...
Next up: the spa. And in order to get to it, I had to walk through the night club.
Which is called Flashers.

I swam, I soaked, did laundry, watched Groundhog Day on my phone. I tried eating some dinner, worked on sipping water, did a lot of Google searches. Did I have Lyme? Giardia? I consulted with my brother the doc, who said dehydration and heat exhaustion were more likely the culprits.

AT-AT Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/570382,"Holy cow, what a difference!
I cannot get over what a change there was between yesterday and today! It's like I'm a whole different person. I'm not sure if it's recovering from the dehydration or the cooler weather or my hiking legs finally kicking in, but WOW. I not only had no trouble doing the crazy rock scramble out of Lehigh Gap, I actually enjoyed it! It was challenging and satisfying. And then there was a lovely open view, rockless walk.
I got to walk with Sunshine (travelling with Dreamliner) for a bit, until she needed to go slower, and then I met Sparks and hiked with him for a spell, until he needed to rest (shin splints). 
I felt GREAT! I was spontaneously singing on the trail, which I haven't done in a while.
Three songs in rotation:
""Centerfold"" by J Geils Band (it was playing at breakfast this morning before I left Sunny Rest, pretty much guaranteeing that it would be stuck in my head all day)
""Baby I'm Yours"" 
""Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For"" by U2
I just felt so GOOD. . . striding confidently over those rocks like they were nothing. The same rocks that slowed me down and hobbled me yesterday morning. It's crazy, the difference. My brother was right, I was suffering from dehydration. I sipped water last night, slept, had more water this morning, felt good enough to eat at breakfast (half of eggs Benedict -still couldn't finish the plate, no hiker hunger yet). 
And I was so lucky with the weather. It was almost cool, no bugs. I had sunblock on, sunglasses, clean clothes. . . I was prepared. 
I didn't even stop to rest my feet all day at all. None of the symptoms from the day before were there anymore!
Yesterday I couldn't get up the flights of stairs to the laundry without resting, today I was a MACHINE!
A reminder that a little self care can go a long way out here. All I needed was to cool off, rest, and drink water. 
I think I figured out what went wrong. The water source had been dry and I was conserving water. The hike was more than I expected and I had had no idea Knife Edge was going to be so vigorous or exposed. And then of course I fell. When I got to Bake Oven I was already weak and the water was low / hard to get, so I took the minimum amount and decided to skip cooking dinner and breakfast to save water, eating snacks instead. Which is fine, but I didn't drink the equal amount of water I would have consumed had I had a normal meal.
The weird thing is, I didn't feel thirsty. But I surely was.
So, good to know to keep on top of water and not so much with skipping cooked meals!
I had my full Mountain House tonight, no problem. I went and chatted with Sparks, who showed me his hammock setup, then chatted with Red and all the others at the shelter. I threw my food hang and got it right the first time.
It actually feels chilly tonight. . . may actually sleep with the sleeping bag zipped tonight!

I had my tent set up behind Kirkridge shelter when the ridge runner told me I *had* to check out the tenting spots .2 away. So I pulled up stakes and walked out. And he was right. A spot on par with Max Patch and Burke's Garden.
Night Crawler is here with his cunning cookstove (an apple design punched out in tin on the bottom, fed by the rays of the sun outlined above) and Sparks is in the pasture above, napping under his tarp. The expanse of land is stunning...and my gorgeous little photogenic tent looks straight out of an REI catalog. 
Can I talk about how awesome it is that my hiker legs finally kicked in? Or my rock feet?
It's like two days ago I was painfully picking my way between rocks and now I can ploughing right through them, not even changing my rhythm. It's almost Zen-like. Stop fighting the rocks.
I've been thinking while going over them how to explain these rocks. Walking on Legos is the best I've come up with. Some shift unexpectedly under you, others have sharp corners that stab you in the feet. But my sudden ability to cruise over them is amazing. I think some of it is confidence, moving quickly, not looking where you plant your feet. 
Bits and pieces:
Met a former thru-hiker who described his signature trail dish, ""the Ramocado."" Ramen stuffed in an avocado with cheese.

I'm watching the end of the sunrise and just feeling happy, lying on my stomach, angled down because of the slope. It's so beautiful. The mountains are so soft and rolling. There's sort of three bands of color - the green ""broccoli"" layer of trees immediately in the valley below, a sort of turquoise next, then the blue-grey in the distance. 
I'm shocked at how well I slept last night, given the cold wind and slope. I actually couldn't sleep on the Thermarest because of the angle of the hill. It was basically a slip 'n slide and nearly shot me out of the tent! Ha! So I slept directly on the ground because I had more traction, with the backpack on one side of me and the thermarest on the other for support. Worked great!
The sun rays are hitting the little farm buildings below, stretching their shadows far to the right. 
I'm super happy because today I'm reunited with Mr. AT-AT Walker! I'm a wee bit nervous about the logistics - being that I'm not entirely sure how I'm getting from here to Lake George, New York today. But I'm pretty confident I'll figure it out. There's a strong element of ""figure it out when you get there"" on the trail. This campsite is a great example. I had no idea it was here! 
I have about 6 miles to Delaware Water Gap (all rocks, no dang doubt), then I can eat in town, charge my phone (which died in the cold last night), then walk another mile out to the bus station and the next adventure! 
I will finally be done with Rocksylvania! Next: New Jersey! (""Everything's legal in New Jersey!"" - Hamilton. Except it's really not. Fires aren't permitted. You can only camp at designated spots.)

On a Greyhound to Lake George!
It was nice sharing coffee in the morning with Night Crawler before heading off to DWG. I sailed over the rocks, then there was lovely fire road walking and I saw my first bear of the summer!
When I got to town I ran into Sparks, bought a van of Permethrin, and consumed a half pound of fresh local strawberries. Ran into Little Engine, we had lunch and realized how much we have in common - same age, both teachers, both section hikers, both scuba divers. Red had long been telling me I had to meet her, so I'm glad I finally did.
I caught the bus to NYC, another to Albany, and then another to Lake George. 
I'm meeting Mr. AT-AT Walker and his family for a week at the YMCA Silver Bay, and I am SO EXCITED! (and a little bashful about how gross I am)
Interestingly, I did feel a bit queasy entering NYC - all the traffic and buildings after the woods was overwhelming.

From June 29 to July 8 I stayed with the Johnson family at the YMCA Silver Bay in Lake George, NY.
It was amazing. I don't even know where to begin to thank this family for the memories I will have for a lifetime.
I took a break from all things hiking (well, except for that hike in the rain we did!), even journaling. I lived fully in the moment.
Highlights: learning to do stained glass, learning to sail a Sunfish, driving to Canada to go cider tasting, watching fireworks reflected on the lake on the 4th of July, lots of quality time on a porch with lovely people.
And showers! Clean clothes! Lake swimming!

AT-AT Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572041,"Once again, the trail surprises me. I wasn't going to stop at the Mohican Outdoor Center since it was only 10ish miles from Delaware Water Gap...but there's a convenient place to meet my stepbrother and sister-in-law (Bret & Jackie) tomorrow just 3 miles out, so this seemed like good timing and spacing. Plus, my first day back after a zero week, it might be nice to get into camp early.
Turns out, I couldn't have been more right about that! I didn't realize there was a lovely pond here (albeit with the unappetizing name, Catfish Pond.  Between that and the nearby Rattlesnake Swamp trail, I'm thinking they may need some PR help.)
Of course, I'm spoiled after a week of swimming at Lake George, but after a sweaty, gross first day back, swimming in Catfish Pond felt AMAZING! I had it almost to myself - just enough people around to make it feel safe and less lonely.
Side note: my knock-off Crocs (""knocks""?) float! Kind of awesome for swimming / floating.
I collected an entire bowl of berries for tomorrow morning's oatmeal. Mmmm...
I'm in the $10 overflow tenting area. 
I talked to Bret briefly today to set up our rendezvous tomorrow. 
""New Jersey is WAY better than Pennsylvania!"" I said.
""I don't hear that too often,"" he replied. 
Right now I'm sitting perched on a rock I nicked from a fire ring and leaned against a tree. It would be perfect if it weren't for all the @?#%?!!! gnats. Probably can't fight them much longer.
- - -
I went inside the tent to escape the bugs and the sunlight is on it and everything is so warm and golden inside! The dappled sunlight, filtered through the trees and trickling across the tent fabric is unbearably lovely. It's turning the tent fabric into a scrim. 
(Funny how that word slipped into my mind - I learned it in high school, when they did a production of Oklahoma. Laurie's dream ballet scenes were behind a scrim. And Oklahoma songs were in my head today as I hiked. Again, what is it about hiking that brings back songs from childhood? Why did I sing verses of ""This Old Man"" until I got into the teens and started rhyming ""This old man played knick knack with Charlie Sheen""?)
My body feels so good right now. Clean. Refreshed. Nicely stretched from swimming. I should be calculating mileage but instead am reveling in the feel of lying on my back, my head propped up by a rolled-up sleeping bag, listening to mourning doves down by the lake.
And the trail magic I encountered today! The annual Feast in the Forest,  run by a group called Hike for Mental Health. It was HUGE! I got to chatting with one of the members whose son was an RA at UCLA!

It was so neat to see them. To talk, catch up as we walked single file through the woods to Crater Lake. They brought two cars so they could hike one way with me - 6 miles. And the lunch they brought! It was epic. Pepperoni and cheese sandwiches, mangoes, strawberries, donuts! I decided it was the perfect time to bust out the airline bottle of ice cider I bought in Canada. We chilled it in the cooler and had cider and donuts. Decadent. I feel very loved. Thank you guys for coming out!
After saying goodbye (well, actually after watching Bret pet a snake in the parking lot!) I continued to the shelter. There are so many people here, it's nuts. The shelter is full of city kids on an outward bound kind of trip, facilitated by this kid from Tipperary with an amazing accent. (I loved how strong he hit his Rs while telling the kids to put stuff in the bear bag). Then there's over a dozen hiker tents and hammocks around the shelter, plus more down the way. I've never seen this many people on the AT before. This is the difference between starting behind the bubble and starting in the bubble (or one of them).
Met some other women thru-hikers - Blueberry and Ladybug.
Oh, and I finally saw a porcupine today! In a tree! Did you ever imagine porcupines in trees? It didn't look anything like the cartoon porcupines. There was something more monkey about it, how black it was, the way its hands held on, how it looked at you. It's hard to explain. I'll put the photo in some day when I don't have anything to show.

I read about a hostel and hotel at the road crossing that did shuttles, so I started planning on that. It didn't seem right to go indoors after only 3 nights out though. Anyway, I was feeling discouraged. The insane humidity was causing tons of chafing and heat rash on my hips and thighs. 
And then we came down the mountain...and hit amazing trail magic! The family of a thru-hiker named Ironman (signs logs with Fe and a stick figure) had set it up to surprise him. They were offering a legit New Jersey specialty: taylor ham sandwiches. And blueberry pancakes with white chocolate chips! And orange juice (which I've been craving). And a hiker box with bandaging tape, which I needed.
It lifted my spirits so much. 
I sat next to Princess Pee (who received her name after a snafu with the same funnel I once tried, and discarded for the same reason...) She was headed to the next shelter and I decided then and there to power through too, fueled with gorgeous pancakes.
Princess Pee had actually been on my heels for a while coming up a rocky incline. It felt a bit like the Cliffs of Insanity with me as Fezzick, carrying the weight of 3 people, and her as the Man in Black.

The plan had been to do a second long day (ha!), 18.9 miles, to NJ 94, where I could call a shuttle to a motel or church that takes in hikers. I'm dying for a laundry stop and was looking forward to it all day. 
It was a really interesting, diverse hiking day. For a while there, it felt like American Ninja Warrior. Run across these two parallel wooden planks! Now scramble up all these rocks! Now navigate the boggy swamp!
The boardwalks were the best. When you walk on the two parallel boards, they make these lovely tones...almost like a wooden xylophone. Some are springy when you walk on them. Thwok! Thwok!
And there are also the far more fancy boardwalks - wide elevated platforms 4 feet off the ground where you can gaze at eye level to tall cattails.
Just gorgeous walking today, a lot of it flat. Unfortunately, that was the first part. ..
It was so obscenely humid all day. It made me feel validated when I heard local dayhikers complaining about it too. It's not just me! It's hellish for everyone!
Towards what I thought was the end of my day, my energy was flagging. I was low on water. My phone was nearly dead. I was saving the battery for calling the motel and reserving my spot.
Finally I made it to 94. And the motel? Full. The church? A error in the book. Hostel? Closed.
There was a store called Heaven Hill Farm down the road. I went there to get drinks and figure out what to do.
I purchased and quickly consumed:
- a quarter wedge of watermelon- a Chobani yogurt- 2 bottles of orange juice- a cider donut - a large package of beef jerky
They let me charge my phone and fill up my water bladder as I tried to suss out what to do. The next shelter was 5 miles away. I'd already walked 19. And of those 5. . . was a big 'ol incline up Wawayanda Mountain, plus several smaller climbs after.
I felt way better after the food. I figured if I had to do 5 MORE miles on top of 19, in the godawful humidity, over MORE rocks, uphill, racing against sunset and predicted rain. . .then I was going into Beast Mode. 
(Which means pulling up my skirt for easier climbing, taking off my shirt, and going full-on with everything I got!)
I found a trail magic cooler with sodas, grabbed an Arnold Palmer and sucked it down as I went. When it started getting dark and rainy, I counted lightning bug flashes to distract myself (92!). I kept moving, no matter what. 
I finally hit the shelter at 9:00 pm. Putting up a wet tent in the rain, in the dark, isn't one of my favorite activities.
I'm now a day ahead of schedule, which is what I needed in order to make my friend's wedding in a week. I just thought I'd make up that time over two weeks. . . not two days.

Hearing the hard-core 20-milers around me discussing how insanely hard that 14.3 miles was is comforting. It wasn't just me. (I say that a lot?)
It's so hard to tell from the altitude maps how hard a day is going to be. It doesn't tell you if the inclines are smooth mountainside or stupid hard rock bouldering.
Hint: today was the latter.
I feel like my body is getting more beat up this year than previous years. Is it the rocks? Or does it just seem that way because I remember the good parts more than the bad?
The skin on my thighs looks like I have chicken pox. Heat rash? Pimples?
Last night was so hot and muggy I could barely sleep. I tied my long-sleeved shirt around my Thermarest as a ""sheet"" because my skin kept sticking to it.
In the middle of the night, there was a loud crash and a yell. I was on the verge of getting out to investigate when someone called out, ""he's alright!"" In the morning I learned a tree had fallen down within feet of this guy's tent. 
We encountered an adorable school group today. The adult with them asked for our trail names. When I said mine, he looked confused.
""A T . . . AT. . . walker?"" he repeated.
""STAR WARS!!!"" a group of boys screamed. 
Then I did my AT-AT walk with the poles, and the kids lost it. They wanted high fives, kept telling me how cool my name was. I'm apparently a hit with the elementary school set. :-)
It had been super humid all day and we were all going through water fast with few water sources available (and what was there was tea-colored). I was so thankful to trail angels The Hikeman and Susan, who left gallon jugs of water for us at road crossings.
The heat just takes it out of me . . . And climbing over rocks . . .and relentless mosquitoes. On the up side, tons of blueberries! When I was low on water and energy, I thought a lot about how much water you need to digest blueberries vs the water you get from them. I must ask Sean. I ate a LOT of blueberries today. I'd just lean over, without hardly slowing down, and pull them off two at a time. (I later learned rain-rinsed cool blueberries are a treat!)
I leapfrogged a lot with the folks at the shelter last night and joined them for trail magic (a lot of magic this year!). It was me, two other women, and about 15 shirtless guys. The trail magic was led by Blaze / Mick's family, and was to bring awareness for Alzheimer's disease (Steps For Dad).
I left trail magic early, pretty sure it was going to rain. It had been so humid all day. And sure enough, it poured. Thunder started right before I got to a rock formation called the lemon squeezer (again with the names . . .), so I took shelter under the rocks to check for lightning and make a plan.
After 10 minutes or so, two hikers came up - Good Times and Snowbird. They were going to power through, and I thought, safety in numbers, and joined them. Good Times kept looking back to check on me as we climbed, which I thought was nice. Hikers out here take care of each other.

I could keep up with the guys on the straightaways and downhills, but not ascents. I have endurance and strength, but cardio kills me. 
It rained most of the day and the trail was one continuous river, but I didn't mind too much / was resigned to it. The temp was low enough that I could wear my rain gear and finally, no bugs.
I imagine there were great views I passed all day. . .if I weren't hiking in a continuous raincloud. Apparently you can see the NYC skyline from the peaks I climbed today. I saw a white-out that reminded me of Clingman's Dome.
I sang songs for a chunk of the morning to keep spirits up. ""Helpless"" from Hamilton figured prominently in the set list.
My feet felt good despite being soaked. My wet hands were raw from holding the poles while being pruned for so long. And I was tiring from the climbs.
And then I slipped and fell onto my left shin on the rocks. (Always the left! The sinister side?) Hurt like the dickens but the cut wasn't deep.
The trail got really nice at the end - all level and wide and gravel, and I sailed over it like a barn sour horse, thrilled by how close I was to a motel for the night.
And then the trail hit the lake, which was eerie and empty in the rain, and then... went through a ZOO. The Appalachian Trail goes through a zoo. Because of course it does. 
(The only other people there were hikers, but I wonder on a nice day, do the muggles stare at the hikers in the zoo instead of the animals?)
I enjoyed the statue of Walt Whitman, the WPA-era natural history exhibits. It was weirdly fun. It was also the closest I've been to bears this trip. Seeing them in the enclosure, I said to the other hikers, ""This is both cool and sad.""
And then I was done and ready for logistics!
Two weeks ago, Uber became legit in New York, and thank god because I had a complication - the place where I sent my resupply was full. So no place to stay, no shuttle. But because a hiker told me about Uber, I was able to Uber to get my box, and then to find another motel. You should see how quickly I wrecked a fairly nice room with my wet tent hanging in the bathroom,  wet gear exploded everywhere, wet shoes drying on the heater. . .I promise, I cleaned up before checking out!
I think I showered for close to an hour. 
I wore a towel and a rain jacket to do my laundry, where I met other people wearing only towels and crocs in the motel - sure sign of thru-hikers. I got to chatting with one, Thunderbuns, as we waited for our loads to finish.

There were a bunch of families day-hiking up to Anthony's Nose. Ahead, I saw a familiar face from the night before.
""HEY THUNDERBUNS!!!"" I called out past all the families.
I'm pretty sure that will never grow old.
(Btw, he earned the moniker one night during a huge storm when he ran out of the tent in just his underwear to help his sister, whose tent was flooding.)
Like so many other thru-hikers out here, TB's faster than me but takes longer breaks, so it evens out. 
We hiked together for the day, swapped trail stories, then attempted to head to a state park for the night. But it was a busy road with no shoulder, so we thought we'd walk the trail around.

I slept *great*! Lembas was the only other hiker at Tony's last night besides me and TB. He congratulated me on the marathon yesterday and was surprised to hear I've only been on trail 3ish weeks. 
(There's some bizarre John Wayne movie on with a woman and a cheetah???)

So here's how yesterday happened. Thunderbuns and I did 6ish miles to the RPH Shelter which was in the throes of a 3-day-long hiker feed. EPIC! We had a great time talking to the volunteers, admiring the stellar shelter, and eating. (Or in my case, indulging in this year's food craving: orange juice. I drank 2 liters of OJ this morning before we left Tony's. Two liters! What is going on? Must be scurvy.)
At the shelter, Thunderbuns ran into two gals he'd hiked with before. One, Pigpen, was slacking some packs 20 miles ahead to Tony's Deli, and offered to take ours.
***Time Out For a Hiker Glossary!***
Slackpacking - When a hiker only carries water or a daypack and someone else shuttles their tent, etc to them at the end of the day. It's both kind of frowned upon by purists AND a way to mix things up once in a while / do big miles / go over tough sections.
Deli-blazing - Planning your hike around hitting as many nearby delis as possible. This is mostly a New York thing and Thunderbuns excels at it. His goal is to make it to Massachusetts without having to resupply his food.
***So we had this opportunity, and the only catch was we'd have to go 20 more miles on top of the 6 we'd already done. But I'd never slackpacked before and this summer is my last long section of the trail, so why not?
We didn't have daypacks, so we dumped our stuff out of our packs into a giant trash bag and labelled it. It was kind of scary, taking everything I need to survive and giving it to someone I don't know to leave at a deli I've never seen. :-)
But Pigpen is so awesome. Thank you!!!
My pack felt silly-light! And off we went.
I'd always been curious to know if my pack weight was slowing me on hills, or if it was just my lungs. Now I know for sure, it's not pack weight. I didn't go much faster w/o weight, but I was much more comfortable in terms of heat and rubbing. And it was fun to try something new.
At the end of the long day, we passed the Appalachian Trail commuter train stop (!) and turned to the deli. The brief stop to look at menus was all we needed to go into full Frankenlegs mode, more than I've seen this summer. It was awfully funny, the two of us hobbling around gleefully awaiting burgers with mozzarella sticks and ribs and god knows what else in them. I'm so grateful to Pigpen and TB for this truly quintessential AT day!

Tony's was so delightful, we got a late start this morning, and the climb out took a while. Today we crossed the border into Connecticut!
TB and I had long conversations about fantasy and sci fi (Good Omens! American Gods!), music (The Beards, his Disney playlist), what we're doing with our lives. 
When we got in it was dark, with no time for making dinner or getting water, just immediately hanging food while we could still sorta see and setting up our tents to get away from the mosquitoes as fast as humanly possible.

A few minutes ago, I slipped and fell on a rock. Again. Left shin, left wrist.

The nice thing about your meal needing 20 minutes to cook is that it forces you to rest and gives a great excuse for journaling. I haven't been doing sit-down lunches, but there's climbing ahead and I can tell I'm out of gas.
In the middle of the night I got up because my legs were itching so bad. There's one welt behind my knee that's nearly the size of my fist. I made the mistake of indulging in a good long scratch - which of course feels ecstatic in the moment but then makes everything worse. 
I was so itchy I couldn't sleep, so I opened the tent, took a Benadryl, and got off the Thermarest so my legs could be on the cool ground. 
6:20 pm
A short day. It was stupid-hot and humid all day and I was having a terrible time with the inclines in the heat. And the bugs were *relentless*. 
Then there was the ridiculous rock descent that I thought would kill me, especially since I'd already fallen earlier in the day. 
When I got down to the flat walk along the Housatonic River, I could see how beautiful it was but it was hard to enjoy it with the constant threat of gnats going into my eyes, nose, and ears, even as I windmilled my pole.
It's so gross pulling gnats out of your eyelashes.
The young guy (Spoons) in front of me had clearly had it with the bugs. He'd already set up his tent and got inside when I reached the shelter, even though we'd only done 10 miles. ""I was about to lose it,"" he said to me through the netting.
So I decided to call it quits too, to have an early night and finish reading Sister Carrie.

We got to hike and talk until there were too many uphills and I fell behind. 
The winged jerks were out again in full force. Monsters! I wore the head net just to get a break from them, until it was too hot to wear.
I ran out of water late in the day - I HATE that. I may have to do what everyone else does - carry little drink bottles and fill them with Crystal Light.
Met Kickstand (hiking on a prosthetic), Flash Daddy (whose daughter Ladybug I tented next to ages ago), and Trail Magic (photographer whose name is torture. When someone calls out, ""It's Trail Magic!"" you're expecting. . . trail magic).
We all ended up at the bar at the Inn in Falls Village, and it was awesome. I don't normally drink, but had two summer shanties and told Thunderbuns I am considering taking up drinking shandies. He was skeptical about drinking being something one can ""take up."" Pschaw.
We split lobster mac n cheese and steak and frites and polished it all off. We chatted with Sue the bartender, the other hikers and patrons, and set up to tent behind the Toymaker's Cafe, which sounds like something for Santa's elves but is actually some kind of British motorcycle repair place.

Last night I got so excited thinking about a shower, I almost couldn't sleep. When I got here there were so many hikers ahead of me that there was no warm water left, but I was so hot I didn't mind.

The pressure of the miles math is strong with the thru-hikers. They're all calculating how many miles they need to do each day to reach Katahdin before it closes.

I had heard a lot about how hard it would be to climb Bear Mountain and Mount Everett (not Everest!), and I was worried about doing it in the rain. My whole goal for today was: don't fall and die.
But it really wasn't that bad, certainly not like people were saying. I had one super graceful slow-mo slide, but no falls. And it was so much easier to climb without the heat, bugs, and humidity.
Of course, I didn't think about what the cool temps would mean for tenting. It's cold! 54 degrees and falling, according to the iPhone (which is acting really wonky in this cold).

The plan for today was to go to the shelter at 19 miles, but the bottoms of my feet were sore from walking all day in wet socks and shoes. It was a combination of dew, mist on the grass, and light rain on and off all day. I was also going a lot slower than normal because I was *committed* to not falling on wet, slippery rock. . . and there were a lot of wet, slippery rocks today! So far, so good!
There was a lot of flat walking (boardwalks, pastures) but the wetness was chewing up my feet. So I stopped early, set up my wet tent, then went looking for water. On the way, I stumbled across two hidden tent pads, one with a gorgeous view!
So of course, I pulled up stakes and moved my tent.
My tent isn't freestanding, so setting it up on a wooden platform is tricky. I did an odd combination of anchoring with rocks, staking a few off the back end of the platform, hooking long guylines around the ends of boards.

I was down at the dock on the pond with the two sisters. It was sweet, chatting with them as the sun went down.
There are a lot of hikers here, but nothing like last night, when they had 30. The SOBO bubble and the NOBO bubble are colliding. SOBOs started at Katahdin on June 1 - its weird to think their amount of time on trail is nearly the same as mine this trip! 
I had a long day today - I found out the caretaker at this cabin makes pancakes and coffee (!) for hikers, so I made sure to get here. I needed some extra gas for the extra miles, which came in the form of a roadside ""trail stand"" (cereal! pop tarts! oreos!) and listening to music via the earphones I picked up at the airport on my way to the wedding.

This morning at the pancake breakfast at Upper Goose Pond Cabin:
""You know the mushrooms that look like pancakes? (enthusiastic nodding of recognition) This is the first time I've looked at a pancake. . .and it reminded me of the mushroom.""
Today was so ridiculously flat that I zoned out and walked mindlessly in the rain for hours.
A while back, someone signed a log book with the quote, ""Who needs to think when your feet just go?""  It took me a moment of singing to recall the source: 1980s, the Tom Tom Club.
Anyway, that lyric fit today.
Other thoughts: People leave downed trees and branches to block off wrong turns / what looks like the trail, but isn't. But trees and branches also just fall on their own, and you frequently have to go over and around them. Sometimes it is difficult to tell if a tree is intentionally blocking your way or not!

I woke up next to the windows with the incredible view, which were fogged over with condensation. I wiped the windows by my head with the corner of my blanket and watched the trees appear, the town in the distance that I saw glowing last night, the rows of mountains. I could sit and watch all day. No wonder I couldn't go back to sleep, it was like Christmas morning.
Outside, there's a single white folding chair on a lawn at the edge of wildness. It reminds me of Wallace Stevens' jar in Tennessee. A bit of something man-made that organizes everything around it by contrast.
There are also windmills out there. A reminder of Livermore, which my parents are leaving soon.
Folks are trying to decide whether they are leaving early or waiting for breakfast. I am in the camp of waiting for breakfast at 8:00 and then hitting the tower next door at 9:00. I hear the temps are going into the 40s, which worries me. I better layer up with everything I have.
9:20 PM
Right now I'm hunkered down in my sleeping bag, wearing basically everything I have. Two pairs of socks. Pants. Hiking skirt. Sports bra. Hiking top. Long sleeved shirt. Fleece vest. Windbreaker. I'm just worried because I can feel how cold it is outside and it's supposed to dip below 50 and I want to be prepared.
I had breakfast (Pancakes! Muffin! Bacon! Buckets of coffee!) with P Tang, Happy Hour, Easy Goin, and the travel writing couple. Everyone was doing the 20 to this shelter, in order to have a short day into town tomorrow. That part sounded like a good idea and there weren't really other options. The shelter at 13 miles is known for noise from ATV traffic. So I decided to push for this shelter even though:
- I got a late start- I spent too much time at trail magic for lunch- I'm on a streak of big days and probably need rest
I used music to give myself the extra push, and gummy worms, but the last three hours were hard on me. I've made my peace with the mud, it's not really that, but all the uneven ground, the rocks, the tree roots. . . my feet were hurting. Actually, the muscles that hurt the most, I don't even know what they are. I must ask Sean. It's like the back of the legs, below the calf but above the Achilles. What is that? What does it do? Why do mine hurt so bad? (Update: Dr. Sean reports its the soleus).
It will be quick into Bennington tomorrow. I may also see about getting a new phone, since the touch screen on this one is now possessed.

I'm glad that someone on Guthook gave me the tip to call ahead to arrange the shuttle, since there was no reception at the trailhead.
I got to the motel, checked in, and picked up my resupply box, along with a wonderful food drop of Trader Joe's goodies from Bob and Janette. Thank you!
The owner of the motel says that 75% of his business comes from hikers. I was excited to see that he had a hiker box with hiker clothes in it. He said he got it after he noticed hikers having to wear towels while doing their laundry. So this explains me wearing men's board shorts and an Atlantic City t-shirt!
I went to Friendly's for breakfast while they cleaned my room. They let me check in early, isn't that awesome?
The pain in my leg inspired me to check to see if massage was a possibility. . . turns out, there is a therapist just a few blocks behind the motel who does sports massage! She was perfect! She even showed me particular stretches for the muscles I'm having trouble with.
I also found an AT&T store that could get me a new iPhone since my old one which I've had for three summers on the trail is now possessed. I got a taxi there, got everything backed up and transferred, then saw a grocery store next door and grabbed things for dinner and tomorrow's breakfast.

AT-AT Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574347,"Today was such a great day! Although the walk at the end was brutal. 
All four of us - the San Diego couple, Easy Goin', and me - got up early and were on the trail by 6:30! A good way to hike more miles in the cool morning hours, and to make more miles overall, although that wasn't part of my plan. For a bit of the morning, I was stuck with some chatty old guy right behind me, and when I pulled over to let him pass, he declined, saying, ""We're the same pace!"" ARGH.
The mud is thick, but it's not terrible. It feels almost soothing to step into because the impact is softened. The roots though...After many, many hours of my ankles having to stabilize my feet on the roots, no wonder they're tired!
We went around the first of several ponds of the day. And then the climb up Stratton Mountain began. I decided to put on more episodes of Israel Story to distract myself from thinking about the long climb. I got a little choked up a few times, but I don't know if it's because the show is that good or if my emotions are just more accessible because of the hiking. Anyway it wasn't too hot, so up I climbed, slowly, eating my snacks, wondering if this is useful prep for the Whites.  The peak was at 4,000 feet but we started at 2,000, so only 2,000 foot elevation gain.
When I got to the top I rested a bit and talked to the caretakers up there. The man gave me a tip after hearing about my fear of heights and apprehension about climbing up to the fire tower for the view. He said to treat it like a ladder and to go back down that way instead of like stairs.
Yesterday I passed a different fire tower, making it up only one flight before chickening out. But that one had see-through stairs and this one at least had solid wood planks. I could still see between them and down, which was terrifying, but at least on the landings I wouldn't be able to see through to the ground. So I left my pack at the bottom and white-knuckled all the way up, chanting, ""F***-oh-F***-oh-F***"" the entire time. I went slowly, and I did the turns on the platforms holding onto the railings for dear life, but I did it!
And the views... The views were *stunning*. 
I was still scared up there. . . at one point the tower started shaking, and I thought it was the guys below being jerks. But no, that's just what happens when a new person begins the climb.
(Side note: I just remembered there was a bit of trail magic today too. A dad had just returned his 41-year-old daughter, Pet Gnat [her favorite wine], to trail and was in the parking lot giving out sodas. I had a Diet Pepsi the only kind available the sort of thing I'd never drink in the real world but it was awfully tasty today.)
At the top of the tower, I was fretting about how I'd get back down. I wasn't able to relax until my feet hit the ground again. But it felt great that I did it! I chickened out yesterday but did it today! Easy Goin' gave me a celebratory fist bump.
Then it was back down the mountain and on to the Stratton Pond shelter. I considered staying there, but tenting wasn't allowed and the shelter looked awful. So onwards!
Stratton Pond itself was lovely! After that long hard climb, we all had the same mindset: swimming! Hikers just dropped their packs, stripped, and went right in. Me too.There were little salamanders in the water! The cool water felt so good after all the sweating and bugs. Everyone was just happy.
Looking around, just taking it all in, one guy asked, ""Why do people live in cities?""
Another exclaimed, ""My joints don't hurt! I think I'm going to take up swimming when I'm done with the AT!""
When I was finished swimming, I didn't wait to dry off, but instead put on my clothes and pack.
""That's the fastest in-and-out!"" one guy said.
""Where I come from, In N Out is a burger place,"" I replied.
Which then set off a few of the hikers, groaning about how much they wanted animal style fries. 
Walking from the pond, I started to really feel tired. There are multiple kinds of tired. This was both I-need-food tired and my-feet-hurt-from-walking-all-day tired.
I had never actually calculated the miles. I didn't realize I'd done another 20 until just now. D'oh!
I'd been on my feet and walking for 12 hours. No wonder I was tired.
So I decided to just stop at the first shelter I came to, which was this one. A whopping .5 off trail. (Adding a mile round trip. We'll walk 20 miles a day, but hikers almost never go to shelters .5 or more off trail.)
But I got in early enough to chat with the few people here, have a hearty dinner, read the whole logbook, and write this long entry. Good stuff! Now I need to plan tomorrow!","Kid Gore Shelter

We've got four walls and a roof.

Duct Tape met me with a can of Long Trail beer when I arrived, which was delightful, and now he's playing ""Sleep Walk"" (1959?) on a speaker, and it's perfect.  Surf guitar inside, rolling thunder outside. When I first climbed up this stretch of the AT - which happens to go up a ski run - it was still sunny. Neither chairlift was running and wandering around the closed ski area was like some strange post-apocalyptic experience. I sat on a ski lift chair and sipped the beer.
I had read about this place in the book, an old warming hut that the ski patrol on Bromley uses during the winter and keeps unlocked for hikers in summer. I didn't really know what it was, but I was intrigued. And I decided doing a short day to stay somewhere with a view would be worth it. And I knew the storm was coming in, although it's hard to know if it's staying or what.

I heard through the hiker grapevine that Thunderbuns skipped up to the Whites. That's why I haven't seen him in journals. Atlas and Straw did the same thing last year - it's common for thru-hikers who are pressed for time (or mired in mud) to skip Vermont.
I considered skipping Vermont and pushing through and trying to summit Katahdin this year. But now that I've seen how pretty VT is, I'm glad I didn't skip it. 
Once I realized I probably didn't have enough time to reach Katahdin this summer, it took the pressure off. Now I can concentrate on enjoying the Whites and look forward to coming back to do the hundred mile wilderness and Katahdin with Mr. AT-AT Walker.
Anyway, back to now. At this point on the trail, several bubbles are converging. You have the AT northbounders who started in Georgia in March, the AT southbounders who started on Katahdin in June, and now SOBOs and NOBOs on the Long Trail (which, despite its name, is considerably shorter than the AT). The Long Trail is 273 miles, and for this stretch of Vermont, both trails run together. So I'm meeting all kinds of hikers.
There are currently nine of us in the shelter, drying out from the rain. We're talking about black flies – Duct Tape and I think that's what was biting us last night. They're the size of gnats, but draw blood – I had one on my face this morning and when I smacked it, it left a vaguely-lightning-bolt-shaped pool of blood on my forehead.
I am The Hiker Who Lived.
Will the Long Trail hiker is reading The Fountainhead. Ireland (Co. Donegal!) is swinging in the hammock he set up in the shelter. Jeremiah is in his bunk, cooking Ramen. Duct Tape is playing Eddie Vedder ukulele songs for us all. Stumbleina is cooking her dinner. Easy Goin' just came in, along with the SOBO named Barbecue.
Now we're discussing the Doyle (an infamously decrepit hiker hotel in Duncannon, PA), norovirus, jalapeño popper chips, the difference between peanut butter M&Ms and Reese's Pieces (Easy Goin' gave me some. The M&Ms are bigger than Reese's Pieces). Now we're trying to remember what day it is.
I'm glad I'm a light sleeper for nights/mornings like last night in the ski hut. Can I just share how that was one of the best nights I've had this trip?! Seeing the storms, the rainbow, the sky....
Even though I had earplugs in, I heard Duct Tape when he got up in the night, and it reminded me to go out and check the stars. So I put on a vest and jacket and out I went. WOW! I felt so insignificant seeing the vastness of space above. The big dipper was low on the horizon. I could see the Milky Way above. It was breathtaking. By far the best night sky I've seen on the trail. And when I got cold and went back inside, I could still see stars out the window from my sleeping bag. Wow!
Then in the morning, around 5:15, I heard some people outside getting up to watch the sunrise. So I scurried out too, and took a spot on the second chair lift. It was so restful to watch the islands of land above the low fog clouds and the sky pinken.
When I finished, I headed back in, where Duct Tape was still sleeping.  (It ended up being just the two of us in the hut - everyone else hiked on or tented outside.) I wanted to start my day, but it's hard to pack up anything quietly – everything is wrapped in Ziploc and trash bags. We were joking about the quintessential sound of every morning on the trail – the PFFFFFFFFF! of Thermarests deflating.
Once he awoke, I made breakfast, shared my coffee, then hit the trail.
There was a fun rock scramble today on an unusual white rock that had pinks and sparkles in it. 
There was a perfect stream to soak my feet in and then, not long later, I began to hear thunder. Uh-oh. I busted out my pack cover, jacket, and rain skirt and kept heading to the shelter. It's been on and off raining ever since, hence, all of us in here.
Atlas had made a joke about all the best AT stories beginning with ""so we were all stuck in a shelter during the rain..."" It's so true. With no phone service or other entertainment, we have only ourselves.
It's still on and off raining, and more people are arriving. One woman is going to sleep on top of the picnic table, because it's the only space left. Normally I'd tent, but I just can't set up the tent in the rain when I've finally dried off. I'm also wondering how morning will work, with this many folks. Will is going to share the bunk with me.

AT-AT Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574387,"I'm fed and in early. I sure wish I had a book to read! I'm suddenly really hungry for reading.
I slept okay last night although I was afraid of a) bumping into the guy next to me and b) rolling over and falling off the platform. And the freaking bugs. . . I heard a mosquito right by my face and tried to get as much inside the bag as possible and the bastard still got me. I have a welt on my neck, an itchy one on my cheek, and two more under my jaw. First time I've had bites on my face this trip. It sucks!
I had a late start this morning, pretty leisurely, chatting with Duct Tape, who was playing the surf guitar song again. Then I walked along the pond, enjoying the views. There was this incredible Christmas tree forest. God it smelled amazing! The soft needles on the ground, the red soil path, the tiny little Christmas trees. To just breathe it all in, especially when you're accustomed to everything smelling bad!
But the best thing was so unexpected. I came to Clarendon Gorge, where there is a huge suspension bridge over a rushing river with swimming holes. The sun was out, shining down on the clear, clear water. There were families down there with kids floating on inner tubes.
It looks soooooo inviting! But I was trying to press on, do more miles, and I couldn't get half naked and crash this family's party. So I started walking across the bridge. And as I walked, I kept thinking, ""I *have* to go down there.""  And then I saw Easy Goin' below, and that did it. I turned right around, got off the bridge, and work my way down to the water! Dropped my pack, undressed, and went right in.
After all the muggy and buggy climbing today, it felt amazing! My skin had been covered in mud (did another graceful downslide today), squashed mosquitoes, sweat. . . it felt so refreshing! Think about it – I haven't had a shower in five days! I haven't felt this clean in ages. And the water current was strong. I had to hold the side of a rock and the current buoyed me upwards.
I felt so happy and free. I am so glad I stopped. I was practically bouncing and singing afterwards. Even the memory of it now makes me feel refreshed.And shortly afterward, the weather turned on a dime again. Mountain weather is so unpredictable!
Last night I was talking with Duct Tape, who works at REI and sometimes gives talks on hiking the AT. He says the most common question he gets is, ""How do you stay dry?"" We laughed because the answer is: you don't.
Sure, people use pack covers and frog togs and trash bags and rain jackets and even umbrellas, but sooner or later everybody walks wet.
There a lot of people at the shelter, plus a group of young boys with two leaders. But it is a big place, very chill. Folks are friendly.
Here I met two SOBO brothers with long blonde hair,  Finn and Thor. (They reminded me so much of a 90s band, and god help me, I spent hours trying to recall the name of the band, which I know I have written in colored ink on a mix tape in my car. I finally Googled it when I got to town, and can now die in peace. NELSON! Seriously, Google the video for ""Love and Affection."" The early 90s were something.)
Anyway, the younger brother was giving me advice for the Whites, since he'd just finished them, and it was the first time someone said something calming to me about the Whites. I just respected and appreciated his attitude / approach so much.
He said, ""The most important thing is to take your time and enjoy it. You're a section hiker, so it's the best place to be! Just think to yourself, okay, today my only task is to summit this mountain. Don't worry about the miles or if there's a bad weather day or if you miss one view - you will see plenty more.""
I don't have enough time to do the whole trail at once, which opens up the opportunity for doing parts of the trail over multiple trips for as long as I want / need.
It's a funny contradiction, being a section hiker. Because you don't have enough time, you can take as much time as you want.","Little Rock Pond Shelter

AT-AT Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574670,"Today I was listening to Hamilton while climbing Killington. You know that choked-up feeling that can happen with crying? Totally happened during ""Stay Alive"" and ""It's Quiet Uptown."" 
I could feel my throat closing, making it more difficult to breathe, and I thought, ""Oh my God, I'm gonna pass out, not because of an asthma attack or a heart attack, but a freaking Hamilton attack.""
No more hiking and crying to Hamilton! It's dangerous!
But seriously, I HAVE to listen to it for the Whites in particular, since at least 4 characters have place names associated with them! I have to sing Lafayette's lines while summiting Lafayette. :-)
I'm not an emotionally closed off person to begin with and long-distance hiking just brings all your emotions to the forefront. Hence the fact that Hamilton keeps making me cry even though I've seen the musical, I've listened to the soundtrack a million times, I know what's going to happen!
With the exception of the two songs that will have you bawling like a weirdo on the mountaintop, Hamilton is an excellent soundtrack for hiking. It's really fast, it has a catchy beat, it takes a while to memorize all the lyrics, and the next time you fall on a bunch of rocks, you can just sing, ""Hercules Mulligan! I need no introduction! When you knock me down I get the **** back up again!""
Whike hiking up the summit, I ran into the two Germans, Ice Cream and Memories. Seeing them reminded me to take off my ear buds and listen. It was so quiet! It was amazing, you couldn't hear any birds. You couldn't hear any people. You couldn't hear any cars, you couldn't hear any water moving, no bugs, it was just very, very faint wind in the distance, and that's it. I actually made an audio recording of it, which seems funny, as the lack of sound was the main thing!
So here's how today played out. I have a room booked at Mountain Meadows Lodge tomorrow in Killington - my first time indoors in a week! I wanted to roll in early in the day to do a nero, but I was hiking ahead of schedule. If I didn't stop, I'd hit it a day early. Everyone else was going into Rutland to stay at the Yellow Deli (which is run by a cult, I've been told? The Twelve Tribes). I suspected it would be crowded and noisy, and I didn't want to break my 7 day stretch, especially the night before having a room. 
So I went to a campsite just off the AT, on the Long Trail (the two trails split off here). I figured there wouldn't be many people, since everyone goes to Rutland. I didn't expect it would only be me. :-)
Is this my only night on the AT this year sleeping alone? No wonder I feel a little jittery! And what a difference from my first year on the AT, when I had several nights alone in shelters.
So I did the thing I always do when I get in early / need some distraction / want a break from mosquitoes. Built a fire! (side note: you might wonder if hot chocolate and chili mac pair well for dinner. The answer is yes.)
Tangent about Ice Cream's name - he got it because his goal is to try as many Ben & Jerry's ice cream flavors as possible while he's here, since they only have limited flavors in Germany. I asked what his favorite so far has been, and he said Phish Food. I asked if he knew what Phish was - he didn't. So I educated a German about the band Phish. My job here is done. :-) You're welcome, Cousin Brian.","Clarendon Shelter

AT-AT Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574673,"Today was so fantastic and made me so happy, I don't even know where to begin. After I arrived at Mountain Meadows Lodge and checked in, the first thing I did was take out a kayak on Kent Pond - a beautiful 100-acre lake. I saw a loon and followed it for the longest time, channeling Thoreau, ""Brute Neighbors."" I paddled alongside Canadian geese and watched little birds shaking their tail feathers on the shore. It was stunningly beautiful.
I must have been out there 2 hours until hiker hunger drove me back inside.
I showered, ordered pizza, did laundry, got a book (classic YA horse literature! The Black Stallion's Filly), read in a hammock, ate a ton, hit the hot tub, called Mr. AT-AT, then went out on the kayak again for sunset!
I've had the entire place to myself. It's just been amazing.
I'm realizing the real benefit of the resupply boxes is that I don't have to go out and shop - I can stay put somewhere awesome like this!
I've just loved it here so much. SO glad I didn't just do what everyone else was doing and go to the Yellow Deli. Spending a day in a kayak on a lake was exactly what I needed.

AT-AT Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/574674,"Once again, this is the joy of not necessarily reading everything about the trail ahead. This wasn't planned - originally I was heading to Wintturi shelter but I had the worst time leaving Mountain Meadows this morning. :-) So I knew it would be a short day.  I saw a strange lookout tower listed in the book that was supposed to have good views...and we all know what a sucker I am for tenting with a view.
On the way here, another hiker called out, ""AT-AT Walker!""  And I realized...I had no idea who he was! There's just so many people I'm meeting every night now! All the tall skinny bearded guys start blending together!
Anyway, I didn't know what to expect, which made the surprise of this place even better. There were just 6 of us: Little Prince, Reese, J, Froze, Pongo, and me. We all climbed up to this widow's walk on the roof of the shelter, and settled in for sunset. Pongo (""from 101 Dalmatians"") had a ukulele and sang songs for us. It was pure magic! His set included:
""Ho Hey,"" The Lumineers""Thirty-three,"" Smashing Pumpkins""Mario Kart Love Song,"" Sam Hart""All Star,"" Smash Mouth
Imagine listening to any of these songs, if you know them, while watching the sky burn with sunset, setting the trees all around you aglow. I took photos and video, but nothing could do it justice. We were 6 hikers who won't meet again - a mixture of NOBOs and SOBOs - who just came together on a roof one night and shared this experience.
I wanted so much to thank Pongo for his gift - live music is such a treat on the trail. In Killington, I'd purchased maple sugar candies, since I have it on the best authority that these were *the* candies to get at Silver Bay. So I brought up the candies to the roof and we all split them. A sweet ending to a sweet night!","Mountain Meadows Lodge / Killington

I skipped having a wet tent for a good stretch there, I was due. Also it was still better than being in the shelter. The mosquitoes are out in full force, so I'm trying to cover up as much skin as possible.
I broke my not-falling streak today and it was totally my fault. I was texting while hiking and my foot caught a root and down I went. On my left knee, of course. I should know better!
This shelter has a bunch of people, but they're all spread out doing their own thing. Maybe they, like me, want a break from socializing.
Today was slow and gorgeous. Vermont, man. Soft rolling paths...Stone walls...Green pastures...The first raspberries and conical blackberries I've seen in ages. It kept changing and was so pretty!
At one point there was a roadside farm stand (finally!) and I bought:
- hummus - green bell pepper- horseradish cheddar- pepperoni- blueberry kefir- maple soda- homemade chocolate chip cookies- hamburger bun
and then proceeded to eat nearly all of it. Normally I just eat small snacks throughout the day and do a ""walking lunch."" I was *so sluggish* after eating all that. I swear it was the whole container of hummus on top of it all that did it. I was moving SLOW. But it was fine. I'd planned to do a short day anyway, and I was savoring Vermont!

I planned to meet up with my friend from grad school, the great cartoonist Isaac Cates, in Hanover. But I arrived too late in the day to meet him and the places to stay near Dartmouth were very expensive. I feel so fortunate that Isaac arranged for me to stay with his friends in West Lebanon, the Swans - who I met at his wedding. Morgan Swan was also a librarian at Yale while I was at the Beinecke doing archival research for Poetic Salvage: Reading Mina Loy.

I heard a few say it took much longer than they had anticipated. It started raining lightly on the way up, which was no big deal, but which contributed to the record-setting three falls in succession I had today!I was tired and hungry and had to ""hit the privy"" but couldn't because there were people behind me...
As usual, I didn't fall on the hard parts, I fell after. I fell into a mud pile. I hooked a foot in a tree root and went down on my knees, again in the mud for #2 just ten minutes later. And then I slipped on a wet rock and went down on my butt (that's new!) for fall #3. That time I just sat for a bit and cried with frustration.
The terrain was too steep for an 18 day. Oh yeah, and there was no water at the campsite last night, so no coffee, no oatmeal this morning. Just all kinds of things stacking up to be awful. I want to get to the hostel tomorrow, which is also why I was pushing. I was walking for 12 hours again. And only did 18 miles.

I didn't realize it was a weekend until I started seeing lots of day hikers. I've totally lost track of what day it is.
Hexacuba sounded like a cool shelter but wasn't actually anything special.
I finally made formal introductions with Wanderer yesterday. She's the girl with the partially shaved head and side ponytail that I've been seeing on and off for weeks, so it was nice to finally get her name! (She reminds me a bit of Margaery Tyrell)
I got turned around at the fire tower on the top of Smarts Mountain and a girl with giraffe spats helped me. Those gaiters were the coolest thing! I really want a pair. She looked like she had giraffe feet!
Note: Trader Joe's Sriracha bacon jerky is the best thing ever! It tastes amazing! It burns, but in a good way (hurts so good). It burns the roof of your mouth so you can enjoy the flavor even longer. I wish I had more. I am officially sick of peanut butter Clif bars and was pretty grossed out by the RX brand peanut butter protein bar.
Lots of hikers are talking about a trail angel who makes omelettes on Moonshine Road, just coming up. I'm going to be so heartbroken if there are no omelettes. I am dying for more food.
3:00
I love Carl the Omelette Man and his boxer Liberty! He has a whole setup in the forest, and every day just makes food for hikers. A LOT of food. He goes through 25-30 dozen eggs a DAY!
I had a five-egg omelette with cheese and ham and green peppers and onions, after a banana and a muffin and sour patch kids and orange juice and coffee! 
I tried to give him money, but he doesn't take any donations. This is just what he does.
The radio was on an 80s station and a bunch of us sang ""Video Killed the Radio Star"" together. When U2 came on, One Night Stand (a hiker) was just as excited as I was. I told him I just saw U2 in concert this year playing The Joshua Tree. Then we bonded over how great that album is.
Tiny joined us, very very happy for the food. We took a photo together. Everyone commiserated over falling in the mud. The goodness today made up for how terrible yesterday was.
Never in my life have I had a five egg omelette. (all the guys were having 6 or more. He once made a 24-egg omelette for a hiker!) I could actually see my stomach distended. A food baby! An omelette bump!
I've been hiking with just my chest straps on, the waist unbuckled, just so I can digest all that food while hiking!
I've put 700 miles on this pair of shoes (including Pennsylvania!) and it's starting to show--the toebox on the left is separating from the shoe and the fabric on top is tearing.
Hair Candy was also in line at the Omelette Man's---we've met before but I couldn't remember where. His name comes from waking up in a shelter with mice chewing on his hair.
We swapped stories about falling on the trail. One guy had turtled, meaning he fell backwards onto his pack on a rock in such a way that his legs weren't reaching the ground and he couldn't get back up.
One of the guys was wondering when his last 20 on the trail would be, since the terrain is about to get a lot lot harder. The others were getting on his case about doing too many miles, telling him to focus on the smiles, not the miles.
The Whites begin tomorrow. Mt. Moosilauke. I'm SO nervous. But also excited. The fear of the unknown is awful. I want to finally SEE what the fuss is about, to know what I'm dealing with. My goal is 7.8 to Beaver Brook shelter.

AT-AT Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575253,"Am I writing this in a jacuzzi with jets pummeling the backs of my calves? You bet I am!
So here's how I got here. 
Today was a quintessential AT day. It didn't start well - I hardly slept at the hostel last night, I was so anxious about the Whites. A lot of other people were slackpacking, doing the climb in reverse to make it easier. I wondered if I should too. But no, I wanted to do it under my own power, the right way, with the same gear I've carried since Georgia.
Breakfast was hearty - baked French toast with the last of my Vermont maple syrup, bacon, coffee. Sometimes I think I could hike anything with enough food and coffee. I downloaded a ton of Israel Story episodes for the trek up the mountain. 
And I was surprised...by how manageable it really was. It was long, but I went slow. (And now, thanks to Israel Story, I'm semi-obsessed with seeing the ""new"" bus station in Tel Aviv).
I felt such unbridled happiness when I summitted Moosilauke and the other hikers, led by Wanderer, started cheering. At first it was covered in moving mist (very Ireland!) and then the sun broke through, and the views were stunning.
We stayed there a while, snacking and reveling in the view. Then Wanderer and I hiked down from Moosilauke together. It was fun to talk about shared memories, places we had both hiked, hikers we both knew. I mostly like to hike alone, but sometimes, like today, hiking with someone else is a real treat. It was fun to commiserate with someone else over the hard parts - esp. the wet, dodgy wooden ""stairs"" sunk into the rock alongside the waterfall that were sometimes level. After concentrating on them for a couple hours while going downhill you lose all sense of gravity and where flat / level would be. Wanderer fell 2 or 3 times while I was with her, but bounced up, no problem. Surprisingly I never fell. But then again I usually don't fall on the hard stuff. I fall on easy stuff later.
I was hiking faster than normal because I was with her and never noticed the shelter I had planned to stay at. We cruised right past it. I know it's only day one, but the Whites so far just aren't as bad as everyone was scaring me into thinking. Or maybe I've just been doing this kind of hiking for so long now that it just seems like an extension of everything else.
So far, it's challenging but not ludicrously, near-prohibitively hard. Ulysses, not Finnigans Wake.
At the bottom, at Kinsman Notch, we met Terodactyle (his spelling). He was doing trail magic and looking for thru-hikers who needed a place to stay. We are both LASHers, so we continued to the parking lot to get a ride to a hostel. I didn't have phone service. But two men from Boston offered us a lift to the Notch Hostel - weirdly where I have a reservation for two nights from now. But the hostel was full. 
(The logistics of how you can hike for two days and end up staying at the same place you were at before - you have to see a map to understand it)
So Wanderer and I took to the road to walk to town and figure something out. She had friends at a motel so that was my new Plan C. But then Terodactyle drove by and saw us again! He offered to take us in.
Wanderer went with her friends and I went with the flying dinosaur. But before we said goodbye, she took a Darth Vader helmet keychain (that I had admired!) off her pack and gave it to me. How incredibly sweet is that?! It's now hanging above my right shoulder- just in case there's any doubt which side of the force AT-ATs are on. :-)
Terry is a retired firefighter who thru-hiked last year and is going to do the PCT (I'll trail magic you there!). He has a condo in Lincoln, is a great source of knowledge, loves trail journals as much as I do, and especially likes helping hikers in need - The ones on the verge of quitting. This isn't me, so I feel especially fortunate that he made an exception. His place is basically paradise – hot tubs, pools, air hockey, Ms. Pac-Man, sauna, clean soft beds. Fuego, who I hiked with, stayed there the night before!
He made me a pizza and we swapped trail stories. He gave me the option of having the room to myself or sharing with other hikers he'd find. I believe in sharing the wealth! So he went to Chet's place (Chet is a beloved local who puts up hikers in bunkbeds in his garage) and found a hiker (Sequoia), who was on the floor because the bunks were full. He brought her back along with a couple he met at Price Chopper who knew my name! 
(aside: we don't have Price Choppers in California. It's a grocery store with a ridiculous name)
It turns out the couple were NOBO LASHers named Ginger Root and Goldfish. I talked to them at the Dirt Cowboy while waiting for Isaac in Hanover. The trail is such a small roving community!

Also: The logbook at the shelter is super old and still has the 2016 hikers. And there is a drawing by Atlas!!! It made me so happy to see it!
There are 10 pads here, so smooth and flat, and the way my tent is staked out I can see all around it from inside. And I'm protected from the relentless mosquitoes! I don't know where they came from – all day it was bug-free.
My tent is so pretty in the sunlight!
I love the shifting light on the tent, the shadows of pine needles, the way the crinkles in the fabric make it look like vellum. I totally just took video with my phone of the interplay of light on the tent!
It's so nice to be able to sit in the tent and gaze out at the water below. There's a patch of mossy bank with four perfectly placed gold mushrooms. There are fallen logs bleached white like bones. Smooth gray boulders surrounded by water reflecting the fading light from the sky above. It's getting dark on the forest floor but you can see the treetops are still bright with sunlight.
So far it hasn't been cold enough to warrant any of my extra gear, but that may change as I hike higher up. For now the puffy jacket serves as a new pillow.
I love being lazy and having all this time! I made the spaghetti Mountain House for dinner. It's so simple, it is currently my favorite dinner, a bit like Beefaroni.
I hope I can get up early and get an early start tomorrow. There's supposed to be rain tomorrow afternoon, but hopefully after I finish the climb.

I ended up cutting some leftover line on the tree that someone else left, tying it to one of her lines, then tying my bearbag line to that in order to get her line tied over my tent and onto a mostly dead tree! My tent is anchored with a combination of rocks, strings, and one large stick. It's all sway-backed and ridiculous – probably not rainworthy at all, so luckily we're not due for rain tonight.
(Side note: Mother Nature carries tiny screw hooks for just these occasions - so you can properly stake out on a wooden platform. I wish I had had this tip before I started!)
I first met Mother Nature back at the Hikers Welcome Hostel, then again at the Notch Hostel. We met at the top of the mountain today and hiked together for the rest of the day. Lots of laughs and commiseration! Perhaps my favorite part was when we saw a grey jay checking out our campsite. Mother Nature got out granola, I got out a bag of nuts, and we took turns feeding the jay out of our hands! It was so neat, this big, beautiful bird landing on my hand, but weighing so little, his little claw feet grasping my fingers!
If fire is hiker TV, feeding grey jays is cable.
The views today (""Day 146!"" Mother Nature just announced on her side. Day 54 for me) were just. . . The best I've had on the AT. I don't even know how to describe the overwhelming happiness I had walking along Franconia Ridge with views all around me. . . The green, green rocks always reminding me of Ireland . . .The rocky mountain where the old man's face used to be, making me think of Yosemite. . . it was so beautiful, it nearly hurt. Just view after view after view. Stunning!
When I first got up, the mist was still clearing, but after that it was clear, sunny, and intensely windy. You could lean into the wind and it would hold you up! Hiking in it was something!
We hiked Little Haystack Mountain, Mount Lincoln, Mount Lafayette (""the Lancelot of the Revolutionary set!""), and Mount Garfield.
I only felt tired going up Garfield – my legs were jelly from the long day and I was just *tired*, pulling myself up by my arms as much as I could. On top of one of the hills past Lafayette, we got to chatting with a day hiker. When he found out we were doing the AT, he insisted on giving us money as trail magic. I kept pushing the money away and he kept pushing it back. He was going to give us both $20 each but I said it was too much - but if he insisted, we'd share the $20. He said we could call him $20 Tom. 
We used it to pay for our tenting tonight and have five dollars left over for pastries at a hut.
It got chilly up there – first time I wore my gloves and Aquarium of the Pacific dive beanie. And it's definitely going to be cold tonight. It's the first time I am wearing the silk base layers. I'm also wearing the gloves. We'll see how it goes!","Liberty Springs trailhead

AT-AT Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575751,"Choosing a stopping point is tricky in the Whites because there are limited available places (especially when you get above tree line), so your miles are kind of set. We could've continued to the next campsite, but that would be those obnoxious tent pads again, and really wouldn't change the mileage much tomorrow. I'm almost a day ahead of where I thought I'd be, so I'm not feeling the miles pressure.
I was happy to stop because I was tired and it's a nice spot by the stream. Much warmer than last night because of the lower elevation.
Last night the wind was so strong and cold. And I could feel the cold draft from below my tent - between the slats of the tent pad. The top of me stayed warm but the bottom got cold. And my arms got sore from being in the bent / fetal position, and it's hard to straighten them out in the bag. This is a 34° bag. I wonder what it got down to last night. 
Our big climb today was in the morning. Up to 5000 feet, South Twin Mountain. I fell pretty early on, a flat section with roots and rocks. Scraped my left forearm, no biggie. Mother Nature thought it was funny that I called out, ""I'm fine!"" even before I hit the ground.
Later in the day, I encountered a woman with a bleeding elbow. Apparently the strong wind just blew her over and she fell into the bushes!
There was a steep climb down too - one so bad that we had to go down backwards, facing the rock, like a ladder. There was also a real ladder of sorts today, made out of logs.
Side note: every time we pass the signs alerting us to the fact that we're entering the Alpine Zone, I sing ""Welcome to the Alpine Zone!"" to the tune of ""Danger Zone"" from Top Gun. This amuses me greatly.
We stopped at two huts today – neither had the soup or pastries. The first was a huge disappointment. I was looking forward to pancakes like the ones we got for free at Lonesome Lake Hut. Instead all they had was cold, gray oatmeal. Plain oatmeal. Which we ate anyway, because hello, hiker hunger.
Afterwards I was craving something sweet, so I ate the entire Trader Joe's dark chocolate bar I had. I'm not even a dark chocolate person in real life. It was soooo tasty.
The second hut had a little leftover bread, which Mother Nature and I devoured.
I can see the sun starting to set out the front of my tent. It's nice. Maybe I'll have some time for The Black Stallion.","Garfield Ridge campsite

I'm sitting in the warm hut, humid from all the wet hikers and gear, warming up and drying out. It started raining this morning, just as I was packing up (luckily!), and it rained all day. I didn't mind much – the rain jacket and skirt kept me dry. I knew it was only a matter of time before my feet got soaked – especially since there's a hole above my toes on my left shoe! But my feet stayed dry longer than I would've guessed.
I was alone nearly all day, since I had to go back for my mug at the campsite and Mother Nature was ahead. But I didn't mind. I put on more Israel Story episodes and set in for a long, slow, wet climb. Someone had written in Guthook, ""prepare to break your poles today,"" so I knew it was going to be challenging.
But WOW. At one point, I was staring up this sheer rock face. . . I hadn't seen any blazes, and I thought, ""This *can't* be it."" But I didn't see any alternatives and Guthook showed the trail going up. I really wondered if I was doing the rocky summit version of bushwhacking. It was scary, looking for handholds while pulling myself up wet, sheer rock. So I put on my AT playlist. . .and the Prodigy song came on (thanks again, Mike & Briita's wedding!). Turns out, it's perfect to climb to! Maybe the fact that the views were whited-out was a blessing – I couldn't see how high I was, how far I'd fall if I slipped! It felt like such a huge accomplishment when I reached the top. I had to pull my rain skirt way up in order to raise my leg high enough to pull up my body. Sometimes I had to use my knees and basically crawl until I found the next handhold. It also felt great to throw my weight forward onto the rock – pack and all – and feel anchored there.
I didn't fall today! Victory!
I've been noticing almost constant hunger though. I don't feel tired the way I did back in the days of climbing in the humidity in Connecticut, etc. So I don't feel like I'm exerting myself as much, because I'm not dying sweating. But I must be burning crazy calories climbing. And I'm ravenous.
Looking at the map, I'm halfway through the Whites already!
When we arrived at the hut, we were finally able to get soup! And some cornbread and a cup of coffee. There are tons of folks here hoping for Work for Stay (WFS). I just went straight to the tent sites – they're right here and I wanted to make sure I got a spot and got set up before the rain again. I had better luck with this tent pad compared to the one I split with Mother Nature. I could put my stakes between the gaps in the boards. I put my tent way off to the side, so there's room for one more person.
Soon I'll head back down to the tent and make dinner. But I'm hoping my skin will dry out and un-shrivel first, and I can hit the nice bathroom one more time.
6:45 pm
Snug in my tent, reading about Black Minx preparing for the Kentucky Derby. Happy to be in and dry, although I will have to pack up a wet tent in the morning. Mount Washington tomorrow!! Won't have views, but that's OK. I'll always have Franconia Ridge. Too bad I can't download more podcasts for the monster climb! Guess it will be albums.
*So* glad I bought the external battery. I'm recharging the phone now.
They made the poor thru-hikers wait for hours before they chose the WFS people. (and by the time they turned them away, there weren't many options left). Wanderer got it. Good for her!

AT-AT Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575763,"All day we've been passing day hikers. We keep wondering: where are they coming from? Where are they going? And then once we started getting giddy from fatigue, we passed this huge cairn at Thunderstorm Junction, and then Mother Nature came up with her theory that rock cairns are nests for day hikers.
We had such GREAT weather today! Which was surprising, because it rained all night. I was pretty much resigned to another day of walking in the rain. What a surprise! We had a clear view of Mount Washington as we approached it, which was so neat - To see the radio towers on top of it slowly growing as we grew nearer.
The ground was glittering on the way up from all the mica. My shoes sparkled with it too.
We made great time up Washington. It wasn't as hard as parts of yesterday, just long. When we got up there, it was a ZOO - tons of tourists head up there by car and train, and it was a Sunday afternoon with good weather. On top of that, a bike race had just finished, so the line to get a photo with the summit sign was filled with people with bikes. We decided to grab food first, wait for the line to go down. A slice of pizza, a bowl of lobster bisque, a chili dog, and a yogurt parfait – that I washed down with an ice tea. I haven't felt that close to full in a while. The summit was clouded over when we got there, but we didn't mind. We had loads of views all the way up.
Mother Nature took a fall early today – banged up her knee pretty bad, along with her thumb and forearm. We cleaned up in the bathroom at the top of Mount Washington and hung out in the bathroom for half an hour or so, charging our phones and cracking jokes. We laughed a lot today. . . and got lost coming down the mountain. There's cairns on multiple trails, not just the AT. And there are basically no blazes and often the AT isn't even listed on the signs except for when another hiker has hand-carved it in.
On the way here, I started thinking about asking for Work For Stay. I didn't ask last night because so many people were in line for it and it took the hut croo so long to choose and meanwhile tent sites were filling up. But we were the first out in the morning and no thru-hikers had passed us, so we had a good shot and I was determined to ask. 
I got here first, so I went in, introduced myself, and asked. Initially they said they only had two spots and they were full – so I headed to the bathroom but by the time Mother Nature arrived, one WFS decided to buy a bunk from a cancellation, opening up a spot. They said we both could do WFS! 
Free food! A warm place to sleep! A classic AT experience! Yes!","Mizpah Spring Hut / Nauman campsite
",Madison Spring Hut,"Aug 19, Sat",11.80
AT-AT Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/575950,"Last night I did a variety of little chores for the Work For Stay –  helped clean off tables, sweep, clean windows, clean grills - and then we feasted! It was a Thanksgiving meal – turkey, cranberry sauce, a baked apple with raisins, couscous, bread, peas, pumpkin pie. We were so happy! 
Then when it was close to lights out, the guests left the dining room and we set up our beds for the night. SOBO Trout, Greybeard, and Mother Nature pushed in the benches so they could sleep on the floor between picnic tables. I selected a bench seat against the wall and slept there. It was wonderfully warm! It was the first time in a while where I slept stretched out – not balled up in the fetal position for warmth. The only downside was the epic snoring. Whenever I'm inside, someone always snores! (and earplugs aren't enough)
So now....let me tell you about our hardest day in the Whites!
* * * * *
We woke up at Madison Spring hut and left early, since the regular guests needed the dining room for breakfast. If I had known what we were going into, I might have worn pants and probably would've taken less water. Anyway, we left the hut before they had posted the day's weather forecast, not that it would've helped much – the weather hasn't been matching the forecast.
I hadn't thought much about Madison before – people talk about Washington, the Presidentials, the Wildcats -  and it's the lowest of a series of climbs (but at over 5,000 feet, still formidable) People also talked with some trepidation about being ""above treeline,"" but I didn't really get what that truly meant either. I figured it meant full exposure to the sun. I didn't think about wind. 
I realize how foolish/naïve I sound. But when you're hiking every day, it's hard to keep up with all of the particulars of the terrain you'll cover.
It was socked in and windy, much more so than the windiness we encountered back at Franconia Ridge. And it was all climbing rocks. 
The trail was marked by rock cairns at intervals. But the conditions were so foggy, we couldn't see the next cairn. We'd come up on a cairn and not be able to see anything ahead - it just looked like the end of the earth: ""Here there be dragons."" 
We were laughing at how strong the wind was, whipping the American flag at the summit like crazy! It was also all above treeline, rocky and barren like the surface of the moon.
We took some photos and videos at the top – because at that point, we still could. But after the summit was a long exposed ridge walk – and that's where things got really hard. 
The wind just broadsided us - it reminded me of driving my parents' minivan along the Altamont Pass during string winds, the way the van would get pushed into the next lane. Except the van was now me in a pack, laden with 1 1/2 liters of water. (Mother Nature at one point dumped her water - but mine was in a bladder I couldn't reach. Also, she mostly dumped hers because she was so sick of her water bottles falling out!)
The wind knocked us off our feet. We both took multiple spills onto the rocks, and at one point both of us were super low to the ground, trying to stay stable, and both got knocked onto our butts. I remember looking over at Mother Nature right after I hit ground, incredulous that she was in the same position!
It was scary - I'd get blown onto my back and struggle to get back up again. Things were blowing out of our pockets, off our packs - even a zipper pull on Mother Nature's pack was ripped off by the wind!
We were both holding onto rocks for support while also trying to avoid falling onto them. Somewhere in the madness, Mother Nature sliced open her pinky - and I could tell where she'd been, because she was leaving bloody fingerprints behind on the rocks!
If she hadn't been there with me, I would have been really freaked out. I worried that we shouldn't be up there in those conditions. I worried that we'd never get back to treeline, where the blessed trees would finally block the wind!
The wind was continuous, punctuated by these crazy gusts, which made it all even harder. We could tell when the wind would drop back a bit, and we'd try to speed to the next cairn for shelter before the next gust began. It was just insane.
We were both tiring quickly. It was basically crawling - we stowed our poles because we needed our hands to grip the rocks for dear life. At one point I was going down the ridge backwards, crawling as if on a ladder, because it was the best way to stay low and stable. My pack was getting blown around my body, twisting everywhere. 
It took us about 2 hours to go 1 mile. 
I'd never been so happy to see trees again!
I keep thinking about how much worse today would have been without Mother Nature to keep me company. I definitely would have gotten closer to panicking. There are parts of the trail that are so much better when shared with others. To have someone to laugh with when it gets hard, to break the tension when it gets scary. 
We have an ongoing joke that our hiking objective each day is: don't fall, don't die. So far we've been successful!
* * * * *
I'm now at the Joe Dodge Lodge at Pinkham Notch, praying that no one in the bunk room snores tonight. I found out that they didn't have laundry – despite the fact that I was told they did when I made the reservation. So I did perhaps the most hiker trash thing yet this trip – hand-washed everything in the shower using their shampoo and then hung it out behind the lodge to dry! 
At dinner I chatted with a New Hampshire family at my table, here to do a three or four night hiking trip, staying at the huts. They asked me lots of questions – how do I charge my phone? (hostels, bathroom outlets, external battery) What kind of boots do I wear? (La Sportiva trail runners) What's ""trail magic""? (good turns people do for hikers, anything from a cooler of sodas in the woods to a ride and place to stay for the night). It was sweet. You take all of this knowledge for granted, forget that you had to pick it up somewhere.
My next food box didn't arrive yet - probably because I'm two days early. But I did have a great surprise: Mom sent me the sriracha bacon jerky, Scandinavian Sea Creatures, and Trader Joe's instant coffee! Fueled with these goodies, I can climb anything! Thanks Mom!
And don't worry, I'm back from the windstorm and totally safe.","Madison Spring Hut

AT-AT Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576586,"The night that I had booked for Joe Dodge Lodge / Pinkham Notch, Mother Nature was invited to stay with friends of her aunt. I was invited too - but Joe Dodge wouldn't allow me to cancel my reservation without losing all my money. (One of many reasons why hikers call the Appalachian Mountain Club, or AMC, the American Money Club).
So last night I stayed alone in the bunkroom at Joe Dodge, and Mother Nature was at a magical country log cabin with Santa and Mrs Claus (more on that soon). But she decided to zero for the next day - and they offered to come back and get me to join in the fun!!!
When Mother Nature told me to look for someone in the parking lot who looked like Santa, I thought she was kidding, or at least, being helpfully descriptive. But the magnificent Stephen Harris of Quincy, MA doesn't just look like Santa - he has Santa business cards! He appears as Santa at parties and events!
Yes, Virginia, Santa is real - and he has one heck of a Boston accent. :-)
Lovely Jean Harris, who is actually Mrs. Claus, and Mother Nature picked me up and whisked me off to Randolph, where they have a cabin at the bottom of Mt Madison - that's right, from their backyard you can see the crazy mountain we climbed yesterday morning!
I am in awe of everything. How beautiful it is at the log cabin Santa built. The fact that I laid for hours reading and writing in a hammock on the porch overlooking wild black-eyed susans and blueberries. These big-hearted, hilarious people who don't know either Mother Nature or myself, but welcome us in their home. It's pretty incredible.
We walked down to the stream on their property, which they said was recently dammed up by beavers, and I kept thinking, I want to live somewhere where you can just walk out and see the work of beavers. They even had a bear in their garden this morning.
We just had such a relaxing day full of fun! It was the day of the solar eclipse, which wasn't complete here in New Hampshire, but no matter - we traded glimpses into carefully-constructed cereal box viewers to watch it (and in all honesty, looking at people looking into cereal boxes was more fun then looking at the eclipse). We tried other methods too - Mother Nature held a colander, which threw concentric rings of eclipse crescents all over the deck, and Jean figured out how to project the eclipse using a telescope and paper.
Mother Nature and I ate lots of food, picked blueberries, tried to catch up with our trail blogs....We met some of the Harris' friends and neighbors, had a huge meal (I made the baked mac and cheese!), shared s'mores over an enormous fire out back.

AT-AT Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576588,"This morning I made blueberry pancakes for Mother Nature and I, then packed up a couple to take with me as a snack on the trail! The Harrises' neighbor Rhonda drove us back to Pinkham Notch, where my food box was waiting!
Inside were fresh homemade brownies from Mr. AT-AT Walker! Which we naturally dug into immediately.
We didn't really have a plan for today – I fell asleep early last night without looking at the map and Mother Nature was binge-watching Game of Thrones. We roughly figured we'd walk until we got tired or the rain started, then we'd camp. We were doing the Wildcats today and have heard different things about how hard they would be.
It was a climb all right, especially after resupplying. We stopped at the last hut, Carter Notch hut, for water and coffee (and the last of the brownies) and then tried to decide what to do. We knew a storm was coming but there were limited stealth sites sites ahead. We noted a few, then started the crazy climb out of there – 1000 feet over a mile. It was tough going, especially since now I was loaded down with 3 liters (6 pounds) of water in anticipation of stealthing somewhere without a water source. My heart was working hard on the way up – which morbidly made me think of the list of White Mountain fatalities I saw at the visitor center in Pinkham Notch and how many of them were heart attacks. (To be fair, a decent amount of the fatalities on Mt Washington were actually car accidents)
We passed one bad looking spot with dead trees, and kept going, and just as the rain started, we found a better stealth site just at the edge of treeline. There were two other tents plus a hammocker already there. We hurriedly set up in the little space that was left. I'm on a goofy slope, but don't really care. Unfortunately the air is really moist. I'm getting condensation inside the tent already.

The trail was freakishly smooth. . .trail-like. Soft leaves and dirt. Actual trail! We haven't seen trail that was non-rocks in forever. But we were still tired climbing it. After-effects of the Whites, maybe.
We passed a gorgeous pond of water lilies and the 1900 mile marker. 
I was zombie-walking at the end of the day - leaning heavily on my poles, my feet moving mostly out of inertia. This is normally when I fall, and sure enough, down I went.
I'm falling with such regularity, it's no big deal anymore. Mother Nature had to help me get back up, though, because I fell backwards onto a stick that was poking into my lower back when I tried to get up.
The water source here is the pond, and I'm not a fan of the iced-tea-colored water I brought up in my platypus. But it smelled fine and tasted okay in my coffee and dinner.
We had a long conversation about Gremlins over dinner. :-)
More pin-holes are appearing in my tent fabric. My pack is also starting to show serious wear and tear, especially the back pocket fabric, which is tearing open from all the times I keep sliding down rocks on it. I'm patching everything with Tenacious Tape.

AT-AT Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576612,"We're in MAINE!!!!!!!
So far it is cold, muddy, rocky, hard, and beautiful!
Last night I was completely annoyed by the SOBOs who came in late, set up near us, and wouldn't shut up, even after it was dark and past hiker midnight. It was so obnoxious. We got up this morning before the motormouths and Mother Nature gave them a taste of their own medicine by being super loud as she packed up. 
Then it was back to the bogs for our first climb of the day. The ground has been so wet. You do all kinds of contortions along the edges of the trail, pushing yourself into trees, trying to avoid stepping into the swamps of sadness (ARRRRRTAX!!!!). But sooner or later, the mud gets you. My whole damn left shoe (the one with the hole in it) sunk in to my ankle. Naturally after this happened...I took a photo of it.
When we got up to peaks, it was dark, cold, and windy, but still pretty. We sang songs (badly) to entertain ourselves and distract ourselves from the hard climbs. (Thank you, Mother Nature, for getting ""Yummy, yummy, yummy, I've got love in my tummy"" stuck in my head for DAYS. Only after I got wifi again could I look it up and figure out what it was. Why on earth do we know this 1968 song?)
And then finally - the state boundary marker for Maine!!!!! The sign itself was anticlimactic – barely held up by a pile of rocks, the font the same as the other signs – but we were so excited! I remember three summers ago, when I started hiking in Georgia and Maine seemed impossibly far away (thousands of miles, in fact!). The reality of finally crossing into my last state, having traversed 13 others! The last state! This is where Katahdin is! This is MAINE!
We took tons of pictures and Mother Nature had celebratory Pop Rocks. Speaking of food, my hunger today was off the charts. All I want to do is eat. I wonder if the cool temperatures are contributing to it, having to burn extra calories to stay warm? All I know is I ate two of those Trader Joe's bars, one covered in a packet of peanut butter, and an entire thing of bacon jerky, and it didn't even take the edge off. It's miserable.
Today had tons of those board planks over swamps, in various states of disrepair. And rebar climbs. So. many. rebar. climbs. And scary rebar descents too, where the rebar wasn't level.
It's so exciting to be in Maine. I think we would have been overcome by the beauty at the top if a) we hadn't just come out of the gorgeous Whites and b) it wasn't so cold.
We also came up on several strange turkey / chicken / dinosaur-looking birds. Grouse?
We summitted five mountains today and set ourselves up for tomorrow: the dreaded Mahoosuc Notch! (Which AWOL describes  as ""the most difficult or fun mile of the AT"" and Guthook describes as ""a deranged jumble of boulders."")
I think I'll wear my pants tomorrow, as I expect to be on my hands and knees a lot. 
I enjoyed hiking to Hozier today. Got choked up on the song about insects and death (""In a Week"") because it was so delicately beautiful and sad. And then I switched to my Prince Party playlist. Am I the first hiker to climb these mountains to Prince?

AT-AT Walker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576642,"The mileage does not at all reflect the work we put in today! Holy cow. Any of the pieces of what we did today – Mahoosuc Notch, Mahoosuc Arm, Old Speck Summit, up the super scary ladder up the observation tower – any one of those on its own would have been a big challenge. A month ago, I probably would've reserved the whole day for Mahoosuc Arm. But we did all of them today!
I started by eating three packets of oatmeal with peanut butter, knowing I was going to need the extra calories. And Mother Nature set about trying to make her pack as compact as possible, anticipating the tight squeezes we would be doing. We both stowed our poles. I wore my sleeping pants, figuring I'd be on my knees and butt a lot today. Then off we went.
Mahoosuc Notch: A little ravine or valley, filled with giant boulders and loose suggestions for the path through them. It was basically, you look out, see two options, neither looks good, you pick one and keep going. :-)
I actually like the tactical parts of climbing a lot – but I'm not a fan of sheer drops, and of course, doing it all with a ginormous  pack.
We took turns leading – and it was interesting to see our different approaches. Mother Nature tries to avoid sitting on her butt on rocks. I am *all for it*.
We used our hands a lot. There was one descent that was a sheer rock wall with a thick, fixed tree root hanging down.  I basically used that and my arm strength alone to rappel down! Mother Nature took one look at that and decided to do something else.
We only had to take off our packs once or twice to pass under rocks. I got videos of one of them.
We saw almost no one. But I did think it was funny when I heard a SOBO probably only 5 feet away, but still couldn't see him because of the rocks!
Once again, it was a mile of trail that took us 2 or 2 1/2 hours to complete. But it was a lot of fun as well as challenging and we laughed a lot through it.
After that, we headed to Mahoosuc Arm. I don't know why it has that name… Although the singular ""arm"" made me think of Trogdor the Burninator.
Mahoosuc Arm was a long, long, long climb. We still had our poles stowed, because it involved hand climbing as well. It was exhausting. I played a lot of music to get through the morning. 1500 feet over 1 mile!
At the almost-top of the arm, I collapsed onto the rock (""corpse pose!""). We ate more snacks.
Then it was a down a bit to Speck Pond, where I took some lovely photos of lily pads.
And then there was MORE climbing to go up Old Speck.  It was just long, giant slabs of rock angled up into the sky. You could walk on it - the rock was grippy - but it was relentless. And as we got higher, the wind picked up… And it was echoes of Madison! The views were stunning, but honestly I didn't look back much, because I was so focused on keeping my balance and moving up.
The Prodigy song kicked in again at one of the hairier moments. It really is aural courage!
I honestly don't know how I made it up some of those sections. It's like some primitive animal part of my brain took over. Finally, that was done too - and Mother Nature wanted to do the side trail to the fire tower. So along we went. I wasn't sure I'd do it – I've chickened out on fire towers before. And this one – are you ready for this – was a single, continuous *ladder*.
Mother Nature went up first. Then I went up halfway. I probably would've stopped there if it was just me – but she was at the top, encouraging me. So what the heck, up I went. The 360 degree views were, of course, incredible.
And then we continued on… And I just ran out of gas. We'd been joking for hours that our bodies were like cars with the fuel light on...and the car was on fire. Mother Nature was feeling muscle pain. I didn't have that, just insane fatigue. I was zombie-walking with just about nothing left and we only went seven something miles. So as I said, the mileage really doesn't reflect the day. Maine is *hard*.
We watered up, came to the campsite, and proceeded to eat as much as we dared – knowing we can't resupply until my friend Kristin picks us up Monday morning. I ate a 750-calorie meal (the cheese enchiladas with tortilla chips inside - my new favorite), but my darn stomach was STILL rumbling. So then I threw in two packets of oatmeal and a cup of coffee.
I had strange dreams last night. In one, Kickstand wanted to quit the trail and I was trying to persuade him to continue.
I woke up a few times - once because the ground was cold and I'd somehow gotten off the Thermarest. In the dark, I tried to straighten it, and it wasn't until the morning that I realized I was practically perpendicular in the tent.
In the morning, I woke up to the sound of pinecones pelting the ground around my tent. Squirrel warfare?
There were times today when I was laughing so hard, I couldn't climb! I feel really fortunate to have made a friend on the trail - yet again, close to the end – and sad to say goodbye. I could totally go to Katahdin with Mother Nature and be done in a matter of weeks, but it's not in the cards for me. I will have that adventure in the future.
I'm glad I decided to get off the trail after Mahoosuc Notch. That's not an area where you want to be earning trail legs!","stealth site just before Mahoosuc Notch
