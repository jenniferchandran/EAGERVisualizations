Papa Bear Zeke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/520905,"WARNING: If you read some of this or all of this, don't expect that this makes you a psychological expert on Rick Oxner. These are just my thoughts, musings, feelings and ramblings about various subjects, emotions, feelings. Nothing more, nothing less. I hope that my friends and family find some nuggets to help them understand me, know me, and connect with me better. Maybe we will find some things in common that we didn't know we had before I left. To the guests that choose to tune in and read, maybe we become friends and meet someday, maybe on the trail or a trail where we feel like we are at home. We are all here for the same reasons I believe, how we get there is defined by too many things to mention at this point. Enjoy! 
As this gets closer and I talk about it more, I am excited, but scared and anxious too. Feels like going to Iraq again with the full range of emotions, concerns, worries, anxieties and excitement. So many questions personally and so many other questions about my gear. I guess everyone has some self doubt and I know it will subside once I am out hiking and moving forward. Am I mentally tough enough? Physically? Will I change? Will the world change?
A lot of this up until the journey will be about life, me questioning myself and my choices, things said and left unsaid, done and left undone. I may mention some names or refer to some events, but in no way intend any hurt feelings or create bad blood amongst my friends, acquaintances and family. Many of you will find it quirky, some will feel the emotion, some wont care about my thoughts, some will learn things about me, some will judge, some will accept, some will relate and some will disengage.
I know it's difficult for many to understand, but this is something I need to do for my soul. Hike the Appalachian Trail, Maine to Georgia, all 2100+ miles. This is not a whim based on the recent movie but something I have planned and thought about for 10+ years. Ever since returning from Iraq in 2005, divorce in 2007 and through the final years of my military career, I've felt I'm searching, lost in the wilderness, for what I don't know. Many say it's my lack of faith and true relationship with God, maybe they are right, I don't know, but I am drawn to this endeavor like none other. Peter Seeger once said, whenever I'm in the woods, I feel like I'm in church. There is not a better quote that can describe how I feel when hiking. 
""Make no mistake, this is not an extended vacation or physical activity, but a spiritual quest or journey for someone who is lost or seeking answers in the solace of the wilderness one hopes to find on the Appalachian Trail."" 
I've seen too many men my age group, plus or minus 10 years, plan and look forward to doing things only to never see it for they are struck with an unknown illness, have an accident, or just are taken away from this life too soon. I don't want to be that guy, none of us want to be, where time slips away too fast for us to do the things we dream about or just need to do. I am just in a unique position to do something about it.",,GA,"Feb 09, Tue",0
Papa Bear Zeke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521555,"Now less than 4 months out from the beginning of this ""epic"" trip, as many call it. I guess we wont know if its ""epic"" until I am complete, either in GA or wherever else I may decide I have had enough or gained what I was seeking. Of course my goal is nothing but completing but many things, injury being one could sidetrack that goal. And is really the goal actually just completing, I do not think it is, the GOAL is to EXPERIENCE the journey. Too many times we are focused on the destination and not the journey and miss so much along the way. Anyway, as I continue to stock up and prepare resupply packages, I constantly am wondering if I have it in me, really in me, mentally, emotionally and physically, to undertake this journey, not just hiking the trail, but the journey I feel I need to take. 
Its hard for me to define as I feel there are so many unknowns. People have asked me continuously about me but my usual reply is, ""I don't know"", because honestly I really don't know. I do know this sounds odd to many, but it is just where I am at this point, this point almost 53 years into my life, and I am sure that it has been brewing since day one, for some reason. Could it be that I have something unfinished from another life? If you believe in that type of thing. :-) Maybe it's all just a carry over from my childhood and the tumultuous times in and around home, maybe. Maybe it's about a continual string of failed intimate relationships, especially in the last 10 years, mostly because of me, not knowing or not being able to let go and feel. I tend to believe this is about the last fifteen years and all the changes in my life, 9/11, Bosnia, Iraq, divorce, failed relationships, move to DC and back, house fire, starting over, retirement from AF (harder than expected), new job, but mostly failed relationships. I have dated some really wonderful, fulfilling, smart, educated, funny, well travelled, athletic, kind, caring, loving women during this time, but just haven't been able to push myself over the hump and allow myself to love. There has been only one I told, ""I love you"" to in all this time and even then, it was only once, in her Volvo while going home after an evening out. I remember it clearly. It wasn't a fluke, I let go for a brief moment, but quickly retracted to my old self like I made a mistake. I was so miserable in DC, mainly because of the job. I became so disillusioned with serving and it really affected me, mentally and physically during my final years into retirement. Usually, the disillusionment went up the chain and not down, because there are so many that are serving for the right reasons, but being led by others for the wrong reasons. More to come on this. 
I stay busy, busy with a lot of things, just busy. Someone told me recently that I do so, only to fill the void in my life caused by the lack of God and I guess its possible and probable. Maybe that is what I am seeking, an inner peace and relationship with God, an understanding of what is and what will be. Recently, I had a series of random events in my life that leads me to believe that this could be the root of my personal failures. Is there a reason that I wasn't baptized at a young age in the Catholic church like my sisters? Was I left out for a reason? Again, I don't know and haven't asked my parents, maybe I need to, maybe that would be a start.",,GA,"Feb 22, Mon",0
Papa Bear Zeke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521636,"Filled my backpack last night with all the goodies and weighed in at 28lbs without good ole H2O, 3 liters, so I am estimating a good 35-40 lb pack considering my first leg will be through the 100 mile Wilderness with 10 days of food stuffs. I think I need to cut some weight and main areas are pack, sleeping bag and tent, maybe a pound each. Damn it was heavy!

Papa Bear Zeke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521748,"Had an interesting conversation with a good friend today and the discussion turned to whether or not I should blog. I have been contemplating this question a bit myself and am still a bit undecided. Will it enhance or detract from the experience of the journey away from all the distractions of life? While we both agreed it would be neat to share the journey with friends, family and strangers, does it change how you are approaching the experience? IDK? Also, if you are still connected, does it do as good as if you were not with disengaging from your current life, your choices and whatever it is your trying to do? Big questions to consider. Maybe blog just to keep records and read about in the future, only share certain ones during the experience and share the rest later. I will have to consider this one deeply and see where I land.",,GA,"Feb 24, Wed",0
Papa Bear Zeke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522202,"Everyday that I am at work is beginning to feel like a day lost. Man, why do we do this to ourselves? I cant wait to change it!
Just finished reading Becoming Odyssa, man what a great story by Jennifer Pharr Davis, inspirational, full of advice and information and gives you a relative idea of what to expect. 
Everyone that I talk to about my plan replies in some language to the effect of, ""Man, I wish I was you"", or ""it'll be a blast"", ""you'll have so much fun"", etc., but I know that what I am about to experience will be filled with its share of hardships, probably harder than I can imagine and I am preparing myself for the worst of everything so I can be really excited each day it isn't what I imagined. There will be many days, that no one wants to be where I am at that point in time. I know the weather will be awful at times, I will be cold and wet, hungry and tired, lonely and alone. But in the end I know, I will be a better Dad, Son, brother, friend and human being. Not that I am bad at any one of those, but it will change me, I know it will. 
On the bright side of things, at this point, I can count my blessings that I won't have to endure the elections this year considering the quality of the candidates that the two major political parties have put forth. Does everyone or anyone realize that these parties are just trying to rule you, Americans, through FEAR? They are nothing more than fear mongers trying to make you, us, afraid of the other party and each other. Nothing more, FEAR is a powerful tool and should never be used to LEAD.",,GA,"Mar 01, Tue",0
Papa Bear Zeke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522816,"Went on a 10 mile out and back training hike on the Ouachita Trail on 3/6, 33-35lb pack. What a beautiful day for hiking and time away. While moderately strenuous, I don't think it compares to what will face me in ME/VT/NH in June/July 2016. Hiked to Chinquapin Overlook, set up Eno, had lunch and enjoyed the view and peacefulness of the spring wind. One of the things I did notice I was doing was constantly thinking about ""how much further"", which I think can be detrimental to the enjoyment of a hike. I know you must have a plan and an idea of where your going and how long to get there, but I found it occupying to much space. Need to get past that and break it down to smaller ""elephant bites"" which is how I believe you must hike the AT. If you eat the elephant one bite at a time, it is much easier than looking at the whole 2200 miles. Makes sense, right?
When it was all said and done, I could have stayed up there all day.",,AT prep on OT,"Mar 07, Mon",0
Papa Bear Zeke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/522817,"OK, for some reason the D-100 day mark is important to me and makes this all so much more real, I am going to ME and attempt a thru hike, probably the most ambitious thing I have ever attempted, or so it feels that way! WOW, I am really going to do this but all of the sudden I feel a bit overwhelmed and wish the time would pass so I can get on with it. I read more details about Mt Washington yesterday, YIKES! That is going to be a challenge but I know I can do it and I have seen and heard of so many others conquering this, so I know I can. 
Still conflicted about blogging...hummmm",,GA,"Mar 08, Tue",0
Papa Bear Zeke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533925,"D-27! 
I am down to crunch time with the planning. Need to pack re-supply boxes this weekend and next week and label for friends to ship. I believe I will be about 50/50, re-supply along trail and get packages from home. Maybe my friends will include a little libations to enjoy along the way with new found friends. 
I haven't dedicated the time that I feel I need to up to this point over the last two months due to life getting complicated with ailing parent and other travels to see my son before his move from Philly to Boston and my departure. Its all good, the first week to two weeks may be harder than planned just b/c I am not in the shape I needed/wanted to be, but I will survive. Always have, always will. Starting yoga tomorrow morning in an attempt to loosen up a little and have gain some basic skills prior to departure that I can work on during the 5 1/2 months.",,GA,"May 19, Thu",0
Papa Bear Zeke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/538210,"Well as life would have it, all good plans change and mine have definitely changed. 
My Dad was placed in the hospital on Friday with a kidney infection and it has worsened to the point that he is currently in hospice so I travelled to Lutcher, LA to be with Mom and the family. I expect he will pass soon and I will reschedule travel, shuttles and changes best I can at this point. 
No complaints, I am right where I need to be.",,GA,"Jun 14, Tue",0
Papa Bear Zeke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544603,"Hiked to Katahdin Summit, Baxter Peak, today!! Man, what a hike! Made the summit in a fog bank and heavy winds this morning. Had about 25 yards visibility at many times so all I could do was follow the white blaze not knowing what I was climbing having no relative perception of my altitude or location to any edge.
It wasn't until I was hiking down the fog cleared and opened up this glorious view of Maine and BSP! Wow, what a sight indeed! Check out the pics! 
Unfortunately, on the way down a slight slip, injured my right knee and I hobbled about 5 miles back to Abol Campground and my lean to for the night.","BSP

Papa Bear Zeke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544614,"Headed southbound this morning by leaving my shelter at Abol in Baxter State Park, hiked 2 miles to KSC and turned south on the AT. What a beautiful hike along the banks of the ponds and streams. Met Chef, meat cutter from GA, who was also southbound. Chit chatted some, but not many words exchanged. My right knee was aching from slip previous day and was really inflamed to the point of being difficult to climb or descend without the heavy use of trekking poles, I was concerned as the next phase was the 100 Mile Wilderness. Eventually made it to Abol Bridge, 12 miles in about 5.5 hours, ate a hamburger. I decided to take a break and head into Millinocket ER and have it looked at, no reasons to press on and risk serious injury that could lead to an assisted rescue. Never want that!Doc at ER took x-rays and said they looked good but I was probably suffering from a torn meniscus which would be several, 3-4 days or weeks to heal. I found a room at the AT Lodge and decided to hole up there for a few days to see what transpired. Met Ole Man and Karla, who were very kind and a pleasure to be around.","BSP

Papa Bear Zeke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544612,"Well, after waiting in Millinocket, ME at the AT Lodge for 5 days and a couple of unsuccessful trial runs, I am headed home to Little Rock not knowing how long recovery will take or really the extent of the injury. I am so bummed about this, all the planning and energy spent talking, packing, repacking, listening, planning, re-planning, etc. I guess it just wasn't meant to be at this time. I will go home, lick my wounds, spend time with family, re-plan and be back next year. It may be over now, but I am not finished.",,"Little Rock, AR","Jul 06, Wed",0
Papa Bear Zeke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544602,"Well, as with all good plans, things change. After a great day hiking Katahdin and a minor slip on the way down, I awoke the next day to head south and made it to Abol Bridge Campground where I decided to have my knee evaluated after a painful day, especially when climbing up or down, which is basically all one does, right
Diagnosis was torn meniscus, right knee, and after resting for 5 days at the AT Lodge and a couple of trial runs around town, I decided to return to Little Rock to have it checked further. Orhto doc here said patella tendonitis, Stage 3 and possible torn meniscus, three weeks rest and anti-inflammatories. Was released back to full operations yesterday so, now I wait, work, and re-plan. 
I hindsight I guess this wasn't the best time as my dad passed on 15 June, my original date of departure and some other life events. I was being selfish and doing what I wanted when I should have probably stayed here and been close to the family for a while. 
Rescheduled for June 2017. In the famous words of Gen MacArthur, I shall return.
