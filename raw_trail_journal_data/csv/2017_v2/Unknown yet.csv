Unknown yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560786,Well it's been over a month since I had to leave the AT with an injured calf.   I've been diligent on rest and rehab and I feel I'm ready to get back on the trail. My dream of an entire thru hike in one season has been rethought. I'll try to accomplish it in three years and this year will take me from Duncannon to Bennington Vt. Hopefully my calf will hold up for the trip and maybe illl run into some of the hikers I left in NC. That would be cool!!!   God has taken care of me during the injury and getting home to my family which He revealed to me is the most important thing in this world. More to come when I start back on May 8th. Peace,"Duncannon

Unknown yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555646,It's hard to. Eli eve this trail magic. Groups come out and cook hot dogs hamburgers and drinks and soup and fruit and cookies. I might just gain some weight if it keeps up. I'm just 8 miles from the North Carolina border. That's where the big mountains are as if these mts were t tough. It's all up or down but it is some of the most breathtaking views. I'm tired and hungry and I've got a few more miles to go. I just missed Lance Armstrong and all of the American riders. Threir Doing an off road trail ride.   Kendrik should see these bikes $25000 and up for mountain bikes. Peace,"georgia

Unknown yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555879,"It is with a sad heart that I post this today. Just after crossing into North Carolina I slipped on a rock and felt something odd. No big deal as I usually trip or fall several times a day , it comes with the territory. But I gathered myself and continued on another 8 miles to the Standing Indian shelter. My plan was to do a long day and hunker down there from the impending storm that was forecast ( it didn't disappoint and anyone who knows me knows my dislike for shelters). But since a tree fell on my tent the first night in another heavy storm , I was not going to temp fait again.    I was getting ready for dinner and I noticed my calf was very tight and hot to the touch. I thought maybe I had an infected blood blister on my heal and it was acting up.   It the next morning after a restless night ( howling winds , rain pelting the tin roof and 8 people snoring , sleep was at best not much) my leg wS now ridged and hot from the knee down .    There was a paramedic from Idaho hiking and she looked at and advised me to get the heck out of there.   So I made it over Standing Indian mt(5347)and down to a gap where I took a forestry road another 7 mikes to the main road. All the while in a driving , cold storm.    I got a ride into Franklin where I went to the ER. Since I had a blood clot last year they did a lot of testing and determined it was not a clot!!!   However they found that I had torn a muscle ( tibialis posterior) which hurts when you push off ( like stepping up).   The Dr./Surgeon advised rest and no stressful activity for a while. So for now I'm putting this trek on hold until I heal up and then I'll tackle the trail again only in shorter peices. It hurts to call it off so early but I know God has a plan for everything. I have so many stories to tell about the short week I spent out hear and I will miss the friends I made along the AT.    So for now I bid you farewell. Peace","georgia

Unknown yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556484,"Its been over a week since I had to leave the AT with a calf injury. I keep playing the events of the injury over and over again but it was just an unfortunate slip. The short time that I was out on the AT was nothing short of magical. All of the people I met along the way were just special for that brief time. My local orthopedic surgeon conducted a thorough examination and the Doppler ruled out blood clots. So I'm resting ,elevating and stretching the calf. It's new territory for me as I was always able to bounce back rather quickly    So I'll take my time and get it back to 100% before deciding which part of the AT I'll tackle this year.    So I'm home watching the snow piling up to three feet in the last couple of days wondering how everyone is dealing with the winter storm on the AT. Thank you for all of your notes of encouragement and prayers through this. I'm coming back for sure. Peace","georgia

Unknown yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557565,I'm doing my daily rehab stretches and resting the calf as much as I can. My goal is to get back to 100% by mid May and return to the AT in Pennsylvania. For 3 weeks or a month. Hopefully I can get into Connecticut. It looks like finishing the entire AT will not happen this year. It would be cool if I could meet up with the hikers that I was with in Georgia and I think I'll have the timing right to see them inPa.   We will see how I progress. I miss it and can't wait to get back. Peace,"georgis

Unknown yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563839,I'm putting in a long day as the trail is nice and flat.  I've met 7 section hikers that started in Harpers Ferry.  No thru hikers are this far north.  I've heard that 80% of the hikers from Georgia have dropped out.

Unknown yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564327,I was on the trail by 6:15 to get a jump on a pretty tough day. The trail was up and over lots of huge rocks most of the day. The views were great but it was slow going. I hoped to make a shelter at Mike 17 but it was full in anticipation of the heavy rain coming. So I'm tenting just above the Lehigh tunnel. I can hear the traffic eat up here. I'm dry for now but tomorrow is going to be a wet one. Peace,"Rockville shelter

Its so good to be back in my home state with great friends. I needed a brake to give my legs some relief and gain back a few pounds. Still love these Pennsylvania Rocks!!!

Unknown yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564581,It is good to have a rest day and great to hike a few miles with my friend Phil. He introduced me to backpacking almost 40 years ago. Surprisingly we only saw one thruhiker today ( Mrs Joy) but the views from Wolf Rocks were breathtaking just after a brief shower came through mid afternoon. I want to give a big shout out to my loving wife Judy who is back home celebrating Mothers Day with my son Adam and his family. God gave me that special lady and I miss her. Tomorrow I cross into New Jersey and out of the Pennsylvania rocks. Peace,"Danielsville

Unknown yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564881,New Jersey has been interesting for the first 30 miles. I saw my first snakes (water and black snakes no rattlers yet) and some deer early this morning but no bears! The locals tell me that the best chance for bears is in the next day or so. I climbed my first fire tower and could see a long distance back towards Pennsylvania and into New York. The best part of the day was meeting a local hiking group that shared their macaroons dipped in chocolate. From that point on I was on cloud nine! Peace,"Mohican Center
