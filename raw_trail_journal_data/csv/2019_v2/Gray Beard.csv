Gray Beard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583359,"Lots of things yet to tie up before I start the trail.  Time is going by quickly.We have bought a new 5th wheel trailer and a new truck.  My wife and I are trying out the trailer as I finish work here in Savannah.  17 more days and a wake up and we will be headed back to Texas to take care of things there.  Going to miss all the friends I have met here.We have been hiking here in coastal Georgia but it's all flat ground.  When I get back to Texas I plan to catch up with a couple of my old hiking buddies to catch some hills.  It worked well when I prepared for my last Philmont trek in 2013.  I know I won't be ready to hike 20+ mile days when I hit the trail in Connecticut but that was one of the reasons to start there, mild elevation changes.  Start out with short distances and work my way up.  As everyone says ""hike your own hike""  And besides I'm somewhat retired...Without support from my wife Sandy and my family, this hike would not be possible.",,View Entry,"Feb 26, Mon",0
Gray Beard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584472,"So what do you call a happy person on Monday...Retired.We made it safely back to Texas.  Getting everything ready to leave in April and head to the trail.  Lots to do and a short time to get it done.Spent the entire day getting the Garmin PLB (Personal Locating Beacon) figured out and configured to the computer and cell phone.  Gives my wife peace of mind knowing where I am on the trail and ability to communicate with her.Need to get more hiking in for the next three weeks, up and down hills, to get ready.  Didn't have any hills in coastal Georgia so only got mileage there with some bike riding.",,View Entry,"Mar 19, Mon",0
Gray Beard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585056,"Due to a medical procedure I need to complete prior to the hike, I will be starting the walk in the woods on June 4th in lieu of April 15th.  As I always told my Scouts, the plans are in pencil so they can be changed.  Flexibility.We were planning to come back to Texas in late May for my oldest granddaughter Morgan's graduation.  My second oldest granddaughter, Tara, has decided she wants to come along with us on the trail this summer.  She is wanting to hike some of the trail with me.  My wife will get her back to Texas when I do the ""hundred mile wilderness"" in Maine
I will start in Connecticut going South on June 4th but with the same plan as before.  Just won't get as far south as I would've hoped.  I don't know if I will be able to finish all of it in 2018 as it gets pretty cold in October in Tennessee, North Carolina and Georgia.  I've hiked part of the trail near Erwin Tennessee in early October and it was cold starting off in the morning.  The earliest I can finish will be in November.  But then again I am RETIRED and if I can't finish the hike before it gets too cold this year, I can finish it next spring.  As long as I get it done within a 12 month period, it's considered a ""thru hike.""
This delay give me more of a chance at the recovery period and I can hike my hills in Texas to prepare for the hike.  And it gives me a chance to get my granddaughter ready for hiking part of the time with me.",,View Entry,"Mar 27, Tue",0
Gray Beard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586286,"I have been trying to get as much hiking in as I can.  But it never seems to be enough time to get in my mileage and hills I think I need.  Between illness, working at the farm and getting to the doctor’s appointments and testing has been taking time.  And some tests are finding other things to test for.  I am still planning on starting June 4th.
I’ve been monitoring the weather and it has been a cold and snowy spring along the trail in New England. Salisbury, Ct. is 30F and still getting snow!!!  Since I will be missing my April 15th start and will be starting June 4th, hopefully, I will be missing the weather (and snow shoes or micro-spikes won’t be needed.
It has been nice getting to Cameron Park in Waco, Texas and hiking some of the 20 miles of trails.  The trails were set up for off road bikers so there is a lot of ups and downs which are perfect for preparing for the AT.  I haven’t made it up to the Dallas Off Road Bikes Association (DOBRA) Big Cedar Trials in Duncanville.  When I was last there 5 years ago, they had about 25 miles of trail of various difficulty.  But I am looking forward to them.
My medical test and appointment has been cancelled today so I have an excuse to go hiking.  Keep me in your thoughts and prayers.",,View Entry,"Apr 10, Tue",0
Gray Beard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/588153,"Okay to catch up.  I have been still hiking about every other day while waiting for the tests and doctor’s appointment. I got a picture of an 18 inch Northern Copperhead snake we saw on the trail in Waxahachie and as soon as I can figure out the picture function of the Journal I will post it.  Just a reminder to keep my eyes open when I hike.
Last week I went to the cardiologist and he said my heart was in excellent shape for the surgery.  After my colonoscopy, I had a session of PVCs and the doctors were concerned.  It was most likely caused by low potassium from the fasting before the procedure per the doctor and was nothing to be alarmed about.  He will be there during the surgery just in case.  He liked my hiking activities.
We went to the cancer doctor yesterday to review the results of the PET scan.  The scan showed a 90% chance of cancer in the upper lobe of my right lung.  No other things showed up so there is a 94% that it is only stage 1.  So we scheduled a surgery date of 11 May.  He will be doing minimally invasive surgery using a robot to minimize the size of the incisions.  I will be in the hospital for 2 - 3 days.  I will have an appointment the following Friday to ensure I am good to travel.
The total healing takes 3 - 6 months.  Initially I will have 80% lung capacity but will eventually get back up to 90%.  But he said I would be able to hike as best I feel I can.  Initially he said I would have shortness of breath and may need to take a nap during the day and a break climbing hills.  I told him I had planned to take a short power nap each day so now I would have an excuse.  He said my lungs were in good shape despite my smoking and was likely due to my active lifestyle.
Sandy’s mother is not doing well so we will be going to St. Petersburg Florida tomorrow to see her before the surgery.  Not many hills in that area to hike but will continue hiking down there.
So if all goes to plan we will be still leaving Memorial Day weekend.  If I start in Salisbury Ct, the first hike would be 8 miles with an 900 foot ascent and 1000 foot decent with no exit points along the trail.  I'll have to see how I am doing at that time but I may start on a little shorter distance days until I can hike longer.  I just need to listen to my body..",,View Entry,"Apr 27, Fri",0
Gray Beard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590687,"I made it through the surgery Friday and everything was successful.  The surgeon said he pretty sure it was cancer but has sent it to a Pathologist to verify.  The cancer, if there, had not spread lymph nodes so no chemo or radiation treatments needed, Stage 1 at most.  But wow that was quite a pain.  We just got out of the hospital on Monday.
Now I need to finish up with the doctors on Friday and next Tuesday for the post-surgery side to make sure everyone agrees.  But all the doctors I’ve seen has been supportive of the hike.  Just have to listen to them and to what the body is telling me.  “Hike my own hike.”  My normal hiking pace is 3.6 mph for flat ground and 2.1 mph in the hills.  Probably starting out slow but that’s okay, good lord a willing and I’ll get it done.  If not we’ll have to see what he has planned for us.
I did get a good hike in today finally.  I have to carry my cough pillow when I hike right now.  Taking a deep breath, coughing, burping, hiccupping and laughing REALLY hurts.  Holding it against the incision helps dull the pain.  We have about a week and a half before we leave for the trail.  So hopefully I will be able to regain some of my strength before we get there.",,View Entry,"May 16, Wed",0
Gray Beard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591725,"The recovery from the surgery to remove the upper portion of my right lung is not going as I was hoping.   The surgeon used minimally invasive robotic surgery using four small incisions to help quicken the recovery.  The lungs are clear, no infection and the hiking is doing okay.  But I am not able to get the mileage I was expecting and needing to get at this point in time.  So after discussing with my wife, we are going switch our plans. 
  
We will be going west this summer for about 2 months.  We are looking at the going to some of the National Parks.  There will be lots of opportunities for good hiking as I recuperate.
Next year we will do the same as was initially planned except we will watch the weather and may start off further south, as required.I will check in from time to time to up-date as I can.",,View Entry,"May 24, Thu",0
Gray Beard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618355,"I will start the trail tomorrow.  Been a busy year waiting for this time to get here.  Not a lot of pre-hike training like I would have wanted, but then I plan to start out with short distances until I can work my way up to get my ""trail legs.""",,View Entry,"Jul 08, Mon",0
