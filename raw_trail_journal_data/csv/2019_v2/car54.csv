car54,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576686,"Well the planning has officially began.  I know I'm early but have already made reservations for my first 3 lodging places in Georgia for 2019.  Since I'm traveling with Peaches I wanted to make sure we had someplace to stay that allowed dogs.  I have also started sorting out the maildrop boxes.  My basement is full of 41 boxes and supplies.  I have constructed a monthly buy list so it won't be such a financial burden at the end.  Now on my list of planning is to send the last clothing items to insect shield to be treated, retire (253 more days), lose weight, get Peaches in trail shape, and finish off loading maildrop boxes.  What a list!!!!",,View Entry,"Sep 01, Fri",0
car54,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/600165,"Well Peaches and I have been walking about 4 to 6 miles each morning.  Boy am I glad we decided to do this.  I think everyday I have made a change to our packs.  I'm dialing in our weight and how we carry it.  At first I decided that Peaches would carry  5 days of her food.  When we started walking up hills she was having a hard time with it, so I dropped her down to 4.  I think this will help her out.  She is in seventh heaven when I get her halter out.  Food supplies are almost all bought and put in boxes.  I have also decided to mail all our food, instead of shopping for some in town.  I just don't see Peaches doing well tied up outside a store or left alone in a hotel room while I shop.  Getting really excited about starting.",,View Entry,"Aug 12, Sun",0
car54,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607029,Well only 1 week till we leave for Georgia.  I have been watching several vloggers on you tube that are already on the trail.  Thats been fun.  I have decided to bring a little video camera that fits in the palm of my hand.  Boy has technology changed since I was a kid.  My only problem is trying to send the videos as attachments.  But Im working on that.  Peaches is ready to go......,,View Entry,"Feb 13, Wed",0
car54,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607239,"Well today is the day.  I have gotten a extremely short hair cut (maybe too short for my liking), pack is packed, car is packed.  Peaches has been ready to roll (she says she will believe it when we get there).More from the trail",,View Entry,"Feb 21, Thu",0
