Science!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607688,"At the behest of my dear mother I am writing my first trail entry. I will finally be setting out on the Appalachian Trail this Saturday March 10th Northbound from Springer Mountain, Georgia. I have wanted to thru-hike this trail for years and continually put it off for various reasons, but I now have an opportunity to start, so I’m gonna go till I run out of time or run out of money.
I got my last piece of gear today. Gloves. I’ve been checking the weather for the past few weeks and it looks like it’s gonna be cold and wet for the first few weeks (freeze warnings), so I’ll be carrying a bit more weight in gear than usual to combat this so I can stay warm and dry. I’m expecting it to be a pretty miserable start, but I’m a bit masochistic so it’s all good.
I’ve spent the last week unpacking and repacking my gear, scrutinizing ounces. What do I really need? I mean, hypothermia is a real concern, so maybe one more pair of socks? Can you pack too much hot chocolate? Am I really gonna eat that much? Yeah, more socks. Wool. Cook pot and a cup? How long will this fuel canister last? Man, I hope my trail name sounds cool. Is this my chance to finally be the Yellow Power Ranger? Do plants fave feelings? Hopefully, I’ll be able to answer all these questions and more.
Honestly, I have no idea how this is gonna go down, but I did promise to document this journey so that everyone has an equal opportunity to poke fun at my silliness. 
Because that’s the polite thing to do.
So if anyone has any questions for me along the way, feel free to ask and you will receive my dorky stream-of-consciousness response with as much love as possible.",,The North,"Mar 07, Thu",0

Science!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608091,"Thank you to all for your well wishes!! It’s greatly appreciated and needed. 
So the drive up was treacherous to say the least. I don’t think either one of us truly appreciated until we had been at it for 45 minutes. Thank goodness for an suv with 4 wheel drive
Then the mile long hike to the starting point was just as bad. Water-logged, slick, up and down. Trekking poles definitely saved my neck a few times there.
The other 8 miles were relatively smooth, but super muddy, and even that little bit took plenty out of me.
Getting to Hawk Mountain Shelter was relatively uneventful and having my first hot dinner of the hike was the bomb! But, just as I was finishing and comparing my stove with everyone else’s, we heard heard this scream and saw a huge fire right in front of a tent. So I bolted to move the tent out of the way, only to find that there was a woman still inside that couldn’t get up. Luckily about a dozen folks came in a few secs with water to put it out (I had just used up all my water on the meal and honestly didn’t even think about it), so that was an interesting end to the day.
PSA-1: Most tents, tarps and sleeping bags are made from highly flammable materials. Do not cook in your tent or vestibule! Also, be aware if there are any fire bans in the area that you are staying.
PSA-2: When using a gas canister stove. Ensure that the valve is fully closed then screw on the stove until it stops turning. When both are secured, crack open the valve and light it. Adjust valve for flame height.
Day 2 went by pretty slowly. Got my feet wet with all the mud and crossing a stream. Passed tons of day hikers. And got the last little spot to set up my tent. The rest of the day was for relaxing, refueling and eventually going to sleep at Hiker Midnight (9pm).
Day 3 was able to start out around 9 am to a lovely day of relatively smooth trails. My shoes hadn’t dried out over night, so that was no fun, but I eventually warmed up so that it wasn’t so much of a bother. A few hours in the sun was up and I pulled over, pulled off all the wet things and had a little lunch whilst things dried. Had a lovely next few hours and made it early to a campground called Lance Creek with a retired couple and found a swanky little spot with a fire-pit and a view around 4:00 where we all decided to stop early for the day. 
Day 4 ended up being straight up to Blood Mountain and straight down to Neels Gap. Trekking poles definitely saved my knees there. I took that journey crazy slow too, but by the time I got to Mountain Crossing, I was ready for a shower and a bed.
On the way up the mountain I ran into a retired dude who mentioned he was going to be renting a cabin for a few days and had already split it with a chick from Long Island who was about my age. Sounded perfect! So we picked up another guy on the deal and the four of us are sleeping in a warm and dry cabin. I’m up early writing this. Sitting on a futon, really wanting to make coffee, but not make too much noise and wake folks up. The weather outside is just junky right now and meant to start thunderstorms soon, so I’m thinking to stay one more night to avoid the weather. I’ll make up the miles later.
Update: Day 5 I decided to stay one more day in the cabin with the three other folks splitting the cost ($18/day for each). We went to town, had an all-you-can-eat lunch at a place called FATZ then went down to the Ingles to resupply on food and such. Pretty confident I’m packing too much still, but I’ll dial it down. We all decided that we are gonna set out early tomorrow for the 10-ish mile hike to Low Gap Shelter and are just playing everything by ear.","Springer Mountain

Science!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609184,"First of, my apologies for not writing more frequently. When I started with this blogging idea I had it in my head that I would get up early in the day, walk 8-12 miles and by mid afternoon be at my next shelter or campground with a warm cappuccino nestled in my hand whilst I watched the squirrels frolic across the lawn chasing acorns or something cute like that while I scribbled away sweet nothings and amusing life anecdotes about this ridiculously long walk I’ve been on. Sadly, there have been zero cappuccinos and I regret to say only one squirrel that have entered my life so far.
The truth is, it’s been cold and I’ve been lazy. The first two weeks the night temps were dipping down in the 30s and there were definitely a few that got down to 15. Now on paper, I knew this would be the case. I checked the weather reports, I knew what was forecasted. However, I didn’t truly appreciate the fact that in temps below 50 with a wind chill I can’t feel my hands. Imagine holding a pen or attempting to type with digits you can’t actually feel. Your eyes see them. Your brain and muscles recall the action, but the simple motion of selecting one character after another without the tactile feedback is simply exhausting. 
So instead I would hide in my mostly warm sleeping bag, shiver, and think of hot tubs until my hands and feet moved past the numb stage, into that weird painful stage when your nerves are active again and finally, (hopefully) into a feeling of warmth and normalcy. 
So what did I do when I stopped hiking and got into camp? I find a spot to pitch my tent, being particularly cautious of dangerously dangling and deadly branches (cause,,, that almost happened that one time). Then I unpack my bag (I keep the tent strapped to the top of the pack), food bag out, clothes and electronics dispersed for later recharging, then inflate my pad, fluff my sleeping bag and close everything off to trap as much warmth in there as possible. Then once my home is successfully erected then I grab my food bag, cook kit inside and find a campfire or table or other communal type area where folks are gathered, eating and drinking, and likely recanting similar stories of woe. Some faces are familiar, sometimes not. Sometimes you just rock up to a campfire, skip introductions entirely, occasionally interject comments to the discussion whilst cooking your only warm meals until a long enough awkward pause comes along so that you can say “Hi, I’m Anna! ?” even though you had already been sitting and chatting for like an hour already. By that time, it’s almost dark, you’ve been still for too long and are getting cold again and your bedtime is a cool 8:30pm.
If I was fortunate that day, I would have been able to find a nice clear, flat spot to set up my tent, I would have oriented it to have minimal wind resistance and positioned it far enough away from other hikers who are noisy sleepers. This one guy I hiked with the first week got the trail name “Rocket” because he literally sounded like that T minus countdown you hear when NASA’s about to launch a satellite into outer space. He since has taken it upon himself to provide earplugs to anyone in need. He’s sweet.
Where was I? Oh, yeah, it’s cold.
Anywho, so in real life I’m not of the inclination to leap out of bed and be at work 30 minutes later. No I usually get up at least an hour and a half before I need to leave the house because I like to wake up slowly. So naturally that’s apparently what I do on the trail as well. So I may wake up at 7:30, but it’s cold! So I’m gonna hide in my tent for another 2 hours. So I don’t even leave camp until the sun is proud and out and warming up the place, which means I’m usually the last one out. 
So once I’m packed up and moving home to the next spot, I’ll toss a few instant coffee packets into my water bottle and just pretend it’s cold brew and fancy (it’s not, instant is not cold brew). Then, the next 6 to 8 hours are pretty much just going uphill and down hill. Putting layers on and taking layers off. Trying not to trip over everything on the trail because the whole thing is a hazard, so learning to move slowly. Be the ninja. Stopping the top off the water (remember to filter, no one wants giardia). Maybe it’s a known stream, or a trickle coming off a rock, it might just be a gutter on the side of a forest road, I did that once. Point is, stay hydrated. Then just carry on walking, try to enjoy the scenery without forgetting that you need to not fall off this mountain because you were distracted by a cool tree and missed the fact that the trail is now a muddy slip-n-slide that’s only a foot wide. 
So now you know how to hike the trail. Move fast enough to stay warm, slow enough to not die, drink clean water, check out sweet rocks and remember to stop and chitchat. Also, food, bring enough food. I’m currently packing way too much food because for some jank reason, I still haven’t figured out how much I actually eat in a day. So I’m carrying more weight there. I’m also now carrying an iPad to write and edit videos with because my sad phone tells me no every single time I try to make videos on that thing. 
Which brings me to my next and last point, I will likely be doing more videos and less writing in this journal, simply for the ease of it. However, if I’m ever stopped in a town, like today where I can sit at a picnic table and type my ramblings whilst trying not to strangle an excessively energetic woodpecker, then I will write a proper post. Otherwise, I will be uploading links to YouTube videos that I have posted. So let me know what you think of all that.
Also, please disregard where it says today’s miles. I’m not gonna keep track of each day, but I will go ahead and update my position when I make a post.

Science!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609990,"So,,,, it’s been a while since I’ve written. My bad. For those who are interested, I’m technically at mile 165 on the Trail which would place me right before Fontana Dam. But technically-technically, I’m sitting at a Dunkin’ Donuts in Paducah, KY writing this with a large americano and dunkin’ trainees to keep me company. 
But Anna! The Appalachian Trail is not in western Kentucky! ?!!  Right. No, that’s true, but hear me out, ok? About ten days ago, the day I got out of the NOC, which I am now calling a day of ridiculousness (here’s the video link: https://youtu.be/RLEv_7dFy3I), I did a slip and slide off the mountain due to precarious slippery rocks, and in my graceful athleticism (that’s a lie) I rolled and did something to my foot. Something that caused me to hobble the rest of the 6 miles I had that day. Something that made me feel decades older than I physically am. Something that’s actually still kind of bothering me still. 
That trail that never seemed to end. But I made it to the next roadway checkpoint at Stecoah Gap (just after promptly slipping down the mountain one more time, for good measure) and got picked up and taken to this amazing home tucked into the middle of nowhere for a lovely hot shower (with shampoo and conditioner!! Cue angelic choirs singing in the background...). It was a B&B called Creekside Paradise. The owners were so welcoming and practical. They provided great company and care, excellent conversation, and a very welcome warm breakfast (breakfast isn’t something that I normally even do). Must love dogs though as they have 4 hounds who are adorable. 
I took a zero the next day, just so I could sort out how bad my foot was. I had met up with another hiker that day that knew and we both decided to ‘slack-pack’ from Stecoah Gap to Fontana Dam which I think is about 15 miles. ‘Slack-packing’ describes the instance when a hiker gets someone to look after their primary backpack while they hike with the bare minimum in drink and snacks needed for that day, then when they finish, they can pick their pack up for the night. So I got one of my stuff sacks, tied some rope around the top to make an over-shoulder pack with a bottle of water, rain gear and a bag of trail mix and headed out. We hiked from 8 to about 5:30 and by the end, my feet were definitely sore!  Even though I was only carrying about 3 pounds instead of the 30-ish pounds I had been huffing. 
So that night, I decided to take about a week off. Now, a few days prior I had heard about a conference for work in Antarctica in Denver, Colorado. At the time, I had planned on getting into the Smokies and leaving from Gatlinburg and flying out to Denver for a side trip. However, after I figured out it would take me about five days to get to that point in the Smokies and the conference was in four days I decided to just go ahead and rent a car, drive out to Denver, do a little cross country, and it’s been a whole lotta fun.
So I went to the place, located in the very luxurious Arapaho’s County DMV Boardroom. I’m not sure if they just don’t like to do a lot of advertising as I only found out about it from a friend, but when I showed up there was only like eight people there. It wasn’t quite what I had expected it to be (the word conference generally evokes images of large arenas, packed with thousands of people scouring various booths for the best swag and news on the latest gear), but it was not that. I would really call it more of a lecture/job fair. I did end up having a good chitchat with the hiring agents there and they told me that once I am ready to go start working that I should apply for all of the positions and they’ll definitely get me in there. But, since I recently signed a contract for another job, that’s going to keep me busy for about two years. So directly after that experience, my head filled with thoughts of another grand adventure, I booked it to the REI flagship store (because you gots to!) 
That place was ginormous (three stories and had a Starbucks inside) and I spent literally 3 hours trawling through the shelves and racks ogling at all the gear that I definitely did not need, but totally wanted. Like a totally awesome snowboard in this cool blue and yellow tropical design! Do I know how to snowboard? Absolutely not, neither do I sports in any way, but it was on sale and I would look totally rad zipping down a hill!! But,,, seeing as how I can’t seem to stay upright whilst walking down a hill, I decided to hold off a bit until I’ve leveled up enough for that. So, after stalking gear for eons and having bought precisely nothing, it was time to go outside and be a true hipster, rent an electric standing scooter, zip around downtown (mentally laughing at all the poor schmucks in cars looking for parking) and buy more artisanal coffee!?
Wow, this story is getting rather long-winded. Ok, shortening it. I had kind of determined that I might have some form or variation of plantar fasciitis or some tight Achilles tendon going on because the last couple of days when I’d get up in the morning to stand up for the first time I almost fell over because my feet did not want to do their job. So,,, that’s not really encouraging to me... I did go on a day hike in the Rockies near Boulder. It’s still the mountains!, just the wrong ones. That hike was still mildly uncomfortable which tells me I’m gonna need to monitor this for a while. ? I did go ahead and buy some kinesiology tape and trussed up both feet for good measure, it seems to be helping.
Anywho, I went to the botanical gardens and aquarium, ran into some bunnies, drove through Nebraska, saw a bunch of flat nothingness, saw a ton of groundhogs on the side of the road, jammed out for 8 hours to the weirdest mix of Flogging Molly, P!nk, Broadway show-tunes, and Dolly Parton, (actually, it was kind of excellent), and I’m gonna be ending up on the trail tomorrow, hopefully, to make the journey through the Smokies.Hopefully the next few weeks will be rather uneventful and I will be more vigilant at staying on the trail ??‍♀️.I will try to write more, but I’m doing videos too, so check those out.I did not proof read this, it is shear rambling. Sorry, but not sorry.Laters,","

Science!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610184,"So it’s day two of getting back on the trail from Fontana Dam. I decided to do a 7 mile day only, partly because my feet are still angry and partly because I didn’t even get on the trail until about 1:30 yesterday. But I actually made it to camp a lot quicker than I thought I would around 5:30 at a place called Birch Spring Tentsite. It’s exactly as it sounds, not a shelter, but a plot of land around a gorgeous spring where areas have been patted out for folks to pitch tents. Now that we are in the Smokies, protected land, the places you are allowed to stop for the night are highly regulated. So only official campgrounds or shelters are allowed, no stealth camping. I was a bit worried that the site would be closed though. In the last week, ridgerunners have been closing shelters and campsites due to bear activity and kicking people out and pushing them along. Which is really janking if it’s the end of the day, you’ve already walked 14 miles and the next permissible site is another 7 miles away. What happens if you just refuse?
Anyways, yesterday was actually hot!! I was both excited and frustrated with this because on the one hand I could go slow without getting cold, but I was also sweating, something I had successfully avoided up until now. I laid my clothes out in the hopes that they would dry, but alas I woke up this morning to shirt, socks and bra that were wet. Yay humidity ?. But you gotta just suck it up and carry on.
Today was actually a great day though, a lot of little ground coverage flowers are in bloom and it almost looks like snow with how white and scattered it is. I stopped for lunch by this little spring and stayed there for an hour at least (which is weird, because if I do stop in the middle of the day it’s usually only for a few minutes), but this little place was gorgeous and I tried to sun a bit to fix the ridiculous tan lines I have on my arms from yesterday. 
My feet didn’t actually start bothering me until mile 8 of 11 today, so not too bad. I’m in my tent about to get into storm mode because it’s supposed to start pouring down tonight and continue for the next 5 days, which is probably the amount of time I’ll be in the Smoky’s. This will be the true test for my tent since it hasn’t really had to be in the rain yet. ??‍♀️ so that’s gonna be interesting. I mean, I actually enjoy walking in the rain, just not feeling sleeping in the rain. Plus my sleeping bag is down, so if that gets wet it not only takes ages to dry, but it becomes totally useless as it won’t insulate. The folks in the shelter did offer to squeeze in in the middle of the night if things go sideways, but I really don’t feel like sardining tonight. 
Ok, it’s getting blustery! Gotta go!","

Science!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614788,"So, once again, I need to apologize for my failure to keep up with posting. It is due in part to laziness, because  I honestly never felt like I had the time in the day to write, and also due to the fact that Sprint! sucks and I went 3 weeks straight with basically zero cellular service. By the time I posted this I had made it 600 miles and completed my hike just outside of Bland, VA. Now before you all freak out, wait... I was always doing a long section hike, but I figured if I had the time that I would just keep going, but I got responsibilities and needed to stop when I did, just before trail days. The following posts below are what I had intended on posting earlier, but never made it. So, hopefully it’s in some sort of chronological order that makes sense.—————Directly after last post:
So that was a weird night. The wind was insane and at one point almost picked my tent up with me in it. It was so noisy and I was a bit worried that a branch or whole tree was gonna come down on top of me that I didn’t really sleep at all that night. Also the only place available to pitch a tent wasn’t exactly level, so the blood was rushing to my feet when I laid down which was not great for my comfort level. Plus, waking up to a rainy morning wasn’t awesome, neither was packing up wet gear. Also neither was walking through a ravine for the first four hours of the day!
It didn’t seem like it had rained that much, but by 8:30 when I set out, the Appalachian trail had turned into an ankle deep river!! Up and down! For four hours!!!  On loose rocks. I was not happy. Up until then I had successfully been able to keep my feet mostly dry, but that just wasn’t happening. So as I was walking and trying not to get washed away (or blown away from the 50 mph wind gusts) all I could think of is I really don’t want trench foot!
It was at that point I decided that I was just gonna stop at the first shelter 7 mile in instead of going to the next one which I had planned and dry out all my gear and myself. That’s where I ran into Brother Bear and Tree-talker who had been there from earlier in the day and also had a super junky morning, then mentioned they were just stopping there for the day and that was what did it for me. We found out that day that it was gonna be crazy stormy on Sunday so the plan was to book it out to Clingmans Dome the next day and hitch a ride to Gatlinburg to wait out the storm.
We ended up getting out of the shelter about 2 hours later than planned because we couldn’t stop talking and drinking coffee. What we walked through was a fairy tale forest and reminded me distinctly of the background panels of the Sleeping Beauty cartoon. It was gorgeous!! When we did make it to Clingmans it was right around 4:30 and officially decided to book a room for two nights to wait out the storm. Come to find out, not much later park rangers were kicking people off of the mountain because of the super high winds pushing folks off and freezing rain. So we sat in the parking lot for a while trying to figure out how to get down whilst being angry at the fact that we had no service, so couldn’t actually call a hotel. 
Our rescue came in the form of a flatbed truck packed with some locals who had just come up to the mountain to view the scenery. The bed had an old gas station sign strapped to it, but the driver said so long as we didn’t scratch his sign he’d let us sit on top and take us on the 45 minute trip down to Gatlinburg. So we gingerly climbed aboard, careful to stay on the enforced edges of the sign and laid our packs in between the three of us. It was excellent! They went super slow while we gripped our packs with one hand and the back of the truck with the other, as there were no sides. Moving in time with the turns, we occasionally waved to passing cars and tourists who for sure thought that we were outside of our minds whilst we dreamed about what we would get at the Golden Chorale buffet that wasn’t actually in town, but we all thought it was. The truck dropped us off at the edge of town and like full on idiots we all hopped off the bed, forgetting that our feet would be crazy sore, and regretted it immediately.
Gatlinburg was expensive and kind of sucked. Broke my spoon so bought a McFlurry and used the spoon from that. Thinking maybe I just need to pony up and buy a durable one. I still have my chopsticks though, so that helps.

But before all that happened I decided to take that side trip to drive out to Denver:
So,,,, it’s been a while since I’ve written. My bad. For those who are interested, I’m technically at mile 165 on the Trail which would place me right before Fontana Dam. But technically-technically, I’m sitting at a Dunkin’ Donuts in Paducah, KY writing this with a large americano and dunkin’ trainees to keep me company.

—————
So the Smoky’s are gorgeous, definitely a place to visit. The only problem is that because the conservancy is trying to conserve the land that means that everyone is forced to stay at approved shelters and nowhere else in the park. That means that dozens and dozens of hikers are crammed into shelters and campgrounds and forced to make due with being packed in. So what happens when people are sardined together in already less than sanitary conditions? Yes, noravirus, you guessed it! 
On that last night leaving the Smoky’s I tented with a small group of people in this campground about a mile north of Standing Bear Farm, just to try to stay out of the crowds. It had been a lovely, green and fast moving day. I actually jogged the last 7 miles that day as it was all downhill. That became my new thing, jogging the downs. I call it gravity-assisted hiking. I’m kind of short, so it helps me keep up with the taller folks.
Anywho, I had woken up at about 10:30 that night in my tent with the sudden violent urge to vomit and briefly considered the consequences of the ease of simply opening my vestibule and puking right there. But as I was in a tent site that was surrounded by a creek I knew I would feel even worse about breaking Leave No Trace rules. So I grabbed my headlamp, stumbled out of my tent, brushing up against all sorts of poison ivy (anecdotally, I’m pretty sure I’m immune to poison ivy as I know for a fact that I have come into contact with it many dozens of times and had no problems). I made it literally to the other side of the AT where I proceeded to vomit all along the side of the trail for an hour. Once I had nothing left I started digging and did the best I could to bury the evidence of my shame. 
It was after midnight by the time I had cleaned up as much as I could and drug my sorry but back to my tent to try to get some rest. But it didn’t come. See, it decided to start pouring down that night and I promptly learned that there was a leak in the seams of my tent that proceeding to tart soaking my gear. So, with nothing left inside me, cold rain outside and now the potential for wet gear, I packed all my gear up inside my tent and put on my Frogg Toggs to wait it out till the morning when the rest of the group were getting up to get a shuttle to the nearest hostel. 
By the time we were all up an on our way, I went ahead and let the group know that I wasn’t well. That’s when I learned that the two other girls in the group were starting to feel ill also. So we finally got to out check point and got that shuttle that drove us the whole mile to the hostel. The driver was very confused by that. Anyways, we settled into the bunk house (probably not the wisest, but we had nothing else) and the three of us stayed in bed for a whole day feeling like absolute death. I actually had to check to see if Monsta Mash was breathing because she was just too still. The next day was meant to be this massive marijuana party at the hostel because it was April 20th (420). The three of us decided that if we were going to continue to be sick that the smell of 200 other hikers laced with reefer was not going to help us at all. So we booked a shuttle to get us to a private cabin in Hot Springs where we could wait out our mutual sorrow in relative comfort and also resupply at the very popular Dollar General (that was the worst resupply ever! Imagine getting your food at a Dollar General that only had a third of their normal inventory, no fun).
So, after zeroing for what felt like four days we headed out of the flooded town of Hot Springs and that was the last time I saw that group until the last day. They were just moving too slow for my tastes and I had a mile marker I wanted to make. It was that day that I decided that anything less than a 15 mile day was a Nero. Maybe not the wisest, but I think that’s when I starting earning my killer calves. I spent the next 3-ish weeks averaging 16-20 mile days, partly because I felt like I was on a schedule, but mostly because of the personal challenge of it. It just felt weird to stop before 5pm, so I would keep going. That day out of Damascus I had planned on being lazy and just stopping at the first tent site a mile out. But when I got there, there was no water, so I ended up at Saunders Shelter (a must see site about a quarter mile off the trail). I got there at noon after hiking 9 miles and decided to stop there for the rest of the day, and while I was able to rest up, I wasn’t really able to relax because I kept feeling like I needed to keep going. Miss Janet yelled at me in Erwin about trying to go too fast, not because of injury risk (though that’s a real serious thing, it’s amazing more people aren’t injured on the trail just due to the conditions), but because she thought I was missing the flowers and animals and general experience. But you know, hike your own hike. I ran into some ultra-runners in the Smokies that were supported but would average 45 miles a day!! They’re crazy.
Many other things happened between then and when I ended my journey. I completed my half-gallon challenge at Brushy Mountain Outfitters, it was actually pretty easy and satisfying. I ran into Lolli and Pop, Peabody and Radagast again. I got an offer for work in Macau that I signed onto. I got an offer for work inspecting cruise ships that I might still do and I got an offer to work in Antarctica that I’ll do in a few years when I’ve completed these other gigs. I learned to be less tied into my electronics (thanks Sprint!). I learned to be more grateful for the things that I have in life and how to appreciate the simple joy of having a shower on a regular basis. The necessities in life have become more relevant to me, something that I find myself focusing on and re-examining the extra stuff that I find I don’t use enough for it to be truly needed. I didn’t quite find that solitude that I had been looking for, there are just too many people on the trail, but I’m not sure that the social aspect was something I would give up. There are so many fun, interesting and quirky folks out there with a hankering to be adventurous too and I think that drove me to keep leading my life instead of having it lead me. 
I’m gonna be hiking again, don’t know when, but I’ll be back. Also, I’m gonna just pay someone to edit my work on posts and videos, so all I have to do is produce the content and carry on.
Enjoy your lives!!",,View Entry,"May 28, Tue",0
