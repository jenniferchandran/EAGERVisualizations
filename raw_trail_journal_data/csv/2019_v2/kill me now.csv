kill me now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582692,"I'm preparing gear for the thru hike in 2019. My brother wants to do this because we are feeling our mortality by hitting 60 on the trail, we're not sure if we would be able to do this later in life.... kill me now... is a reference to my attitude toward walking 2000 miles with my evil twin.
Clothing
 Underwear ( the important items first ) 80% poly 20% spandex jockey brand from belks
Boxer / briefs they should dry fast and no chafing (Woohoo).
Buffs from Amazon.. I love them on my previous smokey Mt hikes they are so versatile, keep my neck warm, wipe sweat off, wear two for face and head... and use as a hot pad or rag ...they wash up easy.
sleeping system
venture sleeping pad I got a deal code ( cheap old man cheers ) $10
Trail prep
I swam a mile at the ymca today, trying to get in some kind of shape. I've lost 90 lbs in last year with minimal exercise, so now I've joined the local hiking club and ymca
Weather
it's been raining all day, I went hiking by myself in October on an easy 3 mile hike to a cascade waterfall....I did not get on the trail until 4 pm. I parked my truck at the trail head in the rain, next to the warning about bear activity and no camping because of the bears. (Yikes) I wanted to try out my rain gear so I figured a quick day hike in and out.
The trail was not on the map but it was in a guide book, it crossed the river about 20+ times and you had to find the trail on the other side of the river each time :( I did get to the waterfall, I was pretty wet despite the rain gear but I was comfortable except my main shirt was cotton so that was cold on my arms, the rest of my gear was poly nylon and comfortable even in the rain.
I started back and it got dark fast, woodsy I did have a flashlight so no problem...I kept myself entertained by singing loudly due to all the bear poop... 99 bottles of beer keeps you going well...so now I cross a river and lose the trail...so you know your in trouble when you tell yourself not to panic (yikes)
I walked down stream some tripped hit hard and cracked two ribs (ouchy) I told myself again don't panic, I got to the other bank and climbed through the rhodendrum and wow I found the trail ( I got down and kissed it) 
Ok so I'm wet cold (temp dropping into the 20's) and in slight pain, I had not told anyone where I was going, no phone service. so time to get hiking I barely found the trail each time I recrossed the river....I was never so happy as when I walked up on my truck. ","

kill me now,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582716,"I've been checking websites and scouring internet for trail info. What kind of base layer (underwear) silk, wool, poly. I've found some nice poly/spandex boxer/briefs but I am reading they should be wool/spandex blend for extra warmth when I get wet.
I've only been hiking 4 times in the mountains, I've been lost twice.. the second time I was with a thinking club and doing find until the end when the leader suggested I go ahead as he was waiting on some ppl lagging so I thought no problem as two others had gone ahead already.
I scooted on down the trail, it had blue blazes ands marked well.. after a mile or two I had not caught up to anyone so I moved faster and after 5 miles I thought whoops something is wrong I must have missed the turn off and since I did not want to wander off I stayed on the blue blazes trail and moved ahead after another 5 miles (argh) I sat down made some fresh coffee and had cheese while I watched the sun set.
My phone was working so I called home and let my wife know what was happening, I did not have any of the hiking clubs phone numbers. 
Now it's pitch black.....
I have a flashlight, so I tuck it up in my buff on my head and continue on the trail to the trailhead. The map at the end was very confusing with no you are here arrows. So still lost.
I do not have any telephone service, I do have a Garmin GPS but no maps installed so I do have a location and a waypoint for where I parked the car. I walked the wrong way 1 mile down 1 mile back...
My flashlight dies....I have a battery back up for my phone with a built in light so I had something to see by while I changed batteries on my flashlight. Then I hooked the big battery to my phone it had no service but I could play music while I walked in the moonlight.
I walked a total of 14 miles when I walked up to the rescue ppl looking for me about 2 miles from where my car was parked. I was glad to see the hiking club had called them.","

I carry extra batteries for just such an occasion.","None yet
