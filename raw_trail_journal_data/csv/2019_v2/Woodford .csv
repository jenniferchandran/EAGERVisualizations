During the night the temperature dropped to 28 degrees with a howling wind / ice storm all night.  I woke up to ice on the trees not to mention on the top of my tarp covering my hammock. 
Because it rained most of the day yesterday, my boots were wet when I went to sleep and they were frozen in the morning.  Talk about uncomfortable - try putting your feet in frozen boots and hike for a few miles.
Once I got moving, the day turned out to be ok.  The cold temps caused ice crystals to form on all the trees - it was very pretty.  It did finally warm up to the mid 30’s, but the sun never came out.","Stover Creek Shelter

Hiking during the day was quite pleasant because the sun was out and the wind was fairly calm.  
I came across several spectacular views from Ramrock Mountain.  The kind of views which make the hike worthwhile.  From one spot I could see Atlanta - 70 miles away.

Over the ten days I have met many hikers also trying to through hike to Katahdin in Baxter State Park, ME.  Most of the folks are from the east/southeast/midwest.  A few are from as far away as Utah and Oregon.  The out of country hikers include UK, Australia, Germany and Canada.  Everyone has been very nice and pleasant to spend time with.  Several of the hiker names I have come across include - Crazy Heart, Upstate, Scout, Flickertail, Ponykeg.

The weather today was great - sunny, warm (mid 50’s) and clear.  Hiking was easy and very enjoyable.
At the end of the day I was treated to trail magic at Rock Gap by the Crawford family.  The Crawford’s became famous last year by hiking the AT with their 6 children - ages 2 to 16.  Check them out on YouTube.  They provided food and beers.  A real treat after a long day of hiking.  Thanks Crawford’s - your generosity is heart warming...","Carter Gap Shelter

After taking a zero day yesterday in Franklin NC, I feel very refreshed and ready to hit the trail for several days.
The highlight of my hike today was the Wayah Bald Stone Lookout Tower.  It was built by the CCC back in the mid 30’s and used for a fire lookout tower for many years.  It use to be twice as tall but was chopped off to its present height, due to neglect which caused structural issues.  A picture of the tower is in the photo gallery of this journal.  The picture above shows the great views which are seen from the tower.  As a matter of fact, I was able to see Clingman’s Dome in the Smoky Mountains from the top of the tower looking northwest.  I will be at Clingman’s Dome on March 25th.  The Dome is 80 miles away via the AT.
As you may have noticed - I have been given a trail name by my fellow hikers.  I guess, unbeknownst to me, they have observed how much I have enjoyed a wee taste of Woodford Reserve when we are in town - hence my trail name is Woodford.
I have had the privilege, over the last two weeks, to provide six trail names for hikers in my current tramily (trail family - as the hiker community calls groups of AT hikers spending time together).  There is Upstate (hiker from upstate NY), Flickertail (hiker from ND - Flickertail is a ND state nickname and is a Robinson ground squirrel which flicks it’s tail), Valcan (Roman God of Fire - hiker was able to get a fire going for the group with very wet wood on a very cold evening), Sacajawea (hiker who has the characteristics of being fearless), Mona Lisa (hiker who is was an art major and who actually resembles Mona Lisa when she smiles), and Frodo (hiker who likens hiking the AT with the adventures in the Shire).","Winding Stair Gap

It did warm up nicely to the upper 40’s with plenty of sunshine.  The clear day made the views from Copper Ridge Bald - elevation 5080 and Wesser Bald Fire Tower- elevation 4627, absolutely worth the climb.  I have pictures of the Wesser Bald Fire Tower in the photo gallery.
My hiking partner - Crazy Heart left the trail this afternoon for several obligations at home this coming week. His wife Gwen and daughter Anna met us at Tellico Gap to pick him up. Gwen stopped on the way to the Gap and picked us up hamburgers/fries, beers and made homemade chocolate chip cookies.  Wow was that nice.  Such simple things make the day...I will be meeting up with Crazy Heart again in eight days at New Found Gap in the Smoky’s.  Hopefully he will bring me some trail magic to enjoy.","Wayah Bald Shelter
",Wesser Bald Shelter ,"Mar 17, Sun",10.60
Woodford ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608543,"Today’s hike was split into to halves.  The first six miles were all down hill from Wesser Bald Shelter - elevation 4092 to where the AT crosses the Nantahala River - elevation 1732.  Although you may think going down hill is easier than going up hill, it is really hard on your knees, thighs and feet.  Most hikers pick an uphill climb over long down hill stretches.  The one reward along this down hill stretch was the Jump Off Point which provided stunning views of the distant Smoky Mountains. The picture above highlights the view.
Upon reaching the Nantahala River, the AT passes right by the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC).  The NOC is a favorite hiker stop because it is not only a hostel, but also has a restaurant, resupply store, laundry, etc.  I took full advantage of all the amenities.  After a quick hobo bath in the men’s room, I did my laundry, ate a huge burger and had a beer, and picked up a few food items I needed.
The second half of the hike was mostly up hill.  Starting at the NOC, the trail goes up 3000 feet over the next six miles to Swim Bald - elevation 4710.  Needless to say by the time I got to my destination at Sassafras Gap Shelter, I was beat.
On the way up to Swim Bald, there is a memorial plaque honoring Wade Sutton who died on December 7, 1968 fighting a forest fire.  A picture of his memorial is in the picture gallery of the journal.  RIP Wade...","Wesser Bald Shelter

The highlight of today’s hike was Cheoah Bald - elevation 5062.  The picture above shows a gathering of hikers on the Bald. The 360 degrees views were awesome.  A great place to relax and enjoy the sunshine.
The day was going along very well until I hit Jacob’s Ladder.  This fairly short stretch, six tenths of a mile, which jumps up 600 feet of nearly vertical ascent, with no switchbacks.  Although this may sound like an old tired hiker complaining, it was just brutal.  Having a thirty five pound pack on your back going straight uphill, is no picnic.

Zero day at Fontana Village today.  It turned out to be raining off and on all day.   Besides doing my zero day chores, I was able to catch up on my journal entries, make a few overdue phone calls and just chill out.
Fontana Village is an interesting place.  It was the housing area for the men and women who built the Fontana Dam in the early 1940’s.  The Dam is the largest of all the TVA lakes.  It’s main purpose when it was constructed was to produce electricity for the Alcoa aluminum plant in Alcoa TN, fifty one miles to the northwest.  This plant made aluminum to support the World War II effort.  Fontana Village had 5000 people living here at its peak.  Now it is just a sleepy resort filled with through hikers in March / April and vacationers during the summer months.Tomorrow I make my way into the Great Smoky Mountain National Park (GSMNP).  This is a special section of my hike because I have hiked the southern part several times in the past.  The first time with my brother George back in our college days and then with my son Nate eight or so years ago.  I’m looking forward to revisiting the overlooks and mountain tops again.","Fontana Village

Last night was the first night I spent inside a shelter.  In the GSMNP, all hikers are required to stay in the shelters.  The only time you can camp is when the shelter is full.  I prefer sleeping in my hammock because it is much more comfortable and I enjoy the privacy.
Today’s hike tracked over Rocky Top - elevation 5440, and Thunderhead Mountain - elevation 5527.  The views from Rocky Top were awesome.  The picture above shows the views and some of my fellow hikers - from left to right: Mulligan (second attempt at a though hike), Bullseye (from Australia who likes to play darts), Grizz (big guy who snores like a bear), and Sweatsicle (has long hair and when he sweats, it freezes at the ends of his hair).  All the guys are characters in their own right.","Mollies Ridge Shelter

Today Crazy Heart rejoined me.  He and his wife Gwen drove up from the Charlotte area to meet me at New Found Gap.  Crazy looked well rested after a week off the trail.  We will continue to hike together until I have to leave the trail for a few weeks in May.  I want to thank Crazy and Gwen for bringing my resupply, a huge hamburger and a few beers.  Thanks Gwen and Crazy.
A lot of people ask me what I eat while I’m hiking.  For breakfast I have been eating granola bars while I walk.  I usually have Cliff bars for lunch and for dinner it has mostly been freezed dried meals or ramen noodles and tuna.  While in town, I usually eat like I’m going to the electric chair due to having real food.
The last couple of mornings I have tried something new.  I’ve been enjoying a couple of pepperoni peanut butter burritos.  This is a hiker staple. The picture above shows one of my creations.  To make one, you need a small soft burrito shell, smear peanut butter on it, spread a few pepperoni around, then roll it up like a fatty and enjoy.  Try one at home - you may like it.","Mt Collins Shelter

The picture above is from the Sawteeth section of the hike.  The trail corridor is only a few feet wide with sharp drop offs on both sides.  Because of the rain and low cloud ceiling, the views most of the day were non existent.  I literally spent the day in the clouds at that elevation.  The trail was also icy in many spots so I had to be very careful where I stepped the entire day.
Since I climbed up and over Clingman’s Dome, the higher elevation has changed the forest from a mostly deciduous forest with oak, beech and birch trees to an alpine forest with all spruce and pine trees.

The first happened at Devil Fork Gap.  Section hiker Now-Or-Never and his crew were set up along NC 212 where the trail crosses the road.  They treated us with pimento cheese sandwiches, hard boiled eggs, chips, fruit and a variety of sodas.  Thank you Now-Or-Never and your crew for such a great treat.  A pic of Now-Or-Never and his crew is in the photo gallery.
The second trail magic event happened when I arrived at the Hogback Ridge Shelter.  Section hikers and local trail maintainers - Trout Man and Sketch hiked 2.5 miles packing fried chicken and cold beers and soda.  I cannot being to tell you the excitement of us hikers when they opened their pack and the smell of fried chicken hit our noses.  Most of us didn’t utter a word until we gobbled down a couple of pieces of chicken and had a drink or two. Thank you Trout Man and Sketch for this delicious treat after a long day hiking.  A pic of Trout Man and Sketch is in the photo gallery.

Gadget told me he emigrated from Cuba when he was a child.  He came to the US as part of a US lead evacuation of non communists escaping Fidel’s government.  He still has a deep love for the Cuban people, culture, food and cigars.  His favorite Cuban cigar is the Montecristo. Although he didn’t have any on hand, if he did and he offered me one, I’m sure I would still be sitting on his porch enjoying the fine cigar with a glass of rum.  Thank you Ceecee and Gadget for such a great evening.
My hike over Roan Mountain was fairly uneventful. Although it was a long up hill climb, the views on the way up made it worth it.  
Back in 1880’s, the top of Roan Mountain was the home of the Cloudland Hotel.  This three story, 166 room structure was the respite for the wealthy of the day to escape of the summer heat as well as those who suffered from hay-fever.  The hotel only lasted until 1910 when it was abandoned.  The only reminders of the hotel are a few stones from the foundation and a chimney from the caretaker house.
As I hiked past Roan Mountain the Roan Highlands are visible.  The highlands are three grassy summits - Round Bald, Jane Bald and the largest, Grassy Ridge Bald.  The AT travels across all three balds.

Last night I stealth camped with Bucket List, Galileo and Cliffhanger next to the Laurel Fork River at the foot of Pond Mountain.  During the night we were hit with a thunderstorm- torrential downpours and an impressive lightning show to boot.  It only lasted 45 minutes but it felt like hours.  Fortunately, I firmly secured my tarp over my hammock and I did not get wet.
My destination today was the Boots Off Hostel.  The fairly short six plus mile hike took me over Pond Mountain.  The grade going up and over the mountain was very fair.  The entire hike only took me a few hours.
At the hostel I met up with my very good friend and ex-neighbor from my hood in Loveland, John Chapman.  John had been planning to meet up with me for several months.  He is an avid hiker and outdoorsman.  John’s youngest daughter, Mary, drove him over from their home in Charlotte.
Upon arriving at the hostel, John and Mary were kind enough to take me into Hampton, TN for my resupply.  Thanks again Mary for spending time with your dad and me.  The picture above shows John and me in front of our tiny cabin at the hostel.
Once we were back at the hostel, John presented me with some very special trail magic - a batch of homemade stew for dinner, a nice selection of cigars and best of all, a quart of premixed Manhattan’s.  If you know anything about me, I do like a good Manhattan and John knows how to mix them just right.  
After we ate the stew, we sat on the porch of out tiny cabin and lit up a cigar and poured a Manhattan.  I was in heaven.  
John, being fresh to the AT, did not have a trail name.  So it was only fitting that I give him the name “Manhattan”.  He gladly accepted the new moniker and from this day forward he will be known as “Manhattan”.  I cannot thank him enough for his awesome gifts and I look forward to spending the week with him.
In addition to the gifts that Manhattan brought, Kerry, his wife, also sent some trail magic - a variety eight pack of Kellogg cereal and a very nice card.  The joke here, for those who do not know Kerry, she is known for serving cereal to her family for dinner when she doesn’t feel like cooking.  So in my mind, she sent me eight different dinners.  Thanks Kerry for thinking of me.  I will enjoy the variety...","Waycaster Spring Campsite

The hike today took us along the shore of Watauga Lake.  After a few miles at near lake level, we crossed the dam and climbed back into the mountains.  The views of the lake and surrounding area were fantastic.  Our destination was the Vandeventer Shelter 9.1 miles from the hostel.  I thought I would give Manhattan an easy day being new to the trail and all.  The picture above is the view of the lake from right behind the shelter.

From the Vandeventer Shelter to Damascus, VA, roughly 33 miles, the AT is affectionately know as the “Tennessee Turnpike”.  This is due to the relatively flat terrain.  The fluctuation in elevation is at most 600 feet staying between 3500 feet and 4100 feet.  The picture above shows the typical look of the trail in this section.
In the early afternoon, I met Too Many who is from Alabama and was hiking southbound.  He was finishing up his through hike he started last year.  He had already summited Katahdin and was hiking towards Springer Mountain.
After we exchanged the usual hiking pleasantries, I asked him how he got his trail name.  He said Too Many was short for too many of our US service men and woman are dying from PTSD related injuries after they get out of the service.  He stated that he is hiking for twenty two service men and women- one for every one hundred miles of the 2200 miles of the AT.  He showed me a picture hanging on the side of his pack, of one young Marine who lost his battle with PTSD.  He said after he hikes the one hundred miles for the intended service person, he hand writes a letter to that person’s family.
Too Much was also in the service, so he understands the challenges our US military personnel face when they get back home and try to pick up their lives again.

Damascus is host to the annual Trail Days extravaganza.  This huge hiker gathering is usually the third weekend in May.  It draws several thousand current, past and future AT through hikers.  They host a parade of former and current through hikers who march down the middle of town.  Along with all the hikers, many equipment manufacturers and retailers are here to display their goods.  I hear it’s one big safety meeting...
Damascus is also know for the bicycle Creeper Trail.  This is a twenty plus mile ride down from the mountains on an old railroad (known back in the day as a Creeper) bed made into a bike trail.  Because of the constant downhill grade, they say you do not need to pedal for any of the twenty miles.  Over three hundred thousand people ride the Creeper Trail each year.  There are many bicycle rental and transportation companies in the town to support this huge industry.
Damascus’ hay day was from the late 1890’s through the mid nineteen twenties.  The lumber industry was king in this part of Virginia and specifically Washington county where Damascus is home.  During that twenty five year period, over three and a half billion, yes I said billion, board feet of lumber (oak, chestnut, pine and popular) were cut.  Because they did not use sustainable logging methods, the lumber industry died out.

All was good for the next hour or so until about 9:45 am when the skies opened up again and it poured.  I put my rain coat/pants on and keep on trucking.  The heavier rains stopped after an hour but a lighter rain keep up until I reached the south end of Chestnut Ridge - elev 3780.  Like magic, I saw patches of blue skies.  I thought for sure all the storms had passed.  I came across a spring, so I stopped and replenished my water.  This took all of 15 minutes.  By the time I got back on the trail, it began to drizzle again and this time it was accompanied by a stiff breeze.  I didn’t think anything about it until the rain picked up and the breeze turned into a strong wind.  I stopped and put on my rain gear again and keep going.  


Chestnut Ridge is two miles long and cleared of trees.  It goes from elev 3780 up to 4393.  At the top is Chestnut Knob Shelter.  I guess the views from this long clearing at this elevation are spectacular - but not today.


As I proceeded higher on Chestnut Ridge, the rain came down in buckets and the winds gusts were between 25 and 35 mph.  Needless to say I was soaked.  At times the wind was so strong, I was almost blown over.  The temperatures were also dropping from the upper forties to the high thirties. For the better part of an hour I fought onward.  I thought for sure, Jesus himself was going to call me home.  The picture above shows the ridge in all of it’s cold and rainy glory.


By the time I reached the shelter at the top of the mountain, I was drenched.  I opened the door of the shelter and inside was packed with wet, cold hikers who like me, just made the same journey.  A picture of the shelter is in the photo gallery.


I stayed in the shelter and had something to eat to warm up a bit.  After forty minutes, the rain and wind slowed, so I ventured out again.  I still had six miles to go.  Wouldn’t you know it, an hour after I left the shelter, the rain was back.  


I finally reach my destination, VA 623, where I had made arrangements to be picked up and taken to the Garden Mountain Hostel.  After a hot shower and a change of clothes, I was able to relax for the evening.  What a day...","Lynn Camp Creek

My hike today was relatively easy with a minimum of elevation changes.  For the most part, the trail fallowed old logging roads.  Because it’s the weekend and close to both Bland, VA and Bastian, VA there were more than the usual number of day hikers out enjoying the nice weather.  The picture above was taken from a spot (elev 3000) overlooking the mountains to the right where I started my hike today.  I crossed the valley and back up the ridge on the left.  It was great to be out and enjoying the great outdoors.


As a side note - I will be leaving the trail after today, for all of May.  Besides getting some much needed rest, I will be participating in several joyous family celebrations during the upcoming month.  I plan on returning the first week of June to continue my journey.  Thank you to all who sent me inspirational emails, text messages and notes in the guest book.  I appreciate each of them and will continue to draw inspiration from them.  As of this morning, there have been 37,000 views of this journal.  I hope it gives you as much pleasure reading the daily entries and looking at the photos as it gives me writing them and taking the pictures.

After a busy May with many family activities ( youngest daughter’s college graduation, son’s and new daughter-in-law’s wedding and over the last four days, helping my youngest daughter move to Manhattan ) it’s nice to be back in the woods.


As I return to the trail -  I will be doing a flip flop with a twist - in hiker terms.  Because I am in NYC with my daughter’s move and NYC is fairly close to the AT, I decided to start near Wingdale, NY and head north.  This will allow me to summit Katahdin in early August.  Then I will come back to NYC, travel out to Wingdale again and head south to finish my hike in Bland, VA where I stopped in late April.


My day started today at the corner of 85th and York on the upper east side of Manhattan, near my daughter’s new apartment.  I started walking south (full pack and all) toward Grand Central Terminal.  You can imagine the looks I got by the New Yorkers walking down Park Avenue at 6:00 in the morning.  The pic above was take on Park Avenue.  After 43 blocks or 2.5 miles, I reached GCT where I took the Harlem Line of the Metro-North  Railroad northwest to the Wingdale, NY station.  From there I made my way through the grounds of the now closed Harlem Valley State Hospital which was a New York State psychiatric hospital in operation from 1924 to 1994.  This led me to within 500 feet of the AT at which time I had to bushwhack the remaining way.  Once I found the AT, all was good.  The AT actually crosses the train tracks between Pawling NY and Wingdale and the train will stop at the makeshift AT station for hikers - but only on the weekends.


Once on the trail, the New York - Connecticut boarder was just over four miles away.  Connecticut will make my fourth state which I will complete.  See the Connecticut welcome sign in the photo gallery.  The trail Is only fifty mile long in Connecticut so I will be through it in a few days.


On my fairly short hike today I did see several interesting items which I have pics in the photo gallery - the convergence of the Ten Mile River and the Housatonic River, Bulls Covered Bridge - circa 1842, and a beautiful view from Indian Rocks - elev 1249.

Woodford ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615731,"Day two back on the trail was not as productive as yesterday. I found out very quickly that the AT in Connecticut has a lot of steep inclines and declines.  The trail is beautiful and very well maintained but there are not many switchbacks due to the narrow trail corridor.  The total elevation of the mountains are not extreme but there are many 500 to 1000 foot elevation changes within a half a mile or so.  Also, not having my trail legs in full strength doesn’t help.  I did just over ten miles today but it felt like many more.  


One section of the trail called St. John’s Ledges (elev 883) was very technical and challenging.  The pic above shows the view from the top of the ledges overlooking the Housatonic River.  The trail follows the ledge for a few hundred yards and then descends 500 feet to the lower trail.  This doesn’t sound so tough but it all happens quickly and very steeply.  You have scramble down a boulder field while you have a thirty plus pound pack trying to push you over.  One misstep and its off to the hospital.


I also met several other through hikers (Billy Goat, Gandalf, No Plans) today who started the trail in Georgia around the same time I did - some in late February and one a week after I did on March 10th.  All of these hikers have been averaging around twenty miles a day for the last two months to get this far.  In addition, there are also several flip floppers (Stitcher, Shade Chaser) who started at Harper’s Ferry, the half way point, and are making their way to Maine.","Schaghticoke Campsite

For the next eight miles there were five elevation changes of over five hundred feet.  Each of these small summits presented their own challenges of boulders to climb over, squeezes to fit through (see pic above of the tight fit of one of the assents).  And of course, every time there was a steep up hill climb, a corresponding steep downhill decent followed.  As tough as I make it sound, once I have my trail legs back, I’ll be doing cartwheels up and down these mountains.


I ended the day at the Sharon Mountain Campsite - elev 1134.  I was the only one at the campsite for the night.  Once I set up my hammock ( see pic in the photo gallery) made my dinner of freezed dried three cheese mac and cheese, turned on some Reggie music courtesy of Pandora and finish the last of my Woodford whiskey I packed, all was right with the world...","Stewart Hollow Brook Shelter

The trail passed through Falls Village, CT.  This is the second smallest town in Connecticut with a population of 490 souls.  Falls Village got its name from the large water fall at the north end of the village on the Housatonic River.  The village dates back to the early 1700’s and was a hotbed of steel manufacturing during the late 1700’s through the 1800’s.  The high quality steel was used mostly for gun barrels and train wheels.  I stopped at the Toymakers restaurant in town for a quick sandwich and drink instead of my usual three Clif bars.

Woodford ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616016,"Good bye Connecticut - hello Massachusetts!!!


My hike today from Salisbury to the Glen Brook Shelter was one of the most beautiful hikes I have experienced on this trip so far.  It was also one of the most grueling because of the severe elevation changes and ruggedness of the trail.


The trail out of Salisbury is fairly easy for the first two miles but then it very quickly ascends six hundred feet in the next seven tenth of a mile, summiting at Lions Head peak - elevation 1729.  The view from Lions Head was simply outstanding.  The weather was very clear and you could see for miles.  I made a video of the view which you can watch in the new video section of the journal.


From Lions Head, the trail descends for a half of a mile and then starts back uphill towards the peak of Bear Mountain - elevation 2316.  The last one half mile to the peak of Bear Mountain, the trail is almost a vertical climb of five hundred feet, mostly over sharp boulders with very few switchbacks.  Like the views from Lions Head, the views from Bear Mountain were awesome.  Bear Mountain is the highest peak in Connecticut.


The one half mile descent from the peak of Bear Mountain was as difficult as the descent from St. John’s Ledges. Almost straight down over slabs of rock and sharp boulders with no switchbacks.


The trail continues to descend for the next half mile at an easier pace to the Connecticut - Massachusetts border.  Leaving Connecticut makes the fourth state (GA, NC, TN, CT) that I’ve hiked through.  Massachusetts is just over 90 miles long.


Just past the CT-MA border, the trail enters the Sages Ravine.  This deep ravine was created by the Sawmill Brook and is surrounded by old growth hemlock trees.  There are many water falls and deep holes which are great for swimming.  The trail follows the ravine for three tenths of a mile before it starts to ascends to Mt. Race - elevation 2365.


On the way up to the Mt. Race summit, the trail follows a ridge which provides excellent views of the low country below.  Upon reaching the top of Mt. Race, the view to the north was wonderful.  It was so clear out, I could see Mt. Greylock (the highest peak in MA) which is seventy miles away.  I will be hiking over Mt. Greylock just before I enter New Hampshire.


Past Mt. Race is Mt. Everett - elevation 2602.  The decent from Mt. Race wasn’t too tough but the ascent up to the top of Mt. Everett was brutal.  It took every ounce of my last energy to get to the summit.  The trail again was almost straight up with sharp boulders, slabs of slippery rocks and no switchbacks.  The view from the top of Mt. Everett was mostly obscured by trees.  The descent from the top was not too tough and the remaining hike to the shelter was fairly easy.  Needless to say, by the end of the day I was beat.  With the great weather and magnificent views all the pain and exhaustion was definitely worth it.


In the photo section I have several pictures of the various views from the hike.","Salisbury, CT - NOBO Mile Marker 1501.4

The trail to Great Barrington was fairly easy as it made its way through a few bogs and open pastures.  I always like hiking through the pastures because they are open and flat.


On the way to Great Barrington, I passed through a historical area where the last battle of Shays Rebellion took place.  Shays Rebellion, for all of you who may have played hooky on the day you covered this in your history class, was mainly in Massachusetts and was started in 1786.  It ended on February 27, 1787 in the field I hiked through (see pic above).  The rebellion was lead by Daniel Shays, who was a Revolutionary War veteran, and was started over excessive taxation and property foreclosures by the Massachusetts government.  The rebels were mostly ex-Revolutionary War soldiers turned farmers.  As a result of the rebellion, the new federal government moved away from governing the states through the Articles Of Confederation, which gave the states great power and a weak federal government, to the US Constitution which give the federal government strong oversight.","Glen Brook Shelter

The hike today was the usual ups and downs but they were not extreme.  The sun finally came out in the early afternoon and the forest began to dry out.  The picture above is from one of the many meadows I walked through today.


When I decided to take a break for lunch, I heard a crashing sound in the woods to my right about forty yards down the trail.   To my surprise a fairly large black bear popped out of the woods.  Because of my position he did not see me and turned to start walking down the trail towards me.  I wanted to get a picture but thought better to shoo him off.  I banged my hiking poles together a few times and he shot back into the forest.  So there you have it - my first real bear sighting.","Tom Leonard Shelter

As tranquil as Upper Goose Pond was, in  the next mile plus, the trail crossed over the Massachusetts Turnpike.  You can imagine the noise from the traffic as it passed under me.  I picked up my pace to get back into the woods to escape the loud traffic.  Once I was out of earshot of the Turnpike, the rest of the hike was enjoyable.","Stealth Camp At NOBO Mile Marker 1544.4

They were all gathered around one hiker who was on the ground and holding her right elbow, grimacing in pain.  Apparently she slipped on a slippery moss covered rock slab and landed on it.  One of the other hikers had some medical training so she put her into a temporary sling and another call for emergency care.  Because we were deep in the backcountry and she was able to walk, the best the emergency personnel could do was to meet us at the next shelter - 4.6 miles away.  Several of the hikers walked with her making sure she wouldn’t fall and I and another hiker carried her pack.  By the time we arrived at the next shelter, members of the local fire department and a paramedic were waiting for us.  They examined the injury and suggested it was most likely a broken arm.  The fire squad took her back to their truck via a short cut, and off to the hospital they all went.  Hopefully she is doing well and her injury heals quickly.  A pic of the fire department at the Story Spring Shelter is in the photo gallery.

Most of my day was spent planning for the hike next week.  I resupplied at the nearby Walmart and Price Chopper grocery store.  As I was finishing up my shopping at the Price Chopper, I took a wrong turn down the frozen foods / ice cream isle.  I strolled past the ice cream section, and much to my total surprise, I noticed that they sold two selections of Graeter’s ice cream - Raspberry Chip and Cookies and Cream.  I let out the biggest wooooo hoooo you have ever heard.  The other shoppers in the frozen food isle didn’t know what to make out of this homeless looking hiker trash dancing for joy in the store.  If your not from Cincinnati OH, you have no idea what or how good Graeter’s ice cream is.  And the fact they sold Raspberry Chip - my favorite, was a huge bonus.  Of course I bought a pint of the Raspberry and proceeded to eat the whole pint as soon as I left the store.  The pic above is what you missed...","SR VT 103 Near Rutland VT - NOBO Mile Marker 1685.3

I decided to stay one more night at the Yellow Deli Hostel and slack pack 17.7 miles between the two state routes that run parallel and into Rutland.  To get to the AT trailhead, I took the Marble Valley Regional Transit Authority (MVRTA) bus which travels between the towns of Rutland and Killington.  For only two bucks, the bus picks you up right behind the hostel and drops you off at the AT where it crosses US RT 4, eight miles north of Rutland.  By starting my hike here, I hiked southeast towards my final destination for the day at SR VT 103.


The AT between the two state routes, goes up and over Killington Peak - elevation 4236, where the Killington Ski Resort is located.  The trail up to Killington Peak is not too steep until it is within a mile of the summit, then it shoots upwards at a forty five degrees angle.  On the top of Killington Peak is the Peak Lodge.  This is where the ski lift deposits skiers in the winter.  The lodge is also open in the summer for hikers and anyone who takes a ride on the lift.  I stopped in to eat my lunch, have a beer, and enjoy the breathtaking views of the surrounding mountains.  A couple of pics from the top of Killington Peak are in the photo gallery.


After an hour of enjoying the views, I started my decent down the other side of the mountain. The trail down was a bit steeper so I had to slow my pace.  At NOBO mile marker 1690, there was a sign on a tree which indicated there is only 500 miles to Katahdin.  According to my rough calculations, at my current pace, I should summit Katahdin within the first eight days of August.  The wild card are the White Mountains in New Hampshire, which slows everyone because of the difficult terrain.  A pic of the 500 mile mark is above.


If you were wondering whether or not I went back to Price Chopper this evening to get a pint of the other Graeter’s ice cream flavor - Cookies and Cream - I thought long and hard about it all day when I was hiking over Killington Peak, but even a starving hiker would have trouble eating another pint of this very rich treat from the Gods two day’s in a row...","SR VT 103 Near Rutland VT - NOBO Mile Marker 1685.3

Becoming impatient, when I thought the worst of the rain was over, I slung my pack on my back and down the trail I went.  Twenty minutes later it started raining again.  I put my rain gear on and keep walking.

In addition to the hundreds of chipmunks, the plethora of birds and several snakes I see on a daily basis, early in my hike I heard a commotion roughly seventy yards up ahead and to the right of the trail.  The terrain was fairly flat and the forest was full of mature trees.  There was a mother bear and three cubs looking at me wondering what they should do.  One cub climbed the nearest tree and the other three bears ran in the opposite direction.  The cub in the tree kept looking at me trying to decide whether to come down and run away or stay in the tree.  I took one step towards the cub in the tree to get a better look at it and that little bear scrambled down from the top of that tall tree in no time flat and ran off to join up with its family. I was  hoping to get a selfie with mom and her cubs, but they wanted no part of that.  


Next I came across a grouse which crossed the trail less then ten feet in front of me.  She must have had a nest close to the trail and was trying to lead me away from it.  As I walked on, I could see her in the brush next to the trail making a high pitched sound as if she was injured.  When I was out of sight, she stopped squeaking and went back to her nest.


In addition to all the animals I saw, there were several peaks I climbed throughout the day.  First was Moose Mountain - elev 2290 and the second was Holts Ledges - elev 1968.  Both of these provided excellent views of the surrounding New Hampshire countryside.

In the morning, it was still overcast, and the rain had stopped.  I packed up my gear and off I went.


I had two peaks to go over before the end of my hike, Smarts Mountain - elev 3229 and Mt. Cube - elev 2911.  One thing I’ve learned about the peaks in Vermont and New Hampshire, even though they may not be too tall, the trail is usually fairly steep the last mile up to the top and a mile past the peak.  These two peaks were no different.  Smarts Mountain almost did me in because the rain came back as I climbed to the top.  Between the steep terrain and wet slippery boulders I had to climb over, I was exhausted as I made the summit.  On top of the mountain, I ate my lunch and quickly started down the north side of the mountain.  As I reached the lower elevations, the rain subsided and the sun came out again. 


The trail then led me up to the top of Mt. Cube were I was able to look south to see Smarts Mountain.  The view was outstanding.  I sat on the summit for several minutes taking in the views.  The pic above is looking back towards Smarts Mountain.  It turned out to be a fine day in the woods after all.","Trapper John Shelter

First, I stopped at Lonesome Lake Hut, which was only a mile and a half from the Kinsman Lake Shelter at about 9:00 am. There are several “Huts” scattered along the ridges of the White Mountains.  They are mainly for day hikers who want to experience the great outdoors. A stay at one of the huts usually cost between $115 and $150 per person per bunk, which includes dinner and breakfast.  The well maintained huts were built in the 1930’s and are staffed by a “croo” of up to six college age staff.  It is a tradition to feed the AT through hikers breakfast and dinner leftovers.  They also let a few through hikers stay for one evening on the floor of the dining area, free of cost, if they do minor chores.  The stay includes dinner leftovers.  I was lucky because there were breakfast leftovers to be had at the Lonesome Lake Hut this morning.  The last few days I had been hiking with Shade Hunter (he is a retired Air Force Master Sargent who wears a large brimmed hat to shade his face so he doesn’t have anymore dermatology issues).  Shade Hunter got to the Hut a few minutes after I did and we both chowed down on several stacks of chocolate chip pancakes with real NH maple syrup, several helpings of scrambled eggs and a few cups of coffee.  What a treat.  Our impromptu breakfast lasted almost an hour.  After we finished, we continued to hike down towards Franconia Notch and then up to the variously peaks.  The pic above is from Lonesome Lake in front of the Hut.


The next obstacle was a cool stream with a large pool just waiting for someone to take a swim. By late morning it was already eighty plus degrees and both Shade Hunter and I were sweating profusely so a quick dip in the cool mountain stream seemed just the ticket.  After another hour of enjoying the water, we were back on the trail.  At this point it was noontime and we both agreed that it would be nearly impossible to summit all those mountains in front of us with the remaining time left in the day and the fact we were both still exhausted from our hike over the North and South Kinsman Mountains.


Not letting another good diversion go to waste, at Franconia Notch there is a visitor center that serves hamburgers, beer and ice cream.  After a short mile walk, off trail, to the visitor center, we were enjoying all the delectable items we were craving.  By this time it was 2:00 pm and back on the trail we went. By the time we hike up the two and a half mile steep climb from Franconia Notch to the Liberty Spring Campsite, it was 5:30 pm.  Although I didn’t get to where I thought I would starting out this morning, I had a great day enjoying the opportunities right in front of me.","Kinsman Pond Shelter

Little Haystacks Mountain was only two miles away and a thousand feet above Liberty Springs Campsite, where I stayed last night.  The hike up to the summit was not too tough except for the last one quarter of a mile.  Once I was over the top of Little Haystacks Mountain, Mt Lincoln and the Franconia Ridge, which connects Mt Lincoln and Mt Lafayette, were fairly easy to navigate.  The assent to the top of Mt Lafayette was a good deal more effort but not impossible.  Unfortunately all of these peaks were in the clouds due to the impending rain storm.  I was able to catch a few glimpses of the surrounding mountains and valleys as the clouds passed.  The pic above is from the top of Mt Lafayette during the passing clouds.The trail between Mt Lafayette and Mt Garfield was almost four miles apart with a fifteen hundred foot down and back up again.  By the time I summited Mt Garfield the clouds broke up a bit and I could see the views I had missed from the other three mountains.  Unfortunately, when I checked the radar for the impending rain storm, it was moving quickly in my direction and I had about forty five minutes to get off the Garfield’s peak.  As predicted, the rains came quickly as I continued on my walk.  


The Galehead Hut was a little under three miles away and I was going to try and get a work for stay spot there.  The work is typically sweeping the floor and maybe cleaning dishes.  Just my luck, when I arrived at the Hut, there was an opening.  I changed into dry clothes and waited until dinner was over to feast on the leftovers.","Liberty Spring Campsite

The trail leaving the hut shot straight up to South Twin Mountain - elev 4902. From the hut to the top of the mountain it was about a thousand foot climb in under a mile.  I managed to keep all those pancakes, eggs and oatmeal down on that huge climb.  Once I was on the top the 360 degrees views were unbelievable.

The hike from Nauman Campsite took me past the Lake Of The Clouds Hut which is in the shadow of Mt Washington. Shade Hunter and I had to stop and see if there were any leftovers from breakfast, and luckily there was a large platter of pancakes and a bowl of scrambled eggs just waiting for us.  After a quick second breakfast, onwards to Mt Washington. The summit was only a mile and a half from the hut, but straight up and over very rocky terrain.  As a matter of fact the majority of the hike for the day was in the Alpine Zone which is above the tree line. The Alpine Zone is very stark and moonscape like.  The only vegetation is  very short spruce shrubs, some wild flowers, grasses and plenty of lichen covered boulders and sharp rocks.  I like hiking in this terrain because of the constant views.  The only downside are the winds and on this day the constant winds were roughly 15 - 25 mph with gusts up to 40 mph.  The temperature was in the upper fifties but with the wind it felt more like the upper forties.


Because the Mt Washington summit is very accessible by both car and a cog railroad, there were plenty of tourists. There is a snack bar where I got a few chili dogs, a bowl of clam chowder and was able to recharge my power bank and cell phone.  After an hour of eating and relaxing, I stood inline to get the picture above next to the Mt Washington elevation sign.  The views from the top were just ok.  Apparently there are wildfires in Manitoba, Canada and the smoke and particulates have make their way to northern NH causing poor air quality and reduced visibility.  Even with all that, I could still see thirty plus miles.  I can only imagine on a clear day the views must be spectacular.

Still feeling poorly, I managed to put in just under ten miles today.  The trail did its usual up and over several peaks including Mt Success - elev 3565, Mt Carlo - elev 3565, Goose Eye East Peak - elev 3790, West Peak - elev 3823 and North Peak - elev 3678. Because the air was so clear, I spent at least thirty minutes on each peak looking at the tremendous views.


For some reason I thought once I was out of NH and past the White Mountains, the rest of the terrain to Katahdin would be relatively easy.  Based on the last two days, I need to readjust my thinking. The mountains in Maine are just as challenging as they were in NH.  I was hoping to up my mileage back to around fifteen miles per day, like I was doing just before the White’s.  According to the trail map, it looks like I have a little over one hundred miles of strenuous hiking before it levels out a bit with the big finish at Katahdin.","Gentian Pond Shelter

Woodford ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618929,"Today I conquered the infamous Mahoosuc Notch - the most difficult mile on the AT.  Some hikers love it because of how technical it is, others absolutely despise it because it’s too hard.  As for me, I rather enjoyed the challenge.


The Notch is made up of boulders, most are as big as automobiles and some as large as a cabin, which fell in a canyon no more than fifty to seventy foot wide.  The walls of the Notch are over a thousand foot tall and shoot up vertically from the floor of the Notch.  The boulders are jagged and moss covered which makes the trek a little more interesting.  There are spaces between many of the boulders that are more than ten to fifteen feet deep, so if you slip and fall between the huge rocks, you may not be found for days.  Most of the time I could either jump or climb from one boulder to the next.  Several times I had to take off my pack and craw under a slab to get past it.  I could see ice blocks at the bottom of Notch under some of the bottom boulders.  The ice provided a cooling affect as you make your way up and around the obstacles.  It took me an hour and forty minutes to get through the Notch.  I ended up with a few scraps and scratched but managed to not break any bones.  The pic above gives you a small taste of the challenges of the Notch.  The rest of the day’s hike to near the top of Old Speck Mountain - elev 4170, was long due to all the energy I expended getting through the Mahoosuc Notch.  I finished my hike at the Baldplate Lean-to where I ended up going to bed early again.","Full Goose Shelter

Shade Hunter and I planned a short hiking day because we were going into Andover ME for his food package at the post office and I needed to resupply.  I got packed up and moving by 6:30 am, which is rare for me.  The morning was cool and bright.  The trail from the lean-to shot straight up one thousand feet to the top of the west Baldplate peak - elev 3662.  From there it dipped down a few hundred feet and then climbed up to the top of east Baldplate peak - elev 3810.  


This is when the magic occurred.  I was all alone, sitting on the top of a mountain in southern Maine at 7:30 am, the sun was shining, a slight breeze blew from the west and the southern views back over the White Mountains where breathtaking.  I sat there for more than forty minutes just taking in the quiet moment.  The words here cannot describe how beautiful those few moments were.  Wow - what a feeling..

I checked the weather forecast, like I always do, and the chance of rain was in the thirties with the possibility of a late afternoon thunderstorm.  With those odds, I didn’t give the weather a second thought.


Well wouldn’t you know it, an hour into my hike it starts raining.  It was a sprinkle at first, but then it changed to an all out downpour.  I of course put on my rain gear and kept walking.  The shower kept up for the better part of ninety minutes.  By that time I was soaked.  No matter how good your rain coat is, you eventually get wet - either by the driving rain or basting in your own sweat from hiking.  I finally reached the Hall Mountain Lean-to where I sat for a few minutes with several other hiker trash.  We all commiserated about the wet weather, but knew there was nothing we could do except keep on moving.  By the time I left the lean-to it was 11:15 am, and the rain had stopped.  The trail past the lean-to took me up and over Moody Mountain - elev 2440, not a very tall mountain, but very steep going up to the peak and then steep down the other side.  There was a very nice view looking south from a small cliff near the top where I ate my lunch and took the pic above.


I planned on stopping for the night on the north side of Old Blue Mountain - elev 3600, which was just past Moody Mountain.  The climb up to the summit was going very well when all of a sudden,  when I was three tenths of a mile from the top of the mountain, I heard a clap of thunder.  Two things ran through my head - I really didn’t want to get hit by lightning and it’s going to rain again.  Well the rain came shortly after the thunder, and it rained hard.  I put my rain coat and skirt back on and just stood there.  The lightning and thunder continued so I could not summit the peak where I may be the tallest thing up there, and in a lightning storm that may not end well for me.  For the next forty minutes I just waited out the storm and got soaked - again.  The rain came down so hard, the trail turned into a river flowing past my feet.  Finally as the lightning portion of the storm passed, I moved on over the top of Old Blue.  Past the summit and on the way down, the rain continued and the trail was a mess. I finally found a stealth spot to hang my hammock and dry out for the night.","East B Hill Road - NOBO Mile Marker 1935.1

The rest of the day was mostly non eventful except for the delicious trail magic provided by Snowman and his wonderful wife. They were perfectly positioned just north of Bemis Mountain on a dirt road before the trail crosses Bemis Stream.  They grilled hamburgers/ hotdogs, and also had chips, bananas, sodas and some sweet treats.  What a great surprise to come off Bemis Mountain to this feast.  Thank you for the awesome eats.","Stealth Camp At NOBO Mile Marker 1949.2

Half way through my business, I heard someone on the outside. In my “I’m on the john voice” I said “I’ll be finished in just a minute”.  The person on the outside backed off and walked away.  No big deal.  I wrap up my paperwork, readjust my clothes, gave my hands a good coating of hand sanitizer, unlock the door and gave the door a push.  This is when I begin to panic.  Somehow the wooden latched on the outside got turned to the closed position not allowing me to open the door.  After a few well chosen expletives, I tried the door again but it was  still locked.  At that point, I said a new string of expletives, look out the four inch quarter moon cut out in the door that every privy has and all I see are trees.  I push on the door several more times but it doesn’t budge.  Anyone who has used one of these privies knows the air inside is ninety percent methane and the rest is just stink.  Very little oxygen is available.  I started to thinking my whole day is going to be spent waiting for the next hiker to use the john.  I rattle the door again and start to yell out for someone to get me out.  Well wouldn’t you know it, all of a sudden I hear the latch on the outside move to allow the door to open.  I push on the door open and there is Snow Cap (hiker with white hair) standing there looking at me with a surprised look on his face.  If looks could kill he wouldn’t be here today.  I asked him why he locked the door while I was inside and he replied that he forgot to latch the door after he finished and he came back to latched it not knowing I was inside.  After he walked away from the privy, he realized that maybe someone slipped in before he locked the door.  After a good laugh by both of us, I finished up my packing and started my hiking day.  What a way to start the morning...","Sabbath Day Lean-to

Bigelow Mountain - elev 4145 and Avery Peak - elev 4090 are the last of the four thousand foot mountains in Maine and were in front of us today. To get to Bigelow Mountain, the trail went over South Horn Peak - elev 3831 first, just as a warm up.  By the time I summited Bigelow Mountain, the sun was shining and there were only big fluffy clouds in the sky.  The air was very clear so I could see a long way from the treeless summit.  As a matter of fact, to the northeast I could make out Katahdin and to the south I saw Mt Washington.  The pic above is facing northeast towards Katahdin.  I also shot a short video of the view which is in the video gallery.

Along the way I passed an interesting historical sign pictured above.  This area was visited by Colonel Benedict Arnold and his men on their way to Quebec back in 1775 as part of the American Revolutionary War. The AT follows the same path they took between the two carry ponds.

The walk from the East Carry Pond to the Kennebec River was mostly down hill following the Pierce Pond Stream.  The Pierce Pond Stream flowed rapidly creating several beautiful waterfalls with swimming holes at the bottom of each falls.  If it had been later in the day, I certainly would have stopped at one of these pools to take a refreshing dip.  By the time I got to the Kennebec River, it was only 11:00 am.


To cross the Kennebec River, the Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) provides a canoe ferry for hikers to cross.  The Kennebec River is only four hundred feet across and relatively shallow, but the unpredictable undercurrents make it very dangerous to swim across.  Several hikers have died over the years trying to cross the river.  The AMC took it upon themselves to make the crossing safer by paying for a ferryman to paddle the hikers and their gear across.  The pic above is of the ferryman and his canoe crossing the river.


On the north bank of the Kennebec River is the town of Caratunk ME, with a year round population of 37.  A few hundred yards from the AT, in Caratunk, is the Caratunk House B&B / Hiker Hostel.  Paul who runs the B&B has a great hiker resupply for all the NOBO’s and SOBO’s who pass by.  He also makes a delicious milkshake which is well know up and down the trail.  I took a quick shower and had my laundry cleaned while I enjoyed my milkshake and took care of my resupply duties.  My day ended at the Pleasant Pond Lean-to several miles from Caratunk.","Stealth Camp At Easy Carry Pond - NOBO Mile Marker 2030.5

My biggest treat of the day was discovering ripe blueberries on top of Moxie Bald Mountain.  I sat and gazed at the view for over an hour and as I started down the north side, I noticed small purple berries on several of the low lying bushes close to the trail.  Once I got closer to investigate, I immediately knew they were wild blueberries.  I heard from several of the locals that the top of Moxie Bald Mountain was an excellent place to look for the fruit but they all said the blueberries wouldn’t be ripe for a week or so.  Imagine my surprise when I found several ripe ones less than an arms length away.  I, of course, stopped walking and spent the next forty five minutes picking the delicious sweet treats.  If you have never had wild Maine blueberries, immediately stop what you are doing, get in your car, drive to Moxie Bald Mountain, climb the mountain, and pick a few for yourself.  I guarantee it will be worth the trip.  In a few days the mountain top will be covered with the ripe blueberries.

The trail north is the official start of the one hundred mile wilderness. On the other end is Abol Bridge which is right before you enter Baxter State Park.  The one hundred miles wilderness is a very mystical place for most hikers.  The fact that there is literally nothing for one hundred miles is very intimidating for most.  You either have to carry six to seven days of food or arrange a food drop half way.  I decided to carry six days of food which requires me to put in fifteen miles a day so I don’t run out.  As a bonus there is little to no cell reception, so if you get injured it may be a while until you get out.

Midday I stopped at the Cooper Brook Falls Lean-to for lunch and a swim in Cooper Brook. The falls were right at the lean-to’s doorstep with a nice big pool of cool water to enjoy.  I was able to convince a SOBO hiker to join me for a dip.  We both soaked our bones for fifteen minutes or so.  When we got out of the water, the other hiker looked at his feet and they were covered with small leechs with one or two medium sized ones.  I always wear my Crocs in the water, but I noticed I had a few on my feet also.  In my zest to get into the refreshing pool, I forgot that most of the ponds and streams in Maine have leechs.  Good news is - they don’t eat much and they are easy to pull off...

The day started with a beautiful sunrise over Jo-Mary Lake.  The Antlers Campsite where I hung my hammock last night is a peninsula jutting out into Jo-Mary Lake.  I was able to grab one of the sites near the end of the peninsula and position my hammock so I could look east.  I was woken at 5:00 am by the birds singing and a light breeze off the lake.  I watched the sun slowly make its way over the eastern tree line.  It was very inspiring and a wonderful way to start my morning.  The pic above is of the sunrise.


Shade Hunter decided to spend the night with Holly in Millinocket and catch up on the last two months they have been apart.  We met up again at mid day near Nahmakanta Lake where an access road crosses the AT.  To my surprise, Mr Hunter brought me a huge salad, hard boiled eggs, banana and ice tea for lunch.  Thanks Shade for the delicious trail magic.  It sure beat the two Clif bars I was planning on eating.


After lunch we both hiked hard to get to the Rainbow Stream Lean-to before dark.  We made it there just in time to set up camp before a passing thunderstorm poured rain for an hour.","Antlers Campsite

Woodford ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620551,"Call off the search dogs, I made it through the one hundred mile wilderness!  The wilderness is a very special and challenging place.  Even though most of the terrain is relatively easy, there were a few challenging technical sections.  What I enjoyed the most was the access to the many lakes and streams.  The toughest parts was walking over and around all the tree roots and rocks which cover the trail.  


The storm which passed through the area last night made the trail slippery and treacherous.  The roots on the path were especially slick.  I had to watch almost every step so I wouldn’t fall.  By early afternoon, the slight breeze and warm sunshine dried everything out nicely.  


The last three miles of today’s walk were the best of the day.  The trail pitched upwards slightly to the Rainbow Ledges - elev 1517, where there was a fantastic view of Katahdin, which was only twenty miles away.  The pic above is of Shade Hunter and me on the Rainbow Ledges with Katahdin in the distance.


I came out of the woods onto Golden Road and then walked over Abol Bridge which crosses the West Branch of the Penobscot River.  I decided to stay at Abol Bridge Campground for the evening.  The campground is located right past the bridge.  It is a private campground with a nice restaurant and resupply store.  I hung my hammock, took a long overdue shower, did my laundry and settled in at the restaurant for a huge meal and a few beers as a reward for surviving the enchanted 100 mile wilderness.","Rainbow Stream Lean-to

The AT in the park up to the Katahdin Stream Campsite is mostly flat as I walked along the West Branch of the Penobscot River and Nesowadnehunk Stream.  The Nesowadnehunk Stream has many waterfalls and interesting features which I stopped at a few.  Through hikers are required to register when we enter and leave the park.  The park set aside a specific lean-to for the hiker trash near the Katahdin Stream Campsite.  Once I found the lean-to and registered with the park ranger, I decided to take a long overdue afternoon nap before I made my dinner and got myself ready to summit Katahdin tomorrow.","Abol Bridge Campsite - NOBO Mile Marker 2176.9

I woke up extra early this morning to stow my gear and meet Shade Hunter at the Katahdin Stream ranger station.  Each hiker who climbs Katahdin must register with the Baxter Park rangers so they know you safely return the same day.  


I jumped back on the AT near the Katahdin Stream Campsite where I got off yesterday.  The total distance to the top of Katahdin, from the campsite, is a little over five miles.  The first mile or so is an easy uphill stroll and then it shoots abruptly upwards for the next three miles with an easier climb the last mile to the top.  The three mile middle section is a boulder scramble with a few very technical portions, all on a sixty degree angle.  The total elevation gain from the campsite to the peak is just over 4100 feet.  The tree line ends two miles from the summit, so the views of the surrounding wilderness were stunning as I got closer to the top.  Because I had so much adrenaline pumping for this climb, I was able to make it all the way up in two hours and forty five minutes.


As I approached the summit, I had a huge feeling of accomplishment.  All the challenging days leading up to this moment just melted away as I saw the Katahdin sign declaring this point is the “Northern Terminus of the Appalachian Trail”.


After a few moments of quiet reflection, a small toast of the remaining Woodford Reserve my friend Mark brought me, I of course, like all the other hiker trash before me, climbed up on the Katahdin sign and had my picture taken smiling from ear to ear.  


The summit of Katahdin is not where my hike ends. I will be taking the next few days off to visit family and friends, who I haven’t seen for the last two months.  I will then flip down to New York near Pawling/Wingdale and head south to finish my hike in Bland, Virginia.  I plan to be back on the trail by August 15th.  


I want to sincerely thank everyone again for all your encouraging telephone calls, texts, and notes in the guest book of this journal which I received over the last few months.  Without your help and positive thoughts, my journey would have been much more difficult.  So please keep those cards and letters coming...","Birches Lean-to

It was very nice to have over a week off the trail to go home and relax. I spent most of the time with Lisa, my loving wife, as well as visiting with my family and a few friends.  In addition, I resupplied for the next few weeks and made a few small adjustments to my equipment.


From my summit on Katahdin last Tuesday in Baxter State Park, Shade Hunter and Holly were very gracious to drop me off at the Grey Hound station in Banger ME.  From there I traveled to NYC where I left my pack at my youngest daughter’s apartment and I flew back to Cincy.  Yesterday, I reversed my steps and flew from Cincy back to NYC.  Unfortunately my flight was delayed and I didn’t get to my daughter’s apartment until after midnight.  Because I got in so late last night, I decided to take the 10:00 am train from Grand Central Terminal back to Wingdale, NY where I started my northern trek back on June 4th, but this time I officially became as a SOBO hiker.


For all those who are keeping the box score for my trip, let me recap.  On March 3rd, I started my NOBO hike at Springer Mountain, GA.  I hiked 591.7 miles to Bland, VA where I got off the trail on April 28th. After moving my youngest daughter to Manhattan at the end of May, I restarted my hike on June 4th near Wingdale, NY heading north.  On August 6th, after hiking 738.6 miles, I summited Katahdin to make my total trip mileage to date of 1330.3 (this does not include the Amicalola Falls Approach Trail).  With my restart yesterday heading south from Wingdale,  I have 861.7 miles left to get back to Bland VA.  


With Maine finished, I have completed my hike in eight states: GA, NC, TN, CT, MA, VT, NH and ME.  I have the following states remaining NY = 88 miles, NJ = 72 miles, PA = 229, MD = 41, WV = 3, and VA = 428.


After I got off the train in Wingdale, I had to hike back through the grounds of the now closed Harlem Valley State Psychiatric Hospital again.  Upon further investigation on the web, this hospital was on the leading edge of both electro-shock and lobotomy treatments in its day.  As I walked past the abandoned buildings on this sprawling 900 acre facility, I thought I could hear the faint crackle of electrical sparks and I could swear there was a smell of Thorazine wafting in the air.  I bet if you were here at night, you would see Chief, Mac and Nurse Ratchet roaming the grounds...


I made my way to the back of the hospital grounds, past the old hospital cemetery (see pic above of the cemetery gate) and I bushwhacked to the trail where I started my flip-flop hike south.  Because I got such a late start on the day, I decided to stay at the Telephone Pioneers Shelter only a little under six miles for the day.","NOBO Mile Marker 1453.4 Near Wingdale NY

The trail heading south through New York stays at 1000 feet elevation and is relatively flat as it goes into NJ.  Because it goes through a somewhat populated area, access to restaurants and roadside delis are common.  I decided to stay at the RPH Shelter for the night because of the proximity to the town of Hopewell Junction and the bonus that the local pizza restaurant delivers to the shelter.  Of course I ordered a supreme and a cannoli.  A piping hot pizza sure beats anything I have in my food bag.  To bad they don’t deliver a couple of beers - and you can bet I did ask...","Telephone Pioneers Shelter

The hike today was again up and down hovering around the one thousand foot elevation.  The highest point was Shenandoah Mountain - elev 1282.  On top of the mountain, painted on the rock, is an American flag as a 911 Memorial (see pic above).  The view from this mountain was unobstructed and I could see quite far in all directions.  


My day ended at the Greymoor Spiritual Center.  This monistary is ran by the Fransiscian Fathers as a retreat center.  The AT runs right through their expansive property.  Since the early seventies the center has let hikers camp at their ball field pavilion.  They have an outdoor shower and several porta johns for our use.  It’s quite nice to have access to such a beautiful facility.  Needless to say I took full advantage of the outdoor shower after the hot and sticky weather we have been experiencing.  A cold shower does wonders for the blood circulation...","RPH Shelter

The rest of the day was very eventful.  I was able to get a proper breakfast from the Appalachian Deli and gas station which was very close to the Spiritual Center and right on the AT.  After a huge breakfast burrito and a large cup of joe, I was set for the morning.  


Besides the usual ups and downs, the trail was fairly easy as it made its down to the Hudson River.  The trail crosses the Hudson over the Bear Mountain Bridge (see pic in photo gallery) which was built back in the early 1920’s.  At the time construction of the bridge was finished, it was the longest suspension bridge in the world.  It was quite an experience walking over this bridge which is very high over the Hudson River.  The views were very impressive up and down river (see pic in photo gallery).  At this same spot, back during the Revolutionary War, the Colonists stretched a huge steel chain across the Hudson to keep the British navy from sailing up stream and attacking the interior part of New York and beyond.


After I crossed the Bear Mountain Bridge, the trail is routed through a small zoo and local museum.  This small zoo houses local animals which have been injured and need a place to rest and recoup.   The museum has exhibits of the local geology and some very interesting artifacts of the revolutionary war which were found in the area.


Past the zoo and museum, I walked around Hessian Lake (see pic above).  This is a summer hot spot for families in the vicinity to have a picnic and enjoy the beautiful lake.  With it being a Sunday afternoon, the place was packed.  Kids screaming, dogs barking, mom’s screaming at the kids and dogs, and most of the dad’s just taking it all in.  I was longing for a grill to cook some burgers, a cooler full of cold drinks and someone to toss a football.


Just beyond Hessian Lake stands Bear Mountain - elev 1305.  The AT goes up and over the mountain.  There are just over 1000 steps that I climbed to get to the top.  Because of the heat and the long climb, by the time I got to the Perkins Memorial Tower at the top, I was exhausted.  Luckily for me there was a vending machine near the tower that had ice cold Gatorade.  I drank three 20 ounce bottles in no time flat.  After I rested for a while, I climbed to the top of the lookout tower and gazed out at the surrounding countryside.  From this vantage point I could see up and down the Hudson River valley and I could also just barely make out the NYC skyline, which is just over 30 miles away.


Later in the afternoon as I was making my way to West Mountain, I was startled by a timber rattlesnake which crossed the trail about eight feet in front of me.  It was about three feet long and rattling its tail like it meant business.  Good thing for me I hike like Frankenstein walks, with heavy feet, so it could feel the vibrations from my steps before I could see it.  Needless to say I gave the snake a wide berth as I started hiking again.


To cap off my event filled day, as I was setting up my hammock and tarp for the evening, a ragging thunderstorm decided to swing by my campsite for more than an hour.  The winds howled, trees bent and the rain came down in buckets.  I jumped into my hammock and called it a day.","Greymoor Spiritual Center - SOBO Mile Marker 780.0

The refuge was filled with wildflowers.  It was wonderful to stroll through the wet grass and listen to the symphony of birds singing and frogs croaking.


A few miles from the refuge, the trail passed within a half of a mile of Unionville NJ.  Unionville is a very small town with one stop light, a small general store, and Annabel’s Pizza restaurant.  Because the town and more specifically Annabel’s is so close to the trail, I decided to stop and have a couple slices of pizza for lunch.  I sat on Annabel’s porch and watched the hustle and bustle of this small town for a few minutes eating my delicious pizza.  On the way back to the trail, I passed the general store.  A couple of my fellow hiker trash were enjoying their lunch on the stores porch.  Of course I had to stop and catch up with the latest trail news.  These types of conversations always go better with a pint of ice cream, so I got a pint of vanilla caramel swirl and visited with the other hikers for the better part of thirty minutes.

As you might guess, it rain again in the afternoon. This time instead of trying to find a place to keep dry, I just hiked through the afternoon storm.

A double foot replacement is on my horizon if you don’t smooth out soon.  Maybe you can use all your rocks for a good purpose like building walls, steps or maybe a tower so we can see the countryside.  I hear from the NOBO hikers you smooth out after PA 501.  I want to believe this, I need to believe this for my sanity.  Let’s work this out, because I need you as much as you need me.

The Pennsylvania AT Gods must have decided to take mercy on me and smoothed out the trail south past PA 501.  My morning hike was shrouded in fog with a light sprinkle of rain every now and then.  The trail was mostly flat with only a few rocky spots.


The trail eventually descended down to the Swatara Gap where I went under Interstate 81 and over the Swatara River.  See pic of bridge which crosses the Swatara River in photo gallery.  Past the river the AT climbs up and over the Second Mountain - elev 1362 and final I stopped at the Rausch Gap Shelter for the night.  A pic of the rolling hills which lead up to Second Mountain is above.","PA 501 - SOBO Mile Marker 996.5

I was treated to an impromptu air show by the USAF mid morning as several A10’s practiced maneuver just above the treetops. These awesome Warthogs dodged, ducked, dipped, dove and dodged through the morning sky.  The pilots made the maneuvers look easy.  The show went on for about ninety minutes. After they finished and flew away, the normal quiet returned to the woods.  


When I reached my final stop at Peters Mountain Shelter, I decided to hang my hammock inside the shelter.  I only did this because there were no good campsites due to the position of the shelter on the crown of the ridge.  The shelter was one of the largest I’ve seen on the trail and there was only one other section hiker sharing the space with me.  I will enjoy being inside for the night.  A pic of the shelter is above.","Rausch Gap Shelter

After I took a shower and did my laundry, I made my way down to one of the most famous landmarks on the AT - The Doyle Hotel.  The Doyle has been a hiker hangout as long as there has been an AT.  The hotel is more like a hostel and the restaurant/bar is famous for their huge portions and cold beer.  The old place, which was built in 1880, has seen better days.  The bar is filled with AT hiker memorabilia as well as a few hikers who were passing through Duncannon for the day.  I pulled up a bar stool, had a couple of cold ones and caught up on the trail news with several of the other hikers doing the same.  A pic of the Doyle Hotel is above.","Peters Mountain Shelter

I decided to stealth camp just past the I-81 overpass and right next to a cattle pasture for the night.  There are not many choices for campsites in the valley so this was my best option.  I was lulled to sleep by the sound of speeding cars on the interstate and the fresh smell of cow pies.","Duncannon PA - SOBO Mile Marker 1043.0

I returned to the trail by 1:30 pm.  The next 8 miles were anything but flat like the valley I just left. The AT immediately shot skyward to the ridge south of Boiling Springs.  I bounced around on the ridge dipping down to cross several streams.  I decided to set up my hammock at one of the local campsites near the last stream I crossed.  All in all a great day to be in the Pennsylvania forest.","Stealth Campsite At SOBO Mile Marker 1060.1

Woodford ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622588,"Another great day of hiking in south central Pennsylvania.  Since I left Boiling Springs yesterday afternoon, the forest has been beautiful.  It is filled with very mature red and white oak trees, tulip poplar trees, maple trees, walnut trees, cherry trees, and huge pine trees.  The largest trees look to be more than a hundred years old.  The trail has its ups and downs but it is mostly flat as it continues to follow the ridges southward.


Today I passed through the Pine Grove Furnace State Park.  The “Furnace” is referring to the iron ore furnace which once stood here back in the early 1800.  This part of Pennsylvania had several of these iron ore furnaces scattered around at the beginning of the industrial revolution.  A pic of the actual furnace is in the photo gallery.


The Pine Grove Furnace State Park is considered my most hikers as the middle point of the AT. Because it is the half way point, it calls for a celebration.  As with most big occasions on the trail, there is a time honored tradition to celebrate the accomplishment with a challenge - the half gallon challenge to be exact.  The challenge is to eat one half gallon of ice cream in one sitting - preferably before it all melts.  Being the hikers trash that I am, I could not skip this opportunity to prove myself.  The ice cream is purchased at the Pine Grove Furnace General Store and should be consumed on the picnic tables in front of the store for all to witness.  Because the store only sells containers that are forty eight ounces, you have to also purchase an additional pint to make it a full half gallon.  I chose raspberry for the forty eight ounce container and Neapolitan for the pint.  As most of you know, over the last months that I’ve been on the trail, I have enjoyed eating a pint of ice cream whenever I can.  By doing this I have been in training for just this challenge.  Consider these warmup pints as light toe touches before the big match.  Without much effort, I crushed the challenge. The raspberry went down without much effort and the Neapolitan took some work, but it also got consumed. All in all it took me about forty five minutes to eat the entire half gallon.  After eating all that ice cream, I may just wait a week or so to have any more.  A pic of the effort is above.


After I finished the challenge, I visited the official AT Museum which is located next to the store.  It has the history of how the trail got started as well as some interesting artifacts from the trail history.  A pic of the museum is in the photo gallery.","Campsite At SOBO Mile Marker - 1076.7

My day ended at the Tumbling Run Shelter where I hung my hammock for the night.

It was repaired and returned to its original form by the CCC back in 1934 - 1936.  Back in the Civil War it was used as a signal station by the Union Army to monitor the surrounding countryside.  The overlook from the top is very impressive with views of the Maryland, southern Pennsylvania and eastern West Virginia.  A pic of the monument is above.


After I passed the Washington Monument State Park, the trail flattened out as I stayed on the ridges until it descended down to the Potomac River and followed the C&O Canal Towpath.  The Towpath is next to the C&O Canal which was finished back in 1850 and ran from Washington DC to Cumberland, MD a total of 184 miles.  The Canal was closed in 1924 and in 1938 the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal National Historical Park was established.  The AT follows the Towpath for 2.6 miles until it crosses the Potomac River and into Harpers Ferry, WV.


On my way down to the Towpath, I came across an unexpected forest delicacy - ripe Pawpaws.  The Asimina triloba, is the largest edible wild fruit native to the North America. It is found in the eastern US from New England to the Gulf of Mexico and as far west as the Mississippi River.  The fruit is no larger than a half of an average size banana.  It has a green hull and the soft flesh is orangish in color with large brown seeds.  The flavor of the fruit is a mix of mango and banana.  There is a two week period when the fruit is still on the tree and ripe.  Past that point it falls to the forest floor and is usually over ripe.  I found quite a few trees with ripe fruit so I stopped and ate at least eight of these delicious treats.  A pic of the ripe pawpaws on the tree is in the photo gallery.


Because I planned to take a zero tomorrow, I booked two nights at the Harpers Ferry Hostel.  The hostel is half way down the Towpath just west of Knoxville MD and east of Harpers Ferry.  After a nice dinner at a nearby restaurant, I decided to call it a day.","Pine Knob Shelter

Because Harpers Ferry was very important in the lead up to the Civil War, the park highlights the roll John Brown played in the anti slavery movement.  As you will recall from your eighth grade American history class, John Brown lead an army of twenty one on October 16, 1859 to seize the US Armory located in Harpers Ferry.  He was going to use the weapons from the armory to free slaves throughout the south.  Unfortunately for him, shortly after he gained control of the armory, the US Marines showed up and captured John and his renegade soldiers.  John was later hanged for treason, murder, and inciting slaves to rebel.  Brown’s actions had brought the issue of slavery to the forefront of the nation and civil war seemed inevitable.


After I visited many of the historical sites at the park, I continued my slack  pack north back to the hostel.  After leaving Harpers Ferry, the AT crosses over the Potomac River and down the C&O Canal Towpath.  I followed the trail until I arrived back at the hostel.  There I spent the rest of the evening with several other hikers and turned in early.","ATC Offices - Harpers Ferry - SOBO Mile Marker 1167.1

Today I started the infamous Roller Coaster.  This is a 13.4 mile long section of the AT which has 11 peaks of various heights from a few hundred feet to over five hundred feet in elevation.  The pic above is the welcome sign to the roller coaster section of the trail.  This part of the trail is also very rocky and steep in sections.  11 peaks over 13.5 miles may not sound like much but when you are trying to climb over one knowing there is another peak just waiting for you, it will mentally wear you out.  After the third peak I climbed over, I was at Snickers Gap. There is a small diner, just three tenths of a mile off trail, called the Horseshoe Curve Restaurant.  The temptation to stop was too much to pass up.  After a delicious hamburger, homemade hand cut french fries and a couple of ice cold PBR’s, I was ready to tackle a few more rollers coasters peaks.  By the time it was 5:00 pm, I had enough of the coaster and decided to get off for the evening.

Shenandoah National Park (SNP) is unique to any other place on the trail.  The 200,000 acre park which was founded in 1935, is fairly skinny and runs mostly north and south.  The most prominent feature of the park, besides the mountainous terrain of the Blue Ridge Mountains, is Skyline Drive.  It runs the 105 mile length of the park and is part of the Blue Ridge Parkway which goes from SNP to the Great Smoky Mountain NP.  A total of 469 miles.  There are five places like Elkwallow Wayside on the Skyline Drive which are spread out relatively evenly throughout the park.  The other four areas have some combination of grocery stores, showers, laundry camping/hotel and restaurant/grill.  They are Skyland, Big Meadows, Lewis Mountain, and Loft Mountain.  The AT runs close to Skyline Drive for the entire length of the park.  The Waysides are a treat for the through hikers because we do not need to carry as much food due to the grocery stores and restaurants.  I plan on stopping at the remaining four Waysides over the next few days for both hot meals as well as resupply items as I need them.  After I finished my breakfast, I ordered a turkey wrap to eat later in the day.

The AT took me past Sawmill Run Overlook - elev 2200, where I took the above pic looking southwest.  Beyond the overlook, the trail makes a few uphill treks as it passed the Calf Mountain Shelter - elev 2668, and then finally downward to the Park’s boarder.  All in all the twenty plus mile day was mostly easy and very relaxing.  I made prior arrangements to stay at Stanimal’s 328 Hostel in Waynesboro, VA for the next two nights.  After my peregrination from Harpers Ferry through SNP, I felt like I needed a zero day to step off the trail and rest for a day.","Blackrock Hut

Waynesboro was the site of the last battle of the Civil war to be fought in the Shenandoah Valley.  The Confederate Army was beaten badly here on March 2, 1865 and they never returned to the area afterwards.  After the Civil War, Waynesboro became the junction of two railroads - the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad which ran east and west, and the Norfolk and Western Railroad that ran north and south.  The two rail lines met in Waynesboro dubbing the town with the nickname of the Iron Cross.  Other than the usual restaurants and chain stores, Waynesboro seems to be content to be the town that is located at the south entrance of the Shenandoah National Park.


Throughout the day, I eventually did my laundry and made my way to Walmart to get my resupply for next week on the trail.  A very lazy day indeed.","Rockfish Gap - SOBO Mile Marker 1328.3

After lunch I made the decision to hike to Ried’s Gap and go to the Devil’s Backbone (DB) Brewpub for the night. The DB has a hundred acre recreation park just five miles from the trail.  The majority of the compound is for camping and they of course have a restaurant and brew house.  They also host quite a few music events throughout the year.  The DB makes regular pickups for the hikers on the AT during the day and offer free camping and a fantastic hiker breakfast in the morning.  I caught the late shuttle and was at the DB by 6:30 pm.  Once I set up my hammock, had a light dinner, and stowed my gear, I went to the Brewpub for a few beers.  On the walk over to the Brewpub, I bumped into several of my fellow hikers - Smudge, TJ, Captain, Wag, and Disco, who I hadn’t seen since Harpers Ferry.  We all enjoyed the evening off trail having a few beers, swapping trail stories and discussing our adventures with the locals.","Rockfish Gap - SOBO Mile Marker 1328.3

Today I had a big day climbing over two of the highest mountains I’ve had to hike over since I left Maine. The first mountain I summited was Three Ridges Mountain - elev 3937.  After a very fun evening at the DB, the climb to the top of Three Ridges was painful.  There were very few switchbacks in the trail so it was almost straight up the entire way.  On the way up, I was treated to several views from cliffs that were stunning.  The pic above is from Three Ridges looking south towards The Priest.  Once I hit the summit, I had a long lunch break and even took a short snooze in the warm sun.


The three mile hike down the back of Three Ridges was just as tough as the hike to the summit. It was mostly very rocky with no switchbacks.  At the bottom of the mountain I refilled my water bottles at the Tye River before moving on.  The next challenge was hiking up The Priest - elev 4063.  The Priest is the first 4000+ foot peak I will encounter over the next couple of weeks.  The journey to the top of the Priest starts at the Tye River - elev 970 and goes up over 3000 feet in elevation in just over four miles.  You can bet I was confessing all my sins to The Priest on the long and difficult hike to the summit.  Once I was at the summit, the reward was magnificent views, both north and south, of the Appalachian Mountains.  I decided to end my hike for the day at The Priest Shelter which just north of the summit.  After a quick dinner, I quickly fell asleep after the strenuous day.","Ried’s Gap - SOBO Mile Marker 1347.4

Past Cole Mountain, the AT dipped and then went up and over Bald Knob - elev 4059.   From the top of Bald Knob down to Brown Mountain Creek Shelter, where I stopped for lunch, the elevation change was 2700 feet in just five miles.  Needless to say it was a very long way down.  I spent an hour eating my lunch and talking to the other hikers who passed the shelter.  As I was packing up to leave, I heard the distant rumble of thunder.  I tried to check the weather radar app on my phone but I could not get any reception due to the surrounding mountains.  I set off down the trail again hoping the storm would stay to the north of me.  Just as I got no more than a mile away from the shelter, all hell broke loose.  The wind howled, the lightning and thunder roared and the rain came down in buckets.  I tried hiding from the rain behind one of the many big trees next to the trail but that was useless.  Within minutes I was soaked.  As every hiker knows you have to make a decision to either get your rain gear out or just get wet. Because it had been so hot and humid up to this point of the day, I decided to get wet.  The cool rain actually felt good as I continued to march down the trail.  After twenty five minutes of driving rain it eventually stopped.  The sun came out shortly after the rain quite, and the heat and humidity returned.  I finished my afternoon hike still soaked from head to toe.  I decided to stealth camp just short of the summit of Rice Mountain - elev 2166, for the evening.  Hopefully tomorrow there won’t be another afternoon monsoon.","Stealth Camp At Hog Camp Gap - SOBO Mile Marker 1377.2

This huge milestone in my journey happened this morning as I hiked up from the James River valley.  If everything goes as planned, I will walk out of the deep woods on Saturday, October 12th.


While I’m typing this journal entry on my phone this evening from the comfort of my hammock, the question that pops into my head is - what kind of fool walks 2000 miles when he has a perfectly good car sitting in my driveway?  If anyone knows the answer to that, please let help me understand.  This mystery has plagued me the entire day...


The hike out of the James River valley was long and strenuous.  It rained on and off last night while I stayed at Stanimal’s Hostel in Glasgow, so this morning it was foggy and very humid.  It felt more like swimming up the mountain than hiking.  The AT went from the elevation of 680 feet at the James River up to 3064 feet at Highcock Knob, in just under nine miles.  From there it continued to rise up as it made its way to Thunder Hill Shelter - elev 3917, where I decided to stop for the day.  Because of the heavy fog, I didn’t have any views the entire way.  Even though it has rained on and off over the last few days, finding water on the trail continues to be a big issue.  Over the fourteen miles I hiked today, there was only one spring which still had water accessible.  The other five water sources were all dry.  I’m hoping the further south I get in Virginia, there will be more springs and streams that are viable.","US 501 - Glasgow VA - SOBO Mile Marker 1405.3

Past the top of Apple Orchard Mountain, the AT made its way downwards for eight miles to Bryant Ridge Shelter - elev 1277.  At the shelter I refilled my water bottles, relaxed and ate my lunch.  For the next ten miles the trail went back upwards to 2500 feet where it leveled off and I found a stealth campsite for the evening. 


Tomorrow I will walk into the town of Daleville VA, for a couple of days of R&R.  The only thing standing between me and Daleville is twenty two miles of trail.  The weather is supposed to be a repeat of today so I will have to be diligent with my water and rest breaks throughout the day.","Thunder Hill Shelter

I have to thank my wife Lisa for putting up with my absence over the last six months.  I know it has been tough on her to be by herself most of this time.  She has been very supportive and patient as I have fulfilled one of my bucket list items.  I also have to thank my family and close friends for their support and daily encouragement.  Without them, my hike would have been impossible.  I want to thank the readers of this journal for all of the positive comments they left for me in the guest book.  At last count there have been over 115,000 views of this journal.  I hope I have encouraged several of the readers to fulfill their dreams and take on an adventure of their own.

Everyone who decides to through hike the AT does it for a reason.  Some are trying to find something.  Some are trying to forget something.  The experience will change you.  The reason for my hike was to hit the reset button after working thirty four years in corporate America.  I lost a huge piece of who I am over those years and I wanted to find it again.  I can honestly say that after spending 179 days and nights in the woods, I believe I have found that person I use to be.  Life is so easy on the trail - you get up in the morning, start hiking until you stop and then go to sleep. I learned how to live one day at a time again.  I also realized that if I can thrive on a daily basis with only the items in my backpack, I need to continue to keep my life simple and uncomplicated.  I will be back in the woods from time to time to recharge my batteries and rekindle the love I have for the outdoors.
