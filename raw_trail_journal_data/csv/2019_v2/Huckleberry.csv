Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607715,"My journey started this morning at 9:00 am.  My wife took 2 kids to school on her way into work, one home sick, one still getting ready, and one driving me to the train station (with the sicko).  
From the train....with my bright green cut down lawnmower box serving duty to protect my pack for the road, I headed to the greyhound station in downtown Dallas, TX.  This was not my most favorite way to spend close to 3 hours, but in a strange way, it solidified the fact that my journey, my adventure had started...and I liked it... 
A few things I've picked or obvserved worth mentioning from possibly the only place on earth better to people watch than a Wal-Mart...A downtown Greyhound station..
Guy with a make shift monicle, traveling with a man in drag who was not quite able to hide facts in his yoga pants outfit...they seemed like a happy couple though...Runaway girl lying about her age with a ticket to somewhere, in filthy clothes, and appears to be vomit all down her left side...I'm sad about that...and grateful for my family...I now need to wash my sandals before I get to the trail to get off all the stuck on ...crap...from just walking through the station...Not once did they check my ID.  Not to get on the bus.  Not to place a large, suspicious and heavy box in the underbelly of the bus.  Just downright frightening.   I'm going with....My name is Huckleberry.(they wouldn't have cared...)While standing in a crowded corridor, with a 100 or so folks in line, I overheard a great conversation...regarding phones.  It was an elderly lady speaking to a younger woman about her super cheap phone that her kids make fun of her for having.  It was not a smart phone like everyone wants her to have....It was her last line that hit me.  She said that phones were making everything worse, not better....and that ""..the less I know the better...""  that may be my new moto...  I was glad that my Franken-Box containing my backpack was a great chair for this nice lady after our buses had an hour delay.  If you have to wear basketball shorts under your pants to cover your but because your pants are falling down....it's because your pants are too big.  Take the next size down next time...or simply sinch the freaking belt you are wearing a few knotches...we all don't need to see this...
I eventually got on an hour late....and piled onto the bus right behind James....who just so happens to be heading exactly where I am....and starting the trail on the same day...
...small world...
...I'm officially on my way to knowing less...(as soon as I post this entry...)",,"Gainseville, Ga","Mar 07, Thu",871
Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607722,I never thought I would find him...but I did!  I found the single human being left on the planet that did not know you were not supposed to smoke cigarettes in a public transportation...like the Greyhound.  The bus driver threatened to pull over and call the cops.......meanwhile the guy next to me is complaining that the driver isn't taking breaks....we've been on the road for just over an hour...,,View Entry,"Mar 07, Thu",0

Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607760,"I am heading out of Atlanta.  Heading to Gainseville where I will have a shuttle to take me to the approach trail in Amicalola Falls.  I just got a bit nervous actually...Do I have enough gear? I feel certain that I do.  Do I have too much gear?  I feel certain that I do.  Do I have the right gear?  Less certain.I find that I'm nervous of what others will think of my choices.  I partly blame Youtube for that.  The hiking community on youtube has been where I spend a lot of time.  I love all that I have received as far as perceived knowledge and entertainment.. but it does sort of put pressure on people who don't conform.  I don't think it is intended in most cases, but it is just the world we live in.  I'd like to change that in my world...for me.  My gear is not mainstream.  It is like me...just a bit different...so why am I caring.  I honestly do not know.  I just need to get on the trail.I just need to walk!",,View Entry,"Mar 08, Fri",0
Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607782,"24 hours in a greyhound was quite an experience.  While trying to be as thrifty as possible, I decided on greyhound for my pre approach because....well...it was a bad decision.  I have miles with AA to have flown out, but they were going to charge me $80, to use my ""free"" miles.  Out of protest, I chose Greyhound that could do it for $65...wow!  How can they do it?  The answer...barely...Here is where the whirlwind comes in...Due to not wanting to have to pee on that bus, I drank very little water, and ate very little food...and slept even less.  That worked ok...for sitting, however I hopped straight off the bus into my shuttle to Amicalola.  On that ride, I got an absolute lesson on ....hmmm...perhaps I should have planned a little.  Once we arrived it was a rush to get my picture under the arch, and into my AT 101 class at the visitor center.  It was rushed because it was raining...a few minutes later and i was walking slong the approach trail with the falls in site.  I was still trying to determine if I had everything from the bus....while walking and checking all my pockets and pouches...About half way up the stairs to the falls...I realize I think my water filter fell out of my bag at some point....getting on or off the bus...in or out of my shuttle ride...or the multiple places i put down my gear at the visitor center.Immediately I was stressed....emptied everything in my pack....twice....cant find it.  After a few minutes, I was resolved to boiling water for .....man a few day...not sure....but I wasnt getting back on the bus..I made it to the top, emptied my pack again.  No filter.  I called the lodge and the nearby Inn...no luck.My goal for the day was to get just outside the park boundries, so I could camp along the trail...and literally made camp just after the boundry.  As I was racing the Thunderstorm to get my hammock and tarp up....I find my filter.  I'm not going to die....Then....I was hungry....from my Greyhound fast, and I was thirsty, now that I wasnt going to need to be on rations, and I was tired....from riding this whirlwind that dropped me on this mountain.But....I'm right on schedule.   Tomorrow is my birthday, and I will be hiking on the appalachian trail....if this lightning right over my tarp doesn't get me first...","Gainseville, Ga

Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607918,"So, the down side to this journal is that you need service to post....most places I've stopped do not.  I will catch up my days as soon as I have good dervice.  We got caught today by a surprise storm which prevented me from attempting Blood mountain and getting to Neals Gap.  Perhaps I'll post from there tomorrow!  Anyone know if this jornal has the ability to write offline and then sync up with service...like a mobile app or something?-Jerrod","Gerrard Gap

Huckleberry,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608029,"I have found, that from my journey to GA, to the beginning of my hike, I've put too much thought into trying to capture stuff for others...I'm done doing that...plus it is too dang hard.  I dont like to keep looking for signal and trying to post.  You guys that do this for an entire hike are amazing!  That is not me.:)","Blue Mountain Shelter
