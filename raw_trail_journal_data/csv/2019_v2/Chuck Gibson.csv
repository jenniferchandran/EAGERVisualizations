Chuck Gibson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607639,"Once I decided to hike the AT I then thought now what ? hahaha. I told my wife and we picked a starting date. In the begining I walked alot to strengthen my legs. Soon I realized there was alot to do besides that. At first we walked and hiked alot together. After a few months and alot of thinking I wasn't sure about leaving her at home for so long. We talked more and more and she helped me prepare. Finally one day we decided to hike the trail together. That is when we became ' Salt and Pepper ' We have bought some new gear and planned, planned and replanned. Our family and friends have been very supportive. As the start date draws near we seem to have more and more to do. The trail is calling and we must go.",,View Entry,"Mar 06, Wed",0
Chuck Gibson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607938,"Hey everybody! Salt here.

 It's been a hectic week getting things ready to go. We've been rushing around doing this and that and the other thing; seeing family and making our preparations. It's a hard thing to shut a house up for six months. We are really looking forward to being out on the trail and in the woods! I cannot wait! So right now, I'm busy getting apples ready for dehydrating and then I just have to pack up some resupply boxes. Tomorrow we'll mail them off and get the packs all set to go. We are out of here on Friday!!",,View Entry,"Mar 11, Mon",0

The closer we get the more there seems to be we have to do. It's all been challenging and fun though. Family and friends have all been very supportive. We have prepared and made plans prepared and made more plans. But eventually the big day will be here and off we will go. Am I a little anxious yes but that's okay.

Chuck Gibson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608242,The big day has finally arrived! We spent the night in Durham North Carolina with my sister Cassidy and now the three of us are headed for Amicalola State Park. We're going to get all signed in and see if we have enough time to climb the steps by the waterfall today. We'll be sleeping in the tent tonight and hiking up to Springer Mountain tomorrow! Tuesday we begin the hike!,,View Entry,"Mar 17, Sun",0
Chuck Gibson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608595,"Like all first days, this one was a little chaotic. We set off around 10 a.m. and hiked up the waterfall trail. There were 600 steps! It wasn't as bad as we thought. Took a break up top and had a snack and water. Then off we went! Half a mile later, someone said they had seen a sandal like Pepper's on the trail. Sure enough, he only had one. He went back to look for it, but never found it. We got started again and made it to High Shoals Road for lunch, 3.2 miles. Lunch was good! My orange went rolling down the trail and we thought it was gone, but it stopped. We went a little faster after lunch and reach the spring and filled up with water. Then down to the shelter where we found most of the people who had passed us today! It was cold and windy, so we ate and then went to bed. Beautiful sunset tonight and the moon is close to full!",,Black Gap Shelter,"Mar 18, Mon",7.30
Chuck Gibson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608597,"Left Black Gap at 10 and were on Springer Mountain at 11. Signed the log and took pictures. We each chose a rock to carry from Springer Mountain to Mount Katahdin, following tradition. We started down the mountain at 11:30. There were a lot of people on the trail all day. It's spring break and just a popular place. The trail was very pretty with pine trees and rhododendrons and went beside a creek quite a ways! We stopped at Stover Creek shelter for lunch. Our eggs and oranges are keeping well in this cold. Temps were in the fifties today but low 30s at night. After lunch, we continued with our downhill a while longer then started to climb. There were a few hard climbs but we just took it slow. A lot of the trail was level. Got to Hawk Mountain shelter about 6:15. This place is full of college kids! They had a fire and were noisy for a while but quieted down about 9. Ready for another day!","Black Gap Shelter

Chuck Gibson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608958,"This was a hard day. It was warmer, even hot during the afternoon. There were five or six hills to climb and they weren't easy! Sassafras Mountain was the hardest. It was a mile up! We stopped for lunch about 3/4 of the way up when we found the world's longest lunch log! The climb down was just as bad -  steep and full of loose rock. The climb down from the previous hill was just as bad! Our spirits were sagging and we were running out of water at Justus Mountain, but it turned out not so bad. It didn't go up all the way but around the side of the mountain. And there was a spring on the backside! We stopped and got a good drink, then had a real pleasant downhill till we came to Justus Creek where we decided to camp. We are right beside the creek listening to the sound of water as we fall asleep.","Hawk Mountain Shelter

Chuck Gibson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608961,"We were up early this morning, 6:30. Still it was 10 when we set off. We are just not early starters. It didn't take long to get to Gooch Shelter where we met Cassidy who had come up early for the privy. The trails were really pretty all day. Salt's knee was hurting and she couldn't walk fast. We all have sunburn and cracks on our fingers and hands. It's just been rough on our skin. We ran into Trail magic at Gooch Gap where they were handing out apples! We saw this pretty little flower just coming up when we stopped for lunch. After lunch, we pressed on and it became cloudy with a cold wind blowing. Just before Woody Gap, it started to rain. We put on pack covers and rain jackets. Got to Woody Gap at 4 and called for a shuttle. We went back to Amicalola State Park and got Cassidy's car. Then we were off to a motel for the night. Pizza, showers and warmth. Tomorrow we start again at Woody Gap.","Justus Creek

Chuck Gibson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608963,"Up early in the motel this morning. After breakfast, we went through the packs and gave some things to Cassidy to take home for us. Then we went to Walmart and did a little resupply. We had lunch in the car and then drove up to Woody Gap. A man and his wife were doing trail magic. She had been hiking 20 years before and was almost killed crossing the road to get to trail magic. So they come back there to do trail magic for others. They gave us some fudge, which was delicious! Started hiking around 2. The trails were great although it was first cold and then hot when we got away from the Gap. We went up to Preaching Rock which has a great view of the mountains! Then off through the woods. We stopped at another viewpoint with a campsite that we loved! Got to Lance Creek around 4:30 and the campground was full, so we found a spot on the side of the trail by a small brook. We are about 10 feet from the water. We spent one last evening with Cassidy. She goes back in the morning.","Woody Gap

Chuck Gibson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609698,"Got up for the bathroom early this morning and woke Pepper up. We were talking, then Cassidy appeared at the door. She hopped in the tent and the three of us talked for a while. When we were all packed up, we left in one direction and she left in the other direction. It was kind of sad! We left about 9:30 and did the first couple of miles with no problem. Stopped for a break at Jarrad Gap and again to get water at Slaughter Creek. Had lunch on top of Blood Mountain. There were people everywhere! After lunch, we started down and it was slow going due to all the rocks. Pepper lost his balance and hit some rocks, but was okay. Finally made it to Neel Gap at 4:45. We picked up our resupply box and my new water filter. The packs were heavy after adding all the new things! We had pizza at Neel Gap, then headed up the mountain to a campsite. It's a little bit warmer tonight!","Lance Creek

Chuck Gibson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609695,"Up early this morning, 6:30, but it took a while to pack up and it was after 9 when we left. We hiked to Bull Gap and then about .2 down to a spring. We filtered water and had breakfast there. We have mocha now and it is good! After breakfast, we set off again and climbed some mountains. We saw a lot of the people we climbed Blood Mountain with but they eventually left us behind. We are rather slow! There was a long downhill after lunch which ended in a parking lot. We crossed that and had a very steep uphill. Quite tiring! We carried water from the last stream up to our campsite, as it has none. Spaghetti was for dinner and it was delicious! Hung the bear bag. We are the only ones here tonight.","Neel Gap

Chuck Gibson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609632,"The day started out great  when Dine -n-Dash passed our campsite and asked if we'd like some fruit!  He gave us oranges. We got started about 9:45 and made good time. The trails were pretty good and we reached Low Gap before we knew it. We stopped for lunch and water at a flowing water source. Really nice! Most of the afternoon we walked in a light rain. When we had picked a good campsite for the day, the rain had mostly let up. We set up our tent and put a few things inside. We then started making dinner. We had decided to have ramen noodles. We were going to make two packs, one at a time. When one serving was almost ready then came the downpour! Salt quickly got in the tent. When her dinner was ready I handed it to her and she ate in the tent. I then made my serving and it started to rain harder and harder! I quickly put the cooking gear away, ate my soup and got in the tent. Our things in the tent were pretty well set up. I quickly changed into some dry clothes and we were both soon tucked in our sleeping bags and warm. We both slept well.","White Oak Stamp Gap

Chuck Gibson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609728,"Woke up late this morning - 7:15 a.m. and didn't want to get out of the tent . Last night we experienced our first downpour while hiking. So today we decided to take part of the day off and go into town, Hiawassee, Georgia, to be exact. We used the last of our first fuel can  heating the water for breakfast while we slowly packed up. Our usual breakfast is oatmeal and yogurt with a cup of mocha .  Finally set off just before 11 and made our way across a very narrow rocky path along the mountainside. I stopped to get water even though it was down a steep hillside. It was slippery and wet!  When we got to the shelter, there was water right next to the trail! Clammy was at the shelter and we visited for about an hour before heading down to Unicoi Gap.  That trail was very rocky also in parts but we made good time. Got a shuttle into town with a young couple. We are staying at the Budget Inn. We have had our dinner and done laundry and dried everything out. Tomorrow at 9 a.m. we will return to the trail to continue our hike. We will also be rearranging our backpacks. We are having a good time.","Red Clay Gap

We went next door for breakfast and had eggs and biscuits and bacon. Pepper had hash browns and I had grits. When we were done, we found someone had paid for our meal! Caught the shuttle at 11 and were hiking by 11:50. The first mountain was Rocky Mountain and it had so many steps! When they finally stopped, there was nice trail the rest of the way up and most of the way down. Next we climbed Tray Mountain which had a point at the top. Got to the shelter around 5:30 and are sleeping in the shelter. It's kind of cold tonight, so don't know if we will be warm or not. Saw Jingles here. The young folks are having a campfire and marshmallows tonight.","Unicoi Gap

Chuck Gibson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609739,"It was a cold night, but we had a beautiful sunrise! The moon was also up late in the night. Got started just before 10 and it was nice trail most of the day. Ups and downs, but nothing too rough and we only had 2.8 miles left at lunch. We passed Swag of the Blue Ridge which some people say is the beginning of the Blue Ridge Mountains.Then came Kelly Knob which went straight up and up and up! It was a mile of steep climb with no relief in the hot sun and took forever. Very little shade and only a few spots to sit. But when we got to the top, it was an easy down again to the shelter. The shelter was very crowded with probably 30 tents and the shelter full and very noisy. We found a flat spot and got water at a little stream nearby and had hearty bean soup for dinner. It was delicious!","Tray Mountain Shelter

Chuck Gibson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609726,"Today we started from Deep Gap Shelter at 10 a.m. On our hike today, we saw a lot of different water sources and took some pictures and videos. Overall, the trail wasn't too hard and I can feel my legs getting stronger. Stopped to enjoy an overlook and had a nice break. We met a few hikers along the way, some we had seen before and one dayhiker going the opposite direction. We made it to the Top of Georgia hostel and picked up our second resupply box. Their fresh coffee was a great treat. We had hot dogs and chips for lunch and then got a shuttle back to the trailhead since we had walked in 1/2 mile. After the shuttle ride, we were back on the trail. We came across a couple more good water sources and decided to just pick a campsite instead of trying to get to the next shelter. We had a good dinner of tuna and cheese wraps and got our site all set up for the evening. We got our food bag hung between two trees, relatively easy. We took some pictures and videos and now we're calling it a day. We've made our plans for the next few days. The supply box added a few pounds to our bags but we have a lot of great things now to eat. That's it for now.","Deep Gap Shelter

Chuck Gibson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609736,"Somebody came down the trail around 5 in the morning. They must have seen our bear bag hanging over the trail because they were shining lights all over the tent. We had a good breakfast and packed up and set off around 10. It was a long way up the first hill, but then we went down to a little spring where we got water. Hiked up another hill past Plum Orchard Shelter and down to a gap for lunch. Finished the sausage and cheese. Then up another hill to another spring and more water. The trails were pretty nice after that and we made our way to the state line and into North Carolina! The campground was just past that and we got set up on a ridge and had mashed potatoes for dinner. Both of us were pretty tired and got in bed as soon as we could. Storms all night and the wind was really howling. The folks next to us had a huge tarp which came loose and made a terrible noise til they got it secured again.","Cowart Gap

Chuck Gibson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609721,"31 March 2019. We walked from Bly Gap today to Deep Gap, 6.8 miles. Good morning, everyone! Started with leftover drizzle from the trees and a cold wind from last night's storm. The trail led us up a hillside which just went on and on. Early afternoon was rather rough for me and tiring. Later in the afternoon, it seemed to go a little bit better but the wind blew hard and cold most of the day. We did find a good campsite, got our water for tonight and tomorrow morning, and had hot ramen soup and tea to drink. It was great! Hopefully, the wind doesn't blow as hard tonight. Supposed to get rather cold tonight.","Bly Gap

Although it was cold, it didn't feel so bad because the wind quit blowing! I have cracks on both thumbs and one finger. Pepper's hands are worse. We climbed Standing Indian Mountain today and it wasn't nearly as bad as we thought it might be. Switchbacks all the way up. We went to the summit which was grassy and beautiful! Daffodils and a view. Stopped at a sunny rock along the trail for lunch. That was nice. Then at a spring for water. The afternoon got long doing the ins-and-outs of the mountain, but finally started climbing up to the shelter. Got here about 5:30. Chili for dinner was delicious! The number of trees that have been blown down in recent storms is amazing and devastating! The trail crews have done great clearing the trails.","Deep Gap

Tomorrow we are hiking into Franklin which will be about a 7.2 mi hike. We're going to spend a couple of days there while we resupply and catch up on our journey entries and get more things posted. We had a good hike today. The first part was easy up and down. The latter part of the day was more steep and climbing over rocks. We went to the Ranger fire tower at the top of Albert Mountain. The view was really worth the climb! We got into the shelter today about 5:30. We had a good meal - Spanish rice and tea and good conversation with other hikers. We're meeting a lot of people from around the country and from other countries. So as the sun sets, we are going to stay in a shelter tonight instead of the tent. It's a 2-level shelter.

A local Baptist Church provides a free breakfast for hikers every morning in April and we will be going tomorrow.

They provide the service every morning during April. It is wonderful! They're doing a great job and have been doing it for 12 years. After breakfast, we came back to the hostel and got a ride to urgent care to have my feet checked since I am having trouble with my toes. I lost two big toenails and one small and apparently have an infection in my right big toe. The doctor cleaned it all up and gave us guidance on how to take care of the infection, including oral medications. After the visit to the doctor, we did some laundry and some shopping and had lunch. We got a shuttle back near the hostel and then had dinner. When we got back, I took the bandages off my feet and soaked them in water and epsom salts. I have to keep my foot elevated as much as possible and leave it open to the air. Except for my foot issue, everything is going well and it has been a great trip!","

Zen was gone and it was just us, Ghost, and Twenty-five. Uploaded pictures and did some puzzles. Later Zen came back and was philosophizing about his life and what he might do with it. We watched a show together and then he left. Pepper and I had dinner and made sandwiches for tomorrow then watched another show. Got our packs together finally and we are ready to get some sleep.

Got packed up and got a shuttle to Winding Stair Gap. On the trail at 10 as usual! The trail was kind of nice. Not as much up as I was expecting, so we made pretty good time. Saw a beautiful waterfall right at the beginning. Stopped for a break after 1.5 miles and then kept on until we saw the shelter sign. We decided to keep on until the north entrance and came down that way. A tree broke just as we were passing which was a little alarming! The path to the shelter was down and rocky - should be fun to climb in the morning! Got to the shelter around 1 and had lunch and got set up. Weird to sit around all afternoon.

Chuck Gibson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610585,"Again started the day with a great meal of hot oatmeal, raisins, and nuts. Also had a good hot cup of mocha. We then got packed up and headed back up the hill to the trail. I stopped to talk to another hiker just before getting on the trail. I think his trail name was Mechanic. He had camped there with his dog and had been at the the same shelter the day before. He said he had heard a bear crashing through the woods the night before but all was well. We were then back on the trail looking for new adventures. After hiking for a while we came across a group of about six hikers. We met a lady from Sweden with this group. We talked briefly and were on our way. A little later we saw a couple of day hikers and the other group then caught up and passed us. That's how it goes many days :-) We had lunch on a couple of logs that were across the path from each other. It was nice but people kept going between us! Go figure. After lunch the trail led us up to Wayah Bald. There was a gravel road running beside the trail for a ways but we climbed the steep hill instead. After a couple hours we came to a girl sitting on a rock. She hopped up so Pepper could sit down and Salt went up the trail to the spring at the road to get water. A little more hill and we were finally at the top. Just before we got there Pepper stumbled and cut his hand. We went to the restroom on top to wash his hand but they were pit toilets. Big disappointment. We used our own soap and water and cleaned his hand. Just then it started to rain! We hopped in the bathroom and waited there while the storm passed. Then we walked up and saw the fire tower and from there we went down to the shelter. The shelter area was crowded and we took the flattest spot we could find. It was not very flat! 25 Mile camped next to us. We had a great night sleep, slope or not! Wayah Bald Shelter was very nice but full. There were about 30 tents in the area. All the good flat spots were taken so we slept on a bit of a slant that night. 25 Mile took some pictures of us and a short video of us eating dinner for her journal.

Still, the next few miles went easily on some very pretty trail and we had gone four miles by lunch. It was hot after lunch and we were going uphill, so slow going! When we reached Cold Spring Shelter, we stopped for a break to cool off. Finally got going again and made it up the hill. We went up to the summit of Rocky Bald, which was beautiful! We had to walk up a huge expanse of rock face, which had flowers growing all over the edges. You could see forever from the top! We camped at Big Branch Campsite with Hurricane from New Zealand.

We could pick out Clingman's Dome! We're on the way! Went down and got some water from an old stone cistern, then came a couple of miles of ridge walking. Next was the Jump Off, a steep downhill climb off the end of the mountain. Very exciting and scary! We made it down finally, and then came hours of walking through the woods - most of it downhill. We didn't see many people, but one guy caught up to us - it was Ghost! We last saw him at the hostel in Franklin. We saw him again when we finally made it to the shelter. Salt was beat!

Got to the NOC around 11. The NOC  is the Nantahala  Outdoor Center, an adventure resort on the Nantahala River. The trail runs right through the middle of it. The restaurant was open, so we went in and ordered lunch. I asked for a table with a plug for the phone! I had fish tacos and chips and Pepper had chili and fries. It was all good! Stayed almost an hour eating and charging phones. Next we went to the outfitter and bought a small bottle for soaking food and some Nuun, which is electrolytes. After that, we felt like it was time to go so we did. The climb out wasn't too hard. We met a work crew along the way and got a picture. We found a nice stone bench and sat on it. Stopped at the Wade Sutton Memorial, a memorial to a fallen firefighter. When we reached the spot where we were going to get water, there was none, so we went on a couple miles more. We got water from a lovely waterfall. It was almost like a shower! Very refreshing! It was getting towards evening and the trail had turned very rocky. It went around the mountain and then turned and went up the mountain. We made another turn and the trail became very steep. I realized we must be on the Jump Up. We climbed and climbed until we found a flat spot beside the trail. This was our campsite for the night! The tent barely fit and the rain fly covered the trail but it was a place to stay.

Very nice shelter, but a cold wind was blowing up the gap so we didn't stay long. We had light rain as we made our way to Cheoah Bald. That was a hard climb! The rain had stopped, so we ate lunch on top. Beautiful views! The first mile down was hard with new trail, rocks, roots, etc. But then the trail got better. Pepper took a fall sideways on one of the rocks, but was fine. We reached Locust Cove Gap around 4 and got water and decided to go on to Stecoah Gap. It was a nice walk, except the last downhill which took forever with the switchbacks. We planned to come down the mountain and set up a campsite for the night. When we had about a mile to go, salt got an alert on her phone about high wind warnings for the next two days for high elevations.  They were forecasting  up to 60 mile-an-hour gusts! We decided to go into town .  That turned out to be a good decision since they also had tornado warnings up for that time frame! In the Gap, we met Hopeful and his wife, Diana, doing trail magic. They gave us hot dogs and soft drinks, fruit and brownies! When they found out we were going to town, they gave us a ride and bought us dinner! Great conversation! In the Quality Inn tonight.","The Jump Up

Chuck Gibson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613348,"We stayed with our son Kevin, his wife Becky and grandson Linus from Apr 15 to May 3. Pepper's foot issue has greatly improved and we have headed back to the trail. After a long drive from Maryland, we arrived at the trail head at about 2:15. The first thing we did was eat our yogurt from breakfast so we could toss the containers in the trash cans there at the gap. Then a lot of adjusting of packs and we set out on the trail at 2:35. Everything was so beautiful! Salt kept taking pictures every 5 minutes. The trail went up and down until we got to Jacob's Ladder. That went up and up! Parts of it were pretty steep! It was a ridge walk after that until we reached the shelter at 4:20, 2.4 miles. It was a nice hike. We put up the tent, got water, ate dinner - it was still pretty early. Pepper took a nap and Salt talked to some of the other hikers. The wind is up and I think I hear thunder, but the sun is still out. Maybe storms later tonight.","Stecoah Gap

Chuck Gibson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613349,"Up at 6 and on our way at 8:15. We had to stop for water so we did and then continued on. The day seem to go by rather quickly. When we came to Hogback Gap, we took a break. It was all set up with two benches! The next section had lots of rocks to climb over. We talked to Too Many, a hiker who is hiking for servicemen with PTSD who have committed suicide. After Cody Gap, it began to rain but only lightly. We continued on. We were going to have lunch at a stream, but there was no place to sit so we went down to the road. No place there either and it had started raining hard! We continued on to the shelter and had lunch there and a big break. When the rain stopped we went on to a campsite by a stream. Dinner was ramen noodles. We are the only ones here tonight. We hiked 9.4 miles today. The day went pretty well except for getting soaked but it has to rain sometime. We have a 4 mile hike tomorrow to Fontana Dam Lodge. We will spend the night there and pick up a resupply box. Monday we will move on to the Smokey Mountains. :)","Brown Fork Gap Shelter

Chuck Gibson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613350,"What a pleasant day! It started off with rain. It rained lightly most of the night but really came down when it was time to get up! We just waited an hour until it let up. Packed everything up wet and off we went. The trail wasn't too bad; muddy in spots and not too many rocks. We got to the Fontana Marina about 10:30 and went out on the dock for coffee and ice cream at the store. That hit the spot! Then a very pleasant mile over to the shelter where we marveled at all the amenities and then went on to the visitor center. Got the shuttle to the lodge - a room and our package. Then to the general store for fuel and snacks. Had lunch at the Wildwood Grill and then back to the room to dry things and get packed up. Printed our Smokies permits, and sat in the sun on the balcony admiring the view! Tomorrow at 9 we head out again!","Campsite by Stream

Chuck Gibson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613352,"The Smokies! What a night that was with all the drying of gear! Finally got everything packed and when we wanted to microwave our breakfast sandwiches, we realized we didn't have a microwave! They went on the heater like everything else. Left the visitor center at 9:30 and did a mile of roadwalk then up into the woods. There was a lot of uphill mixed in with some flat but mostly up. We stopped at a stream for water with about 5 other people. Reached Shuckstack Fire Tower around 12:30 and went up to see it. We didn't climb it! Had lunch on a convenient log - summer sausage and spray cheese. The most fun was the giant tree challenge! A tree challenge is when there is a tree down across the trail and you have to try to get over or under or around it! This one was a doozy. We thought we saw a bear as we approached a stream but luckily it ran off. It was something black. The last uphill was steep and took forever but we finally made it to the shelter. Our first 11 mile day! Got here around 7 and it was a flurry of getting water, setting up sleeping spaces, eating dinner and hanging bags. Bet we sleep tonight!","Fontana Dam Visitor Center

Chuck Gibson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613900,"Slept until 7 this morning. It's hard to get up in a sleeping shelter. We had oatmeal and mocha for breakfast and Pepper had his cinnamon roll from yesterday. The horse people packed up and moved on. We left around 8:30. It was a nice walk. Everything was so pretty! I kept taking pictures. Before we knew it, the Russell Field shelter appeared and we took a break. We decided to just do a short day so that Pepper could let his foot rest and air. So it was just three more miles to Spence Field shelter! We stopped midway at a stream for water and talked to some day hikers. We were the only ones at the shelter when we arrived, but that didn't last long. There are probably 15 people here tonight. Lots of good conversation! Worked on the journal so it will be ready to upload in Gatlinburg. Had the mac and cheese for dinner. It was delicious and filling! Some people saw bears today and also boars. We didn't see any though!","Mollie's Ridge Shelter

Chuck Gibson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613910,"Everybody was up early and the shelter was empty by 8:30! We left at 9. We had a real nice climb up to Rocky Top which is rocky on top! Not too big either, maybe 20 feet across. Next, we made our way to Thunderhead Mountain which was just across the ridge. It was real pretty up there. There was a long climb down, some of it pretty steep and then we stopped for water. All that was left was a series of hills and one pretty good tree challenge. We stopped for lunch on the side of the trail with a beautiful view! The last hill to the shelter was so steep I felt sick and had to stop and rest at the top! Then we were at the shelter which rapidly filled up with 40 to 50 people! There were 13 people in the shelter and probably 20 tents. Dinner was wonderful! It's cold and windy tonight.","Spence Field Shelter

Chuck Gibson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613911,"The day went really well. Breakfast was delicious - oatmeal and mocha. We made a decision on our schedule. We will go shelter to shelter and go into Gatlinburg on Saturday. Will probably do the same thing when we get back. The walk today was pleasant. It went up and down. Only two big climbs - one went on for a while, the other wasn't too bad. Did a lot of ridge walking and there was lots of tall grass. The wind howled all day and the grass and trees swayed! We reached Siler Bald shelter at 2:30 and took a break there then climbed up to Siler Bald summit. It was small. We just turned and went down again. Got to Double Spring shelter about 3:35. Checked out the two springs. One flows better but the wind howls. We are sleeping on the top level of the shelter and I am using Pepper's mat. It leaks pretty bad! Spaghetti for dinner was great!","Derrick Knob Shelter

Chuck Gibson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613912,"I didn't sleep so well last night. I was awake early but not interested in doing anything. Eventually we did get packed up and on our way. We hiked up to Clingman's Dome through an old forest with lots of young trees and old blowdowns that were covered with moss! After the fires a few years back, many trees were weakened and blew down in storms. The big news of the day is that Icewater Spring shelter is closed for bear activity. Everyone was talking about it! We were planning to stay there after Gatlinburg, but our plans have changed now. We got to Clingman's Dome, the highest point on the Appalachian Trail, around noon and had lunch after going up on top. We had a little bit of a view. Next came our 200 mile photo! So exciting! After that, we just had to walk to the shelter but there were a couple of miles of downhill and that really took it out of me. Finally got here around 4 and it was a ways to the water source. But we managed and had dinner and are in bed. Tomorrow we go to Gatlinburg!","Double Spring Gap Shelter

Chuck Gibson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613916,"We got up early. It poured rain all night, but we were dry and snug in the shelter. Pepper ended up curled around my head. He really needs his mat fixed! The food bags on the cables were above a lake, but he was able to swing ours to the side and get it down. One to 2 inches of rain was forecast, so we just set off and walked steadily through the flowing trail. We got to Newfound Gap by 12:30 and were able to catch a ride with a sightseeing bus down to Gatlinburg. It was sunny in Gatlinburg! We checked in at the Days Inn and cleaned up, then went out on the town. We got a new water bag and a rope at the NOC and then went out to eat at Shoney's buffet. The food was so good! More sightseeing afterwards. We decided to take a zero tomorrow and get back on the trail on Monday since there's rain forecast for tomorrow. Pepper got us a midnight Mother's Day treat!","Mt Collins Shelter

They were very nice! We had a lot of calls with family for Mother's Day and went out to eat dinner at Mountain View grill. That was nice! Getting everything ready to set out again tomorrow.","

It was a very good time, camped and visited alot of venders. My air matress had a leak and we patched it twice. It still had a slow leak the Company NEMO replaced it for free. We also went to a presentation about Grandma Gatewood, the first female to through hike the Appalachian Trail. On the19th we headed back out for 6 more days with heavy packs. We continue to meet alot of great people and see some amazing sites. We are having a great time together.","

Chuck Gibson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615290,"This journal has been hard to keep up with. I guess you can tell by the way we haven't been keeping up with it. ?We often don't have a signal when we're out hiking and only have one when we get into town. In town, though, we have to do our laundry and do our resupply and get some rest and eat some food. And then it's time to go back out on the trail. So we'll update this when we can and catch it all up when we get back. 

Since Gatlinburg, we've finished hiking through the Smokies. We met Diane and Dave just past the Smokies and went to Trail Days with them. Trail Days was a lot of fun! When we got back, the four of us hiked from I-40 which is where the Smokies ended, up to Hot Springs - a distance of about 35 miles. We had a good time together! We didn't go very fast and we had lots of early nights. There was a lot of good food in Hot Springs which we took advantage of and then they set off for home and we set off for Erwin. It took us seven days to get to Erwin. We've been here for two days and are headed back out tomorrow. Our next destination is Elk City. We're almost to the top of North Carolina and soon we'll be out of Tennessee. So far we've hiked 344 miles!","Erwin
