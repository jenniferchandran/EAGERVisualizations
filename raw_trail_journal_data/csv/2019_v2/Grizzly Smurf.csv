Grizzly Smurf,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592871,"I wanted to do an overnight trail and I planned to hike after I finished my P/T job on Saturday so started hiking at 5PM on with hopes of getting to Dicks Dome by dark. As I approached the top of the park which took 45 min uphill, I encountered a black bear, I was downwind and saw the bear before it saw me. I was filled with excitement and fear since this was my first encounter (even though I had hiked in Yellowstone, Yosemite an near the Tetons I had never been alone with a bear. I just stood there and  we both kinda looked at each other and the bear went in the bush and I kept pushing past him to Dicks Dome.

I wanted to see how I would psychologically do with by doing 26.6 Miles in one day and how well my body would hold up. I had been training and prepping by doing 4-6 miles each day and between 8,10 or 15 miles each Sunday.

Grizzly Smurf,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592838,"Hello Everyone,I have been actively researching, attending REI co-op session in preparation for a thru hike. There is so much informmation out there I am taking slowly and intentional as I plan my gear, estimated time, supports and unintended outcomes of a thru-hike. It’s so exciting just being able to write about the possibility of a thruhike. I reside in Northern Virginia right outside of DC, so the AT is within 45 min, hour or a few hours away so it gives me a small taste of what the trail is like. Also, allows me to interact with a lot of hikers who are day hiking, section and thru-hiking. My initial plan was for a 2018 attempt, but due to work and family responsibilities it made more sense to move it to the following year. Also, it will give me more time to do more overnights, try out different gear and network with folks who have already completed a hike and those who are attempting one.",,View Entry,"Jun 03, Sun",0

Overall the AT is mostly flat. Had a few bear encounters and a few areas hiked were closed for camping do to persistent bear activity. We actually saw two small bear cubs tree while on the trail and tried to back away and locate the mother. A few minutes past and a couple hikers came up and we all continued through. 
It was great to see SoBo and NoBo hikers and all of them had big smiles to share

Grizzly Smurf,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597561,"I had a few days off from work and decided to do two overnights and test out some gear and see how my much weight my body can handle. So I know leaving in February means I have to carry more gear so I was between 40 lbs and had additional water just for this trip due to 94 degree weather. Also decided to sleep in more stealth setting alone. The more I experience in the woods the more I have to learn. The mountains can be very unforgiving and reminded me to be prepared and do my homework. On the second night it was close to 90 and humid, then a hard rain, sun then another rain and temps dropped to 50’s and I was soaking wet. I was in between two mountains, Luckily my Big Agnes tent was already up, when the real rain came which lasted all night. That tent is amazing, kept me mostly dry until the rain stopped close to 6AM. 
It was a great trip, good miles, saw a bunch of thru-hikers both SoBo and NoBo. Also was able to use my Jetboil find a comfortable hiking pace with a heavier pack weight. Will see what I can shave off. So overall did 7 Miles only half day hike followed by 19 miles the second day and 5 the last morning.","

The trail crosses back and forth between the two states. One of the most memorable hikes was Big Bald mountain, several of this weeks hikes included scrambling along some mountain tops. 
On the trail you meet all kids of people and most you will never see again unless you are hiking within a day or two of each other or at Trail Days Festival. Also I have sadly watched a lot of people end their hikes due to injury or other circumstances. 
The is week was the first week that I have seen a considerable amount of bear scat on the trail, some small others rather large. And last night around midnight I head several owls communicating. Very interesting sounds.

About halfway through the night I heard huffing and growling sounds outside my tent.

This week i has several days of ran which makes the trail and setting up and breaking down my tent a challenging tasks. 
  This week I saw Lake Watauga, an amazing waterfall and slept next to a river while in Tennessee. The highlight of the week was seeing a small black bear about 15 yards off the trail, I was not able to locate the mother, after a few seconds to bear disappeared over the ridge. 
I was very excited to Virginia, after hiking  GA, NC and Tennessee I had reached another goal of Damascus where I made a video expressing my appreciation for the trail, friends and family that continue to pray and support this experience.  And thanks for my brother Danny for visiting me in Damascus.

Grizzly Smurf,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613825,"I have had difficulty getting phone signal to update the journal. The last few days have been filled with excitement and experiences that one can only have on the AT. Each day brings a new challenge and southern VA are some pretty tough mountains. 
My first night out of Damascus I started hiking and ended up at a shelter at 7:15 PM and wondered why nobody else was there, then I looked and the shelter had a bunch of signs warning of human and bear interactions. I quickly made dinner, out up a bear bag line and waited for it to get dark. Late in the evening two other hikers came and at least there was a few of us. During the night I could tell something was walking through camp, after being out here you begin to sense your surroundings. 
The next day I hiked 18 miles up to Mt Rogers the highest point in VA, and camped with the wild ponies. I saw at least 30 ponies grazing or walking on the trail. 
I was very happy to get trail magic from some previous thru hikers on back to back days. This makes your day and even helps you save on re-supply. While I was eating and talking to a young hiker who thru hiked in 2015, he said in 6 months you will experience what someone would need 10 years to experience. That really stuck with me!
Wednesday night I was coming down a ridge about 100 yards from a shelter and saw a mom and 3 cubs, one of the cubs treed, then I noticed another bear which looked like a 2 year old near the group of bears. I used the bear boxes at the shelter but did not hear any bear activity that night. 
Yesterday I hiked 20 miles and spent the night at the Partnership Shelter, which is a double decker new shelter next to the US Park Authorities HQ. This was the first time I had a shelter to myself. Only reason is most hikers are celebrating Trail Days in Damascus which the annual party celebrating hiker season and all AT hikers. Overall my body is handling the terrain and mileage per day varies from 12-24 and some weeks I average more but still 15-16 avg daily.","

When I checked my steps for the day I had 65,539. The night before I had an interesting experience, I was in my tent and heard a noise that sounded like plastic being squeezed. It happened again and I looked outside my tent with my headlamp, still nothing.

Today I met some amazing Angles Bev and Jennie who’s stories gave me so much positive energy and support. 
I almost did not stop at the Trail Magic because I recently lost my tent rain fly and was trying to plan how I would sleep in my tent if it rained.

This gives me the freedom to have my own experiences but also share others. I am very amazed at the mountains in Southern VA. The height, beauty and varying landscapes makes VA a hikers challenge. What makes this trail amazing are the trail angles and supporters who appear at places where you are happy to get a burger, watermelon, coke or other delicious item that you don’t have on the trail. When you come down the mountain after days of hiking and camping, exhausted that meal/ experience can replenish you physically and mentally, so thank you. 
I mention this because it’s important to note because there is very little water in this area and Trail Magic has made a huge difference.  
Over the last several days I have hiked 19-20’s miles and have walked through pastures, Dragons Tooth and Mcafee Knob. I have seen an increase in snake activity but most of them will not  bother you . 
The other big moment this week was hitting the 700 mile mark, which I was very humbled by. The unique thing about hiking the AT is everyone out here want you to succeed and will be positive, motivating and always lend some advice that will help you be successful in your hike.","

So I realize I need to ease back into it. I did 19 miles yesterday and 16 today and my body is cramping and aching. I usually filter water 3 times a day and add pedialyte or Gatorade. As I hike and interact with other hikers I realize how epic this journey is for everyone from thru, section to day hiker. Several hikers I hiked with have left the trail recently, most to injury and others who changed to section hikers. It’s amazing the will, determination and desire to never give up pushes hikers on. I met a really cool hiker from Malaysia his trail name is 300, real humble and positive to be around. He plans to hike the PCT and CDT next year. Today was a tough start but got out hiking  and was sitting on a rock eating a snack when my good trail friend Tom walked by.

Grizzly Smurf,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616458,"The last few days have been very challenging but rewarding since most people think Virginia is flat on the AT. The    elevation change has been challenging yet rewarding and has caused a lot of knee, leg and dehydration issues for many hikers. Hiking this section of the AT means gains and loss of several thousand feet, ridge hiking which means you have to  extra carry water. I am hiking 16-25 miles a day and I truly earn and respect each step of the trail  
 The great thing is you have fellow hikers rooting you on and wanting everyone to make it. 
The other night I camped at Punchbowl shelter after a 22 day hike with tough mountains and very little water. Approaching camp I saw someone’s bear bag was hanging to low in front of the shelter. I ended up tenting as I usually do, then around 5:30 AM, I was talking with the owner of the bag and learned a bear clawed and bit into the bag despite being 10 feet from the shelter. 
I decided to hike early and saw a black snake and copperhead. As I approached the 800 mile mark I came across an old freed slave settlement which had remnants of houses and a community. It was very powerful experience. 
Lastly, VA has some of the toughest yet beautiful mountains on the AT. ? there was one point after a 1.5 hour climb that I dropped to my knees in exhaustion and out of water and I reminded myself to respect the trail, nature and be prepared. However, I also enjoyed the experience on the trail","

The only issue is I am close to losing a toenail on my left foot. I am watching it closely and will let it fall of naturally. The great thing about SNP are the waysides that have food and resupply every 20-30 miles so I do not have to carry as much food. I met a hiker named nobody or somebody and we had nice family give us a hitch to the Big Meadows Lodge and gave us some tuna salad.","

I left HP yesterday and had a short hike and found a great stealth  spot to watch the sunset. It’s amazing how long it takes to fully set when you watch it from the top mountains. Last night I could still see light at 9:45PM  on the horizon. Amazing to see!Today I did 20 miles which was tough since I had not hiked for a bit. The great thing about MD on the AT are the state parks that have bathrooms and running water which make your days a bit easier.

Today many of us passed the official  1/2 mark on the trail which which is in PA, I was so excited, luckily I was alone because I danced down the rocky trail for about a mile. Very thankful. 
A few hikers were discussing trail names and I learned some I had not heard. Mouse Trap and Incubator, the shelters are filled with mice, and they will burrow in sleeping bags, in one case they mouse got in then bag and ended up dying in the other got into the lining of the bag and gave birth and when the guy woke up the babies and mom came out.

I recently hiked through Pine Grove Furnace and stopped my the Green Mountain Store, both mom and pops places. At Furnace Grove they have the 1/2 gallon ice cream challenge, I did not participate but a biker named Blaze had just finished his 1/2. 
Today marked the 90th day on trail including rest days. This week I hiked 110 miles and think I have my legs back and heading to Duncannon, Allentown to Delaware Gap. What makes this area unique is because you hike mountains, state parks, small towns (Boiling Springs) with clear water flowing through creeks with trout in them. 
This trip continues to show the good in people and humanity. I was walking down the road today and high heat index, a couple  drove by and waved, then did a U Turn and came and gave me water and Gatorade.  Also, I took two falls today, one I stepped on a rock which was wet and I hand sand in the bottom of my shoes and did face plant(ouch) the other the terrain changed and I turned my ankle and went down. I can laugh now but it’s a reminder to be safe. I have been hiking 7 days straight and I know my body and mind need a break.

Once I was in top of the mountain I realized a lot of the terrain was rocks, which makes hiker more difficult and technical. As I was going down the last main incline I rolled my ankle and went straight down on my shoulder. As I was falling my pack shifted and I fell fast and could not prevent it.

Recently, I have used headphones and listen to music, which prevented me from hearing the very loud rattling until I was 2 feet from the snake, it’s body was half on the trail and coiled to strike, I was very fortunate because I was easily in the strike range. It was puffed up, rattling away, I gave it some space, while I recorded it. I had been preparing myself for this type of encounter since PA has a lot of snakes.

The ridges and climbs reminded me of VA and also I know it’s a glimpse into what I will hike going forward. As much as I want to hike faster the weather makes it slippery on rocks, roots and anything wet. Last night I was pushing hard and the rain came in before I set-up camp. It was a tough night, rained most of the night and I finally got my tent and gear settled. 
Being out in the rain, after a long day tests your resilience, energy and ability to stay focused, eventually the problem solving and solution come into view and different motivation helps you figure things out. Some days I think I have this trail figured out and in a moment I am humbled by circumstances or weather. 
 Also, I was lucky I was on a wood platform so I was off the ground. Eventually, I dozed off. 
In the morning I hiked 9.5 miles in the morning and was able to get to town and start to plan for my zero day.  I was happy I had climbed some great mountains in Connecticut and into Massachusetts.

Right before I got back on trail I was looking out my hotel window and saw a baby bird hanging from its nest and making noise. Usually I may let nature take its course but I quickly grabbed a glove, spoon and part of a plate and summoned some of the staff to help hold a table while I climbed up, I gently grabbed the nest, the bird fell on the plate and I used the spoon to put it back in the nest. I have watched enough nature shows and initially was in analysis mode and started thinking maybe...., but my heart, compassion kicked in and only the trail can help reset those senses ?
The following day I had some good trail karma after a taxi company said they would pick me up and did not, a trail angel Joe S. gave me a ride on a donation basis. This saved me big time bc I was stuck in town and over 15 miles to trail. 
That night I hiked 13 miles in the afternoon, was exhausted and prepped my tent for incoming rain around 5AM. Around 3 AM, I was startled by a loud clawing  on a tree very close to my tent. I yelled out, and the clawing continued, I knew it was a bear at this point. I stayed calm, the clawing continued, I yelled out a few times and eventually it went away. I have seen claw marks but have never heard them, very loud. 
A few hours later the heavens opened and rain, thunder and lightning poured. With all the rain it’s been tough to keep my feet dry but hoping to prevent blisters from hiking in went shoes and socks.  
I was heading toward Goose Pond Cabin, which is on the trail and has a caretaker who makes pancakes every morning which is treat for all hikers. As I was hiking I realized I forgot to bring cash to give a tip to caretaker which I really like to do to show my appreciation on trail. I was a bit bummed about it but kept on hiking. I was hiking 19 miles to the cabin and was crossing a bog when I found 16, we dollars in the ground, it was a 10, 5 and 1. I can’t even begin express what I was thinking when I see the money. I felt bad for the person who lost it, but used it as tip for the caretaker.  Prior to getting to the cabin, I came across a road crossing and met Uncle Rob and his Casper van doing trail magic. I was so happy to have a few snacks and sodas before I went up the mountain. He had apple and blueberry pies made that day. 
I continue to enjoy everyone I meet on the trail from day hiker, section, thru or those who have the ratio go through their community. All the support and positive energy means a lot to hikers, especially as the reality of making it to Katahdin becomes real for every thru hiker. I will continue to step every foot in the trail until I reach Katahdin and hope others have the integrity to do the same.  I wanted to end with how amazing and beautiful the AT is and how sweet smelling the forest is, the pines, ferns, flowers, sometimes it’s unexpected and you smell pure nature","

During my hike I was always mindful of those who hiked before me and those who will hike after me and to always have a high respect for the AT. I was blessed to meet so many amazing people, see parts of small town America by foot. One of my big takeaways is the generosity of trail angels, strangers and fellow hikers that always were so supportive. Also, the workers at every Walmart along the way were so happy and positive when I would go in for resupply. 
As far as the AT the White Mountains we’re very challenging, each state had unique features that were a challenge from northern Georgia, NC, TN into southern VA. The mid Atlantic states were easier to hike but brought different challenges with the heat and humidity or lack of water. But by far the overall tougher technical climbing was in NH and Maine. 
During the hike, I lost 70 lbs, took 163 total on trail days, I averaged around 18 miles a day and had significant days over 20 miles a day. I saw 14 bears, countless black snakes, copperheads and 1 Rattlesnake in PA, several bald eagles and porcupines. My only serious injury was in PA where I sprained my ankle and had to wait 2 days to hike and could not tie my hiking shoe due to the swelling. I had more pain in my knees and feet toward the end of the White Mountains. I never had a cold or sickness due to water or other common Trail sickness which I was so thankful. Lastly, I did not have any ticks that I was aware of.  
My favorite trail dinner was creamy chicken ramen with pepperoni :) after a long day I would quickly set-up, get water  and cook my ramen and be in my tent by 7:30.  
The 100 mile wilderness is a beautiful part of the AT and brings different challenges of needing to carry additional food weight and nearing the end of the hike the wear and tear really starts to take affect. During this period it rained almost everyday which forces a higher level of mental focus to stay upbeat and focused on the goal of Katahdin  
The last 277-300 miles really pushed me mentally and physically and my faith continued to ground me and keep me focused on how tough a thru hike of the AT really is. 
As I plan my next adventure I am going to do some traIl magic for other AT hikers and try to obtain a section of the AT to maintain.
