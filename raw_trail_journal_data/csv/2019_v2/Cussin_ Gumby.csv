Cussin' Gumby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608785,"Greetings!Hiked the MST from Folk Art Center to Craven Gap and back, which is around 10 miles, with a 22 lb pack.  It was a warm and pretty day, lots of folks on the trail today.  I ran into the section maintainer for the trail, and we chatted for a bit about trail maintainence.  He pointed out a tree he called the 'grand dame"" which is around 150 years old.  Wow!Saw my first bloodroot today, so now I know that Spring is really here.  My favorite flower.This last week before heading to Amicolola will be spent in getting my gear pared down to the essentials, and getting my food boxes put together and labeled.  Welcome to all who are following me on this site.  I will try to update often.  -Cussin' Gumby",,MST out and back,"Mar 24, Sun",0
Cussin' Gumby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610277,"Packed up and ready to head out.  Weather is clear and cool, and it will warm up.  Slept well at campsite at Amicalola.  Had to handle some bank shit with Bob over the phone this morning.  Goddamit!  Sez Cussin' Gumby.","Amicalola Campground

Cussin' Gumby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610279,"Made it to Springer by 4:00.  Have met some great folks so far, mostly guys, one other solo female.  Saw four types of butterflies today.  The little lavender ones I see every spring, a Monarch, a yellow swallowtail and a black swallowtail.  Saw a whole hillside covered in bloodroot, amazing!  Also saw white, yellow and purple violets.  No squirrels at all, just a couple of chipmunks.  According to EVERYONE, bears are not a problem in Georgia.  They have bear proof food storage boxes at many of the shelters.
The sun is going down, will hit the sack early and read.  There are two dogs here with their hikers, one is a Dutch Shepherd, so beautiful!","

Cussin' Gumby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610316,"Didn't get a chance to write this morning. Got up at sunrise and enjoyed coffee and breakfast, and by the time I got my pack squared away, it was 10:00 and most everyone else had left camp.  Still working on organization and streamlining gear.  Good day hiking, some solo, some with others.  Helped give Platypus his trail name.  Trail was pretty easy today, in camp just a little after 3pm.It is supposed to rain tonight, all night, and not taper off til the morning hours.  I'm starting to get stinky, haha!I'm in bed early.  Took some benadryl and advil and will read for a while.  Saw a vole and some thrushes today.","

Cussin' Gumby,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610320,"This entry is to catch up to the present.  I have hiked 52.5 miles of the trail, up to Unicoi Gap in Georgia.  Bob picked me up for a scheduled resupply overnight in Hiawassee.  After looking at the weather and some discussion (and guilty feelings) I am back in Asheville for the weekend.  I am shaking down my pack and organizing food for the upcoming weeks.  I will get my permit to hike the Smokies while I'm home.  I will head back to Hiawassee on Sunday, spend the night with a trail friend at the Budget Inn, and hike out from Unicoi on Monday morning.I have learned so much!  I am stronger and my pack organization skills have improved.  The people I have met are amazing!  Folks from all over the country and the world.  I have hiked with thunder and lightning rumbling overhead.  I have seen beautiful wildflowers, and listened to the birds sing as I huff and puff along.  No bears so far, but lots of owls at night.  My future posts will be more about how many miles I hiked, which Shelter or Camp I'm staying at.  Any interesting flora or fauna.  I'm going to use my phone to post, so please forgive typos in advance.  Thanks for following along.","

It will be beautiful tomorrow.","Hiawassee, GA
