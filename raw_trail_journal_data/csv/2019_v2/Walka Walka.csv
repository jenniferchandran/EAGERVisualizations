Walka Walka,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606202,"....So I pulled the trigger.  I reserved a room for April 3rd at Amicalolia Falls Lodge.  2019 will be my year!
19 years in waiting and 1131 miles hiking the Ice Age Trail in Wisconsin later... I will finally be hiking the AT.  All thanks to a little audiobook given to me by a scoutmaster afterwards my Eagle Scout ceremony as an awkward 18 year old.  Thank you Bill Byrson for lifting my spirits over the years with ""A Walk in the Woods"".  Who would have known it would have taken myself countless listens and 16 years to even attempt a long distance trail like you did.. 
It just proves to me that when the time is right you will know it.
Here is to three months of weight loss and walking before my start date.  No turning back now.",,View Entry,"Jan 03, Thu",0
Walka Walka,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606449,"So I broke my treadmill today prepping for the AT, 76 days out until I start.
Over the past week and a half I probably logged 40-50 miles, 4-8 miles a day just to start my weight loss goals and to get my legs back in shape.  I've laid around to much since completing the IAT, in which I usually found myself hiking 10-25 miles each day just so I didn't have to drive 3-6 hours up into Wisconsin for a short day hike.  I'll work back up to 10-12 miles; which will likely end up being my daily goal with training.  I don't walk much faster then 2.5-2.8 MPH on a good day so it's hard to stay on a treadmill for longer then 2-3 hours.  Maybe I'll break up my workouts, one in the morning and one in the evening.
The part to fix the treadmill won't be in for a few more days so I took to the cold January air (not that cold, it was above freezing as the snow out here in the suburban sprawl of Chicago was melting) and knocked off 5.5 miles.  It felt good but the concrete did finally get to me.  I might check out this good forest preserve near me and see if there is still enough snow cover to walk on.
Turns out my friend Sean E.; whom I hiked many miles with on the IAT asked me to join him and a few other IAT hikers this weekend for some snow shoeing along the NCT (North Country Trail) about 6 hours north in the Northwoods.  I couldn't turn him down now with the treadmill out of commission.   Wish me luck this weekend!
Hoping that part comes in soon so I can get back to my Netflix and incline walking.",,View Entry,"Jan 16, Wed",0
Walka Walka,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606454,"So I read somewhere that a thru hiker should take a piece of paper and a pen and write down as many random thoughts and reasons they can think of on why they are thru hiking.  Kind of silly and a lot of the random answers will be a bit sappy or wacky but it felt good afterwards to get them down on paper.Not only does it put your mind in a good place but it gives someone something to look back on when times get tough, your feet are bleeding, your gear is wet, your shins ache with every step and the only thing you can think about is going home.  I think I originally wrote this list for my failed SHT thru hike attempt but most everything applies to the AT.   I'll likely add things and sorry in advance for any duplicates if you do for some reason, read through them.Lately I've been finding less and less joy in my life and appreciating what I do have less and less.  All of my former hobbies leave bitter tastes in my mouth when I even try to engage in them, table top board gaming, board games, drawing, reading, live action roleplaying, computer games...  Even falling asleep in my own bed used to bring me great comfort and relaxation and now I'm even finding falling asleep hard.  I take my lover for granted, my friends and often find myself avoiding interactions.   I need to shake this bitter part of my life and appreciate the little things more.  I need to step away from the ease I have things and struggle, be in pain, long for things again.  Everything right now just feels so foggy.1) I'm not getting any younger.2) I have one life.3) To loose weight and be proud of my body again.4) To feel forward progress in my life.5) To feel healthy.6) To feel (I am numb to often to life).7) To cry alone in a forest.8) To relive my youth, camping, scouting.9) To hike another of the 11 National Scenic Trails.10) To wake up early and have the feeling of being the first one on the trail.11) To have goals.12) To feel proud.13) To accomplish something not everyone has.14) To walk.15) To feel the sun on the back of my neck.16) To wake up to bird song and fog.17) To fall asleep to the sound of a thunderstorm and rain on my tent.18) To walk in the rain.19) To get soaked through but feel clean and refreshed by summer rain.20) To meet strangers and make friends.21) To sit in town and tell townies of my adventures.22) To miss home.23) To appreciate David and our life together.24) To really miss and want him.25) To clear my foggy mind.26) To think of the future.27) To dream again.28) To find my passion again.29) To find my creativity.30) To give a shit.31) To stare into the night sky.32) To feel small.33) To feel insignificant.34) To be okay with everything.35) To prepare for the next trail/hike.36) To run away.37) To have purpose through no purpose.38) To appreciate stuff I don't normally.39) To feel in shape.40) To wade and swim in lakes and creeks.41) To soak my feet.42) To walk in a kilt.43) To be eccentric.44) To sing to myself.45) To learn from others.46) To experience the new everyday.47) To take long breaks.48) To enjoy the views.49) To not feeling rushed.50) To not feel like I'm wasting my time.51) To joke and flirt.52) To smile and laugh.53) To be in nature.54) Morning pees.55) To savor meals in town.56) To scream off bluffs.57) To appreciate the world for what it is.58) To push myself.59) To not getting diabetes.60) To living with less.61) To pursuing my daily goals.62) To be able to run again!63) To start campfires and smell of wood smoke.64) To wash in cold creeks.65) To hear frog calls.66) To hear loon calls.67) To take pictures to remember.68) To feel the wind.69) To not give up.70) To value the time.71) To fight my fears of being alone.72) To get my balance back.73) To get my memory back.74) To remember.75) To have stories to tell.76) To hear the crackle of campfire.77) To watch sunsets and sunrises.78) To see shooting stars.79) To feel I'm doing something of value.80) To value friends more.81) To think less of myself.82) To feel time is not wasted.83) To get over my fears.84) To grow.85) To change.86)87)88)…. more to come.",,View Entry,"Jan 17, Thu",0
