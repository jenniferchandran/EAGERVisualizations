I lock in the campsite for tonight at the falls and hope to sleep enough to get thru the approach trail with high spirits.

Right after lunch at hawk mountain shelter it became sunny and hot like the day before. Great views the whole way thru. On the descent of sassafras mountain, 2 trail angels with a plethora of snacks and grilled dogs!!! Clutch considering I was down to a sip of water and a couple miles to go for more!!! Arrived at the gooch shelter and the shelter had spots but I declined and decided to tent out like 10 others. Bad call. It rained hard and sleep was tough.  Got the gear ready in the tent and put the tent away wet and weighing 5 lbs more. Not too bad of a hike with the onslaught but missing views a little disheartening.

After getting ready inside the tent I leaped out doing the fastest break down I could.  Tent was rolled up soaked with the Georgia red clay. Brush the teeth and off I went, however the chaffing was growing unbearable. A few stops administering baby powder and doing my best impression of a duck walk, I decided to stay at wolf pen at woody gap.  Only guy there began to dry out my tent and gear and sleep. The sun comes out and it looks decent but I already paid and my inner thighs needed a break. I was disappointed for a bit, although two wheels had a dinner special that hit the spot

The mix match crew the AT provides comes from all different walks of life but with the exact enthusiasm. I heard amounts from 2-5 inches of rain and when the trail your hiking is running water down it like a spot you would collect water, who knows the exact amount? I never seen so much different sized rain drops or sheer volume it was coming down. There were times where the water was running almost ankle deep but we trudged on! Lightning and thunder catches your attention at 3500-4000 feet. I reached lower gap and many were hunkered down. The sun came out and when it’s 2pm.  Well might as well keep moving. The sawyer filter pouch sprung leaks so that was a chore getting water into a bottle when I had water just about everywhere else. I reached blue mountain shelter and with one spot left.

They had a decent resupply which I needed and even a much thicker bladder for my sawyer squeeze filter.  The night before I blew a seam in the pouch provided by the manufacturer.

Another beautiful day, sunny and warm. The threat of another deluge is on the way and Franklin seems like a gold spot to zero. Pair of 15 milers and I’m good. The trail was a nice foot bed and the thought of walking into NC was exciting. The end of GA reminded me of a scorned lover not wanting to let go before putting you thru hell. It was hot and some tough inclines and declines along the way. I hit the sign for the GA/NC border and noticed a few familiar names in the paper planted inside the 1” rigid pipe amongst the tree. I let out a victory cry and kept on. The twisted oak was a cool feature after watering up again from a piped spring flowing with ice cold water which tasted like a slice of heaven. It was hot and dry and the back of my neck was burning as well as my calves. NC punched me straight in the mouth with sharp mountain and courthouse bald. Although the hike up sharp was steep and unrelenting, I caught an outcropping to the west. Spectacular view, encompassing hiawassee as I believe. Incredible to say the least and after 15 mins I had to get to muskrat.

After a few miles the clouds began to lift and there were some glimpses of the mountains surrounding me. The day was partly cloudy and around 60. Ya perfect day for hiking! I move on ascending and descending, thru laurel trees and beds of flowers springing up. I start to become connected again, in the moment. I realize instead of stopping at Mooney gap to get into town and be free from the storm I can push on and see Albert mountain. The hike up Albert was no joke! You think it kicked your ass and boom there’s a scramble, wondering what to do with poles when ur grabbing for anything solid to pull you up. Eventually your at the top looking out at the best view I’ve seen on the AT. I climb the fire tower shoot a video and pictures. I find a strange feeling of closeness to a recently passed grandfather who loved this type of stuff. I begin to sit in amazement of how great the god of my understanding is. Just 20 miles ago I’m thinking this day is going to be filled with nothing to see and just trudging thru the rain; how wrong I was.

I reached mollies shelter by 1 and displayed permit to ridge runner (amazes me I was prepared) I pressed on, too early to hang it up. I decided to stop at Spence shelter just shy of rocky top.

I started out of Spence field at 730am. The weekend warriors were going hard at the shelter the night before, sleep was tough but I was up and out. I had my sights on cligmans. The hike was overcast but rocky top was a great view. The sun rising had a cool orange hue from underneath the clouds. I had lunch and watered up at Derrick knob. The heat was climbing and the sky was clearing. The views into the east were amazing and at points felt like the pacific north west with the conifers. The ascent to cligmans was a trek thru an enchanted Forrest seemingly set up by scene in a movie. You know your elevation when the Vegetation changes. Unbelievable views from each side of the trail but with only 2 hours of sunlight I had to move. I could of sat and stared for an hour. It wasn’t long before I heard all the commotion at the tower and day hikers stumbling down the path in front of me. It was a zoo, Sunday. I went up the tower for the lookout but it wasn’t like the ones on the ascent.  The haze casted by the 80 degree heat and the overcrowded selfie spot was a let down. Onto collins shelter but first was the collins mountain. Quick tent set up and dinner, what a 12 hour day!

Onward I went and today was filled with outstanding views the whole way. Newfound gap was crowded, it was 70s all day. The best was Charlie’s bunion. I must of sat up there for an hour just looking over the mountains. It’s rare to see a hawk soaring below you. A constant breeze made a perfect set up for lunch. The views continued to peck shelter.

I stop at every opportunity to look. The weather was perfect once again. The sun grew hotter as the day grew longer. Sweating profusely on the last 5 miles of the finale. The smokys were about to be done in 4 days with a mail drop at standing bear. Guthook app makes the place sound like a Haven for norovirus, after being here I can see why. It’s a cool spot with great energy but not the cleanliness. The mail drop was a bit aggressive, pack weight is up!

I could of been better on my water supply as usual. I knew max patch was going to be epic. The day was clear and the hike thru the open fields with no obstruction from viewing the mountains.  I took a brief moment to answer questions from weekend hikers and pressed on. The hike upto max patch was a tough one but man was it rewarding! Unbelievable views all around.  I would definitely be driving up and hiking that half mile regularly if I lived near by!

I knew it would be a sleepless night to see sunset and sunrise but I needed sleep too. I chose the latter and wanted to kick myself the next day but it’s all part of the hike. More will be revealed. My intention was to stop at deer park shelter and tent. Wake up and go a few miles into town but I decided to press on and hit hot springs.  I wanted a burger and from the day hiker I met at the top of bluff, I was headed straight to iron horse. It was rather uneventful into town. The hike was all downhill with nothing to see really, except for a box turtle on the trail about 400’ up from town. Hot springs was really cool on arrival. Very chill and excited for hikers to be in town, what a vibe! I plan on stuffing my face and taking a zero!

Beyond greatful and god never seizes to amaze me. It was a full day of high fives and great meals. The hike was 20 miles intended but with the down pour and 2” for over night total, I decided on hemlock hostel. The hike thru the rain was fun at times but upon arrival I had only one camp shoe.

The day was steady rain all day but after hot springs i wanted to get miles. I immediately wished I stayed back after I took a spill and broke my trekking pole in half. It was a tough day with the soaking rain and wind. The ridge line would of been awesome if it was clear but the creek called the AT would have to suffice. Everything is wet and I’m hoping to dry out and find another trekking pole in Erwin.

Las time I saw Brian was in telluride ski bumming. We hit a breakfast spot at 10 and just shot the breeze for awhile. After 4 hours of catching up and eating biscuits n gravy, I was off to go as far as I could. The humidity was building and the heat was cranked. The hike out of Erwin was a climb. I passed the first shelter thinking 4 miles is nothing but figured I made a wrong move when it started down pouring. So I stood under a tree for coverage and hit my food bag. I was eventually soaked, it wasn’t stopping. The sun eventually resurfaced and I was able to dry out a bit. Beauty spot was clear and amazing. There was a couple shooting there engagement photos and some day trippers who drove up to catch the sunset.  Unreal sunsets and a large bald. I headed down to a campsite about a tenth of a mile away.

After 4 serving of instant mashed potatoes and peanut butter tortillas I was off to bed and up early. Collected my water and into the mist. It was a bit chilly and damp. I passed couple members of the tramily and talked a bit. After leap frogging all day thru a hike with minimal views, sun was out tho. I paused at greasy creek trail, thought about staying there for Bruins game. The hike down was 1000’ and almost a mile. Upon arrival I got my sticks and even got to ship the broken one back. It was a long process but hey they were cool and super chill. I decided to just book it out and head to Clyde smith shelter for the impending rain. The greasy creek trail was already wet, swamp like; no way I was going to try and navigate thru a rain storm the following day. Looks like pasta sides and a shelter stay.

I figured I’d be wet and able to shower and dry off. The hike up roan mountain seemed to never end, with multiple switchbacks. The lunch at the highest shelter on the AT was cold and a bit damp. The shelter had a creepy feeling to it and with something rolling around on top half of it made the imagination run, it was cool. I set out from there and the little hump was a beast considering the name but the views were insane. Panoramic views for miles and big hump followed with a mile of climb that followed with an hour and a half of the best views. I could see the impending storm moving in on my right side with clear sunny skies on the left. I lucked out, no rain. The hike down to roan seemed to go forever; thinking of pizza will do that. Into town and a shuttle was there to take us to station 19E. It was a bit disheartening to find out everything closes at 8.

Leaving station 19E was like starting over again leaving the comforts of home. I figure I need miles even if it’s a few. No zeros just miles with maybe some big days here and there.  The right calf is still giving me a bit of pain. The day calls for rain and at the beginning it was but not too bad. The first 7 miles were quick and easy. The next 6 weren’t bad either.  A waterfall, one of the biggest I’ve seen. The day hiker took my pic and I took hers. It’s amazing how people gravitate towards a Thru hiker. They’re into the idea of leaving it all behind and just hiking for months. The heavy rains came around 3 and I haven’t seen that type of volume in my life. I was soaked walking down a trail into town of Hampton. The road walk to dollar general was cars splashing puddles onto me but when u look like u just got out of the pool, who cares. A couple stopped and drove me the last mile and offered me a beer. McDonald’s was a sure visit after a light resupply. I ran into chef Leroy and his daughter macy, they had a cheap hostel so I jumped on.

Some quick glimpses of the mountain side. The lunch at a picnic table overlooking the lake. It’s a different feeling knowing this is now my life for the next few months.  I get to pick where and when I eat usually with a view or picnic table. Pick a destination and try to hit it.

I enjoyed seeing everyone but at times seemed awkward with the never ending debauchery. Chimp gave me a ride back to Massey gap, I owe him. He also brought me gaiters, mine broke. Over a decade has passed since seeing the guy and turns out he’s a triple crowner. Drove an hour out of his way which added an additional 2 hours to his trip back to Knoxville.

It’s been a month since my last entry. I’m in a rhythm. I passed 1000 miles and the halfway point. My mornings are dialed in and there’s something special waking up in a stealth campsite. You pack everything away quicker then yesterday and it happens like tying a shoe. I have 20 miles in my mind every day and look for camp either close or beyond that number. I can go hours with no interaction and also stumble into a group. I keep one thing in mind, HYOH. The state parks in PA have been awesome, bathrooms and potable water. The people are friendly and crossing the mason dixon line I thought different. I can’t seem to think of words when describing the solitude while the weather is low 70s and dry. PA has been rather tame as well as WV. The roller coaster was hard but fun. Other hikers complain and I know they have never been to the whites. There’s a certain understanding of what difficult is when your day hikes are thru out the whites but with a pack and shelter is a new endeavor.","

Long drive ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618540,July 11I’m close to 1400 miles and NY/NJ has been easy but my feet and knees are painful. I decided to get off trail for a few says and ice up. The heat has been tough. Every day is humid and close to 90. The knees are painful as well as the feet with every step. Discouraged and disappointed I’m not close to VT by now.  The mileage is low and minimal 20 plus mile days. I’m hoping I can get back on trail and get into CT.,"
