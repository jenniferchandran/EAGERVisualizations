Waiting to get one on the trail!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552718,"So I have finally made my decision after months of debating, I will attempt a thru-hike of the AT in 2019. By this time in 2019 I will have retired from the United States Marine Corps after 22 years of service. I plan on taking time to myself to just think about life and the road ahead by taking 100 miles per year I spent in service of this country. That equates to 2200 miles, I believe that it is going to be extremely difficult and rewarding all at the same time. I'm not out to set any speed records but, I do hope to be able to complete this within 6 months. I will update this as the time gets closer but, I look forward to meeting new and exciting friends out on the trail.","Amicalola Falls State Par

Waiting to get one on the trail!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552732,"So I have been researching gear and I believe I am going to try and go ultralight. I am shooting for 30 lbs or less for winter start and then down to 25 lbs for summer. I'll be carrying 5 days of food, 2lbs per day at roughly 3600 calories to start. I will most definitely have to adjust but I'm a newbie to the trail so I'll just have to learn. If anyone has suggestions I'm open to them.","

Waiting to get one on the trail!,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554117,"So after thinking about it and reading some decent trail guides, I've decided to start at the beginning of April. This is for a few reasons, but the main one is, I am moving from Hawaii and I'll feeeze my tail off in the cold march weather!","
