Halo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604515,"Today I started my four day section hike to test my gear and see what I might need or not need. My lovely wife dropped Gary and Susan (dear friends and trail mentors) and me at Woody Gap early this morning.
We covered a little over 8 miles at a nice slow pace of five hours. We plan to do 12 miles tomorrow Lord Wiiling! My body is holding up well no blisters, I’m using the Altra Lone Peaks 3.5 , with the Injinji liners and Darn tough socks. My Osprey  Atmos 50 fully loaded came in at 32 lbs but was extremely comfortable. The only gear failure was my Sawyer squeeze as it would not flow it’s practically brand new and is a favorite amongst hikers. I will see if the folks at Neel Gap can help me out. Fortunately my friends have a nice pump Katadyn brand. We met several section and day hikers along the way.
Lessons learned or reminded of; fist bumps not handshakes is the accepted greeting amongst us dirty hikers.
Hikers going uphill always have the right away (except for speedy kids!)
Great day today but the views were socked in , still we had a blast.
Good night from the AT!","Woody Gap

Halo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604594,"I woke up to a foggy morning and got up out of my tent around 6:30 am. The sleep was good but not great as I had to get use to the whole sleeping bag/pad experience on top of all my aches and pains. My friend Gary had magnanimously fetched my bear bag that was hung 100 yds down the bank and I heated up some water for my coffee and oatmeal.
We quickly broke down our two campsites and Gary and I hiked back down the 1/10 of a mile to camel up on water. Shortly we climbed back loaded up our gear and the three of us  started our first major ascent up Blood mountain.The climb was tough but we all felt great when we reached the top and explored the oldest shelter on the AT. The two room stone structure in the fog reminded me of something out of a scary fairy tale, but was very cool non the less. Unfortunately there were no views to be seen as the clouds were upon us.
We hiked down the steep wet slick rocks heading to Neel Gap and that’s when it happened. I lost my footing but was able to stop my fall by planting my Leki poles down hard, too hard as one snapped in half. Fortunately nothing was hurt other than my equipment and pride. We finally made it to Neels Gap and “Just Bill” taped up my pole and also told me to soak my Sawyer filter and it would start working again (it did!)
We traveled thru the portal ,the AT actually goes thru their building and climbed Levelland Mnt where we stopped for lunch. The rain started light at first and continued on to torrential downpour throughout the day. After lunch we quickly packed up and that’s when I noticed a pain in my knee. The pain became excruciating with each step and I had at least five miles left in the day.
My friends (trail mentors)would hike on and patiently wait for me to catch up. Inspite of this set back,I was still having a great time and looked forward to setting up camp and sleeping the pain off. However the rain got harder and the trail became a  shallow fast moving creek . 4 miles later I arrived at Tesnatee Gap and my friends suggested we get off the trail but I wanted to push to the shelter at Whitley Gap. BIG mistake!! The climb up Wildcat mountain was very steep and I was beat,hurt and very wet. 
When I finally got to the Hogpen trail Junction it was almost five pm and soon to get dark and the shelter was 1.2 miles off the trail... I graciously accepted defeat and I hobbled down to Hogpen Gap where my friends had secured us a ride home. My 4 day hike was cut to 2 days...

Halo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604631,"This morning when I woke up , the swelling in my knee had subsided. I hobbled down the stairs and rolled out my leg with a hand held roller. Although I felt much better it was probably a wise decision to come off the trail as twelve miles was probably going to be too tough today.
Gary took me on a walking tour of his property and we made our way down to the creek, eventually my knee started to feel normal again and we decided to try a short but steep hike up to Brasstown Bald the highest point in GA. The climb went very well especially without the 30 lb backpack and the view was stunning as this was the first clear day of the week. The leaves are just starting to turn and I imagine it will be “on fire” in the next couple of weeks.
The steep hike back down, I started to feel the familiar pain in my knee, again probably a good idea we were off the trail. I learned many lessons this week from equipment failures to hanging a bear bag. I have some serious strength and aerobic training to do and I’ve got to whittle off some weight from my pack. The most important lesson I learned is that The mountains are calling my name and I’ll be back in the Spring ready to thru-hike!","Blairsville Ga

Halo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605232,"First of all I would like to thank LEKI for sending me a brand new set of poles to replace the one I snapped on the descent from Blood Mnt, Great customer service! It’s fantastic to do business with a quality company that backs their warranty. Their products are well worth the price!Last week I met with my new friend “Stoic” who successfully thru hiked the AT this year. I gripped on to every word he said and made many notes after our meeting. He sold me some of his gear that I’m very excited about. I purchased an Inreach Delorme radio which works off of satellite and has an emergency S.O.S feature and his ZPac Arc Haul Zip back pack  I mentioned in an earlier post that before my quest I would like to shed weight and this pack does just that. It weighs 27.5 ounces compared to my Osprey Atmos @ 4lbs 7 ounces. I tested it out this weekend on a 6.5 mile hike and the pack is very comfortable and surprisingly has a larger capacity of 64L compared to My Osprey at 50L. I uploaded the picture side by side and it sure looks smaller!I’ve also ratcheted up my physical training incorporating several knee strengthening exercises. Hopefully I’ll be more prepared for those climbs and descents. There are also quite a few good videos on the internet showing proper technique for hiking down steep grades. Who knew?",,View Entry,"Nov 11, Sun",0
Halo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605390,"Saturday, I went for another 6 mile training hike. I carried close to 17 lbs but anticipate I will be closer to 30lbs on launch date. Recently I met with Stoic again and he sold me his ZPac Duplex tent. It is so light and easy to set up. I do like that it does not have any poles in fact you use your trekking poles to prop up the tent , very efficient. Thank you Stoic !I’ve been shedding weight with my purchases and also recently replaced my Jet Boil with an inexpensive BRS stove very light and around $18.00 . So far close to 6 lbs saved total.The shake down hike on the AT in October was an awakening, I am way weaker than I thought and truly every ounce saved will help save my knees. Unfortunately I realize I will offset most of my weight savings with my winter gear. I just purchased a thermolite reactor liner for my 19 degree sleeping bag and it is heavy , also I may bring micro spikes ugg!Any way I have officially signed up on the Appalachian Trail Conservancy website. It looks like there will be at least 6 others starting on Feb 18th. Signing up isn’t mandatory however it can help control overcrowded start dates and shelter/campsite  usage.Any way no backing out now!",,View Entry,"Nov 19, Mon",0
Halo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605441,"I hope everyone had a wonderful Thanksgiving Holiday, Rhonda and I drove up to Sylacauga Alabama to spend Thanksgiving week with her father, and my brother and sister in law joined us as well.I took advantage of having some hills and small mountains to train on (yes I brought my pack!) In fact I was walking around a track near a Sylacauga elementary school when a nice lady asked me if I was familiar with Flagg mountain . I had never heard of it and yet it was only 15 miles away. So on Black Friday we loaded up the family and headed up to the mountain.Flagg mountain stands at 1,152’ tall and truly it has some amazing views. It has a beautiful lookout 52’ tower made out of stone circa 1933 ( check out my photo gallery). This mountain is the symbolic southern terminus of the Appalachian trail and at one time was pursued as the southern terminus of the AT. Imagine another 300 miles stretch....This is also the southern terminus of the Pinhoti trail and provides access to the Eastern Continental Trail  and the Great Eastern Trail. Check it out If you can , it’s definitely worth the trip amazing views and history!As fantastic as the mountain is ,the highlight was meeting it’s caretaker Dr. “Sunny” Eberhart aka  Nimblewill Nomad the famous triple crown hiker and author ! He’s written several books you will recognize  Ten Million Steps  the story about his epic ten month trek from the Florida Keys to Quebec . Sunny graciously invited us into his cabin and made us all feel like we were longtime friends. He is the most humble , caring individual I’ve ever met and gave us so much of his time and genuinely cared about my upcoming thru hike attempt. I will never forget this meeting truly we were in the presence of greatness! Check out his website for some great information,video links, books etc. He is truly a legend.Nimblewill Nomad.com",,View Entry,"Nov 24, Sat",0
Halo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606007,"Gear,gear gear... I updated my gear list and have added pretty much everything I plan to take minus the food and water. This list will probably change and hopefully be whittled down by the time I take off. The early start in February has me bringing extra weight which I will mail back home as soon as possible. Gear is very much a personal thing and truly we pack our fears. An experienced hiker would probably leave half the stuff I listed at home. Certainly I would appreciate any input on any additional necessary items and of course the ones listed that you would not bring (I got to have my pillow lol).  I’m at 19lbs base weight which includes my propane but not my water and food. My goal is to give anyone who may be thinking about hiking  an understanding of what goes inside a pack. At least what is in mine.Thanks to everyone that has posted in my guestbook , it really is encouraging!",,View Entry,"Dec 22, Sat",0
Halo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606033,"Merry Christmas to all! Rhonda and I came to visit her dad in Sylacauga Al for Christmas. Just like Thanksgiving I brought my loaded pack so that I can train on mountains and hills,truly the only way to train for a hike is to hike.
 Back home in Florida I do lunges ,squats,stair master...typical gym strength and aerobic training ,but the hikes I take are always on flat ground. Nothing replicates good ole mountains to stretch and strain those knees. I’m happy to report that my additional knee strengthening exercises I do everyday seems to be helping as I’m not hurt after two 6 mile days climbing up and down sometimes very steep hills.
Today I went on a hike on Bull Gap mountain near my father-in-law’s home. When I got to the trail head I realized that this section of the Pinhoti trail was a wild life management area and it is open season for deer hunting. Naturally I had not planned ahead and brought any hunter safety orange attire. Fortunately when I dug inside my backpack, I found my orange Leki pole bag and my sleeping bag liner bag which I use to store my micro spikes and tied both to the outside and walah instant orange shield of protection!
The trail was beautiful and the weather perfect in the fifties approaching sixties as the day progressed. I was amazed at the views of the Alabama Appalachian mountain range. I’ve included a link to the Pinhoti trail, if you are in the area you have to give it a try. The trail is well maintained and a large section was walking on a bed of pine needles litterly no impact on your legs at all however stay alert as the needles can be slick...
When I got to the top of one particular mountain with a view ,I pulled out my cook kit to whip up some lunch. I was not particularly hungry but I like testing my gear and skills as an outdoor chef. I have a Toaks 650 titanium cook pot and a BRS stove which I screwed on to my fuel canister poured two cups *of water in and began to boil. The freeze dried chicken and rice package required two cups of boiling water which you simply pour in the bag and allow to simmer for 10 minutes. The brand I used today was not mountain house and it would not sit up by itself so I poured the contents into the pot and ate it from there. This of course is not the best case scenario as it then requires cleaning up afterwords , I’m a chef not a dishwasher.
* Two cups is pretty much the capacity of this pot, I thought that would be plenty big enough however I made some coffee today as well so I feel that I had to waste more fuel heating up another 8 ozs of water for my mud while my food simmered. So I think 750 would be a better size??? I forgot to mention I used my collapsible silicone Sea to Summit coffee cup it worked well but is no Yeti.
After that I hiked back down the mountain and spent the rest of the day with my family. I hope everyone’s Holidays is going well and may your 2019 be Awesome!

Halo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606175,"Happy New Year to all! Wow today is the first hiking day for the 2019 class, best wishes and safe travels to those embarking on their journey . May God bless you and your family and friends while you are trekking thru the majestic Appalachians.
Today I wanted to briefly review some facts about the AT , My lovely wife recently suggested that some of our friends and family may not know some of the basics and would appreciate a simple 101 of random AT info. The following information is from various sources and certainly appreciate any corrections /additions from our hiking community. There are tons of great books and web sites on the AT and certainly I will only touch the tip of the proverbial iceberg with this info. I must warn you the more you learn about this beautiful range the greater the attraction and desire to become one with the mountains and trek on every inch of the trail. I’ll be jumping around a bit and hopefully I won’t leave out any thing obvious,  if you have a particular question please post it in the guest book and some one will surely have the answer.
The Appalachian Trail is a continuous foot path that starts at Springer Mountain Georgia and ends at Mount Katahdin in Maine. The total distance is presently listed as 2,190 miles but this distance is ever changing as the trails are often rerouted. The trail traverses 14 states ;Georgia 76.4 miles, North Carolina 95.5 miles, Tennessee 287.9 miles, Virginia 550.3 miles (1/4 of the entire trail!),West Virginia 4 miles, Maryland 40.9, Pennsylvania 229.6 miles, New Jersey 72.2 miles, New York 88.4 miles, Connecticut 51.6, Massachusetts 90.2, Vermont 150 miles, New Hampshire 160.9 and Maine 281.4 miles. Benton Mackaye proposed the trail in 1921 and the trail was completed in 1937 mainly with the help of volunteers that to this day volunteer groups maintain the trail for all of us to enjoy.
The trail is enjoyed by thousands every year, there are many access points/ trail heads which makes all area of the trail accessible to all of us day hikers . Certainly there are many ways to enjoy every inch of this trail and some choose to do sections at a time . Section Hikers can complete the entire AT over a period of years a couple of days or weeks/months at a time. In my opinion this method  allows for continual growth of knowledge and evolution of the latest gear and technology and the hikes can be scheduled during any season selected. A thru-hike is defined as completing the trail in a 12 month period. The only time constraint is that Mount Katahdin in Maine closes approximately October 15 depending on the weather and opens usually a little after Memorial Day in the spring.
Thru- hikers can start in Georgia and head north (NOBO’s) or if they start in Maine and head south they are referred as SOBO’s. There are also several Thru hikers that start somewhere along the trail , head south reach Springer and then catch a ride back to their starting point and head north to Katahdin these hikers are known as flip-floppers and they are probably the smartest of all as they avoid the crowds *and can be more selective on their hiking climate.
The Appalachian trail Conservancy does not require hikers to register but encourages you to do so ,as they can help keep up with the numbers starting on any particular day and hopefully alleviate some of the overcrowding at shelters .
The hiker bubble* normally is between March thru May and it’s great to be able to see how many registered fellow hikers are starting on your date. So this explains why some of us start earlier in the year to spread out the numbers. Appalachian Trail Conservancy  www.appalachiantrail.org
On average a Thru- hiker takes between 5-7 months to complete their hike eventually averaging 15 miles per day. Every 3-5 days a hiker will go into a nearby trail town and resupply their food supply and often take a Zero (complete rest day)or a Nero (low mileage day). Some times the town offers a shuttle service , hostels or even special thru hiker rates at some hotels. Churches and other very nice people known as Trail Angels offer assistance water, warm meals , rides places to stay etc. Thank you for these wonderful human beings.
Interesting fun fact-The elevation gain/loss of hiking the entire AT is the equivalent of climbing Mount Everest 16 times. 2,000 people attempt a thru hike each year, 20-25% of those attempting a thru-hike actually finish, I hope to be one of the few the proud...Realistically so many things can go wrong and just the one shake down trip I took in October I had to get off the trail early.
The highest point on the AT is Clingmans Dome in the Smokies at 6,644 feet. We are most likely to see a Black Bear in the Great Smoky Mountains, Shenandoah National park and New Jersey (NJ surprised me). The AT does require bear canisters to store our food in certain areas but for most of the trail hanging a bear bag in a tree is acceptable there are plenty of articles on line with further explanations on that topic.
Traditionally many NOBO’s will start their journey at the Amicalola Falls state park and this is where they will register their hike and be assigned a tag and a number. The approach trail to the AT is approximately 8 miles long and includes 604 steps alongside the waterfall. Unfortunately these 8 miles do not officially count as part of the AT and some get dropped off at the official trail head but I believe the road can be difficult to drive on? I’m not sure what I will do as I hate the thought of blowing out my knees before I even get started...
Any way I will be covering more useful information especially once I get on trail, please gather solid info from those that successfully completed the hike there are great enjoyable journals on this site , such as Beakers 2017 journal.
Hike your own Hike , Trail names etc, etc etc...

Halo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606830,"Friday Feb 1 was my final day at work. Last week was a whirlwind of emotions, surprise parties, events and gifts . I truly appreciate all of the thoughtful kind well wishes from all of my amazing co-workers and clients. Thank you for our friendship!
Now I need to finish my final preparations for the trail. I’m going to try and hike every day before I leave and hopefully get a head start on gaining my trail legs. As you know I start my AT hike Feb 18!
Yesterday, I did a 9.3 mile training hike with my ZPacks Arc Haul Zip loaded at 26 lbs. The Florida  Split Oak traiI was flat and sandy. I kept a pretty good pace at 3 miles per hour and did stop once to talk to a Boy Scout troop and discuss hiking information,techniques etc. After my impromptu field presentation I stopped to test a new piece of my cook kit , the Big Sky insulate pouch  www.bigskyproducts.com . I plan to do a lot of freezer bag cooking ,which means I will heat up water in my Toaks titanium 650 ml cook pot and then pour the heated water into either one of my prepackaged freeze dried Mountain House meals or into a freezer bag with ramen noodles, oatmeal etc. I will then place the freezer bag into the insulated Big Sky pouch which will keep the heat from dissipating and aid in speeding up the cook time. This process eliminates having to clean up my pot every time I cook.
I also tried out my new Zpacks bear bag, the kit comes with a small rock bag and 50 feet of Z line, a mini carabiner, the total weight is 3.4 ounces. Through out the Appalachian Trail it is required to hang your food and other scented items such as toothpaste away from bears. You should hang your bag 100 yards away from your tent. Another good reason to hang your bag is to prevent mice from chewing through your tent to get to your food. I’ve hung bear bags before but I will also try and practice using all of my gear everyday before I leave to develop a super comfort level. Yesterday I used the PCT method for hanging the bear bag,which means rather than tying off the loose end of the line to a tree, I tied a stick to the line and it intersected with the carabiner attached to the line to hold it in place. I have added pictures to help explain the process.
I want to give Zpacks customer service tremendous accolades. Zpacks is a cottage company that manufactures high quality, super lightweight backpacks,tents,sleeping bags and other hiking/adventure equipment right here in Melbourne Florida. The company was founded in 2005  and is owned and operated by hikers that are constantly improving their gear through their own experiences as well as input from the hiking community. They recently upgraded all of the webbing on my pack and secured all of the loops with their most modern methods. They refused to charge me and insisted on the free upgrade to give me best ultimate experience on the trail. They also prioritize any emergencies for any thru-hiker on the trail. What is really amazing is that they know I bought the pack second hand but still gave me top-shelf service! I have of course bought and will continue to purchase other products from this fine company. Thank you Zpacks!  www.zpacks.com",,View Entry,"Feb 03, Sun",0
Halo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606870,"I spent the last couple of days hiking a small section of the Florida Trail with a full pack and so far my knees are holding up. I’m also practicing packing and unpacking ,setting up my tent etc. All in the efforts to hopefully make everything hiking related second nature. I’ll work on finalizing my food for the first four days tomorrow. I decided to treat my  Goretex gear with Revivex a product designed for waterproofing various fabrics. My Marmot Exum jacket is probably 10 years old and has effectively protected me from the elements , but I know I’m about to live in a super wet environment. I also treated my tent,backpack,sleeping bag,shirts,pants,socks and trail runners with Permethrin. This product will repel mosquitoes but more specifically  ticks. I hate ticks they are tiny,very sneaky and can be deadly.  Definitely one of my fears. 
Speaking of fears I’ve had many interesting conversations about my upcoming hike with various people and usually I’ll get one of two reactions when I discuss hiking over 2,000 miles alone.   1. You are crazy!  2. You are very brave!  Hmmmm,Well maybe just a little bit crazy but certainly not very brave. I have plenty of fears  and will take a minute to jot them down in no particular order. Lightning, hypothermia,ticks (Lyme disease),frost bite, heat exhaustion, heights, tripping and falling, getting lost, bears, bad people, sickness on trail, broken bones and teeth, poisonous snakes, running out of food, running out of fuel, dangerous weather, water crossings, falling trees, dying from exposure... you get the idea , plenty of fears.
Our division president recently addressed us at our national sales convention and said fear is not the same thing as as being scared. Two totally different things ,I believe fear is having a healthy respect for everything that can harm you and taking all necessary precautions to negate the possible risk. There are certainly those dangers on the trail but plenty of risks in everyday life here in the “real world” as well. Don’t get me wrong, I appreciate all the prayers and well wishes, but just understand most hikers are not reckless thrill seekers or crazy.

Halo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606940,"In my attempt to famiarize myself with my gear, I realized that I had not taken my micro-spikes out of the box much less tested for fit etc. So Saturday on mile 4 of my 6 mile hike with my overweighted back pack 31 lbs ( more on that in a bit), I tested them out on the sandy trail. 
They seem to fit very well as comfortable as you would imagine something like this to feel. For those of us from the south, micro spikes are like snow chains for your feet. They are critical in crossing icy patches on the trail. I actually hope I never have to use them.
The brand I bought was relatively inexpensive compared to some. Uelfbaby crampon micro spikes (19.99) . They actually got a great review in an online article I read. If any of our northern friends have an insight to their integrity please let us know.

Halo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607012,"Today I finally got my In-Reach Explorer activated. This gadget has a lot of features and after reading the entire manual and watching three YouTube videos, I kind of,sort of now know how to work it. This is a global communicator/GPS  which works off a satellite and has a SOS button if I get lost or critically hurt. I will be able to communicate even when there is no cell service so that’s pretty cool. 
Yesterday, I took everything out of my pack for the upteenth time and re-evaluated everything for any potential weight savings. Mainly I cut back on my extra food but all in all I’m leaving everything as is ,I’m just a tad over 30lbs, I double checked the weight at Publix. If you recall I was at 32 lbs on my shakedown hike in October and the good news is that once it warms up I’ll be able to send several items homes, my knees will just have to toughen up till then. 
The final preparations are well under way and ready or not I’m setting off on the trail Monday Feb 18th ( Lord willing of course) . I’m going to jot down a list of things that anyone leaving for any extended hiking trip might need to address and maybe if you think of anything I should add please let us (community of hikers) know. I can tell you,I am blessed to have a wonderful supportive wife that without her I could not attempt this adventure.
This will not be in a particular order but some should be addressed well ahead of time.

I’m sure there’s a twentieth one but that’s all I can come up with for now. They say a large percentage of the challenge of a thru hike will be mental ,but I’m not sure how to prepare for the homesickness I’ll surely feel.I did read the recommended book Appalachian Trials : A Psychological and Emotional guide to Succesfully Thru-Hike the AT by Zach Davis it’s a great read with good mental exercises.
I am thankful for all of the supportive comments I have received on my guest book, they are very encouraging and I will read them every night. This whole thing is a very long shot but I plan to make it!Thank you!",,View Entry,"Feb 12, Tue",0
Halo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607089,"Rhonda, her dad and I arrived at Amicalola lodge yesterday afternoon. The  weather was absolutely spectacular and the park and lodge was crawling with the holiday weekend crowd. This lodge sits ontop of a mountain about 8 miles from the official Appalachian trail starting point at Springer Mountain Georgia. Monday morning I plan to hike the approach trail to the terminus.
Well before I can start my hike I needed to officially check in. Thru-hikers check in at the visitor’s station at the base of the mountain and falls. I signed in and was given a shiny new thru- hiker tag with the number 160. This means 159 other hikers have all started the trail since Jan 1 and are already on their way to Maine. Then I weighed in my pack on their scales and somehow my pack gained   another pound and I’m now just a little over 31 lbs with 4 days food and water. Throw in my clothes, jacket I’m wearing and easily total skin out weight is closer to 36 or 37. Still not terribly bad since this includes my heavier winter gear. 
The weather forecast for my first week is wet, wet and chilly. Well what do expect in February, snow?
I’m super excited and can’t seem to get my butterflies in formation. Ready or not the adventure begins tomorrow morning!",,View Entry,"Feb 17, Sun",0
Halo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607108,"It’s 2:30 am , I can’t sleep. No big surprise as I’m literally stepping off into my dream in just a few hours,those butterflies never rest! It rained all day here at the Amicalola Lodge and the car thermometer read 38 degrees when we jumped in to head back down to the visitor center yesterday afternoon. Rhonda, her Dad and I took a final picture under the famous archway that starts the approach trail, Cold rain would not keep Dr.Zorn my father in law from taking the first steps with me. I am so blessed to have such a supportive family.
Back at the Sylacauga home front aka operations headquarters ,Our dear friend Damien Perry is baby sitting our dog son Reagan a feisty Miniture Pincher that could probably run the entire 2192 miles of the trail. Oh by the way did any one notice that some one added two miles to the trail this year? Anyway Damien added a very cool Appalachian Trail Flag under Old Glory at my father-in-law’s home Thank you D!!
Yesterday was great as we met a few thru-hikers at the lodge and at the visitor center. Nick is a very nice young man from Pennsylvania, this guy has tree trunks for legs and though I hope to see him again he will most likely be in NC before I hit Springer. Actually he does plan to take it slow at first but my goodness his physical fitness Is amazing. Also one of my highlights today was meeting one of my fellow TrailJournals bloggers Brandon  aka “B” I’ve enjoyed his site and have learned quite a bit from him. We got to meet his lovely parents as well! At the visitor center we sat through a “Leave no Trace” mini seminar very informative and there was a family of 5 three adults and two young boys that will be hiking thru as well. The youngest boy asked me how do you acquire a trail name ? He really liked my name Halo. I told him some traditionally receive their names on the trail by fellow hikers and the name can be for a variety of reasons ; something silly like going the wrong way, mooching food, slow hiker (turtle) the reasons go on. But certainly he could decide what name he accepts , My wife and I later thought we should have given him a very powerful trail name as he has tremendous energy. Maybe we will cross paths again no pun intended. I do certainly hope to see my new acquaintances again!

After breakfast   I started the approach trail towards Springer Mountain Georgia from the lodge .
The morning was chilly but clear and not raining. My lovely wife and father in law took pictures and video taped me as I made my way up the trail it was a controlled emotional time as deep inside I was wondering what in the world am I doing? Of course I kept the brave face and hiding smile as I waved and walked off into the clouds.
I hiked alone most of the day  but met several day hikers and a trail ambassador named Jason who will be doing a thru hike this year. Brandon caught up with me and we hiked together for about a mile or so. That is the cool thing about this trail, you can hike your own pace feel totally alone but reality is there are hikers all up and down the trail, certainly a feeling of comfort!
I made it to the top of springer at around 2:30 pm  a bit tired but no serious pains. Here’s the thing about the approach trail , the 8 miles do not count so after a tough day I only have .2 miles to show for it.
When I arrived at the springer shelter I was greeted by Nick, Julian and Brandon . They had a great fire going and were all set up in the shelter. I quickly joined them and we all broke out our cook kits and had a wonderful dinner.  Slowly but surely our camp began to grow as Daniel from Texas rolled in followed by Bue and Emily and White Flower from Germany also a father son team joined us later as well .So we have four of us in the down stairs part of the shelter and three upstairs and three tents outside.
Hiker midnight came around 7 and we all climbed into our bags. Weird I woke up thinking it was early in the morning  only to see it was 10PM .
Once again I can’t sleep! surprisingly no one is snoring the wind is howling but the temperature seems warmer , sure sign of rain","Springer Mountain

We woke up to a rainy start this morning. I say we as we are developing a small group of hikers that are moving from shelter site to shelter site as a group , this is known as as a trail family or tramily. The forest rangers strictly encourage us to camp in designated camp sites to minimize our impact on the environment.
The goal today was to hike to Hawk Mountain shelter another relatively short Milage day but with some good climbs and descents. 
Brandon our most experienced hiker decided to trek on to the next camp as he arrived to Hawk shelter way before us and would have had to sit around all day waiting for us, the man is a machine to take on additional mileage on a stormy wet day like today!! I hope to see him again soon. 
We did lose the nice lady from Germany “White Flower” today as she decided to go home. Another cool thing about the AT is that if you are ever injured or decide to tap out you are never too far from a car accessible gap. This weather will wear on even the toughest of us and I’m not looking forward to putting on freezing wet clothes in the morning,
We did have three new hikers at the shelter WOW ( words of wisdom) joined us tonight and he is from Australia .  Rooster was already here as he took a zero  (no miles day at the shelter )and Rebel from Arizona. Everyone pretty much has a trail name,we are still working on Julien our 19 year old fresh out of high school hiker. He’s brilliant in many ways and we all want to get him the perfect one.
Most of us are crammed into the shelter except Tex who’s in his tent.
Tex is awesome a big strong guy with a big heart.! 
Tomorrow Gooch Mountain shelter , but this will be a challenging day as first we have to climb Sassafras and then Justice mountain. BTW The AWOL AT guide is a great book to get , David Miller puts this out every year with changes as needed. It is a very comprehensive guide book, map for the AT and you can visually keep up with all on the trail.
Today was a wet, cold, thundering day and I can hear the rain pounding against our shelter but tonight I am safe and dry in my sleeping bag super excited about tomorrow’s adventures!","Springer mountain Shelter

Hawk mountain shelter to Gooch Mountain shelter 7.6 miles
I’ve been having spotty cell service the whole time out here on the trail, so I apologize for the next day delay. I wait till I’m on the top of a mountain and I submit the journal unfortunately I’ve been in a rush as the weather has been super rainy and the wind is extremely strong on those peaks. I really respect those that have journaled from the trail and now understand the difficulty.
I’ve also noticed the milage on my TJ site is incorrect and I will fix it as soon as I get internet. Tonight, Wednesday Feb 20th I’m at Gooch mountain shelter which is 15.7 miles on the AT , remember the first 8.8 miles of the approach trail did not 
count. 
Last night was very cold rainy and windy and I admit it was tough putting on wet gear in the morning . It’s extremely tough when you have to get out of your warm bag in the middle of the night  (twice) us older hikers understand. 
Today I again hiked with Blue Grass and Sunshine I love their company they are so affirming to all of us and I actually trail named Sunshine for her bright beautiful demeanor. As a couple they have been married 5 years and are so sweet to each other. It’s wonderful that they have been able to work it out to hike this trail so young.
The rain today was gentle but steady however it got strong this evening ,however our immediate trail family is all safe and sound in our shelter. Peach and I are the only two up at 7:05 pm (hiker midnight)
Peach is a fine young man recent graduate from UGA and he’s hiking with his dad 188. He’s a former Eagle Scout  and is quite the trail gentleman, yesterday when Wild Flower left us Peach volunteered and carried her pack and escorted her to the closest gap.
Today Webster aka Julienne, Legs and Rooster headed to our next shelter which is 12 miles down the trail, They are hoping to at least cut some of the 12 miles down. WOW did not stay here tonight as well.
So tonight it’s Peach, 188,Blue Grass & Sunshine, Rebel and we talked Tex into sheltering with us versus tenting as is his norm.
We are all in great spirits and planning on getting up at 5am to tackle the 12 miles to woods hole shelter . However we all have wet gear again tomorrow ugh!
Ps I’m uploading on day 4 , wet again this  morning but not as strong and warmer, God is Good!","Hawk mountain shelter

Woods Hole Shelter 
12 miles today 2164.3 to go.
I have cell service at our shelter tonight! I’m sitting here writing under a canopy in front of our shelter at Woods Hole Shelter. And guess what? It’s raining cats and dogs with a little lightening mixed in just as it has all week. 
This morning we woke to Gopher’s (formally known as 188) alarm at 5:00 am. The plan was to be on the trail as early as possible to make it to our next shelter 12 miles away. The plan has been to keep my miles under 10 for the first week but unfortunately this is just the way these shelters are mapped out.
The rain was falling pretty hard so we waited for it to die down and we started our trek around 8:30 am.
We were rewarded with a very nice morning and were able to enjoy some views .The picture in my previous post does not give the early morning sunrise justice, not to mention it is sideways. Earlier I accidentally posted an old picture from October but I have since replaced. 
When we arrived at Woody Gap, Fresh Grounds was set up waiting for us to serve lunch. Tex was already there enjoying the food. 
He served us skillet potatoes with cheese and onions and man was it amazing! He also served us his famous coffee and all kinds of sweet treats. Fresh Grounds is the most awesome trail angel ever supplying thru hikers with free meals at unexpected locations with his Leap Frog Cafe Thank you sir!!! Jimmy a very nice gentleman and important part of our hiker community interviewed me and I believe the clip will be on YouTube soon. He also helped Legs, Rooster and Webster providing them a ride from Woody Gap to Blood Mountain Cabins last night and brought them back to Woody Gap this morning to slack pack that leg. For those that do not know Slack packing is when someone drops you off to hike but holds your pack so that you can get the miles in without the weight of the pack. Also special thanks to Mike for bringing us fresh bottled water which was wonderful. 
Well it’s way past hiker midnight and I have to get ready for my nemesis tomorrow BLOOD MOUNTAIN (insert scary music for effect) Those that have read my October prep hike log remember my first unfortunate encounter. Plus guess what? Yeupp rain is in the forecast. Well the good news is if everyone survives we are getting a cabin at Neels Gap to dry out our gear and clothes and get a hot meal yay! My dear friend Gary and Susan are coming by to see me and are supplying us with Mountain House Meals for our trek. 
Oh I believe the mileage is now showing correctly.

Woods Hole shelter to Neels Gap
3.6 miles 
Last night was another rainy night in a shelter, the difference was we had little mice trying to keep dry with us. They are extremely cute but can chew through your pack if you have any food or smell good items they may want. I don’t believe I’ve mentioned this but on this section of the trail Georgia provides bear proof canisters that we all put our food bags in to prevent all animals including mice from getting our food. I have to digress for a moment, before I ever left for the trail I asked Mr. Perry a dear friend of our family if he knew of a good tick repellent for my beard and he recommended teakwood oil as a natural deterrent. So I researched this essential oil and found out that indeed this was recommended but also cedar wood, Eucalyptus and Lemon oil are all good tick repellents. So I went and bought all of these ingredients and made my own concoction to bring along on the trip. Well this oil smells amazing in my beard especially amongst us stinky hikers but what is really cool is that when I am straining up a mountain and I’m breathing hard the fragrance actually seems to help me somehow. Back to my stormy night in the shelter with the mice. I woke up in the middle of the night and a few inches away a little mouse was scurrying past near my head, Thats when it occurred to me they may think I’m food cause I smell so nice. Well I kept one eye opened the rest of the night and my beard tucked in my bag.
When morning came guess what? give up?.... It was raining pretty hard but we were all in great spirts
knowing we were going into town after a very short milage day known as a Nero. The mice left me alone. Another great pleasure this morning was that we could wear our precious never ever get wet sleep clothes and not don the freezing, wet,smelly clothes from yesterday.
You see on the trail we keep our sleeping bag,a dry shirt, leggings and socks hermetically sealed only to be used for sleep and NEVER to be worn hiking no matter how cold, wet or disgusting the weather might be. The only exception is when you are going into town to do laundry the same day. Today was that day but there was a major obstacle to over come, the tallest meanest mountain on the Georgia Appalachian trail BLOOD MOUNTAIN.
With rain pelting down Sunshine , BlueGrass and I headed north. Tex and Rebel had already left and Gopher and Peach would be following close behind. The climb was really not that tough it’s the descent that is technical. We carefully climbed down slick exposed rock face trying not to slide down the mountain truly dangerous in any conditions but the hard rain made it even more so.
Well I’m proud to announce our Tramily  made it up and down safe and sound and we are all checked into two Blood Mnt cabins thanks to Rebel’s magnanimous generosity .
Thank you Rebel!
When we got to the check in office a pleasant surprise there was Legs, Rooster and Webster our original posse was back together. They had taken a zero today and we were all glad to see each other.
On top of that my dear friend and trail mentor Gary Eggers met us and delivered us wonderful trail magic Mountain house meals and other goodies. Thank you Gary and Susan!
Jimmy the gentleman that interviewed me yesterday has offered to slack pack us tomorrow so I believe it will be Bluegrass, Sunshine and myself. He will drop us off at Hogpen gap and we will hike back southbound without our packs for 6.9 miles in the rain but we will be able to stay in our cabin one more night!","Woods Hole Shelter

Halo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607287,"Saturday morning Feb 23 day 6
While I’m waiting here for the others to rise  I thought I would do a quick gear review Gopher and Peach just took off they will camp out hopefully at lowgap shelter tonight. 
We will see them later today as we will be slack packing SOBO from Hogpen gap . It’s confusing I know but more on that tonight.
Favorite Gear so far;
Leki Trekking poles- I love these poles they give me great confidence with balance and helps relieve pressure on my knees.
Knee compression sleeves medium size. This keeps my knees feel held together while I’m hiking. The compression increases the blood flow and when I take them off at night they recover nicely.
Thermarest. Z seat - most would consider a luxury item and it is but when you have 5 days of rain and you are in your warm comfy sleep clothes you don’t want to sit on a wet bench, log or rock. Also if it’s dry and cold this will prevent the cold ground from sucking your body  heat.  I love it!
Inflatable pillow- tucks in nicely at the head of my mummy bag and stays put thru the night. It’s funny how the small comforts that we take for granted at home are the best. I also love my air mattress.
REI Igneo 20 with thermo reactor liner. This sleep kit has kept me very warm. On the coldest night I sleep with ice breaker 200 long underwear bottoms and top lightweight North face fleece. Light weight Merino wool balaclava on my head and once I added my R2 Patagonia fleece for extra warmth and down booties over my wool sleep socks. I keep my puffy jacket handy and use it as a magic cloak over my head to protect me from things that go bump in the night. Truly if anything I’ve been too warm at night but the Smokies will test me soon.
I love my Altras Lone peak 3.5 with the Awesome superfeet blue inserts my lovely sister in law gave me for Christmas.This combination works very well for me. I use the injiji toe sock liner with Darn Tough socks. No blisters or foot problems so far. Trust me I still love boots and two of our group use them but the trail runners seems the way to go for me. My feet stay amazingly warm even trodding thru creeks. I can’t comment on snow yet but I did bring waterproof socks seal skins which I have been using over my sleep socks and with my camp shoes “Crocks “for moisture protection.
Least favorite Gear
My very expensive Marmot gore Tex proshell jacket. I’ve had this shell for  several years and recently applied a spray type water repellent. But the jacket leaks just like the cheapest ones out here and it’s probably several ounces heavier. Also I’m not too pleased with my BP paclite goretex pants as I’ve gotten wet down there as well. I know everything gets wet out here in this kind of mess but my point is save $400 and by cheaper rain gear. Halo tip of the day.
Pump up sack doubling as a pac liner- for me the process is too slow and it’s not a waterproof liner I’m switching back to a white compactor bag and blowing up by mouth.
Sadly my worst gear fail are my shoulder straps on my Back pack.
They slip and one time they completely came disconnected.
I’ve tied knots on the end and resolved it for now. Other than that I love this Arc Haul Zip the comfort and weight is spectacular.
I can’t think of any other issues truly I’m pleased with all my initial selections and have used everything except my tent , which is funny because I thought I would never sleep in a shelter. I’m slowly learning!

Halo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607305,"Feb 23 -Day 6 , 6.9 miles.
Today was challenging but easy at the same time. We climbed Levelland, Cowrock, and Wildcat mountain. However we did it going southbound and without our heavy packs. Those of you that have hiked this section know just how tough these mountains are especially Wildcat with its very steep ascent out of Testnatee Gap.
So we were very grateful to Jimmy who drove us to Hogpen Gap and dropped us off so that we could hike back SOBO to our cabin.
The day was supposed to be dry and warmer ..Guess what? Wintery mix hah at least it was not just rain.
Actually the rain was light and with the light pack we were in heaven. 
Sunshine left us in her dust today as she is a racehorse going down mountains. She would be kind enough to let us catch up from time to time but she was super-strong today. Blue grass and I enjoyed our more careful descent as we both are previous knee injury victims and 
for us descending is harder on the knees. Speaking of knees Rebel took a zero today as he’s trying to heal his knees . I gave him my braces (secretly unloading weight) hopefully they will help!
Going southbound was fun as we saw Legs, Webster, Rooster, Gopher and Peach heading to Low Gap shelter. Jimmy will drop us off tomorrow at Hogpen with our fully resupplied loaded packs and we will head north and hopefully join them again tomorrow night.
Again thank you Jimmy for the wonderful service you provide to all of the hikers!!
I wanted to also say Blood Mnt cabins are fantastic! Very roomy and clean , Misty is wonderful and serves a fine breakfast and lunch. She also takes care of your laundry.
Thank you Beaker for your suggestion.

Today was a beautiful day!
Currently it’s 38 degrees and will drop down to 31 with 10 percent chance of snow.
What  glorious weather compared to all the rain we have had so far. Jimmy came by our cabin a little after 7 and we loaded up our gear and he drove us back to Hogpen gap.
This time we have our extra heavy packs as we’ve resupplied our food for the week. The trail was beautiful with spectacular Mountain Views. The hike to Blue mountain shelter was not terribly hard but almost 12 miles of ups and downs and scrambling over rocks. Tomorrow’s 8 miles will be much harder as we have two major mountains to tackle.
Tonight is the first night I’ve slept in my tent. It’s more private,warmer and no little fellas running around chewing up things.
I hiked most of the day by myself
I sat on a log for over an hour overlooking the mountains in the distance. I was sad today even though everything was so beautiful. You see Sundays are my family and church family day . In my previous job I traveled a lot through out the week but I was usually always home for the weekend. Saturday morning I often went fishing etc, But Sundays were always with my family and church family. So I as I walked I prayed prayers of thanksgiving and after talking to my wife all was great again!
As I was hiking I met “blind side” I introduced myself and he had spent the night at Low Gap shelter with Gopher and Peach and the rest of the crew. After every one had left and he was the last one a ridge runner* “captain planet “ came by and complimented the state of their shelter. Blindside let her know that Peach cleaned up and swept the shelter and she gave him a special pendant that Blindside asked me to present. Unfortunately Peach did not stay at this shelter tonight. I’ll catch him eventually that’s the way it seems to work out here.
I did get to meet, “ 20”, Vet, Bear bag, and three others including an 18 year old from Texas that looks 29.
Tomorrow we have a tough day. Sunshine and Blue grass are also in their tent. I am safe and snug in my bag. I’m sure I’ll sleep like a baby!

 Last night got pretty cold on Blue mountain, the wind was intense. I considered it a test for when I hit the Smokies and my equipment worked pretty well. I wore my Ice breaker 200 long underwater, darn tough merino wool socks, down booties,light North face fleece, Patagonia R2 heavy fleece and kept my puffy on my head so that I was not breathing into my bag. I was warm again I have a 20 degree down REI bag and a Sea to Summit thermo reactor liner and I’m on the neo air xlite blow up pad that has a R rating of 3.3 I believe. The pad is important as the ground sucks your heat, so always check the R rating.
Tonight I’m sleeping in my tent again on Tray Mountain but the wind is calm so it will be more tolerable. This morning when I took off the ground was frozen solid , I had to stop and dig out my mittens as the liner gloves were not helping.
Today’s hike was 8.1 miles and it started with a gentle elevation to the top of Blue Mnt a little over 4,000 feet and then a descent down to Unicoi Gap at 3,000 ft back up Rocky Mnt at 4,000 back down and finally home at Tray Mnt at 4,500 feet. You get the picture tough climbs but very rewarding views! Today at the shelter I met Papa John from Auburn he’s about my age but in fantastic shape he flies over the mountains like they are standing still... you know what I mean.  Jeff and Molly the Port Charlotte couple I met at Neels Gap is tenting right down from me. Molly twisted her ankle today hopefully not to bad I gave her my KT Tape and I hope it helps. Blue Grass and Sunshine are getting off the trail and plan to take a zero (no miles) at a hotel in Hiawassee.
I’m alone again naturally ( old tune from the seventies) Actually I’m not alone Rebel and Tex are behind and the young Posse is ahead and everyday I meet new characters on this adventure.

I woke up alone on Tray Mountain around 7 a.m , actually it’s not like a deep sleep, I sleep in segments I get tired on one side flip to my back and then to my other side. I need to introduce sleeping on my stomach into the rotation.
Every one else planned to make the 11 miles to Dicks Creek Gap and enjoy the Top of Georgia hiking center asap. They offer thru hiker gear, full resupply options, bunk and shower, which for $35.00 includes free C breakfast and use of kitchen.
They wash your clothes for 7.00 per load. Sunshine and Bluegrass are actually going to take a zero at a hotel with a hot tub which sounds great ! Yay for them!!
I chose to hit another shelter tonight and enjoy this marvelous weather, also I’m still trying to keep my miles low. So far the strategy is working no excessive pains!
It was very nice to have the whole mountain sunrise view to myself. I heated up water for my oatmeal and Starbucks Via instant coffee. The coffee is actually pretty good.
Oh btw I ran out of fuel last night as I was cooking supper , luckily Bluegrass gave me his canister as he was getting off trail today.
Before I left,I fiddled with my pack , I finally have it dialed down to my liking so many adjustments on this pack it really is fantastic.
I hiked all day by myself I did see a lady camping by herself with a large  pit bull companion, it made me miss my four legged son Reagan. He’s a Min Pin that rescued us several years ago. The hike had three very good climbs with the last one Kelly’s knob being the toughest.
When I got to the base there was a GO HALO message written in sticks on the ground . The work of Sunshine and Bluegrass no doubt, they are so awesome and I miss them already. It’s almost like I have know them a lifetime. That first week of bad weather and adversity gave us all a common bond young and old.
I decided to eat my lunch prior to tackling this climb Tuna Creations on soft taco wrap very tasty.
I was making my way up when out of nowhere this young man asked if he could pass, I about jumped out of my skin he was so silent . We introduced ourselves and I would see him again tonight at the shelter site. When I finally arrived he had his tent up and settling in for the night. Shortly after I arrived another young man showed up. They had both slept at Blue mountain the night before and bypassed Tray Mnt where I was at.
Ahh to be young and strong!
Turns out Rebel was at the shelter with them last night , and they did not think he was hurting .That was great news.
Neither of the two young men had trail names yet . I suggested Stealth for the quiet hiker that scared me earlier, And get this , the second one is a student at Notre Dame and he’s taking the semester off however he’s brought his physics book with him to study. He rejected Einstein, Professor, etc but is warming up to the name ....Physics!
I’m so talented at naming people lol. 
So at every shelter people sign in and leave notes to others behind. Physics left an equation and will start leaving physics problems for others to solve! I bet they can too, I’ve been amazed at all the smart ,bright, intelligent young people I have met.
Maybe I’m not crazy after all! But sadly I don’t do physics.","Tray Mountain Shelter

I had my clothes washed , showered and they shuttled us into the bustling metropolis of Hiawassee. Actually the town is great and everyone is super friendly. I mailed back my light weight NF Fleece,Columbia long sleeve shirt, a little mirror basically items that I have decided are duplicates or not really needed.

Day 11,
My first Hostel stay was very nice
Top of Georgia Hiking Center is very clean and the people there are very nice.
I woke up early this morning  and studied my guide book with my red headlamp to map out my day. Most everyone intended to shoot for either Muskrat Creek shelter a bit over 11 miles or Standing Indian an additional 5 miles. I decided to play it by ear after all I’m a grown man and can hike the bigger miles if I want.(peer pressure)
Everyone woke up and we all went to the hostel lobby at 7am and had their continental breakfast which only consisted of four different cereals and milk. That was perfectly fine with me as I was still full from the night before plus they had coffee my power drink.  We were instructed that the shuttle for the trailhead would leave precisely at 8:00 am . Togs, OTB, Farmer and I were the only ones going. Rebel, Iron Will and Yvette were staying back to take a zero and would hit the trail tomorrow. 
I let everyone take off ahead of me as I did not want to keep their pace although I was feeling froggy this morning and had intentions of seeing how fast and far these new legs of mine would go. 
Well reality set in pretty quick as the climbs were getting harder coming out of Dicks gap. My leg strength has improved but my mountain cardio hasn’t kicked in yet. Oh well I’ll hike alone again. I decided to go to Plum-orchard shelter which was four miles in to eat lunch. When I got there my spirits were lifted to see Sunshine and Blue Grass , they had just finished their lunch, they had started earlier this morning and had come from their hotel. They were going to do a 9 mile day and tent camp at Bly Gap..Sold I’m in!!! Sunshine’s foot is hurting and she plans to have the specialists at Outdoor 76 in Franklin evaluate her shoe set-up. 
Well I stayed and ate lunch as planned but was excited to have the shorter day and be able to camp out with my old friends .
The trails were tough today , Georgia was not going to give up without a fight. But finally, finally I reached the North Carolina line.
I hiked the entire Georgia section and never fell that may be some kind of record I think I’ll celebrate at another AYCE restaurant soon ! Georgia is beautiful my favorite state on the trail so far.

Unfortunately the rain picked back up around 6 am just when I thought I was getting up so I laid there in my bag planning my journey hoping I would catch a break later today and be able to enjoy the spectacular view from Standing Indian Summit I’ve heard so much about. “B” had shot me a text several days ago and highly recommend it. That young man is quite the hiker and way up the trail.
My pace has been slow and steady thus far, I’ve been rewarded with no injuries and that’s awesome however every time I make new friends I get left in their dust. Fortunately when my friends take a zero like Sunshine and Bluegrass recently did I get to catch up again and it’s like a family reunion minus all the great food. 
Today March 1 starts the beginning of the hiker bubble. I last heard over 100 had registered to start the trail today. That is amazing , although the weather has not been great I’m glad to be a little ahead of that bubble.Well I finally got up the nerve and got into my wet clothes and put on my expensive non functional rain gear and retrieved our bear bags and delivered theirs to their tent. Actually Blue Grass did the same for me the other morning . Breakfast was a cold concoction of Starbucks Via mixed in with carnation instant breakfast. It’s my own creation and it’s excellent. Setting up and breaking down camp in the rain is miserable but with care can be done effectively. Unfortunately I had to pack out a wet tent that feels like it weighs five extra lbs.
I hiked the first part of the day by myself but caught up with Blue and Sunshine at Muskrat shelter and we all had lunch together. We were joined by Whiskey and Ginger a couple that had camped in the shelter before us and they were thinking about staying there since it was raining so hard. They reported that Rebel was with them last night. 
We pressed on to Standing Indian shelter hopeful that we would have room in the shelter. The trails were slick and Sunshine did slip and fall but no injuries. We all slipped and slid all day in the mud. We had to traverse several creeks and in fact the trail had turned into a stream from all the rain making for dangerous footing and slow go.
When we finally got to the shelter we where relieved to have it to ourselves and we quickly got out of our wet clothes into whatever dry we could find. We hung our stuff all over the place to hopefully dry in the wind. Later we were joined by Quinten from Asheville NC and later by Garret from SC.  Two fine young men that are knocking out big miles every day.  We all cooked our ramen etc, ate dinner hung our bear bags and have jumped into our bags. The rain seems to have stopped and the temperature is starting to drop.

Halo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607536,"Day 13 March 2
I woke up to a beautiful day . Garret was up before the crack of dawn as he was planning on a twenty plus day, Quinly was going to travel with him so he also got up early, I was awake and wished them well. Sunshine, Bluegrass and I got going early as well , at least a little bit earlier than usual ,and we were on the trail by 8:30. We were in high spirits as the weather forecast called for a beautiful day no rain! We practically skipped up the rest of Standing Indian Mountain and we were rewarded with magnificent views.
Standing Indian was our first mountain over 5,000 feet 5,435 to be precise !
We would hike together off and on thru out the day , my legs felt strong  and I had it in my mind I would like to make it to Franklin by Sunday afternoon if possible. Sunshine and Bluegrass were on the same page in fact they suggested a 16.3 mile day to reach Longbranch shelter tonight. I agreed with the plan and we took off. Somewhere along the way Sunshine stopped to super glue the inserts in her shoes to keep them from slipping. I kept moving forward at a pretty good clip . The views were amazing today but unfortunately I did not stop long to enjoy them. I kept trekking away and finally got to Betty Creek Gap which was a nice camp site right before Albert Mountain another 5,000 footer. Frozen, and another nice hiker I had met earlier today were already set up to camp. I decided it was best for me to set up camp after 11.3 miles it was right at 3:30 and my target was still five miles away . Soon after Whiskey and Ginger showed up and set up camp. Yvette stopped by to say hello but kept on going ,wanting to tackle Albert mountain while it was nice as it’s supposed to rain again tomorrow. Sunshine and Blue Grass 
Finally made it to my camp site but they too wanted to press forward and hopefully have a 16 mile day and have Franklin within striking distance. I’m sure they will make it and I would have loved to press on but this ole horse had enough climbing for today. 
I finished setting up my camp ate and hung my bear bag. Frozen showed me a great little loop knot for my PCT bear hang.
We all talked for a bit and then went back to our respective tents and hammocks. Today was my favorite day so far, the trails seemed relatively flat,every hard climb was rewarded with an amazing view. I heard the beautiful views can bring tears to a grown man’s eyes. I was wearing sunglasses so no one really knows and I’m not telling.
Tonight no cell reception unfortunately, but I will post hopefully on top of Albert in the morning.
I’m tucked away in my bag in my tent. Snug as a bug . The weather is nice tonight hopefully the rain won’t start till after I break camp in the morning. I’ll hit my first 100 miles tomorrow as I’m at 97.2 ooh rah!","Standing Indian Shelter

Halo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607553,"Day 14, March 3
I love reading the the guest book entries  hearing from old friends and new friends that I have yet to meet.
I read them every time I have web access and I appreciate everything you have to say, recommend,well wishes and prayers. I got tickled at Jenna’s comment about pride comes before the fall, last night as I was gathering water for the evening I slipped and almost slid into the creek, no one saw it thank goodness. Also today at the end of my hike in the rain I busted it again so I’ve got to fess up to my trail friends and let them know I’m not invincible. David I agree with your comment about a live book, that’s the way I feel as well and just hope it has a happy ending.
So this morning I woke up super early and planned to be one of the first out of camp. However Frozen, Ginger and Whiskey got the jump on me , still I was on the trail by 7:00. I was excited that it was not raining which is such a relief as taking down a wet tent and packing it is miserable and you haven’t lived till you have to dig a cat hole in the rain. Here’s a million dollar idea; Somebody needs to invent waterproof biodegradable extra soft toilet tissue. That would be more useful than the internet out here on the trail!
My legs felt great even after yesterday’s 11. something Day so I loaded up and took off with a quick pace my goal was to cover 12.2 miles and reach Winding Stair gap where I would hitch a ride into Franklin NC. 
The first part of the trail was beautiful, the sunrise picture on my earlier post was actually from today. The trail was narrow with a sudden drop off but instead of being scared I felt I was in control walking above the clouds . The mountain grew steeper as I approached the summit    of Albert Mountain. I actually had to set my poles aside and hand over hand ascend the rock face it was incredible, exhilarating and scary all at the same time. When I got to the top there was an old abandoned fire tower that is maintained for hikers to safely climb, So I did and the view was amazing. Oh I need to back up , as I was climbing the rock face I heard drumming almost like the way a basketball sounds if you drop it slowly accelerating the rhythm but deeper like the drums the natives play in old Tarzan movies. I heard this maybe three times. If anyone has ever been on this climb you know it could not be a person creating this sound.I suspect Indian spirits, Big Foot or Grouse.  Grouse can make strange drumming noises that are uncanny and hard to localize.
After taking a 1 hour break, Flyboy, Jerry who’s suffering from major blisters, Safety Chute and one other all showed up to climb the tower. I didn’t ask them if they heard the tribal drumming.  I started booking it to make up time man I was feeling strong. The hike was going great and I anticipated reaching Winding Stair Gap by 3 pm. Rhonda had called ahead and found a Church with evening service I could visit which was awesome all was great when boom the sky opened up and within minutes the temperature dropped. I quickly put on my rain gear and pack cover. Man how the rain makes the miles so much tougher and I had to deal with the last endless mountain of the day trudging through stream crossings and the trail itself becoming a creek. It was at the very end, I could see the road, I took my eyes off the game and I slipped and fell and was now covered in mud.* I wouldn’t expect anyone to pick up a wet hitchhiker in those conditions. 
When I got to the highway Flyboy and Ray had not called a shuttle and were unsuccessfully trying to flag down a ride for the past 15 minutes.I called Sunshine and got the number of their hostel but could not get an answer at the hostel . I tried another hostel and the same, the cell service was lousy . A sweet little old man and his wife pulled over in their small pickup and we were about to jump in the back  when Ron the owner of the hostel arrived in his van we were ecstatic to see him, seriously we would have died of hypothermia if we had jumped into the bed of that pickup we were a good 10 miles away.
Well we finally made it to town. I got a private room at Baltimore Jacks so I could spread out my gear and will officially take my first Zero tomorrow. I showered caught a lift to church and worshiped with some fine Christians . One of them gave me a ride back after service and I ordered a large 5 topping pizza which I devoured all by myself.
In my haste to get here today I skipped lunch.
*I wanted to end on a serious note and refer back to my slip. Last year a young man ended his hike literally at the Neels Gap mountain crossing store when he tripped on the curb and fractured his leg. When we are exhausted and we let our guard down is when we are the greatest risk of harm.  So please those that are starting or on trail don’t ever let your guard down!
Well I’m in my room ,I’m looking forward to adjusting my gear sending back what’s replaced.
I plan to replace my rain gear it’s too critical and the Smokies are coming up. I’m also replacing my  Fjall Raven Vida pro hiking pants with something lighter and stretchier. 
The Vida Pros are great but way to heavy especially when wet. Keep in mind I’ve only had three full dry days since I started on the 18th of February. All is wonderful and  can’t wait to get back on trail after my Zero!","Betty Creek Gap

Halo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607591,"Day 15, March 4
I enjoyed sleeping in a bed last night, I did toss and turn quite a bit just like I do in the tent but all in all definitely better rest than usual. 
I got up at 6:30 am to get all of my tasks completed.
The first order of business was to do my laundry which the washer and drier was located in a little room in the back of the building,$2.00 to wash and $2.00 to dry, however they provide the detergent so not to bad of a deal. I decided to walk down the hill to find coffee while my clothes washed ,when I ran into Legs what a great early morning reunion, I later saw Rooster but unfortunately was not able to see Webster. Somehow since I’m quite a bit older I feel responsible for all of these fellas, and I’m always relieved to see they are still on trail healthy and happy.
I found out later that Sunshine and Bluegrass saw Peach and Gopher on their way out Sunday before I had arrived.  It’s terrific that we are all still within a days hike of each other.
Turns out a zero day on the trail is really quite a busy day not as relaxing as I would have imagined. I still have all of my gear laid out , my food to pack and a couple of minor repairs to perform before I hit the trail. 
I did go to Outdoors 76 hiker store and replaced a few items. I bought a new pair of rain pants the North Face Venture with their Dry Vent technology this replaced my older and heavier BP Paclite Goretex rain pants . Supposedly these will work better.....Also according to the resident rain gear expert my Marmot Exum was not designed to be a rain jacket but as an Alpine shell layer which would repel snow and was quite heavier than a true hiker designed rain jacket like their Arc’teryx Traverse jacket.. Cha Ching item number 2 in my bag.
Next I wanted to invest in hiker pants that were not so heavy and that would be more water resistant, dry quicker and have stretch for climbing these mountains. I replaced my Fjal Raven Vida Pros which I absolutely love they are probably designed for a harsher environment and are in my newly formulated opinion based on my two weeks experience, an overkill for the AT but mainly once they get wet they are hard to dry out  so I bought a pair of Mountain Hardware AP pants, item number 3.
It’s supposed to be 17 degrees in the Valley tomorrow and probably 10 degrees with a wind chill of minus 3. I bought a midweight Minus 33 brand merino wool 230 grams base layer to primarily become my sleep shirt  and I will hike with my Ice breaker 200  and if needed use both in conjunction.I will send back my Armor All Heat Gear shirt back home , item number 4.
So having rain gear that is not functional is too dangerous to play around with once the temperatures drop, As you know we’ve only had 3 solid days without rain since I’ve been on trail so I know it’s extreme however I expect and depend on this gear for survival -Food Water & Shelter no frills nothing else that’s all I’m asking for. It pains me deeply to have to buy more gear I’m not an expert and I hear so many things but here is what I know for a fact , Sunday I was wet and cold to the bone shivering the whole way down to the hostel with the heater on full blast in the van ,not warming up until I got in a hot shower. I pray this stuff will work I won’t always have a warm van or hot shower to save me.
After  all of my equipment purchases I had to hoof it to the post office to send my discarded items home. Later we made a trip to Walmart for our resupply for the week.  We did get to enjoy some fine meals today, an AYCE lunch Buffet and a great hamburger for dinner so that was extremely satisfying. I gots to meet Triple Check and LoneStar at dinner and that was great as I’ve enjoyed TC’s blogs.
That was pretty much my day, we’ve pushed back our departure time from 9 to 11am to give us more time to organize and pack up and hopefully the temp will warm up a bit. Tomorrow we are back on trail !!!!",,View Entry,"Mar 04, Mon",0

Baltimore Jack Hostel to Siler Bald Shelter  4.2 miles.
I woke up early to gather all my gear together that I had strung up everywhere in my room. I super glued a minor repair on my pack, separated all of my groceries by days and packed up my little black backpack (Stroke 9 for all the old alternative rock fans).
Blue Grass, Sunshine and I went to breakfast and met Rebel who had showed up in town , Rebel is still struggling with his knees and will stay in Franklin another day or two. 
Pantry, Hiking Home and several others are going to take another town day because the temperature is supposed to drop to 12 degrees with a possible windchill of minus 4 tonight.
We decided we would go for it and sleep in the Siler Bald Shelter tonight. Ron drove us from the hostel and dropped us off at Winding Stair Gap. What a difference the day from when I arrived Sunday in the bone chilling rainstorm, today was absolutely beautiful,cold at 31 degrees but not a cloud in the sky. We started our ascent and quickly I needed to stop to strip out of my R2 fleece. There is a saying in the hiking world to hike cold in other words do not work up a sweat when the weather is like this or you will freeze when you stop. So I  purposely and deliberately made my way up the mountain. 
We all felt pretty good as we had a solid day of rest and good town food. We know that tonight the temperature drop will test our gear and resolve beyond its limits. We all have approximately 20 degree down bags , I say approximately because Blue and Sunshine have custom made bags made by a friend. We also all have thermo reactor liners and r rated sleep pads and space blankets (lightweight foil reflective blankets $2.99 at Walmart )which will go between the pad and our bags. I actually wrapped my entire pad with it as most of your body heat is loss from the ground. I don’t like to wrap the space blanket on top of me as it makes me sweat which causes issues later. 
So here is what I’m wearing to sleep in ; my smart wool balaclava with my LL bean toboggan on top,my buff around my neck, my new merino mid-weight base layer top, my Patagonia R2 fleece, my icebreaker merino shorts and long underwear, I’ll also wear my new stretchy pants that are super comfortable, darn tough socks with down booties and I’ve inserted disposable hand warmers in each down boot . I laid my rain gear on top of my bag to shield the wind and I’ll have my down puffy over my head and If necessary I can put it on .Ill sleep with all my electronics and water filter. I’ve emptied my water bottles as the have already started to freeze
I believe I’ll be plenty warm and should sleep ok. 
Tomorrow we will take another short day and then a double digit day Thursday, we plan to get to the NOC by Friday Lord willing.
Well that’s it for today, the service is spotty but I’ll see if I can post this tonight.  
But before I go , I want to wish my beautiful bride Happy BIrthday! She turns 39 again tomorrow. Meantime I’m out here eating dirt, freezing, digging cat holes instead of by her side.... Maybe I am crazy!","Winding Stair gap/ Franklin NC

Halo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607684,"Day 17 Siler Bald to Wayah Bald 6.8 miles.
We finally roused out of sleeping bags around 9 am it had warmed up to a whopping 17 degrees . I had ventured out of the shelter a couple of times in the middle of the night and let’s just say it was exhilarating and The stars were the most brilliant I had ever seen. There is something amazing about a crystal clear cold night in the mountain.
I am excited to report that my gear kept me very warm, I actually left my Puffy on after one of my trips out side and I slept very warm. Trips out into the dark are appropriate when sharing a shelter in case someone is wondering.
The day started out cold but soon became perfect hiking weather with views that went for miles. The picture I’ve posted you can see Standing Indian , Albert Mountain and of course Siler Bald. Wayah Bald has a very cool stone tower and sits at 5,342 feet. A short day but good climbing.
Tomorrow we will go 10.6 miles to Wesser Bald.  We are sleeping in a shelter with Connor who is from New York also tenting nearby is Sherpa also from New York and Bak from Wisconsin. I hiked with Cheese burger for a while today she thru hiked in 2014 and is section hiking thru the Smokies she said the Smokies was currently closed to Thru hikers because of the weather however was expected to be open within 48 hours.

Halo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607741,"Day18 -10.6 miles Wayah Bald to Wesser Bald.
Near tragedy yet noteworthy start for the day. So as you know we hang our food bags on either bear cables if available or tree limbs. Well this shelter did not have cables so we had hung our bags on a limb. I got mine down and I was trying to get Bluegrass and Sunshine’s bag down but the line had wrapped around and had gotten stuck. Blue must have heard me struggling and came up and tried his luck. He pulled pretty hard and snap in a flash the whole limb fell down , fortunately the limb totally missed us. So obviously in the wintertime it’s hard to tell the good limbs from the bad they all look dead , but we all need to be more careful selecting our hang limb as this freak accident could have ruined our day. 
After the incident we prepped and ate our breakfast . The day was going to be great for hiking no rain and not terribly cold . We made great time had two major climbs but made our 10.6 miles in very good time . 
We met Q a fellow trail journal blogger at the base of Wesser and he made that last climb go by quickly with our conversations.
I had read Q’s aka Question Mark journal before I had left and told My wife that I surely hope that I’ll run into him on the trail as he seems to be a very nice guy and he is!
We were the first to arrive at the shelter and then came Angel and Momma Bear a sweet mother and daughter team who are from Florida and then Samaritan who is incredibly interesting and funny.
We are all tucked into the shelter as it’s calling for rain in the morning. 
But right now all is perfect! Tomorrow the NOC.","Wayah Bald

Last night in the wee hours of the morning everyone in our shelter heard a creepy yell in the darkness.
Well everyone heard it but me. Supposedly according to Sunshine ,I was the culprit that yelled like a little scaredy-cat in my sleep, however I have no recollection and remember there’s the possibility of big foot or other strange animals out there that may sound like me. 
We later woke up to guess what?
Yeupp rain. Don’t get me wrong, I love rain I really do, as a kid if it was not thundering my Mom would let me play in the rain and I would build the coolest dams and splash through every puddle I could find.
However a week of record cold ending with rain that later turned to sleet can start to beat an ole man down. Not complaining just the facts. 
The great news is my new Arcteryx Traverse jacket and North Face Venture rain pants actually seem to be keeping out the rain. Attention disclaimer, please don’t go out and buy anything just because it may work for me at a given particular moment,
I’ll report how the gear works or fails  as I go along but understand I’ve heard so many contradictions on gear ,that the last thing I want to do is influence someone to spend good money on something that might not work for them. It’s the funny thing about gear it’s a love hate personal relationship. 
My wife recently asked me how and if I’m hurting .The answer is YES!However the pain is moving around to different places . In the words of Nimble Will Nomad “ Your going to hurt but as long as the pain is not in the same place everyday you will be fine” So far no blisters however the wet weather has caused my heel to crack and bleed , kind of painful but good ole superglue and Leukatape to the rescue patched up  and good as new. My hands are the same way. 
So our hike today was relatively short and we were in great spirits again since we would be getting to civilization and later showering and getting a hot meal and a warm bed .Paradoxically I long to be on the trail , yet I long to be off the trail hmmm...
After being pelted with tiny ice balls and rain all morning , we descended into the NOC Natahala Outdoor Center at 11:30 am. We headed straight into the restaurant and ordered the best cheeseburger I’ve had in a long time. Jimmy and Sherry joined us and will magnanimously take us to Wolf Den Hostel in Stecoah Gap and then Jimmy will slack pack us two 15 miles days back to back. Tomorrow he will drop us off at Fontana Dam and we will slack pack sobo back to Stecoah Gap. The weather is supposed to be stormy tomorrow at times. The following day we will hike   From Stecoah Gap back to the NOC ,approximately 30 miles in two days big distance for me but with out my 30lb monster it should be very doable.
Tonight at our hostel we have The very famous world renown Artemis!!
We will be honored to hike with her tomorrow, she’s really just like one of us but has one of the most popular YouTube sites out there. Very funny young lady.
Also I’m rooming with Joel ( Gett’n There)today is his Birthday. And Katarina from Germany is in the next room, it amazes me,  this is the fourth person from Germany that I have had the honor to hike with, not to mention one from Australia and one from Tasmania and two from Canada. Pretty cool to come way over here and do this trail that’s in our back yard!

Well once again I can’t sleep, I would say that’s the one major thing I’ve been missing on this adventure is good rest. I’m laying here in bed this morning listening to the rain pound against the roof at the hostel. By the the way this Wolf Den Hostel is superb , Lonnie the owner is very accommodating and I would highly recommend this place! Today on our hike we will have to be extra careful not to slip in these conditions. You see we will be slack packing with a light day pack and we will instinctively want to move at a quicker pace. 
Jimmy showed up to take us to Fontana Dam where we will slack pack south bound back to Stecoah Gap. The interesting thing is that we will actually have more climbs going this way but not as steep. 
Today we had the honor of having Artemis join our little group. At first the rain was off and on but for the most part the day was fairly nice. 
We made good time and saw several of our friends heading north perplexed at seeing us heading south. 14.2 miles has been our longest day thus far. I did take a slip and fell third time in NC but no harm done. 
We encountered  three loose dogs on the trail I fed them some beef jerky as they seemed to be starving, one of them followed us and Blue was able to call a number on the tag and we met the owner on the trail.
When we got back to the Wolfs Den Hostel,   Sherry, Jimmy’s lovely wife 
Had made us a Mexican Casserole banquet with blackberry and peach cobbler for dessert. It was absolutely fabulous. This couple is so wonderful offering trail magic , slack packing, rides, logistics,dinners and the list goes on to all of us hikers. They have been a true Blessing to us.
Tomorrow we slack pack from Stecoah Gap back to the NOC for 13.6 miles. Should be another great day.  I’m also excited that after my hike tomorrow anther trail angel Terry will take me into Knoxville where I’ll be able to take a zero with one of my life long friends Mike and maybe see my brother and sister in law if they are in town.

Ok it’s a good thing my smart phone is smarter than me , evidently the time sprung forward today. This will actually eventually give us longer days to hike.
Jimmy was right on time to carry us to Stecoah Gap for us to hike south to the NOC. Sunshine, Bluegrass and I will attempt another double digit day, and then I’ll get to go to town and they will go to the Fontana lodge. Terry is going to give me a lift into Knoxville this evening after our hike.
I always like to start and end my day by looking at https://www.atweather.org
You can actually select the state and shelter for weather on the trail .
Of course you need WiFi access but it’s a great site if you do.
The weather turned out excellent today no rain and unseasonably warm temperatures. 
It was great to see some of our friends hiking north coming out of the NOC.  Just like yesterday they first appear perplexed to see us hiking SOBO but quickly understand once they see our daypacks in lieu of our monster packs. Today we saw , Yvette now known as Detour, Papa John, Pantry, Tiger and Smiley formally R2D2, Cowboy up and several more. We met a nice young lady from Finland her trail name is Finish Line! I liked that a lot.
Yesterday the SOBO approach was probably harder than going NOBO however today we certainly had the easier route as the climb out of the NOC is long and brutal.

A much needed Zero day today spent with my life long friends and family. Mike and Tonja hosted me at their beautiful home, provided delicious homemade meals, super comfy bed and will bring me back to the trail all the way to Fontana 2.5 hours away in the morning. Tonja allowed me to raid the pantry and resupply for the week. I also got to spend some quality time with my Wonderful Brother and Sister in law, nieces and great nieces and nephew. Herb, Resa, Heather, ResaMarie,Lexi,Kate and Nolan all made me feel so very special and made me a special sign and a batch of coconut, peanut butter, honey & oats energy balls . I’ve already eaten half of them while laying on the couch. I do feel energized but I’m not moving!
So tomorrow I will start the 70 miles prox trek through the Smokies. 
My bag is heavy with 7 days worth of food . Sunshine texted me that there is a boil water notice on Mollie’s Ridge. That is good to know and will try to get more insight on that for any hikers coming behind.

Halo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607963,"Day 23 -Tuesday March 12 enter the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. 7.6 miles To  Birch Spring Gap campsite.
Super exciting day, I entered the Smoky Mountain National Park!
I have fond memories as a child coming to these mountains hoping to catch a glimpse of a bear. I have spent many a weekend in Gatlinburg skiing , exploring the shops and of course day hiking various trails. My buddy Mike drove me to Fontana Marina exactly where I left off early this morning, I again am so thankful for all he and his lovely wife  has done for me. I’m refreshed and ready to go.
So the trail runs along the lake and the views were gorgeous. The trail takes you to the Fontana Dam Shelter which is lovingly known as the Fontana Hilton because it sleeps 20 people and has an electronic solar charging station and bathrooms and showers close by. That’s pretty fancy as far as shelters are concerned. The trail turns into a paved road and actually  goes over the dam. The water was rushing out and that’s where I saw Iron Will . He was actually taking a zero but was doing a little sight seeing. I actually hiked the entire day by myself most of the hikers are ahead of me. After several pictures and talking to some friendly tourists I made it to the entrance of the park where I had to deposit the bottom half of my $20.00 permit to enter and primitive camp in the SMP backcountry. About 6 miles in, I took a side trail to Shukstack Fire tower and climbed it to the very top for the most majestic view yet! I could see Fontana Dam in the distance as well as the Smoky mountain Range on the other side it was truly amazing. I have to backup and admit I’m a little intimidated by heights especially when there’s a good chance of falling. This tower was perfectly safe but very steep and really the first section was the only one missing a hand rail. 
It was scary,but the views were so worth it!
By the time I crawled down the tower and explored the old ranger house ruins it was 3 pm . I decided to go to the next campsite instead of catching up with the group at the shelter. 
Tonight I have the entire campsite to myself, my tent is pitched , my bearbag is hung it’s 7:12 pm and still plenty of daylight!!! I plan to catch up tomorrow and possibly do

When I awoke this morning at 5am it was pitch dark, I laid in my bag till 6am and decided I would strike my tent ,cook breakfast and hit the trail as I had a big day ahead of me. It was actually very peaceful and calming to be all alone, The bears left me alone last night, or if they did come in to my camp they were very respectful and quiet. 
I was anxious catch up with my Tramily by this evening. 
I went down to the stream and using my headlamp I quickly filled my Cnoc bag to filter my water and I retrieved my bear bag that was hung on the cables. Breakfast was a heated carnation pack with coffee and boom I was on the trail.
I had to use my headlamp to navigate and then the Sun started to rise. It’s so hard to describe the beauty of the sun climbing over the mountains, hopefully the picture gives it justice.
When I arrived at the shelter my friends had slept in from the night before ,I was surprised to See Bluegrass,Sunshine, Detour,Artemis,Getting There all lounging around as they only had a 6 mile day in store. We all hugged and had our reunion moment. This trail has certainly been everything I expected but what I had not counted on was the amazing people I have met and grown to love in such a very short time. 
Well we hiked to Spence Field and the shelter is fantastic as it has a fireplace. We have a family of 7 and 2 additional section hikers in the shelter. It is absolutely the best watching the kiddos play UNO and play with the fire.

The best laid plans.... Wednesday when I went to bed (hah , bag) I had another 10 mile plus day slated for Thursday. Well the mountains had other plans. We awoke to a severe wind advisory with 50-70 mph gusts forecasted in the mountains.
Artemis, Get’n There, Sunshine and Bluegrass made a smart decision to hitch a ride with the family that was staying at the shelter to get off the mountain to town and resupply. They had planned a resupply and Hostel stay Friday so it really was a smart move. 
Somewhere along the trail I lost my good judgment and decided to brave the hike with Q. I mean we are the eldest supposed to be the wise ones right?
Well picture this ; two advanced in years guys climbing good ole Rocky top 5527 ft with almost hurricane force winds , wintery mix rain, no rope.... Super fun now that we survived but I’m telling you I was replaying Sunshine’s warning of how sad she would be if a tree fell on my head, Ouch!
The wind did literally put me in a sitting position sliding down the trail at one point but once we were at lower elevations protected by the the hedges of rhododendrons the hike was not that bad.
Led Zeppelin had a song out in the early 80s “a fool in the rain” If you ever hear it think of me. Parents listen to your kids !
Well we finally made it to the next shelter Derrick Knob, Q the mountain goat that he is ,pressed on to Silers but I stayed put.
Slowly but surely other hikers came in that were behind me Joker,Cowboy-up, Rhythm, Zipper, Perfect, Alaska, Red and several others. Full house in the shelter with 5 tents set up outside. Misery loves company!
Well I survived and thank you for all the inquiries, I apologize for the suspense, the backcountry in the Smokies does not have WiFi and one or two occasional fluctuating bars of cell service.

We had Rain and thunder all night and when I geared up to hit the trail at 8AM it was still slightly raining. 
But slowly but surely the rain subsided and by 11 AM the clouds started to part revealing beautiful vistas that by far are the most beautiful I have ever seen. Hopefully I’ll have WiFi service soon and will be able to post. I completely lost yesterday’s post but will rewrite it later today. 
I felt very strong today and the climbs came easier , however I was stopping quite a bit enjoying the views and breathing the mountain air. I hiked by myself for the most part however Sparky,Young gun,Perfect and Alaska caught up with me at Double Springs Shelter where I had stopped for lunch.
Young Gun, Perfect and Alaska decided they were going to stay at that shelter but Sparky moved on and I Ieft shortly after as well.
The rest of the hike was amazing, the trail from Double Springs led into a pine forest with a carpet of green moss on the fallen trunks and rocks . Truly this is the enchanted forest where the elves live. The smaller pine trees are exactly the type you might have in your living room at Christmas. I wish I could capture the smell of the moss,leaves,pine trees,wet rocks that surrounded me and keep it in a jar so that I could bring it home to share. 
I absolutely Love the Smokies ! The Mountains have been kind to us thus far. Thursday was a little tricky but we all survived.
Tonight we are at The Mount Collins Shelter. I got to hike the last part of the day with Sparky from Switzerland he’s in my age group and is an amazing climber and hiker. Finish Line from Finland arrived just about the time we did 7 PM.  Q ,Joker, Cowboy Up,Chill’n and his service dog were already in their bags when we got in.

Saturday morning was a cool 24 degrees when I woke up. I slept very warm. I am pleased with my sleep system now tested down to 7 degrees; the extra weight of my Sea to Summit Thermo reactor liner  is well worth it , my 19 degrees Igneo REI mummy bag is fantastic. Most every one on trail uses a quilt nowadays but it’s hard to beat the warmth of a mummy bag in my opinion. I’m using a cheap thin space blanket as a ground cloth and I sleep in my icebreaker 200 pants and my new 33 degrees shirt with my Patagonia R2 fleece , darn tuff socks and down booties with either my LLbean toboggan or my smart wool balaclava on my head,And always my head lamp around my neck I think the secret weapon is having my Arcteryx Cerium puffy over my head creating a little airway and not breathing into my bag . I know I’ve covered my sleep system in the past but if you are planning to do the trail this is one of the most important kits you will need. Cowboy Up had to buy a zero degree bag on trail ( we are envious) but now he sleeps super comfy.  Certainly the lower the rating the warmer , I just did not have a zero rated bag but the liner does fortify mine for me. Halo Disclaimer:Everyone sleeps differently this is a super personal what works for me may not work for you kind of thing but wanted to provide a reference.  I’ve got a 19 degree night tonight in the mountains hopefully will never see 7 degrees again until Everest of course.  ( just kidding Rhonda)
This morning was the best ,right before town day prep, we hiked out in our sleep clothes with no concerns of keeping them dry and clean, no cleaning dishes, no rationing TP, we eat what we want if anything at all as town food and resupply is around the corner .
I was especially in high spirits as my brother in law and sister in law Resa and Herb Byrd from the Knoxville area were hiking up to meet me on my way down and then take me to Gatlinburg where they had gotten a room for us!!
We packed up and headed out and about a mile down the trail there they were !They had gotten up super early driven about 2 hours and hiked  approximately 3 .5  miles up the mountain Amazing!!
What an awesome reunion I introduced them to Q ,Sparky and Cowboy Up and we then proceeded to the Gap. Resa and Herb are excellent hikers and had no issues scaling the trails and we made it to the gap in record time. 
They magnanimously offered to carry Finish Line, Q, Sparky and myself into town. We dropped Q and Sparky at the Hampton Inn and we dropped Finish Line at the Lodge of Legends where she joined the Wandering Women and Detour.
Later Resa and Herb treated me to a wonderful lunch at Five guys where I filled up on peanuts, fries and a huge bacon cheeseburger.Then we went to the NOC to check things out , I really didn’t need anything but it’s such a cool store. 
Resa checked us into the Days Inn very clean accommodations with a washer and drier . Resa had brought me detergent, drier sheets and quarters! These two spoiled me with so much trail magic. We watched the Tennessee vs Kentucky basketball game which was quite the nail biter!
After I did my laundry and straightened out my gear Resa and Herb again treated me to  a fine meal at Texas Road house. Did I mention how incredibly awesome these two are!! 
Well tomorrow we will go to Church and later they will take me back to the trail. Depending on the time I get back on will determine how far I will go.","Mount Collins Shelter

I slept wonderfully in my hotel bed last night. I slowly roused out of my bed and quietly worked on my gear trying not to disturb my roomies. 
Resa got up and she went downstairs to check out the breakfast the hotel was offering and she came back with a great report and coffee for all of us. The breakfast was fantastic, Cereal ,eggs, sausage, waffles shaped like a bear,biscuits and gravy ,wonderful !
I got dressed in my Sunday go to church clothes....hiking pants , icebreaker shirt, trail runners and fleece . Well at least they were clean and I had showered twice. 
Church was awesome and surprisingly full of travelers from all over the US. I really appreciate it when I can visit a church on Sunday.These trail towns are used to us hikers and Roger the preacher had actually offered to pick me up trail side ,house and feed me. How awesome is that!.
After a great lunch at a nearby pancake house . Resa and Herb took me up to Newfound Gap and we all took off hiking . They accompanied me half way to the shelter . The views were amazing but so were the crowds of day hikers. Everyone was super nice a lot of college kids on spring break.
The trail leading out was very icy in sections so we were extra careful.
We got to the midpoint and enjoyed a wonderful view we all hugged said our goodbyes and Herb prayed for my safety. I was so sad to see them go ... I made it to the shelter and Cricket was sitting outside in the Sun. There were 6 section hikers already there and the shelter was booked to be full tonight. 
I went ahead and pitched my tent as it’s really my preference and I believe it may actually be warmer and we are expecting a cold night .
As I was unpacking my gear that’s when I realized I had left my puffy in the truck ugh!! Luckily I had cell service and was able to call, Resa and Herb had just arrived at the parking lot and confirmed Ibadan left my puffy. I was about to hightail it back down when Blue, Sunshine and Gettin There came thru and were about to come my way. Resa recognized them and of course they were willing to deliver it to me. Wow what a close call! Thank you Lord, thank you Blue, Sunshine and Gettin there, thank you Resa and Herb!! What a fantastic ending to a great weekend. 
Well the trail fam is zonked out in the shelter , the section hikers have been enjoying an aromatic burger cook out , now I’m starving and craving burgers again.

Happy one month anniversary on the trail! The first month has certainly been a learning /adjusting period. I’ve learned a lot about trail life and gear. I pick up on something new everyday and I believe I’m getting somewhat acclimated .  I’ll try to do a gear spotlight maybe when I get to Hot springs and discuss a few obscure but essential for me items.
I’ve dropped a few pounds body wise in one month ,although I’m trying to eat well. I’ve not stepped on a scale yet.
It’s fantastic to see the physical improvements with Sunshine and Blue Grass at 29 they seem to be adapting much quicker and are becoming very strong  . They smoke me on the climbs. I am still not as efficient on climbing, I consciously slow down every time my heart rate rises , I’ll get more into that on a later date.
 Last night , It was a nice crisp cold night I believe it dipped below 20. I slept very well in my tent , the section hikers in the shelter did stay up pretty late as they are on spring break, good for them, not so much for us but all was good. Kids will be Kids and they deserve to have fun.
We woke up to a seemingly winter wonderland, there was frost all on the trees and the wind was lightly blowing what I thought was snow but later I determined to be the frost from the trees , absolutely beautiful!
The trail along the mountains unfortunately the views were socked in early in the morning but later in the day the weather cleared revealing some beautiful sights!I hate that we missed Charlie’s Bunion view because of the weather, which is a amazing  from what hear. I hiked most of the day with Sunshine , Bluegrass and Gettin there. We arrived at the shelter and tonight we have Artimis, Cayenne , Sparky, Sovereign,Cricket ,Salamander, Cocoa and a couple of others all tucked into the shelter it’s supposed to be colder than last night.

I got up early and decided I would push a little farther than planned and only be 1.1 miles from finishing the Smokies on Wednesday and 3.6 miles from Standing Bear Farm, my next resupply spot. Sunshine ,Bluegrass, and Gettin There slept in and will go 7.7 miles to Cosby Shelter and catch up Weds afternoon at Standing Bear. They have had several big 2 digit days and decided it was wise to recover with a shorter day today. 
I’ve decided that I can do bigger miles but I need to get started earlier so that I don’t have to speed up my pace.
The weather was extremely nice today and got into the 40s . I saw several day hikers and spring break section campers out today. I met a very nice mother and daughter out for a day hike and they are actually contemplating doing a thru hike and they were wondering if wearing eye contacts is an option out here? 
I certainly do not know the answer but if any of you may know please respond in the guest book. The problem as I see it ,is keeping our hands super clean is next to impossible. But maybe someone has some creative ideas.
The hike today was mainly downhill starting at the highest elevation of 6302 feet at Mt Guyout down to 2592 at the Davenport Gap shelter.
One of the guys I’ve been hiking with this week Coco is having some knee issues and the downhills
are the most painful. I can relate going back to my last October experience. He eventually made it to the shelter slowly but surely.
This shelter has a chain link fence around the front for safety from bears  , I have not seen this set up thus far, I’ll attach a picture. We are hearing coyotes howling in the distance . Pretty cool way to end the night, reminds me of an old western movie.
The longer higher mileage day has me tuckered out a bit. I ran out of fuel this morning at breakfast so I can’t heat up my ramen (yay), no big deal I have plenty of tuna and peanut butter and snacks for supper. Tomorrow I’ll resupply and I’ll be back to the tasty ramen dinners soon enough.

They call this place a vortex because you don’t want to ever leave. Tonight I’m sleeping in a bed in the treehouse by a brook. 
This is the first day of Spring and I coincidentally I found my first wild flower in the woods.

Leaving Standing Bear Farm was tough this morning. That place is magical and the people that work there do everything possible to make sure you are comfortable and having a good time. This morning they served freshly made breakfast burritos at 7:00 a.m and I’m telling you they were amazing. After breakfast I climbed back into my treehouse and gathered my gear to head out. 
Cricket, Salamander,Coco and Sparky all left a little ahead of me. 
Sunshine, Bluegrass and Gettin There never showed up last night , it turns out they had hitched a ride back to a hotel in Pigeon Forge as they needed to do laundry and had heard Standing Bear did not have a washer. We will all catch up soon. 
As I was starting to leave the farm one of the dogs I was playing with yesterday came up and pressed his head into my leg begging me to stay. I pet him for several minutes as this pup just stole my heart. A few other hikers were zeroing at the farm so I waved goodbye and hit the trail. Man I will miss this place!
The trail immediately turned into a steep climb up Snowbird Mountain from 1761 feet to 4263 ft for a distance of five miles, but I felt great. Unfortunately the forecast was for nasty weather starting at two this afternoon.
At the top of the mountain I had an amazing view and what was really strange was this building that looked like a space ship. I tried to get closer but all the do not trespass signs discouraged me from really investigating. I believe it has something to do with air traffic control and there were FAA signs.
Around 1:30 the rain started and I quickly got into my rain gear and slipped on my pack cover. I decided I would shoot for the closest shelter, which was only 30 minutes away.
When I arrived Salamander, Soul Shine and Coco were all setting up .”Just a minute” showed up a little later and we all sat around and ate and watched the rain turn into sleet than snow. The cool thing is that I’ve never been in a snow storm with thunder and lightning. However,  I hope the others on the trail are safe. 
The snow has stopped but it is still raining cats and dogs. I’m safe and dry in the leaning shelter with Salamander and Just a Minute. Soul Shine and Coco pitched their tents in this awful weather because this shelter slopes so much.
Hopefully the rain will cease by in the morning because I now need to knock out two back to back  13.1 miles day to make it to Hot Springs by Saturday where I plan to resupply and pick up some medications my wife sent me.

Groundhog Creek Shelter to Walnut Mnt Shelter 13.1 miles
Friday we woke up to a lightly snow dusted forest and the air was clean and crisp. In the middle of the night I had gotten up and ventured outside so it was not a big surprise to see all of the white snow everywhere, in fact I expected to see more accumulation but the rain mix seemingly washed the majority of it away. 
Salamander, Just a Minute, and I had slept in the shelter but Soul Shine and Coco had endured the storm in their tents. 
Salamander was the first to hit the trail followed by Soul Shine Then me. Today would be a day of steady climbing from a level of 2,897 at our shelter to our highest point of 4629 feet. Normally I don’t do climbs very well , but the exciting thing was that the snow got deeper as we ascended and somehow I felt stronger than ever. I turned into a blood hound following the two sets of fresh tracks ahead of me and I was determined to hunt them down.
First I caught up with Soul Shine as she was stopping and taking tons of pictures ,she’s an Iron Man Triathlete and no way could I have caught up otherwise . One more to catch and I would win this game that no one else knew we were playing.  Boom, I saw Salamander and I passed her Yay ! Now I was totally exhausted . I need to grow up but snow makes me feel like a kid. 
The forest was so beautiful with all the ice , amazing that this was the second day of spring.  Ok one of my worries before starting was how would my  trail runners and feet do in the snow ? Remarkably well is the answer. I did not feel cold at all and I was not even wearing my waterproof socks.
We continued up heading towards Max Patch. This is a popular spot for people to come to and enjoy the elevation and views as it is a bald ( clear of trees but grassy area).  Well let me tell you, no one dared to be on the summit bald this day because the winds were gusting close to 60 mph and the snow drifts were over a foot deep. Unfortunately the AT crosses directly across that barren exposed peak and we had to struggle across without being blown off the mountain, the winds, snow and mud made us all stumble and it was a small miracle we made it across.
Somewhere along the way I managed to roll my ankle , not a serious injury but it made the rest of the day a little bit uncomfortable with every step I took. 
In retrospect I should have donned my micro spikes prior to the ascent.
 Finally when we got across the “Patch” we were in a very protected rhododendron path and all was great again. 
We descended into Lemon Gap but had one more tough climb up Walnut Mountain to our final destination. Soul Shine, Salamander, Coco and I all made it to the shelter. Just a Minute decided to stay at the last shelter back.

I started getting ready for the day around 5:30 am. We had all slept in the shelter and all wanted to get an early start to Hot Springs so I knew no one would mind if I accidentally woke them. The morning was cold and well below freezing, I had not gotten water last night when I arrived at the shelter for two reasons . 1. It was way down a hill and I was through climbing. 2. Soul Shine reported the water source was very weak and she had to scoop water from a shallow puddle.
So I decided to pass and water up at a stream on the way today however I needed water for my breakfast oatmeal and carnation so I melted snow with my stove and it worked terrific. I don’t know why I felt so clever for doing that but I did.
I was the first on the trail and at first the snow was not too bad. I stopped at a stream to camel up and Soul Shine and Salamander caught up to me. We proceeded up and over the mountain and that’s when the snow on the dark side became treacherous. I slipped on the ice hardened snow and landed hard on my tail. Instantly Soul Shine and I put on our Snow Spikes and then the descent was much easier. Salamander was way behind as she had stopped to water up at another stream but we found out later she was able to descend without incident . The day turned out to be beautiful and after that last climb it was all down hill into Hot Springs. When we arrived a former Thru Hiker named Walmart Special had pizza, cookies and drinks trail magic waiting for us . We joined The Swedes,Alaska and all of us enjoyed the food and yes it was magical!
The Laughing Heart Hostel was to the left of the the trail head and I went and checked in . Soul Shine, Coco and Salamander all were staying in other locations.
Two 13.1 days back to back days and I was feeling pretty good. My rolled ankle was much better. This small town has a nice resupply outfitter and I had to buy
new camp shoes knock -offs crocks  As I seemed to have lost my originals.

This section of the trail was very interesting and beautiful as it had  ruins from an old building, a dam on top of the mountain , spectacular views of the French Broad River and views of the town of HotSprings . 
I was able to cross paths with several of my North bound friends;
Detour, the Wandering Women, The Swedes, Fast Eddy, Yukon and Pushing Sixty were all heading out of town.  It was great to see them and hopefully I will see them soon.
The weather was especially nice and several day hikers where on-top of the mountain as well as strolling along the paths alongside the French Broad River. 
I descended into town and ate lunch at the Iron Horse Tavern. 
Naturally I had a cheeseburger and this was my favorite restaurant so far. Great service and food I highly recommend it. After lunch I stepped out the door and half a block to the left I was back on the Appalachian trail. That’s right the AT runs flat dab down the middle of downtown HotSprings!
I hiked back (thru town) to the Laughing Heart Hostel, btw this place is fabulous everyone is so nice and the rooms are great. I got a private room and there are three shared bathrooms with showers and three washer and driers , pretty amazing. 
Blue Grass and Sunshine showed up to stay the night it was so great to see them and meet their friends from Kentucky. 
Well late in the afternoon another hiker came up , I had not met this gentleman before and he looked like a cross between John Wayne and Magnum PI ( the original series). It was none other than the famous Father Time Aka Narsil. Alas we finally met ! It turns out we are both from the Central Florida area and are both journaling on trail journals and  Q another one of my favorites was right there with us, we all caught up and made plans to eat breakfast Monday morning and hopefully Gator will join us as well.
I feel like I should be getting autographs as  we are all characters in this intertwining live book we are in. 
I finished up the day with having dinner with Q , Sunshine, Bluegrass and Papa bear at the restaurant by the river the name escapes me but it’s got this great porch that overlooks the stream which is loaded with trout but it’s catch and release only.

My last morning at Laughing Heart Hostel. It sure has been a pleasure staying here and slack packing these scenic mountains around Hot Springs, This morning I had breakfast with Narsil, Q and Gator at Smoky Mountain Diner. It was a pleasure meeting Gator for the first time, I had read about him in Narsil’s journals so I felt I already knew him. 
Shortly after my delicious breakfast I went to Dollar General to resupply on a few items. DG ,Dollar stores are fantastic for resupply if you are ever near one. After that I went back up to the hostel took a last shower for the week and packed up to head out. Guess what is in the forecast for today ? 
Well I started hiking down the highway to come into town when my buddy Ben Hayes  drove by as he arrived into town, it was now a little before noon. Ben is hiking with me this week and had gotten up super early and had driven here all the way from Muscle Shoals Alabama.
Ben picked me up at the bottom of the hill and we went to the outfitters to meet Wild Bill our shuttle driver. We followed Wild Bill to Devil Fork Gap where we would leave Ben’s Vehicle.
It was so funny Wild Bill said he never speeds and it would be easy to keep up with him....maybe if you are a Nascar driver lol. These mountain roads were so curvy! We finally got to a very remote spot off the road to leave Ben’s SUV. I sure hope Ben’s car will be ok there as this is a pretty secluded area. I got a feeling no one will mess with one of Wild Bill’s clients. From there we all jumped into Wild Bill’s van , I got into the back seat. Big mistake I started turning green after the upteenth curve at light speed. We finally arrived at Tanyard Gap and I headed straight for the woods to settle down . Once I composed myself Ben and I took off up the mountain it was 2:30 PM but we only had 5 miles to do unfortunately straight up the mountain and with steady winter mix. Ben did awesome he’s one tuff dude to climb these mountains in these conditions on his first day. He never complained even though he got soaked to the bone. 
When we finally got to the shelter it was late and filled to capacity. Cricket, Salamander, Haymitch, Shine and Puff were not asleep but already tucked away in their bags . 
No problem, Ben and I quickly set up our tents and then we cooked our meals and got ready to retire. 
Salamander asked if Ben had a trail name yet. Well two minutes later Ben returns from his tent in his sleep clothes, a bright red fleece with red and black plaid pajamas.
It made every one happy to see Ben so apparently comfy and we
expected to see him pull out his house coat next. 
Well as you can imagine everyone had suggested trail names at that point and the shelter finally dubbed him Snuggs  short for Snuggles. ( a manly trail name) 
We went to bed with the coolest sounds of owls hooting and making unusual mating calls in the distance and the guess what ? Rain all night.
So far I’m dry safe and warm in my tent. The poor owls are probably soaked. Snuggs had a tough intro to the AT yet he’s smiling and bringing smiles to all of us!","Tanyard Gao

We proceeded to whip up our breakfast which unfortunately was not that good, Iso lean packs heated with coffee was yuck so I added oatmeal and some thing similar to cracker jacks and it made it tolerable.
Snuggs had struck his tent , packed up his gear and was ready to go long before I even thought of taking down my tent as I wanted it to dry a bit. So he took off by himself, fearless I like that. The trail is well marked and I know you all are worried after seeing him in his red pajamas but he is quite the woodsman in-fact he had brought me some of his deer jerky he had made. I didn’t give it a second thought and looked forward to catching him down the trail.
It was 11 am and the fog still had not burned off and my gear was actually getting wetter, so I threw all of my wet stuff into my bag and put it into high gear to catch up with Snuggs. After an hour of almost running I still had not seen the boy and I started wondering how I would explain losing him on our second day. I finally ran into a south bound hiker and he confirmed Snuggs was less than a mile ahead so I poured it on and caught him right before Allen Gap approximately 4 miles . Turns out Snuggs was trying to lose me , pretty cool game of cat and mouse. Boys playing in the woods! There was a home made sign at the bottom of the trail 100 feet to a general store . I don’t remember reading anything about a store out here in the boonies was this a score or some kind or a  trap for hikers?Well we raced down the hill throwing caution to the wind and we saw what looked to be an old abandoned  gas station. We took off our packs and entered. 
Very rustic old wood floors , wood burning stove dark but warm and inviting.
The name of the general store is the State Line Store and it was built in the fifties . It basically sits on the TN NC line. The 67 year old man running the store is the son of the original owner and owns the tavern up the road as well as several buildings and properties around this pass.  Today was his first day opened this season. Snuggs and I both got hot pockets, chips, Powerade and an ice cream and sat and ate in two old comfy chairs as we listened to the old man’s stories. In time my eyelids started to feel heavy and I looked over at Snuggs and told him we were in a vortex and needed to leave right away. 
We bid our farewells, thanked him for his store, hoisted our packs and climbed up the mountain. Indeed this little store was a great find!
When we arrived at the shelter we had enough daylight to run a line and hang our wet clothes and tents.
We were the first one there but were later joined by,Good Karma, Bumblebee, Space Bean, Hurley and Recon.
We all sat around cooked and laughed about the day’s adventures and then settled in to the shelter.
Much needed dry sleep.
A much better second day for Snuggs!","Spring Mountain Shelter

Little Laurel Shelter to Jerry’s Cabin Shelter. 7.3 miles.
Ok I may have said this about another area before but this section is the most spectacular section of the AT thus far, The views and climbs today were amazing!!!
That’s right three exclamation points. Snuggs and I climbed hand over hand over boulders to traverse Big FireScald Knob , this section can be treacherous in in-climate weathers it is an exposed trail at 4,566 feet , amazing views on either side of the trail and at times you feel like you are on a tight rope.
This trail has a bypass in case of high winds, lightning or if rock climbs and heights are not your thing. I’m not going to lie , I have a healthy respect for heights but if you can stomach it, I would so highly recommend you experience this section of the trail and view what is touted to be the best views until the Whites in New Hampshire. The AT Guide lists this section as rocky and strenuous and I certainly agree but it’s very doable.
I need to back up as I skipped our first part of our hike.  When we left our shelter this morning we  hiked straight up Laurel Mountain, Snuggs believe it or not grew some mountain goat legs in just three days and had no issues summiting this climb. We had some pretty amazing views from the Blackstack Cliffs. We met a seasoned section hiker named Rick trail name slacker and he gave us a lot of inside scoop on the trail. Years ago before the government owned this mountain there was a Ski lodge up on Jones meadow, we could see the old lift and remnants of the lodge from a cliff afar. The Story is Elvis Presley (a famous singer from back in the day kids)  flew up and was interested in investing in this resort but the land was acquired and became part of the AT.  This info has not been verified but seems like a good story to share.Slacker also seems like a reliable source. Somewhere along the trail we met thee campers providing trail magic for the thru hikers and we enjoyed soft drinks, oranges and snacks. People are amazing!
Talk about amazing there is a family   with four girls the Malone’s thru hiking ;
Dad Papa bear , Mom Sunshine, eldest daughter 11 Years Horse power, second daughter Sparkle Machine, third daughter Wild Jay... and the cutest of all five year old Bunny Rabbit. The parents are very experienced hikers and I wish I had all the little girls  energy . Super Girl Power!

We scheduled to have a fun day today and take side trails and visit the Shelton Cemetery. The AT has so much history surrounding it and often I don’t take the time to stop and embrace the local history. I’ll put a link to the full story of who the Sheltons are, but a short  readers digest version is back during the Civil War 13  boys and young men were accused of being Union Sympathizers and were executed. 
The youngest was 13 years old  and his family name was Shelton. Very tragic. I must warn you the story is extremely sad. 
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wik...
Snuggs and I. had the honor of having Q join us today, he was all about taking some side trails and enjoying some views.
Our first major climb was up Big Butt Mountain. I’m not kidding that is the official name of the mountain. Q  was singing “I hiked Big Butt and I cannot lie” all day obviously a parody of the old M.C Hammer hit song. The view was pretty amazing  off this mountain.
Tonight is Snuggs last night on the trail and we are already missing him. He’s brought a lot of joy to all the hikers he has met and the hikers are already leaving him notes in the shelter log books. 
Q ,Snuggs ,Paris,Thigh Gap,Yvonne,Skywalker, Moss, Starcrunch ,  Hollywood, Scooch, Walking Home are all at the shelter tonight.

Friday ,we woke up and hiked to 2.5 miles Devils Fork Gap where we had dropped off Snuggs vehicle earlier in the week. Snuggs Aka Ben Hayes has a speaking engagement in Rome GA this weekend and unfortunately has to leave us . It is amazing the transformation Snuggy went through in such a relatively short period. He can now climb mountains, eat dirt and dig cat holes with the best of them. We knocked out over 30 miles of some of the prettiest and most strenuous sections of the AT this week. I’m guessing of course but I believe Snuggs has been bit by the AT Bug and will probably be back at some point. 
When we got to the gap, Jimmy was there handing out Trail Magic. He had told me he would be there if he could but I had not had cell service for the past two days and we had not communicated so it was a very pleasant surprise to see Jimmy and all the goodies he had for all of us. Scootch, Thighgap, Hollywood and others all gathered to enjoy.
Jimmy also offered to slack pack three of us over to Sam’s Gap approximately 9 miles away, he gave us day packs to carry our essentials-food for the day, rain gear, head lamp, water and water filter and cat hole kit. The weight savings of not carrying our sleeping bag, tent and heavier packs is amazing and we felt like we were flying over the mountains. Thank you Jimmy for all that you do!!!
The mountain views were once again spectacular and I really liked a small waterfall that a few hikers actually got in and cooled off .
When we made it to the Gap there was a nice lady offering trail magic and I had a coke and an orange.  Again people that offer trail magic surely are Angels, 
Jimmy took us to
Natures Inn Hostel from Sam’s Gap.
This Hostel is very nice Taft and Rare Find are excellent proprietors.
They offer small cabins for rent by the creek or standard bunk rooms. It’s also a great place to resupply.

I woke up in our little cabin raring to go. It’s always amazing to me how a goods night rest will reenergize my body. Before I came out to the trail I worked out with my trainer Joe at LA Fitness in Orlando and he would always stress how important rest,stretching,nutrition and recovery is in the muscle building process. Unfortunately it’s been difficult for me to rest well on the trail so these opportunities to sleep in a bed are awesome. I’m trying to do a good job on my nutrition but I seem to be running on a calorie deficit as I’m still losing weight. I did enjoy  my “civilian” food last night hotdogs and birthday cake and I ate Jimmy Deans frozen sausage and biscuits for breakfast this morning. 
Not the best nutrition but lots of calories!
Jimmy drove Q and I back to Sam’s Gap to start our trek toward Spivey Gap.  Yesterday’s 11.2 miles was just a warm up for today’s planned 13.4 miles. I plan to eventually average 15 miles per day and I need to start increasing my daily mileage .  The only problem is I’m currently trying to heal my ankle and have to be careful not to make it worse. 
When we got to the gap Zoomy  ,Cookyman  and Ito,  three fine trail angels were providing homemade cookies, oranges,coffee Krispy Kreme donuts and other delightful edibles for all the hikers coming through. Narsil had stealth camped  the night before somewhere near the gap and came back down to enjoy the magic as well .  After thoroughly enjoying the trail magic we started our slow long climb out of the gap. Narsil showed us his stealth camp on the way up and he would later break camp and head north as well.
We had approximately 7 miles of climbing ,climbing,climbing some parts of the trail were very steep. 
But eventually we hit the summit at 5516 feet and we were rewarded with what is now the most awesome view on the trail so far. Big Bald had 360 degrees views of the surrounding mountains and we could see for miles and miles it was so clear today. We all stayed up there for a good long time. Reluctantly we started the descent to Spivey Gap. The high Mountain View’s is what it’s all about!
When we finally got to the gap we were pleasantly surprised to find Trail Magic provided by Bear Bag and Mrs. Bag. They cooked us the most wonderful hotdogs at the end of a very hard day. Very magical indeed. 
We all stealth camped  around a creek near Spivey Gap, tonight it’s just Q, First Grader, Narsil and Myself tenting . Jimmy is camping in his truck and will slack Q and I into Erwin tomorrow. 
Today we heard packs of coyotes howling and barking all around us but tonight the only thing stirring are the owls.
I’m safe and sound in my tent but guess what?  Yes the sky is weeping again but even better  it’s going to turn to snow, I’m super excited about that ! After all we are heading to town and will be in a warm bed tomorrow.","Sam’s Gap / Nature’s Inn Hostel Tn.

Spivey Gap  to Erwin 11.1 miles 
I got up early and started gathering all of my gear within the protection of my tent as  it was still raining outside. Earlier in the wee hours of the morning I had awoken to a drop of rain hitting me flat in the middle of my forehead, one of the seams had developed a small leak which I attempted to fix with cuban fiber repair tape. No biggie,this temporary patch would have to suffice until I could purchase some seam sealer in town. 
I pulled up the weather on my Delorme Inreach and it called for heavy snows in the mountains starting at 10 am this morning .
Q , Narsil and I headed up out of the gap and sure enough it started snowing almost immediately. 
It was wonderful hiking in the snow, Winter is trying to hang on as long as it can. I’m personally rooting for Winter to hang around a bit longer as I know how miserable 100 degree weather can be. Hiking in the winter is the best in my opinion, the views are not blocked by foliage, the air is comfortable once you get moving  and we don’t sweat and smell as bad. Not to mention the bugs are not out yet. Although it was snowing pretty hard the accumulation was negligible and passage was easy.
As we got closer to Erwin we could see the town and the Nolichukee river from the mountain top. The trail led down practically to the doorstep at Uncle Johnnys Hostel which has a nice outfitter store. We did not plan to stay there as Jimmy had arranged to pick us up and take us to the Motel 8 ,a very nice clean hotel in town.  Jimmy also took us to Walmart to resupply where I had to buy another pair of hiking pants as the others I bought in Franklin are already too big . We then went and ate fried chicken until we were stuffed. 
Q and I walked over to the evening service at a church next to the hotel. The people were very nice and the lesson was very good!
Tomorrow we will hit the trail again.

Monday, Jimmy drove Dudley Do-Right, Dynamite, Q and I up to the top of Beauty Spot Gap so that we could hike back into Erwin with our lighter packs.
I was amazed to see the sparkling rim ice on all the trees , It reminded me of something out of my wife’s Waterford Crystal collection. If you can enlarge the picture above you should be able to see the ice. 
The day and the hike was beautiful, Spring is indeed beginning to come around and I saw tiny yellow flowers  and certain trees beginning to blossom. It’s such a paradox as there is still snow on the ground from Sunday’s storm. In Florida we do not have the transition of the seasons ,at least not like this and I am blessed  to be right in the middle of it!
We crossed paths with several of our friends that were heading out of town many zero’d in Erwin and we will see them back in town tonight.
Jimmy is amazing, by taking us to these remote starting points we can still benefit from the great rest a hotel bed will provide but still get our daily miles in. Thank you again Jimmy!
Later that evening back in the hotel lobby several of us had gathered in the lobby to share a pizza. When a very nice lady came in and recognized us by name. It turns out she is Blue Grass’ mom and she had come into town to surprise Blue and Sunshine. They are at the shelter right before town and should get to Erwin tomorrow.

Dudley Do-Right, Dynamite, RG, StingRay, Q and I set off to tackle a big mileage day . The great thing is that although I’ll be carrying my regular pack, tent, clothes and sleeping bag I’ll only be carrying enough food for the day. Food is probably the heaviest unknown in my bag, I remember when I first started how careful I was watching the weight of my meals now I just try to stuff my food bag to maximum capacity. 
Unfortunately tomorrow will be the last day Jimmy will be able to help us with slack packing , but my ankle is feeling 99 percent better and I guarantee you it would not have healed as quickly if I was trekking under a full load.  
Jimmy has a cool YouTube site,  once again I don’t have web service to give you the correct web address but if you search Jimmy interviews AT hikers on You Tube
You will find interviews with Q, Sunshine and Blue Grass, Soul Shine , Gopher and many others out here. I posted my interview on a previous journal entry as well.
The mountains were covered in snow but fortunately not too deep.
This has been the coldest spring I’ve experienced but it truly is marvelous . I can’t help thinking of Christmas songs as I hike these snow covered wonderlands.
I wanted to mention that this Tennessee/ North Carolina section of the trail has been beautiful but it’s very confusing to know what state I’m in at any given second. The awol guide and gut hooks neither one identify the state we are in so I’m sorry I can’t be more specific. But both states are equally magnificent!
When we finally marched in from the long day , Jimmy was waiting for us at Hughes Gap and he carried us to a great campsite. But first he took us to the worlds famous Bob’s Dairy Land for the best cheeseburgers and sundaes. The food here is all made from scratch and are most well known for their barbecue .
Today was another great day full of great views , cold early spring weather. Some people say hiking the AT is type 2 fun , meaning it’s hard while you are doing it but fun memories afterwards. I disagree, yes  some parts of the trail can be challenging and as you know the weather can be well brutal at times.
But to me the outdoors and this trail is one of God’s greatest gifts for all us to enjoy and I’m savoring every minute....

Today we are climbing over Roan Mountain again this is on the TN/ NC border. Our goal is to make it to the famous Over-mountain Shelter which has an old barn that has been converted to a shelter. I plan to sleep in my tent on the grass as my sleeping pad is not holding air.
But first we have to ascend 2150 feet in elevation and a total of 12.2 miles. 
Beaker one of favorite past 2017 Thru hikers reminded me that the best breakfast on the entire AT is at Mountain Harbor House B&B/ hiker hostel. I am so looking forward to that! It will probably be Friday morning for that culinary experience. 
But first I had to climb Roan Mountain which was steep and treacherous because the trails were iced over. No problem, I carried micro spikes all the way from Amicalola ... Ummm unfortunately I just sent my spikes home with Snuggs last week argh! Misery likes company and Bear Bait , Q , Soul Shine did not have their spikes either but we all somehow made it up the icy trail without our spikes. 
When we finally got to the top there was a wide open meadow with ruins of an old hotel that was on top of Roan Mountain back in the late 1800s. You can actually come visit this location by car as they open a gated road every Memorial Day. There are restroom facilities available however they were closed today bummer. See the link below for some history on the hotel very interesting !
https://mitchellnchistory.org/...
After exploring the ruins we headed down the trail , an old rock chimney from one of the structures sat almost in the middle of the AT trail .
We proceeded down the mountain and it finally happened. Yeupp everyone says this happens to all hikers but I did not think it would happen to me. Four of us I won’t mention who, were busy talking dodging the ice fields and some how managed to miss a left turn and we wound up all the way down to the base of the mountain but we were not on the AT. 
We pulled out our Gut Hooks electronic map and realized our mistake and had to climb back up the mountain to our turning point ...self abuse I call it.
When we got down to the  Gap, Jimmy was there handing out trail magic and Q, RG, Sting Ray and I got the remainder of our gear and hiked up 8 miles across a beautiful bald towards our destination of the famous Overmountain Shelter.

I had positioned my tent to face east to catch the sunrise from my tent but that would not happen till a little later because our campsite was in a bowl guarded by the high mountains.
I made my coffee, ate my pop tarts and just sat on my pad waiting for something that happens everyday but that I have seldom ever stopped to enjoy. The sun finally came up and it did not disappoint it actually had two linear rainbows right beside it. My northern friends called the spectrum of color -sun dogs.
After breakfast we broke camp and headed up our first mountain, the climb was steep and the air was cool ..perfection.

I enjoyed the climbs today , I realized I climbed two mountains without having to stop and gasp for air , everything I read prior told me my trail legs would come slowly but I really thought I would be good to go in a couple of weeks , man was I wrong these mountains need time to whip you in shape and although I’m not fast my stamina and leg strength has greatly improved . If I look really hard I can actually see a little muscle definition developing in my legs. I’ll need better legs if my goal of averaging 15 miles per day is ever going to happen. We are looking forward to to cranking out bigger miles hopefully in Virginia when the terrain flattens out a-bit. 
BTW I’ve not had any blisters yet so that’s pretty awesome ! I will need to pick up some new shoes soon probably in Damascus.


Today we officially completed another state as we have exited North Carolina. That’s 2 states down 12 more to go!

Shannon and Dave are super people and they send their regards to Beaker (class of 2017) . 
So last night guess what? April showers all night and all day today.
So before I left MH Hostel I called Scotty’s Budget Hostel and Reserved 6 spots. Judge,Q,SoulShine,Pushing Sixty,Boomerang and Bear Bait who already had a reservation plan to crash there to avoid tenting in the rain. They only charge 5.00 per person super great rate.


Q and I left with our heavy packs hopefully with enough provisions to get us to Damascus. The rain was falling steadily but bearable.  I believe I mentioned I’m in this bubble of hikers that are all extremely friendly. It’s like everyone is part of this huge Tramily. They still ask about Snuggs and have adopted him into the fam. So several of the hikers were slack packing from various hostels today, I felt left out as I was packing a full load today. 
No problem as I’m feeling strong this week and my ankle woes are gone for now. 


span class=""Apple-converted-space""> I don’t even have pride anymore since I’ve fallen so much. 


We saw a beautiful waterfall  today it was roaring off the mountain. I’m looking forward to the day it’s warm enough to get in and enjoy those outdoors showers ( fully dressed of course). I also enjoyed walking along a stream that had trout swimming in it , I so wished my brother in law Herb was here with his fly rod to catch me some supper!


I hit 400 miles today Ooh Rah!  It’s a drop in the bucket but 400 miles hiking is pretty cool if I say so myself! 


I reached the hostel around five this afternoon. Q, Soul Shine,and Bear Bait and Judge were already there. Pushing Sixty and Boomerang got there with me and low and behold Coco came marching in later in the evening. The bunk house is rustic but the upstairs “Tree House “ where I stayed was first class! 
Scotty played the piano on his back porch and Q and I went down to visit. He’s a Tennessee Tech Grad engineer and has hiked the PCT and AT .  He’s hiked with Nimblewill and that  makes him ok in my book!

I had a very good nights rest at the Hostel last night. I had a private room  upstairs while the rest of the crew bunked together downstairs. 
I was too tired to feel guilty. I don’t think everyone else like their stay as much as I did. 
I woke up to roosters crowing, wild turkeys gobbling and the hounds of Baskerville howling early this morning.   I forgot to mention we missed the trail coming into this hostel last night, I was hiking with Pushing 60 and Boomerang and had made it down to the bridge at the creek when we realized we had somehow missed the unmarked trail. We backtracked back up the mountain found the trail and made it to the hostel. Well this gave us an advantage leaving this morning as we did not have to climb up the mountain to leave but was able to take a deer trail along the creek back to the bridge. 
 the trail today was a lot of ups and downs some call them puds (pointless downs) i actually like as the give me an opportunity to recover for next ups.
We saw several waterfalls today, this part of Tennessee is absolutely stunning. Our day ended at Laurel Falls a great park where day hikers can come and enjoy the falls and many hiking trails. We saw many hikers and fly fishermen enjoying the great outdoors, many stopped to talk with us and were very interested in our hike. 
 the at winds through some beautiful rock cliffs and up down massive step climbs. the reward is amazing as trail runs by laurel falls alongside creek for challenging hopping base of before spiraling back mountain to shelter. this would be a day hike i highly recommend.

So when we got to the shelter site we realized the tent sites were scarce. So Q, RG, Sting Ray decided we would hike in a bit and stealth camp by the creek. But first we were surprised by an amazing young couple that brought us homemade pumpkin pie, pumpkin bread, mac and cheese and other trail magic items like plastic baggies and TP  they even offered to hike out our trash . These two had southbound last year and decided to do trail magic for us. 
I’m blown away by the good hearts of these strangers helping us hikers out. How can I say this ...There are all different socioeconomic levels out here on the trail some have no extra money and scrape bye with the minimum, others have money but the reality is there are no stores to buy stuff on the trail, we are all socially leveled out here to the most basic hierarchy of needs, and appreciate the smallest gift like a cup of water or a piece of candy old and young, poor and rich  we are all the same and appreciate Trail Angels so very much!!!
My wife and Snuggs’ wife Kenya and our good friend Amy recently did trail magic up on Flagg mountain, in Alabama near her father’s home, feeding several hikers including Nimble Will Nomad. I also hope to be able to give back one day as well but for now I am humbled and grateful for the magic so many provide.

Last night I had A great night’s rest tenting by the stream. My air mattress is now holding air so no sleeping on the hard ground Yay! 
I decided to get up early this morning for a couple of reasons , One the forecast had rain coming in around 8 am and I wanted to be packed up. The main reason was Q and I are walking into town to do a small resupply and hopefully visit a local church .
After a light breakfast, we took a one mile side trail off the AT and hiked into town. Once we got to the main road it was probably only a mile or two into the main part of town from the trail head.
We actually got into town pretty early so we stopped into the Laurel Fork Restaurant for a fine second breakfast. We met a nice lady at the restaurant who invited us to her church right down the road. We still had a good forty five minutes prior to the service so we went into Dollar General and resupplied. Once we got the few items needed we headed to the church . The people at the church were extremely friendly and made us feel like the guests of honor even with our smelly clothes.
We left our packs hanging in the hall way and enjoyed the sermon.
After church Tony Kelly another church visitor offered us a ride back to the trail head!(Thru hikers hate town miles) He actually took us by Mcdonalds first and told us quite a bit of history of the trail and the surrounding area. Turns out Tony is a professional photographer and has a passion for history. Thank you Tony for the trail magic!
Once on the blue trail we had a mile trek to get back to the AT and then the steep ascent began. My full belly and fully loaded pack did not feel great traveling up 1,740 feet in elevation for what seemed an eternity but was only 2.6 miles. 
One cool thing today was that near the top of the mountain we could hear the drone of the Bristol NASCAR race several miles away. 
Great memories, many years ago my dear friend Mike Byrd and I got to attend the Bristol race a couple of times. You literally have to wear hearing protection in the stands it is so loud. But truly that race is an awesome experience.
When we finally got to the top of the mountain we realized the day had had gotten away from us with our late start climbing. The rain was coming soon and we decided to head to Boots off Hostel to weather the storms tonight.

I woke up without a particular plan in mind basically pack up and head north is the SOP (standard operating procedure) A couple of our extended tramily had decided to spend the night here at the hostel as well last night Zipper and Texamo and we all met for milk and cornflakes early this morning. 
Zip and Tex had plans to do a twenty mile day today and even crazier they plan to do a twenty mile day tomorrow to get into Damascus by tomorrow evening. Getting to Damascus is kind of a big deal in the thru hiker world , we start the state of Virginia and leave Tennessee, most of us have to buy new shoes and replace worn out gear, and historically most hikers send their winter gear back home except their puffy jacket, always keep that with you so they say. 


Damascus is where they have the famous trail days every year where vendors and previous hikers all congregate for a week of festivities and great deals on gear. Unfortunately Trail days is still a couple of weeks out . 


Well Q and I pondered their plan of slack packing back to the hostel and decided we would tag along and knockout the two twenty plus days back to back , Easy breezy!...hmmm wellThe terrain today was not particularly tough but it wasn’t easy breezy either and guess what? Yeupp heavy downpours at times. The light packs did made the 20.5 miles very doable and we were back in camp by 6 PM but twenty miles over the mountains is still twenty miles over the mountains if you know what I mean. The great news is that once we get into Virginia we should be able to knock out more 20 mile days as the terrain gets a little easier.
The views were socked in for the most part but we actually got to hike around Lake Watauga and I could see bass fisherman enjoying the water. This made me miss my boat and fishing partner Keith. Man if your reading this please take my boat out and catch one for me!
So tomorrow I will be on the road to Damascus.
I know most of you know the story I’m making reference to, but I’ll attach a link below for the real story about the road to Damascus. It’s one of the coolest stories in the Bible .

Tonight I’m safe and dry in the bunkhouse at Boots Off Hostel. A little sore but geared up to go again in the morning. We will be sharing a cabin in Damascus with about 12 others and I plan to take my second Zero of my trip.","Boots Off Hostel

Halo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610131,"Tuesday Day 51 , TN 91 to Damascus 22.7 miles.


Today our hike began cutting across farmland and crossing several fences. I like it when the terrain is different as it adds to the variety of the adventure. 
We had quite the band of merry travelers today. Doc, Zipper, Texamo,Twenty,Iron man, Loner, Rhythm, Pushing 60, RG, Sting Ray, Q and I . 
Most of us in this group started way back in Georgia close to the same date. I believe it is phenomenal that we have all maintained a similar pace as we sometimes go days without seeing one another. 


Q , Twenty and I got to see a small silent heard of deer about 300 yards from the trail. That was actually my first real wildlife encounter in 400 miles. Maybe we ate starting to get lucky and will see a bear soon. 
On the trail today we had the honor of meeting a fine couple who had hiked the trail in 2002 Bo and Ruby Slippers. It turns out Bo has done the triple crown (The AT ,The PCT and The CDT). They stopped to talk to Ironman,Q and I  for several minutes and congratulated us on our efforts, they were very humble and encouraging!


Later several miles down the trail we met a young man hunting turkey, he was very friendly as well and it’s interesting how hunters and hikers alike use the same Appalachian trail at the same time ,  hopefully no hikers have ever been mistaken for a turkey.


As the day went on we all separated to our respective plans. Several planned to do 10 miles and camp, but Q , Texamo and I planned to knock out another 20 plus miles day. I was beat after about mile 11 and seriously thought my left  ankle was seriously hurt.  Recently my right ankle was hurting me and now I had aggravated my left ankle yesterday. Remember the Nimblewill Nomad rule “ you will hurt everyday, the trick is not to hurt in the same place everyday”
Well that’s a true statement, everyday I experience some sort of discomfort but always in various different locations. However this was day two of the sharp pain. The great news is my goal today is to get to Damascus and take one to two Zeros.
Q and I trudged along and finally we came to the Tennessee Virginia border. Yippee another state down 11 more to go! This crossing was bittersweet as Tennessee is my boyhood home state.
Well I’m looking forward to Virginia, we will have over 500 miles in this glorious state. Get ready for the Shenandoahs , wild ponies , bears  etc. The adventure is about to begin! Tonight I leave you with a John Denver classic “Country Road”


So check out my picture, Q took . It looks like I’m wearing a kilt .","TN 91 crossing

Zero Day in Damascus 

Well this is only for the gear junkies.
I’m kidding of course as I believe anything you can learn from other hikers will hopefully keep you from making the same mistakes or better yet help you succeed. Remember I’m still just a 470 mile newbie myself so sit back and laugh if I go down the wrong path “pun intended “ That being said I sent3 lbsof gear home today.  I sent some of my most favorite gear home that has been there for me getting me thru all the cold nights and blustery snowy days. I sent home my Sea to Summit Thermo reactor liner the orange heavy duty one. This thing is absolutely gold and truly will increase the warmth rating of your sleep system. My opinion only but based on my experience a 19 degree mummy bag with this liner will get you down to 7 degrees. Remember that super cold night right out of Franklin so long ago? It’s a proven fact for me however we all have individual comfort ratings .
Second and equally valuable and loved piece of gear Is my Patagonia R2 black fleece jacket. I hated to send it home but my puffy is so much lighter and will stay with me for the duration. The Patagonia or Pataguchi Line as I lovingly call it is seriously good stuff, hard to justify spending that kind of loot unless you plan to be in the extremes then it’s worth every penny. I also sent my liner gloves, beanie hat, and sleep socks home. All all a bit over 3 pounds according to the post office. I know Spring can be unpredictable and don’t worry I still have my Ice breaker base layer , buff,and my trusted Arcteryx puffy.  I replaced my Altras Lone Peaks 3.5 with brand new shiny 4.0s they are in my favorite trail color black. Actually I’m working on my spring wardrobe and mixing in some color as the Johnny Cash look is getting depressing. 
My final big purchase was a Hyperlite Windrider White back pack. Understand I love my Zpacks Arc Haul Zip but I bought it used and those who have been following since the beginning know I had some issues that I had to rig. The way I see it the first 500 miles was a test and I believe I’ll need this new gear to finish... that’s my story anyhow.

Yesterday Thursday I took another zero. Unfortunately my meds and resupply box did not make it in till Friday morning but I actually benefited from an extra day. It’s interesting how zero days are quite busy with equipment chores, repairs and resupplying but the most important task of all is physical recovery. My muscles and ankles healed up from the rest , today I was able to fly up the mountains with no pains at all.




Today the AT trail ran parallel to the Virginia Creeper trail and also a beautiful stream . The Virginia Creeper trail is a famous rails to trails pathway that people hike and bike. There are at least four bicycle outfitters in Damascus as well as three outstanding hiker outfitters stores . This along with fine trout fishing makes Damascus a great place to visit for the outdoors enthusiasts. I’m attaching a link.
Oh and the restaurants are fantastic in this town. The Damascus Diner , Mojos, Seven Rivers, The Mill were all superb. 
There’s also a very good barbershop and several good churches and other places of interest.
https://www.vacreepertrail.org...


So Friday, We did have a lot of climbing and our bags were heavy from the resupply but we were in great spirits and fully rested.
Q, Timber and I left town a little after 10 am and got to the shelter area around 6:30 PM. There are several of us tented a hammock camping all around the shelter. We are all excited as we will hopefully get to see the Grayson Highlands wild ponies either tomorrow or the next day. We also have  coming up the highest point in Virginia Mount Rogers and the famous Fat man squeeze to go through and last but not least the 500 mile marker is in our grasp.  Exciting stuff!
Btw all my new gear seems to be working fine.

Halo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610387,"Saturday April 13, Day 55, Lost Mountain Shelter to Massie Gap (Grayson Highlands General Store) 15.92 Miles.


Today was a steady climb up to Grayson Highlands, but first we had to summit Mount Rogers Virginia’s tallest point in the State. We had some spectacular views from Buzzard Rock and White Top Mountain . Unfortunately the weather started making a turn for the worst and we still had many miles to hike. The good news is that the rain was steady but not hard. 
The group Q and I have been hiking with is a lot fun and they planned to stop at the Thomas Knob Shelter 12.3 miles out because of the elevation change and the severe weather predictions . Q and I chose to push on a bit ,remember earlier this year our great decision to push thru the wind advisory day on RockyTop and Thunder Mnt ? Actually this time we fell into a great plan we just did not know it at the time. We really just wanted to see wild ponies and then get to the Grayson Highlands General Store grab some food and maybe tent behind the store. This plan would get us close to 16 miles today and we would hit 500 miles for the entire trip. Do you remember the song by the Proclaimers?
“But I would walk 500 miles
And I would walk 500 more
Just to be the man who walks a thousand miles
To fall down at your door”
Catchy tune which of course was in my head today ,  I’m sure it’s got nothing to do with hiking the AT. 


When we got to the Grayson Highlands Area, I was amazed how rocky and treacherous some of the sections were in the rain and fog. I definitely thought I was in the Scottish Highlands and at one point, I thought I could hear bagpipes. Actually I did hear bagpipes, Q had cranked up his eclectic playlist which includes Scottish music and the Last of the Mohicans soundtrack. Perfect music for the perfect setting! 
Where’s my proper Kilt Beaker? 
For those that don’t know , Beaker successfully thru hiked the AT in 2017 and he wore a Kilt the entire time!

There was evidence of ponies all over the trail, we were careful not to step in the evidence as we both are sporting new shoes wet though they are.We heard the ponies neighing in the distant fog but we couldn’t see past 25  feet it was so thick. We actually got into stealth mode hoping to sneak up on a heard . I believe they were actually sneaking around us possibly planning an attack under the guise of the low flying clouds. 
Some how we made it to the end of the park without seeing a single pony only the haunting laughter in the mist.  I don’t think this has ever happened in the history of thru hikers , I’ve heard of not seeing bears on a thru hike but this is impossible. Q and I made the decision to return tomorrow weather permitting and retrace our steps , hey we traveled 500 miles to see these animals,a few extra miles won’t kill us , my wife suggested tying apples around our necks. Well maybe...
We called down to the General Store and the owner Dennis came and picked us up. He ordered us some fantastic hamburgers from his already closed restaurant and offered us a room in his inn over the store for a very reasonable rate. He would also let us use his washers and driers for free. A safe haven from potential severe weather tonight! Also our good friends RG and Stingray are already staying here. It’s a small world on the AT and We have the largest tramily on record I believe!
Tonight I’m safe from the weather and the spooky horses. I hope everyone back home is safe as well.","Lost Mnt Shelter

Massie Gap to Fox Creek 9.8 Miles.


Q and I woke up and headed downstairs to the General Store for Breakfast. The accommodations were excellent as good as any hotel I’ve stayed in. Our plan today is to get back to Grayson Highlands and hike north ten miles ,but the number one objective is to see wild ponies. As you know they were very elusive yesterday. The rain started to fall and the wind picked up as we got closer to our starting place. 
Once again we were in the “Scottish “ Highlands complete with sheets of rain blowing sideways. I pictured the wild ponies comfortably wrapped up in blankets in their secret caves laughing at us as we searched for them in the rain in vain.
We hiked up the mountain on the AT heading north and would cross thru several livestock gates. With each step in elevation I felt our chances of seeing the wild ponies were getting worse and worse. 
As we approached the summit the weather fortunately started to clear , Q was ahead and silently signaled me that he had spotted ponies up the trail. 
I had totally given up on seeing the ponies so I was ecstatic to see them!The ponies are amazing ,these four seemed skittish and we enjoyed them from a distance .

What an awesome day, we did 10 miles not too bad under the weather conditions we were in. Virginia is still mountainous but will hopefully get easier soon . Weather permitting we will hit it again tomorrow.","Massie Gap

>span class=""s1"">Spring can and is producing winter like storms. Unfortunately many of us are no longer carrying all of our winter gear. The good news is the cold snap will only last a day or two!
Actually as the day went on the weather improved tremendously, still unseasonably cold but very nice. The trail took us through cattle pastures today and at one point I sensed I was being followed by a cow. 
Oh I need to tell and warn you about what happened to some of my friends the other night. 
Remember Saturday evening when Q and I left some of our group at Thomas Knob Shelter because we wanted to hike further and see ponies? Well True story in the middle of the night a band of renegade ponies came into their shelter area and tried to eat straps , hiker gear and poor Iron man one horse ate his hammock tarp strap and the rain fly broke and unfortunately the weather got ugly that night and he got wet. 
I did not realize the wild ponies could be mischievous like bears and  raccoons , again it’s peoples fault for feeding them and consequently they lose their fear of humans. Anyway future hikers take heed .


Today we got to see a waterfall cross many creeks and saw several cows up close. I’m safe and sound in my tent , it’s supposed to drop to around 34 degrees which is cold but not freezing. I’m out of the mischievous horse country and the bears leave us alone so it should be a peaceful night.","Fox Creek Gap

Well Virginia is still very mountainous if you ask me, I did not need anyone to rock me to sleep last night. I slept pretty good however my pillow is now not holding air. Funny how equipment falls apart out here. Also the weather was quite cold yesterday but it warmed up tremendously today. 
What an absolute gorgeous spring day, the leaves on the trees are starting to bud , tiny flowers; yellow, white and violet are starting to bloom, birds singing, turkeys gobbling, it’s the absolute best spring ever , I believe I said this before but I feel like I’m part of this transformation somehow. I was in love with winter;the cold nights, beautiful snow , spectacular views ,no bugs, But now I’m ready for the new world that’s more alive, colorful and longer days to play outside. Spring is my new favorite!The hike this morning was a great climb up to Glade Mnt which at 4113 ft rivals many Mountains we have conquered. I was able to get enough reception to call Rhonda and upload yesterday’s journal.



Q took a picture of me wearing a cheap red flannel shirt I had to buy that looks like Snugg’s pajamas. I may have to send it to him for his Snuggles trail collection . You know cotton doesn’t always kill, it actually saved me from a very cold night.


Today at approximately 7 miles in, the trail took us thru The Virginia Pat Jennings Visitors center and later we had to cross VA 16Q. 
Q surprised us all by getting there ahead of us and ordering two Large Pizzas!!! Fantastic amazing trail magic from our very own Q.  Q is one of the most generous amazing gentleman you will ever meet, he helps so many people in so many different ways. His trail name should be “Super Amazing “
Tonight we are stealth camping maybe illegally we don’t know behind a beautiful  1890 farmhouse  complete with barns, sheds, cellars, chicken houses and other structures. Something like the Shire out of the JR Tolkien’s Hobbit .
When we got here we went up to the farmhouse to get permission to camp ,but no one answered. So we went behind one of the barns and decided to set up our tents . I hope we don’t wake up with a shotgun to our noses. We are careful campers and leave no trace. 


Did you guys ever watch Wearwolves of London ? We have a full moon again and the CCR song Bad Moon A Rising keeps playing in my head. Just a random thought.

We quickly struck camp , none of us cooked breakfast because we had plans to eat breakfast at The Barn a famous hiker restaurant that is under new ownership and is now called M&M restaurant approximately 4 miles up the trail.
We started our trek ,hiked up and over a hill and there was an old restored 1800s school building , Timber was standing on the porch eating an apple and let us know there was trail magic inside.

Today we ran across a section hiker that was not feeling well. , it was his second day in and the mountains were seriously kicking his tail. Stingray gave him some electrolytes to add to his water and RG had some anti Nausea medication. I offered low dose aspirin. Hey if you ever get sick on the trail hope 4 old guys show up as we carry enough medication to solve any illness. Q was once again the super hero and slowly hiked down the mountain with this individual thanks also to Ginger wolf he’s a nurse and  hiked with them as well.

I woke up around 5 a.m to a light rain pelting my tent. I would have loved to sleep in another hour or two as it really is relaxing when the rain isn’t pounding down at torrential force, Unfortunately that’s exactly the weather forecast for today severe thunderstorms and possible tornadoes so the plan was to strike camp as quickly as possible and head to the first road secure a shuttle and head into town.


We did exactly that, hiking at a quick pace in the early morning rain.  
We arrived at the road crossing by 9 a.m. Earlier I had contacted Bubba a superb shuttle driver to pick us up and he was there waiting on us. 


Q, RG, Stingray and I checked in the Big Walker Inn right before the sky busted loose with a massive rain storm. Hikers on the mountains were trying to either find shelter or a way into town. I can’t over emphasize how important it is to check the weather forecast daily on the mountains. We all agree forecasts are a gamble and certainly I’ve taken my share of risks, but if at all possible err to the side of caution, this trail is dangerous enough on the best days. 


I checked in with some of our other friends and a few are holed up at Chestnut Knob Shelter which happens to be fully enclosed with a door and glass windows. If you had to pick a shelter to weather a bad storm this is the best of the best that I’m aware of.
”Chestnut Knob is the old fire warden's cabin, which has been converted to an enclosed trail shelter with room for 8 or more hikers.
A clearing in the trees to the north looks down on Burke's Garden, a very fascinating geological formation. The valley to the north, which looks like a giant, 8 mile by 4 mile crater from above, was formed by a limestone sinkhole. The valley has only one natural outlet, in the north, and only two roads leading out of it. The AT to the north walks along the rim of the Garden for the next 8 miles”  (description from my Gut Hooks app). 


Yesterday we had beautiful view of this valley and Bubba the shuttle driver and many locals call the valley God’s Thumbprint.
Unfortunately today everyone gets to see clouds and rain.


Tonight we are safe from all the bad weather and we plan to hike 16 miles tomorrow, we still have a slight chance of rain but we will go back to the road crossing and hike back into town and hopefully catch Easter service Sunday morning.


I wanted to address a question on the guest book regarding advice for a 71 year old hiker. My advice from my perspective is the same for all ages. I would pack as light as possible to minimize stress on the shoulders and joints and most importantly I would keep the mileage way down starting off maybe 4 to 6 miles per day and progressively increase as you get stronger and acclimated to the terrain. Seriously I’m just now able to climb without stopping and gasping for air and hike 15 plus miles per day and I’ve been out here two months.

The terrain was mild compared to what we have been dealing with lately and we covered the distance in record time averaging 3.5 miles per hour. 

The weather was a little rainy but not bad like yesterday. We ran across the Malone family hiking north, the Malones are amazing the mom and dad and four young girls age 5 To 13 are hiking the entire trail. I’ve mentioned them before but I’m so impressed with this young family .

We got back into town and hiked down to Dairy Queen for supper and ice cream. Pushing 60 came off the mountain and joined us for dinner. She weathered the storm in the enclosed shelter last night with several others.


A gear review moment: I purchased new shoes in Damascus Altras 4.0 and Q got the Altras TIMP. Great proven shoes however the toe guard on both styles have already failed and turned loose. We were able to superglue the guards back and seal the edges with silicone.The fix seems to be working but come on Altra ,our shoes should last longer than a week before failing!


That being said and off my chest, I 100 percent recommend these shoes for hiking. Lol another paradox.

Last night I had an amazing dinner;1/2 pound burger combo and a hotdog at Dairy Queen complete with a Caramel Sundae for dessert . I’m down a few pounds so I do try to eat as much as possible when in town.  I excused myself after dinner from Q,RG,Stingray and Pushing 60 and took a stroll into town. Everyone was pretty beat from our force march today but I wanted to explore  town a bit. The town of Bland VA is pretty small,basically you have the Dairy Queen and Subway and that’s it for eating establishments. There is an Italian restaurant that delivers from a nearby location but I could not find it on my walk. 
I was able to find a couple of churches and got their Easter service times , a couple were having sunrise service starting at 6:30 in the morning. I stopped in and resupplied in Grants Grocery Store  a very clean what I presume to be one of the last Mom and Pop type stores in the nation , I just don’t see these little groceries stores anymore especially not in Florida. 
I enjoyed exploring but realized walking miles off trail don’t count and headed back to the inn to retire.


Sunday morning I woke up to a cool 38 degrees but fortunately the sky was clear and would turn out to be a beautiful spring day. Q, Pushing 60 and I walked into town and attended a beautiful church service , the preacher Kevin was super friendly as well as all the members and they all went out of their way to make us feel welcome . After church service the kiddos had an Easter egg hunt on the premises. It was small town USA at its finest! One of the members offered to carry us to the trailhead after we went to Grant’s Grocery store for sandwiches and additional supplies. 
When we got to the trailhead we sat at the picnic table and ate our lunches. We looked up to see Crumb Dumpster formally Texamo and Doc coming down the trail. We shared our sandwiches with them and we had one wonderful Easter banquet with our trail family !


After lunch Q and I headed north on the trail , Pushing Sixty headed south and CD and Doc waited for a shuttle as they were staying tonight at the Inn we just left . Pushing Sixty would catch up with them later at as well. 
RG and Stingray would be waiting on Q and I up the trail. Complicated I know but that’s how we continue to bump into one another in these remote locations.


So tonight we are camped out by a two streams intersection . I would not dare be camped here if rain was in the forecast as I would probably be swept away. The sky is clear and the temps will be in the 30s again.

The thing about Spring time is that the weather can be so perfect it’s hard to want to do anything but relax.
Today was one of those days ,a gorgeous morning with every bird in the forest singing, sound of the streams flowing, it was hard to get going.
None the less we all packed up as we looked forward to stopping at Trents Groceries an outpost famous for their hamburgers and milkshakes about 6 miles down the trail at a road crossing. Funny how we are so motivated by food.
Right before we reached the road crossing we crossed our very first suspension bridge over a large stream. The AWOL guide had the bridge listed and said drinking was discouraged which seemed kind of funny but I totally understood once we all started walking across as it was more thrilling than a ride at Disney.
The cheeseburgers and milkshakes at Trent did not disappoint .The young lady working there was hands down the most customer oriented , friendly person we have met at any establishment on the AT and I would highly recommend anyone to check this place out!
We were soon back on the trail our next stop was the beautiful Dismal Falls. The falls were spectacular and we enjoyed our second lunch on top throwing the occasional stick in watching it go over the falls . Once again the beautiful day, warm sun , sounds of the waterfall made it hard to leave.


We finally got going and certainly the flora and the fauna was flourishing all around, we saw five deer, a four foot King snake, wild flowers,fingerling bass in a mountain pond full of salamanders,it was a beautiful active spring day. 


We finally made it to the shelter area and pitched our tents we met new section hikers , Osso,Lucy and Dragon and We met a new thru hiker Hawk Bait and she shared news on our tramily behind us as she had been with Sunshine, Bluegrass,Peach,Gopher and Papa Bear a few days before. It’s so cool the way news travels up and down the trail, I envision this to be the way it was back in the olden days. 
Another old friend Young Gun showed up I had not seen him since Hot Springs. 
That night before we all retired to our tents we discussed how two hikers were murdered here at this shelter in 1981.

15.4 miles.


We all survived the night without incident , it was a short night as we stayed up late hoping to see the meteor shower. 
Although we didn’t see any meteors the stars were beautiful.  It’s amazing to see stars without the light pollution from the city. 
The climbs today were tough, long and rocky but we were rewarded with some beautiful views. I absolutely love it when the skies are clear and I can see for miles. So often I’ve been robbed of views with bad weather. Ultimately the mountains give us what they want.
At one point we hiked through what appeared to be a dead forest. RG believes the trees could possibly have suffered from the ashborer beetle. We are going to try and find out for sure, but what a shame to see so many magnificent trees dead.
After a day of climbing and descending and climbing again we finally got to our destination. I mean the day was tough but I liked it because I was feeling strong. 
We camped near a spring right before Angel’s Rest which is a cliff formation with a spectacular view of the town of Pearisburg VA.


Tomorrow we will have a short hike into town as Stingray and RG have shoes and other items that have been sent to the Pearisburg Post Office. We will decide if we we will spend the night or move on.

Stingray, RG, Q and I arose early and headed down the mountain into town. We did stop briefly at Angel’s Rest to enjoy the morning sunrise but nobody wanted to risk the climb up the iconic Angel’s Rest boulder , too sketchy this early in the morning plus we had breakfast waiting for us in town.


We spent the rest of the day resupplying and handling business back home. All of us on the trail greatly appreciate our support system back home, I know I could not be here following my dreams without the support of my lovely wife. Thank you sweetie!
The day in town went by swiftly and I still have some unfinished business that I need to tend to at the local library . We decided to extend our stay and arranged a shuttle to slack pack us and get in a couple of 20 miles days.

Bliss and pain,ups and downs, dry and wet. Today was a day of extreme opposites, the only constant were rocks on the trail and the birth of beautiful spring foliage,
But contrasting still are pockets of forest with nothing but dead fallen limbs and trees that appear dead. 


Our day began early as we hiked to the trail head at the end of town. We walked a couple of extra town miles which of course do not count. It’s been said thru hikers don’t like walking town miles , indeed I agree however I need to be more bold and ask strangers for a ride when needed.


Once again I felt strong hiking and was not feeling any pain when bam my head hit a limb with such force that the sound sounded like a good base hit in baseball. Yes this will leave a mark and a bump at least the bleeding was minimal. Here is the problem, the trail has tons of pointy rocks which are difficult to navigate through and requires laser focus. Unfortunately I was wearing a billed ball cap which in turn blocks my vision ,well you get the picture. After the pain subsided I turned the cap around “catcher” style and no more vision problems......so I thought , Stingray and I picked up some steam to catch up with Q and RG who were now a good bit ahead and had not witnessed my “base hit”. I was in the lead when I heard Stingray gasp and point to one of the largest king snakes I had almost stepped on , I mean how in the world did I not see this thing! We stopped to watch this beautiful snake slowly slither into a hole under a tree, this is a great snake that eats poisonous snakes as well as rats. 
Now we were probably 15 minutes behind and Stingray and I cranked up the speed again to catch up, once again I decided to take the lead and I was gracefully navigating ,effortlessly gliding over jagged rocks like I was a gazelle....maybe Stingray will give me a cool new trail name to match my superhuman abilities?
That’s when it happened I tripped and started to crash hard onto the jagged rocks,on the way down I tried to find a soft landing but unfortunately rocks and more rocks was my only choice. I laid there in pain and again poor Stingray thought I was seriously hurt but after a quick examination only minor cuts and bruises , tribal markings as Q would call it.
Well this is all part of it ,we all fall out here and yes I need to be more careful. But even with these minor setbacks we were able to click off twenty miles.  We had a beautiful weather day today except for the last 15 minutes the sky opened up with buckets of rain to soak us.

Our back packs were extra heavy with four solid days worth of food packed. This upcoming section will be exciting as we will reach Dragons Tooth and Mcafee Knob two important landmarks on the trail.
We had some very hard climbs the rocks on the trail are extreme in Virginia. I’m extra cautious after my spill the other day.
I forgot to mention, Friday on our zero day Q, RG,Stingray, P60 and I got a shuttle and went to the famous Home Place restaurant in Catawba which is only open Friday , Saturday and Sunday. They specialize in great southern cooking and they keep serving you until you are full.
That was some of the best fried chicken I’ve ever had!
We got to see some of our friends that are a day or two ahead of us;Rooster, Old School, Judge, Scooch, Star Lord, Boomer, Storm Trooper and Timber. I’ve said it before but it’s always great to catch up to old trail friends and it’s always part of the fun not knowing who you may run into.
The trail is “thinning out “as many have dropped out for various reasons .
Today we had two majestic views
WindRock and Kelley’s Knob the day started off very cold but warmed up nicely as it progressed.


Tonight we are tenting near Laurel Creek Shelter ,we met a nice young man named Lounge Lizard already set up to sleep but he joined us for dinner. Q, Stingray  RG and I all gave the young man some of our bounty and he was very appreciative.

This morning’s hike took us through some beautiful farmlands. It’s pretty amazing how the AT conservatory and the landowners have worked to develop a land trust to allow hikers passage through their fields.
The trail led to a road and I saw a small church in the distance. I hollered at RG who was a bit ahead and let him know I was going to head down and check it out , Q and Stingray were already way ahead.

The church was very welcoming and I got to meet many nice members. One of the very best part of my adventure is meeting local town people and churches have been a great venue . They never seem to mind that I’m dirty ,smelly and wearing hiking clothes but have always made me feel like a guest of honor. After church I enjoyed talking with some of the old timers and met some of the Keffer family who own the land with the Keffer Oak the largest and oldest oak tree on the AT. 
Well I said my goodbyes to my new friends and took off up the trail , I was now a good 3 hours behind Q,RG and Sting Ray but no worries as I knew where we were camping this evening.
When I got to the Keffer Oak, I stopped to eat lunch and admire this magnificent tree. It’s over 18’ around and over 300 years old. 
I stayed longer than I should and was tempted to take a nap but I pushed on instead.
I had a super steep climb up to Bruisers Knob where I enjoyed a wonderful view of the valley. I ran into Lounge Lizard who had been picking ramps and he shared one with me. Ramps are similar to wild onions but have a sweet taste. After my organic snack, I left him and continued my hike to Sinking Creek Mountain and there I had to traverse the Ledges ,very steep rock face at 45 degrees or greater which slopes down the edge of the mountain. Super scary and exhilarating does not begin to describe this portion of the trail. 
After about 40 minutes of traversing the Ledges I got to a sign announcing the Eastern Continental Divide .
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wik...
I’ve attached a link above , all I can remember about the Divide from school was that the water from the eastern side of the divide flows to the Atlantic and from the western side the water flows to the Gulf of Mexico. 
I finally started making it down the mountain and stopped at a stream to filter water as I was completely out. I met two fine men from Indiana that were section hiking southbound to Pearisburg. I warned them about the upcoming  Ledges but they were both experienced hikers heading to the next shelter. 
I finally got hiking again and caught up with my crew just minutes before night fall. I enjoyed my solo adventure today but I’m sure glad to be back with my friends.","Laurel Creek Shelter area

We looked forward to hiking to Dragons Tooth a popular day trip for locals, climbing the stone allows for tremendous views.
But first we were going to take a short side trail to visit the Audie Murphy Memorial. He was America’s most highly decorated World War II veteran and he died in a plane crash close to the memorial site. We were all touched by the gifts people have left at his memorial in his honor it was an emotional experience and we all left something as well . Truly he was a great hero. 
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wik...
While were at the memorial, I received a text from Jerry Anderson “Coach” offering to pick us and take us back to his home in nearby Salem Virginia later on this evening. YES!!! Coach is an avid hiker and outdoorsman who we know through mutual friends. He had helped my friend Snuggs with gear advice etc before he came out to the trail back in March. 
After the great unexpected trail magic news ,we continued our hike toward the Dragon. When we stopped for lunch before the climb  we found more trail magic as someone had left soft drinks and water at the base of the mountain in  a stream. What a fabulous day this had become!
 On our way up we hit the 700 milestone Ooh Rah! The miles seem to be clicking away faster.
Dragons Tooth was awesome as expected, what we did not fully anticipate was the degree of difficulty descending the mountain. We had to use embedded rebar virtually hand over hand climbing. 
Super fun actually!
Coach was waiting at the bottom and took us to a great local restaurant. He and his wife Kay have a beautiful home and are magnanimous hosts. Coach will take us back to the trail in the morning and hike with us part of the day.

I want to point out that the temperature is rising and the hiking is getting tougher. I heard of four hikers quitting for various reasons but I believe the heat has a lot to do with it. Our crew is now getting up an hour earlier to beat the upcoming summer heat.

Waking up one hour earlier gave us a nice edge against the heat, the problem of course is I have a hard time getting to sleep earlier so I lost an hours rest...
 The night was actually warm and my 19 degree mummy bag is quite warm.I plan on picking up a summer weight quilt when we get to town.
Our first stop this morning was the Tinker Cliffs. The views were spectacular , one great advantage of a bright sunny day .  
Hydrate, hydrate,hydrate is the key to surviving these warm days , I use powdered Pedialyte when I can find it , if not the powdered propel additive. We lose so much salt when we perspire it’s critical to replenish the electrolytes . My good friend Haymitch had to take off a couple of days due to dehydration. 
Despite the heat we all had a great time hiking today, when we got to Haystack Rock ,Q skillfully scrambled up to the peak RG followed suit and climbed up as well. I decided I would climb this monolith and boy was it technical and scary. Q made it look so easy, I believe he’s part mountain goat. I made it almost to the top and decided to head back down and that’s when the fear factor began.The foot and hand holds I used going up did not seem as safe going down , well eventually slowly but surely I ungracefully scrambled down and managed to make it back to earth in one piece.

We all got back on trail and headed into the town of Daleville  where I resupplied and I got the new summer quilt I mentioned earlier.

The morning started out beautiful and quickly got up into the 80s in the heat of the day. Many of the Rhododendrons are starting to bloom and they are amazingly beautiful. In a blink of an eye the forests are full of foliage and the green leaves are providing a great canopy to protect us from the sun. I’m beginning to understand why they call the AT the Green Tunnel.
We stopped at a pool below a gentle stream to eat lunch. There we saw a handsome water snake, tons of minnows and several crawdads Q discovered that they like to eat Cheezits and we created a mass feeding frenzy for all the creek critters. 
Later in the day we got caught in a strong thunderstorm which actually helped cool things off. The rain brought out unusual very bright orange salamanders all along the trail, I have seen pictures of these but never one in person.

We hiked in the rain off and on throughout the day but really it was the humidity and the fog that was the most challenging. 
Well not exactly true we had to cross the infamous challenging Three Ridges which indeed is probably the hardest climbing/hiking day we have had so far. Virginia is tough but so very beautiful, my favorite state to hike in so far.
Our goal today was to make it to Devils Backbone basecamp brewery and restaurant. They allow thru-hikers to camp, use their bathhouse all for free, they also served us a wonderful breakfast for only five dollars. The restaurant is fabulous at this place and I highly recommend their baby ribs that they smoke on properly, delicious!
Q tripped and fell very hard today and busted his shin. He’s super tough,no tears but said he might let a doctor check him out. We met Sarah ( Cushy Life) from Sarah Hikes You tube channel at the campground .She’s thru hiking as well but is taking some time off to heal an injury and she offered to take Q to the doctor and have him X-ray’d. She is so wonderful to help and truly is an Angel. Check her out on her station she’s very informative and actually helped me prepare for my hike many months ago.


A couple of random hiker tips I want to share. Two came from RG which I’m not sure if I told you stands for Roaming Geezer. He and Stingray are both retired law enforcement from Alabama and with Q are three of the finest men you could ever meet. 
When you back flush your filter tap it hard on the sides and flush it again, You will be amazed at how much dirt stays lodged in unless you do.When filtering water always pour at a 45 degree angle to keep unfiltered water that may leak from around the bladder into your clean filtered water.


Simple tips that thankfully I picked up from RG and hopefully you can use as well to prevent sickness on the trail. 
And the last tip that I just learned from a young hiker is to bring powdered milk to make nice cold cereal on the trail . Why did it take me over 800 miles to learn about this culinary miracle?

But first we had to make it over Humpback mountain in one piece. Sure enough as I was rock hopping along ,my feet slipped out from under me and I sat down forcefully on a not so smooth rock. Fortunately no one was around to see a tear of pain as I evaluated the damage . My tailbone hurt, I was mad at myself and mad at the stupid rock but other than a slight cut on my hand I was good to hike on. Shortly after that incident I caught up with the guys and they were talking with a section hiker “Duke” a Marine and former Thru hiker OohRah.He surprised us with donuts and offered to give us a ride into town once we got to the gap.

Altras are unique to most shoes and have four points of connection for their specially made gaiters. Come on Altra you are better than this!!! I caution everyone considering Altras and you know I absolutely loved my Altras 3.5 but the 4.0 and now the 1.5 Timps have serious quality control issues in my personal use and opinion. I’m not alone ,Sunday Another hiker was complaining about the 4.0s he had bought in Damascus to the owner of the Waynesboro outfitter . The owner said the shoes were not originally designed to be used as a thru hiker shoe but as a trail runner. I agree with that statement, however they are stocking and selling these shoes everyday to thru hikers .... I just don’t know , it is indeed a great trail shoe just not very durable so buy at your own risk. If anyone out there in the hiker community has a better recommendation please let me know. I’ve heard Brooks Cascadia are nice but no one seems to carry them out here. 
Thank you for the recommendation on my Guest book page , you are correct I have not seen the Altra Olympus, a few hikers are using the Hokas and seem to love them. I should plan ahead and order online , I just like to try shoes on and kick the wall and stuff.
Tomorrow we will hit our first wayside in the Shenandoah Park.
I’m not exactly sure what a wayside is but they sell blueberry milkshakes and hamburgers!!
Tonight we are all hunkered down in our tents the wind is howling and temperature is dropping.  8 minutes till hiker midnight ( 8:00 pm) we are safe and happy to be here!Ps; So great to hear from all of you, I appreciate you signing my guest book it raises my spirits at the end of each day!","Calf Mountain Shelter Shenandoah SNP

What a great day we had today.The Shenandoah National Park is wonderful. This morning when I went to retrieve my food bag I was greeted by a deer grazing 10 yards away and she didn’t seem to mind us camping in her back yard. Q was able to sneak up and get several close up pictures. When we started up the trail RG was able to see the tail end of a bear as he ran away into the woods. The rest of us did not get to see him but Q saw the bushes move which unfortunately does not count as a siting.
I discovered what a wayside is today , it’s a cool little souvenir and resupply store on one side and a nice little restaurant on the other. Coach surprised us and bought us all breakfast , unbelievable thank you Coach!!! Usually they serve blackberry milkshakes but the machine was broken however they did serve blackberry ice cream which was fantastic. 
Later on in the day we hit 900 miles Ooh Rah! But the coolest thing that happened today , I got to see my first bear  see the pic and I also have a video. The bear was pretty big and was not aggressive at all. I was alone up a hill so the rest of the fellas did not get to see him. 
We are all camped in the woods around the shelter and the weather is a lot warmer than last night. I actually slept very well last night even though it dipped in the high 30s.  We are safe and sound in the comforts of our tents.","Stealth Site

Unfortunately Coach had to leave us today , he is such a great addition to our crew, a Virginia mountain goat tough as nails!
After Coach left we sat at a picnic table near one of the entrances to the park and a very nice ranger lady brought us a bag of blueberry donuts. That was such an amazing unexpected treat! 
Our destination today was Lewis Mountain Campsite which has showers and a Camp Store for resupplies. On the way I ran into two extremely friendly deer , the animals here at the park are so chilled.The trees however are not, I was hiking up the trail when a huge limb came crashing down about 10 feet away from me. I was very fortunate to not have been hit.

I was the first one to leave camp this morning. I tried to hike as quietly as I could in hopes to see another bear. I saw a rabbit, woodpecker and two deer but no bears.

We had a super lazy Saturday morning enjoying the resort property and finally hit the trail around 11 am. The SNP is quite busy on the weekend and we saw tons of day hikers all over the trail. When we got to Mary’s Rock a beautiful rock overlook it was covered up with little boys perched precariously on every nook and cranny of the cliffs. I would have been a nervous wreck if I were in charge of those young-uns. Turns out they are part of a church based organization called Trail Life ,fantastic to see the little fellas enjoying the great outdoors! We made a short afternoon of it and camped at the Pass Mountain Hut area. We are actually way down the hill from the shelter as most of the tent sites were taken by a Boy Scout troop. Great weekend for families and kids. The SNP is wonderful ,similar to the Smokies but more old school not so commercialized if that makes sense?

Ok I know I said the Smokies is a bit more commercialized than the Shenandoah NP but really that only refers to Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge. The backcountry in the Smokies is more remote. In the SNP the trails are very close to the famous Skyline Drive parkway and very accessible to the public. We saw lots of day hikers in the “back country” today. Again It was great to see so many enjoying the great outdoors. 
RG, Stingray,Q and I are now known as the FreeRange Crew. I guess because we roam freely outdoors? Like a bunch of chickens I suppose...
So today we roamed 13 miles in the backcountry and indeed we took our time stopping to climb rocks and enjoy the views. We stopped in at the Elkwallow Wayside and ordered cheeseburgers and blackberry milkshakes these shakes are to die for! You can’t get milkshakes in the Smokies backcountry I assure you.

They had sent an apple  for coach so Q said I could have his as well. Thank you so very much Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, I can tell you we all appreciate the edible treasures you sent us!!!
The day was especially beautiful today around 70 degrees, we had several steady climbs but the elevation was manageable. No bears today we are actually out of the Shenandoah NP however still bear country. Our first stop of the day was at the Jim and Molly Denton Shelter for lunch. This shelter is by far the nicest I’ve seen on the trail. It has an extended deck with comfortable wooden chairs , a separate covered picnic area, a spring fed shower and a horseshoe pit! It was a great place to hang out but we still had around 10 miles more to go. When we finally got to our target shelter we met up with our dear friend Pushing 60, it was great to see her again as she is getting off for good at Harpers Ferry and we didn’t know if we would have a chance to see her again.

RG was the first to catch me , he’s super fast his pace is like a torturous speed walk but he likes it. I’m not coordinated enough to walk that fast as I’m stumping my toe on every third rock as it is. When everyone got to the rock overlook I had stopped at,we decided to venture off trail and check out the Bears Den Hostel which sits right on top of the mountain. The building was built in 1933 out of stone and looks like a medieval castle. http://www.bearsdencenter.org/
This is where P60 and the wandering women crashed last night. The building was very historic but most importantly sold soft drinks and snacks. P60 was still there when we got there and hiked out with us she was not traveling as far as us today and would get off at the David Lesser Memorial shelter. The hike was strenuous but lightened up considerably after we exited the Roller Coaster. However we got caught in a wicked thunderstorm, thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening. I chose not to don on my rain-gear as I was already sweat soaked and the cool water actually felt great. The rain was intense but did not last that long .Another milestone we officially crossed into West Virginia today Another state down Ooh Rah.

Her home connects to the trail and we were soon on our way to Harpers Ferry. The trail was relatively easy but rocky thank goodness we left our heavy items at the hostel as Patsy was going to pick us up this evening and bring us back for another comfortable evening. When we got to the AT center at Harpers Ferry we were blown away, my friends from back home at our LakePointe community had coordinated with Rhonda, Jimmy and “Trail-boss” a wonderful welcome. First there was a custom made yard sign welcoming us as we approached the building , Trail-boss , Tower and Katie were out front to welcome us and made us feel so special. Inside the celebration continued as inside we were presented a HUGE cake and four bags of trail magic goodies. WOW we were so blown away. 
Thank you , Thank you, Thank you for all that were involved and contributed to the most amazing surprise welcome ever!!!

We hung out at the AT welcome center like rock star celebrities sharing our cake and goodies with all of our friends. One young hiker that we had recently camped with “Stretchman” wants to be part of crew lol. The cake was a very tasty red velvet and one hiker named “Cake”gave his appropriate approval . Balloons and everything,
Great surprise party for all!
We later walked the historic town enjoying the architecture and greeting other hikers and tourists alike.  Harpers Ferry has a great outfitters and they had the old original Altras Lone peak 3.5 deeply discounted and the blue Superfeet insoles which no one has carried thus far.,Score!! I sent my relatively new Altra Temps back home and I’ll definitely use them but I’m more comfortable on the trails with the 3.5s and your feet are so important out here you know.

Stingray was completely missing one tip and one of mine was worn down almost flat. Q hardly uses his poles at all he is so nimble and  RG’s tips seemed fine as well. I also picked up some new gaiters and replaced my seat pad that came up missing. 
After our gear resupply we stopped in a little restaurant and had some fantastic gyros and salads. Our early morning start had vanished into thin air but who cares! We saw the wonder women and we saw our long lost friend Timber who was way ahead but had taken off for a few days . So cool to have friends all up and down the trail.  
We crossed the Potomac River on a footbridge that is adjacent to the railroad bridge that runs thru the mountain. As soon as you cross over the River  you are in Maryland, what is that my 6th state? Funny we could not find a welcome sign.

I love a plan, but what I really love is spontaneity,actually more of a willingness to adapt and kick the old plan to the curb. One of the many advantages of hiking with a trusted group is sometimes individually our plans are not in sync even though our ultimate goal is the same. 
My initial plan was to hike 15 miles over tough terrain today and be set up to enter Caledonia State park Wednesday morning. Stingray had a better plan and suggested going into town resupplying and getting a hotel room. The weather forecast for the day was ominous with potential thunderstorms with hail likely.  Hey I’ve turned into a “safety first guy “for the second half of this journey, we’ve come too far to get hurt now( more on that in a bit).
So in town we are! We are in Waynesboro PA in a nice hotel right next to Walmart and Applebee’s.
I’ve seen a lot of injuries and I myself picked up a knee brace today to help with a slight tweak of my knee from the other day at the roller coaster. This slight injury actually comes at a good time as I’m getting off the trail for four days. 
My niece in Chattanooga has honored me by asking me to perform her wedding this coming weekend. I committed to this special event long before I started the trail and warned my niece I might look like a hermit, but she was not to be deterred. So I’m super excited to head to my boyhood hometown and especially excited to see my wife who I’ve not seen in 100 days!
What about the Free Range Crew you ask? I told them I don’t like them any more and that they smell bad and that I’m moving on with my life without them. I used the same exact lines I’ve heard many times before from my old ex girlfriends. Well these guys won’t listen and they plan to slow down and believe I’ll be able to catch up with them way before Katahdin. I really don’t want to negatively affect their hike and between us I didn’t really mean anything I told them other than the part that they smell bad,they really do but so do I. 
Well tomorrow my shuttle driver “Trail Boss” will pick me up here at the hotel and bring me back to his home in Harpers Ferry and then Thursday  will take me to D.C. to catch a plane home.

He had guests at his B&B so he took me to the TeaHorse Hostel which was nice and only five of us had the whole place to ourselves. This morning Trail Boss drove me to the trail head I had gotten off at last week and I proceeded to make some miles.
But let me back up and say that Trail Boss is awesome and is a wealth of knowledge about the AT and other historical facts about the area. It should be a requirement to spend some time with him on your thru hike truly a must do.  
I felt pretty strong after five days off the trail however my body felt shocked we were back at it .

Last night was surprisingly cold it dipped down in the low 40s. I zipped up my summer bag and put on my puffy and slept fairly well. I forgot to mention that I had to set up my tent on a wooden platform last night. Apparently platforms are a thing here in the parks. My tent is not freestanding and requires my trekking poles well you can imagine it was a tricky situation but I managed to get it up and happy to report no incidents. So I had a pretty eventful day today, I hit the official halfway mile marker today, and 1100 miles OohRah! I’ve always considered myself to be an optimist and truly I believe I am. BUT... now the glass seems half empty, Don’t get me wrong I know these northern states are going to be awesome and no way would I want to start over (too hard and too long) but man what a grand adventure thus far. I guess I miss my southern states...
So I’m hiking along by myself in a very bushy area of the AT and seemingly out of nowhere maybe everywhere a rattle snake(s)starts rattling. Since no one was there to witness this ambush, I’ll tell you I bravely kept on walking. I did not jump 4 feet into the air and scream like a scairdy cat. Nope no one saw or heard anything at all . The good thing is it was a friendly warning and no bites. Later on I ran into a section hiker and I told him I was heading to Pine Grove Furnace General Store and was going to grab one of their famous burgers. He told me he thought they closed the store at 4 or 5 and it was 2 pm with 6 miles left to go so I hightailed it up and down to the store. As I was approaching the store I was surprised to see Sunshine there waiting for me with a special sign made out of pebbles, I was blown away not really expecting to see anyone I know this late in the evening, especially Sunshine my original tramily member! 
Well what a great reunion and on top of that Memorial Day started later hours for the General store and they now are open til 7pm . 
Traditionally hikers eat a half gallon of ice cream to commemorate/celebrate the halfway point. I ate my pint and I trust the rest of the Free Rangers ate their pints as well.
Teamwork! I enjoyed eating and talking with several other hikers and campers on the front porch of the store and finally headed out around 7pm with 3 miles left to hike.

“One is the loneliest number that you will ever do”...I hiked alone today again , but it’s truly not that bad,  I find that I’m hiking faster than I normally do and I’m meeting new people along the way. Last night I was so tired after eating the burger and ice cream it was great finding a stealth site that wasn’t in my guide book as I was running out of daylight and steam.  Camping out in the woods by yourself can be a little strange the first time or two , but you get used to the night/animal noises eventually .
My first goal today was approximately 7 miles down the trail  to Greenbriers General Store and Deli . I love it when I can take a side trail to a remote store in the middle of nowhere . I ate a fabulous steak sandwich,chips ,two cokes and a gatorade. For some reason I couldn’t do an ice cream for dessert. I guess all this town food is throwing off my hiker hunger. I ran into two hikers from Sebring Fl, Eagle Eye and Milky Way ,they are hiking with their dog Baxter. We all enjoyed the break at the General Store. 
When I finally left the store I was welcomed by a huge climb up to the Rock Mazes. I actually enjoyed all the scrambling over the big rocks a natural obstacle course built by God, amazing!
After the maze I descended into a beautiful cornfield that went on for miles and miles. I was a hot sweaty mess from the climb and the descent of the mountain,the cool breeze coming across the fields was exhilarating. Every now and then I would go by a farmhouse and I wondered what they were cooking for dinner, maybe they would glance out their window and take pity on me and invite me in? Unfortunately not today. The AT continued to cross the farmland eventually ending in the town of Boiling Springs PA.  I found the AT center but it was closed. There was a number on the door for a nearby hostel so I decided to call , a shower would be awesome. 
Lisa the hostel owner came and picked me up and I met up with Fumbles, Robbie, and Poncho who were already chilling out enjoying their freshly bathed state and clean clothes .... luxury on the trail. 
Tomorrow I may do over twenty miles as the terrain looks relatively flat for the first section,we will see.

This morning I had a bit of a late start, Lisa brought us into town and Fumbles, Cecil and I had a fantastic breakfast at Cafe 101. Eagle Eye , Milky Way and their dog Baxter also had an outdoor table as well. At the restaurant I met a nice couple from England that are thru hiking, Morph and his wife  I believe her name is Wobble .After breakfast we all separated to resupply and decided we would see each other this evening at the Cove Mountain Shelter approximately 21 miles away.
I fooled around town way too long , I checked out the Boiling Springs and spent too much time in the Fly shop. They rent canoes and kayaks and I almost went for a little fishing trip. I finally got going on the trail close to 11 am. This was going to be a very long day if I was going to hit my goal. I crossed several pastures and a railroad track, I’ve lost count but I’ve traversed at least a half dozen RR tracks on this entire journey just a fun fact. 
As I was trekking along I saw a hand written note to me on a tree saying that Fumbles, Robbie, Eagle Eye and the rest decided to stop short at the next shelter. I stopped in ate dinner with the gang and moved on as I had miles to go before I sleep. 
Well at 8 pm the vampire mosquitos started attacking . I came across a stealth site and decided to set up camp. 18 miles was short of my goal but it would have to do.
Shortly after I started to set up I was joined by the couple from England Morph and Wobble. 
We all sat around as they ate discussing the highlights of the day.
Tonight we are all camped out by a creek in the middle of the forest, very cool!","Boiling Springs

There’s this scene in the Tom Hanks Castaway movie where he’s fumbling trying to catch a fish for dinner and then the scene fast forwards three or four years later to a much leaner and now highly skilled at spearing fish Tom Hanks.



I had a Castaway moment last night when I skillfully threw my bear bag line 20 feet into the air and was able to catch the limb on the very first try. I know it doesn’t sound as impressive as spearing a fish from 20 feet, but you should have seen my attempts when I first got out here back in February. As matter of fact what used to take me a while to do such as setting up and striking my tent , cooking etc is now second nature. I’m not sure what I’ll do with my new skill set when I get back to civilization, maybe I’ll make another movie. 
This morning I left camp shortly after the English couple. I caught them later on top of cove mountain. From that vantage point we could see the town of Duncannon, my next destination.

The climb down was a little rocky and steep but not terribly technical.

My first stop in town was a gas station where I bought two bottles of Body Armor drink and some chips. Rhonda recently introduced me to this power drink and it does seem to have better ingredients. 
The next stop was the famous Historical Doyle Hotel originally built in the 1700s , the cheese burger was phenomenal and Vicky was super friendly and helpful.

A couple of my friends stayed there the night before and they said the rooms were rustic but great.

The AT winds around the town of Duncannon and Vicky told me the side streets to take to get to the post office and the ice cream shop.
The post office is a must stop for hikers as they have a tremendous hiker box full of great food items and new socks. The ice cream shop is definitely a requirement!
I hiked out of town and decided I would hike 13 miles to the second shelter. I finally got there around 8 pm a little tired but proud of my day.

Halo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615924,"Day 111,  18 miles to Rauch shelter area.
Last night was the first night I had slept in a shelter since the winter. Shelters are great specifically in cold wet weather. This shelter was a great one with two stories and I had the whole upstairs loft to myself.  When I woke up I was surprised to see Rhythm and Ironman at the shelter, if you recall I’ve been hiking around these guys since Georgia and I had last seen Rhythm recently at Harpers Ferry right before the Wedding.
I was the first one to hit the trail at around 6:30 am , I hadn’t walked very far when I saw a porcupine walking along the trail. I tried not to startle him but he did finally raise his quills at me and slowly moved away. Then shortly afterwards I saw a rabbit sitting on the trail and he would hop away a few feet but stayed on the trail for a good long way always looking back thinking he had given me the slip. Pretty funny ,this early rise thing was quite entertaining. 
Later that morning I ran into Dan a section hiker from the area and we hiked together till lunchtime as he was doing an out and back hike.
Dan had great info on the State and I enjoyed his company a lot. After lunch he hooked me up with Snickers,Spam and Peanut-butter and he took my trash , amazing trail magic on the trail!!!The day got warmer and I started to get a little tired after a three mile climb up a ridge. As I was walking I came up on three deer hanging out on the trail. What’s going on today? These animal sitings are fantastic but rare. 
As I was filming the deer Nibbles and Radar showed up ,I recently met this couple in Duncannon.
We hiked the rest of the way into camp. They actually camped by the creek and I went up towards the shelter area looking for Rhythm and Ironman. 
I checked out the shelter but there was no one around, so I camped on top of a hill with Bucket List , Black Forest, Rosy and Chipper and a trail runner named Grandpa. Bucket list built a fire as he did the night before and we all sat around it eating our dinners and telling trail stories.

Halo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615997,"Day 112, 17.5 miles to the 501 shelter .
In any workout program I’ve been involved with you normally alternate muscle groups or in running at least vary the intensity and mileage and always you incorporate rest for the muscles to recover.....it’s a tough grind out here day in and day out , the recovery/rest is sporadic and good nutrition is hard to come by. I’m not complaining just being Captain Obvious. 
This morning I woke up and just stared at my backpack and my backpack stared back.Neither one of us wanted to get moving. The morning air was nice and cool and I wanted to just lay there in my bag.

However I needed to make miles and the very first section of trail was a flooded beaver swamp and I knew the going would be extremely slow, cold and wet. Chipper and Rosy left about the same time I did and we got to the swamp edge together. I decided to switch out of my hiking socks and shoes and wear my crocks. Chipper did the same but Rosy chose to wear her hiking shoes. The crossing was as expected cold and wet and the mud kept wanting to pull off my crocks but other than that I quite enjoyed the traverse, hey no gators to worry about up here in these parts. 
Today the trail varied from swampland to very steep climbing and treacherous rock fields crossings. My understanding is the really aggressive rock fields in PA are yet to come, swell....
I finally made it to a road crossing , soaking in sweat and beat up,I was just wishing someone would be offering trail magic and I looked up and saw Sunshine waiting for me with apples, soft drinks and honeybuns . It was so cool to catch up with her while we had our own private trail magic picnic it was fantastic!!! My spirits were lifted and as I was leaving and saying my farewells, a lady from across the parking lot offered me more chips and soft drinks and I politely said yes please! Now I had three or four soft drinks and plenty of snacks in me,fueled up ready to make a very steep climb. I felt great and made it to the 501 shelter approximately five hours later.
A few of the hikers had already arrived and I was again surprised to see Sunshine and now with Bluegrass there to surprise me again. I failed to mention that unfortunately Sunshines planter fasciitis has kicked back up and she can’t hike right now but is supporting Blue and other hikers with slack packing opportunities,trail magic etc!!
This shelter is more like a hostel and is fully enclosed and near a road so we were able to order pizzas for everyone. What a fantastic ending to a challenging day . 
Tomorrow will be another tough miles day and the weather is forecasted to be rainy but It’s going to be a wonderful day because my wife, Jimmy and his wife “I Believe” are coming to see me and eventually slack pack me to help me catch up with the Free Range Crew. Actually if I can hike 23 miles tomorrow ( doubtful) I might be able to catch those boys tomorrow on my own as I think they will be heading into town for a resupply.

I woke up to the most relaxing sound of rain hitting the roof of our shelter. In the center of the shelter there is a plexiglass skylight and I could see the intensity of the rain from the dry safety inside. It didn’t matter that it was raining because I was going to see my lovely wife and my dear friends today it could be hailing rocks for that matter. I was the first person to get up and get my gear together. Rosy and Chipper were slowly getting up and we all planned to hike a really big day 24.1 miles into town. We planned to meet Rhonda, Jimmy and I Believe at PA 183 for a quick reunion and some trail magic and then move on.
We hit 1200 miles today Ooh Rah!The rain was steady but not too hard, however parts of the trail were extremely muddy and of course the rocks were very slick. I so enjoyed hiking with Chipper and Rosy they are such a sweet interesting couple we were deep in conversation when we heard what we thought was a bear jump out of the bushes right towards us, the bear was actually my lovely wife Rhonda who had hiked in a couple of hundred yards and hidden waiting to ambush me.
Of course I was startled than elated to see her. We all laughed so hard and hiked towards the parking lot in the rain, “I Believe “ was down the trail a bit videoing us as we approached. It was great to see her and Jimmy who was waiting in the parking lot. I was overcome with happiness enjoying this  reunion! Also waiting for us I met a local trail angel “Quiet John “ who had shuttled the Free Range Crew into town earlier this morning. He was so kind helping us all! 
As you might guess our goal of hiking another 15 miles was out the window. It was cold , rainy and with my wife and friends there my priorities quickly changed. 
Rosy and Chipper jumped in with Quiet John and went into town. I of course joined Rhonda ,Jimmy and I Believe and headed to a different town but we would all reunite later.
That evening we all got together for dinner,The Free Range Crew was back together once again!! I’m still 15 miles behind but I will catch up tomorrow .Can someone please identify this really cool flower in the picture? Thanks","501 Shelter

 The rain was steadily pelting our tent when we awoke. It was so relaxing laying there in the tent with Rhonda but I had to get ready for our rocky climbs that lay ahead today. Millie  a very sweet local trail angel had cooked a breakfast casserole and had brought it to us in the rain.The food was amazing complete with a fluffy chocolate pie that was to die for. This week has been over the top with the trail magic we have received from friends, family and strangers alike.
Thank you Millie for such an outstanding gesture of kindness!

Soon we were climbing over super slick rocks in the rain. Each step was incredibly perilous and unfortunately several of our group slipped and fell ,thankfully only minor tumbles today. I personally went super slow and was fortunate enough to stay upright all day. The rain continued to fall and the weather stayed cool , it’s easy to understand how one can become hypothermic even in the summer.
I definitely plan to have Rhonda send me my cold weather items when I get closer to New Hampshire.
The rain finally quit and we hiked a relatively short distance day, I personally was happy to get off the trail in one piece .

We purposely started a little later this morning, Chipper, Rosy, Nash and of course my Free Range Crew took off for a leisurely stroll on a near perfect day. I say near perfect because some of the rocks were still a little wet and today we were traversing the Knife Edge a challenging walk across the peaks of rocks. Picture walking across the roofline of your home... ok that’s a bit of an exaggeration but it is kinda like that but not as steep or narrow. 
We all made it across unscathed. Unfortunately we found out later that Iron Man was climbing out of Lehigh Gap and fell backwards and broke his wrist and will have to have surgery at the first of the week. That is such terrible news to share but we are grateful he did not fall all the way down and got hurt even worse. 
The Free Range Crew decided to stop a little early so that we could check on Ironman and spend some more time with Rhonda. Chipper, Rosy and Nash stayed on the trail and pressed on . That evening we all went to an Italian restaurant, I sat next to Ironman and he was in good spirits very optimistic about his surgery and hopefully quick return to the trail.

We started the day with the challenging climb out of Lehigh Gap. It was only RG, Stingray and Myself. Q is going to be off trail for some fun personal R and R. He has gone home for a quick trip to see his family and will catch up with us the same way that I did. It’s like herding chickens trying to keep the Free Range Crew together. The climb out of the gap was challenging but a lot of fun, hand over hand climbing, with the river and the town below us in the backdrop. I stuffed my trekking poles in the outside pouch of my pack as I would not be using them on this section. I want to offer some gear advice;periodically breakdown your telescoping poles and lubricate the joints. I have not been doing this and my poles will no longer collapse I’m sure a little WD 40 and some elbow grease will resolve this issue. 
Today was super hard for me as you  know Rhonda came to visit this week and has helped many hikers distributing trail magic and helping us all with her uplifting spirit and generosity. She had to go back home today and it just rips out my heart to see her go. 
The rocks in Painsylvania have gotten worse , each step is brutal on our feet. It’s not the big boulders but the smaller rocks that won’t allow your feet to touch the ground. Also it’s amazing how many are on edge so you easily feel the impact though your shoes.  I was .2 miles from my camping spot when I let my guard down and took a hard spill on those lovely rocks. Fortunately no harm no foul, but I scared Stingray and RG who watched me crash onto the jagged rocks.
Well we finally got our tents set up, meals cooked and bear bags hung.

It matters not that Jimmy is close to the age of our retired AT hiking group. He is a father figure to so many on the trail.

The trail was brutal on our feet today, I would recommend nice thick soles to traverse these rocks , sometimes it’s impossible to place your foot on a flat surface for miles and the toll gets to you.

That man can hike and his journaling superb, he was and is a great inspiration to me.  I digress.. On June 17, 2017 my life almost ended. I had a massive heart attack with 99% blockage in the LAD artery what is commonly known as the widow maker because of the high death risk.
I mention this for three main reasons.
Please make sure you are getting yearly checkups and familiarize yourself with pre-heart attack symptoms. My symptoms were simply feeling tired , I mistook it for altitude fatigue as I was visiting Asheville NC at the time. We are not promised any length of time on this earth. Don’t put off your dreams. Put God and your family first. Work is great but don’t let it consume you.If you do have a life threatening event such as I did, follow your prescribed medical plan, especially the physical rehab. With some time and effort you can hopefully come back as good as new.

Highpoint State Park is the highest point in New Jersey hence the name. I should have guessed that. 
The picture from yesterday; The Monument on High Point was built to honor war veterans. Master mason Michael Maddaluna began construction of the 220 foot (67 m) tower – which has a base which is 34 feet square – in 1928 and completed it in 1930. When it’s open you can climb up and have some great views. Unfortunately it was closed when we got there.
This morning we got on the trail around 7:30 am not too early. The trail has definitely gotten less rocky in this section.
We hiked seven miles into Unionville New York ( yes New York) and had a fantastic meal at the General Store , we had a Taylor Ham and egg and cheese sandwich. For those that don’t know Taylor Ham is a cross between ham and bacon and it is exceptionally tasty. I can’t believe we don’t have this delicacy in the south! We followed up by going down the street and enjoying some authentic NY Pizza  that was extremely good , much better than the famous Bleeker St Pizza in NYC in my opinion. 
Unionville is a village in Orange County, New York, United States. Very small town, according to Wikipediah The population was 612 at the 2010 census, making it by far the smallest village in Orange County and one of the smallest in New York State. The cool thing is that it’s right off the AT. We are back in NJ and will officially crossover into NY in a day or two. 
The hiking was great today , I saw a black squirrel today the first one ever . I believe all the squirrels back home are gray but we do also have the rare fox squirrel. The black squirrel is beautiful, plenty of gray squirrels out here as well. The trail took us through some low wet lands and we saw several people out bird watching and hiking.
 Our day ended with a sharp climb up Pochuck Mountain. We heard from Q and he is hiking strong and closing the gap. We will do less than ten miles tomorrow and head into the town of Vernon NJ for a resupply and possibly overnight stay. I believe he will catch us in a couple of days.

Who new New Jersey would be so much fun? Today we walked miles of wooden board walks across low wetlands. Being from Florida it was hard to believe alligators did not live in this beautiful habitat, oh I forget the winters get pretty cold up here. Hard to believe as the day was approaching 80 degrees and tropically humid. We crossed over a large wooden bridge over a fast flowing brown creek, I’m assuming the brown water was caused by the rains, hopefully the water is normally clear. We saw several day hikers/trail runners enjoying the day and everyone was extremely friendly just like the good ole south.
New Jersey has been a very pleasant surprise with the challenging mountain climbs, beautiful views and wonderful low country, just heavenly! In fact we headed to Heaven Hill Farm today for their famous apple cider donuts and ice cream. But first we stopped at Mitch’s Roadside Grill for the two hotdog special. Mitch is retired Navy and is hilarious , his deadpan humor had us rolling with laughter.
His hotdogs were amazingly good and we had a local soft drink Birch Beer similar to Root Beer but sweeter almost like a cherry coke maybe sarsaparilla ??
The Heaven Hill donuts were very tasty and we hung out with other hikers on their front porch enjoying all kinds of fruit and pastries.

Hiking the AT is super easy and fattening.....well maybe today!
We decided to call and get a ride to the Appalachian Motel. The rooms were super clean and very reasonable. The owner took us and Pink Socks who had decided to get a room to a local Italian restaurant and grocery store to resupply .
We only got enough food for three days it’s hard to gauge how much food to carry as we keep running into trail towns with cool places to eat, no complaints on my end!
Back at the motel I decided to conduct a water intrusion test with my Hyperlite Windrider 3400 backpack, many miles ago in Damascus I had also invested in two water resistant dyneema pods but I had not felt comfortable getting rid of my trash compactor bag for fear of getting all of my stuff wet in a rainstorm. Well as some of you know my pack is white or was white and it seriously needed a bath so I put some tissue in one of the pods and brought my pack into the shower for some extensive testing and scrubbing. Success, the tissue stayed perfectly dry, unfortunately the pack is still “off white” but much cleaner.

Halo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617327,"Vernon to Stealth Site in New York 10.5
This morning we returned to The farmers market and I got an apple, orange and a banana, I ate them one right after the other and downed a red Gatorade. Super fuel for the steep climb up Stairway to Heaven. The only problem was that it was raining and the rocks would be slick and dangerous. We decided we would climb extra slow and again do shorter miles. As we were hiking the approach trail I noticed what looked to be a blackberry flat dab in the middle of the trail. I looked up and saw a tree loaded with what was actually mulberries. I used my trekking pole to grab a limb and commenced to eating my fourth fruit of the day. RG and Stingray just watched me as they were full from the cider donuts they just ate. The rain started to slack but the damage was done everything was soaked and the humidity extreme. The Stairway was actually a very steep rock scramble up the mountain but I actually enjoyed climbing it very much. The trail the entire day today was very rocky but the good news is it cleared up and the sun came out later in the day and we were rewarded with some spectacular views. 
Today we officially crossed over into our 9th state New York, my birth state Ooh Rah! We could actually see The NYC skyline from Prospect Rock the highest point on the AT in NY. It was so cool even though the city was so far away. 
So did you know that bears can fly? 
Yesterday as we were hiking we heard crashing in the woods coming towards us at a high speed, branches were cracking and leaves flying but when I caught a glimpse I could tell this creature was airborne. It wasn’t a flying bear after all but a huge Tom Turkey barreling through the trees , tough yes graceful not so much. Often when I’m laying in my tent at night I try to guess what animal I may be hearing outside in the dark . I would have guessed a herd of elephants the amount of noise this turkey generated.
Today we saw a little spike deer and later a baby fawn. I hope the little one finds his mother. 
We finally found a place to set up camp near a stream. We had started to fix our meals when Pink Socks showed up and we invited her to set up and join us. 
We are all now tucked into our tents , it’s not raining still a bit humid but all is good.","Vernon New Jersey

The Mosquitos were in full force this morning, I Deet up every morning with Ben’s 30% strength Deet but that bug juice did not deter them at all, I’ll definitely be picking up some 100% Deet at my next stop. BTW I’ve been taking garlic pills and evidently that does not deter them either.
We had several hand over hand rock climbs today. Those are so much fun, if anything this hike has reverted me back to my childhood ways. One day I’ll have to share an almost mishap climbing story on Signal Mountain when I was a kid. Today we decided to take a blue side trail into the village of Greenwood Lake NY. We heard there was a great Cafe “The Village Buzz” and we wanted to check it out. The food was truly fantastic and the owner was extremely nice to us ! Greenwood Lake is a very cool town , the village was settled in the early 1700s, there is a beautiful lake with very expensive lake homes. Back in the day ,1934 ish, Babe Ruth would frequent this village and had a beautiful mahogany motor boat that he would zip around the lake in. Betty Garbo would also vacation in this resort town and now three not so famous stinky hikers have hung out here also. 
We went to the local hardware and bought some fuel and I called Garmin to try and get some assistance with my explorer GPS that has stopped working unfortunately no luck.
We had to climb the very steep blue side trail back up the mountain but the extra steps were well worth it. Once we got back to the AT we only had a few short miles before we hit the 17a trail crossing . Set up in the parking lot was the trail manic legend “Tent Man” who handed us cold cokes and snacks. But get this he also gave us each a brand new pair of Darn Tough Socks!! For those that don’t know these are one of the finest pair of hiking socks money can buy , full life time warranty and exactly what I use , Thank you so very much Tent Man!!
You are so kind to help us out and your generosity is amazing.
Another great surprise while we were sitting there B Mack who had signed my guest book drove up and  I had the honor of meeting him. B Mack has done a lot of trail maintenance on the AT and has been a Boy Scout leader for years serving as an ambassador for these mountains. We actually got to camp out with B Mack at WildCat Shelter later that evening and he gave me and the Free Range Crew a lot of history and back ground info on the trail. Thank you B Mack for every thing you do, your generosity and best wishes on your upcoming Thru Hike , I will look forward to following you on Trail Journals , I need that fried Spam recipe lol!
Before we hiked up to the shelter we took a slight detour and hiked to Bellvelle Farm Creamery.  I can’t begin to explain how totally amazing their ice cream tastes . We hung out there for at least two hours, I was the guy sleeping on the sidewalk enjoying my overly full ice cream belly in the shade..... I mentioned I reverted to my childhood , I believe I had more sense than that as a kid. 
Wildlife update: As I napped on the super soft cement side walk a bear crossed the road right there in front of the Creamery. I totally missed it but RG and Stingray saw it, bummer for me. The next day we took another short hiking day 13.6 in two days is not exactly setting any distance speed records but guess what??? Yay Q caught us tonight!!
We were all so very happy to have our long lost Free Ranger back to complete our quad.  Life is great again and we can start crunching some miles, well after a run into town tomorrow to resupply and celebrate with more food. Everyday is a holiday and every meal is a banquet, OOHRAH!


PS: I sincerely want to thank everyone who is reading my journal and sharing my adventure and also thank you for signing my guest book. Your words of encouragement mean so much to me. I’m blown away that kiddos are learning a little bit about the trail in school from my journal. Truly I never feel alone with your support.

Halo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617651,"Day 131 New York, Stealth camp at Little Dam to Tuxedo Motel, Day 132 Tuxedo Motel to stealth camp at Black Mountain total 14 miles.
Yesterday we decided to go into the town of Monroe to resupply. We had run across a couple of section hikers going southbound and they had encountered an aggressive bear that had taken their food bag so we shared our food with them. Unfortunately now we were very low  on our own food.
We ate breakfast packed up and hiked a couple of miles down to the highway and called a cab to shuttle us to Walmart. On our way to Walmart we saw an IHOP restaurant and we told our driver to stop and drop us off there ,we would hike to Walmart later , Eating always takes precedence,first things first! We each finished our second breakfast consisting of a plate of pancakes , eggs bacon etc and ended our feast with a milkshake . After breakfast we headed to Walmart for a much needed resupply and then we got a room at a motel in the nearby town of Tuxedo. 
Today started bright and early, we hiked down the hill to the gas station to wait on our cab that would arrive at 6:30 am. We got to the station before 6 am and had to wait for the owner to arrive a few minutes late. We were able to grab a breakfast sandwich before our ride arrived to drop us off at the trail head. The climbs today were steep with more hand over hand ascents and with the heat and humidity it was quite the workout. One particular section we traversed today is called the Lemon Squeezer as the name implies is a very tight squeeze through the rocks ending with an extreme climb at the end. We all successfully made it and did not have to use the bypass trail. 
We continued to climb pretty tough terrain and we were rewarded with a section of the trail with wild blueberries which we stopped to pick and eat . We pushed on up to Black Mountain which had a beautiful view of the Hudson River and a distant view of the NYC skyline . We could not pass up this opportunity to view the skyline at night so we decided to stealth camp. Pink Socks showed up later in the evening and decided to join us as well. Tonight we have a spectacular view complete with early Fourth of July fireworks in the distance. Totally Amazing! I forgot to mention I bought four little American flags and we decorated our campsite . Free Range is celebrating Independence Day week in style!","Stealth Campsite

My favorite night so far was followed by the coolest sunrise ever. The NYC skyline is actually to the west of us from Black Mountain, when the sun rose the orange reflection off one particular glass building in NYC made it appear as if the sun was rising in the west it totally blew my sense of direction until I could figure out what was going on. I was the first one up so I had to let the Free Range Crew in on this wonderful sight, slowly the other buildings magically appeared , reminded me of the fabled lost city of Atlantis. 
Our final destination for today is unknown well north for sure. Our first target is Bear Mountain ,on the way we were treated with trail blessings from a local hiking group called Kings Legend .
They served , noodles meatballs , spring rolls, hot dogs, donuts ,fruit and much much more.Thank you so much Kings Legend!
The climb up Bear mountain was challenging to add to the challenge of the trail was the number of people enjoying it today. This trail is the busiest section we have been on. The climb down was also very steep but more granite steps than trail. This downhill side was extremely busy as it led to the Bear Mountain Inn and Lake Area.The Lake was packed with people grilling and hanging out . I was still very full from the trail magic but did get a frozen ice sorbet in fact we all did except for Stingray.

The Appalachian Trail actually runs through a zoo at this park, I normally enjoy zoos I really do ,but I found myself feeling sorry for the bears, foxes etc. I guess I’ve been enjoying the wildlife out in their environment for so long it just did not seem right to see them cooped up in a cage.
I was glad to hike the bridge over the Hudson and back into  the woods. Honestly the parks were so crowded today I felt uncomfortable around all of the people. Tonight it’s steadily raining and we are camped out on the back edge of a multi use ball field . All is good, we hit 1400 miles today , OohRah!","Black Mountain

Rhonda will tell you I’m not the most organized person in the world. But out here I’ve become super efficient and organized, you have to living out of a pack, I mean if I accidentally put my wallet in the wrong pocket  of my shorts I freak until I can place it back where it belongs. Everything has a specific place in my pack and it’s packed the same way every day. Last night when we were setting up our tents , I panicked because my tent was not in my pack. I instantly thought how hard it would be to backtrack those rocky mountains and not to mention it was about to rain. As I was starting to get upset at myself  it hit me , I had stuffed my tent in the outside netting so that it would dry as I hiked today. I was so relieved but boy did I feel dumb. Last night it rained early on but it quit after an hour or two. Sleeping in a ball field was comfortable however the rain and the dew again got our tents quite wet. Lesson learned,I’ll pack my tent exactly where it belongs.
We hiked out pretty early to hopefully avoid the New York Heat.I did not know it got so blazing hot during the day this far north.
Four hours into the hike we were surprised with trail magic my wife had arranged with Sunshine and Bluegrass it was perfect timing for a lunch break , they fed us bananas, oranges and Capri suns, Perfect!!!It’s always so great to see Bluegrass and Sunshine my original tramily. The Free Range Crew took off to head to Canopus lake our destination for tonight.I stayed back and called my wife as I had excellent reception in this particular field. I found out later that there is a snack bar at the lake but it closed at 4 pm. I had five miles to do in about two hours. On flat ground no problem but rocky climbs this was going to be a challenge. I started flying and I soon caught Timber who was traveling slow do to some foot issues . He picked up the pace and we booked it in together. We soon caught Stingray and he had great news, RG and Q had raced on in ahead and had ordered us all hamburgers and fries , so we slowed down and cruised on in the lake area and there the food was waiting on us . How cool is that?
Another great day on the trail, tonight there are several tents in a field by this beautiful lake park.

My least favorite camp chore is blowing up my air mattress every night. You would think my lungs would be getting stronger by now. Some say the saddest sound is releasing the air from the mattress in the morning, not me I’m ready to roll out of this uncomfortable thing at five every morning. 
Today we climbed a mountain and we found  a flag painted on the rocks. Normally I’m against all graffiti but this Flag is special as it’s a tribute to 9/11. Rhonda and I got to visit the 9/11 memorial in NYC last year and it will rip your heart out. I highly recommend that everyone should visit this memorial if possible. The mountains are not particularly high in Upstate New York , but the climbs are steep and lots of boulders and rocks (not as many as PA). There are beautiful farmlands and great views from the peaks. Today at lunch on the trail I met my first official south bounder . South Bounders or SOBO for short are hikers that generally start in Maine at Mount Katahdin and hike south to Georgia where I started. This year Katahdin opened late because of all the snow so some SOBO hikers started in other locations and will skip back up to summit Katahdin later.
Wildlife update- I saw a skunk today, she was very beautiful . I believe this is the first one I’ve ever seen in the wild.  Fortunately she did not spray us. 
10 miles in we crossed a road and a short distance away there was a deli and pizza joint. Yes we detoured in case you were wondering and got some tasty subs, ice cream, drinks and snacks. New York is awesome, I think I’m gaining weight. 
We hiked an additional 4 miles and set up our camp for the evening.

Got our usual semi early start around 6:45 am.
We stopped at the beautiful Nuclear Lake for second breakfast .
The peculiar name of this lake comes from a plutonium research facility that was once located on the shores of the lake. The facility was shut down in 1972 after a chemical explosion occurred. The area was tested and deemed safe before the AT was routed past the lake in the late 70s. Nowadays, the lake is a gorgeous destination for hiking (although you may want to avoid drinking the water

We saw Dover Oak today it’s the biggest Oak on the AT,bigger than the Keffer Oak back In VA. 
We hiked thru wetlands today very similar to our hikes in New Jersey. Great lengths of wooden board walks kept us dry. The AT intersects with a Rail Road Stop that will carry you into the big city if you want.
At the end of the trail before the Pawling road crossing some nice trail angel left us a cooler with drinks and snacks. We were almost completely dry out of water so the magic was timed perfectly. To top that off there was a garden shop close by and the owner let us hang out under his gazebo. Then the final great news there was a food truck parked around the corner Super Score!! After our late lunch we headed up to the next shelter area and camped out. Marvel, Natalie and a couple all tented close by . A couple of raccoons tried to get into Marvel’s Ursac which is a bear proof bag that you don’t need to hang.

I’m sure they have enjoyed watermelon and barbecue as we normally do. After a few miles of hiking in the heat this morning I decided to wade a beautiful ice cold stream to cool off, I took off my shoes and decided to get my whole body completely wet , incredibly exhilarating. Later the fellas caught up with me at a road crossing, there we were the recipients of another day of trail magic and had watermelon on the trail, perfect for a blazing hot day like today. Thank you so very much! The lady told us about a covered bridge nearby and of course I had to check it out. Did I tell you I’m in New England?

So last night I arrived and set up camp around 9PM , I decided not to stay in town with the Free Range Crew who had commandeered a B &B at a very decent rate . 
The fireworks were booming all around me unfortunately it was not scaring off the mosquitos.

I found a stealth site And set up right by a creek, I was so relieved as the trail was about to shoot up a mountain. I quickly dove in my tent for protection from the miniature vampires and was just about to doze off when I felt something hit my tent. Q is that you? No answer, crickets chirping . Well after a while I heard something large jump in the creek, ok no problem probably a deer or a bear. Well, I finally got to sleep when whap! something hit my tent again. I decided to jump out and investigate but first I had to put my sweat soaked clothes on which by the way never dry and they stink. Nonetheless I put on my garb went out and shined my headlamp all around and lo and behold I was camping under a crabapple tree . I totally missed that fun fact pitching my tent in the dark. 
I was quite relieved it wasn’t the neighborhood kids hurling projectiles at my very fragile abode. 
Today’s hike was over the top hot, I’ve talked to a few hikers who are kicking back during the day and hiking in the evenings and by headlamp. Not for me I’m not coordinated enough and plus I would need a really good bug suit. 
Once I made it to the top I had an extremely steep descent , I literally sat on my bottom and had to Scooch down at least once down the sheer rock face to keep from falling. 
Once at the bottom the trail winded along the Housatonic River  for several miles. This section was very relaxing watching the fly fisherman at play.  Several day hikers were out enjoying the heat and I must of spent at least an hour answering questions the people were very friendly and genuinely interested in my hike. 
Well eventually the flat trail ended and boy were the climbs tough. I made it to the last mountain road crossing before the shelter and I ran into PAC Man and his son Roomba who had just ordered a pizza and Mountain Dew . I graciously accepted a couple of slices and a drink. After about an hour or two we climbed another steep mountain and made it to our site. 
Tonight is going to be humid and hot. I’ll keep the fly of the tent open. I’ll get an early start as I need to go into town and pick up a package Rhonda sent me. Q texted and they camped seven miles back. I’m sure I’ll see them soon!","Stealth site by creek

 I woke up at 5 am and was on the trail by 5:45 am. A couple of climbs and I would be in the quaint little town of Falls Village  CT.  I’m telling you although the distance was short I struggled to get there. My back was hurting and the humidity was at 100% .  I needed to get to the post office in Falls Village  by 12:00 PM to pick up a package Rhonda had mailed me.  I’m almost 1500 miles in and unfortunately I’ve noticed several of us are starting to fall apart.

I made it to the post office in plenty of time and then I went over to the Toy Makers cafe for a breakfast sandwich which was delightful. I washed it down with a New England soft drink called Moxie. Dave the owner of the hostel I decided to stay at, came and picked Pac-Man, Roomba and myself up and took us to the nearby town of Salisbury CT where his place is at. It turned out his hostel was a historic home ,we each had our own private room, use of the kitchen laundry etc all for $45.00 per night. I decided I would take a Zero the next day as well. I forgot to mention the home was walking distance to several restaurants and a gas station for resupplying.

Q would come join me at the home the next morning and RG and Stingray would continue on.

We climbed and descended a couple of steep mountains today but actually they did not feel that hard primarily because we had another day of outstanding weather. Bear Mountain is the highest peak in the Southern Taconic mountains. We climbed up slowly mainly because we kept stopping to eat wild blueberries growing alongside the trail. Indeed it was steep and the descent on the north side was even steeper but we made it no problems. 
Our day got side tracked when we discovered Guilder Pond. This is a beautiful Glacial lake with a big rock beach area. There was a Ridge Runner “Clydesdale “ hanging out and we all went for a long swim. Others started showing up later and were captured by the vortex of the crystal clear water and beautiful spring like weather.
We decided to cook our dinner by the lake, it truly felt like a picnic. Swimming is more fun than hiking just my opinion...
We finally hiked in to the next shelter area and pitched our tents. The place was/is crawling with young kids camping from a nearby summer camp. Q and I presented a mini class on how to hang a bear bag and the kids enjoyed throwing the rock line.

So for whatever reason, my sense of direction was off this morning luckily Q was around to set me straight. I wanted to go south out of camp instead of north weird how the mind can play mean tricks like that.
Once we got going in the right direction the trail led us down some steep descents . At one point we walked in a bog and the mosquitos were horrendous. I’m not sure but I believe they prefer Q’s blood over mine , maybe my garlic pills are working. 
A couple of churches got together and provided trail magic which included grilled hamburgers and homemade cookies. I promise you I have gained some weight since entering NJ ,NY and New England , either a deli or trail magic almost everyday most excellent!
When we got to a road crossing  we called the famous Joe who shuttles hikers in this area and always features them on his instagram account.  He took us to a nice grocery store in Great Barrington for us to resupply and then he came back and brought us to the trailhead. Thank you Joe!!
With our now heavier loaded packs we headed back to trail and climbed , climbed ,climbed.
I believe my cardiologist is going to be amazed at my next checkup . I can really tell a difference on how my heart does going up the mountains. I still keep my speed in check and certainly I get winded but my heart does not feel like it’s trying to beat out of my chest.

Yesterday the threat of rain had us pushing to get to Upper Goose Pond Cabin which is an enclosed building with 14 bunks upstairs. It truly is a neat place on a beautiful lake with canoes that we can use. By the time we arrived after seven PM I was too beat to even go swimming. I watched Q and several others enjoy a late evening swim while I ate my Ramen noodles.  I finally got to meet Yalah formerly Tiger . She’s a super nice young lady that the rest of Free Range had befriended while I was gone. She’s quite the hiker and likes to swim every chance she can. She’s also super smart and will be attending Brown University Med school in Rhode Island in the fall. 
Today the sweet caretaker at the cabin fixed us pancakes, they truly were amazing. She said the secret ingredient is the spring water. Whatever it is they are the best pancakes I’ve ever had. So last night it barely rained at all but just enough to make all the rocks super slick today. Yes I slipped and busted my tail and Q also tripped and fell as well. If it wasn’t for the stupid rocks hiking would be fun. However roots are evil as well and will trip you every chance they can.
We are both fine.  On a more serious note as we got to the October shelter we saw emergency personnel with a stretcher.A trail maintainer had a medical issue maybe heart or heat related. Q and I helped the first responders carry him off the mountain to the ambulance waiting below. We believe he will be ok. Later we stopped by the famous Cookie Lady’s home and she served us cookies, ice cream and boiled eggs
What a late afternoon treat. It was hard to get going from there but we had 6 miles to go and it was 6:30 PM.

The Free Range Crew got up and ate a quick breakfast and we enjoyed catching up on each other’s adventures. It truly is like the Lord of the Rings trilogy when the band would separate and reunite. Instead of trolls and ring wraiths chasing us it’s the younger bubble of hikers. Actually I’ve said it before but the true gem of this hike are the hikers and the town people we meet.

We had a quick three mile hike into the town of Dalton Massachusetts and had a very good second breakfast at the Juice and Java Restaurant.
Q and I would stay and resupply as we were almost completely out of food , also our clothes after a week of heat and high humidity needed to be burned but we settled for a good washing. RG and Stingray had spent the last night in another town and would hike on to the next shelter.

We will need our group together to make it thru the mystic magical Whites of New Hampshire and the dreaded 100 mile Wilderness of Maine. As BTO once said “You Ain’t Seen Nothing Yet” . The last quarter of the trail will truly be the most challenging. Soon we enter beautiful state of Vermont, hopefully the mud pits have  dried out by now.

Halo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618818,"Day 147 , 17 miles Dalton to Mount Greylock. 

This morning we hiked out of town after a quick breakfast at the Juice and Java Restaurant. The AT runs directly thru Dalton and we would hike thru the town of Cheshire later on in the day.
As we were hiking we heard some very disturbing news. My friend 
Pac Man who I was recently hiking with, contracted a tick borne illness.
It’s not Lyme disease but equally debilitating with flu like symptoms. 
Unfortunately his hike has ended. 
He’s optimistic he will recover and I’m praying that he will. 

The odds are against us making it all the way , it really is . Out of the 12 people I started with way back at the Springer shelter in February there are only 3 of us left that may finish and there are no guarantees we won’t get hurt , get sick or some other life event that may take us off.
Well , I just have to do the best I can to be careful and check for ticks etc, those little critters are scary news. 
Later on in the day we climbed a mountain and it had a marble outcropping named Cobble Stone.
The views were fantastic from this vantage point and we could see Mnt Greylock the highest peak in Massachusetts in the far distance . If all went as planned we would summit Mnt Greylock later in the evening. But first the trail led us into the town of Cheshire . Conveniently the trail went right by an ice cream/sandwich shop where Q and I ordered some hot dogs and ice cream. Normally I love hot dogs but the bread they served it on was too old. The ice cream was great but very expensive $6.75 for a waffle cone and moose tracks ice cream, high trail robbery!
After our less than stellar lunch we started the climb to the highest point in Mass , we actually summited an hour earlier than I anticipated and we were able to catch an amazing sunset.On top of the mountain there is a beautiful war memorial tower which is also like a light tower at night. 
We got a couple of bunks in the Lodge/castle. The owner sold me a pork chop dinner for half price. Q had already fixed dinner and did not care for another meal but did get some homemade ice cream.
Tonight we are in a bunk room with 3 other people. Comfortable bed two nights in a row, sweet!","Dalton Massachusetts

The bunk room at the lodge only had five of us last night so we slept very comfortably. There were two section hikers from Florida; Half Full and Teflon and we believe lord Greylock the wizard himself. The stay included coffee and blueberry muffins for breakfast. Everyone including the other guests in the private rooms were very nice to us and several asked us about our hike. The wizard disappeared into thin air and we never heard from him again. We enjoyed the facilities and were not in any hurry to get going . We eventually got our gear together and finally hit the trail around 9:30 AM.

The trail led us thru Williamstown Massachusetts. Another small trail town but it has a nice grocery store the “Stop & Shop” so we got a few items and ordered a couple of sandwiches from the deli.

We hit 1600 miles today, and we crossed over into the new state of Vermont, and most importantly we saw another porcupine,Ooh Rah!
I can’t believe we only have 3 states left. Tomorrow Q’s cousins are coming to hike with us. I am looking forward to meeting them .

The rest of the day was more hiking in slick mud. We all slipped a lot but fortunately no one got hurt. After a long day we finally got to the road crossing and Q was able to persuade someone to give us a ride to our motel . Kim and Keith survived the day ,18 miles on the third day pretty amazing!

I was caught totally by surprise when I entered the home and everyone sang happy birthday to me.  There was a birthday cake and welcome signs,vegetable and fruit platters. It was pretty amazing and all of my hiker friends enjoyed the party as well.

When Kirk found out we were trying to catch up he magnanimously invited Q and I to join them at their beautiful home. I had never met Kirk but I had recently met his wonderful daughter Yalla and it turns out she would be coming home tonight off the trail with Pineapple and Stretch.

The OBOZ sawtooth performed well, they are a true hiking shoe like I’ve mentioned before but do get extremely heavy when wet and take a long time to dry. Unfortunately the toe guards did not last long but other than that they did fine. One of my friends “Dead Cat” claims Oboz will provide two additional free pairs of shoes while we are on a thru hike. I shot the company an email and will see if that’s true. But as always “I got ,got ,got no time”. So I went ahead with my purchase. Q’s been successfully wearing New Balance and bought some more.

He was one of the most confident, extremely athletic, young man you could ever meet. He would have laughed at the sign put a dip in his mouth and said come on ‘Lo let’s fly up this little hill.  So I took a deep breath and I started the climb.

Sure enough as we sat on the side of the road eating our lunch we stared at the Goliath of a mountain Mount Webster that we were about to climb and as big as it was we had to climb it’s bigger brother Mount Jackson directly behind it.
The ascent was climbing hand over hand on the Webster Cliffs in many areas. Mount Jackson was over 4,000 feet and was extremely challenging as well. Tomorrow we tackle the famous Mount Washington, I’ve been so looking forward to this climb . I would like to recommend a very good book

Not without Peril 
https://books.google.com/books...

This book highlights the dangers of the Whites particularly Mount Washington.
The summit of Mount Washington, the highest peak in the northeast, is home to the most extreme weather in the world, with wind speeds reaching up to 200 miles per hour and temperatures dropping below freezing even at some points in the summer. Actually the highest recorded wind speed in the world is from Mount Washington.The summit complex is rounded out by the Mount Washington Observatory, a high-tech weather station that is staffed year-round by meteorologists and other scientists.
Due to the mountain's height and unique weather patterns, Mount Washington is one of the most dangerous places on the Appalachian Trail. If there is any chance of thunderstorms, in fact any chance of rain you should absolutely stay off the summit.
Does that sound like a challenging day or what? Tomorrow should be another gorgeous day so no worries for the climb. These past few days have been so exciting, sometimes a little scary and extremely difficult. This is exactly why we are all here, tonight I am a happy camper.","Zealand Falls area

The ascent up Washington was long but not especially steep and certainly not as technical as yesterday’s climbs.When we finally summited we were surprised at how many people where running around all over the place. A train called the Cog brings loads of tourists up to the summit and there is a road up to the top as well. We actually had to stand in line on the AT behind families in flip flops to summit and take our picture beside the sign. I felt a little out of place, the summit is a theme park with free admission to all but I paid a dear price to get here. (I’m starting to sound a bit entitled?)

The Wildcats ( a series of mountains peaks part of the Whites) lived up to their name. Truly I left a piece of me up in those mountains. The climbs were super tough sometimes hand over hand, but the descents were downright brutal, organized falls as Rhonda likes to call them. I call them unplanned beatings. The day started out with a steady but light rain. The problem of course is that the rocks and bedrock trails became slick as an ice skating rink. I fell hard a couple of times and my slow pace became a crawl, actually more of a butt slide on the descents some planned others forced. Unfortunately the mountains did not give up any views as we stayed in a cloud most of the day. Finally the weather broke around 4 pm and we slowly started seeing the beauty that was hiding in the mist. I hiked alone most of the day, my shoes are horrible on the wet rocks and I plan to correct that issue Friday. I know, I know it seems over indulgent purchasing so many shoes on trail but I only have 300 miles left and I can’t get hurt now if I can help it.

When I got to the top of Keith Carter Mountain the sun was setting which  was spectacular however I still had to descend one and a half miles to reach my campsite where Free Range was waiting. I decided to set up my tent and not risk another beating climbing down with my headlamp. Tonight I’m all alone on the beautiful peak of Carter Mountain the wind is howling above me but I’m protected by all the Christmas trees.... or is that howling a pack of wolves or wildcats ?","Pinkham Notch

I woke an hour before sunrise and heated my water for my coffee and instant breakfast in my tent vestibule. Last night I did something I’ve not done the entire time I’ve been out here, I slept with my food bag inside my tent. Very risky but last night I looked around and all I saw were Christmas tree shaped spruce trees with no offsetting branch to hang my bag. The cool thing is I didn’t need to get out of my sleeping bag to cook, ahh breakfast in bed. Soon enough I had  a very glorious sunrise and I wished RG and Q could have seen it with me, but they were safe and sound at the bottom of this steep mountain and I still needed to climb down. The going was slow as the rocks were wet. I slipped twice landing on the not so soft rocks. I knew I had made the right decision by not attempting this decent by headlamp. Eventually I made it down and later caught up with Free Range down the trail. Gary picked us up at two pm at the Gorham road crossing and took us back to his home for showers and resupply. He first drove me to a local hiking outfitter and I purchased a pair of Merrill Moab II Ventilator hiking shoes which have a Vibram sole and should grip better on the wet rocks....sigh.

Today it rained off and on. My new shoes are working well so far very comfortable and they are gripping well , btw I bought 11 m and the width is perfect, I use 11 Wide in the Oboz , that’s why it’s always best to try on these shoes as they all fit differently.
Right off the bat barely out of the notch Q spotted a bear! Unfortunately RG and I did not get to see it , I’ve actually moved on to hopefully seeing a moose, bears are so yesterday. We did see plenty of moose poop on the trail.

Exciting and challenging day today!
We traversed the Mahoosic Notch as you have heard it is known as the most difficult or fun mile on the trail. It’s basically a tight pass in a low valley between tall cliff walls .
The temperature drops several degrees when you get to the beginning of the Notch in fact there were solid pieces of ice at the bottom of some of the rocks. It took us 1 hour and 50 minutes to make it thru. That’s pretty good as we spoke to a south bounder that took over 3 hours the day before. It’s never a race, we just got lucky and found the passage thru without too many turn arounds. Some describe the notch as a massive boulder jungle gym to me it was a massive boulder maze where sometimes death defying leaps were necessary.Immediately after the Notch we were faced with two tall climbs the Mahoosic Arm and Old Spec Mt. I was totally beat up by the end of the day, to add humor to my injuries I fell into a mud bog at the top of the Arm , it was almost like quicksand and very deep. As you can imagine Q and RG had a good laugh in fact we all did. A cold washing at Old Spec Pond took care of the issue. We are now officially out of the Whites. Amazing I remember being so apprehensive about the Whites not so long ago.

Today we saw a Spruce Grouse,it’s different from the Ruffled Grouse I’m used to from Tennessee. The one I saw was black with a red bonnet and was not scared of humans, usually grouse hold tight in the brush and shoot out like a rocket when you get close. Still no moose.
Gary picked us up at the end of the day and brought us back to their home . Cathy made us homemade pizza and her award winning chocolate cake! Thank you Gary and Cathy for all that you do!

Halo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621114,"DY 176, Grafton Notch to East B Andover. 10.3 Miles.
This morning We were honored to have Gary hike with us for part of the day. We climbed the Baldpate peaks today and the views were amazing. The descent down was challenging in fact my least favorite type of hiking is descending steep smooth bedrock that is slick as glass when wet. I’m surprised more people are not seriously hurt every day. Usually hikers cling to the trees on the side of the trail to keep from busting it.

 I need to take a minute and be transparent with everyone , recently I’ve not been as chipper and upbeat about the trail as my posts appear . In fact ever since I hit the Maine border a couple of days ago ,the hole in my heart for my wife, family, church ,friends and my dog has grown and almost gotten unbearable. My body is wore out and needs to recover. I know I’m close to the end but I’m so ready to come home. Before I ever started this adventure someone told me that “They hoped I would find what I am looking for.”I remember being a little put off by that comment as I did not believe I was looking for anything in particular. I can tell you there’s nothing out here on the trail greater than what I have at home and anyone considering a thru hike needs to understand the sacrifice you and your loved ones will need to make being apart so long. If I was on a high horse I’ve been knocked off and I’ve got the scars to prove it.
I plan to dig deep and complete this quest but I felt like you needed to know I’m not as tough and resilient as I put on..... I wanna come home.","Grafton Notch

That being said Wednesday’s hike was great, the trail was retro to our earlier hikes back in Georgia . No slick steep dangerous trails. We did have a steep long climb up Wyman Mt but the trail was very manageable and not technical.Danger is always possible but Wednesday’s hike was certainly a more chill trail. Today the steep climb up Old Blue Mt was not too bad, but later in the day in a somewhat easy section my fatigue got the best of me. My mind is probably making it out to be something more serious than it really is but I told Q I would get checked out Friday. The wild Maine blueberries growing on the mountain are delightful , certainly worth the steep hike if you are in the area. The picture is from my dip in the mud the other day as you can see I wasn’t happy at first but we all had a great laugh once the shock lifted.

I love my long walks with my friends and my solitary walks with God. I’m close to achieving a goal nobody set but me. A goal that defies logic but was and is dear to my heart. I’ve learned a lot and have changed in many ways . Strangers are wonderful out here and I’m bringing the humanity lessons back home with me.

Fortunately Ice Man had  set up at a remote logging road again and he saved the day with amazing food, plus he let me borrow one of his trekking poles . This was huge as you may know I need my poles to set up my tent .
I slept as best as I could in the rain,however I’ve got a lot on my mind,the excitement of finishing, and the fear of the hurricane which keeps my sleep to a minimum. Tuesday we officially finished the 100 mile Wilderness.
My attitude towards rain has changed, when I first started I thought I was Impervious and no way would a few rain drops slow me down. I’ve learned the hard way that rain beats the finest weather resistant gear and will absolutely make your hike and sleep miserable. Shoes and socks get saturated and your feet suffer for days. Rain can cause hypothermia and certainly can kill.  We are selectively waiting to summit when the weather will be dry. Wednesday,Day 198  9.8 miles, we knocked out the almost ten miles to the Birches base camp in the rain. I was almost to the camp when I was surprised by my good friend Tom from Florida hiking southbound, I looked right at him and didn’t even recognize him. What a wonderful surprise! My wife also flew in later that evening and we all went to Millinocket and got a hotel for the night.
We will be summiting very soon!","Abol Bridge Campsite

Halo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622535,"Day 198 The summit at Mt Katahdin- The Journey’s end. 
Three strangers are now brothers, connected by overcoming physical,mental and natural adversities. We did it!! We defied the odds and completed 2,192 miles in over 6 months of rain,snow,hail, extreme heat,cold and perfect gorgeous days.

Today the climb was tough and sometimes technical going up Kathadin. However my mind was on the prize and was hardly phased physically by this magnificent mountain. When I finally saw the summit sign I was overcome with emotion that I tried unsuccessfully to hold in. Q and RG both had watery eyes as well as we slowly made our way to the sign. The summit sign was crowded with section and day hikers but someone announced that three thu-hikers were approaching and the crowd actually applauded whistled and yelled encouragements to us.Strangers were taking our pictures and treating us like rock stars , it was so surreal and made us even more emotional than we were. Not one of us wanted to be the first to touch the sign and officially end our adventure. I believe RG hugged the sign first and Q and I were at his side and we both did the same. 
We did it!!!
Three old guys living Freely on the Appalachian Mountain Range for the past six months.The adventure of a lifetime . The journey was truly the prize not the end ,miles or even the last summit climbed. Who would have guessed?

Halo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623227,"It’s hard to believe I summited Kathadin thirteen days ago. My transition off the trail has gone relatively well. Every night I continue to have active dreams about hiking and climbing, I’m hoping those will end in time, it’s almost like a reoccurring nightmare. My wife says I talk to trees in my sleep.She also got tickled that I was scolding the slick rocks .I suppose talking to trees & mountains in my sleep could be perceived as humorous. I personally think it is post trail stress disorder .  I still have hiker hunger even though I have only hiked one day since coming home. Don’t get me wrong, I miss the trail but my body needed to be done . My legs are still sore but are getting better, I’ve been going to a wellness center and exercising trying to get some of my muscles and mobility back. My biggest lesson learned (the hard way) is lack of proper nutrition on the trail. 
I believe this is part of the reason I hit such a wall in Southern Maine and why every muscle in my body has shrunk. I’ve heard we can burn close to 7,000 calories a day on a thru hike and eating Ramen,tuna,spam and protein bars everyday is probably not the best. Some of us loss twenty to thirty pounds and unfortunately for me a lot of that was muscle mass. I’m not really complaining just letting you know how the re-entry is going and highly suggesting that future thru hikers study their nutrition plan more seriously than I did. 
I want to also take a moment and thank each and every one of you for following my journal and posting encouraging comments and your prayers. I cannot begin to explain how uplifting your comments were to me especially after a super physical day. I do feel like we summited together.
I’m blown away from the generosity and care I received back home from friends and family. Truly I could not have made it with out you! It’s hard to explain how something as simple as a cookie on the trail can absolutely turn a hard day into a great one, I’m being serious!
I’m going to make an attempt to personally list some names below , which is probably a mistake because I’m sure to leave several out. 
I’ll start off with thanking my Father in Law , Dr Jack Zorn . Truly he is an inspiration to me and was my number one supporter. He insisted on taking a few steps with me in the pouring rain to see me off in Georgia. I’ll never forget his special prayer for my safety and success.Thank you Dad for watching over Rhonda while I was gone. 
Thank you to my family and friends for an amazing welcome home surprise party last Saturday at the Pizza and Pint Restaurant in Sylacauga. I appreciate the “Marble city fan club” and was overwhelmed by everyone there , I was humbled to have Nimblewill Nomad a true hiker legend attend as well. 
Thank you to the team at Mission Hospital Heart group in Asheville NC , you patched me up and I’m as good as new.
Thank you to Dr. Kim,the Florida Heart group and the Celebration Hospital Heart Rehab wing. I appreciate the heart rehab program that got me on the way to recovery.

It’s hard to believe it’s been a little over two years since my heart attack.
Thank you Joe and Mitch at LA Fitness in Orlando, you guys created a hiking machine ( slow and not so steady) but a hiking machine none the less. 
My hiking friends and I received so many blessings from Trail angels from all over , thank you so very much for your kind generosity !
Thank you Gary and Susan Eggers aka “The Traveling Eggs” for taking me on my initial shake down hike , I appreciate all of your knowledge and your ongoing active trail maintenance. Also thank you for delivering all the free Mountain house meals to Neels Gap , those chili macs are the best.

Jimmy and Sherry “I Believe “ Spillman you two are amazing and helped me all the way to Kathadin. Thank you helping me and countless of other hikers .I appreciate you allowing my bride to ride in your truck with you to keep her from driving to Pennsylvania alone to see me,and thank you Terry for giving me a lift to Knoxville and all of your trail magic. 
Mike Rich my best friend from the 6th grade, thank you and Tonja for giving me my first official Zero day in your lovely home. I needed that wonderful stay!
Herb and Resa Byrd thank you for rescuing Q, Sparky, Finishline and me at Newfound Gap and then spoiling me with a hotel stay and fine meals on that very cold weekend in March. I appreciate you checking on Rhonda as well. Love you dearly.
Ben Hayes “Snugs” Thank you for coming out to hike with me in NC , I especially appreciate you Kenya and the kiddos for watching over Rhonda back home and helping her many times with anything needed.I want to thank Jacque & Lonnie Jones. thank you for always being there for Rhonda and for the many prayers. You are like true family.
Jerry “Coach”and Kay Anderson thank you for letting us stay in your home and hiking with us for several days. Your hospitality and knowledge of the trail was fantastic! Thank you both for your friendship with my wife as well. I wish I could hike like Coach.


Gary “Stover” and Cathy Frechette  you two are amazing , thank you for taking in three strangers and adopting us for life, Southern Maine was tough and I don’t believe I would have made it without you. We had so much fun and are now connected for life. You’ve helped many over the years and I’m proud to be one of them.


David Martin “Iceman” Thank you for the rides and wonderful trail magic meals especially in the Wilderness. You are fantastic.


Fresh Grounds, thank you for the best skillet potatoes ever on a wet cold day in GA. You are a legend!
The Cookie man and group, thank you for your world famous cookies , they hit the spot.
Thank you Various churches, individuals and organizations for the random hiker feeds, cold drinks and snacks along the way.
Kirk Jordan and Yalla, thank you for taking us in to your lovely home in Vermont , that will always be a special memory.


Quiet John thank you for the support and ride near Lehigh Gap. It’s great to have friends like you nearby.


Millie Hayes, you are such a wonderful trail angel to many , breakfast was amazing on that rainy morning. I appreciate your friendship with my wife and I.


BMac thank you for looking out for us and camping with us . We appreciate all of the inside info on the trail your trail maintenance is much appreciated .


Tentman thank you for the “Darn Tuff “ socks. That is an over the top gift for so many of us. FYI darn tuff socks are over twenty dollars a pair and Tent Man gives away hundreds every year. 


Tom Little , Thank-you for surprising us in Maine and summiting Kathadin with us . We are also appreciate you taking us out to eat and the ride into Millinocket from Baxter . Truly a wonderful surprise. You are a strong climber!


Keith and Julie Carter, you two are super amazing flying all the way to Maine to surprise me. My hiking friends were excited to meet the famous bass fisherman I had told so many stories about. Thank you for buying our pre summit celebration dinner  for a hundred or so hikers. I look forward to hitting the lakes with you chasing the elusive bass soon.


Beaker thank you for your inspiration, after following you on Trail Journals in 2017 I knew I had to tackle this challenge, your journal kept me positive throughout my hospital stay during my incident in 2017 . I look forward to meeting you and comparing notes one day.
Lake Pointe Neighbors- Keith and Carol Jansen, Annette and Stephen Hrncir,  Eric and Elizabeth Semrau, Nelson and Selene Roque, Luis and Jenny Santiago, Jana, Mike and Rebecca Whitworth  Jen & Cliff Hall, Brad Houchen, John & Debra Lucuis, Norm Envall & the Williams family and so many more. You all are super amazing. I cannot thank you enough.
I want to thank all of my former co workers and clients you truly are more than that to me , I consider you my family.


I want to thank all of my church family at the Concord St Church of Christ in Orlando for all of your prayers and support. I look forward to seeing you soon! 


My beautiful amazing wife Rhonda, how can I begin to thank you for handling everything for over six months and being so supportive of my dream.You have taken care of your dad in and out of the hospital as well as others in our family handling more than imaginable.I’m sorry you had to bury our little adopted dog son Reagan by yourself. You truly are the most wonderful wife in the world. Thank you for the most support a wife could give in every way. I Love you more than I can express.


Finally and most importantly I thank God for giving me the strength,health and resolve to finish this journey. I spent a lot of time in prayer on my hike and I am so truly thankful and humbled .This country is so beautiful and we are all so very blessed and  just need to take a walk and open our eyes. May God continue to bless America.

Halo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625334,"September 6th 2019  I summited Katahdin. I started my trek Feb 18th 2019 by myself but met some of the most amazing people along the way and never really hiked alone at least not for a long period of time.  The not so distant memory is like a dream, did it really happen?

Truly there is a serious adjustment period trying to fit back in with the civilized world. 
 

I am so very happy to be with my family and on the same exact hand, I miss the mountains very much. I’ve seen articles on the net about post trail depression and I hesitate to use that description but I certainly understand the gist of what they mean. I would categorize what I’m experiencing into two buckets 1. Physical , its been a slow recovery period but four months later I’m still healing. My knees and feet are doing much better and I’ve gained much of my weight/upper body strength  back. I exercise and stretch daily. Surprisingly my hands hurt the most, I guess the death grip I kept on my trekking poles has turned into some type of permanent pain.  2. Emotional (mental) , I’m glad to report the nightly hiking dreams have ended . I do miss the routines and daily adventures and It’s not just missing the beauty and the clean air of the trail. I miss my trail family and all the friends I met out there. There is something immensely satisfying about accomplishing daily goals and surviving primitive challenges.

Its hard to explain but adversity can be good.

 

Any way I apologize for the late review on some of the gear that I used. 
Please note this review is based on my personal experience and if possible try out these products yourself prior to an extended hike. So much for my disclaimer, in no particular order here goes;

 

Trekking Poles-  Leki Micro Variable- 
https://www.leki.com/us/trekking/poles/3115/micro-vario-cor-tec-ta/?c=708 
Leki is a very customer oriented company and offer a lifetime warranty on their aluminum poles. I know as I broke one last year in 2018 and then on my thru hike in 2019. If you note on my summit picture I’m holding an odd pole as my last break happened on a fall in Maine right before summiting. Leki replaced the pairs both time no questions no problem. I love a company that understands the physical demands we put on their products! That being said note this style is collapsible and very compact, but understand that with months of rain and exterior living the little spring in the push button assembly can and will eventually corrode without proper lubrication. My poles prior to the break became un-collapsible and if you note my picture climbing out of Lehigh Gap which requires hand over hand climbing, my poles were extended out of my back pack like a radio operators antenna. This is extremely dangerous but unfortunately all I could do. My recommendation for a thru hike is to go with a standard twist or speed lock model or if you have this model try to lubricate your spring every chance you can.

 

Personal safety satellite communicator- https://explore.garmin.com/en-US/inreach/

Delorme (now Garmin) Inreach Explorer Obviously not necessary until it is necessary…… I did ultimately send it home somewhere in Upstate New York. It quit working properly and Garmin wanted another 200.00 bucks to replace it. Verizon cell service is pretty good on the AT so ultimately the satellite feature was not needed. The Inreach Explorer also requires a monthly subscription. Great peace of mind I’m glad I never truly needed it to send an SOS etc. 
 

Wallet- Zpacks- Dyneema wallet, This lightweight  wallet was great for my credit card, debit card, insurance card, drivers license, military id and cash ($200.00). I always carried it in my front zip -up pocket of my shorts or pants. 
https://zpacks.com/products/wallet-zip-pouch

 

Sock Liner- the five toe injinji liner , I believe these liners are the reason I did not get any blisters. If you recall I actually did get one blister in the Shenandoah’s but it was due to an ill fitted pair of shoes (Altra Temps). I carried an extra pair and did replace both pairs once after wearing a hole in them.  

https://www.injinji.com/shop/liner.html?fiber_flag=172&weight_flag=173

 

Socks- Darn Tough Crew, Smart Wool and Farm to Feet. I started off with two pairs of Darn Tough socks and one pair of Smart Wool. My initial thoughts were to have a warm dry pair to sleep in and two pairs to hike in. I eventually sent one pair home and preferred to let my feet air out at night. I even gave away my down booties as I did not need the additional warmth after February. These sock companies are all good however I did wear holes in both the Smart Wool and the Farm to Feet pair. Darn Tough offers a lifetime warranty and seriously after 2192 miles my DT are still going strong. Again I used my liner socks at all times hiking. 
https://darntough.com/

https://www.smartwool.com/shop/mens-wool-socks-

https://www.farmtofeet.com/

 

Down Booties- I did not know how cold I would be in my tent so I brought these in case. I eventually gave these away to a young lady at Hot Springs as I preferred not to wear socks to sleep in. They are superlight and warm and cheap. 
AEGISMAX Down Booties Down Socks Warm Soft Slippers Down Filled Slipper Boots Indoor Warm Down Slippers Plus Size for Men Black

Waterproof Socks- Seal Skinz, These WP socks performed extremely well but I only used them when it snowed. I realized early on that there is nothing short of waders that will keep your dry in the rain forests of the Appalachian trail. Again I sent these homes in March.

https://www.sealskinzusa.com/socks

 

Gaiters – Altra Trail Gaiters, perfect for keeping sand small rocks debris from falling into your shoes, note these work best with a Velcro gaiter trap already on Altras trail runners. I had to modify my Merrils and Solomons by gluing on a piece of Velcro to the back.

https://www.altrarunning.com/

 

Shoes- 1. Altras Lone peak 3.5, 2.  Altras Lone peak 4.0, 3. Altra Temps, 4.  Lone peak 3.5, 5. Oboz Sawtooth, 6. Salomons Speedcross, 7. Merrils Moab 2 Ventilator 
 

Altras are comfortable wide trail running shoes that are very popular with the thru hikers, I liked them however they seem to break down prematurely.

Generally speaking trail runners are supposed to last around 500 miles, The AT can be brutal on your shoes and the wet weather can speed up the wear and tear. The Altra Temps did not fit me well and I experienced one blister in the Shenandoah’s right before I got rid of this style. To be fair trail runners are not designed as a thru hiker shoe however the immediate failure I experienced would have happened whether I was thru hiking or not. Some hikers experience a need to get a larger shoe size after hiking many miles, personally I believe my feet got wider. Depending on your experience it would be wise to pre buy your shoes and have someone ship them to you when needed or you can risk not finding the brand,size and style that you may want.

 

 The Oboz was an excellent durable hiking shoe quite a bit heavier than my Altras. Oboz has an excellent warranty and I had a brand new pair waiting for me once I got off trail. The toe protector failed within 200 miles and they happily replaced them for me.

 https://obozfootwear.com/products/mens-sawtooth-ii-low

 

 The Salomons Speedcross are fine trail shoes with an aggressive sole but not very slip resistant on rocks. https://www.salomon.com/en-us/shop/product/speedcross-4.html#color=12554

 

 I ultimately traded the Salomons  in for the Merrils which have a Vibram sole and is probably the best sole for traction on wet rocks in my opinion. I was only 300 miles from the end but the Maine mountains were very slippery and I had come so far to have a major injury. A decision I do not regret!

 

 https://www.merrell.com/US/en/moab-2-ventilator-wide-width/

 

I did take some Crocks for camp/town/ shower  shoes. 
 

Insoles -I used the blue Good Feet insert  on most of my shoes, however the Oboz have a fantastic insert already in their shoes. I depended on local availability for my insoles and shoes as well.   https://www.amazon.com/Superfe...

 

Micro Spikes-  https://www.amazon.com/Uelfbaby-Crampons   Depending on when you start I would advise to bring a pair of micro-spikes for the ice. I really did not need them till the Smokies and then I used them only a couple of times. I sent mine back as soon as the weather started warming up of course.

 

Long Johns tops and bottoms- Icebreaker 200 series, I really like this brand as their products are warm but extremely light.

 https://www.icebreaker.com/en-us/mens-baselayers/merino-200-oasis-leggings/104369.html?dwvar_104369_color=001

 

Underwear and Tshirt – Exofficio boxer brief and black Tshirt, Icebreaker boxer brief and Tminus 33 black tshirt. I carried two pairs of underwear and ultimately my black Tshirts were my go to hiking shirt in the summer. Both brands performed well. Merino wool is soft and naturally odor bacteria resistant. Exofficio is a synthetic blend with odor resistant technology.

I would say both eventually smell bad at least for me they did.

https://www.exofficio.com

 

Long Sleeve Shirt- Shortly after I had mailed a lot my winter gear home we had an early spring snow. I bought a cheap lumberjack cotton flannel at a general store at Grayson Highlands and believe me cotton can save lives! I bought a long sleeve fishing shirt in Boiling Springs PA early June to keep the sun off my skin. I had started the hike in February with a longsleeve fishing shirt but somehow I misplaced it, shedding weight I suppose. There is a nice fishing outfitter in Boiling Springs and they had a lot of their merchandise marked down at the time. UPF protection is critical at times.

Pants- I dropped close to 30 lbs on my thru hike so I had to change out pants/sizes several times. I started out my hike wearing a pair of Fjall Raven Vida Pros hiking pants. https://www.backcountry.com/fjallraven-vidda-pro-pant-long-mens. Honestly I believe these trousers are a bit of an overkill. I envisioned sliding on rocks and navigating through thick brush more than it really happened. The fabric is rugged and unfortunately heavy.  
My second pair of pants were the Mountain Hardware  AP These pants were very comfortable and stretchy and I would highly recommend for any type hiking. Pantshttps://www.mountainhardwear.com/mens-hardwear-ap-pant. After dropping another waist size I went to Walmart and bought a pair of  wrangler hiking pants and not only were they inexpensive they worked extremely well, they are best for cool weather hiking as they do get warm.

Once the weather warmed I wore my Outdoor Research shorts exclusively.  https://www.outdoorresearch.com/us/mens-equinox-shorts-242916

Also I highly recommend a web style belt as you can cut it to fit as your waist size drops.

https://www.rei.com/b/bison-designs/c/belts

 

Fleece- Patagonia R2 performance fleece. I absolutely love this jacket. It served as a midlayer and combined with my puffy was extremely warm. It was too warm to hike in on most days and several hikers opted for the R1 which is a little lighter. I believe the waffle technology is polar tech? Anyway this performance fleece is worth every penny in my opinion. https://www.patagonia.com/product/mens-r2-techface-jacket/

 

Puffy- Arcteryx Cerium Down Jacket https://arcteryx.com/us/en/shop/mens/cerium-lt-hoody,

I kept my puffy jacket with me the entire trip. A lot of hikers wore the Mountain Hardware Ghost Whisperer which is even lighter at 7 ounces. Mainly I wore my Puffy at night at camp and early in the morning before hitting the trail. I recommend the hood for additional warmth. I highly recommend this jacket.

 

 

Sleep System- https://gearinstitute.com/gear-review/rei-igneo-19/   REI Igneo 19 degree Down Sleeping Bag, This was my Winter Bag and it is absolutely wonderful. It kept me warm at 7 degrees in Franklin NC. To be fair I need to include the Sea to Summit Reactor Extreme liner a very important part of my sleep kit, They claim it adds 25 degrees of comfort , I think that maybe an exaggeration but it certainly provides a warm addition . I want to say the popular trend on the trail are the lighter quilts and several of my hiking friends used them and had great results as well.

https://www.amazon.com/Sea-Summit-Reactor-Extreme-Thermolite/dp/B003BIT004/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&hvadid=78615135723978&hvbmt=bb&hvdev=c&hvqmt=b&keywords=sea+to+summit+thermolite+reactor+extreme+sleeping+bag+liner&qid=1576548501&sr=8-4

And finally my Therma Rest Neo Air Xlite sleep pad  https://www.thermarest.com/sleeping-pads/fast-and-light/neoair-xlite-sleeping-pad/neoair-xlite.html a pad that has an R rating is very important to help with insulating from the cold ground. In addition I carried a cheap space blanket from Walmart to use as a ground cloth in shelters.  https://www.walmart.com/ip/4-E...

 I traded out my winter sleep system for a lighter bag  Marmot Micron 50 and a silk liner once the weather warmed up early May. 
https://www.marmot.com/micron-50-sleeping-bag---long-39260.html

 

Shelter- I used a very lightweight Dyneema fabric two man tent; The Zpacks Duplex https://zpacks.com/products/duplex-tent . I bought this tent used* in fact it had previously made a thru-hike in 2018. Its one of the best if not the best lightweight hiking tent in the world. This tent does not have poles and utilizes your trekking poles so that makes it extra efficient and lighter weight. I would also recommend a two man size like the Duplex versus a solo tent for extra room and comfort. 
 

Backpack/Ruck Sack- I started with the Zpacks Arc Haul Zip

 https://zpacks.com/products/arc-haul-zip-backpack again I bought this pack used* however I had all of the straps replaced prior to my hike. Zpacks customer service is top notch and refused to charge me a penny for all of the replacements. Unfortunately after several days of continual rain my straps kept failing on the trail, I ultimately tied knots in the webbing and that rigged it till I could get it repaired. The problem with using a cottage company’s products is that on the trail nobody has the proper buckles straps etc to repair /replace  and unfortunately I was not in a position to send my pack back for repairs. I decided to purchase the Hyperlite WindRider 3400 backpack at a local outfitter in Damascus. 
https://www.hyperlitemountaingear.com/

 

The HL pack is a wonderful pack but not as comfortable to me as the ZPack. Note that I had several friends that successfully hiked with both of these brands. The only negative actually 2 negatives about this pack, one I bought the white color…. Ok you guessed it was not white for long. Second I was used to the load lifters and adjustment straps on the Zpacks which gave me a super comfortable fit and ride. The Zpacks has a replaceable belt which I mentioned I lost 30 lbs which meant a smaller belt adjustment is crucial in my opinion. Other than that I love my HL pack but know its limitations. Oh almost forgot NEITHER pack is waterproof so protect your clothes and sleep system with some type of pack liner, I used the HL pod system but compactor bags from Lowes will work fine.

 

RainGear-I feel like I almost died from Hypothermia in Franklin NC. I wound up purchasing new rain gear there. I was using an Alpine jacket not rain gear specific Marmott Exum Goretex ProShell Jacket and BassPro rain Pants.

 

https://www.summitpost.org/outdoor-gear/marmot-exum-jacket-pro-shell-2008/4876

 

Unfortunately it rained so much on me for the first 15 days of my hike that I don’t believe any raingear would have worked initially. I wound up buying the Arcteryx Traverse rain jacket and the North Face Venture rain pants. Although I never tried it , I saw a few hikers using umbrellas and if I had to do it over I would definitely give an umbrella a try! Everybody warned me to be careful starting in February, the weather can be brutal if not deadly. My new rain gear did work well but again I did not have the 15 straight days of rain like I did when I started. 
 

Cook System- I used the inexpensive BRS stove for the entire trip and it worked marvelously. Probably the best bargain out there! 
 

https://www.amazon.com/BRS-BRS-3000T-Ultra-Light-Titanium-Miniature

 

 

I used the Toaks 650ML Titanium pot to heat my water and this size worked well for me. Some carried 750 ML for greater capacity. I found the 650 size could store my fuel cannister, stove ,bic lighter and bandanna perfectly inside. I primarily did freezer bag cooking. I found a piece of reflective insulation early on and I used it as a windshield for my stove. After I would heat up my water I would pour it in the freezer bag with my Ramen etc and insert the bag into the Big Sky insulation bag to sit for a few minutes. Very effective with minimal cleaning. Not sure about long term health effects from eating out of freezer bags for 6 months….Proceed with caution. I stored my food in the ZPacks Bear bag and I hung my food bag religiously every night. I used a Sea to Summit titanium long Spork and that worked well. I carried the light weight Esee Izula fixed blade knife which ultimately I traded out for a smaller pocket knife. No need for a big knife on the trail, even though I love and collect knives.

Water- I carried a 1litre Smart water bottle and the smaller 24 oz bottle for my water containers. I would draw my water from springs, streams and sometimes gross beaver ponds .

A filtration system is a must have. I used the Sawyer Squeeze filtration system but preferred the CNOC water bag to collect my “dirty” water check out the links below, the way the bag opens is very fast and superior to the Sawyer bags.
