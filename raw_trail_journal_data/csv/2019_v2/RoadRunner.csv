RoadRunner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607076,"Hello friends!
In 2017 I completed a goal of running a marathon in every state. Since then I’ve been preparing for an attempt at hiking the entire Appalachian Trail (AT). Hikers trying to do this 2200 mile trail all at once are referred to as “thru-hikers”. Each year somewhere around four thousand insane hikers depart from Springer Mountain Georgia heading north (NOBO’s) to Mt. Katahdin in Maine. The average time it takes to complete this journey on foot is six months. The success rate is around 20 percent.
If your interested in more information about the “AT” here are a few links to get you started.

RoadRunner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607237,"So here’s my pre-hike plan on getting to Springer Mountain, Georgia. 
My wife (Sandi) and I will fly to Atlanta next Wednesday (February 27’th). Then pickup a rental car and drive up to Amicalola Falls State Park and Lodge. At the lodge we will meet up with several friends that will also start the Appalachian Trail (AT) hike on March 1’st. Sandi and I will stay at the lodge for two day/nights before the hike begins on Friday. Sandi will return home (San Antonio, Texas) soon after I start my hike.
I don’t think our starting group of five has made a final decision on whether or not we will hike the 8.8 mile AT Approach Trail. If we do we have talked about taking a ‘light pack’ on Thursday, doing the approach, then returning that night to the lodge. Then on Friday, driving up to Springer Mountain to the start.
My Trail Name will be: ROADRUNNER !!!
For anyone wondering what I’m talking about. I heard it all started on the AT - so many people were hiking that it was easier to keep people straight if they were called by a nickname specific to them. Most hikers feel that their trail name says something about their personality, or history, that their given name never could.
So after much thought, I have finally settled in on the trail name of RoadRunner. After generating a list of about 12 solid names and sharing them with friends and family, the majority really liked RoadRunner, and so do I.  For me, having been a runner / jogger for as long as I can remember, and running in more road races than I could even begin to count. From distances of 5K, 10K, half and full marathons. Including at least one full marathon in each of the 50 states plus the District of Columbia. On top of the 51 just mentioned I can add about 10 more duplicated states. So all in all I think RoadRunner will settle in nicely and fits my personality and history quite well.",,View Entry,"Feb 20, Wed",0
RoadRunner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607545,"(TH 2/28/19) Officially signed in today as a 2019 AT thru-hiker at Amacalola Falls State Park (register number 398). Tomorrow morning the journey begins. Will be packing about 40 pounds total (30 in pack, then plus 7 in food and 3 in water). Just purchased Guthook App to help me along my trek. Will be my final night at the lodge here with Sandi (wife).
(FRI 3/1/19) Starting out with poor internet service. I have Verizon which is supposed to be the best service on the trail so hopefully it gets better. May need to group together my journal entries like I’m doing now.
Dropped off at Springer Mountain parking lot. Hiked up to Springer Mountain with my starting buddies (1 mile) and then proceeded to hike to the Hawk Mountain Camping Area (7.4). All Day on and off rain. Sometimes heavy leading to a very muddy trail. Slipped and fell a couple times in the mud but nothing serious. Good hard first day. My four hike buddies that started with me today all have different paces - So I’m hoping we’re able to meet up again as much as possible. It would be awesome to end each day at the same shelter or camping area, but realistically that’s probably not going to happen. I talked with a few passing hikers and I think they are going to make this journey even more awesome than I even imagined. Yes! Awesome people out here on the trail.
(SAT 3/2/19) Great day weather wise. Mostly cloudy with the sun breaking through on occasions. Slept in until 8AM and did not leave the Hawk Mountain Camping Area until 10:30. One big climb of around 1000 feet was tough. Later the weight of my pack really started hurting my shoulder blades. Made it to Gooch Shelter, which was a little more than 8 miles today. Talked to a few guys I met, then set up my hammock and enjoyed a hot dinner. Quite tired so I tucked myself in around 7:15 pm.
(SUN 3/3/19) Left Gooch Shelter around 8:30 and hiked about 5 scenic miles to the Woody Gap/Hwy 60 GA crossroads near Suches GA where I was greeted by heavy rains, thunder and lightning. That was enough to help me decided to end my Sunday hike a little sooner than I wanted to. I had heard about a great hiker hostel in Suches so I called them (Barefoot Hills) and was picked up from the trail about 20 minutes later. There are six hikers staying here in a bunk house and two of them are my original hiker buddies! Looking forward to a hot shower and meal. Followed by a good nights rest out of the rain and a night off the trail.","Springer Mountain, GA
",Woody Gap,"Mar 03, Sun",21
RoadRunner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607679,"MON 3/4/19). I met David (BOOT) at the Barefoot Hills Lodge and we hiked from Woody Gap (elevation 3198) to Neal’s Gap (10.8 miles). This included hiking up to Blood Mountain (4461 elevation). Beautiful scenic trees covered in ice. A very chilly day but well dressed and while hiking very doable. Temps dropping into the teens tonight and tomorrow.
(TUE 3/5/19). Boot and I continued on today in the icy cold weather. We left Neal’s Gap and hiked to Hogpen Gap which was a 6.9 mile day. Once again beautiful scenery and great pics of the area. Making it well worth having to deal with the extreme cold.
(WED 3/6/19). Started out from Hogpen Gap with temps still in the teens. Wearing three layers of cloths so very doable. As we passed Low Gap Shelter I spotted Davy (RoweMer) hiking out. I met RoweMer on day one as we were both starting out at about the same time on March 1’st. He now lives in Colorado but grew up along the Appalachian Trail and is very knowledgeable. This is his 50’th year and his big “to-do” for the big 5-0 is a thru hike of the Appalachians. RoweMer joined us on our hike and shared many great stories of him and his families many hiking and camping adventures with his family. We hiked to Unicoi Gap which totaled 14.3 miles. My best mileage day so far.","Woody Gap
",Unicoi Gap,"Mar 06, Wed",30
RoadRunner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607828,"(TH 3/7/19). Chilly start in the mud. Temps started in the 20’s but warmed up into the 40’s and Sunny skies. The AT is famous for its constant climbs and descents. I can confirm these are facts! Wow! Can’t wait for me to build some trail legs. Boot and RoweMer hiking with me. Unicoli Gap to Dick’s Creek Gap (16 miles).
(FRI 3/8/19). More of the same. Many ups and downs. Elevations range from 3000 to 4500. Tough going on the big climbs. Dicks Creek Gap to Plumborchard Gap Shelter (6 miles).
(SAT 3/9/19). All day cold with on and off rain. Lots of muddy trails from all the recent rains. The grind is on! Plumborchard Gap Shelter to Standing Indian Shelter. Shelter full, hammock time with strong winds this night. Hope she holds through the night (12 miles).","Unicoi Gap
",Standing Indian Shelter,"Mar 09, Sat",34
RoadRunner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607864,"Standing Indian Shelter. My Saturday night/Sunday morning here was one I will never forget. Around 8:00 pm, as I was finally settled in my hammock, the sky’s above this bus mountain opened. Down came the rains, wind and lightning. My tarp above my hammock soon pulled free from the stakes, and the flapping began. My hammock is also encased with a rain cover but that too was now blowing out of control. So in the dark I quickly gathered the everything in sight, and ran towards the small three sided shelter that was already maxed out with six tired hikers. Of course the wind and rain was gushing in through the one side that was open. For the next eight hours I covered myself with my tarp and held on. By morning almost everything I had was soaked. I could not sleep fearing the rain hitting my tarp would freeze and soon I would too. In the morning I packed everything up and said to myself, just hike. Just hike. I met up with ‘Hey Mic’ (Charleston West Virginia) as he was stopped and we hiked together for about 8 miles. Now here’s an interesting fellow. He looks a lot like Woody Harrelson and his trail name comes from his movie called ‘Hey Mic’. He is doing the four US corners. He biked from San Diego to Jacksonville. This year he is doing the AT (GA to MA); next year he’s planning on biking from Portland Maine to Portland Oregon. And after that he plans to do the PCT Hike (California to Washington). After hiking with ‘Hey Mic’ I stopped at the Carter Gap Shelter. Boot was there, he had left the Standing Indian Shelter before me and was taking a break here. He asked me if I was ready to hike on but I told him I needed to stay here and began the process of hanging all my gear/cloths out to dry as the sun had made its way into the day. Boot was anxious to keep hiking as we are approaching Franklin, NC. A trail town with lots of hostels, hotels, restaurants and a couple of outfitters. So Boot was on his way to get another 8 miles in today.Later in the day, I was pleasantly surprised as Sara (Cushy Life/New Hampshire); Sandy (Sara’s cousin and professional cross country biker/Colorado); and Bob (Trigger/Louisville, Kentucky) arrived in the shelter. I had met them about a week earlier at a B&B in Georgia. Great group and I hope to hike with them in the days ahead.","Standing Indian Shelter
",Carters Gap,"Mar 10, Sun",8
RoadRunner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607937,"MON (3/11/19). Carters Gap Shelter to Wallace Gap). Around 8:00 AM I saw Spinner walking by the shelter area and she said she found a lost dog at the Privy. She said she was going to make sure he made it to a safe place. Her cousin Sara was already on Instagram and calling a friend in Franklin to see if anyone could help. It turns out the nearest road is about 6 miles down the AT and it’s a restricted forestry road. Sara worked out the logistics that if we could get the dog to the road, an officer from the local Animal Shelter would meet us there to take him to their shelter. So off we went, the four of us, and a very tired and starving dog somebody (I think Sara) named Bozo. He looked to me to be hunting dog, some kind of hound dog. Around 25-30 pounds but definitely lighter than he should be. I was sizing him up in case I would need to carry him. He started out for the first two miles with a good pace. Then his pace began to taper off and he started limping (right front foot/joint) and slowed. He was drinking lots of water at every water crossing (natural springs crossing the trail about every mile or so). Once when he stopped to pee I though his urine was too dark and I was worried it could be blood. We were also stopping to feed him a few bites of our trail food every 1/2 mile or so. As soon as anyone reached into a pocket he was hoping you were pulling out food. He would gobble whatever you gave him in a millisecond. You could tell he had been food less as his bones were visible. He was strong and doing his best to continue. You could also tell he trusted us. Occasionally, I would have to help him over large rocks or steep climbs/drops. Spinner had made a make shift leash and he had a collar but no tags. Finally, we reached the road and almost immediately, we spotted the Animal Shelter truck. Sara ran to flag him down and he stopped. The officer said he looked like a Walker Hound. He said someone had posted pictures around town last fall that he thought looked like him. The officer searched Bozo for a ID chip but there was none. He then put him in one of his truck cages and said a vet would see him today. He would have a warm shelter, food and water tonight. I hope he will be OK.  The officer said he was probably someone’s hunting dog that got lost in the woods on a hunt. I thought about the night before, the big stormy night that scared the wits out of me. How did Bozo fare that night? Lost and alone. What was his story? Certainly I had nothing on a difficulty scale to compare to his. Finally, Bozo was rescued! I hope his owner or someone nice will adopt him soon.  
After the exciting morning we hiked on about another 8 miles. Then caught a shuttle into town (Franklin, NC). We would all be resting in a hotel this night and a trip to nearby restaurant for dinner.","Carters Gap
",Wallace Gap,"Mar 11, Mon",14
RoadRunner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608092,"TUE 3/12/19. Waking up in a warm hotel bed, followed closely by a hot shower and continental breakfast! Life is good in Franklin, NC on this morning. That was followed by checking out and shuttling to the downtown Outfitters 76 Store on Main Street. This is a really popular store for trail hikers. They have a good selection of gear and are super nice and helpful. While there I bought a new tent (Big Agnes) and a insulated sleeping pad. There will be no more storms in a hammock. Also ran into three outer hikers that I have seen and spent time with on the trail.
There were five of us that went into the restaurant Martha’s Kitchen to have lunch. Our shuttle driver said they had great food, and he was right. When we asked for our bills our waitress said that everything was already paid for. Yes, that’s Trail magic! Now for those that don’t know what trail magic is, people that live along the AT have been provided free services to thru-hikers for many many years. You never know when it’s coming. Generally your hiking along and you might come close to a road crossing, and someone has set up a table with food and refreshments. That’s just one example. So with today’s magic lunch, our waitress said that one of their regular customers sometimes drops an extra $100 above his bill, and tells the manager to use it to pay for the dinners of the next few incoming hiker meals. Pretty cool stuff right there! We all took the bill that said paid, turned it over and each of us thanked the person for his/her kind jester.
Spinner and I needed to sent a few things home . We left the restaurant and started walking when a man with an AT shirt was getting into his car and asked us if we needed a ride. We said yes so we got into his car and drove to the USPS. He said he hiked 200 miles of the AT when he was 66 years old (trail name Intense). On his hike (22 years ago) he loved his visit to Franklin. Said when he got home to Cleveland he told his wife they were moving to Franklin, NC. Intense said he also lived in Nashville for several years as a country music song writer. Said he liked Nashville but he couldn’t write enough songs to make a living.
Around 3:00 pm, after almost a 24 hour stay in Franklin. Sara, Spinner, Trigger and I headed back to the trail. We were shuttled back to the spot we got off (Wallace Gap) and then hiked about 5 miles to the Moore Creek CampIng Area. A very pleasant camping area, with a water stream beside us. We all set up our tents, hammock, hung our food, and called it a day.
WED 3/13/19. Left Moore Creek around 8:30 am, arrived at Wayah Gap (Mile 115) around 11:30. During our hike we took a slight off trail adventure up to Siver Bald. It’s a steep climb up to about 5200 feet but when you get there, you can see all the slightly lower mountain tops all the way around you (360 degrees). Once we returned to the trail, we only had about 2 more miles to reach our next pick up spot (another light, 5 mile day). After arriving we waited briefly for our B&B shuttle to take us to the Nantanala Mountain Lodge where we will be shuttled back and forth to the trail and lodge the next couple days. Steve and his wife Maggie are from England but long time U.S. citizens too. A great couple that owns the lodge and cater to hikers. Steve hiked the AT in 2010 and had many great stores and tips.
THUR 3/14/19. After a bagel and yogurt we left the lodge and headed back to Wayah Gap. Steve, the owner of the lodge was driving and he always has a few stories to tell. As we say in Texas, the guy is a real Hoot! He was a green beret and you quickly realize his high intellect of world events. When he dropped us off, rain was light with mild temperatures and high humidity. I wore my rain pants and jacket. There were three significant climbs of around 1000 feet each which means lots of sweating under my rain suit. Rain was steady but light most of the day. With about five miles to go, as we arrive at Burningtown Gap, the Crawford family was out giving trail magic! I had a corn dog and lots of fresh fruit. The Crawford’s are a young family of 8 that finished the AT last year. Their trail name was “the family”. I also got to hold a miniature Australian Shepherd that was running around silly. Too cute. Have I said yet how much I miss my four dogs? 
On the day, Sara, Trigger, Spinner and I hiked almost 14 miles to Tellico Gap. Maggie was there when we arrived to take us back to the lodge. When we arrived I met two new hikers that had checked into earlier in the day. Leah (trail name Wednesday) from Olathe Kansas (where the Garmin Company Headquarters is located/I ran a marathon in Olathe several years ago) and Papa Smurf from North Carolina. Both great friendly hikers I hope to get to know better.Day 14 on the AT ... ","Wallace Gap
