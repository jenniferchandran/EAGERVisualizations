Passed Mohican Outdoor Center with night approaching. Stopped at overlook with view of fog. Set up tent in rain and tried to dry off. Good to be out. Getting wet is part of it.","Delaware Water Gap

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624757,"Rain stopped around 6 and fog rolled off. Despite a long night I hit snooze and didn't leave camp until after 8:30. Fall colors were visible. Good views from top of Kittatinny with a rockpile and Rattlesnake Mountain, among other open ridgetops with 360 views. One had a firetower. Following Kittatinny's ridgeline for about forty-five miles. 
Feet eventually dried out. Stopped in Culver's Gap for late lunch at Gyp's Tavern lakeside on rear patio. Big burger. Phone not charging from spare battery so had to wait a while to get a charge from the outlet. Motorcyclist couple shared beers next to the lake.
Meant to grab dinner to go from Appalachian Trail Deli on way back to trail but it was already closed by 4. No matter. I don't have the hiker hunger and I need to eat what's in my bag.
Passed a handful of hikers, mostly out for the day, but no conversations. A large Outward Bound group from Newark stepped aside for me. The leader wanted to know my name and story, but the kids seemed more interested in their own conversations.
A few miles to the Gren Andersen shelter. Stopped at a firetower to dry out the tent in the breeze and waning sun that had recently appeared for the first time. An ATV drove back and forth on the access road while I waited.
Gren Andersen was quiet and dark. Standing spring water came out clear. Near the road to Sunrise Mountain. Could probably drive in to camp there. Acorns bounced off the roof all night, but I slept well anyway. Colder than last night.","Stealth site near 1307

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624758,"Not too chilly this morning. I expected to be alone this time of year but I miss the social aspect of the AT. I've seen some local walkers and a handful of weekend backpackers but no section hikers.
Mashipacong shelter had a large water stash in the bear box. Water's been scarce and low quality in NJ. My first fill-up was yellow. Tastes okay, but I took advantage of the bottled water at Mashipacong, and later the faucet at High Point State Park. 
The park monument, a 220-foot obelisk, was closed during the week, but I made the side trip to New Jersey's highest point anyway. The wind whipped up and rain drops started falling. I threw on the poncho but it never amounted to anything. Just ended up getting plastic blown in my face. 
Heading towards Unionville I passed a gregarious sixtyish dayhiker from Michigan working on mile 400 of his AT. Later met a middle-aged lady section hiking south to Mohican Outdoor Center named Susan. She told me about the Secret Shelter up ahead where I'd meet a donkey named Jake. I confused her reference to a swamp with a pond and never did find it.
But I had a more important objective: late lunch in Unionville. Annabelle's delivered in the form of a chicken parm sandwich and huge slice of pizza. After twenty miles I felt I deserved it. But I left feeling sluggish, despite idling over an hour to let my phone charge. 
A young southbound flip-flopper named Mississippi (his home state) stopped in and inhaled a large slice before taking off with two more to make the eight miles to High Point shelter before dark. Before he left I found out he started in Georgia in May, flipped from Harper's Ferry up to Katahdin in late August, and expects to finish late this month. On my way out of town I ran across him again heading south. He'd come into town from the north and left the same way so as not to miss any blazes. Man after my own heart.
Although, on my trips since completing the AT I've not been a purist. From small things like leaving a viewpoint or shelter from the most convenient exit rather than the one I entered, to larger ones like walking several miles on Skyline Drive in Shenandoah to save a few minutes late one evening trying to catch my friends, I've decided that after passing every white blaze once, now just roughly following the path is fine. Especially if I take some alternate trail and see some things I didn't before. Today I walked into Unionville from the west and left from the south. And I didn't bat an eyelash.
Wallkill Preserve was beautiful with the dried grasses surrounding ponds filled with geese and crane in front of the autumn-speckled mountains. Passed a family with two young kids biking on the level grassy paths. 
On the other side I stopped for water at an abandoned house near the bottom of Pochuck Mountain. Rain seemed to threaten but it held off as I climbed to the shelter. Three people were already there. An older pair of hikers Flipper and Speedo from South Florida were finishing dinner. They've been section-hiking for fifteen years and covered everything to the south. An Asian-looking girl named Crafty and her Chihuahua Macon were in a small tent in the shelter. The dog looked more like a miniature retriever. Crafty is rehiking the Mid-Atlantic section southbound and is not interested in hiking the whole trail.
All three turned out to be snorers so I put my earplugs to good use for the first time in many hundreds of miles. The Chihuahua got up every hour or so to spin around and remake its bed with a loud scratching sound.","Gren Andersen Shelter
",Pochuck Mountain Shelter,"Oct 09, Wed",25.40
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624759,"Another dark start to the day. Light doesn't come til almost seven this time of year. I skipped a hot breakfast thinking I would get something at the food stands on route 94 six miles away. Said goodbye to Crafty, Flipper, and Speedo.
The trail bounced up and down over rocky Pochuck Mountain before descending into a beautiful wetland over boardwalks and bog bridges for several miles. The fall colors as a backdrop to the brown rushes and pussywillows made for dramatic views. Early on I scared up a flock of pheasants. Later I passed a pond and watched over a dozen turtles scurry into the water at my approach from their sunning rocks. 
Heavenly Hill Farm store is a big fall festival destination. I grabbed some apple cider donuts while the phone charged and watched busloads of school kids unload into this wonderland of rides and farm-themed attractions.
Stairway to Heaven was next, a 900-foot rocky climb. Last time I did this I raced up, trying to keep ahead of hordes of dayhikers. Today it was practically deserted and I took a more leisurely pace. This may be the largest climb between central Virginia and Mt. Greylock in northern Massachusetts. It's long but not particularly hard.
After passing through Wawayanda State Park the trail headed up into a series of ledges and crossed into New York. It was up and down constantly and wore on me quickly. I struggled to keep a positive attitude despite the ideal weather. Great views of Greenwood Lake helped. As the evening approached I ran across a woman thruhiker from Asheville named So Far So Good refueling with snacks. I was looking forward to the Bellvale Farms ice cream store at the road but she said it was only open weekends in the fall. Crestfallen, but I half-expected that. 
After directing a couple of German dayhikers to the nearest view, and hoping they'd make it down before dark, I hit the road and walked over to the ice cream store in hopes of at least getting water. There's no water at the next shelter I was told. To my surprise the place was actually open! So in addition to water I recharged the phone and recharged my body with a milkshake.
The last two miles to Wildcat Shelter went over a couple more ledges but were more manageable. So Far So Good was already at the shelter, having skipped the store. I gave her the spare bag of water I'd filled up. She is filling in the last gap from her thruhike this year. She just summited Katahdin last week and is covering the same section I am. Another older woman named Fancy Free is in the shelter. She thruhiked in '96, section-hiked the trail over the next fifteen years, and now is working on a third time. Former owner of Hikers Welcome hostel in Glencliff, New Hampshire, she now shuttles hikers in Vermont and is fighting off stage 4 cancer.","Pochuck Mountain Shelter
",Wildcat Shelter,"Oct 10, Thu",23.60
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624760,"24 miles shelter-to-shelter over some gnarly terrain. It was a wearisome day. This section knocked me out last time between the humidity and the constant ups and downs, rocks and ledges. Not much humidity today. In fact, a fresh wind blew most of the day, but the leaves that covered the rocks and threatened to slide away underfoot made up for it.
Trying to keep a positive attitude was difficult, so I tried to keep my mind on other things. Saw almost no one after leaving the shelter, except for speeding cars crossing the Orange Turnpike, route 17, I-87, and the Palisades Parkway. At one point a grey deer looked up as I came up the trail but didn't run. Instead it just watched to see if I kept moving along the trail, no doubt ready to flee if I stopped or veered off. 
As afternoon wore into evening I flipped on the headlamp to finish the climb up West Mountain. I'm not a fan of night hiking and after nearly losing the trail in the dark I remembered why. It took far longer than it seemed it should have from my pace to reach the summit. At the summit the side trail to the shelter was another six-tenths of a mile in the dark over boulders, ledges, and many twists and turns. But it was worth it to find the shelter, which overlooks Manhattan in all its nighttime glory. A young couple were already there, having hiked up for the night. 
I'd stopped at Lake Tiorati for a soda and snack from the vending machines but I had never had lunch so I ate a good bit of ramen, tuna, cheese, and salami before crawling under the quilt.","Wildcat Shelter
",West Mountain Shelter,"Oct 11, Fri",22.80
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624761,"Out early. The couple was still asleep. There's a tent I didn't see last night holding another pair. Plenty of tentsites in fact that I had no idea were there in the dark. I followed the blue blazes out but they took me to a point a few dozen yards further up the AT, what seemed a much shorter exit than last night's prolonged entry.
Bear Mountain is an icon in the Hudson Valley. It's only 1300 feet elevation but the trail takes four miles to cross it and drops 1100 feet on the north side down to Hessian Lake. Thousands of rock stairs, walls, and pavers are cut and carefully laid along the trail like I'm walking through Rockefeller's manicured gardens. Tens of thousands of man-hours are on display here. The local trail conference calls it a ""model"" for how trails should be built. There isn't enough money on Earth to build the entire AT this way! Never mind all those stairs are harder on the knees than simple dirt, roots, and rocks.
At the summit Bear Mountain tower was open. It's a memorial to the JP Morgan banker named Perkins who founded Palisades Interstate Park as a respite for the urban crowds. And crowds there were on this fine fall Saturday. Lots of cars, lots of dayhikers. Some asking about my pack. After descending the mountain I stopped at the historic Bear Mountain Inn for a hot dog. The trail then meandered through the nearby Trailside Zoo where one can see red fox, bobcat, black bears, and coyotes. Except for bears I've seen none of these on the actual trail! They are all too shy and too nocturnal. 
Across the bridge over the Hudson I followed the crowds up to a mountain called Anthony's Nose which commands a view of the river valley for many miles. The wide ledges were covered with hikers of all ages lunching, snapping photos, and lounging. Hundreds of people. If I'd come yesterday I may have had the place to myself like most of the summits this week. I imagine High Point in New Jersey was similarly inundated.
Time to keep on trucking to route 9. The terrain was occasionally rocky and there were still some steep ledge climbs and descents, but I must have been acclimated by now. It didn't feel difficult. The fall colors were even sharper today. Must be near peak. Leaves covered the trail. It was hard to discern the path and I had to watch carefully for the blazes. I tripped often on hidden rocks. The temperature was perfect. 
One of the many historical markers in the Bear Mountain area pointed out that the Delaware Water Gap to Hudson River section, the exact section I've just done, was the first piece of the AT to be opened in 1923. Just two years after Benton McKaye's article envisioning a 2000 mile long mountain path appeared.
Interestingly, the Bear Mountain Bridge over the Hudson was completed in 1924. None of the markers say what hikers did when they reached the river for the first year of the AT. Probably took a ferry. But I picture them walking up to the bank, shrugging their shoulders, waving over at the trail builders on the opposite bank, turning around, and walking back the way they came.
At route 9 is the Appalachian Deli, a convenience store. The end of my section. A few miles down the road is Peekskill and a Metro North station on the Hudson line to Manhattan. Two older Massachusetts woman at a picnic table out front had just finished a short section and were waiting on a taxi to take them to their car. They've done Massachusetts down to here over many short trips. 
After eating a breakfast sandwich I'd been craving I tried to hitch to the metro station. Hitching's illegal in New York so I was self-conscious. It was a good spot though. This road goes almost directly to the station. It was my lucky day: the second car stopped! The driver was a young Indian guy working on a mechanical engineering degree. He was due at his girlfriend's, as an urgent phone call revealed, so it was especially kind of him to stop for me. 
From there it was just a 90-minute train to Grand Central, a twenty minute walk across Midtown through hordes of fall weekend tourists and theater goers, a 90-minute bus ride from the Port Authority Bus Terminal to Delaware Water Gap, another twenty minute walk to my car, this time through a dark, deserted village, and a two hour drive home. Simple as that.","West Mountain Shelter
","Rt 9, Peekskill","Oct 12, Sat",12.80
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624813,"Started a section from Front Royal to Carlisle, about 160 miles. Forecast calls for cold nights as low as 20 degrees, a bit cold for mid-November in the mid-Atlantic. 
I left my home in the Philly suburbs around 9, drove to Enterprise in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and drove a rental down to Enterprise in Front Royal, Virginia. This method is cheaper, faster, and of course much more convenient than trains and busses or even a long-distance shuttle. Enterprise charges a drop fee based on distance from the pickup location, in addition to one day's rental fee. Since it was reserved last minute I got what was left - a Grand Caravan minivan. They didn't want to rent it once they saw it hadn't been cleaned, but I didn't care. I only needed it for two hours. 
One of the girls in the Front Royal office shuttled me the five miles out to the trailhead on route 522 south of town. She moved from West Virginia a few years ago to be closer to her husband's job in Manassas and to better medical care. She told me that once her friends went out hiking the ""three state challenge"", which I had never heard of, and after a few weeks called her to say they'd been tenting in Front Royal for several days under a bridge, low on food and money. Seemed like this helped her form her image of long-distance hiking.
It was a gorgeous day, clear, sunny, in the mid 60s. Possibly the best day until next spring. Once I started hiking, with long pants on, I felt hot. The trail was fairly easy, with gentle climbs and relatively few rocks. The leaves have been crushed down more than last month when I hiked New Jersey and New York, making the rocks easier to spot. Two or three pairs of backpackers passed going in the opposite direction. I spied a tent at the Jim and Molly Denton Shelter as I passed around 4, but no activity in the shelter. Several walkers were also out with dogs. One older gentleman queried me and, upon finding out my destination was 160 miles away, said he would never make it. He too seemed to think long-distance hiking was a game for fools and young men (but I repeat myself). To prove the point, I soon passed a couple of not-quite-fit-looking young guys studying a fifteen-foot rock face they intended to scale, with a couple of cushioned pads on the ground in case they made a mistake.
The sun set around 5, but I still had two miles to go. Eventually I had to pull out a headlamp to find Manassas Gap Shelter. I reached the empty shelter, exploded my pack, and cooked some ramen and tuna. A full moon was rising, and soon it gave more light than my dinky ePetzl headlamp. It was cool but not so cold I wanted to retreat into my quilt, so I gathered sticks and dried grass and made a fire. It crackled happily for a half hour or so, drying out my hiking shirt, but I could find no decent fuel after the kindling burned to coals so I let it die out and went to bed.","Rt 522, Front Royal
",Manassas Gap Shelter,"Nov 11, Mon",10.70
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624814,"Chilly morning. Rain pounded the shelter roof in the early morning hours, giving way to a gusting wind as the sun rose behind the clouds. It was not too cold - close to 40 degrees - but I was reluctant to move quickly. Finally by eight I'd had hot oatmeal and tea and packed up. Left with barely any water, planning to fill up at the next spring. The pack was pleasantly light.
The wind whipped all day, and the temperature actually dropped as a cold front pushed in. I wore a fleece and rainjacket to keep off the chill, despite the body heat generated from hiking 23 miles. Gloves and windproof glove liners kept my fingers from freezing. 
Hiking was generally pleasant, with occasional steep climbs and descents, especially in the afternoon as I negotiated the first ten summits of the Roller Coaster. The last few miles into Bears Den became rocky and the inclines wore me down. I stumbled and slipped on leaves as the trail seemed less trafficked here. Water was plentiful all day, and some streams had cheerful little waterfalls.
Passed a handful of backpackers, all southbound. Haven't seen another northbounder yet. No great views, but with the trees mostly bare I could see distant blue hills on and off, and the contours of the hills I had just climbed and those that lay ahead.
I passed Rod Hollow Shelter, where I'd surprised UNICEF back in May for an impromptu road trip to Devil's Backbone Brewery. I've now hiked the four miles south of Rod Hollow four times.
As afternoon wore on I wished I'd stopped for lunch. The snacks hadn't kept up my energy. I trudged up the last 500-foot climb to Bears Den Rocks and found the hostel. Forecast called for a 20 degree night and I felt no desire to test my gear. The combo lock called for entering the precise distance from Manassas Gap, so only real hikers could get in. 
Inside was a section hiker from Texas going by Ursus. He started in Harrisburg and is headed south to McAfee Knob. He took a zero to beat the cold tonight. After a frozen pizza, a few sodas, a warm fire, a comfy chair, and a warm-ish shower the bitter chill of the day wore off. We kicked back while the laundry ran to watch orcs battle hobbits in The Return of the King.","Manassas Gap Shelter
",Bears Den Hostel,"Nov 12, Tue",22.80
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624839,"So warm and cozy in Bears Den Hostel I slept in a bit, not waking til nearly seven. Our host had put out pancake mix for us so I whipped up a batch and went to town. A woman searching for coffee was from Ohio and staying in a private room here with a friend while they are visiting her son. Yesterday they took Ursus out to breakfast, and later brought him back some Chick-fil-A. Lucky guy!
Goodbye to Ursus and out into the cold. It was 21 degrees and I had four layers on: hiking shirt, fleece, puffy, and rainjacket. The last was crucial as the wind was still gusting from time to time. I paused to take in the view from Bears Den Rocks of an autumn palette brushed across the hills. And a divided highway snaking through it.
The day was largely uneventful. It gradually warmed up to 31. Where the sun was shining and the wind was calm it was actually quite nice. I even stripped down to my T-shirt at an overlook when I was overheated, and put only the rainjacket back on. It was all I needed until evening. 
The trail had some climbs but nothing serious. The last few miles of The Roller Coaster were barely noticeable. Lots of rocks and leaves called for careful footwork, and that slowed me down a bit. There were regular overlooks offering views over the Shenandoah valley. Far to the south I could see the Shenandoah range rising above Front Royal.
I remember passing only a handful of dayhikers. The last pair as I was starting the descent into Harper's Ferry in late afternoon was a middle-aged husband urging on his reluctant wife, who despite looking fit seemed to think she wasn't cut out for climbing hills. The man sounded like he was ready to tent up on the mountain if his wife would put up with it. ""You've got too much energy for having hiked all day"" she remarked. ""But I'm headed into town,"" I smiled.
I crossed Snickers Gap early on and Keys Gap in mid-afternoon. No one around at either. The trail followed the West Virginia border for about fifteen miles before finally leaving Virginia for good. I paused at Keys Gap, the last road crossing, considering making a quarter mile side trip to a country store. But I wasn't hungry - pancakes and snacks had kept me going today - and it was far too cold to need a cold drink, so I kept going.
The sun was low in the sky bathing the Shenandoah River with golden rays as I crossed the bridge into town. I calculated this was my eighth time in Harper's Ferry since I started hiking. Probably my most visited point on the AT. 
I passed Jefferson's Rock, where the future president stood in awe of the juncture with the ""Patowmac"" River and declared its sight worth a trip across the Atlantic. It glowed in the setting sun as I watched the rivers collide in the distance.
The trail wound down into the historic Lower Town, which was absolutely devoid of life. Nearly everything was closed. The tourist season was clearly long over. I found the Town's Inn on High Street, which has a hostel. But no one was home. I'd called last night to reserve a bunk, but the owner wouldn't take a reservation. She was waiting until morning in case someone called to reserve the whole building. Well, surprise, that didn't happen on a Wednesday in November, but no one was answering the land or cell phones so I assumed she had decided to close down for the night. I called around to other places with no luck. The Teahorse Hostel's number was reluctantly answered by a woman who said they only took groups this time of year. After remarking on the cold night and asking if she knew anywhere that was open she wouldn't take the hint. She recommended the hostel I was presently shut out of, then gave me the name of an ATC committee member with a room for rent, but whose phone number she'd lost, then remembered there was a Quality Inn over by the bridge I'd come in on. 
Oh well, I reluctantly decided the motel was my best bet. Otherwise it would be a very pricey B&B room somewhere and even that was no guarantee this time of year. But just then a minivan pulled up on the street below and a woman dropped off some shopping bags. I hailed her from the second floor balcony where the public entrance was and asked about a bed. ""Of course you can have a bed! I'll be right back."" She drove off, leaving me to wonder whether her sense of time and mine were the same, as it was increasingly cold. But true to her word she returned shortly after parking the car in some hidden location off the narrow cobblestone street and showed me to an exposed stone room with several beds and several electric heaters with merry fake fires flickering. Ah, perfect!
After grabbing a reuben at the pub across the street, one of two businesses still open at 5 on Wednesday, I settled in for the night, curled up on a cot next to a fake fire and warming up my sleeping clothes before pulling them on. It was going to be another 20 degree night, so I was quite happy to be here, and not there.","Bears Den Hostel
",Harper's Ferry,"Nov 13, Wed",20.50
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624882,"The Town's Inn is very quaint. Part of its charm is the original wood floors that serve as the ceiling to the room below. So when my host rose and started moving around upstairs around 4:30 I woke up as well.
Eventually I pulled myself out from under the warm covers and got ready for the day. The owner made me an egg sandwich in her cafe upstairs. She seems like a nice woman, very religious, but also very distracted. In addition to the odd response when I called ahead to reserve, and the no response when I showed up last night, when I finally did get to check in last night she took my cash but gave me the registration slip and told me not to give it to her until morning. Now when I handed it to her she couldn't remember if I'd paid her. She's been running the place since 2007 though so I guess she has managed to keep things afloat.
There's an AT passport stamp here. There's almost no room left in my passport. It's full of stamps from hostels, motels, parks, and hiker services from Georgia to Maine. I can remember every one.
I stepped out into town hesitantly, bracing myself for the cold. My thermometer said 30 but the forecast and my fingers said colder. I was bundled up for the walk through town, deserted but for the train station sending commuters to Washington. The sun rose over the merged Potomac and highlighted the water as it danced over the bedrock protruding from the river bottom. The first few miles were along the Chesapeake & Ohio canal towpath, a 185-mile bike/hike trail from Cumberland Gap to Washington. I passed an occasional walker or runner. 
Once I started climbing Weverton Cliffs there was no one in sight. I had the view over the river all to myself. From there it was a relatively level walk along ridges, past shallow gaps, and through history. 
Many skirmishes occurred along South Mountain, which the trail follows through Maryland, in the run up to Antietam in September 1862. The Union armies successfully drove the Confederates out of the passes, allowing the army to converge on Sharpsburg to the west where Lee""s invading force had assembled. 
In addition I passed the unique War Correspondents Monument, and later the first Washington Monument, built by the citizens of nearby Boonesboro. From the top of the latter I could see the sweep of the Great Valley separating the Blue Ridge on which I stood from the ridge and valley section of the Appalachians. On the southern horizon I could still see Shenandoah looming high above the valley.
Near Gathland Park in the south I passed two backpackers ten or twenty years my seniors who looked to have enjoyed their trip but happy to be ending it in a few miles in Harper's. Later I was surprised to encounter two southbound thruhikers. Puff the Magic Dragon and Sidewinder had started on June 22nd from Katahdin. Puff said she was getting off soon for winter but returning in spring to finish up. Sidewinder intended to keep walking until he reached Springer sometime in January by his calculation. A young, slim guy with a wispy blonde beard, he was upbeat and hopeful about the weather ahead. Puff thought they would be the last SOBOs to come through this year. Two years ago in April I met a different extreme: the first NOBO. He had started on January 1st in Georgia and my daughter and I met him in Gathland Park at a trail magic setup. He was a red-faced, bearded, wild-haired, chubby boy sporting an external frame backpack with all manner of cookwear and other tools hanging from it. He said it weighed 70 pounds. I remember his smile. He looked like he smiled all the time. He was having the best time of his life, despite the bitter cold he'd hiked through for three months.
The temperature seemed to drop quickly as the sun fell in the late afternoon. I feared it would be colder tonight than the 28 forecasted. I made it to Annapolis Rocks campsite as the fiery sky blazed out in the west. In high season a caretaker lives here, but this time of year his tent pad sat empty, the site deserted. Since the caretaker site was the only one with a picnic table I claimed it for the night. 
Water took forever to boil, despite little wind. Perhaps the stove is inefficient near freezing. I juggled cooking and tent setup on the pad. Fortunately no wind was forecast for I had only rocks to hold the tent in place. After ramen, a cheese and bacon tortilla, chocolate, and tea, I retired to the tent before 7. The water filter, phone, and charger all went in the sleeping bag to prevent freezing. The water bottles should be alright if it stays in the upper 20s.","Harper's Ferry
",Annapolis Rocks,"Nov 14, Thu",24.50
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624926,"It felt colder this morning than I remember it being in a long time. That seemed mostly perception, thanks to the unseasonably cold week and that I am not yet used to winter temps. Inside the tent it was just above freezing. I slept with the water filter and electronics just in case. It's supposed to be a little colder tonight and much colder tomorrow night. I'm planning to stay at a hostel in Fayetteville that night. My sleeping system is comfortable to about freezing. The ultralight quilt that seemed like such a flexible item does not close up tightly, so my main weakness is drafts. Only my bag liner and a piece of reflectix placed under the sleeping pad make sub-freezing temps tolerable.
I have a couple easy days to get to Fayetteville so I decided to drop into Smithsburg for a late breakfast. I reached Wolfsville Rd after six and a half miles of leafy ridge walking. It was two miles to town but the hitching situation seemed poor. Nowhere to turn off and traffic was light. So I walked. Downhill was fast and I covered the distance in 30 minutes to get to Dixie's Diner in the center of town. It was busy but the harried waitress took care of everyone. Had a huge omelette while the phone charged. Then back to the trail. Hitching out is always tough because most people aren't going your way. By the time I reached the road to the ridge there was little traffic and again nowhere to pull off. It took 40 minutes to walk back uphill.
The miles to Pennsylvania were mostly unremarkable. The trail became much rockier after crossing Little Antietam Creek. First Raven Rocks then High Rocks and then just rocks and more rocks. Who says Pennsylvania has all the rocks?
At the road by the creek I met a southbound flip-flopper named Kingfish. He's got 200 miles left til he finishes in Rockfish Gap at the south end of Shenandoah. The early cold spell got him good in Pennsylvania. So much so he started carrying a second sleeping bag. He had slackpacked today thanks to a friend and was waiting to be picked up. But he pulled a calf muscle early on and had to hike through it all day. He cut short his day by more than ten miles. A couple days of rest are in his immediate future.
A couple miles north a Spanish-speaking dayhiker asked me in broken English for help finding his friend. He was far from his car at High Rocks and definitely headed the wrong direction. Once I got that across he scurried back the way he'd come. I caught up later and found him with a group of five amigos and amigas.
Soon after, a foursome of young backpackers passed heading south. They'd gotten on this afternoon and said they were heading for the second shelter, Ensign Cowall, some eight miles away. Sunset was about 90 minutes off. I told them about the nearer shelter, but figured they were on a schedule. At least it wasn't too rocky for night hiking where they'd be.
I reached Pen Mar Park near the stateline. It was deserted. I'd called someone earlier who advertised a spare room in AWOL, thinking I'd avoid a cold night, but hadn't heard back. Now convinced I should get inside, I called Days Inn in Waynesboro and got a good rate, but could not find a way into town. One shuttler wasn't home, another was driving to another town, and hitching on the quiet residential road near the park seemed improbable. So I cancelled the reservation, dreams of a warm bed and Mexican food dashed, and walked on. 
The sun was setting as I reached the Mason Dixon line and entered my home state. A half mile further steeply downhill brought me to a leafy campsite by a footbridge over Falls Creek. I piled up leaves as a mattress before pitching the tent over them, as my ramen dinner steeped.
I'm trying a different technique with the quilt tonight, strapping it around the pad rather than around me. We'll see if tonight is more comfortable.","Annapolis Rocks
",Falls Creek campsite,"Nov 15, Fri",17
Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624927,"The leaves must have made a difference. I had a more comfortable night than most. Still rotisseried during the night, but at least the lower back wasn't as sore. The temp inside the tent was nearly 40. Outside it was under 30. Not guying out the sides held in a few more degrees but also caused condensation. The condensation in the tent and on the quilt froze once exposed. 
Cookies for breakfast. Didn't feel like waiting around freezing while water boiled for oatmeal. As I arrived at Deer Lick Shelter several miles away I met section hiker Inferno Man doing just that. But he'd hiked here from a shelter several miles north to warm up first. A troop of boy scouts piled into that shelter at 9 last night, which sounds about right for a Friday night. Inferno Man got his name from using white gas to help build a fire. He poured too little at first, then too much. The flames followed the stream of fluid up to the bottle, which burst into flames and spit fire in all directions. Inferno Man dropped and rolled to put his clothes out while other campers scurried to stomp out the rest. 
Inferno Man is middle-aged and of Asian descent, possibly first generation given his accent. Which I find noteworthy because the ATC is actively promoting more diversity in the hiker community. Yet I see a number of Asian-American hikers (though few actual Asians, unless Kiwis and Aussies count). Also a few Hispanics, including UNICEF who I hiked with for hundreds of miles (see other journal). But I've only met one black thruhiker, a girl named Tangerine at ATC's Blackburn center in Virginia last year. She finished. I've seen her Katahdin postcards in various hostels. I've also seen a fair number of Asian dayhikers, especially near major cities like Washington and New York. I'm not sure why different ethnicities embrace hiking more than others. I've met several Outward Bound groups taking inner city (mostly black) teens into the woods, and plenty of mostly white camp groups. Never any Asian youth groups. Maybe it's a question of disposable income. But most thruhikers, young ones at least, are nearly broke and that's not stopping them. I'd say it's just a cultural preference, but that just begs the question. Personally I don't see the point in pushing a narrow kind of diversity in the hiker community. It is already very diverse, in nearly every way imaginable. And every one of them is there because they chose to be.
Met an overnight backpacker coming down from a cold night on Chimney Rocks. He had a summer sleeping bag. Said he was starting a new job Monday so this was his last hurrah. Plenty of weekends in his future though.
The Antietam shelter has been moved to the Tuscarora trail. I guess they disassembled it to move it. It was an older one, so not sure why they didn't just construct a new one on Tuscarora. It was redundant on the AT though. It was the middle of three shelters within three miles of each other. The privy is still there, with CLOSED spray painted across it. Shouldn't be a problem as there's a small state park with restrooms not 300 yards away.
It was mostly sunny, reaching just over 40 today. Pleasant hiking but definitely chilly. Kept hat and gloves on all day even when climbing nearly 1000 feet to Chimney Rocks. Did not expect that big a climb in this stretch. The trail actually went over 2000 feet elevation at one point. The trail was very leafy and often rocky, which is a difficult combination. At least it was dry. Rocky Mountain in particular had some long rocky stretches. The trail planners kept running it up to the rocky ridgeline for a little excitement I guess.
I've been picking up several bits of trash everyday on the trail. It's the least I can do. When I get to major roadsides and see all the litter I wince. But at least the backcountry can be pristine. Today I found the rubber end of a trekking pole. Two days ago I found an iPhone charging cable, which I left at Annapolis Rocks trail register in case some non-Android user can benefit from it. Yesterday I found a sleeping bag. The third abandoned bag I've seen on the trail. The first one of which I actually took with me in New York when I had none of my own and was freezing at night. I left this one alone. Didn't fit in my hipbelt with the other trash. I've also passed many hats, gloves, even a jacket or two just this week alone. These are often from dayhikers/walkers who may be back so I just make them visible. 
At the bottom of Rocky Mountain was route 30, my endpoint for the day. Over 17 miles and it was not even 2. The Trail of Hope hostel is less than a mile west. It's supposed to be 20 degrees tonight, much colder than the last couple nights, so I wanted to get inside.  Halfway to the hostel is Bonfire Burger, where I got the closest thing to a Chick-fil-A sandwich I've had on trail. Plus a milkshake, because it doesn't matter if it feels like winter, milkshakes are awesome. 
The hostel is in a house on the highway next to the Trail of Hope church, which itself seems to be in an old storefront. No one answered when I knocked so I walked in, picked out a bunk in one of the upstairs bedrooms, showered, and left to walk the mile down to Rutters to get dinner. Lunch was already a distant memory. I must have the hiker hunger again. 113 miles in. 
Barry the caretaker found me as I returned. It's a relaxed place, basically self-service everything. Just clean up after yourself and don't be a jerk. I am the only one here. There's eggs in the fridge so I've got that planned for breakfast. In the evening I did laundry and vegged out watching movies. My legs really felt it today so I'm hoping my ""Nero"" gives them time to recuperate.","Falls Creek campsite

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624947,"This trip is making it obvious I'm not well-equipped for winter hiking. Braving the cold for a dayhike is invigorating. Being exposed for days at a time is uncomfortable and stressful. I was lucky to head out on a populated stretch with occasional services nearby, including hostels where I could escape from the cold. Had this been in a more remote area I would have been more concerned. It's unseasonably cold for mid-November, yes, but the lows haven't been much below 20. Part of it is having equipment intended for shoulder seasons, not winter. An enclosed sleeping bag rather than quilt would help. More insulating gloves would help - my fingers are always the first to go numb. For really low temps a four-season tent would be the way to go. My puffy is intended for chilly summer mountain evenings, not winter nights. On the other hand, things I did right were to bring multiple layers for hiking and sleeping. Today I wore my hiking shirt, fleece, puffy and rain jacket all day. Plus a buff around my neck and chin, two caps, gloves, and shell mittens. I was a sight to the dayhikers. But let them walk around in 30 degrees all day without the guarantee of going inside later.
I whipped up breakfast burritos at Trail of Hope hostel this morning using their eggs plus stuff from my food bag. Phoned Ironmasters hostel in Pine Grove Furnace again to see if they'd be open. This time someone answered, but it was a guest. He'd come in last night through an unlocked door and slept in a bunk but the host had never made an appearance. He asked who I thought he should write the check out to. This gave me hope I could find a warm place to spend tonight.
So out into the cold I went, all bundled up. It never got above 35 today. The thermometer seemed stuck on 31 until well after noon. The wind was gaining strength again after a couple calmer days. Snow flurries surrounded me early on as the sun peeked out from the clouds. Soon it became a dusting before tailing off. 
Approaching the first shelter, Quarry Gap, I met Hot Tank on an overnight hike with his ten-year-old daughter. He thruhiked a couple years ago. His daughter was all bundled up in a winter coat and didn't say anything. I told her to try it in the spring as well.
This was my third time over this stretch of Michaux State Forest. It was part of my first solo section two years ago from Harper's Ferry to Swatara Gap, then I came back last year to Quarry Gap shelter with my two youngest sons. Quarry Gap has two shelters with a small picnic pavilion between them and a porch swing. It's probably the most homey shelter on the AT. Two small groups were working up their nerve to leave the shelters. A father/daughter pair were still half in their sleeping bags, but seemed cheerful. Even in November this shelter is popular on weekends. 
The trail wound past rhododendron forests and mountain laurel. Brown and blue hills loomed through the trees on either side. It crossed numerous gravel roads. Eventually it went through an area being restored to native scrub oak and pitch pine by prescribed fire to clear out other species that took advantage of the suppression of wild fires in the last century. This ecosystem only existed historically because natural fires burned away competition. Early settlers encouraged the burns to promote blueberry production.
The halfway point of the AT is in this portion. Every year it moves a bit. There's a sign for the 2018 mark and a more permanent one a few miles north for the 1985 mark. Nothing for this year. The original halfway point is many more miles north at Center Point Knob. 
A sixtyish man in hunter camo standing well off trail hailed me as I passed. Wasn't from the area and wanted to know where I had gotten on and off the trail. He dreams of thruhiking someday and asked if I was going ""all the way"". It was the second or third time I'd been asked that this weekend. I quizzed him about hunting season, since it was Sunday yet he and a buddy were out and seemed to be scouting locations. Archery season is over, bear season is starting up, and deer rifle season doesn't start until Monday after Thanksgiving. That's what I thought, and many areas of Pennsylvania treat it as a school holiday, but a couple of dayhikers decked out in orange vests yesterday had convinced me rifle season was already underway. I've heard barrages of rifle fire on and off for days at target ranges near the trail. People are serious about deer season. Sunday, in any event, is always hunting free so I did not bother to put my orange hiking shirt on the outside as I did the other day after a particularly close volley of rifles went off. 
Michaux Forest has many hiking trails and it is relatively easy hiking, but much of the forest at higher elevations is burnt or torn up. It's like walking through a war zone in some areas. Yet other spots have dense vegetation, lovely streams and springs with small cascades, and the forest is dotted with remote cabins you can rent. It's a popular backcountry spot in southern Pennsylvania. But then again there aren't many options. 
The last stretch by Tom's Run and Sunset Rocks was one of the nice areas. It dumped me out on route 233 and into Pine Grove Furnace State Park, home of a former iron forge. The iron master's mansion is now a hostel, catering not just to hikers but frugal travellers generally as well as special events. It was deserted. A sign said check in was from 5 to 9pm. But taking the guest's advice from this morning I tried each door and was rewarded with an unlocked kitchen door. This proved to be the right move, as 5pm came and went without any sign of my host. 
I dropped my stuff next to a bunk and explored the old house. Two dorms, male and female, a master suite, a couple of sitting rooms, a computer lounge, dining room, and kitchen. There was a private section I did not enter. Later I heard what sounded like someone entering and leaving the private area. I called out, rang the bell for the innkeeper, but no one appeared. Well, at least I tried to check in properly. They must have heard me, and seen the lights I'd turned on. Seems they don't care if I crash for the night. Anyway, it's warm.","Trail of Hope hostel, Fayetteville

Valley Forge,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624965,"I couldn't help but sleep in a bit in the warm bunk at Ironmasters. ""A bit"" meaning until almost sunrise. While fixing oatmeal I heard footsteps in the upstairs private area. The innkeeper was up and about. He finally made an appearance just as I was about to leave, and seemed astonished to find me. I guess the innkeeper buzzer is just for show. Anyway, at least I got to pay for my accommodation and not feel like a thief in the night.
Fog hung over Pine Grove Furnace park as I walked out past Fuller Lake and along manicured flat trail. It had rained overnight, and was just above freezing. It would have been an uncomfortable morning in the tent. The trees shook off their water droplets as I passed. I came prepared for cold wet weather, but by late morning I'd entered a drier section and the temperature eventually climbed into the mid 40s. Downright balmy compared to most of the last week. But still cold enough I needed to keep hat and gloves on. 
Early on my energy waned. I'd finished off my snacks yesterday and all my cold food last night except a small bag of raisins. I had no plans to stop and cook. I wanted to get to Boiling Springs and finish this section. A couple miles past the Tagg Run shelter I hit a decision point on route 34. Detour a quarter mile and hit a convenience store / deli for lunch, or plow through to the end? Both options would be completely in character for me. Plowing through won out, primarily because it was too cold to be craving a cold drink. And the raisins had temporarily sated me.
But the trail didn't reward my stoicism. Instead it roller-coastered for the next eight miles, and became almost continuously rocky. The ""highlight"" was two rock mazes where the trail was threaded through large boulders on top of the ridge in an effort to throw hikers off the scent. Beyond these distractions, my legs and mind were exhausted by mile after mile of treading carefully amongst leaves lest I hit a hidden rock at the wrong angle. And each climb tested my will and energy reserves, if not my strength. 
Nearing route 94 by Mt Holly Springs I met yet another southbound flip-flopper named Lord Hobo. The college-aged boy had a huge shock of red hair that splayed out, mirroring his impressive beard. He figured he had only five days til he reached his finish line in Harper's Ferry, and not a moment too soon, as the weather was getting too wintry for his taste. Still more flip-floppers are behind him, he said. He moved on, headed for the deli I'd just passed up. I obviously haven't been out long enough. 
A couple miles later two sixty-something New Yorkers stopped to chat. They'd just driven down to hike another thirty miles or so closer to the Mason Dixon line. They've been working on the trail on spare weekends. One wanted to know what I thought was the hardest part of the trail. Maine, of course! They complained about Pennsylvania's rocks, having spent all their hiking time here of late. When I told them northern Virginia and Maryland had plenty of their own they let out dramatic groans and hiked off laughing.
The last peak of the roller coaster was Center Point Knob, the original midpoint of the AT. 24 miles north of the current midpoint. It sports a high-relief bronze plaque featuring a hiker, set in a boulder. Similar to Springer only not coated in verdigris. From Center Point Knob one can see the Cumberland Valley laid out below, full of farms, highways, and trucking companies.
The trail crosses the Cumberland Valley, part of the Great Valley that stretches from New York to Alabama, for sixteen miles to get from the northernmost edge of the Blue Ridge chain, South Mountain, up to Blue Mountain, the most eastward of a series of ridges and valleys that snake northeasterly across Pennsylvania to New Jersey. They are all part of the billion-year-old Appalachian mountains. The valley has no shelters, and no tenting is permitted because the trail corridor is too narrow. You are basically walking along the edge of farm fields. During the summer it's quite hot to hike due to exposure, and the water is full of farm runoff. Two years ago I hiked the first half in the evening and split a motel outside Carlisle with a thruhiker named On The Go. We walked the rest in the morning while it was relatively cool.
Heat was not a problem today. It was 45 degrees. Pretty pleasant with the sun shining and wind calm. A long clambor down from Center Point Knob over leaf-covered rocks dumped me in a barren corn field. The trail wound through open fields for two miles into the old iron-producing village of Boiling Springs, now known for its fishing lake in the center of town. Young children were out feeding the ducks. Squawking geese pushed their way through to get first dibs.
Originally I'd intended to walk another eight miles to route 11 on the east side of Carlisle. But I'd already done nineteen miles, I was just as close to Carlisle here, and it would be dark in two hours. That last 8 miles would have to wait for another section. I had planned to hitch the five miles into Carlisle to my car, but my nerve faltered as I stood outside Anile's restaurant and initially saw no cars going my way. So I called an Uber. First one I've ever used while on trail.
The driver came down from Carlisle. The first words out of his mouth were how far a drive it was for him. Eleven minutes, he said, like it was clearly a big deal. I was speechless. I wanted to explain to him that I had just walked - WALKED mind you - 152 miles over an entire week (or, more exactly, 10,155 minutes) to get here, and I didn't really care how many minutes he had to drive to pick up a paying fare. But instead I listened as he explained he usually grabs the three minute ride around town and a quick three bucks. The way he drove so carefully into Boiling Springs it was like I'd asked him to enter a foreign country.
In fact my driver actually was from a foreign country. Specifically the Congo, as in The ""Democratic Republic"" of the Congo, formerly Zaire. Scare quotes necessary because real democratic republics don't assassinate political opponents and operate like warlords, which is how he described life in his old country. He'd also been to South Africa, Kenya, China, and more. But apparently not Boiling Springs. He moved to Carlisle because it's quiet. Peaceful, as he said. Not, you know, a war zone.
After getting my car I had my first real meal of the day. Two Chick-fil-A sandwiches. I could have easily done a third. But I've no more miles to hike for awhile, so I've got to be good.","Ironmasters hostel, Pine Grove Furnace
