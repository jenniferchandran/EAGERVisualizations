Honestly, I am floored to actually be starting this trip. Well everything starts with a single step. Hopefully, my efforts will step-by-step continue onward for however long. This is going to hurt and be fun at the same time! Can't wait for Tuesday morning in the Rain.","The next day after....

There is a Bunkhouse at the General Store just down the road from the crossroads that you will encounter at the roadway where the rest stop is located.
I went to the General Store for resupply (there is a Gear Shop there too!) and ended up slack packing for two days from there to Neil's Gap. It was a welcomed break for my knees and got showers/hot chow/and resupplied. Also swapped out some gear. 
I love the family that run's the bunkhouse/general store. Recommended.","Suches GA Bunk House 2 nights

Jumper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533404,"I started at Springer Mountain on April 12th and had to go off trail at the NOC in NC for 14 days due to VA Medical appointments over in Fayetteville NC. 
Got back on Trail at the NOC - the hardest 2.5 days to Fontana Dam, NC. Beautiful area. Always careful on trail, then I slipped and fell walking along a perfectly good road in the rain at night, injuring my ribs and earning a 10-14 no-strenuous activity from the Doctor at the ER in Bryson, NC. 
Am rehabbing in Arlington VA and plan to go over to Harper's Ferry on Amtrak in about 10-12 days when I can sleep again. I am going thru that stage of anxiety associated with not being out in Nature (I read about it - hits you when you finish your AT hike... but I'm not finished). 
Making the best of this ""break"", and reorganizing my gear then plan to return to Arlington VA and my lovely supportive wife.","AT NOBO

Jumper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/550842,"This year I hiked from Georgia to Fontana Dam where I had a freak night accident simply walking along a road and damaged my left knee and left rib cage. I gave it another shot from Harper's Ferry north to Fayetteville PA where my knee got the best of me. Strangely, I live in Fayetteville NC, and part time in Arlington VA.I was a hiker that should have never been, having had a parachute accident in 1987 and multiple surgeries, the last of which was a spinal fusion in July 2011 which forced me into retirement. Finally in December 2015 I was able to actually improve physically to the point I could entertain the idea of hike. My family and friends were all shocked when I took off and actually didn't think me not crazy until my second start up at Harper's Ferry. But all the injuries and pushing too hard daily took it's toll. So I am looking forward to March 2017 when I can head NOBO from Fontana Dam and at least make it up to Harper's Ferry. I vow to take a slow pace, and do 10 mile days for as long as it takes. I know now that story about the old turtle and rabbit to be true!",,Fontana Dam Northward,"Oct 23, Sun",0

I was quite surprised that my Phantom 15 sleeping bag weighed in at 37 ounces and that my lightheart solo tent came in at 35 ounces but that was with the titanium stakes and footprint. I will probably end up adding another pound since I am going to bring a new Spot gen3 gps (family wants to keep up and know I am Okay). I am very excited to say the least that my pack will never weigh more than 30 pounds even with five to six days of food.I'm still on track for Fontana Dam departure the first week of April and I hope I can make it to Hot Springs in time for Trail Days.,"Preparation

Jumper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521719,"2017 - Hope to start back on trail in April at Fontanna Dam; I might do a week south out of Harper's Ferry in February or March before my April 2017 Re-start. Went to Harper's Ferry on 31 Jan 17 and talked with Dot.com who is volunteering on Tuesdays - she finished the trail last year after 11-years of section hiking around 350 miles per year (I won't give away a lady's age, but like myself looks to be retired so we can all make the miles). I live in two locations due to home ownership (Fay NC) and wife's work (Arlington VA/Ft Meyer). Hence the ability to do the trail from multiple areas. I hiked twice in 2016 due starting at Springer Mt thru to Fontanna Dam and was injured in a off trail fall, and then restarted at Harper's Ferry over to Fay, PA before my knee wouldn't lift). So 2017 is my restart and I hope to complete the trail. 
2016 original posting - Bus to Georgia: Created my account today and starting to acquire my equipment for a NOBO thru hike. I haven't picked a departure date, but looking at late April or early March 2016; interested in hearing from folks who plan to depart similar timeframe.
I took this picture one moring about 6:47 a.m. on a east facing ridge, just as the sun started to creep across the trail NOBO.
