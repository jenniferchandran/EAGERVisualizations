Wahoo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/423617,"My Daughter, Jessica and I left Ohio for the 5 hour drive to Harpers Ferry. We arrived at the Appalachian Trail Conservancy at about 10:30 AM. After we said our goodbyes to each other, I started my trek across the Potomac River and down the steps and got my first look at the A.T. I'll have to admit that my heart was racing. I'm not sure if it was nerves or the excitement of starting an 80 mile hike south to Thorntons Gap.The first climb out of Harpers Ferry was pretty tough, but I made it to the top and made a big right turn to Keys Gap. After that first climb, every thing else was not too bad. I decided since starting my first day of hiking so late in the day and waking up so early for the drive, that I would stop at the Blackburn Trail Center for the night. I put up my tent at the campsite and walked down to the Trail Center. It is a very nice place for hikers to stop for the night or just to visit. After making dinner, cleaning up and hanging my food bag, I called Keli to let her know that I was ok. After that it was to sleep at about 9:00pm. First day on the trail was 12 miles. I was very happy with that!","Harpers Ferry

Wahoo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/423707,"Woke up this morning at 5:00. Breakfast was two packs of oatmeal and a cup of coffee. Sitting by my tent listening to the birds, watching the sunrise and drinking a cup of coffee was the perfect start to my second day on the A.T. I got everything packed up, refilled my water and was on the trail at 7:00. Today I started the Roller Coaster section, at first it didn't seem too bad, but then the constant climbs and descents started making it rough. The heat also didn't help. It was about 95 degrees. I crossed the 4 lanes of traffic on RT 7 at about 11:00. Is it me, or do people on this highway speed up when they see a hiker crossing the highway? I made it to Bears Den Hostel at about 11:30. When I got there, my water was empty. I refilled the water, took a cold shower and ate lunch. While I was there, I talked to a few Thru-hikers. One of them was Second Shift Steamer. He had previously completed a Thru Hike in 2011 and was doing it again to raise money for breast cancer awareness. We talked for a while, he told me some interesting stories and gave me some advice for hiking the A.T.I left Bears Den Hostel at about 1:30. I spent longer there than I planned, but it was worth it. At about 3:00, a bad storm rolled in. There was lightning all around me, so I thought the best thing to do would be to cover my pack and put it and my poles under a tree. I sat on a rock away from the pack for about 1 1/2 hours. After getting started again, I came across a gravel road. A husband and wife were sitting there. They had Trail Magic of ice cold beer and fruit. I had a Yuengling and an apple, talked to them for a short while and continued on to Morgans Mill camp site. I arrived at the campsite at about 7:30. This was not much of a camp site, it was more like a very small clearing in the trees. I was the only one there, so I put up the tent, made dinner, hung the food bag in a tree, crawled in the tent and called Keli. This was a long day of 12 hours and 14.8 miles. I could have gone farther had it not been for the rain. I guess you have to take what nature gives you!","Blackburn Trail Center

Wahoo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/423710,"I woke up this morning at 5:00. I went to get my food bag down from the tree and I could not get it to lower. Somehow it was struck on the branches. I had to use my knife to cut it down. My clip and part of the line was stuck in the tree. I guess that's why you bring spares. I made breakfast and started packing up to hit the trail. As I was packing, a bear ran through the camp site, less than 20 yards away from me. He ran across the stream and into the trees. A few minutes later three hikers came down the hill. I asked them if they realized that they scared that bear into the camp site? They said that didn't see it, but heard something in the trees.I finally finished the Roller Coaster this morning. I stopped at a shelter to refill my water, sign the register and continue on. A few miles away from the shelter, I noticed that my glasses were not clipped to my pack and I had lost them. Instead of turning around and trying to find them, I kept going. My decision for this was, I figured that they could be anywhere and I may have not found them and walked all that way back for nothing. I reached the side trail for Dick's Dome shelter at 5:00, and I had a decision to make. Do I go four more miles to the next shelter or stop here for the night? Seeing how I didn't have my glasses, I decided to stop here! At the shelter was Goose from Toledo, Bananas from Cleveland, Danger Dave from Mansfield, and me from North Canton. An all Ohio crew! O-H-I-O! There was no cell phone reception coverage, so a nightly call to Keli was not going to happen. My first thought was, I know that she is going to be worried! I put up the tent, ate dinner, hung the food and asleep by 8:30. 12 miles today.","Morgan Mill Camp site

Wahoo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/423953,"I packed everything up and hit the trail at 7:00 this morning. I was a little behind my planned schedule, so I decided that this was probably going to be a long day. There was nothing exciting that happened today, except taking in all the nice scenery. Today was another hot day and I got caught in another rain storm. I got to the shelter close to 8:00. I put up the tent but had no motivated to do anything else other than lay down and fall asleep. 22 miles.","Dick's Dome Shelter

Wahoo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/423959,"I woke up this morning at 7:00. I had a few things to do before hitting the trail this morning. I refilled my water, ate breakfast, packed the tent and then organized my backpack and made some adjustments to it. I also had to work on my feet a little, because a couple toes were not looking so good. By the time I got on the trail this morning, it was close to 9:00. A little later than I wanted to, but I needed to get things done. Shortly after I left the shelter, I came across a bear that ran into the woods. I entered Shenadoah National Park and it seem like the trail changed. It was very well maintained, but the climbs were very tough. At about 1:00, the rain started again. It lasted about 2 hours. I stood on a log for about an hour before deciding to move on. I got to Gravel Springs Hut at about 4:30. Not one for the shelters, I put my tent up again. The shelter ended up being full with hikers and there were a good bit of tent campers also.","Tom Floyd Wayside

Wahoo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/423974,"I left Gravel Spring hut at 7:30. This was a very tough day with a lot of high steep climbs. I came across two deer today. Both of them were just standing on the trail and were not interested in moving off the trail. Finally after a few minutes, they left. I also came across a pretty good sized snake. I'm not sure what kind it was, but it looked to be about 6 feet long.Later in the day, I made plans to stop at Elkwallow Wayside store. On the trail, I told myself that I was getting a Snickers bar and a Gatorade. When I got to the store, I bought two bags of potato chips, two Gatorades and a bag of almonds. I took it outside to picnic table in the shade. Needless to say, it didn't last long. I used the restroom, refilled my water and put my pack on and was ready to leave, when I remember that I forgot the Snickers bar. Then a lady and her husband came up to me and told me that they had hiked a section in Maryland last year and they were here giving out Trail Magic and asked if I would like a Snickers bar. I do believe in Trail Magic and it is amazing!At about 2:00, I decided to sit on a log and eat my lunch. An older couple came off a side trail. They were just out exploring for the day. We talked for a lit bit, then they left. A few minutes later, they came back and told me that they were lost. I looked at my map and told them that they need to go the same direction that I was going. We hikeD together and talked for about 2 miles. it slowed me down a little, but that was ok. I got to Pass Mountain Hut at about 5:00. I found a nice level site and put the tent up. Asleep by 8:30.","Gravel Spring Hut

Wahoo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/423976,"Last night was heavy rain for most of the night. I woke up at 6:00. It was a cool and clear morning. I had breakfast and packed everything up for my last 2.5 miles. I got on the trail at 8:00 heading to Thorntons Gap to meet Keli. I got about 1.5 miles down the trail and I could see other hikers coming towards me. I couldn't see them very well because I lost my glasses. The closer that the hikers got to me, I noticed that it was Keli and her dad Neal. The best Trail Magic ever! We then drove to Big Meadows campground to meet my brother Jay, his wife Lisa, my niece Linzi and her daughter Skyler. Jay made a great breakfast of eggs, bacon, sausage, hashbrowns, orange juice and coffee. More Trail Magic from the best brother!","Pass Mountain Hut

This past week has been very tough, but I loved the experience. A lesson that I learned was don't take more than what the trail gives you!
I am looking forward to doing another section sometime in the future!",,View Entry,"Jun 30, Sun",0
