Silver Streak ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606959,"I decided to thru hike the AT in August.  To be truthful I never really wanted to hike the AT.  This past summer we were hanging out on the PCT in Tuolumne Meadows talking with some PCT hikers and one of them told me I should hike the AT.  I said I had no intention to hike the AT because of the ticks, crowds, humidity, rain and the green tunnel. He insisted that it was a great time.  I was not convinced. I have to admit that I’m spoiled from hiking in the Sierra with its fantastic views and type 2 fun.
I recently retired and can now follow my dreams.  I really wanted to go surfing everyday but I live in South Carolina which isn’t know for its surf.  I could have gotten back into triathlons but after 25 years of racing and 4 Hawaiian Ironman finishes I was ready for a new challenge. 
I need a challenge to keep me going and I really enjoy backpacking so if I couldn’t go surfing everyday then I decided to try one of the 3 long distance trails to see if I have what it takes to be a thru hiker.  Nancy wants to do the PCT in 2 years when she retires so that eliminates the PCT. I want to save the CDT for when I have at least one thru hike under my belt plus it involves gross water sources and grizzlies (which scare me more than ticks).  
So that left me with the AT. Now I needed to address my 2 major fears/concerns.
To help me deal with the ticks I bought RailRiders Eco-mesh pants and Journeyman long sleeve shirt that have been pretreated with Insect Shield.  I sent 2 pairs of DarnTough socks, my dirty girl gaiters and a bandana into Insect Shield to get treated. I will also use Picaridin as needed. I’ve used Picaridin with great success to combat the hordes of Sierra mosquitoes. I’ve been hypothermic several times because my rain jacket failed during cold Sierra rainstorms and it was scary.  I did a lot of research on this topic using blogs and youtube. I needed something that allowed a cooling air flow while keeping the rain off me. I decided to get a ZPacks rain poncho. Some people complain about how ponchos flap in the wind but the ZPacks poncho has zippers and fasteners to minimize flapping. In addition it fits snugly around the base of my pack.  I used it with great success during a cold (low 40s) rain while hiking on the Foothills Trail. My poncho in conjunction with a Gossamer Gear umbrella kept me dry and comfortable the whole day. I’ve rigged my pack so that I can carry my umbrella hands free.
I’m committed to finishing this trail and becoming worthy of the title AT thru hiker.   Finishing the AT will involve the same (if not more) mental toughness that was necessary to train for and complete an Ironman Triathlon. Touching that sign on Katahdin will be a great athletic and personal accomplishment and will mean as much to me as being a 4 times Hawaiian Ironman finisher.


Happy hiking,

Silver Streak ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606960,"To prepare for my thru hike I decided to drive the 4 hours from my house near Charleston, SC to the Foothills Trail once a month.  I will start my hikes at Table Rock State park and then hike as far as I can toward the trail’s terminus and then turn around and hike back.  In my opinion this is the most beautiful section of the trail and has the steepest climbs. I will be experiencing a variety of weather conditions from hot and humid to cold and wet.  Each hike will be an opportunity to test my equipment and fitness.
Foothills Trail. Table Rock State Park South Carolina
19 to 23 September 2018:
Itinerary and lessons learned
19 September: 12 miles from the trailhead to a stealth secret spot.
20 September: 18 miles to the Toxaway River
21 September:  22 miles. I had planned to continue on the trail 16 miles towards the Bear Camp Creek campsite. Part way there I stopped to talk to 2 hikers that were thru hiking the trail the opposite direction from Oconee State Park.  One of the guys was an AT section hiker that told my how to use my Ursack correctly. He also mentioned that about 2 miles down the trail there was a nest full of angry hornets. I guess a bear was digging into their log and they were pissed.  I hate hornets. I had a hornet fly up my running shorts and sting me in my privates. I had to pull my shorts down to limit the damage. Luckily there weren’t any families around. He also mentioned that Copperheads have 2 breeding seasons and September is one of them.  They had encountered at least 5 Copperheads on the trail the stretch of trail I was headed to. Two of them seemed to be mating within the roots of the trail. I thanked them for this information and hiked on for about an hour. As I was nearing the hornet nest location I decided that I have learned everything I needed to learn from this trip and isn’t wasn’t worth getting stung  by hornets or bitten by a Copperhead. Especially because these were the first hikers I’ve seen in 2 days. So I decided to turn around and hike back to the secret spot I stayed at the first night.I was excited for this challenge because if I made it it would be my first 22 mile day.
Lessons learned
Clothes: My hiking clothes stayed saturated with sweat and stink. I planned on testing out several items to see how well they work in the humidity.  I normally hike in lightweight runner shorts that have a liner. I usually carry 2 and rotate them like most people do with socks. Rinse one out and hang it from my pack to dry while I wear the other one.  At night I’ll wear the clean one to bed and use it to hike in the next day. Everyone raves about Exofficio boxer briefs so I bought a pair on sale to test out. These did not work for me. They were comfortable enough but the did not dry out quickly.  I rinsed them off in a river around noon and they were still wet when I got to camp. I hung them up on a line and they were still wet in the morning and they stunk so bad I had to put them in a plastic bag. I also learned not to place my washed socks to dry on my front backpack straps.  My ULA Circuit has bungee type straps for attaching water bottles to your shoulder harness. I’ve always placed my socks to dry on one strap. This way I wouldn’t have to worry about losing them off the back of my pack. Well this method works great in the arid southwest but it sucks in the humid southeast.  The socks I had rinsed off in the river were getting soaked from my sweat and ended up being wetter and smelled worst than the socks I was wearing.Water: I’m testing out different methods for collecting and filtering water.  We normally use the 4 liter Platypus gravity works system. We usually carry 1.5 liter Hydrapak bladders that we fill up directly from the gravity system.This is a great system for my wife and I but isn’t efficient for one person.    I tried to use one of our old 1.5 liter Hydrapak bladders In lieu of the 4 liter Platypus dirty bag. It worked alright but I think I will try a Sawyer Squeeze next time. I like carrying my water in 75ml SmartBottles. I keep one on my chest strap and one in my pocket.  With this heat I was going through 750 ml of water an hour. I would stop every 2 hours, filter water, camel up one bottle and then carry 2 water bottles to the next stop. I had to carry 3 liters 3 miles to my first nights campsite which is a dry camp. Sleep system: It was so hot that I didn’t use my sleeping bag and simply slept in my silk liner.Food storage: Normally we carry BearVault 500’s with us to practice for the Sierra where they are required.  I bought a Ursack AllMitey to use on the AT. It weighs more than a normal Ursack but it will also protect against mini bears.  The first night I hung it PCT style in a tree. The next day I talked with an AT hiker that also had an Ursack in he told me you are just supposed to tie them off to the tree.  I guess I misinterpreted the directions of the Ursack website because and I paraphrase the hiker: “Why pay that much money if you still need to go through the hassle of a bear hang.”Vlogging:  I tried taking videos of the trail. I liked doing it but I stopped because it messes with my hiking rhythm and takes too much time.  I find that my hiking style is similar to my running and cycling style. I like to get into a comfortable pace at a certain heart rate and stay in that zone.  I still enjoy my surroundings but I get annoyed if I have to constantly stop and start. I also think it uses too much battery. Ticks: Walking through the high brush gets me thinking about ticks. Luckily I’ve only had one tick get on me in my many years of hiking this trail.  Whenever I pass through an area with tall grass or shrubs I constantly stop and check my legs for ticks. I use Picaridin lotion for prevention.Silk blazing: The spider webs were horrible.  I rarely saw anyone on the trail so it was up to me to clear the trail of spider webs.  It was hard to watch the trail for trip hazards because I had to keep scanning ahead for spider webs which seemed to be located at eye level.  I eventually learned how to spot them and used my poles to knock them away at the last minute. I wasn’t able to see them all and I frequently was covered in webs. Luckily I only had about 5 spiders land on my arms. One landed on my face. Gross. I was constantly wiping webs and dead bugs from the webs off my arms, face and hair. I washed in the streams to get them off. Night lighting.  I have a rechargeable Black Diamond Revolt headlamp.  It works great for walking around but I find it annoying for chores inside my tent.  We have a small lightweight solar lantern that I will bring next time as the days get shorter.
Cold soaking breakfast. At home I make a breakfast concoction using chia seeds, protein powder, flavored oatmeal packet and instant coffee. At camp I add water to a Talenti ice cream container add my breakfast ingredients, put the lid on and shake.  I place it in my Ursack overnight. In the morning I have a tasting and nutritious pudding like meal. This method saves time and fuel. I add the coffee to give me my caffeine fix.Night creatures.  During this time of year the forests come alive at night with the chorus of night creatures.  The first night I enjoyed the frogs, insects, and owls entertaining me. The creepy sounds of sticks snapping and the scurrying noises of small mammals is a little concerning the first night on the trail.  The more miles you put in and the tireder you are the easier it is to get to sleep. I was woken up by a blood curdling screech one night, I yelled at the creature to shut up, turned over and went back to sleep.",,View Entry,"Sep 19, Wed",0
Silver Streak ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607016,"Foothills Trail shakedown hike.
14 October: Table Rock Trailhead to a secret spot.  12 miles
15 October.  Secret spot to Toxaway River 17 miles.  
16 October Toxaway River to Whitewater Falls junction sign to get water and then back to the first campsite past the Bad Creek parking lot.  I got to practice using my rain gear and setting up my tent in the rain. 19 miles
17 October: Back to the Toxaway River.
18 October: Back to my secret spot. Bear hunting season started.  I couldn’t believe how many hunters were out. I’m glad they aren’t using dogs this weekend.
19 October: Back to Table Rock and then drive home.
What I learned 
Packs: I was still using my ULA Circuit backpack.  It has served me well for 3 years in the Sierra and numerous Foothill Trail training hikes.  Sometimes I don’t pack it correctly and it gets off balance. When this happens it lists to my left and puts strain on my shoulder.  It also doesn’t have any air flow around the back. I end up sweating like a pig and the packs starts to stink. In 2017 one day before we were set to step off on our Sierra hike the top flap of the Circuit ripped while I was packing it.  I think the abrasion from the BearVault 500 caused it. Luckily there was an REI an hour away and they had an Osprey Exos in my size. My wife has been using the Exos for 4 years without issue. I enjoyed the pack and it carried 34 pounds (8 days of food, ice ax, microspikes) well.  100 miles into the hike the shoulder strap buckle blew out and I had to fix it with a cable tie (borrowed from a hiking buddy aka Scarlet). This was very disappointing and could have been a real issue. At the end of the hike I took the Exos back to REI for a full refund. During this hike I was thinking of getting another Exos because of the back sweat issue being compounded with the humidity on the AT.Water: The Boy Scouts have installed cisterns in some of the streams to collect water.  It’s hard to get water using a bottle of bladder. I cut the top off of Sawyer bag for dipping into cistern.  The Sawyer bag makes a good dipping tool (as compared to a cut off bottle) because it holds a lot of water and folds for easy storage. I tried my Sawyer filter with my Platypus Gravity feed dirty bag.  It worked well. Next time I’m going to try it using a bottle to hold the dirty water. Toilet supplies: I tried out the Boulder Bidet system.  It works great and will save me from taking and packing out so much toilet paper. I put 1 drop of Dr. Bonners soap in it and save some water to my wash hands when I finished cleaning up the nether region.Clothes:  I purchased RailRiders insect shield treated Eco-Mesh pants and Journeyman long sleeve shirt for the hike.  The pants have a full length zipper on each leg to add ventilation. The shirt has mesh along the arms and pits to aid in ventilation.  They dried quickly after I took a dip in the river. My Exoffico underwear didn’t dry out.Organization.  Either Darwin or Bigfoot suggested packing each days food in its own gallon bag.  This was a great organization tool and time saver. Rain gear.  My umbrella in conjunction with my Patagonia Helium wind jacket (unzipped) and ULA rain kilt worked great.  I kept dry and cool. I didn’t have my umbrella setup to attach to my backpack for hands-free carry. It’s no fun going up steep grades with one trekking pole because you have an umbrella in the other hand.Slip hazards.  Wet rocks, roots, and bridge boards are always slippery.  I slipped off a plank laying across a creek and got my foot wet.  I slipped again as I was walking down rocky outcrops to get to the Horse Pasture River.  I was busy looking around for snakes and failed notice a slick rock. I slipped and fell flat on my back. Luckily I still had my pack on. I forgot my wet rocks are wet rule and slipped off a rock underneath a bridge and fell into a pool of gross nasty water.  Repairs. Zpacks cuben fiber repair tape fixes holes in water bladders.  I learned this in 2017 when my microspikes poked a hole in the water bottle I kept in my back mesh pocket. I used it this trip to repair my Platypus dirty bag with got several holes from my slip at the river.Water supplement additives.  I use Nuun electrolyte replacement tabs and Amazing Grass tablets.  I seem to have trouble with the Nuun tablets affecting my mental state.  I’m not sure but it seems like I get a bad attitude after drinking water with Nunn added.Pacing: I promised myself to take it easy and this trip and not try to break any personal PRs (personal speed records).  Sometimes I get too competitive with myself and try to power up the hills and run down the smooth section sections of trail.\Things to practice.Pooping in the rainGetting water without taking my pack off to retrieve my Sawyer filter.Setting up my tent without getting everything else wet. I used my umbrella this trip to cover my pack.

Silver Streak ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607035,"6 November
I voted in the midterm election and then drove 4 hours to Table Rock State Park.  I didn’t get started hiking until 1:30. My goal was to make it the nine miles to the Cantrell Homestead campsite before dark.  I got there just in time to set up camp and filter water before it got dark. I found out that I don't enjoy Knorr Teriyaki rice. 
7 November.  My goal was to hike the 21 miles to the Toxaway River campsite. I wanted to get there before dark  I got to the campsite around 4. I took a refreshing cool stream bath and felt so much better. I didn’t rinse my clothes because I knew that they wouldn’t dry overnight.  While I was sitting at a picnic table eating dinner I noticed that my phone kept getting drops on it. At first I thought my nose was dripping. I finally figured out that it was drizzling so I quickly put everything under the tent vestibule and used my umbrella to finish eating at the picnic table.  Earlier in the day, I had talked with a DNR officer about all of the bear hunters that I came across last month. He told me that the hunters had harvested 130 bears last month. There are only 3 other campers in the area. They got here by kayaking. 
8 November. My goal today was to hike 9 miles to the Horseshoe Pasture River and then turn around and come back.  I needed to get there by 11:30 so I could get back to Toxaway by 3:30 which would leave me plenty of time to enjoy camp. The forecast was for rain this morning and all day tomorrow.  It started drizzling so I dropped my pack and took off my pants so they wouldn’t get wet and put on my poncho .It felt good to hike in shorts again. Of course it stopped drizzling about 10 minutes later an didn’t rain until later in the evening. after that. I’m here by myself. The sound of the river is all I hear. 
9 November. Toxaway River to my secret spot. 18 miles. I woke up to a drizzle. It had rained steadily last night. I put on my poncho, grabbed my umbrella and went out in the drizzle to get my food bag (Ursack). I ate my cold soaked breakfast and packed up my gear inside the tent. I’ve been practicing this during dry mornings. The only awkward thing about packing up inside a one person tent is rolling up the NeoAir sleeping pad. 
It started to rain again so I put on all of my rain gear before getting out of the tent. I put my umbrella over my backpack to keep my pack dry while I took the tent down and packed it away. The tent pad was covered with puddles. Luckily I had picked the highest spot on the tent pad that had a slight slope. I quickly took down the tent trying to keep the inner dry. I tried to squeeze water out of the tent as I rolled it up to put it in it’s stuff sack. I stored the tent outside my pack. 
I was glad that I’ve been practicing putting on my poncho. I got my pack on under my poncho without getting too wet. I hooked up my umbrella and felt Immediately drier. I had my Marmot Precip rain jacket on to keep my arms dry.  I left all of the jacket zippers open for ventilation. On my bottom I was wearing running shorts and my ULA rain kilt. The temperature was in the lower 40s all day and I felt comfortable hiking in the rain in this system. I never overheated. I actually found myself enjoying the rain and on occasion I would stomp in the deep puddles on the trail and laugh out loud like a child.
I was concerned about how I was going to poop in the rain.  Luckily the urge to go held off until there was a momentary pause in the rain. I filled up by bidet with water from a stream and hiked off into afield to do my business.. All went well until I started to cover up the cat hole and then it started raining again. I didn’t have my rain jacket zipped up so I got a little wet. Once I had my pack poncho on and put my umbrella back up all was good. 
It was actually fun hiking in the rain and not getting soaked from rain or sweat. 
The rain finally stopped around 2pm. It was still cold and overcast. It was like walking in the clouds. It was windy cold and misty at my secret campsite. The inside of my tent completely dry and the outside was mostly dry.
The weather cleared up after midnight. The skies were clear the stars were out and the temperature dropped down to the lower 30s. 
10 November:  Secret spot to Table Rock State Park. The next morning I felt fine in the cold 30 degree temperature.   While hiking toward Sassafras Mountain I must have hiked into a cold spot because my fingers were hurting. Not just my fingertips but my entire fingers. I had to walk with them stuffed in my pant pockets to get them warm. 
Lessons learned.
I purchased a ZPacks Arc Haul to replace my ULA Circuit.  I wasn’t planning on getting a new pack until I could prove myself worthy after I completed the thru hike. I was washing out the Circuit and noticed many small holes were developing in the fabric.  This is no fault of the pack which is well made. I believe the BearVault I have to carry in the Sierra rubs the fabric and weakens it. The InReach takes a long time to communicate in ravines.Tent pads with a hard sandy base don’t make the best tenting sites. My rain system works great.The clothes that I wore during the 30 degree morning were adequate for breaking camp and enjoying the sunrise while eating breakfast. I wore my hiking clothes with down jacket for insulation and my wind jacket to break the wind.  On my bottoms I wore my Enlightened Equipment wind pants over my hiking pants. Before I start hiking I stow my down jacket and wind pants in my pack. If didn’t II would overheat within minutes. This system has worked down to the mid 20’s in the Sierra.  Practice, practice practice.

Silver Streak ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607036,"My goal is to finish the trail in no more than 117 days.  To accomplish this goal I need to be lucky enough to avoid all of the pitfalls that can disrupt a thru hike.  I also need to be efficient with my resupply strategy.  Whiteblaze and The Trek websites have great information to aid in planning your resupply strategy.   Whiteblaze has a spreadsheet that lists resupply options within one mile of the trail

 I will buy food in towns that are either on the trail or close to the trail.  I will send boxes to areas where the towns may not have a good selection or require a hitch or a shuttle. 
 I will have my wife mail me 10 resupply boxes to hostels or businesses along the trail. This way I don’t have to worry about timing my hike to match post office hours.  Each of my boxes will have 6 days of food.  I know you don’t have to carry this much food on the AT but I don’t want to waste time and money getting into towns.  
 I live in South Carolina and can use regional flat rate boxes to ship my supplies at a significant discount.  I just mailed my first resupply box to the Top Of Georgia Hostel for $10.80 as compared to around $18.00 for the normal flat rate box.  You can order regional boxes free of charge from the USPS website.  
The advantage of a mailed box is I don’t have to waste time shopping and repackaging supplies.  Every hour you waste is 2 to 3 miles you could have hiked. One hour wasted a day over a 100 day hike adds up to 250 to 300 miles.  I can still take an occasional  zero and nero in towns and hostels close to the trail.

The table has a list of each of the locations I have chosen to use for resupply.  Each location is either on the trail or close to a mail from the trail.  I don’t guarantee that my math is correct. I copied and pasted it from a word document.

Silver Streak ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607071,"We arrived at Amicalola Falls State Park around 3:00. I checked in and got my AT tag. I’m hiker number 143. I weighed my pack at home   With winter clothes, microspikes, 5 days of food and water it weighs 34 pounds! Yikes. I took it out for a hike yesterday and it felt fine. Of course that was on a relatively flat swamp trail. I’ll see how it feels hiking up Amicalola Falls approach trail tomorrow. I’ve carried that much weight up the Sierra mountains. It gives you another reason to look forward to eating and getting rid of some weight. 
The approach trail is 8.8 bonus miles to the official AT starting location on Springer Mountain. Nancy (aka Pigpen) will hike up with me and we will probably spend the night camping near the Springer shelter. She is carrying chili, corn chips, and beer for our last dinner together for around 4 months. 
We’re staying in a mini suite at the lodge. It is a great room with its own patio and many windows overlooking the woods. Unfortunately we are in the clouds and the views are limited. We turned on the TV just in time to hear the weather person state that the area was looking at 10 days of rain with flash flooding expected early next week. Ugh. I was hoping to ease into the rain. I just need to remember the thru hiker adage: No Rain, No Pain, No Maine. At least it’s supposed to be clear tomorrow afternoon 


Happy hiking,

Silver Streak ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607139,"We started the Appalachian Trail approach trail at 9:30. The hike up the Amicalola Falls is infamous for it’s strenuous climb up 600 some steps. We didn’t find the climbing too bad because the of the continuous views of the beautiful water fall. 
The rest of the hike up to Springer was enjoyable. The views weren’t spectacular but the forested trail was relaxing and special. 
Nancy and I had fun making up trail names for each other. She likes to hike “slow” and she keeps a steady pace. I heard a podcast about a hiker called Sas for her slow and steady style So we modified Sas to Sass where the last s is like hiss. This stands for Slow and Steady. Compared to most backpackers she really doesn’t hike slow
My new trail name is Sss. It stands for Silver Streak Senior and sounds like a long sssss sound. She used to call me Silver Streak when I did triathlons. It’s appropriate now because I like to hike fast for my age. 
We cracked each other up during the hike using our new trail names.
The weather was perfect all day. It was sunny all day with comfortable temperatures 
We got to Springer Mountain around 2:15. We almost walked past the monument that marks the beginning of the Appalachian Trail for northbound hikers. Only 2192 miles to hike to the finish on Mt Katahdin in Maine. 
We set up camp away from the shelter. I had a couple of drama moments. First off I couldn’t find my trekking poles. I was freaking out because I could have left them at anyone or the possible tent sites I was scouting out. Luckily Nancy found them and saved the day I need my poles to setup my tent. The other thing I lost was a black crossbeam that makes up part of my backpacks support system. Luckily Nancy saved the day again. What will happen to me without her looking out for me 
We had homemade chili, cheese, and corn chips for dinner. Thanks Nancy for carrying 6 pounds of food up to Springer Mountain. 
It started raining fairly hard just after sunset  The forecast is for rain all day tomorrow. We both had a poor nights sleep.

Silver Streak ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607144,"It rained pretty hard last night. I didn’t have the tent poles set high enough so we got a little bit of water inside the tent at the head and foot ends. 
Luckily it stopped raining so we could enjoy our last breakfast together for about 4 months. Biscuits and gravy with hot cocoa. 
We walked back to the AT trail and kissed each other goodbye. It was hard to believe that this was the last moment we’d see each other for a while. We’ve been separated for longer periods when I was in the Navy but those goodbyes seemed more real. 
I expected rain so I started hiking in my full rain getup. Rain kilt, poncho, and jacket to keep my arms warm. I took my kilt off after about a mile and hiked the rest of the day in my shorts. It was windy, cold and misty most of the day but the rain held off. I was mostly comfortable and didn’t sweat. 
The trail was wonderful. It meanders through a variety of mountain habitats. There was plenty of water to drink. I spent all day hiking alone and rarely saw another hiker. 
My dilemma for today was should I stay in the shelter to keep out of the rain or tent to keep away from mice and snoring hikers. I opted for the shelter. Most of the people there were friendly and showed me the ropes of shelter life. 
It started pouring rain at 5 pm and I was glad to have a roof over my head. Two of us had hiking umbrellas and we loaned them out for other hikers to use when they went to the bearbox to store their food or go to the bathroom. 
People started to sleep around 7 so I didn’t get much time for journaling. It didn’t take long for the snoring to commence. I had a terrible night trying to sleep with the cacophony of snoring coming from all sides. On a positive note I stayed dry and the mice didn’t bother anyone.

I want to make sure that everything is organized and I don’t lose anything. This is especially hard in a crowded shelter. The area that I had my gear was still dark when I started packing. By the time I was done most everyone had left. I was pretty disappointed to see the small pieces of trash they left behind. I picked up 2 fuel can plastic covers off of the picnic table. 
Hint for other hikers: mark your smart water bottle and your sit pad. Most hikers have these and it gets confusing trying to figure out which one is yours. 
I finally got going around 8:15. I hiked back up the trail that leads from the shelter to the AT. I took a right on the AT and it didn’t take too long for a little voice to tell me that the sun is in the wrong spot for me to be traveling north. So I checked the Guthook (navigational app) to confirm that I was going the wrong way. 
Today’s hike was full of amazing views. An advantage of an early hike is that the leaves are off the trees. There were rocky outcrops that gave views of mountains going on as far as you could see. It was cold and windy which made for perfect hiking weather. 
The highlight of the day was Blood Mountain. The shelter on top of the mountain is made out of stone. The views were the best of the whole day but it was so windy and cold I couldn’t linger to long. The descent was very tricky. The trail down had a lot of granite slabs made slippery by the water coming out of the mountain. I picked my way down carefully so wouldn’t slip or trip 
Most of the trail has been nearly perfect. The Georgia Appalachian Trail club does a great job maintaining the tread 
The trail has been very similar to the Foothills Trail SC (I’ve been training on) in terms of the level of difficulty 
I made it to Neels Gap around 3:30 and got a cabin at Bood Mountain Cabins. Very nice. They do your laundry for free. 
It’s getting late. I didn’t have time to edit these entries. I have to go outside in the cold to get a good enough signal to upload

I had a great sleep last night at my Blood Mountain cabin. It was nice not having to worry about other hikers. I wanted to sleep in but I knew I had to get hiking. The weather called for highs in the upper 30s and a chance of freezing rain. It was already raining ice pellets outside my cabin. I thought about the wisdom of hiking in those conditions but the conditions could be worse in the Smokey Mountains. So I put my Bad Ass headband on and headed out there to see how I do. 
I got my typical late start and left Mountain Crossings at 9:30 I signed the logbook with the following chant “It doesn’t matter what the weatherman says. AT thru hikers are going hiking anyway.”
I noticed that 3 other hikers had already started this morning. 
I had on my hiking shirt, Marmot Precip rain jacket with the pit zips open and the front zipper unzipped for heat control. Over that I had on my ZPacks poncho. On my legs I had my running shorts and ULA rain kilt. I wore thin running gloves under snowboarding mittens. The whole idea is to provide ventilation so that I can stay comfortably cool. I stayed comfortable with the exception of the windy ridges where my hands and legs would get chilly. If I got too cold I ran 
I have my umbrella set up to attach to my pack for hands free use. It worked great until the wind picked up. 
The bushes and trees had frozen water droplets on them. Once I climbed to a higher elevation I started to notice what appeared to be broken bottle pieces. I couldn’t believe someone would break bottles in such a beautiful area. I eventually figured out that the broken glass was actually ice that had frozen to a tree limb and then fallen onto the trail. 
The trail is wonderful. All day long I’m either going up or down. The only level areas are the ridge lines and they are usually very windy and cold (20s windchill). I could tell that I was missing some outstanding views. 
Early on into the hike I met a young man named Robert. He was born in the Republic of Georgia and he was a Navy SeaBee. We chatted a bit and I told him that my trail name was Silver Streak  At first he thought I was named for my silver colored umbrella and poncho. Later on he told me that he figured out that I was called Silver Streak because I hike fast for an old guy. 
Around 1pm we started having occasional thunder. I picked up my pace and made it to Low Gap Shelter at 2pm. It was early, I’d only done around 11 miles but the next shelter was 7 miles away so I stopped here. 
A couple were already here. They have a YouTube channel documenting their hike. Another hiker named Stalling Bear came in later. 
Everyone settled down for the night around 6:30. 
I plan on hiking to Tray Mountain Shelter tomorrow. Hopefully it’ll be marginally warmer. Lesson learned: keep the pit zips on the windy side closed

I enjoyed my shelter mates last night. No one snored.  This morning was the last I’ll see of them. They are all listening to their bodies and not overdoing it. Several have sore knees from the steep downhills.
Today was just like yesterday with freezing rain. Today had the added bonus of long stretches of ridge line hiking. Normally this would mean great views but when you’re walking in the clouds all you get is gusty winds with windchill in the 20s. It got a little nippy at times especially when you’re wearing running shorts and a kilt. I felt a connection my Scottish ancestors as if I was walking in the highlands in blustery weather. 
The terrain is getting steeper and the climbs longer. The climb out of Unicoi Gap up Rocky Mountain was the hardest so far. The decent was tricky with slippery granite and mud. 
The air is so fresh that it just makes you happy to be hiking no matter how harsh the conditions. 
The trail traveled through many different ecosystems. The day started off walking past numerous cascades that flowed across the trail. Later I was walking through a fern ladenboulder field with rocks and fallen trees covered with thick moss. 
I got to Tray Mountain Shelter around 4pm. The wind was blowing rain into the shelter. 3 hikers were pressed as against the back wall trying to keep their sleeping bags dry. They offered me a spot but my extra body would have made it worse. I went to scout out a safe place to setup my tent out of the wind. All of the established sites were on the ridge exposed to the driving rain. We were right in the path of huge thunderstorms and I was worried about trees or tree limbs falling on me. So I set my tent up right behind the shelter. This protected me from the wind and tree limbs. It seemed like a good spot but soon after I got my tent up rain poured down and a low spot quickly filled with water and a puddle appeared under my tent.  The bathtub floor of my old Duplex allowed water to seep through and I had to devise a way to keep my sleeping bag dry. I was wishing that I had brought my Tarptent. I’m confident that it would have kept me dry in any puddle because it has. I called Nancy to whine about my problem I might have her mail it to me in Damascus Virginia. 
The only good thing about Tray Mountain Shelter was I got 3 bars on T-Mobile. One more story about the shelter. As I was pitching my tent I noticed one Crock the ugly shoes that was made uglier because it had a mouse trap with a dead mouse in it. Why are some people so disrespectful and leave gross stuff like that for other people to see. 
Lesson learned:  Even though the temperature has been in the 30s with windchills in the 20s my feet have stayed warm while hiking. One of the joys of hiking is putting cold wet shoes on in the morning. It’s not that bad. I even put on my wet socks.

Today’s weather was drizzling but on the warm side with temperatures in the mid 50s. The hike to the trailhead for Hiawassee was only 11 miles. I was occasionally above the clouds and could see miles of mountain peaks poking up through the clouds. It looked like a bunch of islands surrounded by a sea of gray. 
The trail consisted of the typical AT hiking pattern; climb up a mountain, walk a ridge line and then descend. Repeat this pattern until you stop. The hardest climb was Kelly Knob. The only person I saw was Cheese (her trail name). She stayed in the shelter last night. On the way down the final mountain I discovered that the tips of my trekking poles had broken off. I can still use them but they will not work as well and might wear out before I can get them replaced. 
I got to the trailhead and had to hike another 0.5 bonus miles to the Top of Georgia Hostel where I was going to pick up my first resupply box. They are called bonus because they are off the AT and don’t count toward your total mileage.
I was the first hiker at the hostel. . The people that work there are extremely friendly and the place is super clean. As I was checking in they asked me if I wanted my laundry done. At first I said no because it had only been 2 days since I had them cleaned at Neels Gap. I thought that only my socks were filthy but the longer I stood there talking the more I became aware of my hiker stench. 
I hung up my tent outside and used this special microfiber towel to wipe off the filth. I had a room all to myself so I was able to hang up all of my wet gear to dry. I used a large oscillating fan to speed up the process. 
After taking care of my gear I took a shower and had to scrub my ankles and feet extra hard to get them clean. 
The hostel provides their guests a free shuttle to Hiawassee. The driver’s name was Vagabond and she has hiked the AT 3 times. She is in her late 70s and still going strong. She dropped me off at a Mexican restaurant that had great food. I had what I think was called the Muy Hombre (spelling?) and a 32 ounce beer. On the way back to the hostel we stopped at Dairy Queen for an Oreo Blizzard. I can’t believe that I ate so much. 
When I got back to the hostel Cheese and Guiding Light were there. Guiding Light is Ukrainian but now lives in Florida. Her toenails are giving her problems. 
The rest of the night was spent moving gear around to get dry, organizing my food and then packing up. 
They have breakfast at 7 and the shuttle to the trail leaves at 8. I made sure I got up early so I could eat, finish packing up and take care of bathroom stuff. I was pretty pleased with myself to be getting on the 8:00 shuttle because I can’t seem to leave camp before 9:00. As we head down the driveway the driver tells everyone to check and make sure you have everything. I couldn’t find my Inreach satellite communication device. I was in panic mode because those things are expensive and good for emergencies. I had to get off the shuttle and unpack my gear. I finally found it in my clothes bag. What a relief. 
I had to wait for the 9:00 shuttle.  To be continued in tomorrow’s journal entry. 
One of my favorite pieces of gear is my full size buff. It keeps my ears warm in the cold wind.","Tray Mountain

They say that the trail provides you what you need. One year while hiking the JMT my shoes were falling apart. I found the exact same shoe in my size in a hiker box at the Mt Williamson Motel and Basecamp. Last year I found a good pair of sun gloves in a hiker box to replace the gloves that I got dropped off at the trailhead and it was raining. There was one of those information kiosks with just enough room to keep me dry while I put on my rain gear. I looked down and what did I see? A rubber trekking pole tip. Yeah. There was only one but unless I’m going up a steep hill I only use one pole. So the trail provided again. 
Today I hiked most of the day in very hard rain. It might not have been freezing rain but it was still cold on the ridges At least it wasn’t freezing rain. It was very slow going today. The climbs seemed to be a lot steeper and longer. It could have been all of the town food I had that was making me sluggish or perhaps I was having an off day. I normally average 2.5 mph including breaks but today I only averaged 2 mph. The descents were treacherous because the muddy path was slippery. It reminded me of that song “I feel the earth move under my feet”. I picked my way very cautiously down the mountains. 
There were a lot of pretty streams crossing the trail. Sometimes the trail became a stream. The trail traveled through areas of dense rhododendrons. The Georgia Appalachian Trail club has done amazing work keeping the trail passable. 
I passed the sign that marks the border between Georgia and North Carolina. Georgia provides bear cables to hang your food bags out of the reach of most bears. North Carolina doesn’t so if you don’t have a bear canister or Ursack you have to hang your food bag in a tree. 
I was wanting to go around 16 miles to the Standing Indian Shelter but there have been reports of a Yogi Bear stealing food there. Apparently the bear climbs the tree where hikers hang their food and then jumps on the bags knocking them down. Between the bear activity and the hard hiking conditions I decided to stop at Muskrat Shelter. 
I hadn’t seen anyone else today so I only expected to see Cheese there. I was surprised to see 6 hikers there. They offered to make room for me. I really didn’t want to deal with shelter life so I went in search of a campsite that wasn’t going to be a puddle. I found a piece of high ground surrounded by muck and puddles. 
At 5:00 everyone in the shelter were already in their sleeping bags. I cooked dinner and filtered water in the shelter. I noticed that their food bags were hanging up in the shelter’s awning. I hope that the  mice don’t get into their food. Tonight is the first time on the trail when I had to tie my Ursack to a tree. Hopefully a bear won’t come by and gnaw on it. The Ursack is made of bulletproof vest type of material and is supposed to keep bears and mice out of your food. A hiker at the hostel said that he had a bear gnaw on his bag and ruined his food. 
I tied the Ursack off to a nearby tree. I placed some rocks on top of it so I could hear if a bear was messing with it. I also collected some small rocks that I could throw to scare away a bear. I’m a light sleeper when I’m camping. At 2 in the morning I heard a loud noise that sounded like something large had fallen. I flashed my headlamp light towards my bag and it seemed undisturbed. I got out of my tent to check it and the rocks were still there.

16.2 miles
I’m turning into a real dirt bag hiker. As I was putting on my cold wet shoes and socks I noticed that my socks were still muddy from yesterday. I didn’t want to unpack everything just to get clean socks to wear. They would just get wet and filthy as soon as I put my shoes on anyway. So I thought what the heck and put on the dirty socks.
I hiked in the fog all day. It was cool with the temperatures in the low 40s and not much wind-chill with the exception of the exposed ridges. There would have been some great views on a clear day  There was only one long climb up Standing Indian Mountain which has an elevation of 5500 feet. The trail has a section where many trees have blown over and blocked the trail. You either had to crawl under a tree or take a temporary side trail to pass. 
A group of weekend hikers came passed me going the opposite direction.  One of the hikers jokingly told me to “embrace the suck”. This is a common expression used by AT hikers to deal with wet weather. This guy thought hiking in a little fog was unpleasant, he should have been out here during the freezing rain.
 I prefer to say “Embrace the Adventure” it’s more positive. Another thing I say to myself is that everything is temporary. The hard climb will be over, the gusty cold wind will stop when I get off the ridge and the weather will eventually get better. 
My brand new high tech backpack is giving me problems. The suspension system consists of horizontal bars and vertical rods. All of these parts used to fit snugly until my pack became saturated from 6 days of rain and fog. The horizontal bars keep popping out and make it impossible to adjust the pack correctly. I hate to waste valuable hiking time messing around trying to fix my pack. The middle bar came loose and fell somewhere on the trail. Equipment problem are bound to happen and are just part of the adventure. 
I almost had a hike ending accident. I setup camp at Betsy Creek Gap. I found a spot tucked away in bushes that appeared to have good drainage. There is a creek to get water nearby. I took off my gross wet shoes and put on my sandals. I went down to the creek to get water and I slipped on a root and injured my big toe. It bleed for a long time. I used my first aid kit to clean it up and I put a large bandage on it. The bandage stopped the bleeding. It doesn’t hurt too much so I hope it will be better tomorrow. This incident reminded me of how important it is to be careful.
It’s 8:45 pm and it started raining again. It supposed to be a nice day tomorrow. 
Two more miles to finish my first 100 miles of the AT 
It rained hard last night The wind came in strong gusts that you could hear roaring up the Gap. Then it would hit and the trees would thrash about and some trees would squeak as if they were ready to break in half and fall on my tent. My tent kept me mostly dry.  The air has that earthy smell of wet leaves

It’s 8pm and I’m huddled under my sleeping bag trying to keep myself and my phone warm. I’m at 5300 feet and there is a wind advisory. My wet socks started to freeze an hour ago so I stuffed them in my backpack with my shoes. Not only is the wind cold but it could knock dead limbs from trees or even blow over an entire tree. I leaned on a small tree today and pushed it over. I can hear a creaking tree right now. 
What a difference a sunny day makes. All morning I was singing the song “It’s going to be a bright bright sunshiny day”. 
The views were great today. The Appalachian mountains have there own special beauty. The hike took me through some magical areas. I even got to walk through streams that didn’t have any rocks to hop. 
The first climb was up Albert Mountain. The climb was short but very steep. My efforts were rewarded on the summit because of a beautiful view and the 100 AT miles hiked sign. Only 2092 mile to Katahdin. 
I met several hikers today. A guy from Colorado has the trail name “Urgent Cat Hole”. A hikers cat hole has the same function as a cat’s cat hole 
Most of today was easy. The uphills had strenuous sections but they didn’t last too long 
I filled up my water at a peaceful little stream. I sat there in the sun eating lunch enjoying the sounds of the rushing water and the fresh air. 
I was hiking along one section focusing on my rhythm and the wind blew a little branch off a tree and it hit me in the head. I’m glad it wasn’t a big branch. 
I saw my first Bald today. It was very weird. Your hiking up this mountain with trees everywhere and then you pop up on a large flat field. 
Towards the end of the day I came up behind a hiker and I tried to say hello to get his attention so that he could let me pass. I got no response. The poor guy was having a meltdown. He was actually crying and whining the whole way up the mountain. The climb wasn’t even that hard. I waited for a wide spot in the trail and ran past him. I felt sorry for him and was also concerned that he would end up camping where I was heading. I didn’t want to camp alone with a mental person. I saw his friends later and they said he was having a tough time. One guy was going to drop his pack and head down to help him out. They never made it to this campsite. 
I’m at Wine Spring campsite. There’s a shooting range nearby. The place is still muddy from all the rain. I talked with a local and he said that these were record setting rains. 
I got my first Trail Magic this afternoon. A young man that thru hiked the AT last year was packing in fruit to give to this year’s aspiring thru hikers. I enjoyed a juicy orange. 
I thought today’s hike was going to be 18 miles but it ended up being 20!  I felt strong the whole day. The toe I injured yesterday felt okay and only hurt a little towards the end of the day. 
I just braved going outside to pee and was rewarded with a beautiful night sky full of bright stars.

Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-ay My, oh, my, what a wonderful day Plenty of sunshine headin' my way Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-ay!…
What a difference sunshine makes. I find myself singing little positive songs like this to myself all morning. It will put pep in your step. 
Last night was the coldest night I’ve ever spent. The temperature was 23 degrees but the winds were roaring from all directions. The wind-chill must have been in the teens. 
When you sleep in a tent you need to allow for air flow or the water from your breath will cause water drops to collect inside your tent’s roof and drop down on your sleeping bag. This is called condensation. If the down feathers get wet they lose their insulating properties. One of my fears is to be stuck in the wilderness with a wet sleeping bag. You can lower the tent to decrease the amount of air coming in. 
Urgent Cat Hole had his tent buttoned up to keep out the wind. He got lots of condensation but it froze to his roof. 
I had a choice get a wet bag or deal with cold wind blowing into the tent. I lowered the tent more than normal but some of the cold wind gusts could still get in. The wind goes into your sleeping bag and ruins the warm air that the feathers trapped. I wore all my clothes. On top I had a thermal shirt, hiking shirt, Patagonia R3 fleece, down jacket, wind jacket, rain jacket, ski baklava, beanie and snowboarding gloves. I had similar clothes on the bottom. I kept waking up with slight shivering. Once I woke up I’d have to go pee because that’s what cold does to me. The positive part of going outside to pee in frigid temperatures was the beautiful night sky. 
It was reassuring to discover that my 3 year old ZPacks Duplex can still hold its own in a major windstorm. 
Around 2:00 in the morning I heard this crackling noise. I tried to ignore it because you hear all sorts of night sounds. Then I got to thinking that a bear was trying to get into my Ursack food bag I had tied to a nearby tree. I fumbled around until I found my headlamp and shined it toward my bag. Luckily no bear. Later on I realized that I was hearing the sound of ice forming inside my water bottle. 
I had placed my stinky shoes and socks inside the tent with me in the hopes that they wouldn’t freeze. They did. During breakfast I sat on my shoes and stuffed the socks under my shirt to try and dry them out. The shoes got pliable enough for me to get my feet inside. The socks were still stiff so I used a clean pair. 
The grass and other low lying vegetation had these beautiful feathery looking ice crystals formations covering them. Most of the trail at high elevations had this. There was one short section where ice covered the trail. 
Urgent Cat Hole told me that this famous trail angel was going to be serving food at one of the road crossings. While hiking down the mountain I started smelling bacon. I don’t even eat bacon but I’d enjoy some pancakes and eggs. I got to the road and nothing. So why was I smelling bacon?  I think the cool fresh air and the forest triggered memories of family camping trips which wouldn’t be complete without bacon and eggs cooked on a two burner Coleman gas stove 
Lots of views to enjoy today. There is a very interesting rock tower on Wayah Bald. There was also an observation tower on Wesser Bald. The trail down from Wesser Bald to the NOC had numerous blowdowns blocking the trail. In some cases you had to get down on your hands and knees to crawl under the tree trunk. 
I got to the NOC outfitter less than 5 minutes before they closed. The staff was very friendly and more than happy to stay open to help a hiker. They even helped me replace my damaged Leiki trekking pole tips. 
I have to offer a shoutout to ZPacks customer service. I’ve contacted about at least 3 concerns and they get back to me within 24 hours and offer sound advice. They don’t try to brush you off or make excuses for a problem that I think I’m having with my gear. 2 of the 3 concerns were user error on my part. The most recent issue was with my Arc Haul fabric loosening up during 6 days of rain which allowed my middle horizontal support to fall out while I was hiking. They are going to send me a replacement to me up the trail. 
Tomorrow I leave for Fontana Dam to pick up a resupply box on the 27th. Then I head out in more rain to enjoy the sights and challenges of The Great Smoke Mountain National Park. It’s supposed to get cold again and might snow! Let the adventure continue. I hope that I’m up for challenge.

Brown Fork Gap Shelter: 16.2 miles
The AT took me behind the woodshed and gave me a whipping. 
In my opinion, the climb up out of the NOC was a butt kicker. It relentlessly challenged my endurance and teased my mind. Iwould get to a flat spot or even a downhill and think that I was at the top. Nope not even close. It was the climb that kept on going. It took me about 2.5 hours to finally get to the top. 
The last 2.5 miles of my day consisted of a grueling steep climb up from the parking area at Stecoah Gap to the Brown Fork Gap Shelter at mile 152.9.There were times when  I felt like I was walking as slow as the people climbing up the last section of Mt Everest. 
The Brown Fork Gap Shelter is missing about 2 feet of floor. There was only one other hiker named Raven (some sports team). I had read on the Guthook navigation app that there was a campsite down by the creek. I don’t like shelters so I setup my camp there. It’s not very flat and I have the feeling that I'll be sliding down towards the bottom of the tent a lot tonight. 
The trail looks the same as every other day. The trees are still leafless and rather bleak.  The trail is covered with dry leaves. There are sections of perfectly smooth trail and sections with trip hazards like roots and large rocks. Less frequently there are trees that have blown down and are blocking the trail.
I had lots of opportunities for views today. Most of the views look the same. You see rugged green mountains as far as the eye can see. Occasionally you’ll see a river or a lush valley that usually has a farm in it. It smells like a forest and it peaceful and quiet. 
Prior to today I was a JMT (John Muir Trail) snob. Nothing thus far was even close to the difficulty of the climbs you get on the JMT. Well the AT slapped me in the face and knocked me off my high horse today. To put today’s level of difficulty in the perspective of a JMT hiker, today was like climbing up out of Lyell Canyon up to Donahue Pass or for PCT northbound JMT hikers it was like climbing from Woods Creek suspension bridge to Pinchot Pass. 
I appreciated the challenge that the AT gave me. When I was training for the Hawaiian Ironman I’d drive an hour to ride steep hills to get me ready for the Kona bike course. I’d do this almost every Sunday and I loved the challenging hills. The steeper the better. Every week the my legs would get stronger and the hills would get just a little bit easier. So I’m one of those weird athletes who love to suffer. As the Marines say: “What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger “
I have several things I like to do to keep me motivated and maintain a positive attitude. I frequently give the white blazes marked on the trees a fist bump and say thank you AT. I’m thankful for the beauty of the trail, the volunteers that do their best to keep the trail clear of all the trees that fall on it and I’m thankful for the privilege to hike it. 
I’ve already mentioned that I don’t like the phrase Embrace the Suck. I prefer Embrace the Adventure. Another AT hiker phrase is PUDs or Pointless Ups and Downs. The trail is constantly going either up or down but there is a huge point to them. How else are you going to get to Katahdin without walking up and down hundreds of mountains. So I came up with a new phrase; TKUPs which stands for To Katahdin Ups and Downs. Southbound hikers can say TSUPs for To Springer. 
I also have two chants that I made up. They are fashioned from chants called Jodys that I sang while running in formation at my Navy Diving and Explosive Ordnance Disposal schools.  Anyone who’s been in the military knows what I’m talking about. The leader sings a verse and then everyone else repeats it.

(I got this last part from the Hiking Viking’s “Between the Blazes” YouTube video series. The best AT video that I have watched
Lesson learned: When I hike up a steep hill I don’t like to look too far ahead so I don’t get discouraged with the distance I have to go before the incline starts to level out. So I was hiking up this very steep hill with my head down looking at the trail and trying to keep up my rhythm when I ran head first into a large branch that was just above my eyesight. I hit the tree hard with my forehead and was lucky that I didn’t break my glasses. 
There is a 20% chance of rain tonight and it just started sprinkling. Tomorrow I’ll be warm and comfortable (unless I eat too much) at the Fontana Village  On Thursday I’ll be hiking out to enter The Great Smoky Mountain National Park. I’m very excited. It might even snow this weekend.

I apologize for the short post today but town days are busy and it’s late 
My legs felt a little heavy today due to the challenging climbs yesterday. I got to Fontana Crossing around 12:30 and used the phone by the bathroom to call the Fontana Lodge for a shuttle. They didn’t have anyone to pick me up so I got to hike at least 2 bonus miles to the lodge. The hike was mostly up steep the steep highway. The kind of grade that they put highway markers on to warn truckers. 
The rest of the day was used to organize my resupply box contents and call family members. They don’t have guest laundry machines and I didn’t feel like walking to the laundromat so I did my laundry in the tub. I had washed my clothes yesterday at the NOC but my socks were filthy. 
Tomorrow I head out in the rain to hike the Smokies  I’m very excited for this upcoming adventure. It might even snow.","Brown Fork Gap Shelter

19.4 AT miles plus a bonus 1.5 road walk is not too shabby for a man going on 66  
The Fontana Lodge doesn’t offer a shuttle back to the trail until 8:30. I wanted to get an early start so I set the alarm for 5:30 and was ready to go by 6:30. That is until I did a last minute equipment check. My Inreach was missing again. Panic pack explosion and I still couldn’t find it. I looked under all of the beds and under the sheets and still nothing. Then I noticed that the drapes were closed. Sure enough it was on the floor behind the drapes. By the time I repacked everything it was 7:15. I was lucky that I checked. 
I started my 2 mile plus road walk and was happy that it was mostly downhill. I heard a car coming so I stuck out my thumb to no avail. After about 1.5 miles I heard a second car coming around a bend. I looked back and saw a small bright red sports car. I decided not to even try so I turned around and kept walking. To my surprise the VW bug stopped and a woman asked me if I wanted a ride. Of course I said yes. She was heading to meet a friend for a short backpacking trip. Molly was a really nice lady. We chatted away about backpacking and somehow I got her on the wrong road and we had to turn around. I had to use my Guthook app to get us headed in the correct direction. She was a great sport about it and insisted on taking me where I needed to go. It was now 8:05 which put me at least 35 minutes ahead of when the shuttle would have dropped me off. 
It was about a 3 miles walk along Fontana Lake to get to the trailhead that takes you into the Smokies. 
The first 10 mile hike up into the Smokies had some strenuous climbs. There were a lot of trees and bushes that had fallen and were blocking the trail. I talked with a Ridge Runner (works for the AT organization) and a volunteer trail maintainer. They said that the trail got easier after the Mollies Ridge Shelter. They said that volunteers normally get out in January to start clearing the trail but they couldn’t get out early this year because of the government shutdown. 
It was supposed to rain all day but luckily it only sprinkled and then the fog came in. 
I made it to Spence Field Shelter at 4:00. I was the first one here. It’s a large double decker. The water source has a rusty pipe that I didn’t want to use. They were all sorts of bear warnings posted on Guthook. 
One other hiker named Don’t Care  showed up later. He’s a flip flooper that is still trying to finish up last years hike. 
Tomorrow will be a day of highlights so I hope that the rain stops. Clingmans Dome is the highest point on the AT and marks the 200 mile mark.  The Smokies have been nice but I can’t say that I’ve seen anything different than I have for the last 12 Days. Last night we were in the clouds with off and on rain.
I’m concerned about the frigid weather coming this way. Lows are forecast to be in the teens to the single digits. I might need to spend a couple of nights in Hot Springs.

Last nights stay at Spence Field Shelter was uneventful. No bears or rodents bothered us. Of course it was so foggy that a bear could have been standing right next to me when I went outside to pee in the middle of the night that I couldn’t have seen it. The worst part was when we took off our stinky wet filthy shoes and socks. They gave the place quite the aroma. Just think what the shelter would smell like with 12 dirty hikers. This morning I could just barely make out where the bear cables were. It was difficult but I managed to find the correct tree that the cables attach to.  After I retrieved my food bag I headed back in the direction of the shelter. I kept running into brambles. Don’t Care, the other person in the shelter coughed so I turned in that direction and could just barely make out the shelter’s roof. 
I had wanted to make it to Clingmans Dome which marks the 200 mile point and is also the highest point on the AT. The weather and the trail double teamed me and I fell 2.8 miles short. I had plenty of time to get to Clingmans but then I’d have to hike another 3 miles to the next shelter. On a normal day I would have kept pushing but this was no normal day 
It was raining hard when I started and it continued to rain all day. I had on all my rain gear and stayed dry. The big problem was that all of the rain we’ve been having saturated the ground and the trail became a slippery muddy mess. It’s easy to tell where rocks and roots are to keep from tripping but a perfectly good section of trail could become a skating rink in an instant. These conditions made for slow going on the descents. I slipped numerous times and fell more times than I can remember. My worst accident happened when I tripped with my left foot and stepped on the edge of the trail with my right foot. The edge of the trail gave way and I fell down and slid about 5 feet down the slope. I grabbed a tree to stop myself. My back still hurts. Needless to say I was a wet, muddy, and battered hiker.   
The majority of uphills seemed very steep, which also slowed my pace considerably. It was quite an ordeal. I did my best to just make it through the day in one piece. 
The good thing about not making it up Glingmans Dome today is there wouldn’t have been any views. It’s not supposed to rain tomorrow so maybe I’ll get to see something. 
I got to the Double Spring Shelter around 3:30 and called it a day. 
It might get below freezing tonight so I will need to put my water filter and electronics in my sleeping bag with me. 
Something just went running across the roof of the shelter. I guess the mice are coming out to play. I have the shelter to myself.","Spence Field Shelter

Silver Streak ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607552,"Day 14Pecks Corner Shelter: 21 milesThe Smokies was a gift that kept on giving. I didn’t know it at the time but I was lucky that yesterday was such a slog in the pouring rain.  If it wasn’t for the truly treacherous conditions and trying to keep myself upright in the mud and slippery rocks I might have hiked past Clingmans Dome and missed the most glorious view of the hike.
I got to Clingmans Dome around 8;40 and I had the place all to myself. The morning air was clear of afternoon haze which made for perfect viewing conditions.  The peaks of the mountains were floating in a sea of white clouds. I guess this is why they are called the Smokies. 
All day I was hiking through a forest of huge ancient conifers. I think they were spruce or fur trees. The forest floor was covered with emerald moss that grew on the downed trees and the soil. I got water from a spring that emptied right out of the mountain. This is what I dreamed the Smokies would be like. I’m so fortunate to have had this day. 
The trail by Clingmans Dome has some sections of ice. Other sections were still wet and demanded utmost attention on my part to keep from falling. For me the downhills always seem to be the most treacherous. Today I was chugging up a moderate hill and I stepped on a slick root and fell forward. My left knee hit another root hard. I laid there in pain mad at myself and the roots. I didn’t want my hike to end this way.  I got up and started hiking. It didn’t feel too bad. I was thankful that I didn’t get injured. When I got to camp after my 21 mile day I could feel it stiffening up. Hopefully, it will be fine in the morning. 
Today was just my lucky day. I got to Newfound Gap around 12:30. There’s a big parking area for tourists to day hike up to Charlie’s Bunion. I was dumping my trash when a man came over and asked if I was thru hiking the AT. I said yes and he asked me if I wanted some snacks or something to eat. I said yes but I couldn’t stay long because I still had a long way to go. He took me over to a van that had a sign “Fresh Ground’s Leapfrog Cafe”. Well Fresh Ground is one of the most famous Trail Angels on the AT. His friends name was Joker. They started offering me all sorts of snacks and apples. I enjoyed some junk food that I normally would never eat. He then offered to help me get my pack to fit better. He adjusted all manner of straps and duct taped some of the straps so they wouldn’t move out of adjustment. I’ve been backpacking for 5 years and I never really understood how to adjust my pack correctly. It was 1:30 when I left and now I was running behind schedule but it was time well spent. Those 2 men were doing all of this for free to help out thru hikers. What a pair of wonderful guys 
My next stop was Charlie’s Bunion. It is a pair of rock formations that look like big bumps on the mountainside. The views of the Smokies were just okay because the afternoon haze had settled in 
I met 3 young men who were out for a weekend backpacking trip  They told me that a ridge runner had told them that part of the trail had just closed due to a landslide. I hadn’t heard of a closure and had talked to a different ridge runner earlier and he didn’t mention it. At first I continued north hoping for the best but it was getting late and I was getting bummed out. I didn’t want to get another 4 miles down the trail and then have to turn back to the previous shelter. So I turned around and headed south. Luckily within a few hundred yards I saw the men again and showed them my Guthook map. They were confused and said it was a different trail that was closed. 
Relieved that my perfect day wasn’t spoiled I happily took off for my final destination. I passed the ridge runner on the way. She is also staying at the Peck Corner shelter tonight. There was another hiker at the shelter when I got there at 6:00. It stays light until almost 7 but I hate getting in so late and trying to get organized in the dark. It’s 9:15 and another hiker just got here The other two hikers were already asleep. 
I have 23 miles to hike to get to Standing Bear Hostel tomorrow. Then I’ll make a plan on what to do about the dangerously cold weather coming in 2 days. Single digit temperature aren’t for me especially combined with wet trail which will turn into ice. I brought my Kathoola ice spikes with me but the trail has been tricky enough dealing with slippery mud slides and slick roots. I am prepared to hike in cold temperatures but my sleep system isn’t going to keep me warm in single digit temperatures plus wind-chill.

Silver Streak ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607588,"AT day 15  Standing Bear Hostel  23.3 miles
Today marks the 2 week anniversary of my AT adventure. I said goodbye to my wife on 17 February from Springer Mountain and hiked north into the unknown.
I have 23 miles to hike today so I can get to Standing Bear Hostel and avoid the frigid cold front coming our way. The forecast for the high elevations is calling for a high of 24, low of 8 with wind-chill of -10. I’m concerned about the hikers stuck in shelters. I know that they have tarps across the openings but the Double Spring Shelter didn’t have tarps covering the upper deck opening and it’s in an area exposed to the wind.
I already discovered that my sleep system has a 20 degree limit. I kept waking up cold while tenting at Wine Spring camping area during a 23 degree night with howling winds blowing into my tent. So I don’t want to have anything to do with single digit temperatures with negative wind-chill. 
I got up early because someone was making noises for some unknown reason. I hated to disturb the other hikers but I needed to get going. It’s not easy for me to get packed up in the daylight so packing up in a dark shelter was a nightmare. It started off bad when I hit my head on the ceiling beam. You don’t have much headroom in a shelter. Then any light sleeper had to endure the sleeping bag unzipping, the swoosh of air escaping my air mattress, followed by a series of noises associated with stuffing gear into sacks. I took everything outside to pack up. 
I left as soon as it was light enough to see the trail. The morning weather was perfect for hiking. I got to enjoy some more of those fantastic views 
The trail was pretty much like any day in the Smokies. You climb a mountain that is just steep enough to slow you down, get your heart rate up and warm you up. The uphills are followed by a ridge walk which is windy and cold but this is where you pause to take in nature’s beauty. Then the treacherous downhill starts. It’s steep enough that you need to use trekking poles to slow your pace as you negotiate ankle twisting roots and rocks. I swear that some rocks and roots jump up out of nowhere to trip me. Sometimes broken sticks fly up and jab me in my foot or calf. I’m not complaining, it’s all part of my adventure. If it was easy they’d call it football instead of hiking. 
As I was rushing out of the Smokies to escape the weather, I encountered several college students on spring break heading up. I told one young couple that they were true Bad Asses. I thought that I was a badass for hiking in freezing rain, these kids were taking it to a new level. 
I stopped at Cosby Knob Shelter to get water around 11:30. Most of the shelters have pipes in a spring that channels the water to make it easier for hikers to collect water. It started to rain and the rain would continue all day. 
I had an odd experience that happened while I was squatting down by the pipe collecting water in my bag. I felt like I was observing myself and how wonderful it must be to be that hiker, alone in his rain gear, collecting water from such a wonderful place. Maybe it was the endorphins my brain was putting out, like a long distance runner gets runner’s high during a marathon or long distance workout. 
I also had an ethical dilemma. I had stopped for a quick break to send out an Inreach message to let my family know where I was and that I was still alive. I had to take my wet hiking glove off and placed it on the ground. I took a Cliff bar out of my hip belt pocket and continued cautiously downhill while I ate the bar. I finished the bar and stuffed the wrapper in my pocket and then noticed that I was missing my right glove. So, should I leave the glove which was falling apart and would probably be useless in a few days anyway, or climb back up that steep mountain and get it. Leave No Trace is a hiker ethic that essentially means leave the trail as if you were never there. I decided to go back up for my glove partly because I didn’t want to disrespect the trail but also because I figured it couldn’t have taken me very long to eat my Cliff bar. I found it exactly where I left it. I have lost numerous gloves this way and have a small collection of left handed gloves. I simply turn a left hand glove inside out and I have a right glove. The one that I went back for was an inside out glove. 
For some reason GPS on Guthook wasn’t working very well. I stopped to check where the next water source was and Guthook was showing me down slope and well off the AT. I passed several branch side trails but I always check for a white blaze to confirm that I’m going in the correct direction. I continued on, scanning every tree for a white blaze. I had been going downhill for a long time and really would have been bummed out to have to turn around in the cold rain to find the trail. I stopped and checked Guthook again. This time it showed me upslope from the trail. I figured something was wrong with the GPS but I still had a nagging feeling that maybe I wasn’t on the AT. After what seemed to be an eternity without seeing a single white blaze I finally came to a trail junction sign and a white blaze. I literally wrapped my arms around the sign and gave it a hug. 
Once you get over Mt Cammerer, the next 7 miles to I-40 is essentially downhill. This could be a good place to makeup time if the trail was dry and you watched your step. However I had to slow my pace as the trail became waterlogged and slippery.
I finally arrived at Davenport Gap, the northern boundary of the national park and the place that you deposit your permit in a box. Goodbye Smokies and thank you for the adventure. 
The trail leads you through a section of forest with cascading water that spills out on the path. I didn’t even bother rock hopping (wet rocks are slick rocks) I just waded across the stream Sierra Nevada style and got the mud washed off my shoes. 
You cross a bridge over the Pigeon River and follow the white blazes that are painted on the road’s guardrails to an on-ramp for I-40. I made a slight error here that I blame on mental exhaustion from getting up so early and physical exhaustion from pounding out the miles. The interstate also has posts with white reflective tape. I blindly followed these interstate markers up the on-ramp. I finally thought how odd that they allow hikers on interstates. So I stopped and looked back and saw a white blaze on the road going under the freeway. 
Soon I found myself climbing some steep steps up from the road back into the forest. Once I got up the steps I saw trail magic. A long haul trucker named Doghouse left baggies full of food hikers love  Doghouse tied the baggies to a rope and tied the rope off to a tree. This trail magic sure did lift my spirits and help make the remaining distance I had to go more enjoyable. 
I got to the Standing Bear Hostel at 4 o’clock. I had been hiking since 6:45. 23 miles, at least half of it in the rain and all I wanted was a warm shower and good food. The place is very interesting. The two men that were manning the place were very helpful and extremely patient with me in my exhausted state. After they showed me around I decided that I wanted a little more comfort and amenities to wait out the freezing temperatures headed this way. They understood and I paid them to shuttle me to Newport Tennessee.
I’m staying at the Quality Inn. It has great rates, an indoor pool with hot tub and is conveniently located near a Walmart and Cracker Barrel restaurant. There are plenty of fast food restaurants nearby. 
I’m staying here until the frigid temperatures pass. I will be heading back to the AT either Wednesday or Thursday morning. I’m actually a day ahead of where I thought I’d be. I’d rather be a little behind and bored than shivering all night in a shelter or my tent. 
I’m sorry that I didn’t take any pictures today. I had miles to hike and my phone doesn’t like to get wet.","Pecks Corner Shelter

Frigid weather Zero day 1
Two escape several days of extremely cold weather, I’m hunkered down at the Quality Inn in Newport, Tennessee. As I mentioned earlier my sleep system won't keep me warm below 20 degrees.  The weather is calling for teens with negative wind-chill temperatures.  I don't mind hiking in frigid weather but I don't like to shiver in my bag at night.  I went to Walmart to pick up supplies and food to eat in the hotel. 
I’m going to describe what my typical day on the AT is like. Every day is pretty much the same. 
I wake up without an alarm and psych myself up for getting out of my warm sleeping bag. 
I slowly get changed and pack up my gear. The most unpleasant thing is putting on my cold, wet and stinky socks and shoes. 
I retrieve my food bag and eat my secret weapon breakfast of chia seeds, protein powder, flavored oats, coffee, and walnuts. All of these ingredients are soaked together overnight in a jar. The result is a delicious pudding packed with nutrients. I also drink a whole bottle of vanilla tea to hydrate myself and get an extra caffeine kick. 
Next I make a deposit at the privy or a cat hole. 
Then I just start walking north. Exciting isn’t it. 
I always start with a slow pace to warm up my muscles. The older I get the longer it takes to start feeling loose and fluid. 
Years of triathlon training have taught me how to listen to signals that my body is sending. I’m constantly monitoring for any unusual pain or muscle tightness. Whenever I feel a pain or strain that persists for more than a few strides I stop and stretch. Stretching normally works. I have several key stretches that I’ve learned over the years. Sometimes it’s just a matter of changing my stride length or posture. 
I don’t stop to eat. I eat every 2 hours while I hike. I eat a Kind Bar, then a Nature Valley bar and finally a Cliff Bar. I have a snack bag filled with Worther Originals and Gobstoppers to enjoy. I start looking for a water source around noon. While I filter water I’ll eat 2 tablespoons of chocolate peanut butter. I chug a whole bottle of water (called cameling up) and then put an Amazing Grass tablet in the bottle I will hike with. If it’s hot and it is going to be a long dry stretch I’ll fill up another bottle. One 750 ml water bottle weighs about 2 pounds so it’s a trade off between carrying extra weight or losing time to filter water. No matter what the locals say about spring water being safe to drink, I’m going to filter all of my water. 
The rest of the story is just hiking up and down mountains. Some climbs are easy others make you work hard. Same thing with the descents. Some are so smooth I can jog down then, while others are technically difficult and require me to step carefully and use trekking poles to keep my balance and to slow myself down. 
I try to get to camp with at least an hour of daylight remaining. I setup my tent and then cook a hot meal. Dinners consists of food that you bring to a boil and then let sit in an insulated cozy for 20 minutes. While I wait for my food to soak I blow up my sleeping pad, shake my sleeping bag to fluff up the down and filter more water. After dinner I hang my Ursack food bag if there are bear cables or tie it to a tree. Finally I try to recall the highlights of my day and record them in my journal. 
So what keeps me going day after day doing the same thing? Why don’t I get bored?  Throughout the day I will try to use all of my senses to immerse myself in nature. There is always something special to discover even in the pouring rain. 
I also see my journey as an athletic challenge. At home I love to work out and push myself to get stronger and faster. Each day on the trail is another opportunity to get stronger. It’s almost like an endurance athlete’s dream vacation.","Newport Tennessee

There’s not much to do in Newport but the hotel rates are reasonable. I’m staying at the Quality Inn and I recommend it.
Today I’m going to share my thoughts on shelters. 
I hate staying in shelters. Sure it’s nice to have benches to sit on and a nice privy to poop in but those are the only advantages I can see for myself. 
In the Smokies you are required to stay in shelters. When the bears come out to play they have to put electric fences around the shelters to protect the bears from the hikers. Luckily In the Smokies, I only had to stay in 3 shelters. I was lucky enough to have Double Springs Shelter all to myself and only had  3 other people in Pecks Corner Shelter which can accommodate 12 hikers. Yuck imagine the stink from all those smelly shoes if the shelter was full.
I only stayed in 2 shelters outside the Smokies. I’ve camped near shelters and people are usually crammed into the shelters like sardines. Like airplanes and malls I see them as an easy way to catch some disease. 
Many hikers get into their sleeping bags before it’s even dark. This would drive me crazy. 
It’s not that I’m antisocial, I enjoy talking with other hikers and learning about their adventures and lives. I also enjoy the freedom and privacy of a tent. 
The main reason I don’t like shelters is that I don’t want to disturb everyone. The problem is that I’m very disorganized and I am constantly fiddling with my gear or looking for something like my headlamp or gloves that I just saw minutes earlier. 
So imagine trying to get yourself situated in a dark shelter without disturbing your shelter mates. I have a Black Diamond Revolt which is a nice rechargeable headlamp but its red light is so dim they shouldn’t have bothered adding that function. This weak red light compounds my problems and makes everything even slower. I have stuff “organized” in ziplock bags which are louder than an inflatable mattress. I warn people that I’m a fiddler (no I don’t play violin) and just like some snorers do, I apologize in advance for my annoying behavior. In addition I usually have to go pee twice at night. This is also a noisy process with air mattress crinkling, sleeping bag rustling, and the thud of my head hitting the ceiling beam. When I get back from my pee I have to realign my sleeping bag liner and scoot back down into my sleeping which wakes up anyone that got back to sleep while I was outside tripping over roots and slipping on the mud because I can’t see due to my red light. 
I don’t have to worry about disturbing people in my tent unless someone sets up their tent too close to mine.  
I had to sew up a rip in my Dirty Girl gaiters today. It took me at least 30 minutes and 3 YouTube videos just to get the needle threaded. I would have just thrown it away but I paid money to get my gaiters treated with permethrin by InsectSheild. They are a first line of defense against ticks. 
I go back to the trail tomorrow. I asked the hotel manager if he knew of anybody that wanted to make 20 bucks to give me a ride to the trailhead. He gave me a business card for the only local driver. I called the driver and left a message around 1 o’clock. I also went through 2 hours of irrational anxiety waiting for the driver to call me back. I was freaking out because I didn’t want to get stuck here. Finally after my 3rd attempt I got ahold of the driver. He’s supposed to pick me up at 8 o’clock in the morning. I won’t relax until I get into his car tomorrow morning.","Newport Tennessee

Silver Streak ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607743,"AT day 18. 15.5 miles to Roaring Fork Shelter
I left Newport at 8 am via a Lyft and got dropped off at Green Corner Road, AT mile 241.5. The same place I left the AT on Sunday to walk up to Standing Bear Hostel. 
It was a beautiful sunny day. The temperatures today (as measured by my watch that I had hanging off my pack) ranged from a low of 19 to a high of 32 in the sun. 
The trail starts off with a 5 mile climbs from the trailhead at 1836 feet to Snowbird Peak at 4200 feet. It’s not a very hard climb. As I was ascending I started to notice small patches of snow. Then as I got higher there were entire hillsides covered with snow. I stopped to take some pictures in case the snow went away. Well it didn’t. I had the pleasure of walking through beautiful snow covered forests most of the day. The snow was no more than a half an inch deep and it was perfect for walking on. 
The high winds of the past two days were gone so it was not too cold. How lucky am I!
Snowbird Peak had nice views but the peak itself had an ugly building on top of it. I tried to send some videos to family but I didn’t have a good T-Mobile cell signal. 
It seemed to take forever to hike the 9 miles to Max Patch from Snowbird Peak. A lot of ups and downs. Every climb seemed like it should be the one that leads your to the summit of Max Patch, but they didn’t. There is a sign letting you know when you’re half a mile away. There is a parking area nearby and I started seeing day hikers coming down from the summit. The trail is a total mucky slippery shoe sucking mess going up to the summit and also going down the other side. 
The trail north of Max Patch had slightly deeper snow and it got colder. I came to a wide rounded snow covered area with no trail markers and no obvious trail because the snow was deep enough to cover it up. I saw some footprints leading to the left that looked like they may be heading to a trail but something didn’t look right. So I got out my Guthooks app and luckily the GPS was working. I was slightly off trail and had to backtrack following the arrow on the GPS. There still wasn’t a discernible trail for about 200 yards. Eventually a defined trail appeared along with a white blaze. 
As I hiked the remaining miles to the Roaring Fork Shelter I kept hoping that it would be on one of the sunny snowless hillsides I could see to the east. No such luck. The area was covered with deeper snow than I’d been hiking in
The shelter area is very nice and is supposed to have some nice ten pads.  I decided it would probably be warmer in my tent so I found a nice tent site tucked in with some Rhododendrons. I had to clear away the snow before I pitched my tent so the snow won’t melt from my body heat and make a big puddle under the tent 
I took my food up to the shelter so I could cook on a table and socialize with 2 other hikers. When I finish eating I swirl water around in my pot and drink the liquid. Nancy calls me a garbage disposal but I don’t want anything going to waste and it’s a good way to clean up. Well that technique didn’t work tonight because the food had frozen to the pot. POST HIKE NOTE: One of the hikers staying in the shelter was Stronghold aka Ronald Sanchez.  He was a combat veteran dealing with many physical injuries and PTSD.  His stories of trying to overcome his disabilities to inspire other disabled veterans was inspiring.  He was a strong hiker despite all of his physical injuries, he was basically a bionic man. He was the hiker that made the off trail tracks that I followed coming down from Max Patch.  Apparently he hiked off the trail to dig a cat hole.  It was several months later when I found out that he was the hiker murdered on the Appalachian Trail.  Apparently he had gotten off the trail for several weeks and that is why he was so far behind me.  Ironically one reason why I didn't want to stay in the shelter that night  was because of an oddball young hiker who told some really bizarre stories.
It’s 8:50 now and it’s 25 degrees in my tent. My fingers are too cold to tap the phone keyboard. I have to place my water filter and electronics in my sleeping bag to protect them from the cold. 
Time to pee and cozy up in my sleeping bag. 
I put on all my clothes and jackets to sleep in. I should have been toasty warm but I had a bad nights sleep because I kept waking up feeling cold. I thought that maybe taking off my rain pants would allow more heat to escape into the sleeping bag to keep it warmer. This seemed to help. I also tried sleeping on my back to spread my body heat evenly. I think I got cold because I was camping on frozen ground and my inflatable pad (Thermarest xTherm) wasn’t up to the task. It has one of the highest R-values of any lightweight pad. 
I had to get up to pee several times. The first time I tried to pee in a designated pee bladder using a collapsible funnel to direct the flow. I  was worried that I was going to spill during the process so I won’t use that method again. The other 3 times I had to suck it up and go outside in the snow. 
I woke up for the last time at 4:45. I decided to stay up and try to thaw out my frozen socks, shoes, breakfast and water bottle by placing them in a plastic bag and putting them in my sleeping bag. It’s now 5:22 and I can hear the people in the shelter talking. The forecasted temperature low for this morning was 18 degrees. 
I’m going to start packing up soon so I can leave at first light. I need to hike 18 miles to Hot Springs today.

To mile 274.9 total 17.9
I don’t know why the total mileage is off. To date it should read 274.9 per Guthook. I found one entry that posted twice so that maybe the problem. 
This will be a quick post. I’m in Hot Springs at the Sunnybank Inn. It’s a beautiful 1840’s house you have to see to believe. Check it out on any of the AT guides or Guthook. 
The trail did not disappoint today. You most definitely could have built a snowman today. Most of the day was spent hiking in the snow. It finally warmed up when the sun started shining. 
The uphills were pretty tough today. They were long and steep. The downhills were also long and steep. The snow was perfect for hiking in. It wasn’t slushy or slippery. The dirt was frozen but not slick. For the most part the stream crossings were the only places you had to worry about ice. There was one spot on the trail away from streams that must have been a small spring that had frozen over and turned into a stealth ice patch. I stepped on it and went down. 
I made it the 17.9 miles to Hot Springs by 3 o’clock. I stopped off at the Laughing Heart Hostel to pick up some repair parts for my backpack. I told the owner that I really want stay at the Sunnybank Inn and she said I’ll drive you there. She didn’t even charge me for holding my package. 
On the way to dinner I had to walk about 0.3 miles south on the AT where I had branched off to go to the hostel so I can keep continuous footsteps. I then turned around and hiked back north. 
It’s getting late and I have to pack up for the next leg of my trip to Erin Tennessee.

Hi Scarlet, Urgent Cat Hole mentioned that a member of your hiking club asked if he had run into me  
I left Hot Springs around 9am. The AT runs right down their Main Street. The sidewalks have these cool looking AT signs embedded in their sidewalks. It’s right on a large river and it has several river related businesses.
The climb out of any town is going to be steep for a while. Hot Springs had one of the steepest so far. In fact the entire hike had many steep climbs. 
It started raining around 10:00 am. It was a cold hard rain. Luckily it warned me with sprinkles so I could stop and put on my rain gear. My umbrella is attached to my shoulder strap so I can use it hands free. Today my umbrella was driving me crazy. The straps holding it seemed to be plotting against me and the umbrella wouldn’t sit right. It would flop to one side. Even when it’s adjusted correctly the umbrella blocks your eyesight when hiking uphill and I have to occasionally push it up on the front to get a good view of what’s coming up. 
My backpack was causing me problems again. The top horizontal bar came out and it threw my packs balance off causing the pack to keep sliding towards the right. It was very annoying to hike almost 20 miles having to constantly move my right shoulder strap back where it belonged. I wish I had bought an Osprey Exos/Lumina.
Luckily I had a great morale boost when Urgent Cat Hole showed up. I haven’t seen him since before the Smokies. He is a very fast hiker and likes to do big miles. He is also a genuine nice guy. His wife and 3 year old son came out to visit him for several days. That’s how I got to see him again today.  
Later in the day I hiked through some light snow and then sleet. It didn’t last long. But at 3:30 with another 1.5 hours of hiking to go it started pouring. I rigged up my umbrella and it worked great this time. It’s very helpful in keeping the cold rain off of your rain gear. 
I got to Little Laurel Shelter around 5:30. Urgent Cat Hole was already there eating. I don’t like shelters but it was late and raining and only Urgent Cat Hole was here so I decided to hang out in the shelter. Later on a somewhat annoying AT hiker showed up and spread his wet gear all over. 
Tomorrow the plan is to hike 23.8 miles to Hogback Ridge Shelter. Then I’ll have one more day and a wake up to get to Uncle Johnny's Hostel near Erin Tennessee. 
It’s currently 9:25 pm and two of four hikers are snoring. I’m next to a wall and it’s echoing off the wall. It sounds like there’s a creature in the corner. I wish it would stop raining hard so I can go outside and pee.

I’m posting this 9 March journal entry on 11 March at Uncle Johnny's Hostel so I had no idea about the great news I was going to get from Zpacks about my pack.  Zpacks is sending me a new pack!  How’s that for customer service. I thought I should include this good ZPacks news now because I’ve been complaining about my pack for so long. 
Today I would get the pleasure of hiking up Firescald Knob this morning. It has raw natural beauty in its rugged granite construction and the 360 degree views it provides for those hikers that are strong and brave enough to navigate the convoluted path.
I left camp around 7 this morning feeling very tired from having my sleep disturbed by a section  hiker that is very accomplished at snoring. He warned us that he snores and apologized in advance but that didn’t help me sleep any better. In fact nothing could wake that man up. The rest of the hikers were making noises packing up before he got up and he still slept. 
The mornings hike didn’t feel so good. I was tired from lack of sleep and my pack was still giving me troubles. The first mile of the trail wasn’t too bad. The kind of trail that you can just walk and not worry about tripping or slipping. I found a nice large knife on the trail. It was even engraved. It was too big for me to carry and it didn’t have a sheath so I stuck it in a tree stump in the hopes that the owner might come back after it. Maybe it belonged to one of the volunteers that have been out recently doing trail maintenance. 
Soon after that, the trail started to be  covered with slushy snow. It was pretty but you had to watch out for ice patches. Then the boulders and granite slabs started.  They marked the approach to Firescald Knob. There’s a blue blazed bypass trail for inclement weather or the faint of heart. 
The granite path was snow covered with some small icy sections These boulders and slabs gradually started stacking on top of each other to make up some steep precarious climbs and descents.  The boulders weren’t arranged in an orderly fashion, no they were all jumbled up as if a giant helicopter flew over and dropped its load. Hiking on this mess was very tiring because it was steep and I had to concentrate on each step so I wouldn’t fall and crack your head open. This rough trail led  up to several cold and windy ridges that provided great views and were definitely worth the effort. The best views were on Big Firescald Knob. Urgent Cat Hole and I paused briefly to take each others pictures but the cold wind was howling so we couldn’t linger too for too long. Post Trail Note: This section was nothing compared to the roughsections of  trail that lay ahead.  I definitely am spoiled by the relatively easy trails I've hiked in the Sierra and Foothills Trail (SC). 
It took a while to get out of this 1.4 miles of boulders and snow. Then the roots and slippery mud took over to slow me down. 
Then I got hours of perfectly graded trail with gradual ups and downs. Hiking on this trail reminded me of a long bike training ride where I could just effortlessly pound out a steady rhythm on my pedals. Somewhere in this area I passed the 300 mile mark.
Of course all good things come to an end. At the very end of the day when I was exhausted and dreaming about food, there was a 6 mile climb up Hogback Mountain that included many super steep climbs. My pack started bothering me again The left shoulder strap kept sliding off my shoulder and I would have to keep pulling it back up. Not what you want to be doing at the end of the day. 
Eventually I reached some ridge lines that were shrouded in thick  clouds. I was lucky that it hadn’t rained all day because the forecast called for gusty winds and 100% chance of rain. Up on the ridges the winds were extremely gusty and cold. A few large raindrops kept falling down. I figured it was just moisture collecting on the trees and then getting blown off. I really didn’t want to stop and put on my rain gear. 
Well I made it to the shelter before the rain started. Urgent Cat Hole was already there eating dinner  I left all of my gear in the shelter and walked around 0.3 miles downhill to get water from a beautiful little stream. 
The forecast for this evening was for extremely high winds and rain  The fog got so dense that I had trouble finding the food hanging cables. We put a tarp across the shelter’s opening to keep the howling wind from blowing cold rain into the shelter. In the middle of the night a large tree limbs hit the roof.  
Neither one of us snores so we woke up feeling great. 
I’m finishing this entry on Sunday night. I’m at a shelter that might be haunted and I’m all by myself, except for the creatures running across the roof and scurrying around. I have to leave all of my pack’s pockets open so mice won’t chew a hole in it to get any  crumbs.

This morning I felt like I was in a Nature Valley Granola Bar commercial. The one where young, fit and I’m sure good smelling hikers effortlessly hike up to a beautiful spot, sit down and enjoy a Nature Valley bar while soaking in the view. I had a Nature Valley moment this morning on top of an unnamed Bald that had sweeping views, a light fresh breeze blowing and a perfect log to sit on. I would have ruined the commercial because I’m old and I can smell the stink from my shoes as I hike. 
Sam’s Gap (3700 ft) to Big Bald (5500 ft) 7 mile climb. In my opinion it was the hardest climb to date. It was steep and took forever. I kept saying to myself that “this to will pass” and “every step is one step closer to the mountain that matters”. Eventually the torture did end and I reached the summit of Big Bald. A young local guy brought soft drinks and snacks for AT hikers. I gladly sat down and enjoyed a Cheerwine soda and some peanut crackers. After a short chat I took off quickly energized by the sugar flooding my system. 
I met a couple that were AT Glampers. They had an RV and a car. They would park one at their endpoint and then drive back to the starting trailhead with the other. Hike with lightweight packs to the end and then drive back to pick up the other vehicle. As they say HYOH or hike your own hike. As long as they have continuous footsteps on the AT they’re thru hikers. 
I reached No Business Shelter with plenty of sunlight left to get my chores done. I was the only one there so I slept in the shelter. Someone started a rumor that it’s haunted but the only weird noises I heard was from night creatures scurrying around looking for scraps. 
Some people may be wondering why I hike 20 plus miles. It has to do with the spacing of shelters. Today I had a choice between 13 miles or 21.5 miles. I would have been done at 1 o’clock if I stopped at the first one and then I’d be bored. 
The topography of these mountains also makes it hard to find a flat spot to pitch a tent . The areas next to the trail are steep and covered with trees and bushes. Even if you found a spot up on a ridge there probably would not be any water nearby. Leave No Trace principles means that you should leave the land like you found it.","Hogback Ridge Shelter

The staff goes out of their way to make you feel comfortable. They have a very good selection of backpacking supplies. 
Tomorrow I head out for a 6 day hike to Damascus. It’s only 127 from here. I can’t believe that I’m almost there. I will be passing the 400 mile mark and hopefully I’ll leave Tennessee and North Carolina behind. I’m looking forward to the Roan Highlands, they are supposed to be spectacular. I hope that spring will finally come with wildflowers decorating the forests and hills. 
 I will stop at Boots Off Hostel to pick up the replacement pack that ZPacks is sending me. I was so happy they would replace my pack. I hated it. I’m sure it must have been a lemon because everyone else that I’ve met on the AT with the Arc Haul love it.

Today was a perfect day. The type of day that thru hikers dream about.
I left Uncle Johnny's around 9 am. The hike to Beauty Spot is 11.6 miles. I looked at the elevation profile and thought that I was in for another day of steep climbing. The trail surprised me. 
The sun is out for a change and you can smell the cool mountain air. The day started with a gradual climb up and away from Erwin. Along the way I was treated to views of the river and trains crossing over the river on a bridge. Finally I crossed  over the mountain and headed into a rhododendron forest. Then I started a gradual climb along a beautiful and peaceful section.  The trail passes by many mountain streams rushing down. The sounds and smells are amazing.   I just keep hiking in this type of habitat until I reached the summit called Beauty Spot. 
 I saw the glampers hiking down while I hiked up. They told me that trail magic was coming up.  Brother Tom and his old boxier Moses were setup in the parking area where the trail crosses the road. 
I reached the Cherry Gap Shelter at mile 361.5 by 5:30. It seemed too early to stop hiking and it didn’t look like any good tent sites were near  the shelter, so I checked AWOL and Guthook for tent options. AWOL showed a tent site 4.1 miles ahead. Guthook had it listed as a piped spring. 
I got to the piped spring around 7:00. I filtered water and then found a stealth tent site up the hill on an old road bed. 
I almost lost my spoon again. I cooked dinner away from my tent. It was getting dark so I moved everything I had for cooking back down closer to the tent. When it came time for eat I couldn’t find my spoon. I panicked, how could I eat the next 6 days without a spoon? I grabbed my headlamp and searched the path I’d taken up to the log I’d sat on to cook. Nothing, even at the cook site. I started kicking around leaves and just as I was about to give up I saw a shiny object which was my spoon.

AT day 25
The day started off great. The sun was shining and the hiking was easy. I was flying up and down all of the hills. After about 3 hours I came to an overlook. I took a video at 10:45 for the family of the pretty view of Roan Mountain. Then I took off hiking again thoroughly enjoying myself. After around a hour I saw a hiker coming down the hill. I asked him if he was going south, he said no I’m going north. I told him that he was going the wrong way. He said no you’re going the wrong way. We checked our GPS map and sure enough I was going south. Oh expletive expletive expletive. I wasn’t thinking straight and thought that maybe I was hiking all day the wrong way. 3 hours of wrong way on easy terrain would have been about 9 miles that I’d have to hike back just to get where I started. The other hiker was a young German and I asked him if he was a fast hiker. He said he was so I was going to let him go first  After 4 steps I knew he wasn’t Silver Streak fast so I passed him and took off like a crazy man driven by anger at my stupid mistake. Eventually my brain became rational and I realized where I made my mistake.
Post trail note: The young German hiker was actually French Canadian and is known by the trail name T-Rex. I met up with him and his hiking partner Hawk in Damascus.  I hiked with him for a while just past the Graysen Highlands and found out that he is a very fast hiker.
I got back to the overlook at 1:10. I checked my GPS app and calculated that I’d walked 3.4 miles south which meant a 6.8 mile round trip that don’t count as AT miles. I was still pissed off at myself. If you think that was dumb, well I left the overlook and saw 2 trails and only one had a white blaze  So I took that one. After about 2 minutes I realized I had made the same mistake. 
Angry and now paranoid about getting lost I took off for Roan Mountain. Roan Mountain’s elevation is 6500 feet. It’s a long climb to the top but it’s well graded with switchbacks to make it easier. As I approached the summit a cold wind started blowing. Many sections of the trail were covered with thick sheets of ice. Luckily there were ways around it. I had just sent my ice spikes home. I wanted to camp as low in elevation as possible. The Stan Murray Shelter is 5043 feet. It was 7 o’clock when I got there and I was happy that no one else was there. The wind was howling at least 20 mph with higher gusts. There was a tarp in the shelter that I rigged up but it only covered ¾ ths of the opening. I had to weigh the bottom of the tarp with rocks. I found 2 old abandoned nonfunctional fire pits and used those rocks. It’s now dark and no one else was coming so I set up my freestanding Duplex tent inside the shelter behind the tarp.  This is frowned upon but I saw it as the only way of staying somewhat warm. 
All night long I’d be woken up by wind gusts rattling the tarp. I was concerned that the tarp would fail and then my tent would fall over. 
I’m still alive so I survived the night. 
I actually hiked 25.3 miles today.

The day started off windy with clear skies. Coming attractions included Little Hump and Hump mountains. They are balds and are supposed to have great views. Unfortunately just as I was getting to Little Hump the wind picked up and a cold fog rolled in to block my views. The wind was so strong that it kept blowing me off the trail.  Balds are grassy areas that are very muddy and slippery after a rain. I endured about 4 miles of this nasty weather and slippery trail. I actually tried running to get off the mountains faster.
Eventually I made it down to Dolly Flats which was much warmer and protected from the wind. My feet were bothering me because of all the mud that filled up my shoes. I took a break by a spring that has a PVC pipe in it to funnel water and make it easier for hikers to collect. I sat on a wet log, took out my nail brush and cleaned my feet, shoes and socks. I’m so glad I took the time because my feet felt so much better. 
My shoes have several holes in the sides. I might have to duct tape the sole on because it’s feeling a little flappy. I’m getting new shoes in Damascus on Sunday. 
The rest of the day flew by. The trail was nicely graded and maintained which made for fast hiking. I left North Carolina for good and then passed the 400 mile mark. 
My destination was Scotty’s Budget Solar Hostel. The shelters were either not far enough or too far. The hostel would give me a nice 23 miles and a comfortable nights sleep. The directions for getting there weren’t very good. Basically at a certain mile mark, near a bench you were supposed to hike ¼ mile west through the woods. There weren’t any side trails at the mile marker or the bench. I was tired, hungry and it was getting late. The next campsite was another 6 miles away. I felt like yelling out to see if anyone could hear me. I backtracked to the bench, still nothing. So I went back north and finally saw a faint trail leading into the woods. I followed the trail hoping that it was the right one. I hiked a lot more than ¼ mile and then found some buildings. I walked up on the porch and yelled out and thankfully Scotty answered. He was a very nice guy and he hiked the PCT in the 90s. I had the hostel all to myself. 
After yesterday's 6.5 mile round trip wrong way disaster, I have been paranoid about going the wrong way. I frequently get this uneasy feeling and check my GPS app. I guess I’ll never do the CDT, it has grizzlies to eat lost hikers.

Today was the last day I’d have to use my damaged pack. I’ve been counting down the days since I found out that I was getting a replacement. Today I was counting down the hours and I couldn’t hike fast enough to get me to the hostel where my new pack was waiting. 
After an hour of morning rain the skies started to clear and the sun came out. There is something special about sunshine that lifts the spirits. You couldn’t have asked for a nicer day. The trail was easy to hike and the sites were varied and beautiful. 
The final finale for the day was a hike down into Laurel Fork Gorge. The climb down was slow due to the big stones and boulders dotting the trail. One trip or slip could result in a bad injury. It was a gorgeous place with a big waterfall and stunning rock formations. 
One thing is true about hiking the AT, rivers and roads are usually at a lower elevation than the mountain you have to climb. The climb up out of the gorge was steeper, hotter, and longer than any climbs I’ve had since leaving Erwin. 
I hated this climb because it was slowing me down and my pack was making my left shoulder hurt. The path was narrow in places with loose rocks. I slipped once and was close to sliding down the hill. 
After at least 2 hours I made it over the top and then started to descend like a maniac. I wanted to get to the hostel before the camp store closed so I could get ice cream. Well I got there and found out that the hostel guy (Trail name Grumpy) runs the store and they were out of ice cream. But my new pack was there.

What a difference my new ZPacks Arc Haul made. My old pack must have been a lemon because my new pack carries like a dream. Now I can barely tell that I have a pack on.
Today was another perfect AT hiking day. You start with a hike around the Watauga Lake shoreline. I saw my first wildflowers along lower elevations. Eventually you have to climb uphill and away from the shore. The climb was on a well maintained trail with enough switchbacks to keep the grade gradual. Once you gained a certain elevation you basically walked on a ridge above the lake with many views of the lake surrounding communities and farms. After a while you would have to climb another short hill and repeat the pattern of uphill, ridge, uphill. 
My goal was to make it to the Rabbit Hole Hostel. They pick you up at the trailhead and offer $3.00 milkshakes. The campsites before the hostel weren’t far enough and shelter past it was too far. 
The closer I got the more I wanted a milkshake. I really picked up my pace as the trail started to descend to the trailhead. 
I needed to call the Rabbit Hole once I got to the trailhead. I didn’t have T-Mobile service so I was going to have to send them an Inreach message. But in keeping with a perfect day several carloads of spring break hikers showed up and one of them had cell service. 
I called the hostel and Kat showed up a few minutes later. My first order of business was to order a milkshake. It was worth it.

Today was my 4 week anniversary for hiking the AT. For at least a week I made it a goal to get to Damascus on this day. Rabbit dropped me off at the same trailhead they picked me up at. 
I walked across the street and opened a gate to follow the AT through a farmer’s field. It was a wonderful hike through the field. The birds were singing and the smells of the grass complimented the cold 27 degree air. 
I couldn’t have planned a better hiking day. The sun was shining, the winds were just strong enough to cool you off and the trail was smooth. 
I hiked the 21.7 miles to Damascus in 7 hours. Not too shabby for an old fart  I felt like a real BadAss and almost wore my badass headband into town. 
I kept thinking about where I should spend the night. I was torn between Woodchuck Hostel and Crazy Larry’s. They both have their merits but Crazy Larry seemed like an interesting charter 
Crazy Larry’s was a one of a kind place. My room was very clean and had a comfortable bed. Larry is crazy He is always yammering on about something that I either didn’t understand or didn't care about.  I have many tales to tell about my stay there but I don’t want to share them in public. I’m glad I stayed there and got a chance to meet someone I never would’ve dreamed that I’d encounter in my life. 
I’m having trouble with town food. My body is screaming for calories and I oblige with food that I’d never eat at home. I stuff my face with junk food and greasy cheeseburgers. I pay for this diet late at night. Tonight I woke up gagging back vomit. In Erwin I over ate at a Mexican restaurant and woke up feeling like I had the norovirus. 
As I write this I’m in Rural Retreat near Atkins Virginia. I tried to control myself at the local gas station minimarts but still bought too much junk. I went to a Mexican restaurant and ordered a normal sized meal but I couldn’t finish it and left stuffed. Hopefully I don’t wake up sick. The best I’ve felt leaving a town was at the Boots Off Hostel. They took us to McDonalds for dinner and I had 4 doughnuts for breakfast. I’ve also craved Mt Dew/Mellow Yellow.

I knew that I only had 15 miles to make it to Lost Mountain Shelter so I slept in until 6:30.  Crazy Larry served great pancakes and eggs. He was a little peeved that I didn’t want any meat for breakfast.
I stopped at an outfitter to get a spare fuel canister and headed out of town around 10:00. It was another glorious AT day and the trail passed through some amazing habitats. 
I took a wrong turn again and hiked an extra 2 bonus miles. I didn’t want to get my new shoes wet or muddy. I came to a stream and concentrated on the rock hops. I continued on the trail to the left and started a steep climb. During steep climbs I try to concentrate on form and tempo so I don’t look up for the white blazes. Once the trail leveled out I started to look for blazes. I decided that if I didn’t see any blazes by the next switchback then I would check my Guthook GPS app  Sure enough I was on the Virginia Creeper trail. A couple of locals happened by and confirmed that I wasn’t on the AT. They tried to make me feel better by saying that where I made my mistake was a confusing intersection. I was mad at myself and ran most of the way back. I found the intersection and found the white blaze. I learned to be aware at all intersections and check Guthooks if I feel uneasy or don’t see a white blaze after a few minutes. 
It was cold and windy on top of the ridges so I was hoping that the shelter would be tucked into some trees for a change. Thankfully it was because the lows were supposed to be in the upper 20s tonight. 
Just John was already setup in the shelter. He was doing work for stay at Crazy Larry’s. He was pretty quiet at Crazy Larrys but I got him to open up and talk at the shelter. Last year he made it all the way to Maine and for some reason he had to quit.  So he was back to finish his lifelong dream of hiking this trail. I didn’t ask why he had to quit and he didn’t say. 
I always feel guilty when people tell me that they are fulfilling a dream by hiking the AT because I never really wanted to. I am falling in love with the trail and consider it a privilege to be able hike in such a wonderful wilderness.

I left the Lost Mountain Shelter just after sunup   I was full of anticipation. The Grayson Highlands State Park with their herds of wild ponies was coming up along with Mt Rodgers, the highest peak in Virginia. My goal was to camp at the Old Orchid Shelter 23.5 miles away. 
I’ve gotten spoiled with the easy terrain ever since I left Erwin.  Today the trail had a big surprise for me, as if saying, “This is the AT and the only easy day was yesterday”. 
Today I hiked through some of the most spectacular scenery I’ve had the pleasure to walk through. From dark forests with huge trees to grassy balds and the unique Grayson Highlands   But all this beautiful diversity didn’t come easy. 
I’m not complaining, I’m just going to describe the difficulties I faced on the trail today. I had all sorts of obstacles thrown down on the footpath, all of them designed to slow you down and hurt you if you didn’t tread cautiously. There were miles of large boulders to navigate going uphill and down.  The worst ones were going down where your momentum from each step down could throw you off balance. Add in ice patches from frozen streams, irregular shaped cobble size rocks that are just waiting to twist your ankles and more than normal roots and sticks. 
To keep a positive spin on today I would use some phrases that I made up for the AT. This to shall pass and will soon be a fond memory. This is just another step forward to Katahdin. 
Mt Rogers wasn’t particularly impressive. I stopped at the Thomas Knob Shelter expecting to see wild ponies everywhere but I only got to filter water. I reached the 500 AT mile point in a nondescript section of trail.  I expected at least a signpost but apparently the AT frequently adjusts the trail to account for overly impacted sections so the 500 mile point could also change. I took a video of myself trying to sing the “I have walked 500 miles and I can walk 500 more” song. I’m not sure that those are the correct words but they worked for me.
All through the Grayson Highlands day hikers would tell me that I was going to see many ponies. The trail through the highlands is difficult with a backpack. The grassy hills areas with their muddy trails are broken up by climbs up rocky knolls consisting of huge boulders and granite slabs that demanded my upmost attention to keep my old body upright and intact. I hiked in this labyrinth for what seemed like hours without seeing one d--- pony. 
The AT veers left and another trail heads down to the parking lot. I decided that the day hikers weren’t lying but they must have seen the ponies down the other trail. 
Disappointed I hiked out of the park toward the Old Orchard Shelter. I was very disappointed and felt cheated. 
I was hiking on an old forest road following the white blazes. Up ahead was a downed tree blocking the road. I was analyzing the situation to figure out the best way around the tree when I passed a trail junction that wasn’t marked with double blazes. I went around the tree and hiked uphill a few minutes before that now familiar feeling of your on the wrong trail came back. I stopped and checked Guthook, sure enough I missed a turn. At least I only hiked several minutes the wrong way. 
Later I encountered some more day hikers. I complained about not seeing ponies and they assured me I’d see some in a few miles. I’ve heard that before I told them. They were fellow senior citizens so I believed them and got my hopes up. About an hour later I saw 5 ponies exactly where they said they’d be. 
I had the Old Orchard Shelter all to myself. It’s a small shelter but there is a large tent area and bear boxes to lock up your food. 
Tomorrow I head to the Partnership Shelter and hopefully pizza.

I woke up to sub freezing temperatures probably in the upper 20s. My water bottles were slushy but not completely frozen. This is the best type of water to mix a coffee and hot cocoa powder. It tastes like a milkshake but the bottle and the air are freezing so you need to wear gloves to handle the bottle.
I left camp about 7:40. It was light enough to hike about out at 7:20. The sun was shining and the cold air felt great to hike in 
I expected easier terrain than I had yesterday and had to hike around 24 miles to get to the Partnership Shelter. This is a very nice 2 story shelter located very close to the Mt Rodgers Visitor Center.  It’s iconic because you can call from a phone outside the visitor center and order pizza delivery. There is a $30.00 minimum so luckily the 2 other hikers I was hiking with also wanted pizza. I had a barbecue chicken pizza and a large salad. 
The other 2 hikers are T-Rex and Hawk. I met them in Damascus. TRex was the guy that told me that I was hiking South last week. He’s French Canadian and is a very fast hiker. Hawk has already done the AT several times and is planning a Yo Yo hike which means once he summits Katahdin he will hike back to Georgia. 
They both get up early and start hiking in the dark. Today they hiked 30 miles. 
This morning when I started hiking, despite wearing gloves, my entire fingers were frozen.  Trekking poles make it even colder. I had to put my trekking poles away and hike with my hands in my front pant pockets to warm them up.  
Thankfully the trail wasn’t full of obstacles like yesterday so I could make good time. I did get tripped by one of the many demonic loose sticks that line the AT. They usually jump up and stab you in your calf or shoes. Some of them jump up between your legs and trip you. Today I was trying to call Nancy (wife) and was watching my phone while walking. To teach me a lesson a stick tripped me and I fell down. 
I finally made it the entire way without taking a wrong turn. 
Tomorrow I hike about 11 miles to pickup a resupply box and take a Nero in Rural Retreat.

I have enough trouble avoiding trip hazards during the day there is no way my old eyes could make out enough details to keep from tripping in the dark. 
I left at first light and hiked with visions of town food and a warm bed filling my head. I got to Rural Retreat around 11:30 and checked into the Relax Inn where my resupply box was waiting. The motel is old but my room was clean and comfortable. 
I tried not to overeat but I didn’t succeed. At least I stayed away from the beer and chips. 
My Therm-a-Rest  Xtherm has been losing air. It gets soft at least 3 times a night. I checked it for pinholes in the bathtub. No leaks so it must be the valve. I called customer service and their policy isn’t very thru hiker friendly. So I ordered a ZLite Zero from Amazon and will have it sent to Woods Hole Hostel. This way I’ll have some padding under my soft Xtherm. 
I’m heading to Chestnut Knob Shelter tomorrow. It’s going to be a cold and windy day.

miles to Chestnut Knob Shelter 
I was looking at my shadow as I was hiking the last 1.5 miles up to Chestnut Shelter.  The wind was howling and light snow was coming down. I couldn’t believe that it was my shadow moving  forward towards the safety of an enclosed shelter on the top of a mountain.
The day started off with high wind advisories for the next 24 hours. I put on my rain jacket to block the wind and stepped outside my motel room to continue my AT hike. 
Today I traveled across terrain that included rolling farmland, rhododendron thickets, and hills still brown from the fallen leaves. I always feel grateful that farmers allow us to hike across their land. 
I discovered the power of chocolate glazed donuts. One doughnut gave me longer lasting energy than 2 Cliff bars. I packed out 3 doughnuts for the day. 
It turned out to be a beautiful AT hiking day.  I passed a sign that marked the ¼ way point. 
Once I got into the woods the trees helped block the wind. The only part of the trail I didn’t care for was the rock strewn ridges at the beginning of the hike. These rocks and slabs are very dangerous and require concentration and agility to avoid a twisted ankle or wrenched knee  
As I climbed higher on the long steep trail that leads up to the shelter, I noticed snow starting to fall. How can this be?  It’s sunny all around the mountain but the only place it’s snowing is where I’m heading. At least it was still warm and not very windy.  The only reliable water source is a piped spring emptying into a pond that is 1.8 miles from the summit and the shelter. It was still snowing when I stopped for water but it wasn’t very cold yet. I didn’t even have my wind jacket on. I took a video at the spring and mentioned how it was snowing but it wasn’t very cold. Well for some reason I decided to put on my rain jacket and warm gloves. I was glad I did because not too long after I left the spring I got to an exposed spot and into the howling cold wind.  Even though I was hiking uphill I started getting cold. At least it was blowing me up the hill. 
The 1.8 miles to the shelter seemed to last forever.  This is where I noticed my shadow and reflected on how out of place I was. I am a beach person not some mountain explorer. At the same time I felt like a real badass thru hiker walking north despite the dangerous (in my opinion) weather.  I was hoping that the shelter would be empty. I hate staying in shelters with other people. As I got closer and could see the door and I thought about what would happen if it was locked. Well it wasn’t locked but it was almost full. I got the last spot. Conditions were so bad outside that only a Mt Everest expedition type tent could stay standing and keep you warm. There was no way I could have survived in my tent and it would have been a several hour hike on an exposed rocky ridge before I could have found a campsite out of the wind. I had no choice but to stay in the shelter. 
All night long the wind gusts would shake the shelter and rattle the door. My air mattress has a slow leak, so every 3 hours it gets soft and loses its insulating properties.  So I get cold which makes me want to pee and it’s no fun in a crowded shelter having to make the noises necessary to get out of your sleeping bag and walk out into a gale to pee. 
I got up early and got the heck out of there. I wanted to put in my first marathon distance day to a campsite at a lower elevation.

Silver Streak ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608807,"AT day 35  3/2333.9 miles to Jenny Knob Shelter I had planned to hike at least a marathon (26.2 miles) today. There were at least 3 campsites that were located around this distance.
The time was 5:40 pm and I decided to check Guthook to read the description of each site so that I could pick the best one. To my surprise none of them had a water source. I was in trouble because I only had about 200 ml of Amazing Grass solution left. I checked the app for the nearest reliable water source. The closest one was at the Helvey Mills Shelter which I had passed 1.5 miles ago. The next option was the Jenny Knob Shelter which was 8.7 miles north. 
So I evaluated my options. Remember that it’s 5:40 and it will start getting dark in 2 hours. 
Option 1. Hike back to the shelter 1.5 miles south 
Option 2. Stay at a dry campsite and eat bars and peanut butter for dinner with a little bit of liquid to wash it down. 
Option 3. Hike the 8.7 miles to the next shelter north. Even if I hiked at a 3 mph pace I would have to night hike. Two problems with night hiking, I promised Nancy (wife) that I wouldn’t night hike and at almost 66 my eyes don’t work that well at night even with a headlamp. 
Option 1 was not acceptable because thru hikers hate going backwards even a yard and we detest doing bonus miles unless they lead to a wonderful view. 
Option 2 would not work because I really had my heart and stomach set on eating this huge wheel shaped artisan bread a nice young couple from Michigan gifted me and I needed water to make Miso Ramen to soak it in. 
That left me with option 3 but I only had 2 hours to go 8.7 miles. 
So what does a 65 year old endurance runner do? I made a run for it. I cinched my backpack down tight and took off. I ran the downhills, I ran the flat sections and I ran the less steep uphills. The steeper uphills slowed me down but I made the time back up on the downhills. Luckily the trail was fairly smooth and I didn’t have to slow down too many times to avoid roots and rocks. 
I got to the shelter about 15 minutes before it got dark. A wooden plaque with water written on it pointed to the left. There are normally blue blazes on trees that lead you to the water. I didn’t see any blazes but I saw several footpaths leading down slope away from the shelter. I tried multiple paths and they all dead ended in brush. It was getting dark and too hard to see so I returned to the shelter to get my headlamp. I setup my solar lantern on the picnic table to use as a beacon in case I became disoriented in my night quest for water. This time I found a few blue blazed trees but then the blazes stopped and I had to guess at the general direction to follow. I tried this several times and each time I ended up in a thicket. To get back to the shelter all I knew was that I had to climb back up hill. But it’s a big hill and it would have been easy to get disoriented and lost in the dark woods where everything looks the same. Each time I needed to go back to the shelter, my little solar light was just visible, shining like a lighthouse to bring me back safely. I finally gave up trying. This really sucked. I didn’t have water to cook with and I also was dehydrated from running. The Guthook app has a comment section which allows other hikers to post information about a place. Everyone said that there was water but no one gave tips on how to find it. After scrolling through several pages of comments one hiker said to go to the right not the left to find water. Sure enough I immediately found the blue blazed trees and a trail that lead down to a good water source. After wasting 30 minutes I finally was saved. 
I ate late but that bread Miso soup combination was amazing. 
So that’s my story of how I accidentally hiked 33.9 miles today.

I wasn’t supposed to get there Monday but because I hiked 34 miles yesterday I figured that I’d get there around 4pm. I sent a text message to Neville, the owner of the hostel to let her know about my change in plans.
For most of the day the trail followed the dismal creek drainage. This meant that it was mostly flat and easy to maintain a quick pace. The only thing that slowed me down was the occasional muddy section that I’d have to navigate around. 
The climb out of the drainage was long and steep.  It seemed like they forgot about switchbacks. After the climb came a few miles of rocks. 
You pop out of the forest and the AT crosses Sugar Run road. The Woods Hole Hostel is located about a mile down the road. 
I couldn’t believe how wonderful the place was. Neville greeted me, checked me in and made me feel at home. This was going to be the perfect place for a relaxing zero day tomorrow.

I got back on the AT around 9:30. An hour later than I planned but it didn’t really matter because I only had 20 miles to hike today. 
My goal was to hike to the campsite 1.5 miles north of the Rice Field Shelter. The weather was cold and foggy when I started. Pretty good hiking weather. 
It seemed like most of the day was spent hiking uphill.  The uphills weren’t bad because the majority weren’t too steep. 
The climb out of Bluff City along the New River took all afternoon. The climb never stopped until I got to my campsite. 
I’m trying a new nutrition plan. My old plan involved eating a nutrition bar every 2 hours. I wasn’t getting enough calories and I would always be hungry. In addition I have lost at least 12 pounds. I’m down to my Ironman racing weight and really can’t afford to lose any more weight. 
Several days ago a nice young couple from Michigan took pity on me and gifted me some trail mix and the big fancy bread that I wrote about on the day that I hiked 34 miles. Anyway, the trail mix worked like magic for my energy levels and my feeling of fullness. So during my zero day I bought a pound of Walmart trail mix. I’ve also watched enough hiking videos to know that a lot of hikers eat tortilla wraps for lunch. Some hikers put some pretty disgusting stuff on their tortillas. I bought some small tortillas to try out. I decided to put cheddar cheese and Fritos on mine.  I ate 2 for lunch and they were delicious and kept me feeling full. I also added dark chocolate M&Ms. 
I felt full all day and my energy levels were consistent. 
Tonight I’m sleeping on a foam pad instead of my air mattress. I had to send my Xtherm mattress back for repairs  I’m lying on it while I slowly type this with one finger on my iPhone 8 and it feels pretty good. After all hikers never had air mattresses in the old days. 
My plan for tomorrow is to hike to either War Spring Shelter which is 23.8 miles from here or continue on to Laurel Creek Shelter 29.7 miles away.

Today for the first time I saw butterflies, bees, squirrels and a lizard. They were out enjoying a warm spring day. Gnats and flies were out but they couldn’t stand my stench so they left me alone  
This section of Virginia features long ridge walks with amazing views of the valleys and farmlands. The landscapes are so idyllic that it makes me wish that I were a painter. 
It’s not all cruising along enjoying views on the ridges. The AT trail designers want to make sure that you don’t get bored so they throw in these rocky knob obstacles that are called ledges on Guthooks. These require the agility of a mountain goat and a long attention span which are two things that I lack. I even trip on hidden roots on flat terrain. Another feature on the ridges is a lack of water. I’m so used to cold weather hiking where can get by with two 700ml water bottles for the entire day. I’m also used to having a spring every few miles. Well that’s not happening on the ridges and I ended up slightly dehydrated which effects my agility and mood. 
Today on the ridges I was able to see the Bruisers Knob Cairns. They are stacks of big rock piles lined up along the ridge. According to Guthooks no one knows exactly how they got there but they could have been built by farmers. Those early farmers were made from sturdier stock than myself. I’m indebted to them for making my path a little smoother. I also got to see an eastern continental divide sign. The concept is kind of mind blowing, the water running down the west slope will end up in the Gulf of Mexico while the water on the east travels to the Atlantic. 
I ended up the day camping all by myself to mile 689.6.  This will set me up for a cool morning hike up to the Audie Murphy memorial in the morning. My tent site selection was a fail because with all the leaf litter I didn’t notice several thick roots and rocks. These became obvious once I lied down on my thin foam mattress. I shifted my mat around until I found a reasonable spot.

Silver Streak ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609216,"Day 41  3/2924.6 miles to Pigs Farm Campsite I came up with a new concept today. Most people associate Type 2 fun with an event that might have been terrifying while you’re doing it but memorable and fun in retrospect. Traversing steep snow fields while hiking the John Muir trail where a slip could result in an injury or death comes to mind.
What if what you did could never be considered fun but it’s something you did that pushed yourself beyond what you every thought you were capable of. This was my experience with the Dragon’s tooth section and I call it Type 2 Adventure. I hated it at the time and never will consider it fun but I will always remember it and I’m sure it will be at the top of my list of AT stories. 
I had the honor of visiting the Audie Murphy memorial this morning. It is a wonderful memorial to an American hero. When I reached the memorial I was so overcome with emotion that I had to sit down on the bench and collect myself. I am a Navy Veteran and I feel a close connection to all the service men and women who have sacrificed their lives to protect our freedom. 
After a salute to the flag and a prayer for the fallen I was off on what would ultimately be the hardest and sketchiest hike thus far. 
After some easy hiking I started the climb up a well graded trail that brings you up to a long ridgeline that will eventually lead to a side trail that takes you to the Dragon's Tooth rock formation. It was hot and the trail doesn't have a water source.  I should have refilled my one empty water bottle in the nasty looking road side stream before I started the climb, but I had a full bottle, the trail had been easy so far and I thought that there would be a better water source further up. I had no idea that I was in for a grueling long waterless stretch. My grandson would call me a Noob.
I was psyched to see this Dragon's Tooth.  I even made up a story to tell my grandkids on a video about how a dragon lost a tooth and the tooth fairy came to collect it but it was too heavy for her to carry away. She tried getting all of her fairy friends to help but they still couldn’t budge it. So she turned it to stone so that the evil witch couldn’t take it and use it’s magical powers. 
By the time I got there I was too dehydrated and tired to give a rat’s you know what about the tooth or my story. I hiked down the side trail far enough to see perhaps a dragon’s molar.  l took a picture and headed back to the AT. 
The approach to the dragon’s tooth was child’s play compared to the decent. It’s the kind of trail that would be great fun with a daypack filled with snacks and water. It was almost terrifying in spots descending with a heavy, unwieldy backpack. It had metal rungs anchored into the rock, steeply sloped ledges with footpaths no wider than a small boot, and drops that I had to scoot down on my butt. I can’t see how this section could be safe in the rain. But I haven’t heard of any injuries or fatalities here so I guess it works out. 
Even after I got past the sketchiest sections the trail kept throwing obstacles in my path. I checked Guthooks to find out how much farther I had to descend and noticed a hostel located close to where the trail comes out on the road. It was only 1pm but I was dehydrated and beaten down. I was seriously considering calling it a day 
I would call the Dragon Tooth section a Type 2 Adventure. It would have been fun if I didn’t have a backpack on and I wasn’t dehydrated. 
I had cell service when I got to the road. I refused to wimp out so I called the hostel to see if they sold drinks. The closest spring was 2 miles away.  The owner gave me 2 great bits of information: there is a mini mart ⅓ mile to my left and the hike up to McAfee Knob is a piece of cake. 
I replenished my energy with some chocolate milk ,an ice cream sandwich and my secret weapon a bag of 12 mini doughnuts. I rehydrated with and filled my bottles with Gatorade. 
Feeling like a doughnut powered superhero I continued my hike reaching McAfee Knob around 7pm and the Pig Farm campsite a little later. By the way I didn’t see any pigs or remnants of a farm.

I could see at least 10 tents down by the shelter so I stopped at the Pig Farm which is the official tenting area. There were only 2 others camped here and there is a picnic table. I got there late so I had to rush down to the water source before it got too late. I enjoyed the company of the 2 backpackers while I ate dinner in the dark.
I was packed up and ready to go before the sun came out enough to light the trail. There was a light rain falling so I rigged up my umbrella. I used my headlamp to find the shelter’s privy. As soon as it got light enough to see the birds started singing. 
I had 15.5 miles to hike to Daleville and a hotel room, shower, laundry and town food. I noticed that there was a Cracker Barrel in Daleville.  I’ve been wanting some good pancakes for weeks. All the way to Daleville I was dreaming of Cracker Barrel’s pancake breakfast. 
I usually average 2.5 miles per hour which includes periodic breaks. I calculated that it should take about 6 hours to get to Daleville. It started out as a cool morning and figured that I could make it there with 2 water bottles. I was wrong and by the time I needed water I was on the last long waterless ridge that seemed endless. 
The trail comes out right on the main highway.  There are 2 motels less than a half mile to the right. I checked into the Super 8 and asked how I could get to the Cracker Barrel. It was only 1 mile away but the roads weren’t amenable to walking. Oh well I can get pancakes another time. 
I went to the outfitter to buy a BeFree water filter and a pair of Darn Tough socks. My Sawyer Micro filter takes too long. At the end of the day I filter 2.5 liters of water for dinner and breakfast and it seems to take forever. The last thing that I want to do as it’s getting cold because the sun is going down is filter water. My socks have big holes in them. 
My experiment with trail mix and M&Ms failed. I went back to my nutrition bar routine. I did buy some Gatorade powder for the sugar and electrolytes. I also am keeping the tortillas and cheese as a supplement to my dinner.","Pigs Farm Campsite

Hiking was great today. The trail was well maintained and didn’t have any of the long boulder fields that I despise. The trail crosses the Blue Ridge Parkway many times. There were 2 places that people had left trail magic. The weather was nice and cool and the air smelled fresh. 
I chose the Jennings Creek campsite because it had a nice stream near it and it was located at the base of the next climb. I got there around 50 minutes before dark so I had time to filter water, cook dinner and setup camp. The only bad thing about the campsite was that it’s located near a parking area. I tried to setup my tent out of sight but I know that passing cars could see my light at night. I’m more concerned about crazy people visiting in the night then wild creatures.","Daleville Virginia

There was a couple already setup in the shelter. From a distance it looked like they had trail magic spread across the picnic table and I started day dreaming of burgers, chips and sodas. It ended up just being all of their stuff. It was going to be another sub-freezing night so the lady had her tent setup in the shelter. She volunteered to take it down but I told them that I was going to put up my tent on top of some nice soft leaves. I enjoyed their fire and company while I ate dinner.

Another climbing day.   The past few days I’ve noticed that the last 500 feet of elevation gain are the steepest and rockiest sections. Today was no different. The climb up to Bald Knob involved 3000 feet of elevation gain. I enjoy hiking uphill until the rocky boulders start. To top it off the Bald Knob wasn’t a Bald and was a poor excuse for a Knob.
All of my efforts were rewarded later when I got to Cole Mountain Bald which was a huge beautiful bald with fantastic views. At least two dozen college kids had hiked up from the parking area to enjoy it. 
I finally made it to the Hog Camp Gap camping area. It’s right off of the parking area. Several groups of campers were already setup. A nice couple from Nova Scotia gave me 3 bags of delicious trail mix. 
This wasn’t that bad of a campsite. The water involves a long walk down to a hidden stream. The grossest thing about the area was the place people leave a dump. Toilet paper everywhere and some people didn’t even try to bury their poop. 
The next morning I got up early and went out to dig a cat hole to poop in. When I got back to my tent a hunting type dog was there. I tried to reason with it and told it to go away but the freakin dog went into my tent and sat down. I was concerned that it would get ticks and fleas in my tent. I started yelling at it to leave. I’m sure that I woke everyone up but no one came to claim the dog. I quickly tossed everything out of my tent and took one of the trekking poles that holds up my tent to gently nudge the dog out. It finally got the message and left. 
I started up the grassy hill at first light. I was rewarded with a beautiful blood red sunrise. I stopped to take a video and guess who showed up. That dog!  I told him to go home but it followed me for at least one mile. I would stop and throw stuff towards it (being careful not to hit it) and it would turn around with its tail between its legs. Just when I thought I’d lost it I would turn around and see it following me from a safe distance. I didn’t have cell service to call the owner. Finally it took off into the woods barking. I guess the owner has a way to recall it.","Johns Hollow Shelter

Silver Streak ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609768,"AT day 47  4/428.1 miles to Maupin Shelter The day started out so enjoyable. There were climbs but not many rock fields. I spent a long time hiking along a wonderful cascading stream. Even the climb up to the Priest Shelter wasn’t that bad. It was very hot for someone used to highs in the 40s so I kept up a good hydration plan.
I stopped at the Priest Shelter for water and lunch. There was a section hiker from Texas that comes out several times a year to check off different parts of the trail. 
Everything went downhill shortly after I left the shelter. The descent involved scrambling down boulders and slabs. I broke off both of my trekking pole tips which made the poles slip in places that I needed them to stick. I was slowly picking my way down when I slipped on a granite slab and fell head first. Fortunately I landed in a partial dirt area. My right leg hit a boulder hard and my glasses fell off. I was so glad that they didn’t break. I slowly got up and was surprised that my leg didn’t hurt. I had to go down the hill a bit to retrieve my water bottle. Then I noticed blood on my pants and a gash in my shin. The trail was a mess all the way down to the road where I’d start my last climb. 
It was getting late when I started the final big climb. I was hoping that the temperature would cool off at higher elevations. I had no idea what the conditions of the trail would be like. My goal was to make it to the Maupin Field Shelter. 
The first ⅔ of the trail was well graded with few rock fields and I made good time. I passed the last possible alternate campsite feeling confident that I could make it to my goal. 
Gradually the trail conditions got very challenging. Some sections looked like there was a landslide of boulders that covered the trail. “This too shall pass”, I kept reminding myself. I was just hoping that it would not be as bad as yesterday.  I got lucky. Even though there were plenty of rock fields to slow me down I could still find a path and for the most part keep up a reasonable pace. 
I happened to survive this gamble and got to the shelter with plenty of daylight left to do camp chores. 
A hiker from New York named Steve was setup in the shelter. He’s a Flip Flopper. A Flip Flopper is someone that starts somewhere between Maine and Georgia.  In Steve’s case he started in Pennsylvania and is hiking to Springer Mountain and then he flips back up to Pennsylvania and will hike north to finish on Katahdin. 
He was also a triathlete so we got along well. I decided to sleep in the shelter because it was supposed to rain tonight. I’m hiking into Waynesboro in the tomorrow and I didn’t want to have to deal with drying out a wet tent in a hotel room. 
My thin Therm-a-Rest z-lite pad works great on soft leaves or dirt but it doesn’t cut it on boards It wasn’t the best night’s sleep but I survived and woke up excited to get into town.","Hog Camp Gap

I kept telling myself that at least it wasn’t raining hard. “This too shall pass”. 
I started off with my wind jacket on under my rain poncho. During the climbs I started to get hot so I stopped and took off my warm gloves and wind jacket. As luck would have it I soon found myself on an exposed windy ridge. I started to get cold but I figured that once I got off the ridge and started descending I’d warm back up. I was wrong. I stayed cold for a long time. I stopped at the last shelter for a short break and to put on my rain jacket and warm gloves. I was shivering even though I was hiking hard. 
I also checked Guthooks and was disappointed that I still had 5 miles to go with much of it uphill. I thought that this was unacceptable and I didn’t want to walk for another 2 hours. So I charged out of there like a trail runner and only slowed down for trip hazards and the steep uphills. 
The trail pops out onto some highway that leads to Waynesboro. On the guardrail is a laminated list of trail angles that will pick you up and take you into town. I lucked out and got a ride from Tom in his Corvette. 
I decided to stay at Days Inn and finally got my Cracker Barrel breakfast for dinner.","Maupin Shelter

Virginia is still not flat. Post trail note: As you can see the past 2 posts were very short.  I made the decision to take some time off writing in depth journals.  Looking back I regret this decision.  I've been going back over my 2019 journey to prepare for my 2021 return.  This campground had plenty of sites.  I got there about an hour before sunset and the camp store was closed.  I wish that I had brought my Senior National Park pass so that I could have saved some money.  The camp hosts took pity on me and gave me a cold coke.  The ladies that I camped by gifted me some fresh fruit.  That night I woke up and noticed a shadow pass by my tent.  I looked out and didn't see anyone.  I asked my neighbors in the morning and they hadn't been up walking around in the night.  ""Ghost""?

Silver Streak ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610377,"AT day 56  4/13Zero dayI had a nice relaxing zero day in Harpers Ferry. It’s a beautiful town with lots of history. I stayed at the Quality Inn which has everything a hiker needs: laundry, breakfast and a manager willing to shuttle hikers to Walmart
The Trek hiker website(based on a thru hiker survey) has listed the Shenandoah region as one of the easiest. With the exception of a few sections the trail maintainers have done a miraculous job of clearing the trail of extensive damage from trees and tree limbs. Most of the climbs were short and well graded. 
I was looking forward to seeing spring colors and enjoying food from the waysides. Unfortunately for me my timing was off and I went through the park too early. 
I did have some trouble in the rock covered sections. On a steep descent of a rocky slab I lost my balance and fell face first. Both of my knees hit rocks hard and I tore up my wrists. I actually couldn’t believe that I hadn’t broken something. I was being extremely careful but my shoe caught on something and down I went. 
The real surprise was the Roller Coaster section. I’m not a student of the AT and had no clue that it was going to encompass the last 7 miles of a planned 30 mile day. The climbs and descents aren’t necessarily difficult. For me it was dealing with large sections of “trail” which were nothing more than sharply angled rocks and boulders. For some reason my ankles and feet don’t appreciate the stress. I made it to the shelter just before dark at 7:30. I was so happy to find a nice spot for my tent. 
The next day I hiked into Harpers Ferry. The beginning and end of the trail was mostly unrelenting rock fields. The middle was had nice tread which helped me speed up and beat the rain. 
I made it to the ATC Headquarters by 3:50. I thought that they closed at 4 and wanted to pick up my resupply package. The people that work there are very friendly and helpful. I got my picture taken for their photo album. 
I head north tomorrow. I’m so excited to be almost halfway done. It’s been quite the adventure.

4/24.   12 days of rest, recovery, healing at home
I apologize for not updating my journal for more than a week.  I had severe swelling issues with my feet and legs and didn’t want to update until I had a clean bill of health from my doctor. I got the go ahead today and I’ll be heading back to Harpers Ferry tomorrow. It’s a good thing I was good to go because I’d already bought plane and train tickets. 
The last time that I posted was on 13 April during my zero day at Harpers Ferry. My feet and legs didn’t hurt but my left ankle was swollen so I spent some time icing and elevating it. 
I woke up on Sunday and noticed that my feet and lower legs had swelled up to at least 2x their normal size.  They look like they belong to the Marshmallow Man. If you have ever seen your great grandmother's feet swell up, well that's what it looked like.  I thought that maybe lack of exercise during my zero day had caused the blood to pool in my lower extremities. I also still had a huge knot just below my left kneecap. The cuts and gouges on my knees and legs were still open but didn’t look infected.  I had scrubbed and cleaned them and kept antibiotic ointment and Band-Aids on them. I didn’t really feel any pain so I thought that I just had swelling that would go down after I started hiking and my muscles could start pushing the pooling blood and fluid back up to my heart.
I was thinking positive so I got up early, packed up and went downstairs to enjoy the limited offerings of the Quality Inn free breakfast.  I talked with a flip flopper from South Dakota that was starting her hike in the northbound direction. 
The Quality Inn is located within a quarter mile of the AT near the highway bridge that you walk under.  I got back on the AT and retraced my steps from Friday. As I walked I noticed that the skin on my legs felt like it was stretched tight. This was a weird sensation that I have never experienced before.
I decided that my body was trying to tell me that I needed to take a longer rest and allow the swelling in my legs and feet to go down.  I was concerned that I might have broken something. If I needed to get off trail for an extended period of time then Harpers Ferry was the perfect place to do it.  Next week was spring break so I could take the train to DC and fly home to recover and enjoy time with my wife (a teacher) and grandkids. 
While I was waiting for the plane I started probing different parts of my feet and legs.  Every bone on top of my feet hurt to touch. My left ankle was painful when I rotated it and it made weird cracking noises.  The muscles on both sides of my left tibia were tender and sore to the touch. 
My first day back I went to the doctor to make sure that I didn’t break anything during my numerous falls. I told the nurse practitioner about my  injuries and she sent me to get X-rays of both ankles and my left leg. The good news is that I didn’t have any fractured bones. I had acute tissue swelling, bursitis below my left knee cap and some swelling above my right patella. 
I spent the week keeping my feet elevated as much as possible to help reduce swelling. 
 I went to the Fleet Feet running store to learn about compression socks.  I almost bought the knee high socks but I thought that they were too dorky looking for me to actually wear while hiking. I used to laugh at triathletes that wore them. I settled on a pair of compression socks that extend just above the ankle.  These seem to have helped get the swelling down.
My ankle, foot bones, and left shin muscles started to hurt more as the swelling subsided. 
Something in the way I was hiking was causing trauma to my lower legs and feet.  I blame it on the uneven footing of the long rock fields that put constant stress on my muscles.  My wife thinks that the big miles I’ve been putting in might be another factor. 
I’ve been wearing Altra Lone Peaks to hike in for the past 4 years. They have always been supportive enough for our month long summer hikes on the John Muir Trail in the Sierra mountains.  I’ve never had foot swelling or ankle issues hiking with a pack loaded with snow gear over loose scree. 
The Lone Peaks don’t feel comfortable when I’m hiking over the ATs long rock fields. I know that they aren’t built to give you a super supportive ride while carrying a 20 to 30 pound backpack. I can feel the strain on my ankles and feet as I walk on the angular rocks.  They also don’t provide much protection for the times when my feet get caught between two sharp rocks. 
So I decided that I needed more protection and support from the rock fields.  I have a pair of rarely used hiking boots that I bought as required equipment for a snow skills course. I took them for a test walk on the Ravenel Bridge which is the only significant hill in Charleston, SC.  They’re too hot (because they have a waterproof lining) and they were too tight because my feet were swollen. So I went online and researched hiking shoes. I used Outdoor Gear Lab as my primary source and crossed referenced their recommendations with other websites. I didn’t want to buy shoes without trying them on, so I called around and found out that a local store, Halfmoon Outfitters had a good selection of hiking shoes.  I wanted to get the Salomon Ultra hiking shoes but they only had the GTX (waterproof) version which would be too hot and slow to dry. They did have a beefed up pair of Salomon trail running shoes (XA Pro 3D) that felt good on my feet and would provide much more stability and foot protection than my Lone Peaks. Of course you pay a slight weight penalty for the added protection but with Pennsylvania and the White Mountains coming up I had to change my footwear or get off the trail. 
The other thing I might change is the number of miles that I hike each day and my moving pace This will be hard for me because I enjoy hiking “fast” and having a challenging daily mileage goal. It is very rewarding to get to a campsite about 45 minutes before sunset after a challenging 30 mile day, when just a few hours ago I felt like I’d be lucky to get there before it got dark. 
So that’s what I’ve been up to.

Silver Streak ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611538,"4/25  Travel back to Harpers FerryI had to get up at 4 am to make my 6am flight from Charleston, South Carolina to Washington DC. You cant carry your trekking poles onto a plane so I needed to pay checked baggage fees. I went ahead and stuffed my REI duffel bag with my trekking poles, umbrella, 6 days of food and some gear.
I flew into Reagan Airport and took the Metro to Union Station. I made several errors on the Metro. First, I got on the blue line instead of the yellow line. I realized my mistake just in time to get off at a different stop and catch the yellow line. I did successfully get off the yellow line at the correct station. I asked a man directions about how to get on the red line.  He told me to follow the crowd upstairs to the red line train. Well I followed the crowd out of the station and up to the street. I found a person without earphones plugging their ears and she told me that i needed to go back downstairs. I went back down and explained my situation to the gate keeper so I wouldn’t have to pay again. 
I had about 7 hours to kill in D.C. before my train to Harpers Ferry left so I paid a bag storage fee and followed Google maps to the Air and Space Museum and then the Natural History Museum. I went to the planetarium to hear Neil Degrasse Tyson explain the Dark Universe.  I have no idea how astrophysicists figure this stuff out. I was glad that I didn’t have to take a quiz at the end.
I’m now on the train heading to Harpers Ferry.  Hopefully it arrives on time so that I can get to the outfitter before it closes.  I need to pick up a fuel canister and a mini-lighter. Hopefully they still have the canister and 2 lighters that I left for the hiker box when I left.
The train arrived in time for me to get to the outfitters.  The fuel and lighters that I left were gone so I bought new ones. The salesman told me the flat route to get to the Quality Inn. I’m pretty tired from my travel so I decided to stay in Harpers Ferry an extra day so I can start refreshed on Saturday.

If I want to make it to Katahdin I need to take better care of my body. After all, I’m not 55 anymore.
I had planned to leave the Quality Inn and start hiking back to where I left off on the AT around 8 am. However,  after breakfast I discovered that I left my headlamp at home. The outfitter doesn’t open until 10 am so I had a choice of hiking out without a headlamp or waiting for the store to open.  I have a Luci solar lantern that I hang in my tent for normal nighttime use. I only use my headlamp for nighttime pee runs or to locate something hiding in a darker space inside the tent. I could always use my phone’s light for my pee breaks so I was leaning towards leaving early.  Then I thought about what I would use if it was windy and I’d have to adjust my stakes at night. 
After spending 2 weeks at home recovering from my first 1025 miles I knew that I’d need to ease back into the trail.  If I waited for the store to open I’d be forced to do a short day. So I got an iced latte and a chocolate chip cookie to enjoy while i waited for the outfitter to open.  They only had one type of headlamp, Wilcor brand, but it wasn’t expensive and had all the right functions.
I started hiking out of Harpers Ferry around 10:30 am. 
Today’s hike seemed custom made for getting back on the trail.  The sun was shining and a cool breeze kept the temperatures perfect.  The topography of the terrain made for easy hiking. The short uphills and downhills were just steep enough to test your muscles and stamina.  
If I was going to do a Flip Flop, I’d go to the Flip Flop Festival and then hike north to Katahdin
Maryland has been a great state to hike in.  I passed by several Civil War monuments during the day.  One of these places had restrooms, trash cans, and water.
I stopped hiking at 5:15 to set up camp at the Dahlgren Backpacker Campground.  It was packed with Boy Scouts and weekend backpackers but I was able to secure a picnic table and a place to put up my tent.  They even have hot showers. Your spoiling me Maryland. 
It was odd only hiking 17 miles but I’m glad I kept it short. Tomorrow I plan on hiking either 19 or 24 miles. 
My Salomon XA Pro 3D trail runners made a huge difference for me on the rocky sections of the trail.  They protected my feet much better than my Lone Peaks. The toe bumper guard actually works. I never felt pain wherever I stubbed my toe.

The facilities have been the best I’ve seen on the trail.  Raven Rock shelter is very nice but I’m camping on one of the many tent pads that they have nicely spaced in the area. The tenting sites even have picnic tables or benches.
Maryland has been beautiful. The forests are alive with the fresh vibrant greens of new leaves and wildflowers are starting to bloom.  Annapolis Rocks is an amazing geological formation and I was treated to picture perfect views today. 
I want to say thank you to all of the trail angels out there that go out of their way to do special things for hikers. The Real Deal is a trail angel who has been following my journal and with no way to contact me she drove out to various trail crossings today to try and meet up with me to provide me some sandwiches and cookies.  I found this out from John aka Very at the Raven Rocks Shelter. She left John her number and I called her to say thank you. We had a short chat and she described all of the things that she does for hikers that she follows on Trail Journals. It’s amazing to me how kind, generous and giving people are. 
Tomorrow I bid Maryland farewell and enter Pennsylvania. Time will tell what adventures await me in this state.  Hopefully my Salomon trail runners will take me across the rock fields with the same protection they afforded me in Maryland.

I wanted to hike 23 miles to Caledonia State park today and I had no idea what to expect from the trail so I got up and took my usual slow time getting out of camp at 6:50.
My first stop was the High Rock overlook.  I’m glad that I took the short side trail instead of bypassing it.  The views were fantastic and the area is rather eclectic. I don’t condone graffiti but the graffiti at this spot seems to fit. Perhaps because it is so colorful and there is so much of it.  I just wish people wouldn’t need to write the f word.
My next stop was a large parking area with memorials for the Battle For South Mountain. I met a young guy that had been hammocking in a park picnic shelter (illegal).  He had completed the 4 state challenge last night, It involves hiking 43.2 miles from the Virginia/West Virginia border and then hiking all the way through Maryland and tagging the Mason Dixon line which marks the beginning of Pennsylvania.  He hikes in sandals! Oh to be young and daring. 
The next landmark was the marker for the Mason Dixon line.  I was out of my beloved Maryland and entering Pennsylvania. 
Pennsylvania is known s Rocksylvania by AT hikers because the northern part of the state is supposed to have miles of rock fields.
I had lunch at Old Forge State Park which had all of the thru hiker necessities; water, trash cans, bathroom, and picnic tables.
Guthook has a comment and a section hiker told me that Rocky Mountain had some serious scrambling sections.  I guess they’ve never been hiking in Virginia because there were only a few very short sections where I had to use my hands.
I was excited to hike into Caledonia State Park around 4:15.  This would make have made for a 23 mile day. I searched around for the park headquarter to find out about camping. The headquarters was closed but I saw 2 employees going to their cars and asked them about camping. $30 dollars for a tent, I don’t think so. Comments on Guthook don’t mention that they charge you $30 for a tent site.  I was looking foreword to running water and a hot shower but not if I had to pay RV prices to pitch a tent. Fifteen dollars is what I paid at the Lewis Campground in the Shenandoah National Park. The backpackers campground I stayed at in Maryland was free.
So I wasted 30 minutes of hiking time at the state park. I needed to hike another 2.2 miles uphill to Quarry Rock Shelter.  The climbs were steep but relatively short. The shelter area is unlike any other. There are potted plants, fancy decorations, a bench swing and other niceties. There’s even air freshener in the privy 
The bad thing was that there’s a large group of college age people that took up most of the tent sites. There are two large raised wooden tent platforms near the shelter. I decided to set up Zpacks Duplex tent on the platform instead of tenting around noisy kids. My tent doesn’t have a metal pole frame to attach the tent to. These types of tents are called freestanding.  Mine is supported by my 2 trekking poles and 8 guylines that you normally stake into the ground, You can’t drive stakes into the wood but there were plenty of large rocks that I could have used to secure the guylines. I discovered that the platform has toggle bolts around the perimeter that I could secure my guylines to with a little creative rigging.

I’ve spent the beginning of my journey hiking up the left side, i reached the apex today and now I get to slide down the right side all the way to Katahdin. It’s going to motivating to watch the miles go down.  I only have 75 miles until I’ll be in the triple digits (miles to go).
Today’s section of Pennsylvania was made for speed.  Sure there were uphills and rocky descents but the majority of the trail made for quick walking.  I left the shelter around 7 am and made it the 17 plus miles to the Pine Furnace Store and park just after noon.  The store and the AT museum were closed. Why no love for the early starters, after all we left early to minimize the number of people on the trail and we endured nasty cold weather. There was an AT thru hiker from the class of 2013 that gave me a coke,

I hiked up the road to the Green Mountain General Store to get a turkey sandwich, ice cream bar and root beer to eat while I finished my hike. I packed out Fritos and Oreos to add to my dinner. 
I got to my campsite around 5:30. It’s listed on Guthook as Spring and Tenting mile 1115.4. It unexpectedly started to rain right after I cooked dinner and was getting ready to filter water. Luckily I had my tent setup so I picked up everything and tossed it into the tent. 
 I only have 33 miles to Duncanon where I’ll pick up my resupply box from the post office on Thursday. I’ll sleep in tomorrow (Wednesday) and only hike 23 miles to the Darlington Shelter.

Silver Streak ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612193,"AT day 61   5/122.4 miles to Darlington Shelter Today was supposed to be a relaxing easy day with a 22 mile hike to the Darlington Shelter.  I didn’t set my alarm and let the beautiful melodies of the birds wake me up. My plan was to hike the 8 miles to Boiling Springs and treat myself to a late breakfast at the Cafe.
The day started off with a uphill hike to the top of a hill with huge boulders that you need to scramble up.  This is a very short section and I only had to hoist myself up a few boulders. I met another northbound Flip Flopper up in the boulder field.  I stopped and talked with her. She was having terrible shin splint problems. I said happy trails and then hiked on for about 5 minutes. 
The center horizontal support of my Zpacks Arc Haul has been popping out of its pouch.  I had to stop, take off my pack and store it inside my pack. This has become very irritating.  No matter how I pack the stuff in my pack this support comes loose. 
This was the point when my day went “south”, and I mean I literally South. I got turned around (once again) and headed South back the way I came.  I saw the same women that I talked to minutes before and I thought she was a southbounder. I didn’t remember the lady that I had talked with wearing a floppy hat.  I told her that she had some boulders coming up and hiked past her. I saw her again later and she said that she didn’t recognize me either. I guess us old hikers all look the same.
So I was making good time going back the way I came this morning.  I even saw a strange flat rock formation that looked like it could be used for devil worshipping sacrifices.  I thought it odd that there was two of these formations, but maybe the settlers erected these. It didn’t even register in my brain that  something was wrong when I passed my campsite. I hiked another 0.7 miles south to a road that had an AT sign that pointed to the North and South directions.  At first I thought that the sign had been switched around. I got out my Guthook App and sure enough I screwed up again. So much for my late morning breakfast  in Boiling Springs.
So what did I do? I got very mad at myself and took off running.  I wasn’t quite sure yet how many extra miles I hiked but I knew that it was too many.  When I got back to the spot where I took off my pack I calculated that I hiked south close to 2.5 miles for a bonus 5 mile round trip.
Of course now I’m paranoid about getting turned around and I’m frequently checking Guthook to make sure my AT mileage is increasing.
Boiling Springs is another of those picturesque towns that the AT passes straight through.  The AT center was closed but the water faucet was working. I went to the gas station and payed exorbitant prices for a junk food fix.  There should be a law that requires mini-marts to clearly post the prices of their merchandise. Another thing that bugs me is you have to buy 2 sodas or Gatorades to get the discount prices. I packed out mini crumb doughnuts and Oreos for tonight’s desert.
I left Boiling Springs at 1:30 with 14 miles to hike to the Darlington Shelter.  Lucky for me the topography of the trail made for fast hiking. Guthooks warns you to bring plenty of water for the next stretch because of agricultural runoff. 
The last 3 miles to the shelter is uphill.  As I was climbing, my mind would reprimand me for my mistake.  I would have been there by now if I would slow down and pay more attention to where I’m going. I closed off these negative thoughts by saying to myself; ""This too shall pass”.
I got to the shelter before 6 pm and found a great tenting site.  There were 2 section hikers there that  I enjoyed talking with. One guy had this tiny little Zpacks Nero pack that he was using. 
So I ended up doing 22.4 AT miles and 5 bonus miles that don’t count.

Silver Streak ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612212,"AT day 62   5/211.1 miles to Duncannon Post Office (nero)The mornings that I hike into town are always exciting.  I dream about a shower, laundry, a comfortable bed and some good food. I got up early so I could hike 11 miles to get to the Duncannon Post Office before it closed at 11 am for lunch.  
Fog rolled into the campsite last night and made everything wet.  The dew dripping off the trees onto my tent sounded like a light rain.  The rocks on the trail were wet which called for cautious hiking. After yesterday’s flat trail I was surprised by the number of rocky sections this morning.  The descent into Duncannon is very steep and has many rocky steps. I was glad that I wasn’t hiking southbound and have to climb up those big rock steps. 
On the way down I heard a pop from my backpack and figured that the top support bar must have come loose.  When I got to the post office I discovered that the vertical support stay (pole) had poked a hole in the pouch on the bottom of the pack that keeps it in place. I emailed Zpacks and in keeping with their outstanding customer service they are going to send me a new pack. It’s going to be around 6 days before I can pick it up.
I made it to the post office in plenty of time and picked up my resupply package.  I called the Red Carpet Inn and the manager drove to the post office to pick me up.  He is very hiker friendly and even offers free rides to the closest restaurant. 
I head back to the trail tomorrow morning at 8am. It’s supposed to rain tomorrow and Sunday.  No rain, no Maine.

The hiking today wasn’t easy today.  I guess that the easy Pennsylvania is behind me. Pennsylvania starts you off with some easy hiking to make up for what I hear are horrendous rocky trails to the north.  It’s really hard for me to believe that the trail can get anymore rocky. 
In one rocky section I got my shoe wedged between 2 rocks and couldn’t get my foot free without taking my shoe off.  Thank goodness I didn’t trip with my foot stuck I might have broken something. 
My highlight for the day was that i saw my first wild porcupine. I just happened to be in an area without a lot of rocks and I could look around a little and enjoy the forest instead of staring at my feet so I don’t trip.

The highlight of my day, the highlight of Pennsylvania was hiking the section of the trail where some beavers decided to build a pond. The AT has an dry feet alternate that takes you on some boring forest service roads.  But you are really missing out on a special experience if you don’t wade past the pond. I changed into my Luna sandals that I use for camp shoes. The water flooding the trail was just above my ankles (and it rained last night).  I don’t care if it was knee deep it would have been worth it. Just think of all those PCT hikers that will be fording ice cold knee high rivers and creeks soon. I even saw a mating pair of frogs.
I also enjoyed the cute red-orange salamander I saw by my campsite this morning. While I was walking along a ridge a mother grouse walked quickly across the trail trying to lead me away from her babies.  I surprised aa garter snake that slithered off the trail into the bushes.
As for the trail I’d classify it as 25% horrendous huge boulder fields.  In some instances it was difficult to see which way the actual trail went.  Annoying rock fields and rocky strewn trail comprised about 45% of the trail.  The rocks and boulders were especially hazardous in the morning due to being slick from the rain we had during the night. The remaking trail was the type where you can get a smooth stride going and cover the ground quickly.
I’m camped up on a ridge by the Shower Steps Overlook.  There is a wonderful view of farmlands, valleys, and a mountain range.  Unfortunately with the farmland you get the aroma of cows. The only downside of this campsite is that you have to carry water from shelter 501 3 miles uphill and over some nasty rocks. What’s with all of these dry campsites on the AT.
It’s supposed to rain starting late tonight and most of the day tomorrow.  There is a flash flood watch for the area. Yikes!

Silver Streak ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612593,"AT day 65   5/521 miles to Port Clinton Post Office I’ve been lucky with the timing of the rain.  The past few days rain has been forecasted to either last all day or start in the late afternoon.  Last night I was able to get my camp set up and eat dinner before it rained. Last night was a steady rain but it was over before I woke up.  
I’ve been having problems with one end of my tent allowing some of the water that flows off the tent to drip into the mesh opening and then into the foot of the tent. I don’t know if I’m not pitching it correctly or if the mesh screen is stretched.  The opposite end is perfect (knock on wood) so I make sure that the good end is upslope where my head is. I keep the end that causes me trouble at the foot so it’s downslope and any water that gets in pools at the bottom. 
It was forecasted to rain all day and then around 5pm the chances of rain decreased.  Well where I was the opposite happened. I enjoyed a cool overcast day. I only got wet when the wind blew water off the trees.  About a half an hour before I got to Port Clinton it started raining. I rigged up my umbrella and hiked to the post office where a driver from Cabellas Sporting Goods store came to pick me up.  What an amazing service they provide to AT hikers. He dropped me off at the Microtel hotel where I holed up to dry off and get my attitude adjusted. 
I guess most people don’t mind the terrible rocks and boulders strewn across the trail but for some reason I can’t stand them and can’t wait to get out of Rocksylvania.  I was carefully watching my footing and slipped on a wet boulder, I caught my fall with my right hand and sprained my wrist. Now I have to try not to use my trekking pole with my right hand unless absolutely necessary.

Pennsylvania was good to me today.  Sure there were rocks all over the trail but there weren't any huge steep scrambling up and over huge boulders climbs like the one out of Lehigh Gap yesterday.  The one section that was listed as sketchy, Wolf Rocks, wasn’t even close to the Knife Edge section I did yesterday. 
After so many days of hiking through rock fields I developed a sense of where to place my feet to avoid the most pain and trip hazards.  I credit my Salomon XaPro 3D trail runners for giving my feet the stability I needed to avoid the problems I had with the Altra Lone Peaks.  Post trail note:  The Salomon were great shoes on dry trail.  Once the trail became wet due to rain or snowmelt the shoes were worthless.  The insoles would bunch up when they got wet.  I ended up removing them and throwing them away.  They also didn't stick very well to wet slick rock.  I found myself slipping in areas that the Lone Peaks wouldn't. 
Right after the descent from Wolf Rocks the trail became noticeably easier.  The last 8 miles to Delaware Water Gap was the easiest section since I left Port Clinton 3 days ago. 
I got to the Post Office and picked up my replacement backpack around 4 pm.  Time flies when you get to town and you have so much to do. I spent a lot of time stripping all of my pouches and pockets and cords off of my old pack and putting them on my new pack,

I never get a good sleep in a shelter but I’d rather have a poor sleep than have to put up and take down a tent in 40 degree rain. I’m a light sleeper so I wake up quite often with any little sound that is out of the ordinary.  Some creature was scurrying around for a while last night. Everyone turns in the sleep and I usually wake up when someone turns over because the air mattresses backpackers use are very noisy.
Today’s hike was a mix bag of trail conditions.  The uphills were accompanied by large wet rocky slabs that you had to use caution with or you would slip and fall at a weird angle.  The descents took you into a mucky muddy mess or to a trail that had been turned into a stream. I don’t mind wet feet but I learned in the Smoky Mountains that you want to keep mud out of your shoes or your feet will get messed up.  [I know, Vermont (Vermud) will require miles of walking in deep boot sucking mud.]
As you can see by the picture the tread of my shoes got shredded by the Pennsylvania rocks.  They were new 334 miles ago when I restarted the trail in Harpers Ferry. The upper parts of the shoes have no holes and the toe bumper guard is still attached.  I thank these shoes for getting me through Pennsylvania without any significant falls and happy ankles and feet. 
Last night I suggested that we take a Nero to ride out the nasty weather that was forecast for today (Monday).  I also needed to meet my GCHH/AARP/Triple Crown Challenge/Hike with Mike team to get my next resupply. Meeting in a nice cozy motel room seemed a lot smarter than at a trailhead in the cold rain.
We had light rain this morning and then it stopped raining until we got to the Appalachian Motel in Vernon, NJ. It has been a steady nasty cold rain since then and now at 8:30pm it is still raining.  Hopefully the rain will let up tomorrow. 
The guide books list 2 shelters for consideration tomorrow.  The first one is only 18 miles from the Route 94 trailhead and the second one is about 31 miles away and has a huge bear problem.  There aren’t any normal tenting campsites listed in the guidebooks so we will probably stop at the first one or maybe hike a little further and find a unlisted tenting area that sometimes pop up along the trail.

In my opinion the trail had all of the bad elements from each state that I’ve hiked so far all jumbled together in a relentless series of steep climbs followed immediately by a steep descent. There should be a standard for the maximum grade allowed on descents.  There is a point where a person with a backpack succumbs to the forces of gravity and momentum when scrambling down extremely steep ledges. We were lucky that the rocks weren’t wet but the leaves made for slippery conditions.
We rewarded our morning efforts by walking the 1 mile into Kent to get some comfort food from the IGA market.  Watermelon, a pint of frozen chocolate yogurt, an orange and a bottle of Starbucks for a snack. I bought a large container of Oreos and demolished most of them during dinner.

WOW and I were the only hikers at the campsite so we setup our tents underneath a covered pavilion. It took some ingenuity but we managed to get both of our Zpacks Duplex tents to fit. For those of you unfamiliar with the Duplex, it uses both of your trekking poles for support and 8 guylines which require a large footprint. It’s a good thing we setup under cover because a good rainstorm blew through during the night 
All of that rain made for humid weather and slippery rocks. 
Around 7am we came upon a trail alert sign concerning a hazardous creek crossing with a suggested blue blazed alternative. I told WOW that us JMT and PCT hikers aren’t afraid of any AT crossing. I walked through the rapids with my trail shoes on. When I got to the other side I dropped my pack and went back in for a bath. I rinsed out my socks and running shorts.
 I usually have a pair of running shorts to hike in and one to sleep in. When I woke up this morning my hiking shorts smelled so bad that I couldn’t bring myself to put them on so I hiked in my sleeping shorts. I hung everything on the back of my pack with small elastic line and cord locks. By the end of the day my shorts were dry and fresh smelling but my socks were still a little damp so I wore them around camp in my sandals and they dried 
The hiking was much more enjoyable today. The trail was still a roller coaster of steep uphills followed immediately by steep descents but there were not any of those steep boulder descents where you could easily break your body if you fell. 
We picked up our resupply from the AARP/I Hike With Mike support van around 1:30 at Falls Village. We then walked up to the Toymakers Café and were disappointed to see that it’s not open on Monday. The owner happened to be gardening out front so we put on our most pitiful hungry hiker faces and asked if there was anywhere else in town to get some coffee. She said that she had some left over coffee and invited us into her café. Once inside I spotted the bakery display and asked if we could buy some baked goods. Now we had coffee and great baked treats. She said that she might be able to make us a sandwich. She called her husband to come down and make us each a sandwich. How nice of these people. Of course we had to pay a pretty penny but it was a treat for the stomach and a treat to meet some fine caring people. 
By the time we left we had a choice of two shelters. The closest shelter was only 3ish miles away and if we stopped there it would be a disappointing 18.1 mile day. The other shelter was 10 miles away and would be perfect for us to maintain our target daily mileage. Severe thunderstorms were forecast and the rain clouds were moving into the area so we decided on the closest shelter. 
Limestone Shelter itself is old and I didn’t care for it. I was going to setup inside the shelter but changed my mind after the skies cleared and setup my tent in one of the areas many campsites. 
Hopefully tomorrow we can get back on track with our mileage goals.

Silver Streak ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614280,"AT Day 81   5/2117.4 miles to Hemlock Shelter (plus 10 bonus miles)Well I did the unthinkable again.  I left the Limestone Shelter and hiked the ½ mile up to the AT.  Then I turned south and started hiking the wrong way. I even checked Guthook to make sure that I was going the north.  My brain must not have been working because I merrily hiked south down all the steep terrain that I’d hiked up yesterday.  When I saw a dam spillway or falls area I had that sick to my stomach feeling that I had gotten turned around again.
Needless to say I was very mad at myself.  I really didn’t want to hike the 2.7 miles back up the steep grade to the shelter sign.  I checked Guthook and noticed that I could take some secondary roads to Route 44 and the follow route 44 to where it intersects with the AT.  From there I was hoping to meet up with WOW and hopefully he would guard my pack while I ran up south bound to the shelter sign and then I could run back down.  At the time I thought the road walk would be shorter than it was (it was at least 3 miles) and the return trip to the shelter sign less than 3 miles. The elevation profile looked like I could spend most of my time running.
WOW graciously agreed to watch my pack and told me that I actually had 3.5 miles each way.  I took off fueled by Amazing Grass (health food drink mix) and part of a ProBar. I used my trekking poles to my full advantage, to power me up the hills and steady me on the descents.  I was fortunate that the majority of the trail had few trip hazards and I was able to tag the sign and get back down in 1 hour and 45 minutes. The picture on this page is proof that I ran the bonus miles up to the shelter sign so I could turn around and complete every northbound AT mile.  Once again I’m insecure about my navigational abilities so I checked Guthook multiple times to make sure that my position on the trail was increasing in mileage.
WOW has his own journal on this site called Monarch and WOW, so read his journal if you want to read about what its like to have a bonehead for a hiking partner.
I must say that in my opinion Massachusetts is the most beautiful state thus far. You can always tell when you are hiking on a popular day hiker trail because the New England trail builders actually use switchbacks and try to avoid steep life and limb damaging descents.  The climb up to the summit of Bear Mountain was fairly easy. Once on the summit most day hikers turnaround. They are actually missing the best part. The ridge line follows the top of the mountain for a long time with the most stunning views that the AT has offered to this point.  It was windy but the air felt cool, crisp, and fresh. We took a break in the sunshine on top of the mountain and discussed the events of the day. Despite my screw up we had still managed to put in some descent miles for the trail condition.
I was loving Massachusetts and singing its praises and then the steepest nasty climb of the trip came up.  I don’t know how you could climb up these nearly vertical rock walls in the rain. The climb just kept going on and on and on.  I even stopped on the way up which is something I normally refuse to do. But like all uncomfortable experience on this trail, the climb passed into a distant memory worth telling stories about some day.  
Then came the descent. Once again, I think there should be a standard gradient allowed for a hiking trail.  It was ridiculously hazardous in places and was made worse by the buildup of dead leaves. I use trees as much as possible to help me on descents.  I grabbed a small tree and somehow slipped and my backpack pivoted me around backwards. WOW with his quick reactions spun around and pushed up on my backpack to help me recover.  
I also fell off a perfectly good double logged bridge backwards into the water because I looked up.  The water felt refreshing.
Despite my mistake and the tough trail conditions we managed to hike a respectable 17.4 AT miles to the Hemlock Shelter. I figured that I had done around 10 bonus miles to add to my day.
Tomorrow we hike to a parking area to be picked up for a Nero and resupply.

We hiked through a variety of terrain today. Farm fields usually mean that you’ll eventually encounter a mucky muddy section and get your feet wet. That’s what happened early in my hike and I got my brand new shoes wet and muddy. The forest sections were wonderful to walk through. Everything is green and the birds are out doing their best serenades. Thankfully the trail was well graded and maintained. 
We had to stop early at the Shaker campsite, having done only 19.5 miles because we didn’t have time to reach the next shelter. This campsite is known for bear activity. We saw a bear and her cubs near the trail about a tenth of a mile from the campsite. 
WOW found 4 ticks on his clothes after dinner. I found a dead tick in my tent. I think that it was on my pants which are treated with permethrin and died. 
We had a short period of rain. The forecast calls for a few hours of rain tonight. 
The bear stayed out of the campsite. Around midnight a strong thunderstorm with hard rain came through. The rain lasted less than a hour but it came down so hard that it bounced off the wooden platform my tent was on and splashed up into the tent’s mesh netting that covers the opening.

However, I couldn’t find a place to get picked up without hiking too many miles. So we decided to hike 21 miles to route 9, and spend 2 nights in Bennington Vermont.
We said goodbye to Massachusetts and hello to Vermont. 
It didn’t take long to find out why hikers call the state Vermud. There were many boggy muck pits that gave you no choice but to tramp through the shoe sucking muck. 
The final descent to route 9 was another ridiculously steep slippery mess. I went slow and carefully placed my feet but I still managed to slip and fall gently over at least 5 times. I was almost down when I slipped again and I was so mad that I threw my trekking poles down the trail. Not a great idea when you need them to hold up your tent.

19.1 miles to Story Spring Shelter 
We left the warm, dry comfortable hotel to hike in the  cold rain. Heck if you want to get to Katahdin you will have to hike in the rain. But come on it’s the last week of May and the high temperature is around 45 with a very cold windchill. Meanwhile back home in South Carolina they are experiencing a hotter than normal May and a drought.
Today we were on a section that the AT shares with the Long Trail.  There were quite a few Long Trail hikers out today.  This first shelter we stopped at to get out of the rain was full of Long Trail hikers.  They kind of gave us the stink eye when we came in.  I think that they thought we were going to stop and beg for shelter space.  Ha!  We are AT thru hikers and had more miles to put in. 
We hiked into the shelter area around 5pm and the area was already packed. I can’t understand why these people stop hiking so early. 
 Three people were hogging the shelter so I asked them to move their stuff so WOW and I could fit. I was shivering from the windchill on my wet rain gear and wasn’t in the mood for shelter drama. The more I thought about staying in the shelter the more depressed I became so I went in search of a campsite. Post trail note: One guy I asked to make some room had a crazy look in his eye.  He said his trail name was hatchet of chop, I don't remember which one but it was crazy, and he said if I mess with him I will find out how he got that name.  This was not the thing to say to an AT thru hiker right after news that an AT hiker was murdered by a crazy man with a machete. I didn't want to post this information in the original journal post in case I ran into him again.)
I pitched the tent on a slanted site but sliding downhill a little is a price I’ll pay for more privacy and comfort. 
I use an umbrella to keep the rain off my upper body. It usually works great but today the wind was blowing the rain on my rain jacket. It kept me dry on the inside but now the jacket is wet. The bottoms of my pants are also wet. I’m hanging them from one of the trekking poles that holds up my tent. Post trail note: This was one of the few times that I didn't use my Zpacks rain poncho.  I don't remember why I didn't use it but I obviously paid the price.  I also don't wear my pants when I hike in the rain.  Today was one of maybe 3 days that I got almost hypothermic from the rain.
I put on my dry camp clothes and climbed into my sleeping bag to warm up. I was going to cook outside my tent but my lighter stooped working so I had to go cook at the shelter to borrow a lighter. WOW gave me his extra lighter. Post trail note: This campsite required creative rigging of my Zpacks Duplex guylines.  This campsite along with several others and the wooden platforms is why I decided to purchase the Flex kit for my next hike.","Route 9 Trailhead

The clouds were condensing on the trees and then water drops would fall onto the shelter.
I fell in love with Vermont today. 
This morning the forest was shrouded in a light mist like fog. Dew was dripping off the trees and the forest floor was covered with ferns and a variety of flowering plants from small ground cover to Queen Ann’s Lace that must have been five feet high. As we climbed up the mountain I felt like I was in a Jurassic Park movie and a T-Rex or velociraptor was lurking around the next bend in the lush foliage.  It also smelled like fresh cut Christmas trees. 
Almost the entire day was filled with delightful sights, sounds and smells. We walked along several fast moving rivers and enjoyed sounds of the water pouring over rocks. We hiked along the rocky shoreline of several picturesque ponds and meadows. These should be prime moose habitat but we didn’t see any.  We did see several spots with moose poop.

Sure there still was the occasional mud pit and crazy rock scrambling but the beauty of Vermont’s wilderness made it all worthwhile. There were even sections that resembled what a real trail should look like. Sometimes I stop hiking because I’m overwhelmed by the grandeur of the forest. I pause and immerse myself in the sights, smells and sounds. I am very grateful that I have the privilege to be here.
The reddish orange salamanders were out in droves. I must have seen more than 100 crawling around right on the trail. It’s a good thing that they are so brightly colored or they would get stepped on 
The most memorable part of today was seeing the 500 miles to Katahdin sign. We stopped for a few minutes to take pictures and congratulate each other. As I hiked away from the marker I reflected on everything I’ve been through to get to that point. I must admit that I got a little teary eyed from the pride that I felt for hiking 1692 miles.  
The last climb of the day took us up to Killington Peak. Sections of the climb were extremely difficult  Unlike other arduous climbs that we’ve done recently this climb had not only spectacular scenery but it also had a lot of moose poop. I spent a good deal of the climb scanning the forest for signs of a moose. Unfortunately the moose were too well hidden. 
Tomorrow we hike about 8 miles to where the GCHH/AARP/I hike with Mike support van will pick us up for a Nero in Rutland Vermont. My hiking pants are caked in mud, my socks are wet, stinky and disgusting and I’m desperately in need of a good scrubbing to get the filth off of me. 
I’ve tried rinsing my socks out in streams and hanging them from my backpack but it’s been so humid that they don’t dry. 
My feet are getting gross because they stay wet all day from walking in mud or streams. The insoles to my Salomon XA Pro 3D running shoes are worthless in wet conditions. They absorb water and then bunch up. I finally took them out today and the shoes feel drier and more comfortable.

22.6 miles to Pomfret Road
Yesterday I checked the camping options for today and they didn’t quite sync with our plans.  Normally we are up at the first bird song (4:45) and lately I’ve been able to pack up and do my morning duties quicker and we have been on the trail by 5:45.  However, yesterday was a Nero day which meant breakfast at the hotel and a drive to the trailhead with a likely hiking start at 7:30.  With this in mind the first shelter at 14 miles was unacceptable and the next shelter at around 26 miles would be too far because in addition to the late start the forecast called for sever thunderstorms.  After last weeks cold rain from heck we knew that we would have to slow down and be more cautions around slippery rocks and roots in the rain.
So what to do? I was listening to the Mighty Blue on The Appalachian Trail podcast and he mentioned that he would take days off to avoid severe weather.  Why be cold and miserable if you don’t have to be. A day off doesn’t work with our let’s get this trail done ASAP plan but it would be nice to be able to go to a hotel and get dry after a full day of hiking.
So that is what we did.  Our support vehicle dropped us off at the trailhead we stopped at yesterday and picked us up at Pomfret Road so we got to eat breakfast and hike 22.6 miles.Back to Rutland for a warm comfortable night in a motel.
Toward the end of the day I started dreaming about chicken pot pie, ice cream and the dry support van.  I got impatient and took off like Silver Streak and power walked/ran the last 6 miles.

The trail conditions were pretty good for the most part.  
The small little black flies are out in force.  They all line up along the ascents and wait for slow tired hikers as they drag themselves up a steep climb.  The flies seem particularly fond of your eyes. I wear glasses which protect me from all but the most persistent of these pest.  Any fly that gets near my mouth gets sucked in when I take a huge breath of air to help me get up the climb.  I've found that my permethrin treating clothes and Picardan for my arms, neck and cheeks keeps mosquitoes and black flies away.
The rewards for all of this effort are stunning views of rugged mountains. We climbed a fire tower on Smart Mountain to get above the tree tops and had 360 degree views along with 20 mph winds and a cold wind chill. 
We made it to the Hexamid shelter around 7:15 which is an hour later than my goal stopping time of between 5 and 6.  We wanted to have a shorter 14.5 mile day tomorrow because it supposed to rain tonight which will make the trail conditions dangerous and we need to try to make it to the Glencliff Post Office before 2pm so that WOW can pick up a bounce box at the post office.

14.6 miles to NH Route 25 Trailhead (Glencliff)
Before I start ranting and raving let me say that the majority of my AT adventure has been a wonderful experience.  I have seen beautiful places and shown myself that I can adapt to a variety of environmental conditions and rise to the challenges that the trail has provided me.
You can call me a wimp, whiner, or an ungrateful AT wannabe but today was a perfect example of what I hate about this trail.  It rained last night and was still sprinkling when we left the shelter at 5:45.  It didn’t take too long before the trail got dangerous.  Some of the large rocky outcrops we were expected to traverse looked like a mirror due to their glacier polished surfaces.  The trail down the mountain was steep and filled with hazards.  You basically had to pick your poison on the way down.  You could select irregular shaped slippery rocks which threw me off balance, slick roots covered with wet leaves which acted like ice, or wet dirt which was my preferred surface but if the trail was steep the muddy dirt gave way to a mud slide and took me with it. After and hour of this I chose the wrong path, the mud gave way, I slipped and turned around to fall on my right knee and left hip. Frustrated I once again threw my trekking pole down the trail in disgust and just sat down on a rock.  WOW came back to check on me and we took a break.
Once we got to a lower elevation the odds of breaking my leg decreased but the odds of filling my shoes with mud increased exponentially. Vermont has nothing over New Hampshire when it comes to miles of mucky muddy trail. I know I’m complaining and hundreds of people happily slop through the mud every year but I think it sucks.
Remember I started on February 17th and hiked in freezing rain, blowing snow, and winds that knocked me off the trail. I loved it when I didn't have to worry about breaking a leg.  I’m impressed by people who aren’t bothered by these conditions, i just happen to be gravitational challenged and lose my balance and fall more than others.  WOW slips but never falls.  He is like a cat.

The climb up to Mt Moosilauke was a wonderful trail and and not too steep.. It must be the trail designed for day hikers.  There were a few areas of snow that were easy to walk over or around.  There was a nice refreshing breeze blowing and the air smelled fresh with the occasional whiff of cut fur trees.  Once we got above tree line we were rewarded with 360 degree views of the surrounding mountains.  
The scene on the summit reminded me of the summits on the John Muir Trail.  Groups of people we’re gathered around windbreaks eating their lunch while newcomers gathered by the summit sign for pictures.
The descent was horrible. It had rained last night and this side of the mountain didn’t get enough sun to dry things out.  The one fall that I had was entirely my fault.  I tried to quickly unwrap a Cliff bar while walking.  The next thing I know, I’ve fallen, jammed by left pinky finger again and banged my left knee.  I also bent one of my trekking poles so bad that it snapped. I was tense from this point the whole way down.
The sights and smells at the summit made the whole day worthwhile.

I’ve decided to stop writing journal entries for the rest of my AT journey.  I will continue hiking with WOW until we both reach the summit of Katahdin.

The reason why I’m stopping my journal is because I’m not enjoying the White Mountains.  The forests, streams, smells and cool winds are all wonderful but I find the trail itself to be horrendous. I don’t want to spend each night whining about every aspect of the trail that I find appalling.

Thanks for following along on my journey.

Post trail note:  I was very stressed out due to little finger that WOW kept saying I needed to get x-rayed.  I resented the trail for what I perceived as dangerous and blamed it for an injury that could end my hike.  It wasn't the trails fault, I was trying to keep up with WOW who could bomb done the steep trail and it was my mistake to try and eat a Cliff Bar under these conditions.  I kept trying to hike but it was very hard to scramble up boulders with one good hand.  I tried using my left trekking pole with my first 3 fingers, this helped to scale the boulder fields but it wasn't ideal.

The trails around the huts are maintained better than the regular AT trail in the White Mountains.  We stopped again at the Zealand Hut and scored some free Chicken Couscous from a former thru hiker who worked there.  My experience with the crew that work at the huts and the AMC campsites was extremely positive.The trail down to Crawford Notch was a dream  I was well graded dirt trail with planks for walking over the swampy areas.  We were going to get to the trailhead early so I used my Inreach to notify the GCHH team member.  We had planned to just get a resupply and then head up the climb that would take us to Mt Washington inn the late afternoon.  I checked AT Weather and discovered that the day we had scheduled for summiting Mt Washington was going to have 100 mph winds and sleet/ice.  Yikes I thought this was June.  So we started to plan for alternatives.  Our first plan was to continue our hike up and have the GCHH team member drive up to Mt Washington and pick us up so that we could escape the following days weather.  We were going with this option but the ex-Navy Diving Officer in me wanted to make sure that all of the checks were completed on my predive check list.  Its a good thing that I checked because the road was going to be closed to all vehicles except motorcycles on the day we were supposed to be picked up.  We might have been able to shelter from the storm in either the Lakes of the Cloud or the Madison Hut but that wasn't guaranteed.  We decided to wait out the weather at our favorite motel in Lincoln.,"Garfield Ridge Campsite

Silver Streak ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616032,"I fractured my finger coming down Moosilauke 5 days ago. WOW recommended that I get an X-ray when it happened. But I wanted to keep hiking. It was rough trying to scramble up boulders with only one hand but I made it work for 3 more days. Today we had to take the day off due to crazy weather conditions coming to Mt Washington tonight. I took the town time to go to the doctor. As you can see in the X-ray I have a fracture just above my pinky finger’s knuckle. WOW and I agree that it would be impossible to finish the upcoming section of the White Mountains without 2 good hands. I can still hike normal trails and anticipate section hiking part of the PCT with my wife in late June. This is dependent on what my Sports Medicine doctor advises. I will miss WOW he was a great hiking companion and gave me invaluable Words Of Wisdom (WOW) Happy trails 


Happy hiking,

My last post included a picture of the X-ray that I had taken in Lincoln, New Hampshire. That X-ray showed a nice clean fracture just above a joint.  WOW noticed multiple fracture lines above this. He said that they would probably have to pin it or put plates in. I should have listened to WOW when he told me to get an X-ray. I thought that I had just jammed it again and that it would gradually feel better. I was also motivated to get through the White mountains while we had a fairly good weather forecast. Of course the mountains make their own weather and conditions can change rapidly. 
Just as WOW predicted, the orthopedic doctor diagnosed me with what turned out to be multiple fractures in the bone. There were two options to repair the damage. The preferred procedure was for the doctor to use X-ray to manipulate the fragments back in place. He was skeptical that this would be possible because it had been 11 days since the fracture occurred. This was the best option because the recovery time would be much shorter. The other option was to surgically open the finger and move the bones around. 
The first question that I asked the doctor was how long would it be before I could get back on the trail. I told him of my plans to hike the Oregon section of the PCT with Nancy (wife) for the AARP:Triple Crown project in July. I also told him that I needed to go back and finish the AT in August after Nancy goes back to work (5th grade teacher). 
I guess that my enthusiasm was apparent because he went way beyond what a normal doctor would do.  I went into the operating room on 18 June hoping that pining was going to work. After I woke up from the anesthesia, the doctor came in and showed me X-rays of my finger with three pins. I was so happy. As far as I’m concerned he is a miracle worker. 
Every night I dream of getting back to the White mountains to finish my adventure. 
I often think back to the extreme conditions that I encountered and learned how to overcome. The beauty of the trail, the smells and sounds of the birds and rushing water are still fresh in my memory. As I’m fond of saying: “This to shall pass”  puts all of the difficult times in perspective and invokes a sense of pride in my perseverance. 
I’m doing some research to find shoes that will provide stability and stick to wet granite. My Lone Peaks worked fairly well but the sole (not just the toe bumper) of the right shoe was coming unglued from the midsole. My Salomon XA pro 3D shoes worked great on the rocky dry trails of Pennsylvania but were worthless on wet granite and mud pits. The insoles would bunch up when wet and would cause foot pain. I ended up throwing the insoles away. I also slipped on slick rock slabs five times during a steep descent. 
I’ve made no secret of my dislike for ridiculously dangerous (my opinion)  trail conditions but I always kept hiking because like it or not steep, slick rock slabs are part of the AT experience. I started this hike because I want to be a thru hiker and hopefully my broken finger is just a hiccup in my adventure. As the song says:
I get knocked down, but I get up again
You are never gonna keep me down
I get knocked down, but I get up again
You are never gonna keep me down

You could easily change the 
“I get knocked down” to “I fall down”. My 9 year old grandson told me that I should change my trail name to Fall.
If all goes to plan you will see a journal entry describing my climb up and over Mt Washington sometime in mid to late August. 
Thanks again for following my adventure

Silver Streak ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633334,"If not now, when?
I’m 67 and will turn 68 in July 2021.  I’m at the age where you are one bad fall away from having a broken hip. So I want to complete my AT thru hike before it’s too late. 
Why not wait until next year after the COVID pandemic will hopefully be controlled? My wife Nancy and I plan to thru hike the PCT in 2022 and if all goes well the CDT in 2023.  I’d like to get my triple crown at 70. 
I retired from teaching in 2018 and was ready to experience the adventure of completing a thru hike of a long trail in 2019.  I started the trail on 17 February 2019 and discovered that I am capable of surviving the rigors of hiking long days in snow, sleet and rain during the early months of my hike.  I got off the trail in Harpers Ferry and went home for about 2 weeks during spring break to get evaluated for a swollen leg that I thought might have been infected due to a deep wound I sustained from a bad fall I had at the end of the Shenandoahs.  Luckily, I didn’t have any fractures or infection and after some rest my leg returned to normal and I returned to Harpers Ferry to continue hiking.  
I completed 1846 AT miles but had to leave the trail due to severe fractures of my left pinky finger due to a fall I sustained while descending Mt Moosilauke. The fall was my fault because I was trying to unwrap a Cliff Bar instead of paying attention to the steep technical downhill.
I was thinking about finishing the trail last year but the COVID-19 pandemic put an end to that. 
I was planning to start the AT this year on 7 March but changed my mind after a shakedown hike I did on the Foothills Trail (South Carolina) at the end of January 2021. I completed a 154.6 mile YoYo of the 72.3 mile Foothills Trail in 7 days.  It was a cold hike with nightly temperatures in the low 20s which was great for testing out my cold weather gear. It rained one night which got me thinking about how tempting shelters would be during those multiple day AT  rain spells.  Being unvaccinated at the time I didn’t think it would be a great idea for a 67 year old hiker to spend the night crammed into a shelter with strangers during the COVID pandemic.  So I got home and cancelled my AT registration and Amicalola Lodge reservations.
Then within a week I was able to schedule my first Moderna vaccination at CVS.  This seemed like a good omen and my mind returned to thinking about another AT hike.  It didn’t take long to decide to start my hike on 21 March which would be almost 2 weeks after I got my 2nd Moderna shot.  
Today is 17 March and I am almost done with my pre hike preparations.  I am mailing the 2nd of my 19 resupplying boxes today.  I will post a summary of my resupply strategy soon.
