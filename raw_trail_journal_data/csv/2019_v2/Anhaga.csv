Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607567,"I have been thinking of this trip for a long time.   I retired in May 2018 and have desired to get out on a long hike for many years.  I first walked the AT in 1975 in the Whites up Little Haystack to Mt. Lincoln on a three day hike. A friend and I had taken a week off to travel up to New England. We decided we would backpack in the Whites. I didn't know anything about the AT at that time but discovered on that trip how much I loved being in the woods, walking along the streams and sitting on a +4000' peak admiring the awe inspiring beauty that extended seemingly forever.  We loved this area so much that my friend and I went back the next year and celebrated the Bicentennial July 4th on top of Mt. Lincoln again...this time by settling off 1 firecracker.  I enjoyed that much more than what was occurring in my home area of Phila. at that time with all the commercialization of our history.
In the years since I have done some backpacking the Whites, the Adirondacks, the Wilds of PA and the Cascades. But I have always wanted to do an extended hike of the AT.   
I am planning on taking 8 weeks this spring and hike from Agony Grind in Harriman State Park south to near Roanoke, VA or as close as I can get. Then I will spend the summer at home and in September continue south to Springer. I hope to finish by early November.  If this year goes as hoped then I will finish my AT sojourn to Katahdin by starting north at Harriman in late May/early June 2020 and finish in late summer.",,View Entry,"Mar 04, Mon",0
Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607657,High of 25 degrees today. The trails by me are ice covered so I am taking the day off from walking outside and I am spending time arranging gear and clothes.  Starting to be both nervous and excited.  I believe that is pretty normal.,,View Entry,"Mar 06, Wed",0
Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609538,"Got my final practice hike in today. The Tom Lowe trail is located on a side of a ridge in state game lands. The AT run along the ridge above the trail.  I had hiked this section of the AT last year on a two night hike. Definitely gets me ready for the rocks on the Pennsylvania trail. The trail ran along a stream bed for over a mile and I was hopping from stone to rock to root for most of it. It was a warm early spring day. Walked with a long sleeve undershirt and a 1/4 zip top. Worked up a sweat even though the temps didn't exceed 60. There were some yellow flowers in bloom and the trees are just starting to bud. Water in the streams were running low for this time of year. We did not get much snow and unlike last year the rains have not been a daily experience. 
I am getting on the trail on Saturday the 6th. Starting at Route 17 near Arden,NY. First climb will be Agony Grind. So I will start will a good challenge. This will be a shake down hike since I will not be able to do more than a week or so at this time. My mother-in-law is in failing health and it is important to be near home for the near future. Right now she seems well enough to get in a 4 or 7 day hike. One of the advantages of starting in NY and working my way south is that for the next 150 miles, I will be within less than a two hour drive from home. 
My older son is joining me for the first 4 days and I am so excited about that. We had hiked in World's End state park a few years ago and had a great time. Looking forward to sharing this experience with him. Later on the hike I will meet up with my younger son so that will be a treat also.",,pre-trip hike,"Apr 03, Wed",0
Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609540,"I spent the last few days packing and unpacking my gear. Weighed it and weighed it again. Removed items, added items and fretted over the weight.  I ended up with about 25lb base weight.  Loaded with food and water, the pack comes in around 35lb. I'm not sure how folks get the weight down to 20lb.  Well, the advantage of the shake down hike is to see what is really necessary and what can be jettisoned. By the end of next week, I may have a  better able to know what I need and also what I am capable of carrying.  I really want to approach this from the correct direction in the hopes of having a better chance of having a good hiking experience.  I almost said to have a successful hike but I'm not even sure what I mean by a successful hike yet. I think the trail will tell me that. 
Excited to be taking the first few steps soon.",,View Entry,"Apr 04, Thu",0
Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609774,Excited to be on the trail...even for a few days. Dropped the truck at High Point State Park in NJ and hopped a ride with my brother in law Neil to Rt 17 in Arden NY where Liam and I's first experience of the trail was the 450' rise in a half mile called Agony Grind.What an introduction to the AT. Took several breaks to Crest that scramble. The weather was perfect. Mid 50s to low 60s under a blue sky. Good omen. Made slow progress as I realized how not on AT shape I am in. So glad Lee was there to encourage me. Had some decent views. Passed a pond where a Great Blue Heron rose in front of us. Crossed a stream and made it to Fitzgerald Falls. By that time we had come 8.1 miles but it was 6 PM and we had a 500' rise in a short distance. We toyed with setting up camp at the base of the falls but fi ally decided to make a go the hill to shelter. So happy we did. As we hiked out to cross the road a group of young folks were coming in with boom box to hang out at the falls. The falls are close to the road and locals use it as a hangout. When we were near to top of the mountain about a mile from the falls we could still here the music. Made the final push to Wildcat and got here just before dusk. Good site but there are a lot of people...to be expected for Saturday night. Didn't know if we would get here tonight but so happy we did. Stiff but feeling pretty good. I'll try to upload pics later as I am still trying to figure this journal out.,"Rt 17 at Arden Ny

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609849,"Good night sleeping in the tent last night at wildcat. Broke camp and we were on the trail by 8.  Much easier day than yesterday. We walked a lot of ridges today with several vistas of Greenwood lake. Crossed the NY/NJ border at mile 8. Took more breaks today and focused more on hydration. Made the shelter by 5pm. That was nice since we were able to set up on daylight cook a hot meal and even charge our phones at the park office. Life is indeed good.  Saw a black snake near a pond that was just curled up enjoying the day. That was the only wildlife we saw. Heard a lot of frogs near some bogs 
Hunkered down for the night. Hope to be able to get photos up soon.","

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609961,"Spent last night in Wawayanda Sheler with one other section hiker, John, a young vet who was hiking from Arden into PA. Good chatting and spending some time with him. He was planning on 18 miles today so we won't see him again. Had a good hike today. Glad to be going south because we came down some really steep boulder strewn drops. I wouldn't want to going up them at all. Had a couple good vistas but most of the time was spent walking through woods except we did a long board walk over a big that was pretty cool. I'm sure in the summer that big would be full of birds and wildlife. Stopped for lunch at the base of the Stairway to heaven at a road side hot dog stand. Met Mitch the owner who has been running this stand for 6 yrs. What a person. So glad we got to spend an hour with him. He was also a vet who had knocked around for many years. Told great stories and stale jokes. Perfect way to spend lunch. Later we met a NOBO who was putting in 25 mile's today. He section hiked VA last year and started from Springer on Jan 31. Hiked to VA and skipped up to Harper's Ferry. Trail name is Badass. It fits well.Got to the shelter near 5 and settled down. Had a good meal and kicking back. Will probably try to hike to the truck tomorrow however I did pick up two unwanted friends...a blister on my big toe and one on the bottom of my foot. Hopefully some moleskin will do the trick til we get to the truck.","Wawayanda shelter

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610275,"We had a good night at Pochuck Shelter. Beautiful sunset.  No one else at the shelter. Got an early start since we wanted to make the truck at 14.7 miles. My mother in law is in hospice and I decided that I should get home for awhile and help out.  Walked by a bird sanctuary as the sun was burning off the morning fog. Eerie lighting on the trees and rushes. Saw deer Canadian geese, a beaver and many types of songbirds. What a great start to the day. May good distance and time in the morning. Reached Highpoint Shelter by two PM  and kept going. Took in the view from the observation tower and finished up by hiking out the final mile to the truck. Off the trail for an undetermined amount of time. It has been such a special time hiking with Liam.","Pochuck mountain shelter

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614139,"Finally back out on the trail. It took a while but glad to be walking again. Kudos to Pop Ford and Brendan for driving me from home to the trail head. Really appreciated the ride. Beautiful weather today. Sun, no humidity and a soft breeze. Made good time once I got up to the ridge. Passed a mountain laurel that was in bloom. Saw a lot of others with just the buds. Passed thru several fields of ferns that glimmered in the sun. 
Hoping to get two weeks in this time and maybe make Harpers Ferry if all goes well.","Port Clinton PA
",Eagles Nest Shelter,"May 21, Tue",8.30
Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614522,"I looked at the weather forecast and spoke to Ei. There looks like a big storm is due on Thursday evening so I decided to make this a longer day so I could make it to a shelter on Thursday rather than a tent site as originally planned. So broke camp early and headed out. Beautiful day and trail wasn't too bad to start. Made some pretty good time but eventually the tail let's you know you have work to do. About 3 miles before Hertlien campsite the trail turned wet and muddy. You had a choice between ankle deep mud or angle deep water. I chose both since there was no choosing neither or either. That only lasted about a mile and a half so not bad. Had some great stretches through fern fields and wildflowers but then the PA rocks showed up. Rocks stones boulders pebbles gravel in all shapes sizes and sharpnesses. Round rocks square rocks rhomboid rocks tetrahedron rocks dodecahedron rocks and all of them had one thing in common: they all lay with a corner or edge up. Except of course the ones that laid flat that I confidently stepped on only to find myself on a teeter totter.  As a child my parents had a house two blocks from the beach and i was positive the sharp edged pebble i stepped on leaving the house would transport itself under my foot for the entire walk. Rocks are cantankerous that way.
Made to the shelter late in the day and met some cool Nobos. One seems to be a bit of a trail legend. Sir Stops a Lot. He had some great stories. He even worked in a ship yard and was familiar with BE boilers. My father worked at Boiler Engineering during WWII making boilers for the Liberty ships. Neat coincidence.","Eagles Nest Shelter
",William Penn Shelter,"May 22, Wed",19.20
Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614595,Met Jack at the William Penn shelter. He was also headed southbound and just came on the trail at rt.183. He was a recently retired union carpenter who lived right next to a trail I use in French Creek. He decided to come out for a couple weeks on the AT. Ended up walking a good portion of the day with him. It was different have a conversation while on the trail. Trail was rather easy that day except for one steep hill however we did have a curve thrown at us by a beaver. The varmint had built his dam and flooded the trail. We had to detour around it. Arrived at Rausch ahead of the supposed nasty storms which never materialized. Stayed in the shelter with two Nobos. Several guys set up hammocks. One of them built a fire. Nice. These 3 guys have been doing the trail over 3 days weekends for the last couple of years. Saw a black rat snake today.,"William Penn Shelter
",Rausch Shelter,"May 23, Thu",13.40
Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614600,Turns out there were some heavy thunderstorms during the middle of the night. No hail but heavy rain. Stayed dry in the shelter but I don't sleep well in them with other occupants mooching about. So I got up early and I also wanted to get either 13 or 18 miles in so I would be in good position to get to Duncannon for resupply. I left Jack sleeping in his tent. I'm sure he will have a great hike.I was not able to talk to Eileen last night. There was no service and I found out later that the garmin satellite did not go through after I went into the valley before Rausch. Family was a little worried but I didn't know. Still didn't have service in the morning. Ft Indiantown Gap was over the next ridge. Hmmm? Wonder what they're jamming. The storm had washed the sky and the air was clear and crisp. From a cool fire ring on top of Stony Mountain (it had chairs made of stone slabs) I was able to reach Eileen and hear about the family's concern. Made good time and pushed to Peter's shelter by 5. Long day but worth it. Tomorrow into Duncannon to stay at Doyle's.,"Rausch Shelter
",Peter's mountain shelter ,"May 24, Fri",18
Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614928,Got a good start out of Peter's. Stopped by the Clark's shelter to filter some water and headed into Duncannon. Tje last mile and a half before the downslope turned out to be nothing by rock scramble and scree. Constant up and down over the jumbles. Finally made Duncannon around 1 and went to Doyle's. What a place. Once in the 1880s it was probably a great palace of a hotel when Lightning Guider sleds were being manufactured there. Now for $25 Vicki will rent a hiker a room for the night. One bulb in the center of the ceiling with an extension hanging down for the rest of your power. Common hall bath and shower. I didn't pull down the sheets to check the quality of the mattress but really what does one want for $25.00. They made a great burger and fries and satisfied my needs for the day. Had a couple cold lagers; got my wash done and resupplied. Worked out quite well. Even got a salad at the Pub. All and all a good day,"Peter's mountain shelter 
",Duncannon,"May 25, Sat",10.90
Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616045,"I arose early and grabbed two eggs, scrapple, home fries, toast and decaf at Goodies' before heading out. As I was passing the VFW there was an elderly gentleman standing in front of the building. As this was the Sunday before Memorial Day, I thought to thank him for his service but he was not a veteran... turns out he was a hiker that had thru hiked the trail in 1973 with his family.  I am sorry I didn't get his name but he told me of how he and his wife and ten yr old daughter hiked the trail. They were the first family to thru hike. H told how his daughter had resisted being on the trail until the young college age hikers started to tell her how good she was and to embrace the fact that she was probably the youngest female thru hiker to date. She relished that fact and completed the journey. How remarkable is that!
Made a steep climb out of the Susquehanna Valley up to Hawk Rocks. Lots of stone steps to negotiate but the view was very good. The rest of the hike that day was good. I spent most of the time on a ridge with more soil under my feet that rocks which had been unusual earlier in the week. The weather was good. Not as much humidity and I made the shelter in mid afternoon. I passed Abernacky - a NOBO about my age and passed a few minutes with him. I love going southbound and meeting all these folks. He got his name from an ancestor who lived in Western Quebec.
Set up the tent at the shelter site and as I was prepping dinner in came Pharaoh. He is a SOBO whom I met at Eagles Nest on my first night. He also stayed at Duncannon last night but in a church basement. He was hiking with two other SOBOs:Buffy and her mother Blossom.  Chatted awhile and then did my Tai Chi.
It's been a very good day.","Duncannon
",Darlington Shelter,"May 26, Sun",11.40
Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616046,"Rose early as usual. Pretty hard sleeping late when I fall asleep by 9PM and the sun is poking in the tent by 5:30 and the birds are chirping a little before sunrise. Actually pretty nice waking up this way. No alarm. I keep my phone off since I am trying to conserve my battery.  A long hike today since I spent a lot of time and distance crossing the Cumberland Valley. Coming down the ridge from the shelter there was a great view of the valley. I could see clear across to the next ridge line which was my destination.  Beautiful morning with scattered clouds filtering the sun over the valley. Made good time walking the flat trail by a creek and over some pastures. Finally had a break from the constant rock strewn path. Made Boiling Springs by early afternoon. Since today is Memorial Day the ATC's office was closed as were some restaurants but I was able to charge my phone a little. I did want to grab some lunch and Caffe 101 was open. I found a seat outside on a far away corner of the patio since I knew I was a little ripe from walking the 14 miles to town. Ordered a chicken burrito and a beer and settled down to a great meal. Met Davingitup, a thru hiker who was taking a zero with his wife. They were eating at the Caffe. Once again an easy conversation with a older hiker. Hung around for a couple of hours and then made my way to the shelter. There were 4 NOBOs at the shelter when I arrived. JW, Cricket, Salamander and Raven. Later Just Bob arrived. Just Bob is a section hiker who has been working the trail for several years.  This was an interesting group. Raven was born in Dublin and emigrated to Ontario. He studied law in Ireland but teaches History in Ontario on the Bruce Penisula. Just Bob works in mental health with at risk children. I spent a decent amount of time with them and for once I wished I was headed north with them to spend more time talking with them. Enjoyed this evening a lot. Had a chance to soak my feet in the creek which services the shelter. Soooo good to let them dogs soak. The burrito carried me for the day and I didn't make dinner. Still full.","Darlington Shelter
",Alec Kennedy Shelter,"May 27, Mon",18.20
Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616105,"Slept in the upper bunk of the shelter and was a little later than usual getting my stuff together. The NOBOs said that I had some rocks to negotiate but then the trail became easier.  Had a little ascent to start my day. I try to call Eileen every morning around 8 to 8:30 depending on connectivity. Today I walked for about an hour and sat down in a blueberry patch. The berries are just starting. Still green and about the size of a pea.  Would like to be there in a couple weeks to enjoy them. 
So what does one think about while walking along. For me I keep a song in my head most times but that can be very frustrating. I think everyone gets a song stuck in their head once in a while but when you are walking by yourself for hours those three  lines from a Beatle's song and not remembering the fourth line or getting it mixed up with Crash Teat Dummies lines like Me Tarzan You Jane can get pretty old pretty fast.  I am surprised by how many people walk with headphones on. It seems that a lot of them a  listening to podcasts. I never got into podcasts so I not sure if I would like it. I mean I am out here to experience nature and it smells, sounds, sights and beauty. Is something lost by headphones....or is there really any difference between headphones and half recalled lyrics?  Besides I am having enough trouble keeping the phone charged as it is.  I constantly shut it off and only turn it on when I want to check Gutthooks or take a pic or call Ei but it uses so much energy to come on. I need to work on figuring out how best to keep things charged.
Well the NOBOs were right. After the berry patch I came into some steep rock scrambles that went on for what seemed like a couple of miles. Probably in reality it was less than a mile but this constant picking and pecking with your feet is tiring and the day is heating up and the humidity has been building.   Coming down into Pine Grove there is a side path to Pole Steeple, a rocky outcrop with a view. Some locals can access it by a side trail. A young woman was there with some friends and she recently had seen a timber rattler on the rocks. She looked on a rock shelf below where I was standing and found him soaking up the sun. I took a quick peek and then moved my feet.
Got the Pine Grove around 5 pm and searched out the ranger station. Turned out that they keep banker's hours. 8 to 4. This was after Memorial Day and I thought they would be open later.  Started looking for the camping area and found Spaghetti Monkey Arms, a thru hiker who was taking a NERO. He guided me to the campsite. This is an  honor system but I could not find the Camp host in the first couple of loops. I'll try to find a ranger in the morning since I have no pen or any change to pay for the site. 
Spoke to Ei and she advised there are heavy storms on my area tonight with possible hail and tornadoes. I picked a spot neat the bathrooms in case I need to run in there for protection since I will be in my tent tonight. The bathrooms are concrete block.  I am able to plug my phone and extra battery in the bathroom so that helps. 
Settling down waiting for the storms.","Alec Kennedy Shelter
",Pine Grove Furnace State Park,"May 28, Tue",15.30
Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616106,"Well the storms did come in last night but not too bad. I could hear the thunder in the distance but it never came closer that a couple of miles. There was some heavy rains but the tent kept me dry. Thankful for that.What did happen in the middle of the night got my attention but good.  I said that I set up my tent near the bathroom in case I needed to get out of the storms but what I did not account for was a dumpster between my tent and the bathroom. The dumpster was about 40' from my tent. I woke about 2:40am to a loud bang. I realized very quickly that a bear was getting into the dumpster. He was making a lot of noise and was snarfing up the garbage. I really didn't know how to handle this.  Most likely a black bear who I might be able to frighten off however I'm thinking that I am basically in her kitchen at dinner time and I was not in a hurry to ask him to leave his table.  I lay quietly and slowly opened my tent zipper and reached into my backpack for the bear spray. That was my only protection.  He rooted in the dumpster for about 45 minutes and finally made his way past me tent and into the woods.  Definitely had my adrenaline going while he was wondering around the tent. When I got up I could see the scattered debris.  I have to question the park management on putting an ordinary dumpster in a tent area. This was not a bear proof dumpster but one with a plastic lid. I have been in many PA parks where the dumpsters are bear proof and are not placed in an area where the campers stay. In Promised End you need to drive your trash to the entrance to the campsites to get rid of your trash. Fairly irresponsible on the park's part.Needless to say, I left that site very early, by 5:30am and made my way south. I had a really nice hike out of the park and came across another black rat snake. Seems like I see a rat snake on a daily basis.  Crossed the 2018 AT midpoint today. Met a Swedish hiker and asked her about being more than halfway. She seemed a little disappointed with how far she still had to go. I guess there are a lot of ways to look at it. I told her now that every step she took she had more trail behind her than in front of her but I'm sure the psychological aspects of being on the trails for months and knowing you are only half way can weigh on folks. Had some great walking today through pine forests for a couple of miles. The trail is soft with pine straw. Such a change from the rocks earlier. Arrived at Quarry Gap around 4:00pm. The shelter was already pretty full since there were still very heavy storms forecast for late afternoon. Quarry Gap is a beautiful set up. There are two shelters w/ a common covered dining area in between. There is a separate covered table, a 3 person swing, flowers and a sundial. The water is in a small stone encased stream in front of the shelter. Just a perfect set up.The storms did arrive around 5. Torrential rains that lasted about an hour. toward the end of the rain two NOBOs arrived drenched completely but laughing. This is a fate of the thru hiker. You will never avoid all the rains.Weather cleared out and I was again able to do my Tai Chi. This is such a pleasure to be able to unwind from a long days walk.","Pine Grove Furnace State Park

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616653,"Arose early as usual but not one of the first from camp. Several thru hikers were up and on the trail by 6:30am.  Day dawned humid and cloudy.  Made my way down the trail into Caledonia State Park.  Stopped for over an hour to power up my phone and battery.  Planning on a shorter day today, only a little over 12 miles so I have some time. Crossed Rt 30 and went back up hill. While the rocks are still present there are not as intrusive as before Duncannon and that section after the Alec Kennedy Shelter. There were storms in the area and by early afternoon, my luck at ducking the rains had ended.  Rain started as a drizzle and steadily increased until it was a true drenching rain. I was walking a long ridge and started to become concerned about lightning. I did not want to get caught up high in a thunder storm.  Luckily the thunder stayed away. Only rumbles in the distance but the really heavy rains lasted about an hour. I was soaked through but not cold. The rains felt good since earlier in the day I had been sweating  and sweating and sweating, with the high humidity and warm temps.My thoughts turned to Beckett and how he might write about the hiking in the rain.  Stride, stride again. Stride left, the foot strides. Rock bent, sharp, sharply bent. Stride through the mud, the wet fart sounding bweert, left bweert, mud sucking boot clinging bweert. stride off foot bweert. Go on, go further. Right stride, soft - the mud clings. Tap, tap, tap... the metal tip to rock, stride, poles slide with sweat. Stride bweert, bweert, stride. Shall we go on, I can't go on, I go on.  The rain ran as river down the steep incline to the shelter, keeping my feet in a stream. Finally letting up about a mile from Tumbling Run. Tumbling Run seems to be in competition with Quarry Gap. It is a cool shelter with two huts. one labelled snoring and one non-snoring.  There are ceramic faces in the trees and a lot of open space. A sign said water was coming from a pipe spring down a trail.  You crossed two small and a larger stream to get to the water. I only made to distant journey once. After that I got water from the nearest stream.There was only 1 other person at the shelter when I arrived. Papa Smurf. It has set up a tent. He had fallen and gashed he knee pretty badly but he figured he would hike out to Rt 30 tomorrow and get some medical attention. Clouds cleared a little and I again was able to relax with Tai Chi as unknown bird song flitted through the trees.","Quarry Gap Shelter

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616656,"Right before I went to sleep last night two thru hikers arrived in camp. Both had walked 27.2 miles.  They told me that they went into Rouzerville to resupply and said it was easy to get into town.  They got rides very easily. I was a little low on supply and thought if it wasn't too much of a hassle, I might try to get into town. I had an easy 8.2 mile walk to PenMar Road and arrived around 11:00.  I don't think I have hitchhiked since the early 70's when I hiked to Boston to see some friends. I thought I would give it a try. Started walking down a very long hill toward town and was hoping for a ride since I did not look forward to walking the 2 miles back up hill. An old pickup with tow old bearded guys passed my by.  The next car was a Lexus or BMW SUV and I didn't bother putting my thumb out for that one. Pretty much figured that would not be picking up a smelly, dirty, old hiker in their new vehicle. However, the 3rd car down did stop. The guy asked for ID which I thought was a good idea. He told me to hop in when he saw I was from PA. Turns out he is a federal agent and works in the area. I am now almost in MD and near Camp David.  He is a USAA member and we talked a little about the company. Really nice guy who offered to wait while I went into Walmart to get some stuff but since I wanted to plug in my phone, I declined. 
I hate Walmart  but it hit the spot today. They had a Subway and I brought a foot long roast beef sub. Ate it outside but couldn't really get a spot to plug in. I decided to head on back to the trail. I had barely put my pack back on and started walking when I guy pulled over and asked it I wanted a ride back to the trail. Unbelievable. These folks are so kind and giving. He took me right back to the spot I came out on.  
Got back on the trail and within a tenth of a mile, I hit the Mason Dixon Line.  Out of PA. Thought a little bit about Pynchon and how I never did finish Mason-Dixon. Need to get back to that one someday. It's a cool feeling passing a state line. 
Just  a short distance later I came to Pen Mar Park.  A beautiful park that sits on a hilltop.  Finally after several days of no vistas, there is a great view across a wide valley looking west.  This place did have power. A maintenance man was kind enough to show me an outlet on the side of a building. I spent a couple hours here admiring the view and reading V. Pynchon's first novel.  I had another view later on at High Rock before making it to Raven Rock Shelter. 
Another very nice shelter but very full. This is Friday and there are a lot of folks on the trail so I pick out a nice tent site and settle in.  A trail runner is at this site. This is the first trail runner I have met. Trail runners work for the ATC and take care of the shelters during the summer. Nice kid in his 20s. He is thinking of going to WCU in the fall. I wished him good luck and told him I was an alumnae.
Again able to stretch out and unwind with my Tai Chi. Great night so far.","Tumbling Run Shelter

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616661,"Today was my shortest day of the trip since the hike into Eagles Nest. Only 11.5 miles. Great weather today. Sunny and not much humidity. Took my time. The trail got rocky again in parts and it slowed me down considerably.  Hit over a mile of completely rock strewn path.  Walked mostly along a ridge today. Excited about tomorrow. Meeting Ian and Jackie in the morning and then we hike together for several miles. I will be slack packing - taking only my day pack - which will be pretty nice. It will be good to lose the 35 lb of the full pack for a few hours. Made Annapolis Rocks mid afternoon - This site is beautiful. There is an outcropping that towers over the valley to the west.  The views are spectacular. I met a couple who were willing to take my pic overlooking the valley. Set up my tent in a nice area and just relaxed today. Near sundown, I walked back down to the overlook, found a nice place to sit and rest my back and read some more V.  Being able to rest one's back is a luxury since most of the time if you are in a tent you are sitting on a stump or the ground and if you are in a shelter you are sitting at a picnic table bench. Don't often get to lean my back again a solid surface. Took in the sunset but a lot of clouds had moved in and the sunset was rather gray.I have a short hike out tomorrow to meet Ian and Jackie.No room for Tai Chi tonight.","Raven Rock Shelter

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616682,"Got and early start to met with Ian and Jackie.  Made it to Rt 70 parking lot by 9:15. My phone had died again. I need to resolve whether it is better to keep it on all day on airplane mode or to keep turning it off and on. It uses so much battery turning it on.  Sent Ian a message via Garmin Inreach. He replied that should be there by 9:45.
It was great to see Ian and Jackie. They brought along their new dog Joey. Jackie and Joey would not be hiking with us. Jackie drove us south about 8 miles and we got on the trail at Tower Rd.  We walked north - this was the first time I had walked north since starting this venture.  Cloudy day and humid.  Trail did not have a lot of views but we crossed several historic sites relating the the Battle of Antietam. Spent some time checking out the plaques. We had lunch at the Washington Monument but  we weren't able to go inside. It is surrounded by scaffolding. Ian brought Wawa hoagies...so nice to have a good taste of home.  We talked a lot on the walk. Good to catch up with him. We made very good time back to his car. The weather forecast was for heavy storms in the mid afternoon so Ian was willing to go get a brew at a micro brewery in Hagerstown.  Had an ale and an IPA and made our way back to Tower Rd.  It was raining when we got the the trail head so I hung out in the car for a few minutes.When the rain slowed to a drizzle, I bid my farewell to Ian until tomorrow when he picks me up at Harper's Ferry. The rest of the hike today was good. Got one vista at White Rocks Cliff and made the shelter by 6.Only one older guy at the shelter. The Shelter is small and seemingly isolated but it you look carefully you can see some farmer's fields through the trees to the east. I am staying in the shelter tonight. Last night of the trip. Tomorrow I end this section in Harper's Ferry.","Annapolis Rocks

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616691,"Last day. Going to miss the trail. I have been thinking of how to continue. There is a big gap between Port Clinton PA and High Point State Park, NJ.  About 120 miles.  I think I might try to get that done this summer in a series of long weekends. If I can get that finished and then start again in late August from Harper's Ferry south there is an outside chance that I can make Springer Mt. by early November. I think this is doable since I was able to get some big miles in on this trip. If I can make it happen then I can start in the early summer next year at Harrison and walk north to Katadhin.
 I passed by the War Correspondent's Memorial in the morning. This brought back memories from many many years ago. In 1974 I had visited Mary Gallagher when she and Rose were living in Boonesboro. We had spent an afternoon hiking in this area and I snapped some photos of the memorial.  While I was eating some breakfast, there was an older NOBO woman who was taking it easy. She said she wanted to check out the museum when it opened. She told me she wasn't in a hurry. Some days you need to stop and check out the sites. I didn't get her trail name and now I wish I had since she told me this was the final half of the triple crown for her. She had already completed the PCT and the CDT! 
I had an easy walk from the shelter to Weverton Cliffs. This is an awesome overlook above the Potomac just east of Harper's Ferry. Made my way down off the cliffs to the C&O canal trail - a paved trail from DC west towards Pittsburgh.  This was another memory boost since I had biked this section of the trail in 1975 when I had attempted to bike across the US.  
Crossed the Potomac into Harper's Ferry. I was disappointed there is no marker where the states meet.  Hiked to the ATC office and got my picture taken for their yearbook.  
Had a burger and a beer at a local establishment and waited for Ian.
Off the trail now for a little while.","Crampton Gap Shelter

Up early to a beautiful blue day with temps in the 60s. We dropped off one car at Snickers Gap then Ian drove us to Harper's Ferry. Thank you Ian for taking a big part of you day to get me out again. Love you. Took a quick shot at the ATC office and we were on the trail by 9:30. It is so nice to hike with someone. Kelsey and John are friends of Ian's from high school but over the years they have become Ei's and my friends also. Had a pretty good ascent to start but easier than I thought it would be. Made exceptional time and got to David Loesser shelter by 2:30. Too early to stop so we went another 3 miles to Blackburn Trail Center.  Had a really good view looking west before we went down the hill to the center. And so happy we did. This cabin and center is owned by the Potomac AT club. It is an outstanding setting. The view is east through a cut in the forest. The building is a log cabin with a wrap around porch and Aidirondack chairs with cushions. While we were setting up, Wit, the ridge runner came and greeted us. He then offered to make us spaghetti for dinner. WOW! We were thinking of freezed dried food and now we are eating spaghetti and sauce on real plates with real flatwear while sitting in an enclosed porch. What a day. What a start. This will be hard to beat going forward. 
But another 11 miles tomorrow.","Harper's Ferry

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621811,"We had a great time at Blackburn but bid farewell to it by 7:30am. We soon encountered the Roller Coaster. This is a 13 to 14 mile section of the trail that has about 10 ups and downs. While the elevation changes are not too great the steepness and the rapidity in which they occur are very taxing. John, Kelsey and I did 3 of them before lunch. That was the time when we reached their car at Snicker's Gap. My time with them has ended. It was a real pleasure and a lot of fun to hike with them. They made the up hills easier. Hopefully, I will be with them on Kathadin.
I packed up the rest of my supplies from their car and headed south. I had 4 more miles to go to get to Sam Moore Shelter.  Had a great view of the valley from Bears Den Rocks. 
Arrived at the shelter and set up my tent. A little later Ruthie showed up. She is section hiking but taking it slow, going from shelter to shelter. I probably won't see her again since I plan on 15 miles tomorrow. 
Checked email and heard from an old friend in Roanoke. We will have dinner together when I get off in that town.
Ate some Pad Thai, stretched and did my Tai Chi. All in all a good day except for losing my hiking companions. That was sad for a while.","Blackburn Trail Center

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621823,Out of the tent ready for the trail by 7:15. Ruthie was still asleep in the shelter.Big day today. I set 15 miles to the next shelter and I still had 6.5 miles of the roller coaster to navigate. Started uphill to Buzzard Hill but no view so kept moving. I did run up on several deer during the morning. One was just calmly eating and watching me. I was probably closer than 20 feet and he never moved. Took a pic since he was so accommodating.After a few more hills finally got out of the roller coasters around noon. It took almost 5 hours to do 6.5 miles. The terrain changed in the afternoon. The ascents were higher but much more gradual. Got up to the Paris View with only a couple breathers. It was a little cloudy today and the view was somewhat overcast but still a great place to relax awhile.  Called Mountain Cabbin hostel from Paris View and was told they were booked for Wednesday. I had planned on only doing 10 miles tomorrow and have an easy 5 on Wednesday but now I will do back to back 15s. We'll see how that goes.Arrived at Whiskey Hollow shelter and decided to stay in the shelter. Worked put fine since no on else showed up. Quiet evening. Too weary for Tai Chi but I did stretch.

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621824,"Well I wanted to get an early start and I did indeed get about a 1/4 mile from the shelter when I remembered my hat...so back down to the shelter and then back up to the trail. Finally on the trail by 7:15. The shelters are usually down a hill and in a gap to get near a water source which means that a hike starts the day by going up. Liam says ""mountains for breakfast"". Seems to be true. Today continued like yesterday afternoon The rises are steady but more gradual. I had three good size ascents today and I needed to take breathers but still easier than prior days. I look forward to getting better lung power and leg power.  Not much to see today. Got to a large meadow that had a bench that was perfect for lunch. Made very good time. Proud of myself that I got to hostel by 4 PM.  I was the only one booked when I called yesterday but when I arrived there were 5 others staying tonight. All are southbound. 3 long section hikers; 1 flip flopper and 1 SOBO. Looks like I may have some company for a couple days. I only met 1 person on the trail today and that was at Manassas Gap shelter while I was filtering water. He was hiking only a couple days northbound.Found out tonight from Scott who runs the hostel that there is a hurricane in the Atlantic. Something that bears watching.Looking forward to tomorrow since I will enter Shenandoah NP and I will notch 300 miles on the trail.","Whiskey Hollow Shelter

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621956,"Woke up with the group today at 6. Clingman, Fruit loops, Wiseman and myself upstairs and Caboose and Mojo downstairs in the cabbin. The cabbin dates from the 1860s and may have been slave quarters. This is part of Mountain Home BnB. Scott and Lisa run it and do a splendid job. For $31 you get a bed, shower and a hot breakfast in the main house. Can't beat that. The house is completely restored and they are applying to be placed on the National Register. Beautiful walnut trims set off the 10 foot high ceilings. Great food great ambiance and for me a pot of decaf. What a nice way to start my day.
On the trail by 7:30. Grey lowering clouds harboring rain. As usual started up a hill. Excited today since I'll be hiking in Shenandoah NP and I have now passed  300 miles on the AT. But first there was a mighty steep rock climb just before the park entrance. Took some sweat to negotiate to the top.
It is  beautiful in the park. The trail grade softened and opened up for a couple miles. The clouds lifted and it was partially sunny. For a while. By early afternoon the heavy clouds were back. And then the rain.
Rain like sheets of Coltrane's music. Roiling blowing hammering on leaves branches rock and moss. And I walked always going up. Rain is a great motivator to propel one forward. For about 2 1/2 hours while I summited Mount Marshall. Finally as I am coming down it slows and finally ceases.
A small trail to the right. A few steps and then why I came on this walk opened before me. I was standing on a rocky crag with the Shenandoah Valley at my feet. Mist like pipe smoke scuttled in the wind past me. Blue sky pushing the clouds past. Sun speckled fields and a lone plume of wood smoke below.
Wet and cold but entranced. I sat and stared and absorbed the day. After the trudging to be served this sight...how lucky am I.
And now in a shelter with a few good weather days ahead.","Mountain Home Hostel

Had to get up last night to take care of nature's needs and had a chance to see a patch of stars without all the light pollution at home. So beautiful. 
Stayed in the shelter last night. There were only 3 of us using it. Caboose and Wiseman set up tents. Shelters can be noisy with folks tossing and turning but I got a decent amount of sleep between dreams. One so vivid I had to wake myself to confirm I was dreaming. 
It is easier to break camp when there is no tent to stow. On the trail a little before 7.  Cloudless bue sky with a little wind and the sun just coming over my left shoulder. Within an hour the trail let to my first view from Hogback Mountain. Looking north west towards Front Royal I could trace yesterday's walk. Had breakfast with one of the most stunning views and called Eileen. 
The others caught up to me while I was there and I hiked the rest of the day with Clingman. Looks like i am starting to be part of a tramily but pretty early to know for sure.
We had lunch at the Elkwallow Wayside. Cheeseburger and fries. Quite a load of fries but I finished them along with a Baby Ruth. Love my chocolate rush. 
No views in the afternoon but a couple big ups. Made the hut around 5 and found 8 college students from Washington and Lee out for 4 days of orientation. Cool for them but no hut for us tonight. Set up tents and settled in for the evening.

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622071,"Arose early since I had over 15 miles today with a significant climb up to Mary's Rock. Over 1200 feet from Thornton Gap to the top.
But I started down for a change. Walked in splintered sunlight(thank you grateful dead) for  a mile or so before the climb. Strenuous but beautiful.  The trail hugged the edge of the rise  so I glimpsed the valley through the trees most of the way. The trail actually goes over stone walls that were installed to support to trail. The walls were built in the 1930s by members of the CCC. Thanks you to all those men who worked for the during the great depression. The view from Mary's Rock was so amazing. From looking into the valley at Luray to the far distance ranges. I spent an hour there eating some protein bars and talking to Eileen. Probably spent too long there since I still had 12 miles of rough travel to go.
Had lunch with Caboose and Wiseman at Pinnacle picnic area. Still had 8.6 miles to go. The afternoon wore on me a little with a series of ups and downs but there was still an outstanding vista at Little Stony Man cliffs. Took a few more pics. Finally reached Rock Springs Hut around 6. A very long day. Definitely beat. However this shelter area is lovely. It looks west over the valley and we had a sunset.

I say we because Clingman, Wiseman and Caboose have been camping in the same huts for 4 night now. We are starting to be comfortable. I still walk mostly by myself during the day but end up having lunch together will one or two of them. Wiseman and Caboose travel together. Clingman is a sole flip flopper who had serious feet issues in the spring and had to abandon the northern section. He is now headed to Springer Mt. In Georgia. I had a quiet breakfast view around 8:30. Sat by the edge of a cliff looking west. It will be a welcome change when we get a little more south and beyond looking at Luray.  Reached Big Meadows around 11am. This is probably the largest lodge, campgrounds and wayside restuarant in the park. Crowded today with Labor day vacationers. I felt a little out of place kinda like when we had to make a beer run during Bacchanal weekend. The world seems out of sorts when you ignore it for a few days.
All of us had lunch together along with Charlie who is just out for a couple days. This wayside has been remodeled and is so impersonal. The Elkwallow Wayside had real people making real burgers and fries. This place had touchscreens and limited choices and pricey. I paid 2.50 for an order of potato salad that fit in a condiment cup. As Wiseman said the owner of the food service company needed his 2nd home. The Shenandoah NP and the Applachian trail are about reconnecting with nature and our better selves not about touchscreens and weighed portions. Just the word Wayside implies a place where time is leisurely spent and you take a few moments to ask you neighbor how their days is going. Not touchscreens and impersonal formica. After lunch I was on my way ahead of the rest and spent to next hour and a half walking through beautiful forests. Plural because throughout the day I pass through different micro ecosystems. Pine grove to laurel grove to fern field. Different types of grey green and silver lichen. Passing by Carolina wrens singing to each other and later a goldfinch flitting from limb to limb in front of me. Then a couple more climbs. Not a lot of vistas today.
Frome Bearfence peak I was finally able to see more towards the south and a different part of the valley. Called Eileen and she was telling me a little of Clingmans journal and how he included things that he and Wiseman saw or did. One involving moving a snake off the trail.
I did not include those stories in my story because they are not my story. I am here to record what I see what I hear what I feel. I am really looking for my voice. And I hope the trees, rocks, streams, chipmunks, finches and wrens can help. Along with some talks with folks on the trail. There are more hikers tonight than back in May in PA. One is an ultralight hiker. He carries no tent and minimal equipment. He did 27 miles today. God bless him and his tired feet. I did 11.5, talked to folks, breathed in the trail and relaxed at dinner. I was able to do my Tai Chi tonight which really relaxes me. Another good day on the trail.","Rock Spring Hut

I going to take a Nero at his place. Shower laundry my clothes, sleep in a real bed and visit with him and Izzy, Thena and her family. It didn't work out quite a planned. Turns out there is a public campground just off Skyline Drive located about 500 feet above and a 1/4mile south of our shelter. It's Saturday Night Live! From Skyline Drive. We have young folks partying up a storm. Literally. They are making noise for about an hour when the storms come. I didn't see any lightning flashes but sure heard the thunder. It rained off and on all night. Woke by 6 and broke down the wet fly. Tent worked great and kept me dry. Morning was misty but no rain. There is a silence in the woods on a misty morning like a Washington Irving short story. The only sound is your foot softly padding and poles barely tapping on the trail. You quiet your breath and prick up your ears.  You  know there are magical folk just out of sight waiting for you to take a short nap and then...
Made the highway with time to spare. I met Clingman there. He had asked for a ride to a hotel for some R&R. Jim had said no problem.
He found a room in Ruckersville but he couldn't check in for a couple of hours so Jim treated us to lunch in the Blue Ridge Cafe.  We had a young waitress. Probably not a good career choice for her. Got Clingman's and my order right but messed up Jim's 3 times. 
Finally got to the house and had a good time catching up and watching the little ones play.

The world won't come to an end if all the workers rested for a day. Where are the wobblies when you need them. Nonetheless he had me up early and we grabbed Clingman and we're back on the trail by 7:30. Started with a 1200 foot climb to the top of Hightop Mountain. Elevation 3543. I had a couple good views to the west. Ate a protein bar for breakfast and went downhill for a couple miles. And then another climb. If you haven't noticed yet there is  a definite pattern to my day. Starts with an up then a down then an up etc. It actually can start to get boring not to mention redundant until I turn up a switchback and come to a cliff's edge and the world explodes into white clouds serrating blue sky above the rumpled green blanket below. How fortunate I am to be able to walk here.
I saw my first snake of this trip today. A black racer. Non vemonous...just the way I like my snakes. Think I got a good pic of him.
I walked part of the day with Clingman and part solo. I met up with him and walked together to the shelter. A little later Wiseman and Caboose arrived. They said it rained hard last night and they spent some time drying out their tents and sleeping bags. This is the earliest I set up camp since I started this hike. We made camp by 2:30. Also one of my fastest days. Almost 2mph. I think I getting my hiking legs just beginning to get but getting them . I was able to take my time and relax this evening. Did Tai Chi again.

Got a pretty early start. As I was walking up the access trail from the hut to the AT I met Larry the hut caretaker. He's about 5'10"" with a sloughed baseball cap, a walking stick and a Gandolf beard. Gandolf the White that is. I thanked him for his dedication to the trail and hut. ""Been doing it since 1986"" he said proudly.  Another person who has given much of his life so I can enjoy the piece of nature.
Other folks to thank. Starts with and ends with Ei. No way would I be here doing this now without her. Thanks to Jimmy, Thena, Jeff and Izzy for all the trouble they went through to give me a nice night. 
And a special thanks today to Mr. Bob Marley. ""Emancipate yourself from mental slavery
None but yourself can free your mind

I needed a song today to get me up two big morning elevations and Redemption Song worked wonderfully. What a powerful verse. It's up to each if us to break our own bonds. The things that hold us back sap our strength dessicate our desires. Man had a lot to say in a short song. 
Trail was pretty kind today. Once up we stayed near 3000 feet for most of the day. We had lunch together at Loft Mountain Camp Store. After lunch I walked with Clingman for awhile. I was about 20 yards behind him when I saw him stumble and fall. We were on flat ground but he said the ducked a little to avoid a bee and slipped on some loose gravel. He was able to land mostly on his pack so he wasn't injured but it a sharp reminder that quickly a peaceful stroll could become an issue.
Not too long after that I heard clicking on a rock. I came up to an Australian day hiker tapping his hiking stick against a boulder. I looked at him and he replied in his best Crocodile Dundee ""there, there in the tree"".  A black bear was scampering down a tree and heading downhill away from us. So I have now scene my first bear on the hike. The hiker thought it was a big one but it looked like a juvenile. About the size of a Great Pyrenees and smaller than a Newfoundland. I know since Izzy has owned both types of dogs so it gave me a reference point.
Reached to top of BlackRock mountain. Oh my God what a view. Did a bit of a rock scramble to the peak for an almost 360 view of the Shenandoah. Laid on a rock under the warm sun and soaked in the scene. Quiet night in the tent.","Pinefield Hut

I didn't hear anything but Wiseman said when he got up around 2:30 to take a pee he saw a bear near his tent. Wiseman marked his territory and bade the bear goodnight. 
I checked out Guthooks which is the thru hiker's preferred app. Extremely useful with mileage elevation and important waypoints including vistas. It's a don't leave home without it app. No views until mile 10 so I thought I would try to up my pace this morning. There were mostly PUDS in front of me. Pointless ups and downs. 
So no views but the trail always provides something to kick up the heart. I was happily  wandering at a good pace expectin a quiet stroll when my eye caught ahead on the trail. A 2 foot copperhead slowly slithering up the trail towards me. His markings were unmistakable.
I picked up a few stones and tossed them his way but that didn't deter him. He kept coming my way. I rearmed with some more stones and this time hit him near the head. That got his attention. He paused a moment and then scurried into the woods. I waited until he was well clear before I moved on.
Well I thought I had my excitement for the day until a half hour later I suddenly jumped back when I saw a timber rattler in the middle of the trail. He looked to be twice a big as the copperhead. Shit what's going on here? Then I realized he wasn't moving. Looking closely at him it turned out to be a case of wrong place wrong time for this snake. His head was crushed by a dead limb that had fallen from a tree on the trail. Just sliding along minding his own business and whack...indiscriminate death from above. I still gave him a wide berth. When I saw Wiseman later today he showed me the rattler which he cut off. Looks like the snake was probably 13yrs old. 
Not much in the way of vistas today but a very exciting day nonetheless. To top it off there was a mile long detour of the trail today.

When we reached the peak we filled quietly passed the cairn with poles lifted so as not to disturb them. Whew...no stings. 
Reached Mc Cormack Gap where I reached my 400 mile on the trail. YEAH! Feeling more and more confident.

We, the tramily, decided to take a relaxed morning and not shuttle to the trailhead until noon. Of course I was still up a 6. Clingman and I went to Weasie's for breakfast. I thought it an odd name for a cafe until he told me that Weasie is a term for grandmother in the south. Mind you I am now in the south so the adage of when in Rome do as the Roman's do should apply. But I guess I had a brain fart or just a strong desire for home cooking, instead of ordering biscuits and gravy or eggs and sausage I ordered eggs and scrapple. The eggs were fine but the scrapple came out in a brown and grey lump. Not quite the browned both side in a nice crispy rectangle. I will order the biscuits and gravy next time. Finished breakfast by 8:30 so I ended up twiddling my thumbs for awhile. The hostel was great but I wanted to be on the trail.
Finally got back to the trailhead around 12:30. We are now out of Shenandoah NP and done with the Skyline Drive. The trail roughly follows the Blue Ridge parkway until Roanoke.
Easy walk today through some beautiful hardwood forests. I passed more tulip poplars than before. I wish I knew more of the trees and flowers. And birds. I heard a bird call this afternoon and could only think that it reminded me of the phrase from Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse 5. Po toweet. 
Went by a stone chimney and foundation and the Lowe cemetery.  The stones were slate and mostly worn away. It looked abandoned but there was a marker from 2013. 
The shelter tonight is perfect. We set up our tents near a stream in a deep valley. Moss, filtered sunlight and soft burbling of the water. 
Tomorrow we have our first big climb of 2000' but it's over 6 miles so it shouldn't be too bad.","Stanimals hostel Waynesboro

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622614,"Up today at 6 AM. Long day ahead with 15.8 miles and we start with a 2000 rise over 6.4 miles. Clingman led the way. He was on trail by 6:40. I had my tent down and packed along with my clothes,sleeping bag,pad and food and hit the trail right at 7. The climb was not as bad as I pictured it. Steady gradual climb to the top of Humpback Mountain. Made the summit in 3 1/2 hours. Summit was tree covered and no views. There were two side trails that went to views but both were .2 down hill and then back up. I skipped them but Clingman went down 1 and had some fine pics. 
A mile pass the summit the path led to rock ledges that opened to the south. There we all met up. It was around lunch. There were some truly impressive vistas to the south showing were we will be tomorrow and the next day. 
Water is starting to become an issue. There was 1 piped spring early on but then not another until mile 9.4. On a warm day with a big climb it's easy to drink 2 liters of water in just a few hours. I know I did drink about 6 liters on one hot day. When I reached the spring at 9.4 I had to scoop the water with my pot into my Cnoc bag. This will be something that bears close attention as we move south.
Walked up to another ledge with a view and stumbled upon a marriage proposal happening. She said yes and a couple of her friends were there with champagne and a camera to celebrate the newly engaged couple. Pretty cool to catch that happening.
Around mile 11 or 12 the trail was fairly level but completely rock strewn. It was like PA all over again. I stepped from rock to rock to stone to boulder for a couple of miles. Not was weary legs were hoping for. 
Clingman told a great story about his encounter with a bear today. Check out his journal on this site for details. 
Made camp around 5:15. Long day and hard day but pretty big miles for our group. Heated chicken soup and made two tortillas with cheddar cheese and pepperoni. Um good. Filled stomach tired body good day.","Paul Wolf Shelter

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622673,"Today we tackled our first 4000' mountain. The Priest. Pretty cool especially since it is Sunday.  But first we had a 1200' climb up the Three Ridges. The climb was not too bad but the descent down to Harper's Creek Shelter at mile 6.4 was really difficult. I think this was first time that it took as long to descend as to climb. I was putting along at 1.5mph due to the rocky condition of the trail. I met Clingman at the shelter and a few minutes later Mojo Wiseman and Caboose arrived. We tossed around the idea of laying up at the base of Priest today and summit tomorrow but decided to do it today.
I left the shelter and to trail to the base was much better. Crossed a suspension footbridge that was pretty cool. At the parking lot at the base of Priest I met up with Crafty who was supplying trail magic. Had a banana and water. While I was talking to him Clingman came up looking a little beat. He told me he was done. His ankle was sore, he had some nerve pain and was very concerned with falling. He decided against summiting Priest. This is sad because we have traveled together for the last 10 days. But each of us makes the decisions that work for us. I wished him the best and started up. Turns out the Priest was kinder than expected. There were switchbacks for the first 2000'. There was an absolutely incredible view looking southeast from a large ledge  two thirds of the way to the top. Sat and just soaked in the beauty for a long time. The way the clouds played on the Piedmont and the color of the pastures and farmers fields reminded me of Cezanne's later paintings where he used blocks of color. Made to summit in 4 hours and walked to another large outcropping where I and Mojo sat looking north to another incredible sight. We were speechless.
Made camp above 4000'. A good day except for the loss of one of our tramily. May a fair wind blow you way Clingman.","Maupin Field Shelter

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622728,"I texted Clingman last night about his plans. He responded that he felt his body was beat. He had caught a ride to Stanimals in Waynesboro from Crafty the trail angel. He planned on renting a car to drive home and get his body right. I am sad to see him go. I don't know if I met someone with a much mental fortitude to complete the hike as Clingman but his body let him down. Perhaps later when I get to his home area we can meet up for a hike. 
Today was our biggest day yet mileage wise. 16.8 on the trail with an additional. 6 down to the next shelter. Not a lot of big ups and downs so I was hoping for a good day. Hard but good. It started beautifully. For the first mile or so I walked through fields of wildflowers. Yellow jewel weed, a yellow daisy type flower possibly a rudibacia member, white  snow caps, a yellow goldenrod and a pale purple aster type flower. Throw in some ferns and the setting is complete.  
Climbed Spy Rock this morning. It's a large outcrop with 360 degree views. I could see the Priest from there. Stopped at a shelter for some water and a quick lunch. Still had 10 plus  miles to go and the weather was looking iffy. On the trail I met a Nobo named Jaws who left Springer a long time ago. He said he had taken 22 zeros and now needed to get his butt in gear. He was hoping to make Vermont but later fall but he hadn't yet gone 900 miles. Vermont may be a pipe dream. 
Pushed hard today up some of these smaller hills and I was tiring. Finally climbed Cole Mountain near 4:30. Cole Mountain is topped by a large meadow with great views of the surrounding mountains. Took some pics and watched the sky. Heavy rain clouds were moving in from the west. The summit was very  exposed and I hurried off. Got about a mile and a half before the heavens open with a deluge. For the next 45 minutes I was drenched. Made the shelter, stripped , dried myself and got into warm clothing. The rest of the crew arrived shortly after. 
Heated some chili and beef and headed for bed. Staying in the shelter tonight with Mojo and Wiseman.","The Priest Shelter

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622778,"Slept in the shelter last night. Slept ok but prefer the tent. Just didn't feel like setting it up after yesterday's heavy rain. Still pretty misty with a lot of water dripping from the trees as I made my way back up the .6 mile side trail from the shelter. Started the day with 900' climb but then for the next 11 miles I cruised downhill and over level terrain. Met Mojo at a wayside picnic table and had a snack. Wiseman and Caboose joined us. We hiked together for the next 5 miles. Walked along Brown Mountain Creek for a couple of miles. This area was a farming community in the late 19th century and early 20th century. The community consisted of freed slaves who grow corn. They were sharecroppers so the idea of freedom is a bit of a misnomer. If they owned their team of oxen or mule they owed 25% to the landowner. If they didn't own the team the cost was 50%. On top of that they paid 1/8th to the grist mill owner. It must of been a hard scrabble life for these folk. The National Forestry Service brought them out in the 1920s which is not quite correct since the Forestry Service would have paid the landowner and not the sharecroppers so these hard working souls most likely were evicted by the Feds. History doesn't seem to change much if you ain't got the do re me.
Later we sat by a small stream crossing for lunch. Enjoyable time  but then the last 3 miles came. We climbed 1000' Mt Rice that was probably our steepest climb yet. I trudged up bitterly slow. What was a pretty smooth 15 mile hike became very draining.
Finally made the shelter at 6 PM. Set up camp and ate. It's getting dark in these hollers by 7:15 or so. No time to do much but eat and crawl into the tent. We are all feeling bone weary from long strenuous days. Looking forward to a bed and shower tomorrow in Glasgow. No vistas today but some really pretty woods.","Cow Camp Shelter

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622783,"So how does one begin. After 5 days on the trail with temperatures approaching 90 and high humidity the words for our bodily emissions do not seem to cover the reality. Stink,odor, stench, reek,fetid, malodorous, effluvium, skunk spray wrapped in dog dung,
Toe cheese and smegma sandwich. And yet none of these seem to capture the quality of air surrounding my body or what happens when you take your damp hiking boots off to reveal the several day old essence of sock.
There is only so much that body wipes can do at night in the tent. You can physically clean you body but the hiking clothes- yeesh. Time to get off the trail, resupply, shower and for god's sake launder.
So that was today's aim get to the hostel and become acquainted with civility again.  Hike out 10.5 miles and get to the pick up point for the shuttle to the hostel
 Had a couple good vistas today. One where we spent awhile watching a dung beetle do its thing schlepping a turd while doing a handstand pushing his load with his rear legs backwards.  Appropriate to our situation.
Got to Stanimals and threw all our clothes in the wash in one load. Planned on running the load through twice. Grabbed showers and took some temp clothes from the hiker box. I ended up with camo pants and a faded way too small denim shirt. Then my tramily said lets go get lunch. Oh yeah. I was looking my finest. Put my phone in the pants pocket only to have the phone slide down my leg to my foot. No pockets just openings to the inside. As I told my tramily great pants if I wanted to scratch my balls but not good for much else. Burger and a couple brews made the afternoon move along quite nicely though. Spent the evening reorganizing and eating some slices of pizza. Kinda nice to be normal for a few hours but we have 14.5 lined up for tomorrow and possibly some storms.

The hostel had two bunk rooms. Caboose and Mojo shared one and Wiseman and Jamie,  the shuttle driver for the hostel and I shared the other one.
Jamie dropped us off at the JamesRiver Foot bridge. It's the longest pedestrian foot bridge on the trail. It is named for William T Foot. A thru hiker and president of the local AT chapter.  Elevation of the bridge is 653 feet. Hike started smoothly as we followed the river upstream for a mile ,and the turned into the wilderness. Climbed slowly for a while but then became really steep. Slow going after a day of burgers, fries, pizza and beer. Took a while to sweat all that out. Climbed through the mist from the James river into sunlight.  Caught a cool scene as the sun burned through the mist. No real views today until late in the afternoon. The two stories for today was our search for water and the amount of elevation gain we hiked. It has been so dry here with only scattered showers in the area. No sustained rain so several normally reliable springs are dry. We ended up carry a lot of extra water from 3 miles before the shelter because we saw on Guthooks that there was no water at the shelter. In fact when we arrived at Thunder Hill the cistern was only mud. The next reliable water is 5 miles south tomorrow. 
The other story was all the ups we had today. When we finally arrived at the shelter we had climbed 4452'. That was substantially more than when we climbed the Priest.  I am definitely weary tonight. 
Almost to Daleville. Only a few more days with this group of folks who I really enjoy hiking with.","Stanimals hostel Glasgow

We'll see what manana brings.
Last night before we all turned in Moho looked up at some dead limbs above us and kindly pointed out several widow makers if the wind started blowing. Needless to say. I then woke up every time the slightest breeze wafted through the trees last night. I thanked her in the morning for my restless night. 
Today was a good hard day. Started in a cool mist. Walked only a mile or so when I came to the guillotine. This is a large rock formation where a 4'boulder is stuck between two vertical rock slabs about 12' above your head. The trail passes directly under the boulder. You know the rock won't fall but you hurry under it anyway.
Passed my 500th mile on the AT today. While that is not much for a thru hiker I am still pretty  proud of myself. That's a lot of work for 38 days on the trail. I'm also down about 15lbs.
We stopped at one good vista but the clouds were still fairly low so the view was muted however we did walk through some beautiful woods. We spent a long time meandering along a rhododendron woods with their gnarly and twisted limbs overhanging our heads and the evergreen leaves shrouding us like an entrance to a hidden garden. In another section I was starting down into a bowl and realized that as far as I could see were jewel weeds in bloom abuzz with honey bees darting in and out of the pitcher like pale yellow flowers.
Speaking of bees, today was also yellowjackets and hornets day. We passed 3 trees during our hike that had nests of these suckers at the base on the edge of the trail. Twice we had to go off trail to avoid their aggressiveness. Luckily no stings.
Made 10 miles before 1pm and had lunch at Bryant Ridge Shelter. Met Tycoon there. He tried to thru hike last year but shin splints stopped him after 900 miles. He is now day hiking the trail in this area.
Finished our 14 miles by 3 in the afternoon. Glad we decided to stay at the campground because there were a lot of ups and downs today and we were beat. 
Tycoon came out to his car just as we were figuring out how to get to the campground that was a mile and a half up the road. He graciously offered to drive us. Thank you trail angel. 
Rented a cabin for the 4 of us tonight. Hot food, hot shower and an ice cream cone. Nice lazy evening.

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623272,"Had another discussion with Mojo last night. She was widowed a couple years ago suddenly and her husband was the love of her life. He was a Native American and an artist. She was originally going to hike the AT before his death but circumstances didn't work out.  The hike now is her journey for questions and answers and more. We have had some good conversations about god, life and living. I will miss her when I depart from them tomorrow. She has tweaked my mind is a lot of ways.  I wish her the best since blisters and aching muscles are easy to come by hiking but answers are elusive even though you have a lot of time to think.
Got a ride from the campground hostess in the back of her Tacoma pickup. The 4 of us and our packs rumbling and bouncing down country roads. 
17 miles today. Last time we did 17 miles we were toasted in spirit and drenched in body from a late afternoon shower. Today was cloudy and overcast. Probably no rain but no sun either.
The trail follows the Blue Ridge Parkway for several miles after we passed the Peaks of Otter lodge so our vistas today turned out to be the same vistas that Eileen and I had seen when we drove on this section of the Parkway last year when we vacationed in the area. Good thing to since the vistas were completely shrouded by clouds, I could describe to my companions what we would be seeing on a clear day. 
The trail was kind with only 1 big climb and 2 lesser ones.  Most of the time was spent  walking on some ridges among trees and shrubs.  Again water was the issue. We collected water from a slow run off stream by the road to Peaks of Otter. That got us to a spring about a 1 mile from the shelter. Good thing it was cloudy and cool or else we would have been thirsty. 
The sun finally made its appearance in the afternoon and I walked in dappled sunlight and a light breeze. About a half mile from the shelter the trail makes a 180 degree turn but right off the turn is a path up a steep outcrop. I didn't think there would be a vista but something called me up the hill. I got to the top and found a granite block on top of the stone outcrop. Chiseled into the block was ""If tears could build a stairway, and memories a lane, I'd walk right up to heaven and bring you home again.""  This outcrop is not near a road or easy access. Someone with a great love and great loss had carried that stone memorial a long way to place it where it was among the stone, trees and breeze. Mojo walked by while I was reading the stone and I called her up. She read it silently and moved back to the trail.

Mojo, Wiseman and Caboose were still packing when I was ready to hike. I bid them farewell at the shelter. I probably won't see them again. Hiked by myself today. Isn't that why I came out here anyway...to hike by myself. See what turns up in my head...if anything.
Filtered some water within the first mile. There was an old sign there stating this was once a collier's pit where charcoal was made for early iron foundries in area. Like the sharecroppers village it's hard to imagine this area treeless and bustling with 19th century commerce. Now I am standing in a deeply shadowed hollow that barely hints of the past. My eyes don't see it but the archeologist's eye is more finely attuned to the nuances of the terrain.
Moving on I made very good time, enough to hike up to Fullhardt Knob Shel. I had some snacks there and rested. This shelter has a cool cistern system. Water is collected from the metal roof into gutters and into a closed cistern that is then accessed by a pipe behind the shelter. Only one I saw like this. Got to my rendezvous point by 1:15. I ended up waiting long enough for my tramily to catch up with me. We had another fine round of hugs and goodbyes before my ride arrived. I am now off the trail for awhile. Going home by train to see Eileen and the pup and go see Hamilton in Philly.
But first I got to see a very good friend who I had not seen in over 30 years. I had a great dinner with KO. She said she started to read my journal but expected less reporting and more introspection. She makes a valid point. I will attempt to add some more thoughtfulness to my entries and still maintain what I see day to day.

Look at me - doing a 21st century thing. Stayed in Daleville at the Super 8 which is only a couple hundred yards from the trail crossing. I had a great time st home with Eileen and Utley. Saw Hamilton at the Forrest with Lou and Janis. Really enjoyed the whole experience. Music, actors,stage,stagecraft were all excellent. I had a harder time leaving than I did before. Maybe it was that I wasn't home long enough or perhaps too long and I started to settle back in. Perhaps it was knowing I would be on my own again. My tramily is some 130 miles farther along. Anyway I had a restless sleep and felt uneasy starting the hike. I even had a passing thought that I could finish this week and the iconic peaks that I climb over the next couple days and then hop down south to meet up with Mojo, Caboose and Wiseman.
But really why am I out here. I'm here for myself and what I can learn about a 67 year old coot.
I shook off these feelings and started to get my head out of my backside.
After all today is my 42nd day on the trail and as we know 42 is the answer to the universe. Now what was that question?
Within a couple miles I had my 1st vista looking back toward Daleville.
I was at about 5.5miles when I heard this racket off to my right. I looked over and saw a bear cub climbing down a tree. He was looking at me the whole time. When he hit the ground he scampered off down the hill away from me and the trail. As soon as he was gone, my head went on a swivel. Where was Momma Bear? I made a lot of noise and moved on up the trail away from the cub. I'm not sure who was more nervous?
Rest of the hike was without visits from wildlife except for a chipmunk. I haven't seen many of them in VA. Summited Tinker Cliffs after 2:00. My God what a view. I looked right into Tinker Valley and could see the creek. The clouds were moving fast and the wind from the northeast was blowing hard. Birds were riding the thermals. I see why these cliffs are 1 part of the VA triple crown. Tomorrow McAfee Knob will be two.
Saw hardly anyone on the trail but when I made the shelter it looked like camping at Philly Folkfest. There has to be 15 tents around the shelter. Turns out there is a women's hiking group here. Luckily they are headed north. Still there will be decent number of people hiking in the morning up to the knob.

Beautiful sunny day with passing clouds. No humidity and the air was crisp. How does one describe this knob? It is breadth taking. The trail weaves uphill through laurel shrubs that block your view of the climb. The trail twists narrowly upward over rocks and sand. Finally on the ridge I am walking along and see a small trail to my right. Unmarked. Turning onto it within a few feet the world explodes before my eyes. I am on a cliff with mountains rolling to the horizon. The sun burns through the clouds and down into the valleys. The cliff stone is turned slightly upward as I walk to the edge. There is no one here. I have this to myself for a little while. No earthshaking thoughts, no revelations, just the shear beauty and wonderment laid before me. I can see why it is one of the most photographed places on the trail. Now I want someone here who can take my picture standing on the edge. Luckily for me a day hiker arrives with his dog. We take turns shooting each other and 5 minutes later he is gone. I have this place to myself again. After an hour I need to move on. I set up a short day today. I only want to get to the base of Dragon's Tooth. I take my time. Water is an issue. After the shelter there is no water for the next 9 miles. I was a little thirsty before I made the brook.  Not being sufficiently hydrated causes me to be sluggish so I was glad for the short day. Around 3pm I got off the trail and walked a half mile to a convenience store. Had some pizza and Gatorade and talked to a vet for awhile. He had just come from the VA. On the way back up to the trailhead, a car stopped and a young man asked me if I wanted a ride. So I hopped in and thanked him. He said ""Sure, no problem old timer."" Damn I got old timered for the first time in my life. I had to laugh to myself. Judging by how I looked I guess it is appropriate but still old timer. I felt I was in a Matt Dillon western. Just needed my pack mule and my pan for gold.

The 1 mile trail was very steep and rocky. At two points there were steel rungs driven into the rock face for hand and foot holds. Glad I have long legs and was going up. Coming down that could be tough. But some people did that last night. Around 8:30 well after dark 3 or 4 headlamps lit up the trail coming down from the summit. More power to them. Dragon's Tooth is a large pinnacle of rock jutting at a sharp angle from the top of the mountain. It stands about 60 feet tall. To get up on it I had to rock climb about 15 feet. Not much but more that I an comfortable with. The view was worth it.  A fitting end to this section of the trail. Now the trail follows ridges without a lot of grand vistas. There was one more thing worthwhile. I passed the Audie Murphy memorial. It is placed near the place his plane crashed in 1971. The VFW placed it. I usually remember him as  a B-movie star in Westerns but it was very moving to read what he accomplished as an infantryman in WWII. The most decorated soldier. What is even more moving is the amount of items left by other military personnel. Dog tags, service ribbons, small army men and toy tanks. As well as notes thanking him for his service. This is not a location that is easy to get to. People worked  hard to honor him and his fellow soldiers. 
Set up my tent at the shelter. There were 3 other hikers there all going northbound.

Now that the Triple Crown is behind me I am in a section of VA that is not very special. Outlooks are few and far between. Today I walked along some ledges with views to the southeast but the haze muted any color. If these forests don't get rain soon there probably won't be much in the way of Autumn colors. I am noticing more trees that appear stressed. The leaves are just turning brown and dropping. There is some color. The sumac is turning red. The story today was heat and lack of water. I rationed myself pretty well and still I barely got to Laurel Creek with any h2o. To top it off I walked through several miles of meadows which makes no shade. The one good thing about the meadows, I shot a couple nice pics of the mountains I had crossed in the morning.

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623712,"Set up tent last night near a road. I could not make the next shelter due to darkness.  No one else around. If this keeps up the name Anhaga will be even more appropriate. The word comes from the Anglo-Saxon poem ""The Wanderer. "" The poet did not choose the title. No poems from that period had titles. Most likely some Victorian age scholar decided he liked the sound of wanderer. I liked it too since is works for why I'm out here. However the main character is not a wanderer in the sense of Dion DeMucci's song. He is a warrior/knight who has lost his lord and his fellow warriors. He is looking back on his life and all that he has lost. The Anglo-saxons were not the most litehearted peoples. Anhaga literally means lone dweller. Haga means an enclosure. I read one interpretation where the writer argues that haga can also connote an enclosure like a fort or defensive perimeter. That interpretation works for this character. The only defender left from his clan who is now living on the edge of society. While I'm not claiming to be the last defender or some heroic warrior I do see similarities to walking this trail spending a lot of time by myself (especially now that I have lost my tramily), coming into shelters alone, passing a few minutes in conversation with hikers going north. I think about the protagonist a lot while hiking. He is a complex human who has lost much and is asking God why. Why is he still alive when his fellows have fallen, his king has fallen, his riches are gone. Why must he sit in a corner of the mead hall looking out at strangers. I will return to this theme later but for now I need to sleep. I have picked up a cold and the rain late this afternoon didn't help. Crawling into my sleeping bag for warmth.
There are several good translations of the poem that can easily be found however there is definitely some poor translations out there also.

I had perused Guthooks and saw that I could get a shuttle into Pearisburg at mile 15, beyond Rice Field Shelter (where there is no water), into Angel's Rest hostel a day early. The hostel also offers some slack packing options. Slack packing is when you just carry a day pack with food and water for a day and leave your full pack either at the hostel or have it transferred to the next hostel. It's a good way to take it easy and still make some miles. With my cold this is intriguing. I am slowly learning how to cope with the water issue. I made sure I drank a liter and a half before I left the shelter today so I was fully hydrated. Made the 1300' ascent in good time.
Called the hostel and arranged a pick up time. Walked along the Peters Mountain ridgecrest for most of the morning. At one point I was just cruising along when I saw a bear cub scurry off to my right. About 10 seconds later Momma Bear pops her head up about 35 yards away. She has that face of any mother whose looking for the stupid lout that scared her cub. Kinda pissed and kinda of ""are you kidding me, don't I have enough going on?""

I too hurried away from her but not before I got a pic of her. Rest of the walk was uneventful...thankfully.
Had a good lunch spot over looking a valley. Met a flip flopper named McAfee. He had started his hike at McAfee knob and was just about finished his hike. So cool for the young man. That afternoon I had one of the worst sections of trail since PA. Rocks and more rocks for about 4 miles however when I got through them I came to an open meadow where Rice Field Shelter is. The view to the northwest was outstanding. You could see clearly into West Virginia. What a great place to watch the sunset but I was low on water and committed to the hostel. Angel's Rest is a good place. They set me up in a private room in a house trailer due to my cold. Eat Mexican, did my laundry, got a great hot shower - 1st in 6 days, and arranged to slack pack the next day to Wood's Hole hostel.
Otie from the Hiker Yearbook was there but I didn't talk to him. Seems he was in a heated conversation with one of the hostel workers which I avoided listening to. I've had a good day-dont need no more drama.  Bear was enough drama.
But did see something funny tonight. As I was coming back from dinner I had to walk behind the Food Lion to get to the hostel. It was just dark and I had my head lamp on. I saw all these fleeting eyes lite by my light. As i get closer it was a bunch of cats eating food scraps But also there were some skunks mixed in with the cats. Rightfoot from the hostel told me that cats and skunks are not natural predators to each other and so they dont mind coexisting.","Pine Swamp Branch Shelter

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623843,"So I am slack packing today. Rightfoot is hauling my backpack over the Woods Hole for me. The Osprey Aether backpack I use has a detachable top that converts to a day pack so it's really convenient for me to slack pack.
On the trail again early. There is a magical feeling to the day when I am just entering it and the woods are misty and the breeze is soft. Before the day knows what to do with itself. Will it be cloudy, cool or sunny and warm? Will it treat you to a nice walk in the woods or will you be sweating your armpits off.  All that comes later for now is the time before decisions. It's the walking up time, the yawning and stretching time. That time before the first cup of coffee. When the deer glide out of the mist and slowly fades back into it, unhurried and unafraid. When the leaves are still damp with dew and the smell of the forest is fresh with pine and leaf mulch. That earthy smell that blends so well with the seeping mist. When the sun is only a whiteness off your left shoulder-not a hot glare. This is the time I love most in the day. Why I will always be on the trail early. 
Loved walking with only a day pack. Quite a change. Took some time to talk to an old friend, George. We caught up while I was looking down into a beautiful valley. By now the day had made it decision. Hot and hazy with continued dry. Reached Woods Hole by 4:30. There is a section hiker going nobo from Villanova. He's a sports guy so we spend some time talking Philles, Eagles and Sixers. Training camp has started for Joel and crew. 
Woods Hole is the most picturesque place. It is an 1840's chestnut wood and mortar cabin on a 100 acres looking eastward down into a valley over a large meadow. The bunk house is also an old log cabin from the 19th century. Neville who runs it is a very engaging woman who makes communal meals for all the guests. There are only 3 hikers tonight but her cousin Amy is here visiting from Cambridge MA as well as Achilles(real name) who is helping out for awhile at the hostel. Had a great organic meal. Some good discourse and I got a tour of the house. The place belonged to her grandparents who started this hostel back in the 1980s for the folks on the AT. Just an iconic place to stay.","Angel's Rest hostel Pearisburg

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623844,"Woke up to one of the best sunrises ever. The hostel sits looking almost due east with clear views into the valley. As I was walking out to the bathroom to brush my teeth the sky was turning from black to orange over the distant mountains and across the meadow. I don't  think I would ever get used to or bored waking up to this. Neville was kind enough to leave a chocolate chip and oatmeal square for me for breakfast. She makes breakfast for the hikers but not til 8 and I was long gone by then.  I had a long talk last night with the two Nobos,  Special Ed - from Villanova - and AG who is a flip flopper. They both said there is very little water for the next couple of days hike. I decided to head for the next hostel - Lick Skillet. The guy who runs it, Mongo, has been putting water caches out at cross roads for the hikers. However his hostel is 20.5 miles from Woods Hole. This is my longest hike so far and no slack packing plus I had a .5 mile uphill from the hostel to the trail. What the hell I've been out almost 5 weeks now so I should be able to do it. Turns out the trail was good to me. Even though it got into the upper 80s again today, I spent most of my day in heavy rhododendron and pine forests and I walked across a valley for many miles. Probably my easiest walk except for distance. I think I may finally be into better terrain for awhile. More pine straw on the path and a few less rocks. However there are no vistas now. I am in that area of VA between the beauty of McAfee knob, Dragon's Tooth to the north and Grayson Highlands to the south. Both these areas have spectacular views but not here. Here you walk for miles through woods going up and down but rarely seeing an opening out to the next ridge or valley. To be frank it can be boring. Well maybe not boring but certainly repetitive. I still have a few more days of this to go so might as well try for more miles and less days of this area. Called Mongo and arranged for a pick up around 6:30. He was at the trail crossing waiting and took me down the half mile to his place. This is another cool place. Mongo was a thwarted thru hiker. He started several years ago and made it to Damascus from Springer
When he had some legal problems. He had legal problems before. This time when he was released he asked God what he wanted from him. His answer was to help and serve others. So he decided to open a hostel. Turns out there was an abandoned church in Bland VA that was for sale for very little so he brought it and opened Lick Skillet hostel. He works in conjunction with Appalachian Trail Outreach Ministries. This a a donation based hostel that has free food to cook. It very cool getting to sleep in an old church especially since I have it to myself. These 3 nights of staying inside and getti.g showers has really helped me with my cold. Mongo also talked about the lack of water tomorrow on the trail and convinced me to slack pack again. So that is what I will do again manana.","Woods Hole hostel 
",Lick Skillet hostel ,"Oct 03, Thu",20.50
Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623991,"Slack packing again today. Mongo dropped me off at the trail head at 7:30 after I had a bowl of cereal and instant decaf. Life is grand. As I said yesterday, this part of VA doesn't have a lot of sights. The trail goes up and down over lower mountains that are covered in trees with few outcrops. Made good time. Mongo had left a water cache at mile 4 which made getting to Brushy Mountain Outpost easier. This is a little dive restaurant and store that sits above I77 near Bland. Right before I got to the store I caught up to a Sobo, a young woman, but I didn't get a chance to talk much since she was hiking into town for a maildrop.
Had a great bacon cheeseburger with a humongous order of fries, called Mongo, arranged for pick up and wandered on. I had one nice view into a small valley after lunch but that was all.
On the ride back and at the hostel talked to Mongo about expectations. When I was at Woods Hole, Neville had an incident where some slack packers from Angel's rest dropped their full packs at her place just temporarily. They didn't intend to stay the night at her hostel but they never called her to ask permission. When Neville saw the packs she assumed she had more guests for dinner and started to plan accordingly. Her expectations changed when she saw the packs. When the hikers showed up to get their packs and maybe something to eat without staying Neville became angry. The result of her anger was a poor review on Guthooks. No mention by the hikers that they didn't have the common courtesy to call and ask permission. At dinner the night in Woods Hole we talked about this  and how seeing the packs changed her expectations. She is still trying to resolve setting expectations. We all do. I set them constantly when I hike and then try to meet them rather than just hike and enjoy the moment. Mongo on the other hand is working hard to live without expectations. He said he used to have rules for the hostel and would get pissed off if someone didn't keep the rules but then he realized he was the only one who was hurt by this. So he took the rules down and makes a conscious effort not to get wired by other people's actions. Not a bad philosophy if you can adhere to it. There would be a lot less confrontations that way.","Lick Skillet hostel

I was able to get some good rest and was able to relax for awhile and still get good miles. Today I planned on hiking up to Burke's Garden  and shelter at Chestnut Knob. Burke's Garden is an unusual geological formation. It's like the caldera of a volcano but I heard it was formed when a large limestone deposit below the mountain top eroded away and the mountaintop collapsed. The result is a well defined rim and a soil rich farming community in the crater. Only problem for me was by the time I reached the rim I was in the clouds, the wind was howling about 25mph, half raining and the temperatures were in the 50s. I couldn't see a thing.  I walked as fast as I could over the jagged rocks. After a few miles I was taking a break when the Sobo girl from yesterday caught up to me. We talked for a few minutes and I told her my trail name. Turns out she had taken a course in Anglo-Saxon and had read The Wanderer. How weird is that. Her name is No One. After a few minutes she was out of sight.  Made me wonder if I had imagined meeting No One. Crested Chestnut Knob and it was completely fogged in. Checked weather forecast and it called for rain tomorrow so I pushed on for another 4 miles to get off the Crest. Found a really good site and made camp.

Lasted for about 2 hours, enough to let me know that I need better rain gear.  My jacket is barely ok.  Next year it will be goretex or similar.  Too important to maintain core body heat. I am getting really tired of this section of VA. It's been several days now without any impressive views, mostly just slogging through woods with ups and downs. Nobos talk about the Virginia Blues. The mental down time after you've been on the trail for several hundred miles. I think so of it is also due to this area. It is a little depressing going through the same old sme old day after day.

Rain is in the forecast for later today and I want to get to a shelter.
Within a half mile of leaving camp, I crossed a pasture stile and saw a memorial to Stronghold. He was the hiker who was murdered this year on the trail. Maybe that was  part of the reason for my VA Blues yesterday. His death had cast a pallor over this area. I felt a sadness for his passing. Here was a guy out trying to figure out this life and for no reason it was cut short. The man who killed him was mentally ill and who know if he even knew what he was doing. Senseless and sad. My day got better though. A couple of hours later I met Graduate. She is assisting her daughter finish her thru hike. She offered me water and told me they would be at the same shelter tonight. She offered to help me slack pack tomorrow so that will be nice and help set me up to get to Damascus by Friday.
Rest of walk was rocky but not too hard. People who talk of Rocksylvania must have forgotten what Southern VA is like. Made it to the shelter by 3 to and have been able to chill.

He identifies as queer.  Born a woman but doesn't see himself that way. Anyway he has thru hiked both Nobo and Sobo. Near as I can figure he lives near Asheville and currently is out doing both hiking and bein a trail angel. He is a great source of knowledge on this area of the trail. He hiked with Oreo yesterday but Rue is an older dog and had trouble keeping up with Oreo. He is taking the day off the trail today and I will slack pack alone with a 15 year old girl. Probably will be the longest amount of time I ever spent with a teenage girl. I'm used to my two boys. It's still a treat to slack pack. Feel a little quilt but boy can I move faster without the full pack. I was able to keep up with her both uphill and down. Maybe because she talked the entire time and all I had to do was listen. I didn't need try to talk and breathe at the same time.i heard about her hike so far. She has completed over 2000 miles and is into the final stage. Seems she slack packed most of it with the considerable assistance from her mom Graduate. I heard about school, freeze drying hiking food, 5 different pairs of shoes, hair,books and family. The day flew by as did the miles. I did get a chance to talk to Eileen. The cell service is incredibly spotty in this part of the state. This is my 5 or 6 journal entry that I have written but not been able to upload yet. Rained in the morning for a couple of hours. It's been chilly and damp also with temps in the low 60s. Constantly putting on and taking off layers. Completed just under 14 miles by 2 PM. There wasn't a good place to meet the car again for like 8 miles so we called it a day. Rain looked imminent so I decided to join these folks at a donation based church run hostel only a couple mile from trail. It did start to rain within an hour.

Curious how long my luck can last. Day 2 of slack packing with Oreo. Arrived at the trail head and Graduate said we were waiting for a special guest. A couple minutes later Midnight arrived. She is a young woman who had hiked with Oreo for a couple months and had summited Kathadin with her. She lives a couple hours away and came to hike one day with Oreo. The 3 of us got off and running. Trail started with a trail detour so we walked a couple miles on the road. I'm excited today to hike into Grayson Highlands.  Finally getting to higher elevations and views again. Grayson is also home to wild ponies. Trail rose gradually through beautiful trees and moss covered rocks with slowly clearing skies. So glad to be away from dreariness for a day or so. We made great time. By midafternoon we were in the Highland. We walked through The Scales  which is an enclosure with long horn cows. Took a few pics before the long horns started to make their way closer. And we're off.
A few minutes later came upon some of the ponies. So cool. Got up to Wilburn Ridge and climbed an outcrop. The lighting was perfect. The clouds both low and scattered. Saw lots of patches of blue sky. This was what I have walked from Dragon's Tooth for. I have one more day of this environment before heading down into Damascus. Made it over 5000 feet today.

She and her mother head farther south this afternoon to meet some other friends to continue hiking. Oreo fills the air with talk which makes the miles go by so I will miss hiking with her. The day was as perfect a day as i could possibly imagine. As I hiked last week i hoped for good weather when i reached Grayson and today did not disappoint. When we reached the trail head the sun was bright,  the air cool and clear and my spirits were super high. We quickly came up on more wild ponies. Graduate walked with us for almost a mile. I was able to take a pic of mother and daughter with the ponies. After Graduate left for her car, Oreo and I climbed an outcrop. You could see for miles. The clouds were heavy below us in the distant valleys spread like spun cotton candy to the horizon with an occasional mountain top peaking up. This lasted for a couple of hours until we left the crest and started down the southern side of the highland. We walked back into forest and rocky trail.
We had several other views later in the day. On Buzzard Rock were some outstanding vistas both to the east and west. By 4:30 our travels together was ending as we reached Graduate's Suburban. I loaded up my pack, fist pumped Oreo and Biscuit and hugged Graduate. I headed south back to the trail and hike up a mile to Lost Mountain Shelter. Back on my own again. At the shelter, I met Jiffy Pop, a section hiker who got on in Daleville a few days before me. He's been hiking solo a little ahead of me for two weeks. We got to talking and we find out that his son and Liam both have AE degrees from PSU and they both graduated in 2011. They must know each other. Jiffy Pop now lives in NC but was living in Conn when the kids were in school. I'm excited to reach out to Lee and see if he know him.

A wonderful crisp night. I snuggled deep into my sleeping bag for a very restful night. Didn't feel like getting out of the bag the next morning though I had 16 miles to go before town. I am so excited to reach Damascus. It is just about the end of VA. The longest state on the AT wears on one after a month long journey south. I'll be glad for Tennessee. Though there are no privies in TN so I will be digging cat holes. I have been able to avoid that for a long long time. There's something to be said for the simple pleasure of an outhouse.
The trail was easy today. My body and mind have grown accustomed to the up hills. I may not be a fast as as thru hiker but I am much faster on climbs than I was and I recover a lot faster. I forgot to mention that the other day when I was hiking with Oreo and Midnight, they described me as a LASH. A long ass section hiker. I love that moniker. Definitely apropos to what I'm doing. Whenever anyone asks if I'm a thru hiker from now on I'm telling them I'm a LASH. I think 800 miles makes one a long ass hiker. Met Fish and Grace on the trail again today. I can't remember if I have mentioned them before. I have seen them almost daily since Dragon's Tooth. They are slack packing the entire AT this year. They started in Kathadin and are working their way south to Springer but they hike north every day. They must have two cars and just keep leap frogging south to hike north to the spot they ended the day before. They are doing between 15 and 20 miles a day which is similar to my distances so that is why we keep meeting up. Very unique way to hike it. Not sure if I will see them again after my zero. Texted back and forth with Mojo. They are still 50 miles ahead of me so there is no way I can catch them.
Dropped off the mountain around 3:30 and onto the VA Creeper Trail which is a rail to trail. I am less than a half mile to Damascus. This is a holiday weekend and as I found out later, the schools are off for the week for fall break. The Creeper trail is full of bikes and walkers. A strange sight for me after seeing very few people on the AT. Damascus is hopping. The first building I come to is Wicked Chicken, a restaurant and ice cream parlor. I had to stop. Got a bacon cheeseburger with fries and a Beaver Rage, an IPA from Damascus Brewing. Ah, nice way to get to town. After food headed to Broken Fiddle Hostel. I didn't get a great vibe from this place. Seemed like it could be a party place and a little run down. Turns out they had no internet. Here you need internet just to make phone calls. That was a deal killer. Threw on my pack and walked further into town. Knocked on the door of the Hiker Inn. They had 1 room left for the weekend. What luck! This is one of the nicest hostels on the trail. Got a private room, a shower, clean clothes. Feeling pretty good. Walked a mile last night to the market and resupplied. The local brewery was across the street.

Definitely not a heavy schedule of activities which is great since my legs were feeling pretty leaden from the last 250 miles of daily hiking. The Hiker's Inn is on the trail and is a great place to stay. It's run by Lee and Paul who are perfect hosts. Paul through hiked in 2010. While hiking through Damascus he saw that the Inn was for sale so he contacted his wife, Lee, and while he hiked she concluded the sale. It's a small house with an addition and a converted garage. I had a bedroom to myself so it was very relaxing.
Talked to Marty and Kate and worked out details for a ride from the trail at Hot Springs to Asheville and then the next day down to Greenville SC where I can get the Amtrak home.
Damascus is a neat little town. Several eateries, a brewery and several outfitters. There is a big business in bike rentals and shuttles for the VA Creeper trail. All day long these companies shuttle riders 17 miles up the trail for a slight downslope ride back to town. Pretty sweet.

Finally able to have some decent brewed decaf...I know, i know, there is no such thing as decent decaf but for me and my voluntary ban on caffeine, I take what I can get and this coffee was decent.
Called Eileen and we talked about some JM Synge plays that will be in Phila on Oct 26 and 27. After all the help and support from her, it is an easy decision to end my hike 3 days early so I can be home by the 24th so we can see the plays. Playboy of the Western World, Riders to the Sea and some shorter works. Should be a great weekend. Now I need to contact Marty and hopefully work out an earlier pick up.
I got everything packed. It's always hard shoving in all the food resupply into the Ursack bear proof bag, plus the pack is a lot heavier with a full resupply.
Started hiking down the main street around 9:45. Turns out the climb was not as bad as advertised. It was steep but not a killer. It rose steadily with some switch backs. I quickly realized if I had left earlier I could have made the shelter at 18 miles but I was too late to attempt that.
This is when I need to take a breadth and slow down. I have set up good hiking distances for the next few days. I need to just settle down and enjoy the trail. The terrain has changed for the better. I didn't have any rock scrambles at all today. There was dirt under my feet for almost the entire 10 miles. I don't know if this is what Tennessee will be like but I hope so.
At mile 3.8 today I finished VA and walked into Tennessee. Finally. That was a long 545 miles.
I reached the shelter by 3 PM. There is an older couple already here who are out for a few days. They are retired professors from Wake Forest. They try to complete a few days every year working slowly from Springer to Harper's Ferry. Ate dinner with them and chitchatted about the trail. No great epiphanies tonight.

It is now abandoned but is one of the oldest shelters on the trail. It is a log structure with a tin roof. No mortar was used between the logs so it must of been windy at time. Pretty cool though to see possibly one of the original shelters from the 1930s. As I was here the sky cleared and the rest of the day was blue sky and sun. Cool temperatures so a fine day to hike.

I woke to rain today as had been forecast. Had some cereal and a cup of coffee with caffeine which I thoroughly diluted with milk. I was walking by 7:45. I had two mountains to climb today and about 15 miles to go. KJ had mentioned the night before that if I pushed for another two miles I could cut down the 19 I had planned to tomorrow. So that was in the back of my mind. First mountain was great. All switchbacks up to the summit. 3 miles up and I made it in about 1 1/2 hours. Going down just as smooth. This is were expectations and assumptions come in.  First I now understand that each mountain teaches you its own lesson. First mountain - smooth and welcoming. Second mountain. By this time the rain had penetrated my pants which are not waterproof. My jacket was doing fine though. I had purchased a new Northface in Damascus. However I am now hiking on late October and the weather has turned colder. So I got to the Laurel Creek shelter and decided to have some lunch and see if I could wait out the rain. No such luck. I waited an hour and the rain still clung on as a heavy mist. I changed into dry socks, pants and underclothes. Got back on the trail and this is when the second mountain siad whoa do you think you'll have it as easy as this morning. The trail went along a very narrow rocky ledge above a creek which lead to a waterfall. Rocks slippery with rain. Once I got past that the trail turned upward. Upward like 300 stone steps almost vertical. Stone steps on the trail means stepping anywhere from 12 inches to 20 inches between each step. And this is in a cold misty rain with the wind picking up. So much for expectations. Never assume that what one mountain showed you will be similar to the next one. As I climbed up the rain abated but the winds increased exponentially. Now starting to gusts near 25 or 30 mph. As I was finally nearing the top I meet Grizzly Gramps. He was trying to change into warmer clothes. He said he felt a little hypothermia coming on and needed to get warmer. I had seen his name in some entries in Guthooks and knew he was headed south but he told me he was going back down the mountain which was north. I convinced him to turn around and follow me. This was a strong reminder of how you need to always be aware. Rain, cold temperature, wind and exposure can lead to some nasty outcomes. I know I was cold and very concerned about my core body temperature especially since I had on wet clothes. I double checked on Grizzly and made my way to the shelter. The forecast was for 35 degree low and winds blowing steady at 25 mph with gusts to 40 mph. Set my tent in the lee of the shelter with the narrow end facing the wind. KJ was already there and set up
Grizzly showed up and used the shelter. He built a great fire for which I was very thankful. Hung my clothes up to dry and hunkered down for what I am sure will be a windy night.
Glad I made the shelter, there was no way I could have gone those extra 2 miles.","Boots Off Hostel

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624254,"Turns out the wind lived up to the forecast. It howled and roared all night like jets taking off over your head. The gap faces north northwest and the winds came form the northwest which means they flew into the base of the mountain and rushed up the face and directly over the shelter. All night long. I'm very glad I checked for widow makers before I set up my tent. Along with the wind the temperatures dropped.  To freezing. I was bundled in my bag, my liner and had my buff and wool cap on. Only my nose stuck out of the bag and that was pretty cold by morning. Around dawn the winds began to slow but it was still cold. I got on the trail a little before 8 but still a little cold. There was no rain but the clouds were heavy and the wind was chilly. This did not make for a good morning. I felt tired, achy and just not into hiking. Why am I doing this? Maybe I should just cut it shorter and come back out when it's warmer. Whine whine whine. My internal argument. Every thing becomes more pointed. My knees now hurt instead of ache. My cold is now not just sneezing but a fever too. It's cold and damp. Ah grow up. Stupid internal piques.
I plodded along knowing I needed 18 miles today to set up Roan Highlands for tomorrow. Got to a shelter for lunch and realized I had already gone over 9 miles. The sun was coming out, the wind had ceased and the temp  was warming. I felt much better. It's scary how much I allow myself to be controlled by my environment. I ended up having a great hike today. Did over 18 miles, got to a meadow and saw the Roan Highlands laid out before me and became super excited about tomorrow.
Decided to go to a hostel tonight so I could wash all my wet gear and dry it. I want to be better prepared to summit tomorrow and stay in the highest shelter on the AT. Not surprisingly, KJ caught up to me at the meadow and is staying at the hostel. We'll summit together tomorrow.","Moreland Gap Shelter

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624331,"Station 19 turned out to be a very good hostel. The bar downstairs served good wings and a tasty Reuben. They have a large music listening room in the rear where local bands and practice and perform. KJ and I caught a ride from Bill the bartender this morning back to the trailhead. It was cold to start out. Frost on the cars in the parking lot.
Trail was a steady climb but not nasty. I made better time up the initial 3000' than I thought I could do. KJ still was faster. He soon lost me but at Doll Flats he was waiting to filter water. Not long after that we broke out onto the bald of Hump Mountain. Then the Roan Highlands open up. The vistas were astounding.360 degree views of endless mountain ridges and valleys. I wish I could judge distances because it felt like I could see 50 miles.  The moon was still settling over the peak of Hump Mountain. Took some pics that kinda show it. Oh for a Hasseblad and Ansel Adam's eye. I can't do justice to the beauty of this area. I walked over several balds today and each time the scenes were breathtaking. The weather was perfect. Blue sky, wispy clouds, sof tf breezes and the temperatures were very comfortable maybe mid 50s. Like Grayson Highlands this day was all I could hope for. Had lunch on a sunny outcrop with KJ.  I got in front of him for a little bit but later he passed me walking with a thru hiker. KJ can keep pace with them. I figured I would see him at the shelter but when I got here around 5 he was not here. I guess he moved on to a tent site a little further on. I had a pleasant time talking to him in the evenings but he is getting off tomorrow anyway.
This shelter has 4 walls and a door. Different from most of them. Had dinner with two thru hikers and a father/daughter out for the night. Gonna be cold up here with clear skies. I am wrapped in my bag hoping for a good night.","Station19 hostel off RT 19E

The bag and liner are good but I need to address camp wear better. The down vest has worked ok but I wonder if a down jacket is a better way to go. I do regret forgetting to tell Eileen to throw in my base layer pants when she sent my boots. I think I would be a much warmer camper with them. I wanted to get over 17 miles today and rain is in the forecast for this afternoon. I was out by 7:15 which is my earliest start in ages. Still somewhat twilight when I left but I could see ok. I reached Ash Gap at 2.1 miles and met KJ. He was just breaking camp. Turns out he left a note for me in the shelter log but I didn't read the log last night. He said he felt so elated for yesterday that he didn't want to stop and besides he thought the shelter was dark and damp(which it was). He had a good camp site out of the wind and probably a little warmer than the shelter. I'm still glad I stayed there. It is the highest on the AT and besides I doubt if I'll ever be back to it. KJ was able to catch up to me at Hughes Gap and we ended up walking his last 5 miles on the trail together. We both enjoyed the company. He ended his section at Gressy Gap and I went on. As I said before he is a faster hiker than me but it worked well today since I was able to get 10 miles in by noon trying to stay with him. This worked well because by 2:00 it had started to drizzle but I had less than 3.5 miles to go. Got to the shelter by 4:00, only slightly wet and damp. Two other men near my age where already here. Soup and No Namey. We conversed for sometime. They have been hiking the AT for a week twice a year for 18 years. They figure they have over 1300 miles completed. They started in Northern VA and go both north and south. They are compete from this shelter to part way into the Whites. Pretty impressive how they have stuck with it. Glad I'm in a shelter tonight because it is pouring out there now. I'm going to see play it by ear tomorrow. I will try to wait out the rain which is supposed to clear out early morning. If I start later I'll just go to the next shelter. If it's clear when I get up I'll go for 17 miles and the town of Erwin. Depending on how long I hike tomorrow I'll either end at Sam's Gap or 13 miles shorter at Spivey Gap. Whatever doesn't get done this year will get done next year.

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624334,"It poured and poured last night. Tennessee shelters are constructed of cinder block walls and corrugated tin roofs. The rain beat a cacophony of notes on the tin while the winds blew its own melody through the trees. Decided to sleep in. It was dark by 7 last night and after writing my journal entry I was still settled in by 8. The other members of the shelter did not hang the food bag so I decided to keep my Ursack in the shelter also. The result was I slept very lightly since I was waiting for a bear to show up and ask what was for dinner. By around 7:30 I realized the rain had stopped and what I was listening to on the roof was left over drops from the trees. I rallied and packed up slowly. I still hadn't decided what I was going to do. I figured I would get to the next shelter and see what time it was.
On the trail around 8:45 and started up Unaka Mountain. I was starting with a 1500 foot climb. The trail was slick with wet leaves and rhododendron roots. This mountain was different from some of the other recent ones in that there are a lot of loose rock on the trail. All of these made for slow slogging on the trail. I was about 2/3 up the peak when my left foot caught the point of a stick lying in the trail. As I moved forward the stick caught in a root and I went down. Face-planted full force on the ground. I'm going down thinking oh no nothing to do but fall. Luckily and unluckily my chest landed first on a rock which kept my face from smashing hard. So no bloody face but I did bruise my chest and hurt my ribs. A few moments of body assessment and I realized I was pretty lucky. Only sore chest. I started hiking again. While it was not raining, nevertheless I was in the clouds and the mists were heavy, the winds were chilly and my glasses were fogging over. It would be like this for most of the day. On my way off Unaka Mountain, I decided I did not want to risk the 3500 foot climb out of Erwin over the next two days. My chest was hurting. I think my chest would hurt on every deep breath exerted in the climb up.
I called Marty in Asheville to see if he could pick me up today in Erwin. He very willing agreed to come get me. So my hike would end two days sooner than expected. I was disappointed but what I don't hike this year I will hike next year. It means 25 miles less now but when your hiking almost 2200 miles what does 25 more next year really matter. I'll play it safe for now. The conditions were still poor and I was trying to take my time while also hurrying since I now needed to make 17 miles after a late start. Because of the socked in weather there was not need to stop and take in the views but I was caught for a few moments when coming off Unaka, I found a pine tree decorated for Christmas. Here on a mountain miles from a road someone had lugged Christmas balls, tinsel, and colorful strands of rope. Again, I am amazed by what the trail shows. My chest hurting, my hike ending and a stranger found a way to make me smile. Just another reason why I hike. To be amazed by the thoughtfulness of my fellow man.
Walked for 14 miles through the mists and chill. Finally 3 miles from Erwin, I dropped below 2800 feet and was finally below the clouds. I could see the ceiling above me and I could see for a lot more than 20 yards around me. Crossed the Nolichucky river at 4:50pm. My section hike was over. My hiking for this season is most likely over. Now to assess and reassess my plans and equipment for next season.
Called Eileen and updated her. She is so important to my success. Damn I am a fortunate man to have her in my life.
Waited a few minutes for Marty to arrive and rode to Asheville. Marty drove with his window down the whole was because I did indeed personify ""hiker stench"".
Showered and had a great meal prepared by Kate, watched some of the Eagles poor showing and then off to sleep.","Cherry Gap Shelter

I am very lucky to have avoided a lot of the sorrows this virus and our government's response has caused.Moving on - I am excited to finally be able to get back out on the trail for a few days with my son, Ian, and his friend Melanie.

We started at the same place I had started last May but this time we are going north. I will hike north from now on.  Crossed the Schuylkill and had a quick uphill. Hot and sunny so as usual I was sweated through by part way up the climb. Easy travels once on top. Enjoyed getting to know Mel more and hearing about their students and classes and their plans.  Not much scenery today. Traveled the green tunnel mostly. Stopped for lunch by a stream. Saw some folks on the trail. Mostly day hikers and a three folks out for a couple days like us. Arrived at Windsor Furnace Shelter. There was 1 person there but he was just getting water and left soon after our arrival.

Great view to the south, east and northeast. In the distance you can make out the Lehigh Gap. We had lunch there and then continued on. For the next few miles the trail runs over old fire trails and is pretty easy for PA but by mid-afternoon we have crossed from the one ridge to the next ridge to the north. There the trail turned to is usual ornery PA rocky self. Only the second day and we were trying to get 16 miles in which normally is no biggie especially since it is a ridge walk without a lot of ups and downs but this is PA and the last 6 miles to the shelter was nothing but one long boulder/rock field. We spent a lot of out time hopping from one pointy stone to another. We finally reached the shelter beat and weary. There was one other hiker at the shelter. He said he was out for a few days but the next day we heard him tell a trail volunteer that he was out for a few weeks. No sure about the dude. When we walked down into the shelter initially, he talked about how he thought Covid was a real thing until he saw us. We on the other hand were quite sure Covid was a ""real thing."" We had been wearing masks whenever we passed anyone and were very careful what we touched.  Ian thought it would be a good idea if we avoided the shelter and picnic table and just set up down below the shelter.  I was so beat that I had some crackers and cheese and had no desire for cooking a dinner.

After we left the shelter the trail became a lot less rocky and we had good hiking along another fire road for a few miles but we knew there would be rocks soon. Today we were crossing the Knife's Edge in PA. This is a few hundred yard section of trail that literally cuts along the top of the ridge on an outcropping uplifted at a 60 degree angle. We stopped for lunch about a mile from the Knife's Edge and then made our way north. Knife's edge was challenging but no more so that Dragon's Tooth. We took our time and found a couple seats to enjoy the view to the south from the ridge. The trail stayed rocky until about a mile from the parking lot when it turned easy and we cruised to the car. 
While we were putting our stuff in the car, I saw a gentleman sitting under some shade by the edge of the parking lot. I went over and exchanged some greetings. He looked familiar but I wasn't sure. We talked for a few minutes. He told me he was waiting for a ride back to his car. He is working his way along the trail one day hike at a time. When we traded trail names, it was then that I remembered Tycoon. Here in front of me was the person who helped Mojo, Caboose, Wiseman and me last year when we were trying to figure out how to get to a campsite in central VA. How wonderful is this trail that you can rejoin with people hundreds of miles and months apart and what was so cool was that I was able to return the good turn which he had provided to us. We all had masks, we kept the windows down and we were able to offer him a ride back to his car so he didn't have to try and figure out a shuttle. The trail provided for us then and it provided for him now. 
After we dropped Tycoon at his car, Ian stopped by a gas station that sold six packs. Picked up some local beer - Yuengling - it is actually local since Pottsville is only 20 miles away from here.  Back at my truck and sipping a couple cold ones celebrating with Mel and Ian and a success three day hike.

The weather looks unsettled over the next few days with a high chance of rain on Sunday. But for now the start of the hike felt damp but no rain.

Trail was a mix of rocks and smooth areas. Walked a ridge so very few elevation changes. 
It really good to walk with someone to start. Spent time chatting about family and friends. No deep ponderings today not that I do that anyway. 
Made the shelter by mid afternoon and decided to stick to the plan. For awhile toyed with the idea of pushing on to Lehigh Gap sin e it is an exposed 1000' climb early tomorrow and there is rain likely but decided it is better to be rested and wet rather than tired and dry.

Rained over night and we woke to mist and a chilly air. On the trail by 8. We were planning on 10.6 today since we had to navigate Lehigh Gap. The climb out of the gap is tough. A 1000' in less than .75 mile. The rain was holding off as we started up but the mist and clouds hung over the summit. This climb is not only the steepest so far for me but the surface is scree and loose rocks. Also there are hardly any trees or shrubs to shelter you from the elements. As we climbed the mist became a rain and our footing became less sure. Steve questioned as he already had before ""why would someone put a trail here?"" A couple time it was throw the hiking poles up above us and push or pull each other up. After an hour we had reached to summit where there is a Superfund site. For the next couple miles the rains held off but finally it started and would continue steady the rest of the day
We hit our tent area by mid afternoon and decided to tack on another 6 miles so we could get to a shelter rather than pitch tents in the rain. And did I mention that the rocks on the trail were relentless? Got to the shelter by 6:30 tired and spent. There was a woman there, Kristina, a flip flopper out of Harper's Ferry.  Steve opened his pack and found that all his belongings were wet. His sleeping bag was dripping water. This was serious. I had an emergency blanket but that was it. Luckily Kristina offered her bag liner and she had a small blanket for her dog, Bobo. She said the dog could do without it for the night.

In the meantime I now have a new companion,Kristina, for the next day or so. Kristina has been counting on mail drops for resupply on his hike. Counting on the mail in times of DeJoy is playing roulette. The odds of a timely hit are stacked against you. Needless to say she spent a lot of time trying to find out where the undelivered packages were and how to bounce them to the Water Gap. Finally after a couple of hours she had worked it out and we were hiking out of Wind Gap to the trailhead. We had nine more miles. Over 6 of them were on constant rocks. I struggle to explain how tough walking on these rocks are. If you ever walked on cobblestones, then picture walking on them after an earthquake. All jumbled up and cast askew on every possible angle. Very tiring. Crossed over Wolf Rocks which is a mine Knife's Edge. These rocks are the extent of the last ice age in PA.

Turn my phone off airplane mode and saw a text from Kristina. She was letting me know a few hours earlier that there was no water and to stop at the spring.

I say friend but it's been a very long time since I have spoken to him. We were graduate students together in the early 1980s. I haven't seen him since 1988 but we did trade some emails a couple of years ago when I was prepping for the trail. Ian is a recently retired English Professor who has written some books on the trail and his advice then was very appreciated. I pulled into the parking lot wondering what would it be like. I was fairly confident that we would be relaxed with each other but there is still the question. Hiking several days with someone that is not compatible could be stressful.
We shook hands as Ian pointed out that was his first handshake in over a year. Covid has changed so much. At least both of us are vaccinated. We had a nine mile hike to Mohicon Outdoor Center where we were going to lay up there for the heavy rains due on Thursday. We spent the climb telling our histories and making sure Trump wasn't our idol. Comfort level 1 passed. He had brought a travel guitar which added weight for him but held out hope of tunes for me. Passed Sunfish Pond and had some lunch on the rocks by the water. Eileen would speak of this place as she came here camping many years ago. 
Hiked up to Racoon Ridge where there is a large rock cairn and a large natural bench. From there we had  great views both to the east and west. The Delaware River meandered in the distance and the Poconos rumbled off lowly to the horizon. The rain came as we made our way to Mohican Outdoor Center. It's run by the AMC. They provide hiker services as well as other outdoor activities. We had a cabin with electric so we were ritzing it up.
The sun appeared through the clouds after awhile, Ian unpacked his composite Martin and played some original songs and some obscure  folk pieces. Obscure for most but not me.

This was the same as yesterday when we only had rain for a little while in the afternoon. We had originally planned on spending another night here in the cabin because today was supposed to be a washout.  Now that the forecast had changed I preferred to hike. Ian came into the office and we discussed the situation. Checked with the staff and confirmed that the forecast had moderated. Ian said he did not want to set up or take down his tent in the rain. I pointed out it would make the next day easier. Instead of 14plus miles we could split it into 6 and 8plus.
Ian was leery but agreed. We were on the trail by 10am. The heavy cloud cover never lifted. By 2pm we were on a narrow ridge when the rain started. We had walked almost 6 miles and we in the area of the tent sites. We found a good spot on the west side of the ridge and began setting up camp...in a heavy cold rain, exactly what Ian was concerned about. Both of us and our tents were wet. As soon as we were able we got into our tents and began to sort out the mess. I changed into dry clothes and crawled into the sleeping bag which was a little damp. The wind was blowing, rains was pouring and the temperatures were dropping. Hypothermia was more than a tickle in the back of my mind. Not one of my better choices. Brought up the local radar and saw we were in the middle of a slow moving cell. We has at least another hour of this before we could access out situation. Finally around 4:30 the rain ended. We came out of the tents and decided we better heat our food while we had the chance. The wind was still strong and we set the stove in the lea of some rocks. As we ate the skies started to clear and the sun came out. We pulled out wet clothes out and hung them on some branches. We also pulled  off the flies to try and dry them  and the tents in the wind. Ian did advise me that we planned on 2 nights at Mohican center. I don't think I will hear the end of this for a long time.

The trail was pleasant with very few rocks for a few miles.  After about 3 miles the clouds moved back in and we put on out rain gear. Another day of off and on drizzles. Sometime after Crater Lake we stopped by a small stream for a break when I heard my name called. Crossing over the little bridge was Bobo and Kristina. She had pushed ahead at Mohican Center since she reached it too early in the day. She said she did 18 miles that day, but yesterday, Bobo saw a porcupine and chased it. He was majorly quilled. Kristina said he fainted after she pulled out 100 quills. She was forced to call 911 and a ranger took her and the dog to a vet where the vet removed 500 more quills. Poor pup. What a traumatic experience for both him and Kristina! But they were back on the trail at Blue Mountain Lake Road the next day albeit with antibiotics and this time the dog was tethered on a 6' leash to her. We talked for a few minutes and I reassured her that her bad karma must be now behind her after all the other stuff that had occurred. She left ahead of us on her was north. Kristina is a very quietly determined person.Ian and I finished out mileage and reached the shelter by mid afternoon.  Bear box and privy. Great shelter. No one was about so we decided to stay in the shelter that night. There were not many tents sites anyway. Hung out our still damp equipment for further drying but we had to pull some things under the shelter lea as more showers started.  We had a good evening. No one else came to the shelter. Ian pulled out his guitar and played some music. He is a really good guitarist with a deep repertoire of songs. He played some well crafted original pieces as well as some really good folk tunes. We had a good time with Spoon River. He was not familiar with Claudia Schmidt's version which is far more beautiful that anything we could approach. Around 6pm, I checked my phone and I had a text from Kristina. She had sprained her ankle just before her 300 mile mark. I asked her what she was going to do and she replied with ""Walk slowly?"" and sent a couple pics. The pics showed a ""see a doctor sprain "" and maybe even a broken ankle but certainly not a ""walk slowly"" sprain with a 40lb pack and a dog on meds. She regretted not walking with us the rest of the day. She is about 4 miles ahead of us and we won't be able to reach her until about 10am. Arranged to meet her as soon as we could and help her get to a road where she could arrange a ride.  It's inconceivable how bad her luck is. The harder she works the more bad mojo visits her. We had planned on a 12.5 mile hike tomorrow. Gonna be tough making that distance with helping her but whatever needs to be done we are committed to doing.Night is still cold so we huddled in our bags early and I read Murikami on the kindle prior to drifting off.","Stealth site at 1312.3

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635160,"While cooking last night, it seemed that my fuel canister was light. I put some water in my cup and placed the cannister in it and it seemed to float very high in the water which is an indication it is almost empty. I broke to news to Ian since we are sharing my stove. He had asked if that was ok before we even started since he was trying to adjust weight so he could carry the guitar. I assured him it was fine and I had plenty of fuel so no problem sharing the stove.  At this rate, I'm not sure if Ian will ever want to join me again - first I get him to walk and set up in a heavy rain when we could have stayed in a cabin and now I was denying him his morning coffee while we rationed the remaining fuel. There is a sports shop in Culver's Gap about 3.5 miles ahead before we would reach Kristina. I told him I would go there to get fuel if possible. I started out ahead of Ian and walked for a couple of miles by myself settling into what was my routine and what will again be my routine when I head to Springer. Passed a small vernal pool with a hemlock overhanging it that stopped me. The quiet serenity of these pools are mesmerizing. Reflected trees, dark waters, the stillness to the surface, the surrounding rocks, mosses and lichens silently beckon and remind me why I walk this trail. 
A little later the drizzle returns and Ian catches me shortly after I had put on my rain pants and stuffed my kilt into the backpack. At Culvers Gap, I head to the store which proved fruitless. I had a better chance of finding authentic 18th century black powder than a fuel cannister.  Caught up to Ian in a nearby parking lot where he told me he spoke to a couple hikers who saw Kristina by a road just up ahead. I checked my phone again and she had just texted that she was picked up by a hotel shuttle. She is off the trail and headed home. I feel so sorry for her. So many obstacles keep popping up for her until finally one popped up that she couldn't overcome. 
After leaving her we walked to Culver Fire Tower. We heard voices as we approached and found a Boy Scout troop out for an overnight. It's Saturday in early spring so pretty normal to see Scouts out doing their thing. Turns out to be 12 scouts and 3 leaders, all maskless. Can't really explain why it's ok to be in a group like this and think it is ok to be maskless. As any thru hiker would do, our first question to them was ""where you camping tonight?"" while silently praying it would be nowhere near where we were headed. Luckily, they were only going another two miles and we were going 8 more. Whew!  Still we would pass each other two more times before they turned onto the blue blaze to Gren Anderson Shelter.
Loaded up with water 1.6 miles before our shelter since where we were staying had no water. The day was turning milder and this would be our last night. The shelter is right on the trail and has a broad grassy area in front of it so tenting would be easy tonight. We set up. There was already 1 other tent set up and by the evening 4 other hikers showed up and all put up tents.  
Ian played his guitar again with some tunes that I did not know. It had been great hiking the last few days with him.  We talked a lot about his teaching at Penn State Altoona, my work and family and spent some time talking art and literature. Very pleasant ways to pass the time while hiking. I will miss these conversations when I go south.
Overall a good day except for the saddness of the end of Kristina's journey","Brink Road Shelter

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635161,"Ian spoke to some of other campers shortly after they arrived last night to see if we could use some of their fuel to heat our food. One of the guys loaned us his extra cannister. However, as it turned out my cannister had enough fuel to heat our water last night and even enough to heat water for coffee today so I had planned correctly(not really, just good luck). Much warmer night last night and the sun was breaking through clouds. There was a lot more blue sky that at any time since Ian and I had started in Delaware Water Gap. We had a rocky 5.4 mile hike out to the parking lot but we had plenty of time - 3 hours to get it done.  So glad to have these two states almost finished. This will give me 5 completed states with only 9 left to complete. Ian was concerned prior to the hike if he could still backpack like this. He had hiked over 1/2 of the AT in 1977 and over the next several years he completed the trail. Over the years he had revisited several sections when writing his book about the trail. He and his wife had even backpacked the International AT in Quebec, so he is very accomplished backpacker but it had been awhile since he hiked. I was really happy to hear him say that I gave inspired him enough to realize he could still do this. Maybe not at the 15 mile a day pace as in the past but at a new pace.  As with Ian, this last week has given me the strength to go on and travel to GA and start at Springer with a far greater expectation to finish.  But first there was a little matter of 1.8 miles to finish between the parking lot where I met Steve last Saturday and the parking lot where I parked my car in NJ to meet Ian.Liam and Allison picked us up at 11:30 and drove back to the Water Gap.  I bid farewell to Ian there, with the hopes of perhaps seeing him later this summer on the trail somewhere.  Liam and Allison drove me over the river and we had BBQ for lunch. I devoured brisket and pulled pork over a LaQuinitas. They drove me to the trail head in PA and I walked the last 1.8 over the I80 bridge to the NJ parking lot where my truck sat to take me home for a week before I head south.So that's all for a week.

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635609,"I had wanted to write an entry yesterday prior to getting on the trail today but I was too distracted. I vacillated between some unknown anxiety and excitement so finally I gave that up and watched an old movie at the hotel.
Maybe my distraction came when I boarded the Southwest flight and sat down in my seat and saw in the magazine holder that I was on a Boeing 737 Max 8. So either I was on the safest plane in the world or I might not land in Atlanta. Like the last few days, all I could do was go forward. Landed in heavy rains and made my way north via light rail and uber to the hotel where Survivor Dave, the shuttle driver, would pick me up on Sunday. The day gradually cleared and the forecast for this week is good. Dave arrived early and by 7am I was heading farther north to Springer. After 25 miles of paved roadway and 6 miles of unpaved, rough, potholed steep road he delivered us- there were 3 other folks- to the parking lot a mile from the peak of Springer. The parking lot was on the north side so my first mile today did not count as I would walk up to the 0 mile and then back down. But damm, here I am walking up Springer finally. Its Sunday and the top is crowded with day hikers. Took the obligatory pics by the markers and turned my feet to north. The overcast sky was lifting and the sun was finding it's way down through the trees to dapple the footpath. In the higher elevations,  the trees have not leafed out yet but down in the valleys, the green tunnel was in fresh bloom. I could not have wished for a better start to this walk. Within a few minutes, I knew this is what I wanted to do. The anxiety of yesterday was gone. I do feel confident that I can complete this hike if I remain humble and aware of myself and my surroundings. The trail can humble someone in an instant. The trail here is very different from PA and NJ. Rocks are a rarity. The trail soil can be dark from the decaying understory and pine needles or it can be a light clay with some sand mixed in. There is mica in the stone here and the bright flecks reflect the sun as one walks. Voilets and other delicate flowers border the trails and small stream percolate beside the trail. Saw a lot of people but many were day hikers. I had determined to stay at Hawk Mountain Shelter even though I reached here by 2:30. It a beautiful double decker shelter with plenty of tent spaces. Set up the tent and watched as about 20 other hikers arrived as the evening came on. I will probably lose most of these folks tomorrow as I shoot for 15 miles tomorrow.
Such a great start. Looking forward to many more good days.","Springer Mountain

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635755,"Some of the hikers built a fire last night in front of the shelter. Their muffled voices provided the white noise that pulled me to sleep. I got up in the middle of the night and stepped out of the tent. Full moon or close to it. The trees cast shadows across the nearby tents and the air was still and silent. This is not something that I ever focus on back home. Living on the trail nature is so immediate and intense. I could almost feel the moonlight on my skin. I woke a little later than I wanted but was still on the trail by 7:30. I was looking for almost 16 miles today. I had a short downhill from the shelter to Hightower Gap then a couple bumps until I reached Horse Gap where the climb up Justus Mountain begins. This is the first big climb for a Nobo hiker. I was about halfway up when I came to a large patch of red Columbine. Large sections of the trail here in GA are bordered by spring flowers.  Just a delight to walk through. I am so impressed with the trail here. Very few rocky sections, a lot of long slow ascents and descents, lot of streams crisscrossing the trail, and all those wildflowers. I don't want to mislead, there are some very difficult and steep sections but they are don't seem to occur as often as other states. I guess I am loving the one I'm with right now since I am loving this section.
Was passed by 3 of the hikers from last night. All three in their late 20s or early 30s. Two of them are out for 6 days and are trying to do 90 miles. I don't think I will see them again. The other man is Cavin. He quit his job in the environmental industry and is thru hiking. Talked to him for awhile and then camped beside him tonight. He will probably lose me tomorrow since he walks so much faster.
In the afternoon, I met All In. A section hiker who turns out to live in Wind Gap, PA. He was a little surprised when I told him I had just hiked through Wind Gap less than two weeks ago. He is a retired school teacher who was looking for something to do rather than just veg when he stopped working. He hit on the AT and has been hiking for a few years. He is about to complete 1000 miles and is now 70yrs old. Guess I'm not the oldest person out here this year. Gives me hope that more people will find that despite ones age, there is no reason not to continue to challenge oneself and seek higher goals. Good day today. Met some folks, saw a lot of nature's beauty and got a pretty good work out in. Tomorrow is mountains for breakfast as I start climbing Blood Mountain within the first mile or so.

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635833,"I had an absolutely great day today. Got out of camp a little earlier than yesterday. I had some concern about getting up Blood Mountain. It's elevation is 4442 so the first 4000 footer on this leg of my journey. Starting elevation  was 2871 so almost 1600' ascent. As I was climbing out of the campsite I saw a white flower with yellow center on a 1 foot stalk with three leaves. The flower was about 2 inches in diameter. Very pretty as a single flower but a few steps later the single flower became a carpet of thousands that rose up the mountain side for a hundred yards. Stunning and a beautiful start. Popeye and Cavin, fellow campers from last night passed me as I started up Blood Mountain. Just behind them came 6 college students with a counselor who are out for a few days doing a section. Turns out they a FSU students. As my son would say, Go Noles.
 Getting to the top was much easier than I expected. I didn't have to take any breathers. At the summit is a 4 sided stone shelter. Met Popeye and  Cavin on some ledges near the top and soaked in the sun. After they left, I walked down with KitKat. She is finishing a thru hike she started on June 16th last year however she is dealing with a knee injury that could endanger her hike. Came down to Neel's Gap where there is a large outfitter right on the trail. Literally the trail goes through a breezeway in the building. This is where a boot tree is.  A large number of hikers realize after day 3 or 4 that this project is not for them and they abandon the hike. A lot of them toss their boots into well branched tree in front of the building. Wish there was a way to retrieve them since I saw some that were a lot nicer than what I was wearing.
Ate 3/4 of a large pizza, had a soda and charged my phone while sitting on a stone patio with views to the east past the piedmont.
Feeling full started northward. Thought I would do 4 more and camp but got to that spot by 3pm and decided to push for another 2.6. So glad I did because I met some women on the way who told me there was a trail angel giving out food and drink in Tesnatee Gap. That was 1/2 mile away and it already 4. Hustled as well as I could down the steep decline. They were just packing up when I arrived. Stocked up on some more drinks,chips and cookies. This went well with the left over pizza for dinner. My first trail magic. So cool. And right before I got to them, I saw a small 8 or 9 inch copperhead scurrying away from me. Definitely my lucky day. Arrived at my camp site by 5 and settled down. The FSU students are here also but I have been left behind by Popeye and Cavin. As I went to get water, I saw a stunningly bright Luna Moth hanging on a tree. What a way to cap a day.

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/635905,"Today was overcast for the cloudy for the most part. Got out around 7:30 which is pretty much my start time so far on this section. I had planned on Blue Mountain shelter which was 11.7 miles but quickly realized I would be there around 2 PM which is too early to stop. Checked Guthooks and saw there is a camp site on the very top of Rocky Mountain so decided to head there.  Stopped at Low Gap to get water and use the privy, which brings us to the matter at hand for today's entry. The AT is a narrow, rocky, tree root filled footpath for most of it's entire length however many of the privies have a ramp from the trail to the door. The ramp is wide enough to accommodate a wheelchair. Once inside you will find two grab bars placed as they should be in any public loo in the country. So my question, beside normal government cros the Ts and dot the Is, is why are privies on the trail ADA compliant?  Certainly nothing else about the trail is. Ok, just something to ponder.
No views today until the very end from the summit of Rocky. Pleasant walk for the most part except the climb up Blue Mountain and back down was loaded with rocks. DejaVu all over again to PA. Except this time they only lasted for 2 or 3 miles. Made the final 1000 foot climb out of Unicoi Gap to Rocky Mountain summit. Found a beautiful campsite at 3993'.

Sleep in a little because I was only going to Deep Gap shelter. 11.7 miles so I didn't think it would take too long. I had a steep descent to Indian Grave Gap which is named for an Native American grave cairn nearby but I could not find the cairn.  I started up Tray Mountain, my 2nd 4000'. On the peak it was windy and cold with limited views to the southeast. Left the peak after talking to Eileen for a few minutes. What was so cool about creasting Tray Mountain was I have now walked more than half the AT. I reached 1100 miles on that peak. It is a cool hump to cross and makes me feel more than ever that I can do this. I had looked over Guthooks briefly and thought the next 6 miles were pretty level...wrong. Instead there was a whole series of Puds. Pointless ups and downs. These went on for over three miles.  When all was finished I had ascended over 2500' and descended about the same with no views. I also hadn't realized last night that there was another 4000' today, Kelly Knob. Why Kelly couldn't be called a Mountain,  I don't know. Before I climbed up Kelly, I had lunch and took a brief nap. My legs are a little weary and I am glad of the shorter day and the Nero for tomorrow. I passed several groups of hikers today, some section hikers and some thru hikers. I think I will continue to catch up to thru hikers for now since I have more leg than they do but the time will come soon the the younger ones I passed today will pass me in a couple weeks when they get their legs. Unless I find an older group I think  I will be walking solo for awhile. Shelter is crowded tonight with a lot of folks planning on only going the 3.5 miles to US76 which is the road to Hiawasee.

The rain finally came to this part of Georgia last night for about an hour and a half. Not bad, I stayed dry and by morning the sky was clearing. But today was about shapes, patterns, colors and the search for the sublime. As I walked down the trail today, the sun came out and the trail started to dry. I walked into a rhododendron tunnel and was brought up short. The shrubs grow to 20 feet or so it seems. I was struck by the sinewy limbs curving and undulating, rising upward. I thought of sea kelp swaying in the ocean currents or maybe the character in Edvard Munch's The Scream, how he undulates in a sea of reds. Later a drop of rain balanced on an unfurling fern frond the slowly gliding down the stem before seeping into the dark earth. The trail is full of mica or similar material that reflects the sun like millions and millions of tiny silver coated mirrors strewn on the ground. The browns of the trail turn glistening under my feet. I am awed by the immediacy of nature living in it every day. There is a beauty that goes beyond beauty. I think of the Impressionists, the blocks of color in Cezanne's landscapes in the just leafing out trees or the pointillism of Seurat called to mind in the myriad lichens on the trees and rocks. Even the vast landscape painting of the great western artists. But these artists painted the large, the macro but I am in the micro. My vision is so drilled down to the single frond, the   fragile bluet, the curve of the trail through a cleaved boulder. As beautiful as the vast is, this tiny bubble of my world is sublime. A beauty and a darkness,the single drop captured the sun and is gone into the black earth of Georgia.  Emotions become more primal. Needs more basic. Thoughts more singular.  I will return to this again, perhaps with better clarity.","Deep Gap Shelter

 Got in two showers, three hot meals, including a blackened Mountain trout served of steamed bok choy in a miso sauce with grilled asparagus and a side salad. Turns out the chef was a NOLA trained chef transplanted to podunk town Georgia. Found a small brewery a couple blocks from the inn and had a couple drafts with Derek from TX who is also thru hiking. Saw myself in a mirror for the first time in a week. Not too grizzled yet but working in it. On the trail by 9:15. Major climbing today as I came out of the gap and headed for the much higher mountains of North Carolina. But first I had to cross the GA/NC border, which I did at mile 8. Another state in my rear view. Before I reached that point, Derek and Breezy caught up to me. They are shooting for 15 miles today. I am doing less than 12. Breezy is a young woman who has the perfect trail name. Her whole self, mind, body and heart, all seem breezy. It was very enjoyable to walk a few hours with the two of them.

A group of us from the shelter walked up a few hundred yards and sat on the edge of the ridge to watch the sun through layers of clouds. The clouds that will bring in the change of weather.  I looked at AT weather app and the next couple of days forecast is for pretty severe storms. Headed out of the shelter by 8 with the intention of going 12 miles to Carter Gap Shelter. Walked with another hiker,  Hopper for awhile. Her girlfriend is a meteorologist and has kept him informed of the coming storm. Passed Breezy and North at 10am. They were just breaking camp. I had an easy climb up Standing Indian Mountain. Reached the summit by 11 and planned on hanging for awhile. Turtle Power joined me at the top and we talked for a few minutes. He has been walking with Hopper for the last couple days. He said they were thinking about going to Franklin to wait out the storm. That would mean 18 miles to get to a gap in order to get a shuttle. Started to think about getting off the trail for a day or so. Hiked the next 6 miles to Carter Gap in just over 2 hours. The trail was very favorable. Met up with Hopper and Turtle Power. Updated weather report shows heavy storms coming in tonight for the next two days. Called a hostel and set up a room. Along with Hopper and Turtle Power decided to go another 4 miles so we would only have an 8 mile hike to Rock Gap. Disappointing to get off again after only two nights but walking over Balds in lightning is not the smartest idea.
Reached Betty Creek campsite and found a nice niche spot under some rhododendron. A little later Zero and Winnie rolled in. Zero has hiked parts of the trail before and is trying a thru hike now. His battery was almost dead so I offered him use of my battery pack. As a barter he offered to make a smores. So here I am in the middle of nowhere and Zero builds a fire and makes smores for us.

This is the first time that the tent failed me in any way. Checked the exterior before taking the fly down and saw that I probably could have pulled the fly tighter in that corner. I will be more aware next time I set up. Broke everything down in the rain. Tried to keep most things dry but I realized I need another dry sack for my clothes. The bag I have is not waterproof and some of my clothes were damp. Packed the wet tent. Hopefully I will be able to dry it at the hostel. Left camp before Turtle and Hopper, knowing that they would catch me. We had a very steep climb, almost technical climb up Albert Mountain today. The last 400' elevation occurs in about .3 miles. So quite the workout in the rain. The guys passed me before I reached the steep part. Took my time and with several breathers, I summited Albert. On top is a steel fire tower. Etched into the metal staircase is the 100 mile marker. So yeah celebrated this milestone.
Caught up with the guys and we tore ass for the next few miles since it was cold, windy and rainy. Reached a shelter and took a break. Ran into North and Breezy. They had no intention of getting off the trail today. They are continuing on. We bid them farewell and safe journeys and headed for Rock Gap where a municipal bus stops at 12:45. We were coming down the trail about a 100 yards from the parking lot when we heard the back up warning sound on the bus and then saw it pull away. Hopper checked his watch. It was 12:28. So much for the laid back attitude of Southerners. At least the rain had stopped but the wind and cold hadn't abated. Put on our dryer, warmer clothes. Turtle called Zen, the hostel owner, who told us he could get us soon. Zen arrived and the name seems more than a little ironic. He was visibly stressed and gave us different info about the rooms than we were led to believe. He got on the phone to work out details while we mumbled our concerns to ourselves. I guess he misheard what we were saying and told us we would have to find some other place. After a few whoas and hold ons we sorted things out. Zen then said how stressful it's been because so many hikers are trying to get off the trail today. Kiddo, another driver took us on an interesting drive in Zen's van down the mountain. The brake rotors must be almost cooked and everytime Kiddo applied the brakes the whole front end shook. We were glad to get to the hostel, however Hopper and Turtle were given the living room with a couch and fold out bed. Not quite the private room they had reserved.  I faired much better. I was given the Airbnb space which was in another house. It has a bedroom with king bed, refrigerator,  microwave,  and private bathroom.  I'm a happy camper.
The rain had lifted for the day and we went to the Lazy Hiker Brewery and had a massive burger and some very fine IPAs. As the evening moved along more and more hikers came in until at one point I counted over 18 folks hanging around in one large group telling their stories. This was a great way to end a trying day.

This is one of the mountains on the trail that you can drive up to. At the summit is a squat two story observation tower. Made of brown stone and a pyramid roof, it looks like a small castle. We had waited long enough into the afternoon that the skies had cleared and we enjoyed the best views on the hike to date.  The sun was bright, clouds were rushing by and the views to the east are the best we have seen so far. What a great way to restart the hike after spinning my wheels in Franklin. Walk less than a mile down to Wayah Shelter and found a couple  of nice tent spots near the shelter. Hopper texted that he had gone another 4 miles to the next shelter so he is off and running. Another day or so with Turtle and I'll be on my own again.","Rock Gap

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636682,"Another day of ups and downs. Turtle and I broke camp before 8 and had a good run to begin then began to climb up to Rocky Bald. I slowed down on the steep uphill and Turtle was soon gone from sight. While I can slowly improve my leg strength, my cardio and lung powers are what they are. I find them very difficult to improve so as a result if have to take my time  on steep hills. Take deep breaths,  smaller steps and  just plod along. Let my mind wander a little and let the earworms of old songs run around like a pin ball in my head. Got to the top of Rocky Bald, which is a .1 side trail and had another great view. Then another long downhill to Tellico Gap befor the 900' climb up the Wesser Bald. On top of Wesser is another observation tower. But this time made out of steel with steep rickety wooden treads the lead to and open deck covered in pressure treated wood that appears to be a few years past its lifespan. As my family knows, I am no one for heights unless I am on terra firma, nor am I one for amusement rides. So here I am now on top of the open platform which shudders whenever someone walks down the steps, enjoying a great 360 degree view, waiting for my life to end when the tower collapses merely because I stepped on it at the wrong moment. Called Eileen from the top and told her where I was. She laughed and asked how was I going to get down. Probably walk down backwards so I wouldn't have to look out. But I was able to get down by looking directly down at the worn loose treads. Made our was down the steepest down yet. Down 2500' in about 5 miles. Got to the shelter and set up beside a small creek in a really nice area. Laid out plans for the next couple of days. I should be in the Smokies by Monday morning.","Wayah Shelter

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636683,"Sooo, last night was fairly interesting.  I settled down by 9:30 after finishing my journal entry and was asleep pretty quickly. My sleep was shattered around midnight by a plane's roar as it flew what seemed to be only inches above my head. I thought for sure I would see the flash of the explosion as it crashed into the mountainside. But no crash, just silence after the engine noise faded away. The next day I realized that Ft Bragg, home of the 82nd Airborne is in Fayette,NC. Probably some kind of night maneuvers over the mountains but my God that was scary. Finally fell back to sleep until 3:15 when headlamps started to glow from up the trail. Several people were still hiking down from Wesser Bald. Bad enough with the lights shining in my tent but they decided to stop and discuss the need to get water before moving on...directly at my tent. Sheesh. Finally they too faded in the distance and I went back to sleep. Got up, broke camp and hiked to the Nantahala Outdoor Center, NOC. It's a premiere whitewater rafting place that has a couple restaurants and a general store for minor resupply. This is where Turtle was meeting his girlfriend. We figured that we could grab breakfast before I headed north. Got to NOC at 8:15. Restaurant doesn't open til 11 and store opened at 9. BS'd with some of the hikers and found out from Tray, that 6 of them were watching the stars from the Wesser Bald platform where I guess they intended to stay the night, which would have been very cool, except they heard thunder and decided to head down. Not their smartest idea since the down is very steep and rocky. I believe some smokeables were involved in their decision. Bid farewell to Turtle with plans to meet up before I get off in Erwin. If he puts in some big days there is a chance to meet up again.
Started up the 8.5 mile ascent to Cheoah Bald. The actual elevation difference between NOC and the bald is 3326, but when take in the minor descents and ascents the elevation change is 4406. That's a lot of climbing. I took almost 6.5 hours to get to the top. Had a great view and ran into Kitkat on the top. She is the person I walked down Blood Mountain with almost 2 weeks ago. I also walked off and on with Double Vision today. He is 67, retired and trying to finish the AT after starting in 2019. Sound familiar?  Reached Locust Grove Gap awhile after Double Vision. He and another guy were setting up on the left of the trail on a slope. To the right, was a guy sitting against a log with his arms folded. I looked at him and he said the level and flat spots in front of him were saved for some of his tramily who were still coming from another shelter. Well, this was a new situation: calling saves on tenting spots. Walked over to Double Vision and the other guy who is Mike. Mike said the guy told him he suffered from PTSD. So I thought better of questioning him on the save call. Set up my tent on a slope and then went over and talked for awhile with Eyeore. He was an army medic for 23yrs. Did a tour in Irag in 1991 and the 4 more tours in the present Iraq/Afghanistan war. He told me he had walked from Florida to California and did some of the PCT and was now hiking the AT and looking after some young hikers who did know what they were doing. I got the feeling he is trying to hike out the memories or at least make sense of them while at the same time still being a medic and helping out hikers. He likes the name Eyeore since AAMilne suffered from PTSD. Pretty eventful day on the trail.","Rufus Morgan Shelter

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636730,"It was cold last night. Again. I have been very surprised by the temperatures down here since I have been hiking. I think there was one day in the mid 70s but most days have been cool and the nights almost cold. Great for hiking, not so great for sleeping. Last night it went down to low 40s or maybe even less. My bag is rated 12 degrees but I don't know what scale they use. Its certainly not Fahrenheit. And since I had set up on a slope, an overall uncomfortable night. Today was one of the easiest since the first couple of days. There was one climb but then just a series of small hills and long flats. Passed and was passed by Double Vision and Mike but didn't see a lot of other hikers. Only one view today of a lake but nothing special. Arrived at camp by 4 which is early but it sets up an easy day for tomorrow. At the shelter was a young man, Ardoo, who was hanging out at the shelter waiting for the arrival of Eyeore and his entourage. Eyeore has quite the influence on this small group. Don't think going 5 miles a day will cut it though. Later Zero showed up and told me that Eyeore and his group were smoking and drinking late last night and had not yet broken camp when he left near 10. Tonight is much warmer and the three of us set up down in a small protected valley with a stream nearby. I hope for a better sleep tonight.","Locust Gap Shelter

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636731,"Today is Mother's Day. I miss Eileen. I am so happy that I can do this hike but the strings pulling me home are strong. I miss our morning walks together and dissecting a Sixers game. I think this is probably the hardest thing I have ever done. This is arduous on the body every single day. But it is one of the most rewarding things in my life. Comes in third to being married to a woman whom I really care for and being father to two wonderful young men. 
Short walk out today to the visitors center on Fontana Dam. The dam is the southern gateway to the Smokies. I am doing a nero today and staying at the Hike Inn,a small place that only rents to hikers. Today is also Sunday and while hiking down into the valley, I passed through sections of the trail that are very narrow with the mountain rising to my left and the valley falling away to the left. Various spring flowers sprinkle white, pale lavender, deep maroons, and baby blues on the light green of fresh ferns and the richer greens of many unknown species of ground cover. The mosses drip water that seeps from cracks on the boulders and the grey green lichens quiver in the soft breeze. The aroma of the rich dark damp earth of the trail blends with the faint pine scent of fallen needles as the air warms around me from the sun darting in through the tulip poplar leaves. This is to me a better cathedral to a supreme being than any man made edifice. If one believes in God, then he or she has done marvelous work here and if it is just a random collision of atoms over trillions of years then it is a pretty remarkable outcome of chaos. Whatever the belief, I return again to my thoughts of last week and the sublime. These quiet moments in the early morning in these woods are so life affirming.","Cable Gap

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636768,"I had a restless night and slept fitfully. I think it was some anxiety with entering the Smokies. It also rained hard at times overnight. A combination of questioning am I making the right call to hike today in rain and the weirdness of the Smokies. Most hikers I have talked to just want to get through these 72 miles. Not as much excitement at seeing the sights but rather this is a long chore that needs to  be finished. Some of this feeling comes from the restrictions placed on thru hikers by the Park Service. It is the only park that dies not allow dispersed camping. You are required to camp at shelters. Before covid you could not even set up a tent. You had to stay in the shelter. This was rather farcical since the shelters can be reserved by over night hikers, so if the shelter is full of thru hikers and these folks with reservations show up at dusk, then the thru hikers need to leave the shelter and set up a tent. I'm sure having hikers stay only at shelters is done to control humans impact on the environment, it leads to bears knowing exactly where to go to find food. Shelters full of neophyte campers leads to poor food handling which leads to bears in the camp.
So basically,  I just want to get to see some sights and get north out of here. And finally,  they are called the Smokies for a reason. Today I hiked in clouds all day and didn't see anything farther than a hundred yards away until the sun broke through for a hour. The rest of the week calls for fog and 20% to 40% chance of showers. All that aside, I had a great day hiking. I felt strong. I powered up some hills and felt like i had a couple more miles in me when I stopped. It helped that I met up with Bourbon Bob and Abby shortly after I reached my first summit.  I have run into both of them off and on for the last week or so and they are good folk.  We three set up our tents next to each other tonight. I will probably camp with them for another night or so. Maybe a little sun tomorrow. Hoping for a vista.","Fontana Dam

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636910,"I woke to no rain and no bears so it was a pretty good night. My right Achilles tendon was sore this morning and it took a few miles to loosen it up. The soreness is the  first health issue I've had on the trail so far. It's not from an injury like a twisted ankle or anything, just sore from the constant pressure my joints, tendons and ligaments are under. Just need to care for it when I can and get through the next 165 miles to Erwin. Of more concern is my tent. After I set up on a slope the other night, I was getting out of my tent the next morning and stumbled a little. I reached back to catch myself and caught the top of the tent. Didn't think anything of it until I took the tent own and saw I had damaged the one pole.  I fixed it with duck tape...of course I fixed it with duck tape, what else is there. The tape held for a couple nights but today it needed something stronger to hold it together. I have some wire with me that might work.
Today was finally sunny and a little milder. Started out hiking a few easy miles and then climbed Rocky Top. Yes, the one the song is about. Had my first great vista from the summit, which is indeed very rocky. I was above the clouds with Clingman's Dome off in the distance. Sat there awhile and Bob and Abby joined me. They are thinking of pushing big miles today so I won't be camping with them again. The climb down from Rocky Top was very difficult for several miles. There was a lot of slate shards in the trail that made for treacherous footing and slow going.
Caught up to Bob and Abby at Derrick Knob shelter for lunch. They are going to push over Clingman's today since rain is coming in tonight. I cant do that so I will stick to my original plan of Silar's Bald shelter. Arrived at the shelter around 5:30. Decided to stop. There are only a couple hikers here so I will stay in the shelter. That way I don't have to break down the tent in the rain and I can keep all my stuff dry...at least to start the day. The weather improves after tomorrow. Met a hiker here who has a stent to repair my pole. Traded some cheese and crackers for the stent. Looks like it will work though I will probably stay in shelters until I'm out of the Smokies.

It was still raining hard at 6 so I just lay in my bag in the shelter trying to energize myself for the day. Finally a little after 7 I decided I had to get started. I had over 15 miles today and that included summiting Clingman's Dome. The highest peak on the AT. Crawled out of my bag to find the rain slowing down. By the time I was ready to hike it had almost stopped but the fog and heavy clouds still hung low. The climb up Clingman's was tough. A lot of elevation over a rock strewn trail. The rock were wet and slippery and what wasn't rocky was mud. The forest changed also. I went from a mixed hardwood forest to a pine forest where only occasionally did a deciduous tree cast out it limbs willy nilly seeking the sun through the pines. The trail wound upward through thick carpets of moss that covered the decaying fallen pines. Between the thickness of the forest and the heavy mist it was difficult to see more than a few yards to either side. I had a sense of being in Pangborn forest waiting for Treebeard to speak. Reached the summit of Clingman's and still no lifting of the sky so I walked on. The downslope was just as slow going. Now I was working hard to go up but I was struggling to go down without falling. I was almost successful too until I stepped a large tilted rock and down I went. Luckily I landed on my backpack so no harm. I took my about 4.5 hours to go the 6 miles to Mt. Collins shelter. I was beginning to doubt myself about getting in 15 miles today. Then the trail changed. The downs became less steep and less rocky and I picked up my pace. Some with the ups. I felt more energized.
I had one big climb left to the shelter and I went it it better that any other climb today. Reached Icewater Spring shelter almost an hour before I thought I would. This is a great place. Almost 6000' up. It will be cold tonight. In the 30s but just before sunset, the clouds cleared and we had a beautiful view from the shelter out at the surrounding mountains.

I was warm last night, dressed in socks, base layer,  two shirt, a buff, beanie and gloves. Today was my shortest mileage day in the Smokies. Just 12.6 with less elevation changes than the last three days. Great day for hiking. After only a mile on the trail, I came to Charlie's Bunion. A craggy outcrop with majestic views to the west all the way to Gatlinburg. Sat awhile and snacked. The trail was a lot of ridge running today which was a relief to my sore joints. Lots of views to both east and west. Talked to Eileen around noon and she reminded me of the pipeline issues and the hassle getting gas in NC. Ran into a ridge runner later and she told me gas prices are as high as $5 a gallon and some stations don't even have fuel. This is a concern since I am hoping to get a shuttle 20 miles to Newport so I can resupply and stay in a hotel. If I cant set that up, my other option is to stay at Standing Bear Hostel. This is definitely a young person's hostel with a party reputation. I really am not feeling that vibe right now. One of the other thruhikers, Miles, is going to Stanging Bear for a resupply and then going on a couple miles to camp. I may do that also since I can reach Hot Springs in just two more days and do a zero there but that would make tomorrow almost a 20 mile day though most of it would be downhill.

Started early with a 500 foot climb but then it was mostly downhill. Had a series of views along the way. Near lunchtime, I came to a rock outcropping with wonderful views to the east. Took a long break there. Then came miles and miles of downhill as I went from 5889' elevation to 1837'.  I did surprisingly well until I crossed Davenport Gap. Then I had to climb again for awhile. When I was about 2 miles from the hostel, i crossed I40 and suddenly there was an old stone staircase that went straight up. Are you kidding me?  16 miles into a hike and I have to climb Washington's monument? Well in truth, it wasn't that high but it sure seemed that way. Well, really it was only 30 or so steps but still, really, did i need this. Got to the hostel by 5 and turns out most of the folks staying were the ones I had walked with and only a few others. Standing Bear turned out to be a cool place to stay. They had a minor resupply store, hot showers and the host did a run into town for frozen pizzas which we heated up and devoured after dark. To while away the time to dinner, PBRs were for sale at $2 a can. So hikers were buying rounds and telling tall tales and explaining trail names. Schrodinger and I have the most obscure names.
Today I had my first 10 mile morning since I restarted. That's big because it means I will get in big miles for the day.

I also wasn't able to check out of the hostel til near 8 AM.  Excited for today. Doing  over 15 miles with a very big up but I will hit Max Patch today which is one of the iconic places on the trail. By the end of the day I will have less than 100 miles left for this section and less than 900 miles for the entire trail. Feeling pretty good about both those milestones. But first there was Snowbird Peak. The climb out of Standing Bear was hellacious. Over 2400' in 4.6 miles. The climb was just a steady uphill will few switchbacks and few flat runs. Took my time. In the middle, I called Iron Horse Inn in Hot Springs and got a room for two nights. I am looking forward to taking a zeroing In town. Got to the top of Snowbird Peak (someday I will figure out the difference between mountain,  peak, knob,hill and bald...but not today) and was greeted by a strange looking government or commercial installation. A large white circular structure out of Forbidden Planet. I should have taken a photo but I was afraid Robbie the Robot would come out and confiscate my phone. I will google it when I get home. A little further on from this structure, the peak is truly a bald with views all around. I met Edward there, a section hiker from last night and had lunch with him. We talked of Covid and hikers and vaccines. Bottom line is you need to be aware. I'm glad I am vaccinated.  Reached Max Patch in the late afternoon. This is truly one of the most spectacular views I have seen yet. You walk up about 200 feet above tree line to this grassy bald which seems to be about 10 to 15 acres across. You have 360degree views of the Smokies and the Pisgah mountains and other ridges. A lot of folks were going to camp on the top tonight since it is a beautiful day and evening. I spent almost an hour laying down with my head on my pack taking in the serenity. I knew I couldn't stay because I already had 18 miles set for tomorrow. Reluctantly, I headed down to my shelter 2 miles farther on. When I arrived I found Miles was with 8 women who were backpacking for the very first time. They were out with a woman guide who was teaching them the basics. This made for an enjoyable evening listening to their thoughts on the days events and setting up tents and prepping air mattresses and figuring out how to light a camp stove. Also in camp were a group of cub scouts but luckily they camped down a 100 yards below us.

Heading to Hot Springs, NC to an Inn with a bed, shower, hopefully good internet and a zero. I am looking forward to this zero since I have the time to take one and it's one that I am choosing to take. I need to let my body recoup some energy and eat right for a day.
Diet. I haven't talked much about what I eat but it's not great out here. I've probably lost 10 to 15 lbs since leaving Springer. In order to offset the amount of calories burned each day I need to eat almost 3500 to 4000 calories a day. On the trail it is just about impossible to eat that much and to eat healthy.  I have an energy bar to start the day and then a couple of nut or granola bars for snacks. A peanut butter and honey tortilla for lunch. Maybe some dried fruit  and some candy. At dinner either freeze dried package food or couscous with chicken bullion and a package of chicken. I talk all the time about feeding the furnace to keep going but it is difficult especially with the same diet day in and day out. Today I am low on food since it is my last day out. That's good in a way since my pack is lighter but bad because i will be eating the food i have buried in the bottom of my pack. The food that doesn't jump right out and say eat me. Since i started i have been eating a lot of nut filled snacks but by a couple days ago, my body said enough. I can't even imagine eating any more almonds or peanuts right now. I'm going on a granola binge. We'll see how long that lasts.
After a long day of mostly down, I reached Hot Springs by 4:30. I averaged 2 miles a hour today with stops so my time is improving.

Today is about diet and gluttony. Lots of choices. I started at the Smokey Mountain Diner. I had breakfast with Odie and Garfield.  They are headed back out today. They both are older guys but athletic and capable of 20 miles. I won't see them again.
But breakfast was 2 eggs, Virginia ham(which I learned is sweeter than country ham which is salty), hash browns and toast. After I left the diner, I stopped in the Hillbilly Market and Deli..yes that is the actual name...to check out resupply.  While there i grabbed some more decaf and two little debbie's chocolate cupcakes. I was almost satisfied with breakfast.  Did my resupply at the outfitters in town and Dollar General and the Hillbilly Market which was by far the best place to resupply. They had dried pineapples which I have been jonesing for and spearmint leaves which I'm a sucker for. Called the Hot Springs Spa to see if I could get a tub for a soak but they were all booked. It was now close enough to lunch. Ate at the bar in the inn. Treated myself to a healthy lunch. Grilled chicken Caesars salad and a nice local lager. Checked my phone and turns out the spa called back and had an opening. Scheduled an hour long hot tub in mineral springs for 3pm. On the way to the spa saw two women with ice cream cones. They got them right beside the hotel. Walked into the boutique type store and on one side there is an  ice cream counter. I chose peanut butter chocolate chip and salted caramel in a waffle cone. The barista approved of my choice and she even improved it by sandwiching the salted caramel between partial scopes of the peanut butter chocolate. I ate that on the way to the spa. I forgot to mention that I had two beers and a bag of cheddar goldfish with me for the spa. Took time in the morning to download Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and Moby Dick to the kindle. I spent a quiet hour in the spa soaking my aching body parts. Each tub area is enclosed on 3 sides with the 4th side open to the woods and a small stream. Very peaceful. Great was to decompress. Got back to the Inn and texted Miles and set up dinner for 6:30. Slipped in a nap
 Met Miles and Becca for dinner and back to the room to work on my journal
 Oh look, I still had some goldfish left. Polished them off. After three weeks and 250 miles, a hiker's thoughts turns a lot to food. Though I had some other thoughts which I'll address later. I guess it's not really gluttony, it really is hunger. Standing drying myself after my shower, I realize I have gone through most of my own body fat.

So I was sitting with my Hillbilly Market Decaf, two blueberry muffins and one of those mini peach pies. You know the one that has the sugar glaze icing and is super sweet. I was on a chair in front of the store where I got the ice cream cone, thinking about the last day or so. When I came into town, about the first thing I saw was the sign telling how Cecil Sharp had collected mountain ballads from Jane Gentry. This made me think of the Scot and Scotch Irish who settled these parts in the 18th and early 19th centuries. How they brought to these mountains and hollers a distinct culture and how this culture endured in tact for centuries probably until the coming of the TVA and radio and maybe not even then, possibly it was television that started to erode this culture. We talk of diversity as a panacea, something we should all strive to create and embrace but with that comes a loss. Granted much of what is lost should be lost, bigotry, misogyny, various phobias but sometimes things are lost that lessens us as humans. This town of Hot Springs at one time had homegrown music steeped deeply in the culture of these hills. In the verdant greens, the dark soils, the windy peaks the music mixed with memories of ancestors from the British Isles and that seems to be gone now. When I chose my ice cream cone yesterday, I heard a lovely voice, a woman was singing probably on Spotify. When I asked my server who it was she told me it was the lead singer from Thievery Corporation. Now as I sit in my chair I look into the store and I see an old John Hartford album sitting on a chair being used as an ambience prop. I think of Dolly Parton who grew up in the hills near here. Then I think of all the hikers who bring their world view into this town. I think of the waitresses from last night who were all dressed like misplaced hippies from New York and this all makes me think of entropy. A gradual dissolution into diversity. A blending of the world into Main Street, Hot Springs. A town without a traffic light.It is good or bad or it is just what is. But I wished I would have heard Dolly or Maybelle Carter or Hazel Dickens yesterday instead of the lead singer from Thievery Corporation. A blue panel truck crosses the railroad tracks in front of me. The Amazon truck seemed just a little incongruous but certainly not unexpected.","Hot Springs, NC

Jive Turkey came in near dark with a few other folks and then some more came in after dark.  It seems that I am catching up on some slower moving hikers and some faster hikers are catching up to me. For me though all this is winding down. Today, I passed 300 miles since leaving Springer. I only have 42 miles from this shelter so I am not all the enamored with meeting new people. I even was a little surly with a guy last night but he was busy talking voter fraud to Edward who turns put to have been a political reporter. Really, 6 months after the election and a thousand miles out of my mind, I need to hear this? I need to let that stuff go. Besides, this voter fraud guy, I talked to a couple times today and he is ok. He's 74 years old and this is his 3rd thru hike. The trail today as a piece of cake for the most part. I had one really big climb but it was up to the amazing peak called Big Firescald Knob. It is a very narrow rocky ridge. The trail wound up,over,around and seemingly through boulders and rhododendrons. It was created by a man named Howard who spent years working with a team of volunteers to create a 1.4 mile section over this knob. The result is an amazing view in all directions.  You can sit at the top and see for miles to the west and to the east. It's is rare to get this type of view. Often a vista is only in one direction.
Arrived at Jerry's Cabin Shelter. I found no cabin nor Jerry but there is a slew of people here. I found a small flat spot for my tent not too far from the shelter but the trail is lined with tents for almost 200 yards north. The shelter will be full tonight and there must but 20 tents. Quite the mini-bubble. I'll be glad to be done this section. It now seems crowded. I would definitely been whining if I came out in the middle of the bubble","Spring Mountain Shelter

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637699,"Another bright sunny morning. The days ar e getting warmer. I guess a combination of lower elevation and a warm front moving into the area. Regardless of the cause, at least now I do not need to sleep with the base layer, gloves and beanie on. First climb of the morning was up Big Butt. Who named these places anyway? Some farmer down in a valley looked up one day and said ""Wow, that mountain looks just like a big butt.""  Near the top there is a trail: the Big Butt Bypass. Now who in the right mind would bypass a big butt? Of course I had to walk over it. Got to the peak and was rewarded with a partial view to the west. Turns out, with only a partial view, I could easily have bypassed Big Butt. Right after the bypass trail rejoined the AT, there was an interesting rock formation a large upright rock split completely in two with only a foot wide opening from top to bottom. I felt like I was at a preview for Stonehenge. It was about 8:30am and the sun was piercing through the crack perfectly. Took a couple pics but could not really capture the coolness of the scene. Later in the hike, I caught up to Bruce, the 74 yr old voter fraud believer. He was laying by a small spur trail. He said there were some Civil War graves a few yards up the spur. The Shelton Graves is the burial site of 2 Union soldiers and a 13 year old boy who were killed by Confederates in 1864. The Sheltons lived in this area of NC near the Tenn border. They were prossibly deserters hiding out from both the union and rebel forces in the area. This was near their homestead. There were ambushed by rebel forces and several were killed and a few were wounded. The families buried the three men where there were shot to death. The fact that they were Union soldiers from the mountains of western NC was strange to me. I never thought that men from this far south would fight for the union. Shows how little I know of the complexities of that conflict. The rest of the hike that day was pretty smooth. Long sections of the trail ran fairly level through rhododendron groves and mixed hardwoods. The sky was a brilliant blue with only scattered clouds and the temperature was perfect for hiking.
I had lunch at Rector Laurel road with Bruce, Jesse, Hops, Extra, and Sam. It was pleasant to hang out with a group and bs about the day.
Today is Liam's birthday. I called him after lunch and spent a few moments talking to him and feeling connected to home and family.
As typical, there was a hard climb at the end of the day to the shelter.  I expected a lot of tents at the shelter when I arrived but this evening only a few people from last night stayed. Jesse, Hops, and Sam kept hiking. They wanted to position themselves farther up the trail so they could reach Erwin early in the morning two days from now. That must of been what a lot chose to do since only about 10 or 11 hikers are at Hogback tonight. Pretty easy 15 miles today. Only one more night on the trail and then I am done. My thoughts are beginning to turn back over the last month and the realization that my southern sojourn is almost complete. Only about 27 miles left. I think I will try for more miles tomorrow so I can get out earlier on Saturday.","Jerry's Cabin Shelter

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637726,"I woke up a little before dawn to the sound of a dog loudly barking. It came from up the hill near where the blue blazed trail to the shelter meets the AT. There were a couple tent sites up there. Dogs. I've seen several of them since I started and I can understand the desire of the owners to bring along their close friend but I really question their reasoning. I think about Christine's Bobo who was quilled back in NJ on my shakedown hike. The trail is full of rough terrain, sharp rocks and boulders, difficult ascents and even more difficult descents. I don't know of many dogs that are brought up in this type of terrain. Most dogs walk on sidewalks or groomed trails in the owners hometowns. Certainly very few hikers are ready for the trail. What makes them think their pets are ready for walking 10 or 12 miles a day in this environment.  I've met about 8 or 9 hikers with dogs and some were forces off the trail because the dog was injured. A couple had cut pads. One dog that I saw last night was big and shaggy. His owner could only hike in the early morning or late evening and night because the dog couldn't handle to heat. And how many dogs are trained not to approach a timber rattler or copperhead? I know I couldn't trust Utley with not darting after something he shouldn't.  I understand the companionship and safe feeling that a dog brings but it is fair to your pet?  And to top this off, while I was hiking up Big Bald today, I was almost at the top and around a blind corner come two dogs barking and snarling at me. I'm yelling for the owner to get control of the dogs while backing down the hill at the same time. Not what I need after a 4 mile 1900 foot climb. Two hikers come around the corner. The guy has a remote in his hand. I guess the dog has a shock collar on but he wasn't using it. Both him and the woman with him were more concerned with the dogs than with me. Very annoying. Why on a very popular summit do you let your dogs run free when you know that they will go after other hikers? I was pissed. So another reason to leave your pet at home. Putting that aside, the summit of Big Bald was the most spectacular view I have had to date on the southern section. As impressive as Max Patch, this certainly rivaled it. Mt Mitchell was to the east. The highest peak east of the Rockies. I was greeted by a clear 360 degree view. And to top it all off as I was reaching the summit, I saw Ben talking to two folks. As I passed, I saw he was holding a beer can. A beer? I slowed down and stopped....possibly trail magic? The guy talking to Ben looked at me and said ""I don't have any food left but I do have one IPA left. It's from Wicked Weed.""
""Manna from heaven, fueled with hops,"" was my reply. On top of Big Bald with a Wicked Weed IPA! What a way to summit a mountain and forget about annoying hikers with poorly trained dogs. Sucked down the beer and sucked in the views. Rested an hour before going on my way.
Even though it was near 1pm, I wanted to push for another 10 miles so I would have an easy final day. There was a site listed at 335.4 miles. This would leave me just under 9 miles to finish this section and for me to have completed the AT to Route 17 in Harriman State Park in NY. Almost too unreal to believe.
Called Eileen from High Rocks. I'm getting excited about going home for two weeks. After I hung up with her, who comes up behind me but Miles and his wife, Becca. Finally able to get a pic with all 3 of us. I dropped one more writer on Miles. Pynchon. They left me in their dust was we went downhill. Of course i had one more steep climb to my camp site. Arrived a little before 7. I had the place to myself. Good thing since it only had room for 3 or 4 tents. Just as I was settling into the tent to sleep who arrives by Jive Turkey. He is such a good person. Open, friendly and sincere. Spent a long time talking to him while he set up his tent. He is one of probably 3 hikers with whom I would like to share my last night of hiking in the South. A good evening.","Hogback Ridge Shelter

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637830,"Last day of hiking in the south. 9 more miles and I will have connected all the dots from Springer to Route 17 in Harriman State Park.  I'm feeling a great sense of achievement even though there is still over 800 miles left. First thing first. My thought focused on completing this next nine miles without a silly injury. Funny how one can focus on the worse case while living such a good moment.
I awoke a little before dawn to Jive Turkey making some noise. When I finally got up I found that he had broken camp and departed before dawn. Was it a dream that he was even there? A spectre rolling in at dark, spending the night watching over me and gone like the wisps of mist in the morning sun. The mountains are deep and dark and full of secrets. I was at the Nolichucky River bridge by 12:15. Stopped in Uncle Johnny's Hostel and ran into Jesse, Sam and Hops. These three young men were excited to see me and congratulate me on completing this section. I have enjoyed meeting so many hikers on this trip. And so many that cheer and encourage each other to continue on and finish. This hike has been very different from 2019 where I hiked so much by myself. Marty was at the bridge a little after 1:00 and so ended this section in the same place where it had ended in 2019. But this is not the end now. Only a hiatus til June 9th.","Camp site at 334.5 miles

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639002,"Back on the trail after a two week lay off. 
It was quite the adventure getting here again. Arose at 4:45am to get the 5:45am train from Norristown. Then an 11 minute layover at Jefferson Station where I caught a train to Trenton. Transferred to NJ transit and took a train to Secaucus where I caught my last train to Harriman. 6 hours and presto I am only 2.3 miles from where I started this journey in April 2019. A quick Uber ride took care of the 2.3.
The major issue is I watched the Sixers win last night so I didn't get a lot of sleep besides being keyed up for leaving for 2 months. Since all the train rides were near an hour long, I didn't get to sleep on the trains. So here I am at the trailhead on a very hot and humid day not very rested and having only a doughnut since breakfast. Not the best prescription for success. 
The hike started well enough but very soon I tired in the sweltering day. I had less than 10 miles to go but they were some of the toughest I've had. I took a lot of breaks and every time I sat down, I started to fall asleep. And I went through the Lemon Squeezer which is a narrow cleft in two boulders. There is not enough room for me and my pack so I carried the pack ahead of me tossing it up one step at a time. I'm sure it would have been much easier if I has some sleep, stopped to make  some food and had not taken off for two weeks.
These whiny thoughts were going through my head for the entire walk.
I had to keep telling myself that tomorrow would be much better. Several times I heard thunder in the distance but it never got too close. Finally reached the shelter, made some dinner and settled down. After awhile I felt better. The storms passed to the west and I decided to set up the tent near dark since the mosquitoes were out and the threat of rain had gone.
I'm sure tomorrow will be better and I'll put this whining aside.","Route 17, Harriman, NY

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639121,"So a good night sleep in my tent with the flap open did a world of good to my attitude. Started the hike in a much better mood. On the trail around 7. I had 3 ups today: West Mountain,  Bear Mountain and the climb out of the Hudson. While none of these mountains are anywhere near as high as the ones I just left in NC/ TN they have their own challenges. It appears at least from today, that the trails go straight up the steepest section of the mountain and that the rocks of PA have returned. 
I'm not sure if I have mentioned that both my Achilles tendons have been giving me problems. They have been very stiff and sore. I had hoped that the two week rest would help and it did a little but but the straining going up a steep climb has brought the discomfort back. I tried arnica last night but tonight I'm going to put on some KT tape and see if that helps. About 4 miles into the hike today, I passed mile 1400 on my trip. I am amazed that I have come this far even if it is 3 years in the making.
Bear Mountain ascent was not super rocky to start since I walked up an old road to start but then it changed and became difficult. But the view from the top was great. There was less humidity today and while there was still some haze, it was pretty clear. Clear enough that I could easily make out the New York city skyline at a distance of over 30 miles. Spent an hour on the summit and chatted with an older couple. She had thru hiked 25 years ago and they still travel back to some of the places on the trail to revisit them though now as day trips by car. I can see myself dragging Eileen along to do the same thing. 
Leaving Bear Mountain going northbound is interesting. Almost the entire descent is by stairs. Crews must have spent years fashioning these stone steps and placing them. I did not count them but when I got to the bottom I did look around for signs that may have given that answer. I feel bad for any Sobo who has to climb up them with a full pack. 
At the bottom, the trail goes through a zoo. So cool. A zoo. There is a large bronze statue of Walt Whitman in the zoo. 
After leaving the zoo, I crossed the Hudson River on a suspension bridge. Myasthenia steep climb of the day was indeed very steep and I was glad to be at my tent site. Set up camp with a flip flop hikers, Decadent.","William Brien Memorial Shelter

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639353,"I talked for awhile with Decadent last evening.  He is probably his mid 30s. He got on the trail at Rock Fish Gap at the southern end of Shenandoah National Park. I asked him why he was hiking. He told me it was something he has wanted to do for a long time and he was planning on hiking when he retired but he recently was diagnosed with a medical problem that may prove fatal by the time he is on his 50s so he decided to Carpe Diem and hike this year. One has to admire his fortitude.
He said there is camping at Canopus Lake Beach free for hikers and has a hot shower. Decided to attempt 18 miles today. The amount of ascents and decesnts looked doable. 
Just 4 miles into the hike I came to an intersection where the Appalachian Deli is located. One of the cool things about hiking in NY is there are several delis within easy access of the trail. This one is open 24/7. I stuffed myself with scrambled eggs and sausage and bacon stuffed between 2 massive pancakes with a side of hash browns. Took a cream cheese everything bagel with me for lunch.
NY is rockies than I thought and steeper. No switchbacks so you go straight up. It going to take a few more days to get my hiking legs back. About 4 miles from camp the trail runs on an abandoned rail line so that was great. Walked it for about two miles. My thoughts turned to an easy run to the lake. That was not to be. The last mile to the Lake was nothing but picking my was over boulders and climbing down steep sharp rocks. Not what I had hoped for after 17 miles. Finally arrived at camp and set up in a field a quarter mile from the lake. This is where they stick the thru hikers. I was able to get a hot shower so I felt better but my Achilles tendons are really sore. 
Two cools items about today's hike. I passed a colonial farmstead ruins that was used as a smallpox inoculation station by Washington's Army in the winter of 1776.
Also passed an old rotary dial phone. It's called the Telephone of the Wind and can be used by those who grieve to contact lost loved ones. It was originally conceived by a Japanese garden designer so he could talk to his beloved cousin.

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639368,"I checked the weather first thing today since it was pretty overcast when I was breaking camp.  Only a 25% chance of showers. Not bad. However within 20 minutes of hiking I found myself in that 25%...for the next hour and a half. Crossed a mountain and saw only heavy mist. By about 10 the rain had stopped but the low clouds remained. As I was coming down I came upon a very large group hiking. In the lead was a fiftish man followed by hikers of all ages and sizes.  There were a couple children that looked under 8. There were some teenagers and young adults and an assortment of middle aged men and women. Probably 25 to 30 working their way up this mountain. Pretty impressive to have organized all these people but what was really great to see was they were all African Americans.  The trail is so white most of the time that it was truly heartwarming to see men, women and children of color walking the AT. Hopefully some of these young people will come back out to thru hike. 
Later passed a work crew building a massive set of steps down from a road crossing. An all volunteer group giving back to the trail. 
Hit my 2nd Deli today. Right around noon time. Got an Uncle Ricky sandwich which they called a hero but it was really a Norristown Zep. Pretty good and since I had a shorter day today I washed it down with a beer. Well a Coors so it was almost a beer.
Made camp again with Decadent. Third night in a row. He knew some other folks staying in the shelter and we were talking about dogs on the trail. One guy was talking about a woman who had walked with her dog but had to get off for an injury and when she came back  she left to dog home. I looked at him and compared  notes. Turns out that Christina now called Black Sheep is back on the trail. This is the person whose dog was quilled and who helped put Steve back in April when I was finishing PA and NJ. She is about a week behind me. Funny how small a world the trail is. 
Hopefully we will have better weather tomorrow.  There have not been many views anyway but with the low clouds there are even less.","Canopus Lake Beach

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639380,"Today started out clear with a deep blue sky. Another beautiful Sunday walk in the woods. About 5 miles in I came to a lake. There were kayaks on the water and I thought how Eileen and I love to take the tandem out to Marsh Creek Lake. This lake's name is a little different. It is called Nuclear Lake. It is named for a plutonium facility that was once on its shore until there was an explosion in 1972 and they shut it down. The government declared the area safe and later the AT was routed along the south shore. Let me think...what is the half life of plutonium? Longer than mine I'm guessing. Don't think I want to share a meal with those kayakers fishing in that lake. 
As I was taking a couple pics of the lake I noticed clouds coming in again. Storms are forecast for tomorrow and Tuesday. 
I'm in a part of NY that doesn't have much elevation changes. There are a lot of ups and downs but no views really. Walked through a large pasture in the afternoon and saw some colorful wildflowers.
As I was eating some lunch, Decadent, Lizard, Hot Sauce and Far Out walked up. They had eaten at the last NY Deli near the trail. They were fired up with sugar and were talking about going 21 miles to Ten Mile River shelter. I had planned on a 16 mile day. Told them I would probably lose them now. However by doing the 21 today, I could get my resupply in Kent a day early.
I made it to Wiley Shelter by 5 and the group was just getting ready to leave. I felt pretty good and decided to join them. 
Turns out I was glad I did. It took less than 2 hours to get to the next Shelter and it is right on the river. After I set up camp and ate dinner I went down to the river to soak my sore legs. It felt so good.

As I lay in my bag, I realized that it had not rained last night and if I got my ass in gear, maybe I could break camp before the storm.  Decadent was thinking the same thing because I could hear him taking down his tent already. 
Just as I finished loading my pack, the rains started. I sat under the eave of the shelter to let the worst past and started hiking. I had 7 miles to Rt 41, the road to Kent.  Walked most of it in the rain though it did ease up as the day progressed.
The KT tape seems to be doing some good. The Achilles tendons are not as cranky as the last couple of days. I will continue applying it and see what happens. 
Reached Kent around 11. All the comments in Guthpols talked about how expensive Kent is. When Decadent and I checked out the places to stay even the hiker rates were over $165/night. Glad I only needed a light resupply.  
There was a gas station store at the first intersection. Turns put it had everything I needed.  It's run by a couple guys who know what hikers need. It was expensive  but easy to complete. I get the feeling that Kent is similar to Swarthmore. A pricy enclave in an ordinary area. I passed a private school on the way into town that looked pretty big. 
Got a ride back to the trailhead by a Mom who was looking for the trail so she could pick up a stranger's kid. Seems she is on a national  Facebook group of college student parents who help out kids as they travel throughout the country. 
Back on the trail I climbed up to St John's
Ledges. It had a decent view as the clouds were slowly lifting.  The half mile hike down from it was nearly vertical. Glad it had not rained since the morning because I would have been even more terrified coming down. 
Once down though I walked for 3 miles along the Housatonic River to a decent shelter. Tomorrow calls for some clearing later.  Stayed in the shelter tonight to avoid breaking down in the rain.","Ten Mile River shelter

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639483,"No rain last night and the clouds were lifting when I crawled out of the shelter. Broke camp and started hiking by 7 or so. The first few miles followed the Housatonic River. Level, lovely walk. Took a couple good shots of the clear blue sky with some clouds over the surrounding hills. 
By midmorning,  I was following Hatch Brook up a steep hill while the brook cascaded past me. It was getting warm, I hadn't bathed in a week and there it was...a pool big enough for me with a small waterfall. Off with my clothes and into the very cold but extremely refreshing water. This is the first spontaneous thing I've done on the trail and it felt so right. Washed myself and my shirt and almost got rid of much of the stench. Too time just to relax. 
Later in the afternoon, I keep seeing caterpillars. Then I started noticing half eaten green leaves on the ground. Within a half mile or so, I was no longer walking in a green tunnel. All the oak and maple trees were stripped bare. It was very desolate. I ran into another hiker and he confirmed my thoughts...gypsy moths. As I continued, the ground was squirming with the caterpillars. Very disheartening, it seems unlikely that these trees will survive this onslaught. It was a small area either. I walked for almost 5 miles through their swath of gluttony. 
About 3 the sky turned grey and I checked weather. Thunderstorms in the area and I am on top of a hill. Started to walk as fast as the terrain permitted but I was still on Mount Easter when the Strom hit. Saw a flash and barely counted 3 before I heard the clap. Too close...what to do. I came to a small depression and decided to wait it put. I put my aluminum trekking poles about 75 feet away and waited. If I heard another clap, I would have dropped my pack with the aluminum tent poles but luckily, I didn't hear anyone thunder. I waited about 15 minutes and then grabbed my poles and made for the downstoke of the hill. The rained cleared put by the time I arrived at Hang Glider View which opened out to the west. 
Got to the Campsite by 6ish and set up. A little while later, Far Out, Hot Sauce and Tully rolled in, followed shortly thereafter by Decadent. I have now hung out with most of these folks for 3 or 4 days. Good to see them.

What a beautiful day. After the late rain yesterday, the air was scrubbed clean. The early morning light was prefect. The green leaves were crisp, the duff and pine needles gave off their warm earthy smell and the wind provided just the right amount of chill. And on top of that Mountainside Cafe was only 1.2 miles from camp. This Cafe is a farm to table that serves breakfast. It is only 200 yards off trail. They opened at 7. I was there at 7:20. Ordered the Johnny Cash Skillet. It was scrambled eggs, bacon, cheddar cheese and heirloom tomatoes on a heaping pile of home fries. I had a cucumber and melon juice that was delicious. I sat on their front porch and talked to all the other hikers as they came in. What a great start.
This section of the trail goes through Falls Village, a small town on the Housatonic. There is indeed falls in town. Pretty impressive ones actually.  
The trail all day was amazing. A lot of pine forest, some open fields and a big climb at the end of the day that had the best view since leaving the south. Even before that view I walked along a field, called Rand's View, that a farmer was mowing. Behind him were Mt Race, Mt Everitt and Bear Mountain, a perfect picture. 
I also passed 1500 miles today. Very happy about that. 
The day was capped off with a spectacular view east from the summit of Lion's Head.
The weather cooperated, staying in the low 70's. 
Best hiking day so far.

The day started with a fairly easy 600' class up Bear Mountain. It is the highest peak in CT at 2323' but weirdly it is not the highest point. A larger mountain in MA, Mt Frissell, is taller and its southern slope runs into CT. Where the border is on that slope is higher than Bear Mountain. Regardless,  the view is very nice from the summit. Going north I descended steeply into Sage's Ravine up Race Mountain where the are ledges for almost a half mile with continuous views to the east. But then came to ascent and descent from Mt Everitt. What a pain in my ass and my feet. Super steep and rocky. I had planned on meeting Roy at noon but moved that back.
But ended up arriving at the parking lot at the exact same time as Roy and his pug, Daisy. 
It was great meeting up with Roy and Elizabeth. They provided a great meal of steak, potatoes and salad with ice cream and conversation for dessert. 
They live in Hudson, a quaint little town right on the river. It is full of antique stores, clothing boutiques and restaurants. A good place for a long weekend visit but I will be on my way to the trail tomorrow, but first he is taking me to Great Barrington in search of shoes.

I started my day with another shower, a couple cups of ersatz coffee and some very tasty homemade sourdough bread Roy has spent time perfecting. It has been a great break for me to visit them especially after 8 straight days on the trail.
Got to Great Barrington and found Eagle Shoes, a supplier of Merrell shoes. I stepped back in time in this place. Walked in the door and there was a gentleman with a grey work apron on behind a counter working with some boot leather. Behind him were the belt sanders and other tools of the cobblers trade. He only had a couple size 11.5 available and only 1 that wasn't Waterproof. An Oboz boot. I tried it on and hopefully it will work. It felt pretty good so I went with them and they were on sale to boot.
Said my farewells to Roy and Daisy the pug and was back on the trail by 10:30. Hiked down the rest of Everitt toward Great Barrington. About 3 miles from the Housatonic River, I started walking on 2x8s nailed to 8x8s. For anyone familiar with hiking that means you are in a wet and boggy area. With that came the mosquitoes and they came and came. I was not expecting this. Very glad for the boardwalk and Roy's bread because I put on the afterburners and raced as fast as my overburdened legs could carry me. My first introduction to the MA part if the trail was not pleasant. Made my way up to Jug's End,  a sharp outcrop with views. There is a great view there but what caught my eye were the first ripe wild blueberries on this hike. Pretty small but tasty. Got to a road crossing and passed a monument to the last battle of Shay's Rebellion. 
About 2 miles from the shelter I met up with a 60ish hiker named Paul. Quite a talkative fellow he was. By the time I left him behind I knew all about his two daughters, his business,  his divorce and other aspects of his life. Either I'm the kind of guy people open up too or he really needed an ear at the that moment.  He ended up at the same shelter tonight and seems to be a genuine nice guy.
It was hot and humid today. Showers in the forecast for tonight and no room in the shelter except in a loft reached by climbing up a 90 degree ladder. No thank you. I can see myself trying to come down that in the dark to pee.

Also, the shoes seem to be having better. I didn't feel my toes pushing against the front of the boots on the downhill and the blisters weren't rubbing against the toe box. I'll probably still lose some toenails but feet are doing better. The Achilles are still tight and I'm going to keep applying the KT tape since that really seems to work. 
Today was a mix of clouds and sun. Left camp a little later since is a short day. I had a choice of 11.3 miles or 21 miles to the next shelter. I chose wisely I think. 
So far Mass has been mostly lower hills and bogs with few vista's. I passed a couple beaver ponds today but mostly a laid back day. 
Set up camp at a 19th century Shaker homestead. Not much left except the stone foundation and a piece of farm equipment, possibly the remains of plow.
Later Fire rolled in. I had met her a few days ago. Then Decadent arrived from his zero  in Great Barrington. Paul, the talkative section hiker arrived almost at dark after taking almost 11 hours to walk 11 miles.

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639773,"Summer solstice. I planned on an almost 19 mile day today and I had plenty of daylight to do it.
I got up at 5:15 and broke camp before 6:30. 
There was a mist this morning that was just lifting as I was walking through some meadows. There were a couple nice view of the surrounding hills. It is pretty here, a little like Chester County. But mostly it was another day of low hills, no vistas and lots of bogs. As I was replying to my father's day texts, I told Liam that the Massachusetts AT will always be low hills and mosquitoes for me. I have almost run out of deet. It's also humid so I sweat constantly. Got 10 miles in before noon, crossed the Mass turnpike and started singing an old Tom Rush song. ""Mass turnpike to Route 15 take on down to the NewYork scene...""
Had lunch with Decadent at a small Brook just after the turnpike. Took a few minutes to soak my feet and got on way. 
Regardless of the heat and humidity, it was a good day hiking, touching base with Ian, Liam and Zack. 
Arrived at October Mountain shelter to find a group of 10 college age students occupying the shelter. They are in training to learn backwoods skills so they can take grade schoolers out on overnight camping trips. Pretty cool idea but I'm not sure of the extent of their training. 
Fire, Decadent and Tater, who showed up last night are here. I walked with him for awhile today. He left Springer in March. Nice guy who got his name when during a cold night in GA, he wrapped himself up in his emergency mylar blanket.","Shaker Campsite

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639789,"So over the last two days I noticed that a piece of plastic inside one of the stabilizer straps on my pack is broken. Since I noticed it over the weekend, I waited until today, Monday, to call Osprey. I did that in Dalton. 
Day started out beautiful. No rain last night. Over the next couple days, I pass through two towns, Dalton and Cheshire. 
Blue skies and light clouds for the morning section. Crossed Warner Hill with a view of Greylock and also of Pittsfield. Pittsfield is a town where Herman Melville lived. Supposedly,  it was while looking at Greylock from his window that he got the idea for Moby Dick since Greylock has a shape reminiscent of a whale's tail. 
The day grew warmer and by the time I hit Dalton at 1:00pm it was downright hot.  I had lunch at Angelina's, a sub shop. The meatballs were fine but the rolls lettuce to be desired. Certainly not a good Philly roll. But there was beer. A liquor store sold signals so I went with a local lager and a hellos from Trappe brewing in Stowe. I carried put the local for dinner later.
Spent most of my time in Dalton on hold with Osprey. They wanted to send me a repair kit for the broken piece but it is completely sewn into the pack. Unless they sent a sewing machine, I can't see how it can be repaired.  More to follow on this. I'm not even sure how the pack will be  impacted should the stabilizer fail but I don't want to find that out in the middle of the Whites.
I made camp with Tater and Decadent at a Campsite. Rain is in the forecast for tonight. 
Received an email from Osprey with instructions on replacing the pack. Filled that out and sent it off.
Cooled the lager down by placing it between freshly filtered water bottles. 
Has a dinner of cheese and crackers and lager. All in all a good way to finish a day.","October Mountain Shelter

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639874,"So the forecast rain came last night...with a vengeance. Heavy downpours and thunder and lightning. One gets somewhat nervous laying in a tent supported by aluminum poles when one cannot count any time between the flash of lightning and the boom of the thunder. The storm passed directly overhead. I definitely stayed awake for a while. 
At least it wasn't raining when I broke camp. Hiked to the top of Cheshire Cobble. This is a marble strewn outcropping overlooking the village of Cheshire. It affords some pretty views down into the valley and over to Greylock. Of course, most of it was cloud covered today.  Reached the Dunkin Donuts in Cheshire by 9:30.  I had a bagel sandwich, 2 Donuts and a cup of decaf with a toasted bagel to go. Hung there for about an hour. Talked to Decadent for a few minutes and then as I was leaving the rain returned. Sometimes when I know it will be heavy rains, I will put on my rain pants and jacket. Today I just went with the jacket and kept the kilt on. It was warm enough. Rained pretty hard for awhile. I was about a third of the way up Greylock when I came to a 2 foot high boulder in the trail. This is normal. I just had to decide how to step up. The brace on my left leg limits my movements so it's not an automatic reflex how i will step. I need to consider my options especially in the rain. I chose poorly. Stepping to the right I slipped and slowly lost balance and fell to my right down off the trail into a rotted stump, catching my leg in the stump. F...! I took a quick assessment, slowly stood up and found I was bleeding from my left index finger and my right forearm as well as scraps and bruises on my right leg. Not sure if pants would have helped but the kilt did expose my legs. I vented to no one in particular and dropped my pack to get the first aid kit.  Now I don't often need this kit so it is buried in my pack. I had to take everything out of the pack to access the kit. Now all my clothes, sleeping bag and pad are on the ground in the rain. I vent some more. To no one in particular.  At least I have learned to keep most of my stuff in waterproof sacks. Take my neckerchief off to use it to clean the cuts. Pull out the neosporin and bandaids. Get one on my finger OK but can't get one to stick to my arm. Try putting on bandaids in the rain and a slippery narrow trail. I vent a little more. After all this fiddling around, I see the bandaid from my finger on the ground. I look at my finger and arm and realize the bleeding has stopped. OK OK, let's just pack all the stuff back up and get walking again cause now I'm starting to get cold. 
There is a shelter coming up in 2 miles. Do I lay up there and reassess or do I press on? By the time I reach that shelter, the rain has stopped and it is just grey and damp, with water coming from the trees. I press on. As I walked, I realize I am not sore or stiff. The damage is literally only skin deep. I am a lucky man. 
I cross Greylock around 3 in the afternoon. It is totally socked in. There is a war memorial on top of the peak and I can only see about 20 feet up it.  I was here five years ago with friends and it was the same way. I guess I am destined to only see this mountain with clouds around it. 
One good thing about the peak is Thunderbolt Ski Shelter. It was built by the CCC in the '30s as a warming shelter for cross-country skiers. I went in it and found someone had built a fire in one of the stoves early today. The room was warm and I sat on the stove top to get warmed up. 
Feeling better, I headed down the mountain to the shelter three miles away. All the time thinking about how I just want to crawl into the shelter with my sleeping bag and go to sleep. 
So when I get to the shelter, I find another group of 10 college aged folks from Outland have taken over the entire shelter.
Up goes the wet tent, in goes the damp sleeping bag.  Well according to the weather forecast, it is supposed to clear tonight....wrong.  Just as I finished dinner, the rain started again. It is still raining. I'm glad I am going into town tomorrow

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/639940,"The rain stopped sometime during the night but still damp and grey when I woke. Took my time breaking camp. I only had a 3 mile walk to the road and Williamstown was 1.5 miles west. I had called the Williamstown Motel from near Greylock yesterday but the connection didn't hold and I barely got to speak to the woman who answered, though she did say they had vacancies and to come. 
Walked down the hill. Got to one view overlooking the valley but the fog hadn't yet lifted. By the time I got to Route 2 the skies had cleared and it was a beautiful clear day.
Met a hiker walking back to the trail and asked him where he stayed. He said HoJo's. He said the room was fine. Then I met Pickles and Firestarter. They stayed at HoJo's too. How was it? Fine but the TV didn't work and yeah, there was no hot water. So really not fine at all? No not really. The motel was only a couple hundred yards farther.
Got to the Williamstown Motel at 10:15. Rang the bell and a woman answered that check in isn't til 2. Then wait, hang on, she said. She came back and said we'll get you in now. By 10:45 I was in the shower. What a great hiker friendly place. They took one look at my sorry ass and helped me out. 
They let me hang my wet tent and sleeping bag on the clothes line out back.
Had a great rest of the day relaxing,  eating, sipping on a couple local brews and resupplying...and rearranging my pack so the first aid kit in readily available. BTW...I brought waterproof bandaids.","Wilbur Clearing Shelter

Checked out of the hotel and walking toward the trail by 7. Tried hitching but no luck. As soon as I put my thumb down and started walking a car pulls overand asks if I need a ride to the trail. Trail angels are everywhere. This guy was a triple crowner. He has thru hiked the AT, the Pacific Crest trail and the Continental Divide trail. Now he's out doing good deeds for hikers. 
Back on the trail and in 4 miles I am in Vermont. I'm sitting on the border having a snack and up walks Decadent. I am destined to meet up with him. 
Pretty easy walking today but got a taste of the Vermont mud. I'm not sure why but there are a lot of low flat areas in VT where the trail becomes a bit of a morass. The trail clubs have put a lot of boardwalks in but there are still a lot of areas where you are squishing in mud for yards and yards at a time. I imagine this would be far worse in May. 
Spent time on the phone today dealing with my broken strap on my pack. Spoke to CSR who said she never received my email. Resent pics of the strap and she got back to me agreeing to replace the pack.  So that was good news. Now I just have to arrange getting it delivered somewhere.

Broke camp early since i wanted to do a lot of miles and Glastonbury mountain was in front of me. The first several miles over Harmon Hill went smoothly but coming down from it was treacherous. Very steep and rocky. I had to pick out every step. Finally made the bottom and ran into Steve who was doing some trail magic. Thus is the road to Bennington where Decadent is meeting his fiancee for 3 zero days. I may not see him again for a long time. Socked down a couple Gatorades and started the climb out of the valley.  Glastonbury is 10 miles away. Part way up I had reception and reviewed my pack options.  Picked out a newer version. Of my Aether and sent off the email. I followed up with a call and confirmed she will send it out today so I should have it by the time I get to Killington...65 miles away. 
The climb up the mountain was easier than expected however the mountain is tree covered and to get a view you need to climb a tall fire tower. I am not a fan of vertical climbs on open stairs. Actually I almost shake with fear. So just walk up and look only at the tread in front of me. And what a reward. 360 views down to Greylock and north to the Greens.

I spend the day working my body outrageously and not really working the brain so by the time I settle down I am bone tired but mentally very awake but not able to concentrate. But last night, I sleep well. 
I had a snack in the morning at Story Spring shelter along with Gadget, which told me about last night's spot, and Momma Bear and Little Bear, a mother and daughter who are finishing a thru hike from 2018. Along with a couple of young girls who I have seen but don't know their names.  They all left the shelter before me. 
Today's big climb was Stratton Mountain. As I came down to a road that led to a trail parking lot, I saw all of the sitting on the roadside behind a car.  TRAIL MAGIC. Of course Saturday is a more likely day for it. 
Turns out Cindy drove up from Massachusetts with dozens and dozens of homemade muffins along with sodas and water. What a nice surprise especially with a big climb ahead. We all sat and talked for almost a half hour. I downed two banana bran muffins and a coke. I rarely drink soda but on a warm day this one was perfect. 
Powered by sugars and bran, I conquered that mountain pretty quickly. On top there was another fire tower that I had to climb. There was no view from the ground. Up I went again but this time the winds were really blowing. Keeping my eyes glued to the treads in front of me, I plowed upward. Got to the room at the top , took some quick pictures and got of that thing. 
Had lunch with Momma and Little Bear and Gadget, when put came Jean, the caretaker for the tower, with Dixie cups of fresh blueberries for us. More trail magic!
Tomorrow, I need to go into Manchester center for a quick resupply. Momma and Little at going to do a zero there so we decided to camp together tonight at a stealth site on the Winhall River. That way we only have 8.5 to town tomorrow and I can get out of town to a nearby shelter.
When we got to the site, Momma and Little introduced themselves as Kate and Abby. Sometimes normal is nice.

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640163,"Kate and Abby were doing a zero in Manchester Center and I needed to go into town for a minor resupply to carry me to Killington.  It was an 8.5 mile hike to the parking lot on route 11/30, the road to town. It was 5 miles to town and we hoped for Uber but none were available so we decided to hitch. Only problem was the traffic was moving at 55mph downhill. After 10 minutes or so we were wondering how long it would take to walk those miles when a man coming uphill pulled into the lot and said, ""come on, get in, I'll run ya down."" This is a hiker friendly town and people go out of their way for us. A few minutes later we were at an outfitters in town getting put stuff. Then a short walk to a pizza joint...2 slices and a soda for 5 bucks. The supermarket was behind the pizza shop so resupply done quickly
 Then a quick walk back to the ice creamery. Scoop of raspberry sorbet on top strawberry ice cream...waffle cone of course. I bid farewell for a couple days to Kate and Abby and headed out of town but not before a brief stop in to a local tavern for a local lager. Thrist quenched, I'm out to the road with my thumb out. Within a couple minutes a 70ish woman and her 85ish companion pull over to take me back up to the trail. They have been picking up hikers for years and try to give someone a ride whenever they go out. How awesome are these folks. Got to the trail by 3pm
 Did the whole town thing in 3 and a half hours. Started to walk out of the parking lot when a woman walked up and wanted to know if I wanted a soda or Gatorade. She had just pulled in to provide some trail magic. Gatorade please. Thanks and on the trail again for 3 mile hike to the summit of Mt Bromley. Saw last night on Guthooks that I can camp on top of the mountain with great views. It's a perfect day with only scattered clouds. 
Set up camp on top with Bess, PB, Mr.Dracy and Twister.  It's very windy but the sunset is amazing. So many shades and hues of reds, salmons, peach, violets, oranges. I am in awe. What a great place to spend the night after such a marvelous day.","Winhall River stealth site

I left the fly off and woke in the middle of the night to the big dipper in my face. It seemed so close and was so bright. The trail runs in the green tunnel so much that it is really rare to have such an open sky.  Sunrise was 4:41am or at least that was when the brightening sky awoke me. I had a clear view to the east from my tent. All I had to do to see the blossoming day was sit up in my tent. 
After enjoying the sunrise, I broke camp and hiked down from Bromley with memories that I hope will stay with me for many years.  I rue losing the sense of serenity  I had over those 12 hours. Thinking of Jim Croce this is a moment to capture time in a bottle. 
I had a good hike going til I got to Baker Peak. This was a steep rock scramble up a couple hundred feet. Got to the top spent. I was time for lunch. As I was opening my pack up pops Twister.

The logical shelter to stop tomorrow is Clarendon however a bear cub got into an Ursack for bag which is made out of Kevlar and now there is a family of bears frequenting the shelter and are not showing any fear of humans so it is best to avoid that shelter.  The options are either 10 miles or 19.7 to Governor Clement Shelter. The 10 miler won't work if I want to get to Killington to get my new pack so opted for getting up early and doing the extra miles.  I saw Twister head out while I was finishing packing up.

It had rained briefly last night but not enough to quell the building heat and humidity.  I did not think VT could be so oppressive, though talking to Eileen, it seems most of the country is caught in the heat wave. Spending so much time in the woods, my world outlook shrinks to almost nothing, just me and my surroundings. 
Met Gadget several times throughout the day, either as he was taking a break or as I was. He is a retired Air Traffic Controller who started in mid March at Springer. 
The climb up Beacon Hill out of the gorge was arduous. Thunder rumbling in the distance but no relief over us. Hard rock scrambles, picking each step. I must have taken a break every 50 feet. Finally on top with a good view. Called Eileen while taking a break.  Glad I did because by the time I reached the shelter it was after 7 and I did not have any connectivity. It's been hard in VT to have any connectivity.  I'm sure this will only get harder as we enter more remote areas.

On Father's day Ian sent me a text noting among other things the I am a constant example of perseverance. Everyday as I hike, I am reminded of his text. Really all of the hikers out here are an example of perseverance. Regardless of the circumstances thrown at us, we find a way to take the next step. Like all of us amid the daily struggles of life we find a way to take the next step. 
This was especially true today. I of had 10.6 miles to get to Route 4 and only a mile road walk to the Inn at Long Trail where I hoped to take a zero along with Gadget, Momma Bear and Baby Bear. But first Mt Killington was in the way. 
It didn't rain last night but there were distant rumblings of thunder. I awoke to a very hot and sticky day. Grey clouds hanging overhead just added to the thick air. I got going later than usual. The first two miles of the hike was made more difficult by the oppressive air. Each step was a sweat bath. Finally around 3000' the atmosphere lightened up and I moved a little faster but the clouds still hung low. I did pass a pink lady slipper in bloom that was beautiful and eased my day. 
The AT doesn't get to the top of Killington. In order to summit you need to take a .2 mile vertical scramble. This is where perseverance comes in. I could have chosen not to do the peak. It was obviously socked in by clouds and there would be no view but then why am I out here?  I came to experience the trail in all its facets so I dropped my pack and up I went. Going up was the easy part. On top the wind was blowing fiercely,  probably over 35mph. The cloud cover was almost complete but I was able to see some sights so I will take that as yes it was worth climbing.  Coming down on the other hand was whew. A real task. 
Once down I had 6 miles to the road. Most of it down hill. Took a few hours to get there. The whole time listening the thunder storms all around me. Finally, I was 5 minutes from the road when the skies opened up and sheets of rain poured down. I hurried to the road where I was greeted by claps of thunder and pea size hail. Drenched through and through, I arrived at the Inn where they still had a room. I showered and changed into dry clothes and still had time to walk a mile to the post office to get my new replacement backpack.
Perseverance...the willingness to take the next step and then the next step got me up that mountain, down the other side, through the hail and lightning to a warm room, a new pack and a half and half pour of Guinness and Harp at the Irish Pub attached to the Inn.

The guy helped me adjust the torso length and shoulder straps. This new Osprey has lots of areas that are adjustable. Way more than the old one. I think I have it set up pretty good. 
The trail was only a half mile from the outfitters. I carried about half my normal weight in the pack. Walked southbound and passed what is called the Maine Junction where the AT and the Long Trail split. The Long Trail continues north to Canada while the AT turns east to New Hampshire.

I had another fine breakfast at the Inn, packed up the old backpack to ship back to Osprey and walked across the street to wait for the free bus to the post office. I am more than a little upset that the customer service rep did not include a return address shipping label with the new pack. I was even one upset when the post office charged me a lot of money to send back the pack. I will follow up with Osprey on reimbursement. There is no reason why I should bear any cost for a material defect in their product. This is a holiday weekend so I will wait til Tuesday. 
After divesting myself of the old Osprey, I hit the trail. Decided to wear my shorts instead of the kilt today. The kilt was giving a little rash on the hip under the packs belt. Usually on when I sweat a lot or when it is raining so I thought I would try something different.  
Hiking was miserable today. The rain was pretty constant and those times when it wasn't actually raining, the wind would blow the water from the trees. Glad we are only doing 14. Gadget,  Momma and Baby and I are staying together for awhile.
There's a saying on the trail that you don't quit on a bad day or on a rainy day but it is easy to see why you can quit on a rainy day. Rain jackets don't work very well with a backpack pressing on it. It actually functions more like a wet suit. It is designed to keep you warm once saturated. So you walk wet. You stay warm by walking, when you stop, you cool off quickly and start to feel the chill. I told Eileen that if we were car camping, I would have already loaded the car and headed for a sunny place. But this is the AT. Remember perseverance...well this is where it kicks in. You put one foot carefully in front of the other and move on. I think I said before that when walking, rain is the great motivator. All you want to do is get out of it so you try to hike faster while at the same time being aware of the slippery trail. 
At least tonight we are staying at the Lookout. This is a privately owned cabin just off the trail that the owners make available for thru hikers. No heat, water or privy but 4 walls, windows and a door. It is warmer in here than outside.

Mileage today was reasonable and the elevation changes were easier that yesterday but the rain was fairly steady all day with an hour or so break in the early afternoon. Found a bit of trail magic about 4 miles in. A pack of Oreos and a soda geared me up for the next hill. Like yesterday,  the trail travels east to Hanover, NH. By doing so we don't run any ridges, rather you go up one side of a mountain or hill and then down the other. Get to the top,  go back down, cross a bog and a road and up to the top and do it again for 4 times. Met Gadget on top of one and shared time eating lunch together. No views today either or not any that we could see through the clouds. This is just a day on the trail spent getting mileage done. I guess I shouldn't really say that because there is beauty to be seen on the trail regardless of the weather. The rain drops on black eyed Susan's, the mist over a Vermont farm, cookies laid on the frame of a trail kiosk made by elementary school children, the smell of the pine straw under your feet. So yes I did have enjoyment today but there were hazards also. Two days of rain made the downhills slick as a sliding board coated in Teflon.  If I could downhill ski, I probably would have made 3 miles an hour. Every step required concentration and a little bit of luck.
Got to the shelter near 5 but it was crowded. Set up my tent as the rain started harder. Decided no hot meal tonight. Made a chicken and cheese tortilla and went to bed.

My sleeping bag was damp at the bottom, my sleeping pad had wet spots and the tent needless to say was wet and dirty along the edges.

That seems so long ago...a couple kids just having fun and laughing at silly things and it seems like yesterday as I am now only a few days from climbing the same mountain. But now I am almost 70, wearing a brace on my knee and struggling with every ascent. It is a little ironic that I wear this brace most likely as a result of hyperextending that knee on the initial climb up to Mt. Liberty in 1976? Or not ironic, just the cycle of life coming full circle at least this small part of it.

As I was breaking camp today, I saw the other kilt wearer who I had heard about leave for the trail just before me. Later I came upon him and yet another kilt wearer who is Sobo.  3 kilts together...an impromptu meeting of the order of the kilt. Got a Pic to remember this.
Finally out of the woods but we had a road walk of 2 miles from Norwich to Hanover. Road walks are hard on the knees for all hikers. 
Crossed over the Connecticut River into New Hampshire.  12 down...2 to go. 
Spent the night at a great hostel where the grilled hamburgers and hot dogs for the 4th. Dried most of my things and did laundry. Good end to Vermont and a good prep for the challenges that the Whites will bring.","Thistle Hill shelter

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640406,"The hostel provides coffee and waffles for breakfast. Also, there were some left over bagels in the free stuff so I had a pretty good breakfast.
The weather is perfect today, sunny and a little cool. The hostel provided a shuttle back into town where a group of us headed to the local market to resupply. This is an Ivy League town with Dartmouth located right in town, so the market was a co-op that was pricy and not the best place for hikers to resupply.  Where's a Dollar General when you need it? Finally got what I thought I could use for a couple days since we are only doing 3 days before we stop at Lincoln which is at the base of the Whites. 
Short day today. 11 miles.
The New Hampshire part of the trail greeted me with open arms.  The way the trail wound through large outcroppings and fir trees and dropped quietly down into moss covered vales, it seemed to welcome me with a mutual sense of intimacy, like it was letting me in on something marvelous to experience. 
And it is marvelous walking these woods on a perfect summer day. I struggle to express my feelings. Like being back to the sublime where the sense of wonder far outstrips the words to express the wonder. 
Feeling a little like Lou Gerhrig. Today I am the luckiest man in the world. Amazing what a good night's sleep, dry clothes and a sunny day can do to one's outlook but it is indeed more than just that. It is the sense of being in, with, among nature.
The shelter tonight has a bench with a back on it that looks out over a valley to the east. First, you don't often get a view from a shelter, normally they are in a valley. Second, you never get to sit with your back against something, normally there are just benches or logs at a shelter so this is a treat. I do have to say no matter what New Hampshire has in store for me going forward, today was a great intro to the state.","Hanover Adventure Hostel

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640564,"OK, OK. So I was entranced by the New Hampshire Siren's sweet song. Yesterday was so perfect, she lulled me into restful, relaxed thoughts so imagine my surprise when she stuck her talons in me before dawn. Just as I was starting to wake up, the rains came. And it rained the entire time I was breaking camp.  On a 17 plus mile day to boot. My mood from yesterday took a 180 turn. I'm thinking I have no desire to go through the Whites in rain. I am out for all the experience, the good, the bad, the difficult but one of the main reasons is the beauty. I want to see Mt Washington and the Presidents under blue sky and scattered clouds. I'm really not sure if I will proceed if the weather keeps up this way. I heard from my brother in law that a tropical storm may brush Maine on Friday. I was thinking about taking a zero that day and now I probably will but if it takes days to clear out then what. I can't sit forever and wait for clear weather. I will need to start to consider my options. I've already stretched this out over 3 years, do I delay til next year?  I will be 70 with the hardest 400 miles left to do. Do I take some time off and return? But the I lose my window to summit with the boys. Do I go on for a portion and then wait til next year? 
I need to first get a clear idea of what the next 10 days weather looks like and then start putting together a list of pros and cons and options. 
So, that was my thoughts early today. It did not rain anymore and the sun even came out for awhile but today was still so difficult.  Along with 17.7 miles, there were over 5000 feet in ascents and descents. Wore me out. Wore on my knee and my Achilles. A couple things saved the day. One was a slow 4 mile downhill after the 2400' ascent. I was able to relax and take full strides for a decent amount of time. And the absolute other was the photo I captured on a ledge coming up Mt. Cube at the end of the day. It's today posted shot. 
Reached Hexacuba shelter near 7:30 but only after slipping and falling while getting water. I am a little tired and I know I am not going to do a combination over 15 miles and 4500' in ups and downs.
Settled into a unique 6 sided shelter. More rain forecast for tonight so staying in the shelter with 7 other folks.","Moose Mountain Shelter

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640566,"I woke up determined to turn my head around, slow down and do what is best for me wherever that leads. We talked a lot last night about Mt. Moosilauke. Moosilauke is the first 4000 since down south. The issue is for a Nobo, the ascent is steep but the descent is downright scary. There is a section of about a mile where you drop almost a 1000'. That is bad enough going up but down...possibly in the rain...well wait and see. Especially on top of yesterday's mood.
But for now in the morning with no rain and a dry night in the shelter...take a deep breath...take some time and enjoy a shorter day with significantly less up and downs.
I took my time going up the the summit of Mt Cube. I met Gadget and Woods at the top and we were soon joined by Momma and Baby Bear. There were great views to the south to Smarts Mountain and the the Vermont peaks to the west. Took a nice break there. 
Rest of the day, I took my time. The trail was mixed levels of difficulty with some dicey down from the cube. 
Took time to call Ian. As my luck has gone recently, it started to rain while I was talking to him.  So off the phone and on with the pack cover and jacket.  While I was talking to Ian, Momma and Baby Bear came up to me. Momma said she was getting off the trail in a couple miles to go to a hostel. Momma is younger than me but still on of the older hikers on the trail. I had noticed this morning that she was slower than usual coming up the summit. 
When I got to the shelter, Momma was not there. Baby explained that she need some rest and did not want to try Moosilauke. 
The forecast for tomorrow is rain. Gadget and Baby Bear are going over no matter what. I am really uncertain. I tired and tired is not the best way to approach a serious descent. Gadget says the rain will wash off some of the slime from the rocks and he makes a good point
 On the other hand, rain makes everything a little slippery. 
Spent a lot of time looking at Guthooks and trying make sense of the upcoming days and how to approach the Whites. 
I told them I will wait til morning to decide. If it is raining then I will do a backwards mile to the road where the hostel that Momma went to is.
I am so up in the air right now. 
I know that I am off the trail on Friday because of the tropical storm. If I go backwards tomorrow then at min I lose two days which maybe I need to do to get my MOJO back. Regardless, I will know by 5am when we are planning on getting ready to hike...or not.
On a positive note, I now have less than 400 miles left to Kathadin.","Hexacuba Shelter

I had a restless night. Near dark a group came in with firewood and a radio. Later I found out there is another parking area just north of the shelter. This is most likely a party area for locals. I heard them for awhile but finally drifted off to sleep. Woke at first light, around 5 to the sound of rain. Well that made things a little easier since I had decided not to summit Moosilauke in the rain. But it made things more difficult since I would now go backwards for a mile to Route 25 and try to get a ride into town and find a hotel. 
Gadget and Baby Bear headed up the trail at 6. It was drizzling then. I laid around the shelter slowly getting things together. I called the hotel where Momma Bear was staying but no answer. I called a couple more hotels and finally got a room at the Profile Motel. Then I got a text from Momma Bear saying there was a shuttle going to town from the hostel if I could get there in time. I pulled my shit together and started back south.
I need time to reset and with rain today and a storm tomorrow, I now have it. 
Rode the shuttle with Momma Bear and went into the town of Lincoln. While waiting at the hostel for the shuttle I started to formulate a plan. Rest up first, resupply for a couple days and get to an outfitter for a pair of sandals I could use for Maine water crossings. I will plan on going forward with the hike weather permitting.  I am in an area where I can set extraction points every couple days. I don't want to leave here on a negative backward day. Even if I can only do another day or so, I want to get over Moosilauke and end on a positive note. 
While I haven't mentioned it too much recently, the right Achilles continues to be problematic, sometimes waking me up at night and usually taking a mile or so to loosen up in the morning. That is taking a toll on my speed and progress.  
So weather and fitness will determine how much longer I'm out here but I will plan for both long and short term.
Momma Bear and I spent a couple hours in town eating some breakfast, resupplying and doing some outfitter shopping.  I got sandals that will work.
Got to the motel, took a very long hot shower and rested.
Gadget was able to get into the same motel as me and we went to dinner at a tavern a 15 minute walk away. 
We talked about options. As a thru hiker he is committed to going forward. 
The bottom line is I am a section hiker and what I don't do this year I can do next year. But is that really true? I keep coming back to my age...am I too old? Do I let my age weigh on and drag me down? Do I rail, rail against the coming night at Dylan Thomas suggests? 
I am inclined to follow Mr. Thomas and rail against my age and push forward either this year or next, albeit at a slower more measured pace. That is really what I should be doing now...a slower more measured pace. 
To my family and friends who are reading this and encouraging me along, thank you for following this wildly swinging pendulum ride of my daily moods and thoughts.

Anhaga,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/640660,"Light rain this morning. Appears the tropical storm drifted more off the coast and there threat of severe weather has lessened.
Gadget texted last night about going to breakfast and laundry. 
Grabbed a good breakfast after a mile and a half walk. Met Momma Bear at the diner. 
Got laundry done and set up a shuttle for 7  tomorrow to get back to the trail head and start moving north again. 
Put my plan together. Over the next 50 miles I have an opt out point every couple days, so I will plan long term knowing that if weather or energy/health don't cooperate, I can easily get off trail and head home if need be. 
After two days resting, stretching,  icing ankles, and eating better, I am feeling pretty good. A quick review of the weather forecast looks like the weather is moderating so the chance of  going forward is improving.
My head is clearer.  I am resolved to taking it easier on the trail.

After a breakfast of blueberry muffin, Bear claw, oj and decaf, I caught my shuttle back to my stopping point.  On the way, Maureen,  the shuttle driver told me she didn't remember a wetter July and she has lived here all her life. 
Started hiking up Moosilauke. It's not the up I am concerned about but the down. 
Made summit a little before noon. The summit is over 4800' and in alpine meaning no trees of an stature. Most scrub pine if any at all. This peak is mostly bald with some fragile white flowers clinging to the crags and small rock clefts. 
The view is breathtaking. The Whites are to the east. You can see the Kinsmans to the northeast and to the south and west,  Vermont mountains. Today is Saturday and there are multiple ways up this summit so there were a least 50, probably more people and dogs enjoying the beautiful blue day. 
I took my time up here, had lunch and talked to Eileen. 
Then it was time to descend. And what a descent. The hardest I've done sin e I've been on the AT. At one point the trails descends more than 1700' in less than a mile. There are paths down but each has to be carefully chosen. I did a couple voluntary butt slides so I could get to another foothold. In some places the trail maintainers anchor large 8x8 blocks of wood to the smooth granite as footholds. 
The trail follows Beaver Brook for about a miles worth of rushing waterfalls. So along with the steepness, the trail can be slippery here. 
Bottom line is took me 3.5 hours to come down 1.8 miles. 3.5 hours is an awfully long time for me to concentrate. Man, 15 minutes is a long time for me.
Got to the bottom and crossed Kinsman Notch and started to the Kinsman section of the trail. Weather was beautiful today and is pretty good for tomorrow so I will get to Franconia Notch tomorrow. 
The 1500 foot climb for 3 miles to my stealth site was tough. Rocks, roots and mud all jumbled on a steep climb. 
All day long, I was processing my status and reached the decision to end my hike for this season tomorrow. I will be at the base of the Whites.
My body is sore, especially ankles. My right knee is pretty stiff. The brace limits my ability to freely choose which leg to lead with. My head is tired. Mental fatigue plays a role and I think that hiking all day every day by myself is taking a toll and contributing to my weariness. I also pushed hard these last for weeks and I feel that I have overspent my energy and the bill is now due. 
I feel good about this. I can't be disappointed or sad because I did complete over 1800 miles of the trail but there is an unsettledness about stopping. Getting close to your goal and coming away empty. 
The weather has played a role too. The forecast continues to be unsettled and I have no desire to see the Whites through rain clouds.  
Bottom line is I will need to get in better shape for next year. Approach next years will lesser expectations and goals and take smaller bites of the trail.
After what seemed too long, I found my stealth site. I love when I get a chance to camp away from shelters. There is a peacefulness being in the woods alone. 
Last night of the season. Originally I thought tomorrow would be an easy 13 miles over the Kinsmans but Gadget texted me about how hard it will be. I finally looked at the trail in front and found not one but two 4000 footers between me and Franconia Notch. Now planning on leaving a 6 am and figure on a 12 hour or more day.

I had one of my best nights on the trail. Fell into a restful sleep and didn't wake til near dawn. Broke camp quickly and was walking by 6:15. Off and on the sun worked its way through the clouds and trees. The trail terrain did not improve today. It is one of the most difficult sections I have hiked just based on trail conditions. What wasn't mud was rock and root jumble on steep inclines. After the first hour i had made 1.1 miles. Now I knew I was in for a long day. Slow progress and I hadn't gotten to the climb up South Kinsman yet. At one point, I came to a trail intersection, Reel Brook trail which I could have taken to Route 112 and been done with this test. No way...at this point I intended to finish on a positive note...no matter how hard. Walk on.
After coming up and over Mt. Wolf, I took a break at Eliza Brook Shelter. The trail then rises past several waterfalls on its was to a small pond at the base of South Kinsman. Great photo site with the pond set at the base of cliffs. Pond lilies were in bloom. 
And then the climb.  What Moosilauke was on the decline, this climb was as difficult except up. There were long sections where I threw my poles up above me and climbed hand over hand grasping tree roots and edges of rock to shimmy up to the next 10 feet. My quads got a real workout as I constantly pushed off side to side upward almost vertically. Glad it was still morning, no way would I have wanted to do this at the end of the day. As Gadget would say, ""what fun"" and it was. After all aren't these the challenges I am looking for...wait, I'll get back to you on that one. But it is rewarding to get to the top of one of these sections, turn around and look down and smile, sweat running down and breathing hard, heart racing. Not yet you SOB, not yet. I ain't done yet. 
And the view is worth it. Another 360 Vista on top of South Kinsman. And very few people since this mountain is not easily accessible. Called Eileen and found I out she had spoken to Ian. Ian is in Maine this week on vacation with Melanie and offered to pick me up tomorrow if I am coming off trail. I had been planning on taking a bus to Boston and then a late night train to Philly. I wouldn't get in til 5 in the morning. But his offer would change all the timing and I could get a train earlier and be home by 9pm. Called Ian and made sure I wasn't wrecking his vacation. They had nothing planned for tomorrow and the forecast is rain.  I'm feeling much better about coming off trail. Set up with the same hotel for a room. Ian and Eileen would work out my train ticket. And to top it all, Ian and Melanie offered to hike the Whites with me next year. Liam had already offered the same so I am at peace coming off trail knowing my restart next season can be with my children.
I still had North Kinsman to go over but that was truly a dud. No views and the summit seemed lower than South Kinsman even though it was 500 feet higher. 
The trail never improved and I continued to plod along at a mile an hour until the last two miles when I could walk freely. 
A little over 12 hours and I had completed my hike for the year.  
I ended at mile 1820. Only 373 miles left. Piece of cake for a 70 year old. 
Hitched a ride to the motel with the first car that came along. Turns out the folks that picked me up got married at this motel. Her family owned the closed restaurant across the street and she grew up next door to the motel. Pretty cool. I like the locals here. I've gotten 3 rides all from good folks who lived their lives in these mountains. 
So no butt kicking or kicked butt...in the end a draw. The mountains made me work, sweat, pray, and think and they gave me beauty, friends and a boatload of experience.","Stealth site at 1806.7
