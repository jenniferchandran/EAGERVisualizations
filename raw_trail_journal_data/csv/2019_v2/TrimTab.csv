TrimTab,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553728,"Just came from an old man's obligatory doctor's visit where they take your money for asking what is crawling up your arse (any pending Colonoscopy makes you feel older than Katie Couric, by the way).

So, there's another future itch I have to scratch down there to include the AT...2017 or appended otherwise.
I've been researching for a couple of years. Sat armchair and stalked my daughter from white blaze to brown and yellow (ignored all other colors) along the way. 
Still have the orange SPOT stalking device from her trip, I might use it to let others know of the mountain saddle nestle I reside ... to inadvertently expire while training or otherwise. 
I have year or two till I get to give up work and formally retire. with a pulse for now anyway.
But. I got a new hobby, and that's a trek or two to prep for the AT and buy gear.As an aside... I'm past the youtubes of ""Trekking terms,"" bear vaults, and denatured-alcohol stoves by the way... fwiw, what a waste in my opinion. I'll use a dual fuel. Everclear. ...I'd rather eat cold food than to waste good hooch.that's just me. yes I know about HEET and methanoland all thatBut if I had to pack under the moon...I'd shine with Ethyl, not her ugly sister Methyl
As an aside, I muffed up and missed out on an Ebay procurement... Lightheart Duo camo, seam sealed with all extra poles. $255. piss me off.",,Convinced,"Jan 20, Fri",0
TrimTab,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553718,"So. I start out with a pre-pack weight of 309 lbs. That's without pack or shoes, camp chair, and ice pick/rope. It does include my thigh hug anti-chaffing underwear and Darn Tough Socks though. That counts for something, even if I'm an inverse-gram-weenie. 
That's not a reference to a chilly Seinfeld episode, it's just that I don't care about wagging silly-grams to and fro about now. Not that it matters on the trail, or here at home by the way.
I have all my gear picked out on the internet, but without knowing how my colonoscopy probes out, I'm hesitant to invest in a two-person lightweight tent.If it goes bad, I'll have to send the better half. Even though I was planning to go it alone. anyways.I had a pic to attach. But neither my bathroom scale or i-Phone would recognize the irony of this situation.

 that and I don't have an i-phone
and the scale trips out at 270.
cheers.
My condition and mind is right... though I start from about here...with this guy... and... in case you're asking... it's not me but close.
butt brothers, I suppose...",,Chester's Crack,"Jan 21, Sat",1.40
TrimTab,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553729,"So I was configuring my profile/account and I ran across the section/option for dating on this site. I didn't see much activity on it, but i just wanted ya'll to know that I didn't want you to think that I joined for the dating game.I have enough weighing heavily on my mind.I feel better getting that off my chest.
I don't currently wear a sports bra either. Though I will carry liquid bandaid for pasties for river crossings, in case you're wondering...

TrimTab,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553725,"Pre-through hike prep.I climbed 400 stairs just for fun today.and picked out more gear from the chair.
Balked on a CraigsList purchase of an Arc Teryx Bora 60 LT, too late. Sold for $100.
piss me off.

found this though, for $50... nice for around the camp fire..

Holding out for an Osprey, I suppose.
Something that could wrap around a keg to start, and finish with a twelve-pack ab. I need something to warp my mind and body from start to Finnish. Sweeden, perhaps.",,Master of Stairs,"Jan 23, Mon",1
TrimTab,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553760,"Working my knee and hip injury slowly. Only 400 stairs today, just enough to make a sweat. Still can't see my zipper, but at my age, why bother...Holding on to rails while I perform industrial pointless-up-and-downs mimics the security and assistance from Trek Poles.God loves those that love Trek Poles. Allah too.So I found another suggested vid in my YouTube account...Thought it might be nice to share.I'll probably pack rice to dry out electronics, but you could substitute Silica Gel (You can't eat silica gel). My daughters dropped too many phones in the terlit for me to wonder about what works.anyhoo... a youtube fer U hacks for the AT... use what you carry...White Rice and White plastic container. Caution. This video may upset some Politically Correct crowd. Don't mean to offend the Orange peeps.

TrimTab,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554145,"So I started from Chester's Crack and got onto the trail 0.5 or so...

Huffed and puffed... and got into the zone of dry/wet/brain nyet .... while in a zone, I pissed the marker for the AT trail on up (hard right was left behind)ended up on yellow/whites with a marker that said, ... well I forget, but it said something about 2 miles too late.anyway.  feet wet in cotton socks, I had a headlamp to get me back. I walked a couple miles in the dark, huffing songs beneath my breath.  felt good to walk back downhill most of the ways... with the lights of Front Royal or whatever to my left.  reminded me of christmas lights, off in the distance. I never knew that i could enjoy so little lights, for a long time... and get more out of it... as i did. fun wrapped up during a linear package. took a while to soak it in.
I remember now why I invested in Darn Tough socks.
and non-chaffing underwear. Ex Officio.
size Small. I think I'll have to exchange those.
the bulges that they officially and offensively create.
are real.

TrimTab,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554147,"So the cat fell off the piano today.While I was field-testing my Hennessey Hammock from the rafters downstairs.I heard the crash.. and found a twitching old bag of bones at the legs of the piano stool.Had to put the old rack of life down today. Poor girl. Time to go. Still trying to figure whether she was 15 or 18 years old. Hard to say.

Cat was figgling jiggly all week... couldn't keep any meat on her and passing splots of that behind her wherever she went..Dead minus a few leg spasms when I found her... Figured that I'd bury the honorable old bird with a good view and spent the day to trek to the lake with a shovel and a box while fishing. Something my dad would do, if he were alive. I didn't fall too far from that tree....I won't elaborate on the dead cat haul/hike to bury her near the water, but I did dig a hole extra deep to take care of a sorrow full of business. I shed a few tears. Hiked a few miles and fished afterward to reflect on the day...
 Set up the hammock, and a light tarp to catch some ZZZs. Caught only one fishlet it go with the wind and ... with 4 tent stakes to start...lost 2 to the wind.I'll have to think about what's really at stake...
Here's to the cat that I buried today. Down by the water.
I remember the kitten she was... when my kids were little too.

If you watched the pathetic video to the end. You at least caught the best part.
and 
after watching a second time discovered more truth ...

TrimTab,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554303,"So I have something to do while fishing. I set an ice fishing ""tip up"" rig while I mess with the hammock and ponder. I have to figure out if I should put wings on a mattress, to keep the cold off my arms as well as my arse.kinda like this...BTWI learned how to ice fish from this guy...I dare not embed this one.

TrimTab,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554360,"Okso I'm pretty boring on the prep front. High on theory, low on funds.soI bought a Pack today. Craigslist. $65. The inconspicuous Dude was leaving the country and had to rid himself of a european brand fast. French pack dis quick. There's a french joke in there somewhere... anyway.Met the dude like a drug deal at Whole Foods cafeteria. Felt weird good that way, but no basil exchanged. At least the pizza had dried tomatoes. Made the pack exchange covert and pack channel.Scored 5+lbs of a Millet Khumbu 55+10.Not the best stoke in the realm.just smokin' cheap.",,Parking Lot of Thompson Lake,"Feb 08, Wed",1
TrimTab,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554456,"This is probably too deep for polite prep information, butt...
Just like the shakedown at Neels Gap...if your pack is over 40, you should have it checked by an expert, and purge what you can.
So, as it happens when your sun cycles are over 50... you should have the brain checked before you do attempt the AT. That and have a camera worked into the caboose for christmas card selfies, to prove what an ass you are for leaving your family behind. Intraspection of the intrusive kind.
So. I didn't get the video CD to post a Youtube of the gastro-Spelunking abdominal venture, but I did manage to post a pic of prep, of the Metamucil kind... though i should have included a dose of Magnesium Citrate to be perfectly clear. Good news is that the brain polyps were easily removed.As a side note, I only briefly considered crowd-funding the operation, but opted to just pay the deductible by myself.",,Allah Kahommode Sanctuary,"Feb 10, Fri",0.10
TrimTab,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554473,"So I dragged the beast of burden with me. And my wife and her little dog too. Was a good time. From Terrapin Lodge to Possom Point or so... My fat dog and me walked behind the wife and the poodle. Dogs were well behaved, but I confirmed that the Wife would never accept the leash.
go figure and good thing i suppose.
I'll not have to buy flowers on Tuesday. Just Injinji linerstaking care of the little things.Anyway.Short hike, nice view. Best if you follow your half of better on the trail. Even if you don't like the barren trees, you can score points while complementing the swaggling frontage.

Advert advice, stuff I learnt while we talked and walked with folks on the trail...mostly huffed conversations with the wife...
