Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608624,"We’re looking forward to our 2019 AT hike full of optimism, enthusiasm, and excitement.  Last year’s hike through the Balds and Hump Mountains of Tennessee and through the Grayson Highlands of Virginia filled with wild ponies was spectacular.  In this year’s hike through southern VA we hope to see many more beautiful and interesting sites.  We’re starting in mid-April as usual to avoid possible wintry conditions and still get a couple months’ hiking in before the summer heat becomes intolerable.",,View Entry,"Mar 22, Fri",0
Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608675,"We’re still planning to use our car, our “chuck wagon” as we call it, as a mobile “bounce box” full of all the supplies we’ll need for the hike.  We have a 2-month’s supply of Mountain House meals in the car, so we won’t have resupply problems along the way.  We won’t have to carry any town clothes in our packs; those are waiting for us in the car.  And we can swap out our heavier cold weather gear for lighter, warm weather gear when the time comes.  No mailing things home, buying new clothes, or depending on mail drops.
Last year was our first full hike using the chuck wagon approach, and it turned out great with lots of advantages, but also a few disadvantages.
Pros: Besides those mentioned above, we actually got to rest on zero days.  We didn’t have to walk miles to do town chores like doing laundry, finding places to eat, or resupplying provisions.  But we did get to visit places in towns like museums, antique stores, and other point of interest.
Cons: We didn’t get hiker rates at motels or hostels when we pulled in with our car.  And we had to pay for shuttles up and down the trail so we could hike back to the town where we left it.
Using the car is a more expensive way to hike, but it does provide more freedom of choice in town as well as an easy way to get back home if an emergency arises.",,View Entry,"Mar 23, Sat",0
Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608965,"We met lots of interesting people on last year’s hike.  On our second day we met a guy whose mom’s birthdate was exactly the same as Woofie’s.  The morning we left the Boots-Off Hostel we met a guy who had camped the night before in the no-camping area near Watauga Lake and then complained to us that he’d lost his food to the bears.  No surprise there.  And one poor sole was having a terrible time on the trail because his dog was injured, and he’d just discovered that someone was accessing his bank account.  
Our favorite interesting person was Half-Slow, a Vietnamese hiker we met while climbing Little Hump Mountain.  He recited a Shakespeare poem from memory to us because he was so impressed that we were hiking at our “advanced age.”

 
We’re looking forward to meeting many more interesting people this year.  They’ll be hiking the AT.  That’s interesting.",,View Entry,"Mar 27, Wed",0
Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609770,"With about two weeks to go before this year’s hike it’s time to start final preparations.  I called our shuttle driver, Rambunny, today to arrange a tentative pick-up date.  We plan to drive to Marion, VA on Thursday, Apr 18.  We’ll park our car at the Mount Rogers National Rec Area building on Friday morning, and Rambunny will shuttle us about 24 miles north to the trailhead at VA 42.  Then we’ll enjoy our hike south back to the car.
Over the next couple days I’ll be checking out our gear--putting up and repacking the tent, testing the water filter, checking the headlamp batteries, filling the bottle of alcohol for the stove, and practicing packing the backpacks.  Practicing ensures that not only we can find what we need when unpacking, but also that we know where everything belongs when packing up quickly in the mornings. 
That’s a lesson we learned at the first shelter we stayed at in the Smokeys.  It took us over two hours to pack up, and we were the last ones to leave.  Then we had trouble finding things the next night, because we hadn’t assigned set places for everything in the packs.  After a couple days we knew exactly where each item in our pack belonged.  That not only reduced our packing time, but also kept us from forgetting things at a campsite like lots of hikers do.  Last year we met a hiker returning to a campsite where he’d left his hiking poles behind.",,View Entry,"Apr 06, Sat",0
Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610711,It turns out that the weekend we wanted to start our hike is Easter weekend. That and the forecast for three straight days of rain we’d be starting in led us to postpone our start day to the Monday after Easter.  But that’s ok. It’s only three days.

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611548,"We got to the Mount Rogers National Rec Area HQ at 8 am when they opened and registered our car in the long-term parking area. Rambunny picked us up at 8:15 and drove to Atkins to pick up another couple, Pie Man & Viva, who was also getting a shuttle ride to the same place we were.  
The good news was that the fare was split between us so it cost less. The bad news was that the driver and other 3 passengers got the actual seats. I had to sit on the spare tire in the back of the van with everyone’s backpacks.  But thanks to seeing only out the back window, I got to see a red fox running across a field after the car went by. 
We got to our drop-off spot and were hiking by 9:20.  It didn’t take long for our bodies to let us know that it’s been almost a year since we did anything this strenuous. But the weather was perfect — sunny and 60-75 degrees. 
We found a good campsite near a spring, and there are a few other hikers here with us. One is a thru-hiker, Ian, from England. He once lived near where we were stationed in England, so we had a good time talking. 
We’re going to do another short day tomorrow, so our bodies don’t complain so much.","VA 42

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611550,"We woke up this morning to 37 degrees at 6am, but with full sunshine, it warmed to the 60s by the time we started hiking at 8:15. Little did we know that the day would turn into a late June day, hitting 87 by mid afternoon. 
It was a gorgeous day to be in the woods—just being, not hiking. With our out-of-shape bodies and ?record? heat, we had to take many breaks.  But that was ok to stop hiking and enjoy being on the trail. We even took a half hour nap around 1pm. 
And as we made our way along the trail we met several northbound thru-hikers.  We met Lord Hobo & Disk (like a Frisbee). They were too young to know the significance of my Wooly Booly trail name.  I told them it was a song. They said they’d look it up,
Later we stopped to talk to Capt Handy, and then a woman from MD with the trail name Firefly.  I also stopped to talk to a guy named Tijuana, who also journals on Trail Journals. We’ll have to look for his journal when we get into town. 
Tomorrow we’ll be getting to Atkins for a great breakfast in a restaurant called The Barn. It’s right on the trail because the trail there is a road walk on Rt 11. Then we’ll head down the trail to the Chatfield Shelter, the first shelter we’ve come to since we started.","Tent site 552.6

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611551,"Tiffany, Renegade, and Gummy Bear came into camp last night and we met them today before we all departed for the day’s hike. 
We got going by 8 and made it to the Barn restaurant by 9 and had a great breakfast.  Pieman and Viva were also there. Pieman’s going home, but Viva is continuing southbound to Georgia, so she’ll be at our shelter tonight. 
After breakfast we hiked another 1.5 miles and then took a break. Along came a northbound hiker called Yuwasa, Indian for “alone.”  He said “yuwasa wey” in Indian means lone wolf. 
After we got going again, we came to a stream that we had to cross barefoot carrying our shoes to keep the them dry.  The water was freezing cold but felt really refreshing in the 80+ degree heat. 
Before we got to the shelter we met Blacksmith & Hank the dog from Maine. 
At the Chatfield Shelter were Grumper and Viva.  Viva saved us a spot for our tent, because ours was the only spot big enough for a 2-person tent.  Grumper got his name from his 11-year old grandson, whom he’d taken hiking on the AT for several hundred miles. 
Later Mosey, Napster, Smirk, Columbus, Dr J, GMA, and Buck Wild came to the shelter. Dr J and GMA are young men who came from Germany just to hike the AT. When everyone learned I had a small scale, they all wanted me to weigh their packs, so I was a hit. Finally, it was worth the effort to carry it in my pack. Columbus is on Trail Journals, too, and said he’d seen our journal. Before we all turned in for the night, Buck Wild sang the Wooly Bully song for everyone, since the youngies had never heard it.","Tent site 552.6

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611553,"Today was supposed to be a cloudy day. We left the shelter before 8am at 60 degrees and cloudy, perfect weather for hiking. It was a tough climb leaving the shelter. Half way to the top of Glade Mountain we stopped at a scenic view of Walker Mountain in the distance. Before we left, it started raining, so we put on our rain gear. As soon as we started hiking again it stopped raining. The rest of the day was just partly cloudy. 
Along the way today we met Mountain Dew and later Two Tents. They are both on Trail Journals. Two Tents got his trail name because he said he’s too tense much of the time.  He was carrying a bear canister to keep his food safe. Some states are planning to make them mandatory for hikers on the AT. 
Later in the day Woofie stopped by a tree along the trail to tie her shoe better.  But as she was doing that a very large rock fell from the side of the trail and hit her in her calf. Fortunately Woofie has strong leg muscles, and that boulder just bounce off her without even leaving a mark. 
We ran into Viva again also heading to the Rec Area Visitor Center, so we offered her a ride to Marion, VA with us. She was already there at the visitor center when we got there. We drove her to her motel and then we went to ours across the street.  After we got showered and changed, we picked her up again and we all had a terrific pizza.","Tent site 552.6

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611662,"We spent Friday resting in Marion. It was a good day to be in town because it was a rainy day. Viva had told us about a wonderful restaurant in Witheville called The Log House 1776 Restaurant. We went there for dinner to celebrate our anniversary. It’s an amazing house, started before the revolution as a two-room house. After many additions over the years it’s now a very large two-story building. The meal was fantastic and reasonably priced. 
This morning we shuttled Viva back to the trail at the Nat’l Rec Area visitor center and said our final farewells before she headed south. 
After we checked out of our motel, we drove back to Wytheville to visit a shop that Woofie had seen the night before. Then we drove the rest of the way to the Big Walker Motel in Bland, where we’ll stay tonight and leave our car for a few days until we hike back. 
After checking in, we had lunch at the DQ next door and saw Goku, Mowgli & his dog Bronco there, whom we’d met on day 2.  We had some spare Clif Bars in the car so we offered them some, which they gladly accepted.  Then we asked them if they’d like hiking in a kilt, and they said yes. So we offered them the two new kilts that we’d been keeping the car to put in a hiker box.  They were thrilled, and immediately went and changed into them. We’re so pleased to know who got them and really liked them. So, even if we never make it to Mt Katahdin, maybe our kilts will. 
We also met Bubba at the motel and arranged for our shuttle ride tomorrow back to the trailhead at VA 42, where Rambunny dropped us before. But this time we’ll be hiking north, and it will take us four or five days to get back to the car at the motel.","Red Roof Inn, Marion

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612304,"Before leaving the motel for today’s hike, we went to Subway and each bought a ham & cheese sandwich. We ate half for breakfast and carried the rest to eat for lunch. 
Bubba picked us up at 8 am and drove us to the trailhead at VA 42. We were hiking by 8:30. Not long after getting started hiking north we met Gringo Loco, a south bounder. He’s from VA but is now retired and living in Ecuador. 
We stopped for lunch at the Knot Maul Branch Shelter at 10:30, two miles from where we started. While there, Brass Compass & Jazz Hand showed up. 
We stopped again at 1 pm to rest and refill our water bottles at a steam. Not long after we got going again, Two Tents, whom we met on Thursday, passed by us again.

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612305,"We wanted to get an early start this morning because the first four miles where all uphill with Chestnut Knob Shelter at the top. Our choices were between doing a long day (10+ miles) to the Mountain Garden Hostel, or stopping at the campsite at the bottom of the mountain after passing the shelter and taking two short days to reach the hostel. We knew the choice would become more obvious as the day went on.But even getting out of the camp this morning seemed to be a difficult task. With both of us working together, we managed to get packed and ready to go in just over an hour (by 7:15). It was about 50 degrees and windy, so we both had put on our gloves. That’s when I discovered that my phone was missing. Neither of us had seen it while packing the backpacks, so most likely it was still in the tent.
I took off the gloves and unpacked the tent. Sure enough. It was in the tent. I got the phone out and repacked the tent. So we were ready to leave now. Where did my gloves go? Oh no. Did they get rolled up in the tent? So I unpacked the tent again and rolled it out. No gloves. Finally found them safely packed in the backpack right where they are normally kept. But I don’t remember putting back. It’s good I did, but remembering doing it would have saved so much time, energy, and frustration.
We finally got going at 7:40, but stopped to get water at the first place we came to, as we’d planned, just .2 miles from camp. After that the real work began. The grade for the first 1.6 miles was quite steep. The last 2.4 miles were easier, passing out of the forest and going through long meadows, which gave us great views of the mountains in the distance. Woofie enjoyed herself as she motored up to the top, but I labored the whole way.
On our way to the top we were passed by Griz, West Country, Goat, and Early. They’d all carried on hiking before we made it to the shelter. We ate lunch there and took some pictures before heading down the other side of the mountain.
I felt much better going down the mountain. When we got to the bottom of the mountain, Woofie found a really nice place to camp with a spring near by. So, the choice was clear. Two short days would be way more enjoyable than one long day.","

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612312,"Before we left our camp this morning, we bid farewell to Happy Man & his daughter, who camped nearby last night.
Although today was a short mile day, we knew we made the right choice not push to the hostel yesterday. The trail, although not steep, was still difficult to walk with any speed or rhythm because of the rocks. It took us most of the day to cover the few miles and we were very tired at the end of it.
When we got to the road to the hostel, we met Fern, Bacon, Books, & Castaway. Fern and Bacon hiked on, but Books & Castaway wanted to go with us to the Mountain Gardens Hostel. We called for a ride to the hostel, and the owner arrived about 10 minutes later to pick all four of us and our packs up in his Prius.
We thought there was a store near the hostel where we could buy sandwiches and ice cream, so we hadn't eaten lunch yet. That turned out to be wrong. Instead Mark, the hostel owner offered us a pizza for lunch, which was even better.
Mark is an elderly retired doctor from England who bought a 100-acre farm and has in the last three years turn his farm house into a hiker hostel. He lives there alone and does everything himself. He even cooked us a fancy dinner, shrimp and scallop pasta Alfredo, and served white wine.
We had a great time with Mark and our two new hiker friends, Books & Castaway.","

I chose to keep my breakfast more traditionally American, so I skipped the fried tomato and baked beans, neither of which would I eat at any other meal, anyway. Mark took us back up to the trial head in his Prius, and we were hiking by 10:10. We stopped for lunch at Jenkins Shelter before starting a one mile climb. But after only a few hundred yard, we had to take our packs off where a tree had fallen across the trail. The only way through was for Woofie to climb through the downed tree, I passed the packs through one at a time to her, then I climbed through. It took us ten minutes to travel 10 feet. But that was followed by 2.5 miles of easy hiking that we did in one hour.We reached our campsite by 6 pm and found Books & Castaway already there with their tent up and meal cooking.

Bubba picked us all up and brought us to the Big Walker Motel. As we arrived, I saw that Mowgli was still at the motel. He’d been waiting for Goku to return from visiting his family so they can continue their northbound hike together.
While checking in at the motel, I met Saunter. He’d heard that we donated our last year’s supply of Clif Bars to the hiker box, and he thanked us.
The rooms here are very nice, and we like them better than the ones we had at Econolodge and Red Roof Inn in Marion. At least the rooms here have carpeted floors. Our poor hiker feet need the pampering of a nice soft carpet instead of a bare hard wood floor.","

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612427,"Yesterday in the morning we did chores - laundry, shopping, prescription pickup, and so on. In the afternoon we took Books & Castaway to Pearisburg to visit the Angel’s Rest Hostel.  That’s the place we’ll be basing our car for the next two legs of our hike.  The young fellow who greeted us as we pulled in turned out to be from where Castaway grew up. They didn’t know each other, but the guy and Castaway’s brother-in-law were best friends all through high school. How small is the world!
Today we shuttled Books & Castaway back to the Rt 52 trailhead. Then we drove to Wytheville to Cracker Barrel for breakfast. 
After that went looking for antique stores and accidently found the birthplace of Edith Bolling Wilson, the wife of President Woodrow Wilson.  It’s one of the stores right on Main Street, and upstairs was the home her family lived in and where she was born.  We watched a short documentary video about her, and learned she was an amazing woman.  She owned and operated a jewelry store before women even had the right to vote. She was the first women to get a drivers license in Washington, DC and own an automobile.  She married President Wilson after his first wife died and went on to establish a prominent role as First Lady, one that became the model for successive First Ladies.  She was even given the duty of naming newly commissioned naval ships as they joined our war effort during WWI. 
We never expected to get such an interesting history lesson while just walking around a town on an AT hike zero day. We really enjoyed ourselves. 
Tomorrow we’re getting a shuttle to a trailhead about 18 miles north on the trail, almost half-way to Pearisburg. It should take us two or three days to hike back to the car.","Big Walker Motel, Bland, VA

We started hiking south back to our car at 11:30 in the rain. It was a light rain, and as time went on it tapered off. Eventually the sun came out in the afternoon. 
We had only gone about three miles when we met Books and Castaway going north. They had gone twelve miles yesterday and stayed at a hostel overnight. Today they waited there for the rain to stop before heading out.  They’ll reach Pearisburg in a couple days. About that time we’ll be driving there, so we’ll be seeing them again. 
We reached the turn-off to the shelter at about 5pm. As we approached the shelter Goku, Mowgli & his dog Bronco were just leaving after stopping there to eat. It’s funny how we can meet the same people on the trail many times even though we hike much slower than the young ones. 
Tomorrow the next shelter is almost 10 miles from here, and there are no water sources along the way. So, I’ve filled all six of our water bottles for tomorrow’s hike. There is a tent site a couple miles short of that if we need to stop early, and our car at the motel is a couple miles past the shelter if we feel extra energetic.

The morning was sunny, calm, and in the high fifties when we started. Around 9am we stopped for breakfast, and a young 28-year old guy going the other way also stopped to eat. His name was Tripod, and he’s from Illinois. 
Once we got going again we met a young girl hiking north by the name of Burner. 
When we got to the campsite that was our first option for today, it was only 1pm. We had a nice lunch and rested about an hour, while also drying our rain coats and pack covers still wet from yesterday’s rain.  With only four more miles to reach Rt 52 and the burger place, we decided to choose option 3, the 12-mile option.

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612911,"On Tuesday morning after we had a great breakfast at Cracker Barrel, we drove to Pearisburg and got a room at the Holiday Motor Lodge instead of going to the Angel’s Rest Hostel that we’d visited last week.  The hostel was going to be crowded with hikers this week and weekend and even the people in rooms will have to use the community bathhouse. We didn’t want to have to wait in line to use a toilet or take a shower. 
The Holiday Motor Lodge is reported to be hiker friendly, which also means it’s a safe place to leave the car while we’re on the trail. The rooms got mixed reviews from other hikers. The main complaint was that things were old or run down.  We figured that maybe the motel used more run-down rooms for hikers, since they give hikers a reduced rate. So when we pulled in with our shiny car, wearing town clothes, we didn’t say we were hikers. We were happy to pay full price for a “nicer” room. Then Woofie asked about a discount for retired military. Sure enough. Got the nicer room and a discount. 
And the room was, to us, beautiful. Full of large ornately carved dark pine dressers and tables. Yes, old and out of style, but just what we’re used to. And the most important item, carpeted floors. We hate the new trend in modern motel chains where they’ve removed the carpets and installed shiny new bare hardwood floors. When we arrive with our sore hiker feet, bare hard floors are not what our feet need. 
We stayed two zero days to let the sore feet rest and return to normal. In that time we visited many restaurants and stores and got to see a lot more of the town and surrounding area than thru-hikers get to see. Tomorrow morning our shuttle driver will pick us up at 7:30 and deliver us back to the trailhead on Rt 606, Wilderness Road for a second time—this time hiking north back to Pearisburg.

Hiking was easy this morning with temps in the high 60s and relatively flat trail. 
After a couple hours a hiker passed us who was carrying a cat in a sack strapped to him at about waist height. The cat was a beautiful Birman and looked very happy to be cradled in the sack with his head sticking out so he could see everything as it went by. 
I hollered to Woofie, look at that. He’s hiking with a kitty cat. Then Woofie asked the hiker what was the cat’s name as they walked by.  But to our surprise, the hiker kept walking like we weren’t even there. 
Now, as most hikers know, if you don’t pick a trail name for yourself, someone else will give you one. Sometimes it’s not one you’d like to have. So, when the guy with the cat refused to give us a name for either the cat or himself, we had to give them trail names. To the cat carried happily along the trail in a sack we gave the name Bagpuss, after a children’s TV character in England. And to the impolite hiker who refused to acknowledge our existence we gave the name Sourpuss. 
As Bagpuss and Sourpuss disappeared into the forest, we bid them a sad and silent farewell. But we will still remember the two pussies we met today on the trail. 
Toward the end of the day we met hikers Monk & Ezio several times as we passed each other.  Monk is from Buffalo, but now lives in the Catskills area of NY. Ezio is from Canada. By his accent I believe he must be from Quebec. 
Woofie is hiking stronger after three weeks on the trail. Today we’d planned on going eight miles to the shelter and then seven tomorrow to the Woods Hole Hostel. But she covered the miles to the shelter by 1pm and wanted to go on. The next place to camp was two more miles and all up hill. It was very steep so we had to go slow. But we made it by 4:15. That leaves only five miles to get to the hostel tomorrow, which is good because we’re expecting stormy weather.

That meant not only that we could get packed up without everything getting wet, but also that we could take our time getting to the hostel. 
As it turned out, time was what we needed, lots of it. Although the elevation map showed a gentle five-mile downward slope to the hostel, the trail condition was very difficult. Much of it was rock fields such that every step was a puzzle to solved. The last mile, which also included a couple cliffs that required both hands, not poles, to climb down, took us almost two hours to negotiate.  We were glad to finally get to the road to the hostel, but so tired we had to rest 30 minutes and eat some snacks before walking the final half mile to the hostel. 
When we got to the hostel, we were greeted by Books & Castaway, who are not only staying but also working here. They’re staying here while Castaway’s injured ankle heals, and maybe even longer because they’ve found a bit of heaven here. 
Our “room” is a permanent tent on a raised platform. It has a porch with deck chairs on it, and the inside of the tent is furnished like a normal bedroom. 
Besides Books, Castaway, and Monk, whom we’ve met before, a lady named Birkie, a girl named Strider, a guy named Hot Carl, an old guy named Sweetwater, a couple named March Forth & Go Forth, and many others are also here at the hostel.  And Neville is our wonderful hostess and owner of the hostel, which was started by her grandmother & grandfather in 1986.","MayCampsite 620.5

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613445,"The Story of Pocket Pussy - Today we met someone at the hostel who had met Bagpuss & Sourpuss in town and took a picture of them. He said that the guy was a very nice fellow, and that the cat’s real trail name was Pocket Pussy. It turns out that the guy (we still don’t know his name) was probably hiking with earbuds in his ears and never heard us when he walked past us.  So, we’ve given him the new, kinder trail name, Boots. And we’ll refer to them as Bagpuss & Boots, because it has a familiar ring to it that makes it easy to remember. 
Later in the day we met Iron Man, a 79-year-old man from Birmingham, England. He’s hiked from Springer Mountain to the Woods Hole Hostel, 625 miles, without taking a single zero day. 
For dinner Neville made Birthday cake for Tribute. 
After dinner we met Mat in the Hat, who just retired from 30-year career as Navy medic and Onward, also a military retiree, both members of Warrior Expedition. 
Then we talked to Scribbles.  Last fall Scribbles, who works at the hostel helping Neville, stayed in the same hostel we did last week, the Mountain Garden Hostel, run by Mark. She stayed in the same bedroom we had. But she didn’t like her stay there. 
We stayed two zero days at the hostel, not only because severe weather and thunder storms were predicted for both days, but also because Woofie had an abrasion on her back where her backpack had rubbed the skin raw, and she needed a couple days to let it heal before putting on her backpack again.","Woods Hole Hostel

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613499,"With rains predicted to end by 9 am and Woofie’s back feeling better, we planned to head out after breakfast. But another three small, localized pockets of heavy rain blew through briefly between 9 and 10 am. When it was clear to go, we said our final farewells to Books & Castaway and the other friends we made while at the hostel and headed up the road back to the trailhead at 10:30. 
Our hike today covered 10.6 miles, but the road walks to and from the trail added another 1.5 miles. We knew we were getting a late start for a 12.1-mile day, a long day for us, but the terrain looked relatively easy, and the weather was nice and cool. 
We made fairly good time, about 1.5 miles/hr over the first nine miles, in spite of poor trail conditions. In fact, as I followed Woofie up the hill, I noticed that she was demonstrating the astronomical principle where more distant stars appear to be moving away from us faster than closer stars are. It seemed to me that the farther in front of me she got, the faster she hiked, getting even farther away in front...until she needed me for something. Then she stopped to wait for me to catch up. 
Although we’d avoided the two days of heavy rains by waiting at the hostel, we now couldn’t avoid the muddy, slippery conditions resulting from those days of rain.  And we didn’t avoid all the rain either. We had a few light showers during the day that we just ignored and walked through, like real hikers do. 
The last two miles were steep down hill, so trail that normally requires going slower was made even more difficult by the mud and slippery roots and rocks.  With the extra hour it took us to reach the road into town we got there by 7 pm and made it the motel, another mile of road walking, by 7:30. 
We got our room and after a warm shower and a Mexican dinner, we plan to relax tomorrow in our room, letting our sore feet recover.","Woods Hole Hostel 625.4

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613661,"It turned out that the steep, muddy conditions on our most recent hiking day took a big toll on Woofie’s ankles. So, we’ve been resting them here in Pearisburg until she’s sure they can handle the next section of hiking, which will be a 5-day hike covering about 40 miles.
I saw from the trail map that that the closest trailhead to our motel when we hike back southbound is a mile on the trail from the one we used going northbound a few days ago, which would leave a one-mile section unhiked.  So, this morning I walked back to the trailhead from where we road walked to our motel, hiked the mile north to the next trailhead, then walked that road back to the motel—three miles of walking to cover just one mile of trail. But it was a cool, sunny morning and the trail revealed a surprisingly beautiful waterfall, so it was well worth the trip. And now today was not a zero day, but a nero day (near zero).
When I got back, I met Mountain Fish, who’s in the next room, and later we took him to lunch. Tomorrow he’s going to trail days and has lined up a ride. But he has to come back afterward, because his phone died and his new one will be delivered here by the weekend. 
We called our shuttle driver, Don Raines, and are all set for him to pick us up tomorrow morning at 8 am.  He’ll drop us off at the trailhead at Rt 42, about a half hour’s drive toward Daleville.  It’s amazing to think that it’ll take us five days to cover the same distance on foot that the car to can travel in 30 minutes.","Holiday Motor Lodge - Pearisburg

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613889,"Our shuttle driver, Don Raines, dropped us off at a church pavilion near the trailhead at 9 am. The pavilion was convenient because a localized rain storm had popped up, but was due to last only another hour.  Funny thing about Don: every time he shuttles us to the trail, it rains.  With a name like that, what else should we expect.  We waited under the pavilion, nice and dry, until the rain stopped and started hiking by 10 am, planning to get to the War Spur Shelter, 8.2 miles away. 
As we hiked the sky cleared, and it turned into a gorgeous day. We crossed about a mile of farm meadows before reaching the forest. The forest was cool and moist from the fresh rains. 
When we got over the first small mountain and down to the valley on the other side, Woofie’s feet told her they were still unhappy. They made climbing down the steep rocky trail slow going and painful with each misstep. Then we came to the bottom of the hill and had to rock hop across a swift flowing stream. It was hard to find the proper path that would let us reach the other side dry. It took us both working together 10 minutes to get safely across. 
We got to the first shelter, Laurel Creek Shelter after just another .1 miles, and we stopped there for a lunch break. During lunch we realized that pushing on to the next shelter with sore feet wasn’t going to be the wonderful time we wanted for our hike. And with more storms forecast for late afternoon, we worried about reaching the next campsite and getting the tent up before the rains come. So we decided to go slow and enjoy ourselves. 
Step one: stop hiking, just camp here at the shelter, and hike to the next one tomorrow instead of today. Step two: soak the sore feet in the cool mountain stream near the shelter. Step three: enjoy just being here. We have lots of food and time, and it’s a peaceful and very pretty place.  We’re both much happier now. 
Later on as we were cooking our dinner meal and other hikers were arriving, I spotted a six-foot black guy getting too close to our tent. His trail name was Snake, Black Snake. I redirected him away from our tent with my hiking pole, trying not to anger him or make him feel threatened. It took several tries and about 15 minutes before he cooperated and slithered away into the woods. 
About an hour after we climbed into our tent for the night, it started to rain. It came down heavy for a while, but lasted only about an hour. We were happy and dry in our tent.","Rt 42 Trailhead

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614127,"We knew it was going to be a hot day, so we got started hiking by 6:50 am. Our goal was to reach the War Spur Shelter, which meant a steep climb up to Kelly Knob and then a steep descent down the other side. 
Just as we were getting to the peak, we met Rocket Man returning from the view point on the blue blaze trail from Kelly Knob. He said there wasn’t much to see because to tree foliage had blocked the view. We took the blue blaze trail to Kelly Knob anyway, since it was time for lunch and that’s where we planned to eat and rest.  Sure enough.  At the end of the trail was an outcropping of rocks that overlooked the valley, or would have if the trees were still bare. 
When we’d finished eating, I spotted another blue blaze trail on the other side of the campsite where we had sat to eat.  I followed it for only about 30 yards before I came to the real Kelly Knob, the one with unobstructed, beautiful view. 
Not long after we got packed up and starting hiking again, we met Map Man, who said he was hiking with his companion, Rocket Man. So we told him to be sure to follow all the blue blaze trails to Kelly Knob so he wouldn’t miss out like his partner Rocket Man had apparently done. 
Going down the other side of the mountain from Kelly Knob, Woofie’s feet began hurting her a lot, and we had to go very slow.  It took us two hours to reach a stream that was only 1.5 miles down from the top, leaving still another mile to the bottom and two miles to the shelter. 
We sat to rest at the stream, which turned out to be a strong spring that then flowed away as a stream. I was happy to get spring water that didn’t need to be treated to refill our bottles. Woofie was happy just to soak her feet in the cold water. 
At that point we knew that her feet wouldn’t let her keep hiking, so we hoped to just get down the one mile to the bottom where there was a road, so we could get off the trail. 
Just then more northbound hikers arrived and stopped at the stream. We told them we needed to contact our shuttle driver to pick us up at the road. So, Puddle Jumper, Moon Boots, & No Eyes offered to help by calling him from Kelly Knob, the only place with cell service.  We gave them his number and our names, and they said they’d call as soon as they reached the top and had phone service.
They hiked up and we hiked down the mountain. And before we could even reach the road, Don the shuttle driver came walking up the trail to collect us. 
The trail with its family of hikers and supporters is an amazing place. Thanks to hikers Puddle Jumper, Moon Boots, and No Eyes and to our shuttle driver, Don Raines, we were able to get off the trail and back to the motel where our car was in just a couple hours.","Laurel Creek Shelter

Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614727,"When we got back to the Holiday Motor Lodge, we got the same room we’d been in before, but we could only have it one night because it was reserved after that.  But that was fine with us.  We’d already decided that Woofie’s feet needed a longer rest than a few days in a motel would provide.  She knew it was a mistake to start the last section.  Her feet, although feeling better, were not ALL better.  I knew I had to take her back home where she could rest without feeling the pressure to hit the trail again too soon.
Before he left, Don our shuttle driver told us that we should drive to Catawba on our way home and stop for Sunday Dinner at the Home Place.  It’s an AYCE family style restaurant reputed to be the best place to eat anywhere along the AT.
We got there at 11 am sharp, just as it was opening.  The car lot was full and it looked like a hundred people were waiting to get in.  Turns out that Sunday dinner at the Home Place is also a favorite with the locals, who all head there as soon as church lets out.  Don had warned us not be late because it fills up fast on Sundays.  We got our name on the waiting list and were called to our table about 5-10 minutes  later.  What a meal!  Two meat dishes, four side dishes, bread and a beverage, all brought to the table in serving bowls just like at home.  And everything, besides being delicious and coming with endless refills, was only $15 per person.
So now we know that when we return to the trail, the Home Place is still in front of us, and we’ll get to enjoy it again.",,View Entry,"May 19, Sun",0
Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615154,"After a full week of rest and self-therapy at home, Woofie’s feet and ankles have finally begun to respond favorably.  Returning home was the right call.  Yesterday was the first day she could walk, albeit carefully, without pain. She still has a ways to go to be fully back to normal.  And whenever that is, she’s looking forward to returning to the trail, possibly in the fall, but definitely next spring. 
This year’s lessons learned: if you have a problem with gout, stay away from sea food.  Also, most importantly, listen to your body.  At our age recovery time is much longer.  So when something starts to hurt, pay attention to it.  Although we worked hard to prepare ourselves, strengthening our arm, leg, and core muscles for months before this year’s hike, feet and ankles don’t get their workouts until the hike begins, and they have veto power over all the other body parts where hiking is concerned.
Although this year’s hike was shorter than we’d planned, we still had a great time.  We found some terrific places to eat.  You can’t beat breakfast at The Barn near Atkins.  And the best burgers in the world are at the Brushy Mountain Outpost near Bland.  A great place to visit or even stay for a day or two is the Woods Hole Hostel.  Neville, the owner, makes everyone feel welcome and provides plenty to eat, including fresh-grown vegetables with every meal.
We’d like to give special thanks to the shuttle drivers that made our style of hiking possible.  Thank you, Rambunny, for shuttling us from the Mount Rogers Nat’l Rec Area Visitor Center, last year to the Grayson Highlands and this year to the Rt 42 trailhead.  Thank you, Bubba, who shuttled us twice from the Big Walker Motel, so we could hike back to Bland.  And thank you, Don Raines, not only for shuttling us twice from Pearisburg, but also for your guidance and help when we needed it.  Less than an hour after we decided we needed to get off the trail, you were there, our trail angel come to collect us.
Most enjoyable were the special people we met along the way.  We tried to include as many of them as we could in our journal this year.  Two guys and a dog that we met three times in three different places were Goku and Mowgli.  We gave them hiking kilts, and they promised us that our kilts would make it all the way to Mount Katahdin.  And the most interesting hiker was someone that we didn’t really meet.  He was the hiker that hikes carrying his lovely pussy cat in the sack of his shirt.  He wouldn’t talk to us as he passed by, but that just added a sense of mystery to the already unusual sight.  So, we’ll just remember them as Bagpuss & Boots.
On our first section hiking southbound back to the Mount Rogers Nat’l Rec Area Visitor Center, we met Viva.  Rambunny picked her up on our way to the Rt 42 trailhead, and we hiked along at about the same pace, meeting several times and becoming good friends along the way.  We last saw her when we shuttled her back to the trail from our motels in Marion, VA, so she could continue her southbound trek back to GA.

And most enjoyable of all was the time we spent with Books and Castaway.  We met them at the trailhead waiting for a ride to the Mountain Garden Hostel, where we were all planning to spend the night.  Somehow, Mark, the hostel owner managed to cram all four of us hikers and our packs into his Prius for the drive to his hostel.  With the exception of the seafood dinner that led to the end of Woofie’s hike, we had a fun and interesting evening all together.  Over the next few days we four formed our own small hiker bubble, winding up back at the Big Walker Motel again.  And then a week later we found them again, doing work-for-stay at the Woods Hole Hostel, where we spent two days waiting for severe storms to pass.  The hostel was a great place, but it was even so much better having our friends there with us.  We hope we see them again.",,View Entry,"Jun 01, Sat",0
Woofie & Wooly Booly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618754,"When I ended my last post with the wish to see our hiking friends again, I had no idea how soon that wish would be granted.  We went to our home in NY State for two weeks over the 4th of July holiday.  It was July 1st when we received a text message from March & Go Forth, whom we met during our stay at the Woods Hole Hostel in Virginia, that they’d just completed the Pennsylvania portion of the AT.
Since our place is only four miles from the AT, we texted back and offered to pick them up at a trailhead and shuttle them to our place to shower, do laundry, and resupply.  They answered and said they’d make it to Unionville, NY by Friday, but also had three other hikers hiking with them.  So, we extended our invitation to include the whole troop of five.  They said they’d camp at the Secret Shelter just .8 miles from the Unionville Rd trailhead, and we agreed to meet there at 9 am on Friday.
Our timing was perfect.  As I signaled to pull off the road at the trailhead, Go Forth emerged from the woods, followed by the others.  Besides Mr. Go & Mrs. March Forth (from Chicago) were Fire Ant (from England), Doc (from northern Virginia, and Chappy (from S. Carolina).  We piled the 5 backpacks into the back, and everyone climbed into my van.  When we got to my place 30 minutes later, everyone grabbed their packs and spread out their gear to dry out.  Then, of course, it was time for showers & laundry.
Our timing was especially perfect for Chappy, who had just broken his smart phone the day before.  As soon as the unpacking was done, I took Chappy and his hiking partner, Doc, into Warwick to the Verizon Wireless store to buy a new phone.  Chappy, a 68-year-old retired Chaplain, was so happy to be able to contact his wife and let her know he was all right.
We got back to the house just about lunch time, so Woofie & I took the five starving hikers to the Goshen Diner, well known for its good food and large portions.  And after lunch we took them all to the Price Chopper grocery store in Warwick to restock the supplies they needed for the trail.  We had a good time visiting the rest of the day while our hiker friends finished repacking their backpacks for the next day’s hike.
After a good night’s sleep indoors, Woofie & I loaded our hiker friends and their packs into the van for the ride back to the trail.  But on the way we stopped for a good country breakfast at the Country Dream restaurant.  It was converted from a general store that belonged to my Uncle from 1902 to the mid-1960s and has been a restaurant ever since.
By 9 am we returned the five well-rested and well-fed hikers to the Unionville trailhead, just 24 hours after I picked them up.  We had a terrific time reuniting with March & Go Forth and meeting Doc, Chappy, and Fire Ant.  We said our final farewells and they disappeared into the woods again in ones and twos.  Woofie said she had the best time ever thanks seeing all our old and new friends from the Appalachian Trail.",,View Entry,"Jul 13, Sat",0
