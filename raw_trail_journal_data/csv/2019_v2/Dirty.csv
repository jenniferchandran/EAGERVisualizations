Dirty,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608057,"Had a great hike up Springer Mountain and to the first stop. Unfortunately, the pain I started feeling in my shoulder before I started the trip was getting worse. Got it checked out and it looks like I have a neck issue that's going to take a while to fix. Very disappointing. I'm putting this trip on hold and will set a date to start again next year. More to follow- Dirty","Springer Mountain
