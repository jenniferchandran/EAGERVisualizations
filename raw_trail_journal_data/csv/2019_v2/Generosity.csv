Steve stepped on a rusty nail and cut a half inch gap in his left foot at the base of his great toe. The worst of it is, we haven’t even started our hike. Mercy. Thought about pushing my Garman SOS, complements of Jackson.  I cleaned and dressed Steve’s wound with iodine and applied antibiotic ointment and a bandage on it. At this point He did not want to entertain a lighter load or shortened walk. We’ll see. Carrying 35 to 38 pounds each. Way too much. Most of it is food and water. How heavy is a pound of ice cream anyway? We’re not out of the woods yet.  But then, we haven’t even stepped in them! Let’s see where this day leads us. Start of Day 1.","Route 7, Berryville, VA

Generosity,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615926,"The Blackburn AT Center houses trail crew and holds mtgs, seminars and retreats.  Chris B, Manager kindly offered plenty of trees to hang our hammock and good water from their well.  Along the way we saw maple, sassafras, hickory, pawpaw, tulip poppers and sumac trees.  Red raspberry, wild blueberry and wild grapes, mountain laurel, dogwood and ferns.  Nothing in bloom, except for bergamot, which I could only smell-amazing aroma.  We up-roosted a turkey and white tail deer, saw two black ants arm wrestling and a centipede walking 100 feet a second -much faster then me.  Drank from a stream shared by a frog, walked over rock cropping and through fields of fern. Passed several day hikers and some through hikers-Torch, Goodwill and Brock.  It was physically hard, but then the 1st day always is.  Ate oatmeal for breakfast, power bar for snack, pb and tortilla for lunch and instant something for dinner.  Drank pedialite after dinner drink and Ibuprofen for bedtime.  5 other hikers in camp. We set up one hammock which worked well until 2AM when I moved my sleeping bag to the picnic table. Birds up at 5AM. We rolled out at 6:30AM and on trail by 7:30AM.   No water for 15 miles! Need to pack all the water we can. So much weight.  But, I think I look thinner. :)","Route 7

Passed David Lesser Shelter and Route 9 at Keys Gap WV. Thought we might have to walk 3/4 mile to a local store for water, but found a stream of sorts. Steve found a tadpole in his water bottle, treated both with UV light. Let the tadpole go, not on our menu. Saw much of the same trees, including large wild cherry trees and one ripe cherry, which we shared. Lots of berry brambles and wild grape vines.  Walked over lots of rocks, using poles and keeping head down. Kicked a few rocks and bruised a few toes. but, I stayed upright on the trail.  Saw a half dozen thru hikers, mostly northbound and some number of day hikers again-so close to Harper's Ferry.  But, mostly this day was a walk by ourselves.  Enjoying the sounds of woodpeckers, wind in the trees, trees talking to each other and the clang of our hiking poles as it hits rocks.  But, I didn't expect the occasional hollow sound my foot makes when it hits the earth that lays over the life giving pipeline of the mountain, the pulsing arteries of the trees.  The roots offer an occasional foot hold on these steep down hill paths.  And, then there is the bergamot (bee balm) aroma again that stops you in your tracks.  We set up two hammocks for the night. A few bruised toes, bruises and blisters on my hips. Steve's foot looks good.  Night toddy of pedialyte and Ibuprofen.  All is good.","Blackburn AT Center

Generosity,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616199,"Pulled up our solo camp in the woods and headed into Harper's Ferry with our packs on. Stopped at the AT Headquarters and had our picture taken for their book. Part of the AT uses the C&O canal. Lovely contrast; river, train, town and footpath.  Walked 3 miles on the canal tow path before ducking into the AT trail to climb 700 vertical feet on rocky terrain before the rain set in. Walked the ridge with a pack cover and rain coat to Ed Garvey Shelter where we stayed the night. Great two story open shelter. Hung our hammock on the roof rafters.  Shared the upper level with 3 other hikers. Had to walk 0.4 miles down a steep path to get water.  Dropped the UV purifier and broke it! So much for purifying our water.  Met 3rd Timer (GipCGirl), a delightful 72 yo Austrian woman hiking the AT for the 3rd time-thus her trail name. Met Lisa and Theresa on their 1st day of section hiking, and Monk who is a thru hiker working on deep listening.  Everyone is on their own journey. Ate chicken in a bag, string cheese and pedialyte for dinner.  I don't think I am feeding Steve enough, but he does not complain.  Ibuprofen, then off to the hammock. Must be 6:30PM--hiker's midnight. Close to 8:30PM 5 other hikers arrived at the shelter, sounds like Torch and Goodwill and others. From the sounds of this lively group, they are young, fast and funny. 9:30 rain continues and all are tucked in.","Primative Camp, South of Harpers Ferry

Same outfit, different day.  Ate cold oatmeal and dry fruit.  Walked on the ridge over slick jagged rocks that demanded respect. The rain stopped. Walked thru Gatland Stare Park and then back into the forest. The forest was misty and magical.  Passed tall ferns, large mountain laurel in bloom, and vibrant green moss blanketing tree trunks. Heard the chirps and trills of song birds and felt the vibration of a wood pecker in the forest.  ""Hello old tree"".  ""Hello young one"".  Ageless in the forest. 
Need to replenish food supplies tomorrow.  Plan tuna for dinner and breakfast again. Need to do a better job feeding this boyscout.  He is master at reading the environment, identifying trees, plants, animals.  
Feeling a little unsure about this trek, but found solace in Spenser's comment ""if it is scary and hard, you are on the right path"".  And Murdock, recalling a bumper sticker he saw on his bike trip around the country, ""Don't believe everything you think mom"".  Bless my little gurus.","Ed Garvey

Most folks on the trail by 7AM. Walked 3 miles to the road and 2.2 to a fresh fruit market, they offer nothing I could consider for meals along the trail.  So, we walked further into town, nothing open!  Walked 2 more miles to the other end of town to a Weis grocery store. Met 2 delightful 74 yo New Zealand couple riding their bikes from Miami to Toronto!  Oh, The People You Meet (Jackson's next book).  Tired now having walked 7 miles with a light pack and 5 more to go once we are back on the trail to the next shelter.  Weather is threatening rain. Not looking forward to more miles with a loaded pack.  Got 2 fresh peaches and enough food for the next 5 days; that makes 10 more pounds to carry each. Mercy. While I shopped, Steve made phone calls outside the store and secured a ride back to the trail head from a woman named Cathy who has family in Woodstock.  She saved us 4 miles of a road hike. At the trail head we saw Theresa, tearful and leaving the trail after 3 days.  We gave her a fresh peach and stayed with her until ha shuttle came to take her back to Harper's Ferry.  We finished our lunch and started on the 5.5 miles to Pine Knob Shelter.  We walked thru Washington State Park.  This was a hard hike for me with a fully loaded/overloaded pack.  I was cramping and tired. Had to stop in the park and took a quick nap before heading out again.  The terrain was rolling with 800 ft change up and down.  Wild roses in bloom. Saw a doe tending her fawn and a turtle in the path. Lovely section of the trail, just too much weight.  Skipping breakfast is not recommended.  Arrived at Pine Knob (elevation 1385 ft) to find Lisa all by herself.  We set up our hammocks and tarp outside the shelter and helped Lisa with her tent.  Got water from the spring and drank it as it was because I broke the UV purifier earlier.  The dinner was fine-cold and right from the bag, but that is 2 lbs that I do not have to carry tomorrow.  Chatted with Hurricane, a lovely bloke from NZ walking the AT for 3 months, averaging 20 miles/day.  
Steve took off his bandaid on his foot...completely healed! That boy is amazing. No opening, just a scar.  Put on a new bandage on for protection and went to bed.  7:30PM, hiker's midnight.","Rocky Run Shelter

Generosity,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616203,"Using Awol's Guide 2019 Northbound to select campsites, factoring in elevation, pack load and general sense of well-being. I had hoped for a 15 mile days, but opted for an 8 mile day.  It looks like we average around 1.5 miles/hour.  We break break 20 minutes mid-morning and take 30 minutes for lunch.  Weather factors in whether we opt for a shelter or set up in the woods.  Shelters generally pack around 8-12 people and amazingly most leave by first light to get back on the trail. As Murdock says, ""you have nowhere to go and all day to get there."" (lessons from his bike trip).  For thru hikers who started in Georgia, this is close to mid point in their hike, many now average 12-20 miles/day.  For now, on our 6th day, we need 12 hrs of rest to recover from 8 hrs of hiking.  
Birds once again graced the forest with their song.  There was mountain laurel in bloom and the scent of wild rose and honey suckle which stopped me in my tracks once again.  The path was rocky...truthfully, we had to rock hop and bolder scramble. But, we stay upright!  Every foot placement is intentional and the pace is slow.  Rain is threatening and expected during the night.  We arrived at the shelter, tired.  Saw our AT family, Lisa who now goes by Echo because her laughter echos thru the camp, and the delightful and funny brothers NoBro1 and NoBro 2, both in their mid 60s. and their buddy Moonwalk.

Generosity,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616323,"It pored during the night. Torrential rains.  Heard a hound bark.  Thought about bears.  Everyone in the shelter uses the bear poles at the shelter to hang their food items.  No citing of bear on our hike thus far, however the thru hikers have many stories and evidence of bear attempts on their food canisters, though most of these encounters with bears are from the Shenandoah National Park.  We were snuggled in our hammocks on the second level of the shelter under a aluminum roof. Though it rained all night we were warm in our down sleeping bags with liners.  Clothes hanging from rafters to dry or air out.  If you have been wondering, this is now 7 days without a change of clothes or shower.  The forest is forgiving.  We planned to hike 14. 5 miles today to the next shelter, but it was raining when we got up and no plans of it letting up.  Everyone got up anyways, first light, breakfast and most start with a plan but let the day decide their fate.  
Today's hike was through the rain.  We were wet and cold.  We start out the rainy day with a raincoat on and then after 30 minutes we are more wet from sweating, so the jacket comes off.  The pack stays covered though. Don't want out sleeping bag or hammock wet.  That would make for a miserable night.  We walked up 1000 ft on rocky terrain and through a field with power lines. We stopped at a shelter for lunch to be out of the rain and then kept going.  The hike down hill was rough.  Bolder scramble, rock hopping.  Only, no one was hopping.  Careful and slow and still we fall.  At least, Steve did.  Strained his left knee, not that he complains, but it is evident.  We had to continue just to get down the mountain. PenMar Park is next on the map.  we came into PenMar Park just as the rain stopped.  This is the park where my niece Suzie married her love Troy.  Again we saw Echo who is taking a zero day to meet up with friends.  Met Denis S, a delightful gentleman who works at the park and offers rides to hikers.  He suggested a hotel and gave us a number of a person who would drive us there.  It did not take that much convincing-cold, wet, tired and now hurt. Great choice the day has made.  We were ab;e to shower, wash clothes, and go out to eat.  Only I got sick after eating dinner. Go figure, after eating camp food, and drinking the mountain water, I got sick from the dessert.  It is not that I overate either.  Steve and I got one entree each and shared a dessert. Had a good night sleep and in the morning, with Steve still stiff, it was an easy decision to take a zero day. Saw GipCGirl in the lobby getting breakfast. She is moving on. We will await Jackson, who is off today, Friday, as it is more convenient for him to pick up his dad today.  Looking forward to a visit from Jackson, Rachel and Josie.  The plan is to go out to dinner with them.  They will take Steve home where he will resume work and I will continue on the trial for 93 more days, unless the trail has other plans for me too.","Ensign Cowilll Shelter

Steve was a great partner; patient, accommodating, keen and knowledgeable about the environment and easy with people. HipCGirl was still at the hotel so we got a ride together to the trail head! Did I just meet a trail partner?  I hiked with GipCGirl, a 2 time thru hiker on a section hike this year. We walked a half a mile on the wrong path before we realized it, laughed, turned around and got back in the trailhead. Just her way of teaching me a lesson on what to do in this instance. I listened to great stories about Australia, Papa New Guiana, South Africa-all of which have been home to her. There was stories about dream time, elders, and stars. We walked on a soft moist pine-laden path thru thick forest. We came to Tumbling Run Shelter and found  the young newly married Professor who taught English in China and will return to Japan to join his wife who is teaching also.  More deep conversations about prejudices, social injustices and life.  Had lunch, napped, dinner.  A DC hiking club cam into the shelter to offer trail magic—fresh fruit and a beer.  Then off to get my water from the spring, hang near bag, prepare my camp for rain in the morning, then journal writing and to bed.

Generosity,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616823,"Hand in hand we ran barefoot in the grass, my Baby Girl and I. Then I woke up and hiked up 1000ft right out of camp, soft rain, slick rocky path, struggling with every breath and muscle cramps, but I still could feel the hand of that precious little girl of mine, Spenser, and I loved every minute of it. Still hiking with GipCGirl who knows the trail like the back of her hand. Trying to conserve water because there is no water for next 10 miles.  Once on the ridge, the path was soft pine laden with stretches of molders that demanded your full attention. Feeling heavy with 2.5 liters of water and wet gear. Crossed power lines fields and an occasional road before tucking away into the forest, traveling a narrow path under the canopy and feeling like a mole.  I do believe one could navigate the world without major interaction with the general populace.  Thank goodness the people on the trail are genuine, interesting and kind.  
3 miles before the shelter ran into trail magic again, this time in Caladinia State Park.  Hamburgers, hard boiled eggs, chips and Gatorade! Perfect timing-having a headache from dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.  Outstanding group of amazing trail angels who get together in the park to offer this to hikers. Then another incline hike to the shelter.  The last stretch was like coming home- eautiful green tall Rhdodendrum archways and stone steps. It didn’t matter that it was another 250 feet incline, one couldn’t help but smile.  Freshly planted flowers graced Quarry Run. There was David, the Trail Runner, to greet us and gently remind us of the principles of ‘Leave no trace’.  I set up my hammock in a thicket of rhododendron. Hydrated well at a running spring. Chatted, mashed potatoes, ramen noodles, took med for headache, and went to bed.  Listening to birds and a running spring.

Walking with GipC Girl. Such a delight. Professor is behind with a badly blistered toe. Rain last night and in the trail. Pack cover on, rain coat comes off after 30 minutes.  More wet inside the coat from sweating.  Might as well get a shower while walking. 3rd day wearing same clothes.coming into pine, pine paths, few rocks which give my toes a break. Slight path diversion due to reforestation. Mountain laural now with pink variety.

Walking @ 1.5 miles/hr. Taking every 2 hr pack-off breaks for 10 min, lunch for 30 min. Tired of peanut butter. Trail angels (elderly couple sitting in their car just tickled at hikers response) on the path-cooler with soda and bags of chips. 
In camp met darling 16 year old boy, with a full head of hair, hiking with his 75 year old grandpa. Grandpa, a thru hiker of years past, goes by the name Snail.  I offered a new trail name for them-Tortoise and the Hare. It is always up to the hiker to accept or decline a trail name.  Also met March Forth and her husband Go Forth. Professor came limping in. Such a beautiful laughter he has. Met Doc, a walk onto the set of Gray’s Anatomy. Could easily be a walk onto Fifty Shades!  
Same routine. Bed as early as possible to recover from the day. Others hikers, usually those who hike 20 miles, come in after that.

But the additional liter I am carrying with wet clothes, pack, tarp make for  a heavy walk. Still with bruises and blisters on my hips and a sore right clavicle. Toes are better but they still let me know they are there.  My shoes are heavy and I now have mole skin on my right ankle where my shoe rubbed. Seems that is the only place I have lost weight!  Gentle terrain.

Came into Pine Grove Furnace SP where I have reserved a camp spot near the bath house.  This is a day of rest. I waked a half mile to the park and set up my hammock. Rain is called for tonight. Went back into town to the General Store which cateres to hikers. Most hikers long for this store to take the half gallon ice cream challenge. Not for me, even if it is my birthday. Went to the AT museum. Relaxed. Ate a sandwich at the General Store and was ready to walk the half mile back to my camp site when I hear 2 delightful and very tired thru hikers (Biscuit and MacIver) asked at the general store where they could camp. The State Park office is closed. There is a shelter out of town aways.  The hostel is full. I offered my site which has more space then I need.  Another thru hiker (Bear Bait) came thru with the same situation.  When I offer her the same, Biscuit asked what my trail name was. When I said I don’t have one, “Generosity” she joyfully shouted. And, there it was. I got my trail name.  Gen for short. Better than “Flat Tire” offered by Steve because I was behind him struggling to walk up the hills.  I’ll take Generosity thank you. 
And true to her name, Bear Bait hung her bear bag containing her food directly above her hammock.  As she said, she wants to make sure no bear gets her food. She'll fight them off first. She has bear teeth marks on her tooth paste tube as proof. And so it goes.

Don’t you recognize me. I am your brother. Come through me so that I may squeeze you, hug you, love you and gently spank you and that’s exactly what he did. Happy birthday to me again.  There were 4 knolls and at the top of each knoll were great boulders. Each time squeezing through them, climbing up them and sliding down, once with the pack off. At the last summit, there were deep caverous rocks and I smelled bear.  The sky opened up with torrential  downpours. It was a lovely walk down the gentle-slopped mountain all by myself. Soaked to the bone, feet and socks, pants, shirt and phone not working; all wet, concerned about blisters. Walked through open corn, soy and wheat fields. Ate blackberries from a tree in the rain. Met Josie, Hazit (SA colloquialiam for 'how's it goin'?), both from Johannesburg SA, and Tin Can on the trail.  In town stopped at the ATC Mid Atlantic regional office and had a salad at a local diner. Rain is expected all evening and through the night. Decided to stay at a hostel to dry out. $20 plus $3 for laundry.  Josie and Hazit stayed at the hostel too. The ‘hostel’ was a shed with bunks in it, dirty, musty and cluttered.

On the trail by 7:30AM. Steve made a quick visit last night to bring me items from home and take me to the store for resupplies.  It was nice to see him and Floyd. New meaning to trail magic.  My body is getting familiar to the routine.  After I get dressed and eat, my body starts to sweat just looking at the pack.  I have to get on the trail quickly.  The moment I step foot on the trail, I instinctly take a deep breath. Today was a beautiful day. Walked thru fields, along the river and up and down mountains.  Got water from a stream and filtered it.  I always announce myself before going into the forest with a click of my walking poles, but the animals already know. Birds change their tunes, squirrels scamper, and, the bears and mountain lions, well they make scarce.  Shared the path with many weekend hikers, joggers and Boy Scouts.  Saw Big Heart who got him name because he asked God to help him love everyone he meets on the AT and there was Circuit Rider, a 7 time thru hiker who is on the trail for his 10th time, who sees the trail as his ministry. Saw Robin Hood, Sand Pig and Dundee and many more. There was West and his 4 legged companion Scout, and met up with two young gents, Little Bear and his buddy, A Little Bare who celebrated the summer solstice with a sunrise service and nude hike back to the trail.     
Arrived at the shelter.  Met Brass Compass, a gentleman with a pressed shirt who spent his life collecting compasses and reading maps, none of which he brought with him on the AT.  Lovely shelter.  The spring is 300 stone steps down the mountain from the shelter.  One hopes to make the trip to water only once.  Plan enough water for tonight and the morning.  Going to bed early tonight.  Hiking 12-15 miles a day is enough for me, not to include the trips to get water.  The trail tomorrow goes into the town of Duncannon, PA. I had planned a meal there (lunch) which allows me to eliminate one meal to carry.  That would be called a Hero Day, where one goes off the path to a town, then returns on the path that day.  A Nero is hiking to a town and staying the night.  A Zero is when you start in town and stays there.  There will be some of each during this hike.","Holiday Inn, Carlisle, PA

Last night at the shelter was hilarious.  I decided to experience shelter living, sleeping on the floor in the shelter with the other hikers, just because. Normally I hang my hammock outside the shelter. One of my biggest concerns prior to starting this hike was about the mice and rats reported in the shelters-mice that eat into your pack and run across your face at night.  I thought about bringing Lysol.  This shelter was newly built, two stories, with a loft.  Shelters are three sided structures with an open front. No amenities. But the picnic table is often in front, under the roofing system.  Hikers hang their backpacks on hooks, nails or whatever they find, put their food bag in a bear box or hang on a bear poll in camp and sleep on the floor wherever there is room.  Others sleep in the vicinity, in tents or hammocks.  Shelters offer a gathering place for the hiking community after walking all day, a primitive privy and a roof over their head.  After eating my tuna dinner, chatting with Brass Compass, Strider and Mo, I set up my 6-inch foam mat and down sleeping bag in the loft, and went to bed at 7:30PM.  Tuck away, quiet, silent and listening to sounds. Shortly after that a group of young gent hikers arrived.  These are the thru-hikers who are doing 20-25 miles a day. They are fast and furious.  Setting up their place in the shelter, eating dinner, their conversation was about their journey, food, facial body hair and dildos, but mostly about dildos.  Then the young gals arrived and the conversation changed.  Most of us spend our life trying to be a presence and have a voice.  There is something to be said about being present, silent and listening.  Not the same as being silenced.  I slept poorly, the foam pad was not meant to say under me and the down sleeping bag barely enough to keep my face off the floor.  Ugg.  Had a stuffy nose for the first time and a headache.  However, no mice or rats were to be seen.  I will stick with my hammock but will miss the conversations from the fast and furious. 
 Lot of ups and downs on the trail today-geographically speaking.  Woke up 5:30AM.  Brass Compass already on the trail to get breakfast in Duncannon, a town that the trail goes thru.  In lieu of breakfast, I get on the trail too.   Met a lovely town girl doing yoga on the rocks before I headed into town, a 3 mile, 1,000 ft, hike down the mountain.  The trail goes thru an old economically depressed town with 6 bars, 4 churches, 2 funeral homes, one 'massage' parlor which is open all night long.  Stopped into Goodies for breakfast.  Sat with Mo, Strider and Brass Compass who was on his second feeding.  I ate a pancake, 2 eggs and sausage. That was enough.  The Professor came in, a member of my first AT family!.  I was happy to see him.  He was taking a zero today and staying at the vintage Doyle Hotel. He said it was like the Hotel California and he hopes he will be able to leave.  He is newly married and his wife is in Japan teaching English. She talks about the cuddle cafes, where people can go in for a cup of coffee and lay down with someone to cuddle; a basic human need not being met in the busy crowned living conditions of Japan.  The Professor is on the trail because this was a commitment before he got married. He made his point.  Does he really need to see this hike thru? I sat with him for a while.  He said GipCGirl is a day ahead and traveling fast. It is my hope to catch up with her.  Left Goodies early afternoon and continued thru town, on the trail, saw a large wooden-carved standing bear in a front yard (what is a journal of the AT without a  bear citing), crossed over the Susquehanna River and then 1,000 ft up to another mountain.  Walked the ridge, still under a canopy.  Saw rabbits, frogs, birds, and chipmunks.  Small pine, oak, maple, mountain laurel.  Walking by myself on the ridge and felling good, outside of being full from breakfast.  No rain, moist, humid and an occasional breeze.  Simply lovely.","Cove Mnt Shelter

Hiked by myself, often feeling like I am the only one in the forest/woods.  Given 30 minutes however, someone passes you.  There is the general 1 minute conversation.  ""Hey.  How are you doing today?""  You already know from clues that they are either a thru-hiker or a day-hiker.  You can also tell if they are new to the trail or have already hiked over 1,000 miles.  ""What's your trail name?  Where are you going today?""  ""Happy trails"" is the established code for 'good day'.  You catch their energy and hike a little faster for a while, then resume your usual pace.  Peace.  Carrying enough water to get me to the next spring on the map  Springs running red; lots of iron in these mountains.  No problem, just a little extra for the diet.  Feet hot from the down course.  Stopped to take off shoes, wet feet in spring, powder them and put on wet socks again.  Saw mountain laurel at end of their bloom, one rhododendron near-bloom! and a wild rose.  I could always smell the rose before I see it.  Saw 2 chipmunks and a rabbit scamper across the path.  Besides the rocks and mud, the path is clear and I feel comfortable with hiking sticks as they grace the side of the trail and can protect me from any snake in the side path.  It is quiet, no rain, no wind.  I hear birds, and I heard a leaf fall. Really.  And, I heard 2 distinct clicks and then a rattle and picked up my pace down the path.  Sounded like a rattle snake to me.  Click click goes my hiking sticks.  
I expected to be tired today from hiking 12-14 mi/day for the past 3 days.  Planned to stay at a primitive campsite; no water, no privy. No problem. You pick up water at the previous stream, enough for the night and 
your hike out.  Next shelter, 5 miles away, too far when you are hiking 
tired.  This campsite is reported to be haunted by a Native American who family was violently killed.  No problem, my plan is always one of peace. 
Came into the primitive campsite.  There way a gentleman there, hammock half set up, camp fire going!.  ""Hey, how are you doing today?""  I ask.   I already know that something is not 'usual', whatever usual is on the AT.  ""What's your trail name?""  No trail name.  I'll call him 'Just Em'.   ""Where are you going?""  No going anywhere.  Flip flopping on the trail means back and forth from place to place, North to South, town to trail, trail to town.  Generally a term understood as 'homeless'  ""I have never had a campfire going when I came into camp, this is nice"" I said.  He was pleasant enough.  No different then most, but definitely not the fast and furious.  More like quietly disturbed.  He was oddly familiar. There was no cell service, but I did take pictures and texted Steve, even though there was no cell service and he doesn't read text in any timely manner.   After 30 minutes Strider and Buck with Mr. White, his 4 legged companion, arrived to camp.   They plan of staying!   They set up their tents and we all sat around the camp fire while they smoked their smoke.  Young Buck is hilarious!   And, Mr. White is tender and non-judgemental.  We all talked, swapped lies and laughed.  We were later joined by Circuit Rider, the hiker whose ministry is the AT.  Circuit Rider was gentle in his questions to Just Em.  He addressed him by name and chatted with him a while, while I went to my fortified hammock--bear spray, Garmon SOS, pocket knife, whistle, phone, and thoughts of peace in this haunted site.   I prayed for the Native Americans who knew this place as home and the homeless man who doesn't recognize it.","Peters Mtn Shelter

Well, I woke up.  Which means I made it thru the night.  There was a torrential down pore all night long.  I stayed dry in my hammock.  Strider and Buck were wet in their tents and did not sleep. Mr White did not complain.  We all packed up, including Just EM.  Strider, Buck, Mr. White and Circuit Rider are fast hikers and were off. 7AM.  Just Em said he wanted to go into town and resupply.  I told him I was going into town and had a shuttle arranged to pick me up 9 miles down the trail at a cross roads.  I was near certain that this would happen, but because I was unable to call out on my phone to confirm with the shuttle driver, I was left me with uncertainty.  Just Em offer great certainty when he said ""Don't worry, I am going to hike straight today"".  Holy s..., I thought, at lest one of us will be because my mind is racing a mile minute.  
The path was mucky from the night rain.  Shoes were muddy and wet.  Rocks lined the path demanding respect.  Just Em led the way.  I encouraged him to walk on, but he stopped when I stopped.  He talked incisively.  He knew it.  ""I am talking a lot.  I am off my medicine and need to get to a dispensary before I get agitated"".  He has a medical marijuana card.  He talked about his parents, mental illness in the family, his upbringing, his girlfriend, his life, his work and ADAH. He wants to help the homeless.  He gets angry at the greed.  He cannot work more than a few month because of other people creating problems fr him.  He cannot keep a job.  He quiet school because of issues.  From my line of work and experience with people, I am all too familiar with this scenario. It is so much more than ADAH.  Every time he went off on a tangent, I reminded him of a saying Murdock saw on a bumper sticker ""Don't always believe what you think"".  He would laugh  He understood completely.  
He asked what mountain laurel looked liked.  I showed him.  He talked about plants, mushrooms and poison.  It is amazing what the forest absorbs.  I did not feel uncomfortable or unsafe.  Just compassion for a struggling soul.  We stopped at Rausch Gap Shelter to regroup.  Just Em hung out his wet tarp for drying, ate a spam sandwich which looked appetizing and smoked his smoke.   He changed his socks and shoes from boots to sandals.  He is doing better than I, I thought.  I just got water from the spring and drank.  It was just past 9AM and we did 4 miles.  5 miles to go.  Looking or an opportunity to call out to the shuttle drive to confirm a ride into the town of Pine Grove, PA  were I have a room reserved at the Quality Inn.  
My hiking companion and I continued down the trail, circumventing the beaver damn with an alternate AT trail identified. That eliminated forging a knee-high river. Just Em continued to talk.  I continued to listen, offering  ""Don't always believe what you think, Just Em.  That is your mantra."" He would laugh.  My calf was cramping, making it hard to walk.  My toes were sore.  Just Em was compassionate and slowed his pace.  I had cell service at the top of the mountain and was able to confirm a 12:30PM pick up for transportation into the town of Pine Ridge.  I fronted the $20 for the ride into town. Just Em offered $20 to stay with me at the hotel, but I declined.  He was going to look for a church or hostel.  I know there is no dispensary in this little town.  We parted ways.  He thanked me and said he enjoyed walking with me.  He hopes we will walk again.  I gave him a hug.  ""Be well Jut Em, peace, and don't always believe what you think, especially if it disturbs your peace"".","Yelow Springs Campsite

9AM Got a ride to route 183 to get back onto the trail from Pinegrove. Passed a Hindi Ashram. Planned a leisure 6 miles to the next shelter because I am carrying heavy-4 days of food and water. Feeling pretty good from the previous day of rest. Met a trail maintenance crew along the way, Adventure, Terry, Scott and, Young One. I crossed paths with one southbound hiker but otherwise was in the forest all by myself. Often in the periphery of your vision you see and hear things but when you turn there’s nothing there. I swear there are elves in the forest.  Came to Eagles nest Shelter at 1:30 and took a leisurely lunch. There was a log by the stream that looked perfect for sitting only I saw a snake slide into a hole in the log. He kept his head visible. Not this time snake.  The mosquitoes, gnats and flies were bad. There was 9 miles to the next town that offered hikers a pavilion to sleep In. That meant I needed to do 9 miles and preferably get out of the woods before dark. The path was relatively flat (139) but still with plenty of rocks, stones, logs and mud.  I decided to go for it. I picked up my pace and continue to kick plenty of stones. I was still able to see wild flowers in bloom, and I’ll be darned if I didn’t catch that little elf (photo). I was out of the woods by 6:30PM and came into the lovely town of Port Clinton where I went right to the pavilion, passing a train yard, a girls softball practice session and children playing in the park. There was no running water at the pavilion so I bathe in the nearby river and filtered the water for drinking. At the pavilion was Wink, a thru hike, who was struggling to get pizza delivered to the pavilion. He plan on taking a zero tomorrow.  He finally got his pizza, wings, warm soft cookie, cinnamon buns and soda. Peace. He slept on the picnic table and me in my hammock, under the pavilion, under the stars, in the park, in town.","Pine Grove

Left the ‘pavilion’ in the town of Port Clinton where Wink and I spent the night and headed to the post office where I could catch a shuttle that takes hikers into Hamburg to the worlds largest outdoor store, Cabela’s.  I am looking at new shoes as mine are falling apart. On the way to the post office a town woman asked if I was lost and where I slept last night. “No, not lost”, I told her  “I slept at the pavilion”. She said the pavilion is uptown, that I had slept in the park. Fancy that.  That would explain the strange looks and the feeling I had of being homeless.  At Cabela’s I bought new shoes with the wide toebox. The toes on the left foot are still numb and bruised. I also bought a new shirt for myself, since I only have one hiking shirt that I wear day after day,  and one for Josie that I will send home at the post office. I took pictures of their wildlife display. Sad and beautiful. Back in town, I went to the post office and then started back on the trail climbing over 1000 feet with a steep grade of 491. On my own and drenched again. The trail was rocky and, once on the mountain ledge, there were more rocks,jagged and loose. I saw a Flipper, Strider, Buck and Mr. White. They said several hikers left the trail because of problems i.e. concussion, foot problems, fractures and strains from the rocks of PA. The rocks are not so different from VA, WV and MD. My guess, it is a combination of mid hiker’s blues and fatigue.  I’d like to stay on the trail for 65 days, so I will set this intention.  Got water from a spring along with a frog and snake. We all have to drink.
I planned a leisure 9 mile hike to a family campground where I could get a shower. There are two trails that lead 1.5 miles straight  down the mountain to that campground. The blue trail is rocky and muddy but direct and the yellow trail is 2 miles longer along the ridge but less rocky with only a short steep descent.  I plan to take the yellow trail. But, just as I approach the blue trail cut-off I get an alert on my phone “flash flood warnings in effect for this area”.  It’s 6:30 PM and I decide to take the blue trail. The blue trail was indeed rocky, logs on the path and no switchbacks; straight down the mountain. It was no stranger to flood waters and it was getting wetter and wetter by the minute.Soon I was walking through through a stream.  In 45 minutes I was down the mountain safe but a little hobbled. My feet were moving around in the shoes and the sole, unlike my previous boots, did not disperse the impact of the rocks across my foot, rather I felt every rock edge.  I limped to the office to secure a tent site. I may have to see three days through to heal my foot and ankle. 65 days on the trail, that includes 3 days in a hammock with my foot elevated.  Doing great.","Port Clinton-pavilion

The total grade is low so there’s no ups and downs. This seemed most doable with a sore left foot. What I didn’t know is that this is a stretch known as the  Knife’s Edge.  This is a section in PA where the rocks are vertically squeezed to produce the ridge, an edge where you can have 1 foot on one side of the mountain and the other foot on the other side!. The trail does not go around the boulders, rather it goes over them. It is so interesting!!  I am so grateful that it is not raining today. I’d hate to fall off the mountain. These boulders scrambles went on for miles!. Spanked once again.  Hello my brothers. 
Several hikers past me and everyone of them complained about “them rocks”. PA is notorious for all things that sting, snakes, ants, wasps, spiders and rocks.  There are a lot of hiker injuries reported in PA, largely because hikers don’t slow down a bit. In PA I have seen wasps and wasp nest at shelters. Gnats dive bomb my eyes, flies buzz my ears and mosquitoes snack on my neck. I’ve heard a rattlesnake and today I saw a black snake moving slowly across the path where a fresh pile of bear scat lay.  I am doing fine. I talk to everything in the forest, even the rocks. There was a thru hiker I pass the other day called Stone Turtle because she moves so slow. I thought I saw moss growing on her back. I’m just one step ahead of her.
I continue to hike by myself.  After the knife’s edge I was lying down in the forest on a rock my feet elevated against the tree when Tiger Lily came along. Tiger Lily took a couple days off to visit with her children. She is trying to catch up with Shock Top, a fast hiker. We chatted for 15 minutes. There is something sad about her.
I continued on the trail and stopped at the first shelter for lunch. There were more wasp and no water. I looked at the registry and saw that GipCGirl passed by earlier this morning!  With any luck I will catch up with her. I continued on the hike, and eat some peanut butter down the trail.  Water is in short supply so I need to get to the next shelter. 
Arrived at the next Shelter around 5:30 PM.  The shelter was small but had running water from a spring. Several hikers were hunkered down already. And, there was GipCGirl! It was great to see her. She said she left messages at another shelter asking me to call her but I never saw those messages. If the shelter is too far off the trail, I’ll just pass it up and continue walking. We caught up in conversation. I filled up my bottle and bladder with water from the spring that I didn’t feel the need to filter and drank freely.  As the shelter was right off the trail and in a steep bank, there were no trees for me to hang my hammock so I hiked back up to the ridge and found a campsite off the trail. There was an interesting thru hiker, Back Track. Last year he threw hiked New Zealand, the north and south island, and this year he is thru hiking the AT. He said he worked in his 20s and now he’s hiking in his 30s. He had a bowl of fresh blueberries that he picked along the trail, right at the spot where I spotted the black snake and the bear scat. No wonder I didn’t see the berries. He had a picture on his phone of a big rattlesnake that he saw the other day. I asked him if there was anything that frightened him on his hikes and he said only people who are not in their right mind. He smiled softly when I asked if he was afraid of me.   He normally stays away from the shelters and camps In the woods. We shared the campsite. He ate his blueberries and I ate my tuna. Then we called it a good night. I will catch up with GipCGirl at the shelter in the morning. We plan to hike out together.","PA 309 Trailhead

Stopped at the diner for breakfast and the server told us that Shock Top is off the trail because of infected blisters or two others are off the trail to. Looks like Tiger Lily will catch up with her after all. We left our packs at the diner and walked into town for a five day resupply of food at the Dollar Store.  I sTopped at the library and had a photo shoot at the puppet play house. Thinking of Spenser. We sat in the park and waited our ride to Filbert’s B&B in the next town of Danielsville, PA. We plan a two day respite. The bed-and-breakfast is a lovely old General store/ Victorian farmhouse.

Test got her trail name when she accidentally set off the SOS alarm and didn’t realize it until it was a helicopter flying above them.  Challenger got his name because he worked for NASA on the Challenger. They are trying to figure out if they THRU hike and get to Main before Katotcin closes, or do they ENJOY hike. Two different mindsets and two different approaches.

Ready to experience the beautiful White Mountains of New Hampshire.  GipCGirl and I caught the slow cog train to the top of Mt Washington, a majestic 6,288 ft weather defying giant in its own right.  Weather is extreme and unpredictable at Mt Washington, but today was a clear day with lots of visitors. It was 30 degrees cooler at the top and I got a pair of gloves and a hat for added warmth. Alpine zone here we come. We started down the AT toward our first hut, Lake of the Clouds. The trail is composed of layers and layers of granite and schists boulders that were formed from catastrophic events millions of years ago. The salt and pepper appearance of the rocks, from deposits of minerals and crystals, shine in the sunlight and give the mountain its white appearance, thus its name.  
Hiking in NH is different than any other state that the AT goes thru.  In NH the Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) regulates camping in the Whites. Huts are for available by reservation and a hefty fee ($90), but they offer a bunk, dinner and breakfast. No camping is allowed above tree line or within the vicinity of a hut. The huts seem to serve day hikers and paying customers.  We thought it would be worth the experience. Usually thru hikers on the AT stop by for lunch and can eat left over food or pay $2 for soup, or they can ‘work for stay’; that is, if there is a small chore to do, they will be able to eat left over dinner and sleep in the dining room after the paid guests have gone to bed. We made reservations for the night at the hut, so over the large monstrous boulders and hugh outcropping of bedrocks we go and hike down 1,282 ft to the hut. We passed day hikers going to and from the hut; bolder hopping and happy, only we were slow and happy. Along the trail are fragile flowers and sensitive tundra vegetation. Around the hut I see tiny bunch berries (Canada dogwood), Mtn Wood Sorrel that looks like a shamrock, and a flower that grows only in this area...name escapes me! 
This hut houses 90 guests and we stayed in a 12 bunk room housing men, women and children.  There is a staff of 7 young adults who climb up the mountain to bring supplies down to the hut on a wooden back frame pack. And they carry trash up the mountain for disposal. The huts are self contained. Solar energy, treated well water, compostable toilets, no showers. Reminds me of the community huts in Nepal. 
We had soup, salad, home made bread, lasagna and dessert and saw an amazing sun set.  I asked one thru hiker why he was on the trail and he said that he had spent the first part of his life looking for answers and the later part of his life giving answers, but now he was on the AT looking for questions. What? That one was for free. 
There is another reason hiking in the White Mountains in NH is unlike elsewhere on the AT. In the White Mnts the AT trail takes on many other trail names and is usually not marked with the familiar white blaze.  It is easy to get lost in the Whites. GipCGirl has been in the Whites 5 times now, as it is her favorite place to hike.  Only once did she get lost and that was on her way up Mt Washington during bad weather. She could not see the kairns or the path and arrived to the summit cold and exhausted hours later having gone around the other side and straight up the mountain. Many people have died in the Whites. I use AWOL 2019 AT guide book and Gut Hook’s electronic guide that uses GPS, but none of that is helpful if you are off trail. Having GipCGirl as a trail guide and hiking mentor is priceless.

Washington over the many years.  The terrain is a mixture of monstrous boulders and out croppings of bedrock and treeless tops and, boreal forest with sparse trees and narrow flumes.  And there are sections of hummocky; deep dark moist fern forest, as if elves might pop out from behind a tree.  Quite a diversity.  
At MItzpah hut there is a great community.  Staff and mostly day hikers.  Thru hikers on the AT come by and often grab a bite to eat or barter 'work for stay'.  There was a large youth group of girl hikers.  I quietly told the staff that GipCGirl is a 2 time thru hiker that would love to talk to the group of girl hikers.  We got free dinner--enchiladas and chocolate cake.  She did a great job.  Everyone attended her talk.  She entertained questions such as, how long have you gone without a shower, have you seen snakes and bears, and do you use sun screen. How do you answer that and not turn the girls off from hiking? 
There we stayed at a AMC campsite and paid $10.  There were some annoying black flies but GipCGirl is gone in her tent and I am fine in my hammock with its fly net.","Lake of the Clouds

The hike a 2.5 miles straight uphill, follows an old logging railroad. We cross over rocks and rivers, through balsam fir and white birch woodland. I use the birch bard to write a love letter that is best left behind. There is ground cover/understory of mountain wood sorrel, Clinton is and hobble bush. We hike through open wetlands and meadows. Still I have to negotiate with rocks, make peace with no switchbacks and celebrate the sweat. The rocks are the tough part but I have taped my foot and it is feeling better.  Once on the ridge, just over 2,000 feet, we cross over flat rocks and bolder hop. Once off the ridge, there is a steep descent down to the meadow where beautiful bird song continues and streams flow. It is quiet. The path is pine and bark-ladden and soft with occasional roots to offer a foot hold. But there is one large red pulsating root that was evidence of its life giving nature.  We met 3 day hikers, sat and chatted and ate a snack.  There were frogs croaking in the lake/tarn and moose scat on the trail as we approach Zealand hut. At the hut we met other thru hikers; one disillusioned and discouraged with lymes disease. I offered iodine to two other hikers with inflamed  mosquito bites. Our dinner included 15 bean soup, salad, vegetarian lasagna and lemon pound cake. It rained heavily during dinner and I hear the stream raging.

Needed shoes on to step over rocks safely.  Water pooled in places, but still raging in others. Took pack belt off just in case if I fall I will not be dragged down with the pack.

Everything is wet.  Rain coat, pack cover and rain skirt on.  I like to say I look cute, but that is not the case, though the pack looks lovely in its red rain cover.  It is chilly, arboreal and alpine zones.  After much effort and only only 6.1 miles we decide to stealth camp.  Clothes are wet, but night clothes, hammock and sleeping bag are dry.  We hang our clothes in the trees with little luck of them drying.  Rain has stopped for now, but it is humid.  Went to bed without food, that takes more effort, besides breakfast is still holding me.  Looking forward to the hike out tomorrow to meet up with sister Rita!","Zealand Hut

There were day hikers which is usual m when the hut is so close to the road. Rita got overheated, so off with clothing. We all took our shirts off.  Some of us had an under shirt! Some didn’t. Drinking water to say hydrated, we continued our climb. Through dense northern hardwood forest, over rocks and streams that tumble downward from the mountain and over wooden plank bridges. There are flute like songs from the birds, red spruce and balsam fir. The scent reminds me of Christmas. There is sheep laurel, related to mountain laurel, and mountain ash with red berries and beech trees.  Just lovely. 
As we approach the hut there is a lake, well, technically a ‘tarn’; a mountain pond scoured out of the mountain side by a glacier. 
Once at the hut we see Hanna from the Zealand hut. We unload our packs and take a walk around the tarn. Back at the hut Rita chatted with Long Legs and Denali, two thru hikers in for a bite to eat.

There is a kitchen that the caretaker uses to make blueberry pancakes every morning for the hikers, and  every hiker knows that. There is a covered porch with rockers, a lovely dining room with a huge fireplace, and upstairs is a bunk room that holds around 20 bunks. It has such an old and homey feeling up to it. Outside there is a privy and a makeshift kitchen for the hikers. Down from the cabin is a large goose pond that is perfect for swimming on a hot day which is exactly what Rita, GipCGirl and I did.

Oh Julia! Now that quieted the sting. 
The Wiley Shelter was built in 1940 and sits on BSA Camp Siwanoy property. We set up our camp outside the shelter.  There is a privy of unknown type. On the AT, privies are either a composting or moldering type. A moldering privy is one you can pee in.  In the privy at this shelter, down in the ‘pit’ is a symphony of wasps, so my guess, it is a ‘composing’ privy.  You get stung here, you’re sure to belt out a few notes.","New Milford

Generosity,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620277,"78 degrees, clear skies. We pulled up camp and started walking at 6:30AM. By 8:30AM we had walked 4 miles.  I love the soft morning light that finds its way through the forest. The trail is largely flat.  There are so many gnats, flies and mosquitoes. GipCGirl has taken her mesh shirt off and turned it into a mosquito net hat!  I was thinking of doing the same with my underwear, but...
We walk through fields and over fences. At the road is trail magic. A bin of gallon sized spring water bottles and a purple marker. Thirsty, I first color GipCGirl’s braids as she pours water into her bottles. As luck would have it, the trail angel appears. Poof. “I’m Carolyn”.  She was happy to see that we used the purple marker.  It turns out that she and GipCGirl share similar heritage, she offers to drive us up the road to get coffee and then on to another trail-head closer to the another shelter. We happily oblige her. We were not so keen on the next shelter as it had bad reviews. This allowed us to move ahead.
The RPH Shelter is next to the road. It is a cinder-block building with one wall removed. It has 6 bunks, none of which are worth sleeping in. We set up camp next to the shelter. At the shelter is a woman who appears ‘down and out’, homeless on the trail like so many others. She doesn’t talk to us or look up. Soon she is off to the woods. I clean up the shelter and throw away open containers of food. Jerry comes by. He is a volunteer caretaker and has planted many trees and flowers on the property.  We eat our tuna and settle in for the night. Rain sets in. We are all where we are.","Wiley Shelter

Generosity,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620281,"We pull up camp and are on the trail by 6:30 AM. It is hot. The woods are open with dry stack stone walls, remnant of the civilian conservation camp. There are similar plants, trees and bird-calls as home.  There are two boys sleeping in the woods. It is so great to see this.  Up on the ridge I am reminded of the White Mountains with the sweet sweet smell of home. Sure enough we come to the Shenandoah Mountain. It is painted with an American flag. Pretty, but still it’s graffiti. We passed some NoBos who remember GipCGirl in PA. We come off the ridge to Canopus Lake in Fahnestock State Park.  The state park allows AT hikers to camp free for one night in the ball field. It is stifling hot with no shade and no trees for my hammock. The for pay  campground is half a mile away. I have to walk 1 mile on the road to the park office to get a campsite and a mile back. This is as close as I am to heat stroke. We get to our campsite, set up, hydrate more and get to bed. Tomorrow is another day.","RPH

There are plenty of AT family around. One hiker, Highway Man, is addressing 15 postcards to home for friends, family and grandchildren. I offload a few stamps I have been carrying around. That accounts for .001 ounce. It all counts. Tomorrow we plan another zero day at the campground.","Fahnestock State Park

There we see Max our divinity hiker who is on a pilgrimage from Boston to Harpers Ferry and then out to California to raise money for children in Africa. He still has no sleeping bag and no tarp. He sleeps in a liner and uses a hypothermic space blanket as needed. He is so precious.
It starts to rain so we go back to our campsite. Soon the rain has let up but everything is wet. I pull the shower curtain from the bathhouse and 'reupholster' our picnic table with the intent of returning the curtain before we leave. It works well. Tomorrow we plan to go to Graymoor spiritual life Center where we will end our hike.","Fahnestock State Park

Generosity,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620321,"We pull up camp early anxious to go to our last destination. “Are you hikers?  I have been looking for hikers.“  Joe is a delightful well intended gentleman. He wants to cook us breakfast. We settle for coffee and conversation. On our walk back to Canopus lake, approximately 1 1/2 miles from the trail, we run into North?, a section hiker that started a day ago. “ Thank goodness, other hikers.  Where is the trail?”  It is 9 o’clock in the morning. She is hot and sweating and layered in dark clothes, one and a half miles going nowhere. She is carrying way too much weight.  In conversation, she got off the train and headed this way the other day and intends to be on the trail for one month.  Poor darling is confused.  I have done much to prepare for this journey. I have read several books, looked at several maps, had three paper maps and one online map to guide me.  I talked to thru hikers and owners of supply stores. Then, I had Steve walk with me for 10 days to help me feel comfortable and safe on the trail. Still, for me, it would have been a whole different experience, and not a favorable one, if GipCGirl was not on the trail to guide me. I would have been as lost and confused As South?. GipCGirl walks down the road with her to guide her. “When you come to the white blaze, turn left. Turn left.” she says. We can only hope.
We get a ride to Graymoor Spiritual Life Center where I had hoped for a relaxing end of this trail. We start at the gift store and look at items. I think of my mother. I bought a small book and asked the sister behind the counter if she would bless it. She said she was not able to bless it but the priest at the chapel could. Then as we leave she says “God bless you”. I reminded her that she just blessed me and I thanked her. 
Graymoor is a huge complex.  The AT trail goes through the property. Hikers are allowed to camp at the ball-field for free. There is a pavilion, a shower and privy. We set up camp and relax.
We decide to order dinner and it is delivered to us along with the two beers we asked for. The delivery man reminds us that this is an alcohol-free spiritual center and he knows because he lives at the sober house.  It was so refreshing. Forgive us all.","Fahnestock State Park

Word definition:   Slack Packer-someone who takes the load off you so that you can hike unencumbered.  
As I was walking through the Graymoor Center looking for Mary to slack pack me I ran across South? sitting on the ground with her pack beside her looking forlorn and exhausted. “It’s you again” she said. “I see you made it this far. Good work.” I say. “Do you know where to camp?” I ask. I could not tell her that tomorrow will be our last day.  I’ll just have to ask Mary and NoBo to keep an eye on her.","Graymoor Spiritual Life Center

Generosity,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620344,"This is what I learned from 65 days on the trail:
Great things happen in small steps.I like the contemplative life, but I love meaningful interactions with people.Happiness is a decision as is suffering.  I choose the former.Fear is a useful tool which can serve to motivate one to greater understanding and preparedness. But, if brought into the moment, it is immobilizing and often destructiveIf you are not satisfied with an aspect of your life, change it. If you cannot change an aspect of your life, change the way you think about it.I love my children furiously.I prefer every action with intent and purpose.I am funny, kind, generous and loving.I can set boundaries and accept limitations.If you sense a hotspot, i.e., issue, address it now before it festers.When I step out of the forest after four days without a shower, it is only when I encounter another person that I stink.I am not shy or timid. I am, however, quiet. There are just some people with whom I choose not to engage. If I have nothing but the wet clothes on my back, I am still loving and funny.If I have nothing but the wet clothes on my back and I am tired, hungry, and thirsty, I am grumpy. Leave no trace, but leave story. Promote peace. Support justice. Encourage health. Bring laughter.If your load is too heavy, let go of things. Don’t sidestep obstacles. They are part of the journey. They are your brothers. Make peace with them.","
