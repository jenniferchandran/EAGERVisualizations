Two Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609064,"I’m back in Roanoke to pick up where I came off in 2015. I’m looking to do another few month stretch before Emily gets done teaching for the year. The past 4 years have been fun, but more and more I wanted to be back out to give it another try. 
Being in Roanoke is a bit surreal. I checked a bag on the plane, the same one I bought 4 years ago to carry my stuff home. It will be donated to the hotel tomorrow. I needed to buy stove fuel; there is an outdoor shop nearby that I didn’t need before. In Walmart buying groceries instead of the duffel bag. 
I bought way too much food; about half will be left behind; no sense in carrying 12,000 calories for 3 easy days. 
The hotel room gear explosion is all too familiar. My pack base weight at 25 lbs is almost exactly where I started 4 years ago. 
New tent, sleeping quilt, and sleeping pad. More bulky but less weight so my pack seems over full. Not sure where I’m adding the weight other than a larger battery pack. I suspect I will shed a few pounds over the next few weeks, not including body fat. 
I’m excited and apprehensive at the same time. I know there will be figurative highs and lows and I know how low the lows can be. 
This stretch I want to focus less on the towns. I’m not going to pass up an opportunity to get clean and fed but don’t want to always be searching for the next stop. I also want to enjoy the social aspect a bit more. If I can slow down or speed up to spend time with other hikers I am going to do so. 
Since I’m coming off around Memorial Day I also don’t want to focus too much on the miles. I’m going to try to avoid thinking of how far I get but rather that I have about 60 days to make the most of. 
Tomorrow I go back to near Trents Grocery and begin a 3 day 27 mile stretch. I’ll take 3 days to ease back into it and also to get 2 nights out for a gear shakedown.",,Roanoke VA,"Mar 28, Thu",0
Two Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609223,"I was up in Roanoke early this morning with my usual hiker impatience. I got packed up and called for an Uber at around 8am. About 9:30 he dropped me off at the road crossing near Trents Grocery. A few pack adjustments and I’m off. 
A little bit of steeper uphill and then the trail was mostly easy uphill. I could feel the weight of my pack but overall felt pretty good. A mile or so in I took the side trail to see Dismal Falls. It would have been a nice place to camp or have lunch but not 30 min into my day. 
After another 6-7 miles I came to Wapiti Shelter and stopped for lunch. The first hiker I met was a southbounder from Boulder. He had picked up the trail in Pearisburg and was on his second day back. We talked a lot about mountains; he had done Aconcagua as well. 
We talked of easing back into miles but his easy was about 12 miles and I was figuring 8-9. That would give me 3 similar days to Pearisburg. As he walked on I looked at my watch. 2 pm is an early time to quit and I didn’t particularly want a big uphill to start day two. 
Shouldering my pack I walked up the steeper trail. About a mile into it I stopped at a spring and filled and carried water the rest of the way to the dry ridgeline. Heavy end to day 1. 
I set up camp on the ridgeline, ate some food and still had about 3-4 hrs until dark. Overnight I slept warm. I hope my quilt isn’t too warm for the trip. 
Other than that, all is well.","Trent’s Grocery (ish)
",Ridgeline Stealth Campsite,"Mar 29, Fri",10.60
Two Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609225,"As mentioned, I slept pretty well on my first night out. A few raindrops but the tent was dry when I packed up. I was probably walking by about 8 am. Not surprisingly the trail on the ridge was pretty rocky and I couldn’t get a good pace going.
About 5 miles into my day I met my first northbounder Flash. He had started 35 days ago so was putting in big days. He was headed to Woods Hole Hostel and I pressed on. 
Around lunchtime I arrived at Docs Knob Shelter, my original stopping point for the day. Only seven miles in though so this would only be a lunch stop. At the shelter were Sharpie and Whip. They maintain the section of trail that included this fabulous shelter. It was a shame I wasn’t staying. Benches, chairs on a deck. They even gave me a Mtn Dew as my first bit of trail magic. 
After lunch and conversation I moved on. Steady down and steady up for then next 5-6 miles. I passed a popular overlook and saw quite a few day hikers out. Just beyond there I set up camp next to a spring. 
Shortly the Honeymoon Hikers showed up. We chatted over dinner about all the trails they have done; at the end of this hike she should have the record for most AT thru hikes for a woman. 
Overnight it rained and got damp and cold. I was still plenty if not too warm in my bag.","Ridgeline Stealth Campsite
",Stealth Campsite,"Mar 30, Sat",12.80
Two Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609251,"Town days are usually interesting. You want to get clean, do laundry, resupply, eat, rest. Sometimes that is easy And sometimes you think you are working harder than the trail. So if possible, I prefer an easy day (short miles) into town. Given where I camped last night, today would be an easy day. 
It rained pretty hard last night so I lounged in my tent until about 8am. Packed up the wet tent, ate a Snickers and took off. A bit of easy uphill then down to town on a great trail. I got to Cross St and took a right to the motel after about 0.7 miles of downhill road walking that don’t count as AT miles. 
I’m staying at the same motel as I did 4 years ago. They do your laundry and the store is right across the street so easy town chores. 
Tomorrow starts a stretch where I need to be diligent about my progress. I started to think about the uphill walk back to the trail, so grabbed a bottle of water and walked back to the trail, went another mile or so along the AT to Narrows Road and then back uphill to the motel. 
A 3 mile round trip to save 1 trail mile tomorrow and to walk downhill back to the trail instead of uphill. With a full pack loaded with 5 days of food, hopefully that will let me push a bit farther tomorrow which will help with my next stretch, a 68 mile section I hope to do in 5 days. I have to climb about 2,000’ tomorrow am. I hope my stroll today makes that a bit easier.","Stealth Campsite
",Pearisburg- Narrows Road,"Mar 31, Sun",3.50
Two Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609812,"Note:  I’m writing this a bit ahead. I’m in Daleville with a sprained ankle. Resting up to see if I can continue. 

I know that the folks who started in GA have had it worse but it was chilly starting out this morning. Probably in the upper 20s. 
I was glad for the easy downhill start as I could warm up without sweating which would ultimately make me colder. After a bit through the woods I walked across a bridge and past a chemical plant and then began a fairly long uphill stretch gaining about 1500’. The trail was gentle and steady which I like and I popped out at the Rice Field Shelter for an early lunch. Soon after the Honeymoon Hikers showed up and joined me. 
After the snack we walked along a ridge which forms part of the VA/WV border for about 10 miles. Great cool weather and great views to both sides  
I had intended to camp on the ridge but the HH encouraged me to walk down to the next shelter and camp with them. So what was to be a 15 mile day turned into a 19 mile day. Not counting the mile back to the trail  
We arrived at the Shelter and I set up my tent next to the HH. Had oatmeal for dinner and then went to sleep quick. 
Coming down from the ridge could have been when I sprained my ankle although it didn’t start hurting till the next day.","Pearisburg- Narrows Road
",Pine Swamp Branch Shelter,"Apr 01, Mon",19.30
Two Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609821,"I slept pretty well in the tent overnight. The HH and I woke up around the same time, broke camp and started walking together. They were typically making more miles than me so I only hiked with them part of the day. I knew this before the trail, but the folks I see early in my hike are doing bigger days so in a week will be a day or two ahead of me. The hikers I would expect to see regularly are probably a week behind. Sad to see the HH move on; they gave me good guidance and potentially kept me out of an unsafe condition. So we hiked the first uphill together, along a ridge, then a drop and another climb. After the second climb the HH moved on and I leisurely walked to the shelter. Since the weather is good I set up my tent although no one else was there. A few notes:Although on the map this day had two 1000’ climbs my total elevation gain is 4,649’. There is a lot of uphill on the flat ridges and some uphill in the downhills. I’m not sure I’ll get used to camping alone. Every rustle seems like a bear when it is likely a squirrel. Camping in a group may be a false sense of security but I feel that I just need to be a less attractive opportunity than the next guy.","Pine Swamp Branch Shelter
",Laurel Creek Shelter ,"Apr 02, Tue",18.50
Two Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609827,"after the fitful sleep I was up and walking. So far I have been up around 7 and walking by about 8 am. 
I had 4 easy miles of downhill walking. Through some cow fields and across some roads. I then passed the Keffer Oak tree which is supposed to be the biggest along the southern AT. Looked like a bunch of big branches that are going to break off someday. 
My mistake for this day was not watering up before the next climb. Only about 750’ up and 5 miles of ridge. Well, the ridge was rocky and in most places solid rock. It was very fun technically but warm and tiresome. My 1L went to half, then I was drinking a few swallows every mile. By the time I came off the ridge I stopped at the first seepy spring I came to and filtered and drank about a half liter. Further down the hill I stopped at a shelter and got several liters and had lunch. The problem with no water is that I don’t want to eat either so it was a double whammy. 
A bit further on I filtered and carried 3L of water up the hill to a ridge. The trail at the top of the ridge is an old road. There was a flat spot on the trail/road next to a bench so I set up my tent. I had a really nice dinner sitting on the bench and had a good nights sleep in the tent. 
Note:
Although there is always the next hill, I seem to enjoy ending my day with a climb. Ridges tend to be breezy and more comfortable sleeping so long as I can find a flat and rock free spot.","Laurel Creek Shelter 
",Bench at Brush Mountain ,"Apr 03, Wed",16.80
Two Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609833,Today was a weird day. I slept well on the ridge and was up and packed early. The first bit of trail was the ridge road so was easy walking. I stopped and saw the Audie Murphy Monument. He was the most decorated American soldier in WW2 and died on this ridge in a plane crash. After this initial downhill I began a long and tiring uphill toward the Dragons Tooth. In some places the trail was manageable and others required using my hands as well as feet. You actually top out and head a bit downhill to get to the Tooth. The Tooth is this rock rib that juts out. I climbed it 4 years ago but was too tired to trust my balance this time. So I just ate my lunch and started down the other side of the ridge. I had been on this section before. There are a number of steep ledges and in some places iron bars to use as steps. Spicy with a full pack on. At the bottom is a road crossing with a gas station one way and a hostel the other. I had assumed to stop but:1.  There is a pesky 6 mile section between here and the start to McAfee Knob. A few years back Emily and I drove between them and I just didn’t want to hike this bit. Especially to start tomorrow. 2. Forecast shows rainy by the morning. I didn’t want to be in a warm hostel and be tempted to stay an extra day. 3.  I felt I had enough food to press another two days. I was going to stretch 5 days of food for 6 days which meant I wasn’t eating enough but that was expected. So I got a soda at the gas station and pressed on. The next 5 miles had a few ups but mostly easy walking. I then passed through the parking area for McAfee and went another 2 miles to the shelter. I wanted to stay in the shelter for the rain tomorrow. I was the only one there so could spread out.,"Bench at Brush Mountain 
",Catawba Mountain Shelter,"Apr 04, Thu",20.30
Two Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609837,"As forecasted it started raining overnight but I was dry in the shelter. It rained all day so no photos. It was easy to pack up from the shelter. I put on all my rain gear. Opened my umbrella and started walking. My ankle was hurting pretty regular by this point. Depending on how fast I could walk I could either have a long 18 mile day or a short 8 mile day. I walked slow. No views of either McAfee Knob or Tinker Cliffs, two of the most scenic parts of the trail. I had been to McAfee before so wasn’t a huge deal. A lot of big rocks to scramble up and over and down so slow going and hurting the ankle. I got to the next shelter by around noon and decided to stay. The shelter wasn’t as nice but was dry. I set up and took a good nap but spending 6 hours laying in my bag was pretty boring. Finally I had dinner and officially want to bed. It was still raining as I went to sleep.","Catawba Mountain Shelter
",Lambert’s Meadow Shelter,"Apr 05, Fri",8.40
Two Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609839,"I slept very well in the shelter. It was very foggy when I woke up and I was a little damp. 
Easy to get up and about. The trail was generally downhill but I gained 1,355’ for the day. There were some massive rocks and quite a few overhanging. Some were big enough that you could set a tent up underneath and I saw one group that did.
Also meant some more hand climbs and drops and strain on my ankle. 
The skies cleared and became sunny. Lower down I started seeing day hikers and the trail was gentle. Crossed under a lot of power lines and then walked out to a busy road. Crossed the road and checked into the hotel. The shower felt nice after 6 days out.","Lambert’s Meadow Shelter
",Super 8 in Daleville ,"Apr 06, Sat",9.40
Two Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609842,"today was supposed to be a rest day but strong storms are forecast for tomorrow. So I figured I would hike easy today and rest tomorrow. I also wanted to see how my ankle would feel with lighter weight. 
I got up and about and called for an Uber to drop me off on a dirt road in the middle of nowhere. Thankfully he had picked up and dropped of hikers before so didn’t think twice. 
About 2 miles before the trail was a locked gate. So I got to add 1.5 bonus miles to my day on a route that seemed to be just below the trail. My gps track for that section looks really weird. I could have probably accessed the trail from a better road I found out later so will have to do that to pick it up again. 
Again theoretically a downhill day but still gained 1,522’. Soon enough walked back to the main road from the other side and back in the hotel. 
Rest day tomorrow. I may seek out a dr to look at my ankle and an outfitter to see about slack packing the next few days to keep the weight off my feet. It is slightly swollen and I can feel it grinding a bit when I flex it. Not good signs.","Salt Pond Road
",Super 8 Daleville,"Apr 07, Sun",7.80
Two Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610012,"Today was my rest day, but I still walked a lot. I walked over to a strip center for a haircut. Killed some time in a grocery store and then went on a quest for shoes. I had it in my head that maybe I needed new shoes. I went to two different outfitters looking for the shoes I normally hike in. I finally found them at Fleet Feet in Roanoke. My feet felt better in them but they typically feel OK in my crocs. I would give them a shot tomorrow on what should be an easy day. It started pouring rain in the afternoon so was glad to be inside. ","Super 8 Daleville

Two Step,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610015,"My easy day was very hard. 
I was really hoping that my ankle would ease up today. The trail was supposed to be a mellow relatively flat 13.8 miles. I had to walk about a mile to get to the trail so a total of 14.8. Light pack and my go to shoes. 
The first few miles were hopeful. Then I had a relatively steep climb and the pain was back. I stopped at a shelter after about 4 miles and my Achilles stiffened. 
For the next 2-3 hrs my pain level went from about a 2/10 on flat ground to about 8/10 on uphills. My Achilles was grinding and popping (it has done this for the past few days) and I could never get a strong Step off my right foot. 
My hike took a bit over 6 hours; I was 2 hrs ahead of my ride. I walked up and laid down on a bridge railing. 
My left Achilles is about the diameter of a dime. My right is about the size of a quarter. The advice for a sprained ankle is light exercise. Exercising a strained Achilles usually doesn’t end well. 
I’m calling it for this trip. I’m sure I could have done more to strengthen my legs but I feel this is just bad luck. I’ve had enough good luck, so I feel OK. 
Since I have been using gps, I have tracked my statsMy 141.2 trail miles took 150.6 gps miles the extra was waking to from roads, shelters and waterI gained and lost 31,462’ over that distance  if I say half up and half down I averaged just under 8% grade each mile  I walked a total of 150.6 miles in 67.4 hours in 11 hiking days  averaged 6.1hrs per day hiking 13.7 miles for 2.23 mph  Thanks for following this short effort!","Salt Pond Rd
