Stopped at Trent's Grocery for a couple sub-par hot dogs. Stopped at Dismal Falls, really nice spot. A log across the river led to a nice camp site.

Just before the shelter there were a series of short switchbacks. Coming around one I see this big timber rattlesnake about 6 feet in front of me on the trail rattling and looking ready to strike. Shaking like a leaf I backed up around the bend to give him space. After a while I walked back down the hill. The snake was just off the trail but when he heard me he started rattling again and looked at me. Of course I waited to pass until he finally made his way into the woods.

Sandman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613240,"Today I decided to end my AT journey. My brother picked me up at the highway 42 intersection near Newport, VA. It was a very hard decision to make but one I had been thinking about for a few days. I struggled with the thought of going home, in fact the haircut/beard trim and new sleeping bag were indications I was driving on. I could say my knee, my feet, numb shoulder/fingers, Virginia rocks, rattlesnake, missing family, all contributed to my decision but that would be disingenuous. Honestly, I just wasn't ""feeling it"" anymore. It was quite an emotional decision because I love the trail, the people, the culture, and the beauty but hiking became a chore and I didn't want it to be. I appreciate the wonderful support of family and friends both on and off the trail.  Maybe one day I'll finish the trail as a section hiker. I walked 677.3 miles, almost a third of the AT, and would have loved to summit Katahdin with some of my friends. It's a tough trail, physically,  psychologically, and emotionally. I have great memories,  no regrets. Thanks for following me and your support.","
