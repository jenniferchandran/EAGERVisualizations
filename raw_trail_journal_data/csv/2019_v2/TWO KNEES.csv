TWO KNEES,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605655,"Went on a 2 day backpacking trip to test out sleep system in preparation for our hike on the Appalachian trail. Had the Hornet two person tent, the enlighten 850 fill quilt and the klymit 4 season sleeping pad. I Slept better than the last hike in Heart Bar/Big Bear area. My Torso was toast warm in the 37 degree weather. However my toes were cold, even with 2 pair of wool socks and the Zpacks goose down boots. I will need to tweak my sleep system even more. So lessons learned on this trip: 1) Should always fill all water containers before leaving a water source when in unfamiliar areas. 2) Should fluid body before taking on the days hike. 3) If there are any health issues/concerns get ok or clearances from doctors.","Chantry flats to Spruce Grove to Mt Wilson

I also shared with him on how I am preparing for my journey. I got an OK! He did say to plan my steps and avoid any potential twisting of the knee. So I will be very mindful when hiking in the rock/root ladened trails.,"Per-hike homework

TWO KNEES,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605918,"Today I saw my Primary Care provider. I have had difficulty hiking up hill the last 3 hikes.  This seems to be a new problem and I decided to get cleared from my primary care provider, just incase there was something going on that I was not aware of and also before I get on trail and discover a potentially serious problem.  I/we discovered that I have a low thyroid count and potential anemic.  Well both are an easy fix and won't keep me off trail. =)","Home

TWO KNEES,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606349,"We were unable to repeat this shake down hike due to the government shut down. Did the sleep system shake down in my backyard.  System worked perfectly. Wore smart wool 250 long sleeve shirt and pants. Layered with a fleece, puffy jacket, wool hat and gloves. Used a therm-a-light Z-mattress and a Nemo Tensor air matress.  Enlighten Revelation 850 fill 20 degree bag.  Legs were a bit chilly so draped the costco blanket over them and slept very well.","Home
