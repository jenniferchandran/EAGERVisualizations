Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/336244,"It seems that I am late to the game posting anything, or for that matter knowing what to post. I made the choice to attempt a thru hike just before Thanksgiving 2010, which is turning out to be a pretty tight crunch getting everything together. I am fortunate enough to have some experience backpacking with the boy scouts, but that only gets my bag packed and 10 miles down the trail. I've gone through a crash course in long distance hiking via books and some very helpful hikers along the way. Now however, it seems like getting my life in order before the hike is more of a challenge than the idea of hiking.After one change in the plan or another, I have come to the conclusion to abandon the life I have setup for myself since graduation. I am leaving my apartment, quitting my job, and moving away from a large group of support to pursue my pilgrimage north. I have a whole new life starting in March.I will work over the next few weeks to bring this journal up to speed and expand on the momentous shift that has propelled me to Springer Mountain.",,Catching Up,"Feb 01, Tue",0
Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/336251,"My first prep hike was 9/15-9/16Pack weight: 30 lbs w/ 3 days food and 6 liters waterSaturday started out around 25 degrees but after the first two miles I was down to a t-shirt and sweatshirt and very happy for the chill. I got turned around at the start of my trip because I did not have a map of the section and did not check exactly where the trail crossed the road I put in at. I ended up retracing my steps for the first two miles before I found the white blazes. I hiked in about three inches of snow in southern PA around Waynesboro area. The advantage to this was the ability to follow footprints in the snow without having to look for the blazes. The disadvantage was I choose to wear running shoes which quickly destroyed my feet. After some research I had decided to try running shoes on the trail because of their lightweight nature and breathability. I later learned (with more research) that hikers feet, unless supported by a studier shoe, will experience a painful flattening of the foot. Lesson learned! By the end of Saturday I had hiked 14 miles. I can't say I didn't feel it. My feet and legs were sore from the effort and I was happy to make it to the shelter early enough to light a fire and dry out before nightfall. I averaged 3 miles an hour and was able to fully appreciate the amazing invention of hiking poles. If you haven't purchased or hiked with them yet, YOU NEED TO. I cannot tell you how many times I was saved from a fall or slip, let alone the momentum I was able to generate by using my arms and legs. I was surprised to find that I was not the only hiker crazy enough to trek through the snow and cold in the middle of January. A total of 3 other hikers shared the shelter with me that night. I can only hope that it was a glimpse of what I am to experience on my hike. Three strangers meeting at a destination seeking only shelter, but together experiencing a moment to remember. It has been a long time since I have experienced the hospitality and conversation of a complete stranger. It is an experience I will never grow tired of. It is one of the many reasons I choose to take this journey. The amount of strength it gave me is difficult to articulate. Feeling a connection with people you've known for less than a day can reaffirm your faith in the world around you.Day 2 was difficult to start as I did not sleep for the majority of saturday night. Sleeping with my water (to keep it from freezing) was the downfall of my warmth. I should have emptied it all and filled it at the spring in the morning. I had to good fortune of receiving warm water from one of the other hikers staying at the shelter. This saved me (and my numb hands) from firing up my stove and waiting for a warm breakfast. I ignored all of the normal morning activities (washing/stretching) just to get on the trail and warm up again. I was able to cover the 9 miles planned for the day in 3 hours. The pain from the previous days hike became numb after my first 2 miles. I have a feeling I will need to get used to this. My first hike gave me insight into both the mental attitude and physical awareness I need to internalize to complete my thru. All that said, it was the best two day vacation I have taken in years.",,First Adventure,"Feb 02, Wed",0
Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/336287,"Pack weight: 23 lbs (3 days food, 1 liter water)A few adjustments had to made in preparation for my second hike. First, I dropped 5 liters of water from my pack. This saved me roughly 10 lbs in weight. It was at the advice of an '09 thru hiker whom I met the previous weekend at the shelter. He pointed out the advantage of carrying less and filling up at the springs more. I'd have to say I agree with his advice. Second, I discarded the tee shirt I had worn the previous week and stuck with my under armor cold weather shirt. The cotton shirt from the week before ended up soaked with perspiration and I realized the drying time of said shirt would be too long to be any use on the trail. I'm only carrying one spare change so to have my clothes washed and dried quickly is a must. I am still debating between a new synthetic shirt (which fits like a shirt) or wearing under armor the whole trail. Though skin tight clothing may be acceptable on the trail, I don't want to be looking half clothed while in town. My best guess is I will pick up something more acceptable while on the trail after the cold weather dies down.Third, I abandoned the idea of hiking in running shoes. I purchased Salomon XA Comp GTX 5's from REI. I enjoyed the balance between weight and rigidness of the shoe. The sole was thick enough to pad my feet, and the arch did not collapse like my previous shoe. I wore them the week before to 'break them in' and tried to do some running at the gym. A growing pain was starting in my right ankle and foot, but I thought this was normal with new shoes and would go away. I was wrong. I was pushing my feet too hard because I desperately wanted to break in the shoes for the coming weekend. The night before my hike I was walking around with what felt like a knife in my ankle.So with all the changes made, I started off Saturday around 10:30am (a very late start). The plan for the day was to hike from Carlisle area (Interstate 81 crossing) to Duncanon. The weather was maybe 10 degrees at the start of my hike. Again, I was happy for the cold and hiked in my sweatshirt and under armor after the first 2 miles. Steam was coming off of my head the entire day. The severe temperatures had turned all of the snow (about 4 inches at the base of the mountain) into a sheet of ice. The trail crosses farm lands for the first couple miles which wind sweeps over making an ice skating rink 4 miles long. In order to keep from falling (which I did about 3 times... much to the amusement of onlooking farmers), I had to punch my heels into the ground to get through the ice and onto firmer footholds. My hiking poles glanced off the ground and were all but useless in this section. There were no footprints for me to follow this time... no one was stupid enough to attempt my icecapades.Once I made it into the woods the ice slacked, but I still fought to hold onto my hiking poles as they bounced and skidded off the ground. The pain in my ankle had only gotten worse with all the ice and added weight of the pack, but I decided to move forward, unwilling to retrace my steps. As stated earlier, here were no human tracks on the trail. But the snow did serve as a blank canvas, showing the recent history of every animal who wandered across the path. This in itself allowed my mind to wander beyond the pain in my ankle and onto the lives being lived in the woods that we know nothing about. If they can survive this snow and ice... so can I. One set of tracks were particularly interesting (Pic above) They belonged to a dog. This dog (medium to large build if I had to guess) had walked the trail before me. I'm not talking about a section of the trail... I am talking about 12 miles of the trail without deviating course. There was no other prints in the snow but this lone dog. He was not following someone... he was following the trail. Though he has no knowledge of my existence, he was my companion that saturday.Between the ice and snow (which on the mountain formed 2 ft. drifts across the trail) I was making horrible time. The sun began to set and temperatures were dropping. I was 4 miles away from town with darkness falling around me on top of a mountain. It was NOT where I wanted to be. I could no longer feel the pain in my ankle... as long as I kept walking. This pain caused me to push past taking breaks, or lunch, or stopping for more water. My camel pack hose had frozen more than 5 times that day and I didn't have the time anymore to thaw it (though I did stick it under my shoulder strap/shirt to keep it mostly free from ice). I had two choices: I could sit down on the top of the mountain and feel sorry for myself, or I could accomplish my goal and make it to town. I toyed with the first idea for about 5 minutes before it became clear to me which choice to take. The trail was not defeating me, I was defeating me. The trail did not force me into this state, I did. If I was capable of feeling this defeat... I was also capable of feeling the opposite. This thought brought on a surge of self confidence. It no longer mattered what state I was in, I was capable of changing that. I literally ran down off the mountain... covering 4 miles through snow and ice in one hour. The sun set as my foot touched payment in the town of Duncanon. I had completed my 17 mile goal for the day.I am grateful to have experienced a day like this before my hike... as I am sure to encounter more. My mental attitude overcame the physical barriers that lay in front of me. I could have let it be the other way around... but then I could still be up on that mountain knee deep in snow. Everything I have read about being more mentally prepared than physically prepared now has etched a permanent place in my head. Days after my trip (after I was able to walk on my ankle again) a stupid thought crossed my mind. I took off my right boot, moved the insert over 3 millimeters, and put the boot back on. I have never worn more comfortable shoes. I hope this will help my fellow '11 thru hikers experience a much more pleasant journey than I did that day. CHECK YOUR SHOE INSERTS AND MAKE SURE THEY ARE CENTERED TO YOUR FEET. I could have saved myself a week of pain and $5 on an ace bandage. More importantly... I learned a lesson that may make the difference between seeing Katadyn or seeing the backseat of car heading home.Gear list to come... and maybe some real information about myself.",,Second Hike,"Feb 03, Thu",0
Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/336420,"Figured I should test this out on my phone because 'everyone is doing it'. I'd have to say this is not a preferred method of transcribing my thoughts, but in a pinch it will due. Hopefully with the weekend coming up I'll have some time to post a bit more about myself and the idea behind my name...",,View Entry,"Feb 04, Fri",0
Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/336552,"This past weekend didn't end up being as relaxing as I had hoped. Thursday-Saturday I spent designing lights for Miss West Chester University, a beauty pageant I have lit for the past three years. When I wasn't working, I was laid up on my couch with horrible fatigue. Some type of sickness hit me hard Friday and I am just now recovering. I suppose it's better to get it out of the way now, but it had me worried about starting my hike on time. My mind immediately jumped to MONO when I started feeling the symptoms... since when am I paranoid enough to use WebMD? It's funny how your priorities change. I'm not worried about quitting my job. I'm not worried about selling off everything I own that won't fit in my car. I'm not worried about moving to a new state after I get back. I'm worried about a sore throat and fatigue. All I really have on this hike is my mind and body... and I can't get anywhere without them both working together.Speaking of that combination, there is probably a part of me worth mentioning. I have been battling with smoking for 5 years. I have learned the definition of addiction first hand, and it is a difficult cycle to break. I have 'quit' around 30 times, anywhere between 2 weeks and 2 months, but I always seem to come back to it. I've tried cold turkey, gum, the patch, and now Lobelia (which works very well). What really seems to work for me is physical activity. Working out is the best way to keep my moods in balance, and it definitely counteracts the effects of smoking on my body. This hike is another opportunity to change my habits and keep them.Other than that, I lead a pretty healthy life. My job keeps me physically active, sometimes working 20 hour days and 90 hour weeks. At the gym I'm able to run a couple miles before my lungs give out. I love stretching... it might be one of my favorite things to do. I eat 3,000-4,000 calories a day to keep up with my lifestyle (which worries me because I know this will increase even more on the hike). I cook all my own meals which is pretty much a pile of veggies in a pan w/ some starch and some protein. I'm 6'4"" and weigh 200lbs. I am trying to increase my weight before the hike. In my packing, I have not come across any 'luxuries' that I want to take. It is bare bones. I will however carry more food than most. Because of my size and pace I am hiking at I am already seeing an increase in my appetite. I also know that I am easily upset when I'm hungry. I also know most hikers consume 4,000-5,000 calories a day and lose 20% of their body weight. I already eat more than most and weight less than most for my size. My thinking is the weight of the food won't drain me as much as the extra calories will fuel me, much like the size of my body burns more calories but in turn is able to carry more weight? This is a question because I can't count it as a fact until much later on the trail.As far as other luxuries, I am hoping my evenings will be filled with the entertainment of conversation. It's a luxury you don't have to carry... so I'm down with it. I've also played drums for 14 years which is long enough to realize everything is a percussive instrument. My hands come with me and the instruments are in-house... so now I've got two things. Anyone else have entertainment ideas along these lines?I promise the gear list is coming...",,Counting it down...,"Feb 07, Mon",0
Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/336635,"I got sent home early from work due to my sickness... this is starting to get annoying. I'm too awake and nervous to sleep so I'm hoping to get these thoughts out to put my mind at ease. I had hoped to hike this coming weekend, but have decided it's better for me to rest and maybe make one more trip to REI. There is enough planning to keep me busy so at least I'll be moving forward.On to my trail name...Growing up, I had a problem with 'the way things are'. I questioned (and tried to challenge) my mentors to provide acceptable answers when I saw I problem. When they failed, I looked to art to capture truth. Art in this case encompasses books, music, theatre, and dance; Walden, Gandhi, The Beatles, The Peaceful Warrior, and countless musicals. I became obsessed with finding an answer... THE answer. I would latch onto a philosophy, then discard it as a new one came along. All of them had theories that were unable to be proven or verified. I was too logical to embrace something unproven. I was still searching...In august I read a book by Daniel Quinn titled 'Ishmael'. He captured everything I have been searching for. Simply, the book outlines the world before and after the agricultural evolution. Most of our history books cover only the recent history of our species, after the agricultural revolution, which only documents the past few thousand years. What is not covered is the millions of years our species has existed before the revolution. This revolution split humans into two categories; Civilized and Uncivilized. Civilized humans are what we consider ourselves... while Uncivilized is where we group remote tribes in Africa (and other countries). Civilized humans use agriculture and build cities, while Uncivilized humans are still hunter-gatherers (which is how we survived those millions of years). Daniel Quinn didn't like using the terms Civilized and Uncivilized (because of the obvious prejudice). He coined the term 'Taker' to represent one who accepts civilization... and 'Leaver' for one who does not. This book opened my eyes to another world... a world outside anything I had ever known. There was another way to live?   Civilization isn't the reason for our existence, it's simply an invention we created? (I am oversimplifying these ideas... it took 300 pages for him to fully develop) I fully embraced this idea... and saw it THE answer I was looking for. I am human, a species who gained consciousness and found a way to manipulate nature to support larger numbers of ourselves. Once looked at as our greatest achievement, it is now seen as our downfall. Our eco system is THE answer... it is the reason for our existence. Without it, we would die. Without us, it would still live. This thought shattered my life. What do you do when you find out your life is a burden... not a blessing? I am speaking from a practical standpoint, an outsiders perspective of our eco system. I was lost... and still am. It's impossible to be content with the life I am living when I see it as part of the problem. I need to change directions... I need to be part of the solution again. While I don't know what that is yet, I am taking my time on the trail to find it.I adopted his term 'Leaver' to use as my trail name and shortened it to 'Levi'. It is a reminder of why I choose to hike, and what I am trying to become. My hope is that I will get the opportunity to explain my name to others... and shape this idea into something I can pursue. To be clear, I am not an activist. I am not looking to become a vegetarian again. I am not into politics. Though these are all helpful in changing the state of things... they are not enough for me. They are just branches... I am aiming for the root.",,Leaver,"Feb 08, Tue",0
Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/337411,"Putting my thoughts into writing has helped me more than I thought. I am always thinking critically, but never take time to write down and articulate what it is I am pondering. A lot has happened in the past week and with the hopes that this will propel me even farther ahead, I will try to catch my writing up.In my past entry, I brought up a topic that has no immediate solution. Dismantling civilization to better serve the earth is nothing that will come about in a grass roots movement in my lifetime. To focus on something out of reach is to ignore what is within reach. I can't waste my time fighting against the whole world. My progress in the end would be less than had I just focused my efforts into one area. I want the fire, but need to start with a spark.I am now more future oriented with my dreams. I have taken thought into what I enjoy, what I am effective at, and what will benefit others the most. I've already come up with a career that encompasses all three - High School Guidance Counseling. The idea was one I had at the beginning of high school when I first started thinking about my future. I dismissed it back then because of an unstable relationship I was in. I couldn't stand listening to another person's problems, unable to make them change their mind. Put it like that and I was very controlling, but when the topic was self destruction I wanted to save the person from themselves. I was learning the lesson 'you can only lead a horse to water'.   It was a lesson too hard to learn back then and pushed me away from any career that was intended to council people through problems like this and worse.   It's been years and I have seen that lesson played out every day since. After so much exposure to the frustration, I have realized how important it is to protect. It is what makes us individuals and allows us to filter what is best in our own lives. We all are allowed our opinions and must respect others in order to be allowed the same respect. What is right will eventually rise to the top of popular opinion because it is right for the majority of the people. I am not suggesting we stop voicing our opinions, I am just stressing the importance of how we present our opinions to others. That said, I am considering counseling again. In a high school I work with students (which has been my dream all along), faculty (who share my passion), and still have access to theatre and music (where I've spent the past 10 years of my life). I'll have more time to think about all of this on the trail, but I wanted to post something a bit less aggressive than the last post.I will be hiking 18 miles this weekend from Duncannon NB. My cousin will be joining me so I'll get some practice hiking with someone. I can't expect to be solitary with so many amazing people hiking around me.",,Fire and Ice,"Feb 24, Thu",0
Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/338552,"One week from today I will be sleeping in the first shelter on the trail. The reality has still not fully set in.If you've been following my journal I apologize for not being more frequent with my posts. I see it as a reflection of my busy schedule and reluctance to count down the days until I depart. These past few weeks have been full of preparations and my job. Right now there is a moving truck parked outside my house. Tomorrow I will be packing what is left of my belongings. Much has been thrown away, and three car loads have been donated to Salvation Army. Still, I am left with more boxes than I expected. The prospect of going back to college has bent my resolve for simplifying my life. I will be keeping my bed, dresser, desk, and three coffee tables. Doesn't seem like much, but I wasn't expecting to move any furniture back home. I am fortunate to have supportive parents, willing to sacrifice their house for my storage needs. My moving truck is a 20' box truck from work, and the gas money was donated by my employer's father. I am overwhelmed with everyone's support.This week I have been saying goodbyes. I have close to one hundred business contacts that I deal with on a regular basis. Because Monday is my last day, I have been informing clients about my departure. I cannot believe how many of them are encouraging. Many expressed interest in the trail and some even shared stories about their outdoor adventures.   I plan to spend much of the trail exploring this bond.Monday night was spent at my old college bar. A group of fifteen theatre alumni got together for a small reunion. Nothing to do with me, but wonderful timing. Everyone there was someone I went to school with, sat beside in class, and worked long hours in the theater with. They are the people I will miss. Luckily, I will see them all again! After I pack up the truck tomorrow, everyone is coming over for a bon fire. It's going to be the last night with all my friends around me. I hope to capture as much of it as I can. I'm not sure what goodbye will be like.I hope I will have another chance to update before I depart, but I have a feeling my nights will be filled with friends and family. I have not planned my mail drops or planned anything past my first day of hiking. Hopefully I'll have time before I leave, if not I'll have to do it once I'm on the trail.

It was not the easy day I had planned. I finished at Stover Creek Shelter around 3:30 and enjoyed the rest of the evening relaxing and meeting the other 14 people at the shelter.

Made great time in the morning and reached Hawk Mountain Shelter by 10am. Didn't get much sleep last night due to all the racket at the shelterso I was happy to be up and out early. Ended up spending an hour and a half at the shelter talking with Mickey, then Reuben 2, then Glide on the way out. Probably took more breaks today due to all the friendly faces. I'm happy to find a familiarity so early on. Spent an hour at the creek one mile before the shelter. Washed up my clothes and did some light swimming before I layed out to dry. If I hadn't fallen in love with the trail yet, that solidified it. I get to do this every day for 6 months? And I don't have to pay rent at the shelters?

Around 10am ran into Razor, the trail runner, at Woody Gap. Meet up with Alex who stayed in Gooch the night before. Ended up summiting Blood Mountain with him. Too much cloud cover that high up to see any real view, but I have yet to have any issue with the weather. We cruised into Neels Gap around 4 or 5pm. Hit the out fitters first for a slim jim and to get our bunks. Evaluated my food (ended the trip with a cliff bar and a tuna packet) and went back up to get my next 3 days of meals plus something for dinner. Ended up with 2 hot pockets, coke, a small summer sausage, and combos for dinner. I was so hungry I skipped heating the hot pockets the whole way through, molten hot cheese and frozen pepperoni never tasted so good. Ended up eating a second dinner at the hostel (rice, stir fry, and beans). After 38 miles in my first 3 days I was pretty hungry. Spent a great time at the hostel getting a shower, doing laundry, and catching up with the other hikers. I did have a growing pain in my left foot, but more on that for tomorrow.","Gooch Gap Shelter

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/339512,"If You would have told me this morning I would be 17 miles from Neels Gap before sundown, I would have stayed in my bunk.Side note: One cat at the hostel decided to lick my feet half the night. Yet another restless night....I got off to an 8am start to chilly weather and swallowing fog. The first two hours were magic. I couldn't see more than fifty yards in any direction, putting me in a sort of bubble. Ran into a guy named Duncan who lost his food to a bear the night before one mile from the hostel. Besides that I didn't meet anyone for the first 4 or 5 miles. It helped to clear my mind and focus on walking. My left foot was getting progressively more painful and swelling was causing my shoe to tighten. At Tesnatee Gap I took off my shoes to evaluate my foot. I didn't want to go further with this much pain because there was not much of an out once I got into the mountains. I took two advil and pulled out my guide book to start looking for doctors.Around that time, Duncan caught up with me after resupplying at Neels. He was thinking of calling the hiking trip a failure (hes out for 4 days) until he had run into me that morning. I was happy he had chosen to stay because had just caught me at a breaking point. He mentioned a road crossing one mile up the trail and to keep on going till then to see if the advil would be enough.Sure enough, the advil took enough of the edge off and my slower pace helped ease the pain. Six miles later down the trail I stopped at my end destination for the day to take lunch! By noon I had covered 11 miles. After taking off my shoes and resting for twenty minutes, I got up and kept hiking. The trail was a gentle slope up and the temperature was 70 and sunny. I couldn't stop walking! Somewhere between mile 12 and 14 I found myself a set trail legs.Water falling from the mountain provided a place to wet my hat before the sun dried it again. A nice breeze ran down the trail just in time to cool me off. All afternoon I was enchanted by the trail and the mountain I was climbing (Blue Mtn I believe). Somehow I ended up pushing 17 miles after my 15 miles yesterday and only my 4th day on the trail. All of this on a swollen left foot.Needless to say, the right mental attitude, nice weather, and the right encouragement at the right time just made this the best day yet!

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/339632,"So much for a short day, the weather was so nice and I felt so good I decided to push on. I'm in good position to drop into town early tomorrow.Rocky Mountain and Tray Mountain were definitely a challenge to get into one day, but the views were spectacular. I wish I could post the pics I took!I know I talk alot about the mental attitude of hiking, but today I found my mind wandering past the trail into the everyday.I had a beautiful day today. I'm not just talking about the weather, I'm saying everything shopping me. The people, the place, the weather, the breeze... Everything. It was hard to have that kind of day. I woke up in pain from 17 miles yesterday and my swollen ankle was making it hard to get around camp. I had two mountains to get over and the sun was hot.Problems like this are faced everyday by hikers. We beat ourselves up physically, then lay on the ground to sleep it off, only to do it the next day. But, these people will always greet you with a smile, and make you laugh all through dinner and into the evening. Why is everyone so pleasant to be around? If you had to walk 15 miles because your car broke down you'd probably not have the smiles we do at night. I think the difference hikers and people have is that hikers take the time to see beauty. It is not hard to do, most people just don't take a minute to look around them. When you're hiking it's easier to see the beauty. It's green leaves on the brown trail, the shape of a tree never to be reproduced again, the fall of a stream through the roots of a tree. Moments like these are what we hikers experience all day every day...and is probably why we have beautiful days. It's why we can sit in ultimate pain and still laugh at the slightest amusement.If you think these moments are limited to the woods and nature, you are wrong. Beauty is in everything. Hot water streaming from the shower, air conditioning on a humid day, a bed with clean sheets. There are so many millions of things given to us every day that we don't take the time to see the beauty in. If you ever feel like you're having an ugly day, STOP. Take moment to find something you appreciate, then find another, and don't stop doing that all day. You will smile, and people will smile when they see your smile. People will seek you out because you will always wear a smile,and then you get to be surrounded by people smiling back at you. Find the beauty, and you will never have an ugly day. Take the time to look around you... find what you've been missing.","Campsite 47.8

The hostel itself is layed out with thick mattresses,a pillow on every bed, and blankets. There is a fridge, microwave, and phone. Within five minutes of getting here, he showed us the sodas in the fridge, the first aid cabinet (literally a two door cabinet full), and the shower house (complete with fresh towels, shampoo, and about a hundred kinds of soap). THEN he asked if I would put my laundry in a basket and set it outside... An hour later he came in with it fully cleaned. AND THIS PLACE IS DONATION!?! Dunkin had to head home, as he was only section hiking, but before leaving he gifted me his gators... All I could do was thank him and offer a king sized snickers in return. I'm going to miss him, but I'll have something to remember him by (plus the hilarity of hanging bear bags). It was a happy parting.The owner here then drove me and Mike into town (another thru). We hit Subway,Rite Aid, then takeout Chinese.Managed to hitch my first ride back to the hostel. That was an experience. She skidded to a halt, and asked us to climb in (all in thick south accent). She was around 60 years old, had a chiwawa on her lap, and had her grand kids in the backseat (which we had to cram in next to). Nice lady.... Scary driver. Got back alive all the same.Sergio had shown up by then. He's from Brazil and has been averaging 18-20 miles a day. He is 51 years old. His english is a bit broken but he is thrilling to talk to. The owner here let us borrow his jeep to get Sergio into town (and let me drive... Did I mention how nice he is?).We got into the grocery store, then found a place for pizza (at Sergio's request). One pizza place in town...staffed by one person. The same person sat us, took our order, got us drinks, cooked our food, then rang us out. They were a bit under staffed. I think we managed to interest him in hiking the trail for part of this year. Good to know we are being effective ambassadors of the trail.Heavy rain slowed our trip back to the Patch, but we both back safe. Little bit of planning,a quick talk with the owner about his day summiting Katadyn, and we packed in for bed. The good things keep coming. Did I mention this is also a farm? I got to pet two donkeys, multiple goats, and one very friendly cat. Both the owner and his wife are just wonderful people. If you ever plan a thru hike, please show your support for this hostil. It is incredible! Off to bed for now... I really need to cut back on these posts. Too many things to write down for one day. Hope everyone else found something beautiful in their day too!

Pancakes, cheddar biscuits, sausage, hashbrowns, strawberries, sausage gravy, eggs, and of course blueberry syrup were all on the table when Gary rang the bell. He dropped us off at the trail around 9:30. The morning was easy enough with such a big breakfast and a almost full day of rest. Passed into North Carolina close to noon with about seven others. It was quite the welcome crew. Stopped at the knarled tree for the pictures again.Got into camp around 4:00 with Mike, Spoon, Downhill,and Sergio. The temperature dropped quickly and at some point in the night went below freezing. We had a nice fire going until sundown, but cold temperatures prevented me from writing anything once I got into my bunk. Sergio was pretty amusing with the cold, as this was one of his first experiences with freezing temperatures.

My bag took on a bit of water and I had to pack out my tent soaking wet.Three quick miles into Franklin and I bid Sergio goodbye. He was pressing onto NOC for his resupply and was pulling 20 miles a day. He is already a legend amongthe thru hikers who have encountered him. I was happy to stay with him three days before he passed me. He was always smiling and thanking and congratulating anyone who came across his path.Franklin was an experience. We got picked up by Ron Haven around 10am and did two loops before we made it into town. I was just happy to be out of the rain (which was falling heavily all day). We checked into Haven Budget Inn. The previous tenant was still in the room when we opened the door! In any other situation this would have been an outrage, but luckily it was another thru hiker who invited us in out of the rain and cold. We shared the room with him for a half hour before he headed out. We also sat through housekeeping cleaning the room up. Bit of a frustration, but it was nice to be out of the cold.Hot shower felt nice and we cranked the heat in the room to dry out our gear. Mike and I split a room with Spoon and Downhill next door. We went to a steakhouse for lunch and I had a delicious beer. I'm beginning to see why all hikers talk about beer.Took a nap in the room because I couldn't keep my eyes open. Did laundry and caught a Back to the Future marathon. I was very happy to be out of the rain.At 7 we went to Outdoor 76, the outfitter closest to the motel. They closed at 7 but opened up the door for us and let us browse the store. I got a pack cover and looked at water sealants for the tent. The cashier went to his car, brought in his pack, and handed me a new tube of seam sealant! He didn't want me to pay for something that might not work. On top of that, thru hikers gets a 10% discount. AND... The girl running the store gave us a ride to the grocery store without us asking! I will be sending a letter of thanks to Outdoor 76 and I will pass on their name to anyone heading to Franklin. They are a business that really cares about their customers!Stocked up on alvacado, sausage, and cheese sandwiches for the next two days with nuttella and peanut butter for breakfast and lunch. It's more weight but realllllly good!An entire dominos pizza was given to Mike and I... Way more trail magic than I can handle. We are the pizza, made our sandwiches, and I seam sealed the tent. The sealant worked way better than the first mix I used and I think my tent is water proof again! I'll be sending the outfitter a check for the cost (as I used the entire tube).A good night sleep and I'm off on the trail tomorrow! Lots more weather coming our way...","Rock Gap Shelter

Sadly, the trail is 5 or 6 miles downhill to NOC. Gary was suffering from a painful knee and I was limping due to my ankle. At least we were able to keep the same pace. I have had a few broken bones in the past, but this pain was difficult to cope with. I had to make it to town, but every step sent icy pain up the front of my shin. I took the pain and used it to focus on the trail ahead. It was a very long 6 miles down, but I'm glad I had company.

Ended up meeting Cotton, who was headed to Sylva Orthopedic Center for a knee injury. We found a hitch to town (30min away) with Waggs, a guy who happened to hear of our problems and offered us a ride. Very nice guy to talk to, found out he was working for Outward Bound. I got an appointment within 20 min of getting to the medical center. Wonderful staff and very helpful doctor. He said the best thing I can do is rest it and prescribed me a steroid to help with the swelling. I had overused my tendon on my left ankle doing too many miles too quickly.Filled my prescription at a pharmacy up the street and secured a ride back to NOC with the pharmacist. Met back up with Cotton who had a shot medication put into his knee...he seemed happy for the pain relief.Took dinner at the hospital cafeteria and waited until the Pharmacy closed. Pleasant ride back to NOC. Our driver is about to complete a bike trip across the country (a couple years in the making). I'm finding a trend between nice people and the outdoors.Relaxed around the lodge with the same crew from the night before plus Waldo and REM.

There is something magical about morning hiking. The woods seem pristine, unspoiled, like making the first cut into a homemade pie. Everything was perfectly formed, undisturbed.

I can't describe the beauty to you, and a picture will never capture the depth and complexity of this forest.I had an amazing hiking day. Though wind threatened to blow me off the mountain, the temperature was warm enough to hike in a t-shirt. Views opened to the left and right of me at every turn. I had good company from Calgone and Stardust and got some amazing journaling done. I have been writing in my own journal these past few days instead of online. It's late tonight but I will try to copy one of my entries in here for you. Keep in mind I have all day to walk and think.. That's what my entertainment is. Welcome to hiking.I have heard alot of talk about ""experiencing the trail to the fullest"". Honestly, you could probably spend a lifetime in each step of this trail and still have a new experience every moment to tell about. I do however believe there is a difference between young and old hikers. Older hikers have had more experience with new experiences. They know how rare they are and 'savor' each new experience because they only happen once. Only once will you see the view from Springer Mountain for the first time. Only once will you step around the corner to find four layers of mountains sprawled across your view. Only once will I feel exactly the way I feel right now. The more experience you have with these new experiences, the more you will want to prolong them. Young hikers don't have that wisdom. Life moves quickly and we are exposed to so many new experiences. Our lives haven't settled down yet and we don't see an end to something else new waiting for us after this. Most of us are just out of school, starting a new job, leaving town, marrying. We have so many new things to look forward to. We never think to slow down for fear we may miss the next new thing. It will take until these new things become fewer and farther between for us to slow down and savor them. We may not know what we missed until it's already gone. Give us a break, it's easier for you to remember your regrets about speeding through life than it is for us to predict the future.I'm just thankful I found it so early on in life. Live in the moment, no regrets.So that's a brief look into my world. I have pages more of this stuff, but have been hesitant to share. On another note, I hit the 10% marker today... Already??","Icewater Spring Shelter

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/344457,"If Only I could sum up my day and you could experience it as I have. Today I watched the world change. I started at 6,000ft and descended to 2,500ft. The day started with wind, rain, and fog. It ended with sun and heat. The morning was a pine forest on the ridge of a mountain, the afternoon was a lush green canopy and a carpet of flowers. I sat on top of a rock today and looked around a 180 degree view of green hills. I saw a snake, two salamanders, and countless butterflies.And now an entry from my journal...Many people ask me questions about what it's like to hike the Appalachian Trail. Almost everyone has logistical questions to ask me: ""What are you carrying"", ""What do you eat"", ""How far do you walk"". Most end by saying they could never fathom doing something like this themselves. I don't think they were asking the right question. The right question in my mind is: 'What is it like spending the day as a hiker?'Imagine a day where you were only concerned with what you had the power to control. A day free of worry because everything you felt concerned about was in your power to control. Let go of the elements in your day you have no power over. Now walk and experience as much of the world as you see fit to do. Don't worry about food or shelter, it's on your back. Don't worry about water, it's coming up from the ground. You have as much time as the day allows before you have to rest and be ready for another day full of carefree exploring....That is a good day.To hit this mentality every day has not yet been possible. There are always forces working against you it you imagine it so. If I had expected a sunny day and rain filled my tent... I did not have a good day. But I guess that's really what morphs people out here. Every day you try to let go of your believed power over forces you can't control, and grasp the moments of the day without any worry. With practice out here, where things are less busy, you can begin to embrace exactly what you have control over. It becomes easier with practice, and all we have out here is time to practice. After awhile we are only left focusing our energy over what we have the power to change. Seeing as how we can change what we want to, we turn each day into a perfect day free of worry.After awhile we will have to return to the lives we left behind. But, I believe the people who experienced the trail without worry or stress will start to apply it to their lives at home, and see the same results as they did on the trail. Sadly, there are more things to stop worrying about in the life I left behind than there are out here. I guess it gives me something to work on when I've finished hiking. So another day is over and I've caught up on my journal. I can't say every entry will be like this one, but I do hope to make small advances every day in the life I am leading. I no longer worry about finishing the trail, but then again I'm not here to walk 2,172 miles anymore. I'm out here to make myself better with each experience, and when that is no longer possible I will happily continue my journey elsewhere.","Tri-Corner Knob Shelter

Many other hikers were hit and plenty of southern towns were damaged, but I stayed safe and dry. A note about the shelter: It's the last one in the smokies that still uses a fence across the front (to keep out bears?). I felt like I was part of Jurassic Park IV and we were stuck in the raptor cage. I spent some of the evening making raptor noises and commenting how well we were penned in for the attack. The night was restless due to the fact that everyone who had to use the bathroom in the middle of the night had to open the squeaky gate to get in and out. I'm glad they decided to do away with this method of warding off bears... It's unsettling to sleep in a cage. The hike down to Standing Bear hostile was thrilling... We got lost. Natie Bird Dog, Stich, and I all took a wrong turn and went a mile out of the way on a dead end road. We did see a turtle... so it was worth it?Plenty of downed trees from the storm as we came out of the Smokies. This will continue to be the case up till now (after Erwin). Standing Bear was wonderful. It's 5 or 6 cottages grouped together to form a little hiker haven. One was a store, the next a bunkhouse, the next a kitchen, and so on. It was a great group of hikers gathered there (many of whom I had gone through the smokies with). I resupplied and left (after eating 2 ramen noodles with half a stick of butter, a Mt.

The man I talked to ran a boy scout troop for 15 years, so much of the talk was centered around camp talk and how to teach life lessons. There troop was based out of a church. The church provided the annual budget for the troop and the scouts provided labor for all the grounds keeping. I loved the idea!

By the end of dinner we all agreed to take the party back to the 2nd floor balcony of the hostile and drink some wine and beer.Topics ranged between philosophy, books, and who should play Wonder Women if they make a movie (verdict still unknown). We also taught Stoker (a 17 year old student who is hiking for credit) how to open a beer with a lighter... Life lessons they don't teach. It's nights like that that make all the pain of hiking seem insignificant compared to the bond shared between fellow hikers.","Walnut Mtn Shelter

My tent is beautiful and water proof now!Did some reading, sent some letters, went to the store, and had a delicious vegetarian dinner cooked at the hostile. I also ran around the house taking pictures of everything. In every book of the house there is antique furniture, religious relics, eastern souvenirs, or one of a kind brass work. You should probably just visit. It's not a place to compare to anything else because there is nothing else like it.Another great night with most of the same people. We all decided to stay.

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/345932,"So hard to leave the hostel (have I been spelling hostel wrong this whole time?). Elmer even asked me if I wanted to stay an extra day, I said I had to hike then immediately regretted it. Nattie Bird Dog ended up staying ... I will miss his company.Hiking out of Hot Springs was terrible. The weather was hot, the climb was tough, and I didn't want to be walking away from such a great place.About 5 miles in I came across a pond. I was upset and hot so I decided to fish. I made a nice hook out of a safety pin, tied some floss to a stick, and tried my luck with a worm. I convinced Yoga Boy to do the same. After an hour or so we had nothing to show for it, but I was feeling better so I continued to hike.Met up with 9 guys called The Safety Crew and we headed up to the fire tower at Rich Mtn. It wasn't great but it was a view. Ended up in camp at 7pm which gave little time for anything but food and sleep. Nice group of guys though, they share everything (food, water, etc.).

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/345938,"Late Start today, probably because of the late night.Found a sign for trail magic and pressed most of the day to get there.The Greene Valley Hiking Club had setup camp at Camp Creek Bald. They had burgers, hot dogs, chips, soda, cookies, fruit, toppings, milk, water, and piles of candy. I have never seen such a spread for hikers. Seven or eight of us were up there as the clouds came in and rain started falling. I started to get my pack on first, then everyone else got the idea to make it to the shelter first. It was a five mile sprint to the shelter. I ended up passing everyone and trudged trough the pouring rain for the 2nd to last spot in the shelter... Win!There was a fire place in the shelter and it was already going when we got there. The shelter filled up and I think we had 13 campers there. The space in front of the fire was impossible to get to and wet packs were hung everywhere. Yoga Boy was running around the shelter all night in boxers as his only pants were soaking wet. A note to future hikers: please don't think you're being smart by sending all your clothes home along with your rain gear.... It's May and the temperature in the mountains is around 37 degrees AND it just poured rain. I don't care what you wear at night, but I do care if you have to take up a spot in front of the fire to dry your only piece of clothing.All in all the rain was a fun experience and I'm glad to have it out of the way. I'll know how to deal with it better next time, and the other hikers are way funnier when you put them in a survival situation. Watching people run around in boxers, set up a tent inside the shelter, and dry out various pieces of gear is pretty amusing.","Spring Mtn Shelter

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/345944,"So Running to the shelter yesterday did a number on my ankle (the right one this time), so I took an easy day.Got to the shelter to find two brothers still there from the night before. One was 17 and the other was 14. They are attempting a thru hike, but the younger one seemed to lack any motivation to move, let alone hike. The older brother decided that yelling and fighting with his younger brother all afternoon was the proper solution. Despite 5 other hikers being there plus an older women who was section hiking, they screamed and fought all day into the evening. I was very upset to have an injury that day.They were more out of place on the trail then a Nine Inch Nails concert in a library. I can understand why their parents sent them away for 6 months, I suppose it's cheaper than most childcare. I do understand that they're acting their age, but if that's the case THAT AGE DOESN'T BELONG ON THE TRAIL. What parent would send a 14 year old away for that long surrounded by 75% of people in their mid 20's? The amount of drugs, smoking, language, humor, and drinking is worse than most collages. The older brother wasn't much better off. He felt the need to Sharpie his name on every shelter and privy from here to Georgia. He also felt the need to 'rate' the privy on a scale from one to ten and write a review on the bathroom door.This isn't about him, it's about respect. First of all: don't deface the trail in ANY way. Second of all: This trail is maintained by volunteers, not janitors. They don't have to build a flush toilet. In fact, they don't have to build a toilet at all. They could just have you dig your own hole and squat in the bushes. Instead, they not only dig a hole, they put a toilet seat on top, put a roof over it, and are then forced to periodically shift around the PILE of human waste as it accumulates. And you think you have a right to 'rate' the work they've done?I think the worst part is the volunteers will eventually read the comments left behind. Whether it's on the wall of the privy or in the log book, please keep in mind the people you are 'rating'. This is not a hotel, you did not rent the shelter for $100.00 a night, you did not even pay to hike the trail that millions of VOLUNTEER hours went into maintaining. If you do or say anything negative against these people you will find an enemy in me. I get frustrated sometimes at the condition of the trail or the path chosen up a mountain, but I will never carve that opinion into the structures these people voluntarily build to provide us with shelter and comfort.

Nice temperature and streams running along the trail. The trail itself was almost wide enough to drive a car down.Felt really good on the climb up. Got to the top around 4pm which was impressive only because I started at noon. I am definitely gaining more strength. Picked a beautiful campsite near the trail with the best water source and dry firewood I've seen all hike. It's the little things. Spent some time hanging out with Low Key who I met last night and is now camped next to me. I'm glad for the company. Spent the rest of the night updating and killing my phone battery.

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/347474,"So Again I am behind on postings.... I have a decent explanation, but I'll get to that later.Woke up very late due to the late night postings on here. I got out of camp around 11 or 12. Low Key left a good two hours before me but as I started to climb Unaka Mtn I saw him coming back down towards me. He was just as confused as I was until he realized he had gotten turned around at the top and started heading south bound down the mountain. I felt very sorry for him having to do the climb twice.The top of Unaka is a dense pine forest and there was a heavy fog, giving it a Sleepy Hallow kind of look. It was very enchanting.The rest of the day went horribly. I was becoming very frustrated with hiking for no good reason. I lacked physical and emotional strength to go anywhere. At least I was able to drop into Greasy Creek Friendly for a mail drop. My original plan was to hike back out another two miles but they had fruit and ice cream, which made it very hard to leave.I ended up spending the night there with Sarge and Weaver and Connie the owner. We watched movies and ate ice cream and decided to slack pack Roan Mtn the next day.","Deep Gap
",Greasy Creek Hostel,"May 08, Sun",12.20
Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/347477,"Yes I said slack pack Roan Mtn. I'm sorry if you thought I was going to carry my full pack the whole way. For those of you that don't know, slack packing is when you only carry a small day pack with lunch, rain gear, water, and a camera worth you. You get dropped off at a far location then hike back to where your pack is (south bound). The next day you start where you were dropped off the day before (headed north again). It means you get to hike carrying 5 pounds instead of 35 AND we got to head south over Roan Mtn which is way easier elevation wise. There are some people against this form of backpacking, almost like it's cheating. I'd have to say I'm glad I did it and throughly enjoyed the day. I took more enjoyment out of the experience than I would have doing it headed north. The trip is about experiences for me and I definitely learned a lot by doing it, so I will not regret what I've done.We started at noon at Carvers Gap. The trail was very well maintained from the gap up to Roan. I took a long break at the shelter and went up in the loft with Sarge and Weaver. We ate lunch and read the log book.I stayed with them for awhile after that, and mentioned my thoughts about being okay with not finishing the trail. I guess I've just been doubting my resolve lately, especially after a bad day yesterday. I thought I would just walk home to PA and that would be the end for me. I'm glad I had Sarge and Weaver there to give me a wiser perspective on the trail. They said this was something that could never be taken away from me. Like so few things in life we concern ourselves with, this is one that can't be taken back or lost. In other words, it is something worth pursuing.I guess it may seem silly to the outside reader the idea that I would want to cut this trip short. You read about all the things I'm discovering and you think it would be crazy to leave that behind. It's easy to lose sight out here of what I'm doing. When you hike every day, it begins to lose it's charm. It's not an exact comparison, but it's similar to getting a new job. The first month or two is exciting. After awhile it all becomes routine and you lose sight of the thrilling fact that you have a job in the first place.Hiking feels like that to me at this point. It is now a test of constantly reminding myself that what I am doing is far more exciting than what I was doing our will be doing once I return home. I have a chance now to do something great for my life, and I'm out here acting on that dream. I have 2,172 miles to find out who I am and what I'm capable of and I have the chance to do that at age 23. So there's my current mental state a week later that was sparked by my conversion with those two. It took me awhile to get back on track but be sure I am back and my resolve is on firmer ground.The rest of the day went well. Nice weather and a warm bed to come back to. I decided to stay the week at the hostel doing work for stay until Trail Days. I'd get a ride with Connie on Friday to the event then pick up where I left off at Carvers Gap. More on that later.","Carvers Gap

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/347480,"I will encompass the week into this one post so as to save time.As I said last time, I'm staying at the hostel till after trail days (May 17th will be my start again). That gives me a full week to rethink my hike and also experience what it's like to work at a hostel (because I regretted not doing it in Hot Springs).I helped with breakfast, mowed half the lawn, helped with shopping, put up signs at the trail crossing, cleaned the beds, vacuumed, swept, cleaned the bathroom, and generally just helped when the hikers or Connie needed anything. The perks were pretty awesome too. I got to stay indoors for a week, use a bathroom that had a toilet AND a shower, eat real food, watch tv (all 6 glorious channels), and most importantly play with the very cute dog.I may write more later on this, but for now this is just a record for me. I'd like to have the time to talk about the experience but I'm getting tired and there's too much to write.Trail Days was a great experience. We tried to leave at noon on Friday to get there but it was closer to 5 by the time we left. I got plenty of reading done in the car. We arrived at 6 and after I said hi to Connie's friends I headed out to find my own. It took me an hour of wandering around all the camp sites to find anyone. It was Earth, Caveman, Smokey, and Dirt Nap that I ran into first. They were with me the day I left Fontana Dam because of my ankle. It was great to see familiar faces from the first time I started hiking.I set up my tent in the middle of Tent City on the baseball field. The woods were covered in tent sites (mostly claimed by large groups of former hikers). Luckily, without realizing it, I setup right next to the guys I was hiking with before I stayed at the hostel. John Wayne, Trumpet, Fling, No Worries, and Yoga Boy had managed to hike into Damascus for the event (doing at least 20 miles a day for a week). I would have never wanted to keep up with them.The festival had venders, music, fires, drum circles, food, and hikers. I got a thermorest air mattress instead of the closed cell foam and switched to aquamira water drops instead of my water filter pump. I decided to go lightweight after my slack pack, but more on that later.One funny yet annoying story is about the drum circle saturday night. After some wine I decided to play in the drum circle on the other side of camp (as I had done the previous night). There were maybe 10 drummers, some fire spinners,a fire breather, and apparently some idiot that thought handfuls of glitter was a good idea. I liked everything but the last one. I didn't even realize said idiot was there until I woke up the next morning and looked around my tent to find gold glitter. I then saw it in my sleeping bag, on my pillow, and ultimately found it plastered to my face and hair. I should have had a picture of me emerging from my tent covered in mud (it rained all weekend) and sparkling. After finding 20 other guys that looked like me, I didn't feel as bad. Actually I went to the grocery store and chinese buffet looking just like that.Good memories from Trail Days. Glad I was there and able to meet some hikers from last year. They were very strong motivators for continuing my journey.","Greasy Creek Hostel

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/347484,"So I'm back out hiking again after all that time off. I don't regret staying for so long, and I'm looking forward to going back for a visit when I finish. A few changes to my pack. I sent home my stove, crocs, thermals,water filter, and random little spices and food. I'm going cookless and switching to water drops to purify. After my slack pack I realized the importance of a light pack. I've talked with a few hikers this year who are doing it fire threw second time and I kept noticing that experienced hikers generally have a very light pack. The easiest way for me to do this was by cutting the things already mentioned. By going cook less I can convert the weight of my cooking stove into food weight. I now have a 15lb base weight and a 25lb full pack with 3 days food. Actually doing the math I have 8lbs of food for 3 days (2.6lbs of food per day). That's a lot of calories!So I started my hike in rainy weather and 40 degrees in the mountains. I was really happy about my pack all day but I have no clue how I was in such good spirits given the weather. It rained all day (and still is) and temperatures went from 40 as a high down to freezing. Ice started to form today at the top of Little Hump Mtn. The wind was at a constant 25-35mph. Half the day I couldn't feel my legs at all. I'm currently in my sleeping bag still wet but at least I'm somewhat warm. I'm hoping my sweatshirt will dry in my bag overnight.I couldn't see anything all day because of heavy fog. Apparently I missed some beautiful outlooks. Luckily, I am still in good mood! Today I was just happy to be out and was thankful to experience such a miserable day and still complete my goal. I didn't feel at odds with the weather, merely an observer of it at peace with whatever it happen to do. I felt confident that I had the knowledge to survive the conditions, so I saw it as an extra challenge today. It was one of the hardest pushes I've had to do out here, but I feel happy with how well I did it. I've found a new level of strength in me today.Apparently I was the only one stupid enough to hike to this shelter tonight. I am all alone for the first time and it is pouring rain. I couldn't get a fire going. I've been in my sleeping bag since I got here at 6. So glad I didn't have to cook. I ate cheese, crackers, tuna, pepperoni, and peanut butter. So nice to have a lot of food.I finished reading ' The Story of B' yesterday before I left the hostel. I'd have to say I couldn't imagine a better book to read on this journey. I have a newfound love of animism and feel it brought me through the day with a positive mind. Looking forward to another week of rain. 19 miles tomorrow, better rest up.","Carvers Gap

The temperature isn't much better tonight and I could really use some gloves.I wish the weather was sunnier, this section of the trail is probably quite beautiful when the sun is out. I passed a few waterfalls and dozens of creeks. Yesterday I passed over two balds that apparently had a great view. All I've been seeing is fog.Not many people out on the trail here anymore. I must be really behind. I ran into one NoBo hiker and two section hikers all day. I'm alone at the shelter again. I was desperately hoping someone would be here with the fire going, but no such luck. I crawled into my sleeping bag and ate dinner there. I'm still a fan of cookless meals, especially since you can eat them from your bed. Very glad no one was here to see me crawl around the shelter while trying to eat/prepare for tomorrow. I'm sure it would have looked a lot less coordinated than a caterpillar. And my guess is I won't look like a butterfly tomorrow.I spent most of the day concentrating on walking. I know this sounds like a given, but I mean really think about the foot, leg, knee, hip, and arm alignments on each step. I figured if I'm going to be walking every day I should probably make sure I'm good at it. I found my right leg wants to point out when I'm walking, so I practiced walking in ski line all day. My feet also hit the ground differently (inside of the foot, not heel to toe evenly) so I balanced that out as well. Also concentrating on forward motion seems to help. Instead of wasting effort going side to side, I set in my mind moving forward at a fluid rate. All of these things seemed to work and I averaged a nice pace all day (2 1/2 to 3 mph) going uphill.So that's what I got to think about today, along with a few other less interesting things. I do hope the sun comes out tomorrow so I can mention something about nature. On the plus side, I just met Chimp. I'm not going to be alone tonight!","Apple House Shelter

I have maybe 3 more miles to do today, hopefully I'll get there before dark.The morning started cold again but the sun was showing promise. I did the 6 miles into Kincora Hostel in decent time. Once there I did laundry, got a shower, charged my phone, and ate some day old spaghetti left in the fridge. Ran out of spaghetti sauce so I used mayo with salt and parmesan cheese. My hunger has hit a new level of desperation and I still have over 3/4 left to do. After I got my stuff dried and repacked, I headed out. Laurel Falls has to be one of the prettiest sections of the trail. It's all but flat and follows a wide stream for a good for miles. Huge cliffs flank the trail and what little elevation there is is in the form of well made natural stone steps. I was upset to be on a time limit going through that section. I could have spent a week there.I decided to blue blaze over to Hampton for a resupply. That trail also followed a stream and then turned off into a honeysuckle garden. It was almost perfect till I got too busy looking around and fell off the trail. I went down on my arm and hip. I came out with only two cuts and was very happy no one was around.So that brings me up to now. I'm resupplied and just got my food at the bar. Two beers might as well be 10 now with my metabolism.

I was offered fig newtons within the first 5 minutes and yoga boy was among the group. It was an amazing night. I slept under the stars for the first time. With the exception of a little morning dew it was quite pleasant to wake up looking at trees.The day was sunny and comfortable. I spent the day flip flopping with people from the night before. We all ended up eating lunch around the same time and I took an extra two hours stretching and relaxing. Fourteen miles today allowed me to take a very slow pace and enjoy the trail.

We've got Starbuck from Oklahoma, XJ from Maryland, Yoga Boy from Ohio, Big foot and Predator from Australia, and Strider from Virginia Beach. Someone in camp just started playing ""The Bird is the Word""... Really random group out here.I've had some time to think about nature while I've been out here. I'd like to share a bit about how I see it now...There is always something going on in nature. You could spend a lifetime in each step of the trail and still witness something new every day. You get to see life cycle itself all around you. From a fallen tree comes a habitat for ants, new saplings sprout from the rotted stump. This is all well known and not difficult to imagine. I find the real beauty is in natures reclamation.It's a slow, nonviolent progression of new life. It has no prejudice on where it grows and it is unrelenting. The trail itself is a perfect example. It is not a strait line worn in by millions of travelers. It is a wavering pathway, sometimes only two inches wide because of the vegetation on either side. Sometimes it is completely covered up by a downed tree. Other times you could walk four people across on the root beds. Regardless of the efforts put forth by the maintainers, there is always a steady progression of nature. I've seen trees grow over metal signs, through barbed wire fences, and through the cracks in cement. With or without us, nature will continue.I thank that's the greatest feeling out here. Whether you believe in the world ending in nuclear war, global warming, or the rapture, nature WILL continue to exist. It is arrogant of us to think we could be responsible for the downfall of such a perfect system. While we are having profound effects on the current state of things, nature will surely outlast us if we continue down this path. Why do we put ourselves in conflict with such a benin and immortal enemy? Why do we think we can tame the weather or stamp out what causes us discomfort? Nature will outlast us and anything we try to do to stop it.We should not presume to know what is best for nature, nature will work it out itself. There is a natural law of life which will allow new life to grow from the dead. All life has been borrow from nature and will eventually return again. It is not written that our species has a permanent place in this system.Why not ally ourselves with such a force? Why think we're above the laws that govern everything else on earth? It's a tangent right now, but I'll be able to piece together a comprehensive entry or paper from that at some point in the future. I'm glad to experience this hike. I'm glad to be reminded every day where I fit in in the cycle of life.There could be exciting news tomorrow but it won't be posted till sunday if it happens.

It got a bit heated.Yoga Boy and I went to Quincies for a calzone and soda, vowing not to drink tonight because of the hike tomorrow. Everything was going well until Kong came in and told us we had to go with him. Kong has been staying in town for a week or two due to an injury and apparently has made a good impression on the locals (yesterday he attended a local wedding as a guest). So today he found us a local party to go to. All he said was ""Get in the truck"". So with the chance of a new experience, we got in the truck.We were taken 5 miles up the road to a farm that had a picnic setup in the field. Picnic may be too reserved a term for the food there. They had 4 full racks of bbq ribs with corn on the cob, onions, potatoes, two kinds of pie, and cases of beer. There were only 6 or 7 locals there for all that food! We were welcomed in as part of the family and soon had all we could handle of the bbq and corn.A thunderstorm broke up the party 2 hours later, but again we were invited to another house to continue the evenings festivities. So five of us and a driver pile into a four seater car and drive back towards town.The house ended up being owned by someone at Quincies, and eventually the staff ended up at the house with us. We were led up to the second floor of their garage which turned out to be a music room! Apparently the former tenants (or current?) used to be in a band and had this space for practicing. It had three or four stacks of amps and a twelve piece drum set!!! For those that don't know, I've played drums for fourteen years.

It allowed us to miss two mountains on the AT, which was definitely for the better. Even with the Creeper being flat, I still found excuses to complain about walking... I'm glad Yoga Boy could put up with it. At least I had a sense of humor about it.We jumped in the stream in the afternoon, but the water was way too cold to stay in. We passed a construction zone on the trail. If you really think about it, it was an odd encounter. Here we are in the middle of the woods and we come across a bulldozer, jackhammer, and steel cutter. The bulldozer was right in the trail moving piles of dirt. We had to get the other workers to stop the driver before we could safely pass. Very odd experience.Spent the night at the shelter with plenty of friends. Looking forward to bigger miles tomorrow.","Damascus

It wasn't too bad now that it's warmer, it's like and unexpected occasion to get clean.Took lunch after the rain stopped and the sun came out. I'm glad it did come out because we hit the Gracen Highlands in the afternoon! It's a beautiful landscape with wide open rolling hills, perfectly strewn boulders, and wild ponies. At first I thought we would only catch a glimpse of the ponies, I was wrong. We had to actually walk around the ponies because they were walking up the A.T. towards us and NOT getting out of the way. Some hikers were petting them. One pony ended up coming into Thomas Knob Shelter and started licking the building. It was a very close encounter to say the least.After all the scenery and horses Yoga Boy and I made quick time to the shelter and arrived seconds before a rain storm. We sprinted the last 200 yards to make it in time. The guys behind us weren't so lucky and ended up soaked within minutes of the rain starting. The storm lasted 15 minutes but forced most people into the shelter. One guy took the picnic table.Wonderful day all around. I strongly encourage a visit to the Highlands!","Lost Mountain Shelter

I apologized for our smell. She said ""You just smell like money to me"". That has to be the most honest person I've ever met.Packed out some beer and had a great night hanging out with Yoga Boy.

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/348976,"So We ran out of water last night and had to hike 2 1/2 miles to Timpi Shelter to get more. Somewhere in that time I lost track of Yoga Boy and he ended up missing the shelter. I waited two hours there rehydrating, talking with other hikers, eating breakfast, and stretching. I finally caught up with him four miles outside Partnership Shelter. He had been so out of it from the lack of water that he completely missed the turnoff for the shelter. Next time we're just going to pack water out of the town.It's funny about the water out here. We're so used to mountain spring water now that city water has a foul taste to it. I've seen hikers dump liters of water from town at the first spring we cross. The difference is that noticeable. Another observation: I've seen hikers drop a bag of trail mix in the dirt and think nothing of picking up the pieces and eating them. The real hardcore guys will drop something at a restaurant and not touch it again. Funny how nature is cleaner than the public spaces we eat at.So the shelter was a full house with 20 of us there. There's a pizza place that delivers to the shelter! I got a large cheese pizza and ate it all... Still hungry too. Hikers diets are expensive but luckily not picky.Rain storm came in and put us all indoors around dark. Met one of the many characters out here: Mississippi Jack. He's been on the trail 9 years and is a cliche veteran from Vietnam (This is only a reference point and is not meant to offend). He was cornering people for conversation and had a very backwoods way of telling stories... ""if a bullfrog had wings it wouldn't hit it's ass every time it jumped"". I couldn't say what all he was talking about, most people weren't sure either, but it did provide us with a very humorous night with everyone having a good time. I was glad to have met him and hope to see him again in the future.More rain overnight with storms scattered the rest of the week. It's getting into the 90's as well.

Most other hikers took a shuttle to town for a resupply.It rained off and on during the day, but the temperature was comfortable enough to stay in shorts.There are more fields in Virginia, which makes the hike seem longer. I don't enjoy seeing where I'm going because it takes forever to get there. I resupplied at a gas station in Atkins. I accidentally went to the Shell instead of the Exxon like the guidebook said. The choice was bad and overpriced, but I did find wasabi flavored peanuts that were delicious.I decided to go to The Barn Restaurant and wait for the other hikers to come in. I got a one pound burger for $6! I charged my phone and tracked down a mail drop I accidentally had sent to a hostel that is closed this year. As it turns out, my server ran the hostel and had my package at the restaurant! So I spent five hours at The Barn waiting for Yoga Boy to catch up, but thunderstorms kept rolling in and I wanted to catch a break in the storm to hike and setup camp. Tin Man and Strawberry came in just as I was finishing up my journals. I've been hiking with them on and off since getting back on the trail (along with Strawberry's dog Kiwi). Tin Man lives in the area and his girlfriend was there to take them into town for a night indoors. I accepted their offer to go.We ended up at the movies that night to see The Hangover II.

It was an excellent breakfast!We decided to slack pack the day and meet back up with Tin Man's girlfriend Pam. We started around 1pm and had till 5pm to complete the miles. It was a fast pace but still easier without the full pack weight. Kiwi (Strawberry's dog) was a great hiking companion. She would travel from the first person in line to the last, sometimes a mile apart, herding us all together. She tried to keep us all within sight of each other and would wait at a trail turn to make sure you took the right way. She must have done double the miles as everyone else and still had the energy to part frisbee at the end of the day. For only joining them for a day, Kiwi still decided to keep track of me. So we met back up with Pam and decided to stay around the area another day. We went to her parents cabin up in the mountains, showered, AND did laundry! Somehow sushi came up so we all went out for some quality food.Tomorrow her parents are having a shrimp boil so of course I will be taking a zero. The view from the cabin is amazing and I have a bed or couch to sleep on. I am not upset about leaving the trail for a day...

Other than that we hung out with Pam's family on the cabin's porch. That evening Tin Man, Strawberry, Pam, and I all went to Applebee's for a drink. We came up with the AT Hiker Shot out of boredom and a friendly bartender. We had Southern Comfort for Georgia (Peach), Jack Daniels for Tennessee, and Apple Puckers and apple juice for Virginia. We still haven't figured out an ingredient for North Carolina but we're looking for suggestions. The shot actually tasted pretty good and we decided we needed to add an ingredient for each state as we continue the hike.

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/350265,"In an effort to combat the heat I took a morning swim at Laurel Creek. It was very enjoyable but the water was a bit cold at 10am. After an hour break there I came across a cooler full of Gatorade! This was right next to the best outfitted camp on the trail. The campsite had a picnic table, recliner, couch, car seat, tire swing, broken tv, broken laptop, and a porcilin(?) toilet just set on the ground. Not sure what hiking club was responsible for the camp site but I think they have great taste.After acouple more miles I came up to the road and hitched into Bland, VA. I ended up walking down the wrong direction for two miles at first and had to literally stand in front of a car to get them to take me into town. It was the only car I had seen on the dirt road and it was right before the trail went back into the woods, AND he was heading there anyway... so I didn't feel too bad about making such a scene.I stayed at the gas station in Bland for two or three hours enjoying the air conditioning and hamburgers they had to offer before I finally resupplied and mailed a letter back home. I just learned today that the letter I had sent containing my cameras memory card just arrived back home without the camera card in the letter (and a tear in the envelope). I REALLY hope the card was not lost as it contains around 400 pictures and videos of the trail from the end of the Smokies until Damascus. Besides this journal, it's the only record I'll have of the trail to share with others. Hopefully I'll have some good news soon.So I hitched out of town to find Yoga Boy, Hollar, Radio, Big Ben, and Noodles waiting at the trail head. The last three were new hikers I hadn't met before but soon became very good friends. With the exception of Big Ben (who does WAY too many miles for me) , I hope to continue to hike with the others. I bypassed the shelter to attempt to cut down on the miles for the next day. Hiking around dusk I saw three bear cubs that treed themselves as I came by. The mother (on the other side of the hill, out of view) was making terrible snorting noises and loud growls so I decided not to take the time to get a good picture. I hiked on very quickly and cowboy camped with Hollar and Yoga Boy a mile or two later.","Jenkins Shelter

Apparently during hunting season these deer have no fear of humans. Yoga Boy screamed and ran after the one ""just to give it a healthy fear of humans"". We're out here saving the wildlife, one deer at a time.Took plenty of breaks during the day. Two hours were spent at Jenny Knob Shelter and another hour was spent at a suspension bridge. As the days are getting hotter our breaks are getting longer.We camped at Dismal Creek Falls which is .3 miles off the trail and WORTH THE TRIP! If you're planning to hike the trail I would strongly suggest you take this side trail and camp for the evening.The falls were about 20 feet high and 30 feet across. There were two 6-7ft swimming holes and some of the guys actually jumped from the cliff into the pools. There was camping on both sides of the creek with a huge log (40ft long) layed across the banks. I would not suggest trying to cross it during the night as during the day it was still challenging to walk across. About a dozen of us were camped there and a few guys brought up some beer from the store a mile back on the trail. They also bought two foot long pepperoni logs they they attempted to roast over the fire.All in all it was a great night and felt amazing to go to sleep feeling clean from the swim.","Camp Site 588.8

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/350274,"Nice weather today, the miles went by very quickly.The hostel itself is a must for anyone hiking the trail. Neville and Michael have setup the perfect getaway enviroment for hikers and visitors alike. It's a community run hostel so everyone pitches in to help the place function. It's not laborous work, it's actually very fulfilling and helps you feel like you're part of the place. The hikers lodge used to be an old barn but now is an open air cabin of sorts. It has electricity (two light bulbs and a fridge stocked with soda!), there's a hammock and couch on the porch, a table and chairs, bookself, and upstairs is filled with mattresses for sleeping. The shower is outdoors for hikers. The barn has a well worn feel to it and plenty of history, but is very well maintained.The main house was the original cabin built back in 1890. It has been built onto twice since then and has 3 indoor rooms with beds for the more 'important' customers (aka people not on the hiker budget). Everything is wooden in the house and everything matches the feel of the place. There are musical instruments throughout the house. Both Neville and Michael are massage therapists so there is a massage room with a suana and whirlpool bath. Every afternoon Neville leads a yoga session. Me, Yoga Boy (duh), Hollar, Radio, Noodles, Colorado, and Big Ben all participated. I stetch twice every day, but this was a whole new level. I have been using what I've learned since then. We all spread out mats on the front lawn in a big circle and took a good hour. More hikers came up during the session and joined our conversation, shared our laughs, and made it all far less awkward than yoga can sometimes be for new comers. Dinner was amazing! We had steak sandwiches, fries, a huge fresh salad from the garden, and the most wonderful fresh baked bread (that is a staple for every meal). We all pitched in with cooking and cleaning. Instead of it being a chore, the number of people helping out turned it into a social event AND made the work take only minutes. That evening (after I layed down because I ate too much for dinner, which I didn't think was possible), we had a bon fire and blue grass music played by Straw Hat. Straw Hat was another hiker who was staying there for a week who used to be a musician before coming out on the trail. Neville and Michael joined all the hikers around the fire and sang some music themselves. It was very refreshing to have the owners be a part of our fun. We were treated as equals for the entire stay, which made it much more comfortable for everyone. We weren't served or waited upon or lectured or treated as a paying customer. We were treated as personal friends of the family. We were expected to treat the house as we would treat our own house. We were asked to help in the kitchen as if we had been going there for years. It really was a wonderful feeling to find comfort so far from home.","Dismal Creek Falls

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/350278,"So I didn't plan a zero but I'm not complaining.We put our laundry in after breakfast and waited around till it was complete. In the mean time I wore shorts (which were 4 inches smaller than I used to wear... which was a good feeling) and a nylon North Carolina Panthers longsleeve shirt with the cuffs cut off. I rolled up the sleeves of it into a muscle shirt. That paired with the tight short shorts was a pretty stunning picture (which I got plenty of). We waited to take a shuttle into town until after our laundry was done, but I wore the outfit all the same. Luckily we went to Walmart, so I didn't stick out too badly in my poor choice of clothing. We spent far too long in Walmart and I got way too much food. By the time we got back it was close to 2pm and was too late for me to cover the 18 miles I was supposed to that day. I decided to stay an extra day.We did yoga again and I helped cook dinner. We made pizza from scratch on the back porch of the kitchen. Neville rolled the dough out while me and three other hikers put together whatever toppings we wanted. There were four kinds of sauce and 10 different toppings to choose from. They had a brick oven out back of the house were Michael cooked all 15 pizzas we put together. Dinner was served out on the front lawn and we all sat around the fire pit for music and food.That evening Neville had a meditation session for anyone who wanted to join. There were four of us in the room and we sat in silence for 20 minutes. It was something I didn't think I was capable of doing with such calm. Hiking every day has calmed me down even more than I was before.I'll be sad to hike on tomorrow but I'm learning that there is always a new place yet to be discovered.

From there the owner gave me a ride up the road to his farm which was 10 miles short of New Castle. I stopped in a general store which was the most stereotypical southern gas station I could think of. It had one pump outside that probably didn't even work. Inside were two shelves of items, a soda cooler, and an ice cream freezer. There were 4 recliners in the corner where the shop keeper and a local were sitting... talking about the heat... and about keeping a shotgun under the counter. I'm not doing a great job explaining this setting, but all it needed was a banjo.I got an ice cream bar and a gatorade and sat outside looking for a ride. Three kittens patroled the yard and helped clean the wrapper of my ice cream bar. Pretty soon a truck came along and took me another seven miles up the road. After walking another mile or so a second driver took me the rest of the way into New Castle.I made a call home and to my doctor looking for a prescription to get rid of the poison ivy. They said they couldn't help. I was recommended by a store owner to a walkin doctor down the street. I got there right before close so I need to go back first thing tomorrow. Luckily the doctor there is a section hiker and will be able to help me out tomorrow.I was recommended to a Bed and Breakfast just up the street from the doctors.

I got the right prescription and he mentioned he's heading towards Katawba and could drop me off on the trail again. I went back to the bed and breakfast to get my things and say goodbye to the owners. They wouldn't allow me to pay for anything they provided!

We finish the night with ice cream. Best zero ever.As a side note, the running shorts work beautifully. They're 5 inches long and have a liner built in.They are by far the most comfortable thing to hike in in any type of warm weather. Get over how goofy they look, they work. Find them at Dicks or any running store.The next morning we go to Dunkin Donuts for breakfast and he drops me on the trail.

Achilles and I try this for awhile too and find that it is possible to see ' something' at night, but soon decide that 'something' isn't enough for us. We end up walking ahead of Yoga Boy so as not to blind his night vision with our lights. We make sure he's behind us every once in awhile by making bird calls in the night.

I didn't say we had the best ideas, but they're making these miles the best they've ever been.The forest turns into this black and white dreamland when you're hiking at night. The landscapes were lit up by the moon in this brilliant white light. You only see four feet in front of you and can't tell how long you're going up or down. Time and distance seem to stop existing. You're out there and you hike until you get there. No landmarks, no times, no milestones... Just get there when you do and not before. We came up with a hiking mantra ""Don't worry, We'll get there"". It answers every question in hiking we used to be concerned about. ""What time is it"" or ""where are we"" or ""where are we stopping tonight"" is now answered by ""don't worry, we'll get there"". It works. It takes all the stress out of it and allows you to trust in your body til it says to stop. We set no goals for the night, we set destinations to decide at. We'd get another 3 miles and reconvene to decide about the next stopping place. This system had proven itself to me to cover big miles with no stress.We made it to Punchbowl around midnight. We missed the trail the first time and backtracked uphill .2 miles to the right trail. We setup tents, I ate dinner, and went to sleep.","Matts Creek Shelter

We took our time at a river crossing, then spent 2 hours at some trail magic from 'The Milage Assassins', a couple doing trail magic for 20 years. We traded stories and ate eggs and drank cokes for far too long.Again we found ourselves at a shelter at dusk 'amping up' for another night hike.Big payoff again. Huge miles overnight and got into camp at 1am. More hilarious than last night, brighter moon, even more dreamlike. At the end of the night none of us could keep from laughing. We had no idea where we were going or why we were doing it, but we got 'there'. Our hiking mantra payed off. Ended up waking up some campers at midnight when I ran a half mile down to a water source to grab two more liters of water to keep hiking. It was midnight, I was running down the trail, a half mile, for more water to hike farther. We ate our dinner there. When would I ever be okay with running a half mile off trail for water? Let alone midnight? Good decisions.Got into camp late, stayed up till 2am updating and eating. The Pod is starting to become a thing.","Punchbowl Shelter

There is no possible way for me to remember all that happened. Over time the memories I have of those miles will fade away and all I'll be left with is one or two stories and a general idea of how I was feeling through that section of the trail. So that's all I have to offer to you.I have been having a difficult time physically, mentally, and financially. I am beginning to understand what it means to commit to something and to follow through regardless of the difficulty. I will be finishing this trail as it was intended to be finished, by walking from Georgia to Maine. There have been a few times when I have tried to cut corners, walk on roads, hitch hike, or blue blaze. This will not be happening any more, and I intend to hike the sections I've missed after summiting. My end date at Katahdin will be Sept. 25th. After that I will be taking one or two weeks to complete some sections missed in Virginia.I don't always have a chance to post what I've been doing, and frankly it has come in the way of me hiking. Given the choice, I will be hiking. I will post when I can.

I setup early next to a spring, built a fire, and cooked my first meal on the trail in 2 months. I decided to start carrying my stove again. Bad night of sleep but it was my first night back in two weeks.Got out of bed around 830. Late start because my camelpack decided to start leaking. Not sure if the problem is fixed now. Ran into Honey bee and Chickadee on the trail and hiked with them for most of the morning. Great company to have and they kept a good pace. I left them after lunch to push ahead.Found out the spring was dry so only had a cup of water to last me 5 miles. Dropped into Port Clinton pretty dehydrated. Not my fault the water source was dry! I drank 2 liters of water, 2gateraids, and a coke in Port Clinton. I was proud of myself for only spending 4 dollars and 1 hour in town. I kicked a stick earlier today and I think it bruised my ankle. It feels like the same muscle as my last injury... I'm hoping it'll be better by morning. At least it's the right ankle this time.Also saw my first rattler today! I was with Honeybee and Chickadee when it started making noise, about 10ft off the trail. Got some good pictures.Another 20+ day tomorrow. I'll be pushing these miles till I catch up with the rest of the group. Already passed a few, but the big bubble is two days ahead.

I just had a terrible day. It would have been great if the spring i'm camping at tonight was running, but it's not. The spring is dry so I can't eat dinner tonight after pushing hard miles, which means I won't be recovering much strength overnight. On the plus side it's raining! Other than that the view from Bake Oven was great. The spring just south of town was an amazing piped spring with ice cold water. I took a hobo bath there. Got a nice hitch into town right next to the post office. Got my mail drop and hung out in Subway for two hours. Made friends with a girl on staff there who's nother invited me to spend the night. In hindsight, I wish I was there and not here starving and dehydrating myself. At least I got my miles done? Sigh....The hike out of town was 1,000ft up a rock cliff. Not kidding, it was a mountain of boulders one thousandfeet high. Didn't help that I hit it at 4 in the afternoon in full 90 degree heat for five exposed miles on the edge of the ridge. Someone needs to warn me about these things. I ran the next 5 miles in hopes of beating the rain storm which was supposed to hale. I almost made it.

",Sunfish Pond,"Jul 20, Wed",21.60
Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/357300,"It's difficult for me to fill in the gaps of my trip, but I'll try to summarize best I can with one long entry.The heat wave hit the day after Sunfish Pond. 90-100 degree temperatures for three days. I managed 18 miles the day after Sunfish. Saw three bears and one very large rattle snake which Achilles tried to provoke. Luckily he didn't succeed. I drank 15 liters of water and could barely move by the time I made it to the shelter. Every movement took effort and I had to prop myself up in the shelter to cook dinner. I had taken 2400 milligrams of Ibuprofen to keep the pain in my shin down. Of course this backfired on me and my body rejected the medicine. My system couldn't process the medication anymore so instead of making my shin less painful, it made my entire body fatigued. Next day it took me two hours to walk the three and a half miles to the next road crossing. After some time spent in Gyp's Tavern, I secured a ride off the trail to a friend of the families house. I was fortunate to have a place to recover and escape the heat. I spent three relaxing days there, resupplied, and visited an Eastern Mountain Sports in search of fixing my stove (which ended up not being broken in the first place). While at EMS, I fooled a few customers into thinking I worked there by offering them useful advice on outdoor gear... at least I know I have a future career.I spent three more days at a friends house from high school that now lives in northern Jersey. She and her fiancee are in preparations for their wedding next month, which was a completely new world to me. I never thought I'd find so much enjoyment in tying bows on all the party favors.So after six days off, I was physically doing better. Mentally I had been suffering for much longer than my shin had been hurting. My dad came to pick me up and bring me home. I was pretty certain I was done with my journey, but was unhappy with the way I existed the trail. I didn't get a chance to say goodbye to the trail and all the people I shared it with. After an hour of being home, I packed my car and drove back up to the trail to find my friends. The next couple of days I shuttled countless new and old friends, got some little hiking days in, and made it a point to enjoy every minute of it. My enjoyment was no longer in the trail, though hiking in small amounts was very pleasant, instead it was found in the people I shared the experience with. They are what I am going to miss. I wish I could have stayed there next to them and summited the final mountain with them, but it was no longer in me to complete the trail. I think I can say I've found what I was looking for when I started this hike. I had taken this journey in order to escape from the world I had created for myself. Obviously I was unhappy with my life when I had begun and I had made it my goal to find what answers the trail could give me. I don't think I can voice all that I learned, but I'll try to explain what I can in hopes that you may experience something similar but unique.Above all, I've learned that I alone am responsible for my mental attitude. I make my own happiness, my own sadness, my own emotions and thoughts. I have a choice every day to view it as I choose, and it is not reliant on what someone else may think. Every day I can find the same peace in strolling through miles of green trees and blue skies as I can in driving to work, cleaning my room, or cooking dinner. All these things can be treated with the same enjoyment if you are willing to do so. I alone am responsible for finding contentment in all that I do. Also, I discovered the feeling of accomplishment and self motivation... something that I believed I lacked. It could arguably be said that I still lack motivation and accomplishment because I did not finish the trip, to which I will say I have not finished the trail 'yet'. I will be finishing this hike at a later date when I find it necessary or enjoyable to complete what I have started. That said, I have taken these past few days at home to set short and long term goals in my head and work daily at accomplishing them. I am moving forward. Stagnation caused a rotting in me that took many weeks and miles to shake off. This trip was a chance for me to remove myself from the life I had created, and to rebuild. The success of that plan never hinged on the completion of the trail. When the weight of the life waiting for me at home was heavier than the freedom the trail offered, my thoughts were only for home. I love the trail, and though I was still out hiking, I was failing to experience it. My thoughts weren't there on the trail, they were back at home planning a future, so I followed my thoughts and returned home. Maybe I'll find I am not as mentally strong as I should have been. Maybe I'll find a way to think more towards the future of things instead of living in the present. It seems that many others I have hiked with have a strong belief in the destination, and I have no doubt they will accomplish their goal of thru hiking the Appalachian Trail. But know that I have also reached my goal. I have come back to participate fully in the culture I was so willing to leave behind.  So this is where I leave my final thoughts on the hike, but really, it was never about hiking.","Sunfish Pond

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609629,"I had the opportunity yesterday with the nice weather to get a 9 mile prep hike in with two friends around the Gettysburg battlefields.  My pack was loaded with about 30 lbs which is close to what I plan on carrying in May.
Even with all the road walking and exposed paths it was an enjoyable day with the company I had.  My Solomon XAComps are not going to make the cut as my trail shoe, they are causing the same aggravation in my ankles I experienced in 2011, and I would be silly to remain loyal to the shoe even though I have immense respect for it's construction.  I will try the next hike (two weeks) with the Merrell's I have been using for work.  I'm hopeful the shoe is the issue and not my ankles.  I have decided to use Superfeet (blue) inserts this time instead of the green.  It hits my arch more correctly than the green and even with it's lower profile it still provided enough support that my arches didn't collapse over the 9 miles.  
The only part that's sore is my hips, which are out of alignment due to hypertension.  I am looking forward to stretching out everyday on my hike, but I'm aware of how much the first few weeks are going to hurt.  I'll keep ibuprofen in my pack along with topical cbd ointment for muscle aches. 
I wore a new pair of running shorts which worked out fine but I will still carry Glide with me to reduce friction.  Darn Tuff lightweight socks were actually a bit heavy (even for the 70 degree day) and I might consider a thinner pair.  I recommend the brand as they have a lifetime replacement warranty (or at least they did back in 2011 when I exchanged a worn out pair for brand new ones).
Other than that I'm thankful for the practice and greatly enjoyed the distillery/brewery we ate at after the hike.  I'm going to miss warm showers and a comfortable bed.  30 days left!",,View Entry,"Mar 20, Wed",0

I had a great sendoff with a Bon fire at the house, then with a family friend last night in northeast PA before hitting the trail at 10ish this morning. 
Weather was clear and 60 with no wind which made for some quiet hiking (which was good because I got a little emotional with the reality of what I started). I never thought I would have this opportunity or the follow through to finish. 
I'm feeling thankful to my friends and family, the trail,  and the loving community of people of this community who have  made today a wonderful time. 
I ran into two local bird watchers at Sunrise Mountain picnic shelter who reminded me why I love this trail and that there are good people everywhere.  Had some trail magic in the form of a clementine and gained some new information about the area and local birds as well! Spent two hours in conversation and admired the view. 
At the shelter now with Stripes who also got off the trail due to injury last year (and is also a drummer). It's nice to not be alone on my first night back and connect over getting back out here.
Hope I can stay warm tonight and have another day like this tomorrow.
P.S. The gentlemen at the pavilion said he thinks I should keep Levi as my trail name. Considering he technically gave it back to me to use, I believe I will continue under the name for this 2019 season.

I got some good stretching in and finished the book I was reading. 
Overcast most of the day, but the sun came out during my morning break overlooking High Point Lake.  Comfortable 60 degrees has been a blessing. Great hiking weather! 
The trail was covered with orange colored newts and I was having a hard time not stepping on them the first few miles. 
Ran into a section hiker named Connor from RI who was hitching out from High Point Park HQ after blowing out his knee.  Between his heavy pack and boots, plus all the rocks through this section, it looked like the right thing to do. Passed some time there before his ride came then took advantage of the public restrooms before hiking out.
Pretty quick hop to the shelter so I got in before 4pm. It gave me time to do laundry and heat up water for a warm hobo bath before dinner which is cooking now (4 cheese risotto with salmon!!).
Tomorrow is a 12 mile cruise down to the next shelter so I'm resting up tonight. Definitely glad for the shorter day as i get my legs under me. The Merrel shoes I'm wearing might not be long for this world if I can't figure out how to get them tight enough.  The downhill is causing too much sliding and these heavier socks are not breathing either. Blisters might be in my future tomorrow. 
So far so good! Little sore but that's expected.  Wish there were more hikers out here. Tonight it looks like I'm on my own. Good thing I'm surrounded by water on three sides and have a bridge to protect me! It's beautiful here.

He had negative temperatures in the smokies and has been battling high winds recently.  Many nights and days he spent alone and I think he was glad for the company (so was I).
Really late start getting out of camp at 11am. I made good time with the easy downhill,  but the trail is still really muddy.  Had to tiptoe around on rocks early in the day to avoid getting stuck in the mud (and I lost one of my rubber trekking pole tips!)
Stopped at Jim Murray's place for water and lunch. Solved the world's problems with him and his donkey while we watched the grass grow. 
Lots of boardwalks after that through swamp land filled with skunk cabbage, ferns, and little yellow flowers.  Very pretty walk. 
Some nice folks gave me a dollar in quarters so I could fill up my water before climbing up to the shelter. Met Stripes again, along with Mosey (Strider), Pilgram, and Wolf from Germany. Turns out Mosey grew up in the next town over from me and now lives in Harrisburg and Pilgram lives maybe an hour away from there. Small world and PA is representing tonight.

Ran into a hot dog stand before Wawayanda Mountain and also found two donuts at a local shop before hitching into town to resupply. I was able to get in and out of town in an hour and had good conversation with my rides. I was worried about the climb up the Stairway to Heaven (up Wawayanda Mountain) but my ride told me his 3 year old son did it, so I relaxed.
It was a climb, but I took a good pace and only stopped once. I passed a few couples but ended up at the outlook alone. Aired out my feet, ate salami from the store, watched a hawk circle the mountain, and took way too many pictures. 
Found some trail magic on the way to the shelter (white cheddar cheez its!) and got in just as the rain was starting.
Lively conversation at the shelter kept me from posting. Wolf is here with Stripes and now Achin' rolled in just before dark. We're all section hikers at this point, started in Springer and made it up till here over various years.

I slipped 5 times but didn't fall.  Others did. I'm sure the views from the top are great, but it was foggy so I saw nothing all day but rocks.

Yesterday was some hard up and down over more rocks.  The Fitzgerald Falls was a pretty section and close to the road if you head north.  I wouldn't recommend any other section of yesterday's hike unless you're a mountain goat.
Ran into a lot of company for the day which made it go by quickly.  I left camp around 730 and passed/ hiked with everyone from the shelter; Achin', Captain, Lightfoot, Popeye, Wolf, Stripes, and a day hiker named Scott with his young dog Moana.

Went through the Lemon Squeezer early in the morning. If you don't know, it's two rocks going vertical and you have to squeeze between them while heading uphill. I was able to get through without taking off my pack. The drops coming off the rocks got me a little wet but it made for a pretty effect going through the cavelike rocks.
Great views of three(?) lakes today along with rolling green mountains and New York City which was totally unexpected. Can't wait to get my camera pictures uploaded and put together a video of this section. Lots of water, big trees, blue skies, and views throughout the day!
Wolf stayed just ahead of me all day. I ran into two section hikers and two south bouncers (buffy and joyce) trying to avoid the crowds. They put in just a few miles ahead at bear mountain and will flip flop to finish at katahdin.

I wanted some peace and quiet for a change and am looking forward to a full night of sleep free from snoring and bathrooms breaks. Seems like the weather will hold until tomorrow evening.
Tomorrow is my first mail drop! I'll resupply for 3 days and get more vitamins, protein powder, plant powder, and magnesium/calcium mix for muscle relaxation. Seems to all be working out well so far. Energy is good and my recovery time is quick. 
I get my shoes and socks Friday! I'm having another mail drop sent with a bug net (they're already getting out of control) and some KT tape for my ankle. It's a great thing to be so well supported through this hike!
Bear Mountain tomorrow! Going to the zoo
Levi","Tuxedo Motel

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612769,"Wow! All of the steps today up and down was an impressive amount of work. The guidebook says over 1,000 handhewn steps, but there has to be more.
Beautiful day for a hike. Mid 60s to low 70s. I got an early start and made it to the top of Bear mountain by 830. I took a long break on the bench up there watching 5 birds circle and ate some peanutbutter while I waited for the zoo to open at 10.
The army base was running helicopters through the area which made for a noisy hike down to the zoo, but I ran into some encouraging local day hikers and had a good trip down.
The area before and after the mountain are gorgeous. It's incredible that so much green land lies immediately around a city as big as NYC. Apparently it was donated by Mary Averell Harriman, widow to the railroad magnate Edward Harriman to be used for public land to block the Sing Sing prison which was scheduled for contruction on the land.
I saw my first snake (3' black rat) this hike and a deer before the zoo.
 The zoo itself was a bit sad. Small enclosures and VERY nervous animals. The bobcat was incredible to see, but the cage wasn't much bigger than a one car garage. To add to the stress, an elementary school from the city was visiting and the kids were running wild. I'm glad they were able to experience a bit of nature (one mistook a coyote for a fox?!) but their energy was clearly too much for the animals. Seeing the bear up close was a good reminder of how powerful those animals can be.
I ran into Wolf just before the bridge, but I had to walk the mile into Ft. Montgomery to get my first mail drop. I unpacked at the pizza place across the street and caught an easy hitch back to the bridge.
It was a cool walk across the river! Great views of Bear Mountain and Ft. Montgomery along with the Hudson itself. A contruction crew was washing the bridge and I had the chance to talk to one of them. He said he likes doing sections, but could never see himself being able to do the whole trail. I mentioned the 97 year old I hiked with in 2011 and the multitude of people in their 60s out on the trail with me now. I say never count yourself out.
Another hard climb on the other side of the river and then 6 miles into camp. The weather stayed warm and sunny. I was the second one after Wolf to the pavilion, but we were joined by Pancho, Buckeye, Joke, and Stripes before too long. Great evening hanging out with two guys my age. Buckeye started Springer in January (which is crazy) and was originally planning to hike the PCT this year as well. I don't think that's the plan anymore...
Today we passed the 1400 mile marker and hit the lowest point on the AT. Nowhere to go but up!

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612875,"Another long day. Still hurting from all the steps yesterday. 
I got off to a great start today! I covered 9 miles in 3 hours and was to my lunch destination by 11:15. Only notable feature on the hike was the stone foundation of a house the revolutionary army used to inoculate soldiers for smallpox in 1776. Also, the New York trail managers stuck again by marching us up a ridge, down the ridge, and then back up the same ridge. Nice.
After a long lunch it was a lot harder to finish the 6 miles to camp. My legs ran out of steam about 2 miles before the campsite and the side trail was another half mile at least.
The campsite is nice. I'm going to sleep on top of a picnic table again because the weather is supposed to be clear. The bathhouse is open and I got a shower (or at least risnsed off) with lukewarm water.
My ankle is holding up using the tape Stripes picked up from Walmart, but I'm looking forward to getting the KT tape. This stuff has ripped off all my leg hair. Still swollen, but feels loads better (especially considering all the stairs yesterday).
New shoes tomorrow!!!! The socks didn't come in so I'll have to bounce them forward. Trying to do another 14 tomorrow and 10 on Friday to crash with Wolf at a hotel he got. He's heading to NYC Saturday and I'll be taking a zero to rest. My legs are so tired. Looking forward to recovering and getting back out! Its feels good to do these longer days, but it's still very early in the hike for me. 
Wildlife Report: I saw 3 snakes (two garter and one big black rat snake)! It was warm enough today that they came out to sun themselves on the trail. Also, a wild turkey was hanging out at last nights campsite. Tons of chipmunks. Pounds of flies.
Till tomorrow, wish me luck!

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612990,"Today had its ups and downs, literally and figuratively. Last night was my first time under the stars this hike and it was incredible to wake up in the middle of the night to a blanket of constellations overhead. I do wish it was an actual blanket because it was the cold air that woke me, but I'm sure I still managed the proper amount of sleep. One thing about going to bed with the sun, it's hard to sleep for 10 hours straight. Cold day today (around 54) but it made for good hiking. The trail went without rocks for some longer stretches and has me excited for what's ahead. That said, there were still plenty of rocky up and downs which are wrecking my ankles and knees. I was so excited about getting the 10 miles into town that I started going too fast, which I quickly paid for in the form of my left Achilles tendon and right knee in addition to a small blister on my left big toe. I spent the better part of today teaching myself to focus on the present instead of trying to run towards a fictitious goal line (and missing the opportunity for any enjoyment). I had mild success, but will have plenty more time to practice (like my whole life).Another nice hitch into town (these NY people are great) by 12:30 to the post office and i had my new shoes and socks!!! I.AM.SO.EXCITED.Went to a pizza shop for lunch with Wolf. We found our plans for a hotel and NYC are not going to work.  I guess mothers day weekend is a popular time to book rooms in the area. At least the pizza slices were gigantic.  Also, it meant I can go with my original plan and zero tomorrow at this shelter! It's supposed to rain on and off, but if I'm feeling good and there's a break in the weather I will hike the 7.8 to the next shelter.  I NEED to take a few easy days.  By my calculation, I have almost two zero days saved just in the last 4 days of hiking,  and my joints need a break now that I have proper shoes to break in. The last 4 miles with my new shoes and socks were AWESOME!! Plenty of toe room, lightweight, breathable, excellent grip, and snug fit. The soles of the shoes (Altra PEAKs) are a bit thin which helps with agility and weight, but I can see it costing me in comfort and soreness over time (I'll check back after 100 miles or so). I also wonder about the longevity of the shoe given it's lightweight construction. I think it's exactly the right shoe for how I hike and I'm looking forward to giving them a good beating in the coming months. If this pair get me to Katahdin they'll have earned my respect. So far I've been able to go tape-free on my heel, have experienced far less fatigue, no sweating (love the Darn Tuff Ultralights), and the added toe room made that little blister go away! Soooooooo happy!Still dealing with some knee pain so stretching, resting, reading, and watching the rain are on the schedule for tomorrow. If I were to do yesterday over I would have hiked the extra 5 miles to RPH shelter.  It was a cabin with bunks, had pizza delivery, a desk, trash cans,  recliner beach chairs, and it's own garden!

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613104,"So the zero didn't turn out how I planned it. 
Two section hikers from Manhattan got into the shelter last night after midnight, waking everyone up with their headlamps shining everywhere.  Really against the grain of normal hiking hours and definitely not great when the son asked me to move over to make room. You can hike your own hike, but not at the cost of waking up 3 other hikers on very different schedules. (Payback for my 2011 night hiking escapades?). I still wouldn't have had the chutzpah to ask for space if I got in past midnight. 
Stripes and Wolf left camp around 7. I was planning to zero there so I stayed in bed, read, and took a nap. By 11 I was reconsidering my choices. A cloud of fog was blowing into the shelter, soaking all my gear and making it impossible to stay warm. After eating breakfast in my sleeping bag and talking to the father for awhile (who was very pleasant), I decided to hike on to the next shelter and left camp around 12:30.
It was a quick day. The rain didn't bother me enough to keep my jacket on and the humidity kicked up shortly after. The trail was an easy downhill for most of the day and I'm still absolutely loving my new shoes. I get great speed and agility with them, leading to less trips and stumbles which really hurt my already tired tendons/joints. My right knee is still bothering me on the downhill but I'll be getting KT tape on Tuesday and will look up how to reinforce it.
Got to the shelter around 4 and had a nice long phone call to keep me company. It's a pretty shelter up on a hill overlooking a lime green canopy of leaves. There's a stream running in front over steep rocks so the sound and view are far superior. I'm glad I decided to come here.
A family of five came into the site and will be tenting here tonight. The youngest can't be more than 5 years old (and has the cutest little backpack!). This is the family's first backpacking trip and they covered 10 miles today! That's an awfully ambitious way to get into backpacking, but they seem to be in good enough spirits. I can't imagine how heavy the parents packs are! Looking forward to asking them if given the chance.
So tomorrow might be my zero, or I may go into town. I can't really decide. New York is incredibly frustrating in that it has no hostels (and super expensive hotels). It's been a week of wearing the same outfit and I'm starting to get sticky. Looks like my closest option is 50 more miles but there's an outdoor shower coming up at the railroad station. I hope this one is working! Tomorrow I'm going to take advantage of the sunny day and rinse my clothes in the stream. Then I can resupply and hike 8.8, or take that zero I was talking about.
Phone battery might be wearing out, but either way I'll be charged up again by Sunday.
I saw a raccoon today! Lots of bugs and more orange newts too! 
Still working on patience during my hike.

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613204,"Today was my first zero on the trail. In the 1400 miles I've hiked I've always taken my zeros in a town or hostel, but New York being what it is I decided to rest here for a day.
Not a bad place to stay! It was a beautiful sunny day. The family tenting behind the shelter (the youngest was 5) was up and gone by 9, so I read a few chapters of The Prince and the Pauper by Mark Twain while I waited for the sun to warm up. 
I did my laundry in the stream then took a very bracing ""bath"". By noon my clothes were on a line and I was mostly dried off which is good because a throng of NYC day hikers were soon coming at quite frequent intervals throughout the afternoon. 
I realized being 2 miles from the only rail station that offers this kind of service was to blame, and I became a 'host' to groups of gawking tourists. 
As much as I wanted a quiet day to myself, it wasn't until I found a rock just past the shelter that was big enough for me to lie down on that I avoided yet another conversation about hiking. Most days I'm happy to be an ambassador for the trail, but today I really just wanted some quiet time, and explaining thru hiking for the 5th time in a row was getting wearisome.
I was able to do some stretching, which I've been very poor at this trip. I miss hiking with Yoga Boy (2011). It's about getting limber again and avoiding this joint pain! I finally got a stretch in on the right leg that went through the heel and relaxed the Achilles. I'm looking forward to doing a 9 mile day tomorrow to see how I'm doing. I still need to get the right knee in line with the rest of me.
I layed on the rock for a good part of the afternoon, thinking about where I was and trying to find some inner peace with the massive shift my life has taken over the last few months. I'm certainly glad to be here, with the luxury of time to think about these things. I'd like to speak on this more, but maybe not just yet.
Orange Blaze and Wagon Hammer joined me in the shelter along with Sargent Major tenting. All are northbound from Springer. Nice people and had some great laughs about the trail so far. We're all in agreement that New York is not a great section of trail.
I'm glad I took the day and rested. Its been hard, getting passed by guys twice my age, but I need to stick with my plan and realize I'm not going to find someone going my pace from now until Maine. It's going to be short term friendships or one night acquaintances and I'm just going to have to keep myself company, so I guess I better like me by the end of this. If there are more days like today I think I'll be just fine.
It's a very different hike and I'm just getting started, but I'm very much looking forward to my days ahead.

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613329,"Today it rained... All day
I hiked the 3 miles to the road crossing and then the half mile to Tony's Deli to resupply and charge my phone. I had a philly cheese steak and large fry while waiting and then paid way too much for simple gas station type resupply for the next two days.
It was cold. Even in the deli it was cold. 
I hiked another 5 miles while the temperature steadily dropped. My rain jacket, pants, boots, shirt, and socks were soaking wet and my hands stopped working properly. The trail wasn't a path so much as a stream. In many parts there was nothing to do but slog through 3 inches of water or 2 inches of mud. Even the stepping rocks in the stream were flooded over.
Just as I came to the last road 0.4 before the shelter I met an equally lonely, cold, soaked hiker name Redd Up. Having had a very similar day, she had already looked ahead and called Hudson from Bearded Woods 'One of a Kind' hostel and was getting shuttled off to spend the night indoors.
I didn't take much convincing to know she had the right idea. There is no end to the rain till Wednesday and temps were hitting the 30s with snow in the forecast at the shelter I was planning to stay in.
I am not prepared for this weather. My rain jacket can't keep me dry and my sleeping bag is rated for 45 degrees. Half my gear was soaked and I couldn't use my hands and the only break in the weather was three days away. I am unashamedly a fair weather hiker and I don't need any more freezing nights to prove I can do it. I'm out here to enjoy myself and had only planned for 40 degrees or more in temperatures. It's the middle of May!!! Hiking wasn't the problem, it was stopping that worried me. 
It took 3 hours to get my hands warm.  The thermostat in Hudson's truck read 37 degrees when he picked us up.
An hour later we're shown into a gorgeous home I would love to call my own.  Hudson renovated the basement with custom woodwork throughout, cork and hardwood floors, wood stove with radiant floor heating, and some super comfy leather sofas. I'll get some pictures up tomorrow and expand on this place.  It's a dream. 
I'm going to have to wait out this weather at least through tomorrow.  It's unfortunate to take two zeros almost back to back, but I'm still not even close to behind schedule. My budget will need revising, but that's manageable. This is better than freezing the next two nights.
Hudson's wife made chicken pot pie for dinner and I watched Dumb and Dumber while Redd Up knitted. I got a very hot shower and Hudson did our laundry while I wore loaner pajama pants and a button down shirt.  Our boots are drying by the wood stove and I'm laying on a mattress with sheets. 
Life is good

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613490,"Today I left New York! Sorry, but it really is the lowest point on the AT.
My zero yesterday was great! Apparently it was the second coldest low on record (by 1 degree), and it's also breaking records for rainfall in April and May. I don't feel so embarrassed about my lack of preparedness or judgment for what I expected May weather to be. Good thing I'm still surviving with the help of my fellow hikers and wonderful hostel owners.
I watched Wild, wrote a letter, read a bit, ordered some new gear, and socialized with Redd Up, Crash, and Aiden. It seems like a lot of hikers were getting off the last two days to weather the storm indoors. Dinner was rotisserie chicken with fries! Hudson and Lo are wonderful hosts and I felt at home.
This morning I got another hot shower, and Lo made this gluten free cheesy egg quiche with sausage and toast. Redd Up and I got to the trail by 9 and the weather quickly heated up so I was comfortable in pants and a tee shirt. Before long we crossed into Connecticut!!
I'm not making this up, there was an immediate change to the trail. This state is beautiful! I had a great time walking on dirt paths and the Ten Mile river was gigantic from all the rain! I took lunch at the shelter there and then climbed Schaghticoke Mountain and found Hound who was a northbounder from PA! 
The rest of the afternoon was a blur, mainly because of the speed at which he was moving. I kept up (for the most part) and we were both glad for the company. Before I knew it I was at the shelter.
There's a group of five college guys just finished with classes staying here with me. It's been fun chatting with them and giving a few pointers on distance hiking. They're out for 5 days and seem to be in good spirits considering the cold. 
I had a box of mac and cheese with half a block of Vermont seriously sharp cheddar and 10 ounches of leftover rotisserie chicken for dinner tonight and it was glorious.
The rain just started and the new roof on this shelter doesn't look entirely waterproof based on the puddles on the floor. I hope I picked a dry corner. Tonight is a low of 38 degrees but thankfully my gear is dry. I'm going to wrap my tent around my bag for heat tonight and hope I don't get too sweaty.Tomorrow is supposed to get up to 60 and I'll be picking up my mail drop in Kent first thing in the morning! (Bug net here I come!). I have 10.5 miles planned and should come up just short of the Guinea Brook ford. If I'm feeling good I might turn it into a 13 mile day, but we'll  see what the day brings and if the water is low enough. Definitely going to take it slower tomorrow and enjoy this beautiful trail!

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613576,"Beautiful weather today!
The temperature didn't get down below 40 last night and I was comfy without needing to wrap my bag with the tent. The rain went on through most of the night and into the morning, but we were given a beautiful clear sunrise to wake up to with sunlight coming through the trees. I slept well to the sound of rain and the rushing creek a few yards in front of the shelter.
I ate breakfast with Redd Up and shared my coffee crumble cake. I was a bit later getting out of camp because I had to wait for the privy! 
It was .3 to the road crossing where I caught up with Redd Up. Her heel was hurting from a bad slip yesterday so we both were hitching to town. Unfortunately, after a half hour of trying to get a ride, we ended up walking the .8 to Kent.
Kent is a beautiful New England town that consists of a very fancy boarding school, expensive small boutiques, and well manicured properties. It seems most homes there are weekend homes (or Bonus Homes as my hitch back told me later, in that the New Yorkers get a bonus and buy a house to avoid the taxes). It's a great little town and the grocery store had fair prices, but I don't think I'd fit in. Maybe someday I'll be a teacher at the school! It sits at the base of the mountain with a river running through campus. It was for high school age, but looked better than my college campus (everyone was better dressed as well).
I left Redd Up at the edge of town. I headed to the post office and she went to the doctors. I got my maildrop and mailed home a camera card and letter. In the package from home I received a very useful, custom, bug net, new rubber tips for my trekking poles, super glue, 2 days of food, fuel, new earplugs,  and a home made card from my niece which was unexpected and wonderful.
I bought a banana and smoked sausage at the grocery store, got replacement insoles for my shoes at the pharmacy, and managed a hitch back to the trail by 11:30.  
It was warm enough for shorts and tee shirt this afternoon and the sun stayed out all day.  I ran into two section hikers headed south after Caleb's Peak and took a nice lunch at the top of St. John's Ledges. I'm glad I took a break at the top because the rest was straight down! I'm also glad it wasn't raining or it would have been like New York all over again (see, I can be fair). Even with the fair weather parts of the trail were still washed out and I had to watch where i was stepping to avoid the mud. 
After the ledges it was a quick, flat, road walk to the shelter.  The road follows a river (it's called River Road) and I'm concerned about how high the water is for my ford across Guinea Brook tomorrow. I'll just have to see when I get there! 
I ran into a jogger and a very relaxed raccoon.  The raccoon was trotting down the trail, looking at it's feet (like all us hikers who get lost in our thoughts). It wasn't until I clicked my poles together that it looked up, stopped, and chose a new path into the woods all nonchalant. I guess it's a mama feeding her kids and was much too weary to care much for me. 
The shelter is again beautifully laid out, complete with trail maps and designated, labeled, campsites and bear boxes. Looks like it's just me for the night. I finished my book and had way too much to eat for dinner considering my short mileage. I cut it short today at the shelter because I didn't want to tent in the rain they're calling for tonight. That means I'll be trying for longer mileage tomorrow to keep on track with my resupplied. Shouldn't be a problem because I'll have a full day of good weather to hike and no snoring (besides my own) to keep me up tonight.
I got an email from Redd Up saying it was a stress fracture and she's off the trail this season. Sad news for anyone to cut their hike short, especially from one who has been so encouraging and positive. I will miss her joy and energy, but look forward to meeting up when I finish. Hiker convention at Midstate Distillery in Harrisburg end of August anyone?
So happy for my trekking pole tips today! I was able to sneak up on that raccoon in addition to two deer and a lot of chipmunks. It was also nice having better grip on the rocks going down the ledges. Thank you home team!
Suns going down and I'm about to fall asleep. I hope these chirping birds do the same.

The water was strong but not dangerous. I wouldn't recommend those rocks across the stream. It's way safer walking across the stream bed.After that I ran into a couple who lives on the same street as Hudson and we passed by the hostel this afternoon. We had a great few miles talking about Jack and the Pauper, Trilliums, and garlic mustard.  From there it was a steep climb to the shelter for lunch and an extra .5 miles for water. I spent about 45 minutes drying out from all the sweat and used a liter of water to rinse off.  Ran into two section hikers on their way south. The afternoon was good trail.  Slightly rolling with short 75 foot ups and not too many rocks. I made it to my destination campsite (planned two days ago) by about 1:30 but decided to keep going because of the nice weather and because it was so early in the day.The trail ended up staying nice and mostly level until it dropped into some farm fields next to a river, Road walking past a high school, then back up into the woods again. Eventually it turned into another river walk before the hydroelectric dam and I ran into an outspoken man hiking with his dog who said he wouldn't take up my time but probably ended up talking forn30 minutes anyway about the worlds problems. He recommended Information Clearing House as a news source which I'll check out once I'm back.I reached the transformer station where the guidebook says is water, shower, and tenting except there were signs everywhere saying tenting wasn't allowed. I found this very frustrating and wish the ATC guidebook had been more specific about where the tenting sites were. I had already hiked farther than I should have (18 miles) and really wanted to stay, but there was nowhere I could see where tenting was allowed. I figured I had to go to the shelter so I made another mistake and read the water source was .5 away from the shelter and decided to load up 3 liters to carry up the mountain with me so I wouldn't have to add the extra .5 later.The hydroelectric dam was impressive with all the water coming down!The hike up o the shelter felt good considering how far I'd gone. I guess I was nice and warmed up today because I covered the 3 miles easily enough. The problem came when I got to the side trail for the shelter. Turns out I read the guidebook wrong and it was .5 West to the shelter, not .5 to W (or water as the guidebook uses). There was nothing for it. What's worse is I lost almost all the elevation I had just gained on a VERY STEEP, VERY ROCKY climb down. With all the extra running around I figure I am closer to 23 miles today.I got into camp with enough time to cook and setup before sundown. There's a southbounder here and Buckeye came in just before dark. It's now past 10 and I can't wait any longer to sleep. I hope I can move in the morning.I have 7 miles planned tomorrow and a resupply in town. I'm going to take it easy and spend another day in the beautiful state.

I woke up at 9 and didn't get on the trail till 9:45. I couldn't believe how fast I got into town though! I wasn't sore from yesterday and I warmed up my legs pretty fast. I covered the 4 miles in just over an hour. It was good timing. The rain started coming down hard just as I got to the road.
Nice people in Salisbury! I got a quick hitch in (just enough time to put on my rain jacket) and was dropped off right in front of the grocery store. Really nice selection! I shouldn't have gone in so hungry, but I came out with the right amount of food plus an apple and banana.
I didn't even have time to finish the apple before I was picked up again heading to Lakeville where a nice sandwich shop was recommended by the staff at the grocery store.
It was a great find. It's call 'On the Run' and it's a coffee/sandwich family owned deli that is clearly the local meeting place. 
I got a corned beef sandwich with chips and a hot chocolate for lunch then set about charging my camera, nook, and phone. I ordered some inserts, permethrin, and socks from REI (anniversary sale happening now!) and planned out the rest of Massachusetts into Vermont. 
I watched the rain and made some phone calls throughout the afternoon. Locals came in and out and all seemed to know each other and meet at regular times. The staff was kind and didn't give me a hard time for crashing their place all afternoon. A man offered to take me to the trail early on and I politely declined. I ordered another sandwich around 3 (liverwurst and cheese) and then packed up everything to hit the trail. 
The rain had stopped and the first car pulled over as soon as I stuck out my thumb. Turns out his niece is thru hiking this year and is down in Damascus for trail days. It was good to talk with him about the community on the trail and some of his stories from his 500 mile section hike in the 70s.
The sun came out as soon as I started hiking. It was a pretty even climb up and there were Gatorades at the base of the mountain! The view from Lions head was impressive but the clouds of knats were very thick on the rocks. I was able to brave it long enough to snap a picture, get a video, then hustle out of there to clean the 20 flys off me that started to bite.
The shelter was a festive event tonight. Truly wonderful people are here and I think we make a bakers dozen. Everyone is kind, talkative, attentive, intelligent, and respectful. We shared stories, dinner, stretches, and even touched on solving a few world problems (but thankfully not too many). There's a 19 year old from Princeton who was very pleasant to talk with and asked great questions concerning the hike and also my future as a teacher. There are two thru hikers from 2017 here along with a February starter. One guy is from Leadville, CO and the rest are from the New England area.
We're having a group yoga class in the morning along with sunrise pictures taken by a professional photographer. This shelter has an incredible view and I'm very glad to have chosen it this evening. I'm very much looking forward to more company as the weather gets nicer and schools get out.
I had a space ice cream sandwich tonight for dessert. I love section hikers.

I was professionally photographed by Cricket and will have some great shots of the sunrise sent to me once they get back home.
Uncle Gramps and I left camp at the same time and I caught up with him multiple times throughout the day. I stopped in the privy at the next shelter and Buckeye met me with some section hikers and more trail magic.
I crossed the CT/MA state line, summited Bear Mountain, Mt. Race (with awesome views off the ledges), and Mt. Everrit. I forded Sages Ravine (poorly) and got my shoes soaked. I've started to love/hate Massachusetts already for making me go down Jug End with all its steep rocks and insane elevation drop.
I met SO MANY section hikers today! It was mid 60s on a Saturday with a slight breeze and clear skies. Absolutely perfect hiking weather and amazing views from 2000 feet.
Ran into a table of trail magic setup with an excellent fruit salad (raspberries, blueberries, watermelon, strawberries, grapes) and bags of carrots and celery. There were cold sodas and. French onion dip along with cool whip for the fruit. Potatoe chips and bacon rounded out the offering. Love this community!
I hiked the rest of the trail with Uncle Gramps after the trail magic. I wasn't expecting to see him there because he had another 6 to go past the town but I guess he got talking. We managed to get wet again mucking through farmers fields, only this time it smelled like manure and the mud stayed on. Why is it always the lowest, wettest, muddiest corner? I know why, but why? 
Made a great pace to the road crossing and got there around 6. Got a hitch in a mustang convertible by a really great local who didn't care I smelled and had muddy shoes. Great Barrington is a very cool town. Great local scene of restaurants, music, and outdoors. Little shops on one end and affordable chain stores on the other.  
I made it to the store to resupply (4 days, yikes!), grabbed Chinese food, and am now camped out back of a recreation center on a tent platform under the open sky. It really shouldn't rain tonight. It'll be ugly if it does. I have no way to setup my tent on a platform so here's hoping the weather forecast is right!
As long as I don't have a critter eating my food in the morning I should be able to get up later, use the showers (AND SAUNA!) at the rec center, pack up my resupply, and grab another camera sd card from the pharmacy on the way out of town. I can mosey the rest of the 6.4 to the shelter and have an easy, relaxing day. Solid plans.
More weather like this and I might do this hiking thing full time.","Riga Shelter

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613959,"My risk of not setting up the tent worked last night.  The rain started as I packed my bag.  
The pavilion was nice cover as I packed up my resupply.  Nope (Treebeard 2011) was sharing the cover and we got to talk about some of the trail ahead as well as the Colorado trail.  He's from Longmont, CO. Great source of information.  He's a triple crowner and plans to yoyo the CO Trail in 30 days after this. He's retired and does this year round now.
I washed up at the Rec Center then hitched from Rite Aid to Staples and hung out at a coffee shop in between (with lackluster hot chocolate). None of them had a memory card for my camera so I hitched back to the trail by 11:30.
The day got hot and humid. It was a bit of a climb up East Mtn. and water is becoming important again.  
The insoles I picked up in Kent aren't cutting it for arch support so I'll be happy to get to Dalton Thursday morning for my REI order and mail drop which should be there Wednesday.
So in the meantime I'm taking it easy with the miles heading into Dalton. With the full pack today I took an easy morning in town and made it to the first shelter. Tomorrow I'll go for a shorter six and hopefully get some laundry done and relax again. Tuesday I'm staying at a shelter with free breakfast(!!!) and hitting 18 on Wednesday with a lighter pack for an easy approach to Dalton Thursday morning. 
I'll be finishing two weeks early at this pace and I'm looking forward to seeing what can happen once I get my gear strait and my legs stronger.
I got to the shelter around 3 and had a long afternoon. The water source is really far downhill, but it's nice and cold. 
I dried out my gear, relaxed, and made dinner. I swept out the shelter and setup my bunk. This place is cozy.

I tested the bug net out today while hiking and it did the trick! Im looking forward to getting the UV arm protectors in my Dalton maildrop.  The bugs are getting more persistent.
I was able to watch two beavers in the pond today. Massachusetts is proving to be more rugged a landscape with steeper climbs and descents, and it's more remote as a result. 
 It's nice to have some time alone. I haven't run into anyone since yesterday afternoon and it's been relaxing to go my own pace.

Last night was drafty and cold.  I didn't sleep well and took till after 8 to get out of camp. 
The miles were pretty easy without too much to see along the way. The weather was 60 with strong winds all day (and last night) which kept the bugs down. 
I ran into 4 day hikers today. Nothing more than a passing hello and a strange woman who's first question was 'are you going to hurt me'. No I'm not, and that's not a great conversation starter. 
There were two ponds late in the day, one of which I'm staying next to tonight. Upper Goose Pond Cabin is amazing!  It's too bad it's 0.5 off the trail, but I'm so glad I'm here!  It's a two story cabin complete with bunks, mattresses, rocking chairs, windows, a wash station, and breakfast in the morning!  It's on a beautiful pond and if I had more energy I could be out there now paddling around in a canoe.

It was a flat rolling section which was great except for the lack of views and features. We ended up turning the wrong way out of one of the side view trails and going 0.7 back down the mountain before realizing the mistake. We added 1.4 miles to the day plus the 0.7 side trails to the shelter. I realize my mileage has been incorrect. I've been basing it off the distance between shelters but I realized yesterday they're counting the side trail miles and it's not the true AT mileage. I'm going to make an adjustment tomorrow so my mileage counter stays accurate to the trail.We got in about two hours before sunset which is late for me.

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614351,"Got a later start today but made it to town by 9. 
The trail goes right through Dalton and I've been very much looking forward to getting here! 
I went strait to the post office and picked up my mail drop, REI order, and guidebook pages for Vermont and New Hampshire. I couldn't wait to use the Superfeer Trailblazer inserts so I opened up everything in front of the post office and restocked there. The break in period with these insoles is going to be a little rough, but it's better than nothing. 
I got UV arm sleeves in this drop which I think I'm going to like. They seem to keep my arms cooler and will also help with keeping them out of the sun. They match my shirt too!
I got another pair of darn tuff ultra lightweight socks along with a bottle of permethrin and cleaning solution to reseal my rain gear. 
After trying to hitch, I got the bus to Walmart and picked up an external battery for my phone. I've been thinking it over and it seems like the best way to cut weight. This way I can use my phone as a guidebook, camera, and book reader instead of carrying my Nook, camera, camera charger, and guidebook. 
I did laundry most of the afternoon. Two cycles for my raingear and one for my clothes. Then I dosed everything in permethrin including my pack. There have been ticks everywhere the last few days! So far I've caught them all before they had a chance to bite.
I got a hot shower at the rec center then Tom picked me up and got me down to the post office again.
I also sent home my camp shoes (will be getting crocs) because they weren't going to work for the stream crossings up ahead. They were a bit heavy and made of cloth that didn't dry well. 
I also sent back my stove. A lot of guys going lightweight do this and I had done it back in 2011 once it warmed up. What I'm doing differently is using the cold soak method to still eat the meals I planned from home (like rice sides and mac and cheese). I got a watertight protein shaker bottle at Walmart and will use this to soak my dinner during the afternoon so it's ready when I get to camp. I sent home my nalgene because I don't need two bottles plus my camelpack.
So here I am going lightweight again. I think my feet will thank me and the only thing I really gave up was having one hit meal a day (I don't cook any other time). I'm going to get Guthooks for the last two sections of the trail, but I'll still have the guidebook pages with the mileage as backup if something goes wrong with the phone. The hip pocket on my backpack won't fit my phone anyways so I think I'll still have to keep it out of site in my pack for most of the day. May have some better pictures to post here now that they won't be on my camera. I figure I saved about 2-3 pounds with this change in gear.
I'm staying at Tom Levardi's place tonight. He closed the porch in with tarps and I get a nice dry spot without needing to setup my tent (they're calling for heavy rain around 8). He's great for conversation and I have everything I need here. 
Heading up the street to dinner. Glad to be showered with clean laundry again! Tomorrow looks like great weather and I'll be trying the new pack weight out with 3 days of food (I'll confirm new weight on scale at some point). Some big climbs coming up!

I downloaded Guthooks guide using the wifi from Panera next door.  Very cool. 
After eating another donut, I finally left Tom's place by 10:30.
My pack feels great! I am thrilled with how light it is. Also, my UV arm sleeves work in cooling and warming and kept the bugs from biting my elbows!
I ran into a few section hikers today! Two ladies unloaded some extra food on me. They're here at the shelter tonight! One wants to thru hike next year and is out practicing.
I was supposed to stop at Cheshire, but instead I decided to get over half the climb done up Greylock and add another 4.5 miles. 
I did stop at the Shell gas station and eat two sausage, egg, and cheese sandwiches along with a quart of chocolate milk and a container of banana chips. It helped immensely with the climb and I will definitely be drinking more chocolate milk from now on.

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614670,"Had a great start in the morning! Two nice section hikers (who gave me food) stayed at the same shelter and were very chatty in the morning.  
Evolution (from the Netherlands) and I made it to the summit of Greylock about the same time.  I had a hot chocolate and cookies at the lodge up there before checking out the tower (which was open because of the weekend!). Great views of where we've been and where we're heading.  The Green Mountain range looks a lot bigger than what we've been climbing! 
It was a busy day on the trail with the holiday weekend.  One thing that stands out was a pair of section hikers who were tripping over their words in excitement of meeting a 'celebrity' hiking the AT. I'm not used to that kind of attention, especially as a hiker. I was more used to the term 'hiker trash' than anything approaching fame in 2011, but it seems a new wave of hikers are getting into the activity by watching YouTube streamers who have become 'famous' in the hiking community.  People will follow these high profile hikers and try to get in on the fame by leaving trail magic or giving them rides into town.  It's very different than 2011. While I get the idea behind watching videos to learn, it still made me laugh out loud thinking about watching someone hike. 
I was called a celebrity three times in the past two days and posed for 2 pictures. I don't mind being friendly, but it's just walking and a lot of free time. I'm not out here because I have answers. That's what I'm trying to find.
After the fan girls it turned into a pretty hot day. I must have underestimated my hydration because by the afternoon I had a bad headache and NO energy. 
I was supposed to push onto the shelter 5 miles farther, but I got to the campsite and couldn't move any farther. I didn't have the energy to setup camp and had to take a two hour nap on the tent platform before I could move around again. 
It was a good thing I did get up to setup the tent because it rained off and on in the night. No one else was in the campsite and the night was restful. There was an artesian spring that helped with my hydration, but dinner was still hard to get down.
Definitely my worst day energy wise on the trail. I'm hoping it was dehydration but I couldn't help thinking it could be a more sinister illness. Way too much time in camp to think about it.

I lost track of how many people I passed throughout the day, but I think the number was close to 25.I kept up on my water intake and didn't experience the same fatigue as the day before. I'm pretty sure it was dehydration that hit me.I crossed into Vermont in the morning with quite the party at the state line.

Add in a lot of elevation and you get the picture.Just before the shelter there was a nice beaver pond (pictured) and a strong stream just after that felt fantastic to jump in. I wore my shoes in because I had stepped in the mud up past my shins earlier and wanted to get the dirt off. Not sure how exactly it had happened, but I ran out of rocks to step on and ended up in a deep pool that looked convincingly solid till I was in it (then took another three steps to catch my balance). The water was cold but it felt SO GOOD! Instant refresher and decent shower/laundry.I came into camp soaking wet but had managed to beat (some) of the traffic. I found a tent site next to the shelter and setup. I snacked for awhile then hung a line and changed into my dry clothes. The black flies are out in force now (we call them knats). I put on long pants, sleeves, and wore my bugnet pretty much the whole evening.I'm not sure what the final count was in camp. I want to say 30 or more. There's a bubble of thru hikers that formed a tramily around 10 strong and that added on top of the holiday on top of the long trail starters. It was a weird night in camp with newbie long trail hikers next to trail worn Georgia starters next to first timers out for the weekend. Honestly, I'm looking forward to putting some distance between me and these people and plan to take a short day tomorow into Bennington and then out to the first shelter.

It was a nice gradual uphill climb all morning. The cold air kept me from getting overheated and the sprinkling of rain wasn't too bad. I didn't take any breaks all morning and made the 8.5 miles to my lunch shelter by 11:30.
Skid Mark (21 yr section hiker) was there first and we were quickly packed in as the other hikers from the shleter joined us. 
The weather picked up over lunch. Heavy rain and wind along with temps in the high 30's.
I was thankful for the cup of coffee from Skid Mark which was warming as well as a shot of energy. That was my first coffee in a month and the caffeine rush was real. 
I left the comfort of the shelter, this time with my rain jacket, and more ran than hiked the 4 miles to this shelter to stay warm. 
I was first in and grabbed water before getting the shelter secure.  Skid Mark helped me hang my tent across the opening to cut down on some of the wind blowing the rain directly into the shelter. After that was up I got into my dry clothes and setup my bunk. 
It was really cold.  As each group got to the shelter the process of dry clothes and warm sleeping bag was repeated by all.

Killington is a 3000 ft ascent up another ski slope (like Bromely). It had a few harder ups and really fun tree root ledges at the higher elevation running across the side of the mountain. 
I felt like I was running over the trail instead of on it at times.  There's still plenty of rain water and runoff streams flooding sections of the trail.  I've been tiptoeing across rocks the past week trying to keep my feet dry with mixed results, but my legs are noticeably stronger on the elevation.
I took lunch on top of Killington climb at the shelter.  Very friendly chipmunk lives there. I decided not to do the .2 side trail up to the summit because the rain started as I was eating. 
I actually stayed pretty dry on the way down.  The rain was lightly scattered and made the descent enjoyably cool.  It also got rid of the bugs!

My hitch to Yellow Deli was perfect. I was out for maybe two minutes before a great ride came and took me all the way. She was a traveler herself and really enjoys the Yellow Deli.
I was given a Maté when I walked in along with a little basket on my bed with soap, an energy bar, and tea.  I got the longest shower ever. It was wonderful.  So great I'm taking another one before I leave. I borrowed some loaner clothes and did laundry along with fluffing my sleeping bag and jacket. 
I went for chinese food, then resupplied at Walmart (notice how I ate before shopping), and still paid way too much for a simple 3 days of food.  There was a barber shop across the street and I paid $12 for a cut, beard trim, AND straight razor shave! With the loaner clothes I looked like a normal person (except for the crocs and baggy shirt). All this was within a half block of the hostel.  
The college group from the LT was here when I got back. It really was good to see them again before the trail split.  We had dinner together and had a good time with Reddy (country traveler) who was also at the hostel.  Ash from the 12 Tribes came to hang out with us for awhile and I got to talk with him a bit about the group (more on that later). I ate home cooked fish chowder from one of the members with smoked herring in it. Really hit the spot! 
Ordered replacement Altras from REI because mine tore out on the inside of the shoe in less than 30 days.  Im hoping it falls under warranty but we'll see.  If they don't replace them I'll have paid $120 for a pair of shoes that got me just over 200 miles. 
Also had to file a claim with the darntuff socks I just got. I'll be sending those off once I get my thicker pair back for the Whites.
There's construction happening as the hostel is expanding to accommodate more people. As a result their work crew was hammering past 11pm last night until I went out to explain we hikers try to sleep during those hours.  Thankfully they understood (or at least stopped hammering).

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615508,"Today went by too quickly. 
I went down to breakfast at 7:30 with Cam, Emma, John, and Devon. Eggs with onions and peppers,  spiced rice, banana bread, really good toast, apple cider, and coffee bar with Matés. 
I talked with Jeramiah for awhile from the Twelve Tribes then said goodbye to the college group.  They're off to finish the Long Trail then get into their summer jobs! 
I had another two (or three) matés sitting at the counter talking with Cephus (Kpha?). He was very interested in Roger Williams who founded Rhode Island and had a lot to do with early separation of church and state.  His religious views are some of what the Twelve Tribes believe. 
So I've only had a two hour crash course in their beliefs but here goes...
The Twelve Tribes take their name from the Twelve Tribes of Israel or the twelve sons of Jacob. They follow old and new testament holidays and use the Hebrew pronunciation of their names (which are also biblical). They believe Christ is the son of God and call themselves disciples of Christ but do not want to be called Christians. 
They have no possessions.  All is given when they sign up and all is shared in the community.  They have a block of housing with shared lawns.  They have meals together and share the work of running the deli and hostel here along with around 30 locations worldwide (most in the US). 
They are very well read in the Bible.  Very straightforward understanding and application of what I believe to be the message Christ taught.  Giving up of possessions and/or sharing, working together, and loving without boundaries. They are a good community of people. 
 They homeschool to protect their children from becoming programmed by the government. The decisions are made by a council of elders (men) with female influence (their wives) outside of the meetings and decisions. They did mention their recruitment of women has been down the last few decades. I mentioned a bit of scientific study about how men and women rely on different parts of the brain and how this correlates to how the Bible tackles the subject.  Not many people today want to enter into that marshy topic so it was refreshing to speak candidly. I do not believe women or men are greater, only that we are different and therefore possess abilities unique to our sex. 
They believe Christ will come again and Satan will be locked away for 1000 years (?) before Revelations happens and the apocalypse finally forms heaven on earth.  I put the question mark because I really didn't get the scriptural background of this and don't remember it from my studies. 
They have a few different locations. Most are either deli/hostels or farming communities.  They try to produce and consume their own products as much as possible. They have an Alaskan fishing location as well as a Sugar Bush in Vermont (maple syrup).  They do a lot of Matés and eat healthy.  The bread is made fresh (and tastes great).
I helped peel a bunch off bananas for smoothies and cut a few lemons for the drinks.  I helped make up the bunks and folded some laundry.  It's a donation/work for stay hostel but it's all freely given. 
I spent the rest of the day planning out the next two weeks.  I'll be heading into the Whites and wanted to get a good look at the guidebook to hike through with the least amount of stress possible.  I think I have a moderate enough plan not exceeding 11 miles or carrying more than 3 days of food.  I'll be joined a few days next week by my family so I'm lucky to get a good resupply on the first half of the area. It'll be a great way to ease into the Whites and also a great time to be hiking with my Dad.
I spent some time with the other hikers and Reddy. Lots of ice cream. Also more fish chowder and toast (and chex mix).
Late night again.  I need to hike tomorrow.

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615754,"I'm not exactly sure why I planned things this way.  Maybe it was just to see if I could do it. 
The rain lasted all night.  We woke up to two inches of water surrounding the campsite and had to walk through ankle deep water to get to the privy.
I didn't leave camp till 8:30. It was muddy and overcast, but the sun came out after awhile and it turned into a great day.  I almost forgot it was spring! 
The trail cut in and out of meadows and farmland, with a bunch of elevation gain and loss going across the mountains instead of in line with the range. There were some great views and plenty of wildflowers.  I saw three morel mushrooms but decided not to pick them. 
I did a total of 6,500 ft elevation gain and 6,000 ft of decent over 22 miles. It was a very long day and took a lot out of me mentally and physically.  I felt against the clock all day and had to push to make it to camp by 6:30. 
It's hard to put the mental aspect on paper.  It's only walking with a backpack, but at a certain point in the day there's nothing you can do about the pain and fatigue each step brings.  After about 4,500 ft of ascent and decent and 16 miles I hit a wall. My legs were telling my brain to stop walking and my brain was forcing my legs to keep climbing.  I used muscles I didn't know I had and hiked farther than I thought I could. Believing I could helped immensely. 
Made a call home after dinner.  Sounded and felt very tired, but I think everything is planned for this coming week.  
Took some ibuprofen and fell asleep fast.  The mosquitoes were plentiful and I covered up as best I could to avoid bites, but still managed three new bites by morning.

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615752,"Breakfast was great (again). Bob, Recon, Stephan, and I caught the 9:15 bus behind the deli back to the trail.  The twelve tribes people asked me if I wanted to stay longer, but I managed to slip out the back. 
A mile into the trail I got a love note from the college group at the AT/LT split.  I'm definitely going to miss them. 
It was a quick few miles to the shelter.  Thundering Falls was okay.  It was nice to see a handicap accessible section with such a nice water feature. 
I got to the shelter early afternoon.  It took effort to wait for dinner. I tried taking a nap but was woken by three other hikers coming in. Managed to wait till 5 for dinner then went to bed around 7. Fell asleep to rain on the shelter roof.

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615755,"I'm in New Hampshire!Early morning sun came into the shelter and I was up and gone by 7:20. The privy was an interesting octagon shape and had 360 views of the forest. Nothing too hard today, but I am still dragging from yesterday.  I noticed it the most on the uphill, like I have nothing left in the tank. I know I was moving fast today, but it felt like I was walking through jello. More farmland today and some road walking into town.  The streets in Hanover are busy because it's graduation weekend for Dartmouth. Stopped at the post office for a replacement pair of shoes and returned the old ones that wore out and tore in under a month.  Hopefully REI will replace, otherwise I'm going to switch shoe brands again.  I won't pay $120 for a pair of shoes that lasts under 250 miles!Went to the Brick and Brew pizza shop and got my free slice along with a large pizza.  I ate half and will carry the other half for dinner tonight. Still need to stop at the grocery store before heading out of town.  I'm going to try for the small shelter just out of town but might end up camped behind the ball fields.  I'm really looking forward to a shorter mileage day tomorrow.

",Velvet Rocks Shelter,"Jun 07, Fri",14.60
Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615873,I didn't get out of camp till 11:30 this morning. The mosquitoes are relentless. They don't even stop at night.  I woke up with a bite on my eyelid which was through the knit hat I was wearing pulled over my face. I wear earplugs to fall asleep just so I don't hear them buzzing. A guy named Maverick came into the shelter at 9:30 and was up past 11. We then hung around in the morning and I'm sure he didn't leave before noon. I hope he doesn't do the same thing tonight. So far New Hampshire is uneventful. Besides having to wear my bug net round the clock there's not much difference. Looking forward to seeing the Whites soon! I'm glad I planned an easy few days again.  I felt good for the second half of the day but it's still clear to me how much I overtaxed myself the past two days.  Ran into a group of section hikers from North Dakota. Looks like we have the same schedule the next 3 days so I'll be getting to know them. They're just setting up their tents and I'm in bed. I hate staying up late because I get hungry again. Today I hit my halfway point! When I started this year I had 868 miles to go and today I hit 434 miles to Katahdin! I could really go for some ice cream. Pretty sure I've killed close to 40 mosquitoes today.  Still not enough to stop them buzzing in my ear the whole time I'm writing this. At least the weather is nice! Levi,"Velvet Rocks Shelter

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615963,"New Hampshire delivers.Early morning sun came into the shelter, almost like the sunrise at Riga Shelter, except without as clear of a view. There was a nice bench and the shelter was spacious for just Maverick and I. The privy had no walls. I caught up with the group of 4 sections hikers from North Dakota but they were on a break and all facing me. I thought I had gotten turned around again and was headed south until they said they had left at sunrise (which I went back to sleep for). They were supposed to be heading for this shelter, but I still dont see them yet.New Hampshire doesn't mess around with it's elevation. If it's up, expect to be going near vertical (at increasing intervals) to get there. The first two days have been a more physical challenge and I find myself questioning why I'm doing this hike and why I'm not in shape. I guess one could answer the other, but I really have been struggling to recover since the 22 mile day. I saw a peregrine falcon at the rookery on top of Holts Ledge. Nice views up there.I waded into Grant Brook early afternoon before starting my climb up Smart's Mountain. I was planning on jumping in because it had a nice deep pool, but it was freezing cold. My legs were numb by the time I got out.Ran into FANTASTIC trail magic right before Smart's Mountain! Granite State ('16) and his wife provided an awesome welcome with V8, soda, Gatorade, cookies, sandwiches, and cheetos. Also loaded up with granola bars and M&Ms. It was so well timed for me and I ate everything they offered. I ran a little light on my food bag last resupply but now I'm back in the positive calories! I felt much better after running into them and spent an hour at the road crossing talking and eating.The climb up Smart's was uphill. It really paid off on views and I felt like the effort was well spent. I like the steeper slopes but I still need to find my pace. Everything I've tried so far leaves me out of breath.I climbed the fire tower at the top, went to the cabin (and finally took off my bug net!), grabbed water, and brought my dinner back to the fire tower to eat and call home. I've been at the top of this tower the past two hours watching the sun go down. The wind is blowing a cool breeze through the open windows and I can see for 50 miles in all directions. There aren't any bugs up here. I'm so glad I caught this on a good day. I'm very excited to see what more New Hampshire has to offer. It's beginning to feel like summer. Levi","Moose Mountain Shelter

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616054,"No one joined me last night so I hope those 4 section hikers are okay. Kinda wish they were here at the campsite now, but looks like I'll be alone again.
I slept in today. The cabin was so nice I didn't want to leave. I think I finally started out by 9am. The privy there is missing part of it's roof.
Easy downhill started the day. It was warm already but I enjoyed a few miles of moving faster than the bugs. I saw a tail-less snake. I wish I knew how to read omens. I've also seen enough moose dropping to make a moose, but still have yet to see one.
Took a morning dip in South Jacobs Brook before climbing up to Eastman Ledges and Mt. Cube which was a phenomenal section for views. I even hiked the side trail to the north summit and caught my first view of Moosilauke! I'll be hiking it Wednesday and the weather looks good!
There was a group called the Champagne Hikers up at the top. It's an outdoor hiking group for retirees who meet once a week. On Monday's they do more challenging hikes (and I have to give them a lot of credit for the climb they did). There were maybe 15 in the group and we shared the summit for a good while before they started heading down. Really can't put words to the views here. I am so thankful for these two days of perfect weather.
I caught up with the group near halfway down and kinda flip flopped with them when I stopped for water. Talked with a few from the group and ended up keeping pace the last mile or so to the road. They told me about heavy rain tonight and one offered to make some calls.  ""I'll be in a hotel tomorrow"" I said. They were getting in their cars and finding ice cream before dispersing. Any other day I would have jumped in with them, but my parents will be here tomorrow so I'll save the magic for the next hiker they meet. 
I had two miles to go to my campsite.  The trail through here is in sad shape.  Even with 3 days of sun the trail was a complete swamp. I took my time and kept my shoes looking nice for one more day. 
As I was tiptoeing through the forest what did I hear but a bear just 25 yards off the path! I wasn't sure what it was through the trees till I started talking to it. It turned around and looked at me a few seconds before walking deeper into the trees. Probably for the best. I didn't know what to say to a bear anyways.
So now I'm here at my tentsite wishing it was still a shelter (burned down in 2011) not half a mile from that bear. The bugs were an absolute cloud around me as I setup my tent. I haven't left since I got it set up. I ate dinner, got limited cell service, and keep imagining I hear a bear when it's just the chipmunks. The rain is due to start any minute. I hope I picked a dry site. 
Could really go for the cabin last night right about now. Can't win them all. Still a pretty awesome day for hiking!

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616218,"So it rained... a lot.I slept through the night wearing ear plugs but in the morning I woke up to a pond around my tent. The rain came in the tent from the bottom and my sleeping pad became a life raft.  Luckily my sleeping bag stayed dry.I should have slept in the privy.  It was big enough to sleep in, didn't smell, and was dry. I didn't know all this till morning so instead I packed up wet gear in the rain. My pack weighed an extra five pounds with all the water weight. I made a bad decision and didn't wear my arm sleeves or bandana (which means no bug net). I made the assumption the mosquitoes wouldn't be out in the downpour. I was wrong. I tried hiking faster than they could fly.  I couldn't.  Every step sideways or into mud that slowed me for a moment cost another bite. The trail was a complete swamp.  At one point I was up past my calf in mud and water. I didn't stop all morning.  I flat out hiked the whole distance without breaks or snacks. I was really pissed at the whole experience. I got to the hostel well before noon.  After a really wonderful hot shower I set about washing the mud off my stuff and getting it dry.  Some of this was with the drier and some was with the sun (which came out a few hours later).I ate snacks from the hostel and hung out with Maverick and Stephan for the afternoon. My parents arrived around 4. We made a wrong turn out of the hostel and turned around to find a bear on the road.  Five minutes and they see a bear!  It took me over a month.Halfway to the hotel we stop again.  This time it's a moose. YUP. A moose. I saw a moose and a bear within an hour of each other.  My Dad is thinking about starting a safari company. I feel like I've been doing something wrong by hiking to find wildlife.  I should have just jumped in the car. Dinner was really good! We went to Thai 9 in Lincoln. We packed our bag for the morning and organized some new gear once we got to the hotel.  The bed was wonderful.  I haven't slept that comfortable since I left. Next up,  Moosilauke!Levi","Ore Hill Campsite

The views were great! We could see for at least 50 miles. 
Stephan joined us for the day and acted as photographer for our hike. We even went out to the South peak for bonus miles and more views.
Great day for hiking! We got done around 5 and went for an awesome dinner to celebrate my birthday a little ahead of time. I had a 20 ounce steak with blue cheese and it was perfect.

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616389,"Today was hard.
We got a late start because I was trying to plan out the Whites. My Mom dropped off a mail drop at one of the visitors centers for me after she dropped us off at the trail. We started around 10.
The day was cold and windy and raining. Again, New Hampshire trail went strait up with rocks and streams coming down the mountain. It was not an easy place to start backpacking.
We made it to the top of Mt. Wolf but there was nothing to see. My raingear was soaked through and I was really cold. The wind wasn't helping.
I didn't take many pictures at all. My hands weren't working well and there wasn't mich to photograph except steep rocky trail.
Just as we got off the mountain and hit the flat stretch before the shelter the sun came out. It was very unexpected and I was thankful for the warmth. 
We were joined by Brave Heart and 6 Wheel at the shelter. They had a similarly terrible day heading south and told us about how rough the trail was we would hit tomorrow.
The shelter site was pretty and the shelter itself was spotless and well built. Looking forward to the rest of the Whites!

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616390,"Today was the hardest trail I've done to this point and my Dad did it anyways.We started around 9. I think getting out of a sleeping bag is just way harder the day after a cold, rainy, day.The trail up was rocky and full of water again. The weather was mostly overcast in the morning but the wind was calm. The trail going up was steep! There were a lot of parts where we had to use our hands to pull ourselves up or step down.Up on the top we actually caught half a view! It was unexpected and really cool to see a cloud blowing across the ridge in front of us like a wall of fog, then dissipating into a sunny view of the town below. I took a lot of pictures, but settled on the action shot of my Dad conquering the steep trail because that was definitely the highlight of these two days.It was seriously hard trail. All the other hikers I've talked with agree this has been the most difficult, technical section in the last 1,800 miles. The rocks were slick from all the rain, plus the streams coming down the middle of the trail. We crossed 3 or 4 ""rivers"" as my Dad called them by doing some careful rock hopping. Our feet stayed mostly dry.The rain was on and off in the afternoon but never turned into anything serious. We stopped in one of the AMC huts to check it out and I got free coffee cake and lasagna! Those places are awesome! Super friendly croo. I'll be trying to stay at the huts as much as possible.My Mom picked us up on the side of a very busy highway just before the state trooper ""gave us a courtesy ride"". I dropped my stuff off at the hostel and went out for chinese before saying goodbye.It was great having my parents out for the week! I wish it was an easier introduction to the hiking life, but my Dad never complained. He had a few hard falls and left some blood on the trail but enjoyed it all the same. I was so glad to have his company and we definitely had a shared experience.I'm at the hostel now staying up late getting my laundry done and catching up on posts.

Quick downhill with a stream running down the trail for the first mile.
I stopped in Galehead Hut but they didnt have any food. I had a snack and chatted with some section hikers.
Nothing to see on top of South Twin. I caught half a view going over Guyot. Ran into Stephan and hiked with him for the remainder of the day to Zealand Falls Hut. Really easy trail and I got there at 3:30. Thankfully they took me gor a work for stay early.
I hung out on the porch till after dinner. Listened to a talk by the croo memeber about how they pack gear in and what they pack out. Saw the packboard they use to carry gear and supplies up to the hut.
Pretty location! Runs off of hydroelectric.
Dinner was great! Stuffed shells with meat sauce, salad, and bread. There was a tray of zucchini bread for desert. All you can eat!
It was an okay croo. Pretty young group. I scraped out the freezer as my chore which took about an hour. Pancho and Fair Forecaster joined me in the work for stay.
The dining area was small but I was able to find a place out of the way. Thankfully the guests went to bed at 9:30. Unfortunately, the croo decided to throw a midnight party in the kitchen. Pretty sure another croo had night hiked in. They were pretty roudy and woke us up.
We were woken again at 5 and had to pack up and get out of the dining area. I got about 4 hours of sleep. I decided to hike out with Fair Forecaster instead of waiting till 9 for breakfast scraps.

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616775,"Long day!
I yogied an excellent dinner of steak, rice, and peas with chocolate cake from Mizpah Hut last night in exchange for dishes. Went to bed with a full belly!
Slept well. Woke up at 5am and got an early start on the day.
Took the blue blaze summit to Eisenhower which was totally worth the 360 veiws! The trail was empty except for Fair Forecaster and myself which was a nice perk of starting before breakfast was served at the huts. We didn't run into anyone until we hit Lake of the Clouds Hut below the summit of Washington. Got a sausage patty from breakfast scrapes at the hut!
The weather was overcast, but there was no wind! Temps were around 40 degrees but was comfortable hiking in shorts and a tshirt. Clouds were coming in and out over the summit of Wahington and it was a bit foggy when we got to the top.
Got our picture at the summit before it got crazy busy with the cog rail visitors coming up (they formed a long line). It was chilly after sweating during the climb so we went in the visitors center. We got there around 10am and I had a coke and ice cream bar while we waited for the hot food bar to open. 
The clouds cleared up a bit and we ran outside to get pictures. Very happy with my summit day weather!! 
Came inside and ate 2 hot dogs with a bowl of chilli. We stayed at the center around 2 hours before starting the hike down to Madison Hut.
Really rocky ridge all day. We rock hopped for at least 10 miles today. It was mentally draining having to focus on the trail and where to step for such a long time. We took plenty of breaks for pictures. Ran into some guys skiing the snow leftover in the notches. Looked like a lot of work to climb back out with all the ski gear.
Was pretty exhausted getting into Madison. We didn't take a break between Washington and there (5.7 of rocks) and I was tired. We debated waiting outside and doing a work for stay, but we would have been sitting on the trail for two hours before they'd accept us. Decided to push ahead to the campsite and just went in for a snack and water.
Getting out from Madison was tough. There was a half mile strait up to the summit and then 3 miles strait down to the campsite (all rocks till treeline). Once we hit treeline we started running into downed trees. Clearly the AMC doesn't care about this section of trail and no one had been out this year to maintain it. I find this frustrating because the amount of money thru hikers bring in is not insignificant (I'm up to 150+ dollars at this point).  We also ran into a very upset family who took the VERY hard trail up to the hut. There are at least 30 tree down between Pinkham Notch and Madison Mt. White blazes are missing from Osgood Tentsite to Mt Washington auto road (almost 3 miles) and the trail has 3 intersections with other paths. This is pathetic maintenance and I feel no care is given to the AT or it's hikers. Just because it's the hardest trail going to Madison doesn't mean you can just ignore it. There is major erosion happening because of traffic being routed off the trail and it will only be getting worse as more AT hikers get here. I lodged a complaint with the AMC and I hope they see it as a higher priority.
All that said it was a fun day. The sun came out for our trip over Madison and we got some great shots looking back at the Presidential Ridgeline. The 6000 ft of decent was a bit much for my legs and feet but clearly I survived. 
Almost through the Whites and the weather has been kind!

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616806,"Wow I'm tired. 
Today ended up being clear. There were more trees down on the way to Pinkham Visitors center but the trail smoothed out for an easy 5 miles. Got there around 11 and had some chilli and soda. Charged my devices, got new socks, and replaced my pack cover. I accidentally left my other one hanging at Zealand Hut. I'm upset I left behind a piece of gear, but it was 8 years old and didn't owe me anything.
Ate an awesome sandwich for lunch. Roast beef on fresh bread with horseradish, olives, mayo, lettuce, and tomatoes. Hung out with Fair Forecaster for about 2 hours there.
The climb up Wildcat was tough! I was tired from yesterday and had nothing left to give.  It took me a long time to get to the Hut. The sun stayed out for the whole day despite the report of rain.  Could have used the shower, but it's hard to complain with the weather I've caught through here. 
Got a work for stay! Eating a delicious dinner of fresh salad, veggie chilli, bowtie pasta, green beans, peas, pulled pork, and carrot cake with icing. I'm so happy to be inside and eating this food!!
Looks like rain tonight and tomorrow. At least I'll start dry.
I learned Wagon Hammer and Orange Blaze are just a day ahead! Last time I saw them was my last day in New York.
Going to sleep hard tonight. Going a short 7 tomorrow and then Im out of the Whites by Friday!
Planning to take two weeks off because Im ahead of schedule and I had a trip planned to Canada over 4th of July week. I'll be getting on a bus Saturday and spending a few days at the beach with the family before heading to Canada.

Didn't get much sleep.  My legs were so sore I couldn't get comfortable and the Hut was hot. A heavy fog rolled in after dinner and I could see white mist coming in through the open windows. 
Woke up at 5 and hung around outside while breakfast was being served.  I heard a fanatic morning skit by the Hut croo about wilderness first aid and later congratulated them on the performance over breakfast.  Eggs, sausage, oatmeal with toppings, coffee, and a blueberry coconut coffee cake that was devine.
Got started hiking around 9. Putting on my wet, sweat soaked clothes from the day before was harsh. I really need a shower.
The climb out of Carter was tough but short. Once on the ridge it wasn't so bad,  but it was still over 2500ft gain and loss for the day. Couldn't see anything through the fog. The trail was very bushy and narrow making it impossible to hike without getting hit with branches.
We got into Imp around 12:30 just before the really heavy rain started. I slept the afternoon away to the sound of rain on the roof and only woke up when it stopped around 5:30. Fair Caster said it was about an inch and a quarter of rainfall. Based on the lake around the shelter I believed him.
Hung out with Tiger, the eastern traveling caretaker who was watching over Imp this week. He was a 2017 thru hiker and his buddy was visiting from home. We went back and forth with trail stories and how the AMC handles trail maintenance and hownto encourage more hikers to stay at designated shelters through the Whites instead of stealthing illegally. It was a tough nut to crack. Some hikers just aren't willing to pay to shelter when up to this point it's been free. While some understand the cost of maintaning the heavily trafficed section, others aren't as economically minded.
I stayed talking with them till dark (which is now past 9). Went back to the shelter and ate dinner before trying to sleep. Again, couldn't sleep because of how sore my legs (and knees) are.
By chance I was reminded tomorrow is the Solstice. So glad I didn't miss it!

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617047,"It's the longest day of the year and the perfect time to let it all hang out. Happy Hike Naked Day!!After careful planning with Fair Caster he left the shelter first. I got going around 8 and started hiking in a light rain. The trail was swampy and I went back to slogging strait through the mud instead of trying to dodge it.No views today or yesterday, just dense white fog. At the summit of Mt. Moriah I donned my outfit for the occasion. Probably a good day for it as my clothes were already soaked anyways.Pretty steep downhill rocks. The pine trees were over the trail and I got a very cold, pine-fresh exfoliating shower treatment on my way down. This place could really use some attention.Steady rain until I hit Rattlesnake stream. Then the mosquitoes happened... Not the best place to be hiking on the Soltice. I ran (not jogged) the last 4 miles. It still wasn't enough. When it came time to get decent again (about a half mile from the road) I had to set my pack on the trail and make running laps back and forth while dressing to avoid the swarm.Ten bites later I made it to the hostel. Took my second shower of the day, but this one was warm and had soap. They took my clothes and had a fine selection of loaner clothes including a few onesies. I settled for the pajama pants.Really great environment for relaxing. They had a few past thru hikers helping with the hostel and we had everything a hiker could need. I made lunch from odds and ends left in the fridge and started watching The Dark Crystal on Netflix (this is a kids movie?!).Took the 2pm free shuttle to Walmart and stocked up on snacks for my journey tomorrow and grabbed a frozen pizza for dinner. Almost left Fair Caster behind but we figured it out before leaving the parking lot.Chatted with the other guests through the afternoon. Met Bill who hiked with Fair Caster back in Tennessee and traded some gear reviews and talked about other trails in the Wisconsin/Minnesota area (Ice Age Trail). Ran into a family of 3 trying to finish up the last section of there AT hike but were down for a knee injury 2 days into their journey. Starting in the Whites has to be a rough place to get your trail legs.Made the pizza and helped myself to a few of the leftover beers in the fridge. Watched the end of The Dark Crystal and got to bed around 9. Stephan joined the party later and I'm glad I got the chance to say goodbye before leaving on my vacation. We'll reconnect after the hike to trade pictures and stories.Long travel day tomorrow. Hard to believe I walked this far North the past two months!Levi","Imp Shelter

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617050,"Travel Day!
I decided because I'm so far ahead of schedule, and I've had a trip to Canada planned for next week, that it would be more fun and cost effective to travel home and go to the beach with family, rest up, upgrade my gear and plan, and head to Canada from PA rather than try coordinating transportation out of Maine next week. Very excited for my vacation from my vacation!
Got a late start with the shuttle. Grabbed breakfast at the gas station and talked with another hiker heading south to walk some easier sections. He's on his 4th round of completing the AT and decided to enjoy himself rather than wrestle with the NH/ME terrain.
Nice sunny weather today! The bus ride was fine heading to Boston. I tried sleeping then amused myself watching Seinfeld on the tvs (without sound).
Had an hour layover in Boston. I aired out my shoes (which are still wet) and watched the busy streets near South Station. Lots of culture in the city!
Got on the train heading to Philly at 1:30 and I'll be riding it till 7:30 then transfer to my last leg going into Harrisburg. It'll be a 16.5 hour travel day for me when I'm through.  Figured this was the right time to update my entries and take a little more time in writing down my experience.
I ordered some new gear for my last 300 miles! By going home I have a chance to organize my new stuff before coming back. My pack has been on my list of needed upgrades pretty much since 2011. Right now I have the Deuter ACT lite 65 +10L pack that's complete overkill for how much I'm carrying. As a reference my full pack weighed 27 lbs coming out of the Notch Hostel with 3 days food. 4lbs 10oz of that was just the pack! I decided on the Osprey Levity 45L pack that weighs 1lb 10oz. That's 3lbs difference!!!! Also, I've been wanting an Osprey pack because of the suspended back design and lifetime guarantee. My Deuter pack soaked up so much sweat on hard climbing days and probably took on another pound or two with all the moisture. I'm hoping this takes care of it!
I also decided to go with the Sawyer Squeeze system and ditch my camelpack and aquamira drops. It wasn't around in 2011 but now it seems like the standard. I'll carry two smartwater bottles instead of my coldsoak shaker bottle and camelpack. This will be a much more reliable way to ensure my drinking water is clean (though I still haven't had an issue drinking 95% of the water sources unfiltered up till now. For the record I do NOT recommend this to others).
Got an Eagle Creek XS bag to go on the hip belt of the new pack that can fit my phone and snacks, and the color matches perfectly. 
I rounded out the order with a smaller pack cover designed for the 45L pack size.
Now I have the option of a winter or summer backpack. The new pack only carries 30lbs or under while my Deuter carries 45+lbs with ease. For a thru hike (or LASH) the lighter pack is definitely going to be my first choice. Three whole pounds!!
Can't wait to get my stuff loaded into it later this week. I'll give it a good test run while I'm in Canada at Bruce Pennisula!
So that's it for me till July 8th! I might throw in a few more posts as time allows over the next two weeks. There are some grander ideas I've been working on as my hike progresses and I hope to have the opportunity to share them with all of you! Mostly I'd like to better capture the AT experience on a macro level and give insight into my successes and failures as I continue to learn and grow on this journey.
I hope I can help encourage anyone on the fence to take the leap as I did and get out there to experience more of what this great world and it's people have to offer! It really is a beautiful time to be living.

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617053,"One question I hear constantly on this hike (especially now that I'm in my 30s) is how I found time to take months off from 'life' and have the freedom to attempt something like this. The answer is because I choose to.
If quitting your job, selling your house, and saying goodbye to everything and everyone familiar sounds scary it's because it is. It's not the safe thing nor the easy way, but perhaps that what makes it so enriching. While security is a useful and neccessary part of survival, it's walls can be a prison instead of a fortress. One is made to keep others out while the other is made to keep you in.
I'm not here to say slashing and burning the life you've created is what leads to happiness, but I will say a change of routine reveals a surprising perspective that breathes new life into a world that feels like a prison sentence.
I once had an assignment living in a community house to write down how I spent a week of my time. While a large portion of that time was taken by sleep and work, I found an equal share was under my control (almost 8 hours a day!). What was interesting about this assignment was my desire to improve upon and outdo myself as the week progressed. Instead of 4 hours playing a computer game (or social media) I decided to call up a friend and plan a coffee date. I started using my calendar and trying to fill in the days with socializing, or planning a few hours just for me. Instead of filling in 15 min here or an hour there I planned and carved out hours of time in advance (usually using Sunday as the day I'd make contacts and plan the week).
There are plenty of TED talks about this sort of living, but I guess the comparison I'm trying to make here is that it took deliberate planning to break the routine. 
I didn't wake up one day and walk out my door with a pack on (though I'm positive others have). I planned my life around this trip. I never married. I never had kids. I kept my possesions to a minimum so moving was easier. I became a jack of all trades (and master of none) so I knew I could always find employment. I setup my life to be how I wanted to live it instead of letting others dictate how life should be lived. I guess that makes me proud to be a millenial.
We live in an incredible time in history where almost anything is possible. I could be in Asia tomorrow. I can learn to play guitar RIGHT NOW sitting on this train. I can connect with billions of people with the device in front of me. I can brainstorm and create the next greatest whatever and make a bunch of money.  These freedoms which we take for granted have never before been available to people of our class (unless there's some monarch reading this post). What may help us realize these freedoms is a near future where they may no longer be available. Do you how expensive emissions for vacation flights might become? How about how harmful the new 5G network is for humans? Wonder what will get axed when Net Nuetrality fails to be recovered?
We can get anything, anytime, anywhere. Making snap judgements in the moment provides a 'fast food' delivery full of hollow satisfaction. Why not take charge of this moment in time and plan to do something with it instead of waiting till you're wasting it?
Get a list together. Make it appropriate to the time and lifestyle you have (or want). It's AMAZING the access we have to information to educate ourselves for something new. All of us can find one hour, or one week, or one day to experience something outside of ourselves and better come in touch with the world at large. If people aren't your thing maybe try nature? I've found those people give me more (rather than less) faith in humanity.
Make your life one that you choose. If all of us were more satisfied with this (like those I've found enjoying the outdoors, or music, or learning, or ANYTHING) we'd all be more satisfied with what we perceive the world to be, like a feedback loop instead of a black hole. Maybe then we will remember what we have in common instead of that which keeps us apart.

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618244,"My vacation from my vacation is coming to an end. As I sit here on another long travel day heading back to the trail I'm reminded of how very tired I am and how very worth the cost it was.
I got home after midnight from the bus station. I was greeted by the lovely lady I'm dating, Jaci, who drove me home for a few hours sleep before getting back in the car with Dan (my sister's partner) to drive 4 hours to the beach the next day. I was excited to be home in my bed for at least one good night of sleep.
Spent a relaxing few days at the beach with my family, niece, and nephew. We swam in the ocean, watched dolphins chasing bait fish, and ate some tasty seafood. On the carride back I was almost able to keep my 4 month old nephew from crying. Tough work.
The next three and a half days I spent getting my gear ready for the final push. Resealed my tent, put new tips on my trekking poles, new rain jacket, washed my bag and jacket, etc. I ended up reordering the backback and went with the large instead of a medium. Everything fits! I'm still at 27lbs even after adding back my stove and headlamp plus an additional day of food. 
Got to spend an evening at the park with family and Jaci listening to my Dad play with the Greater Harrisburg Area Concert Band and went for drinks with a friend to Midstate Distillery to check out their new patio. Saw the new chickens at the farm and made sure my niece said hi to each one before moving on. Went to my Grandmothers for a dinner and saw two of my uncles.
The other half of my vacation was spent in Canada with Jaci and three of her friends. Wow, where to start.
I'd like to take a break here and explain how I'm coming into this. I moved back from CO in November, started part time at the Distillery in January, settled in my apartment in March, met Jaci in April, and left for the trail shortly after. Not a lot of time to settle in or put down roots again.
We left for the 9 hour ride north around 7am after meeting her friends to exchange some cargo. The trip up was great until we reached the boarder. Apparently I didn't pay close enough attention to the details and Jaci was also fumbling some of the logistics to the point we were asked to pull over and get searched. I guess coming from PA with CO plates to Canada, then heading back to the US but dropping me off in NY to hike ME while Jaci returns to PA was too shakey of story. Can't say I blame them. The ride was beautiful though and we got to see Niagra Falls on a drive by tour. There was plenty for Jaci and I talk about after being away for two months and we're still getting to know each other which made the time pass quickly for me. I'm used to much longer periods of silence.
Grocery shoppong was the only stressful part of the journey. Shopping for people I didn't know well for a weeks worth of food in a country I've never visited was rough. I overbought and felt like everything cost too much (darn exchange rate). I also heard 'Sorrey' at least a dozen times. Candians are so polite!
We got to the AirB&B late and threw together a quick meal. Everyone in the group can play or sing so we formed the band Yellow Lady Slippers and rehearsed a few tracks. The stargazing that first night was the best I've seen.
Second day was Singing Sands. The Bruce Pennisula is a haven for rare plants given it's unique location on the Niagra escarpment, giving orchids in particular a limestone rich soil to thrive in. I of course knew none of this and found myself on a crash course in bontany from Jaci and her friend Rachel who really orchestrated the trip.  While I appreciated the beauty of the flowers and other plants they pointed out, I was completely out of my depth.
It was Canada Day and we celebrated by grilling then watching the fireworks next to the harbor. I was overwhelmed by this point by not being part of the friend group (and used to more silence) and I missed most of the conversation.
Next day we started at the visitors center then joined a guided tour offered by the park to Halfway Log Dump. We followed the Bruce Trail which runs from the peninsula down to Niagra Falls. It was mostly flat with some mixed rock scrambles. Our destination was three beautiful caves, the last of which was a bonus cave added onto the tour ""because we were such a good group"". The cave reminded me of a small cathedral with butresses reaching from the ceiling down to the ground. It was called bootleggers cave or something like that and I highly recommend the extra rock scrambling to get there.
Wednesday Jaci and I went the tourist route and visited the Grotto. I can't get over how clear-blue the water was! Unfortunately, this is due to the invasion of zebra muscles and another mollusk or clam species which devastated the fish in the lake and therefore removed the sediment, crashing the food chain. While it's beautiful for tourists like me, environmentalists like Jaci and Rachel see the bigger problem.
The Grotto was amazing! It's a rock cave over the water with beautiful cliffs and a steep rock shelf dropping into the lake. Jaci took some covincing, but we finally took a swim in the 54 degree water (for about 30 seconds). Got some great pics and watched some cliff jumpers before heading back to the house.
In the afternoon, Rachel and Kristi took us to a spot they found on their morning hike. The water was shallow and lined with rocks and grasses (sedges??) which helped to heat the water to a comfortable swimming temperature. We kinda pulled ourselves along using our hands and floated down the channel out into deeper waters where it quickly became too cold to swim. Jaci dried of in the hammock while I found a patch of sunlight nearby to get warm. 
Later that afternoon I really crashed. I realized I'm not as good as I thought at getting along with a new group of friends. Good lesson, but really uncomfortable to feel like the outsider ruining a great time.
The next day was better. We all booked tickets on a glass bottom boat that took us out over two wooden shipwrecks in the harbor before dropping us off at Flower Pot Island. The island got it's name from two 'flower pot' like rock towers that formed as the water eroded the stone. We walked all the trails on the island in search of wildlife and more rare plants. I was surprised at the health of the forest. It was alive with insects, snakes, birds, and a wide variety of ferns, flowers, and trees, all set into a landscape next to crystal clear waters and brick-like stone cliffs.
After the charter boat dropped us off at the dock we went for ice cream and some souvenir shopping. Back at the house after dinner Jaci, Rachel, and I took out the canoe (provided at the house) on the bay right against the property. The sky and water almost blended into one on the horizon and the quiet of the pennisula was a perfect end to the day. We lit a fire next to the water and watched the sunset while Jaci painted the scenery. The stars weren't quite as bright that evening, but we could still see the Milky Way.
Friday was another free day. Jaci and I took kayaks out around the coast and I got to spend more time enjoying the water and her company. We took lunch on a small rocky island then paddled over to a cave along the water with a skylight and a stone arch adjacent. On the way back we saw a tiny otter with a fish it had just caught.
Back at the house we cleaned up and got ready for dinner. We went to the brewery in Tobormory and I had the best burger I've ever tasted (though I usually don't spend $20 on burgers). It was a great time to reflect on our favorite parts of the trip and laugh at the awkward start to the week. I really appreciate how these ladies love and support one another and are completely rediculous all the time. It was a hard group to walk into for an entire week in a new country, but I'm very thankful to have this experience and be lead by such a knowledgable, quirky, group. We got to see so much in just a few days and it was one of most exhausting (and rewarding) trips I've taken.
After some more souvenir shopping and a necklace that fit Jaci perfectly, we came back to the house and had freshly baked apple pie for my birthday! They took turns telling me what they appreciate about me and I had a chance to reflect on the last year and what my goals are for this coming year. We rehearsed some more music for our first album. 'Hit Me Baby One More Time' was by far the best sightread we had.
Saturday morning we were on the road early. No problems at the boarder this time. We stopped at a very terrible Tim Hortons and left promptly after their leaking (and broken) AC unit tripped the fire alarm and called the fire trucks out.
After a long anticipated sing along in the car, Jaci and I spent the night in Newark, NJ before dropping me off at the train station in the morning. She left for home. Unfortunately I was at the wrong station and had to walk 8 blocks to the bus station to catch my ride.
Now I'm sitting outside South Station in Boston, MA again on the same bench I found two weeks ago. I've got a new pack and fresh gear and I'm trying to wrap my tired brain around starting out tomorrow on the final stretch of my hike. I have 8 more hours before I reach Rattle River Hostel and my plan is to get 12 miles down trail to setup for the Mahoosik Notch on Tuesday which is said to be the hardest mile of the whole AT. 
Honestly, I'm looking forward to hiking again and the moments of silence desperately needed to collect my thoughts. Next month I start classes full time after a decade of working mostly blue collar jobs. I start a new position at the distillery making sales calls and deliveries. I'm also starting out on a new relationship. I'm still fixing up my apartment on a new property that needs a lot of attention. 
I'm grateful to be busy again, but this past week showed me how ill prepared I am for new people and responsibilites. In Colorado I was in the habit of working and staying at home. I read, played computer games, and pretty much kept to myself. This move back East was a purposeful attempt to get active again and I think I am set up to achieve that goal. My one wish for this coming year is to keep all the balls rolling and not drop any. I'll most definitely fail at times but my hope is to stay true to my goals and see them through to the other side. Finishing this 8 year journey on the AT is a good way to kick it off and I look forward to sharing my continued journey with everyone here reading this. I am staggered at the amount of views my writting has produced and I thank you all for your continual support on this adventure. 
I look forward to sharing my moment of completion with you and will do my best to keep posting from now until the end.

It's hard to imagine this is the 14th state I've hiked on the trail. Maine seems to be a combination of Vermont and New Hampshire. It's strait up and down like NH, but the ponds, forests, and tree roots remind me of Vermont. Still plenty of bugs around, but not as aggressive as before. I took 7 hours to hike 10 miles with all the pictures I'm taking.

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618629,Fun day today!I got a later start again (around 9). Still resting up from my vacation.The Mahoosuc Notch was more fun than difficult. The rocks were car-sized boulders strewn in 40 yard sections over the mile stretch of the notch. After going over top of the first rock cave I decided to go through the other ones. It was fun jumping from rock to rock then scrambling under the boulders to get through. Didn't take too long and only had to take my pack off once.The Arm was a lot harder. Most of it was solid rock going about 30 degrees strait up the mountain. I'm so glad I had good weather. If the trail was wet this section would have been a lot more difficult.I've been listening to music during the last few days and I'd have to say it helps a lot. My legs keep pace with the music and I'm able to keep a better pace on the uphills. I'm using playlists I downloaded from Spotify.Ran into some well timed trail magic at Grafton Notch.

The camping is free or the hostel is a biodome. The staff at the diner have been kind. The owner runs free shuttles all day and they open up the porch of the restaurant for hikers to relax and charge phones.

I'm thinking I'm still within my goal of finishing on Aug. 3rd as long as the terrain gets easier. It's a hard time mentally for me right now. It feels like the end is very close, but it's still three weeks of hiking to get there. The terrain is frustrating and is taking a lot of time to navigate. In another week I'll be trying to draw out the hike longer, but right now the finish still seems a long way off.I feel better prepared for the end after taking today to look ahead. Since crossing into Maine it's hit home how big this trail is and how long I've spent hiking it. As fun as it all can be, I'm ready to be done.

The terrain was easier to hike. It's still rocks and roots but it was mostly downhill so I decided to push early to the hut.
I got in at 6pm while everyone was in town. One hiker stayed behind and showed me the shower and tentsite. The shower was so nice! The caretaker Steve hooked up an instant hot water heater to a shower head and put it next to the stream in a little three sided, open-air, shower with a view. My tentsite was a tarped dirt platform surrounded by gravel with another tarp for a ground cloth. I didn't bither setting up my tent.

He doesn't have electric but keeps battery powered lights charged for the separate cabins. A friend of his keeps beautiful gardens around the property and the nearby stream adds a nice sound. Great place to rest.

From the first summit you can see across to the two other peaks above treeline.Raced the northbound hikers to the shelter and got a spot. About 20 people at the shelter.  Met Buckles, Stitches.

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619124,"I was almost ready to leave the shelter, then the rain started.Not sure why, but no one wanted to hike in the rain. All the Northbound hikers stayed in the shelter while the flip floppers and Southbounders hiked out. We took naps, hung out, and had visitors all morning. By 11 the rain hadn't let up and the next shelter was looking like it was going to fill up. It took a lot of will power to put on my wet hiking clothes. I'm ready to be done hiking in the rain.The 8 miles took 5 hours to hike. I stayed ahead of the other Northbounders and got to the shelter just as the rain cleared. There was a spot left! Considering we had close to 25 camped at the site, I was glad to be one of the 7 people under a roof.I relaxed most of the afternoon. Talked with the Southbounders sharing the shelter and one of them lit a fire. I wrote a letter and enjoyed being dry.Levi","Poplar Ridge Lean to

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619135,"Slept in again.
Felt much more rested and motivated in the morning. The last week has been hard getting motivated but today I was excited to get started.
I was working to catch the 4pm shuttle to the hostel so I had to keep moving all day to get there. Lots of hikers! Must be the bubble heading south.
It was sunny and clear. Nice breeze and wasn't too hot.
The miles are still hard through here. My pace was slower than I expected and I had to jog the last 4 miles.
I ran into the 2000 mile marker today. For those that don't know, the ATC recognizes the completion of the AT by admitting you into the 2000 mile club. This is to include those who completed the trail back when it ended earlier in Maine (and before that Mt. Washington in NH). By passing the 2000 mile mark, I can now be included in this group of hikers who completed the trail. Don't worry,  I'll get the extra 292 miles completed. Either way,  it was a moment on the trail I won't forget. The end is two weeks away and the feeling of pride I have for walking 2000 miles of this trail is the confidence I need to get across the finish. 
Shuttle came at 430. I could have slowed down. Shaggy, Spice, and I got our own room with bathroom. Lots of hikers here. Buckles and Logan are here with more Southbounders. Getting tired of hearing how awesome the Southbounders are for making it less than 200 miles. They should be excited, but it's really tiring to hear all the time.
Sweet hostel! Built in 2010. Big log cabin style ski lodge. Free breakfast. Free shuttles.
Trying to average 12 miles to finish on time. Over the next two days I be through all the 4000ft mountains until Katahdin. It gets really flat. Looking forward to some longer days. Should be in Caratunk in 3 days and Monson in 6. I'll look to post again by Monson.

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619159,Had a nice breakfast and updated my journal this morning. Got the 930 shuttle back to the trailhead then hitched the opposite direction to pickup a maildrop in Stratton. Resupplied with the maildrop then went to the gas station for some chocolate milk.Easy hitch back to the trail. I think it was around 11 I got started. Got a bee sting on my ankle. Found a pretty AT symbol someone made out of birch logs.Slow and steady climb up South Horn. I stopped at Horns Pond Lean-to and went swimming in the pond with Buckles for maybe a half hour. The water was cool and clean and felt great after the first climb.Ate a snack then headed onto the last 4k climb before Katahdin. It is a beautiful section and I caught it on a party cloudy day. Rain storms were moving in and I could see two rainbows in the distance under the rain clouds. I spent a lot of time on South Horn and Bigelow West Peak taking pictures. By the time I got to the second peak a rain storm had started. I heard thunder in the distance and hiked very quickly across the ridge and back under tree cover. It made for some amazing pictures though! Today might be one of my favorite view days.Got rained on for the climb down. Had to be careful on the rocks.This tent site is really nice. Cool side trail takes you through large boulders before reaching the site. I got here after 6. Good tent platforms and pads along with two water sources and a privy. Cooked dinner and ran out of fuel just as I got the water to boil. Guess I won't get to eat my hot meals or have coffee until I hike 26 miles to Caratunk. Hopefully I'll run into someone tomorrow at the shelter who will help me out.Levi,"Hostel of Maine

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619270,"Heat wave today made for a tiring day.
The high was 91. I stopped at one of the ponds and went for a swim.
Got dehydrated during the day. Sick of drinking luke warm pond water.  Pretty flowers on the trail today.
The shelter was a busy site. Three guys from Germany. A large group of middle school girls was there and shared their leftover mac and cheese which was great! It saved me from havibg to eat cold food. I was able to boil water and make coffee for the morning because two Southbounders were cooking hot dogs.
Couldn't sleep because of the heat. Too hot for the sleeping bag but the bugs were biting. Very hot, sticky, itchy, and tired.

Levi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619271,"Had to start early today to get to the ferry in time. I woke up at 5 and started hiking by 645. 
It was nice getting miles done in the morning. I had 10 miles done by 11. 
Rain came down for awhile and cooled off the day. Lots of waterfalls coming down the mountain. 
Got to the ferry at 130. 40-4 and I were the last two hikers to cross the river today.  I helped the ferryman put away the canoe for the day. 
Stopped at the Caratunk House to resupply and drink a strawberry milkshake. The owner gave me a ride to Northern Outdoors where I split a room with Logan (Spicey Boy) and Twinkle Toes. Got a shower, watched Roadhouse, and ate dinner at the brewery here. The blueberry beer isn't that great. 
By my count I have 10 days left after Monson. I've been going a lot slower and taking more breaks throughout the day.  Every view feels like the last chance for me to soak in the scenery and the end seems very close. I am proud to be in the final days of my hike, but also sad. I'm going to miss this.

I've been hearing them often at night. The shelter was lively. Two section hikers happened to be air force pilots turned commercial pilots and knew some of the same people.

Spicy Boi and I hiked together for most of the day. Ran into a cooler of trail magic at the base of Moxie that still had ice cold soda, candy bars, and apples.
Moxie Bald was an unexpected 360 view. I stayed up there close to an hour making phone calls and enjoying one of the last good views from the mountains.
Later in the day we stopped at Moxie Bald Lean to and sat at the edge of the pond on a picnic table for over an hour. Really going to miss this scenery.
Covered the distance by 7. Had the shelter to myself, everyone else tented. I guess the bugs are bad but I'm used to covering up at night.
Some Southbounders lit a fire. I put in my earplugs and was asleep by 8.
