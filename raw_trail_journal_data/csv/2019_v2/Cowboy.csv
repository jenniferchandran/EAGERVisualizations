Cowboy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608271,"Planning and exercise preparation continue.  My fitness is ramping up which is good.  I'm filling a few holes in my gear but everything is coming together.  Logistical decisions have been made and the plan is set.  I'd originally planned to meet up with Machete (and her two daughters), Mama Bear, and Kim (aka The Gainseville Gang) in Franklin, NC on 3/28/19 and then to head out the next morning at Deep Gap.  This is the same place I got back on the trail last fall after Hurricane Michael.  Machete's research showed that access to Deep Gap is closed till 4/1 so they are going start a bit farther south on 3/28/19.  That doesn't work for me as I can't get there in time to meet them, so I'm going to start on 3/29 at Winding Stair Gap at 109.4 and head south to meet them.  I'll stay at the Long Branch Shelter on 3/29/19 and continue south on 3/30/19 meeting up with the Gainesville Gang south of Albert Mountain before turning around and heading back to the Long Branch Shelter. I'll be on new ground on Day 4 of this hike with this plan.   And planning to finish in Hot Springs, NC.  Total planned mileage is around 180 miles.",,View Entry,"Mar 17, Sun",0
Cowboy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608882,It's getting close now.  I fly out on Thursday and spend the night in Franklin NC before going on the trail on Friday morning.  I'm all packed up and ready to go.  My list of things to do before I go is getting shorter and shorter :D,,View Entry,"Mar 26, Tue",0
Cowboy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609050,"I’ve started the trip early today. My flight to Atlanta was at 7:10 so it was an early start. Thanks to Memo for getting up and being ready to leave the house before 5. The day was uneventful and I eventually arrived in Franklin NC in the middle of the afternoon. 
The package of food and fuel that I’d mailed myself was at the hotel waiting for me. I don’t seem to have forgotten anything, but definitely am starting with too much food.  I’ll do my best to eat steadily.
Everything fits in the pack but the bear canister I’m taking this time sure takes up a lot of space. And once I pack stuff around the canister it seems like my pack is ready to burst like a balloon. I’ll have to resdistribute a bit and use more space above the canister. 
The weather is lovely in Franklin, in the low 60s with clear beautiful blue skies. Weather on the trail looks good till Sunday when it turns cold and wet. There may be snow on Tuesday. 
I start at Winding Stairs Gap tomorrow morning and head south, repeating a section I did six months ago.  The Gainesville Gang got on the trail well south of me today and are heading north.  I’m planning to stay at the Long Branch Shelter tomorrow night. I recall it was a very nice shelter, but I’ll probably tent until the weather turns wet. It’s a little over 7 miles from Winding Gap so should be a relatively easy day.  The terrain will be largely uphill but not steep.  On Saturday I’ll continue south and meet up with the Gainesville Gang if all goes well and we will likely end up back at the Long Branch Shelter Saturday night.  
I’m going to sign off and acquire some dinner. There’s a Taco Bell just down the road from my hotel calling my name.",,View Entry,"Mar 28, Thu",0
Cowboy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609111,"I slept long and well in the Franklin Comfort Inn. I was up around 6, taking my last shower for a while (at least for 4 or 5 days). I was all packed and ready to go when my shuttle driver, Mike Newton, picked me up just after 8.  It was chilly, in the mid 30s.
We were at Winding Stair Gap around 8:30. I was excited, and forgot to pay Mike. I realized that after about 15 minutes of hiking (uphill of course). I didn’t have any cell signal and couldn’t reach him to later in the morning. He’d realized that he hadn’t been paid too.  I’ll make him whole when he picks me up at the end of this trip. 
I headed south, mostly uphill.  There were a lot of northbound hikers in the morning.  They were leaving from Rock Gap Shelter or Long Branch Shelter.  There were so many that I’ve forgotten most of their names.  At least 40 passed in groups, solo, and in pairs.   
The first I remember was Totter.  Sort of a forboding name for a trail with lots of places to fall, but she said that was her real and her trail name.  She looked to be in her early 60s and she was solo.  She had been doing section hikes but this year she jumped in with both feet and was doing a thru hike.
A trail name is a name, usually given by someone on the trail.  I’m still using the trail name of Cowboy, from my last section hike.
Another memorable fellow was “Chewy”, yes the same as our new GSD.  He was in his 20s and had rejected the corporate world, he’d been an insurance broker, and instead worked in the “outdoors”.  I wasn’t sure what he meant.  He’d done a thru hike two years ago when he quit his insurance job.  He was south bound like me meeting up with some friends.  He was going farther than me today and he booked it on. 
Then there was Ellie.  She had blue hair and a blue coat.  I wanted to call her Blue.  Especially when 5 minutes later I came across a girl with pink hair.  Her trail name was, wait for it, “Pinky”.  She, along with several others I saw, had nose piercings, between the nostrils.   I don’t think it’s an attractive look, and I blow my nose too much to do that!
Then there was this mechanic from Delaware doing a thru hike.  He was resisting the trail names he’d been given.  I noticed his hat said “Matco Tools”, so I suggested Tools.  He got a thoughtful look, and maybe that one will stick.
Then there were two young men, Canoe and Leaf Picker.  I didn’t see him pick any leaves. They were also doing a thru hike.
There were a number of day hikers as well, as there was access and parking at Rock Gap.  I had lunch there and had the place all to myself.  That was nice after seeing so many people in the morning.
I’m the afternoon I ran into a group from Scotland.  I couldn’t catch much of what they said.  I asked one of them twice what his trail name was, and missed it.  I dubbed him Mumbly.
I saw fewer people in the afternoon.  I arrived at Long Branch around 2, having done 7.2 miles.  It was early to stop but I wanted a slower start than last time.  I was alone while I set up my tent.  By 3:00, folks started arriving.  By 3:45 all the tent sites were taken and there’s a lot of people here.  
I had taken off my sweater around 10, as the day and I warmed up.  I put it back on around 3:30 as I was getting cold.  Not sure how cold it will get tonight, but I’ll leave a cup of water out and see if it freezes.  Im prepared for cold weather so I should be able to stay warm.  We will see what I’m saying tomorrow after tenting tonight.

Cowboy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609185,"I went to bed early, and fell asleep pretty quick. But then tossed and turned much of the night, as it got colder and colder. I realized around 3:00 that my sleeping bag zipper was pretty messed up leaving the bag open and me cold.  I needed light to fix and eventually found my head lamp which was inexplicably buried in the last place i looked.  I was much warmer with a sweater and hat on, and the bag closed. I got up around 7:15, though it had been light for some time. The Fitbit said I’d gotten over 10 hours of sleep which was wonderful. I felt pretty disorganized and it took me around an hour and twenty minutes to get all packed up. 
I felt good when I started off but was huffing and puffing before long. I stopped to get extra water as there is none between Long Branch and Albert Mountain.  I didn’t want to carry the extra weight but knew it was the wise thing to do. 
I passed a northbound hiker pretty soon. I said good morning and he looked at me like I was a bug.  I don’t know his name but I gave him the trail name of Sociopath. 
I then came across an elderly man. I almost didnt stop to talk after my brief interaction with Sociopath, but I’m glad I did. His trail name is Luke Walker, and while he was only 5 years older than me, he could easily have passed for 20 years older.  I learned he had been battling leukemia for the past several years.  And he was spending the time he had left backpacking. He was on a thru hike and had done the first 100 miles.  He is keeping a blog at  mountains that remain.com and has been on the trail 22 days.  He served in the military for 20 years and is from Alabama. He was diagnosed in 2017 and only given a few months to live. He sold everything and went to Montana to hike until the snow was too deep deep.  He wintered at home before spending the next summer hiking all over Colorado. His doctors are telling him he can’t complete the AT but he sure wants to. He says he’s feeling the leukemia now and things aren’t working right.  Read his blog and keep him in your prayers. I hope to see him again when we turn northbound later today. 
Some other folks I met included Scott from Sarasota (sort of a boring trail name), Beast (he was a large hairy man), Pop Tart (who has thru hiked twice but was just out doing a section hike).  Pop Tart was hurrying into town to escape the weather and get to a McDonalds (eh, no thank you) as the weather looks grim tonight.  Rain is coming ahead of a front that is going to bring markedly colder weather (I was already cold).
I did the 2.5 miles to Albert Mountain by 11 and am waiting for the Gainesville Gang. The tower is open and it’s lovely to sit up in the enclosed room, seeing 10s of miles in all directions while listening to the wind howl.  It’s great to be out of the wind. 
The Gainesville Gang arrived around 2:30, and I was surprised to see two unexpected faces.  Two friends of Mama Bear came as well.  They are from Sarasota. So that makes 8 in our group. Here’s the rundown: Mama Bear, Machete, Stitch (Kim), Willow and Beast (Machete’s Daughter’s), and Katie and Ebony from Sarasota. 
We returned back to Long Branch and thankfully there was one tent site left that we fit four tents into. And the fifth tent went into a flat space that two folks who were using hammocks. 
We had a good dinner and are preparing for a cold wet night. There’s talk of coming off the trail Sunday night die to temperatures in the low 20s.

Cowboy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609267,"Long Branch was crowded when we arrived at the end of Saturday (Day 2) and we really had to squeeze in. We were all on slopes of various angles. I was probably on the steeper end. We knew cold rain was coming and took precautions to keep water from running under the tent and between the ground tarp.  I bag legs most of my things in a trash bag as an extra precaution. 
We had a good dinner and were wash in our tents by around 8:30.  It was hard to stay on my sleeping pad because my bag and I kept slipping and sliding down the pad to the downhill side of the tent.   It was like I was on the slip n slide of my youth.  I went to sleep easy but kept waking up in a ball at the bottom of the tent. 
The wind was really kicking up as the evening wore on. You could hear it slamming into ridge beside us in an undulating roar.  Sounded like a freight train going by again and again and again...
The rain started around 12:30 and came in a serious of cells in varying degrees of intensity.  I kept feeling like I was getting wet but just dismissed it. Until there was no doubt. The bottom of my tent was wet.  I think I essentially pushed the tent out from under the tarp as I repeatedly slid down and push against the tent to push myself back up. Not good. Especially with the bottom of my sleeping bag  being wet. 
I took the full trash bag filled with my treasures an put it at the base of my sleeping pad. So that I’d slide into the bag but stay out is the water.   That worked pretty well until I really fell asleep deeply.  And awoke to my feet and the trash bag being in the water. I found sleeping diagonally worked best as I would slide into my pack and stay out of the water. 
It was still raining off and on til around 6:30.  I tried to go back to sleep until I heard the others stirring. I got up and started dealing with the wet mess.  My clothes were all dry so really it was a wet tent and a wet sleeping bag. 
We had a hot bfast and continued packing up, it wasn’t a quick process.  That gave us all time to agree that we didn’t want to spend the night out with temps in the low 20s and wet tents and gear.  So the consensus was to come off the trail and head into Franklin for the night. 
We planned to pick up the Gainesville Ganfs two cars from Standing Indian Campground, which I’d seen a sign for on Friday.  Machete hadn’t told her companions that essentially they were doing a big loop and were going to pass their cars after walking 30 miles! Hahahahahaha.   Everyone was a pretty good sport because we were close to the cars and could use them to get into Franklin. 
We stopped to catch our breath at Rock Gap and a local drives up in a tourist bus and offers to give us a lift to Franklin or the cars.  It turns out the sign I saw was 0.6 mile up but the road to the cars was paralleling the trail.  Let’s just say there was not a consensus to take the short way to the cars. Beast in particular was not happy with the decision to take the loooooooong way to the cars. 
We did get the cars and headed to the Comfort Inn.  Laundry got started and then went to the Lazy Hiker Brewery for dinner.  We are all drying our stuff, washing our clothes, and repacking our packs. Bear Bear wants to do a long hike. Machete is planning for 7 miles. I’m good with the 7 miles but think the planned 6:30 bfast is a bit too early.

Cowboy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609334,"We all slept long and well at the Comfort Inn. Machete kept us on track and we met for bfast around 6:30.  I was a little late. I was really hungry and ate my fill, including 3 boiled eggs which I seemed to be craving. 
It was really cold this morning when we went out to the cars. We think it was in the low 20s.  I felt ok with my winter gear and would be comfortable camping/hiking in this. 
We are little behind where we need to be as we have rooms booked at the Nantahala Outdoor Center on Tuesday night so we started off at the Wayah Bald Firetower.  It was a 45 minute drive from the hotel.  We arrived at 9:30 and enjoyed the glorious views. It was even colder up there as we were several thousand feet higher in the mountains, easily in the teens. Some folks had camped up there.  Brrrrrrrr
We started down the trail around 10:00 and had a wonderful downhill hike for the next two miles. 
Along the way we saw beautiful “ice blossoms” for much of the day. These were ice formations that seemed to be growing out of the ground forming long thin crystals.  There were so many of them. The last I saw was around 2:00 so they lasted a long time. Taya (aka Willow) earned a new trail name today - ice Breaker as she seemed to stumble into the ice blossoms a lot today.
The skies were such a beautiful blue today. And so clear. We are expecting clouds to come in tonight and it’s not going to be as cold. Probably just below freezing.  There is a slight chance of light snow just before dawn.  We stopped for lunch around 12.  There were some good climbing trees and Beast and Ice Breaker were soon scrambling like monkeys on the trees  
The hiking was wonderful today and the views were glorious. We planned to stealth camp at an unofficial campsite that was reported to have an iffy spring. So we loaded up with water at Cold Spring Shelter, 2.2 miles from the Big Branch Campsite.  Water is heavy (2.2 pounds per litre).  I’ve really enjoyed needing (and carrying) less water since it’s been so much cooler this trip. 
There were lots of people at Cold Spring Shelter so we rushed out to try to secure our spot at Big Branch Campsite.  I was happy to take the lead and did the 2.2 miles in around 53 minutes. That’s a quick pace in the mountains for me and not a pace I could yet sustain all day. But it felt good to turn on the speed for an hour.  My cardio was good but the legs got tired. 
We were the second group to the campsite and got the best available sites. Unfortunately the sites are sloped. I realized when setting up my tent that I just have left the tent stakes in the hotel room. The room was very dark :(.  I borrowed extras from some of the others and will be able to replace them while we are at the NOC. 
Dinner was hot and good. But I’m weary and looking forward to crawling into the sleeping bag. It’s 19:00 as I write this so not too late. It’s really starting to cool off and get cold. 
We have a longer day tomorrow, over 9 miles till NOC. And it will be a cold start.

Cowboy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609404,"Day 5 started cold and snowy. It was very cold during the night and we were all trying to stay warm and off the bottom of our tents.  One or more screech owls would screech frequently throughout the night, communicating something only they know  
Bear Bear had set her alarm for 6:00 for some reason, but no one wanted to get up.  Around 6:30 it started sleeting and that turned to a light snow.  It was hard to get out of the sleeping bag but we did by 7, amidst the light snow.  We were all bundled up shivering as we heated water for hot chocolate and apple cider. Katie had the quote of the day: “I need a full cup in order to f@&$ing heal my soul”.  
It continued to snow as we all packed up.  Our destination today was the Natanhala Outdoor Center 9.6 miles away, and 3,200 lower in elevation. 
The first 1.3 miles were downhill and quick.  It was snowy from the 4,926’ we started down to around 4,300’.   There was an accumulation on us and on the ground, maybe 1/2-1”. As usual, we are so cold until we start hiking and then we warm up quickly, needing to shed cloths.  The team had breakfast at Tellico Gap before climbing back up 800’ to Wesser Bald Firetower.   We didn’t see any snow after descending to Tellico Gap.  I saw some people I’d met previously up at the Wesser Fire Tower.  Beast and Pinky and her friend Belle (who I’d thought was Elle). They were surprised to see me but we’d skipped north 15 miles when we got back on the trail yesterday morning. We did we something weird at the Wesser Fire Tower.  There was a pink tent at the base of the fire tower.  The tent was not covered by a tent fly and was quite wet inside. There were two backpacks, a bottle of liquor, a large camp stove, two sleeping bags, air mattresses, and a cooler with food.  There was no one around and clearly hadn’t been for some time.  We didn’t find any identification. We did report what we saw when we got to the NOC.
On a day we lost so much elevation I was surprised by how much uphill we did, 159 floors. 
We met some interesting people today. One was a frail elderly woman who looked to be in her 70s. Her husband had died and she decided to do a thru hike on the AT. She was from Greenville NC and had already come over 120 miles. She looked like a strong gust of wind would blow her over but she was slow and steady.  She caught us several times during the day as we’d stopped for some reason or another. 
As we descended towards the NOC there were deep gorges on one side or the other as we worked out way down. They seemed to go hundreds of feet down. Not something you’d want to fall into.  In the middle afternoon those in the front of our group saw someone ahead of us slip and fall into the gorge, falling/slipping around 50 feet down the slope. The middle aged man was shaken up but seemed to be ok.  We assisted in the rescue using line to initially pull up the mans pack and then the man himself.  I asked his trail name and he said it now was “Ooops”. 
We arrived to the NOC around 5 and enjoyed a massive dinner before the local restaurant (there’s only one) closed at 7:00. We saw several hikers we’d met previously. We had lots of leftovers, including pizza we are planning to have for bfast. 
Most of the Gainesville Gang are having blister issues on their feet. My knees didn’t like all the steps down today.  I hyperextended one knee a little, and it didn’t like that.  All of us will bene from tomorrow’s planned 0, a day where we won’t do any hiking. We will have two nights at the NOC, and will resupply, do laundry, and maybe go whitewater rafting. We will back on the trail on Thursday, having to hike back up the other side of the gorge. 
We are all looking forward to sleeping horizontally in a cool (not frigidly cold) room.

So, are packs are bursting with food. And we are actually dumping food that we have no room for and can’t send back because we are leaving before the store opens where we can ship the stuff back. 
We visited the local outfitter to replace lost and broken gear.  I’d left my tent stakes in Franklin and I was able to replace them today.  
We took the opportunity to go white water rafting at NOC today. It was an 8 mile class 1-3 river. It was a lot of fun. And Ice Breaker popped off the raft like a cork off a champagne bottle during the roughest part of the river.  
We all had trouble finding room in the packs for everything as we packed this evening.

Cowboy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609539,"We left NOC around 8:30 this morning after dumping/donating a lot of food.  I think I’m carrying enough food for at least 12 days and my 85L pack is bursting at the seams, and is heavy.  
We were expecting temps in the mid 40s but it was much colder, so I dug into my pack for a sweater.  Only to take it off after 20 mins of uphill walking on the trail. 
Our pace was steady but not fast.  My left knee (the hyper-extended one) complained a bit this morning but was fine this afternoon. My right calf threatened cramping but calmed down. 
We met some folks on the trail.  There was Sweet Caroline and Sailor from Tennessee.  There was Culver from North Carolina.  And then there was a family of four also from Tennessee.   The older one looked to be a teenager but the girl looked to be pre teen.  They were going to pass close to their home but had no intention of stopping by the homestead.  They were committed to doing the thru hike.  We all wondered about school for the kids.  
We arrived at Sassafras Gap Shelter around 2:30, pretty early.   We were tired from the uphill day.  The forecast is for rain tonight and tomorrow.  And it’s pretty chilly.  I decided to squeeze into the Shelter (hikers are packed in like sardines) while the others decided to tent.  Time will tell if I made the right decision, I suspect the Shelter will be loud and disruptive. 
We had a good fire and a hot meal but were all getting cold as the afternoon progressed.  
Tomorrow is more distance but should be less elevation gain.

Cowboy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609667,"I didn’t sleep well in the Shelter with 15 strangers. But at least my stuff was dry.  The Gainesville Gang (“GG”) didn’t sleep well either. The space was tight and sloping. The rain started around 11:00 PM and continued till after dawn. 
There was chaos in the Shelter as folks got up and tried to eat and get organized and back on the trail. I wasn’t ready till 9:30, really late. Some of the GG weren’t ready until 10:30 and we left shortly thereafter.  We weren’t the last to leave. 
We started with a 700’ climb over the first mile.  I felt strong and did the climb at a 1.5/hour pace. Then I ran out of gas. 
The next hour was steeply downhill on a rough narrow trail. It was mud covered and very wet.  It was treacherous.  And after slipping badly a couple of times, I took a tumble down a slippery muddy rock, right off the trail. I got very muddy but wasn’t hurt bad. It was exhausting to get back on the trail.  I slowed down to avoid a repeat. The second hour, going down was at a 1.2 mile/jour pace, really slow and just a symptom of the trail conditions. 
Trail conditions improved though the terrain today was brutal.  Lots of ups and downs.  We hiked among the clouds (fog) till after 1:00.  The sun peaked through as we climbed above the cloud deck. 
I saw Carver again today, he’d also stayed in the Shelter. He recently retired from the Army  after serving for 24 years. I also saw Janga a couple of times. I’d met him in the Shelter. He helped me find a bag I’d lost. 
Doppler (also named Steve) and his wife were also in the Shelter last night. They’d left ahead of us.  We saw them at a road intersection in the latter part of the trail today. Then again when Doppler’s wife was returning (downhill) to retrieve water bottles they’d forgotten.  
I’d been accustomed to being the strongest/quickest and arriving at camp first. Not today. Kay Kay, Eb, and Bear Bear all arrived before me. There was a 600-700’ climb from the road intersection and I didn’t think I was going to make it.  My cardio was ok, but muscle fatigue was extreme. 
Tomorrow will be easier and hopefully I’ll feel stronger.  Today was a really sweaty day and my legs, close to my crotch got really chapped.  They were painful much of the day.  Hopefully tomorrow I can keep the area dry.

Cowboy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609806,"We all slept well and the morning started cool but not cold.  Fog rolled in before we left camp.  
Bear Bear, Kay Kay, and Eb had camped 0.2 farther down the trail since the Brown Fork Campsite was tight and not very flat.  Machete, Ice Breaker, Beast, Stitch  and I went ahead and stayed at Brown Fork and made the best of it.  
We were on the trail around 9:30 and met up with the rest of the crew.  We did our daily picture and headed out.  
The trail today gave us a bit of everything without too much of anything. There were steep slippery downs, there were steep and gentle ups, there were big boulder fields, and lots of gentle slopes. It was probably 75% down today.  Everyone hiked well and we were glad the day was pretty easy.  I felt better than the last two days but still am surprised by the depth of fatigue I’m feeling.  At this point last fall I was much stronger. 
Now that it’s warmed up and I’ve started really sweating my legs have painfully chafed.  I’ve been using Kay Kays A&D ointment lavishly today and it seems to have helped the chafing from getting any worse.  
We saw some familiar faces today, Carver, Slim, and another Cowboy. 
We arrived at Cable Gap Shelter around 2:00, after going 6.1 miles.  It was a lovely short day.  Our pace was good.  Kay Kay found us a great campsite where we could all be together, by a stream, and with a fire pit.  We set up camp leisurely and started a fire around 4:30.   We avoided the smoke and ash as best we could.  We boiled water and ate hot meals around 5:30 and kept the fire going till dark.  It started getting chilly as the sun went down and some of the Gang started heading to bed.  I’m not far behind.  I’m listening to the gurgling of a small waterfall next to my tent as I write this.  
We will arrive at Fontana Dam tomorrow afternoon. The GG will come off the trail as well.  I’ll be back on my own again. I’ll stay the night at the Lodge and do laundry and dry everything out that is wet (it may rain tonight).  I have a decision to make as well.  Do I tackle Smokey Mountain National Park or do I skip it and shuttle north around it. I have Shelter reservations In the Park, but the mileage I have to do each day feels out of reach given the fatigue I’m feeling. An option is to arrange a shuttle that takes me north of the park, and then I can hike at my own pace without worrying about not being able to make a long day and reach my designated Shelter in the Park.  I’ll make the decision on Sunday evening. 
As 8:00 approaches it’s chilly and I’m heading to my tent.  There’s no cell service so I’ll post this on Sunday when I can.  The nice thing about posting this later is that I get to add things I’d forgotten. For instance on Friday I forget to add that during one of the times I slipped, one of my hiking poles flexed do far I was sure it would snap. But thankfully it did not.

Cowboy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609960,"I saw Carver, Slim, Cowboy, and Guitar Man at breakfast.  I was surprised as I thought they were a day ahead of me. They’d taken a zero yesterday and were heading into the trail after breakfast. A miserable day for muddy hiking as it’s rained most of the day.  And is still raining as I write this. 
A young woman came up to one of the hiker tables at bfast and started chatting. She was explaining how she had too much food and that made her pack too heavy.  And these had been the two most miserable days of hiking due to that. I think some of my struggle has been just that, my pack is too heavy.  Shoutout thanks to Bear Bear for taking my bear canister and surplus gear and mailing it back to me. I hope the reduction in weight helps me. 
I saw various other hikers arriving throughout the day. I didn’t know any of them. 
While doing laundry (way across Fontana Village) I met Johnny Be Good, who lives up in Maine. He was doing his second thru hike on the AT.  The previous one was in 2016.  
I waited as long as could for it to stop raining but eventually gave in and walked to the only place serving Dinner in Fontana Village.  There I saw some familiar faces as well, Jango, Doppler and his wife.  They’d all taken a zero today due to the weather.  All were planning to get back on the trail tomorrow.  I saw Jango and Doppler again as I went back to the lodge. I learned that Jango and I share a birthdate (I’m five years older). He was kind to me when I spent my first night in the Shelter several days ago and I’m thankful I keep running into him.  
I’ve arranged for a ride to Davenport Gap, at the northern edge of Smoky Mountain National Park.  The earliest they could pick me up is noon, and I should be on the trail by 2, hopefully sooner.  I’ll either stay at a campsite 5 miles in or stealth camp somewhere along the way if it is getting late. 
I’ve rested a lot today, but am sore and still feeling run down. I did do some yoga to help with the soreness and will go to bed early tonight and sleep late tomorrow. 
At breakfast, I heard the quote of the day from from a youngish (compared to me) man who had hiked his last day on the AT.  He was coming off the trail for good after completing over 160 miles. He told a fellow thru hiker he’d been with for a while “I don’t know what I was looking for....but I didn’t find it.”   I think the truth is that he hadn’t found it yet. I hope he does.

Cowboy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610025,"I got on the trail right at 2:00 (really a late start) and headed off.  As is typically for a “Gap”, it’s a local low point. Davenport is really low with an elevation of less than 1,500’ so it was no surprise that I went uphill, and uphill, and uphill.  
I reached my first potential campsite around 4:00 after gaining 1,400’ in elevation. It was a nice location on a rushing stream.  Two hikers were already camping there.  One was sleeping in the sun. The other was a young woman named Double Stuffed (because she carries two coats). It was early for me to stop so I kept going, uphill, and uphill, and uphill. The temperature was in the 70s and I was really sweating a lot, like drenched. I was able to stay hydrated but I’m thinking I want to get an early start tomorrow morning with a plan to hike more in the cooler hours and sit out the warmest hours. 
I started looking for places to camp after 5:30 and soon found one.  At this point I’m around 4,000’ in elevation.  The location has a nice breeze, is close to the trail and has cell coverage - works for me. I set up camp, cooked dinner, hung my bear bag and was in my tent before 7.  One hiker passed me while I was eating dinner but I didn’t see anyone else.  It’s gotten much cooler as the sun is going down and I’m about to get in my sleeping bag in order to stay warm.
Tomorrow will be a longer, harder day, but at least I’ve done a lot of elevation today that I won’t have to do tomorrow.

Cowboy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610091,"I remembered this morning some things I meant to talk about yesterday.  
Two days and a bit farther north has taken me into a world where the trees are budding.  The skeletal forest is starting to go green. More and more flowers are blooming. It’s a lovely time to be on the AT.
Also, when I got on the trail yesterday afternoon I noticed that there were pine trees mixed in. And pine needles on the trail.  The forest took on a whole new smell.  As I’ve gone up higher in elevation I’m not seeing the pine trees anymore but hopefully I will as the week progresses.  
I didn’t sleep well last night and had a dream that an enormous bear was stomping around outside my tent. And in my dream I couldn’t move.  Waking up from that had the heart racing.  
I formally got up at 6:50, did the morning duties, including a hot breakfast, and was on the trail by 7:50.  
My chafed legs continue to improve and I had no pain today.  I am continuing to use the A&D ointment I got from Kay Kay.  
There was a lot of up and down today. My fatigue seemed better and knowing that I had a long day ahead of me allowed me to pace myself.  I took a 30 minute lunch break. I stopped and read for 20 minutes among a sea of white flowers (more later).  I stopped atop Max Patch Mountain and just laid in the sun. 
And I saw a lot of people.  It turns out that many thru hikers had stayed at a hostel near where I started yesterday and they caught up to me midday. I’d gone 8 miles and they’d gone 11.  I met lots of interesting folks.  
There was ET, extraterrestrial turtle. 
There was Pocket Pussy.  Who was hiking with his cat.  Yes his cat.  The cat was gorgeous and spends the day in PP’s front pocket.  He was the guy who went by while I was having dinner last night.  
There was Rick Flair, who had hair like the professional wrestler.  He was from North Carolina but had no intention of stopping by the homestead. 
There was Granite, a young woman from the White Mountains of New Hampshire. The AT passed close to her home.  
And I’ve forgotten a lot of the other folks I met. 
I walked through some beautiful places.  Spring is definitely here. And moving up in elevation. For over a mile there was a sea of small white flowers blooming. It looked like snow on the ground but was flowers. It was amazing. 
Mid afternoon, after a long walk uphill, I came across my first Trail Magic.  A retired couple were cooking and serving hamburgers and hotdogs and sodas and chips and fruit and Oreo cookies.  A lot of the thru hikers who’d passed me were milling about the Trail Magic when I arrived.  While there i had a cheeseburger, a hot dog, two bags of Cheetos, an orange, a Mountain Dew, and a couple bottles of water.   I never did hear there names but the husband said he was in Witness Protection (don’t think he was serious) and the wife was a retired school teacher.  They had a sign up sheet, took our pictures, and listened to our stories. It was a lovely act of kindness. Oh and I saw Double Stuffed again at the Trail Magic. 
I got to the Roaring Fork Shelter at 4:00 but didn’t like it.  It was humid, with no breeze, and no cell service.  I’d done 12 miles at that point but continued on as the terrain was pretty flat.  
1.3 miles further down the trail I found a reasonably flat place that was next to a creek, had a breeze, wasn’t humid, and which had a cell signal. I stopped there for the day.  Camp is set up, Bear line hung (it took me a long time to get the bear line hung today), dinner made and eaten.  And I’ll be in the tent by 7:15 for the night.

Cowboy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610188,"The first two miles were downhill to level and I made good time. I was then faced with two large uphill climbs. The first of the thru hikers, who’d started behind me caught up with me around 11:30 when I’d stopped for a snack. 
I saw Double Stuff and Pocket Pussy several times throughout the day.  I finally got a picture of the cat on PP’s pocket.  Granite passed me midday and I never saw her again. 
After the grueling uphill there was a loooooong gentle downhill that was extremely favorable for making good time.  The terrain and elevation was varied. I was as high as 4,700’ and as low as 1,400’ (end of the day). I walked through multiple pine forests, multiple fields of white (and  slightly pink) flowers, multiple carpets of leaves.  
On the way down I met a couple of folks. There was Peanut from Denver. She’s a young lady doing a solo hike. I’d first saw her with Zippy (when they passed me) but I later learned they’d just met that day.  I saw Zippy after she’d set up camp and learned she was from Reno, also doing a solo hike, and she was avoiding the shelters and campsites because she was really sensitive to noise and wanted to camp alone. 
I arrived at my planned campsite, Deer Park Mountain Shelter, around 3:30. It was really a pretty location, in a pine forest with lots of good tent sites. I’d done over 13 miles at that point.  I’d only been able to do that distance because of the gentle terrain and lots of downhill. It’s funny but on a normal day it seems like there is a lot more uphill, than downhill. But really it’s normally about the same (today was an exception).  The reality for me is that i do spend a lot more time on uphill because I go slower, probably less than half the speed I go downhill.  So my perception isn’t wrong - I do spend more time going uphill, than downhill. And you need to go quicker down otherwise you’re (if you’re me) going really slow. 
I did see a first for me on the trail.  I saw an elderly gentleman working on cutting back the various vegetation that tries to encroach on the trail. He been doing that for a number of years and he parked as close as he could then walked up and got to work cutting things back. 
Anyway, I’d told myself that if i got to the campsite before 4:00, I’d continue on into the village of Hot Springs, NC. It would add almost four miles to my hike.  I looked at the elevation and it was mostly downhill.  I rested 15 minutes at the Shelter and discussed options with PP, Peanut, and Double Stuffed.  The latter two were going to stay at the campsite but PP was going into town. Except the cat didn’t want to go and wouldn’t come to master, at least while I was there. I did learn that the cat typically walked around 5 miles a day and the rest of the time he was carried.  
So I set off to Hot Springs. And there seemed like so much uphill. And I was tired.  I was soon passed by PP as if I was standing still.  He’s a fast hiker. I was surprised to catch up with him (and the cat) some time later as he was taking a break. I figured it was the cat but he said he was tired (me too).  When he did get back on he passed me with ease as I trudged slowly uphill.  
I had a little signal at the higher points but made the decision to lock down a hotel when I was right outside of town - big mistake. There’s no ATT in Hot Springs and thus no service for me. 
The AT goes right through town and after talking to an elderly lady walking her dog I continued into town. I asked for suggestions a couple of times.  As I walked by the Alpine Motel I was greeted by a fellow hiker I’d met in passing yesterday.  She offered me a phone that worked and even her shower.  Her room was full of hikers her dog and her BF. They were kind and eventually (after many tries because the “management” was not on premise) “scored” a room at the Alpine. It’s pretty rough. No WiFi. Not even a mirror in the bathroom. Along the way I’d stopped by the closed Visitor Center to look for intel on where to stay. And the guy who manned it came back by because he’d forgotten something (so lucky for me) and he gave me the WiFi password for the visitor center.  Which is close by the basic Alpine Motel.    Thus allowing me to post this note and to remain in contact with loved ones. 
Tomorrow is likely to be hard as I’m back at a low elevation, and there’s only one way forward, back up.

Cowboy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610296,"I got on the trail a bit after 10:00. I thought I’d miss the crush of thru hikers by leaving later.  I was soooooo wrong. 
The first part of the day was a lovely walk along the French Broad River, which was roaring.  Then the climb began. I quickly realized how much of a struggle today was going to be. I’d hoped that a big dinner and a long sleep would leave me ready for the day, but I was mistaken.  Physically I was exhausted from the long hike yesterday.  
The initial climb up was sloooooow. And exhausting. I was passed so many times.  Most people didn’t talk, but I enjoyed chatting with No Rush. I also was in no rush today. 
There were three lookouts on the cliff overlooking Hot Springs. I took my time at each. The second has the disturbing name of Lovers Leap Rock which is related to an old Cherokee Indian love story gone wrong. 
Really I took my time all day as I shuffled along. It was warm today, probably in the low 80s.  With the exertion due to the unending climb I was soaked in sweat.  It was almost a relief when it started raining on me, really just a brief shower.  My pack was covered and the rain wasn’t too cold.  It helped briefly cool me off.  Though this didn’t increase my pace any as I continued to be passed throughout the day.  
I met Mr President twice and he took my picture both times. He also wanted to me listen to this looooooong song Alice’s Restaurant which i hadn’t heard before.  There was a W Bench at the hotel he stayed at and apparently that bench was for young men that didn’t have the appropriate moral compass to be allowed to serve in the Vietnam War. 
I saw some of the people I’d met last night at the Alpine Hotel. One thing I forgot to write about yesterday was that the couple who was helping me score a room were hiking with a dog. A vicious creature that was biting lots of people, myself included.  I’d worked with this dog a bit and thought we were friends but when I went in their room to tell them I had a room the dog lunged at me and nipped my private parts.  Let’s just say that I’m thankful I’ve already had children. 
Both Zippy (who’d visited the public library and bought some books) and Peanut (who was slack packing today) went by while I was having lunch.  Peanut was just carrying a day pack and had arranged a shuttle to bring her back to Hot Springs tonight. And one for tomorrow morning to where she finished today in the morning. Slack Packing is a way to do some miles without a pack. That’s what I should have done today!
I really took a lot of breaks today and did a lot of reading (and sweating, and resting of fatigued muscles). 
I met Lucky Penny and Blue Shoes at a dammed pond while listening to the Alice’s Restarant song with Mr President. They are in their mid 20s from Kentucky.  They were pleasant and encouraging, but not willing to carry my pack. 
I met an English couple doing a day bike and they seemed a bit lost.  They were on (or wanted to be on) a trail that crossed the AT.  I hope I steered them the right way. I did ensure they had water in case I sent them off into the wilderness.  
I was light headed a lot today and late in the day when i tripped on a tiny root, I knew I needed to get off the trail.  I found a place soon afterwards and am stealth camping off the trail in one of the few places I had cell service today.

Cowboy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610422,"The rain had held off during the night. But the radar was looking pretty grim with lots of storms looming today, with more coming during the night and Sunday.  I reached out to my shuttle driver and he was available to pick me up at 12 if I backtracked to Tanyard Gap. I went ahead and made the decision to backtrack and get off the trail a day early before the deluge really hit.  
I had time to leisurely pack up and enjoy the morning and the site. My campsite was around 30’ uphill from the trail, set back a ways. I noticed hikers walking by as I was eating breakfast and they didn’t see me.  When you’re walking on the trail you’re normally watching closely where you step, not looking up or off the trail unless there is a view to see.  It was strange to watch people walk by and not interact with them. 
I read for a while and listened to the  wind and birds around me.  It was a lovely way to spend the morning. After a while I finished packing up and returned to Tanyard Gap.  
While waiting for my shuttle driver I met a couple of day hikers.  One was a young woman with a happy dog.  She said this was her dogs favorite day and that they went for a hike once every weekend.  
I got picked up and had an easy, rain filled, drive back to Asheville, NC. I booked a flight back a day early, did laundry, scrubbed myself good, had a big dinner at a local artisan pizza place, and am ready to come home and jump back into normal life.  I miss my friends and family and my dog!
It will be a busy week as I leave on a business trip to the ME, India, and Czech Republic right after Easter. 
And thus concludes another grand backpacking adventure.
