Happy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607658,"Just opening this journal to use on my attempt to flip flop hike the AT this year. The weather is not cooperating at present. I'd like to get some final quality training in before I arrive in Harpers Ferry but the local trails are iced over and it is just too cold. On the other hand, I trained all last year on the local trails and had a good trip down to Virginia in late August. My hiking partner, KDL, or Almost There, and I did the Rhodedendron trail loop through Grayson Highlands from Fox Creek parking lot. We avoided Doc's Knob due to bear problems but did stay at the Old Orchard and Wise shelters and then tented the last night at The Stables. Then we went up to Shenendoah and tented at Lewis Mountain. We day hiked several of the falls trails and visited with some of the SOBOs coming through. 
My training was interrupted by the need for abdominal surgery in late September to fix some adhesions and I missed about a month. Fortunately, it was a nice fall and winter has also had some thaws so I haven't been restricted to local recreation center for all of my training.",,Home,"Mar 06, Wed",0
Happy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608194,"This is one of the places where I do ""hill"" training. It's a sledding hill at one of our local parks. When there is snow on the ground, I can go up and down the steps When the snow is gone, like in this picture, I just climb up and down on the grass. It's not much when compared to the AT but it's what we have.",,Hines park toboggan hills,"Mar 16, Sat",4

Happy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608438,"Nice weather day and got in two loops of the trail, two hours per loop.  I want to start with a pair of Altra hi tops that seem just a little short in the left foot. I wore them today with a pair of double layer socks and they seem fine. I've gone up a full size in the past two years and I hope now I can stay with size 13. I have another pair of shoes from the same company and I have to wear extra thick socks with them. I'm concerned that if I order shoes mid-hike, that they fit.",,Pinckney Rec Area,"Mar 19, Tue",10
Happy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608581,Did 10 ups and downs on the hill and then once around the outside loop of the nature trails. Cloudy and chilly all day. Did see the albino deer who is all the rage this year. Maybe a pic next week.,,Kensington Park,"Mar 21, Thu",0

Tested shoes and I have two good pairs ready to go. I'm going to start with the high top Altra Lone Peak 3.5 and get the low cut 4.0's sent to me when I wear out the 3.5s. Feeling ready.

I still have 3 hours until I walk up to the corner, catch a bus to the train station, catch another bus there to the train and then on to Harpers Ferry. I should get in at 11:30am. From the stop it's a half mile walk back to the ATC Headquarters where I will pick up my thru-hiker tag, watch a presentation on ""leave no trace"", and then head back to the bridge over the Potomac River (guthook mile 1025) and along the tow path that is the start my trip.

Visited the ATC Headquarters, got my tag and picture in the book and got back to the bridge and official start of my hike at 1pm. It took 3 hours to get to the shelter and a half hour more to go down for the water. Nice shelter. Going to have it all to myself tonight.

Came a little further than planned to avoid a long hike for water from the shelter. It was greening up down in Harpers Ferry but the woods today was still brown.

Happy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609545,"There were quite a few people out on this section. I met 5 thru hikers going south, one couple, 3 singles. Haven't caught anyone yet :)  The others were folks walking their dogs or stretching their legs. On a section where I noticed extra blazes, I met the maintainers with paint brushes in hand. They have a 1.5 mile section and a gallon of paint. I left humming ""Painting the Roses Red"". Also, a guy came through my campsite who said he was local and planning to bring a group up to hammock. When he left, he gave me an enormous orange. Had it for breakfast.","POGO campsite

Happy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609655,"the predicted weather came in overnight. It was a cold and rainy hike today. Glad It was a short one to get in to a bath, pizza, and warm bed. The trail down from Highpoint Overlook was tough for about 3/4 of a mile. I did my first butt slide to get down one large rock. Met several campers going up to the shelter I had to myself last night. I think it gets a lot of weekenders. The hostel is a work of art. Most of the floor and some of the walls have been ""tiled"" with smooth river pebbles and some bright colored glass. Plus three catsBedtime its past 8.","Raven Rock Shelter

The trail (first day in PA, YAY) could be mistaken for the trails I hike at home. There were few really rocky areas and the path was mostly dirt and gravel. A big change from Md. They say the real rocks don't start for 100 miles. In tonite at 4 with my feet up. There are 2 small shelters here. One is marked for scorers and one for nonsmokers. I've got the latter one to myself so far. :)
All in all, it's been a good day.","PenMar park
",Tumbling Run shelter,"Apr 06, Sat",8.50
Happy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609845,"Another great weather day. Big climb to start and then a long ridge walk. The trail led up to and over the crest several times today. Each crossing meant a rock scramble of several hundred yards. I'm starting to like the challenge although they are physically hard and a little scary. I think I'll get better at them as I go along.Lots of people out today. A group of 6 scouts and 3 adults caught me after the climb. 2 young guys were on their way to Harper's Ferry. And a number of couples out for the day, some with their dogs naturally.I've pulled into a hostel for tonite and am taking tomorrow off. The hostel has an old bike for the guests to ride to the stores. I made one trip down to the $gen and will go again tomorrow.

Happy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609913,"This was the first (of many, No doubt) days with no hiking. I spent the day doing my town chores. I planned my next several days of hiking in terms of distance. I plan to go 10 miles each of the first two days, then 7 miles the third day. That's the plan that I bought food to cover. There is a store that I should get to the third day and then I'll resupply for the next days. My new shoes already have the toe bumper detaching. I was able to by some ""miracle glue"" to try to fix them. Altra shoes are known for this problem. There are two section hikers staying here for five days while they hike parts of the trail.

Happy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610026,"I made the Birch Run shelter at two o'clock on the nose. Although this was my planned stopping point today, I decided to go the extra 6.3 to this next shelter. I was good at the 14 mile mark, but was pretty beat by the time I got here. Sharing the shelter with a recent retiree named Sam who is section hiking to Duncannon.  
Much of the trail was flat and wide today and it was easy to get a good rhythm going. I had a large stack of blueberry pancakes for breakfast and that contributed to the effort also. 
I passed the halfway point on the trail which doesn't mean much to me since I started on the trail 75 miles back at the 1025 mile point. Every time I pass a mile point the ends in 25 I'll have gone a hundred miles. 
The gentlemen with me in the photo are Condor 3, a retired FBI agent, and Commander Plodder, retired naval officer. They are section hiking this area from the hostel and have hiked all of the trail from Massachusetts south to where we are now.","Trail of Hope hostel Fayetteville, PA

Happy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610089,"Today I paid for the longer miles that I hiked yesterday. I did get to my shelter by 3pm and have been resting up. 
Two young section hiker/rock climbers have joined me for the night here though not in the shelter. Forecast is for it to be in the high 30s tonight so it will be good to get snugged in to my quilt.
The trail today was a contrast of rocky and smooth.  There was several miles of paved and groomed trail through the park, then a long, moderate up followed by the last several miles of rock scrambling. 
Early in tomorrow's hike I plan to stop at a nearby store and get enough food for the next four days. If I feel up to it and everything goes well, that should take me into Duncannon. Fingers crossed.","Toms Run shelter

Then it was up to and through a long rocky area with large step ups and downs. The trail the rest of the day was tame by comparison.There are a few plots of wildflowers showing and down here in town the forsythia is blazing. The weather really has been ideal as have the trail conditions. It has been a big help to not have to deal with bad weather here at the start. Tomorrow I'll cross over the Cumberland Valley.

Happy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610283,"I expected today to be mostly pasture hiking but it turns out the trail winds through narrow woodsy borders between the fields. The trail was well maintained and the hiking was easy and fast. It made the last mile of steep climbing in the rain not a problem.I met Glen, an agemate, in the shelter. He thruhiked in 2008 and is out on a little 50 mile hike now. He was able to give me some good advice for my next section as he had just come through there.As we were finishing dinner, a group of 6 hikers came in so we scrambled around to accomdate them. They are out for the weekend and may try to get a fire going. We shall see.Nate has been kind enough to send out a pair of shoes that I'll get in Duncannon on Monday. This will be my third pair since the start. Hopefully this pair will work. I just got new Altras through REI last week, but I'm jamming one toe on the down hills. They were fine today but, like I said, there were no down hills today.I uploaded a group of pictures to instagram. My user name there is hikeonout. I try to put those pics up as I take them and then just put one up here that captures a theme for the day.","Boiling Springs
",Darlington Shelter,"Apr 12, Fri",14.70
Happy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610356,"Got going at 8:30, late for me. I was able to take my time today since I would not have to set up camp. The early trail was down with water draining from last nights rain. It was warm going across the lower pastures but then cooled off after a long uphill to a ridge line. The ridge walk was rocky. It culminated at Hawk Rock, which is an overlook of the river and town below. Being a Saturday, there were quite a few hikers at and on the way up to the view.Not gonna lie, the hike down was brutal. My trailguide gives the descent as only 700 ft. but there was a little 150 ft or so ascent thrown in by the trail gnomes just to add to the total down. Most of it was large rock steps of varying heights. So I had to take my time and go slow, lowering myself off of each step down to the next. Surer feet might hop down trail like this but it's my hiking policy to always have at least one foot in contact with the ground at all times.Anyhoo, I've had my fried chicken dinner in the hotel dining room and retired to my room for the night. I'm taking tomorrow off from hiking so I can do laundry, plan the next four or five days, food shop, and rest my legs.","Darlington Shelter
","Doyle Hotel, Duncannon, PA","Apr 13, Sat",10.90
Happy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610468,"Drizzly, gray, somber day off the trail. I got up at my new hike time of 6:00 and made my morning coffee on the windowsill of my room by heating the water with my canister stove. Then I ate the last tuna packet and some Quaker instant oatmeal with apples while I watched Main Street wake up on Sunday.
After breakfast cleanup, I took my wad of trail clothes to the laundromat just down the street. I had just finished starting the washers up when I saw Craig Mains and his partner T-Rex walk by. He is hiking from Georgia to Maine and then back to Georgia this year while vlogging his hike for YouTube. I yelled out at them and they stopped and I got to fist bump with them. I told him that if I hike my hike he will pass me again on the way back and maybe once again in Virginia. Rubbing shoulders with celebrities here.
I spent the early afternoon planning my next four days of hiking and my food needs. I called and arranged to get a ride into the town of Pine Grove next Friday to resupply. Then, at 4pm I went to the market and bought what I need to get there.
I've just finished repacking that food so that it fits into my pack, discarded any unnecessary packaging, and organized my things so that I'm ready to go in the morning. 
I want to go to the post office just as it opens to intercept a package containing another pair of shoes. If it gets out for delivery, I will have to wait here at the hotel. 8:30pm. Its bedtime.","Doyle Hotel, Duncannon, PA
","Doyle Hotel, Duncannon, PA","Apr 14, Sun",0
Happy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610514,"Heavy rain overnight, high winds, and colder by the hour. It was hard to be enthusiastic about hiking. The electricity was out in town. I went to the post office to retrieve a package with more shoes and socks at 8am. They were working in the dark and asked that I come back at 10.
Back at the Doyle, an employee said that the weather would cause the trail to be closed anyway. There is an underpass going out of town and I have seen videos of hikers wading in knee deep water through there. I was able to contact a trail angel (Mary) who assured me that the trail was open.
Upon return to the P.O. I found that my package had not arrived. I made plans with them to forward it to my next town stop. Time to hit the trail.
I planned today to be a short one and I'm glad for that. Even though I made it up to the ridge line and across a very rocky trail to the shelter before 1, I had no interest in pushing on. It's windy and getting colder by the hour. There are no campsites for 7 miles and I m not sure of the trail. So I'm in where I planned to be and will hike on tomorrow.","Doyle Hotel, Duncannon, PA
",Clark's Ferry shelter,"Apr 15, Mon",5
Happy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610610,"From the shelter to a mile before camp, the day was spent hiking the Ridge line of Peters Mountain. Mostly, it was typical woods trail. Every once in a while there would be 10 to 15 minutes of bare rock tiptoeing to do. There were views to both the left and right of the farm land in the valley. All in all, a good hike.
I met up with a guy from Germany at last nights shelter and we planned to stay at the campsite that I'm at now (I thought). But it's 6 now and he hasn't shown up. He hikes a lot faster than me but had caught me from behind on a break because he takes time going off trail to take pictures. Maybe I'll run into him tomorrow.
There is not much to add tonight. The Pennsylvania rocks have shown short previews of what's to come but haven't been too bad.","Clark's Ferry shelter

Happy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610699,"Another good weather day. The new experience was sloshing through long stretches of watercovered trail. It rained hard several days ago but not recently. I think most of this is ground water still seeping out from springs that will be dry in a month. 
Wolfgang passed my tentsite this morning as I was packing up. He camped before me and somehow I walked right by him yesterday. Probably staring at my feet and the rocks. Anyhow we made a plan to meet today and hiked the last several miles together. We are now tenting just off of the trail. We are within hearing distance of the traffic on I-81 going through Lickdale, PA.
Wolf plans to go there tomorrow and I'm going on toward Pine Grove. We will try to meet back up there on Friday night.

Both were runs of large rock scrambles. The last one came right at the end of the day and just about did me in. I was hiking along a forest road. It was easy Tuesday, but the kind of path that always makes you wonder if you are on the AT. I thought that I would just cruise to the shelter and be in by 4:30. But no. It took me 45 minutes to come the last half mile and it took all the energy I had left.I'm going in to do my town chores tomorrow and hooking back up with Wolf here.

When you ask someone from here to describe the trail,they invariably say "" Oh, it's rocky."" But there are many types of rocky trail in my opinion. Ankle breakersToe bitersKnee bendersWill sappersSole slidersTo name just a few. There were few people out today. Odd for a weekend, but it is Easter tomorrow and the storms yesterday and last night may have led to some changed plans.I did catch Wolf today and we plan to stay at a pavilion tomorrow in Port Clinton after shopping at Wal-Mart. Then he really is off to the races and I'm back to 10 mile days. I'm comfortable with that distance. These 15 mile days are going to have to wait until after Rocksylvania.","The 501 shelter
",Eagles Nest shelter,"Apr 20, Sat",15.10
Happy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611084,"Hiked a nice 8.8 trail miles plus a .7 here to the hiker pavilion. It took me all of 6 hours to do it and it won't get better for a while. It's just very rocky and I have to watch each step.
Wolf waited for me and we were able to get a shuttle driver to take us to and from the local wallys. He worked us in around his family's Easter dinner. We had forgotten the holiday. I bought food for the next four days and ate dinner at Subway.
I'm sleeping at a pavilion that the town has set aside for hikers. Wolf and I are the only ones here tonight, but I understand it gets crowded later when the bubbles come through. 
So my plan is to reduce my daily mileage to 10 or just below that each day until I reach the end of Pennsylvania in 76 miles. I bought a new pair of insoles for my shoes and a 100 ct. bottle of ibuprophen. I'm ready to go in the morning.","Eagles Nest shelter
","Port Clinton, PA","Apr 21, Sun",8.80
Happy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611174,"So I said goodbye to Wolf for the third time at 8 am and we left to go north. I planned an 11 mile day and he was going 15. There were two big climbs during the day and some rock scrambling, but overall the trail was not difficult.
When I arrived at the spring that I planned to camp at, it was only 3:30. So I filled my bottles with enough water for dinner and breakfast and decided to hike another mile to what I thought would be a better campsite. When I arrived, it was too small for my tent. While I was sitting at the site considering my next move a day hiker came by and we struck up a conversation. She informed me that she had come up the trail that led downhill toward the shelter and that it was all woods road and easy hiking. As she was heading that way, I decided that I would go along and get to the shelter that Wolf had headed for. My companion was a newly minted Speech Therapist working with kids in an education setting. IEPs and all that jazz, if you know. 
It was a 3 mile downhill walk to the shelter but with .9 miles remaining, the AT cut off from the road, so I said goodbye to Natalie, wished her luck, and headed for the shelter. It had been a very pleasant 2 mile walk.
Wolf met me at the shelter and informed me that we we were about to be visited by a local trail angel, Millie, who was bringing us dinner. They had met out on the trail. She came by shortly and the picnic table was covered in dishes and food platters. There was fresh salad, chicken, rice, chips, fruit, and bread. Also a few bottles of micro brewery beer. Millie's son had hiked the trail last year and this year she decided to do trail magic weekly at this shelter. She caught Craig Mains and T-Rex last week.
So it was quite a day. I have to stop going this far each day as it makes me pretty sore. That was my plan today but it just didn't work out. I'm glad it went the way it did. Tomorrow I really am cutting my miles.","Port Clinton, PA

A ways back someone told me there would be days when all that you see is your feet and the next rock. Today was like that. It was hot for hiking also with no breeze.I did make it to my shelter and am somewhat recuperated. Of all things, a person I met while cursing the trail came by the shelter to make sure I was alright. They are filling in some sections by day hiking and they gave me some info on my day tomorrow. Best advice: start early. Also it will be at least 10 degrees cooler.There is a father and daughter tenting here and they saw Wolf earlier in the day. I think he's finally going to be at least a day ahead.

Happy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611359,"So diagnosis of yesterday's issues includes inadequate calories. While the trail magic was wonderful, everyone (even me) ate politely and shared everything. I had only a reasonable rice serving. My trail dinners have been either Knorr sides or mashed potatoes that claim over 500 calories plus a full ramen. I ate the normal size trail meal last night and today felt much betterI should add that two thru hikers, Nick and Chipper, came in later last night and they were beat up by the relentless rocks too. I felt decidedly less wimpy after hearing their sobs. :)Today was better also in that there were nice sections of trail between the rocky areas. That allows me to feel like I'm getting somewhere. I did go over a section called the knifes edge. It had some hard parts but I'm learning to be comfortable with going slow and sitting down when the old butt slide is the safe option. So many things happen each day that I want to remember to record here but, when the time comes, ????.I did carry water out several miles from my intended shelter as it had a large swarm of wasps in residence.","Allentown Shelter

Happy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611470,"Out from a nice tentsite and down into Palmerton. I've got a room here at Berts for tonight and tomorrow night. There are thunderstorms forecast for tomorrow and the climb up from Lehigh Gap is exposed.
I took advantage of the break to visit the local urgent care to have them take a look at my left foot. I've had problems with it right from the start. I killed the toenail of my long toe by the second day. I killed the ring toe toenail on day 7. About day ten I stepped down hard on the outside of the foot right below the ankle. Since then, I've stepped down on it and winced several times a day. I've assumed its a bruise and I'll walk it off.
Last night, I woke up at 3 am and my foot hurt and was tender on the top by the ankle. I took some ibuprofen before hiking but the pain didn't go away. So, urgent care xrayed it and decided tendonitis. Probably from straining the foot by trying not to hit the sore spot. I got a steroid shot and assurance that, if it is tendonitis, the pain should clear up in a day or two. There was no obvious fracture but a stress fracture is possible. Hoping for the best. 
It's four hiking days to the PA/NJ line so I'll go for it when the weather clears anyway. If its not better by then, I'll switch to a firmer shoe. I have several to choose from.
Tracy, my shuttle driver was great. She drove me the ten miles to urgent care, waited two hours for me there, and then brought me back. I had fried chicken, beets, mashed potatoes with butter and gravy, and carrot salad for dinner. Tomorrow is laundry and grocery shopping. Then, assuming the best, it's back to going north.

Slowpoke went out this morning. I hope he's okay because the trail is on an exposed ridge here and there is no AT shelter for miles. I made arrangements to stay at a hostel tomorrow night that is about 11 trail miles away. That owner came by just a little while ago to introduce me to his Doberman. They are going to a Styx concert and I'm dog sitting to make sure that the dog doesn't pull a bandage from his hind leg. Work for stay, I guess. Anyhow, light rain is forecast and it will be a dry place to stay. The foot is coming along ok. It's sore when I get up and take the first steps but then is ok. I'm not leaving it behind.We made arrangements to be shuttled to the trail at 8 tomorrow so it's onward.","Berts steakhouse, Palmerton, PA

They are promised for delivery by 3 pm Monday, so the earliest I will be back on the trail will be Tuesday. The pain on my foot has not gone down so it's possible that the shoes are not going solve the problem. With all this free time, I've been studying bus schedules in case the best move is to go back home for an extended recuperation. Not the outcome I want but there is time now if I need it. I don't want to nurse a bad foot all of the way north to the White Mountains and then not be able to get through there. Better to get healed now. So I've paid for three more nights here. When the shoes arrive, I'll put them on and go for a walk. We will have to see. On a lighter note, the shoes that were sent to me in Duncannon on April 12 arrived there today. I talked to the hotel owner and they said they will mark the package ""return to sender"". It will be interesting to see where it ends up next.","Berts steakhouse, Palmerton, PA

I'm anticipating that the new shoes from home will be at the post office tomorrow afternoon and then I'll get back out on Tuesday morning.The hostel is full tonight. The area I'm in sleeps 5 and there are three more hikers in a separate garage. I'm not sure what that is like but it's nice where I am. It has been raining off and on all day and now it's forecast to be near freezing overnight. I suspect that has brought more people in than might normally come.There are two more nobo thru hikers here, orange blaze, and scalawag who said they were numbers 12 and 13 through Harper's Ferry. Also Attila (his real name) from Australia who is going south along with sharpstick.I'm glad that I downloaded the book ""The Overstory"" to my phone.

Happy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611927,"Last day off trail for a while. My shoes made it this time. Thanks, Nate. Hooray!
The foot is still a little sore but not enough to matter. They are always sore with the rocks on the trail. 
Today the hostel welcomed 22 and Tex. 22 is hiking to raise awareness for veterans with ptsd. He dedicates each 100 mile section to a different vet. Tex is younger than me by 28 days. Both are flip flopping. I may be hiking with 22 for awhile but he may end up going farther than I can in a day. Tex is taking tomorrow off.
Some 30 or so hikers left Harper's Ferry yesterday headed this way. There are more people on the trail now and it will probably stay that way on weekends until it either gets too buggy, too rainy, or too hot.
I really liked Berts and the town of Palmerton. Its funny how quickly attachments form. Tomorrow I'll get dressed, pack up, and head into the restaurant for one last breakfast of steel cut oatmeal and pork roll. Then Tracy will take 22 and me back to the trail, we will make the big climb out of Lehigh Gap and, as we hike the ridge line it will all become a memory. 
Hoping for good hiking weather tomorrow. It's a ways to the first spring and I don't want to have to carry a lot of water up the climb.","Berts steakhouse, Palmerton, PA

Happy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612003,"The big feature today happened right off the bat with the climb/rock scramble up from Lehigh Gap. It was 1000 feet up with the second half requiring the trekking poles to be put away so that I could use both hands to help me pull myself up. The first prolonged rock climbing of the trip. I think the 5 days off trail has softened me up a bit as I had a hard time getting going after the climb.
The trail was as hard as its been because of the rocks. It was a big help to have my new boots sent by Nate (thanks) but it is still slow going as I have to pick out each and every spot to set my feet down. 
I've been told that the trail gets much less rocky after 20 miles into New Jersey so I'm holding on for that. I expect to go ten miles tomorrow into WindGap, Pa and that will put me 15 miles from the border. It doesn't help to try to plan very far ahead because a lot just depends on how far the trail lets me go each day.","Berts steakhouse, Palmerton, PA

Not only is the trail a pain, the blazes are weak. Today was spent entirely on one long, rocky ridge. I'm actually getting to appreciate sections of trail where the rocks let up a little or are spaced so that I can walk on them or between them. I hit bottom at 11 am this morning. Now I'm just hanging onto the plan and hope that I can cover the remaining 15 miles tomorrow and be done with this state.I'm in a motel now and have showered and spread out on the bed.

It was only 600 ft up to the ridge and than all day was spent there with few ups and downs. Until the final one here, which was EPIC.The forecast was for rain in the afternoon and I had resigned myself to that. It was hot by recent history, and sunny. There was a nine mile stretch without water so I carried extra for that. The trail finally had long sections that were hikable so it was a good day for longer miles.Besides the salamander, I also saw a large black snake that shook its tail frantically although it had no rattle. By the time I got the camera out it had headed into the brush. Still no bear scat.I'm taking tomorrow off to do my town chores and will hike out on Saturday. I haven't gotten the knack to hike into town by 2, get the chores done, and hike back out the next morning. I think that will come with time.","Wind Gap

There were four of them here last night and two hiked out today (Tarzan and Homeschool) and two (Wrongway and GT) stayed. Wrongway is in no hurry so he'll just go 25 or so tomorrow (wince). I resprayed my hiking clothes with permetherin and have them hanging in front of a fan here to dry. The bugs are just beginning to come out. I expect that the next month as it warms will see a lot more. I especially wanted to do my socks, shoes and pantlegs as that's usually how ticks are picked up.I bought enough food for 4 hiking days. It was forecast for there to be heavy rains all day two days from now so I was planning to hike tomorrow to another hostel and stay off trail the next day. Then hike two more days to the next resupply and hostel. As the day has gone by, the forecast has steadily improved. Now I may only need three days of food but end up carrying 4.

It was sunny at times and in the 70s so hot for backpacking. Arrived at this center and bought a bed for the night and the AYCE Shish kebab dinner. It was great. There are about 25 other people here, equally divided between some teens with chaperones and AMC members who have yoga in the morning and then hikes to see wildflowers on the afternoons.There is one other thruhiker, Lightfoot, here with me. He came the same distance as I did and we may end up at the same shelter tomorrow. He's 28 days younger so I'm having a hard time keeping up:). All the younger guys from the hostel yesterday are long gone.The plan for tomorrow is to hike 15 miles to the next shelter in the rain, but be able to sleep in the shelter and stay dry.

Happy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612563,"The forecast was for rain all day. They were right. Lightfoot and I hiked out at 7am. We knew we had a long day ahead and poor weather. The trail was difficult most of the time with either large slippery slabs or rocky, wet long puddles. There was a surprise 50-60 foot straight up, but it did have good hand and foot holds. Fortunately, there were two nice long runs of about a mile each of flat forest track. Or we would still be out there.
The trail did take us by some overlooks that promised good views of the valleys and towns below but all I could see was socked in fog. Hence the one photo from inside the shelter.
I can report my first two slip and falls today. Both were while climbing up and there was no injury. I had thought about having a running gag in my journal about how many days I had gone without a fall but I was concerned about jinxing myself. So...it was 34 days.","Mohican Outdoor Center

A good day, like I said.Another nobo kid passed us. Trail name is Spartan and he is from St. Johns, MI. He was hiking in soccer shoes and expecting a package from home with new shoes at his stop tonight. These guys go 25-30 miles a day. He is trying to finish in 100 days.

It's a trail through the mountains after all. But that doesn't mean that the trail has to be constant rocks. Virginia wasn't.
In tonight at Mosey's hostel with Lightfoot and two others, Butterhead and Junebug. Mosey thruhiked the trail in 2015 after retiring from 30 plus years as a letter carrier. We went out for dinner and I pigged out a little too much. I'm sitting up now hoping the fish and chips will settle while I write this entry. 
It was a short day. I got to Highpoint state park at 11:30 and claimed my free soda. That's something I read about in one of the guides. There is a trail club that provides thruhikers with one free soda at this park. Pepsi.
Tomorrow Lightfoot and I plan to hike to Unionville, NY where he can get a package from the post office and we can camp in the town park. For the next several days the trail zigzags back and forth between NJ and NY. Then we will leave NJ for good. Oooops. Hiker midnight (9:00). Off to bed.","Mashipacong shelter

I thought that the rocks were done but we got a rude goodbye from them the first two miles. Then the trail was exceptionally muddy in spots. Then, right at the end of the day, I had to hike an extra mile to get water and then carry it a half mile up a steep hill to the shelter. I've had more difficult days but this one was tough because I expected it to be easier.
A large portion of hiking was done on boards through bogs and in bogs without boards. At precisely 1:15 pm, I stopped trying to keep my feet dry. It was too much effort to avoid the muck. 
Looking out from the shelter, I see that all of the trees have their leaves. Looks like summer is just around the corner. I wore my bug net most of the day in celebration.","Highpoint State Park, NJ
