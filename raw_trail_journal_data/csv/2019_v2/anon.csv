",Blue mt ,"Jan 03, Thu",18.80
anon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606211,"so, I get asked if I will make it all the way - from what I understand the most important factor is to be pretty - no doubt I have an excellent chance
   Sobo’s are exact opposite of Nobo, they start with the hardest in Maine and finish with easy GA - Nobo starts easy in GA / finishes tough in Maine
  obviously then, the most important thing for a sobo to reach Springer is to be ugly - it is only 2-3 days away from here so of course, at this point the sobo’s making it are quite ugly - when I encounter them I say: you are so great, let me take your picture - but the camera is on selfie mode and I am actually admiring my self, and taking a few photos- this helps to avoid looking at the hideous sobo’s.... now if I could only figure out how to avoid smelling them","Blue mt
