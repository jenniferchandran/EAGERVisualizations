Springer approach trail to stover creek shelter 11 miles 24 deg clear
1015-300
I was assigned 603 due to the number of folks leaving the amicalola state park this year to date.
Someone at the ga dept of parks must have worked out on a stairmaster...600 plus stairs to the top of the highest falls east of the Mississippi. I started with Spencer from Alberta. He just decided to do the trail 2 weeks ago. His gear was brand new. We traded places on the stairs as we had to stop to catch our breath. I've not seen him since the top of the falls but suspect well meet again. I didn't plan on doing more than 8 miles but at basecamp the ranger said if you make it to Springer early afternoon go to the next shelter 3 miles more, it's nicer.
Wildlife: 6 wild turkeys! (no not the drinking kind)
Met the following cast of characters...
- Andrew from Detroit.
-a guy from Australia who never saw snow or ice.
- an older who sleeps in a Hammock from ft Collins co.
Not everyone has a trail name. As the conductor told me on the Approach trail, about 40% do and geesh you're not even on the AT yet!
Heard gun fire and explosions last night. Didn't remember until Scottish guy said something the next day.
I must have been tired!

Stover creek to gooch gap shelters
12.9 mi 930=400
Woke up to freezing feet. I couldn't figure out why everything else warm but my feet. I put on the down booties but didn't help much. Come to find out in the a.m. bottom 6 inches of bag was unzipped from last trip! Felt like I had frostbite on my toes. Took a good mile of walking to feel them then...Got hot in the sun. Took leggings off finally and just wore kilt.
Big helicopter flew overhead. Reminded me of scene from dotd. It is ga. after all. Book says camp Merritt does army exercises around here. Machine gun and mortar noises during the night. So much for the pristine wilderness experience.
Climbed up sassafras mtn. It was a long climb. The trail so far has been pretty nice. Not many rocks here. Several stream crossings but they are manageable with stepping stones or foot bridges. Some icy spots still. As the temp rises the mud gets slick. Several near wipe outs by me and others.
Starting to see others at camp that started ahead of me.","Stover creek

Gentle on off rain turned into a downpour. So cold stopped at next shelter. Afraid I was going hypothermic so I stopped and ate at a shelter off the beaten path, .5 mile! My hands were hiker swollen so much I couldn't get my warm mittens on. After a warm meal everything was much better.
Patrick, Gunnar, and Johanna came about 1.5 hour later. Good to have the company.

Ga. rocks are as slippery as va. rocks.
Today I realized any if the fears I carried with me at the start, namely critters and injuries, have taken a back seat to leaving something critical behind or dropping something without realizing it. I've seen many things on the ground that I'm sure folks miss but no one seems to claim them. If only I had space in my bag!
Fog but no rain. Crossed over blood Mt. Highest point on AT in GA, 6th highest in the state. I was first to Neels. We had agreed on sharing a cabin so i took the lead in tracking one down. A bit pricey but everyone seemd fine with it. Shuttled all to the cabin at different times. Back on the trail in the a.m.

All the bad weather seems to be just south of us. We were close to Blairsville Ga. A few rain drops but finally the sun shone through. Met several folks from NYC, Jason, Paul, and Hillary. Also met two girls, one from VT another from PA near Philly. Must be the northeast crew. Several awesome views as the clouds and fog hung low in the valleys.
The big treat was coming into Tesnatee gap there was a bit of trail magic. Some local good samaritans led by Bob set up a great food spread with Caribbean stew, bread, brown rice, snacks of all kinds and fruit! It certainly powered the rest of my day to do the next climb and 5 miles to low gap. Where it seemed everyone was headed. 
Also met several day hikers with dogs along the way, one of which had a retriever named max.

Got my trail name today...Highlander.
I'm thinking they think I look like Jamie.
Or more likely the car.
Or perhaps it's my Scottish heritage...
Anyway, no idea why, ;) but a guy named doc gave it to me so I figured that was good enough for me.
Met 2 volunteers with us forest service. They were very nice and informative. They pointed me to a vista where i got to take s picture very similar to one my sistrr in law Ginger painted for us in the daks. 
The trail in these parts is very well maintained and I told the volunteers so. I want to give a big shout-out to the Georgia Appalachian trail club for doing such fine work. Thank you it's much appreciated!
I've been noticing shining specs when the sunlight lights up the ground in the rocks and dirt here. Mica I suspect. I'm thinking Georgia could mean shiny land.
https://photos.app.goo.gl/4k1j...Spent the night at the luxurious budget inn for $25/person. And a free 10 mile shuttle from and to the trail. A quick stop on Walgreens for essentials, then dinner at huddle hut and another stop for snacks at ingles grocery. I had been offered a twinkle by an old guy named grasshopper on the trail but I passed it up. It made me think of chocolate zingers. So Walgreens included that and cheese in light of the factory site. I are almost a whole big bag of pita chips as well and washed it all down with a protein drink. Hiker hunger has kicked in.
Note, Ga doesn't allow single bottles of beer for retail sale. Bummer.
Unfortunately a lot of this didn't equate to trail dinners. Fortunately I w as rescued in the a.m. by Bill, the keeper of the Virginia creeper trail (google it, but as he said don't leave off the word trail or you'll get something you went looking for). He runs the mountain house outlet at the motel and had exactly what I needed, veggie meals that cook in a bag. A hikers delight! He really saved the days ahead.","Tray mtn shelter

Whst does sassafras look like? And why are so many features named after it?
Learned of Matthew, who I met at my first camp, who had to bail after taking a spill on a knee on this mtn.
Longest day yet. Since I took the early shuttle and the weather was great, cool, breezy, overcast I pushed on until I got to a quiet spot. Met Alice and Mike from Chicago at the nc border. And i passed a guy trying barefoot hiking. Also passed el presidente, a former marine who worked on air force one ferrying Carter, Reagan, and Bush.
So I say goodbye for now to Ga, my first state down, 78.1 + 8 for the approach trail, makes 86 miles in 7.5 days. I made bly gap, nc at 130. Rangers said 7-8 days is averaging for AT finishers for GA.

The wind blew hard last night but I was cuddly warm in my bag. Though the creaking trees did make me wonder if there were any window makers above me.
Only 2 others in the camp area. I took my time packing up as there was a drippy rain and it was hard to get a move on. The day started with a 2.4 mi climb to the top of standing Indian mtn 5435'.
I wondered if that's still pc.
A out a mile in I stopped near the sc shelter to readjust and an older man came off the shelter trail. He said his name was pops and asked about some guys he was waiting for. I hadn't seen anyone so he took off north to find them. As I was tired already I stood in amazement as this old guy in a full pack was so fast. I couldn't catch him if I wanted to. So long pops I thought.
I only saw one other hiker today and he passed me as well.
It was a very pretty hike, in the rain, with many rhododendrons and a lichen forest! I expected the lucky charms guy to make an appearance. 
Camped in a rhododendron thicket in a light rain. It seemed fitting for the day. Broke into my 600 Cal B!g Sur bar 200 Cal/serving. 1 bar is 3 servings. Bill did not exaggerate, it is excellent!

Safe and dry inside my nylon home, tucked inside the rhododendrons, at 4300', lightning crackled a good part of the night, thunder rumbled, and the sky wept so much I doubt there's much moisture left in the clouds. Good thing nature called right before it all started.
Off to a cold rainy start, everything's wet which makes it heavier and I already have enough weight! Trudged along through the thickets and the fog.
Hiked to the top of Albert mountain 5250'. First mtn on trip with a fire tower (tagged as 100 mi on AT) and an info board. I could see what I should have seen if it were clear. The climb up to the summit was a lot like an adk peak. Not 10 minutes from the summit the sun began to poke through the clouds and the wind blew the last vestiges of rain away.
Came to rock gap and decided to call it a day to dry out everything. Ran into patrick headed to town. I'll take a Nero tomorrow ( near zero miles) to get into town tomorrow night.
A few other hikers arrived. A hiker feed was set up by some folks, including Dixie, who has hiked all 3 ld trails, AT, PCT, CDT, and blogged about them. Apparently she's famous on YouTube. Met chopsticks back at camp who thru hiked in 2017 and was out giving trail magic.

Got a room at the bidget inn here. Its a step above the last one. Run by a very nice indian family.
A quick resupply, then cleaning, lunch, and a trip to tryout the local brewpubs.
I saw an indian mound in the middle of town and reading the local paper, there's lots of American Indian activity here as it's not very far from Cherokee land.

I overheard someone say the reason the trail start was moved from oglethorpe to Springer, further north, was to avoid a pig farm. The founders wanted a better experience for trail users. Guess they didn't count on the military!
Also it was said they heard they want to move the start of the trail now to Alabama, the true start of the Appalachians. It could put a flag on everyone's current AT completion. I'm not too concerned with that. But in my opinion I'm all for it. I actually think it would be great if the trail went from the Gulf to Canada. Kinda like the PCT.","Rock gap

Happy st Patty's day! After a luxurious night at the budget inn, a step above the last one I took the free shuttle to a pancake breakfast at the Baptist church in Franklin nc. Last year they serviced over 1000 hikers in the one month daily pancake breakfast. It was quite the treat. I had breakfast with drover, pops, applestacker, and met stacy and Ryan. The last two live in leesburg about 2 blocks from me. What are the chances.
Headed out early for a short hike today but a big 1500' climb right off the bat. Rode in the van with all the old trail guys to he trailhead. Decided to keep moving as the back was better, the sky was deep blue, and the air had a cool bite. Had a beautiful view over mucho montairos(?). Was able to spot mt Albert firetower in the distance (take that glasses!)
Had a lovely conversation about life, our adventure, and all things humanity with pop over dinner. Lucky to have the opportunity.

As for my back, one little aleve... ok maybe 2 or 3. Seem to doing much better today and pushed on 3 more miles than planned. Does anyone remember doans pills? I remember the ads from TV way back when. What a good ad campaign that must have been for me to remember. Do they still make them? Who was doan?

I came to know Tippy a little over a year ago and we've formed a bond only a man and his pack can have. (Hey Tom Hanks had Wilson;) She's become very reliable and holds a lot of weight for me. And she hugs me tightly to help carry the load. But she has this awkward habit of teetering whenever I set her down. At first I would rush to grab her from falling but now I see it's a game for her so unless she's going to fall off the mountain or into traffic I let gravity take over and see where she lays and that it's ok. You'll see tippy in many photos often in repose.
On today's long hike I ran into some trail magic at a gap when a kind stranger was repaying the help he received by offering monster muffins. I dubbed him the muffin man. He, and I, and west town(from london) spent time together on wesser bald tower. I even had a second one. Must be 700 cal in one of those things! I called that lunch. It was a chilly start at 25 deg and didn't feel like it warmed much throughout the day. But it was sunny and the trail was good so it was a fine day.
Trailnames I've come across today,
Recon, moving fast long distance
Needles, cause of her sewing Gatorade, long story, let's just say he used a bottle for nature's call and something funny happened
Brooklyn smores 
Pringles
Everything seems to have it's own terminology and long distance hiking is no different. Here's what I've picked up so far.
Trail terms
Trail magic, an unexpected gift could be food, a ride, etc.
Hiker feed, a gathering to feed many people
Noc, natahala outdoor center
Pole work, my own creation to describe working with your poles
Pud, pointless ups and downs
Yogi, getting day hikers to feed you from their picnic
Stealth camping, camping outside of designated places, like say, a fire road ;)

Who's there? (For those that like a long story read on, otherwise skip to the last paragraph)
Early up to get to the big breakfast at the Noc. I'm thinking French toast with fruit and yogurt and a bagel and...after the mile walk in I run into the muffin man who brings me down to earth when he tells me the restaurant everyone raves about opens at 1100. Its now 830. But the general store is open and the sign says coffee and such. I end up with cider, muffin in a cup, and a hostess Danish. Oh well. At least the outdoor store opens at 900 so I pick up dinner and snacks and head high.
5 hours later, 8 miles up. But its gorgeous weather. And with no leaves on the trees you can see for miles. Standing Indian mtn really has stood out since I was on it in the rain. The trail in nc is a good track. But ran into some blow downs, many on cheoah mtn. 5062'. The rhododendrons on the north side of the mountain were so thick they made me think I had lost the trail. Truly what the founders were thinking of a true wilderness experience. There have been a few rocky and rooty parts as well but nothing much. Good primer for what's to come.
Locust grove gap is where I expected to spend the night but the site didn't look great and the road crossing was only 3 more miles and since it was only 400 pm... But i don't see the water sign when I get there. There a couple of picnic tables, a 1000' drop down a ravine, and a no camping sign. Aargh. A couple of locals are hanging out talking by their cars. As they make to leave, I ask do you know where the water is? They say no but we have a gallon we bought to put in someone's car radiator but they didn't need it. Its unopened. You can have it. Trail magic :)
I notice a road closed sign on an old fs road. I walk around a bend and find a flat) spot away from the road. They say don't camp by the road so the bad guys can't jack you up. I figure this is good and hidden and fine since the weather is nice. My backup plan was to go the local hostel for $25 but this seemed more risky.
Whos there...So I'm making dinner and a gentleman comes walking down the road. ""Making dinner"" he asked. I size him up to see if he's local law. Nope. He's Lonnie that runs the local hostel searching for morels. He used to work for the railroad. Spent a bunch of time in Manassas and Richmond. Super nice guy. Figured since the weather was good no one would be staying with him. I offer to refer him to friends coming up behind me and off he goes. A good way to end a long day.

Spring is around the corner. As chilly as it is at night I see it poking out every once in a while be it a small group of wild flowers starting to grow strong in a sunny spot or the chirping of jincos who bounce along on the trail in front of me. I remember these birds from Grammy's feeder. I suspect she sent them to help lead the way. And today I saw my first robin.
With the clear weather over the last few days I've seen some amazing scenery that normally is covered by leaves. This morning I saw a picture perfect sunrise. And while a good bit of the trail meanders with the contours of the land their have been some sheer dropoffs and some ridgelines that rival other more well known areas I've hiked in. Amazing stuff.
Started quickly going up to Jacob's ladder then a relentless climb to the top. Met 49er and had a nice chat until we came to road crossing with a hiker feed. Bananas, cookies, and chips, just in time for lunch. Drover and pops caught me here. I continued on but the miles were taking their toll and I was dragging. Eventually the three of us finished at Fontana. I found a concrete tent pad site and setup as best I could rather than in the large shelter, known as the Fontana hilton. The area has real bathrooms and showers courtesy of the tva. Tomorrow's weather looks like rain so I'll take my first zero day at Fontana lodge, resupply, and rest up for the big push through gsmnp, 68 miles.

First zero day! And happy first day of spring! After 175 miles of walking and tenting at the dam last night, I splurged and got a really nice room at the Fontana lodge. (Tent site neighbors GOAT (Kevin) and Sunkist (MJ) also have a journal.) I'm ahead of the real surge of hikers and pre season for vacationers so not everything is open in the mountains but enough to service hungry hikers.
The title of the todays post is a bit misleading because of course between laundry, cleaning oneself and gear, restocking for the big 75 mile push through gsmnp, and repacking knowing there's weather ahead, there is more than enough to do. But for the moment I'm enjoying lunch, talking with Dee as her only current customer listening to bruno mars with clean hands and silverware! Dee says yesterday was jam packed here so its hit or miss right now. Please sign her guest book if you're in the area. A big shout out to the staff here at the lodge, service is top notch!
Tomorrow gsmnp has special significance for me. My friend Bill Hatzer and I did a traverse of the park many years ago. Bill and I went on several winter camping trips together back in the day. Last time i saw him a few years ago now we discussed going on another. This section will be in his honor as he passed way too young from heart failure. For those of you that knew Bill please join me in honoring his presence in our lives.

At breakfast at the lodge I ran into the other highlander I've been hearing about. He's from Houston and looks a lot like Sean Connery. So much so I expected him to make a crack about tribecks mother :)  We laughed about our names and took a pic together, brothers in name for this adventure.
Long climbs. Went farther than I thought I would. Cold wind but missed the worst of it by zeroing. Only my second night in a shelter since its required here. Really have to get used to a different way of unpacking, sleeping and packing again. And I was just getting the hang of the tenting life!
Met Sparta, from spartansburg, and otis, who smokes...alot.
I thought of the title of today's post by the police, when I saw hikers in front of me moving uphill. Everyone had that Neil Armstrong walk about them slinging one foot in front of the other with their so big packs.

So cold at camp trying to make something hot and get used to communal living. But everyone went about their tasks trying not to be in each others way. It made me think of how hiking would have been in the 60's from all the pictures I've seen hence the sonny bono title, though I'm sure their gear was much heavier and there was lots more grass.
Made good time today considering all the climbs. I remember the outfitter in Franklin who said, ""once you get up high the smokies are just a ridge walk"", and I curse him on every climb. 
On the eastern slopes, protected from the wind, it was warm enough that I saw ground flies.
Papers, where r your papers.. I met David, a ridge runner, employed by the ATC, and he checked my permit, and that of other hikers. In gsmnp you need a permit to camp. Those who don't through hike need reservations at the shelters.
In one of my pics you see a snowy slope behind 2 guys. It didn't occur to me then but as I moved north every northern slope had snow, ice, slick mud or some combination. I fell once in some mud when I was distracted by a sign. I saw several skid marks from drover and pops who I caught up to. They also had spills.
Big miles today to give us a jump on getting over clingmans dome, the highest point on the AT 6658' before bad weather expected on monday. Expect to use yaktracks on the northern slope.
The shelter tonight is crowded so the AT ridge runner allowed tent camping. So much more comfortable and private. Two of us took advantage. Also I got a bonus of avocado oil for my pasta from another camper and pumped water from andre who's in the military stationed nearby and just out for a few days. Nice people all around.
Note this shelter is on the nc/Tenn border. You get your water from the nc side, the toilet area is on the Tenn side. I wonder if the folks in Tenn know that!

 Had beautiful views of cloudless skies from the top of clingmans. Bill must be watching out for me.
On the way down I used my yak tracks finally. I think I've used almost everything I've brought so the weight has been worthwhile. I think. 
The faux ridge walk continued with more MTNS to climb. At newfound gap the zoo from Gatlinburg was en mass at the parking area. And being a sunday we had a hiker feed! I ate 3 oranges and many more treats. It was so needed. Truly trail angels!
The long uphill from the gap was made more difficult by all the day hikers and the ice but we made the shelter, all of us exhausted.
Met near miss, from Ireland, and some section hikers, including Jake. From DC, and his son jake.

Lots of ups and downs never going below 5000'. The woods remind me of the north, adks, and Bavaria. The scent of pine permeates the forest. On the way up clingmans saw my first blocks of quartz. 
Came to the shelter just as the sky opened up. Lots of rain forecast for the rest of the day so I'm going to stay put and try and put on a big day tomorrow.
Yesterday I watched pops give a group of young springbreakers a talk on the AT. It happened generically as he spoke they gathered and sat to listen. He is truly the embodiment of the trail come alive. We also were a bit of a sideshow as day hikers travelled around the shelter and had so many questions like I did a few weeks ago now.
This truly is a small community.

I was going to title this entry gorilla in the mist but since I walked all day in the mist and didn't see a soul let alone any gorillas I went with the inscription above the galley door at the hostel.
Really a misty cloudy day, dare I say smoky, for my last day in gsmnp and longest to date mileage wise hiking.
After waking in the crowded leaky shelter to find a fine layer of snow I headed out early than usual noting we were still at 5895' and had to go around mt guyot at 6302'. As well as several other climbs to do the big descent to Davenport gap. 
I wore out my yak tracks but made good time and felt strong. I was thinking pops and drover had pushed on and were well ahead of us, but at the hostel badger told me they stopped at an earlier shelter because of the rain.
So 4 days to get through the smokies was a lot better than I anticipated. Thanks Bill :)
Diesel and upstate and apple stacker came in later. I ate too much at the hostel and need to walk it off tomorrow. I've not stayed at a hostel before so chalk up a new experience. It's like it's own little town, with a store, galley, laundry, short order cook, etc. And this one has a lot if notoriety on the trail. Could be the laid back vibe, or the beer and wine license. And entertainment as I watched a lady about my age, who had a little too much, take a long handle ax to a piece of firewood. Kids these days.
The place is managed by a crusty old guy who chain smokes. After showing me around he gave me a piece of paper with my traillname and told me to write down all my purchases and we'd settle up later. Very trustworthy of them. Later, after one of the younger guys burned his pizza he gave him another, no charge. Crusty, but a caring heart.
It was a bit crowded, overflow room filled with mattresses on the floor so I opted to tent with a few others by the stream. Which lulled me to sleep, exhausted after another tiring day in the woods and loving it.

Good trail. Steep right off the bat. Took my time as I resupplied at dancing bear for the next 3 day walk to hot springs nc. 
The trail here seems a bit more forgiving than in gsmnp in terms of young tree roots. I can't begin to tell you how many times in gsmnp I would be chugging along when all of a sudden the basket on my trekking poles would get caught on a young root and it would yank my arm backward as momentum carried me forward. Yikes that hurts (and super annoying after the umpteenth time).
And spring in the valley. Redbud are blooming and wildflowers are poking out.
2 big climbs for the day but the payoff was spectacular. A beautiful bald, nice and grassy, thin wisps of clouds, a small gathering of tents at the top but plenty of room. Good time to dry everything out from the damp morning dew. It seems so familiar I'm sure I've been here before but never camped. 
There's a parking lot not far from the top so a lot of folks are drawn to it for sunset. There's even a couple in wedding garb with a photographer. 
Met John, 20 year old from Nashville on spring break from Boston. He headed to max patch bald as well. 
Beautiful picture perfect sunset, at 4629', from the warmth of my sleeping bag! There's still patches of snow on the eastern slope.
And, in the middle of the night nature call, amazing stars so close you could almost touch them. And the valley all aglow with the light from a thousand homes.

Took my time leaving max patch. Only one other camper still around. Good and chilly at this elevation in the morning.
Alot of down then a few short climbs. Not many camping options in this section so pushed on to deer park. 
It's getting alot warmer now, especially sleeping at lower elevation. The afternoon sun is hot so sunscreen and drinking lots of water during the day. Small flowers are really blooming in small patches. I was treated to a fly by of the prettiest, tiniest violet colored butterfly, then later on, an orange one. Butterflies are the best!
I also saw my first rope snake of the trip. You know, when your walking fast and you look down and jump because you think there's a snake in front of you then realize its someone's discarded bit of rope.. whew. The real ones will come soon enough.
Caught up to apple stacker and we ended up camping near the water source at the shelter stop rather than the high ground of the shelter. Plus were closer to the trail.

Today's title is not only one of my favorite Simon and Garfunkel songs but also the sound, or lack thereof, in the woods tonight. I'm truly amazed everytime I experience it in the woods for it is the only place I've ever heard it. 
Not a wisp of wind, not a bird chirp, not a twig snap, no babbling brook, no noise from other campers, no tent flapping in the breeze, no airplanes, nothing...only the silence...and I'm amazed and relish it while it lasts. For in the distance the sound of a train whistle briefly punctuates it, reminding me to cherish these moments. It's part of the reason I enjoy the woods, the escape from the constant noise we live in.
Short day today to get to town and resupply. Will take a zero tomorrow.

I was surprised to see the two graves not 50 yards from where i camped. Remote like the ones in Shenandoah. ""Absent but not dead"", indeed.
Im staying at elmers sunnybank inn. Elmer still runs the place. Its another landmark on the trail, as earl schaffer visited here in 1948.
My friends in patc and Sierra club should note the fine signage on the streets and the monuments erected along the route ive seen so far. I dont recall seeing this in our area but I'll keep my eyes peeled when I'm through our region.
Lastly, the french broad river flows through the town. The river actually flows north into the Tennessee. But do its waters end up in the Atlantic or the Gulf (via the Mississippi)?

Nice town. Friendly people. Bluff mtn outfitters has great stuff. Bought a rain skirt to keep the kilt dry. Elmers is well wirth the stay with breakfast and dinner extra but well worth it. Elmer is vegetarian since 1970.
At the visitors center a display of drovers moving livestock through the area surprised me as I thought drover an Australian term. I'll have trail drover be sure to see it!
The best of this day was visiting with my friends Julie and her husband Raja from Charlotte. They brought an awesome lunch of fish, rice,and salad. We picnicked by the French Broad River, 3rd oldest river in the world, so they say, behind the New then the Nile. We visited some shops and went on a short hike to Lovers Leap and got a taste of the AT. They even got to meet fellow through hikers Irish and Pops. It was great to spend time with them. They even put up with all my trail stories. ;) Trail magic at its best! Thank you Julie and Raja!!

Left the comfort of Elmer's after a good breakfast to a light rain. The weight of the pack was heavy with resupply. 
They'll be building a new bridge soon over the French broad river and a new pizza restaurant is being built in town. Hot springs saw 50,000 visitors last year. Now if they could only get their laundromat working.
After the first steep ascent which I had practice on yesterday with julie and raja, the rain stopped, but an intermittent snow/sleet fell. Enough to coat the trees at higher elevation. I did get to test out my new rain skirt too!
At Rich mtn I took the side trail .15 to see the new fire tower. Though it was foggy I thought I'd climb it. The metal stairs seemed a bit slick with snow but when I got near the end ice covered the steps so i carefully descended. I met tortoise back at the AT and in a few more minutes of hiking the sun poked out of the clouds.
It was accompanied by a bitter wind. 
The shelter at 11 mi from town at 300 pm already had 3 folks and was an older single level design. I would have tented but the wind on the ridge was not selling it. So I moved on from 3500' to 2700', 3 more miles, closer to the road and in a gap that was warmer. The only problem was the water supply was weak but I got by.

At my campsite, I cooked dinner on a rock which pointed me to a store that had the best vegetarian food you can imagine.
The trip up camp creek bald was a breeze, not too steep, not at all rocky, and very pleasant weather. There was a book reading of lord of the rings for entertainment as well.
At the top, it was balmy, and you could pick kiwis from the trees!
But wait a minute, the best part is the fire tower on top. The bakery,in the tower bakes all kinds of goodies, but earlier they had an explosion and confectionary sugar coated some of the mountain. You could still hear the crack of the embers from the incident.
The trail from there is known as candy cane lane, where the trees grow in swirls, and the branches are coated in icicles. You could just lick them. So refreshing!
Afterwards I dared to traverse the high ridge route, but that was only because I had wolverine, aka Hugh Jackman, as my guide. We paused at Howard's rock, and we were impressed a team of men moved the massive rock in place.
The way north from the end of the ridge was blocked by a mountain known as Big Butt. You could avoid the rocky bits by taking the bypass, but I went straight up. =0 A doctor should really visit this area (or a really good forester.) 
There is a single headstone on the approach to the mountain and it made me wonder what this person did in life to be buried on Big Butt Mtn.
At the end of the day I bedded down in a quiet field beside 3 others that didn't stir once.

Fifty eight years ago, on this date, on Easter sunday, a woman gave birth to a 10 lb. baby boy. He was her 6th pregnancy, though this last would be the 5th to see life. 
She was a first generation Italian American, growing up in nyc, the youngest in a large family. There were many stories from those days, including the time she had hot water from dinner spilled on her that left a scar on her leg, and the time she hid a potato behind the chair to see if her sister cleaned (she did not).
She raised her children in the Italian Roman Catholic way, sending them all to parochial school through high school. They all grew to be fine adults and good people. Life for the mother was not easy. She had many a heart break and fought ill health in midlife finally succumbing at a much too early age, especially for this last child. 
But while he knew her he remembers...her endless gardening in her beautiful yard; countless games of checkers in her room, (sometimes with prizes!); and watching Alfred Hitchcock presents after the 1000 news, where her favorite segment was Rona Barrett; the big pots of spaghetti sauce she would make on Sundays in the big white and red iron pot; the trips to the grocery store where she would meet friends and talk for what seemed like hours; breakfast and lunches with Madeleine, her friend and confidant; spring cleaning; visits with her sister Mamie just up the road; vacations to the shore; trips to go skiing, with hot bullion, and her saying ""you'll ski like Jean claude Kiley one day""(I cannot); and ice skating on round pond, and so many other good memories. 
Thanks Mom (and Dad ;). I hope I've done you proud.

I got an early start today. Not sure why but everything just seemed to flow in the a.m. Good thing too, as this turned out to be my highest mileage and longest day on the trail yet.
After a couple of short ups we descended to Sam's gap, where I26 crosses the trail. A sign at the state line cemetery road offered trail magic up a short-ish hill. There, a small group of us, were treated by Paul, thru hiked in 2007, who cooked eggs and hashbrowns on his Coleman stove. Drinks and cookies too! I declined the eggs and paul told me later, he detests them as well and has a hard time cooking them.
Now on a full belly we climbed for 2.5 hours to the top of big bald mtn. 5309'. The climb was a bit grueling as there were several areas of slick mud. The unobstructed views made it all worthwhile.
Exhausted, I rested next to tippy, who didn't seem all that tired (go figure). I celebrated with a package of honey buns I picked up the day before at the laurel hostel. Best $2 I spent yet. I noticed on the package serving size is broken down in half a bun, and a full bun. As this was a celebration I consumed the whole thing and licked the wrapping of glaze. Who could eat only half a one anyway. The perfect treat!
The next shelter was in pretty bad shape, folks had left their garbage and things looked asunder. I guess that's what happens when you can drive (4wd) to the top of the mountain.
I pressed on and found that I could make the next shelter, with the funny name, before dinner so I put it in overdrive for the last 5 miles, made camp in record time, ate dinner, and cleaned up in less than 1.5 hours.
Again incredible weather, nice and cool for hiking. I'm sure this isn't going to last but I'm enjoying it while it is.

The Nolichucky river flows through this valley. Our shuttle driver said it means thr river of death. Erwin has a nuclear training site and the national storytelling center. I can imagine what stories are popular.
The hostel provides transportation via an old van to lunch in Erwin TN, at a pizza shop with an all you can eat pizza bar. The side salad and spinach didn't help my overeating.

I started out the day at the tail end of a downpour. Wearing rain gear with the extra weight from resupply made for a sweaty start. But the rain stopped soon enough, so the rest of the day was just overcast which was fine for me. All totalled, it was about 3500' of elevation gain to Unaka mtn.
On the way crossed a creek over 4 small wood bridges, past beauty spot, and the bald prior to the main event. 
Unaka mtn is topped by a dense spruce forest. It felt like the adirondacks, with wet tree roots and soft moss everywhere. You know, Keebler elf country. 
It had shades of green that you don't typically see. It reminded me of my friend Todd's trip to central America where he described that area as every shade of green imaginable.
Though this was kind of like when you were a child and you got that big box of crayolas and marvelled at the selection of the various shades of primary colors.

I was going to get one but chickened out.

A couple of meds, for swelling and infection, appear to be doing the trick.

Highlander,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610768,"Started out with a full belly from town breakfast and Tom Petty's tune seemed perfect on the drive. But maybe i was too full. I was dropped of by the family at the elk garden trailhead in a light snow. What was rain the day before in the valley turned into a light dusting and frozen branches at altitude. And all I could think of, I had landed in the kingdom of the north, headed to Winterfell.
The wind was blustery but I could see the sun in the valley. And it finally poked through the clouds early afternoon. Quite a few day hikers on the trails and some thru hikers got off trail due to alot of intersections and pony trails.
This area maintains wild ponies to keep the vegetation down. I was beginning to think I wouldn't see any but found a few grazing lower down as I approached the scales area.
Lots of campers at the shelter area. Families with teens and some thru hikers. Heard stories of last night, snow blowing into the shelter, ponies coming up to the shelter, takitaking someone's boots but they were too frozen to eat, and biting cold in the a.m.
I'm still experiencing some leg pain but the swelling is down. We'll see how it feels in the a.m.

I passed some very pretty waterfalls. The snow/rain has made all the springs gushers but thankfully the trail has dried up. 
The shelter, a very pretty stone structure, was shared by myself and karaoke. I saw a good size black mouse scoot up the wall right before it got dark but there were no incidents during the night.
I had some chance encounters that made many bright spots in the day as well.

Highlander,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610770,"After waking at 700 am by the bright sun shining into the shelter, I slowly started packing and making breakfast.
I left camp wincing with each step for about an hour. Then, miraculously, the pain in the right leg went away, and for about 20 minutes, I was pain free. Then my left quad, apparently sensing the extra effort I had been putting it thru for 3 days, spasmed. Ouch.
This slowed my pace considerably. When I got to va. a few days ago I thought I'd pick up some speed but it's not working out that way. By the afternoon, after climbing 2 signal knobs (mountains back home that are rocky) I was setting a record pace of 1.5 mph. Downhill was the worst. I began to envision crawling to Maine, but decided I'd probably end up looking like the bike rider in the walking dead by the time, er if, I got there.
I stopped for awhile at the us forest service visitor center, about 10.5 miles from camp. They have a shelter there with a shower, though I didn't use it. They also have a phone where you can order pizza from the town of marion or get a lift into town about 10 min away.
I did neither, but rested for a bit, and ate my food, food from vending, and drank a Gatorade. I can't remember the last time I had one of those. None of it seemed to make a dent but I pushed on and hoped for the best.
I saw the purple people and found out Jillian had broken a toe a few days ago. But they are troopers and continued their quest.
Saw bedpan at the us forest service visitor center. He was dealing with red roof inn in marion from a bed bug infestation he got when he stayed there for 3 days.
It's interesting but the slow pace, warm weather, and va. trails have brought a certain calm. I am so thankful for this experience still and that I've got the fortitude to carry on. I no longer feel in a rush. Folks I've met in the past few days have this same aura I sense.

I started under graying skies which soon enough turned into a drizzle and lasted all day. Soon enough I passed the signpost signifying I had now completed a quarter of the trail. There's even a hostel by that name. 
With the rain from yesterday and today streams were up and everything is soaked in the forest. The temps are cool which make it great for hiking too. 
I saw a pileated woodpecker but wasn't fast enough to get a picture. It was a really big one though.
There was one tricky spot, in addirion to the fence barricades that had to be navigated. It was a fairly innocuous looking field with posts to mark the way. At a uturn, there wasn't a double blaze indicating a turn. Further downslope there was a post with a blaze but as I got closer realized the blaze was yellow. Someone had written on it ""wrong way"". Soon enough i figured out the correct direction and continued on.

Doc knob has one of the best shelters, due to the porch and adk chairs and a good water supply. I pressed on to stop, tired, at a spring with several others.
Today I also met the fourth man to tell me he is section hiking since having to abandon his thru hike in previous years.

Like yesterday and the day before we have 2 big mountains and many miles for today. The first mountain was alot like the ridges in fort valley back home, rocky and weaving over the top.
The second mountain led to the memorial for Audie Murphy, who died in a plane crash on brushy mountain. The trail was fitting a memorial, long, steep, but very smooth. Coincidentally I'm reading the book 1942 so WWII has been on my mind.

Highlander,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612482,"I'm looking for information on the survey work of James F O'Connor, nickname Buck, and was with Geological surveys in the 1930's.
He was born and grew up near and in Lexington,Va. and is now deceased.
There may be a plaque or marker with this name and others on the survey crew somewhere on the AT.
Photos of the crew and telegrams can be viewed here:
https://photos.app.goo.gl/k6R5...
In the photo marked ""Nat. Geo. Survey"" Buck is the first man on the left.
If you know anyone in the photos please do let me know.
Note, I am currently nobo on the AT in Virginia and would like to find the plaque.
He was born in 1917 and I know his work was before he married in 1940.
His daughter says,
""I  was told he surveyed the AT from Fort Oglethorpe,Ga. to Mount Katahdin Maine. As a child that’s about all I remember and his life went in an entirely different direction after my parents married.""
Natl. Geo. Survey refers to National Geodetic Survey, we believe.  Here is a little bit of history from their website https://www.history.noaa.gov/s... that may pertain to their work. See Great Depression Surveys section.

Highlander,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612847,"Today's title will remind all Catholics of the lead in to penance. I found it fitting, for this morning I woke atop The priest mountain, at my solo camping spot. To my surprise, at the Rocky overlook was bearbait, come up from the shelter area below.
We had breakfast together on the overlook where she told me tradition dictates that you leave your trail sins in the register of this shelter.
Trails sins, can include such heinous acts as not digging your cathole the full 6 inches, slack packing , especially the opposite direction to avoid an uphill, exiting then entering the trail at a different place, leaving a trace, and sleeping with your food.
As penance, you are directed to climb the three ridges, full of rocks, steep sections, false summits, and no views on top. You'll also have to carry an extremely wet tent for extra weight.
If you are successful, or not, you can get communion at the devils backbone brewery. Free shuttles at reeds gap.

I remember one instance, when I was probably 5 or 6 years old, while we were riding on the car my mother's red kerchief flew our the window. My dad pulled the car over and walked down the street to get it. How chivalrous of him I came to think years later. I know my mom appreciated it.
On the hike today I passed a group of men who looked as if they just stepped away from their, aka not hikers. The first said, ""are you a thru hiker"". I said yes. Then he asked where I was headed. Without missing a step I said ""maine"". But it was the last guy i passed that caught me off guard and asked ""how many hours is that"". How many indeed.

It's like when someone is truly impressed with what we are doing, it lifts your spirits and gives you a boost, putting a spring in your step. It can be random day hikers (thanks random guy for the fist pump) or encouraging words in your guest book, or even a trail occurrence. Hikers take this and it gives them energy (not unlike dementors in harry potter.)
Today I had such an experience. It was at the beginning of a rain storm, I was fully decked out in my rain gear and as I walked I noticed a fawn on the trail ahead. It started to dart away but stopped. I froze in my tracks, thinking I should get my camera. But something told me to not move. 
Slowly the young fawn approached me and stopped about 8 feet away. It sniffed the air like a dog would do and looked me over. I was amazed. It didn't seem to be afraid but very curious as to what this smelly, funny looking creature was. We looked each other over for a minute or two, just the fawn and me, alone in the woods.
Then it ambled up the trail and stopped at the edge of the woods. I moved closer and it took off, slowly at first, then bounded away.
That was an encounter I'm not likely to ever forget. And gave me the boost I needed for this day.

Highlander,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616663,"On this father's day I think about my dad and being a dad myself. 
My dad, the son of immigrants, served in the marines in wwII in the pacific, earning the purple heart. After the war, he became a successful attorney, D.A., and state supreme court justice in NY. Along the way he raised a family of 5 children. To say he had little patience would be an understatement. He so loved the holidays, especially if you include his frequent use of the refrain ""Jesus Christmas."" 
He left home for many reasons when I was young, but I connected with him later in life. I don't fault him for his choices but miss the opportunities his leaving lost for us.
Which brings me to my fatherhood. I became a father in my thirties. I remember his birth like it was yesterday. I do recall many fun adventures with my son and look for many more to come. 
I'd also like to think I didn't inherit my father's impatience but I'm sure others wouldn't agree, favorite expressions notwithstanding. I don't think I've done bad job in parenting especially when you see the good man he's become. 
He is also an artist. Shameless plug...Check him out at http://www.danieltorraca.com

Highlander,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617544,"A few days ago 2 fawns ran across the trail 3 feet from me, followed by a large doe, barking. I thought that was pretty cool. Mostly I've felt like Marlin Perkins, safe inside the studio. But this morning I got to experience wild nature, more like Jim Fowler out in the field, a bit too close for comfort.
The night before I rolled into the shelter area at dusk. I set my tent up in a flat, grassy area near the shelter. I could see 4 other tents on the hill in the woods. The door of my tent faced them, uphill, away from the path. (This ended up being important).
In the morning, as I got organized inside my tent, i heard Leaf call out from the shelter, ""bear coming down the path, going to the fire ring after some trash"". I thought I'm glad I'm not near the fire ring, but then i couldn't see anything because of the door direction.
Then he called out, ""highlander, are you up""?. I answered i was and quickly got out of tent to see what was going on. 
Wasn't I surprised to see a 300-400lb black bear 10 feet away picking a plastic bag out of the fire ring then sitting down to chew it. I was in awe if its size and composure. I took a picture. So did others. But then it was done eating the bag and started looking for something else.
A general calamity soon followed. Two tenters were eating oatmeal. One put his bowl in the shelter. We all yelled, go away bear. One guy had an air horn. Nothing seemed to faze the thing. It meandered from the shelter to everyone's tent. It bluff charged me but I stood my ground near my tent. 
It took a taste of my tent then mosied up the hill. (Must be permethrin deters bears and ticks). It totally ignored my bear can, 10 feet away.
While it was busy checking others out, including the inside of the shelter, I stuffed by pack, collapsed my tent, stuffed it in a plastic bag, and walked quickly up the trail. Once out of danger, I repacked everything.
Later on, I found out the next shelter north, had a bear warning in the guide but also had bear boxes. A camper there said one of the boxes was filled with trash. Apparently this bear roams between the 2 shelters.
There's a message in all of this; always pack out what you pack in, don't leave trash in the fire pit, and don't camp near the fire pit! Nature, up close can be fairly intimidating.

Try not to slip. Use the entire footprint of the shoe to make contact with the rock (cof). Try to avoid wet and mud. Shift your weight forward or back to avoid falling, sometimes a 10-20'drop. Use handholds when possible, including roots, rock edges, and trees. 
Plant your poles and lift or push the weight of yourself up. Use the poles to slow descent to save your knees. If you don't like heights, don't look over the edge of the trail. Get low when possible to shift your weight and make yourself closer to the ground. 
Repeat the above with each step. When you can do it without thinking too much about it, now you're hiking in the White's.

Our shuttle driver, Greg, reminded us this is the section of trail the woman got lost and died. It was 2 years before they found her body. Good idea to keep sure we're on the trail!
We passed the 200 mile mark at the ccc plaque. I celebrated with the last of the hummus and pita bread we had brought.
Mostly due to our late start we finished near dark. As we drove through Stratton we tried to stop for something to drink as we were both dehydrated, even though we had filtered water on the hike.
The local Citgo market closed, as we pulled in. Fortunately, one of the small restaurants gave us a drink and let us know the hotel had a bar that served food. So we headed there and had a late meal at the Stratton inn.

Most of us stopped at Harrison's, nearby, for a dozen blueberry pancake breakfast for 9.00! I'm really liking pancakes these days! Tim, the cook, even played piano for us in the 1930's era hunting camp. It will always be remembered as a special meal.
Then it was onto the Kennebec river crossing by canoe, the official AT route. There's no charge for this service but it only operates from 900-200 this time of year. The crossing appeared calm and took only a few minutes but as our captain explained, we have hiker legs, not sea legs, and are prone to fall over. (He doesn't know the half of it!) So after donning our life vest, we loaded our packs and ourselves and made the crossing in turn.
Note, there's a dam release upstream that drowned someone attempting a crossing last year. And yesterday a young hiker inflated his air mattress and used it to float across. He lost his hat in the process, but the captain generously looked and found it today.
Once safely across the water we headed to the caratunk inn for their famous milkshakes (lactose free for me).

The day is a beautiful sunny day with cool temps which promises to turn out alot of other hikers in the park.
Since I'm already checked in I can begin my hike ahead of the other shuttle riders and hit the trail at 7:30 a.m.
I move quickly up the trail, the effects of 5 months of daily hiking making my body move faster and more efficiently than most other hikers I pass.
I reach the summit in just under 3 hours and see some old friends who made it earlier. There are lots of day hikers today. As I get my picture in front of the sign someone asks if I'm a thru hiker and when I answer yes a bunch of people erupt in applause. I'm elated.
After a quick bite and some congratulations from some new friends I continue on to my next challenge, the trail called the Knifes Edge. 
I move over it, away from the crowds, navigating the narrow ridge. It's not nearly as scary as I think, reminding me of hikes I've done in the Rockies.
After the final tricky spot, a steep down climb, then up a near cliff face, I arrive at Pamola peak, the sacred mountain to the penobscot indians. The sky is starting to cloud now so I begin my descent down the steep Helon Taylor trail.

Thanks to Leif for putting up a great site and to Daniel for helping me manage the content. It allowed me to tell my story and share the experience with so many people.
To my family, Donna and Daniel, thanks for believing in me and providing the time for me to do this. I couldn't have done it without you and your support. You kept the home fires burning even when things were tough for you both and allowed me the time I so desperately needed. 
To all the known and unknown trail angels out there you should know what you do is an important part of the experience and could be the difference between success and failure for many. Thanks so much for helping me in my journey.
And a big thank you to everyone for your words of encouragement. When I was feeling defeated they went a long way to help me to push on.
