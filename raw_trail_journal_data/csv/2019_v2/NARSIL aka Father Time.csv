The weather was cool and rainy both days which is what we will all encounter during a thru hike. Planned on tenting but set up my tent inside the shelter due to the rain.The hike in was moderate and enjoyed the solitude. Started encountering issues immediately. I thought I was properly prepared..forgot my knife, spoon and puff jacket.My Thermarest pad developed a hole and wouldn't stay inflated and my steripen stopped working. (Boiled water) My gloves turned out not to be waterproof and my frogger rain pants did not perform well.All the rest of my equipment worked very well including my first hike with my new Osprey atmos 65 backpack. (Really liked that). Didn't encounter any other hikers and did sample fresh spring water with no ill effects. Took Woodys advice and hiked the Creeper trail back. Note to AT&T users no network in or directly around Damascus. I also traveled through Hot Springs and Erwin to see some of the hiker stops I have read about.Very advantageous journey on many levels.

One month from today I will be just outside Amicalola Falls State Park. I have been fortunate enough to change my lodging from the Comfort Inn to spending the night at the home of Ron Grimm aka Jerry Garcia. He and his friend Currahee began their thru hike in 2011 but were not able to finish due to injury. He has already provided some valuable data I can incorporate into my final preparations. I am set to go, no final food or equipment changes . I figure my initial pack weight at close to 40 lbs which I am used to. (Maybe cut back somehow, but I would rather sacrifice pounds for comfort) I am mapping out the first 30 days and will make necessary adjustments from there.

NARSIL aka Father Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607217,"Greetings, 
We will be leaving tomorrow morning for Springer to register my Friday start. As authors do with every book they publish, they acknowledge persons that make there work possible. Well I want to acknowledge the people making my adventure possible. First a big thank you to all my clients over past 18 years that made my business successful and afforded me the opportunity to retire and fund this hike. To family physician and friend Dr Masri who has keep me stiched together and fit all these years always making himself available. To all our family and friends supporting myself and wife over the next several months. ( Yes a few think I've lost my mind) To Westwood church and congregation here in Orlando, along with Pastor Dan who sent a prayer to Vicki and myself last Sunday for safety,  success and hopefully spread fellowship along the trail. To Debbie O'Brien at radio station 1520WBZM for hosting me in a radio interview about the trail and wanting to follow the journeys being published in trailjournals.com. Also to Ron Grimm aka Jerry Garcia for hosting us in his home tomorrow night and sending me off Friday morning. He is an AT hiker from a few years  back. His daughter Lisa will be along to assist my wife with the drive up and back to Orlando. There are many more but if you have read this far you are destined for sainthood! One last trail thought. I've read and heard allot about pack weight. I know there are many different camps out there and just like we ""hike your own hike"" we ""pack our own pack"". Well finally after many configurations mine is coming in at 37 1/2 pounds. I am 6 ft 1 and 200 pounds. I can handle they weigh because I would rather be comfortable and have ""extra"" first aid or repair items with me than not. Probably after a couple weeks I may trim it down but at 65 I can afford to cut the daily mileage if necessary to keep all the arthritic joints moving. You senior's know what I'm talking about. Finally cant say enough about my beautiful wife and partner for the last 37 years. Thank you for managing the homestead while I'm gone, tears of joy and sadness have already begun. Best of times and success to the class of 2019. See ya out there!",,Amicalola State Park,"Feb 20, Wed",0

NARSIL aka Father Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607522,"Hello from North Carolina, 
In case I haven't mentioned, I don't use the shelters I tent. Shelters to me are used as destination points. Gator and I were picked up yesterday by his wife and we stayed in a great little cabin she had booked. Everything was still wet from Friday so we were able to get everything dried out by this morning. I am doing what is called a flip/flop for the next 3days. Because of very cold weather conditions being predicted Monday and Tuesday.  The Gators drove me from Hiawassee to the NOC this morning. Its around 45 miles maybe from Dicks Creek where we finished Friday night. From there I will be hiking alone, I know right, to Fontana Dam just outside the Smoky mountains. The Gators then we pick me up at drive me back to Dicks Creek. Meaning there is a final section in Georgia Gator and I will complete back up to the NOC. Confused yet? Why you say, well Gator has already done the NOC to Fontana Dam recently so he doesn't want to do it again. I can see why, it was a really beautiful day but tough uphill hike (yea it was uphill all day....) there were lots of down trees you had to navigate as well. I passed two crews clearing the trail. So anyway when I finish we go back to the last section of Georgia and Gator and I will finish that. The she will drive (flip) us back up to Fontana Dam and we head into the Smoky mountains.  There are a bunch of other logistical things in between but between Gator his wife and her parents (who are providing some overnight accommodations) I cant thank them enough. Hiker bedtime is dark thirty which it is. I cant put into words how great this experience has been to date so i wont try! Thank you and good night. Sorry one more thing in the wilderness you don't keep you food bag in you tent, unless you want a bear visiting you in the middle of the night. So you hang them on steel cables at the shelters. Well this shelter doesn't have cables. So for the first time I had to throw my rope over a tree limb and tie my bag up about 10 feet off the ground.  I'm sure it would have been entertaining to watch me do it but hay everything out here is a learning experience!","Cabin Hiawassee GA

Since Gator had suggested yesterday that we overnight there we gladly accepted.  Only catch was they needed to start early because they were driving home today. They also said they were stopping in town for pizza...yep his van was full of hikers! We ate at the Mellow Mushroom pizza place,  yum is all I can say. Then he dropped Gator and I off at our motel and took the rest of the hikers back to Newfound Gap to continue hiking another 3 miles to the next shelter. They all were carrying leftover pizza!

The hostel was...primitive,  one small building, six bunks, hot shower, outhouse, no bedding or heat. $20 a night includes shower, no laundry facilities or resupply. Tim (the owner) did have soda, beer, microwave pizza, burgers,  ice cream and donuts for sale. Pretty dirty but it worked. Three people also tented for $10 each. Tim and his son were really nice people and very accommodating. I did get to brush up on my hillbilly lingo because family, friends or whoever kept stopping by and I was the only one who could talk huntin, fishin and the such ya know! They were all very friendly decent down to earth guys and I really enjoyed talking with them.

The hike itself wasn't all that bad but the remoteness and loneliness suddenly hit me like a brick. The miles seemed to drag on and on. To top it off I misread a blaze and ended up walking backwards for almost a half mile. I finally reached the campsite and Q, Halo and Jimmy, a really super guy providing trail magic and shuttling hikers day and night were already there. My mood was obvious and Jimmy immediately got out sodas and cookies for us which helped my funk. Halo and Q are always upbeat and positive so them just being there motivated me to set up camp and make dinner. Shortly thereafter Third Grader also showed up and we all settled in.

(I'm probably going to be packing up wet tent and gear tomorrow morning) I managed another good mileage day anyway and made over 30 miles between yesterday and today. My biggest two days to date. Unfortunately the rocky terrain got the old knees aching once again but 13 -14 hours in the tent along with plenty of Vitamin I should do the trip. I noticed plenty of hikers were heading into town or hostels tonight due to the weather, guess their only fair weather hikers, lol! Planning to continue the longer miles this week which will get me into Damascus and out of Tennessee ahead of schedule. Vicki sent a box with new boots, candy, homemade jerky and other good stuff to the post office there.

This morning was wet and foggy and discovered I still had about 1 1/2 miles to hike to summit Mt. Pond.However late morning the sun broke through and it turned into a beautiful day on the AT. Today's hike seemed mostly uphill but hey eventually you come down. I ran into or was passed by several other hikers, not to mention Gator! He was slack packing south and we met crossing Watauga dam. It was really good to see him and catch up. Kelly is up visiting so she dropped him off a couple miles up the trail. Hopefully we will continue to bump into each other. I saw several cool things today such as the immense lake at Shook Branch, a dam with an awesome view of the valley and some cool rock formations and vistas. We are currently hiking and camping in a restricted area to everyone but AT hikers. Apparently there has been issues with bears in this region for several years. Hope I'm still around for tomorrow's update, yikes! Anyway my tent is literally 5 feet off the trail and the steam everyone is getting water from is in my back yard.

The weather has also continued to cooperate with warm days and sunshine . I plan to be in Damascus Friday so my food rations are running low. You actually are doing really well if you run out of food entering a resupply stop. I think I'll plan not to run quite so low!

I need to get to the post office before 1pm (lunch) to pick up a package Vicki set me. Cant wait to chuck these high top boots for my normal low profile. Plus goodies, meds and jerky she made.

After showering I walked downtown to pick up some things from the drugstore then headed over to the outfitters. I picked up a tee shirt a the thrift shop then purchased some new socks and a pair of shorts. I weighed myself here, if the scales are accurate I've lost 30 pounds. I've noticed I am losing muscle mass everywhere so I need to somehow beef up my diet. I believe my weight to be accurate because I bought a pair of shorts size 30!

I also boxed up my cold weather gear like long underwear, gloves, long pants, knife, sleeping bag liner, rain pants (bought cheaper lighter pair), all 7 pounds worth I no longer have to carry. This is being sent home to Vicki.

It was pouring when I was ready to stop and pitch my tent so I was kind of half praying and half yelling for it to stop! This is the honest to God truth, the rain stopped and the skies cleared and the sunshine lit up the afternoon. I got my camp set up, dryed some stuff out and made dinner.

I had no cell service since yesterday morning so no idea what to expect. Oh and I had just shipped most of my cold weather gear home Saturday.

However today due to all the rain yesterday and last night much of the trail was running streams. The forecast for tonight is sub freezing so I checked my altitude and mileage guide and selected a spot between the mountains to stop. It was only 10 miles out but a safer place to pitch camp - the other choice would have put me on the peak of the mountain which will be much colder.

It just felt surreal from the time I got up till the time I tented out. I started the day climbing Mt. Roger's, the highest peak in Virginia at 5430 feet. Which also has the highest shelter,  Thomas Knob. Shortly after the shelter I crossed the 500 mile marker and finally feel like I'm making real progress. The skies were blue with a few wispy clouds and warm. Everything seemed so fresh. There were some rocky climbs but even those were picturesque. It seemed like some kind of western movie set. The views were spectacular. At one point you had to navigate ""Fatman Squeeze "", a rock tunnel. Then you found yourself in Grayson Highlands and the ponies were right on the trail. Your not supposed to touch them so I didn't. Beautiful animals. I sat and watched then for a few minutes. I think I was waiting for John Wayne to come riding into the picture! I continued on to Wise Shelter located in a very picturesque location but because it is located within Grayson Highlands you cant camp there, just shelter.  Yea right I think I saw 30 spots hikers had tented on. But rules are rules so I walked another 100 yards exiting the park and camped on a beautiful little hill, plush with grass overlooking a large stream. I set up my tent, ate dinner and just listened to the sounds of nature. Sure enough just before dark I heard a snort and spotted a deer just a few yards away checking me out. Perfect, I don't believe for a minute that this day just randomly happened. I believe God provided this day for me and everyone else visiting that area. It was nicest, most interesting day on the trail so far and really lifted my spirts! Amen","Stealth camp near VA 600, Elk Garden

The day had again been beautiful but not much in the way of scenery or anything noteworthy. Someone asked what kind of wildlife I've seen so far and other than 4 deer just birds and squirrels.

NARSIL aka Father Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611003,"This is my second day of not hiking the trail so no official miles. However all the walking we do once in town to eat, resupply, pick up mail and whatnot also adds up. I'm feeling a bit guilty about taking two days off because you lose your ""groove "" and its takes real effort to leave the comforts and get back out there. However the rain has continued all day along with cooler temperatures so it was a good choice.
I was concerned about finding a shuttle ride tomorrow morning being Easter but I have a ride scheduled for 9am. A local retired gentleman offers rides whenever he can on a donation basis every day. I can't express how grateful we are for people like him. I spoke to his wife this morning and she asked me if I wanted to ""slackpack"" tomorrow since I'm trying to rest my knee but I declined because I'm not yet interested in doing that.
Slack packing is a very popular option out here that I know many hikers are doing on a sporadic or even regular basis. What it generally means is you carry a smaller much lighter day pack and are driven a number of miles north up the trail, dropped off and hike back to the south. Generally speaking the trail is easier to hike from north to south. Once you finish that days miles,  the shuttle driver picks you back up and takes you back to your motel or hostel. This results in more town time and less living on the trail time, camping etc. You also are able to hike much longer distances. I have so far refused to do this because I'm trying to hike the ""purest "" version, which means full pack and every step is north. The only requirement for ""thru hiker"" status is finish the trail within one calendar year and pass every white blaze. The AT moto is hike your own hike, so be it.
Anyway pretty bored watching TV and reading but I hope the extra rest pays off this coming week. Next stop is the Lickskillet hostle in Bland Va a little over 70 miles away which I should reach by Thursday or Friday. Vicki is sending out a small supply package for me to pick up there.
I'm going to have my 2 microwave cheeseburgers (dollar tree) and other can of beer for dinner. Before you laugh its better than trying to cook something up on the mountain in the cold and rain!

So now I only have 4 miles to cover in the morning. I did have some pretty steep ups and downs today but again overall the trail was fairly forgiving. Meaning no big rock scrambles and mud. I passed Helveys Mill shelter on the way and after 7 miles ran right into the Brushy Mountain Outpost. It is a small supply store and more importantly a deli! I saw more hikers there than in the last few days. I had a giant bacon cheeseburger, cajun fries and a coke, OMG heaven on earth! On the way out I grabbed another Pepsi, Poweraid, chips and cherry pastry to supplement my dinner here in the wilderness. My main dish was an english muffin with peanut butter, bacon bits and the rest of my summer sausage. Yea I know if only you could eat so well! I have run into several guys I haven't seen in weeks its kinda cool to see where everyone is. 
So what I really haven't mentioned is starting last Monday my right ankle, foot and shin began to be sore and swell up. I've just been dealing with it and after 16 miles today it looked pretty bad. So I sent Vic a picture, that got the ball rolling! My wonderful brother in law Neil gave me a call (hes an MD in Michigan) and we discussed possible reasons why its swollen and because I've had no injuries it was an immediate red flag. Vicki had also contacted my local MD in Florida that's been taking care of me forever and he also agreed it's no shin splint or an ankle injury. Both concluded that I have a serious issue of some sort that needs to be seen immediately. So I will be having it treated tomorrow. Bottom line is glad I only have a 4 mile hike in the morning and the hostel owner is already prepared to get me where I need to be. The saying is on the trail ""no pain no Maine "" I guess I'm taking that to the extreme. Its really good to know I such caring family and friends looking out for me.

If this, and let's hope it is a bacterial infection it could happen to anyone. Obviously the conditions on the trail are not very hygienic so any type of sore, blister, scrape whatever can allow this to happen.  My caution to everyone is if you suffer from an unknown injury/condition get it checked as soon as you can.

Yes I asked my doctor and was told ok but take it slow. 
Yes I did hike with my own pack but not fully loaded. So I guess I experienced my first slack pack event. The hike went fine literally no foot pain the entire way. I even hiked an additional 1/2 mile back to the hostel where I will spend my last night. This place and its owner Mondo provided a place to relax and heal that has allowed my journey to continue. Thank you so much!
It's back to the trail tomorrow, I have a 7:45 shuttle scheduled. It will be slow and easy certainly until my foot has fully healed. There are plenty of places to stop if I should develop any unforeseen problems.","Lickskillet hostel

NARSIL aka Father Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612029,"Greetings from the trail! I'm back! After yesterday's 5 mile hike and the continued improvement with my foot I decided to get back to hiking.  I planned to go as little or as far as my legs would carry me and that turned out to be pretty far for me. I had a long steep hike up a hill to begin the day eventually passing Wapiti shelter. That was at the 8 mile mark and I was feeling as well as expected so I pushed on. The next shelter was at about the 18 mile range and I knew that was to far. I decided to try for Sugar Run Gap at about 15 miles and find a place to pitch camp.  Well when I got to the gap, Sugar Run road I noticed I sign for the Woods Hole hostel a half mile down the road. This hostel is one of the oldest on the trail built in 1880 so I had to check it out. The hostel is run by Neville the granddaughter of the original owners. As soon as I walked onto the property she came out to greet me. I decided to pitch my tent and pay a nominal fee which included a shower and wifi. I took part in a fabulous dinner and i imagine breakfast will be much the same. This is a very beautiful hostel/farm/organic garden etc. Very good vibs.
Oh and yes about 1 1/2 miles before arriving I encountered my first bear. I had sat down on a boulder to check my position and out of the corner of my eye I see a blackened tree stump move. (This area had a recent forest fire so the trees and stumps are all black) Holy crap that's a bear not 40 feet away! Well I got some pics and videos and moved along in case any of his buddies might be around. I guess there wasn't and it didn't seem to interested in me so here I am.
I stopped at the hostel also as a safe guard in case my foot infection reacted badly to the long hike but all seems well and the swelling continues to diminish. I'll be off again in the morning, I'm not sure how far but I feel the need to make up for lost time. It's way past hiker midnight so its lights out for me. PS my tent is very close to the goat and pot belly pig pen - I hope they are quiet sleepers.","VA 606 Suspension bridge

I started hiking at about 9:30 not counting the 1/2 mile road walk from hostel to trail. My foot was looking and feeling even better this morning and as of tonight looks very close to normal so I wont be talking about it any longer. Praise God for moving Vicki to make the call, again for giving my doctors the wisdom for making the correct diagnosis and choice of meds and of course the almighty whose hands obviously quickened my recovery. Why for a common sinner such as myself is a mystery!I could have displayed a nice vista for my picture today but instead I was told about a small overgrown cemetery just off the trail where this gentleman is buried and honored. You don't run into this kind of history very often, imagine Capt. George Pearis, born in 1746 died in 1810, a revolutionary was veteran. I was quite moved standing at his gravesite. As you might also imagine the trail today was pretty easy to navigate most of the day. Of course the normal ups and downs but no mountains or tough bolder fields. My total mileage was 17.3 but only 16.8 count. My biggest day and new two day total to date. I hope I can keep it up. My consolation was having to skip going into Pearisburg which i would have enjoyed. There wasn't to much activity on the trail today i guess I'm in between most people again. Its going to be a warm night again and it's time my sleeping bag goes home and I pick up a lightweight sleeping blanket or quilt. I haven't even looked at tomorrow's trail chart so I guess I better get at it.Thank you everyone who expressed well wishes during my infection your words motivate me as much as some claim I motivate them.

Generally speaking you don't get cell service because shelters are located in gaps (lower elevations between hills). I honestly loose track of days gone by but I remember the trail as being fairly level with the exception of the last couple miles which were steep, downhill and rocky. Water was not available for an almost 10 mile stretch and it was very warm today. I being the woodsman I am, (lol) did discover a small stream down a hillside and was able to fill up and splash some on my face and arms! I just managed to get to the shelter before the rain started but after a few minutes it stopped and I decided to pitch my tent instead. There ended up being 6-8 other hikers in camp by nightfall. It was a pretty uneventful day other than it seems just overnight the forest has gone from brown to full greenery.

A younger hiker passed me coming into camp and asked me about the rattlesnake lying next to the trail! I never saw it but sure enough he had a picture and it was huge. How I didn't see it is beyond belief. Again had the ups and downs and a really rocky/boulder stretch that are very hard on your feet and joints.

The trail wasn't bad but it really wears you out first thing in the morning.  I have been unusually tired over the last couple days which is why my milage is down. I don't think I'm getting enough calories again and I'm out of meat so the protein is down. I skipped Newport today as a resupply and will be heading into Catawba Monday. I passed an old log barn today, couple old stone chimneys and the highlight was Keffer Oak, the largest oak tree on the trail and estimated at over 300 years old. (I will add the picture to my log when the site let's me download it?) I am staying in an area that everyone says is haunted! On the ridge above the shelter there are many ""rock piles"" but obviously built by people. It is very rocky here and I believe they are Olga graves. I'm going to try and research this area. Also down here by the water supply are the remains of a large log house (three fireplaces), a smaller house, old fashioned stone well and what even looks like a earthen bathing pit. After the rain the valley is missed over and spooky looking. We were reading stories in the shelter log book about people seeing shadows walking by their tents and stuff.

The trail for the first half the day was level and smooth to hike. Passed the 700 mile mark, and then I hit the infamous Dragons Tooth monolith. OMG the formation was pretty impressive but the hike down, all I can say is it was the most difficult climb so far. Vertical rock scrambles, hand over hand, rebar steps, rock climbing that was on a scale from difficult to down right scary. All with a 30 pound pack on your back. Hope I don't see anything like that for awhile.

NARSIL aka Father Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612766,"Today began with a 20 minute drive to the nearby Walmart to resupply. Once back to the hostel I needed to ""repackage"" everything. You don't carry much of anything in its store bought packaging because it creates too much trash. For example I open two instant oat meal packages and dump the contents into a quart ziploc baggie, when I'm ready to eat it I pore boiling water in the bag, eat it from the bag, fast easy just one waste item. Pretty much that's how I prepare all my meals. So once I finished that job it was back to the trail which turned out to 10:00am. The day started sunny and mild and the trail once again was fairly flat, and mostly rock free. I stopped at John's Spring shelter for a bite to eat and Yet2b and two other section hikers were there also. Back on the trail I ran into ""Bo"" a volunteer ATC trail maintenance worker. I asked why in the 25 mile section we cant stealth camp and he told me this is not a Forest service area but rather under the jurisdiction of the National Park service. Didn't know that. So on I went headed for the famous McAfee Knob. I arrived aroused 3pm and it was beginning to cloud over with rain in the forecast. I asked a young lady to snap a couple pictures on the cliff and there you have it. The next campground and shelter was about a 1/2 mile away and it would have been another few miles before my next chance to stop so I cut the mileage short but the day was long. It began poring rain when I arrived so myself and a dozen other hikers hunkered down in the shelter and waited for the rain to let up. Yet2b and myself were the only ones here but in the last several minutes I'm hearing a bunch of others setting up tents. That's what happens when your forced into camping in limited locations.

Hope I see him again, he is visiting family in Daleville and will be off trail a few days. I find him pleasant,  easygoing and interesting to listen to. 
The trail again today was pretty forgiving  with some incredible ridge views this afternoon. Daleville on one side and an enormous lake on the other.  I need to get the mileage back up so I pushed it today. Feet are sore but no big deal. I hiked with a young lady from New Zealand for a couple hours this morning and enjoyed our conversation. We passed Tinker cliffs today but was less than inspiring compared to yesterday. The issue of heat and lack of water supply was an issue again today.  It was a stretch of 9 miles with no supply,  I'm not sure how people cope in much warmer conditions, you ca only carry and guzzle so much at any given time
The trail crosses US 220 on outskirts of Daleville and fortunately several business were nearby. No hiker passes up real food so I purchased a ham and cheese sandwich,  tin of macaroni salad,  coke, pretzels and a strawberry Danish for dessert! Even though I have a food bag weighing 10 pounds. 
I am still on federal property with no stealth camping allowed but I am on a nice grassy spot near the trail and plan to set up shortly.  No more mileage for this old man today. 
It appears I ja e a pretty big climb in the .morning but still hope to keep the mileage up. I am camping between US220 and I81 as I stated which means its going to be a noisy night.

The trail again today was pretty level with minimal rocks but, it was a steady uphill climb most of the day. I was expending allot of energy but moving at a slower pace. I passed a couple seniors thru hikers and day hikers but for most of the day I saw nobody. Kind of weird like Daleville sucked everyone into town? I didn't really see anything very interesting today mostly wilderness trails. I did stop at Wilson Creek shelter for a break but that was it.
I have developed a shin splint on my left ankle now which hinders my pace and I hope dosen't last long. If I had know earlier about the foot issues I was going to have I would have ordered another pair of feet as backup to be sent will new boots!
I am so happy to be off National Park land so I can camp were I please. I am on a ridge line again with no water nearby so here is what I have been doing. I don't carry ""extra "" water bottles so when I need to pack in extra like tonight I use quart size ziploc baggies. I fill up 2 of them and stick em in an exterior pocket on my pack. Water problems solved, obviously the baggies when empty take up no space or add bulk or weight. Just an idea.
I was talking to Vicki trying to calculate what kind of mileage I need to average to get to Waynesboro by next Friday afternoon. It seems 14.5 to 15 would get me very close to Rockfish Gap and hwy 64. Then I looked at my hiking topography and realized after tomorrow I have big changes coming.

I was resting at the Mills Gap overlook on the Blue Ridge parkway when a gentleman pulled up with lemonade, apples and crackers. Cool trail magic....bad thing was I was checking my left foot which had been sore but now suddenly is swelling up. Well I kept pushing on and after another mile I had to accept that it was feeling and looking just like my right foot bacteria infection. You gotta be kidding me! I sat down on the trail took a couple pics and called my doctor. He picked up on the first ring and asked how my foot had healed, I said great but look at the text I just sent you. Yup same infection other foot, only thing is I got to this much earlier. He wasn't surprised. Now here is the truly remarkable events that happened next.
I checked my position and the town of Buchanan was only 4 miles down the parkway. I googled for a pharmacy and found one in town. (The only one) Texted the info to Dr Masri who immediately called in the script. The road was only a 5 minute hike so I was planning to walk into town or try to thumb into town. (I haven't tried thumbing) Got to the road, tossed out the thumb, first vehicle 10 seconds later stopped picked me up and dropped me in front of the drugstore only 15 minutes after talking to my doctor.  Wow, local guy that's knows all about the AT and likes hikers. I walk in the drugstore and step back in time 100 years. Pharmacy on one side old time soda jerk counter on the other. While waiting for my script I order a burger, fries and honest to God an old fashioned vanilla malted milk shake. They also plugged my dying phone in to charge for me. Finished eating picked up my script and some candy, and paid the bill. I have VA for health coverage so no real insurance to show and immediately was aware that the pharmacist deeply discounted my script cost. Unbelievable. Walked a block back to the highway and yep first vehicle by picked me up and dropped me back exactly where I got off the trail. Turned out to be another local, blue collar business owner. We talked about guy stuff but I mentioned this is really hurting my ability to get to Waynesboro by next Friday to meet my wife.  He immediately and sincerely said that if I needed to be picked up and taken to Waynesboro to call him and he would gladly come and get me. So we exchanged contact info. From my call to Dr Masri to my stepping back on the trail was only 90 minutes, unbelievable. 
I sorry about this long foot story but I was completely moved by the efforts of everyone today to help me without question to get me taken care of. I will probably completely forget the hiking part of today but the efforts and kindness shown to me by these complete strangers will never be forgotten. Today's experience testifies to the goodness of people and brightened my day beyond belief. I am so grateful and continually blessed!

My goal was to stop at Dundo Campground which is listed in my AWOL mileage detail book I carry. As I had been told earlier, today was the usual ups and downs and unfortunately very few scenic views or water sources. I ran into several hikers I know such as Jimmy, Butter, Redneck and others I cant remember. The one outstanding view is from BlackRock mountain. Everything was going fine until I walked by a couple with their pit bull at the Jones Run parking area. As I passed them it lunged out and bit me in the right thigh. Luckily it only ""pinched"" really hard and I have a nice bruise. Upon arriving finally at the Dundo Campground I discovered there was no camping just picnic areas, restrooms and trash bins. Nice I was at 16.7 miles and ready to stop. Well anyway there was a nice middle aged couple from Germany there and they were really interested in the trail so we talked about that and they told me about hikes they had done in Europe. Nice trail fellowship. They offered me a ride up to the real campground, Loft Mountain 3 miles up the road but I declined, I think I'll stop there in the morning. They did give me 2 bottles of water, 2 apples and a German energy bar, really nice encounter. 
After leaving Dundo I started looking for somewhere to camp. I got to Browns Gap and the trail headed uphill, no thank you. Across Skyline road was a seldom used and chained closed fire service road.

The hiking today seemed to either be nice gentle trails or long slow up hills. Which apparently will continue through the park. We (i) am walking through what's referred to as the green tunnel. Not much for views just endless forest. Which has its pluses but also leads to boredom. 
I run into other hikers each day, some just out for the day, weekend, section or thru. Sometimes engaging in casual conversations or greetings. Still haven't met a strange one yet! I'm camped on top of Hightop mountain tonight and a fellow set up camp about 50 yards away. I usually don't have close company. Being the friendly outgoing guy that I am I walked over and stuck up a conversation. His name is ET, (Energizer turtle) about my age from Canada. Nice guy and we had a bit in common. 
It rained hard earlier today but the sun came back out and I was able to dry things out. Had a little trail magic just before the storm at a gap crossing. Kit cat, heath bar, oreos and half a home made ham and cheese sandwich. That all powered me up this mountain! ET and I are going out to catch the sunset from my mountain top vista, goodnight all.
""Eye of the tiger"" is my new mantra!","Loft Mtn Campground

NARSIL aka Father Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614517,"Holy crap I am camped near the Byrds Nest #3 Hut as I write yesterday's journal and a lightning bolt just hit the lightning rod on it! That was way I was up early ate breakfast, oatmeal, Carnations instant breakfast, coffee and a pop tart. I headed down the mountain to a road crossing, Skyline 66.7 and bam trail magic! I had two sloppy joes, Gatorade, cookies, chips, watermelon, and then grabbed some to go items. It was served by two retired military officers who both work at the Pentagon. How cool is that. So with a double full belly I continued on over Saddleback and Baldface mountains. I passed the Lewis Mountain Campground, Bearfence Mountain Hut and Bearfence mountain. Other than up and down the mountains it was a decent hiking day. Oh some where in that hike I passed my second bear. An adult feeding about 30 feet from the trail. I just walked as quickly and quietly as possible till it was out of sight. I had to create my campsite tonight in the only open place I could use. It was a little lopsided but it worked. Had deer in camp snorting their displeasure but oh well.","Hightop mountain

NARSIL aka Father Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614528,"Today started early again before 7, cant seem to sleep in anymore. The trail was level and smooth making for easy walking. I went by the Big Meadows Lodge and Campground and ran into a cooler next to the trail with Gatorade, cakes and fruit. Another bonus breakfast. Swung into the campground to empty trash, fill up with water, use the facilities, wash my face and replenish my toilet paper supply. These may seem like silly little things but out here it's a big deal to use the creature comforts you take for granted. Anyway I walked down to the Rock Spring Hut to see the cabin pictured above. There are several of these 1930s cabin for rent around the park but none were occupied. They have no power, water or facilities so I don't think they are as popular as they once may have been. 
I then hiked over Hawksbill mountain and then passed the parks Skyland Resort. After that was the Stony Man Cliffs with vast vistas of the valley and distant mountains. Then over the Pinnacle mountain and on into the Byrds Nest #3 Hut. I apparently missed to bears today by just a couple minutes. One was hear at the hut.  That's about it for tonight, I should be out of the park sometime Monday, its 101 miles long, whew!","Stealth near Big Meadows clearing

NARSIL aka Father Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614700,"Hello, today turned into a great hiking day after storms and heavy rain throughout the night. The hut and tenting areas ended up pretty full. The usual ups and downs and rocks were the order of the day. However the mountain crossings are not as steep any more. Long more manageable grades are the norm. Passed over Pass and Neighbor mountains then on to the Elkwallow Wayside. This is another and last gift store/grill in the SMP. Since it is right off the trail, and no reputipal hiker passes by a chance for real food, I had two giant cheeseburgers, fries. Soda and famous BlackBerry milkshake. Then I immediately got to hike up Hogback mountain! ugh Since the mileage worked out I stopped at the Gravel Springs Hit for the night. There were already a number of hikers there and by just after nightfall it looked like a small city! Everyone though in hiker fashion quieted down quickly and I actually had a rare decent nights sleep .","Byrds Nest #3 Hut

NARSIL aka Father Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614703,"Everyone but a couple were out of camp by 6:30 this morning. Front Royal is close and the kids smell pizza and beer! I was out by 8. I also was headed off trail to the hostel above which was only .5 off trail. Of course before arriving I had South and North Marshall mountains to cross, good grief. 
I must have been hauling because I made it to the hostel just around noon. The owner is a AT and PCT hiker from years ago. I showered, did my laundry and then we went in town together to grocery shop in his case, resupply for me. I have been relaxing most of the afternoon. No other hikers are here currently but I other's are on the way.
The picture above is of I-Phone, a senior Chinese gentleman that we have been passing each other for a week. He doesn't speak any English but I have seen him use a language translation app on his phone. He has become quite an inspiration. He carries this giant pack and walks slowly from daylight to dusk every day and we have been ending up lately in the same place. We ran into some Chinese teenagers a couple days ago and I found out his name and that he is a retired teacher. Kind of look forward to our daily encounters.
Now for the surprising news, Harpers Ferry is the next trail town ahead at about 1025 miles. I have been contemplating and evaluating my journey for a couple weeks now and have decided that this hike is ending at Harper's Ferry. I am very content with my efforts and I think I proved my physical toughness and grit to myself over the last 3 months. I also think that God has restored my faith in humanity by bringing me together with so many wonderful people. My trail encounters, town and even total strangers encounters have been nothing short of marvelous experiences. I believe my summer will be much more meaningful to be with my wife, family and friends than to continue rock hopping and climbing all day.
I wish the best of luck and Gods speed and grace for all my friends continuing this journey. Gator, Young Gun, Halo, Q, Yet2b, Pappa Smurf and the dozens of others I've met along the way. I will continue to post until Sunday when I already have a flight booked home from DC.","Gravel Springs Hut

NARSIL aka Father Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614833,"Last night I ended up being the only hiker in the hostel. I actually watched some TV, couple game shows and some baseball. Had pizza for dinner and sacked out about 10pm. I was up and back on the trail before 8am. The section between Front Royal and Harpers Ferry is about 60 miles. I plan to hike it in 4 days getting into town Friday afternoon. Hopefully spend some ""tourist time "" Saturday in historic Harper's Ferry
Rain started just after I started hiking this morning and continued for about 90 minutes. Since I was hiking in the green tunnel most of the day it became very humid with temperatures reaching 90. The next couple days looks like a rollercoaster. Not huge hills but lots of tight ups and downs. I wanted to post a picture of the Jim & Molly Denton shelter but cant get it to download. It's the nicest one I've seen. It had a shelter with large porch, wooden chaise seating, separate covered picnic area, horseshoe pit and even a gravity shower. I could have stayed all day, instead I enjoyed luch with ET. The picture I did post is a shot of the trail that we continually have to navigate almost every day. These rocks are very hard on your feet, knees, ankles and thighs. Since it was wet this morning they were really a challenge and why so many slips and nasty falls occur. Anyway you get pretty good at navigating them
I'm in my tent set for the evening, the bugs continue to get worse and the undergrowth is getting thick and tall almost covering the trail in places. I case your wondering I had a cup of chicken soup, package of Knorr rice dish, oreos and water for dinner. Yes and a few gummy bears!","Front Royal Hostle, Front Royal, VA

NARSIL aka Father Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614932,"I'm not sure why but I was up early again today, I guess it's because its getting lighter out earlier. I did want to try for decent miles so I can be in Harper's Ferry for certain Friday some time. Guess I have that in the bag since its only 23 miles from here. I passed Dicks Dome shelter right away then passed thru Sky Meadows State Park. Next was Rod Hollow shelter. At about 11 miles on the day I hit the dreaded Roller Coaster! 13.5 miles of very close and challenging ups and downs. I also just passed the Sam Moore shelter.  At my current campsite I am 7 miles into them and actually for the most part haven't found them to be as bad as predicted. One other note is the ticks are getting really bad you have to be continuously checked yourself. I actually had one beginning to attach itself today but I think I got it off on time.
As you see by the picture I passed the 1000 mile mark today. Just so everyone knows, I am 100% satisfied with ending this hike on that number. (Actually about 1023) my stopping has nothing to do with anything other than I'm tired,  and a bit beat up and am ready to go home. Kinda like Forest Gump ending his marathon run in the movie, that simple. 
I didn't realize it till a little while ago but 2.5 miles down the trail is the Bears Den hostle. It is owned by the ATC and run by the Potomac trail club exclusively for hikers. It is the premier hostle on the trail, located on 66 acres of land it's a historic stone mansion. You can bet that I will be swinging by tomorrow morning!
Since I've managed to exceed my mileage goals I'm going to try and sleep in a little in the morning,  hit the Roller Coaster right away and pit stop at the hostel before continuing on. I would only like to leave maybe 8 miles to do Friday getting me into town around 1pm.
For what its worth I will pass into West Virginia tomorrow. Kind of go back and forth a couple times.","Stealth campsite near Telico Tower trail

NARSIL aka Father Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615037,"So much for sleeping in, I was on the trail by 7:15. I made it to the Bears Den about 8:45. What a place. Built in the 1930s as a summer getaway for a Washington doctor. It is an upscale lodge and hiker hostel. (They keep the hikers downstairs out back for the most part) But what a clean, elegant and friendly place. Since I was there I had two cups of real coffee, two pop tarts and a pint of Ben & Jerry's ice cream. Can you think of a better breakfast....Then it was 6.5 more miles of the Roller Coaster. Once those hills were finished the trail finally flattened out pretty much for the remainder of the day. It started raining just as I was nearing the shelter so I ducked in with a couple other hikers. I was planning to continue on a little farther but this shelter has a bunch of tent pads and it was getting on 5pm so I decided to set up camp. The only drawback was the water supply is way down a steep hill. So off I went and imagine my surprise coming back up that the camping area was being overrun by a group of kids and adults! Oh well I'm set up and there being noisy, surprise. I only have about 9 miles left to reach Harper's Ferry so I should be in town by 1ish where I have a hostel reservation. I plan to clean up, toss out items no longer needed and visit the town. Goodnight from my final campsite on this amazing journey!","Campsite north of Sam Moore Shelter

NARSIL aka Father Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615187,"Today would be bittersweet for sure. I was up early again and on trail by 7:45. The trail had become almost flat and easy to hike since leaving the Roller Coaster. I was at the ATC headquarters before noon. They register you with a new thru hiker number and take your picture for the yearly album and there is a desktop version kept at the ATC. My starting number was 242 my new number is 424, hmm is it a sign, doubtful.  I had a 1/2 mile walk to the hostel and stopped for a burger on the way.
I feel a little sad its ending but very happy to be  going home Sunday.  I had a relaxing afternoon and I spent time talking to the other four hikers here tonight. One mid-thirties guy from Germany named Black Forest was particularly interesting and we ended up having dinner at local pizza place. Just one more memorable encounter. 
Thanx for following along, I'll do one final post once I get home Happy trails!","David Lesser Memorial shelter

NARSIL aka Father Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616087,"Greetings everyone,
Just wanted to thank everyone again for all the comments and well wishes I received while on the trail. 
I have been home a little more than a week and took no time at all to adjust back to ""normal "". I am dedicated to hanging onto the slow and peaceful life the trail instilled in me. Just watching the level of stress and frantic pace all around me is sad compared to the kindness and comradery of the trail. I don't miss the trail, I will miss the people. I am very happy to be home and have zero regrets for leaving when i did.
I do want to let my hiking friends know that for some of you coming back healthy should always be in the back of your mind. My feet and knee still feel as though I only left the trail yesterday. I have received another cordizon injection in my knee but that isn't helping the ligaments that took a beating. Also both feet and toes continue to be partially numb, swelling of my ankles is off and on and my shins are still very sore. I'm being told these conditions could take weeks or even months to heal. This is primarily due to nerve damage,  was it rocks or infection? Don't ignore your body is all I'm saying. 
Will I ever get back on trail, I don't know.  If we decide to stay in Florida for one more year I may very well decide to pick up again in Harper's Ferry and go for as long as I feel fit, I still would like to finish but it's no longer an obsession. 
I am watching a handful of my friends continue on and wish them safe travels and good fortune!

NARSIL aka Father Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623880,"Greetings, 
Gator and myself after many weeks apart got the chance to reunite this past Friday. Along with our respective wives Kelly and Vicki, without their support we could never have imagined our adventure. Gator came off trail in Hanover, NH on the 28th only about 440 miles short of Katahdin. While I came off back in June after 1000 miles plus.
We had a great afternoon reminiscing, having lunch and hanging out on the ocean in New Smyrna beach, Florida. Both of us have thoughts of getting back on trail next year and finishing what we started. I have pretty much healed up from my injuries and Gator although tired said he is feeling great.  I am tentatively planning a week long shakedown hike in the Pictured Rocks National lake shore, in Michigan's UP next April with a couple of my brother in laws and if all works out may head back to Harper's Ferry on May 1st. If Gator decides to return and we can work out the logistics we would meet in Hanover and finish the trail together. I know there is allot of time and circumstance in between but maybe the stars will all align in our favor. 
Several of our friends sumitted recently to include, Young Gun, Halo, Q, RG, Papa Smurf and most recently yet2b, great job guys!
Anyway for all who followed our journey, thank you and stay tuned this coming spring to see how our plans may be working out, your support and encouragement is essential to anyone trying to make this hike a reality!",,View Entry,"Oct 06, Sun",0
NARSIL aka Father Time,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626395,"Hello hikers,No this isn't the AT but it is a shakedown hike of sorts. Gator and I got together for a five day hike to reunite and see how the bodies are holding up. Gator completed about 1750 and miles last year and is planning to head back to the AT in July and finish his hike. I made it to Harper's Ferry and am really hoping to get on trail in early May. My dear wife is not thrilled with the idea because it has taken a long time to heal from last year's hike and I'm not getting any younger! However this recent hike went well and I would really like to make the attempt. I'm doing another week hike in April and will decide after that. Gator and I have talked about finishing the last leg of the trail together if we can sync up. Best of luck to everyone heading out in 2020, maybe I'll run into some of you!","
