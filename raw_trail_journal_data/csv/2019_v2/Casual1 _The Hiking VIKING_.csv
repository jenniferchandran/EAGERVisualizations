"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606294,"Today was a big day for me.  I notified my boss of my future retirement.  I registered with the AT Conservancy #T5714.  I booked my hotel room at Amicalola Falls lodge. I arranged to have two of my friends assist my wife in arranging my retirement party.  I got good news, a trail friend I met in the Smokies in 2016 is coming out to do the first week with me.

What are you going to eat? Food, and alot of it!
Are you going to carry a gun? No, absolutely not!
Are you going to carry Bear Spray? No, not as of now.
Are you doing it alone? Yes, I know there will be much ""alone time"" but there are thousands of people on the trail.
How far is it? about 2200 miles.
Where are you starting? Georgia, Springer Mountain.  Where are you ending? Maine, Katahdin.
Funny story, I surprised my wife last night telling her that I have fully assumed she was going to summit Katahdin with me.  She was completely surprised.",,View Entry,"Jan 27, Sun",0

Yesterday was a tough day at work.  I was sitting in my office at 4:30 and everyone else had gone for the week and it got really quiet.  I cleaned out my emails as I had missed two days or work due to illness this week.  I shut down the computer and reveled in the quiet for a while.  I got sad for a while as I sad and it really hit me 21! more days until I am retired!!!
This morning I got my pack and equipment out and paced my pack for my first Pack Hike of the season.  I met my buddy Rick and his tow dogs with my dog and we got over four miles in until I had to leave for my haircut (one more before I leave).  It was nice to have the Pack on and it felt good.  I think I was almost at trail weight.",,View Entry,"Mar 23, Sat",0

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609317,"So, in Saturday's post I mentioned my back was hurting, which it was.  I figured out on Sunday that the pain may have been exacerbated by my pack being broken.  I was conducting a pack shake down and weighing all of my equipment.  I was attempting to weigh my empty pack and I noticed it was a little flimsy.  Come to find out the internal frame had snapped.  I guess it's better to have discovered that prior to heading onto the trail.  I have two weeks to departure, and plenty of time to purchase a new pack.
I also spoke to my friend Allen on Sunday we finalized our plans for meeting in Atlanta on the 14th.  He will be packing the first week with me.  I met Allen on the trail in the Smokies back in June of 2016, and we've stayed in touch since.  I am looking forward to catching up with him and hearing of his recent hike into Grand Canyon.

We checked in to our room, awesome view. we decided to walk the 600 steps down the falls and got caught in a downpour.  Then you have to walk 600 stairs back up the falls.

Today was tough, alot of ups, and straight ups, water became scarce in the middle.  I need to figure out lunches. I’m doing 2 oatmeal packs for breakfast and a hiker meal for dinner. lunch now consist of protein bars and jerky. i may have to switch to PB&J on tortillas or tuna packs. I'm out of snacks, two days until the prospect of a town. I’m starting to stink. Oh well it is what it is?.

today was supposed to be easier and less miles than yesterday, and it was.  i slept ok last night. fell asleep, unplanned early, and woke up before dark. then back to sleep at dark. The shelter and camping area very busy with 36+ hikers.
I was up before dawn, heard an owl and i’m sure it was full moon last night. had coffee and oatmeal as the sun came up. on the trail an hour earlier today than yesterday. seeing alot of familiar faces, met a couple from Woodstock IL  met a couple  Janet and Joe who offered to take me to town at the NOC, if are there. good views today.  met a trail maintainer, he walks a section with a backpack of tools and maintains, he cuts trees if they fall over the trail, hand saws only-(rules?!?) pulled up early today. Attack Blood mtn tomorrow, also bear canisters required next 10 miles and i don’t have one. i did hang a bear line tonight so i can hang my food.
Also i got my first blister today, right small toe on the outside and bottom, the i checked other toes and found one on left middle but that one doesn’t hurt","Gooch Mtn Shelter
",Jarrard Gap,"Apr 17, Wed",10.60
"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610782,"worst night of sleep so far, i thought it was going to be good stayed up later. up at 130 until almost 430 then on and off for two hours, going to catch up with me if i’m shooting fo 13 miles a day on 4+\- hours of sleep.  i think i need some decongestant for sleeping.
i forgot to mention yesterday, it seemed as though the birds were much more singy?


So Blood Mtn. wasn’t near as bad as projected. there was trail magic in the shelter, rice crispy treats, mini snicker, mini kit kat was my choosing. There was a privy there too??
Mountain Crossings is my first Hostel experience 7 bunk beds, 14 beds with one showers and toilet. they are a very well equipped outfitters. So about 5 miles today, and i’m calling it a day due to bad storms coming through. So i don’t think this qualifies as a zero day.  They have a vcr, so i’m going to grab a movie and a bean bag chair and relax when Alan says good bye.
So i perused the dvd & book collection grabbed a bean bag chair and settled in. Then some of the other hikers started carrying in crock pots!!!?????  they said there was an old couple bringing us dinner. They were from a church 30 miles away and they do this once a month. I almost cried, salad, mac and cheese, green beans, cookies, brownies, & sweet tea.


BTW the movie is Sister Act & the book is Patterson, Unlucky 13


supposed to rain tomorrow too, but i’m going to hike, cold on Saturday, but Seaneen booked me a room at Top of Georgia on Sunday, they do your laundry.","Jarrard Gap

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610938,"so, i can’t even rank bad nights of sleep anymore.


Up not  awake, i’ve been awake for hours, at 0530, to use the restroom for the 2nd time, and i think dehydrated?!? I will chug 2 bottles before heading out,


So out today is an 8-10 hour hike in the rain, potentially.  Then maybe a place in the shelter, if no room the tent goes up in the rain. I’ll try Benadryl tonight for the congestion and to maybe sleep.


Well i pushed and did 21.2, made it to Unicoi Gap, It POURED on me 10 of the 12 hours I hiked today.The trail was quiet, i crossed paths with only one other hiker.Today was a day of waterfalls. With all of the rain everything was flowing.


I headed out before coffee and breakfast. when it’s going to rain all day it doesn’t matter when you start.  It was rough bit I did it. I hiked in the rain and cold and made it.

So last night was rough but not too bad. I stayed at Tray Mtn. shelter.  There was a mom, son, girlfriend,and mom’s friend there. they got rained outta tents the night before so they were in the shelter.  Ended up 10 of us crammed in there. Everyone was in their sleeping bag early as it was so cold. 



The snoring was out of control, i even heard talking and singing in their sleep.
Today was a good hike to Top of Georgia Hostel. A couple of really good views. I met trail runner Katie she was super nice and i wished her a happy Easter, she smiled really big and said she hadn’t realized it was easter.


so now i feel like complete trail trash.


i’m outside a grocery store stealing power for my phone, wifi from starbucks, drinking a Smirnoff ICE smash screwdriver 40oz

Seaneen confirmed package was out for delivery. Hopefully be here soon. I’d like to get some miles in, it is a gorgeous hiking day.


So i got a late start and the climbs were brutal they seemed to go on and on.


I did see what i thought was an owl. I only noticed it because of the shadow. it was silent and gliding under the tree canopy weaving its way around the trees, just silently floating.


My pack is a little heavier than i like it, I resupplied and Seaneen sent me some essentials.  I now have a solar charger for my phone and camera. Thanks Dr. Kammie?


I crossed the GA/NC border today just before camp. I was exhausted.  My pack is beginning to become one with me, and I named it Daisy.

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611282,"So This morning I heard an owl Whooooo, 15 seconds later Whooooo this went on for two or three minutes. I was up before dawn having coffee.  Headed out with a flexible plan of 12 or 15 miles
I saw a cooler along the trail,  YEA! trail magic, but i gad a weird feeling. I slowly opened the cooler and it was a bad combination of trail box food and supplies and garbage to include a rotten salad, YUCK!  100 feet down the trail there was a small parking lot and a through hiker I have been leapfrogging. Her friends had a cooler of soda, mini snickers, and fruit,SCORE, and THANK YOU!!!
I then ran into another trail runner/maintainer these people walk the trail and maintain it. he asked about conditions or issues, he was carrying a bag of garbage, THANK YOU!


I haven’t seen slot of wildlife, today a blue jay.


I found a pair of sun glasses on the trail today. Since 90+% of hikers are going northbound i grabbed them and asked everyone i saw. Bringing them into the shelter I met Sloth. he was hanging out in a hammock.  I told him my name is Chuck no trail name yet, he said you look like a Viking, your name is Viking.?
So today was alot of up and down, highest point so far on the trail . I thought about hiking the Porcupine Mtns. with my nephews last year. They kept saying why are there so many hills. I would say they are called the Porcupine Mtns. not flats. So that’s why the Appalachian Mtns are so hilly-They are Mtns.

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611591,"So today I started at Carter Gap.  I was walking along minding my own business when there in the middle if the trail was a snake, scarred the ?out of me, first snake i’ve seen that surprised me.


I climbed to the highest point on the trail so far, there was a fire tower there snd i climbed that too. I met Flamingo snd Locks there, Flamingo gave me a little flamingo, sharing the love. the climb up was the most difficult ( technical)so far. But weird thing on the way down the other side NC discovered you don’t gave to walk straight up over every peak, there are switchbacks and walking along the side of a mtn. 


I got to the shelter 1st and got to puck my spot.   Best shelter group by far. Everyone very nice.   I built a fire for the first time and got the best night sleep so far.

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611593,"The climb out of Wayah Bald was long and just wouldn’t end.
I met the Raven family: Mom, Dad, and i’m guessing boy 14 & girl 11???  Story is they are walking the AT to complete the triple crown. That's the Pacific Crest, Continental Divide, and Appalachian Trails. They moved along very well.


I think I finally ate enough of my food to get my pack weight back to normal. There is a sweet spot as far as weight goes.  I was definitely too heavy since TOG.


Shelter life - you never know who is going to be there when you get there and you never know who will come in after you. It’s a crap shoot. I’ve had good shelter mates and bad ones, snorers, talk in sleep, sing in sleep, go to the bathroom constantly, ugh!!! So a lady, hard of hearing mind you, says to me and a trail mate, Tony if you two are early risers please be quiet.  I’m like, ok lady how bout you are in a shelter, turn your phone off so it quits vibrating, and don’t mind us when you pee twice during the night.


So WARNING potty talk:  So hydration is big out here. i have not been peeing enough. I made a point to drink alot of water today and i peed all day and clear. I felt better and stronger all day. Additionally I am not like a bear yet, I’ll keep you posted.","Rock Gap Shelter

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611594,"Started at Wayah Gap Shelter in the rain a little later than i wanted due to the rain.  Walking in the rain isn’t bad, it’s when you stop you get cold.  I knew today was 17+ but headed to the NOC, and a bed.
I walked today with Camel Back Santa-google him. kind of interesting.  I heard a story about a machete wielding man threatening hikers  https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article229620344.htmlToday was weird: it was cold and rainy, hot and sunny, depending on the side of the mtn it was really windy or dead calm.  i was walking in the dead calm and i heard some popping and cracking. I watched a 6 inch diameter tree fall for no reason, it just fell. i’ve been walking in high winds among millions of trees and this one just falls.  
I’m in a shelter at the NOC tonight, got dinner, a few beers, did laundry, showered and shaved.","Wayah Bald Shelter

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611672,"Today’s picture is from one of the water sources. Some say you don’t have to filter. I do as its easy and i have a filter.
slept terrible again, couldn’t fall asleep last night, I finally took some Advil and turned on the fan in the 4 person room.  Sleeping mat, cot , bunk was not very comfortable.


I ate breakfast at the restaurant with two hiker friends. I resupplied at the outfitters and got a new water bottle. I then mailed about 2 lbs of stuff home.


I knew today was going to be hard! It was uphill non stop for 4 hours!!!! 8.1 miles 3330 feet of elevation.  I met a guy on the trail, he was in our hostel/room last night but came in late. He caught up to me at 10:00 and had put a buzz on prior to hitting the trail. He also was packing the three beers i had left in the room. Hike your own hike, I guess!?!


Wildlife today I saw a 6 inch lizard and many butterflies.


Word travels very fast up and down the trail.  I am not a gossiper but it’s funny what and how much you hear:
-he tipped the pizza driver $70
-Norovirus running rampant on the trail. but no one knows anyone who’s sick.
-There’s a machete yielding man threatening hikers
-Sloth, that night hiker guy?


So after the climb i took a break and felt really good. I was going to  shoot for 15 today.  When i get tired two things happen. I start to stumble over things more, and the middle of my back starts hurting. It’s important to listen to your body. I stopped at 10.6.


18.5 to Fontana Dam but much more forgiving elevations??","Nantahala Outdoor Center NOC
",Locust Cove Gap - Camping,"Apr 27, Sat",10.60
"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611808,"I finally slept good, i only woke for a brief rain shower. I had to put my bag under the rain fly.  I think i was the last one up and the last one out of camp. Very unusual for me.


I started out good knowing it may or may not be a long day.  I list two guys Ive been leap frogging, Memorial & Crypter. I’m hoping to catch them at the dam. Also, I want to get to the dam because Melody, another hiker i’ve been leapfrogging, is having family meet her in the Smokies and she offered me a ride to Gatlinburg.


The day got really difficult coming out of Stecoah Gap then Jacobs ladder out of Sweetwater Gap. That climb was a monster! I listened to my body today took a-lot of breaks, drank a-lot and ate a-lot. 


I got to Cable Gap Shelter and took a break to make a decision as to stay 12 mile day or continue?!?  The shelter was small and Fontana is 6.7 miles 3-4 hours. I pressed on and I’m paying for it. Fontana Dam was a long way away with plenty of up hill before the decent, then more accent at the end.


Memorial and Crypter were not here but Melody was.


Today I passed the 150 mark.  Yesterday I was happy to be away from the drunk before 10:00am hiker. Today I got passed by another creepy guy, He’s in camp tonight.  You lose one you gain another.


I’ve heard people say they have lost weight on the trail so far, 10,15,20 lbs.  Where they are weighing themselves I don’t know?  I don’t feel i’ve lost weight. My legs seemed to have thinned out but my mid section i don’t think has changed.


There were alot less people on the trail today. both through and day hikers. I’ve also noticed there were alot of through hikers with dogs at the beginning. I have not seen any of them in days.


So today I hiked from 8:15-19:00 11 hours with breaks lets say 8 hours, according to Map my Fitness i’d burn 5000+ calories.


What do I eat in a day:
Breakfast:
2 packages of oatmeal & coffee


Lunch: two tuna packets or pb&j on flour tortillas 


Dinner: Hiker meal usually around 800-1000 calories per hiker meal


Snacks: cookies if i have them, tic tacs, figs, cliff bars.

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611926,"So i took my time getting ready today as i was only 11.8, ha ha ha.  And i wanted to visit the gift shop. I took a morning shower. 



The gift shop was closed?. Its a long lonely walk from the visitor center to the trail head. then the sign says 9.9 to Mollies Shelter, and i know it’s mostly uphill 2700 feet worth.
There were some cool views today and a fire tower. I climbed to the top and the view was worth it.  I did climb a fire twice today, tallest one yet. I saw my first squirrel on the trail today, no other wildlife. A woman came in 45 minutes after me in camp and said  she saw two bears. 


I was completely wiped at 6 hours and still had 2 more hours of hiking. The day-went like this: I had been hiking uphill for two hours. I looked to my left and saw a fire tower way up and on another ridge, of course thats where i had to climb, ugh!!!


So i kept track of food today, I took in 1825 calories, and hiking alone I burned 3800+ calories.

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612240,"So I slept alright and felt good to start the day.  It always seems good in the morning when I am fresh.  My pack is lighter now due to having eaten my food weight down.  I’m still trying to think where i can cut more weight. I may get rid of a t shirt and pair of underwear. 
There was talk of bears in camp during the night. I didn’t see or hear them. I did see another deer in the morning. I met a lady from Australia, and  an older gentleman named Elevation whose finishing a through hike from last year.
We hiked over Thunderhead Mtn. and Rocky Top today. The AT goes along the border of NC and TN in the Smokies.  Elevation told me to definitely go to trail days in Damascus.  Another guy is walking the trail with no toilet paper, I stay far from him and everything he touches.
My shoe started falling apart, I am going to have Seaneen call and get a new pair shipped.  160 miles, not good. At that rate i’ll need 12 pairs of shoes. I was hoping to get 400-500 miles out of a pair.




The Raven family came into camp and stayed the night. They are the family doing the AT as the third trail of the triple criwn.
There is something to be said about the AT, well two things.  One, look around for the highest peak and that’s probably the one you are climbing next.  Two, it seems that no matter how easy or tough the day is there is almost a killer incline in the last mile

This morning started out windy and cold. The wind blew out my jet boil several times. Once I got moving I warmed up fast.
There was an older lady hiking yesterday and she fell and knocked herself out, complains about all of her ailments but she got up this morning and kept hiking. 
Today was a short day 7.4 but it had a few good climbs.  I stopped early because I am being picked up tomorrow at 515 at Newfoundland gap. So, if i hiked to the next shelter it would only be four on Thursday.
I am going to do a semi night hike in the morning. I have the alarm set for 415, I want to be on trail by 430 & to Clingmans Dome by 630 for the sunrise. 
Hung out with Princess from MN today at the shelter, met two guys from Parma Italy, and chatted with Blueberry from Durango CO.

The sun came up at 641, but it was foggy/cloudy at Clingman’s dome. I stayed at the top of the dome for three hours until the gift shop opened below. I cooked my morning coffee and oatmeal.  I was rewarded with about a 30 second view to the northeast.  While there Princess, Longfeather, Max, Tree trunks, and the Italians all made a visit, all to not be rewarded with a view. 
There was an old guy up there that talked my ear off for at least 45 minutes about everything and nothing. He was a military trained pilot and after the military he flew helicopter to and from oil rigs in the Gulf delivering people and supplies.
I had 7 more miles to walk to get to Newfoundland gap.  On the way I passed 10-15 older women out for a two mile hike, they were very chatty and had many questions for me which I smiled and answered.
Rene, a friend, is picking me up at 515. I got there at 315, time for a nap. 
Rene and a co-worker friend, Lee, picked me up at the gap.  We went into Gatlinburg and had dinner. Salad and a burger tasted so good, oh and beer.  We then went for ice cream, and I resupplied at the grocery store.  I got a hot shower and a comfortable couch to sleep on.

Let’s talk shelter life. Shelters are first come first serve, throw you bag down and mark your spot.  You sleep on wood shelves and hang your backpack from the roof. The floors are dirt and sometimes there are mice. Smoky Mtn. rules are if you are a section hiker you get space in the shelter over through hikers, even if a through hiker has been there for hours.  Today I got booted. I was set up, napped, ate dinner, then two groups of section hikers arrived and I had to set up my tent. It’s ok I like my tent, but it’s supposed to rain tonight.

There is a ridge runner here and he’s kind of a jerk.  There is also a guy here that won’t shut up,  blah blah blah, he’s knows everything!!!  
At one point today the trail was lined on both sides with various kinds of moss everything was shaded green, it was raining and still. I could hear rumble of thunder faintly in the distance. There was noise but the silence/ stillness was very calming. I looked down and there was a particular variety of moss, it looked soft and  warm like a puppy ‘s fur. I had to reach and touch it and it was soft but not warm like a puppy. 
So my bag cover is no longer waterproof so when I got to the shelter my bag was soaking through and the contents getting wet.

It’s hard to plan a day when you can’t get the weather report.  My bag cover was an epic failure yesterday. I don’t mind hiking in the rain but i need to be assured there are dry clothes in my pack. If not I am screwed, being cold and wet is not good, and there are no prospects of a warm bed at Davenport Gap. 
I hiked like a rock star today.  It rained from the time I left the shelter until 240ish. I like hiking in the rain but I get cold when I stop, so I didn’t stop.  In high school I ran my best cross country races in the rain. I get really focused and goal oriented in the rain.  The path was like a river today flowing up or down as i traversed. 
It’s funny as it’s raining it’s not slippery but as soon as it stops raining it gets like an ice rink, sliding all over. It’s also funny when you start you avoid puddles and then after a while you don’t care and you run right through the middle of them.  I am still hiking in the broken shoes so every time i bring my right foot forward through a puddle it scoops up water and throws it at the back of my left leg. It finally cleared up the last two hours of the hike.
I made it to Standing Bear Hostel. I really like this place, very laid back. Upon arrival you get a half sheet of notepad paper and that’s your tab. If you buy food or beer or supplies they hand write it on your tab. Upon checking out you settle your tab. They don’t even ask for a credit card up front.  I’ll try and add some pictures of this place to my photos.

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612714,"Woke this morning to a rooster crowing at 545!  I got up and did my laundry. Laundry consist of a small room with a double sink.  You wash your clothes in a wash basin in the left sink. There’s a wash board in the right sink. Then you wring out your clothes and put them in the one dryer.
I took my time today as I was enjoying the atmosphere at this hostel. I chatted with the staff and many hikers listening to their stories and getting advice. I spoke to a guy named Smoke who was doing work for stay where you work for an hour or two to earn a night in the hostel.  He had to do dishes for his. 
When the timing was right I hit the road with no real plan. I figured I’d hike to the first or second shelter and decide.  As I was hiking I realized I could make it to Max Patch, late but I could make it.  Max Patch is a patch of grass at the top of a mountain with 360 degree views.  I am told Max Patch is the last opportunity for maybe a couple months to have an unobstructed 360 view. I didn’t make it for sunset but the stars are popping and the moon is slivered.  I am hoping for a better sunrise than at Clingman’s Dome. 
From 530 until  910 when I arrived at Max’s I did not see another person. I hiked the last 1.5 miles in the dark. There are probably 25 tents up here. While walking I noticed the tree canopy is really coming in and the trail-is now lined with grass instead of moss, and it’s long enough to have gone to seed.  I  heard an owl, it hooted different than the last one. This one did a series of four: who who....who whooo. 
I panned on sleeping with the rain fly off to view the stars but its too cold. I’ll have to wake up and look at them.

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612836,"I’m glad I pushed last night to get to Max Patch.  I was sleeping and woke up during the night. I get lazy about looking at the stars. I opened my tent and the stars were raining down on me.  It was as though I could reach and touch them. At first I had a hard time finding constellations because of all of the stars but when my eyes adjusted they popped out of the sky nearer and brighter than I’ve seen in a long time. 
The sky is mostly clear this morning as I sit in anticipation of the sun rise. I made my coffee. The sunrise was spectacular!!  I had a second cup of coffee and some oatmeal and started packing 16+ miles today, pulling up just short of Hot Springs. 
So I headed out from Max Patch and it was a very peculiar day. The hike was long with nothing really special, not even a good view. I did not pass, nor did I get passed by a through hiker in either direction, not for 8 hours!  I kept thinking I was on the wrong trail, or I missed some warning. Before 11:00 I saw other hikers stealth camping.  At the first shelter there was 3-4 tents, a guy said no one stayed in the shelter last night. At the second shelter nobody was there. Usually someone is taking a break or already done for the day.  I passed only two day hikers on the trail today. I did my 16.1 and walked into the Deer Park shelter and no one was there. It might be my first night alone?.  I built a fire and enjoyed the quiet. After about an hour and a half two couples arrived and we enjoyed conversation until dark, bedtime.
Before the smokies the trail was very busy. Many through, section, and day hikers. You could also stealth camp between shelters.  The smokies were busy with the same, but you can’t stealth camp, only shelter camp. So, every day hikers are hiking between shelters and they fill fast, as you’ve read, I got booted. Now we are out of the Smokies and you can stealth again as well as use the shelters. I’m still finding it peculiar that I did not see one through hiker today?.  
While hiking I kept getting spider webs in my face. This is usually reserved for the first one out of camp and on the trail. I was definitely not the first one out. Apparently just the only one! 
 I had my first slip/fall today. Up to this point I’ve tripped, slipped, and  stumbled, but never fell. One time I was flying downhill and tripped, I was able to catch myself on a tree. Today there was a steep down step. I noticed other slips in the mud. I grabbed a tree for support. I took one step and I was on my butt. So, not a bad fall but my first, I picked myself up and continued on.","Standing Bear Farm

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613141,"I woke up early as I wanted to get to get to Hot Springs NC for breakfast. I mean a real breakfast!!! 
I was on the trail by 06:30. There was an immediate uphill then it was all downhill to Hot Springs. I made the 3.2 miles in an hour and a half.  In high school I could run 3.2 miles in about 20 minutes.  Maybe when I’m done with the trail and weigh 165-170 again I’ll try that?. 
I was the first one on trail today so I got ALL of the spider webs. At one point I rounded a corner and could see all of them.  They were hitting my arms, legs, and face!! At about 1.5 miles out I swear I could smell the pancakes. That’s what I had decided on, and they were soooo good. 
Hot Springs is a cute hiker friendly town.  First thing I did was drop my bag at the hostel. I then went to the outfitters. I needed new shoes as my others had not arrived. Seaneen tried and LLBean apologized, but they ultimately got rerouted home. I’ve been walking 124 mikes with my right toe/sole flapping.  I got a pair of Solomon Sense Max 2 trail runners. The staff at Bluff Mtn. Outfitters was awesome, very patient, and super knowledgeable. 
In town I think I saw Memorial leaving several blocks up. I saw Kyle at breakfast.  I saw Apollo at the outfitters. I saw Harry/Shotgun at lunch, we were joined by Camelback Santa.  I’m meeting Camelback & Shine, as in moonshine, for dinner. On the way back I saw Long feather. 
So injuries and illness.  I have been lucky. I came on trail and for about a week had some sinus congestion which only affected my sleeping a little.  I have a few days where I’ve only done a few miles but I’ve been injury free. I’ve been listening to my body.  The people that are really pushing, and I look at as: wow they are really making miles, are coming up sick or injured.  Even the Raven family, triple crown attempters, have had 7 unplanned zero days.  Here is a list of injuries: shin splints, hypothermia, cold/flu, plantar fasciitis, concussion and blisters. 
My feet have been real good and I’ve been taking care of them.  When its hot or my feet get hot I stop and take my shoes and socks off, and I remove the liners from my shoes and air them out. I also think having several people praying for me every day helps.

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613137,"I am reading The Wilderness World of John Muir-edited by Edwin Way Teale. In one of the chapters Muir describes a fall he took while traversing the whole length of the Tenaya Canyon.  Muir had just spent two weeks in the Cities of Oakland and San Francisco.  He wrote:”There,” I said, addressing my feet, to whose separate skill I had learned to trust night and day on my mountain, “that is what you get by intercourse with stupid town stairs, and dead pavements.” I feel as though when I am walking on the trail the terrain is alive, constantly changing, your feet never land the same. When I get into town there is a feeling of “dead pavement “ as every step is the same.  I have found that I tend to move toward grass or gravel when in town, if possible. Walking in the woods is much more satisfying to my feet. 
I had a great stay at Elmers Sunnybank Inn and Hostel. It was more like a B&B. Elmer is a great cook and breakfast was delicious.  Everyone, 3 guest, Elmer and two staff told their stories.  It was nice and I got some fruit and granola too. I left Elmers and went to the outfitters to pickup a couple Mountain House hiker dinners, I like them.  I weighed my pack with the food and water, 36 lbs. same as when I started.  I think a-lot of it depends on type of food and amount. 
The trail was nice today. It seemed to meander more than normal at times. I walked by a river in the sand. I climbed rocky inclines to Lovers Leap. Story has it, a young Indian girl leapt from the cliff after her father would not let her marry her love and another tribesman killed her love. She heard his voice in the river valley below and leapt from the cliff. The other tribesman was then killed by a panther. 
I walked through meadows and on gravel roads today.  I climbed an observation tower.  The trail was quiet again today. I did see a few through hikers. I got a picture with Longfeather. I met a lady with a really low starting number,111. I asked her about it. Her name is Unfazed. She started in February and it was just too cold do, she quit. She decided on Easter to come back onto the trail.  We chatted for a few minutes. 
The new shoes felt great, different, but great.  They are much lighter and more cushion. My ankles are a little fatigued because I have been wearing a hiker boot and these are low giving my ankles much more of a workout. 15.4 mikes in brand new shoes, NO Blisters?. 
So, I am trying to keep my mileage at 15 plus a day. I know I do less sometimes but I have to average 13 a day to finish in time.  The problem is the shelters are not spaced 15 miles apart. Today’s shelters were at 11 or 19.6 , I stopped at the 11 but-it was too early and I still had miles in me.  I knew I could not do 20!  I found a hostel at 16.5 and was headed there. I told myself; if I could find a stealth site close to there I would stealth camp, if not I would go to the hostel because they have a tenting option. 
I found a very nice stealth site and I had enough water for dinner, coffee in the morning and maybe oatmeal. I can always walk a little and then eat.  This will be my first night stealth camping alone.  I am just off the trail at a site. There is a makeshift fire pit and probably 3 places for tents. I did have to throw a line a hang my food bag from a tree.


Wildlife update: I did see four or five deer on the way into Hot Springs yesterday.  Someone at the last shelter where I stopped at for a quick break saw a rattle snake today.

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613139,"So stealth camping was a success.  Imagine walking out into the woods a mile or two by yourself, not really knowing where you are and setting up camp. Again, you don’t really know where you are and no one, that cares about you, knows where you are. I was alone last night. The last person I have seen was 4 miles back at the last shelter at 5 pm. I could not have done this until this trip. I tried 3 years ago, and I couldn’t do it. 
I got to start the day with a 6 mile uphill!! 2400 feet over 6 miles. The views were great today.  I climbed over two or three mountains and I got to walk two exposed ridge lines.  There was a fire tower but it was closed to the public.  There were also several meadows I walked through some at elevation and some in the gaps, it is a nice change of scenery. 
At the first shelter I stopped at some hikers were just leaving, it was about 9:30.  I thought it was kind of a late start but they were headed out.  There was another couple there taking a break. So, there was one guy and one girl left in the shelter.  So this is where the Cop comes in.  The guy was young, early 20s. He was talking a mile a minute, unsolicited. He was telling us about his guitar and why he carries it, he was telling us about some guy that stole 143 dollars from him, he was telling us that the guy was homeless.  He was not homeless, he was currently “without a permanent home.” The girl, did not look like she belonged on the trail, I’ll leave it at that.  She added that she was up at 6:30 and was going to start hiking. It’s 930!!! and she was still laying in bed.   So, my point is there are alot of people out here for different reasons, I’m not saying these two, especially the guy were up to no good but my instincts told me so.  I was afraid to leave my pack for a few minutes to get water.  I looked at the exact positioning of my pack, waited until the guy from the couple came back from getting water, and I ran to the water source and back, all was good.  I checked my pack a half mile up the trail and my money and wallet were still there.  It was a beautiful day, with forecast of rain for the next two, through hikers want to move when weather is good. 
The next shelter had a group of younger kids, early 20s that looked like they hiked in to have a good time. I decided to hike on to a hostel that had pizza and beer. There were some warnings on Guthooks about the place but I decided to give it a try.  It was a little creepy. I walked up and there was no one around. There was a sign that said, if no one is here we’ll be back soon. It was like a garage with a pavilion off the front. I looked inside and there wad nobody.  I sat in one of the chairs and two guys walked down from some campers/trailers. The one guy said, hey.  I asked if he was the owner and if he had beer and food? he said yes and directed me to the beer fridge while he start a pizza for me.  Beer selection: PBR, Natural, Busch and Budweiser. As I’m drinking my beer I noticed he’s messing with the gas grill.  The two were pleasant enough.  Did I mention they had four or five signs around about the 2nd amendment and if the first shot doesn’t kill you the second one will?  I realized he was cooking my pizza on the grill, mind you this is NO DiGiorno.  I got a second beer and he served my 3/4 cooked pizza on the box. I asked how many people are staying the night? he said if I stayed it would be just me!!!  I was telling them about my wife and how were doing apart, making stuff up getting them laughing, talking about crime in Chicago.  Then I was like, OK guys I’ve got to press on, I paid my bill and high tailed it out of there.  I found a nice stealth spot a mile up trail. I built a fire and had a hiker meal.  I hit the 300 mile mark today!!!!","Stealth Site mile 290.3

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613217,"I stealth camped last night after my high tailing it out of the last Hostel.  The site was really nice. Close to a stream for water bathing and sound effect. 
It started raining mid morning about 3:00-4:00. It rained and rained. I was hoping it would stop or let up. According to Dark Sky weather app it was going to. I was dry but not for much longer.  I don’t use a ground cover under my tent and I haven’t added any additional waterproofing to it. 
The rain was already splashing mud onto the outside of the tent in spite of the rain fly.  Eventually the ground water started to seep in under my mattress pad and my sleeping bag was half wet.  
I kept checking the weather. My destination was 7 miles or 3-4 hours hiking to the next gap where I could find a hostel. I didn’t think a shelter was going to do much good. I found a shelter and they had room, now to get there. 
I really didn’t want to pack a wet and muddy......everything. I took a nap to see if the rain would let up.  No luck, I had to pack up in the rain. It was a mess everything was splashed with mud.  
I got moving and I didn’t remember the book showing much uphill. But, There was uphill and it took like what seemed forever to get to the only shelter before the gap.  There was one other through hiker there, he didn’t have much to say but we’d meet again.  
This was probably my most miserable day on the trail. I like walking in the rain. I was just not mentally prepared to start in the rain packing up.  My bag weight had to be 4-6 lbs heavier with everything soaked. I do have a new pack cover but it only protects the pack and what’s in it.  My shoes did great until the last 1.5 miles. It was downhill and the tread on these shoes is not as aggressive. Plus the crew had just done trail maintenance and installed stairs. It was between stairs that they had broken up the earth and it was a slippery mud pit. I think too the ground was more red, meaning more clay??? Which I think is more slippery.  
I had two minor falls today. once I stepped with my right foot and it slid left, I fell onto my right side, no damage. The second time I slid on a downhill and almost went head over heels but, I landed on my knee, again no damage.
I finally got to the gap and I called the hostel for a ride, they said they would be right there.  I met Smiles under the bridge, he said he was going to continue on. He asked about my name, I told him Sloth gave it to me. He had met Sloth but, He had not seen Sloth in weeks.  
While I was waiting the, not much to say guy, from the shelter wandered up. I told him I had a hostel picking me up, he got in on that ride. His name us Ace. 
I’m staying at Nature’s Inn Hostel & Cabins. Taft and Sara run a great place, super clean and super laid back.  Everything is on the honors system. You make pizza put it on your tab, you do laundry put it on your tab.  I stayed in the 3 bedroom house.  There were 3 other through hikers I had met a few days ago staying there: little shoe, principal (both retired educators), and a 3rd guy I cannot remember his name.  
I got dried out, laundered, and fed.  Taft even made a beer run, took everyone’s order and made the trip to town.  
Camelback Santa showed up with Strider (she does about 20 miles a day). Everyone else here was not very chatty. 
I finally found some string and made a necklace for two amulets I have been carrying. They have a small amount of ashes in them from Merle and Daisy.

From tent, to pop up, to a hard side and permanent location.  We hiked countless times Up Mirror Mountain, down to Mirror Lake, around Devils Lake, and to the rocks at Sky High. These were just a few of our adventures. The trail was sloppy today. It had rained most of Saturday, all night and most of today.  I wanted to do big miles today 18-23. You learn where to step and where not to, you learn to read the trail and watch others-footprints.  At times you still slip and slide. I saw it coming on a downhill and my feet went right out from under me and I landed on my butt hard. It was really thick sticky mud too. It was on my leg, butt, and hands. I was not injured though. I found a puddle and cleaned off. Not much in the way of views today due to the rain. I did go over two mountain top meadows in the clouds, that was eerily cool.  There was a box on top of one of the mountains that said: trail magic, take one. The box was full of rocks. I’ve come across other “trail magic” boxes.  I have found: garbage, more garbage, the new testament, and garbage.  I have not had much luck with trail magic boxes. I did see an orange salamander today, it did not look real.  I made it to the shelter at about 18 miles and called it quits.  I am sharing the shelter with Smurf and Caveman.  Then a third hiker showed up.  Caveman was watching movies on his phone and hung his phone so we could see, we watched part of Dr. Strange before it started raining so hard you couldn’t hear it.  I keep forgetting to mention; It’s much easier to pick up your pack when you are not standing on the hip strap?","Sam’s Gap-Nature’s Inn Hostel & Cabins

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613694,"Thank you to everyone for your concern over the recent story of the attack and murder on the Appalachian Trail. There was a machete threatening incident near the GA/NC border about the time I was there, about week two.  This second incident happened about week three of my trip. I received an alert on my phone about an “investigation” near mile 600.  I was at mile 300.  Later that day I heard about the attack and murder. I don’t believe I ever met or saw that guy. I do not know if it’s the same guy from both incidents. Most people are worried about me and bears.  People like the machete yielding murderer scare me, not bears. 
I have met some odd people out here but not violent people.  Everyone has been nice, not always friendly, but nice. I keep away from the  crowds, partiers, and druggies. Yes, there are drugs on the trail. I hear of it, but its pretty discreet.  I started out early today. I did 6 miles and stopped at Uncle Johnnys Nolichuoky Hostel for resupply, breakfast, and phone charge. I spent about an hour there and continued. 
The afternoon hike was harder than anticipated. I was kind of in a weird  state. I was just walking along not really into it. I stopped at a shelter and was chatting with a guy, Lumberjack.  He offered me some black truffle sea salt. He had just gotten a bag of it in his resupply. It smelled heavenly.  His wife, Day Glow, then came along, nice couple.  That short break rejuvenated me and I was feeling good again. Then the hills came as they seem to always do late in the day. 
I made it to Beauty Spot. An open meadow area on top of a mountain, similar to Max Patch. There is a road and a parking lot nearby. I was chatting with a couple who were there camping in the lot for the sunrise and sunset.  They were walking their very happy goldendoodle?. The guy told me his name was Ed and if I needed anything they were right there in the parking lot.  I chatted with him for two minutes, and he offers that!  Many good people out here. 
I set up camp and walked a half mile for water. It’s very windy up here and it’s supposed to be in the 30s overnight, but I’m warm. The sunset was nice but not spectacular.  Hopefully sunrise will be good.

I think the sleeping bag I bought for the trip helps and I bought a stocking hat for the trip too, and that really helps. 
I got going just before 8. I knew there was a big climb to start the day.  I was feeling really good, staying hydrated and I hit the wall at mile 13.  I ended at mile 15.3. 
There was a shelter and no one else was there I picked my spot, a penthouse suite. This shelter has room fir 4 on the bottom and two up top.
I met frizzle from Milwaukee, she had noticed my Milwaukee Rd. hat. She is hiking buddies with Chef from LA and they walk together. 
Two guys showed up at the shelter, and I never got their names.  Then a guy named Little Joe showed up, I had met him briefly at Uncle Johnny’s.  Little Joe is a really nice guy and he carries and plays guitar. I had made a fire and he played for us. Several other hikers showed up and pitched tents behind the shelter. 
There was a brief period on top of Unaka Mt. It’s all sprice trees and the ground was all mossy. There was fog in the air and it made for a neat picture.

Last night I did just that to stay warm.  I think I was colder because of the shelter. I think my tent holds heat.  I had a work dream where I was explaining something, I don’t remember what, but I was being suffocated by a piece of fabric. I woke to my head in the sleeping bag. 
Today’s hike was beautiful. There were meadows, balds, pine forest, and many views. There were challenges too like 2200 feet in 5 miles over Roan Mtn.  There is a foundation and chimney up there from an old hotel. 
I met a lady from Great Britain whose name is Ambassador, she is moving along quick, she is here on a Visa.  I also saw Little John, he was playing guitar on top of one of the balds.  I met a guy named Birdman who gave me the brief history of the hotel. At the shelter I caught up with Strider, she is doing 20+ a day. Little Joe was there and alot of other I don’t know. 
Overmountain Shelter is an old barn converted to a shelter. There are about six sleeping spots on the lower level with open views to the South, and a beautiful Valley.  I chose to sleep in the barn loft which is a big open space. 
Wildlife update, I saw a blue bird today. 
Yesterday I hit the wall at mile 13, today was better I took more breaks today. I don’t know if it’s cumulative fatigue, lack of sleep, or not getting enough calories. 
Strider just got a huge bag of trail mix, She offered me some. It’s mostly candy and nuts. Oh my it is SOOOO good. I can save my Snickers bar for tomorrow.

Today’s hike was by far the most pleasurable. I walked over mountain balds with spectacular views, through meadows, along rivers, and through pine forest. I felt great and was in a good mood. 
At one point I was walking along and the trail ended, that’s usually not good.  I walked a little more in the tall grass and found a post with a white blaze on it. So, being the purists I then walked south on the trail until I found where I had taken the wrong turn. Of course there were a bunch of branches across the path, I had stepped right over them. I think I must have been reveling in the fact I had just seen someone painting white blazes onto the trees. There are approximately 165,000 blazes along the trail. I was impressed to have actually seen someone painting them.  I thanked them for maintaining the trail as most of the maintainers are volunteers. 
Later I ran into Ambassador slack packing, She said it was wonderful. I may do some slack packing Saturday and Sunday as Seaneen will be in town, and it’s trail days.
I was walking along a river today and thought it might be nice to soak my feet. The water was crystal clear and ankle deep. I waded in to the middle with my washcloth and took a river bath. 
I felt good today and still had energy late in the day in spite of the climbs. I reached a shelter at mile 18. I got water and felt like continuing.  I reached mile 19 and the tent site was un exciting. I decided to make it a 20 mile day and stealth camp somewhere. 
I was cruising along about mile 21 and was thinking this might turn into a marathon but I was getting tired.  I then saw four men walking toward me. One or two of them had beers, obviously not through hikers.  They asked if I was through hiking and where I was staying?  I said yes and I was looking for s place to stealth camp.  They said, stay at Scotty’s.  ???? They said it’s .25 miles off the trail right there, the grill is warm, there is steak in the white cooler, grill one up we’ll be back in 30.  Also, that is Scotty, guy number 3 in the line.  I said you guys are life savers. 
I walked down a side trail, found the grill, found the steak, and found a beer.  I later learned they are all former through hikers.  Scotty is from Streamwood IL and Backdraft was an Oaklawn, IL firefighter. I was not planning on staying at a hostel but things happen for a reason. 
I think hiker hunger has set in. I had usual 2 oatmeals for breakfast and a Clif Bar for mid morning snack.  I stopped at a hostel for lunch. The food wagon was closed so I had:
4-5 chocolate chip cookies
4-5 Cookie/brownie bars
1 bag lays barbecue chips
1 mountain house granola with berries 
2 string cheese 
16oz fruit/energy drink
Maybe that’s why I still had energy late in the day.

I did gat a chance to talk to her.Yesterday I saw a downed tree that had been cut to clear the trail. I was going to try and figure it out it’s age by counting a few inches of rings and calculating. I looked closer at the tree and someone had already done it. The tree was approximately “born” in 1600 and died 2000 something. 400 years old!!!! I slept well and I found eggs in the hostel common area fridge. Anything left in the fridge is open game. I made four eggs, found some toast, made two pieces, and threw some unopened salsa in to boot. I thought today was going to be lighter as I did more than half of what I needed to yesterday.  I was wrong. I had 12.6 to do and most was supposed to be downhill. Today was hard and uneventful, with marginal views. My legs reminded me at every slight incline that I had done 21.3 miles yesterday. They were tired! I had one hostel mate, Running Bear, a 58 year old gentleman from Germany. He is really skinny and tells me has run multiple marathons and triathlons. He also is an ultralight packer at about 15 lbs. He was doing 25+ a day and injured himself. He says he’s a physical therapist. You’d think he’d know to listen to his body. He’s taking a couple zero to see if he mends. The main thing I had to look forward to today is Seaneen is driving in and bringing Luci❤️❤️❤️. I was barely making it and felt exhausted. I heard some hiking poles clicking together ahead of me. That’s usually a sign of a hiker warning of their presence to others, or warning of something else.  I noticed it was Ambassador. I shouted; what are you making all of that noise for? She said she just saw two of the cutest bear cubs and was not wanting to see Momma bear. We continued onward cautiously. Ambassador pointed to where she last saw them and the direction of their departure. I ended up seeing one cub and Mama way up on the hill. Bears are beautiful creatures, a black that cannot be described. Mom moved with such grace for being such a big animal. The bear sighting made mine and Ambassador’s day?. I walked and talked with her for about 20 minutes, then I could not keep up and she continued on, slackpacking. I finally made it to Black Bear Resort. I had a pizza, Pepsi, and 16 oz Corona. I threw my laundry in and took a shower. I met a new person on the trail today: Mary Jane or  trail name Mar Jung. Her husband is picking her up at Black Bear, she hasn’t seen him since March 19th. Seaneen and Luci, my dog arrived at 545.  We went for barbecue dinner and then both of us passed out exhausted in a hotel bed?.

Luci was full of energy and wanted to play fetch, little did she know.We had approximately 5 miles left to go and the downhill started.  We were walking along and came across a NOBO hiker who had a dog, or as she said the dog had been following her for about 4 miles, but it was not her dog.  We kind of laughed and then it started following us, Luci was not too happy.  The dog followed us for about two miles until another couple came along going NOBE with a dog, and then she started following them. :) Near the bottom of the decline we started following a small river.  We stopped and soaked our feet and Luci played in the water.  There was a waterfall up ahead and we headed for it.  The waterfall was much larger and prettier than we had expected. From the waterfall to the Black bear was approximately a mile.  The first quarter mile out of the waterfall was straight up rock stairs for 300 feet.  When you get to the road it is another .4 miles down a road in the direct sun to the Black Bear.Seaneen got a good taste of the trail today.  Incline, decline, stream crossing, stream drinking, bugs, sweat, dirt, and hiker meals. Seaneen is going home tomorrow, I could not convince her to stay and walk with me.  When we got back to the hotel Luci crashed, I don’t think she wants to stay walk every day with me either.Wildlife update, we say two snakes today.  The first one was small and Luci stepped on it.  Neither the snake or Luci minded.  The second one was a black snake about 4 feet long.","Shook Branch Recreation Area

I got to the road crossing and saw a poster: Free hiker feed all day Saturday May 25, I looked at my phone and realized that’s today! It was 5 miles up the trail, I now had a goal. Walking in the early hours allows you to watch the forest wake up, the sun is coming in at a low angle and it’s still cool. Today was a beautiful day, and the sky was clear. Approximately 1.5 miles from the first shelter I saw a bear, the first one I have found, and seen on my own. It was rather far down a ravine.  I then saw two cubs, and I wanted to get no more near.  I clapped two rocks together and mamma took her cubs and left the area. I am still in awe of their beauty. The way their black contrast the green of the forest.I made it to the roadway and saw a sign pointing to the church hosting the feed. I started walking the .8 miles. The sign said there would be shuttles. I figured if the shuttle came along they would pick me up. A church member stopped and picked me up within two minutes.  At the feed they had Barbecue pork, hotdogs, salads, beans, a whole table of desserts, drinks, and another table of items for hikers to take like: snacks, band aids, hygiene products, etc. What a display of kindness from Valley View Baptist Church AT Hiker Ministry. I relaxed there for about 1.5 hours. Of course I ate too much. I have not had phone signal since 3pm yesterday.  About 2 hours into my afternoon hike I was getting upset. It was hot and humid, I was climbing again, and I hadn’t talked to Seaneen since yesterday. I finally got a signal about 2 pm and was able to talk to her. My feet were starting to hurt again, but I still had miles I wanted to do. I got to the next shelter, and didn’t care for the crowd. Certain shelters are either close to a trail town or have amenities others do not. This one is sort of close to a town, you can have pizza delivered. There is also a shower, bathroom, water, and a place to charge your phone. These amenities keep “hikers” staying there for extended days. The water source is about .2 miles from the shelter, near the welcome center. As I was getting water, three police cars pulled in, two had dogs. They were all business. I did my own thing. One police officer came over the me after a few minutes and asked me my trail name, I said Viking, who are you looking for. They were looking for Cherokee. I hadn’t heard that name yet. I finished my water filling and told the officers to Stay Safe. Cherokee must be a tall thin very handsome blonde guy-just saying.I walked another 2 miles and found an excellent stealth site. I built a fire ring and stacked up a teepee fire, but never lit it. Trail magic for the next person. Wildlife update: Mama Bear and two Cubs, cows, a dog named rasin, and a toad.","Stealth camping - 520.0

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614719,"I am starting in the middle of my day. I had eaten lunch and gone across the street to get an ice cream. I re-entered the trail about a quarter mile down the highway. I entered into a beautiful meadow with tall grass. I was kind of expecting Laura Ingles to come running over the hill, from Little House on the Prairie.  Two hikers passed me: Kentucky and Jeff. I commented to them; people ask why we do this, “this is why we’re out here.” As you leave the meadow you have to climb stairs over a barbed wire fence. I noticed they had stopped to look at something and I was wondering what? I climbed the fence and saw a makeshift memorial for Robert Sanchez Jr. “Strong Hold” the hiker who was killed. I paused and almost started crying. I continued on and could not help but think. Was he having those same thoughts about the trail and the meadow. Was the trail clearing his mind and focusing him, helping with his PTSD? He had no idea what lay ahead for him. A victim of someone else’s struggles.???I  started out early today because I love hiking in the morning. There was a very light fog in area and the sun was casting rays through it making the morning more spectacular.  I had heard there was an old school house along the trail that had trail magic.  Sure enough, I came across this cute little one room school house. Inside they had three boxes. One with toiletries items, and the other two with snacks and a little fruit. There was also two coolers with ice and sodas. I had my mind set on Sunday buffet at the Barn restaurant 2.5 miles up the trail. I stocked up on a few things and had a soda. I always feel guilty taking free stuff but they supply it out of kindness and compassion. So I took what I needed and could use. In walked Longfeather, we caught up for a few minutes. I made it to the Barn, no buffet or breakfast. I had a burger and a salad. I had another 10 miles to go on top of the 9 I had done before lunch. My heel blisters still hurt and it’s affecting my gait, which causes other aches. I got to the Quarter Way Inn about 6:00. What a cute place, old converted farm house. They ask for ID, 1st hostel to do so. I like that, it keeps the riff raff away. I got a shower and shave. I soaked my feet in Epsom Salt water. The place is Clean. I colored while watching movies. Everyone staying here is nice. Story time, There was no forecast of rain last night and it was supposed to be cool but not cold. I had left the rain fly off of the tent to have cool air and look at the stars. I was sleeping or about to sleep  when the wind picked up and I felt a few drops of rain. Neither weather app warned of showers as they are supposed to. It started raining harder but not hard. Picture this: 49.75 year old, lily white guy, wearing fluorescent orange underwear and black Crocs with a headlamp on (and nothing else) running around his tent in the dark, wind, and rain storm trying to put a rain fly on his tent. When completed I jumped back in the tent and had 15-20 various bugs flying around in my tent. I was trying to shoo them out but more would come in because of the light. I had to kill them. I was trying to see them with the headlamp on and they kept buzzing around my face and the light. One of them bit/stung me on the arm. I killed all of the bugs in my tent. Then the ones trapped in between the rain fly and tent were going ballistic trying to get in. Wildlife update: Snake and a field mouse.","Stealth camping - 536.4

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614720,"Today started out great with gourmet breakfast at the Quarter Way Inn. I settled my bill and hit the road. As I was walking down the road to the trail a deer jumped out of the tree line and ran down the road. The first mile or so was a walk through a meadow/pasture. There were several cows in the area, they just looked at me and kept doing their cows stuff. Eventually I entered the woods again. Two hikers from the hostel passed me, Hiccup and Sherpa. I heard some younger voices ahead on the trail, and I passed Sherpa and Hiccup getting water. I rounded a corner and saw two tables full of food on the trail. I turned and told Sherpa snd Hiccup there was either trail magic or a family picnic just ahead. There was a family that woke up at 330 in the morning to drive to that location to set up trail magic. They had soda, water, orange juice, yogurt, fruit, baked goods and stuff in ziplocks for the road. They want to walk the AT in a few years when the husband retires. They wanted to pay it forward now!!! I had a few things as I was full from breakfast. I was walking along and I got lost in my thoughts, and BAM a huge black snake on the trail. I let out a pretty big AHHHHHH,UHHHH, and I cursed him. At least he was moving off of the trail. A bit later I had a deer run across the trail from a stream. I knew I had a big climb coming late in the day. It kind of started at 100-130.  and kicked into high gear at 200. It was one of the more steep climbs but, near the top it was bald or meadow and I stopped and had a snack enjoying the view. On the way up I saw what I believe was a bobcat. I had stopped and sat on a log. When I got up and turned up trail a cat walked onto the trail about 20 feet in front of me. It turned and looked at me and took off fast. I made it to the top of Chestnut Knob. I climbed for 2.5 hours, not including the break. The shelter was nice, stone and fully enclosed. I wanted to continue a few more miles.I met a hiker named Hat Trick, he wears 3 hats. I was getting really tired and it was 600. I found a stealth spot wit two guys I have been leapfrogging all day, Sparrow and No Dice. I made my meal and crawled into my tent. There are cows somewhere below us as I am hearing them moo.I weighed myself this morning, down 1 pound. I think I got my weight to level off for now. Wildlife update: two separate deer, bobcat, cows and a black snake.","Quarter Way Inn

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614851,"We have not had substantial rain in quite a few days and the water sources are drying up. I cameled up (loaded up with water) before I got to camp last night. I had plenty of water for dinner and breakfast with some left over to start the hike. The first two sources before the first shelter were dry but the source at the shelter was flowing.  A fellow hiker described the privy at the shelter as a scene from the Exorcist, I avoided it. 
There was talk of trail magic four miles up the trail. I got to the place where the magic was supposed to be and: Legs, Marathon, Sherpa, Hiccup, and a few others were in the creek cooling off and eating, no trail magic.  I had a tuna, cameled up and continued. I crossed the road and 100 feet into the woods I saw a picnic tent to the left through the trees. It was the Trail Magic!!!! We all stopped. I had a cheeseburger, 2 hotdogs, beans, 3 cookies, and a coke. I took a banana 2 string cheese, and 2 cheese blocks to go. This church is doing four days of this, and they do breakfast too. 
We were all full and wanted to get to a small grocery store, I needed a few things. This afternoon was hot. I was looking forward to another cold drink, I had decided a gatorade, then coke. I was trying to get through the heat so I started texting friends. A friend Billy called and we talked for over an hour, the miles were flying by but I realized I wasn’t drinking water. I stopped and drank 3/4 of a liter.  
I was moving really quick and I made it to the grocery at 520, they close at 600.  Everyone was sitting out front, store was closed - 400 for a funeral. I had a little water still and the next water source had warnings “do not drink” dead deer in water. I had to walk on the road in direct sunlight at 530, in the heat for 1.5 miles. I got to the water and it reeked of death in the area. 
I started the 2 mile uphill to the shelter. When I got to the shelter there were tents everywhere but no one in the shelter. I set up in the shelter. I have not seen this many tents in one area in a long time. Water was a looooonnnggg .2 downhill. I loaded up and made dinner. I decided I may need water when I head out in the morning. There were (2) 1 gallon jugs in the shelter. I took them down and filled them. 
There is a younger guy staying in the shelter, he’s on his phone arguing about problems 100s of miles away. Then a 50 something lady comes to the picnic table with two high school aged girls. I can tell she’s obviously teaching them about hiking. This guy and his buddy are dropping the f-bomb, and waving dope around like their hanging with their buddies. Do some people not have a clue or just no respect for women or girls. 
The older lady’s dog was wandering around. I started to smell poop really bad! I was freaking out thinking it was me. It was the dog, the dog had went and found someone’s poop and rolled in it. Good thing I got the two gallons of water.

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614978,"I did not sleep good last night.  I made a decision to sleep in the shelter before thinking about it. I was sweaty and dirty. I had not thought about the bugs. I laid in the shelter and was concerned about the bugs. Every time I turned on my headlamp I was surrounded by them. From now on I will sleep in my tent with the screen. I was able to clean myself but it didn’t help. I was up until after midnight and I woke up at 515. The morning hike was nice. About 45 minutes into the hike I saw a bear 50 feet in front of me, on the trail. It saw me before I saw it and it turned and ran off. I wanted to get to Trents Grocery today to get a shower and then re-access before I went on. I was tired today and was just going through the motions. It was hot and humid today, I’m not complaining. I made it to Trents as the severe weather warnings started. I decided to stay at Trents and camp. The camp grounds have a bath and shower house. They also have electric to charge phones. I got my tent up and the storms were coming. I went over to where the other campers/hikers were hanging out and asked for a beer. Guitarhead gave me a beer. He then said we are all headed to the laundry room to wait the storm out. So, I was hanging out in a 5X10 laundry room with 5 other guys drinking Natural Light. When the rain let up I walked back to the grocery store and bought a six pack and a 15 pack. Paying it back for the beers bought for me the other night. The Trail gives when you need it, and you give when you can. I was invited to play some hacky sack. 50 year old hiking hips don’t like hacky sack. I did get a shower and my tent is dry on the inside. They made another beer run later, I paid for a 30 pack of Natural Lights, again paying it forward.

I got a little later start than I wanted, 815. I had a half mile walk back to the trail. I was feeling good, the weather was cool, and the terrain was favorable. I was going to shoot for 26.2, or more today. The Marathon!! I stopped to see Dismal Falls. Many hikers stayed there last night. The hike was pleasant today. There was one good incline and a few small ones. The scenery was nice and there were a few views. At 430 I made the decision to go all in for the Marathon. I ran out of water at some point late in the day, and had to go .2 miles off trail to find some. I saw Longfeather. I walked into Pearisburg VA at 830 and got a room.

I woke up feeling good after my marathon. I did not find a restaurant on Yelp so I had breakfast at Hardees. Not my best breakfast. I then went to the Food Lion for resupply. I ran into several hikers from the trail. Back at the motel I saw Legs and Marathon. I cleaned up and shaved. I packed and headed out at 1000 knowing today was going to be a shorter day. It was a mile road walk back to the trail. Once on the trail it warmed up very quick. I also had a sizable climb. It was damp from rain last night and humid. About 3/4 of the way up the climb I started getting rain alerts. Then I heard what I believe was a tornado siren. I checked my phone weather apps and could not see anything. How do you call your spouse and say, “don’t worry, but...” I hear tornado sirens, I’m in the middle of the woods, It’s not raining or windy, and there’s a cave I can go into if I need to. But, can you check the radar?
Neither of us found any storms. I made it the next 1.2 miles to water and the shelter.  I hung out, ate, and was going to look at the guide and the radar. The storm hit about 25 minutes later and it STORMED. I had almost continued thinking the storm was going to just miss us. I then decided I was calling it a day and staying.

 We are under Severe Thunderstorm Watch until 1100. There are several guys here that I have met: Longfeather, Square Peg, Cowboy, Jar Head, and One Gear. There are others I do not know. The shelter is full and there are people tenting around the shelter.

I think he’d been hiking in the rain. I looked at the radar and this particular rain was moving in from the northeast, the exact opposite of last night’s storm. It’s going to be a wet day. The clouds are literally blowing into the shelter and everything is damp.
I got started at 800 and it was very wet. I hiked for at least two hours in the clouds. I set out with no particular goal. I had no Idea how far the next shelter was. I stopped after two hours and got the mileage to the next shelter and the one after. 
I saw 4-5 deer running, three stopped and stared at me. About another mile later I saw another deer. I was not motivated this morning, I was just going through the motions. After stopping at the first shelter I felt better except there was a huge climb coming.  Before the climb started I heard some rustling in the leaves. I saw a baby deer (fawn) about a foot tall. It was about 100 feet off the trail. I stopped to take a picture. Mama saw me and wasn’t happy. She started hissing at me, stared, and stomped at me. I moved along.

At the second shelter I looked at my books and decided to hike a few more miles to Wind Rock because there was supposed to be a great view for sunrise and sunset. I made it to the campsite at Wind Rock. I met a couple section hikers who were sectioning with a through hiker relative. I was offered a piece of steak, and of course I jumped on that! The guys are from outside Detroit and Lockport, IL. The extra miles for the view were worth it. The sunset was great and I’m looking forward to seeing the sunrise.

I opened my tent to see if I could see stars, and I could. I got dressed and walked up to wind rock. The stars were out and you could see the Milky Way.  The giggly group had two cameras they were positioning and kept shining a large flashlight. I still enjoyed the view. I felt sorry for Mudflap his hammock was set up right there.
 I set my alarm to see the sunrise, and I’m glad I did. It was the kind of sunrise that the sun is just a big orange ball and you can look at it without hurting your eyes. 
I packed up and said goodbye. Cowboy and SquarePeg showed up as I was leaving. I ended up leapfrogging them all day. I saw deer running right at the start of my hike. I had to use the bathroom and barely made it to the next shelter. There I ran into Caveman, and met Rainier & Skydog. I had seen Rainier’s entries in shelter books. She was getting off trail for a few days to rest her Achilles. 
I was not feeling it again today and there was another decent climb midday. I met an old guy section hiking SB, I noticed his pack was rather large and he said don’t tell anyone, I’m trying to find a place to dump a body. His name was: What’s the Rush. 
I got to the second shelter and decided to push another 4 miles. I met High Pockets. Hiker Square Peg asked a couple of us to help pack out some trash he had found at the shelter. I had lost my garbage bag at the last shelter, I think. In my hurry to get to the privy and pulling out my TP I think my garbage bag fell on the ground.

I have heard of the 5 pieces of trash a day, where you pick up five pieces of trash and carry it out. I was good at this the first 2-3 weeks but I kind of stopped doing it. Square Peg’s reminder will get me doing it again. 
The end of today’s hike was meadow/pasture. I’m stealth camping in the woods near a stream. I took a bath in the stream. At one point I was buck naked, or Chuck naked, in the middle of the stream right next to the trail. Good thing no-one came by.I don’t think I’m getting enough calories again!

I woke and got packed and on trail by 730. Cowboy & Square Peg passed as I was packing. We leapfrogged all morning. 1st stop was Keffer Oak. It’s the largest Oak tree on the AT in the south 18’ around and over 300 years old. We then passed the Bruisers Knob Cairns. The Cairns are stone piles at the top of the Knob. I did a little research and no one is really for sure what they are; who built them; or why. The best answer is, they are probably graves for American Indians. Some were more neatly assembled than others. I will try and upload some pictures. I then stopped and visited the Audie Murphy Monument, he was the most decorated American Soldier of WWII.
I was walking along and heard rustling in the leaves. The trail was rather wide here like a roadway.  All of the sudden something darted out of the leaves and at me. It scared me but not bad because I immediately recognized it as a bird. It was some kind of quail or hen. It had a tail like a turkey but, was much smaller. It circled a few times then ran off. I met a SOBO hiker who told me there was trail magic at the next parking lot. I got there and there was a cooler full of sodas and ice, courtesy of Kringle. I had one Coke.  It tasted so good. I met another guy from Ohio named Schleprock, He started back in February and is doing 8-10 miles a day. Mid afternoon I had a long gradual climb, as I was coming down the backside late afternoon, I saw some campers. As I got closer I noticed it was Melody, I was smiling ear to ear. She turned and saw me and was completely surprised! She was with a guy and a girl . Turns out the guy lives down the street and comes regularly to the trailhead and gives hikers beers. He gave me a Bud Light. I drank my beer and chatted with Melody and Luanne, Melody’s friend, for about 20 minutes. I asked Melody if she had a trail name yet, she said no. I told her I’m going to start calling her Ginger Bread. Because I run and run as fast as I can and I can’t catch her. Her friend Luanne liked it,We’ll see if it sticks. Luanne gave me a Nature Valley and Cliff bar. They told me of more trail magic in the creek across the road. A lady had put Cokes and bottled water in the creek for hikers. I had a Coke. As I was walking away I heard Melody say to Luanne, “he’s such a nice guy.” I was on cloud nine: Seeing a hiking friend, beer, coke, and a genuine compliment. I had so much energy I pretty much ran up the next 1/2 mile hill. I had a plan to get to a place called Dragons Tooth. There are supposed to be great views there. It was another 4 miles and it was already coming up on 600. I read on a Guthook comment there was water .3 north of the shelter, the shelter was .5 off trail. There was not even a hint of water north of the shelter on trail. Lesson, don’t trust people on Guthooks. Most of the last two miles was uphill and rocky as I was walking a ridge line.  I remember not to long ago after walking an 8 hour day I could barely put one foot in front of another at the end of the day on a climb. I walked 13 hours today without much break, and I was still powering up the hill at 8pm. There is an area called ledges which is basically cliffs with views to the east. I made it to Dragons Tooth at 815, just before sunset. Dragons Tooth is big rocks sticking up out of the top of the mountain. I climbed them and stood on them to see the sunset over the trees. I set up my tent and prepped dinner. I had two cups of water and two Ramen Noodles. Each Ramen takes two cups of water. I figured I’ll try. Well, in setting up the tent I knocked over the pot spilling most of the water. I heated them a little and they actually were OK. I had two slip and falls today. My shoes are fast approaching end of life and the tread is worn down. The ground is extremely dry and on the downhills sometimes there are fields of pebbles, like marbles. Both times one foot took off and the next thing I’m on my Butt hard. Both times I had gravel in my palms. No scrapes or cuts though. The second one made my wrist hurt for a while.

I did not sleep very well last night. I was sticky and out of water, which means pretty much out of food too. I set an alarm to see the sunrise but I was up prior to that. I got dressed and climbed Dragons Tooth to see an incredible sunrise. The hike down was steep and probably one of the most technical so far. The views were very nice. I walked the 3.5 miles to the grocery store where I had breakfast, charged my phone, and resupplied. I stayed there way too long and I talked to Ahh Kash, locals, and other hikers for a while. Back on the trail I washed my underwear in the creek and hung them on the outside of my pack to dry. I walked through several meadows eary today which I like. There are so many butterflies in this area, and so many different types. The day was warming up and I took many breaks and chatted with many hikers. At one of the road crossings I saw a short bus converted to a camper and I stopped to check it out. It was Odie, he publishes the Hiker Yearbook. He was doing trail magic. I had two Krispy Kreme glazed doughnuts and stocked up on water. I stopped at the next two shelters and snacked. I made it to McAfee knob for some photos around 5pm, later than I wanted. The next shelter was 1 mile, and the one after was 6. Another 3 hours of hiking would have been hiking until 8pm. I didn’t have it in me and you are not supposed to stealth camp in this area. So I pitched a tent at Pig Farm Campsite/Campbell Shelter. There was a deer hanging out about 10 feet from me eating while I was setting up my tent. I didn’t even notice her at first. She finally got spooked and ran off. She was back in camp later. I met Roadrunner, and I saw Hiccups, Sherpa, Flying Fish, and Skitch both Japanese Hikers.

I had eaten two dinners and I decided to eat twice the breakfast. The hike today was going to be about 15 miles because I pulled up short last night. I really wanted to do 9 into Daleville, get shoes, maybe a shower, and keep moving. But I’m doing the 15 miles. I got on trail at 715, normal time. Many hikers were already gone and others were packing up. It seemed everyone was trying to get to town as fast as possible because the forecast is calling for rain. There were some cliffs with views and I got some good pictures. I lost my water bottle on the cliffs. My carbiner wasn’t closing properly and it must have fallen off when I set my bag down. That’s the second water bottle I’ve lost on this trip. One of the views was back to McAfee Knob. It always amazes me when you look across the horizon and see something that looks so distant, and you are like: I was there 4 hours ago. It seemed as though it took me a long time to get to the first shelter. I met and chatted with Choo Choo. She had been at Campbell shelter last night and was trying to get to Daleville. She has foot issues and is on her 5th pair of shoes. Her feet start hurting at 10 miles and she had 15 miles to do today. I don’t know if she made it to town. I set out from the shelter, still 9 miles to town. There was light rain off and on. The 9 miles seemed to take forever. Usually heading into town you have a steady slight downhill and sometimes there’s steep downhill mixed in. The trip into Daleville was not downhill. It was, but it seemed there was more uphill mixed into to slight downhill. I had many slip and near falls, and a few slip and minor falls. Ugh, I need new shoes. I had thought to my self about two weeks ago, these shoes have no life left in them, no bounce. Then the slipping started. I’ll be looking for new shoes at about 450 miles next time. At some point I decided I was going to break down and get a hotel room in Daleville. Another hiker had offered to let me shower in his room, and possibly split a room. He backed down on his offer. Then he offered for me to possibly split with another hiker, and he rescinded his offer too. I have the means to get my own room. Many of the hikers are on budgets and split rooms to save money, I was basically going to split to help them out. Also, I had a female hiker who I think was hinting she needed someone to split a room with. But, I was not going to say, hey, I’ll spit one with you. I am not at that point yet. Also, I really like my privacy. That’s my rejuvenation time. Right before town I crossed some railroad tracks and there were little toads jumping all around, dozens of them the size of dimes. A quarter mile later I crossed a stream on a foot bridge and there was a deer standing in the stream drinking. I got to town about 3. I checked in to the hotel and washed my feet and put on fresh socks. I threw my current socks away. I walked to the outfitters and bought new shoes and socks. I then went to the grocery and bought pink sea salt bath soak and a 6 pack. Walking back to the room in my new shoes was refreshing. My legs felt great. I was preparing the bath and something stunk, I couldn’t figure it out at first, it was my old socks in the garbage. I had to move the garbage can out of the bathroom. I took a long hot bath with the sea salt, and caught up with people like my nephew and my mom.  I went to a Mexican restaurant for dinner. I did laundry and chatted with Postman. He is walking SOBO, so many NOBOs have him deliver messages to friends that are behind them that Postman will see. I got to bed early. I forgot to mention yesterday I had my first blood producing injury. I was walking to get water and drinking water with my head tilted back. A stump jumped out of the grass/weeds and bit my shin. I washed it in the stream and put a bandaid on it. Wildlife update: Toads, squirrels, and deer.","Campbell Shelter- Pig Farm Campsite

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615733,"I woke well rested and in a hotel bed. I made it to the lobby for breakfast and had a hotel waffle and some cereal.  There are many hikers in the hotel and Ahh Kash joined me for a while. I also met Tadpole an Puma. 
I got back on the trail at 814. My original plan was to hike to Bearwallow gap, 20 miles.  I knew I would be in touch with Seaneen throughout the day and we would coordinate a pickup location as she was driving in from home. 
Looking at the AWOL and Guthooks the day didn’t look too bad after the initial accent out of town.  I saw a hiker I had not seen since before Hot Springs, Mountain Sage.  He is an older guy with long hair and many tattoos. He hikes with no shirt on and makes really good mile.  I was happy to see him and we exchanged pleasantries.  I made good time up the initial hill, and stopped at the first shelter to take a break and eat a little.  Someone had left a note that there was a rattlesnake in the area.  I have not seen a rattlesnake yet. 
After the shelter and initial climb I thought the trail was going to level off with small ups and downs.  I was wrong it leveled off but with 500 ft ups and downs. On the way to the next shelter I saw several hikers taking a break. I noticed one of the hikers was carrying a hardback book. It was about 2.5 inches thick.  I commented on it and he says he makes it through a book pretty quick, and normally doesn’t carry a hardback but he found this one at a hostel and liked it. 
I saw a deer while getting water prior to the 2nd shelter.  I stopped at shelter #2 and took a break and ate a little more food.  I touched base with Seaneen and it was decided I would meet her at Harvey’s Knob overlooks 4.1 miles and approximately 2 hours away.  Seaneen was 2.5 hours away but I did not have enough time to make it further. On my way to Harvey’s I saw the Ravens.  I had noticed in some of the shelter books that I was close behind them.  It was good to see them and I chatted with them for about 15 minutes. They are doing well and staying healthy.  They celebrated the daughter’s birthday in Daleville.  
I continued on and made it to Harvey’s Knob at 4 pm.  Seaneen and Luci arrived just after 5 pm. While waiting I chatted with a guy and his son.  They were from Indiana, he had a boilermakers shirt on.  He is bicycling the Blue Ridge Parkway, and his son is doing support for him. Another bicyclist stopped and asked if I could take his picture with the mountains in the background.  He is also bicycling the Blue Ridge Parkway and is doing approximately 100 miles a day. 
We made it to the hotel quick.  Seaneen said I stink.  I don't think I stink, at least not that bad.  I had showered the night before and had washed all of my clothes.  FYI, you don’t wear deodorant or cologne on the trail, it’s useless. I showered and washed my clothes at the motel, we went to dinner, and then we both crashed as we were exhausted.

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615757,"I slept in a motel last night and ate dinner at a restaurant with Seaneen. Having simple amenities and having Seaneen here makes a huge difference to my mental outlook. I woke well rested and took a shower.  We went to breakfast and I cleaned my plate and Seaneen’s. We looked in Buchanan for an outfitter just to check it out and there was not one. 


Back at the motel we came up with a game plan for the day.  I was going to get dropped off at Harvey’s Knob. I was going to Slackpack-Run/Jog to Jennings Creek.  Seaneen would pick me up there. I got dressed and loaded a Camelback.  It is weird only having a liter and a half of water and nothing else on my back.  Seaneen dropped me off at the gap and Luci and I set out into the woods.  I got 10 feet in and Luci saw an oncoming hiker and went ballistic - that guy is not supposed to be there!!!  It was Ahh Kash.  I stopped Seaneen and introduced Ahh Kash to Seaneen. Ahh Kash was slackpacking SOBO, back to Daleville.  I started out strong and after a few I started walking on the uphills.  


The first 4 miles went well, the second 4 miles was more uphill, and the last 4 miles was pretty much downhill. Every time Luci saw a hiker on the trail she got very defensive of me and barked and growled at them.  I stopped at the second shelter and there were three hikers there, Luci was pretty much disinterested in them.  One of the hikers stood up and Luci growled at him.  I continued on and got to the last four miles and started to pick up the pace.  I had my phone on and had my Map my Rumn app activated.  When I got to two miles out I figured I could do the 12.1 miles in under 3 hours but, I would have to pick up the pace.  I was flying the last two miles downhill.  I was thinking, if Seaneen saw me she would say something like: “you need to slow down, you are going to fall and break you leg.” I was loving it, my legs felt great and I was hopping and skipping over rocks, stumps, and steps.  I got to the parking lot in 2:59:58.  


As I was finishing I saw a pop up tent/canopy.  Hmmmm trail magic??? It was TRAIL MAGIC.  A former through hiker named Dingo was camping at the campgrounds down the street and set up Trail Magic for the day, and tomorrow.  He cooked me a grilled cheese with tomato and ham on it!  We stayed and talked to him and his wife for about 20 minutes.  


Just a note, Hiking Legs do not translate to Running Legs.  I felt good for the most part but I thought I would have felt better with all of the hiking I’ve been doing and the loss of 20lbs. Normally 12 miles of hiking takes me at least 6 hours, I was able to run/jog 12 miles in 3 hours.  I went back to the motel and took a bath.  After my bath I washed my my backpack in the the shower.  The water turned brown ; (  I knew my pack was dirty and I knew it stunk but, WOW. 


12.1 miles is the longest Luci has ever run and she has pretty much been sleeping since we got back.


Seaneen took me to dinner in Lexington VA, I ate everything, and we had dessert too.

I did some calculations into the next week as Seaneen is going home Sunday and Rick is arriving Tuesday night. I had originally planned to meet Rick at mile 863 but, I am only going to make it to mile 824 by Tuesday night. We will be 40 miles, or just over two days from the Shenandoah’s.  He and I will work it out. I went through my food supply and I am set for the next three days. I have to re-pack my backpack today as I emptied it and washed it.  It looks cleaner but still has a little odor to it. The plan for today was to wait out the rain; get 10 miles in; and relax before being dropped off at the trail tomorrow morning. Sunday’s weather is supposed to be alright. Monday’s weather is calling for rain all day.  We went to the Pink Cadillac diner for breakfast, a 50s Elvis themed diner. It was cute and the breakfast was good. Back at the motel I kept looking at the weather on two different apps. The forecast wasn’t changing and it wasn’t getting better.  I wanted to get the 10 miles in and do it downhill so I don’t have to walk those 10 miles uphill tomorrow with a backpack on.  We set out and got to the drop off point.  It was pouring and I saw 5 hikers huddled under a sign pavilion.  They were waiting for a shuttle ride and we were not it.  I looked at the Guthook app and realized we were in the wrong spot, 18 miles from the pick up point. We were only supposed to be 11 something.  We drove to the correct drop off spot and I got out.  It was barely raining and I set out.  I saw Skitch, Ginger Bread, Sherpa, Hiccup, Mudflap, and I met Militant Buddhist.  I stopped at the second shelter and signed the book. I had just under three miles left and I knew the first of the last three was uphill. My legs felt good but I could tell I had run 12 yesterday.  The uphill was tough.  On the way down I saw a deer.  The deer was about 10 feet off the trail and it just looked at me as I jogged by. I made it in about 3 hours and 15 minutes.  We went back to the motel, I showered and we went to Ballast Point Brewery for dinner. Back at the motel Seaneen and I cut my hair.  It is the shortest it’s been in a long time.  Seaneen is my true Trail Angel.

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615951,"This morning I woke to the alarm clock. We had to get moving early so Seaneen could get on the road. We packed, showered, and hit the gas station across the street. It was overcast, cool, and drizzling. We had a 1/2 hour drive up to the Blue Ridge Parkway to the drop off point. As we were driving up the Mtn. to the Pkwy. I said we will soon be in the clouds. Sure enough the last 10 miles was in the clouds/fog. Seaneen dropped me off, we said our goodbyes, and I got one more Luci kiss. I headed into the woods and Seaneen headed toward home. I had 10-12 hours of hiking and she driving. I started at 645. It was drizzling. When I got into the woods it started raining, then pouring, then pouring sideways. Then it would switch between these forms of rain for pretty much the rest of the day minus 2 hours. I stopped at the 1st shelter to put on another jacket and use the restroom. There were 4 hikers there. I set my bag on the edge of the shelter, in the only place there was room. The girl sitting closest gave me a look. Usually when I’m in a shelter and I’m warm and dry and a wet hiker comes in we all make room and tell them to come in and get warm and dry. The other three just kind of looked at me. I asked all of them where the privy was, I got one answer. I think it’s over there but not sure. They had all obviously stayed there last night and not one of them could spare the time to tell me where the privy was? I bit my tongue on the way out. The walk and rain continued. I told myself I would stop and stay at the 2nd shelter. I was getting more wet and a little cool, not cold. I got to the second shelter and Flying Fish was there taking a break. He said he was going to Glasgow to the hostel. I looked at Guthooks, it was 2 miles, I told him I’d walk with him. The thought of a hostel, and dry bed sounded good. As we left the fog lifted and it seemed to have stopped raining and got a little warmer. When we got to Glasgow I decided to do another two miles to the next shelter. We crossed the longest foot bridge on the AT. I continued on and just before the next shelter I met Onesimus, he travels along the trail and does trail magic. He is retired military, and a former through hiker. Today he was handing out Clif bars. He’s been known to hand out Ice Cream bars. He said there was no one at the next shelter. I got there and hung all of my wet stuff in the shelter. I made myself some hot dinner and got into dry clothes. I was alone for about 1.5 hours then another hiker came in but he was setting up his tent. Today was miserable, I was not miserable but the day was. I keep reminding myself, I like hiking in the rain.  I did do big mileage today. Some recent milestones: I hit 700, should hit 800 tomorrow, and I hit the 1/3 way marker.

I had most of my clothes hung on a clothes line from one side of the shelter to the other. I slept alright. It rained all night and is supposed to rain most of the day, if not all day today.
I am not feeling hungry this morning because I have this problem. I get bored if I get settled in too early, I eat my snacks which I’m supposed to eat over two or three days. I will eat something before heading out because I don’t want to stop in the rain and eat and I need the energy. 
The day started with an hour and twenty minutes climb. I got to the top of Bluff Mtn. at 820. There wasn’t any indication of rain on either weather app, but It was raining and I was in the clouds/fog until 1100. The fog finally broke and the rain stopped but it was still overcast. 
I saw 5-6 fluorescent orange salamanders today. I saw a young buck with fuzzy antlers, he just watched me. The sun almost broke out while on a clearing after Bluff Mtn. 
I talked to an old work colleague for a while. Mudflap caught up and passed me. I made it to the first shelter and had lunch. There was a guy there and talking to him, he’s from Missouri and works on barges that travel the Illinois River near Morris. I filled up with water but it tasted bad. I kept the minimum I’d need. After the first shelter I hit the 800 mile mark! I had another deer scare me, she was about 5 feet off trail and I didn’t see her. She jumped and ran from me. Late in the hiking day I met a guy named Patriot68. He’s 71 years old and is doing a SOBO from Harpers Ferry to Springer Mtn. He has a YouTube channel I’m supposed to check out. 
I got to the shelter at 430. It’s supposed to storm tonight so I set up in the shelter. I cleaned up and had dinner. The shelter is next to a stream. A guy named Labamba was there. A few others arrived: Kentucky, ADD and one other. There was 4 of us in the shelter, one in a hammock.

I didn’t finish the climb until 855 and I had more miles to do.
 I met a hiker named Somewhere, and I saw one of the Ravens. The son passed me then I passed said hi and I never saw the rest of the family. 
While taking a break at the shelter and looked at Guthooks. The road Rick was supposed to pick me up at was listed as a gated road. When I got to the road it was very rough, narrow, and steep. I had to walk a half mile to get to the road closed gate. The road was still pretty treacherous. I was thinking there was no way Rick was finding me up there. And, of course we had no cell service. I walked 2 miles down this road and found a hiker parking lot.
 Rick arrived 10 minutes later. We checked into to Montebello Country Store and Campground. The campground was empty. We cooked dinner and had a fire. I showered and did laundry.

We watched the sun come up over the pond that had a light steam coming off of it. We packed light as we would be camping one night. Rick was going to drop me off; drive ahead; hike in to meet me; and then we would hike back toward the truck and stealth camp.
I drove to the trail head. The road was a fun drive up. Remember yesterday I described it as treacherous. I had the truck in 4WD.  Rick dropped me off and he had to back down the road a quarter mile to get turned around.

 At the top of my first climb was Spy Rock. It was a huge bald rock at the top of a mountain with 360 degree views. I then had to climb The Priest. I stopped at the shelter and I was reading the shelter journal. All entries started with: Forgive me father for I have sinned...Apparently you are supposed to confession your sins to the Priest-shelter book. I thanked god for the wonderful trail. 
Coming down from the priest was a 4 mile decent, it took a long time. I got to a road crossing and saw Skitch. An older couple gave me some grapes. I knew I had a huge climb ahead of me and I knew I had to meet Rick. The climb took 4 hours!!! About 3400 feet in 6.4 miles. It was relentless.

 I/we met Pistol, Sunny Side Up, Dog Treat, & Flash. They had been following my shelter journal entries and were wondering when they would catch me. A very nice group of young kids.  Toward the end of the day we met Gossiper, who says it’s a joke because she keeps to herself. She was feeling very tired, but she continued on. Says she is only eating about 800 calories a day!

It was still rainy/foggy/in the clouds when we woke up. We packed up and it cloudy-rained on us until we go the 4+ miles to the car. I drove down to the Devil’s Backbone Brewery and we had awesome breakfast. We went to their campground and showered and reorganized. Rick dropped me off at the trailhead and then shuttled three hikers down to the brewery.

I started hiking toward the shelter. I was about a mile in and lost in my thoughts. I heard something and looked up. There was a small (100 lbs???) bear 20 ft in front of me. he ran about 50 feet off the trail. I looked around for Mama but didn’t see any other bears. I snapped a couple pictures and clapped some rocks together. He kind of sauntered a little further but wasn’t really interested in me or moving more.

I calmly walked past the area then picked up the pace. I was talking to Seaneen on speaker phone, and I glanced to my left quick because there was a stone wall in the middle of the woods. I tripped and fell hard front/right side first with no bracing and a big Ugggghhh!!! All of this while Seaneen was listening. No scrapes, no injuries.

I then met a trail maintainer who said there was a crew working just ahead but I could get through. I told him about the rock in the middle of the path that just tripped me. He laughed. I thanked all of them for their work! The crew said the wall was from farmers in the 1700s to keep cattle in. It actually has a landmark status and they cannot use/move the rocks.

I was at the top of one of the mountains before my long decent and it started raining. I did not have any rain gear as it wasn’t supposed to rain, and I was only out here one night before we get back to the truck. I use a disposable rain poncho as a bag cover and waited under a tree. Good thing there wasn’t lightning, just a few pieces of hail. The rain brought out the fluorescent orange newts. I saw 8-10 of them. 
I made it to the shelter an hour and five minutes faster than I originally planned. We set up out tents and let them dry out from last night. We made hiker meal dinners, and had no luck starting a fire. We made plans for the next four days as we are going to drop the truck up north and get shuttled south, then walk back to the truck.

It was 1230 and it looked as though someone was shining a light at my tent. I watched as maybe someone was setting up a tent. I finally opened my tent and looked. It was the moon it was so bright and the sky was so clear it was casting shadows. 
We got up and I hiked north to Rockfish Gap. I saw a family cemetery that had flagstones to mark the graves. I later saw an old fireplace/chimney. Rick hiked south to the truck and drove to rockfish.
We went into town and put laundry in. We went across the street and had breakfast while the laundry was going. We also hit the Dollar General, Post Office, Kroger, Liquor store, and Outfitters. I bought new shoes, pair number four. 
We then headed for Swift Run Gap. We arranged to leave the car there and get shuttled back to Rockfish Gap by Stanimal (‘04 through hiker). On the way up we saw a bear standing on the wall/guard rail. We both did a double take. It was surreal. Stanimal picked us up and shuttled us back. I learned alot about running a hostel.
Back on trial we had 7.7 to get to the shelter. I looked at Guthooks and there was no water in that 7.7 miles. We had water but not much. About 4 miles in I made an executive decision, we were stopping at Little Calf Mtn. We needed, and had enough, water for dinner and maybe coffee in the morning. If we needed water for breakfast we’d hike the 1.5 to the shelter and eat breakfast there.  At the first road crossing I Yogi’d some water and we met some Ultra Marathon runners-they had just finished 40 miles!!! We pressed on and arrived at Little Calf Mountain, It’s a Mtn . bald that was recently mowed. Yes!, this was the spot. We set up camp and made dinner.
A deer kept grazing close to camp, then she’d run away and come grazing back. I gathered firewood and hung the bear bags. The sunset was nice and I am looking forward to the sunrise.
Several hikers passed us headed to the shelter. Just as it got dark a guy walked up, named Big Red, He’s tall with red hair. He’s part of the MN Hikings, three guys from MN that are hiking the trail together: Big Red, The Count, & BC. I’ve been seeing their entries in the shelter logs and I’ve finally met them.

At every road crossing and parking lot today there are hikers spread out relaxing, sleeping, or eating. We are in the Shenandoah’s now and similar to the Smokies they force you in and around shelters and discourage stealth camping. 
We stopped at a parking lot for a break and I got anxious. I was pacing the parking lot and Ginger Bread’s friend, Storm, saw me. I chatted with her for a while. Rick Yellow Blazed a few and I kept hiking. I re-met Rick a bit later and we hiked the last .7 in to the shelter. 
About .1 miles in a bear ran from aside the trail, it was probably 5 feet from me. This afternoon was hot and dry. We made it to the shelter and re hydrated. It was early so we chilled out. Rick played Bocci and I just chatted. We had dinner on our own time and gathered firewood. 
The crowd here is nice: Slim, the MN Hikers, and others. I went to bed early in the shelter and was journaling and planning. The fire was going nice and everyone was chatting.

I saw two bunnies that seemed to be guarding the trail, they let me pass. The trail was empty from 745 until 900. At 900 I started running into everyone I know. This went on for about 3.5 hours. In that time I saw a deer. I met two new hikers, one guy named Martha Stewart, and a lady named Moose Liver. Moose Liver had just seen a bear. She is supposed to be Moose Lover but she spelled it wrong and it stuck.I hiked/walked/jogged the 17 miles in 5.5 hours. With four miles to go I was jogging and I tripped. It was full blown Superman fall. I caught myself with my hands and knees, primarily. Luckily I landed in mud and not rocks. I finished the mileage, and Rick picked me up and we drove to town. First stop was lunch. We had barbecue. Second stop was the grocery to buy supplies for trail magic. We are setting up a stand tomorrow on the side of the trail making lunch, providing snacks; and we will have beverages too. When we got back to camp we learned Odie (Hiker Yearbook), and Peaches had bought 2 campsites for hikers and were providing food, showers, and beverages. We opened our campsite to overflow and have additional tents on our site. There are probably 20-30 through hikers in the camp ground. I hung out by Odie and Peaches campsite with many of the hikers for the evening. I enjoyed the fire and some snacks. We played Bocci and a version of beer pong. All was mellow and quiet time at 9 pm.

Rick and I are planning on setting up trail magic at Pinnacles Picnic Area. Trail Magic is basically anything along the trail that is given to you for free. We decided to do beef and chicken fajitas with rice and beans. We also had oranges, sweets, and beverages. 
I made it through my 11+ miles pretty fast. On my  walk I saw a couple deer. I was lost in my thoughts at one point and I looked up. Ten feet to the right of me a bear looked up over the ferns at me. I stopped, backed up slowly maintaining eye contact. I then found two rocks and slapped them together and yelled, Yo Bear! He shuffled along into the woods. 
Later I was walking a narrow path along the side of a mountain and it was steep on both sides. I saw a deer walking up the path toward me. I then saw a hiker behind the deer walking toward me. All three of us stopped, and the other hiker and I looked at each other, we didn’t want to spook the deer. It was a buck and had small fuzzy antlers. It came within 10 feet of me and walked off trail about 5 feet. I got a good video and picture. 
I made it to the trail magic site and Rick had everything set up. We saw a few hikers but the rush didn’t happen until after 1pm. We had about 25 through hikers stop by to include: Bushwacker, Whistle, Mountain Sage, Greenie, Survivor and Gus, Cowboy, Cheese Curd, BC, the Count, Wizard, Sketch, Flying Fish, Mud Flap, Peaches, Pebbles, 50/50, Belle, 1st Gear, and 2 Cindys.


We had a great time giving some love back to the trail and those who hike it. Many different people from different walks of life walking for different reasons. It took us a while to clean up but we made it back to base camp at Big Meadows. 
It was threatening rain so we didn’t know what to do. We built a fire and had dinner. It started raining. We decided to go to the Tap Room at the Lodge. It was not very exciting, so we left. I was exhausted and fell asleep early.

When we woke up we had to break down camp as we were moving north. I made some coffee and we slowly moved through getting packed up. When we were about done I suggested we go to the Lodge for buffet breakfast. While we were eating the tent could dry out. The breakfast was really good. After breakfast we completed packing and headed out. Rick dropped me off at Pinnacles and I hiked north. Rick went and scoped out the next campground and then started hiking south. We met about 4 miles from the campground and hiked there together. The Waysides (3 or 4 of them) in the Shenandoahs have stores and/or restaurants. Each offering something a little different than the other. We were all told there are Blackberry milkshakes at the waysides. Well, the only wayside with Blackberry milkshakes is Elkwallow. We had heard the blackberry ice cream was better than the milkshake, so we both got ice cream. I got two scoops and Rick got one. There were many hikers at the wayside and Rick got to say final goodbyes to some hikers. While we were there it started raining and everyone huddled under a pavilion eating ice cream and munchies. When the rain stopped everyone scattered and we headed to the campground and got set up.

Rick wanted to be on the road by 700. I got up and made coffee and packed. Rick reorganized the truck and I ate some breakfast. We made it to the trailhead and said our goodbyes. I was hiking by 650. It was very windy today and much cooler. When it’s not windy you can hear more in the woods as the leaves aren’t so loud. The leaves were very loud today. Also, the more windy it is the more squeaky the trees are. When a tree falls on another tree and gets stuck every time the trees blow in the wind they squeak. Today the trees were talking and screaming. I was plugging along and I heard a noise to my left. About 20 feet out from me there was a bear sliding down a tree like a fireman down a pole. I made an audible AAAHHH UUUHHHGGG! The bear landed and gave me a look!! I slowly backed away and kept eye contact. I bent down to pick up a couple of rocks to bang together. As I straightened up I yelled, Hay Bear and he started moving away into the woods. Just then about 25 feet away another bear came sliding down a different tree. They both took off into the woods. I thought about getting my phone out but decided not to this time. I’ve seen alot of bears! About an hour later I saw a guy walking toward me. He was tall and skinny with shaggy hair and a shaggy beard. As he got closer I noticed he wasn’t wearing a hat or shirt. You see guys walking without shirts but not often, and it was cool today. When he got close enough I realized it was a hiker I knew. Aside from his pack and hiking shoes & socks he was only wearing a loin cloth in front. I remembered, It’s June 21-National hike naked day. I asked him where he was headed as I know he’s a NOBO hiker like me. He said, Front Royal. I said You might be going the wrong way, or I am. Luckily I was going the right way and he’d only been going the wrong way for .4 miles. He offered to let me walk ahead but I let him as he walks much faster. He hurried away and I got to see his nakedness as he did. I did not see any other naked hikers. I heard everyone in his group was doing it. I continued on and ran into a hiker I haven’t seen since Mother’s Day, John-Ace. He was looking for somewhere to stay. I suggested the Front Royal Terrapin Station Hostel. He ended up hiking on. I got to the hostel and entered through the back gate, as instructed. There was a sign on the door that said come in and make yourself comfortable. I did and grabbed a soda from the fridge and put my pack on a bunk. I was checking out the lay of the land when a door creaked open and it was the owner Mike, a former through hiker. There are many Grateful Dead items in the hostel. I googled Terrapin Station and learned it’s the name of the Dead’s 9th album. I showered, shaved/trimmed the beard, ate frozen pizza, and did laundry. Mike took me into town to get cash and offered to take me for fast food. I declined but later decided on KFC. I had the hostel to myself. I got caught up on my journal, talked to my mom, and reactivated my FB account. I also wrote some post cards. Wildlife update: Bears-two of them!","Elkwallow Gap Wayside

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617077,"I was the only one in the hostel last night. I thought of sleeping in the recliner in front of the television but decided to try the futon. It was too short and uncomfortable. I moved to the bunk in the bunk room and slept great. I got up, moving, and on trail by 715am. 
The hike started with a .6 mile uphill to the trail. The trail was quiet because we are exiting the Shenandoahs. Hikers are no longer required to stay in shelters and I started between shelters. I was walking along and came across a hiker getting water, it was Longfeather. I chatted with him and moved on. He is doing well except he’s got shin splints from trying to keep up with a faster hiker. 
I found a few blackberries and mulberries along the trail. There was also two coolers along the trail. One had sodas, and one had waters. I picked up a package at Mountain Cabin Inn, very cute place. 
In and around Front Royal it was loud: dogs, trucks, and lawnmowers. I made it to the first shelter. It was beautiful: front porch, covered pavilion area, privy, shower, and horseshoe pits. I caught up to the MN Hikings. Memorial and Gingerbread are at least 1.5-2 days ahead. 
It got warm in the afternoon and I stopped at the second shelter. There was a guy dressed in a tyvek suit, helmet, face guard, gloves, ear protection, and boots. He was running a string trimmer and was trimming along the trail-Thanks. 
I decided to push on to the third shelter-Whiskey Hollow Shelter. I made it there by 430. I decided it was a sleep in the shelter night. There are 6 women section hikers here. 4 tenting and 2 in the shelter.  They are all on the shelter deck preparing and eating. They are talking alot! One more than the other. Maybe I should have tented. 
All of the MN Hikings showed up at the shelter, they are tenting. I met two guys on trail today, Troubadour and Freebird. 
After dinner the ladies started a fire. Wizard and Troubadour entertained us with guitar and singing.

The ladies joined in , and a campfire was made. I went to bed early as I was exhausted. I woke up and the two ladies in the shelter were moving also so I didn’t have to worry about waking them.  I forgot to mention yesterday. I was standing in the shelter talking to the two ladies and I saw a massive spider moving toward one of them. I tried to get her to move but I could not talk. I reached to move her and she didn’t know what I was doing. By the time I was able to do anything the spider had jumped from the bench, crawled up her back and it was on her shoulder. This spider was massive, not a tarantula, but big like that. I swatted it off and it landed midway down her back. I swatted it again and it fell to the floor. The other lady ran over and stepped on it. There was a noticeable crunch ?. I got onto the trail before 7. I knew I had a long day, and it was going to be hot. The trail started out nice then got overgrown. I was first out so I was cleaning spider webs. There were some open areas today which is nice because you walk in the woods for so long it’s nice to see some openness. I saw my first other hikers at 8. but they were far away and on another trail. I didn’t see too many through hikers today. I stopped at 1100 and took a break. I ate a hiker dinner because I’m out of my normal lunch stuff until tomorrow. While eating I had a butterfly land on me. I knew in a half mile I was going to get to the roller coaster. The roller coaster is a fourteen mile stretch of short (300-500) foot inclines and declines. It was not fun! Especially because I had already walked! almost 9 miles and it was 1200, and getting hot.  Every climb and decent is different longer/shorter more/less incline or decline. I made it through 8 of the 11 inclines and stopped at Bears Den Hostel. Bears Den is owned and operated by the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. They have a special where you get a bunk, laundry, shower, pizza, ice cream, and soda for $30. I only needed tent space and shower, $12. I did end up buying a pizza and ice cream for $11. I chilled in the common area and watched part of Blazing Saddles and part of Shaun of the Dead. The place is made of stone and looks like a castle. It is very clean and the hot shower was nice. Oh, they have make your own pancakes in the morning. They supply everything you just have to make them. My alarm is set for 530. I want to get on trail early and finish the roller coaster. I also want to make it to Harper’s Ferry. Update: I made it to the 1000 mile marker today. Wildlife update: Big bunny, and baby bunny.","Whiskey Hallow Shelter

I slept in my tent but got all the advantages of the hostel: Shower, television common area, wifi, and pancake breakfast with fresh mulberries. I was on trail by 707, there was a deer in the driveway. The trail was very quiet today, it’s a week day and again no rules so the hikers are spread out. After finishing the last 3 or 4 inclines of the roller coaster the walk turned pleasant. The trail leveled out as best it can. The woods were also more open today in that there were many trees with full canopy and ground cover but not much mid level green to block views. I met a hiker named 70 who’s trying to complete the trail in 70 days. He has to average 31.31 a day. I also saw a 70 year old hiker I met last night named Fox. He flew past me twice today. I saw a dead deer in the middle of the woods, it was kind of weird. Like, how did it die? I also saw two more live deer. Today was hot and sticky. I got tired and worn out mid afternoon. I crossed a road and there was a sign for trail magic. It was a case of 6oz bottled waters. I had two and thanked the guy. While chatting with him it started raining and rained for about an hour but only hard for about 5 mins. I covered my bag but no rain jacket. There was a hiker ahead of me, just out of site and I heard him groan/kind of scream. I got close enough and he was moving but then stopped. I yelled ahead to see if he was ok, he didn’t answer, I yelled again and he answered. He had slipped and fallen in some jagged rocks. He was on his back wedged between rocks. he couldn’t get his pack off and couldn’t roll over. I helped him get up and then clean up and bandage the wounds. We still had 2.5 to town, scary. We continued walking and got to the Shenandoah River. We crossed the river and then continued on trail to town. I was looking to stay at a hostel and it was booked. I called the other hostel, booked. I then called the Quality Inn and got a room, expensive room. First thing I did was shower. Then off to find a beer. The desk clerk told me where the liquor store was. Of course it’s 5 blocks up hill.I couldn’t find it. Another hiker helped me. The store is a tiny store on the corner with one door and a hand painted sign, and by the way it’s in the same building as the town hall and police deparrment. How did I miss that?!? Back at the room I ordered a calzone and a salad. I planned out the next 5 days and caught up on some texting. Harper’s Ferry is the unofficial half way point, and home of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy(ATC). I will get my picture taken there tomorrow for the classes of 2019 photo album. I am ahead of schedule and am going to crank out some miles before I go off trail in July for the family vacation, SNIDERFEST2019. I decided I was going to pick up garbage along the trail today. I usually do this but not whole heartedly. Today I picked up alot. I also learned that if you tear the corner off of something it’s not technically garbage and you can throw it on the ground. I must have picked up 20 corners. Things I will not pick up: cigarette butts, Kleenex, or toilet paper. I have hiked out broken glass, sandals, sunglasses, cans, and clothes. Wildlife update: squirrels, deer-3 alive 1 dead, turkey vultures.","Bears Den Hostel

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617324,"I stayed in Harper’s Ferry last night at the Quality Inn. It was nice and I woke up early and forced myself back to sleep. Usually I’m up at 530 and on trail around 700. The ATC didn’t open until 900, and it was a 10 minute walk so I had time to waste. I went down stairs and had breakfast: coffee, waffle, 4 bowls of Froot Loops, a small muffin, and a small yogurt. I watched the news, which I really don’t miss. I went back to the room and took my time packing. I walked to the post office and mailed some postcards. Next stop was the ATC Headquarters. I walked up and there was already 12 hikers waiting for them to open, alot of familiar faces. They opened and took everyone’s individual photos in front of the building. Once you have your photo taken you write your information on it and it goes into the class of 2019 book. At the beginning, Springer Mtn. I got a tag I zip tied to my pack with the number 2208 on it. At the ATC today they put a number on your photo marking how many through hikers have made it to Harper’s and are continuing to Maine. I got number 1104. I then went back to the trail where I had left it yesterday and looked for the outfitters as I needed food for four days. Once that was done I crossed the Potomac and started walking on the C&O Canal Towpath at 1030am. It was nice because it was cinder pathway and it was level. But it was only partly shaded. This went on for almost 4 miles, it got old. I like walking on trail as I’ve previously stated, I don’t much care for level surfaces. I was tired today in spite of having slept in a hotel. I got to the first shelter and I took a nap. I set an alarm for 30 minutes. I am pretty sure I was OUT!  I had planned on staying at the third shelter but I found just past that there is a campsite with showers, free. So I was headed there. Water seems to be far off the trail in this area but, there was a park, Gath’s Empty Tomb, which had water and water bathrooms. I got water there and continued. I don’t know how to describe it but the trail since the Shenandoahs seems less “traily”, you can hear town noises and it just doesn’t seem as pretty. It is pretty in places but sometimes it’s like walking on the Prairie Path behind the old Dominicks in West Chicago, Illinois. Like it’s nice to be out in the nature but you know town is right there. I have not really felt that until now. I made it to the campground, which is designed for hikers only. There are about 8 tent pads with fire ring and picnic table. There is also a bath house with hot showers and clean water. I set up camp, ate dinner, showered and just chilled out. The other two things that are making it feel less “traily” is I have not seen much wildlife and I have not seen many through hikers. Hikers seem to be more spread out, and a big group went into DC. I also did not notice any stealth camping spots. Wildlife update: Tiny toads.","Harper’s Ferry

There was a road crossing a quarter mile out of camp. There were three coolers there, Trail Magic! I got an icy Coke. I normally don’t drink much soda but man an icy Coke taste so good.
I got to Washington Monument State Park and got to climb to the top of the monument. The monument was closed for renovations but the workers let us in.

 I stopped at the first shelter to take a quick nap. After yesterday’s nap I decided I really like naps. Early in the trip I took many more breaks. The naps have been great breaks and it’s only 30 minutes. I feel so much better. While napping a trail runner and a trail maintainer both stopped by to check on the shelter and to clean up garbage.

I got back on trial and I saw two different people running the trail. One of them flew past me on an uphill. He was just bouncing and skipping right up the hill, no problem. He also looked like a Kenyan, and maybe weighed 135 lbs. 
It was hot today and I was getting tired at about 330. I was contemplating hitching into town and getting something cold to drink. At the road crossing I saw a sign for trail magic. A friend of a few of the people I’ve been hiking around brought magic. I had a coke, piece of chicken, beer, fruit, Oreo double stuff, chips ahoy, and a Powerade. It hit the spot and kept me going.

I had 5 more miles and I knew the last mile was steep and I’d have to carry up 2 liters of water. I came across a SOBO hiker who had really long hair and beard, like a wizard from the hobbit. He was wearing long pants and a long sleeve sweater shirt. It looked like wool. He started talking to about places to see and stay south of me, at that point I was like, I have to get moving, and he just kept talking. After 20 minutes I finally got away. 
I made it to the shelter and I heard kids yelling. There is a group of six kids, 4 girls and 2 boys doing a school camping trip with two supervisors. They were not that loud, and I chatted with the supervisors while enjoying my dinner.

I slept with my rain fly half off of the tent to try and get some air circulation. It helped some and I slept good. I heard someone up and packing before sun up but I fell back to sleep.
I got out of camp on time today, 706. Today started out very humid and sticky. Normally I only drip sweat when climbing but, I was dripping just moving. 
At about mile 5 there was a municipal park. It was a very nice park with clean water and clean restrooms. I also found some phone power. The park had what seemed to be an excessive amount of garbage cans, so I got rid of all of my garbage.  
In the next mile I found many blackberry bushes and ate many blackberries. I stopped at the 1st shelter, NAP time?. I believe I was asleep for about 1/2 hour. Some other hikers came in to the shelter and I chatted with them for a while.

I continued on and it was getting hotter and more humid, my shins were dripping sweat. There was a bigger climb mid afternoon and I needed some water. I crossed a creek and splashed my face, hair, and neck. I thought about getting in but the park was close and I figured I could run my head under the spigot. 
I crossed the next foot bridge and saw a sign for trail magic. I practically ran to the park, I was so overheated and tired. A gentleman who did 1000 miles last year and had to quit because of shin splints was doing magic.  I had: Three hotdogs, one bag of chips, two hostess snack cakes, Coke, Mtn Dew & two Gatorade’s. He also made me take an additional snack cake to go. People along the trail are so nice, and he wanted me/us to take more! 
While sitting at the picnic tables with about six other hikers the gnats were bad. Two younger girls maybe late teens came and sat down at the picnic table next to us because there was a group outing going on at the park too.   One girl said, what’s with all the gnats? I jokingly/truthfully said it’s probably because of us, we stink. One girl kind of laughed and said it could be her. The other started to get a look on her face. I said seriously, it’s probably us, most of us have not showered in 2-3 days. The second girl made the most disgusted face. They got up and moved as the 1st girl said, at least you guys are doing something really cool. 
I was fueled with calories and Gatorade for the afternoon climb. I made it up the climb and was going to hitchhike into a small town for a beer and dinner. They also let you camp on the property and have an outdoor shower. I saw 2 cars in 10 minutes, and they didn’t stop. I knew there was a shelter not far. I got to the sign for the shelter and it said the shelter was .3 off trail. Guthooks doesn’t say anything about a .3, and AWOL says .2, Guthooks says the shelter water is an additional.2 past the shelter and AWOL says .5.  My point is accurate information would be helpful. I peruse AWOL for and overall of the day and rely on Guthooks throughout the day as it’s on my phone. 
The shelter was every bit of .3 steep downhill and the water was close to .5! I could have walked 1/2 way to the state park further up the trail. Additionally, there were terrible tent sites there. I ended up packing out 3 liters of water back up the .3 to the trail and I went north .3 until I found a nice stealth spot.

It also helped that I was exhausted from all of the heat and humidity. I saw one hiker pass going northbound as I was packing.
There was a city park about 5 miles in. Just before the park someone had left two bananas on the foot bridge, I had one. I stopped at the park and bought a Pepsi from the vending machine. I used the clean, indoor plumbing, washrooms and loaded water at the drinking fountain. I was going to buy a Powerade but I only had 5s and 20s and 1.25 in quarters. Powerade was 1.50. 
There is a nice pool at the park and they offer a shower and pool use for $6 but, they open at 1100 and it was 900. I continued. I got to the first shelter and it was beautiful. There were flowers and hanging baskets. There was a glider I sat in and could have taken a nap in but, no nap today. I was in a “funk” the last two days and I am now out of it. Today was supposed to be hotter than yesterday. I didn’t feel it, maybe it’s because there was a breeze. It was still hot and I was still dripping sweat. Someone had been writing messages on the trail in the dirt, made out of rocks, and made out of pinecones.

I went through an area that had been forested. Wow, they just come through and clear what they want and tear up the land and the remaining trees are all beat up. The only positive I saw was two deer in the area. I was trying to do 22+/- miles and it was getting hot and I was getting a little tired. 
I hit a Trail Magic just as the guy was setting up. I had a Coke, watermelon, Fritos, Gatorade, Little Debbie oatmeal cream pie, and a York peppermint patty. It hit the spot and It carried me through to Ironmasters Mansion Hostel. For $35 you get a bunk, shower, laundry, dinner, breakfast, and linens.

I headed for the general store and the 1/2 gallon ice cream challenge. You have to complete a quart and a pint of ice cream in one sitting. I talked to a few other hikers who attempted and failed. I am an ice cream junkie! I chose Butter Pecan for my quart. About 1/2 way through I wasn’t sure but got a second wind. I finished the quart and got Cherry Delight for my pint. I killed that in no time. My reward-I got a tiny wooden spoon that is stamped with “Member of Half Gal Club”. I also got to write my name in a book. About 1-1/2 hours later I ate a whole Tombstone pizza. I showered and got my laundry in line. The hostel is nice and the crowd is nice too.

 Accomplishments today:
-Mathematical 1/2 way point mile 1096

-1100 mile mark, another 100 done.

-1/2 gallon of ice cream killed.

 So I was walking along looking for the 1/2 way mark. Every 100 miles has been marked, and most of those multiple times. I passed 1096 and there was nothing! I continued and finally found a sign, it said “official 2018 half way point” There was also a 1/2 made of stone. Ok? Where is the 2019? I then found a more formal 1/2 way marker and a sign in book. The sign said 1090.5 to Springer or Katadhin. The half way is 1096 this year. The trail total mileage changes every year so the midpoint changes every year. I took a picture and signed the book.

Of the hikers left I got out of there first at 740.The first mile was flat and then there was a 3 mile slight uphill. I was walking really fast. I told myself to slow down but I kept going. It was warm but not hot. At about 7 miles I came to a stream and it was about 2.5 feet deep in a spot. I thought about taking a dip but I dipped my head in instead because I was stopping at a convenient store in about a mile and a half. I had planned to stop there for lunch and a small resupply. 
The store was very nice, I had a country sub and a large Gatorade. I then bought my resupply and an ice cream. Back to the trail. I slowed down some because it was as though someone flipped a switch. It got really hot, still, and humid. 
I saw a dad and daughter I’d been leapfrogging all day and they told me of a nice place to take a break further up the trail. They had stopped for a quick snack. I made it to the footbridge and took off my pack and shirt. I was splashing myself in the creek. I heard an alert on my phone. There was a severe thunderstorm watch for the area. I confirmed the counties with the dad as he and his daughter had caught up, and they live in the area. We both looked at the radar. It was four miles to the next shelter. We probably wouldn’t make it but we were going to try. I took off fast and there was a good uphill. I burned myself out on the uphill. I had accepted I was going to get caught in the storm, as it had turned from a watch to a warning.

I came across a lady walking the other direction and I warned her of the oncoming storm. She said it’s not going to rain and inferred she is connected to god or a higher power and she knew. I have mental illness in my family and there are varying degrees so i’m going to go on a side bar. I will talk to mentally ill people to a point. This woman said it’s not going to rain. Yet, she’s carrying an umbrella and has a raincoat with her. I showed her the radar and her story changed. Now she’s not worried about rain. I said neither am I it’s the wind and lightning I’m worried about. She said, who said anything about lightning? I said, do you hear that thunder? That means there is lightning. She started arguing with me saying you can have thunder without lightning. I was like, time to go, see ya, and be safe! 
I was on a non-exposed ridge line and I wanted to get to a lower elevation. I did as the front arrived. I was stuck in the middle of the woods and the trees were dancing back and forth and small branches were falling all around me. I found a nice sturdy tree to stand up wind from, hoping it’d protect me. I put my bag cover on and after the initial winds went by and I continued. Then the rain started. I found a large rock formation/overhang and I hid under there until the bulk of the rain and lightning passed. 
I made it to the shelter and the dad and daughter were there. They decided to stay there for the night. I filled up with water and continued another mile. I found a nice stealth spot. I hung a clothes line and dried my wet things a little. I ate and am planning on being to sleep early.

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617941,"Sooooo, I have decided to try and make it Duncannon today. It’s going to be hot but not as hot as the past two days. The terrain is relatively flat and there is supposed to be some open area walking. Oh, Duncannon is 28+ miles away.
I woke up at normal time and started packing. One of the other hikers offered me a ziplock full of Nestcafe coffees. I thanked her profusely. I have only been able to find Tasters Choice lately and I need a change. 
I headed out and the trail opened up into some farm fields. I saw a blue bird and a doe with two fawn. I met a lady out running and she suggested I go to the diner in Boiling Springs. I went to the diner and it was good. It cut into my hiking time. 
I move along pretty good but with incline, breaks, terrain, and heat I always figure my pace at 2 mph. If I get there sooner its a bonus. If I get there later oh well, I’m retired. That being said, to walk 28 miles would take me 14 hours. Leaving camp at 700 means I stop walking at 9 pm.  The sun sets at 840ish. 
After Boiling Springs the trail went through farm fields, meadows, and through the woods. It was a very pleasant day. I saw another fawn, several more deer, ducks, toads, cows, many bunnies, and a snake.

As I was approaching a shelter at mile 17 of my journey, I saw medical tape wrapped around a tree and thought it was odd. The tape was holding a sign that said: Trail Magic 2.5 miles ahead: Beer and burgers-breakfast the 29th & 30th. I now continued with a purpose. I was beginning to wonder about the possibility of trail magic today. It was hot and sunny and there were many road crossings. I was beginning to think my trail magic(TM)streak was over.

I got to the road where the TM was happening and there were two men in their 20s doing TM. One had through hiked in ‘16 & one in ‘17. They were just giving back. I tried explaining this to a day hiker earlier and she didn’t understand. Anyway, I had a Coke, two cheese burgers, potato chips, 4 Oreo double stuff, 2 Mooseheads, and a Coronita. I thanked them very much and they invited me to stay and eat and drink more, but I had more miles to do. 
I got to just outside of Duncannon and found a beautiful overlook of the valley and a nice stealth camping spot. It was about 815 and the sun was setting in my full view. I decided to watch the sunset from here, set up camp at the stealth spot and hike into Duncannon in the morning. The sunset was amazing and got better for the 45 minutes after setting. I did not watch that long but I could see the orange sky as I was setting up my tent. 
I started to get bitten by mosquitoes. I have seen mosquitoes but they have not been aggressive. They became aggressive and I got into my tent. I have not used bug spray yet, June 30th! I did not make it to Duncannon but I did hike 26.5 miles today. Only one blister, a good one, but only one.

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617942,"There should be rules for mosquitoes. Like:
-you can only be active between certain hours.

-no biting while someone is trying to do something like set up or take down a tent

I could go on…It’s July 1 and I have not used bug spray yet. I ate normal camp breakfast of two oatmeals and coffee. I am out of Carnation Instant Breakfast. I was not sure if Duncannon was going to have an open breakfast place. Duncannon looked cute from the overlook but not so cute up close. There were many vacant and rundown buildings on the main street.

I found an open cafe and there was one other person in there just finishing paying their bill, Mountain Sage. It was good to see him again and he said he saw Gingerbread yesterday. I had a good breakfast and charged my electronics. I even bought some canister fuel and drink mix there. 
The walk through Duncannon was long and I decided to go to the Pilot .2 off trail as I needed a few resupply items. I had to cross a four lane highway with a center turn lane. Oh my, I felt like frogger. After Pilot I had a long walk along the same highway back to the trail.

It was good to be back in the woods. I made it to the turn off for the first shelter and I sat on a log. I was tired. 26 miles yesterday had me worn down. A section hiker came along and she offered me a sandwich as she was getting off trail and had extras. I normally do not decline food but I was tired and still not hungry from breakfast. I continued on and decided I’d take a nap at the next shelter. 
On the way I saw an overlook so I went off trail to check it out. There was a hiker there with a dog. We didn’t say much. I was looking like I was ready to fall asleep and his dog was laying on her side, passed out. I finally said, I feel like your dog looks. He started chatting with me, asked me what was wrong, offered me some pot. I declined the pot, and said I had walked too many miles yesterday and was paying the price today. We walked on to the next shelter and I learned his name was Slim and the dog, Ellen. 
At the next shelter I tried to nap but the bugs were bad. The sign for the spring said 300 steps. Everyone warned of the awful trip to get water at this shelter. It was 300 stair-steps down. Stone stairs of varying heights, widths, and distances apart. I broke a sweat walking down. It’s one of those where you start and you say, I really don’t need water that bad but you are too invested to turn around and it just keeps going further and further down. You know you have to walk back up and carry the water. At least the spring was flowing and was ice cold. 
When I returned there was another hiker there named Buster. I continued on as I still had 5 miles to do. I was walking along and decided if I could find a good stealth spot before the spot I wanted to get to, I’d stop. I found one 1.3 miles shy of my intended destination. I was done because I was tired and it was hot. There had also been a horse fly or flies buzzing my head for 20 minutes and I was getting frustrated. 
So June 30/July 1 ends the non aggressiveness of the bugs. As I was setting up I sprayed my head with bug spray and put it on. I then sprayed my camp shirt and put it on. I cooked my dinner without being bothered too much. I hung my food bag, and retreated to my tent where I ate my dinner and plan on staying the rest of the night. I have a partially obstructed view of the sunset, and it looks beautiful and orange again.

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617943,"I woke up in my stealth spot alone as the hikers I met yesterday hiked further. I retrieved my bear bag and made coffee. I decided I needed more calories so I ate 3 oatmeals today. After that I made another coffee and I think I fell back to sleep for a few minutes.
I started hiking and found Slim, Buster and another guy as they were packing. I continued and the day was uneventful. It was hot again and humid so I was moving slow. I was wondering what I might write for today, I then stepped over a log and saw a coiled rattle snake sunning itself on the trail against a stone. I made a wide berth around it. I then went back and passed it again so I could leave a note for Slim and his dog. I then walked around it a 3rd time to get headed back north. I left a note on that side too. 
A few miles later I saw a sign for “alternate dry route” and “wet route, beaver dam.” I chose the beaver dam. The beaver dam was incredible. I had to have been at least 300 yards long. There were some stones and logs along the way but no matter what you did your feet were going to get wet. 
I grabbed a walking stick to steady myself. At one point I was walking on top of the dam. It was an amazing engineering feat. I was about 2.5 miles from my intended stopping point and I got a weather alert and started hearing thunder. I was able to make it to camp, get set up, and finish cooking dinner before the rain started.

I went to sleep with my shoes wet from the beaver pond. I have a dry pair of socks. I grabbed my shoes and one of them, the right one had a puddle in it. Not good because I’m nursing a blister on that heel.

The hostel offers laundry, linens, shower, ride to town, gourmet breakfast, and pick up and drop off at the trail. I was moving along a little slower because of the blister, and the PA rocks,  but was still making about 2 miles per hour. I stopped at shelter 501. Its a nice shelter with a solar shower and you can have pizza delivered. I made myself a hiker meal and relaxed a little. I looked at the time and it was 230, I still had 9 miles to hike or 4 more hours. The hike was rather uneventful today with a few partial views.  I caught up to one of the hikers I had met at 501.

I packed and breakfast was brought in. Sausage links, 2 waffles, fresh fruit, orange juice, lemonade, and coffee. My shoes got mostly dry and my socks were clean and dry. We were dropped off at the trail head. The morning was beautiful. The sky was clear. Everything was clean from the rain. The forest was radiant green and sparkling from the rain drops. I saw several deer today. One doe had 2 fawn with her. I saw Cindy and Cowboy, they were hiking with Happy Feet and Coffee Bean. I had not met them yet. I was really trying to protect my feet today. I am on the verge of more blisters. The trail was muddy and my feet did get wet today. The last mile into town was extremely steep downhill. I made it to the post office where you call for rides from.

The blister on the back of my right foot was hurting and my right toe was throbbing. There is something going on with the big toe, toe nail.  I am thinking a little irritation and not infection but, my mind was thinking the worst as I was trying to sleep. I’m picturing it being stabbed with a needle or having to have my toe lanced. 
I slept until 700 which is usually when I hit the trail. I went downstairs for breakfast and saw several hiker friends. At this point I was thinking of taking a zero day and trying to find a way home. Just for a planned vacation, not for good. Talking to Cowboy and Cindy (Braveheart) cheered me up. We decided to get a ride to Walmart for a few things and then get dropped off at the trailhead. I had a half hour to pack and doctor my feet.  
I was on trail just after 900. My feet were feeling alright and I saw a deer early into the trip. The first two miles of the trip was an 1100 foot climb. It then pretty much leveled off. There was a great view called the Pinnacle.  I took a good break there. There is also an amateur astrological site up there with three observatories. 
Parts of the trail were very rocky today but I really don’t mind the rocks. At one point we were walking on a dirt/gravel road for several miles. I saw a rattlesnake stretched out across the trail. I got a big stick then threw small rocks near it until it moved. It rattled its tail as it slithered away.  
I made the 14+ miles to the shelter which is on the same grounds as a caretaker and his house. I got the last bunk. It’s supposed to rain tonight. The shelter has a flush toilet and solar shower.  I ate dinner first then took a shower. The caretaker had sodas for us and later brought out a watermelon. There was an older couple that lives in the area that stopped by and dropped of a box of Honey Stinger products .

I will return to the trail on July 22.  This is a planned vacation from the trail so I can go home and go on family vacation, SNIDERFEST 2019! I had originally planned on getting off trail on Monday or Tuesday and only being off the trail for 10 days.  I am many miles ahead of where I thought I’d be at this time and a few extra days of rest will help. My heel blister is not doing well and this will give it some extra time to heel. I have not had a Nero or Zero since Damascus, May 18.
I did not sleep well in the shelter as it was hot and still.  There were also a few bugs, like gnats bothering me. That is why I really like my tent. I was up early as the sunlight comes in the shelter and the birds start singing at 515. I wished Cowboy and Braveheart goodbye and safe trails.
It was too early to start calling shuttle drivers so I had coffee and oatmeal as the other hikers woke, packed, and got on their way. I had found a Enterprise rent a car at Lehigh Airport (40 miles away). I could rent one way from there and return it to O'Hare without the additional one way fee. At 800 I started calling shuttle drivers, and the second one I called said she would take me to the airport where I could rent a car. She would be there in an hour.
At exactly 900 the shuttle driver arrived and we were off to the airport.  I got to the rental agent counter and told the gentleman I would like a car one way to Chicago O'Hare. He said that it would be $450.00.  I said I can book through Enterprise online and it’s $99.00.  He said if I could do that do it, then give him the confirmation number and I’ll get the car for $99.00.  So I stood there in front of him on their website and booked the car for $99.00!!!! I just don’t understand.
I drove for 12 hours straight, and made it home to Seaneen and Luci at 9 pm.  I was exhausted.  I showered and went to bed.

The shuttle driver told me to make sure I could get the vehicle one way to the particular airport she was picking me up from, (Reading regional.) She had suggested a different airport from the one she had picked me up from (Lehigh), because it was closer and would cost me less.I had looked at one way rentals from O’Hare airport to Reading Regional airport earlier in the week and there was a small pickup available for $115. I did not book it as I wanted to confirm with the shuttle driver she could pick me up.  I went onto the Enterprise website today.  I could not find a one way from O’hare to Reading or Lehigh.  I tried from Midway and I couldn’t find anything.  I checked Amtrack, and I could get a train to Allentown from Chicago for $184. The train left Sunday evening and didn’t get to Allentown for almost 24 hours!  I tried some of the Tavel websites and they all said there was a high demand for vehicles in Chicago and the price was over $500.

The shuttle ride back to the Eckville Shelter took about an hour. I was dropped off at the shelter and I walked up the walk to the shelter. The caretaker came out of his house and grumpily asked if he could help me with something? I was carrying a backpack and I was dressed like a hiker. I politely told him I was through hiking and I just got dropped off by a shuttle driver.  
I checked the shelter log book to see who had been there and I saw some familiar names. I was happy because I may be catching some hikers I have not seen in a while.

I got back on the trail and I felt pretty good at first. I knew my day was going to be short because I started at 1100, it was my 1st day back, and the first shelter was 7.4 miles. The second shelter is another 10, and I was not doing 17 the first day back. Also there is a thunderstorm watch in effect until 10 pm. 
After a few miles my legs felt like rubber and powerless. I hope it’s only a few days to get my hiking legs back. The Pennsylvania rocks didn’t help much.

At the 1st shelter I took my shoes and socks off and took the liners out of my shoes. I was able to ring water out of my socks.  I was hoping today was going to be a little less Pennsylvania Rocky, and it was at times. The rocky parts made up for the areas of non rockiness.

He offered to give me a ride to the store and offered me water. He said he wants to walk the trail some day, he’s 63. Back on trail I met and older guy 72 walking with his grandson from OK. The grandson said he thought I was about 39 when I mentioned I was 50 in conversation ?. The guy said he wants to walk the southern half of the trail someday. More on that later. The trail has been pretty lately, more “woodsy”, it’s nice. There have been alot of town noises like cars, trucks, & planes but the woods seem pretty again. Just after having that thought I saw two deer, a doe and a buck. A half mile later I saw a fawn. A mile later I saw a rather large bear. I was getting really tired and my feet were starting to hurt. My goal was 19 for the day but I had a contingency of 17 and a water source. I made it to the 17 and called it a day. Back to the “someday” comments. I hear many people along the trail say that “someday” I want to walk the trail. I am very fortunate that my “someday” is now. It wasn’t easy getting here but I’ve semi been planning this for 10 years and seriously planning it the last three. Again I am fortunate that my circumstances allow me this wonderful opportunity but I want to say,  just do it! or get the ball moving in that direction! Take steps toward that goal, whatever it is. Life is short. I tell my wife all of the time; Not one person has ever said on their death bed, “I wish I would have spent more time cleaning house.” Wildlife update: Buck, Doe, Fawn, Big BEAR.","Stealth Camping at 1269.3 Delps Tr.

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619770,"I don’t know why but last night felt like it was the most remote I have camped so far this trip. I did not see another hiker for the last two hours of hiking. There were 2 hikers that walked by as I was setting up camp. Other than that I have not seen anyone. The next shelter is 3 miles away. I guess what added to the creepiness of the site was an abandoned tent and some belongings rolled up hidden behind a log. I’ve seen abandoned equipment before. It always makes me wonder about the circumstances leading to the abandonment. I made it through the night with no Boogie Man or Bears. I got on trail and headed for the first shelter. I took a short break there and ran into Cricket. I had a few more miles to town. I met many friendly day hikers. As I was getting close to town I chatted with a young man for about 20 minutes. He has traveled the states motocross racing. We walked into town together. I found the church hostel and many hikers were there including Mama Bird, Squeeks, Salad, Cricket, Ira, Rafakki,and others. The church has a bunk house and sitting area. I took a quick shower and washed some dirty clothes in the sink. I left my pack and headed further into town for some food and resupply. I found a pizza place with beer. I had some slices and beers while chatting with other hikers. I then went to the outfitters and got a few things to include an inflatable pillow. The stuff sack with clothes just isn’t cutting it. Especially because I am down to summer clothes which isn’t much. Back on trail you cross the Delaware river and into New Jersey. Yeah out of PA and the rock....or so I thought. I met a couple from Costa Rica hiking and I walked and talked to them for about 2 miles. I then met a lady and her son out day hiking. She started asking me all about through hiking, and was amazed. Come to find out she’s training for a 100 mile Ultra!!! I was totally amazed someone can run for 100 miles! I continued on and there was a beautiful pond, more like a lake. You have to walk around the shore. I saw a beaver swimming in the pond close to the shore so I started taking pictures of it. I heard some rustling behind me. I glanced, there was a small trail coming down from a  hill. I went back to taking pictures and the rustling got louder. I looked back and there was a huge beaver with 3 foot long sticks in it’s mouth running right at me. Scared the crap out of me!!! I found an awesome stealth spot right on the pond with grass, ahhh yea, No Camping ?. So I’ve told many of stories about how nice people are along the trail and how they help you. I helped two people today. Early this morning a lady was out hiking wearing a sports bra and shorts. She said she forgot her bug spray, so I let her use mine. I’ve only used it once. This afternoon a section hiker was having a splitting headache and need Advil, so I gave him some of what I had. Before I left the trail I was doing 20 mile days pretty regularly, and not taking much time off. The last two days I have enjoyed lunch in town, and have still hiked over 16 miles without pushing it. I am going to take it easier this second half. If I average 18 miles a day I will finish September 14. If I average 15 miles a day I will finish September 24. So, I am going to cut back on miles most days and enjoy the towns when they come along. Wildlife update: 2 Big Beavers!","Stealth Camping Site 1286.2

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619850,"So today has to rank as one of the top 5 days on the trail. I got up early after sleeping through the night. I had coffee, ate, and was on trail by 738. I walked about a mile to the open ridge line and the view went on forever in both directions. On the west side there was total cloud cover in the valley below us and on the east side it was clear and you could see the whole valley. There were several through hikers up there that had camped last night. Wow what a view. 
I spent most of the day walking with a view to the east. It kept changing but it kept getting more rural and more beautiful. I met several hikers today and everyone is so nice. Next I went by a bog that was created by a beaver dam. The bog was covered with lily pads and flowers. The next bog was partially drained and not so pretty. 
I took several breaks, and climbed a fire tower. I no longer shake or get that feeling in my stomach. I was thinking the day was going to be a bust for wildlife as it after 200 and I hadn’t seen anything. I then noticed something on the trail ahead. I was a huge Tom turkey and a hen with several young turkeys. About a half mile later I heard a noise to my right and I saw a baby bear climbing a tree. I froze and listened and looked for Mama. While listening and looking I took a quick video and stills. I then moved on before Mama found me.
I soon ran into Cricket and Salad they are headed to the next town so they can go to NY City tomorrow and visit museums. Nice kids! I had decided I wasn’t going to make it to town so I pick a goal of Blue Mtn. stealth site. When I arrived on Blue Mtn. I was blown away. I have an unobstructed 180 view to the west. Ahhhhh sunset?. I am also looking forward to seeing the stars tonight as it is clear.
I am still maxing my days out in the 17 mile range. I know longer days will come. I am listening to my body. I will hopefully catch Camelback Santa in a few days.I talked to him this morning, it will be nice to see him.

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620002,"Last night I did not fall asleep quickly. I think it was the wind rustling my rain fly as I had it half open. Also, I’m having aches like I had back in the beginning of the hike. I brought a golf ball to work out my muscles. Hopefully this gradually goes away. In the middle of the night I could see the stars through my screening. I unzipped and looked out. The stars were amazing and you could faintly see the Milky Way. The other thing is all night long I had about 30 mosquitoes clinging to my tent waiting to suck my blood. Every time I unzipped for something 2-3 would get it and it was “game on” until I killed them or they got me. I woke up to a great sunrise and a valley of clouds that looked like a river. I had four miles to get to town and that went pretty quick. There was a pub called Gyp’s .2 to the left that was supposed to open at 9. It was 855 and no sign of an employee. I walked .2 back to the trail, then .8 the other direction to Jumboland Diner where I had breakfast. I then walked/sleep walked .8 back to the trail. It was now 11 and Gyp’s opens at 11. When I was there earlier I noticed comfy chairs in back overlooking the lake. I walked the .2 back to Gyp’s and they were so nice. I got a beer and was able to charge my electronics. I was so comfortable sitting and staring at the lake. I had three different customers have extensive conversations with me about the trail, hiking and life. One couple was so tickled they wanted to buy my lunch so they could say they bought a through hiker lunch. I said thank you but absolutely not. Gyp’s sold some hiker supplies so I bought a few things. I got back on trail about 2. About an eighth of a mile back on trail I saw a sign for Trail Magic.  A guy named Moose does trail magic there Every Day!!! I sat and had trail magic for about 45 minutes. This day was going to be a short day. I figured I’d hike for a bit and find a stealth spot. There were no stealth spots for 9 miles. I made it to the 2nd shelter and set up camp and ate. I met a through hiker named Oatmeal. At about 8 o’clock 12 youths ""yoots""  rolled in with a leader. They are learning how to set up a camp step by step. At 839 they still hadn’t eaten and are playing a version of a drinking game but are not drinking.","Blue Mtn. Stealth Site 1319.5

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620003,"I started out tired today and missing home, family, and friends. I didn’t expect the PA rocks to just end at the state line, and they haven’t but they have gotten better. I walked for about 6 miles before I got to High Point State Park where the highest point in NJ is. I stopped at the headquarters and if you sign the book you get a free soda. 
I saw a guy there named Jarhead. I haven’t seen him in months. He said he was hiking with High Gear. I also have not seen him in months. He was meeting him in 20 miles. There was no way I was doing 20 miles. I also met a guy from Korea who started June 1. He’s doing 30+ a day!!! I refueled and recharged there. I also made plans for the night. 
My next stop was Unionville for resupply and lunch. On the way I met my 1st true southbound hikers. I was walking toward the highest point on the AT in NJ and I could hear kids yelling and I could see a lake. I could also smell hotdogs cooking. The trail never brought me near the lake or hotdogs. I did see some wild hens though. 
I was walking downhill at one point and I came across a true switch back. I haven’t walked a switch back in what seems like months. It made me smile. I made it to the road crossing for Unionville. 
There were a bunch of hikers around a truck they whistled and I waved hello and ask if I was going the right direction to town. They said yes. They whistled again and offered me a ride. Jarhead was in the group. He said they were going another 12, I couldn’t do another 12. Sunshine’s parents gave me a ride to town where I resupplied and then went to the Wits End for lunch and hydration. 
As I was approaching I noticed the parking lot was pretty full for 2pm on a Monday. I was setting my pack outside and I could hear loud talking and F’bombs from inside. I walked in and there was a long L shaped bar. Every bar stool was taken except 3 seats on the short end of the L near the door. I sat and order a beer and a burger. The loud talking was just that, loud talking and one guy who liked to drop the F’bomb. 
Food was good and I was looking at the mileage chart. The arrangements I made for the nights stay were 12 miles away not 2!! I let them know I would not be coming. I met a hiker there named High Tower. Now time to regroup and find a spot to stay. The next shelter is 5 miles away-2.5 hours. It’s now 530. I started walking and said if I could find a good stealth spot I’d stop. 
In NJ you are only supposed to camp in designated spots or near shelters, in other words only near shelters. I found a great spot in a hay field with an eastern view. I was hesitant but I set up there. Worst case scenario I get woken up and have to move. Best case, sleep like a baby and get a great sunrise. 
So a side note on bugs, and I hate to say any of this. I have not used bug spray but once this whole trip. I get set up and in my tent before mosquitoes get crazy. I have only seen one tick and that was yesterday. The gnats are bad at times. I hear them by my ears. If I don’t bat at them they fly in front of my face. If I don’t immediately bat at them they dive bomb my eyes. I don’t understand. Not one gnat has made it into my eye and survived. What is it about my irresistible, sweet eye nectar they just can’t stay away from? One will never know?.

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620004,"Today started out great. I slept alright in spite of being in n fear of being asked to move or being run over by farm equipment as I was stealthing in a farmer’s field. The sun lit up the Valley/mtn. range I had a view of and as I was having coffee a family of Turkeys walked by. I was packed and on trail just after 7.  Early in the day there was some road walking that led to a walk around the Wallkill River National Wildlife Refuge which was beautiful. I saw frogs, a deer, ducks, blue herons, tan cranes, and a huge flock of white cranes. The walk around the refuge was flat and beautiful but in full sun, luckily it was not that hot....yet. A short time later I walked through the Pochuck Creek Recreation Area. This is a huge park basically through a swampland. The trail goes on a mile plus boardwalk that is handicapped accessible. I met a nice older couple there with their daughter. They were admiring my backpack and asking me many questions. I still haven’t gotten tired of talking to people about hiking the Appalachian Trail. The boardwalk was mostly in the sun so I got hot. Good thing there was a hotdog stand ahead and homemade ice cream across the street. I rested at those two places a short while. The next section I knew had a steep uphill. While walking up I was warned of a bear that was near the trail and not moving for people. I seemed to have remembered reading in Guthooks that the bear has three legs or is injured. I never saw the bear. At the lookout there was two couples there. They started asking me a bunch of questions about the Trail. Again, I still love talking about the trail. I had 3.5 to get to the shelter. I was getting really hot and tired. I had wrung out my shirt twice today because it was so wet with sweat? I found a clear creek and washed my shirt and body.  It felt so good.  I crossed a road about a mile before the shelter and found trail magic consisting of cold sodas. It’s amazing what a cold trail magic soda can do for your state of mind. I made it to the shelter and there was one guy resting/waiting out the heat. I set up my tent and headed the .4 to the ranger station for fresh water. It was an easy walk. Dinner was made and consumed. I am hoping NY has more in the way of stealth camping. NJ forbids it so there are not many options. The upcoming shelters are stretched out.  The next shelter is 12 miles. 12 is too short of a day. After that the next one is 27 miles which is way to far.  I’m going to have to stealth.","Stealth Camping Site-Farmers Field

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620264,"I woke up a little later than normal and Ranger was getting his food bag from the bear box which was near my tent.  Ranger is a younger guy who is traveling with a group that I had met the day I got back on trail. The group is behind and Ranger was out early.
It was hot and still last night. I had a hard time sleeping. It’s been a week since I did laundry. I showered last Wednesday. I’ve lost a shirt so I have one shirt to wear. Last night right before sleeping I heard some soft screeching and I saw an owl swoop into a tree. I watched it for about 15 minutes as it went from tree to tree. 
I got on trail at 8. I had 10 miles to get to the Creamery at the next town. I stopped at the ranger station for water. The AWOL guide warned of rough terrain. The whole morning was walking a rocky ridge line, up and down. It was hot and I rang out my shirt two different times. 
I met up with High Tower again and we walked into the creamery together. It’s supposed to rain today and I could see the storm front moving in. I turned around with my ice cream and Jarhead was standing there. He said he was staying down the street with High Gear and his girlfriend. 
I heard s clap of thunder and my mind was made up. I booked a Motel for the night. Jarhead and I caught a Lyft to the Motel and got a tour of town and a stop at the beer store, no liquor. 
The motel was nothing fancy but it was clean. You call the manager and he gives you a room number. The rooms are open and the key is inside. I split a room with Jarhead. We had late lunch, and later, dinner at the restaurant next door. 
I called the manager in the evening about laundry and he said he’d be back shortly. We were in bed sleeping and he called the room at 950 and made us come down and pay for the room. I dropped off my laundry too. He called again at almost midnight for us to come down and pay.","Wawayanda Shelter

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620265,"Motel sleep was alright. Our laundry was clean and hanging on the door. I took a second/morning shower and I trimmed the beard. I went across the street for coffee because the was no coffee or bagels at the motel, even though he said there would be.
Jarhead arranged for a ride back to the trail. I got dropped off but Jarhead is six miles ahead of me. We exchanged numbers and he said he’d text me about water sources.

There were not many sources but I was fine all day. The day was hot and there were several short steep climbs. Three of the climbs required using your hands and reaching over your head. The first one I pulled myself up a steep point and was face to face with a small snake. Luckily it slithered past me. I saw another snake 20 feet later I had to get a stick and move it. 
The last climb was the Lemon Squeezer. It was a narrow crevasse and I had to take my pack off and lift it over my head to set it on a ledge then climb up. The trail was beautiful today with many areas of less dense forest with grass or fern floor.

I encountered trail magic half way through the day sponsored by a through hiker who was taking the day off. Jarhead opted for a hotel room for the night. I met some new and old hikers today; George, Ira, Roadrunner, & when I got to the shelter AhhhKash was there. We chatted for quite a while. 
I saw several deer today. Buck, Doe and fawns. There are many warnings of aggressive bears at this shelter. Everyone hung their food bags and we didn’t see any bears. 
I noticed the other day I really don’t hear the trees rubbing together any more like I did early in the trip-making that creeky/screaming noise. I also noticed in the last few days how silent the woods can be, not a sound for long periods of time.","Bellvale NY-Warwick Motel

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620427,"In the first 15 minutes of being on the trail I saw a Buck, Doe, fawn and the 10 minutes later I saw another Buck. The day started out cool but when the clouds/fog burned off it got hot. Aaah Kash and I leap frogged each other all day. There were several views today where you could barely see the NY City skyline. There were also several points you had a great view of the Hudson River. At one of the shelters on top of West Mountain I laid down in the grass to rest and fell asleep. If I had water or a water source I would have camped up there. It would have been a short day but a night view of NYC may have been cool.  While walking I felt something biting the back of my left achilles, I looked down and it was a hornet. It stung me. That was the first time on trail I had been stung. I later saw a SOBO who’s right eye was completely swollen shut. I asked him if he had gotten bit he said yeah a couple of days ago. I asked him if he taken a Benadryl? he said not yet! He had just walked through or near a town. I would have had that checked out. I was tired and craving something cold. From the top of West Mountain you could see Bear Mountain and the Perkins Memorial Observation Tower. There are vending machines there. I drank almost all of my water on the way. The vending machine had Coke, Dr. Pepper and Power Ade. I opted for Dr. Pepper. It was soooo cold and good, I had a second. The trip down from Bear Mountain to Bear Mountain Inn was 2 miles. I was alot of stairs. I did see a few more deer. At the Inn there is a deli. I had a sandwich, Fritos, 1 Modelo, and a ginger ale. I knew I had a least 2 more miles. It turned out to be 4. I left the Inn and walked through the park. The trail goes through a zoo and hikers get free entry. The zoo was closed so I had to take the bypass. What a crumby trail. A good word is nasty.  I then crossed the Hudson River and got to walk along side of the roadway for a half mile with cars whipping by me on my side and bumper to bumper traffic on the other. The trail finally cut into the woods and started a brutal late day accent. I got to the campsite which is kind of blah but, had a few nice flat spots. Another couple showed up. She may be a hiker but her man friend is not. About 7 other hikers showed up. Some I knew some I didn’t. Milestones today, I hit my lowest point on the trail. Correction I hit the lowest point on the trail, elevation wise, it was 160 ft above sea level. I also hit the 1400 mile marker.","Fingerboard Shelter

Broken glass etc. There ended up being about 9 of us there. I did not sleep well. I think it was mostly due to the heat and humidity. There were two other things going on. First, a bug kept making a noise and it was loud and mostly consistent. I liken it to a dripping faucet. Then it’d stop you’d relax and it would start again. The second thing is the squirrels are getting squirrelly and going nuts?? The acorns must be just ripe because the is a non stop barrage of nuts falling from the trees. Today was hot and humid again. I was making good time the first 4 miles to the Appalachian Trail Deli, which is a Shell gas station with a deli inside with short order cooks. I got breakfast and resupplied. There was a lady, I think a little mentally ill. She was the “unofficial greeter” and was chewing the ear of another hiker. I finished my resupply and got back on trail. I was tired so at the 1st view I took a good rest, almost a nap. I repeated this two hours later. There was a parking lot late in the day that has a water spigot. I was good with the amount of water I had, but rationed to that lot. I was actually hoping there’d be trail magic there. I came around the corner and I saw grill smoke and several hikers laying on the grass, YES!!! Perfect timing. I relaxed, ate, and almost slept. It was getting late and I still had 6 miles to do. I made it to the South end of the park, and had two more miles to get to the hiker campsite. Off of the AT they had a blue blaze trail to the campsite. The campsite was right off the beach near the lake, I thought. The maintenance workers came and told us we were in the wrong spot. I was not set up yet do I walked another. 2 to the hiker campsite. I set up and walked back to take a shower. Yea, the shower was ice cold. So I did the best I could. Back at the campsite there were no trees, no bear cables, and no bear box. I ended up being the only hiker out there. Then the thunderstorm rolled in.

No one moved and no one else set up there.  I packed a wet tent and most everything else was wet too. I swear it adds at least 5 lbs. I left camp and headed to the bathhouse where I cleaned up and stocked up on water. If you haven’t noticed I like to break up my day into small goals. The first goal was to make it to the first shelter. I did and it was nice. You can have pizza delivered there. I did not. But, I did relax in one of the sun chairs for a while. Goal two was the 10 mile marker. Here is a road crossing where you can walk .5 miles to a pizza joint or a deli. As I walked up two hikers were sitting in front of the pizza joint having a beverage. “Pizza placed is closed, closed on Sundays.” I decided I was going to the Deli?. I ordered a sandwich and a beverage. We were sitting on the sidewalk in front of the deli relaxing and the owner came out and told us there were chairs, grass, electric, water, and a table in back. We header for the back. There was an old man sitting at the table sleeping. I later noticed he had two Naty Daddy 40oz malt liquors in front of him. 8% alcohol. He slept the whole time we were there. Two others showed up and we all chilled and chatted. No one was in a big hurry as it was hot and the next shelter was 4 miles away. As I was leaving I grabbed my  phone from the outlet and I noticed the hiker girl had left here battery backup plugged in. I grabbed it in hopes of catching up to her and her boyfriend. I caught them taking a break an hour later, charger returned. The third goal of the day was to make it to the second shelter where I would spend the night. I made it there and immediately hung everything to dry from last night’s rain. The mosquitoes are bad here and I used bug spray for the 2nd time?. On the way there I passed about 15 teenage girls in three different groups. I said hello as I passed and they all said hello. I was about an 1/8 of a mile ahead of them and I could still hear them. They were loud. I thought they are probably hiking to the same shelter. They were, they showed up 20 minutes later.

He said we met back in Virginia. I kinda remember but not really. I checked my notes later I had met him and his brother Sparrow on Memorial Day, that seems forever ago. I had also met Hat Trick that day. He wears three hats and he’s supposedly a day or two ahead. Sparrow is off trail. I made it to the Natural Landscapes place. They only had an outdoor cold water shower, I still took one. There was a food truck next door so Tweedle Dee, Tweedle Dum, and I went next door. I had a Philly Cheesesteak. Once back on trail I had 6 more miles to the shelter. It was awful because the gnats have become so thick and aggressive. You swat at one you hit 4-5. They are thick and you can see them swarming around you. I was swatting at them for 3 hours while walking. At the shelter NightWalker was getting a fire going and that really helped.

I heard several roosters in different areas. I also crossed several streams that were flowing. It’s been a while since I crossed nice flowing streams. Just before the Store you walked along a river with rapids and the over a covered bridge, the morning was nice. The people at the country store were nice. We charged our phones, ate, and hung out on the picnic tables in front for about an hour. I still wanted to do 14 miles.

My sister in law bought me a BUFF for my birthday. I put that on my head like a bandanna and covered my ears. If I did not have that and didn’t do that I may have gotten off trail. 
The middle section of the hike was flat along a river. It was a pleasant view for several miles. I knew there was at least four good climbs before I got to the shelter. Weather was showing rain from 1200 on. I got a few alerts on my phone and heard some thunder but the rain never came. I made it to the shelter by 500. 
I got set up and went for water which was a good 1/4 mile. I made dinner in my tent because of the bugs. I was still getting weather warnings. I battened down the hatches and it came. I must be in a low spot because my tent is almost afloat. The bottom of the tent is kinda like a water bed. Thankfully I am dry lying on my air mattress.","Mt. Algo Shelter

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620679,"It rained all night. When I woke up I was no longer in a puddle. It actually wasn’t too bad packing up. The rain fly was soaked but everything else was not bad. I knew I only had 15 miles and I would be in a hostel. Hot shower, bed, laundry, and the ability to dry everything out. I don’t know if you are aware but I try to keep my journal rated G, and positive. But I am going to share some recent feelings, still rated G. I describe the hike as 1st half and second half. Pre and Post being off trail from July 6-22. When I got off on July 6 I had a nasty/infected blister on my right heel, and what I would describe as pre or onset of plantar fasciitis. I bought new shoes at home, good shoes but probably not the right shoes for the remaining miles I had in Pennsylvania. 1st half I was doing 20+ miles a day for a few weeks. 2nd half my feet hurt every day , and I may have tendinitis in my left Achilles. I’m struggling to get 15 a day. I am a Licensed Massage Therapist so I’ve been keeping a close eye on everything and working it out with a golf ball daily. This doing less miles a day is actually good physically but not mentally. I have lost all of the trail “friends” I was walking with. But I have met some, new to me, hikers that are great people. I am also missing home, friends, and family after having seen alot of people on my break. To add to things it’s been hot and stupid humid. The other day I was able to wring water out of my shirt after an hour and a half of hiking. Then the bugs really started, they were/are awful. Constantly being swarmed by 100s of them. Flying in your face, into your eyes, into your ears. I’ve eaten several. The first day I used a ball cap to swat at them constantly for four hours. The second day it started again. I was seriously ready to call it quits. Mentally, emotionally, and physically tired, and now uncontrollable bugs. I remembered my brother and sister in law gave me a Buff. I put it on like a headband and covered my ears. It made all of the difference in the world. Today my spirits were lifted. I saw many orange salamanders, I talked to a few friends on the phone, I talked to Seaneen, and my mom is saying a rosary for me daily. I know many of you are cheering for me and wishing me well.....Thank You!! To top off this day the hostel I’m staying at is run by the sweetest 90 woman named Marie. She is awesome and told me she was glad I was there. I’m comparing where I’m at on the hike to the 17-20 mile mark of a marathon. That is where things start to fall apart. That’s where you have to reach into the reserves and see what you are made of. Percentage wise I’m at that point on the trail. I will finish, it’s just time to mentally focus and remind myself I’m Just Taking Steps?

I had noticed the kitchen table was set. I didn’t realize we got breakfast. I saw Whip and Buck outside the grocery store. It was 745 so I went across the street for a coffee and pastry. On the way out three women Jen, Loralyn, & Leah stopped me to ask me some trail questions. Two of them, Loralyn & Leah we’re headed out to walk the Massachusetts section of the AT northbound. 
I enjoyed my coffee and pastry with them, and we went our ways. The grocery store had everything I needed. I bought granola instead of oatmeal. I also bought more tuna packets so I can add one of them to each night’s Ramen. 
Back at Maria’s I organized my pack and Maria insisted I make myself breakfast. I made three eggs and toast. I gave Maria a big hug on my way out and thanked her. 
Back on the trail it was nice. There was a breeze and the humidity was down. Bugs were not an issue today. At one point Goat came flying past me, he said he was going to slack pack all of Massachusetts and Timone and Night Walker were not far behind. 
I did not see any other through hikers until the last mile. The woods were beautiful today and there were a couple of good climbs with great views. About a half mile before camp I met 4 through hikers. One guy was Mr. President.  He remembered meeting me outside of the Shenandoahs. Rick had given him and a few others a ride.

I got to camp and  Loralyn and Leah were there. Mr. President arrived shortly after. We all sat at the picnic table and chatted through dinner.

I was hiking along enjoying the morning contemplating whether or not to go into Great Barrington. I caught up to the NH ladies and had a break with them. We hiked and chatted for the rest of the morning. 
We saw sheep and later a lady walking two dogs, one was a Newfoundland named Summit. Summit was huge but oh so sweet and slobbery. 
We found trail magic put on by a church 1 mile later. They have a pole tent they set up for hiker season. The magic was great and at the right time and place. I could have sat in a chair for hours. I think I was there for just over an hour. 
My hiker hunger still has not returned. I did eat quite a bit though. Back on trail just after the trail magic I saw a cooler, the sodas were gone but there were a few mini candy bars. There was also stamped envelopes and stationery so you could write a letter home and they’d mail it. 
I pressed on and I caught, and passed, the ladies again. I saw several deer, snakes, and salamanders. I made it to the shelter and there were two sweet tent pads there. I don’t use tent pads because there is nothing for me to steak my tent to. I found a great spot. 
The water was 1/4 mile straight downhill, so I got that out of the way. Several hikers arrived and got set up. There is a trail runner staying here, nice girl. Her mom is here for dinner but then hiking out. The mom packed in cold root beers for everyone.","Glen Brook Shelter

Today was a good day. I woke and it was clear and cool. Myself and several others were going to push for 22 miles to Goose Pond Cabin. There is a beautiful pond you can swim in and they make coffee and pancakes. I have not done a 20+ day since I’ve been back.

There were a few good climbs and I knew it was going to be tough. I headed out about 715. I leapfrogged the NH girls all day. We were told of trail magic at a road crossing. It wasn’t actually trail magic but a farm with a stand/shed that had a charging station, cold sodas, and a few snacks for sale. We stopped and had a soda and some snacks. 
The NH Girls do 10 push-ups at every peak. So, I started doing push-ups at the peaks too. I regularly do push-ups anyway. The rest of the day was just long and it was good for all of us to have company. 
We got to Goose Pond Cabin at 645. We got set up and I climbed in my tent to make dinner and avoid mosquitoes. The girls went swimming. I talked to the caretaker and they do serve coffee and pancakes. Coffee starts at 600, pancakes at 7.

We got a late start due to the pancakes. I was way out in front when I came to a stare down with a doe up trail. I stopped and took a picture and it started walking toward me. I switched to video and it walked right up to me. I put out my hand and it sniffed my hand. 
I continued on. About 100 yards later I walked 100 feet down and across a gravel rd. I saw an old man walking and I said hello. He said I see you found my deer. I was thinking, how did he know I saw a deer? I turned around and the deer was following me. He said, that’s friendly. She followed me down here. She has a doe back up by the house. He must feed them.  
I stopped at the next shelter to take a break. I met a guy from Cape Town. He’s in country for business and had some time so he spent 1 night on the AT. We were looking forward to the Cookie Lady. As we approached the Cookie Lady’s house the guy from Cape Town stopped us and offered me the gas canister he had used twice. 
The Cookie Lady owns the blueberry farm and regularly puts out cookies for hikers. We stopped and got to meet her. She was a sweet lady, and gave us cookies. She’s been doing it for 30 years! 
We pressed on, it was getting late and we still had miles to do. At about 3 miles out we came across a trail magic, perfect timing, perfect location. The lady providing said her daughter walked the AT two years ago. She had a great selection of goodies. I had a nutterfluff sandwich and some other stuff.

We still had 3.5 and our ETA to the shelter was after 700. It was a long day, especially after yesterday’s 22 miles. We made it and set up. I climbed in my tent full from trail magic.

The screaming was horrific, worse than any horror movie. It finally quieted down. Then about 10 minutes later one of them started howling for 2-3 minutes. The coyote yelling started again as I was making my coffee. Very busy coyotes ??. On the way to Dalton we saw a porcupine, It ran up a tree. We hiked 3 miles into Dalton and went to the Dalton diner for breakfast. We met an old timer named Bob. We invited him to sit with us and we conversed for 45 mins.

After showering we went to the post office and liquor store. Next stop laundry and pizza joint.  Just as we were wrapping up at the laundry it started raining. We rain geared up and went to the country store for resupply. We had just over 4 miles and about a mile of it was on the residential sidewalk. Once back in the woods it was slight uphill to the shelter. We counted five peaks/bumps. Ten push-ups at each bump, I did 15 each time. On the way we met a day hiker out to met his SOBO friend. His name is Nightmare. He walked and chatted with us, he even did push-ups. We even got another SOBO, Chef to do push-ups. The hike was short today.

I spent the night in a motel in Williamstown. The room was comfortable. I hung out in the room until about 1000 then went to check out.  I questioned the owner as to why the rate was so high for a Thursday night and he took offense. It turned into a sort of argument. I then told him I was not going to pay extra for him letting my friends shower in the room. It ended with me telling him I did not have $20, and he could charge my credit card for the balance. I paid him the $20 about an hour later, and before I left he gave me the $20 back, saying he wanted me to leave happy. I was never unhappy. I just wanted to know why the rate was so high. 
I sat in the lobby for an hour trying to get a ride to Bennington through Uber or Lyft. I finally got a Lyft ride. That Lyft guy was a real winner, Not. He shows up at the motel and parks way in the back where I can’t see him. He has plugs in all of the seat belts so he doesn’t have to wear seat belts and the alarm doesn’t sound. I put my seat belt on. We were chatting, as it was a 40 minute ride. It came out I just retired from Law Enforcement. He starts asking me legal advice but, has no clue what he is talking about.  
Long story short “someone” was driving his vehicle and hit a pedestrian. There is video. He doesn’t know who was driving. His son’s license was taken away by the police 2 years later. He wanted my advice on the matter, and was going through text showing me the video while driving mountain roads. I couldn’t get out of that car fast enough. 
I was able to check into the hotel early, and I unpacked and started washing my backpack. I went to the pool to check it out. My room would then not open.  Maintenance had to remove the whole locking mechanism, which took hours.  In the mean time I was given another room.  All of my belongings were locked in the broken room, including my wallet.

We went to a nearby breakfast joint, Papa Pete's.  On a side note, this breakfast/lunch place was oozing with warmth and friendliness, the food was awesome, definitely worth the stop.   After breakfast I needed to get some hiking supplies so we headed to the nearest outfitters. I bought a new pair of hiking shoes and new socks. I also bought a bug net to wear on my head. Now I won’t have to wear nylons on my head-Rhonda!

About an hour into my trip Seaneen notified me her flight was delayed by 2 hours. I kept climbing. Thirty minutes later I received bad news - Seaneen’s flight was cancelled. I immediately turned that bad news into good news. A bonus day with Seaneen! This meant I had to add 4 miles to my trip.

I was on trail in good time. Last night I was looking for a place to set up. I had found a good flat spot but there were about 50 huge house flies buzzing around. I found another spot and less flies but there were about 30 between my tent and the rain fly. All day today there were flies everywhere. They did not bother me I could just hear  them buzzing all day. 
I knew there was a good climb near the end of the day so I was trying to take the day slow. There were several beautiful beaver dams/ponds today. I took a couple long breaks. The climb started about 200 and lasted about 2 hours. It wasn’t a steep climb but it was long. I got tired and my legs got tired. I tripped near the top and fell. I caught the brunt of it with the heel of my left hand and my left thigh. My left thigh landed on a rock. I’ll be interested to see if it bruises. My left wrist is a little sore. I also turtled myself. I had to unbuckle myself from my pack in order to stand up, which I did slowly. 
I made it to the top. There was a fire tower so I climbed it. You can see three ski areas from there. I was talking to Stretch who had arrived. I told him I was going to Stratton Pond Shelter. He said there was a $5 fee. I looked for stealth spots but I ended up at the shelter. There was not a caretaker so I did not have to pay the fee. 
There were two other hikers there. I prepared dinner, ate, and went to bed.  The bad thing about staying in a shelter is no bug screening. I had to fight off mosquitoes. Several hikers came in late last night. I think they tried to be quiet but they weren’t. Their lights were shining all over and they were cooking and eating.

I saw Stretch late afternoon he was slack packing SOBO but, will be back to NOBO tomorrow.  Just before camp, about a half mile. I came across a sign that said 500 miles to Katahdin. That actually stirred some emotions. By the time I made it to camp I was tired, total miles 19.7. I set up made a Mountain House meal and a Ramen. I saw quite a bit of wildlife today: Deer, Salamander, Toad, and 20-30 Turkeys.","Little Rock Pond Shelter

My head was lower than my feet unless I raised the pillow uncomfortably high and the tent was leaning toward the door. I slept alright and was on trail by 815. I didn’t want to head out too early because I want the restaurant at the top of Killington to be open. I hiked up and thought I was close. There was a view, and I saw the resort still another mile away. At the turn off for the summit trail there is a shelter. Some people leave their packs at the shelter to summit. I summited with my pack. The trail was steep and rocky the whole .2. The views were nice. Apparently if you go over the summit another .2 that’s where the summit restaurant is. I totally blew that one. I booked a room for the night while on summit. I met a trail maintainer who was working alone with his 13 year old terrier. He was pretty much knee deep in mud and was swapping out boardwalks for rocks. He had a hand held pulley system to move huge rocks. Later I met 4 NOBO through hikers who were slack packing. They said there are no hikers on trail because there were 57 hikers at the Yellow Deli Hostel last night. The last 2.5 miles of my hike seemed to take a long time. I made it to the 1700 mile marker. I made it to the roadway. It was .9 to the Inn. I didn’t know the bus times so I started walking and threw up my thumb. I had no hitchhiking luck. The Inn is really cute and has an Irish Pub attached to it. I put my pack in the room and went out to catch the bus.  I took the $2 ride to Rutland VT. It was a quick walk to the Wal-Mart. I made the next bus back to the Inn. On the way back we picked up Fastball. I went and showered and went down to the pub to eat some dinner and have a few Guinness. About 8-10 hikers were around the table eating, drinking and listening to music. It was a great night. There were two guys playing guitar and singing Irish Folk Music.

I also ate an Irish dinner; enjoyed Irish music, and Irish beer. The breakfast was awesome and the bus back to the trail head picks you up right in front of the Inn. 
I got on trail at about 930. I was aiming for 17 or so miles. There were several climbs with one being long. I felt great today, the best I’ve felt in a while. I was moving faster than normal and my downhill speed has come back. 
Again, I did not see any NOBO through hikers today. There was a waterfall about 3 miles into my day. There were day hikers on both sides of the falls but once I got past the north parking lot I saw very few hikers the rest of the day. 
I got to the cabin I was planning on staying at. The cabin is privately owned but they allow hikers to stay in the cabin. it is nothing fancy but it is at the top of a mountain and there is a staircase to the roof with a crows nest. On the crows nest there is a 360 view which goes on forever. 
I got settled in and made my dinner. I climbed to the crows nest and enjoyed dinner with the views and sunset. It was amazingly quiet up there. Not a cloud in the sky, no airplanes and no vapor trails. I am setting my alarm to see the stars and the sunrise. Three additional hikers arrived and spent the night there.

The sky was clear and the stars were amazing. I could see the Milky Way faintly. The 1/4 moon had risen so it was illuminating the sky a little. I was still glad I woke up. I went back to sleep and woke up at 545 to see the sunrise. I made my coffee and climbed to the crow’s nest. The sunrise was gorgeous. I saw a sunset, stars, and a great sunrise at this shelter?.

I was on trail before 700, which is a first in a while. I like being on trail that early. I was looking forward to today. There were 3 places to stop for food. The first place is closed on Mondays. The second place was .9 miles off trail (too far for me). On the way to the 3rd place Ranger caught up to me. He had gone to the second place and said it was good. I told him about the third place and he was intrigued. Just before the third place there was soda trail magic by the stream. I had an orange soda. The third place is called the back porch. You walk .2 miles to the first house on left, the one with a red door. You go around back and hang out on the porch and they have a refrigerator full of various things for sale.

 As I rounded the house I saw Mr. President. I’ve been trying to catch him since I zeroed. We are supposed to walk with the NH girls Labor Day weekend. I couldn’t resist the $5 homemade chocolate chip ice cream sandwich, and a couple other items. We headed out and were trying to make it close to Norwich VT. I was shooting for 9 miles out. Mr. President was shooting for 4 miles out. 
At 13 miles out I had to go to the shelter for privy and water. We reconvened and game planned. We decided to stay at 13 out, get up early and hike in to the hostel by noon or one.

We got on trail by 700. We arrived at West Hartford. There is a house there that is hiker friendly. We stopped and had refreshments. There is s bridge over the river there and hikers jump from the bridge. We did not but we watched. 
Back on trail I took the lead for the second half of the day. Many MOBO hikers caught us and we saw many SOBO hikers. The 13 mile day became long and we arrived at Norwich VT. First stop was a micro brewery, then the grocery store. We decided we’d cook at the hostel. 
We arrived at the hostel. The host was great, 83 years old and still going strong. There was no propane. I told Mr. President if the host was not back by 730 we’d fry the burgers. I was hungry! He fried the burgers. 
In the meantime I showered and started laundry. The burgers were alright. The ads said All You Can Eat Ben and Jerry’s. I had a pint.","Thistle Hills Shelter

We hung out at the hostel for a while as each of us was not in a hurry to get back on trail. On the ride back to the trail I saw several Turkeys cross the road. Why doesn’t anyone ever ask why the Turkeys crossed the road? When finally back on trail we had about 3 miles of road walking. The first thing we came to was the bridge over the Connecticut River. The river is the border between Vermont and New Hampshire. I have now completed 12 states, 2 states to go?. We walked through Hanover NH, home of Dartmouth. We stopped at CVS for some snacks. As you head out of town you go back into the woods. The trail was not difficult today but it was some degree of uphill most of the day. We saw a couple deer at different times. There are many NOBO & SOBO hikers. I wouldn’t say we are in the bubble but, (I said bubble but?) we are no longer in the hiker desert. We did not see any trail magic today but, a day hiker gave us Diet Cokes.There is no water at, or near, the shelter. I filled 3-1 liter bottles and hiked them uphill the last two miles. One liter of water weighs 2.2 lbs. Thats an extra 6.8 lbs on a tired body. We kept plugging along and made it to the shelter. Just as I was done setting up it started raining, good timing.

We both were just trudging along today. At the top of the second climb there was a fire tower. I climbed it and got a good look of some of the mountains coming in the next week. We took many breaks and ate as much as we could. We also tried to consume alot of water without carrying too much. 
We didn’t make it to camp until after 7pm. On trail today we saw toads, frogs, and salamanders. I’m forcing myself to eat more tonight. I melted another spoon. I think thats about 7 I’ve broken, melted, or lost. 
At camp there was a group of college kids. They needed to borrow a lighter from me because all of there things had gotten wet in the rain the night before. I loaned them a lighter.

We each had a beer and took a starting photo. We had 3000 feet of vertical at 16+%grade. I was feeling good today and I found myself in the lead. I was booking up the mountain. It got colder and colder as we went up. Once above tree-line it got really windy. At the summit there were at least 50 people hanging out enjoying the views and having a snack or lunch. We stopped and had a snack. The way down was not that bad. Loralynn and I took a short side trail to see a second summit. And, yes we did 10 more pushups.

I’ve been trying to get to sleep earlier. The days are getting shorter so I’m really pushing for early starts. We got dropped off at the trailhead and started about 830. Our first climb was up Wolf Mountain 1500 feet. Wolf wasn’t bad and there was a good downhill before the real climbing began. South Kinsman is 1900 feet with 15% grade over 2.4 miles. About half way up is Harrington Pond. I rounded the corner and said to myself this is Moose country, than I saw a MOOSE. I was so excited I was trying to alert Mr. President and not scare the moose. It was a beautiful scene. About a hundred yards from us in the middle of a mountain pond/swamp was a huge moose wallowing in the middle. Then a second smaller, but huge moose came out of the woods to our left. That moose saw us and slowly returned to the woods. The large moose slowly made its way to the rear of the pond and exited. I could not believe how big it was. This made my day. I was on cloud 9. The remaining way up South Kinsman was steep and difficult. When we got to the top we both agreed it was not that bad, and it was a great climb. We saw a few NOBOs pass us and we met a new to us hiker named Willow. Mr. President saw someone he hadn’t seen since March, PYT. At the shelter there is a caretaker. She was really nice and her name is Cindy Lou Who. In the whites if you pay $10 to stay at the shelter you get a card so you only have to pay $5 at all the others. You also can get free or discounted items at the huts. I set up in the shelter because there are no mosquitoes and it’s supposed to rain.

The shelter was really nice and had a non ton roof so I didn’t hear the rain all night. When I walked out to use the restroom there were rivers of water. We took our time getting moving and planned on doing 15 miles today up Franconia Ridge.
I do not have my rain pants so I was wearing my rain jacket and shorts. I did a pretty good job of keeping my feet dry. I fell pretty early on in the trip, not bad, but a little slip. As I was walking along I noticed a structure and I realized I was at Lonesome Lake Hut. I walked up the stairs and left my bag outside. Hut rules in the Whites are different than shelter rules. People spend money to stay in the huts. I asked the worker the rules for through hikers in the hut. He was really nice and explained the rules. 
I relaxed and had a coffee and a muffin. I also ordered a bowl of soup. Mr. President arrived shortly after. It was raining harder. I spoke to several hut guests about the hut and the trails. I consciously made a decision I was going to get a hotel at the next town in Lincoln. I was wet and getting cold. We continued and Mr. President fell pretty hard just back on trail. The trail was pretty much a river. Mr. President saw a moose early on, I did not see it though. 
We soon thereafter came to a stream crossing. The stream was raging. I was talking earlier to another hiker about how I had not forded a river yet this trip because the water has always been so low. We walked north and south on the bank looking for a good place to cross. I found a spot and only got wet to just under the knee. I got across and I could not see Mr. President. Another hiker, Snickers, started crossing and I saw she was having difficulty. I took my pack off and went halfway to help her. Mr. President started fording and fell right away. He was laying in the stream. He got up and I helped him complete his crossing when he got to the halfway point. I was now wet to almost my shorts and my feet were really cold. 
We continued on and it was about 2 miles to the trailhead. We got to Flume visitor center and I got some information for a shuttle driver. Mr. President bought french fries and beers. We got the shuttle to Lincoln and he even took us to the convenient store. At the hotel I took a hot shower and then we hot tubed at the pool. There is only one restaurant that delivers, we had Chinese. The pizza restaurant across the street was open but everyone we asked and the Yelp reviews said the owner was crazy.  Somehow  A goat was even included in the stories about him, so we passed.

I usually like to be on trail by 700am. We decided we are going to finish yesterday’s hike today so a 10 mile day up Franconia Ridge. We took our time getting ready. We enjoyed hotel breakfast and I arranged the ride back to the trailhead. 
We got dropped off and there was about .8 hike to get back to the trail. I thought the hike up Franconia was kind of boring. I met two ladies, probably in their 70s. They were working on climbing all of the 4000 footers (mountains) of NH, for the 9th time!!!  The have 7 to go to complete it. There are 48-4000 footers.
We finally made it to the ridge and it became a great hike. The ridge was above tree-line and you could see the next peak. We hiked over Little Haystack Mtn, Mt. Lincoln, Mt. Lafayette, and Mt. Garfield. We saw Willow and met No Hitch. No Hitch said he had been hiking with AKA and Pruney. It’d be nice to see them again. They are a day behind. 
Hiking down the back side of Lafayette was dry and above tree line. Once you got below tree line it was as though someone flipped a switch. The trail became damp and very green. Everything was covered in moss. Once on top of Garfield the view was again spectacular, 360. The hike down from Garfield to the shelter was not easy, it was wet and steep. That made my decision to climb back up for the sunset easy, ahhhh no. 
At the shelter I sent up on a tent platform next to Snickers, as the shelter area was supposed to be busy tonight. The shelter was too crowded for my liking. I made a Mtn. House eggs and bacon meal, and Ramen bombed ? it. Basically Ramen bombing is adding Ramen to anything. It’s cold tonight but I am warm and dry in my tent.

I wasn’t miserable today but, everything is damp or wet.
It was cold and windy last night. I was warm in my tent but I am worried about todays hike. It’s currently damp and cloudy. It’s supposed to rain today. I have to make it until Friday when I get the rest of my cold weather gear. We started out and it wasn’t bad. I had pants on for the first time in a long time. I probably didn’t need them but I kept them on. I knew Galehead Hut wasn’t too far and we could take a break there. We got there and enjoyed some coffee and blueberry muffins. There were several hikers there and more arrived. It started raining hard. A few of the hikers booked rooms at the hut for $150. I played a game of cards with several hikers. Prior to leaving I bought a cheap poncho as an extra layer of protection. We decided to press on. We had a 1200 foot climb up South Twin Mtn. It rained but not bad. It was really windy up top. As we approached Mt. Guyot we heard a couple claps of thunder and it was close. We got to the tree line and there was an exposed summit. We made a decision to go for it. I went really fast over the top, as if that would help?⚡️. We made it over safe. The next mountain was Zealand which wasn’t bad. We stopped at the Zealand Mtn. Hut and had some soup, coffee, and snacks. We pressed on the last 4.9 miles. I was wet but not really wet and I was cold but not really cold. As we approached Whitewall Slide the sun started to come out a little. I was able to shed my poncho and rain jacket. We made it to Ethan Pond Shelter after 630. I set up right away and made dinner.

I made coffee with Swiss Miss and that warmed me up a little more. I then had two servings of hot granola. I was ready just after 7. The last thing I had to do was put my hiking shoes on. I had dry socks but when I put my shoes on the were cold, wet, and squishy. 
I walked down by Mr. President and he still had a few things to do. I had most of my clothes on. We headed out and once I was moving I was a little warmer. It took almost 2 miles before I was warm. We had 2.5 miles of downhill and then the uphill began. The first climb was 3000 feet over 5 miles. At the top we found an open area and laid out all of our things to dry. Rocket and Rooster came by. We thought they were still a day or two ahead. Then Snickers arrived and she hiked with us most of the day. At the top of the second summit I saw Hat Trick, the guy that wears three hats. I haven’t seen him since Memorial Day. 
The AT goes through the presidentials. A series of mountains named after presidents. I was not seeing many president mountains on Guthooks or in AWOL. I learned many of the summits for presidentals are bypassed. I find that odd because it seems the AT makes you go over the top of everything. We saw a helicopter landing at the next hut, Mizpah. They made several trips bringing in supplies and taking out stuff. I used their restroom and got some much needed snacks. 
We continued on 5 more miles to Lakes of the Clouds Hut. Guest pay upwards of $150 to stay there. Through hikers can pay $10 to sleep on the common/dinner room floor with rules. You can’t lay down until after 930pm and get woken up by 530am. I’ll take it, The other option was to sleep in the dungeon. I checked out the dungeon, it had a steel door and looked like a dungeon.

The hike up to Mt. Washington wasn’t bad, about an hours hike. At the top they have a visitor center with a snack shop. Mt. Washington held the record at one point for the highest recorded wind speed in the world. We hung out there and snacked for quite a while. We had more miles to do and more climbing. We said goodbye to section hiker Snickers. We headed out and the terrain changed to nothing but rock scramble. We felt we were moving good but our forward progress was slow. 
We stopped for a rest at Madison Hut. I decided there was no way we were going to make it to town before dark. We stated we’d reassess at Osgood Campsite. We set out and climbed over Mt. Madison which wasn’t bad. All the intel said the backside of Madison was brutal. It was brutal but my kind of brutal. I hopped and skipped the rock scramble all the way down to the tree line. Then the trail remained steep but my progress slowed tremendously.
I made it to the campsite, loaded up with water, and got set up for the evening. Mr. President followed shortly after. The trail was rough today and drained me mentally and physically.

I chatted with them fir a while and they gave me a peppermint Lifesaver. A girl I used to work with always gave out those. I asked them to give Mr. President a hard time and to suck it up! I didn’t think I was making good time in the rain and slop. There was a really steep section and it was wet and muddy. I went down most of it on my butt. Once I got over the final climb I started really moving. I got to the trailhead and saw Tumbledorf, Ridge Runner, and Riff Raff. I called my hostel for a ride and looked at my phone for the time. I had done 14 miles in 7 hrs. 15 mins. It felt good to be moving that fast again. I had woke up to a massive left calf cramp this morning. I can still feel it but it did not bother me all day.I got picked up in a 4 door white 1986 Cadillac Fleetwood. At the hostel I was getting the run down and another hiker offered me his Poutine. It really hit the spot. There are a bunch of great people at the hostel and the mood is positive. I was soaked and cold so I changed and hit the shower. I did my laundry and Mr. President made it in about 430. We did the Wal-Mart run and I bought too much food. I put some in the hiker box. We went to an Italian restaurant for dinner. It was awesome. After dinner we walked back and stopped for a six pack. It took me quite a while to organize my food bag and laundry. By the time I finished chores it was bed time. I have to be up early for breakfast as the return to trailhead shuttle leaves at 710.","Carter Dome Stealth 1879.7

I ate breakfast with four other hikers. Two NOBO and two SOBO. It was great they were talking about the history of the trail and about logging and conservation. I finished my breakfast and headed back to the hostel. We got a ride from the hostel to the trail head and got started. The day was going to be long at 17 miles. We have not done 17 in a while and there was almost 7000 ft of accent and 4300 ft of decent. We did well on the first climb as it was not to steep. I believe I am carrying the heaviest pack I have carried the whole trip. We don’t get to another hostel until Friday. The weight was tiring me out. We took a break and laid out some things to dry. Rocket and Rooster caught up. After break I started hiking a little faster as I wanted to make it to camp before dark. We crossed the 1900 mile marker. On the walk today there were many mountain ponds to include Page Pond. The environment was ripe for a moose sighting but, no moose. Late in the day I crossed from New Hampshire to Maine. 13 states down 1 to go? The last mile from the border to the shelter was brutal steep, wet, muddy, rocky downhill. I made it to shelter at dark and walked down to get water. There was only a light trickle. It took me a while to fill three bottles as it was getting darker. I got a little lost on the way back in the dark but, I found the shelter. I made my dinner and warmed up in my sleeping bag.","2 Libby Hostel 1893.7

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622758,"I tossed and turned a lot last night. There were two of us in the shelter, Phoenix and I. Phoenix is on a mission to finish by the 26th because her dad got a moose license this year and the season in only 6 days. I get a text from Mr. President, he stealthed south of where I was. That gave me a few extra minutes in the sleeping bag. I met him at the cut off to the trail. We hiked a couple nice mountains and I got turned around at one point and was hiking the wrong way. Luckily, Phoenix came along and I was only about an eighth of a mile in the wrong direction. Mr. President and I met up again atop the next mountain. I stepped on a boardwalk and it sank so I decided to jump to the next one and it sank too. Both feet got soaked with stinky swamp water. We made it to the next shelter to take a break and get ready for Mahoosuc Notch, described as: The most difficult or fun mile on the AT. The first thing I noticed is about 50 feet into the notch the temperature dropped 15-20 degrees. The Notch is basically a deep valley between two cliffs filled with large boulders you have to go over, under, or around. Hikers usually average less than 1 mph during this stretch. I did it in about an hour twenty. It was a lot of fun, and there was ice in a couple of crevices. I waited at the next campsite for Mr. President. We had one more big climb to finish the day. We were stopping short of our goal but it was a tough day. The shelter was full so I put up my tent on a platform. I ate a lasagna dinner and a ramen. Hiker hunger is in full force. I normally eat 3-4 Cliff type bars a day. I think I ate at least 8 today and a bunch of M&Ms.","Carlo Col Shelter

It was the first night in a long time I wasn’t borderline cold. It rained most of the night very lightly and was raining as I was getting ready to pack. I was shooting for 17 miles today, there are some climbs but hopefully the terrain will be a little more forgiving. I was talking to Seaneen last night about the Katahdin summit date. there’s about 20 days of hiking left, give or take a few days either way. Since I’ve been back from vacation in July I’ve been averaging 13.56 miles a day. At that pace I will summit on Monday the 30th. I’m pretty sure I can do more miles than that the next 2 weeks. I talked to Seaneen later and we set the summit date for October 1st, the anniversary date of our first date back in 1998. We started out strong hiking today, and at 5 miles hit a parking lot at a trail head. We analyzed our day and decided on a hostel for the evening. We still had 10 miles to do and it was 1100 am. The 10 miles ended up not being too easy. We climbed for a while and took a break with Rocket, Rooster, and Executioner. There was still more climbing to do. We went over a mountain bald like no other we had. It was cloudy, rainy, windy, and slick! The wind had to have been gusting at 50+ mph, as it was blowing me off my gait. On the downhill I took off and reevaluated my pace. I wouldn’t hit the road until after 6 pm. The hostel shuttle is at 430pm. Hostel dinner was served at 6pm. I caught the girls just before the road. They had suggested doing a 2 day stay at the hostel and slack packing 10 miles tomorrow. That’s all I needed to hear. On trail, especially up here cell service has been spotty at best. I had to GPS Garmin message Seaneen to call the shuttle driver for us and the call the hostel and let them know we were still coming, and to not give our bunks away. We got the shuttle from the trailhead to the hostel, with a stop at the general store, beer and goodies. The hostel is way cool, a geodesic cabin owned by Ryan Holt a guy who was on Naked and Afraid (I’ve never watched the show). Since we missed dinner I bought a frozen pizza and had a few beers with the other hikers. It’s nice to hear most hikers at this point are excited to be near the end; apprehensive about what’s to come; and cumulatively beat up but not broken from the trail Tomorrow is going to be chill.","Speck Pond Shelter

It was alright because I got a good meal and the hostel has great energy. I was worried when I got the tour because the bunk room was like an ice box. I got my sleeping bag. When I went to bed it was warm in the bunk room and got progressively hotter. I got up at 300 to pee and in the common area it was cool. I curled up on the couch out there and was able to fall back to sleep. Coffee brewed at 6 am and I grabbed a cup. The hostel makes pancakes starting at 630. They are as big as a plate and they have an AT symbol on them. I had mine with butter, berries, and syrup. We, 9 of us, packed into a Yukon and headed for the trailhead. We made a quick stop at the country store. We were slack packing 10 miles today. Mr. President hit the trail running. We stopped at mile 5 and had lunch at the shelter with about 10 other hikers. It’s interesting what other hikers prepare. One guy was grilling peppers and ham making burritos. Another hiker had chunks of cheese and salami burritos. Others ate tuna packs or SPAM. The last 4 miles were less forgiving than the first six but it wasn’t bad. We got to the trailhead 1 hour before pickup so we chilled and chatted with other hikers. We saw ALOT of moose poop on the trail and some moose tracks but no moose?. It seems like a pretty good bubble of hikers headed to Katahdin for end of month summit dates. Tonight is burger night at the hostel. Half pound build your own with pasta side.

Anyway, I never found my blue shirt. I settled my bill and we got shuttled back to the trailhead. I told Mr. President I may take off today. I had a goal and I wanted to make 17 miles.
At some point I got a message from a friend saying my friend Barb was not doing well. She had beaten cancer but, it was back. I received a text a few hours later saying she had died. I was glad I was alone in a way. I spent the rest of the day walking and crying off and on. Life is too short-seize all the moments and cherish them!
I met Barb when I got hired at Bartlett PD in 1995. We were shift-mates and became friends. We were closer at some times than we were at others. Our birthdays were 3 days apart and we’d celebrate together. She was one bad ass police officer. No-one gave her shit! I will miss her!

When I arrived at the shelter for the night I set up my tent and treated the bottom with waterproofing spray. While it was drying I went by the shelter and ate my dinner while talking to other hikers. One of the hikers had built and lit a fire. After dinner and completing setting up I went back by the fire where Rocket, Rooster and Executioner were roasting marshmallows.

I was on trail a little after 700. I stopped to look at the pond and Mr. President came along. He did not make it as far as the shelter and woke up early to catch up. We hiked together for a bit and then I looked back and he wasn’t there. 
I came across six hens on the trail. They were just doing their thing and didn’t care much about me and barely got off of the trail. The day was overcast and it only rained lightly at times which required me to keep my rain gear on. It was chilly but not cold. I came across another hiker wearing just shorts and no shirt. I don’t know how they do it. I later saw a hiker I’ve been leapfrogging and he was dressed like he was ready to summit Everest. He had stopped to eat and had caught a chill.
I stopped at a hostel close to the trail because they had limited resupply and I needed a couple of things. There resupply was really limited and I asked if they had anything to eat. She made me canned ravioli and meatballs which weren’t half bad. I continued on and passed many beautiful ponds. I did not see any moose. I did see several rather large piles of moose poop. 
I decided to stealth camp near Eddy Pond. There were a few other hikers there. I met Giggles and Viking-the real Viking because she’s from Iceland. It was early, just after 3 pm but I was done for the day. I did not want to walk over a mountain in the cold rain. I will do that tomorrow. I had two dinners and laid in my tent. I fell asleep pretty early. I was cold but not shivering. I sleep cold. Most nights, even during the warmer months, I get cold at some point. Tonight I took off all of my wet things and was sleeping in shorts, socks, a t-shirt, and my Frog Togg jacket. I ended up putting my Buff on my head and wrapped my puffy around me. I finally got warm. 
I woke up because someone had yelled. I don’t know what they yelled, and it wasn’t a scream. I got into my pack and grabbed my knife. I got out of my tent to pee and I did not hear or see anything. I got back in the tent thinking it was early morning, and it was 945pm. I have no idea what time I fell asleep but i think it was around 7 pm. Now I have to try to get back to sleep.

I walked down to the pond but did not see any moose. I got on trail by 715. About 100 yards in I came across an ATV trail. I looked up to see where the trail went beyond the ATV trail. There was s body lying across the AT trail at the ATV trail. I thought the guy was dead but he moved. I talked to him for a minute. He had come down from the mountain and ran out of daylight. This was the first flat spot he’d found. So, he cowboy camped there under two blankets. Again I don’t know how some people do it. I’d be way too cold. There was a 4K foot mountain right out of the gate this morning then several more peaks along an open ridge line. It was very windy and gusty up there. I was getting blown around. It was semi clear and the views were great. As soon as I got below tree line and out of the wind it was hot. Pizza Steve and his woman companion passed me. I later learned they were trying to slack 30+miles but came to the conclusion they would come up short and they rearranged their plans.I met an old guy, Just Axe, who had flipped at Delaware Water Gap. I asked him a question about stealth camping in an area he’d walked about 5 miles ago. He said, once it’s behind him he forgets about it. I told him we should be friends. It warmed up enough for me to walk in shorts and a t shirt. On the way up to Lone Mountain I caught Giggles and Lady Viking. They were in and out so early to watch sunrise on the ridge.

They said they saw a huge bull moose right before coming into camp last night.I got on trail right at 7 with Rocket and Rooster. I soon lost them and was making decent time. The climbs were not tough, just long. I went over 4 mountain tops. Two were just under 4K feet and the other two just over 4K feet. My legs were doing alright but I was just a little shy on food. I had coffee, Carnation Breakfast Essential, and a Snickers for breakfast. For the rest of the day I had 3 tuna packs and another Snickers. I finished with a tuna pack left.The hostel owner joked, no one ever comes in with a Snickers left. There were a couple of views today but they were just off trail and I did not take the extra steps. At one point I was walking downhill and the rocks were like railroad rocks mixed with bigger rocks. I was thinking, were these put here or were they natural? Of course they are....then I slipped and started falling forward. Funny how sometimes you fall and it’s like bam you are on the ground before you know it. This fall happened fast but in slow motion. It was on a pretty steep downhill, I slipped then fell forward. I was Supermaning through the air falling to my right/or the right side of the trail. My face was headed for a 3 inch diameter pine. Now, along the trail the smaller pines have dead branches near the bottom because of lack of light. Then those dead branches get broken off and are like spikes sticking out from the tree. I was able to get my left hand up, grab the tree where there were no spikes. I turned my head and avoided hitting my shoulder on the tree. My right knee hit something on the way down. I took a minute to get up. I started walking again brushing myself off. No injuries, how I don’t know. I made it to the last peak at noon. I had just over 5 miles to get to the road.

That will put me 9 miles from Monson, my next hostel stay. I hiked slow today not pushing at all. It had warmed up enough to start the day hiking in shorts.

I was on trail at 653. It was the warmest its been in weeks last night. I started out wearing shorts and a t-shirt. I was sweating before 730, but not complaining. The first couple of miles were along a creek/river and the sun was early on the rise. The leaves have turned a lighter green or yellow. The walk was pleasant with the sound of the stream. It got more hot as the morning wore on, and I was dripping sweat at times, again not complaining. I saw several toads, frogs, and a couple of snakes on trail. I made it to the parking lot/road crossing by 1100 and to the hostel by 1130. 
I showered and went to get my haircut. The barber was closed for the season!?! WHAT?!? Oh well, I went and had lunch at a pub. I sat out back on a deck with a lake and a mountain view. There was a bald eagle circling and swooping. I then stopped at the ATC welcome center to get information on summiting Katahdin. The lady was super helpful but a little over the top thorough. I then stopped at the general store and bought some beer. 
The hostel does a midway drop in the 100 mile wilderness so I signed up. I then did the math and decided against it. I’d get breakfast in the morning and hike for 4.5 days to the next hostel. I could carry 4.5 days of food. Many hikers I knew arrived and many departed. Mr. President arrived and we walked to get pizza and beer together. Upon returning I did my laundry and re-checked my itinerary. Nine more days?.
The vibe on trail is different. Everyone is excited about summiting, and a lot of the talk is about when and the logistics around the actual date. There is some apprehension and sadness in the air because the journey is coming to an end. I heard a girl was in crutches yesterday-trip over for her. The 70 mile a day guy I met doing 33.33 miles a day, I heard got sick in the 100 mile wilderness and didn’t finish. Giggles, who I met a few days ago was at the hospital, Giardia. I’d hate to catch that now. So close and things can still go wrong. 
The trail provides, I occasionally get a knot in my shoulder blade on the left side. If it get bad enough it can take my breath away with pain. It started late Friday and got a little worse yesterday. I stretched and took some Advil. At the hostel they had a “massage” area. It consisted of a shelf of massage tools. One tool was a shepard's hook. I went to town on my shoulder and it felt better as the day went on.","Horseshoe Canyon

I stopped several times and enjoyed the silence. There were many bogs, swamps, ponds, streams and waterfalls today. At one point I had to ford a river. I removed my shoes and socks. I put my camp shoes on, Crocs. There was an overhead rope run across so I used that to steady myself. About 2/3 across I slipped and I hung on to the rope. There was a lot of play in the rope and my butt and bottom of my bag dipped in the water. I made it across and then I soaked my feet for a bit longer. As I was getting near the shelter I realized today must have been a test. We walked over almost every type of terrain we’ve seen on the trail. I made it to the shelter after 530 pm, long day. I set up in the shelter because there may be rain. While chilling out after dinner I saw a huge spider, not as big as that one a couple months ago but big. A guy named Bulldog helped me kill it. The other hikers lit a fire, and I went to bed.","Shaw’s Lodging

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623507,"I slept just alright in the shelter. My alarm went off at 545. There were four others in the shelter so I tried to be quiet getting ready. It was warm last night and I slept in just my shorts. I hit the trail before 700. It was very humid today, you could almost feel the impending rain.
I saw a snake and a toad within the first 5 minutes. Later I saw a woodpecker, chipmunk, and a frog. I was only doing 9 today because I have a hostel reservation on Thursday and I had to space out my miles. It was not tough but, it was not an easy 10 miles. I took my time and took some longer breaks. I made it to the shelter at about 230, which is usually too early to stop for the day but I did. I used the privy and then went and got water. 
I claimed a spot in the shelter and I cleaned myself with wet wipes. I then made 1st dinner, I’ll have 2nd dinner a little later. Another couple hiking the 100 mile wilderness arrived and set up their tent. I ended up sharing the shelter with Balto, Mountain Laurel, and two others.","Long Pond Stream

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623509,"It start pouring really hard at about 1100pm and continued for about 2 hours. It then rained all night and into the morning. I was awake at 545 and it was raining. I made my coffee and oatmeal as quiet as I could. Balto’s alarm went off at 530. I noticed Mr. President was moving in his hammock, he left just after 630. It started raining harder and I geared up. When it’s raining you are going to get wet, so you might as well get the miles in. The trail was a river in some places. The trail was slick; the rocks, mud, and roots were all slick. I was plugging along and my back started to spasm. I stopped breathed and stretched which seemed to make it go away. On the first downhill it turned into a rock scramble. I somehow got off trail and I had to use the Guthooks App to get back on trail. Guthooks, in map mode, has a little arrow pointing the direction you are going. I kept walking in the direction of the trail. I had to bushwhack uphill. When I got back on trail I was at the top of the rock scramble.  A little later I slipped on a rock with my right foot and my left knee slammed into a rock I was then laying on the cold wet muddy ground. I took my time getting up and my knee really hurt. I rubbed it for a while and tried “walking it off.” It took quite a while before I stopped limping.I got to a river crossing I knew I was going to have to ford. My shoes and sock were already wet so I just waded across. Mr. President was on the other side. We walked together for a while then I got ahead. There were three mountains we had to go over. I actually found them very easy. I made it to the shelter and got into dry clothes.I got water and started to make something warm to eat. I had chocolate Carnation and oatmeal as I curled up in my sleeping bag to get warm. My toes did not want yo warm up. I then made a double Ramen with a tuna pack. I held the cup/pot between my feet to warm my toes. I finally warmed up. I’m wearing dry socks, dry pants, an Under Armor long sleeve, a cotton long sleeve and a stocking cap. I also put my sleeping bag liner in my bag. There are 4 others in the shelter. Two of them are talking about doing 35 miles tomorrow. I have an 11 mile day planned, which my become a 15 so I can get to the hostel earlier on Thursday.","Chairback Gap Lean-to

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623596,"It pretty much rained all night, and when it wasn’t raining the water was falling from the trees onto the shelter. The shelter roof is corrugated material so it was really loud. The couple planning on the 35 mile day was up and out early. I don’t know how early but before 530. I was on trail by 715. My left knee was stiff from the fall. It took about an hour to loosen up. The trail was uneventful and flat today. The scenery was nice and I walked past several lakes and streams. The trail profile flattened out and so did the trail itself. There were less roots and rocks and you could actually get a stride going. I made the 15 miles in just over 7 hours.I found a nice stealth spot next to a stream that had a fire ring. I hung a clothesline and gathered wood to start a fire. Once I got the fire going I finished setting up and I put my shoes, insoles and socks near the fire to dry them. Mr. President rolled in about an hour later. I waited until about 530 to start my dinner, 2 Ramen with a packet of tuna. I sat by the fire for a long time, and enjoyed a hot chocolate.

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623597,"Since we were so close to water, camped next to a stream. I drank 3+ liters of water last evening. That means I had to use the bathroom 2-3 times during the night ?. Nothing like unzipping the sleeping bag, two tent zippers, putting on a jacket and Crocs to use the bathroom.I woke to the sound of a woman talking. It was Rocket talking to Mr. President. She, Rooster, Executioner, Sherpa and his dog Blue were already on trail and had done almost 4 miles. They are going to do just shy of 30 miles today. The terrain is suitable but, no thanks, not with 5 days of hiking left. I’ll stick to my 15 miles max. I was on trail by 730. My knee was not stiff or sore today. I was moving along good but not pushing it because I knew it was only 10 miles and I could call for a ride when I got there. The trail was beautiful today, not much profile and pretty flat terrain. I saw a sign saying view of Mt. Katahdin. I walked to the lake shore and looked left. My jaw dropped and I was star struck. Mt. Katahdin was off in the distance. I could have sat there all day and stared at her, she’s a beautiful mountain.I had been pushing hard but after seeing Mt. Katahdin I slowed down and was just taking the trail in. I received a text from Mr. President saying our boat ride to the hostel was waiting. I was still .2 miles away. As I approached the dock the family dog, a black lab, ran out and greeted me. We got in the boat and this lab jumped up in my lap, all 90 lbs, and made himself comfortable. He rode the whole way back to the hostel on my lap. I even got some kisses. I later learned he’s never done that before?. The hostel consists of several buildings, one being the bunkhouse. There is no electricity and no heat in the cabins or bunkhouse. Lighting is done by propane and lanterns. I showered and did some laundry. Laundry is a wash tub and wash board. Dinner was served at 5 pm. Dinner consisted of a burger or pizza. I opted for both. I devoured the burger and I ate half the pizza. I will pack the other half out tomorrow.","Stealth mile 2135.9/Jo-Mary Rd

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623652,"Everyone, all 8 of us in the bunkhouse, woke at about the same time because breakfast was at 715. I had a good night’s sleep. I woke up once to go to the bathroom, outside. I looked up and the sky was so clear and the stars were amazing. I went back inside and got my jacket, pants and stocking cap on. I walked down to the lake and just looked at the stars and Milky Way for about 15 minutes.Breakfast consisted of 4 pieces of bacon, the equivalent of two eggs scrambled, an english muffin, and all of the blueberry pancakes you could eat. After breakfast I went down and checked out the Moose the owner's son had shot. I’m not a big hunter and I really don’t get shooting a majestic animal like that but, they do limit the number of permits and they do here and  what they shoot. We then got a boat ride back to the trail. I was in no hurry today even though we got a later start and we had 15 miles to do. The trail was beautiful today and passed many lakes. At one point there was a sign for a view. I checked Guthooks and Guthooks said the view was magnificent of Katahdin. I had to walk 200 feet off trail to see it but it was a magnificent view. We made it to a beautiful shelter area and I set up my tent tonight. There were approximately 15 other hikers around the shelter. All of the hikers here are cool. Several of us gathered and had dinner together. I had a Knorr pasta side with the toppings of my 2 left over pieces of pizza. I over watered it down because I was going to put Ramen in it too. I ate the pasta without the Ramen. I then took the left over juice and cooked the Ramen in it. That was really good.","Mahar Tote Tr.-White House Landing

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623654,"We were up and out early. Last night I kept hearing crumpling like someone in a potato chip bag. I must confess I rarely hang my bear bag anymore. I keep my food bag in my tent, and I keep my garbage bag just outside my tent. I kept shining my light at my garbage bag looking for vermin. I never saw any. It’s had to tell where sound in coming from directionally, and more and more hikers kept coming into camp and setting up after I had zipped up my tent. In the morning Buster asked if I had heard all the noise. I thought it had been him. He thought it was chipmunks. We got on trail early and made good time as the profile was flat. The trail was beautiful again today with streams, lakes, and bogs. We rolled into Abol Bridge Campground a little earlier than expected. There were about 15 hikers hanging out in front of the camp store. I saw many hikers I knew and the atmosphere was electric. I went inside and got my campsite for the night which included a shower and breakfast. I then got dinner and snacks for the night, and beer. We chilled outside the store and reminisced with the other hikers. We got set up and cooked dinner. I chipped in for some firewood and another site had a fire. I ate my dinner there and we played a version of imporv where each person says a word after the other in a circle, making a sentence. We are approximately 10 miles from the base of Katahdin and you can see it from the campground. It’s kind of surreal being this close to the end.

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623669,"Today is a day of last. The last page of my AWOL guide. The last time I have to wake up knowing it not going to get any warmer unless I’m moving. The last time I have to put on cold damp clothes, especially shoes and socks. The last time I have to pack up my tent and everything. Today we had about 10 miles to walk to the Birches. The walk through the first 10 miles of Baxter State Park was beautiful. We followed a river for the first half. There were rapids and waterfalls. There were two falls called little and big Niagara. There were also several views of Katahdin.  We got to the Katahdin Stream Campground Ranger Station early, 1 pm. I had hiked in two beers, so we had a beer while waiting for the  Rangers to return. It turned out to be a beautiful day. We saw the hiker named Ranger, he had just returned from his summit and he said it was beautiful. While waiting for the shuttle several other hikers came down from their summit, and several others arrived to register for theirs. There were about 20 hikers sitting around by a picnic shelter reminiscing and forecasting. We ended up Yogi’ing a ride to Milllinocket for free!!!  The shuttle driver also set us up with a great hostel. We then explored restaurants. Nothing was open on a Sunday. We went to a bar and their kitchen was closed but, you could order from a pizza place and have it delivered. We did, it took almost 2 hours. I stayed and watched the Bears beat the Vikings, YES! At the bar several hikers who had summited today arrived and we celebrated with them.","Abol Bridge Campground

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623670,"I slept through the night in the hostel. I had an air conditioning unit in my room and I turned on the fan, not the air. The combination of the white noise and the cool outside air knocked me out. We did breakfast at the AT Cafe. They allow hikers who have finished the AT to sign a ceiling tile. When the tile is full they put it in the ceiling. After breakfast I checked out of the hostel and walked the 1.5 miles to the Katahdin Inn & Suites. On they way I tried to get my hair cut at 3 different places. They were all closed. At the hotel I called another Salon and walked 1/2 mile to them and got my hair cut. Back at the hotel I saw four hikers headed home. We sat and had a beer in the lobby before the arrival of their shuttle. Seaneen arrived a couple of hours later. It was so nice to see her. I have not seen her for 6 weeks, the longest we’ve ever been apart. We freshened up and met Mr. President for dinner.  There were several other hikers there and we listened to their summit stories. It was then off to bed as we had to get up at 445 to get to the park by 6am to start our summit attempt.","100 Mile Wilderness Inn

"Casual1 ""The Hiking VIKING""",https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623722,"We woke up at 445 in the hotel and got ready. McDonalds opened at 5 so we stopped and got some coffee. We picked Mr. President up at 530. The drive to Baxter State Park was 25 minutes and once in the park it’s another 25 minutes to the parking lot. We arrived at the park boundary ay 6, right as the gates opened. We were third in line. At the trailhead parking lot the day was starting to get illuminated. We were taking some pictures with Katahdin in the background. A few hikers walked by. One was Fastball. I hadn’t seen him in a month. I weighed my pack at the Ranger station. Eighteen pounds, I am normally carrying 30-35 lbs. It is normal to empty everything out of your pack you don’t need, or the leave your pack at the Ranger station and borrow a day pack. I wanted to summit with my pack on, just lighter. We were on trail at 645. The first mile was a re-route because a bridge had washed out. It was new trail so it was nice and relatively flat. A mile in is the last privy on the trail. I stopped to use it and I could hear Mr. President chatting with someone. When I got out of the privy I found him talking to Gossip Girl, I had not seen her since the Shenandoahs. The hike from the parking lot to the summit is only 5.2 miles but it’s 4171 feet at 15% grade. At mile 2 we started going up. At mile 3 it really started going up. We were climbing boulders and we entered the clouds. We knew the weather was not going to be great but we were hoping the rain would hold off. Mile 4 was more climbing a times it seemed straight up. You could see ahead but not very far. We just kept going up. Finally the trail kind of leveled off. It was now misting, we were above tree line, and the wind was blowing 20+, if not 30+ at times. At the mile to go marker we saw Gossip Girl coming back down. She said the last mile was long and it was very cold. I was thinking, can it get much colder? At this point on trail there are several options for your decent. We had decided our decent would be the Abol trail, so we had t0 backtrack to this point after we summited. We continued on. The last mile wasn’t particularly rough but it did go up, and the mile did seem long. We arrived at the summit and the sign appeared out of the fog. I immediately went and touched the sign. A feeling of relief, knowing the hike was done, came over me. That was quickly quelled as it was so cold and windy and we had summit pictures to take. Mr. President had difficulty getting his phone out because he was so cold. There were two other hikers up there that took a picture of the three of us. Mr. President and I then took turns getting the full compliment of pictures we wanted. I took several different poses including one with my shirt off. It took me a long time to get re-dressed because it was so cold. We started our decent and had the retrace the AT for a mile to get back to the Abol trail. Once on the Abol trail it was another 3 miles down. The Abol trail is shorter going down but more steep as you have to descend the same 4171 feet but, in less distance. The Abol trail is blue blazed. It is weird following blue blazes for that long after following white blazes for so long. Mr. President volunteered to walk ahead and get the car. The car was another 2+ miles from the bottom of the Abol trailhead. Seaneen and I took our time getting down. The decent was a boulder scramble with small loose rocks mixed it. It was a slow go. Seaneen was done and she was hurting. We finally got under the clouds and the trail finally leveled out a little. When we got to the Abol trailhead Mr. President was there with the car. We had a celebratory beer and then left the park. We stopped at the first bar and warmed up a little, and had a drink. We all decided we were starving so we left there and went to dinner. Dinner was really good, or we were just really hungry. I was still chilled and tired. At the hotel I took a HOT shower and went right to bed before 8 pm.Thank you to everyone for following along.  Your love and support was a big part of my being able to complete this incredible journey.PLEASE check back in the future as I may have some closing thoughts I will share here.","Katahdin Steam Campground
