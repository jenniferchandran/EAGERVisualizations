Legacy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608129,"I'm not a deep thinker. Some might say I'm not much of a thinker. But I am aware of the enormity of the task of hiking the Appalachian Trail, and I knew that I needed some deeper understanding of its transformative power to keep in mind while hiking it to keep myself centered.My trail name, therefore, will be Legacy. A legacy is a gift, action or guidance handed down, inherited or received from a predecessor. The trail name is in memory of my father, and is also in honor of my wife and three daughters. My father, hardworking and intelligent, emphasized the importance of living a life full of quality, of ""marching to a different drummer"", as exemplified by running 43 marathons beginning at age 59. For my wife, Cynthia, and children, Kelsey, Bonnie and Audrey, I hope to have modeled for them a life well-lived, a life full of work and of worth. My life actions and love for them is my legacy to them.The starting date for my thru-hike, March 6, has special significance in this regard as well, in three ways. It is the date of my daughter Bonnie's birthday. It is also the date of the second anniversary of my father's death at age 97. And it is Ash Wednesday. I will be keeping these thoughts in my head and in my heart to help keep me on the trail.",,View Entry,"Mar 15, Fri",0
Legacy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608132,"There are certain people I need to thank for their guidance and support for helping get me on the AT.

My A-Team includes my wife, Cynthia, who will be at Command Central and holding down the fort while I am away,  handling communications, questions and especially maildrops. She has been incredibly supportive of my efforts. They say the AT changes a person. (She can only hope so!) My daughters, knowing the eccentricities of their father, and who also are a source of inspiration for him, support him as well. My neighbors, Jim and Marcia, have helped - Jim with his interest in my well-being and with his technological skills for downloading Guthook and pdfs, and Marcia with her encouragement (""you're crazy!"")

I would be like a babe lost in the woods (literally) if it were not for what I call my A.T. Team, AT hikers, three from Rochester, NY, who have generously shared their time and knowledge with me. Brightside (NOBO, 2017) inspired me with her blog, answered my questions, and provided the blueprint for much of my gear by posting her own gear list. I attended two of Dori's presentations to learn about her SOBO thru-hike. Opa wrote a daily blog of his 2018 hike to give me a better sense of the day-to-day existence on the AT, and had lunch with me to answer my questions. I met Pokey, from CT, on my Northville Placid Trail thru-hike in the Adirondacks last August, a chance encounter that has been incredibly important to me. Pokey has been very patient with me, providing detailed answers and pictures to my many questions over months. The Genesee chapter of the Adirondack Mountain Club (ADK) has had monthly speakers who have expanded my knowledge of hiking in general and the AT in particular.

One does not hike the AT alone. I would not be hiking at all without my A-Team and my A.T. Team.",,View Entry,"Mar 15, Fri",0
Legacy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608135,"After a 25 hour Amtrak train ride from Rochester, NY to Gainesville, GA, and a shuttle ride, I arrived ""fresh"" at Amicolola State Park on March 6 for the 8.8 mile approach trail just to get to Springer Mountain. I registered as a thru-hiker, AT 601. Some school kids were on the trail, one with a shirt that said ""All Legacy"", which I took as a good omen. At the summit, I paused for pictures at the famous ""AT plaque"", where I met Popps, and we headed to Springer Mountain Shelter for the night, at AT mile marker 0.2. The temperature dipped to 22 degrees that night, the coldest I have experienced on the trail so far, but except for some cold feet, I was warm that night.
The following morning, Popps and I set out, with Jerry later joining us, as we made our way to Hawk Mtn campsite, where we made our dinners on top of a bear box.
The next night, Sped, a thru-hiker I met on the train ride down, tented next to me, which was reassuring as we had an all-night drenching and let me know of the type of weather adversity to be faced on the trail. Sped is a good hiker with a positive attitude, which kept me centered early on.
A couple nights later Westy and Tabasco joined us at a campste. Westy in particular is a character, at 71 doing his second AT after thru-hiking three years earlier. (Westy: ""Tabasco thinks he's hot stuff!"") We went to do a group bear hang, Westy choosing a tree. Tabasco threw the line over a branch, then gave a tug to test the limb. The branch came crashing down, narrowly missing Tabasco. ""Well"", said Westy nonchalantly, ""let's try this tree over here.""
Sped and Highlander hike faster and further than me, so I let them go, but Westy, Tabasco and I ended up at Top of Georgia, a great hostel at Dick's Creek Gap. When I asked Westy how large his ultralight pack was, he said 80 liters, and we laughed, thinking that 80 liters of anything is no longer ultralight. Still, his base weight of 18 pounds is two pounds lighter than mine.
Westy is a memorable guy, and one of the most gracious things he did was let me copy his itinerary. This has been a real blessing to me, because it put each day's trek in ""Doug-miles"" rather than in ""superhiker miles"" that would do me more harm than good, as well as suggesting hostel stops and maildrops.
Self-assessment: my feet are definitely tired by the end of the day. Still, I have gone through some drenching rain and cold nights. The trail is beautiful, surrounded by trees, streams, mountains and sweeping vistas. The trail is work, but easier than the High Peaks in the Adirondacks: less rigor than the peaks, fewer muddy trails, and switchbacks that make the climbs more gradual. With weather that overall has been favorable, I am doing better than expected. ","Amicolola State Park

Legacy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608794,"Enquiring minds want to know: ""Legacy, what is the stinkiest article of clothing after a week on the trail?"" Now, I don't want to air my dirty laundry, mind you. We have had variable weather (cold, rain, sun), but we have not had those summertime temperatures that create the potent stench that hiker trash is known for. Nonetheless, one piece of clothing elicits more ""pews"" than you see in church on Easter Sunday. My underwear, which at home smells like a bed of roses - even after being worn - stinks, both the day hiking pair and the gently used nighttime pair. If my underwear had legs, it would run away. What is it about hiking that would create such a stench? It's not like I ran out of toilet paper halfway through at the privy! Apparently, my exhaust is worse than a '53 Chevy that needs a tune-up. On the positive side, it has proven to be an effective bear repellent, since I haven't encountered any bears so far. Sped, a biologist, is a proponent of Lysol spray (""kills norovirus, which hand sanitizer will not""). What am I to do? Spray Lysol on my butt (or butt-ocks, as Forrest Gump would say)? Stick some Glade air freshener in my underwear?
That reminds me that the Petrasky's, the polite side of the family, would refer to having gas as ""breaking wind"". Hell, growing up, us Brown's did not break wind, we farted, oftentimes loudly, and with five other brothers and sisters, sometimes in competition. My mother wasn't known as The Bomber for nothing!
Hiker stench has stymied climate scientists for generations, trying to find a solution to its bad odor. I don't have a solution, just a word of warning: don't stand downwind of me!","
",Dick's Creek Gap,"Mar 25, Mon",0
Legacy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608808,"On the first day after a zero at Top of Georgia hostel, I crossed the GA/NC state line, the first noteworthy sign of progress on the AT. That same day I passed the most photographed tree along the AT, at Bly Gap.  Two days later, I passed the 100 mile mark at Albert Mtn, which had sweeping vistas, and concluded the day by hiking with Conductor (two-time thru-hiker, MI) and Pilgrim (fellow Camino hiker, FL).
I met up with Westy again at a hostel in Franklin,  NC. With pain in both hips, Westy has reluctantly decided to leave the trail. He has been both an excellent mentor and friend to me on the trail, so I was especially sorry to hear his news. In his honor, I relate one final Westy story. On his initial thru-hike, Westy fell and broke his tailbone. In pain, he called his doctor for advice. The counsel from his caring physician: ""suck it up "". Westy did, and successfully completed his thru-hike. 
Franklin, NC, tries to be an exemplary trail town, as represented by the First Baptist Church providing hikers with a pancake breakfast. The associate pastor noted a Bible passage about Jesus assisting hikers in particular - those that are ""heavy laden"", which certainly describes us. 
Franklin, NC, also was a chance for me to reflect, because my father was born and raised in Franklin, but in Franklin, PA, not NC. This trip, like all my hikes, is a pilgrimage, and I try to keep things in perspective. 
They say it takes 5 million steps to hike the AT. (For me, with my smaller stride, especially going downhill, it may be closer to 7.5 million). Because I am slower than most, during the day I often hike alone, joining others when I get to that day's shelter. During the day, I will watch my path, look at the mountainous surroundings and think freely. Although I do not pray much at home, on the trail I find myself numerous times each day repeating the Lord's prayer or singing the first verses to a half dozen hymns I memorized before leaving for the trail. 
Many hikers, like me, wear Dirty Girl gaiters, which add a ""pop"" of color above your shoes. One guy said that we all carry the same gear, but we all have different gaiters. It reminded me of a quote from a movie: ""the only thing that separates us from the primates is our ability to accessorize!""
Trail magic has included burgers twice, beer and veggies, all welcome! I am trying some Superfeet insoles to address soreness in my right foot with limited success. I am spending three nights at the excellent Cabin in the Woods, with one slackpack day and one zero. 
Interesting but faster hikers that have passed me include Too Late, Denali (MI), Hiex (NM), the band Mailboxes (aka the Purples), Scoutmaster (PA) and Beth and Doug, baker and brewer from Vermont whose common bond must be yeast. 
Self-assessment: I am going at the right pace for me, graduating from 8 mi/day to a current 11-12mi/day. I am pleased with how I am handling the adversity that is inherent in a hike of this nature, including ice on my tent one morning. Besides the hours of hiking and tired feet, there is the daily setup (tent, sleeping pad, filter water, cook dinner, hang bear bag, etc) and packing up (tent and sleeping bag, eat, water, privy, etc). There are mental letdowns with chores to be done, and periods of loneliness because the set of hikers at each shelter is so fluid at this point. Calls home to my wife have been uplifting and supportive. 
Still, there are the stunning views each day: the layers of mountains in the distance, each layer dimmer and more indistinct, stretching out into the horizon as if it goes on indefinitely, a world that pictures cannot capture. That must be one reason to hike the AT. ","
",Fontana Dam,"Mar 25, Mon",97.10
Legacy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609445,"The AT has a lot of ups and downs. (""Pretty funny there, Legacy."") There are the usual ones involving life, there are the ones due to carrying everything you need on your back, and there are the mountains on the AT, and you get to navigate them all. After I left Fontana Dam, I entered the Great Smokey Mountains National Park, and my mileage varied as I moved through some difficult terrain.
One day was particularly difficult. In 2011, I had surgery due to prostate cancer. Usually that presents no problems...except...when...I backpack. The pack's hipbelt presses where I normally don't have pressure, and when I tire, it causes leakage, and can hit suddenly and frequently. Not every day, but some days. It's not like I'm a dog marking every tree, but when it hits suddenly and I have the choice between marking a tree or my pants, I will choose the tree every time.
Anyway, it struck during one day that had many climbs as I tired. To ""stem the tide"", so to speak, I reduced my water intake on a warm day, which caused a headache, a painful one. By the end of the day, I was exhausted, dehydrated, had a painful headache, was too tired to socialize during dinner, and did not sleep much that night due to the headache. In the morning, I felt low, and went behind the shelter to cry several minutes (not my normal way of dealing with stress), big tears of self-pity. Well, later, when the Excedrin eased my headache and I was on the trail, things improved. That was probably the lowest point on the AT for me so far.
The hardships are balanced by glories. My mileage varies but has grown lately, and I am handling it better, even in the arduous terrain of the Smokies. The trails and mountains are beautiful in the mornings (hmmm...I don't appreciate them as much in the late afternoons), and there are numerous, fun stream crossings with gurgling water. My favorite day so far was hiking out of the Smokies in falling snow that seemed magical. On cold mornings, there can be shards of frost poking out of the ground which look like blades of grass chiseled from ice.
There are a steady stream of characters I have met on the trail: Zach and TBone, Snow Cream, Barefoot, Strikeout, Free, Firefly, Further and General Lee, and as my mileage increases, I see them more often. Occasionally, there is something that puzzles me that provides fodder for thought as I hike. One example was a weekend hiker in his 50-60's that said the year before he met a young woman on the AT and hiked for 5 months ""at their own pace"" (no word was said about what his wife thought about that), but then later complained about ""you f*ing thru-hikers"", a group he apparently was a member of just the previous year. Knowing that I live my life differently, and spend my money differently, than other people - which has allowed me the opportunity to hike the AT - I have always tried to be tolerant of other people, but the AT is making me see that I can do better.
After 3 1/2 weeks on the AT, I fell for the first time. This by itself is noteworthy, because as my daughter Kelsey can attest, I probably average one fall per High Peak in the Adirondacks when we hike. So what caused it? Was it the terrain on the trail, what sometimes is called ""rocks and roots"", or maybe the slippery...""whoops""...mud the last few days where a foot skis underneath you? No, it was at a rare section where the AT was next to a road. Some debris, a circular piece of wire, ensnared both my feet and I immediately tumbled. The danger lies not in the forests but in modern society's debris!
Some good news lies just ahead! They say that you get your trail legs at 300 miles on the AT. 300, mind you, not 301 or more. Well, I am in Hot Springs taking a zero today, and I am starting to feel like Joe Namath (""I can't wait until tomorrow, 'cause I get better lookin' every day."") I am at mile mark 275, and that means that in the next couple of days, a miracle is going to occur, and suddenly, very suddenly, I am going to get what you can't buy at REI: TRAIL LEGS! I sure hope they don't run out of them when they're handing them out and I'm next in line, because I need them a lot more than these young bucks!
Hot Springs also represents a milestone of a different sort. They say that 50% of thru-hikers never make it the 275 miles to Hot Springs, so that makes me feel good: I like being in the top half of the class. Of course, to be a true thru-hiker, you have to be in the top 20%, the percentage who actually make it to Katahdin. That tells me that 60% of the thru-hikers that make it to Hot Springs fail to finish - and there are a lot more than 275 miles to go. Still, we are to savor every day, because of the 5 million steps to complete the AT, any single misstep could knock you off the trail.
The AT is difficult, but continues to evolve, and each day is different. I continue to be blessed with good weather - I consider the weather to be good as long as it's not raining. My wife, at Command Central, continues to be a positive contributing factor as I make my way north on the AT. My thanks to all who have shared their thoughts in the guest book.","
",View Entry,"Apr 03, Wed",108.60
Legacy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609982,"I'm taking a zero today in Erwin, a bit sooner than my others. To date, I think I've taken one nero and four zeros.
Lately, trail magic has taken on more exotic fare. One evening, at a shelter no less, trail angel Bloodhound showed up with beer and ice cream on dry ice. My favorite, however, was one Sunday morning when I needed more energy and Quiet Paul was serving up freshly cooked scrambled eggs with fried potatoes that were outstanding.
My trail legs did no show up on schedule as hoped. I am generally a morning person, so I was concerned when I had low energy one morning...since I had already noticed low energy during afternoons that made for lethargic progress, and I had dark thoughts about my continued existence on the AT. A couple days of more moderate terrain gave me hope, as well as talking to Up And Over, someone closer to my age who seemed to be dealing - maybe more positively - with the same issues. With our slower pace, it takes us longer to reach the shelter, giving us less recovery time to prepare for the next day. I've noticed a reduction in the number of hikers from the ""retirement set"" the further north we progress.
My thought is that three things may increase my energy/enjoyment/hiking mileage in due course: (1) my legs and body will become better adjusted to the workload, (2) I am trying to increase my caloric intake (easier to do in trail towns than on the trail), and (3) the terrain is supposed to moderate in Virginia. I need all three at this point. (Slowing down is a possibility, but then has the consequence of me carrying more food, hence weight, as it takes more days to get to your next resupply location.)
Evenings, though short, have been better as the last week I have progressed to the same shelters as General Lee and his troops, and other hikers I have gotten to know. (I have wondered if General Lee will change his name to General Grant north of Virginia.)
The topics most discussed among thru-hikers are: food (what you ate, what you are eating and what you plan to eat in town), calories (as everyone is losing weight), and protein (peanut butter at the top of the list). Jazzhands found a packaged honey bun that packs 710 calories and that she believes saved her. As she told one hiker, ""Dude, if you're still buying Little Debbie's honey buns, you're doing it all wrong!"" General Lee is a strong hiker and relies on multiple meals frequently throughout the day and probably does it the best of anyone I've seen.
I have anxious concerns about outbreaks of norovirus on the AT near me, and am trying to take more vigilant action to avoid contact with it or individuals, short of wearing one of those sumo wrestler blow-up costumes on the trail.
The fluidity of hikers is becoming more natural as I meet more and more hikers, people such as Happy Dance, Raven, Swiss Miss (WI), Upstate (NY), Up And Over (CT) and Highland (CAN). I am continuing to move north.","
","Erwin, TN","Apr 09, Tue",69.30
Legacy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610881,"With the significant effort it takes to hike the AT, it is natural for there to be times when a nadir fills your hiking head. Leaving Erwin, I had three heavy days of 17, 17 and 16 miles, much of it uphill, and it wore on me physically and mentally. And that's when the trail magic occurred, not in the form of food, but in the form of fellow hikers and friends back home. Swiss Miss accompanied me for much of those three days, providing the boost I needed. Later, I hiked with Up & Over while he dealt with a swollen shin, sharing conversation at shelters in the evenings. Back home, Wendy and Larry, both of whom are friends, fellow parishioners and health care professionals that I have visited in the past, graciously replied to my emails about issues I was having on the trail. This support was crucial to improving my mindset, and I have done better since then.
Certain images are etched in my mind. Though I was dark in spirit, I enjoyed the climb down from Roan Mtn in driving winds and rain. I liked the memorial of seeing a tree in the woods dressed up in Christmas ornaments. Jones Falls and Laurel Forks Falls were both spectacular in their natural beauty. And I loved the wonderful sense of comunity when attending a Maundy Thursday service at a small church last night.
The weather, though drastically variable, is warming more consistently, and with it are sights of buds on the trees and bugs on the ground, and bright orange newts, insects and a black snake. At a hostel / tavern, we enjoyed a country western couple playing a banjo and fiddle. And you know you are in the South when you see a sign that says ""I love you like biscuits and gravy.""
Milestones reached include leaving North Carolina and Tennessee behind and entering Virginia. Since 25% of the AT is in VA, I'll be here awhile. I have hiked 470 miles to date. I set a new PR by hiking more days on this trip than I did when I hiked the Camino de Santiago three years ago with my amigo Rick.
New hikers I have met include McFly, Zig (PA), British chap Cocoa, Blacksmith with his dog Hank (ME), Eagle Eyes and Milky Way with their dog Baxter (FL), and Xavier (NH).","
","Damascus, VA","Apr 19, Fri",126.60
Legacy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611327,"""Don't send any winter gear home until you get to Virginia"", they told us at Amicalola State Park for the start of the AT. Maybe they need to amend it to ""until after Damascus, VA."" On Friday, I sent home my fleece and some merino wool gear. Then Saturday, I left Damascus, and had an all-afternoon drenching that soaked my rain gear and left me cold and wet. (I was warm and dry in my sleeping bag that night.) Then on Easter Sunday, I was greeted with...what? snow in the mountains?...that rained on me as temperatures warmed slightly. Concerns about hypothermia danced like sugarplums in my head...oops, wrong holiday image! That was on a 17 mile day with lots of rocky, uphill work where we were supposed to see the wild ponies from Grayson Highlands. Huh. I saw none. Apparently the neon sign announcing ""WILD PONIES! THIS WAY, LEGACY!"" was in the shop for repairs. However, on Monday I saw five ponies which were conveniently grazing near the AT. Thank you, you nice conveniently located wild ponies!
On Tuesday morning, I hiked for a while with Kevin, a strong young hiker from Syracuse - together, we were a couple of good ol' boys proudly representing Upstate New York on the AT, we were - when we met Mr. Appalachia! I knew it was him because he asked us ""who gave you permission to hike my trail?"" We answered real respectfully (1) because he was an older man and (2) he was packing a pistol on his hip. He was a nice guy, Mr. Appalachia, and we went happily on our way (1) because he told us of his trail magic by the road and (2) because he did not shoot us - I told you he was a nice guy.
I stayed Tuesday night at the Partnership Shelter, which is distinguished because (1) it has a shower and (2) you can order pizza to be delivered to the shelter. Wouldn't you know it? - the shower was turned off! Other bad news seemed imminent after some young hikers, fully informed of my desire to order pizza, showed un-AT-like behavior by ordering without me, but then another hiker from the retired set showed up and we ordered and ate together.
Today was a short but beautiful day so I could shower, do laundry, resupply and eat real food before heading out again tomorrow. Toward the end of the hike today, a train passed on nearby tracks, and it reminded me of my hike and bike trips on the Great Allegheny Passage with trains frequently going by - I love the sound of trains, especially at night.
My mileage has moderated with the terrain after a short talk with Lady Di one morning about having fun.
Milestones include going over 500 miles so far, making this my longest multi-day hike by exceeding the miles I hiked on the Camino de Santiago three years ago.","
","Atkins, VA","Apr 24, Wed",74.80
Legacy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612061,"The weather is turning decidedly warmer, but before doing so, it threw another cold, gusty, wet day at me. I packed up one morning in the rain and was wet and cold six miles later before I reached Chestnut Knob Shelter at the top of a mountain. A former fire warden cabin, it was unusual as a shelter because it was made of stone and enclosed on all four sides with a door entrance. I burst in and slammed the door against the wind and rain to find a half dozen hikers from the night before. It felt like a movie where people are trying to survive a winter storm at the top of a mountain, and don't know whether to brave the elements or slowly starve to death. I chose to head out again, at one point falling on a wet, slanted rock, and reached the next shelter by 430. So cold and wet that my fingers would not work, I put up my wet tent and immediately got into my dry sleeping bag for the night,  for the first time eating a few bars instead of cooking dinner. Nonetheless, the AT again favored me when the next day proved to be cool but dry.
I know I don't get enough calories on the trail, although I don't feel ravenous. However, given the opportunity, I can eat prodigious amounts of food. A recent exemplar was at an outpost that featured the ""Brushy Mountain burger"", a large enough hamburger by itself, but which then surpassed all expectations by adding a 3/4 inch thick slab of grilled bologna, and served with a knife and fork because it was too big to bite into. I completed the meal with fries, soda and a milkshake. My other notable gastronomic achievement was at a deli. I was hoping for a 12 inch sub, but they only served sandwiches, so I had one...accompanied by a half gallon of chocolate milk, which I finished in one sitting.
I need to be more careful in my planning on Guthooks. On three different days recently, I did not pay enough attention to ""off trail mileage"", adding an extra mile round trip in order to reach water, the deli/campsite, and a hostel. Some are necessary, some can be avoided, and others might not be worth the effort.
One night I set up my tent at a campsite along a ridge line, and realized it was the first time I had camped alone on the AT. I camped alone more often when I was on the Northville Placid Trail for two weeks last August, and here I've been on the AT for over 50 days!
At the deli, I paid for a campsite and shower. When I asked for a towel, the owner gave me one while looking me in the eye and saying ""make sure you return it"", dispelling any thought I may have about packing out a wet towel and giving the thoroughly worn out, seedy towel, complete with holes and rips in it, to my wife for her birthday. (Great! Now what I do I get her?!) On the plus side, the shower was wonderfully hot, but the mirror over the sink was only functional if you were six and a half feet tall. From my vantage point, the mirror only showed the paint peeling off the ceiling, though some may say that's a damn sight better than looking at my face!
In talking on the phone with a sister, I mentioned that with all the time I had to think, I should be a genius by now, but that I hadn't reached that mark. She said I must not be thinking about the right things. Apparently ""I'm tired...my feet are sore...are we there yet?..."" are not stepping stones to higher critical thinking skills. Guess I won't be a genius anytime soon!
Sometimes the southern dialect gives me pause. Growing up, a hocker was what someone spit out of their mouths. Occasionally, in one of these small towns, I will be asked ""are you a hocker?"" I have to remind myself not to cringe and say ""No! I am NOT a hocker!"", and instead put a smile on my face and respond ""Why, yes, I am a HIKER!"" The truth is, southerners have been notoriously polite and kind to the hikers passing through or visiting their town.
It is interesting how random connections can be made with other hikers. Three brothers, all in their 20's, are hiking and invited their retired father to join them (""because I have a higher limit on my credit cards"", he quipped), an altogether wholesome group of guys. They were raised in Franklin, PA, the very same small town that my father grew up in. When asked how they all arranged to hike the AT, they responded ""we all quit our jobs!"" In addition, I recently met First Grader, a retired first grade teacher my age from Grayling, MI, which is just miles from Heart Lake, where my father took the family for two weeks every August for what were the best vacations ever. Other hikers I have met include Ranger (Albany, NY) and Robocop.
Milestones reached include an 18 mile day (15 is more my style), and 1, 2 and 4 hour speed records to get to the outpost for the burger before they closed. I have crossed both the quarter way mark for the AT as well as the 600 mile mark.
Today is a zero day for me. Tomorrow I am renting a car to drive home for my daughter's graduation this weekend when she receives her D.P.T. degree, and I will not return to the trail for a week to allow sufficient time for my family to (1) recognize me, (2) recall my name, and (3) tire of my presence and beg me to return to the trail. I will not be including those days at home as part of my log. Today is day 57; my first day back on the trail will be counted as day 58. Maybe before I leave home to return to the trail, I should remind my family that, like Arnold Schwarzenegger, ""I'll be back!""","
","Pearisburg, VA","May 01, Wed",90.20
Legacy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613629,"Going home for my daughter's graduation was wonderful. The events and ceremony surrounding her receiving her D.P.T degree were outstanding, befitting the effort she has put in. I was at home for five days, spending time with my wife, three daughters and son-in-law, and enjoying the comforts of home that we all take for granted - such as water, showers, laundry, shelter, plentiful and varied food, privies (that flush!) - unless we are on the trail.
Which makes returning to the trail all the more difficult, where we choose hardship over comfort. Upon my return, however, I met an unexpected sight: Pilgrim, who started the same day I did and had been hiking with Conductor until Conductor, a two time thru-hiker, decided in late April that twice was enough. We decided to hike together.
After my first day back, I was sore from the waist down. My second day was an 18 miler on a hot and hilly day. I texted my wife, for the first time putting into words the thoughts in my head, that I was ""thinking about quitting."" She reminded me that there were still options I had not explored: decreasing or varying my mileage, and adding calories. (I'm still not sure if she was trying to help me, or if my returning would interfere with the gala parties she is planning in my absence.)
Sure enough, the next few days were different! It rained like hell the next two mornings, thoroughly drenching us! Still, it was more fun being with Pilgrim, proving that misery likes company. However, our anxiety increased when our feet got roughed up from three days of hiking in wet shoes and socks. Up to that point, my feet had been as ""soft and smooth as a baby's butt"" although the odor was somewhat different (but not necessarily better). Fortunately, I was still without any blisters, so I taped my heels and some toes with Leukotape P - better than moleskin!, better than duct tape! - and I've avoided any problems since.
Hikers talk of the ""Virginia Blues"", but on consecutive days we passed noteworthy sites. First there was the Audie Murphy Monument, honoring the most decorated soldier from WWII, which I found both moving and humbling. Next was Dragon's Tooth, a craggy, rocky monolith that underscored the importance of good dental care. This was immediately followed by a treacherous steep and rocky descent, probably the most dangerous section of the AT we have faced so far. McAfee Knob, the most photograhed spot on the AT, welcomed us on a cool, windy, but clear day.
There are times on the trail where you are faced with conditions made more difficult than they need be. Frustrated by days of rain and some trail conditions, Pilgrim coined a phrase that we started parroting to find humor in otherwise humorless situations: ""A little trail maintenance wouldn't hurt here!""
We have benefited from all kinds of trail magic over the weeks, but my favorite occurred a half mile from Daleville, where I am currently taking a zero. Five mothers, corralling ten toddlers, were doing trail magic there with homemade chocolate chip cookies and boxes of apple juice. (The mothers have been certified as ""good suburban moms"" because the apple juice they served was organic, meeting the very high standards thru-hikers require for their food: it must have calories and be at least as healthy as Little Debbie honey buns!) The kids all had smiles on their faces and trail dirt and mud everywhere else. You rock, Daleville moms!
Unfortunately, Daleville represents the end of my current hike with Pilgrim. He is 11 years younger and 11 years faster than I am, and so is now hiking ahead of me. Happy trails, Pilgrim. Somewhere, there is a hiking partner for me, at least according to something I saw: I wish a fish could hike, then I'd be faster than something. I am now looking for a fish on the AT.
Many hikers have recommended Little Debbie honey buns as a viable method to quickly increase calorie intake, and just recently I have begun to explore that route. I told Pilgrim that this presented a conundrum for me, however. A day after our 34th anniversary, I didn't know if I should tell my wife that I would be waking up with Little Debbie the next morning!
Mount Katahdin, the northern terminus of the AT, is located in Baxter State Park, Maine. One of the first articles of clothing I ever purchased from LL Bean was their down coat, their Baxter State parka. I am not sure if the name was an omen pre-ordaining good news for me: did the Baxter State parka signify that I would truly get to Baxter State Park and summit Katahdin?... Or that it would be a cold day in hell before that would ever happen, and I would need my parka?
In the last couple days I have seen a hiking couple, maybe in their 50's, the man wearing a kilt and the woman wearing leggings. I guess we all know who wears the pants in that family!
Milestones reached include passing the 700 mile mark and completing 1/3 of the AT.
Hikers I've met this week include a group of 6 twenty-somethings (with Spacejam (CT), Whitebread (CT), Grocer (NY), Orange (MN), Pippin (CO)), and Never Better, Cool Pops (GA) and Karma (PA).","

Legacy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614693,"The first few days out of Daleville were quieter than usual. Trail Days, the annual bash celebrating the AT, was taking place that weekend in Damascus, and many hikers left the trail to attend.
Fortunately, I moderated my mileage through this section, to 15 miles or less, because there were long uphills, hot days and fewer reliable water sources. One day I carried an extra 2.5 liters of water into a waterless shelter. That was the same day I had my third fall of the hike, as my left ankle buckled on the uneven surface. I felt my right knee start to twist, and fell rather than injure it.
Brushing my teeth one morning, I saw a deer picking its way through the foliage. A couple mornings later, I was again brushing my teeth when a sparrow landed on a branch 5 feet from me, softly mewing like a kitten as it jumped from branch to branch. This is convincing evidence that wildlife is attracted by minty, fresh breath. I've also seen snakes on the trail. The problem, then, is to have minty, fresh breath to attract deer and birds while having horrid breath at other times to repel snakes and bears.
I stopped overnight at a hostel in Glasgow for the essentials (shower, laundry, maildrop), and again experienced the kindness of trail towns, as the Episcopal church served a dinner to hikers that night. I usually don't find hikers watching TV at hostels, but later, they were searching for some deep intellectual fare, and found it in an Austin Powers movie.
There were a couple days that I found fun because occasional F15's flew just overhead from nearby Langley Air Force Base, emitting ear-splitting sounds as they burst past. It was comforting knowing that, for those two days at least, that the AT was safe from terrorists.
Notable sites I passed included the ""Guillotine"", two walls of rock with a boulder suspended overhead. Flowers have been bursting out everywhere, adding color to the trail. At one shelter, I found Max at work, a stone mason who during his hike has been artistically ""stonescaping"" some of the fire pits.
Arriving early Sunday morning in Waynesboro, I attended a service at the Presbyterian church. It was a beautiful large church with a magnificent organ up front, and it felt good to be there. Today I took a zero, and had lunch with Bruce, Cynthia's cousin. Bruce has completed the AT twice, the second time as a thru-hike in 1991.
Milestones included passing the 800 mile mark.
New hikers met included Granite (NH) and Chai (CAN). I camped with Wicked (MA), One Way (MS) and Fruitbasket one night, and a 50+ set (Red, Colonel, Sky Pilot and Sweetwater) another. I met Iris and Tracy numerous times. Iris (NC) assisted Dori from Rochester, NY, on her SOBO thru-hike.","

Legacy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615529,"Immediately after leaving Waynesboro, I entered Shenandoah National Park (SNP), which includes over 100 miles of the AT. Initially concerned about constraints within SNP, it instead became some of my favorite trail so far: the elevation changes were more moderate, two park campgrounds I stayed at had showers, laundry facilities and resupply, and it had waysides (restaurants) near the trail. Although allowed, there are not many campsites for stealth camping. Nonetheless, the first night I did so, carrying an extra 3 liters of water for 6 miles, because that allowed me to use shelters throughout the rest of the park at 13-15 mile intervals. My stealth camp wasn't stealthy enough, however, because a big black snake crossed the trail and infiltrated my camp. I defended my camp with honor and valor, and the snake eventually moved into the underbrush.
I caught a few evenings of rain after my tent was put up. There was also a shower while hiking one afternoon with Gator, the same day we passed the 900 mile mark. Finding those marks every hundred miles, made of sticks and stones by other hikers, has been fun and a cause for celebration along the trail, and something I look forward to.
Shenandoah is known for their dense bear population (meaning they have a lot of bears, not that the bears are stupid!) Leaving a campground one morning, I hadn't gone far on the trail when I saw my first bear, a cub. Maybe it was older, because I didn't see momma bear...or maybe she was in the bushes and too busy texting her BBF (Best Bear Friend) about how her cub is driving her crazy. I snapped a picture before the cub disappeared.
I caught a nice breakfast at the famed Skyland Restaurant, and the next day caught a hamburger and famed blackberry milkshake at Elkwallow Wayside. Unfortunately, both came with consequences, what I now refer to as town food, something that affects other hikers as well but ravages me. Trail food doesn't give me enough calories but keeps my system regular. Town food gives me a lot more calories - calories I need - but puts my system into overdrive. Each town food meal now seems to be associated with one or more trips to the bathroom, and it is particularly inconvenient if you are leaving town. At times you want to say in exasperation: ""that will be enough out of you!"" Leaving town now generally means that I am leaving with one sore arse. (You learn the most interesting things in trail journals, don't you?)
Small World Department: While hiking one day, a young man approached from the other direction wearing a Rochester Red Wings cap, the minor league baseball team back home. I stopped him and we chatted, finding out that he lives about four miles from my home, and that one of his neighbors, Kyle, is a favorite colleague of mine from my teaching days. Hundreds of miles from home, and we found this connection.
Time on the trail this week was spent reflecting on comments offered from Bruce about the commitment required to thru-hike, as well as words of encouragement from Wendy, my younger sister. My confidence seems to wax and wane rather than grow. I am reminded of words my father once told me: ""It is not enough to just know something. You must know you know it."" In other words, be confident in your knowledge. I am seeking that confidence.
Shenandoah has a unique feature: rather than signs telling you trail info, it has concrete posts with 1 inch metal bands with info stamped on them. It probably sounded like a good idea to the armchair bureaucrat who approved them, but if you forgot to bring your reading glasses to SNP, you're SOL ( s**t out of luck)!
Milestones included passing 900 miles, hiking the length of SNP, and seeing my first bear cub (along with numerous snakes).
New hikers met include Gator (FL), Supergirl (TX), a trio (Matt in a Hat, Onward, and Captain Insano) sponsored by Warrior Expeditions, spouses 5 o'clock and Fireball, Monk and Walden.
My thanks to those who have signed my guestbook. I find your comments encouraging.","

Legacy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616005,"Although only a few days have gone by, many noteworthy events have taken place since my last journal. While hiking a few days with Death March Dan (TN) and Show Me (MO), we went through the Roller Coasters. Given its name, you might have expected me to strap on my seat belt, throw my hands in the air and yell ""Whee!"" But, no, the Roller Coasters are 14 miles of tightly packed, steep climbs and descents. So my pace slowed, and the only sound from my mouth was ""Wheeze!""
Still, we stopped in the middle of the Rollers Coasters to celebrate another event, hitting the 1,000 mile mark. 1,000 miles!, representing three months of hard work on the AT. Woo hoo!
The next day presented another celebration, when after ""only"" 544 miles in Virginia, we exited that state and entered West Virginia, which means I have completed 4 (GA, NC, TN, VA) of the 14 states that comprise the AT. It's like they're falling like dominoes!
Today I am in Harpers Ferry, WV, what is traditionally thought of as the halfway point of the AT. However, because those merry makers at ATC have added miles to the AT over the years, the halfway point is actually two states away, in PA. Thank you, you fun-loving ATC folks!
The last two nights I tented at the Sam Moore and David Lesser shelters, which were correctly named in my opinion, as the first was ""Moore nice"" and the second was the ""Lesser"" of the two in terms of amenity placement.
I would think that the organizations most closely associated with the AT would be more aware of promoting it and catering to their target audience. So I scratch my head in wonder when I visit the ATC (Appalachian Trail Conservancy) headquarters in Harpers Ferry, and they have AT shirts, and AT hats, and AT mugs, and AT stickers...but no AT postcards, only postcards for Harpers Ferry. (Sad face.) Then there is the Bear's Den Hostel, run by PATC (Potomac AT Club), which is close to the AT and has a store with hiker snacks...but is closed from 9am-5pm, you know, during those hours when hikers would most likely stop in for a snack to fuel their hike.
I now have an entertainment option at the end of a long day of hiking. In Front Royal, I called my local library back home, and they helped me download an e-reader app onto my phone and a book. Now on any given night I can be joined by Jack Reacher, the good guy protagonist in Lee Child's books. So during the day I see the beauty of nature along the AT, while at night I read about the vigor with which Jack Reacher knocks heads together. I knew something was missing in my hike - now I have that elusive balance in my life!
Hiking into Harpers Ferry, the halfway point, made me reflect on the sequence of events that led me here: day hikes in the Adirondacks with my daughter Kelsey, hiking the Camino de Santiago with my amigo Rick, solo backpacking trips on the Great Allegheny Passage and C&O canal towpath, and thru-hiking the Northville Placid Trail in the Adirondacks where I met one of my AT mentors, Pokey. They were the building blocks that put me on the AT.","

Legacy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616720,"My neighbor Jim commented that my last journal entry was free of concerns about injury and fatigue. If so, that was purely an oversight and I apologize to my readers. My fans - yes, both of them! - demand tales of woe. Let's not disappoint them!
Death March Dan and I have endured periods of rain over the last four days, and apparently this pattern will continue for the next millenium. It made for slippery mud today, where I slid on my feet on a steep downhill, turning 180 degrees and facing backwards. Who said hiking wasn't an art form?
We are now in Pennsylvania, our seventh state, having left West Virginia and Maryland behind. En route we saw the Jefferson Rock and the original Washington Monument. We crossed the Mason Dixon line between Maryland and Pennsylvania.
We passed the true halfway point near Pine Grove Furnace State Park, where many hikers undertake the half gallon challenge, eating a half gallon of ice cream. Instead, I had a cheeseburger, soda and what I call the half quart challenge by eating a pint of ice cream. I wouldn't want anyone to think I was gluttonous, mind you!
""For no particular reason"", as Forrest Gump would say, a rear molar chipped one day. A bridge that attaches to it still does so, but I now need to find a dentist on those rare days when we may be in a trail town.
At those times when we need to find a motel to shower, wash clothes or dry out, selection can be limited. Our last motel provided an example. You know you're in an old motel when: (1) the major selling point on their sign advertises ""TV"" or (2) the bathroom has the original pink tile, pink tub, pink sink and pink toilet with matching seat!
Blue mentioned that he operates according to the Pirate Rule, which I found funny: you fall behind, you're left behind! Life can be tough on the AT.
Death March Dan told me of this quote from the movie ""Lawrence of Arabia"" which I find to be much more representative about life on the AT.: ""The trick, William Potter, is not minding that it hurts"". To be sure, there can be many discomforts, and you have to find a way to get beyond them.
Thanks to my high school friend John, who sent a funny and encouraging letter, and others who have been so supportive.
New hikers met include a retired trio, Nobro 1 and 2 (AL) and Moonwalk, and Stormchaser (WI).","

Legacy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617557,"If it's been awhile since I've written, it's because my life has been rocky lately. It all began with this phone call: ""Hello, this is Pennsylvania. For your hiking adventure, we have this deluxe package for you: rocks, rocks and rain, and rocks, rain and mud puddles. Enjoy your stay!"" Boy, they weren't kidding. My wife may disagree, but I've seen evidence that PA has more rocks on the trail than I have in my head! One hiker said that the terrain changes from ""more dirt than rock"" to ""more rock than dirt"".
This has presented some difficulties in various ways: (1) the rocks make footing treacherous, and we slow our pace as we carefully and painfully traverse them, (2) the rain kept the trail and our shoes wet, resulting in some blisters, and (3) the shelter spacing did not adjust for the terrain, resulting in some 12 hour days, about 3-4 more hours than I would prefer. So, I'm a bit tired currently.
We have had good moments. We have tasted Pennsylvania fare, birch beer for me (similar to root beer) and scrapple for Dan. Three trail magic opportunities were appreciated. When taking a nero in Pine Grove, I attended a welcoming Lutheran church service and Pastor Barry offered to shuttle us to the trailhead the following morning.
Yesterday we hiked over the Knife Edge, an aptly named section which rivaled VA's Dragon Tooth in terms of danger.
Death March Dan and I have been hiking together for three weeks now. He has ""Father of the Year"" written all over him. As an example, when his now-grown children were young, he would take them on family hikes which turned out to be too long and difficult, where they would scream ""this isn't a hike, this is a death march!"" Hence, the name.
Our compatibility as a team is enhanced because both our pace and IQ are similar. My cynical readers would guess that it took 1,000 miles to find someone with a negative IQ (like mine). But, au contraire!, Dan has a PhD, and is a former university professor and retired electrical engineer. So, to those cynics, I say ""Nyaah!"" (in a mature fashion, of course). Dan is a serious but positive guy. I try to be lighthearted but get worn out. I told him at the end of the day, Elton John's ""I'm Still Standing"" plays in my head, and sang one line from it. He claimed not to recognize it, even though I sounded exactly like Elton John. Maybe if I added sequins and rhinestones to my hiking attire it would help jog his memory.
Dan says he hopes to learn patience while on the trail. He certainly needs it - he waited a leisurely 10 days after retiring before beginning the AT. I am helping him learn patience. One day at a muddy location, I hopped on a log to chat with another hiker. Dan, who was behind me, shouted ""Get off the log! I'm standing in mud!"" Ah, me! As you can see, a lot of work remains to teach him patience! Fortunately for him, I unwittingly create such situations every day, so we will have daily assessments to guage his progress!
Milestones reached include passing 1,200 miles. New hikers met include Scout, Sharkchow, and Rope (who lived in Rochester for 3 years).","
