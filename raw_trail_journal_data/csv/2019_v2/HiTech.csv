HiTech,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606237,"So today I make it public.  It is my intention to thruhike the Appalachian Trail (aka the AT) from Springer Mountain in Georgia to Mount Katahdin in Maine.  The trail goes through 14 States, and has a total hiking distance of approximately 2,200 Miles (to my Canadian friends, that’s 3,540 Kilometers).  If you add up all the ascents during the entire trail it is the equivalent of climbing Mt. Everest 17 times, or at least that’s the rumor.

I am officially registered as thruhiker number T3326, and set to start this epic adventure on February 17th 2019 at the Amicalola Falls State Park Visitor Centre.  As strange as this may sound, starting from the visitor centre means that my first entire day of hiking representing 8.8 Miles and 2083 feet of ascent won’t even count towards my thruhike.  This is because the official Southern terminus of the AT is at the top of Springer Mountain and the Approach Trail is simply a means of getting there.  I will be camping at the top of Springer Mountain and taking my first step towards Maine on February 18th.  If everything goes as planned, I will finish this adventure in Maine some time before October 15th 2019.  This is a must because Baxter State Park which includes Mount Katahdin closes for the year on that date, and no hiking is permitted after it.

Now I am aware of the fact that starting in February means that I can count on hiking through snow at the higher elevations, and although I have done multiday hikes in the spring complete with some snow, I am planning to do a shakedown hike on a section of the Bruce Trail that I have hiked before.  So at some point during the first two weeks of January 2019 I will be heading out from Wiarton Ontario and hiking to Tobermory Ontario, a hike of 120 Miles (or 190 Km).  This hike is guaranteed to be a winter wonderland at this time of year, and will provide the closest analogy that I have available to the hiking conditions I will face on the AT in February.

So there you have it, let the fun begin.",,View Entry,"Jan 01, Tue",0
HiTech,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606238,"As I began to tell my friends and relatives of my intention to thruhike the Appalachian Trail, the most frequent response I got was “why would you want to do that”.  There were times when this question was even asked in a rather disapproving manner, and I would typically answer back with some flippant response like “Because it’s there” or “Why Not”.  The more often this happened however, the more I began to ask myself that very question.  Why would I choose to hike 2200 miles over extremely rugged terrain in a place that has none of the niceties of just staying home.  Surely NOT doing this crazy thing would be the more logical choice, wouldn’t it?

A few years ago, I met Reverend Nancy Ritchie who at the time was the minister of St. Mathew-Wesley United Church, and I had the opportunity to speak with her for a while.  She is one of the most caring and patient people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting.  As I was leaving St. Mathews she recommended a book to me entitled “The Presence Process: A Journey into Present Moment Awareness” by Michael Brown.  Unfortunately, life got in the way of my completing the journey that the author presents in this book, but I did get some value from having read the book and beginning that journey.  
One of the insights I gained from Michael Brown’s book is the realization that most of my life I have been doing things for other people.  I’m not complaining mind you, because I’ve had a very rewarding and happy life.  I met a wonderful girl with whom I recently celebrated 30 years of marriage, and we have a terrific daughter.  I’ve had a successful career in industrial automation, from which I have recently retired.  The truth is however, that throughout my entire career my efforts were all about creating something for somebody else.  That’s not to say that I wasn’t compensated for my efforts, but the prevailing motivation was to improve my customers industrial process.

In Michael Brown’s book, in the very first section of the journey, he says “This may very well be the first time you have done something real just for yourself”.  I might have the wording just a little off and he is referring to a journey into present moment awareness, however the message struck a chord with me.  Perhaps as I move into my retirement, and enter my 60’s, the time has come to do something real just for me.  
So here I am, on the cusp of starting the adventure of a lifetime, and I now have the answer to the question so many people have asked me.  I’m taking this journey just for me, and for no other reason.  To those who would like to join me, I welcome you to follow along on my adventure through my trail journal.  And by all means, feel free to leave a message for me if the moment seems right.",,View Entry,"Jan 02, Wed",0
HiTech,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606240,"I have been in the planning stage of my shakedown hike for the past few weeks, and to that end my lovely wife Anita and I have spent today preparing my food for the next 9 days.  As is almost always the case, I will be hiking alone with no support once I begin.  This means I must carry with me all the food and fuel I will need for the entire trip, or until my next resupply.  For the shakedown hike that means I will be starting out with 9 days of supplies.

I generally have three hot meals every day while hiking.  In the morning I get up and prepare Hot Oatmeal and Coffee. While I’m heating the water for my breakfast I also heat enough for my lunchtime soup, which I keep hot in a vacuum insulated Thermos.  It never ceases to amaze me that the soup is still steaming hot when I open the thermos up to 8 hours later.  There’s nothing more enjoyable than a nice hot soup after a morning of cold weather hiking.  Then once I set up camp for the night I prepare a hot meal, usually centered around another hot soup.

Tomorrow, I will do the final packing of my gear, and then Anita and I will drive to Wiarton.

HiTech,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606264,"This morning was spent completing the final gear selection and packing my backpack for my shakedown hike.  It is always a challenge striking the perfect balance between bringing enough clothes to adequately layer up and keep warm, and unnecessarily increasing your pack weight. My final backpack weight including 9 days of food, fuel and 3 Litres of water will be around 63 lbs. That’s almost exactly the starting weight of my pack the last time I did this section hike.  I was relieved to see that Georgian Bay is virtually ice free, which will make water collection and filtration an easier task. 
I am a little disappointed in the lack of snow here in Wiarton, as well as the predictions of little to no snow during the next 9 days.  After all, the whole point of this hike is to test out my gear selection in winter conditions. However,  behind every black cloud is a silver lining.  I removed the snowshoes from my pack and saved about 4 pounds. 
Anita and I are  now relaxing in our room at the Spirit Rock Outpost and enjoying a glass of wine before dinner at the Wiarton Inn.   Tomorrow morning we will have breakfast here at the outpost and we hope to be on the trail by the 8:00 AM sunrise.  Yes, you read that correctly, Anita will be hiking a bit of the trail with me in the morning before backtracking to the car and driving home.",,View Entry,"Jan 05, Sat",0
HiTech,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606317,"This mornings photo is of me standing in front of the Town of Wiarton’s Mascot “Wiarton Willie”.  Willie is a groundhog that is purported to be able to tell if we will have an early or late spring at the moment he exits his den every spring.  The town makes a really big deal of the event. I am fully equipped and provisioned to be on the trail for the next 9 days and the weather is good for the start.  Anita joined me for the first 4 1/2 Km and then she turned around, headed back to the car and ultimately drove back to our home. Now it’s just me alone with my thoughts, and the sounds of nature. As I was hiking the sky turned from fully overcast to just slightly cloudy providing a beautiful sun shining through the spruce trees and causing the snow on the ground to positively glow. It was mesmerizing. At about 16Km in I saw a large almost black animal hightailing it away from me. It was too fast to get a positive ID, but the only thing I’ve seen that big and dark is a moose. I’ve never seen a moose in this area, so this is just a guess. This has been an almost perfect hiking day, but I do mean almost. I have hiked 28Km through as rugged an area as we have here in Ontario without a scratch. But this was about to change. As I was walking across the nice, smooth , level, flat driveway right in front of the camp office I slipped on a patch of ice. I felt myself going so I instinctively turned my body to land on my pack. My pack provided a relatively soft landing compared to the frozen asphalt beneath it. Unfortunately, what I didn’t realize as I went down is that my right leg was bent under me. As I landed I heard the unmistakable sounds of breaking bone, and felt pain such as I haven’t felt before in my leg. After I mentally recovered I looked down and saw my foot pointing in one direction and my knee pointing in a totally different one. There was no question that my hike was over and that I needed help ASAP. Since the campground was still closed for the season, I dug out my cellphone and was delighted to have a reasonable connection and got through to 911 Emergency Services immediately.  Shortly, the local police showed up and after about 15 minutes the ambulance. So here I am lying in a hospital bed awaiting surgery on two broken bones in my right leg between the knee and the ankle.   They did set the bones and put on a half cast, but the doctors couldn’t get a satisfactory alignment because of the nature of the break and surgery is required. So at this time I have to assume that my thru hike is on hold until I an able to safely hike again. Talk about lousy timing, this is the first bone I have ever broken. To all who took an interest in my adventure I thank you. Your kind and encouraging words mean the world to me, and rest assured I will be back.",,View Entry,"Jan 06, Sun",0
HiTech,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606411,"I am home now having spent 3 days in hospitals and undergoing surgery on my leg, and although todays post isn’t going to be about hiking per-see, I felt I would be remiss if I didn’t tell the story of how my hike ended.  I hope the moderators at Trail Journals will accept that the story of how a hike ends prematurely is indeed part of the hiking story.

Although I have touched on what happened immediately after my fall in my last post, I feel there is so much more to tell about the experience, and more importantly about the total strangers who came to my aid.  Once I had made the phone call to 911, and had the ambulance on the way, I realized the clothes I was wearing for strenuous hiking would not be near warm enough for lying on the frozen ground with an air temperature of -3 Degrees Centigrade.  I decided to attempt to get my backpack rolled over and get access to my warm fleece jacket and my puffy down jacket.  I soon realized however, that any attempt to move my body sent excruciating pain through my leg, and there was no way I could get at my warmer clothes.  I was beginning to shiver uncontrollably, and as I was trying to decide whether this was the beginning of hypothermia or shock due to my leg injury, I happened to look over my shoulder and see a pair of headlights coming down the road directly toward me.  In my mind this added a new and more immediate danger to my situation, as I was lying well onto the road surface and it was already dusk, making it difficult to see me.  I started waving furiously to attract the drivers attention, and can you imagine my relief when a black SUV pulled up safely beside me having “Cape Croker Police” emblazoned on the door.  I would find out later that they were just out cruising the area looking for illegal hunters and came across me.  Kristopher and Rachel immediately removed their parkas and placed them carefully over me and then scrounged through the SUV and found more warm clothes to add to the pile.  I will be forever in their debt for that act of kindness.  
Once the Ambulance arrived the two attendants (I’m sorry I didn’t get their names), Kristopher and Rachel all worked together to get me onto the ambulance gurney and then into the ambulance where the heaters were blasting.  They were all so attentive to the pain I was in, and so very careful to minimize it.  When my attendant showed me a pair of scissors and asked how attached I was to my hiking pants, I realized that the real pain was about to begin, and then gave permission for my absolutely favorite pair of hiking pants to be cut off me.  After a couple of failed attempts at getting an IV line into one of my veins, it was decided to just give me pain medication in pill form, and shortly after that the pain finally started subsiding.

The trip to the Wiarton Hospital was wonderfully uneventful, and the hospital was completely ready for me upon my arrival.  Now for the record, I live in a big city and know about the horrid wait times that exist in the emergency departments of its hospitals.  The only delay I experienced in Wiarton was waiting less than 30 minutes for an x-ray technician to come back in from home to take the x-rays of my leg.  The doctor then immediately looked at the x-ray and went to work.  He re-set the bones as best he could and put a half-cast on.  He explained that he was unhappy with the result and recommend I stay the night in Wiarton and then be transferred to Owen Sound Hospital, where they have much better equipment and some very excellent orthopedic surgeons.  I immediately agreed, and I was put into a much more comfortable bed than the ER room.  Each and every staff member I came into contact with treated me like I was the most important person in the hospital, even though I can assure you I was not.  The next morning I was put into a Voyager Medical Transport vehicle and whisked off to Owen Sound Hospital, where once again they were complete ready for me and had me into a room immediately upon my arrival.  Now I have to mention the Voyager Guys, because they made the travel so very memorable.  Image if you will, after my bringing to his attention my backpack and other items needing to come with me, one of these two attendants heaving my very heavy backpack onto his back and heading off guiding the gurney with me on it out of the hospital to the vehicle.  I know how heavy the pack was, and he made it look like just another day at the office.  To say that I was impressed would be an understatement.

Once I was in a room in Owen Sound Hospital it was a literal flurry of people coming and going, and through it all I once again felt like I was the most important patient in the hospital.  This was now Monday morning, and by Monday afternoon I had met with Dr. Manwell, my Orthopedic Surgeon and he had recommended an action plan.  The surgery took place Monday afternoon, just a few hours after my admittance to Owen Sound.  I was discharged on Tuesday, picked up by my lovely wife Anita and am now resting and healing at my home.

I wish I could name all the people I have come into contact with during this adventure, but I cannot.  I wish I could thank each and every one personally, and tell them how much their kindness meant to me during a very difficult time.  Throughout the entire experience I was treated like royalty, and I can tell you I am not even close.  Being an incurable optimist I am always looking for the positive side of any experience, and in this case the silver lining behind a huge black cloud was the people I met.  Although I would be happier had I not broken my leg, certainly the experience has made it almost worthwhile …. almost.

 So my 2019 AT thru hike is no longer possible as the surgeon says I have at least six months of healing and rehab ahead of me.  I am now planning my thru hike to begin on February 17, 2020.  I will post again in the fall to let you know if that plan is still viable, so stay tuned.",,View Entry,"Jan 07, Mon",0
HiTech,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622982,"To all my friends, relatives, neighbors, and fellow hikers I say HELLO and welcome back to my journal.  In January I told you all that I would post again in the fall to let you know how the healing and rehab is going, so here I am.  
For those of you who were following my rather short lived adventure in January, you may recognize today’s photo. I am back in Wiarton today to head out on the Bruce Trail for 8 days to try out my leg repair.  The one big difference today is the obvious lack of snow on the ground, and the lack of winter clothing.  My total pack weight is down to 53 pounds including water and 8 days of fuel and food.  I will also be keeping the daily distance down this trip so as not to stress the leg. 
I am currently sitting next to Georgian Bay at my first overnight after hiking just 10.5 Km today.  It is GREAT to be on the trail again, especially when the weather is cooperating. The rain that was predicted to last well into the afternoon ended this morning and the sun came out early this afternoon resulting in an absolutely wonderful evening.  
I love hiking in the shoulder seasons not just because of the cooler temperatures but also the lack of pesky bugs. I wasn’t even wearing bug repellent today and still wasn’t bothered by the mosquitoes. This makes hiking so much more pleasurable. 
As for the leg, I am happy to report that it didn’t give me a bit of trouble or pain today. I guess Dr Manwell knew what he was talking about when he said I would definitely be able to hike again.  He will always be my hero for getting me back out here.  At this point, I can’t see any reason why my AT thru-hike can’t be put back on my agenda to start in February 2020. 
So there you have it.  I’m back, and raring to go. Of course I still have 7 days on the trail before my lovely wife picks me up for my return home, but if today is any indication it should be a great 7 days. Especially since the weather is predicted to be perfect hiking weather.",,View Entry,"Sep 15, Sun",0
HiTech,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623049,"I awoke today to drizzling rain, 11 degrees centigrade, and a cold breeze out of the North blowing right across the bay. You know that type of morning when even though the temperature isn’t that low, you still get chilled to the bone.  Today was one of those days that I REALLY appreciated my hot oatmeal and coffee. Today’s photo is as close to the sunrise as I was able to see. The clouds soon blocked any hope of a photo worthy sunrise. 
It seemed to take an eternity to do my morning chores and get packed up, partly due to the weather and partly because I needed to figure out why my pack was carrying crooked.  As it turns out when I had loaded my bearvault onto the top of my pack I had it askew and this problem was exaggerated when I put the small pack on top of it and strapped everything down. I have now done some sorting and repacking causing the pack to ride square on my back again.  
The good news is the rain stopped shortly after I started hiking today, and the sky cleared about half way through my 18.5 Km hike. I guess the weather gods continue looking favorably on me. I have now set up my very wet tent here at Cape Croker Campground and am letting it dry out a bit. 
Yes, you read that correctly, THE Cape Croker Campground. The very one that I was lying on the frozen ground in front of the office back in January waiting for an ambulance to arrive.  No broken bones this time, but then again no ice or snow either. 
The leg continues to perform without issue, although I’m a little tired tonight. I can definitely feel how out of shape I am after 8 months off the trail. I have a lot of work to do between now and next February if I’m going to survive my first few weeks on the AT.",,View Entry,"Sep 16, Mon",0
HiTech,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623108,"I have to admit the truth. I’m really spoiling myself on this trip. Two hot shower days in a row, and laundry today to boot. I’d better be careful not to let myself get too soft with all this luxury. 
I awoke this morning to an absolutely beautiful day. The sun was shining and not a cloud in the sky, but still cool enough to be great hiking weather. I didn’t rush out of camp because I knew I only had 12.5 Km to hike today, but I had forgotten about all the PUD’s in this area. For those who don’t know PUD stands for pointless ups and downs. It was a nice challenging section of the trail, and I loved every minute of it. I particularly liked the fact that it made me work my leg fairly hard, and I’m delighted to report that the leg was perfect. 
Speaking of ups and downs, today’s photo is just one example of an up. It’s a little hard to see in the photo, but the white in the background is actually a rock face that I need to get on top of. Fortunately there is a stairway of sorts to help get up the sheer face. Not your traditional stairway mind you, but rather a steep, narrow death trap that all the hikers use. Bring it on Rocksylvania, I’m ready for you. 
Today was the first time I actually came across someone else hiking. They were just day hikers, but I was beginning to think someone had closed the Bruce Trail and didn’t tell me. I must confess that I have been enjoying the solitude, but really, three days? 
So tonight I’m sitting in front of the camp store looking out over Georgian Bay listening to the gentle lapping of the tiny waves on the shore. Could life be any better than this?",,View Entry,"Sep 17, Tue",0
HiTech,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623156,"I awoke this morning to a stunning sunrise, and yet another perfect hiking day. Not a cloud in the sky, great hiking temperature and just enough of a gentle breeze to keep you cool. 
It was another day of PUD’s and I don’t mind saying, my feet are tired this evening. The rocks in this area twist and turn your feet into a real variety of angles and puts stress on your ankles that isn’t normal. On the other hand if it wasn’t for the rocks the view may just be a little boring. 
Our natural world provided me with some views of amazing rock formations today. Take a look at my photo library for just a few examples, but believe me when I say there were many more than these.
Today’s photo is of a glacial formation known as a “glacial pothole”.  It was formed about 10,000 years ago during the ice age. The almost perfectly round hole in the rock was formed as melting glaciers passed over the area and the meltwater eroded away the softer Limestone beneath. 
Today marks the halfway point in this journey, and so far I’m feeling great and looking forward to future hikes.",,View Entry,"Sep 18, Wed",0
HiTech,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623275,"Today I can’t give you either a sunrise or sunset photo as both were hidden from my view by the  Niagara escarpment. I can only assume they would both have been beautiful because again today I had perfect weather. I can’t believe how fortunate I have been in this regard. 

The Bruce Trail crosses over a large number of privately owned properties, the landowners of which have provided permission to hikers to cross their land. All Bruce trail hikers are appreciative of this, and most respect the landowner rules. Occasionally either the landowners refuse to give permission or there simply isn’t a viable route for the trail to take, and the trail must be routed over roads for a while. Today I hiked over one of these areas, and had to endure about 7 Km of road walking. Now in fairness, road miles are easy miles. It is a nice flat surface and is graded without any steep inclines. Unfortunately it is also usually very boring with very few if any views. 
For those of you who don’t know, I am a master electrician by trade and got into machine automation about halfway through my career.  When I was a young electrician I had the opportunity to interact with a very special breed of electricians called “Linemen “. You’ve all seen them, and may even have cussed them out for blocking traffic with their big trucks. They work on high voltage utility lines and equipment, including the pole mounted transformers most of us have seen atop hydro poles. The transformers are always mounted very high in the air because they are connected to very dangerous voltages. 
So you can imagine my surprise as I was walking along the road to see in the distance what I’m sure is one of those very transformers mounted very low on a pole. I convinced myself that I must be mistaken, but the closer I got the more sure I was. When I got right up to it I found today’s photo. The property owner and I had a conversation and it ends up that he was a lineman all his career and his grandson made this mailbox just for him. Accord to the owner many many people stop and take a photo of it.",,View Entry,"Sep 19, Thu",0
HiTech,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623277,"Once again today due to my orientation the sunrise and sunsets were obscured from my vision. That’s really a shame because I do so enjoy them. I did however once again have perfect hiking weather for my 18 Km hike today. 
Last night as I was cleaning up after dinner a father and son duo arrived at the backcountry site I was overnighting at. The father is a 25 year firefighter, and I’m embarrassed to say I have forgotten what the son does. Once they were settled in we all sat around and talked about hiking. The trials, tribulations, the joy and gear. Amongst many other things, we discussed my bear vault versus the hanging method he preferred. We looked at my vault and then at his food bag hang, and he told me it wasn’t one of his best. I commented that it was a little lame, but later in the evening as I was laying down to sleep I realized that was a pretty mean thing to say. 
I have mentioned in the past how your mind can play tricks on you in the backcountry especially at night. All night I kept hearing what I was certain was my bearvault being viciously attacked by a bear, and this morning I come to find out that he was awake hearing the same sounds but he was convinced his food hang was being attacked by apparently the same bear. 
We were both wrong. My bearvault remained exactly where I had left it and was untouched. His food bag was still hung exactly where he had hung it, but some animal got into it and stole a variety of his food. The good news is that the critter left the oatmeal that was to be their breakfast this morning and even more importantly he left the coffee. Since this was to be their last day on the trail there really wasn’t any harm done. This morning as we were packing to leave he told me he’s sold and his next purchase of gear will be a bear vault. 
Today’s photo is one of the many humorous Bruce Trail Blazes that we see along the trail from time to time. A little further along was a blaze even further out in the water suggesting that the trail was now a canoe path. In actuality however it was simply that the water has risen and washed out this section of the trail. There was no re-route available so a bit of bushwhacking was required.",,View Entry,"Sep 20, Fri",0

This morning as I was down at the lake doing my usual foot washing, I had a little frog as a companion. He wasn’t afraid of me at all and spent the entire time I was washing sitting in various places watching me. It is amazing how critters in the wild seem to have a sense of who is a threat and who isn’t. You can see my compadre in today’s photo.
My wife and I have finalized a change to my hiking itinerary. We have both been watching the weather forecast for Sunday, and have decided that there is no need for me to spend my last night and hiking day in the rain. After all, this hike was all about determining whether my repaired leg was up to backpacking again and that question has been answered with an emphatic yes. So today I left the Reeds Dump Overnight Rest area and headed back South to Lions Head where I have booked into a nice quaint B & B.  Anita has left work a little early to drive up and meet me here, and we will have a nice leisurely dinner together.
