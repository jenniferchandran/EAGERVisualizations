Crocs n socks,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610594,"Today officially started my journey North. I had an amazing weekend leading up to this day with some of my favorite people, my mom, my dad and Michelle. Saying bye this morning was hard to say the least. I started from Springer Mountain and am camping at Gooch Gap. 15 miles on day 1 is a bit more than I planned on. Going to force myself to have a short day tomorrow, about 8 miles or so. Udo crushed yesterday, never looked tired until camp, then he never looked awake (lololol)! While at camp I met 6 people attempting thru hikes. Unfortunately, I don't remember their names. Weather is supposed to be chilly tonight, a low of 38 with 20 mile an hour winds. All in all I'm so thankful to be out here living out a dream. -""Crocs n socks"" and Udo, two happy campers.","Springer Mountain

Crocs n socks,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610628,"Today I forced myself to go slow, traveling from Gooch Mountain Shelter to Lance Creek... 8.2 miles. I arrived at Lance Creek at about 3:45pm which made for a long day at camp. I spent time chatting with a few guys my age who are also attempting a Thru hike. It was nice to hear a bit about who they are off trail. I believe we are renting a pet friendly cabin tomorrow at Neels Gap. I know there are pizza and wings at Neels Gap so I am excited to get there. So far Udo is a complete trail All-Star with way more energy than his human counter part (me). I am impressed at his route selection, he definitely picks the easiest path on trail. All in all, things are well. I'm writing this journal entry from my sleeping bag cuddled up with Udo.

Summited Blood before 9:30am! Decided to eat a second breakfast while enjoying the view!! Then I descended the two miles to Neels Gap and met up with the crew I have been seeing. Unfortunately, the cabin only had 3 beds and 6 people ended up invited... I bailed and cowboy camped (no tent) behind Mountain Crossings. P.S.

Udo's claws and the blow up pad didn't work. This was something I was expecting to happen, but not this soon. The positive side is this happened right behind Mountain Crossings Hostel, which happens to have an extensive gear shop attached to it. And the pad was also a few years old. I switched to the Thermatest Prolite. As I lay on it typing this journal I would say it's pretty darn comfortable. It's also more durable (and heavier) than my previous pad, now enough about my bed.Today was another light day, 7 trail miles and 1.2 Blue blaze (side trail) miles to Whitley Gap shelter. All starting from Neels Gap. The reason for another short day I felt some pain/fatigue in my left knee. As soon as I felt it start to bug me I slowed down and coasted into this cozy little shelter at 3353 feet above sea level. Should be a good place for Udo and I to ride out the incoming weather and rest up the knee. As of now the plan is to take another short day tomorrow to make sure we can leave this knee crap in Georgia. As they say, ""No pain, no rain, no Maine"".I want to say thank you so much to those of you taking time out of your day to follow along with my journey!

This is my first Easter in who knows how long, I haven't been with my family, and that hurt a bit. Luckily, they understand I'm out here living out a dream. Shouts out to the family!!!Now back to why everyone is here... Udo! He is doing well, currently sleeping next to me, curled up in a ball, under his blanket, cowboy camping in Addis Gap. Today we hiked 13.6 miles and it was amazing, some spectacular views, and challenging climbs. I don't know the exacts because I'm not that kind of hiker, but plenty of thousands of feet in elevation change but up and down... lol it feels great to have my legs underneath me feeling strong! I'm currently 5.5 miles from Dicks Creek Gap and Top of Georgia Hostel, which means I'm 5.5 miles from cheeseburgers and pizza!! Plan to take a zero in Hiawwasse to check out the town, eat in multiple restuarants, and rest/ice the legs (old football ways die hard)As always, thank you for reading. -""Crocs n socks"" & UdoP.S.

Crocs n socks,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611276,"Today was another amazing day on the trail! I did about 6 miles into Hiawassee, which is a small town located 9 miles off the trail. I split a room at the Budget Inn in Hiawassee for two nights with a friend I met hiking. The price was $100 cash...The place has an excellent location right next to a Dairy Queen (pictured) and Taco Bell. Which was lunch and dinner in the above order!
I feel like I can't just announce a trail buddy without some information. He is from South Africa, and lives on a 100 acre farm back home. His brother did the AT  in 2012, which put it on his radar, and how here he is. We somewhat just ended up at the same campsites for the first few days, chatting over dinner. Now it somehow it feels like I've known him my whole life, but that's just how the trail works. I believe we will be hiking together/to the same destinations for a while. 
Tomorrow, it's rest and more rest. If you are wondering why the second rest day so early, understand I have hiked the equivalent of Mt. Everest in elevation change. To go from a desk job to this life can be a bit of a shock to the body and joints and I want to give them time to get used to their new life!
Some Udo info: Still an absolute STUD on trail. His fur is just as clean as when we started, it is amazing how the mud just dries and falls off of his coat. He still hates getting his pads waxed, even though we do it 3 times a day. I found about 4.5 lbs of dog food in a hiker box (box of free stuff left by hikers and townies). Gave Udo half of it today and he will get the other half tomorrow. He needs his town feasts as well!!! 
Tomorrow I am a tourist, not a hiker, I plan on checking out some of the local eateries (not fast food). Stay tuned for tomorrow's entry.

Kicked around and wasted time until 1:30 pm when the special started at Daniels Steak House. $8.25, which includes tax and a drink for their lunch buffet. The food was excellent and the service was top notch, a true southern homestyle buffet. From their it was back to the Budget Inn to chill at my ""office"", that picnic table in the above picture. Some trail magic showed up in the form of brats, both spicy/non-spicy, and sodas of both the adult and children's kind. We grilled, feasted, listened to tunes, while soaking up the hot Georgia sun (today was 80 degrees). I'm in bed now and back to the trail tomorrow. I enjoyed Hiawassee, but feel like a kid before Christmas tonight, so excited to get back to my sanctuary, back to the trail! The Budget Inn has free shuttles back to the trail at 9 AM and 11 AM.

Total milage for the day was 14.3 miles from standing Indian shelter to a stealth Camo site. .5 after the submit of Albert Mt, the plan was to sleep on the submit but 40° temps with 35 mile an hour winds talked us out of it. Today's miles officially put me over 100 miles hiked! As I sleep tonight, I will be 5.5 miles from Rock Gap which is the access point to Franklin NC. I have a mail drop at the Gooder Grove Hostel, I will probably spend the night in town and then back to the trail Sunday.

Crocs n socks,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611970,"Saturday 4/27: Today was a short hiking day into Franklin, did 5 miles and got a ride to Gooder Grove Hostel from the owner, Zen. The place is an awesome hiker hostel with a full kitchen, laundry, and just about anything else you can ever need. Polo, Udo and I got a private room, split between polo and I... Udo said he forgot his wallet. Unfortunately, Udo was involved in a minor dog scuffle. Udo ended up with a small puncture wound on his leg. I didn't notice this until about 2 hours later when he started to limp on the way  home from lunch (which was phenomenal from the Motor Co Grill in Franklin). Zen, the owner of Gooder Grove, drove into town to pick Udo and I up and took us back to the Hostel for the rest of the day. Sunday 4/28: Zero day today as Udo is still not too happy to put weight on his foot. He has clearly made great progress over night, but I have been keeping it covered and using Neosporin on the cut to prevent him from licking it for hours and causing an infection. Monday 4/29: Udo is looking great today. The leg wound is all closed up and no more limp!! The Hostel owner suggested that I give him one more day of rest, so Polo and I decided we would do the 10 miles from Rock Gap to Wyaha Gap while Udo was resting in the room at the hostel. With some shuttling from Zen we made it happen. Tomorrow it's back to the trail for all of us and we are pushing for the Nanthahala Outdoor Center in a day and a half.~""Crocs n socks"" & Udo (and special thanks to Zen of Gooder Grove, he has shown hospitality and generosity I will never forget!!)(P.S.

We did 17 miles from Wyaha bald observation tower to Rufus Morgan shelter. We started at 10:30 and took two 45 minute breaks, one for lunch, and one for an amazing view. We were still able to get to camp just as the last bit of usable light was disappearing. Ended up crashing in the shelter where there was the drunkest man I've ever seen on trail. He was a happy drunk, but a loud one and continued to make ""jokes"" until about midnight. Some of his content was:""What if Neo ate the red pill instead of the blue pill"" ""If homeless people live under Bridges where do the trolls live""The rest of the crew in the shelter is polo, Bones, (who is a Surgeon) Kevin, (who is wasted) and no name.

We did 7 miles of continuous uphill, 2,600 feet of elevation gain, and if I'm being honest it wasn't all that hard. We got to camp around 5:30 pm and was perfect. We claimed our spot in the shelter, and had a fire. We packed some stuff to have campfire pizzas, and my God they were good. Today's shelter has a crew of about 20 people, which is nice, but also kind of a lot. Tomorrow, there is a shelter 15 miles away, and come hell or high water, we will be there!

We walked through complete downpours and thunderstorms all day. We did 14.7 miles from Sassafras Gap shelter to Yellowcreek road. From Yellow Creek road we (Bones, Polo, and I) got a shuttle to Creekside Paradise, because I had a box to pick-up there. Creekside Paradise has been an amazing experience so far, complete with a hot tub and a hot breakfast tomorrow morning.

We hiked from Yellow Creek Gap to the visitors Center at Fontana Dam. A whopping 8 miles.. Unfortunately, because of the (stupid) rules of the Smokies, we would have had to do another 10 miles to the first shelter. The Smoky Mountains are one of very few places with ""rules"" on the AT. The rules are: pay 20 dollars to walk through and only camp at designated shelters or campgrounds. So once again, tomorrow, we are somewhat forced into stopping at 11.4 miles at Mollies Ridge Shelter. On a positive note the weather tomorrow is supposed to be beautiful, so the trail will have a chance to dry out a bit. Today someone from Florida (I won't share their info) friended me on Facebook to better follow my journey. Something like this may seem trivial but to me it was a huge motivation boost! So thank you!Tonight I go to sleep anxious to enter the Great Smokey Mountains!

The first 11 miles of the Smokies was a gentle and gradual climb for most of the day, with a bit of downhill sprinkled in. Believe it or not, uphill is far easier than down hill hiking. Going down puts a lot of strain on your joints, where uphill is just a muscle burn and cardio work. Tomorrow it's 12.1 miles to Derrick's Knob Shelter.

The weather wish came true yet another perfect weather day! We started one of the earliest yet, leaving camp at 9:15. (Keep your judgement to yourselves) I found it funny we left so early on a day we only had 7.4 miles to hike. We stopped for lunch at Siler Bald shelter, it was an awesome hour + break but  I lost my vape. ( e-cig) I was almost positive I had it on the cooking table. I searched and searched for about a half hour with no luck. On the way from Siler's Bald to Double Spring Shelter a group of Southbound section Hikers told me that one of the people eating lunch at the shelter noticed they picked it up and left it here for me!! Tomorrow it's 5 miles and then into Gattlinburg to pick up a mail drop. ( Food for Udo and I) Talking about a Mail drop seems like the perfect time to mention my ""trail boss""/girlfriend/better half/Michelle. Michelle uses  AWOLS Appalachian Trail Guide book to pick locations to send  food and other supplies for Udo and I. She also post every single one of these Journal entries. So shouts out to her! Thanks Babe!! 
Udo update:
Still not one assist, he has handled every obstacle the trail has thrown at him effortlessly including sketchy a** fire towers. His pads look excellent and I hugely attribute this to Mushers Secret Pad Wax and him not carrying a pack. I personally don't believe a dog is designed to hike all day under a load. (No judgement on those who do) Tomorrow Udo and I will break the 200 miles hiked mark and I am so thankful and grateful he has been at my side every step if the way!

We only hiked 6 miles and hitched a ride from an awesome man and woman into Gatlinburg, Tennessee.

Bones took us all out for a Mexican feast to celebrate 200 miles! Thanks Bones! Tomorrow we will take a zero and be tourists for the day. Friday, May 10th - Zero day! Started things off with a re-supply run for the guys to the Food City. The prices were so cheap, it was mind blowing. We rode the trolley system they had, which was awesome. It ran all over the town, and a day pass was a whole $2. The second mission of the day was a trip to the Log Cabin Pancake House. The service was incredible, and so was the food. We all waddled back to the hotel for a nap. Then it was to the pool, hot tub, and sauna. Saturday, May 11th - First of all, today is my mom's birthday!! Happy Birthday Mama Bear!

We started at 10:30am and arrived at camp at 8:20pm. I could tell as we walked the ridges today it would have been a day full of absolutely epic views, but today they were masked by a shield of fog. When I got to the shelter it was ""full"", needless to say, I'm typing this from the shelter... on a rainy night,  until a shelter is legitimately shoulder to shoulder, it's not full. The smokies have been great but I am very ready to be out of them. The flocks of section hikers are a bit overwhelming. There is currently at least 30 people at this campsite. 15 in the shelter and 15 in tents. Less than half are thru hikers, it's nothing against section hikers and more just about volume. On a positive note, some things I love about weekenders is that they always pack too much food. Something I am happy to help them out with . Tomorrow its about 13 miles to Cosby Knob Shelter and that is the goal. I would love a dry day, but am fully prepared to cruise through another rainy day with a smile on my face!

This process ended up really stressing both her and I out, so I kinda just gave up on it. I was keeping notes though with the intentions of doing one long journal post as a recap. (Here is that post)
Monday night we slept in Tri corner Knob shelter, there was a group of men from Alabama with 4 horses. I didn't mind them being around but Udo wasn't thrilled to be around the ""Giant Dogs"". Tuesday night we spent the night at Cosby's Knob Shelter and it was the coldest night of this trip, with temps dipping to the low 30's with 20 mile an hour winds. Three section hikers rolled into the shelter around dusk and tried to flex their reservation passes for the shelter. ( Section hikers get preference in the Smokies), we all chuckled at them and told them to hop on in and that more bodies equal more heat. They didn't find it as funny as we did and that's okay! Wednesday morning was that same, low 30's with sustained 20 mile an hour winds. I was truly concerned about my fingers for a little bit, but as we got hiking we warmed up. We made great time because every time we stopped for water or a break you felt like hypothermia was kicking in. Last night we broke a rule and slept in Mt Camnerer fire tower. (Shhhhh) The tower offered some of the best views I have ever seen in my life! We watched both the sunset and the sunrise. The fire tower is fully enclosed which made for a warm, wind free night! Today (4/15) was a quick and easy 8 miles to Standing Bear Farm Hostel. (The most popular hostel on the AT) Most importantly, we left the Smokies today which was an absolutely phenomenal feeling! As my start date was April 15th and today is May 15th I feel a mile count is in order, my total miles hiked in my first month on trail was 241.1. This pace is slower than I had hoped to start, but definitely not horrible in my opinion. I am hopeful to do closer to 400 miles from May-June! I want to get more miles in, but will never lose track of the fact that ""it's about the SMILES not the MILES."" Thanks for being patient with me and these Journals! Love,""Crocs n socks"" & Udo

Crocs n socks,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614047,"Thursday, May 16 - Today was a slower than usual start we had a rough time getting out of Standing Bear. I would like to blame their no checkout time policy! Somehow we made it out of the trap and on trail at about 12:30. We climbed and climbed and climbed for about 11 of our 13.5 miles to Max Patch. Max Patch is a huge bald mountain top with grass field that make perfect camping spots. Polo, Oatmeal and I all decided to cowboy camp to look at the stars. Life was good, until about 4:30 AM when are slumber was rudely interrupted by the rain. We threw our tents up as fast as possible, and went back to sleep, damp and frustrated! Friday, May 17 - Another slow start, the rain continued until about 9 AM. Amazingly it stopped raining and was sunny minutes later. The sun was great to dry out the stuff that got wet last night in the cowboy camp mishap. Unfortunately, drying gear in the sun takes time and we once again weren't started until noon. We wouldn't let that hold us back though we did 16.6 miles to Deer Park Mountain Shelter. It felt great to do two higher milage days in a row, no pain or soreness! Tomorrow it's a short day into hot springs for, food, food, food , a resuply box, and stove fuel. Polo is currently uncharacteristically snoring next to me in the shelter, figured i would call him out for it on here! (Still love you Polo) Life is amazingly simple out here and I love it. Go hiking I promise you won't regret it!Saturday, May 18 - Today was a short 3.3 into Hot Springs NC. We broke camp at 8AM which was by a long shot a record for us!! It was easy to get up and moving because it was about 3 miles to the Smokey Mountain Diner, we nearly ran. Before hitting the diner we stopped off at Laughing Heart Hostel to pick up my mail drop. (Shouts out Michelle) The owner was awesome and ended up allowing us all to wash our clothes there when we found out there is just about zero washing machines in Hot Springs! From Breakfast, we checked into the Alpine Court Motel, which was a solid room for hikers, and the 80 dollar price tag wasn't bad split 3 ways. That's right I said 3 ways, and no it wasn't Oatmeal or Bones as the third! We picked up another friend, Rosebud! Her hiking partners went to Trail Days and that wasn't her thing so she has been running with us! This town visit was a bit special thanks to a visit from Michelle's cousin and his lovely Wife! (Names left out as always) They brought Polo and I some awesome energy and electrolyte hiker snacks, as well as some phenomenal cookies! The trail magic didn't end there though, they also took us out to a phenomenal dinner at the tavern down the street from the Motel! The fact that they drove almost an hour to come spend some time with us and take a peak into our simple life was awesome and a huge thank you to them!
Sunday, May 19 - Today was an awesome day for hiking and we took advantage hiking 14.8 miles. Unfortunately we didn't get out of town until about noon. Hot Springs is a town where the trail is legitimately the side walk of the main street. We were unable to walk past the diner without stopping, and ended up eating breakfast on our way out! The hiking today was challenging, with a lot of ups and relatively steep downs. We saw two bears, one was a juvenile, and the other was a well fed adult. Both of the bears looked at us and continued to eat the grubs or whatever they were after! My body feels great as we start to push bigger miles. I unfortunately have a blister on my pinky toe, which is a bit annoying but far from a deal breaker. Blisters form Calluses, so the way I'm thinking about it, is soon I will have rock feet! Tomorrow it's a 12 mile day to Jerry's Cabin Shelter. The weather report says 20% chance of thunderstorms tomorrow, here's to hoping that doesn't happen! Another huge piece of news is that tomorrow we will break the 300 miles hiked mark! Stay tuned for a cool picture. Today we were down one in the tramily, Oatmeal. He got held up in town with his lady and didn't end up on trail until about 6PM, he pushed/is pushing late into the night and will be camped a half mile behind us tonight! Tomorrow he will likely catch us or meet us at the shelter! (The tramily will be full again)
Udo update:He is legitimately frustratingly good at hiking. Pads look just as healthy as when we left. Never tired. Still not one assist by me, meaning he has climbed every rock, crossed every river, log Bridges, etc. 
Goodnight y'all! ""Crocs n socks"" and Udo","Standing Bear

Crocs n socks,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614716,"Tuesday, May 21st - 20 miles from Log Cabin Drive to Devils Fork Gap. The hike was super easy after the first 6 mile climb. There were some awesome rock scrambles along the ridge, which offered some killer views. We met a group of people on the AT for the first time they were walking it. They walked 2 miles from their car and back. They were blown away by us and the fact that people would walk from Georgia to Maine. We answered their questions and made their day. Some people may get annoyed by people like us. Wednesday, May 22nd - Zero day dealing with Garmin after the SOS incident. Also recovering from our first 20 mile day... lolol (editors note. the ""Garmin SOS incident"", was a stressful hour of Crocs dad, brother, and mines life. During which, Croc's breaking Garmin phone triggered an SOS alert, calling his dad telling him there was trouble. Luckily it was just a faulty product, and Crocs was contacted shortly after. Garmin has resolved the issue..)Thursday, May 23rd - Today was our biggest day by far, hiking 22.1 miles. From Devils Fork to Spivey Gap. The trail was not easy either, with about 6,000 feet of climbing and another 6,000 feet of decent. The day was perfect for hiking weather wise. Water has been great on the trail. Sometimes I carry almost none, because the water sources are so frequent. There were lots of bald mountains today, which means lots of views! I was tired after the long day, but not in pain! We spent the night at Nature's Inn Hostel, where i ate some amazing homemade smoked pulled pork.Friday, May 24th - 11 from Spivey Gap to Erwin. Today was a quick and easy day of hiking, and the trail was super easy and soft from pine needles. We made good time, almost 3 miles an hour, because we were told there would be McDonald's right across the street from the trail... this unfortunately did not turn out to be true, but we still made great miles. We got a hitch from the first car we threw a thumb to! It was a cool, older gentleman, who was actually on his way to the dump to unload a mattress. We were happy to help him unload it in return for the ride! McDonald's was awesome, Udo ate a couple of cheeseburgers as well. We hitched a ride back to the trail after McDonalds. This time we were waiting for about 15 minutes, when a Spanish man pulled up, who spoke no English, but was clearly offering us a ride. I typed the address into my phone's GPS and showed the route. 3.8 miles, 13 minutes. He waved us all in, and we were back to Uncle Johnny's Hostel in no time! Tonight we are sleeping just off the trail in Erwin. There was an awesome campsite right along the river, with a flat sand beach. Tomorrow it is a zero to explore Erwin, and have a campfire BBQ! Life is good on the trail. Current Mile: 344.4. Saturday, May 25h - Journal got out of hand. Super frustrating trying to go back and figure more out. Getting a new satellite phone and really want to do a better job with these journals. Having a detailed day to day blog will be cool and something I can have forever. Also, I know some of y'all enjoy reading them. Today we took a zero, and are sleeping under the bridge in Erwin. We had an awesome cookout, making hot dogs and brats. Tomorrow we are climbing 12 miles out of town, and will be back on the trail. Sorry again for the delay, and down right skip jobs. But I'm back on it now! -Crocs n Socks & Udo","Jerry's Cabin Shelter

Crocs n socks,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614837,"Sunday, May 26th - 13 miles today out of Erwin! We climbed 4787 feet and it was an easy day! We took an hour lunch break at Curley Maple Gap Shelter, where there was a 2019 message board. We all signed it, and named our tramily ""The NASA Rejects"". We ended up sleeping on the top of Unaka Mountain in the ""Enchanted Pine Forest"". The pine needles made for an awesomely soft floor to put the sleep pad on! It was hot today... 89..but we never let that affect our spirits, and that was awesome. We had a fire for the third night in a row, which is effectively 3 more fires than I planned on starting when I set off on this trip (shouts out Polo). Tomorrow we plan on doing 13 miles to Clyde Gap Shelter. I also have to swing into Greasy Creek Hostel to grab my ressuply box (shouts out Michelle). Goodnight y'all and enjoy your Monday one way or another! PS - we are at the point now where we have to make sure to take the same way out of water sources to be positive not to miss even 10 yards of the trail! Monday, May 27th - Today we did 11 miles to Greasy Creek Gap and then walked .7 to Greasy Creek Friendly. When we arrived, we found out they had a free Memorial Day cookout starting at 6, so we were all but forced to stay! The place was messy, but we had a nice night camping outside. They even had an office (picnic table) by where we set up camp. Tomorrow we climb one of the notable mountains on the trail... Roan Mt! We will also sleep on the summit which the highest shelter on the AT at over 6,000 feet! The hike there looks challenging and a few ""Thru"" hikers chose to skip it. No one from our crew will, but we did all get a good laugh talking about the astrict * that will be next to their name if they're honest! Update tomorrow from 6000+ feet.~""crocs n socks"" & Udo","Erwin

Crocs n socks,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614917,"Today was an 11 mile day up Roan Mountain! The hike up was significantly overhyped, we had a conversation for the few hours we climbed up the mountain. We were told earlier in the day by a group of Southbound hikers that the (water) source on top of the mountain was dry. This meant that we would be carrying 4-5 liters for 5 miles up the mountain (1 liter is over 2 pounds). As we were filling up, I found a bathroom that was at the summit in a parking lot a few hundred yards off the trail, just half a mile from where we would be camping! When I told the guys, a dance party broke out, with DJ Polo D on the tunes!We rode the excitement up the mountain and all the way to camp.  
This shelter is at 6,207 feet above sea level, due to the wind on the summit, the shelter has 4 walls and a door, this is not typical for the AT. We had a fire yet again tonight, this time started by a guy named ""Walmart"" who we had met briefly in Erwin & happened to be here tonight as well. Tomorrow we don't have have a plan, but would like to do at least 12 miles or so. 
9 more days until the family/girlfriend comes to see me and until Polo gets to experience Mama Karb's cooking!
Goodnight Y'all

Crocs n socks,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615315,"Wednesday, May 29th - Today we did a whopping 2 miles to The Station at 19E. We heard from a few hikers that it was the coolest hostel so far, and we had to put this to the test. Turns out they were all right. The bunkhouse sits above a restaurant pub & there is a pool table and a movie theater. About 20 hikers all watched Deadpool 2. I racked up a 40 dollar food tab.. not so sure how that happened. Tomorrow we are doing 14 and ending back up here at the station!Thursday, May 30th - To just cut right to the chase, today was my absolute favorite day ever on the AT. We hiked 14 miles and swam 3 times, 2 of which were in waterfalls! The trail was so flat that it may as well have been a ""family trail."" Udo was completely swimming at our spot on the river, I was a proud but nervous dog dad! Today while we were hiking we came to a random pine forest, the scenery transitioned from a million shades of green to just as many oranges and reds from all of the needles in different stages of decay. We all stopped, paused our music, and enjoyed the complete silence. All said and done, we turned a 6 hour hike into an all day event and I loved every minute of it. Today was the first day of this trip that I legitimately felt sad as it was ending. According to the hostel owner tomorrow is supposed to be one of the most beautiful hikes on the AT (Roan Highlands). I am going to bed tonight so sure that I am doing exactly what I am supposed to be doing at this point in my life.Friday, May 31st - Another awesome day of hiking in the Roan Highlands. I 1000% suggest this section to someone looking to do a first trip. The miles are relatively flat and absolutely beautiful. Today was a day full of Bald mountains and 360° views. We hiked 14.8 miles, officially leaving NC for good, as well as crossed the 400 mile mark. 408.5 but who's counting!! There was a live band at The Station at 19E and Bones offered to get us a shuttle back to check out the band so that's what we did. It was an awesome experience hanging out with the local folks and listening to a 2 man ""blue grassish"" band. Tomorrow we will shuttle back to the trail and hike to Laurel Fork Falls. Which is a large waterfall along the trail in TN. My shoes are officially shredded I will have to get a new pair in Demascus. 400 Miles of AT hiking completely destroyed my socks and shoes! As weird as this may sound, destroying this pair of shoes gives me a sense of accomplishment.

Crocs n socks,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616724,"First of all, I'm sorry to anyone who was faithfully reading this. I got lost in the the trail life and haven't posted in quite some time. We are at trail mile 589, which is over 25% of the trail completed. Another huge update is that we are carrying a US Army Flag and collecting signatures on our journey... We are doing this in Honor of the hiker Stronghold who was murdered on the Appalachian Trail. The trail is long, and tests you more mentally then it does physically in so many ways. I fell into a funk for a few days, but as I write this journal I feel focused again and ready to continue accomplishing my dream. The visit with my family recharged me, but also left me feeling lonely when everyone left! The countdown is back on though, 2 weeks and a day until I get to see everyone again! Polo and I hiked a marathon (26.2 miles) a few days ago, and are finally feeling recovered lolol. Tomorrow it's a quick 15 with a stop at Brushy Mountain Outpost for breakfast! The trail is still an adventure like no other, even on the roughest toughest days, I know I am blessed to be here.

I got away from posting due to the fact that I was embarrassed at my pace. The NASA Rejects were hanging out and having too much fun in too many towns. We decided to flip up to Pine Grove, PA area and get on the trail at he 501 Shelter. We will hike from here, 996 miles to Mt. Katahdin, then travel back to Daleville, VA and finish the Appalachian Trail when we get back to the 501 Shelter. This is not exactly how I wanted to hike the trail (I wanted to go tip to tip), but it will be better to hike into October in Virginia and Maryland, than it will be in Maine. I don't have any regrets about the beginning of the hike, but am looking forward to pushing myself for the next 1,000 miles. For some updates: We had the most amazing week off, starting with some Trail Magic from Michelle's Aunt Barb! She took us all into her home, we swam and ate for a solid 36 hours! Then it was off to Cape May for some Mama Karb treatment (food, food, food)!! It was amazing seeing all my people, and honestly energizing for my spirit! I went out for dinner with Michelle, and it was the most normal life thing I have done since I started the trail, I loved it. Tomorrow it is back to hiking, and also back to this journal.
