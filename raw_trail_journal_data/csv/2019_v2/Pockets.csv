Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/260676,"After doing 5 section hikes in the past 5 years, and recently being laid off from work, I have come to the conclusion that this might be my best/only chance to hike the trail. I'm still looking for work, but given the state of the local economy, the opportunity to find local work right now seems pretty slim. I have 95% of the equipment I need (need a water filter, food, and maybe some cold weather clothes), the go-ahead from my wife, and lots of encouragement from my many brothers and sisters (who don't really think I'm going to do it). I have until early April to get things in order - planning to start April 15th to try and avoid the worst of the winter weather in the NC/Tenn mountains, so I'll probably fly down to Charlotte sometime around April 10th and have my brother 'Cotton' drive me to Springer Mountain. I plan on re-reading ""White Blaze Fever"" written by a 50 something year old guy (I'm 55) as a memory jogger to ensure I don't forget anything. Main thing I remember from all my other reading is that most drop off the trail due to injuries from going ""too far, too fast, too soon"".",,Gettin Started,"Jan 22, Thu",0
Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/260808,"I had a job interview yesterday. I think it went well, but you never know about these things. I wonder if my age (55) will be held against me. Still planning on hiking the trail if I don't have a job (or a really good prospect in sight) by April 1st, and will head to Springer around April 12th or 13th (just after Easter). If I do get this or another engineering position before April 1st, that will push my trail hike off until probably 2014 when others in my family would be able to do the AT as well. So....I'm starting to gather stuff that I need for a hike this year (filter, food, warm clothes, trail guides, and maybe new hiking boots. On my section hikes, I've been able to keep my pack weight down to about 40#, but that didn't included a water filter because I was sharing one with others. I haven't decided whether or not to replace my Jetboil stove...it is heavy but sooo convenient. My goal is to keep my pack weight the same as before (40#). I hope to avoid the coldest weather and most of the snow by waiting until April 15th to start. I've been re-reading ""White Blaze Fever"" to pick up on his 'hiker hints', especially those that pertain to older hikers.",, EMS,"Jan 27, Tue",0
Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/476595,"Jump ahead 5.5 years....The last entry was dated January of 2009 and I had just had a job interview. To summarize, I got the job, the thru-hike was put on hold, and I continued with my annual AT and PCT section hikes with brothers and sisters. But things are changing. I gave notice at work that as of March 31th 2015 I will be leaving my to 'pursue interests that will require my full time attention' i.e. thru-hike the AT. The job was/is great, I work with a great group of people, I am deeply appreciative that my employer was willing to take a chance on a 55 year old back in 2009 when the economy was tanking, but now I'm 61 and it's now or never. I choose 'now'. During my section hikes I've already covered about 800 miles of the AT, so I think I know what I'm getting into. I've hiked from Fontana Dam in N.C to I-81 north of Damascus, from Waynesboro to Front Royal in the Shenandoah National Park, and from Bear Mountain Bridge in NY to Woodstock in Vermont. I've also spent a week on the PCT in Washington State in 2013. These week long section hikes have been some of the best vacations I've had in the the past 11 years - eagerly awaited and long remembered.I've been getting the homestead prepared for my absence next year to minimize the chance that a domestic emergency will call me home (lawn mover repaired, septic system pumped, deck stained, driveway sealed, etc. I've gotten the flu and shingles immunizations and I'm working out at the gym 5 days a week after work alternating between cardio and weights. I don't really know what else to do to prepare. My sister 'Spyder' says that I will not finish because I am not certain I will be one of the 20% who do. I just think I'm a realist; only 20% finish so I know there's a good chance I won't make it. To think otherwise is self-delusion. I am also aware of the saying ""If you think you can, or if you think you can't, you're right"". I think I can! And as Yoda says “Do or do not. There is no try.”. So I'm not 'trying' to thru-hike, I'm doing it!!",,Reset,"Oct 16, Thu",0
Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/476902,"While perusing the other 2015 planning journals, it has become clear to me that I'll be near the tail end of the northbound-from-Springer hiker pack in 2015. There are a couple of benefits to this, primarily that I should miss most of the snow , and secondarily that there is a greater chance that there will be room for me in the shelters. (A downside is that the shelter mice will be highly experienced in the art of stealing hiker food). I don't particularly like sleeping in freezing temperatures. Even if I manage to stay warm during the night, dragging myself out of a warm bag into cold and maybe windy weather is near the bottom of my ""Things I Enjoy"" list. Since I tend to deal with heat better than cold, delaying the start date until mid-April seems like a good idea, although I'm aware that it might put me in New Hampshire and Maine during the cold months of autumn. My modus operandi has throughout life typically been to delay dealing with problems (i.e cold weather) rather than tackling them head on. By delaying, who knows, the problem may take care of itself. (This trait, by the way, can be found in psychology books under ‘character defects’, and doesn't always go over well with my wife with regard to fixing things around the house).On a different tangent - There's a number of different ways I've looked at a thru-hike on the AT. At first I just considered it a socially acceptable way to live the hobo life - the Tom Sawyer/Huck Finn carefree walkabout. That evolved into looking at it as a type of pilgrimage - similar to Muslims trekking to Mecca or the Christian version as written about in The Canterbury Tales. Now I tend to look at it as more of a transition/reset event similar to Marine Corps boot camp (yes, I was there) - a disruption of old habits/lifestyle/routines/attitudes out of which comes, presumably, a new appreciation of a simpler, less hectic, and less materialistic life. (This was NOT the goal of MCRD, Parris Island, however - they had a different sort of transformation in mind).""A ship is safe in the harbor, but that is not what ships are built for""William G.T.

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/478406,"I've been kind of wishy-washy on the start date: On the one hand, I don't particularly want to be hiking and setting up camp in the snow; on the other hand, I want to give myself enough time to finish the hike without worrying if I have enough time. Originally I was planning on quitting work on March 31st and starting the AT on April 15th. Now I am leaning towards quitting on or around March 22th and heading south the Monday after Easter (April 6th). 9 or 10 days isn't a big deal in the over all scope of things, I guess, but it will probably put me 150 miles further down the trail at any given time. Probably lots of people starting early April, so there will be less room in shelters.My conditioning has been going well - getting lots of uphill miles on the treadmill at Planet Fitness (maybe they'll sponsor me!). It provides double service since I am doing the treadmill (6 miles MWF, 3 miles plus weight machines on TT) in my hiking boots, breaking them in. I'm the only one there wearing hiking boots (Merrell) with medium weight wool socks - everyone else has the latest in color-coordinated light-weight training shoes. I've often wondered about that - if you go to the gym to get a good workout, why be concerned about having lightweight shoes - kind of like searching for the closest parking spot so you don't have to walk as far to get into the gym. On an equipment note, I had been thinking about replacing my 30F sleeping bag with a 20F bag, but decided instead to get a sleeping bag liner (Sea to Summit Reactor Extreme) to provide some extra warmth. I'll use the money saved to get some better clothes.",,4 Months,"Nov 22, Sat",0
Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479288,"Went to see Wild yesterday - been looking forward to seeing it ever since I read the book and saw a preview. I was watching it trying to decide if it would entice more people to hike the PCT. I think it will - it didn't show the strenuous work it takes to climb the hills/mountains. I've done a lot of section hiking on the AT and there are times when climbing that you take 80 steps, stop to catch your breath, take another 80 steps, stop again to get your breath, another 80 steps, etc. In the movie Wild, none of this work is shown - in one scene Reese is in town for a re-supply - in the next she's traipsing around the tops of the Sierra Nevadas. There are about 6 different things that motivate people to do long distance hiking - adventure, the challenge, emotional therapy, to think out life transitions, personal growth, and to live the trail culture (OK - I'm sure there are more than these 6). Wild was very heavy on the 'emotion therapy' motivation.   All that being said, I did enjoy the movie.My planning has been progressing, although slower than it should be. I've put all my monthly payments on 'auto-pay' - all I need to do is keep enough money in the checking account. I've acquired all my 'stuff' except for perhaps another 1 or 2 pieces of clothing. I need to start planning my 4 or 5 mail drops - where they will be and what will be in them. I also need to get the maps and data books.As a note of interest, one of my sisters is also hiking the AT this year - starting before me. One thing I've learned from my section hiking is that I prefer to hike alone. When section hiking with my brothers and sisters, I have found it is very hard to HYOH. I don't want that limitation on my thru-hike. I guess that might be a bit selfish of me, but a thru-hike is a selfish endeavor in any event. It's something that one does for oneself, and is, for most of us, just tolerated by spouses left at home.Only 100 more days of work!!!!!!",,Wild,"Dec 21, Sun",0
Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/479769,"Planning is beginning in earnest now. I finally figured out how to get to Amicalola Falls State Park from my home in Western NY. I'll fly into Atlanta airport on April 6th with a mostly empty backpack containing only my trekking poles and sleeping pad (things that won't fit into the 16""x16""x16"" box that I will be shipping ahead with everything else). I'll carry the backpack as carry-on luggage so no chance it will get lost - I've done this before and it works well - fits into the overhead compartments. At the Atlanta airport I can pick up the MARTA Rail Transit system and take the Red Line all the way north to the end of the line at North Springs. There the fine folks from the Hiker Hostel in Dahlonega will pick me up and shuttle me to the hostel, reunite me with my hiking gear, put me up for the night, feed me in the morning, then shuttle me to Amicalola Falls on April 7th. So this nails down my start date - it was floating around a bit till now. I'll be purchasing my ticket in the next couple of days - looks like the lowest Southwest fare is about $172. I just need to find out what time I need to be at North Springs before I get my ticket.I'm tentatively thinking of 8 mail drops (Hot Springs NC, Damascus VA, Waynesboro VA, Harpers Ferry WV, Duncannon PA, Salisbury CT, Hanover NH, and Caratuck, Me). I haven't nailed down what will be in them yet other than fresh socks, vitamins, some food, fresh boots (but already broken in), and other stuff. I could probably get by without the boxes, but I want to plan them ahead since I know there are things I will need that I haven't anticipated and I want to have a way for my wife to get them to me. So the contents won't be nailed down until about 2 weeks before I get the boxes.",,3 Months,"Jan 03, Sat",0
Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/480312,"I've added up the weights of all the stuff I will be starting with down at Springer - it's about 41 pounds including 2 quarts of water (4 pounds) and 8 pounds of food (2 pounds per day for 4 days to get to Neels Gap). This is about 3 pounds more than I was hoping for - so I started looking for things to cut. So why do I carry two sleeping pads - a long Thermarest Ridgerest (19oz) and the Big Agnes large AirCore mattress (31 oz). Well, I found out last night when I tried to sleep outside in the tent (on snow with temps about 32 deg) without the Ridgerest. I was warm except where I was laying on the Big Agnes. The ground was sucking heat from me like the Big Agnes wasn't even there. After 3 hours I retreated to the house - no point in losing any more sleep when I had already learned what I needed to learn. The Big Agnes has an R value of 1. The Thermarest has an R value of 2.6, so if they are used together (R value of 3.6), I would lose only about 1/4 of the heat that I was losing with just the Big Agnes alone. On some of my section hikes I've tried sleeping using the Ridgerest by itself - that's not an option. I'll try the combo in the cold next weekend to verify that is good enough. I can't think of anything else to cut - so at this point it looks like I'll be starting with a 41 pound pack.The gear we select is always a compromise between weight and comfort/convenience. If someone were to analyze my pack, they would come to the rightful conclusion that I have generally veered in the direction of comfort/convenience (Jetfoil, the large Big Agnes pad, MSR Miniworks filter, etc). There are lighter choices for all of these (alcohol stove, small closed foam pad, AquaMira drops, etc) but I've come to the realization that I am more likely to complete this hike if I can sleep well at night, drink lots of clean water, and not burn myself by spilling burning alcohol on myself. Others will find a different route to success.

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/481437,"Does everyone have doubts about the wisdom of their thru hike attempt? I wonder if my 62 year old knees, bones, feet, and tendons can take the abuse, and I wonder if I realize what a 5-6 month long hike really means. My sibs who are betting my sister ""No Spring Chicken"" will get further than me [friendly family rivalry] will see these as confirmation that they are backing the right horse. The only way to answer these questions is to head to Springer in early April. I like the bets…I hate to lose, so it’s just another incentive, however small, encouraging me to persevere when the going gets tough.I've started looking at the hike differently yet again. I had, perhaps, subconsciously, looked at it as just a longer version of the section hikes I've been doing for 11 years. But that's not how I see it now as it draws closer. A section hike is a vacation from work for a week or so.   I'm always sorry to see the section hike coming to an end while I'm doing it, but at the end of the week I'm back at work and life returns to normal. This upcoming thru-hike is not a vacation – it’s an expedition, and life won’t return to normal after a week or so. Like the expeditions of old, where you packed your steamer trunks, caught a boat to Africa, hired guides and porters, etc, an AT thru-hike requires a lot of planning, which I'm not particularly good at. Youthful hikers have a lot of resiliency which gets them through rough spots. Planners have their plans (A and B) and contingency plans (C, D, and E) which do the same. I'm somewhere in between. The solution is to get the final planning completed as best I can, I think, and then just let things flow from there. I always think of myself as a realist (who doesn't?), so I know that the odds of being one of the 80% who don't make it to Katahdin are pretty good, but I'm also pretty sure that the only things that will get me off the trail will be a serious injury, illness, or family emergency. My sister Spyder (one of them betting against me) says that my lack of certainty that I'll be one of the 20-25% who make it dooms me to failure, but then again she believes in psychics and mediums so.....Thanks to all who leave notes in my guest book. I'll probably meet some of you in the coming months, the others will help me keep focused on the journey.“Always remember, it’s simply not an adventure worth telling if there aren’t any dragons.”",,About 1 1/2 Months,"Feb 13, Fri",0
Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/482422,"I’ll have 2 brothers and 2 sisters out on the AT this summer at the same time I’ll be doing the AT. Cotton and Spyder will be section hiking in the Whites in July, No Spring Chicken (NSC) will be thru-hiking (but starting earlier than me) and will be joined by brother Chuck (no trail name yet) in the GSMNP. Could this be a record of some sort – 5 adult sibs on the trail in the same year? I’ve wondered about how the trail pulls some to it, but not others who are equally capable in terms of opportunity, physical ability, and awareness of the AT. For those of you old enough to remember the 1977 movie “Close Encounters of the Third Kind”, it reminds me of how the Dreyfuss character is drawn to Devils Tower in Wyoming. Like his wife (Terri Garr) in that movie, those who don’t feel the pull think that those who do are suffering from some sort of mental illness. Yet compared to other famous expeditions (I’m thinking here of Lewis and Clark’s exploration of the Louisiana Purchase or maybe Dr. Livingston’s journeys into Africa in the mid-1800s, or even the tens of thousands of Americans who populated the wagon trains headed west), our expedition is short, safe, comfortable, and predictable. With the cold winter we’re having that extends down to Georgia and North Carolina, it seems likely that many of those planning an early March start might re-think their plans and move their start date back. Some may not have that option, but it seems as though most might. I’m not planning on starting until April 7th and I thought that this date might result in a less crowded trail when I start. That might not be the case now, which is fine with me. I didn’t delay my start because of a fear of a crowded trail – it was more of a desire to miss the worst of the cold temperatures. This desire stems from my section hikes in August in the GSMNP where even in the middle of summer the evenings and nights got quite cool, sometimes even cold at the higher elevation where we were hiking. Even during the days when it was a humid 90 degrees in the cities east and west of the trail, it was just in the comfortable 70s up above 5000 feet and in the 40s or lower at night. I’m sure I have adequately prepared for April and May in the GSMNP, but if necessary I will wear all my clothes at night to keep warm. I do not sleep well when cold.My wife gave me a Fitbit Charge for Christmas. It keeps track of how many steps (and miles) I walk each day - a high-tech pedometer. What makes it unique is that it logs all this on the computer at home even when I’m 1000+ miles away so that anyone can see how far I’ve walked on any given day. It has helped me keep track of the training I’ve done in prep for my upcoming adventure and I think it will be very interesting to see how many steps I take each day while on the trail and if it really takes 5,000,000 to reach Maine. It works by monitoring arm motion – I haven’t verified that it will continue to work while I’m using trekking poles, but I believe it will. It should be a big help in estimating how far ahead the next shelter is. If it turns out to be too much of a distraction, I’ll just send it back to home base at the same time I send back my cold weather clothes.",,1 Month!!!,"Feb 28, Sat",0
Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/485754,"I'm down to one week - flying down to Atlanta next Monday (April 6th). I am in turns excited, then apprehensive (do I have the right gear, clothes, food, plan, etc). When I get apprehensive, I can easily turn that back into excitement by reminding myself that this hike will be my new occupation for the next 6 months. I understand the pre-hike jitters are pretty common - they go away once the journey begins. My last day of work is Tuesday (although not much work will get done - mainly an exit interview and saying goodbye). The group really surprised me on Friday - I thought I was going to lunch with just 2 friends but when we got to the restaurant the entire group was there - a complete and utter surprise. Thanks to all for coming - I was blown away, and I still can't believe I was so out of the loop that I didn't see this coming. I should have been able to put together the few dots I saw, but didn't. This is the first time I've made a planned exit from an engineering position (leaving the Marines doesn't count). The other two times were involuntary - the companies were shrinking and my services were no longer needed. There were no goodbye lunches accompanying those - quite a difference. I will miss my former coworkers as I move on to my next occupation (hiker extraordinaire).About gear - it's really easy to get caught up in the latest ultralight craze. It's actually a type of materialism that I'm trying to get away from on this hike. I've done 800 miles of the AT on section hikes and the equipment that I used on those was perfectly adequate. I've modified some items and added others since I'll be hiking alone, however. I added a bite valve and suction tube to my Nalgene bottle so that I can drink from it without de-packing (why hasn't Nalgene offered this as an accessory?). I've devised a method of hanging my pack on any tree even if it has no branches or branch stubs, necessary since my tent doesn't don't have a vestibule.   And I am bringing a very lightweight ripstop nylon tarp with eyelets and 24' attachment strings (5ft x 10ft - total weight about 4 oz) so that I can create a rain-free area to set up and take down my tent in a storm. I haven't had a chance to test it yet - it it doesn't work out it will be one of the first things I'll drop from my pack. White blaze.net says that I should learn how to set the tent up in the rain without everything getting wet - well good luck with that - let me know when you learn that secret. I've been following a good number of the AT class of 2015 who have started mid-March. The weather hasn't been that kind to them and they've needed to take a number of unplanned zeros as a result. The bottom line for me is that I won't be as far behind them as I thought, maybe only about 100 miles or so.My next post will probably be from the Hiker Hostel at Dahlonega on next Monday evening. I know these prep posts are a little mundane - I hope that they improve once the adventure begins.""You're not too old and it's not too late""",,1 Week!!!,"Mar 29, Sun",0

Total distance today for today is 9.1 including the backtrack to the summit where that picture was taken. The 8.1 miles to the Hawk Mtn Shelter was harder than expected. Lots of people and tents at the shelter - maybe 30-35. We all started in drizzle, but it cleared up by early afternoon. At some points, it was actually hot today.

I tried to stay hydrated, but I don't think I succeeded. I tried to eat a lot, but didn't succeed at that either. I arrived at the shelter completely wiped out. The same 35 hikers are here - one third thruhikers and the rest section hiking. I am moving in a hiker bubble-don't know anyone's name. After the section hikers depart, there will be time for that.

This has always been a fear of mine - getting sick right before a backpacking trip. And now it's happened!!! So, after hiking about 5.5 miles today and arriving at Woody Gap, someone suggested staying the night at a hostel - avoiding the rain tonight, getting a shower (yeah), getting clothes laundered, and getting a good nights sleep: a win win win win situation. And I need a win - yesterday I lathered up with sunblock only to find out after the fact that it was really mosquito repellent. Then this morning, I found out that I left all my TP (toilet paper) at Hawk Mountain Shelter. Tomorrow, I will be slack packing 10 miles to the outfitter at Neels Gap. The hostel here will deliver my pack to Neels Gap - all I need to carry is food and water for the day. They also will go through my pack and tell me what I'm carrying that I really don't need. They typically take 5 pounds out of someone's pack. Going from 40 to 35 pounds sounds good to me!","Gooch Mountain Shelter

My ride back to Woody Gap was late so Evenflow and I went out to the road, stuck out our thumbs and immediately got a ride. I later found out that the others followed our example. I hiked in the rain early on. I was bummed because I was sure I had lost my phone charger - my iPhone is my link with home. The rain let up and before I knew it, I was at the top of Blood Mtn. where there is a historical stone shelter. Then down to Neels Gap. Both the cabins and the hostel were full, so I resupplied and headed up the hill 1.3 mile to a camping location for the night.

Getting to sleep is a problem, which I hope gets resolved soon. Part of the problem is this damn head cold. Cold and windy outside the tent, but it's warm inside my sleeping bag. Good news - I found my iPhone charger. Bad news - I seem to have lost my spoon and trail guide, both essential items. Losing things all the time is very frustrating. I can't go on without a spoon and a guide. So I hiked back to Neels Gap to get a cabin, give my cold a chance to get better, and most importantly, figure out why I keep losing things. I got a great cabin and disassembled my pack, whereupon I found my spoon and guide book! The goal now is to get a good night's sleep in the cabin. I also figured out where everything should be stored in my pack, so maybe I can avoid these ""missing items"" episodes that are so frustrating.

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/488597,"Day 8 - I slept well last night. There was amazingly little snoring in the shelter. I borrowed some water from Stash, a 72 yr old section hiker. She has a bad hip-it went bad this week - so she's having problems. Her sharing water allowed me the luxury of not having to put on my shoes, and cold, wet clothes and walking 100 yards in the rain to the spring. Lesson learned - get your water before getting into your warm, dry camp clothes! Yesterday, I was worried about getting hypothermia. The rain stopped this morning and for the rest of the day the weather was great. I hiked down to Unicoi Gap with Zen, the guy who created the website 'ATWeather.org'. He's an AT 'god'. We had a good discussion about solar panels, electric cars, Kodak, life in Brooklyn, etc. He took a shuttle to Hiawassee with 3 others with whom he is sharing a room. After trying for 5 minutes to hitchhike into Hiawassee, I met two hikers (Notes and Float) who were going to Tray Mountain Shelter today & then on to the Top of Georgia Hostel. That sounded like a good plan to me. They invited me to hike with them and we had a good time comparing lives, making the hike to the shelter go by quickly. I've taken 28,500 Fitbit steps today and 200,000 in the last 7 days. I have finally beat my sister Spyder! I expect some exciting thunderstorms tonight and will be disappointed if they fail to appear.","Blue Mountain Shelter

I thought this would be the day I take down my tent in the rain, but no, the rain stopped long enough to break camp and pack up. Then the rain started again. Today I hiked with only with Notes as Float headed out early. Notes is a hard core 34 yr. old Christian. In that regard, we have little to talk about. I'm the same age as her dad. You'd think we'd not have much in common, but the miles pass much more quickly when you have someone to talk to. For today's hike, it was going to be 11 miles to the Top of Georgia Hostel. It rained all day and took 7 hours to cover that distance. One big 900 foot up, then lots of smaller ups & downs, while all the time slipping and sliding in the Georgia mud. I pulled into the hostel at 4:00 pm - too late to catch the shuttle into Hiawassee. So I resupplied here at the hostel where everything seems overpriced - $42 for 4 days to get me to Franklin, NC. There's a 20-40 % chance of rain tomorrow-Yeaaaa. I found out that this area is a temperate rain forest. It's normal to have a week of rain this time of year. I had pizza for dinner at the hostel - got my laundry done - took a shower - and I'll get an all you can eat breakfast in the morning. I think I have already lost 7-8 pounds, so I plan to pig out! Ten-Hut, Pumpkin, Float, 4-Finger, Blake, Dutchy, Notes and many more are here tonight. Tomorrow on to Muskrat Creek Shelter and into NC.","Tray Mountain Shelter

Today's task is a 12 mile hike to Muskrat Creek Shelter; the first shelter in NC. I hiked some with Cheerio and passed Ten-Hut and Pumpkin as well as several others that are becoming part of my hiker bubble. I crossed the GA/NC line and almost made it to the shelter before the rain started. It's supposed to be 10 degrees warmer tomorrow - so we are all excited. This shelter is somewhat of a slum, only sleeps 6, even when packed in like sardines. To satisfy some of my extended family members, I'll take a turn toward the philosophical today. So, what do I hope to get from this hike? There are many things, but I'll discuss just one today. I've found myself getting easily irritated by small stuff: misplaced shoes, no clean shorts, simple questions from my wife, etc.... There is a saying ""Don't sweat the small stuff "" and its corollary ""It's all small stuff "". Because life on the AT requires constant adjustment and re-adjustment to your plans - dealing with adverse weather, a wet tent, noisy shelter mates, a loss of privacy, mice, lost items, etc.-well- the list is almost endless! If I can learn to adapt/adjust/ co-exist with these annoyances, then the issues I'll need to deal with after the AT may indeed seem like 'small stuff'. If I can't learn to deal with this AT stuff, then I won't last long out here. My goal is to not become a crotchety old man that no one wants to be around!!!","Top of Georgia Hostel & Hiking Center

It started raining shortly after I crested Standing Indian Mtn, which was a 1400 ft. climb. I hiked alone today except for the last 3.2 miles when I met up with Judy, a recently laid off 50 yr. old Lowe's executive. I decided to tent at Carter Gap instead of sleep in the shelter there. There have been too many mice issues. Mice chewing through tents, into food bags and chewing up clothes. Notes, Blake, Andy (he's hiking with a guitar) and many others are at this shelter and we're all tired of the rain. The forecast for tomorrow: rain. The forecast for the day after that: heavy rain.

I packed up quickly before it started again, but then the sun made an appearance and suddenly hiking was fun again. About 4 miles into the day's hike, at Mooney Gap, a hiking club from Georgia had set up some tables and were handing out chili dogs, potato salad, chips, candy bars, etc. Trail magic!!! I really pigged out. That was a good thing because immediately following was the ascent up Mt. Albert. This was by far the most difficult climb to date and it was said that this type of climb is what New Hampshire is like. There's a neat fire tower at the top of Albert Mountain. The remaining 8 miles today were pretty uneventful. The plan is to hike about 3 miles in the rain tomorrow and catch the 9 am shuttle into Franklin, NC for a food resupply, a shower, and some much desired restaurant food. So far I am holding up better than most; no blisters, knees are holding up well, etc. Sleeping could be better, crapping could be more regular, cell service could be better, but all in all, things are going pretty well.

I debated whether to catch the 9:00 am shuttle to Franklin or hike 3.8 miles to Winding Stair Gap and then catch the 11:00 am shuttle from there. To keep moving forward on the trail - Leo, Notes, and I decided on the latter course of action. We arrived at Winding Stair Gap around 10:30 am - wet and cold. Fortunately, we only waited a couple of minutes before a lady showed up and offered us wet, dirty hikers a ride into town! Two motels in Franklin, NC cater to hikers. By noon, hiker parties were in full swing at both of them. They resembled college frat parties with lots of smoking and imbibing. None of us were into that. After cleaning up, we went to the local outfitter and Walmart to resupply, then on to Mulligan's Restaurant for dinner and a Guiness. All of my equipment is now dry - including my shoes. I expect to be back on the trail before noon tomorrow. Incidentally, as I summited Mt. Albert yesterday, I crossed the 100 mile mark on my journey! The weather looks promising for the next 3 days.

They needed to stay in town to pick up their mail drops and visit the outfitter that was closed yesterday. I started out alone, but soon met up with Mama Sunshine and walked with her for about 4 miles. Although the day started sunny, a thunderstorm popped up, sending hail and an occasional lightening bolt down upon us. It quickly passed and the remainder of the day was partly cloudy, windy, and cold. I got to Wayah Bald, took pictures, then headed to the shelter. It will be a cold, windy night tonight.

It seems like a lot longer than that, but only 19 days ago I was still sitting at my desk at work. So here's a shout-out to my friends and co-workers at Rotork - I haven't forgotten about you! Last night, it was COLD and WINDY in the Wayah Bald Shelter. I had to wear my down jacket, long johns, long sleeve shirt, hat, and socks inside my 20F sleeping bag to try to stay warm. The shelter is up around 5000 ft., so the air up there is about 20 degrees colder than the air at a lower elevation. I may need to get a warmer bag at the NOC Outfitter tomorrow. Today's goal was to get to the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) - 16.5 miles from Wayah Bald Shelter. This would be my longest day yet. It was difficult to get out of the sleeping bag because it was so cold. Eventually I did, ate some oatmeal, and started down the trail. About 9 hours later, I stumbled into the NOC. I got a space in the 'base camp' bunkhouse there and had pizza for dinner. Tomorrow I'll start the two day trek to Fontana Lake, which is at the southern end of the Great Smokey Mountain National Park (GSMNP). Incidentally, I have not met any thru-hikers as old or older than me. Evenflow was a 66 year old section hiker going from Springer to Hot Springs TN, but he dropped out 4 days ago because of knee issues. I thought there would be more hikers my age. I have a bit of a problem relating to kids in their 20's who are all about partying.","Wayah Shelter

I packed up and headed over to the outfitter to get some Jetboil fuel and to check out the sleeping bags since my old one hasn't been doing the job of keeping me warm at night. The thought of coffee pulled me into the restaurant instead. There I joined some of my fellow hikers and ordered a second breakfast of bacon and eggs and coffee. Then I completed my original task of getting a new sleeping bag ($269) and mailed the old one home. My goal for today was Sassafras Gap Shelter, only 7 miles up the trail, but with an elevation gain of about 3700 feet. I must be getting my trail legs since I made it to the shelter in about 5 hours, faster than the 6.5 hours I had estimated. On the way up, I was passed by Subman, a hiker I had been following on Trailjournals.com. He had originally started his hike on January 1st and had made it most of the way through the Smokies before being thwarted by deep snow and very low temps. He was on missile subs in the navy - hence his trail name. When I got to the shelter, he was there. A group of about 10 kids (1 adult), some of whom gave the distinct impression they were very tired of this whole hiking business, were also there. Subman suggested that we go an extra mile or so and camp on Cheoah Bald, the mountain peak above the gap. I had decided that I needed to have a bias towards action when faced with indecision (i.e. Should I stop or should I go?). If I didn't have a good reason to stop, then the default decision should be to keep going. So I am now at the Bald, in my tent, listening to it rain outside, and doing the one finger hunt & peck on my iPhone keyboard.","Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC)

It rained sporadically with a bit of thunder and lightning thrown in; the temperature dropped through the night. By morning, the rain drops on my tent had frozen and still the wind did not stop. 30 degrees and no wind is okay, but getting out of a warm tent into a howling 30 degree wind just stinks. But it had to be done. My goal for the day was Cody Gap, about 10 miles north. When I arrived there, the wind was blowing hard and the forecast was for a low in the 30's. I did NOT want to go through that again. I pushed on to Cable Gap Shelter hoping for better conditions. It appears as if I have lucked out since there is no wind here. On the way here, there were several views of Fontana - the goal for tomorrow. My plan now is to take a NERO (low mile day) tomorrow, which will get me to the Fontana 'Hilton' aka Fontana Dam Shelter (Google it). On Saturday, I'll take a ZERO (no miles) day to placate my complaining feet, which have threatened to go on strike.

I had a good connection with Star Stuff as we are both Carl Sagan fans (of the old Cosmos TV show from the early 80's). Since today was going to be a low mileage day, I wasn't too concerned about getting an early start. About 1:00 pm, I rolled into the Fontana 'Hilton' and claimed a spot - the shelter holds at least 24 hikers. A little while later, Subman rolls in - I couldn't understand this because he should have beaten me here. It turns out he made a detour to the marina where they had beer and snacks! It was a mile back to the marina, but after setting up camp at the 'Hilton', I was so ready for refreshment. Subman and I backtracked a mile and had ourselves a good ole happy hour. Trail Chef's wife picked us up at the bar and gave us a ride back to the shelter, which was a good thing since I'm not sure I could have walked the 1.1 miles back. Trail Chef and Subman are heading into the Smokies tomorrow, while I take a zero day. I hope I catch up with them - they will be traveling slowly since Trail Chef has knee issues. There are a lot of folks from Germany on the trail this year and several of them are in this shelter tonight. Apparently German TV had a program about the AT that inspired them.

Because of rain, about 40 hikers tried to cram in. Twice during the night guys fell from the upper level, waking everyone up. About every half hour, someone needed to stumble outside to pee. In spite of that, I slept pretty well. Today is my zero day at the Hike Inn. I picked up my two packages from my lovely wife, had a nice hot shower and repacked my pack with food for the next 6-7 days. I weighed my pack after this and it came in at about 34 pounds, less than it feels like. I also weighed myself - I've lost about 17 pounds already. I really need to slow that down or I'll be a skeleton by the time I meet up with my family in June. Tomorrow I'll be climbing 2700 feet to Mollies Ridge Shelter-my first stop in the Great Smokey Mountains National Park (GSMNP). There's a 60% chance of rain, but I've just got to work through those things. The park is 67 miles long with no resupply without going into Gatlinburg - hence the 6-7 days of food. Next resupply is at Standing Bear Farm Hostel at the northern terminus of the GSMNP.

Gatlinburg is a tourist town-home to ""Dollywood"", lots of hotels, restaurants, and garish tourist traps. There is a good supermarket here though, where the trick is to get their 'savers card', which does save you about 30% off their list price. The tourists seldom get or have the card and pay inflated prices. I stayed at the Grand Prix Motel, a favorite of hikers. On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give it about 1.5.

The views from there are amazing and there was music too. It was hard to stop taking pictures of the views, the sunset, and the people there. Most camped on top, but it was too breezy there for me. I pitched my tent a couple hundred yards down from the peak, ate dinner, then went back up and rejoined the party. I'm only about 20 miles from Hot Springs, so I'll probably roll into there soon.

I was planning on stopping today at Deer Mountain Park Shelter, just a few miles before Hot Springs, but I made it to that shelter by 3:50 pm. I hiked some today with Pole Dancer-formerly known as Judy. I was a bit annoyed by a women hiker at one of the shelters I passed. She said something like ""doesn't that defeat the purpose of the hike"" when I mentioned doing a long day to get to Hot Springs. There are a million reasons people do this hike - who is she to say that this long day defeats my purpose. Kind of judgmental on her part, I think, but I'm working on tuning out that sort of person.   I decided to keep going another 3.2 miles to Hot Springs so I could get a large restaurant meal, a bed to sleep on, my laundry done, take a shower, and get a connection to home.

Trail towns (Hot Springs in particular) have restaurants, micro-breweries, beds, comfortable or historic hostels, laundries, showers, and outfitters, all singing to the hiker ""take a zero; take 2 zeros"". And almost all hikers give in to the lure. Not intrepid hiker Pockets, but I was sorely tempted. Laughing Heart Hostel was a great place to stay and I highly recommend it to all hikers. I got a late start today because I needed to resupply and the stores were all closed Sunday evening when I got to town. After a double breakfast on Monday (got to get that calorie intake up), I hit the Dollar General and the outfitter and took the goods back to Laughing Heart and started packing up. The result is that I didn't get out of there until about 11:00 AM. Then I began the most difficult 11 miles of the hike so far - 11 miles of mostly steep up, in 80 degree temps, with a pack holding 6 days of food, and not a lot of water sources because of how dry it has been. I hiked a while with Cookie. She was out of water on the climb out of Hot Springs and was pretty dehydrated so I gave her most of the water I had. She needed it more than I did. I had made a point of drinking a lot of water before leaving Hot Springs. Luckily, we came to a spring shortly after that and all water worries ended. I reached Spring Mt.

This is all fine and good until I suffer a mechanical breakdown - then all bets are off. I was planning a high mileage day today so that I would arrive @ Erwin early tomorrow. About 2 miles into the hike, I got a sudden, sharp pain on the top right side of my right foot - the kind of pain that made it difficult to walk. I think it's a shin - splint type of injury but located in the tendons and muscles that allow me to lift my small toes. Fortunately, I have compression socks with me (I almost sent them home earlier) and lots of vitamin I (Ibuprofen). Between the two of them, they fixed me up enough that I easily made the next shelter about 10 miles up the path. I was planning to go a considerable distance further, but prudence suggests I give my foot some rest. What this means, though, is that tomorrow will be a 16 mile day to get to Erwin instead of the 11 miles I had planned. But it's mostly downhill so if the foot holds up, it will be doable. Depending on how I feel in Erwin, I may or not take a zero for some general rehabilitation. I mentioned 'Damascus Trail Days' yesterday. By way of explanation, think of Rio during Mardi Gras except it's Damascus, not Rio, and Trail Days, not Mardi Gras. A more apt comparison might be when the bikers swarm into Sturgis. The town of Damascus (population 800) is overrun with about 10,000 past and present AT hikers.","Hogback Ridge Shelter

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/493537,"Day 32 - If the weather is good, an AT hiker walks. Yesterday a thunderstorm arrived just as I walked up to the Big Bald Shelter - at about 2 in the afternoon. These things often pop up and an hour or 2 later the weather is fine again. But in this case, the group I was hiking with and I decided at 2:15 that we were done for the day. We set up our sleeping gear in the shelter and took a nap. About an hour and a half later, I awoke to find the sun shining. I should have packed up and moved on but it is mentally difficult to change your mind once the decision has been made to settle in. The thing is, lots of other hikers stopped to eat or to check the shelter register, then continued on. At 3:30, there is still about 5 hours of daylight left - good for at least 6 miles of walking. I was a little worried about my foot, but I still felt a little like a slacker for just laying around for those 5 hours. AT hikers spend far more time sleeping than the average person, typically falling asleep around 8:30 pm and awaking around 6:30 am - about 10 hours of sleep. We really don't need to quit hiking before 6:30 or 7 pm. The compression sock and ibuprofen seem to be working their magic on my foot. Today I rarely thought about it as I completed the 16+ miles from Big Bald Shelter to Uncle Johnny's in Erwin. What bothered me more was the heat, especially during the climbs. Johnny's shuttled us to restaurants for dinner (I had another huge Mexican meal and then to Walmart for resupply). I don't think I'm going to take a zero tomorrow - not sure what the point of it would be. Thanks for all of your comments on Trailjournals; I read them whenever I have wifi available. They are encouraging!!","Bald Mountain Shelter

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/493754,"Day 33 - The decision to not take a zero at Johnny's was a good one. I would have gone stir-crazy sitting around Erwin for a whole day. I caught the 9:00 am shuttle into town for breakfast and had a large order of eggs and lots of coffee at the Huddle House and finally got back into the woods around 11:30. It was a relief to be back walking again: town is now an alien place and the woods are the normal environment. I planned on having a low miles day thinking that the climb out of Erwin in the mid-day heat would be difficult. But the climb wasn't that hard and the woods were cool from the previous day's rain. I ended up going further than planned - 12.2 miles to a camping spot with a water supply - an essential for cooking dinner. Spyder and Cotton - check out the 'Knorr Sides' @ a grocery store along with single tuna packs by Starkist or Bumblebee. Mixing these together in boiling water with some olive oil makes a great, easy to fix meal with lots of variety and a lot lower cost than that Mountain House stuff. I'm also eating soft tortillas with peanut butter or cheese for lunch - the combo provides lots of calories and is a good change-up from candy or protein type bars. Brother Tom (an actual Catholic brother) provided some trail magic at one of the gaps - he's been doing that for 7 weeks straight. My foot continues to improve and at this point is no longer an impediment to hiking. Tomorrow might be another 20 mile day since the terrain looks fairly easy and we (Zipper and I) are trying to make Trail Days in Damascus by the 15th or 16th. Many thanks to my buddy Steve for fixing my LEAF (electric car) - that is one less thing to worry about. Until tomorrow......","Uncle Johnny's Hostel-Erwin, Tn.

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/493944,"Day 34 - The small camping spot I stayed at last night was right beside a gravel road that provides access to Beauty Spot. Being that last night was a weekend night and Beauty Spot is evidently a major make-out location, there were music blasting pickup trucks filled with intoxicated young folks driving up and down the gravel road until well after midnight. So sleep was hard to come by. Note to self: pick a camping spot far from roads in the future. We (Sonny, Zipper aka Zippy, and I) had ambitious plans for today - a 20 mile day ending at a camping spot halfway up Roan Mountain. We got a good start on it, covering 9 miles by noon, but there was word about a hostel 3 miles ahead that had pizza and cold drinks! Given that it was a hot day with the threat of thunderstorms - spontaneous and easily tempted hikers that we are - decided a change in plans was in order and that a 12.2 mile day was certainly respectable enough. Thus we ended up at the Greasy Creek Friendly Hostel run by Connie, an eccentric but endearing woman who has rules posted all around the hostel. Example - Rule number 8: ""Do not pee in the shower - if you do you will make me cry"". After showering, Connie drove us into Erwin to the same restaurant we had just eaten at 2 days ago! Anyway, it turned out to be a very interesting stay at a very unusual place that we will long remember. My sister NSC stayed here recently and gave the place a 'thumbs down'. I guess that's just an indication of how different people can have a different perception of a place. There's pics of Greasy Creek Friendly Hostel on my photos page.

Zipper ordered a medium calzone after a lengthy discussion with our waitress about just how big a medium calzone would be. When it came, it was huge. Although Zipper made a valiant attempt, he could eat only about a third of it - even with hiker hunger and all. The waitress kidded him about it; saying she had seen 12 year olds eat more than that. It was at that point Zipper was, with great fanfare there in the restaurant, renamed Zippy. He will need to perform some amazing feat of hiking to regain his manhood. On a more serious note though, he seems to have come down with some type of stomach thing, a norovirus or giardia or something, which forced him to remain behind at the Greasy Creek Friendly Hostel today. Ah, a new text update - it appears it was just the 1/2 gal of chocolate milk he drank this morning that caused his distress! He's back on the trail! The big task today was to get up and over Roan Mountain, a 2200 ft. climb up to 6200 feet. The climb turned out to be somewhat anticlimactic as the high temp for today was 67 and there was a cooling breeze all the way up. The big excitement was the thunderstorm that chased me down the mountain and finally caught me. I was already wearing my rain gear and was not too concerned about getting wet, but the path exited the woods to a parking lot and then onto a bald. I would be the tallest thing around - not a good thing in a thunderstorm! Just as I hunkered down in the woods, another hiker said there was a shelter at the parking lot. The shelter turned out to be a public bathroom! And that's how I ended up in a bathroom with 7 other hikers waiting out a storm. I didn't make it to Overmountain Shelter (a converted barn) as planned because of the thunderstorm. Instead I spent the night at Stan Murray Shelter with 2 other hikers - Gordon Gekko and Squirrel.","Greasy Creek Friendly Hostel

Today I had to climb over an extensive series of balds that were mostly fogged in and very windy. Balds are ok in good weather though I prefer the woods because they tend to be cooler and the path tends to be in better shape. While walking over one of the balds, I aggravated the injury to my right foot that had been recovering nicely. The pain extended into my shin as if I had a shin splint injury like my sister No Spring Chicken had. I recalled that she used a shin compression sleeve to treat her shin splints, so I took my second compression sock and pulled it up onto my shin. Surprisingly this seemed to do the trick and with the help of a couple of ibuprofen pills, I was able to continue hiking with little discomfort and made it to the campsite by the Elk River-where the sounds of rushing water and tree frogs guarantee me a good night's sleep. I'm camping here tonight with Goatsbeard, Ambush, Mantis, and a couple others whose names I can't recall now - it's a good group. I have resolved to eat more. I cannot continue to lose 5 pounds per week. This means I will need to eat about 1 pound more per day than I have been eating. The Kincora hostel is about 18 miles up the trail - that will be my goal for tomorrow and I will resupply there- making increasing my food intake a priority.","Stan Murray Shelter

Rest assured that when the opportunity once again arises, I will spare no expense in getting a very detailed photograph. I left the Elk River campsite around 8:00 AM and planned to end @ Kincora Hostel. The AT followed the Elk River for about a mile. It was indeed a very beautiful morning and setting. I was the second one out of the campsite (Goatsbeard was first), but was soon passed by Ambush, who I saw several more times during the day. While hiking, I changed my mind and decided to stay at the Black Bear Resort as they have a hiker bunkhouse and a resupply store.   In keeping with my decision to up my calorie intake, I need to get more food to get me to Damascus. The fact that they have pizza may have factored into the equation as well. The distance to both hostels was the same.  I expect to do about 18 miles tomorrow and again on Friday. That should get me to Damascus on Saturday, in time for some of the festivities.   I will probably miss the hiker parade and the hiker talent competition, which I would have won by designing a 480VAC electro-hydraulic actuator with accumulator on the spot.

I'm going to stop this weight loss even if it kills me. After breakfast, as I was talking to my wife on the phone, Katwalk - who hiked through the Smokies with my sister (NSC) and my brother, apparently now known as PQRST - came walking by and I introduced myself to her. What a surprise. Katwalk's also met a couple of my other sisters. Today's walk took me along Laurel Creek, which is well known in the area for it's waterfall 'Laurel Falls'. When section hiking the AT a couple of years ago, my brother Cotton, my sister Spyder and I had a great time swimming there. After Laurel Falls, it was up and over a mountain, then down to Watauga Lake and then a climb back up into the hills toward Vanderventer Shelter, where I'm staying tonight. I was expecting the trail to be mostly empty since most thru-hikers have jumped ahead to get to Damascus. In fact I expected Vandeventer Shelter to be empty but there were 8 section hikers (all related) here to keep me company.

""How do you expect us to get over the mountain""? I reply, ""Do you think a Sherpa is just going to come along and carry us over?"" Now there's a non-zero chance, maybe 1 in a billion, that a Sherpa will come along, throw me over his shoulder, and carry me over the mountain, but it's not something that I can count on. So I just have to convince my legs that they need to stop goofing off and get to work. Usually they can be convinced. Today was my longest day yet. I do NOT plan to be making a habit of 20+ mile days. I expected this shelter (Abingdon Gap) to be empty, but evidently it's a staging area for a mass assault on Damascus tomorrow and is currently overrun with young hikers. Some can not wait and are night hiking into town even as I type. My hike into Damascus for Trail Days 2015 will only be about 10 miles and I should be able to accomplish that by midday. With any luck, I'll be there in time to participate in the hiker parade. I promise to document the activities via photographs so that you, my readers, will feel like you're there.

The assault on Damascus started around 3:00 am as waves of hikers left their tents and the shelter and headed north past my tent- headlights ablaze. It greatly interrupted both my sleep and my nightly 3:15 am outing to empty my bladder. When I awoke at 6:15, the shelter area was mostly deserted. I was on my way by 7:15, hoping to get to Damascus by noon - in fact I rolled into town around 10:30 - 10 miles in 3 hours, a speed record - because the trail was so easy and my pack, with little food, was so light. At 3.5 miles from the town, right at the Virginia line, a small black bear ran across the trail about 60 ft in front of me, making a hell of a racket as it crashed through the woods. My first bear sighting at a place I would least expect it. Here's a summary of the highlights of the Saturday events at Trail Days: #1 - The hiker parade- AT hikers are grouped by year with the 2015 hikers bringing up the rear. The streets are lined with lots of kids (and some adults) with supersoakers who hose down the hikers as they pass. #2 - The hiker talent competition- Most of the entries were musical or stand-up comedians. No, I didn't enter.#3 - The equipment vendors- They were showing off their latest stuff and giving a lot of it away. I got my 10 year old trekking poles completely overhauled to the point where only about 20% of the original poles remain. They did this for free!#4 - Seeing fellow hikers- Most of them I hadn't seen for weeks, almost all of them are behind me and they had shuttled ahead for this event. #5- The hiker prom- I can't report on the hiker prom because I didn't go! My prom sweetie is back home in New York and today is our 28th anniversary!! I can say that a tie was required for guys @ the prom. The local thrift store was selling ties for a dollar, so lots of guys were walking around in hiking gear with a tie around their necks. #6-Hiker parties- I understand the parties in tent city extend into the wee hours of the morning. I finally met up with Subman, Trailchef, Zipper, Wildcat, Hanna, Beth, Mama Sunshine, Sonny, Karaoke, Not Swiss, Papa JC, Goatsbeard, and others I have hiked with over the past 6 weeks and it was fun to swap stories with all of them.

Trail Days pretty much ended yesterday aside from the drumming and wild shrieks from the pagan dancers prancing around the bonfire until 2:00 am this morning. In addition, every 15 minutes from 10:00 pm on, there was someone blowing a horn (not a car horn but instead the kind that is in an orchestra) and yelling ""It's time to sleep!!"".   Fortunately I had no problem sleeping through all this; the drums just lulled me back to sleep. When I woke up this morning, 'Tent City' had pretty much evaporated before my eyes. After breakfast, I, too, tore down my tent and decided to wait until tomorrow to leave town. This will be my 3rd zero day since hitting the trail - I think I've earned it. I'm staying at the Methodist Church Hostel tonight.

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/495588,"Day 42 - I heard a story today about Damascus Trail Days: There was a stoned hiker who tried to force one of the local police officers to smoke a bowl. He kept saying ""smoke this, pig"" while shoving his pipe at the policeman - who promptly locked him up for the night and confiscated his weed. I also heard about quite a few bear confrontations in the Watauga Lake area where the bears got several groups of hikers' food and could not be scared away. The hikers thought they were outside the ""Closed for Camping"" area but were actually still in it and had set up camp. Anyway... a small portion of today's hike was on the Virginia Creeper Trail (rails-to-trails). It was once used to haul timber out of the mountains of the western part of Virginia, but is now a 16+ miles long scenic downhill bicycle path that follows Laurel Creek down to Damascus. This is part of the AT section I hiked last year and everything is very familiar. I am looking forward to getting into parts of the AT I have not section hiked. Here at the shelter I ran into Gorp Gobbler and another 'Pockets' still wearing his tie from the hiker prom. Quite a few of the younger hikers seem to be skipping sections for one reason or another. I won't do that - the integrity of this endeavor is important to me. Everyone draws their own lines as to what constitutes a meaningful thru-hike for themselves, however. This hike is as much mental as it is physical and taking shortcuts, yellow blazing, blue-blazing or temporarily skipping sections takes a heavy toll on the mental aspect. By the end of tomorrow I hope to arrive at the south entrance of Grayson Highlands State Park.","Damascus Va.

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/496137,"Day 43 - There's maybe 4 main types of thruhikers on the AT: The young partiers, the young couples who hooked up on the trail (a lot of these are also partiers), the couples who started together, and the older hikers (of which I am one). The first two groups seem to have the highest attrition rate. They take a lot of zeros and tend to run out of money. The older hikers seem to have the next highest attrition rate, mostly due to injuries or other medical issues. The group that started as couples seems to have the lowest rate of dropouts. I'm back in the mountainous region of Virginia. I like that the terrain has kind of flattened out, but today I had a 2000 foot climb up Whitetop Mountain, then another climb up Mt. Rogers. I still don't like long steep climbs, but they don't bother me like they used to. Now they're something I just endure. Today was a 17+ mile hike to just inside the northern entrance to Grayson Highlands State Park. Also, I passed the 500 mile point just after entering Grayson Highlands! There are wild horses in this park and I saw a mare try to kick a hiker that got too close to her foal. Only a quick jump-back prevented the pony's rear hooves from breaking the hiker's ribs. I did take some pictures of them, but didn't get too close as you can see. Check out my photos page. The signs around Wise Shelter say tent camping is prohibited within the park, but that prohibition is being widely ignored tonight - there are about 8 tents scattered around the shelter. I haven't looked at the book to see where I'll be heading tomorrow - I'll worry about that in the morning.","Lost Mountain Shelter

For the most part though, the ponies left us alone. This has turned into one of the most enjoyable hiking days so far: beautiful weather with cool temps and a gentle breeze, beautiful woods and views, running into hiking friends (Goatsbeard, Wildcat, Mama Sunshine), and a great camping spot at the end of the day. Tomorrow should be an easy 13 mile day to Partnership Shelter. My siblings - Cotton, Snyder, and PQRST - will remember this as the shelter where you can take a shower and order pizza, which I will do! There was a great view of the Virginia mountains looking to the north today; I took a picture but distance photos have a way of not turning out as well as you think they will. Also, AT&T cell coverage is very bad in Southwestern Virginia and I have not been able to get either my journal updated or my photos sent out. I expect that will change shortly as I get closer to civilization - maybe at Partnership Shelter. One other note before I close for the day: I have decided I really prefer sleeping in my tent to sleeping in shelters. My tent has become my home away from home. It's comfortable, it's private, it keeps me dry, and if I need to find something (TP, headlamp, water bottle, etc.) in the middle of the night - I can find it without opening my eyes because I know exactly where everything is. All this in a package that weighs only 4 pounds! Everything in life should be so simple.","Wise Shelter

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/496272,"Day 45 - For the first time on the trail, I had to pack up while it was raining. In the past, the rain had always stopped, at least briefly, allowing a normal camp disassembly. Not so today - I have always dreaded this. Normally the tent is the first thing to go into my backpack. That means everything must be out of the tent so that it can be taken down and put into the bottom of my backpack. Of course, if it's raining, then everything else scattered around on the ground is going to get wet. But necessity is the mother of invention so I devised a plan for the tent to be the last item into the pack instead of the first. The folded tent poles cannot fit into the top of the pack so the answer was to pack the tent without the poles. That allows the tent and tent bag to take on any necessary shape since it would have no rigidity and can be packed last. All the other stuff can be put into the pack while I'm setting inside the tent nice and dry. Then the garbage bag liner in my backpack can be folded shut, the pack can be put out in the rain and the tent be quickly disassembled and stuffed into it's tent bag without poles and put into my backpack. The tent's very wet but everything else, including me, can stay dry. The tent's not in the dry part of my backpack anyway. Then I attach the tent poles to the outside of my backpack using available attachment points on my pack. I know this probably doesn't make sense to you, dear reader. I guess you had to be there, but this was a major breakthrough for me. So the day started wet, but within a couple of hours the clouds brightened and by afternoon the sun started to make an appearance. During this hike toward Partnership Shelter, my foot and shin started acting up again with sufficient severity that I became concerned about my ability to keep hiking. When I got to Partnership Shelter, I decided to take the morning shuttle into the town of Marion to have a doctor at the urgent care facility look at it. With that decision made, I pulled my wet tent out of my pack to let it dry. Along with just about everyone else at the shelter, I ordered pizza (delivery right to the shelter!). We all had a great little pizza party around the campfire before retiring for the night.","unnamed camp site

Now I thought urgent care facilities were open at least 12 hours a day since it's during waking hours that people injure themselves. But no, I guess that in Marion, VA people only injure themselves between the hours of 4 pm and 8 pm. After getting to the urgent care center about noon, I am turned away and told to return at 4 pm. Hikers generally walk everywhere we need to go in town: grocery store for resupply, drugstore for meds, restaurants for meals, laundry mat for clean clothes, urgent care facilities for injuries, etc., and these are hardly ever/never located near each other. So a return trip to someplace is really annoying. At 4 pm, I walk back to the urgent care faculty to see a doctor, who turns out to be an ob/gyn.   She tells me that right up front - I guess to lower my expectations about her ability to do sports medicine. But she consults her books and determines that I do indeed have a shin splint and she prints out exercises for me to do. In addition to that, she says I can take up to 12 ibuprofens (200mg) a day. Earlier today, my wife had tipped me off about KT tape, which I was able to buy at Walmart. So tomorrow, I will resume my walk north full of ibuprofen and swaddled in KT tape. It will be interesting to see how it goes. The plan is 11+ miles to the other side of Atkins, VA - which is where I believe Cotton, Spyder, PQRST and I started our section hike south last year.

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/496458,"Day 47 - Today was a slow 13 + mile day. I was protecting my foot/shin by being very careful where and how I was placing my right foot. My wife has arranged to have a shin compression sleeve sent to me 48 miles ahead (to Bland, VA) which should help heal my shin splint. Thanks go out to my sister, NSC, for helping with that. It should be there in 4 days, so I plan to only do about 12 miles a day until then. Another thing that should help is that since I've lost a little more than 30 pounds of weight and my pack weighs about 38 pounds, my legs/knees/feet/shins are only carrying about 6 - 8 pounds more than they did before I started hiking. I talked to one hiker today who had a problem with shin splints. He said he had to stop hiking for 9 day for his shins to heal. If necessary, I will do that, but only as a last resort. The hiker said that after 9 days his shins were as good as new. So, stay tuned.... As a result of this issue, I never once gave a thought to my pack, which is heavy with 5 - 6 days of food. The miles went by faster than expected as well. And now I am hiking a part of the trail I've never seen before. As I stopped for lunch at Chatfield Shelter, I realized that most of my 7 readers have never seen the artwork decorating AT shelters or have seen an AT shelter privy. So today's feature presentation is ""Shelter Art"" and ""A Look Inside a Shelter Privy"" (at this point, go to my photos page and look at today's pictures). A note about the privy - Virginia privies, so far anyway, are far better than the AT privies of North Carolina. I can only presume that Virginia takes a lot of pride in their privies.","Marion

Just before dark, another 10-12 hikers showed up. They had been chased away from the Relax Inn Motel, which has the reputation of being the worst hotel on the AT. Some rooms don't even have a shower or bath - they give you a bucket to use to wash up. The owner checked on some of the rooms and saw that some had 6 or more hikers in them. Those extra hikers were the ones that were evicted and showed up at the campsite. In the morning, I made a makeshift compression sleeve from the KT tape and that seemed to help my shin splint issue. Between that and Ibuprofen, my shin held up pretty well during the day's hike. Western Virginia is a picturesque place and the hiking has been fairly easy. I passed a signpost saying I've walked 1/4 of the AT distance from GA to ME. So, yeah!! Go me! By 6:00 pm, I reached my home for the night, a campground 1.2 miles past Knot Maul Knob Shelter. HikerFamily (2 parents & their 5 kids) are also camping here tonight - they're using 4 hammocks/tarps with two hammocks under each tarp in a bunk bed arrangement.

A lot of the AT water sources are at a trickle or already dry so I've been carrying far more than the one liter of water I usually carry.   Today I carried more than 4 liters, almost 9 pounds, which is very noticeable when hiking. The thing is, you can't allow yourself to run out. I ran out a couple of times in Tennessee when I wasn't paying attention to upcoming sources (or the lack thereof) and it can be scary. Dehydration is a serious thing. Fortunately, it looks like this area will be getting a fair amount a rain in the coming week - although that also means I'll be walking in it - not my favorite thing. I only wanted to do about 12 miles today to go easy on my shin. There were no camping areas after Chestnut Knob Shelter (@ 8 miles of today's hike) except the one I'm at (15.2 miles). The good thing is that between the ibuprofen and the compression sleeve I made out of KT tape strips, my shin feels pretty good. Not 'back to normal' good, but good enough that I probably won't need to take a break from hiking. In about 2 1/2 weeks, I'll be meeting up with my family & extended family for about 5 days for a reunion. I'll use that time to fatten up and rest my shin. Yogi Bear and his dog Lyla are at this campsite tonight with me. He's had shin splints that forced him off the trail for 9 days. There's a 20% chance of thunderstorms tonight (ATWeather.org). I really enjoy a good thunderstorm when I'm in my tent so maybe I'll get lucky.","Lynn Camp Creek campsite

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/497005,"Day 50 - There was a very light rain falling when I awoke this morning. It was the kind where you don't know whether to hurry and break camp before it gets worse or just go back to sleep and hope it stops by the time you wake up again. I elected to do the latter. When I re-awoke 45 minutes later, it had indeed stopped. The forecast called for a slight chance of rain with rainfall amounts not exceeding 0.1 to 0.25 inches except locally in thunderstorms. It sounded like great hiking weather - if it did rain, you wouldn't even bother putting on your rain gear because it would be just enough to cool you down. All was well for the first 5 miles; no rain, overcast, light breeze. At that point, I decided to go an additional 12 miles into Bland even with my defective shin. HikerFamily with their non-hiker friends were heading into Bland so I decided to tag along with them. Shortly after starting the additional 12 miles to Bland, it started to rain - gently, just enough to cool me off. HikerFamily and their friends started fumbling with their packs looking for their rain jackets. ""Rookies"", I thought, and kept walking, enjoying the cooling drops. It started raining a little harder, but it still felt good; then even harder. I was thoroughly wet, but still comfortable. Then all hell broke loose with thunder and torrential rain, and the rain got colder - uncomfortably but not dangerously cold (it's hard to get hypothermic when it's 68 degrees and you're hiking). Since I was completely soaked, putting on a rain jacket at this point would be pointless and just get my pack wet. After a couple of hours of this (I bet the rain total exceeded 1.5 inches), the rain did stop, the sun came out, the temperature rose and I dried out. This part of the trail was very easy, following old logging roads carved into the sides of the mountain. No steep climbs or drops, no rock scrambling; very pleasant hiking - once the rain stopped. I arrived at Rt 52 and hitched a ride into Bland. Fortunately, I had called the Big Walker Motel earlier (once I was sure I was going to make it) and made a reservation. When I arrived they were full - 16 of their 20 rooms rented to hikers. I did my laundry in the bathtub while taking a shower, hung it out to dry, then tried on my new shin sleeves. They feel good, so I'm optimistic. Rock Steady's here and we went down to the Dairy Queen for ice cream around 9 pm. I heard there's an AT hiker 2 day feast at a hostel in Pearisburg this coming weekend - just about the time I'll be walking into town. Sounds promising!","unnamed campsite

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/497673,"Day 51 - When I spend the night in a motel, I always get a late start the next day. The birds don't sing me awake at 5:30 am like they do in the woods, so I sleep in until about 7:00. Then when I'm finally all packed up, there's breakfast to consider. In the woods, it's oatmeal and I'm done in 10 minutes.   In towns, there are places with coffee and I linger there, always having 3 or 4 cups.   Bottom line for today - by the time I got a ride to the trailhead and started walking, it was already 10 am. That's why I only got in 13 miles today - in spite of the beautiful weather. If I want to get to the hiker feed in Pearisburg by Friday evening, tomorrow will need to be a big mile day. Pearisburg is still 33 miles away. So, early start tomorrow. The really good news for today is that the compression sleeve for my right leg shin splint seems to be working very well. My shin feels normal and it didn't bother me once all day. So a big thank you goes to my sister Pat and her son Dan, who recommended this 'treatment'. Also today, I reached another milestone - 600 miles!! I should reach 800 miles before I'm pulled off the trail for about 5 days in Mid-June to meet up with my family to head to our yearly family reunion. Thanks to all for your kind words on Trail Journals. I read them when I have wifi available.","Bland, VA

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/497674,"Day 52 - I got an early start this morning. It's obvious that I'm the first one on the trail. During the night, spiders lay lines of web between plants across the trail and the first 'lucky' hiker of the day collects them. Most are down low and don't bother me, but about 10% are at face level so my face collects them. Not my favorite thing, but I like early morning hiking, so I put up with it. It's about 30 miles into Pearisburg from where I camped last night. I want to get there early tomorrow for a resupply and to check on the hiker feed at the hostel there. The more miles I do today, the easier tomorrow will be. So that's how today I ended up doing my 4th 20+ mile day. I was planning to do 16 - 18 miles, but Rock Steady said he was heading to Wood's Hole Hostel. In the AT guide written by AWOL, he said Wood's Hole Hostel ""is not to be missed"" so I thought I'd try for it too. And that's where I am typing this right now. All the hikers in my bubble are here tonight (Gorp Gobbler, T- Storm, Rock Steady, Square Peg, and a few others). My shin feels good even after 20.3 miles (22.4 if you include side trips to Dismal Falls, Trent's Grocery, and the 0.5 miles off trail to get here) so things are looking good. Until tomorrow.......","unnamed camp site

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/497680,"Day 53 - Wood's Hole Hostel served a great breakfast this morning: buttery grits, scrambled eggs, cinnamon rolls, and coffee. After breakfast, everyone had to pull a chore from their chore jar and do the chore before leaving. My charge was to sweep the floor in one of the bunk rooms. I wasn't in any rush to hit the trail today, I only had 11.1 miles to get to Pearisburg. However, I was eager to get somewhere that had AT&T cell service though. I haven't been in contact with my wife for several days now. I finally got cell service within a couple of miles of Pearisburg, but I was on a ridge and could heard thunderstorms booming not far away. You don't want to be on a ridge top during a thunderstorm - it's a scary place to be. Just about the time I got down to the village, the threat of thunderstorms diminished. In town, I ran into Rock Steady. His family is visiting with him here. He arranged to give me and Hummingbird a ride to the Holy Family Hostel - about 1.5 miles away. I was really disappointed - there is no hiker feed here this weekend. I resupplied at Walmart and plan to head out with a heavy pack tomorrow. I'd like to get to Waynesboro at the south end of Shenandoah National Park before my wife picks me up for our reunion. The relatively easy hiking section through Shenandoah will help ease the shock of being reinserted back onto the Appalachian Trail. I had a chance to weigh myself at Wood's Hole Hostel. I'm at 190 pounds, if their scale is accurate. That means that between trying to eat more and the trail being easier in this part of Virginia, I have been able to slow or stop my weight loss. I still plan to fatten up at our family reunion, though, just in case.....","Wood's Hole Hostel
","Holy Family Hostel, Pearisburg, VA","May 29, Fri",11.10
Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/497752,"Day 54 - The Holy Family Hostel in Pearisburg, VA does not have a caretaker present. When Hummingbird and I got there last evening there were about 7 hikers who seemed to have taken up residence there for several days and the place looked like a frat house after a wild party. The posted rules stated: no alcohol, no drugs, 2 day maximum stay, quiet after 9:00 pm because the hostel and the church are in a residential neighborhood. Hummingbird, who has PTSD, was very upset at the condition of the place; the current residents, all quite young, were abusing the place and the trust of the church. A very noisy party was still going on at 10:30 pm and Hummingbird had her fill of it and called the caretaker, who then called the police. They arrived about 10:45 pm, confiscated all the alcohol, and issued warnings about what would happen if they received any more complaints. Behavior like this is why hostels get closed. I was in my tent trying to sleep as were several other hikers when the police arrived and we had no interaction with the police, but we heard it all. It rained most of the night until about 3 am, so my tent was wet when I packed up this morning. The sun started to make an appearance by the time I finished breakfast at McDonalds. By the time I hitched a ride for the 2.5 miles back to the trail, it was already warm and humid. There is an amazing difference in temperature between the city and the woods. As soon as I got into the woods, the temperature dropped at least 10 degrees. As I climbed up higher, a cool breeze developed and made the woods very comfortable - compared to the forecasted 86 degrees for Pearisburg. Because of the late start today was a short mile day, only about 13.1 or so. I've thought a little bit about having a Katahdin party as mentioned on Trail Journals, but actually Katahdin isn't even on my radar. My outlook is very short term: where is the next water source, where will I sleep tonight, where is my next resupply point, is it going to rain or do I have cell coverage here? In general, my furthest time horizon is about 2 or 3 days and usually it's no further than 4 or 6 hours.","Holy Family Hostel, Pearisburg, VA

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/498020,"Day 55 - I slept great last night, maybe the best since starting and I didn't even use any Benadryl either. It was an 18+ mile day with a 1200 ft climb around midday. It was pretty humid, about 75 degrees and I was sweating buckets. I was hiking with Chief Pretty Feet and he was hardly sweating at all! I can't figure it out - do I just have more sweat glands on my face than he does??? We stopped in at ""The Captain's"" - you get there by taking a zip line ride across a small river - but we were a day late for their big hiker feed! Check out the zip line on my photos page. There were a few sodas laying around the Captain's though, so I had one of those. Hikers who were there reported that the food was great, but the party Saturday night got pretty wild. I took a picture of a big black snake for my friend and former co-worker - Laura - just for you! I know how much you love snakes! That's what those are called: Black Snakes. They look pretty intimidating, but they're harmless. Today was a difficult hiking day what with the heat, humidity, and lots of miles - I might just go for an easier day tomorrow. One more thing - I know some of you think I'm really a blogging genius - but truth be told - my wife takes all the nonsense I send her and turns it into something readable for you on Trail Journals - both the pictures and the text - everyday.

My sister, Spyder, would have totally freaked out. I wasn't that comfortable with the whole idea either but I wanted to get to Niday Shelter before dark. It ended up being another high miles day. I was tired, hungry, and wet, but you just do what you have to do. I think there are thunderstorms forecast everyday for the next 5 days. These are afternoon pop-up storms - very unpredictable. I'm doing something else that I really shouldn't be doing tonight - keeping my food bag inside my tent. Mice have been known to chew holes in tents to get inside to get into foodbags. Little Bean woke up in the middle of the night to find 3 mice running around inside her tent after she kept her food inside. I will risk it - I'm dry, it's raining outside, and I'm not going out to hang it. Besides, maybe I'll have a midnight snack. I don't know exactly how far I will be going tomorrow, but since Niday Shelter is at mile 685.3, anything over 14.7 will put me at the 700 mile mark. I think I'm on track to be at Waynesboro when my wife picks me up to head to our family reunion at the beach.","unnamed camp site

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/498333,"Day 57 - I love sleeping in my tent. It took about 6 weeks before I was able to get a good night's sleep in it though. This is pretty counterintuitive - everyone thinks that after exhausting themselves hiking all day every day they'll fall asleep instantly when they lay down, but it just doesn't happen like that. Typically, I'd toss and turn for hours before falling asleep. But now, after all this time, it does happen just about instantly. Today I hiked over ""Dragon's Tooth"". It was more challenging than yesterday's hike over rock walls in a thunderstorm. It was scrambling/climbing on all 4's where one misstep could result in a very serious injury or worse - it keeps you focused. We (Chief Pretty Feet and myself) were on a schedule - which made things worse since we were late. Last year, Chief Pretty Feet attended a 4 day wilderness survival class at a place called Mountain Shepherd Wilderness Survival School right near the AT. They invited him to stop in this year when he got to this area. Chief Pretty Feet told the kind folks @ Mountain Shepherd that we would be at the Dragon Tooth visitor parking area at 5 pm. We didn't make it until after 6:00 but they were still there waiting for us. They drove us to Mountain Shepherd, fed us all we could eat, did our laundry, opened the bar for us (I had 3 Sam Adams!) and are putting us up here for the night. Tomorrow they're feeding us breakfast and putting us back on the AT at 8:30am. Best. Place. Ever. You should look up Mountain Shepherd Wilderness Survival School, owned and operated by Dina and Reggie Bennett, on FaceBook and the web. I felt the faint beginnings of a shin splint in my other leg this morning, so I pulled out my other compression sleeve and put it on. Unfortunately they are black. If they were green I would rename myself 'Green Sleeves' after the song - which I really like. 'Black Sleeves' doesn't have the same appeal - sounds like a pirate name. With the compression sleeves on, both legs are doing great. Thanks for your comments on my guest page on Trail Journals - if you have any questions, please ask and I'll respond via my daily update. I forgot to mention I passed the 700 mile point. There's a photo on my photos page. Until tomorrow......","Niday Shelter

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/498709,"Day 58 - I had a great night at Mountain Shepherd with Chief Pretty Feet and our hosts, Dina and Reggie Bennett. In the morning, Reggie cooked us a wonderful breakfast of scrambled eggs, sausage, pancakes, and coffee and then delivered us back to the trail. It was raining when we started hiking, a very light drizzle, and it continued to rain all day. The drizzle was light for most of the day. I didn't wear my rain jacket, but from time to time, I did have to put it on. The really bad thing about the rain and the low clouds was when I got to McAffe's Knob and Tinker Cliffs - there were no views!! These are iconic photography spots on the trail. Everyone wants to take photographs there, but they were a washout for me. Google image them and you'll see what I was hoping for. Chief is getting off the trail tomorrow to spend a couple of zeros with his wife so I'll be hiking alone as I head forward. I prefer this, I think, because it's hard to hike your own hike (HYOH) when hiking with someone else, especially when that person has an agenda (i.e. getting to a rendezvous spot to meet one's spouse). Tonight I'm dry inside the Lamberts Meadow Shelter. 10 miles north of here is Route 220 and there's a Kroger supermarket just 0.5 miles off the trail, perfect for resupplying, then on to Daleville. You may be wondering just what a thru-hiker gets when resupplying. Tomorrow I'll take a picture of the items in my food bag after a visit to Krogers. I'm sure Mrs. Pockets would like to see that picture as well. AT&T coverage is still very spotty around here - I keep expecting it to improve so that these updates can get out in a timely manner, but so far I've been pretty disappointed. Maybe they should send that ""Can you hear me now?"" guy for a hike on the AT. Until tomorrow......","Mountain Shepherd Wilderness Survival School

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/498829,"Day 59 - I got a late start out of the shelter; it was only going to be a 10 mile day into Daleville. Much to my surprise, Chief came up to the shelter all ready to hike. I thought he might have gotten lost in the woods awhile back as I hadn't seen him since about 5 pm the night before. Hah, he had slipped by me when I was taking pictures and had beaten me to our day's destination. At one point, I seriously considered backtracking to look for him. I decided though that we were all big boys out here and we all knew how to take care of ourselves. Despite today's hike being only 10 miles, I felt myself really dragging. I think it's just because I've done a lot of miles recently without a break. 4 zero days is not very much for hiking 700+ miles - I may slow down a bit and give myself a little break. Daleville is a great trail town with everything within easy walking distance. I went to their urgent care center to have them check a spot on my arm. They said not to worry, but keep an eye on it. Then on to Kroger's to resupply, the outfitter to get glue to hold my old shoes together, and to the UPS store to mail back my winter jacket, rain pants, gloves, and old hat - basically anything I hadn't worn in the past 3 weeks and didn't intend to wear again until probably New Hampshire. All told, a productive day - I exceeded my expectations. At the urgent care facility, I weighed 189 with probably a pound of clothes on, so I have succeeded in greatly slowing my weight loss. Although I look pretty skinny in the mirror, that's a bit of a relief. I took a picture of a typical day's food - the Skittles (little bursts of fruit flavored sugar) will last 8 or 9 days. I use them to provide a energy boost to help get me over mountains and it also doubles as trail money. My next resupply point is 6 or 7 days away so I'll be leaving here with a heavy pack - hard on the shoulders. Until tomorrow.....","Lamberts Meadow Shelter

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/498921,"Day 60 - 2 months into this journey. The weather today was a pleasant surprise. The forecast called for 60% chance of rain and thunderstorms. After an overcast morning, the sky cleared and produced a very nice day. I didn't leave Daleville until about 10 AM. After reviewing my next food resupply point, I determined that I would be short 4 days of food. A return trip to Kroger (1 mile round trip walk) was in order. Almost every hiker seems to take a zero in Daleville (it's called the Daleville vortex) and I was tempted. I managed to resist the Trail Town Sirens and ended up putting in 11.2 miles to Wilson Creek Shelter, not bad for a 'get out of town' day. Like always, it felt good to leave 'civilization'. I have blisters from hiking in worn out socks on too many rainy days. I wasn't sure if moleskin would work well enough to allow me to continue to walk - without pain. Fortunately, this fix seems to be working out very well. I do need to replace my shoes. I've been told that hiking shoes are only good for about 400 to 500 miles before they stop supporting and cushioning your feet like they should. The shoes I'm wearing now have 736 trail miles and maybe 300 'break-in' miles (wearing them to work and on the treadmill at the gym). I'm a frugal person and always thought that as long as shoes had tread and weren't falling apart they were fine. Now I wonder if the shoes I'm wearing have been responsible for my shin splints. Who knew?? My wife is bringing me new shoes soon. I'll have a chance to break those in for several days before hitting the trail again. Beginning tomorrow, my hike on the AT will start to approximate and eventually parallel and cross the Blue Ridge Parkway. That may allow me to increase my miles substantially. Doing the AT isn't a race, but covering ground is satisfying. I do want to be in Waynesboro, VA by the time my wife picks me up. The forecast for tomorrow is 50% chance of rain and thunderstorms, which always slows me down a bit. Until tomorrow......","Daleville, VA

If I don't make it, we should be able to meet up somewhere on the Blue Ridge Parkway. Today was a long day - 20+ mile days wear you out. The trail is roughly paralleling the Blue Ridge Parkway - although tomorrow there are some big climbs, one of which is 2200 feet. I'll tackle that early tomorrow morning, but it'll likely reduce the miles I cover. The weather has been remarkably good the past 2 days, much better than forecast. Tomorrow has only a 20% chance of rain so it looks like my luck is holding out. The first half of today I hiked alone; the second half I hiked with Paisley, The Mayor, Mama Sunshine, and 4BE. Nothing was really notable about today other than multiple crossings of the Blue Ridge Parkway and views at the overlooks. Here at the Bryant Ridge Shelter (one of the nicest so far) there are huge spiders, bigger than the Wolf spiders I've seen in the past. The spiders have everyone a little jumpy, but I'm in my tent so they can't get me here. You may have noticed a lack of flower photos recently. Now that the Mountain Laurel, Rhododendron, and Azaleas are gone there are very few blooming flowers around. It will be interesting to see what flowers are next to make an appearance. I think the shin splints are gone, but I'm going to keep wearing the compression sleeves until I get my new shoes. The only issue I still have are blisters on the toes of my right foot from all the rain. They're healing nicely and will continue to do so as long as the weather stays dry.

I need to do about 16.6 miles a day if I want to roll into there on Friday evening. Today I had a long, high climb from about 1300 ft to 4200 ft. That got me to the top of Apple Orchard Mountain - the site of an FAA center radar system. The climb up could have been worse, but it's a cool day with nice breezes. Thru-hikers have a love/hate relationship with large climbs. We often swear at them, but one of the reasons we're still out here is for the physical challenge. If we had a magic wand that would eliminate all climbs, I doubt we'd use it. I just need to remind myself sometimes that all hills have a top and if I just keep walking eventually I'll reach it. Just a week or so ago, I thought the landscape was flattening out, but I guess I was a little premature in that regard. Oh well. Recently, I've been hiking with The Mayor, Mama Sunshine, 4BE, and Paisley. Now it's just Paisley and me because the others decided to stop at a campground 3.2 miles south of here. At higher elevations today, the rhododendrons are still in bloom. Many of the rhododendron flowers have fallen at lower elevations, carpeting the forest floor and trail. It is quite a pretty sight. I'm afraid the pictures just don't do it justice. Columbines are starting to bloom. I'm sure several of my now 10 readers were able to identify them immediately.","Bryant Ridge Shelter

Fortunately, as I got higher the wind picked up so that the heat and humidity weren't so bad. Rumor has it that on Wednesday the temperature is supposed to be 95 degrees - that, if true, might be tough. Today I crossed the longest footbridge on the AT, across the James River. The big climb started shortly after that. I've been very fortunate with the rain and have had dry weather despite numerous forecasts of rain. I think that on Wednesday, however, rain might be welcome. There's another big climb coming up, a mountain called The Priest. At the shelter at the top of The Priest, you're supposed to confess your sins in the shelter register. I think I'll pass, I don't think the notebook would have enough pages. Tomorrow I'll pass the 800 mile point - another big milestone. I think I'm doing about 100 miles a week now. If I keep up this pace, finishing in mid-September shouldn't be a problem. When the terrain flattens out in Northern Virginia and points north from there, I hope that 20 mile days will be a common occurrence. Tomorrow's plan will only be a 10 mile day. I have 4.5 days until my wife picks me up, but only 2.5 days of food. I'm going into Buena Vista to resupply. My phone will be almost dead so I'll be able to recharge it if I spend the night there in a motel. My phone is the only way my wife will know where to find me and it's my camera as well, so that's important. I've heard some people say they could never do long distance hiking like this because they'd be bored. I am rarely, if ever, bored while hiking. There is so much beauty and peace in the woods and mountains - sometimes when I stop for a break I almost go into a trance just taking in everything around me. Then I realize I've spent 20 minutes just sitting there, shake myself out of it, and force myself to start walking again. Towns, in comparison, are places of noise and confusion. It's always a relief to leave them in spite of the good food, beer, warm showers, and clean clothes. Until tomorrow.......","Marble Spring campground

Five miles after leaving Punchbowl Shelter, I passed the 800 mile mark - always a Kodak moment. Aside from that, nothing too memorable happened today. It was hot and humid, though, and that turned even the small climbs (less than 300 ft) into sweaty events. I got to US 60 about 1:00 pm. Within 15 minutes, I was able to hitch a ride into Buena Vista from a guy who hiked the trail in 2002 with his family. He's going to do it again next year with just his wife. Someone wrote a children's book about his family's 2002 thru-hike, complete with lots of pictures. He showed me a copy of it - very interesting. I have a 2100 ft climb to Bald Knot (4100 ft) first thing tomorrow morning.   After a 7:00 am breakfast at the nearby Burger King, I'm going to hit the trail early to avoid the day's heat.

It's available in small foil packages that don't require refrigeration, it's inexpensive (about $1.25 a package), relatively light weight, and each one adds about 100 calories and protein to my diet.   A tuna salad package combined with a flour tortilla make a great mid-day sandwich, goes great with a Knorr Side, and I really like the taste (still). A hiker told me that there is mercury in tuna so I shouldn't eat too much. There's no warnings on the packages. It's hard to believe that long standing brands like Starkist, Bumblebee, and Chicken of the Sea would sell something with lots of mercury in it. Here's something that does really bother me: bugs in my tent at night. Each evening after I zip up my tent, I go on a bug hunt. My brother, Cotton, and my sister, Spyder, think I have a bug phobia. I think my tent should be a refuge from these biting little critters. There are many squished bug carcasses on the walls of my tent - I think I'll have a tent washing on my time away from the trail. OK, enough griping. Today was an absolutely beautiful hiking day - even the 2100 ft climb at the start of the day wasn't that bad because I did it in the cool of the morning. At 4000 ft, the temps all day were in the mid 70s, compared to the forecasted 84 degrees for Buena Vista. Tomorrow is supposed to be a carbon copy of today. I've been very fortunate with the weather except for Georgia (where it rained every freaking day). It's only 37 miles to Waynesboro and I have almost 3 days to get there. If I get there early enough, I just might go to a movie matinee while waiting for my beautiful wife, if I don't smell too bad. Until tomorrow......","US 60 - Buena Vista, VA

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/500033,"Day 66 - Today was a difficult day because of the heat and humidity. I started the day at Spy Rock at an elevation of about 4000 ft (cool there), hiked downhill a bit and then climbed 800 ft to the top of 'The Priest' Mountain. From there, it was all downhill to about 1000 ft and then a mid-afternoon climb back up to 4000 ft. The climbs took a lot out of me, but eventually I reached the top and it's cooler again. This may have been the last big climb for me for awhile. If I'm recalling correctly, Shenandoah National Park has less steep climbs for the most part as the trail pretty much follows Skyline Drive. At the Priest, there is a shelter register where hikers are supposed to confess their sins. I photographed a couple of pages (see photos section). Yes, I confessed some sins, but they shall remain secret to the readers of this journal. There's bear activity in this area. A hiker in my bubble (that means I see him often), Mantis, didn't do an adequate job of hanging his food bag a couple of nights ago. A bear was able to get it down from the tree and ran off with it. A couple of miles north of here camping is not allowed due to bear activity. With any luck, maybe I'll get a bear picture or two. It's only about 20 miles to Waynesboro from this shelter - I could make it tomorrow - there's a hiker feed planned with showers and laundry - all free. I could be all cleaned up and smelling good when my wife arrives on Saturday. On the other hand, a 20 mile day in this heat and humidity would be tough. I guess I'll just see how it goes.......","Spy Rock campsite

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/500150,"Day 67 - I wasn't sure how far I'd go today - the humidity was lower, but the temperature seemed higher. I was still sweating profusely on the uphills. In the end, I decided that 15 miles was enough and there wasn't a really good reason to push on the last 5.5 easy miles to Waynesboro. I'll still get there by 10 am tomorrow, time enough to clean up and participate in a hiker feast before my wife arrives around 4 pm. A thunderstorm hit in the afternoon and lasted quite a while while I was hiking.   After getting pleasantly cooled down, but before I was soaked, I happened upon a rock overhang. I was able to keep from getting drenched by taking refuge underneath it. Sometimes you just get lucky. The storm broke the humidity and cooled things off nicely for the evening. The shelter here is spacious and clean so I decided not to tent. It should make getting out of here early easy and maybe I'll even get into town in time for a big breakfast. There will probably be only 5 of us here tonight unless there are some late arrivals. Pickles just spilled a big pot of cooked orzo on the shelter floor. Do bears consider orzo to be food? If so we might have visitors tonight. We are at the northern end of the 'problem bears' section. Zissou is staying here tonight - he has been feeling bad all day and has vomited multiple times. He thinks it's food poisoning from some bad cheese or an overripe avocado he ate. I'm hopeful it isn't a norovirus. That is somewhat common on the trail, is very infectious, and lasts for 1 to 3 day. It causes severe vomiting, severe diarrhea, and in really bad cases hospitalization is called for. This may be my last post for about a week. I may post some pictures from the Outer Banks of NC, but that will be up to my wife, who may want a vacation from Trailjournals. So, until whenever.....","Maupin Field Shelter

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/501578,"Day 68 - I was able to get on the trail by 6:30 this morning, my earliest start so far. I was driven by the prospect of a scrambled eggs/bacon/coffee breakfast and shower in Waynesboro before meeting up with my family. The hike took 2 and 1/2 hours and then another hour to catch a ride into town. I was able to get a shower at the YMCA and sat down to eat by 10:00 AM. It was TrailFest Day in Waynesboro; all events sponsored by the YMCA. They provided free camping in town, free showers, an AYCE lunch at a local restaurant, and a free movie at the Zeus 8 cineplex - not a bad way to spend the time waiting to be picked up. Half the hikers watched the new Mad Max movie. Most of the rest, including me, watched Jurassic World, with many of the hikers rooting for the dinosaurs. There were about 40 or 50 hikers in town taking advantage of theTrailFest activities. While eating lunch, I heard that last night Stretch and several others had encountered a bear about 1/4 mile past Paul Wolfe Shelter. They had decided to continue on into Waynesboro for beer and pizza instead of staying at the shelter like me. The bear actually charged Stretch, but she held her ground and it veered off into the woods. My wife and daughter got here by 5:00 pm and by 9:30 pm, we got to Oxford, NC, where my son lives. We intend to complete the drive to the Outer Banks of NC on Sunday. A hot week is forecast in Virginia for next week, so this may be a good time to be off the AT.","Paul Wolfe Shelter

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/501832,"Dear Readers - This entry and the next 5 entries have been entrusted to Mrs. Pockets to compose as both of us did nothing but rest and relax while Pockets took time off the trail and I took time off Trail Journals. Hah! It's not too much of a stretch to imagine that I, Mrs. Pockets, have pretty much turned into a Trail Journals junky since I'm intently following my husband's journey and entering his data on Trail Journals almost daily. I've read lots of entries in hikers' journals about how thrilled they are to come upon unexpected trail magic. I thought it would be lots of fun to be a trail angel, but heck, our house is nowhere near the AT. As I prepped for the road trip from Western NY to Virginia to pick up Pockets, I got the brilliant idea to leave a couple of styrofoam coolers with water bottles, coca-cola, apple juice, and packaged snacks somewhere along the trail. Since Pockets was sure he'd be enjoying TrailFest in Waynesboro, VA by the time I made it there, I decided to leave trail magic off Miller's Gap Road- between Carlisle and Duncannon, PA. I didn't see any thru-hikers when I dropped it off.   I hadn't been following any hikers on Trail Journals who were already in Pennsylvania. I wasn't sure how many hikers would come across my trail magic. My plan is to fill the coolers back up as I head back up north after dropping Pockets back on the trail.","Rockfish Gap, VA

His parents have since passed on and his siblings and their offspring have scattered all over the USA-a nephew and his wife even joined us from Germany this year. Gatherings in those early years tended toward small cabin camping accommodations somewhere in the Eastern USA and especially in the state where he and his 7 siblings grew up. As the size of our extended family grew, we have headed more toward The Outer Banks of North Carolina, where there is an abundance of very large multiple bedroom vacation houses. Not all of the family made it this year and some that were there didn't pose for this photo, but this is a bunch of us. Today was Pockets 62nd birthday!

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/501884,"Dear Readers: Mrs. Pockets here - I'd like to think we got up early on our last day at the beach and watched the sun rise over the ocean, but that story ending might be more for movies. It didn't happen like that. We scurried around looking for all our stuff, which, of course, was not organized because we really didn't want to leave. The sunrise photo you see is from a day or two before the last day.   We had just watched several incredible night time lightning storms from the rental house's crow's nest deck though. They looked like mini fireworks. We dropped our son off at his new apartment near Raleigh, NC and then headed for a hotel in Waynesboro, VA. Our daughter drove us back to Rockfish Gap bright and early the next morning so Pockets could get back on the trail. Goodbyes are always hard, but hey, he's hiking north. That's closer to home base and that will make brief visits with him more possible. On the way back to Upstate NY, we again stopped at Miller's Gap Road in Pennsylvania to see what was left of our trail magic and to restock, if necessary. We were rather surprised to find everything had been comsumed- so we reloaded as best we could with water and snacks. Our daughter flew back to California today.

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/501950,"Day 75 - This was a difficult day, both mentally and physically. I forgot to check where the next water source was before I started hiking. I was carrying just 1 quart of water. That, plus a diet coke I had yogi'd had to last about 10 miles on a hot and humid day. 20+ miles is a long distance on any day on the AT.   On the first day back on the trail after 6 days off plus wearing new shoes, my feet were complaining loudly. Mentally, I was having a hard time getting back into the trail routine after all those days on the beach doing absolutely nothing - and now I was working very hard, wishing I was back at the beach. I hope I can make the mental switch back to the trail soon. I saw my first rattlesnake today - it was on the trail looking at a rabbit that was about 2 feet from it, also on the trail. It was way too big for the snake to eat so I don't know what was going on. As I approached, it turned to look at me and rattled, which is when I realized it was a snake and not a 2.5 foot long stick. As I fumbled to get my camera out, it slithered off the path except for it's tail. I guess I'd better start watching carefully where I'm putting my feet. With my eyes on the ground, I almost ran into one of the pretty tame deer that are here in the park. The thunderstorms held off until late in the afternoon. Given the heat, I was glad to get slightly rained on. There's a full shelter here tonight and a campground full of scouts. No one here is planning to hike naked tomorrow for the annual 'Hike Naked Day'. I was going to wear the speedo I wore on the beach, but decided against it - too many bugs!!!Until tomorrow....","Waynesboro, VA

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/501951,"Day 76 - Today was another challenging day. The long miles on my first day back yesterday gave me a couple of blisters, and at some point along the way, I must have overextended my right knee. The heat and humidity weren't quite as bad as yesterday, but still an issue. I made it a point to keep the miles lower today and will continue to do so until the blisters and knee are better. That means I can sleep in later if I'm in my tent, hike slower, and still get to the day's destination a little earlier. The big event today, aside from ice cream, soda, and sardines at the Loft Mountain camp store, was a rattlesnake that was blocking the trail. It refused to budge despite my prodding it with my trekking pole. All that accomplished was to piss it off and make it curl up in an attack pose with it's tail rattling furiously and still occupying the center of the trail. There was thick brush on both sides of the path. Eventually I decided that I had to end the impasse and eased my way past it. I was much closer to it than I wanted to be - about 2 feet. Someone later told me that they can strike their full body length - in this case that would have been at least 4 feet. I will be more cautious in the future. I've met up with hikers HVAC and Lorax, a married couple from Montana who are my age. They started late March and are also keeping a journal on Trailjournals.com. Everyone but me seems to be seeing bears. I'm ready to start seeing bears and to stop seeing rattlesnakes. At least with bears, I can stop fixating on the ground and don't have to worry about where I put my feet. Today was supposed to be 'Hike Naked Day', but I didn't see any naked hikers in spite of my best efforts. They probably passed me while my eyes were on the ground looking out for snakes. I had considered wearing my beach attire (a speedo), but this was also Father's Day, a weekend day and I'm in a national park. I could just imagine all the section hikers talking about that 'crazy old speedo wearing hiker'. Until tomorrow.......","Blackrock Hut - SNP, VA

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/501962,"Day 77 - The huts aren't spaced well in Shenandoah and don't easily allow for 15 to 18 mile days. I was going to have a short day today. When the sun rises at 5:30 am and other hikers start getting up at 6 am and make a lot of noise as they tear down and pack up, it is difficult to sleep in late. Once I'm up, there's not much to do except start walking. Since I'm camping by myself tonight though, I can sleep in as late as I want. My knee is feeling better, but my left foot has a blister on the ball underneath a large callus and any pressure on that is painful. That's the main reason I stopped short before reaching Lewis campground. That was my goal for today and which, if I had made it, would have resulted in another 20 mile day. I passed the 900 mile point today, but I missed the marker on the trail, so I have no picture of it. I'll try to get one from someone else. But 900 miles - damn that's a lot of miles! Lorax and HVAC are dealing with the hut spacing a little differently than I. They hitched on the Skyline Drive ahead, I think to a lodge. I considered hitching myself, but the traffic was thin and HVAC wasn't having much luck. So stealth camping totally by myself is a first for me. I think I was stung by a bee while taking a break at a picnic area. It's either that or a brown recluse spider bite. It's on my back at that one spot that's impossible to reach with either hand. I think it's a bee because they were swarming all over my pack for some reason while I was taking the break. One may have become trapped between the pack and my back when I put the pack back on. Most things won't sting you through a shirt, but I think a bee can sting through one. I'm getting back into the hiker mindset - it's taken a while but I think I'm going to be okay.

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/502090,"Day 78 - The trail these past 3 days has certainly been the easiest so far. If it was not so hot and humid and I had no injuries, I could really cover some ground here. It's a little frustrating to do only a little more than 12 miles today. I know that it's not a race, but I'd like to make up some of the time I lost while at the Outer Banks. Meanwhile, my blistered foot and overextended knee are feeling better so that is returning to normal. My mental attitude is improving as well as I distance myself from time spent with family and have more days on the trail. I remind myself that I have a whole lifetime ahead to do the things I'm missing now, but only one chance to do the AT. The website www.atweather.org warned of violent storms with damaging winds in this area starting around 3:00 pm and lasting until about 11:00 pm as a cold front moves through. I decided that was reason enough to spend the night at Big Meadows Lodge instead of in a tent in the woods. To me, 'damaging winds' in the woods means 'trees and dead branches falling'. So I'm having a very pleasant evening in the lodge. I had a good dinner w/beer and watched the storm come in from the west. According to NBC's nightly news, this same front has wreaked havoc all along the eastern US with reports of tornadoes, softball sized hail, etc. The good news is that the high tomorrow will only be in the upper 70s, so finally a break from the heat. HVAC and Lorax have also stopped here for the night and will be heading out in the morning. One of the benefits of hiking the AT in Shenandoah National Park is that there are camp stores, restaurants, waysides, and lodges scattered along the trail so I don't need to carry much food, which makes for a light pack. So far I've hit the Loft Mountain camp store and wayside, the Lewis Mountain camp store, the Big Meadows Lodge, and tomorrow I'll hit Skyland at some point. A 'wayside' is just a restaurant along Skyline Drive. Last night's stealth camping was pretty interesting - my first night alone in bear country. There's safety in numbers so most hikers like to camp at shelters/huts in the evening. The huts also have bear poles for hanging food out of the reach of bears. I didn't have any of that when stealth camping, but the upside was that I was able to sleep as late as I wanted without being awakened by the noise of all the early risers breaking camp. I am a little disappointed that I have not yet seen any bears here in the park when it seems everyone else has. Until tomorrow....","Stealth campsite @ mile 911.5

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/502232,"Day 79 - Today was just what the doctor ordered to cure my mental malaise - low humidity, sunny skies, and temps in the mid to upper 70s along with a nice breeze. In addition, my feet and knee are almost back to normal. I also got a diagnosis for that thing on my back that I thought was perhaps a bee sting or a brown recluse bite - shingles!!! This is a fairly small and mild case - Traildoc (not his real trail name) looked at it at Skyland and made the diagnosis. What is surprising is that I got the shingles vaccine last October. He said that it was a good thing that I had gotten it or it most likely would be much worse. I have a patch about the size of a quarter and it matches all the shingles symptoms, but mainly it just hurts. It's not so bad. I can ignore it. It should be gone in about 2 weeks, but I may stop in at an urgent care facility in Front Royal to have them look at it when I exit Shenandoah if it doesn't clear up by then. I got a late start today. That was partly because of the breakfast I had at Big Meadows with HVAC, Lorax, and Cricket, and partly because I wanted to resupply at the Big Meadows wayside. Resupplying there would eliminate the need to hitch into Luray to resupply this evening. The problem with that was it was 0.9 miles from the lodge to the wayside and no one stopped to give me a ride. Then when I went to pay I realized that my money and credit card were back at the lodge. So I had to go back to the lodge, get my credit card, then go back to the wayside to pay. Bottom line - I didn't get onto the AT until after 10:00 am. I hope I learned a lesson in there somewhere. I have a problem getting rides when hitch hiking. I think it's because I'm tall and I must look like a hobo. Someone told me that thruhikers are basically hobos with a credit card. HVAC and Lorax treated their clothes with a veterinarian strength (5%) permethrin solution as a tick repellant. It caused a bad rash reaction when they wore the clothes. The Sawyer's brand permethrin solution is 0.5% - this is what I have used and I've had no problem. I ran into HVAC, Lorax, Cricket, and Ambush at Skyland where I stopped for lunch #2 - HVAC and Lorax are staying at the lodge there tonight so I don't know when or if I'll see them again. I enjoyed their company when I was with them. Tomorrow morning I'll cross Thornton Gap where my brother 'Cotton', my sister 'Spyder', and I finished our Shenandoah section hike a few years ago. After that, I will once again be in virgin territory as I go north from there towards Front Royal, the northern terminus of the park. After that comes the 'roller coaster', a series of about 13 PUD's (pointless ups and downs) before coming to Harpers Ferry in West Virginia. Harper's Ferry is the unofficial 1/2 way point between Georgia and Maine. I'd like to get there before I reach the 90 days (3 months) point so that I feel like I'm on track to finish in 6 months.

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/502408,"Day 80 - Way back when I was still in Tennessee, I promised you, dear readers, that I would photograph some bear poop. Everyone has seen photographs of bears, nothing new there. But how many photos have you seen of bear poop? Probably none, until today, that is. And this is fresh, probably less than an hour old. Bear photos - same old thing. Bear crap photos - out of the box thinking!!! Tonight is my last night in Shenandoah National Park. In general, the hiking was the easiest to date, but it was made more difficult by hot, humid weather and my knee and foot problems. Those added at least a day to the time it took me to transit the park. Now mostly healed, I expect to take only 3.5 days to get to Harpers Ferry. I should get there by the 29th of June. From there, it's only a day or so to get through Delaware and into Pennsylvania. I'm ready to be done with Virginia with it's 500+ AT miles. At the same time though, I'm a little more apprehensive about Pennsylvania with it's infamous rocks. After a week back on the trail, I think I have lost most of the weight I gained on the Outer Banks. It's difficult to know for sure without actually weighing myself. Maybe I'll have a chance to do that tomorrow in Front Royal when I go there to resupply. The last time I weighed myself I was at 181.5 pounds, but I have no idea how accurate that scale was. I heard a new description on the AT today: ""The world's longest pub crawl"". It does make sense - lots of the young hikers love their beer, they stop at every bar in a trail town. Then they hike to the next trail town and repeat the process all the way up to Maine.

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/502607,"Day 81 - I finally saw a bear in the park today - it was far more satisfying than finding bear crap so forget all that stuff I wrote yesterday!!! Today was going to be a 12 mile day ending up in Front Royal for resupply. Ambush told me about a hostel he was stopping at (Terrapin Station) and that seemed like a much less expensive option. A stay there included a shuttle into town for resupply so that sealed the deal. The forecast for tomorrow is for a 100% chance of rain. The weather guys are forecasting 1 to 3 inches of rain with flood warnings. If that's true, there is a chance I might stay here tomorrow as well. I visited the urgent care facility when I went into the town today. They weren't convinced that I had shingles. Instead, it might be some other skin infection that is already starting to heal, so that's good news. While there, I weighed myself on their digital scale - 190 pounds. That is good news as well. I have decided that if I drop below 175 lbs., I will need to get off the trail. So 190 lbs. is a change in the right direction. The hostel here is owned by Mike Evans, an AT and PCT thruhiker with lots of stories to share (and beer/pizza to drink and eat). I recommend this place highly as an alternative to overnighting in Front Royal. In fact, I think I'll have some pizza right now. Until tomorrow.....","Gravel Spring Hut

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/502732,"Day 82 - I was uncertain if I was going to take a zero today and was especially conflicted when the rain stopped around 3:00 pm. By then, however, I had just successfully completed a practice 1/2 gal ice cream challenge (the secret is to let it soften out of the freezer for about an hour before eating it) and was unsure how my system would react. At the time of this writing, I am feeling no ill effects and hence feel fully qualified to participate in this upcoming official event on my journey north. I've already paid my hostel bill and will be leaving very early in the morning with a forecast of sunny skies and temps in the 70's to look forward to. At this point, I expect to be at Rt. 7 in Northern Virginia by Tuesday evening. My friends, Ellen and Dan from the RUFF Flying Club, have a daughter and her husband who live near there. I plan to head there just before getting into Harpers Ferry. I really appreciate their kindness!! Things we tend to take for granted - like a shower, laundry, a real meal and an actual bed - are great luxuries to a long distance hiker. Here's an idea - The owner of this hostel has suggested that when I get to Harpers Ferry, I jump up to Katadin and head south. The advantage of this is that the need to finish by October 15th - when Baxter State Park closes - ceases to be an issue. Also, the hot summer months of July and August would be spent further north where one presumes it might be cooler. The downsides of doing a flip-flop hike like this are the cost (I've got to get to Maine somehow), hiking against the tide of northbounders, and a disruption of my hiking flow once again. I will be thinking about this between now and Harpers Ferry, but my inclination is to continue northbound. Until tomorrow.....Here's a P.S. from Mrs. Pockets - I just noticed in Pockets' guest book that someone asked about how I, Mrs. Pockets, was planning to pick up the trail magic coolers I left in PA. I didn't include this information in the last TJ entry I did for Pockets and probably should have! When I returned to Miller's Gap after our Outer Banks trip, I found one of the styrofoam coolers smashed in, but empty- like someone had set their pack on it or had tried to sit on it and it broke. They just don't make them like they used to, I guess! The other cooler was filled with spent drink bottles and food wrappers, which I was pleased to see. That meant that not only had the trail magic been enjoyed, but hikers were depositing trash appropriately. I brought the trash and broken cooler back to our home in Upstate NY and that cooler was taken to our local recycling center yesterday. I almost brought the other cooler back too, but decided to refill it as it was mighty hot there and the forecast was for continued heat. TJ entries had indicated water was a problem there at that time. I knew I was planning to return to that area within a couple of weeks. That would allow me to again check on the remaining cooler, empty any trash in it, and refill it for any hikers to enjoy for the couple of days I plan to stay nearby. Then I'll bring that cooler home with me when I leave. Thanks so much for your concern and interest!","Terrapin Station Hostel

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/502896,"Day 83 - Once again it was a big relief to be back in the woods, escaping from the Terrapin Station Hostel. It's not that the hostel was a bad place - quite the contrary. But after spending two nights and an entire day there, I was really antsy to be moving north. Zero days feel like wasted days to me even though, in this case, it was necessary. Today was cool and rain free and I wanted to capitalize on that. Many of the hikers at the hostel took advantage of slack-packing provided by Mike, the hostel's owner. He provided them with a day pack for carrying some food and water and dropped the hikers off 25 miles up the trail. They would then walk back to the hostel while carrying much less weight. My personal hike, as I define it, only allows for slack-packing if I am injured or ill. Everyone has to decide for themselves what is allowable for their hike. I'm what might be called a 'purist' - no slack-packing, yellow blazing, skipping around, etc. In my case, I think that would detract from what it means for me to backpack from Georgia to Maine - but to each his own. There was a good philosophical discussion at the shelter this evening. Usually I avoid discussions involving the big 3 (religion, sex, or politics) because many people have deeply held beliefs on these topics and the debate can easily become acrimonious. That was not the case this evening. The conversation was very enjoyable (even though not everyone agreed with me). The small (quarter sized) rash on my back is healing nicely. The urgent care doctor in Front Royal didn't think it was shingles, but just some type of bacterial dermatitis that would respond, if necessary, to antibiotics. It looks like that won't be necessary though. Today I enter the 'roller coaster', a strenuous series of 13 climbs and descents that ends at Route 7 in Northern Virginia. I don't expect to finish it quickly. Until tomorrow.....","Terrapin Station Hostel

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/503063,"Day 84 - One of the most common questions I get asked is, ""Are you having fun on your hike?"". That's like asking someone who is climbing Mt. Everest, ""Are you having fun yet?"". The purposes of adventures are many and varied and fun is near the bottom of the list. For me, the purposes include (in no particular order and certainly not all inclusive): getting outside of my comfort zone, challenging myself, finding my limits, getting to know people outside of the demographic that I normally associate with, experiencing nature in a more intimate way, learning to adapt to unexpected and/or new situations, and generally to shake my life up a bit. It's so easy to become comfortable with our day to day lives that we can become risk averse, always taking the easy and safe path, doing the stuff we've always done and become hesitant to try new stuff. But fun?? Fun is going to parties, amusement parks, taking a cruise, buying a motorcycle, going on vacation, etc. I'm at mile 999.9 and will cross the 1000 milestone very early in the morning. Rest assured, I'm not failing to photograph that marker. I'm halfway through the 'roller coaster' - it's not as bad as the hype would suggest. Without the name, it would just be a series of fairly steep ascents and descents close together, but because someone gave this section a name, it has acquired a reputation. I'm just about 6 miles from the West Virginia border and about 23 miles from Harpers Ferry. I'm pretty excited about that. Until tomorrow.....","Dicks Dome Shelter

Because I knew it was going to be a short hiking day, I slept late, had a leisurely breakfast, and was under none of the usual pressure to keep on walking. I knew I only needed to do about 4 miles before meeting up with them around 1:00 in the afternoon. When I was planning my thruhike back in February and March, Ellen, my friend from home and Kerry's mother, suggested I stay with her daughter and family, who live near the trail. Luckily, I was able to make contact and meet up with them. My stay at their house was wonderful - great food, great conversations, a resupply in town, and a great night's sleep in clean clothes. Thanks go out to my friends Ellen and Dan for their suggestion and to Kerry and Bob for their kindness and hospitality!!

Bob cooked up a scrambled egg w/cheese breakfast that included apple juice and coffee. It was excellent! Bob drove me back to Rt. 7 and I headed north around 9:30 or 10 am. Then I completed the last 3 or so miles of the Roller Coaster and crossed into West Virginia. Finally I'm out of Virginia after more than 500 miles. I considered going all the way to Harpers Ferry, but there is not an inexpensive place to stay there. I decided to stop at a campground about 4 miles south of the village. That will still allow me to get there for breakfast, stop in and get my picture taken at the ATC (and find what my thruhiker number is. I'm guessing it's about 500), eat lunch, and then head into Maryland. At the campsite, I had a reunion with some hikers I hadn't seen since Tennessee: Buckle, Dutchy, Kate, and Fox - along with her husband. None of them recognized me because of my weight loss and beard, but upon hearing my name, they made the connection. We had a good time catching up on what has been happening, who's off the trail, etc. I was especially pleased to see Buckle (named because his knee could 'buckle' at any time). I had assumed that with a knee that bad he was surely off the trail. He's about 67 years old and has also had problems with weight loss. He gave me some great ideas he has learned about trail cooking that I am eager to try out. Physically, I'm in good shape now (except for that small mysterious rash on my back that isn't disappearing as quickly as I'd like it to disappear).Until tomorrow....","Rt. 7 @ mile 1003.5

When I woke up around 6 am, it was raining so I went back to sleep. When I awoke again at 8 am, everyone was gone from the campground - I was there all alone. I did not like that feeling at all - like everyone else had gone to a party, but I had somehow missed it. I packed up quickly and headed to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy Center (ATC) in Harpers Ferry. There I had my picture taken and added to ""The Book"" at the ATC. I'm hiker #1058 to pass through Harpers Ferry northbound, a higher # than I expected. One of the staffers said that half of the hikers that make it this far typically make it to Katadin Mtn. in Maine. He also said that the numbers have been rising every year. Next year, they are anticipating a much larger number due to the release of the movie ""A Walk in the Woods"" in September 2015. I left my pack at the center and went to get some lunch, a delicious mushroom cheeseburger w/fries. After going back to the ATC to pick up my gear and head north, I discovered that one of my trekking poles was missing. When I was eating lunch, one of the ATC staffers had moved my backpack and had put one of my poles either into or near the ATC's hiker box (where hikers put stuff they don't want anymore and others are free to take it). A hiker who needed a pole must have seen my pole in/near the hiker box and took it. Long story short: the ATC staffers helped me figure out who took it, I tracked him down and 4 hours later I had my pole back. I thought about just buying a new set of poles, but the local outfitter wanted $110 for a new set. So now it's too late to hit the trail and make it to the shelter before dark. Here I am at Teahorse Hostel in West Virginia for the night when my plan had been to be at Ed Garvey Shelter in Maryland. One thing this hike is teaching me is that you just have to roll with the punches and not get too upset when things go awry. So I've taken this opportunity to fatten up a bit on local restaurant fare. Tomorrow the hostel will be serving blueberry pancakes for breakfast - I expect to pig out and then hit the trail running to make up for lost time. I'll let you know how it goes.

The trail followed the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal towpath for a while before heading up into the hills. The shelters on this part of the AT are extraordinary: recently built, well maintained, sometimes with deck railings, benches, chairs, and with a capacity of 12 to 16 hikers. Some of us were discussing this during a lunch break at one of these shelters. We concluded that the Potomac Appalachian Hiking Club, who maintains this section of the AT, must charge their members high membership dues to pay for all these fine shelters. Boiling Springs, Pennsylvania, is about 80 miles north of the campground that I'm at right now. That's about 5 days ahead if everything goes well. Mrs. Pockets is going to meet me there - I can't wait. Although our home is in Northwestern NYS, as I get further north, maybe we can meet up more frequently. It's supposed to rain tonight and tomorrow morning as well. In fact, it's raining quite hard right now as I type this in my tent.

It rained so hard last night that I wondered if my tent would keep me dry, but it held up well. I did have to put it away wet, which I don't like to do. I've decided I really don't like rocks. Pebbles and boulders are fine as are domesticated rocks, but the feral rocks of Maryland can be maddening. Maryland must be very proud of their rocks since they've routed the AT over every rock pile in the western part of the state. These gangs of rocks trip me, cause me to slip, grab at my trekking poles, trap my feet, and in general slow me down so that I don't get as far for the day as I have planned. I get along ok with sedimentary and igneous rocks, but this metamorphism is not okay. I'll leave the south and enter the north as I cross the Mason-Dixon Line tomorrow. This also coincides with Pennsylvania's southern border. Some hikers attempt a 24 hour 4 state challenge where they try to do the 40 miles from the Virginia/W.Virginia border to the Maryland/Pennsylvania border in one day.

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/503910,"Day 90 -   I'm dissatisfied with how long it takes me to get on the trail after I wake up in the morning. Typically, it's about 1 hour and 15 minutes. This time includes tearing down my tent, eating and packing my pack. I've seen others do the same in about 40 minutes - about half the time I require. I might need to do a kaizen on my procedure and get it down to 30 - 40 minutes. It's been quite a while since I've had a 20 mile day. I was beginning to wonder if I still had my 20 mile mojo. So today, I resolved to do 20 miles. My goal was Rocky Mountain Shelter, just about 20 miles even. About noon just as I was thinking about food, I recalled a conversation I had at Dahlgren Campground with a hiker who said that there were cheeseburgers, hotdogs, sodas, etc. at Caledonia State Park. They have camping there too. I figured I'd stay there for the night, the distance would be over 20 miles and I could demonstrate my mojo. As I was eating that cheeseburger, Cricket and a couple other hikers stopped in to eat too, but their plan was to continue on to the Quarry Gap Shelter. My feet, which had been complaining loudly as I got to the park, had calmed down as I sat there, so I too hiked on to the shelter. I think this is my longest hiking day so far: 25.4 miles. I don't plan to make a habit of this! I'll pass the halfway mark on the AT tomorrow. Harpers Ferry is really only the psychological halfway point. The actual mileage halfway point is 10 miles ahead at mile 1094.6. It's all downhill from there! I'm also looking forward to the famous 1/2 gallon ice cream challenge tomorrow at Pine Grove Furnace. I know I can meet this challenge because I ate 1/2 gallon of butter pecan ice cream non-stop at Terrapin Station Hostel about a week ago. I'll let you know how the official challenge goes.

I think I've succeeded - only 16.2 miles. I should be able to do that by 3:00 pm. The weather today was not as bad as the forecast had suggested - the thunderstorms held off until late afternoon. I did get soaking wet - it was like getting a shower while walking, but the rain did stop in time for me to find a place to camp for the night and get my tent set up. I hiked most of the day today with Cricket. We passed the official 1/2 way point and made it to Pine Grove Furnace State Park where I had a California cheeseburger - one with lots of avocado slices. This is the location of the official 1/2 gallon ice cream challenge. Since I had more hiking to do, I settled for a large 2 scoop dish of raspberry ice cream. I badly need a haircut - I look like a wild man out here and I scare all the young kids at the state parks. Maybe I'll get one tomorrow. The beard will remain, however, dice Tom C., my brother-in-law. Unbeknownst to me, he grew one to show his solidarity with my hike. I promised him I would not shave again until my hike is over. It's starting to come in pretty well, I think. Lots of hikers have been finding ticks on them. One hiker, Freedom Fry, found one on his penis - a dick tick? We got a good laugh about that, wondering what the bullseye rash would look like. The hiking in Pennsylvania has been easy so far - far fewer rocks than in Maryland. A ridgerunner named Patches said that the bad rocks that Pennsylvania (Rocksylvania) is famous for are 90 miles ahead, far too distant for me to worry about yet. The next trail town after Boiling Springs is Duncannon, home of the famous (to hikers anyway) Doyle Hotel.

The AT, amazingly enough, has 4 separate center points: 1.) the 'psychological' center at Harpers Ferry, 2.) a permanent ATC marker fixed in place, 3.) an ATC center marker that is moved every year to show the actual center that changes due to yearly rerouting the trail, and finally 4.) a 'Center Point' stone monument put up by the town of Boiling Springs on the trail about 4 miles south of the village. Today was supposed to be an easy day. Just a bit over 16 miles to get to Boiling Springs and mostly downhill. But when you have wet shoes and socks, your feet can start to chafe and blister in very short order. And well, mine did. To make matters worse, while navigating through the 'rock maze', I fell and really bruised my butt. Plus, it was a hot and humid day and the last 1.5 miles into town went through unshaded fields with no cooling breeze. I came limping into town - hot. blistered. sore. I was so ready for some TLC from Mrs. Pockets. We stayed at the Allenberry Resort in Boiling Springs, close to the ATC Center and not far off the AT - they have a special hiker rate of $40 per night. I don't know if we got an extra good room because Mrs. Pockets was there too, but this room is nice. After a much needed shower and laundry, I ordered a large pizza and large salad at the local pizza place in town, but couldn't quite finish it all.

Mrs. Pockets and I had a great breakfast at a local diner that reminded me of those classic Long Island diners. They must not get hikers at the diner we ate at today. The waitress thought I was joking when I placed my food order, but she seemed quite impressed with how much food I ate. This is a new skill for me - ordering and eating prodigious quantities of food at restaurants. We had a good dinner at the historic Tavern Restaurant in the pretty town of Boiling Springs as well. Today was mainly about trying to take it easy. Mrs. Pockets and I spent much of the day driving around Carlisle and Harrisburg looking for equipment upgrades. I've been trying to find a new pack cover that will actually keep my pack dry in a storm, an eyeglass band that is comfortable and will hold my glasses on when I get really sweaty and I needed some permethrin (an insecticide especially effective in keeping ticks away) to re-treat some of my clothes.

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/504749,"Day 94 - The weather forecast for today called for strong late afternoon thunderstorms. Mrs. Pockets came up with the idea of staying 1 more day so she could pick me up from hiking @ Millers Gap Road, where she needed to go anyway to retrieve some water jugs she had just left as more trail magic on her way to meet me in Boiling Springs. I'd be able to dry out in a motel room if it does rain - as has been predicted by the weather guys. Plus, I'll only need to carry enough food to get me through to about 4:00-5:00 in the afternoon, so my pack will be relatively light. So that was the plan. After another large breakfast @ that same diner from yesterday, Mrs. Pockets dropped me off back at the ATC Center in Boiling Springs, where I had left off and then I headed north on the trail. Aside from the heat and humidity, which always seems to bother me quite a bit, the hiking was easy - only 1 ridge to cross near the end of my planned day. At one point though, I saw a man out in his yard and asked him if I could refill my water bottle. Not only did he allow me to fill my water bottle, but he also asked if I needed anything to eat. His kindness was greatly appreciated, especially since the next reliable source was a drainage ditch 3 miles ahead. I didn't relish the idea of drinking from that. Today was the first time I have even stopped at someone's house and asked for water. I'll do it again - if necessary. Mrs. Pockets picked me up at Miller's Gap as planned. She said she had given some water to a couple of thru-hikers, Tootie Fruity and Ghost Something..., while waiting for me to arrive. As we drove back to town, I commented about the lack of thunderstorms today and how I just can't let a bad forecast control my hike. As we sat eating dinner 30 minutes later, a really violent storm front came through with intense lightning, strong winds, tree branches down, restaurant lights flickering on and off and extremely heavy rain. It must have been pretty scary for anyone staying at Darlington Shelter, which is at the top of the 700 foot ridge I had just crossed a little earlier in the day. Mrs. Pockets told me later that she learned a tornado had formed from that storm and leveled a school building - about 55 miles east of where we were eating dinner. Anyway, passage of that front now means lower humidity and temperatures - for the next couple of days.

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/504837,"Day 95 - Today I passed through Duncannon, PA - where the very old and historic Doyle Hotel caters to AT hikers. The trail goes through a residential area before crossing over the Susquehanna River on a large bridge shared by major highways (Routes 15 & 322) - those head toward Harrisburg as well as other points. As I walked through the residential section that runs about a mile in length, I was thinking about how much time and money we all spend to purchase, maintain, and fuel our cars and trucks. There were so many of them rushing around and parked on the streets of this little town. We have a great deal of our country's wealth tied up in cars and trucks. Although I enjoy the convenience of cars when I'm not hiking, I kind of wish we had fewer cars. More bicycle use, better public transportation, and a slower pace of life, like some of the European countries have, would be ideal - at least to me. I'm guilty of having multiple cars myself - I guess change should first start at home. The other thing I noticed while resupplying at a small grocery store in Duncannon is how much of the food sold in stores in this day and age has very little nutritional value. I guess I just never paid much attention to it before. Mrs. Pockets is our grocery shopper at home. Once again, I'm having a difficult time readjusting to trail life - this time after only a 3 day visit from Mrs. Pockets. Her visit made me realize how much I'm missing at home.

It just takes a few days to get back into the hiking mentality after one or more zero days and having loved ones around seems to make that extra hard. I got an early start today in hopes of hiking a 20 mile day, but things didn't go according to plan. About 4 miles in, there was a group doing a trail magic breakfast. Lucky me! Being one who never turns down food (even when not hiking), I had a second breakfast there - scrambled eggs, sausage, and bacon! Wonderful, but that took an hour of my day. Then 12 miles later, that same group showed up at a road crossing and offered dinner! They had just gotten there and weren't set up yet. I waited around for another hour chatting, but dinner still wasn't ready. I settled for some strawberries, a banana, a bottle of Gatorade and headed up the trail. But by now, there wasn't enough time to get to where I wanted to be, so I just had to settle. Still not a bad day. If I average 15 miles a day for the next 8 days, I'll be able to reach Delaware Water Gap and then enter into New Jersey, my eighth state!! The last 50 miles of Pennsylvania are very rocky, however, so I'm not sure I will be able to do 15 miles a day. Time will tell. I do need to do more miles when the hiking is still relatively easy. The number of thru-hikers I'm meeting continues to decrease. I don't know if that means lots of hikers are getting off the trail or if I am behind most of them. Everything I've read and heard indicates that I'm just about where I need to be at this point. I'm not going to worry about it. There are quite a few section hikers out here.

I finally had to break out the Deet in an effort to stave off the annoying little critters. To deal with the humidity, I shed my shirt and drank lots and lots of water. I did get in 25+ miles, though, and had trail magic too! Hot dogs, grilled chicken, strawberries, and a root beer, so I count today as a win!! I'm sorry to say I do need to vent a bit about the club that maintains this section. Nearly 3 miles of this afternoon's hike had lots of poison ivy along the sides of the trail. Someone with a weed whacker knocked down all the poison ivy plants (great), but left pieces and shards of poison ivy everywhere. The cut up poison ivy allowed for the plants' resin to be all over the trail! There's lots of poison ivy in the woods surrounding my home in Western NY. I know it's a struggle to contain or kill it. Normally poison ivy doesn't bother me, but it will be a miracle (and I don't believe in miracles) if I don't come down with a really bad rash. Usually a hiker doesn't care for rain. It slows you down and makes the trail muddy and slippery. Since I'm soaked in sweat anyway today, I'm really wishing for the cooling effect of rain and the shade the clouds provide. Tomorrow's forecast calls for 20% chance of rain. Maybe I'll get lucky.

I'm glad I didn't get moving early because within the next hour, it escalated into a full blown thunderstorm. What a direct contradiction to the National Weather System forecast for Eagles Nest Shelter. The forecast @ www.atweather.org called for a 20% chance of showers and no mention of thunderstorms. I thought they were better at predicting a forecast than that. Anyway, it was a short day to Port Clinton so waiting for the storm to pass wasn't a big issue. I had to stop in Port Clinton to recharge batteries, resupply for about 5 days, do laundry, and get a shower. Resupplying turned out to be a bit of a problem. Walmart, the closest resupply store, is about 2 miles away from The Port Clinton Hotel. The hotel is just a bit north of the AT. To resupply, it's a 40 minute walk one way on busy Highway 61 into Hamburg, PA - if I can't get a ride. And I couldn't. I think the problem is people won't stop to pick up someone who looks like an escapee from an asylum. I wasn't wearing my pack, which would have identified me as a hiker, so that probably compounded the issue. I walked the 4 miles round trip. It was not an option to skip the resupply of food, so I did what I had to do. Delaware Water Gap, which sits on the PA side of the PA/NJ border, is 75 miles ahead. The miles between here and there are notoriously rocky. It's unlikely I'll be able to maintain my recent pace, but within a week or so I'll be out of Pennsylvania and into New Jersey.

In this case though, I had to wait until after 9 am for the bartender at The Port Clinton Hotel to arrive so that I could get my room key deposit ($10) back. A bit unusual, but that didn't hold me up from doing reasonable miles today. While waiting for him, I had a great breakfast @ 3C's Restaurant with really large portions. Now that's the way to leave a town - with a very full belly! Today is my 100th day since starting on Apr. 7th. If I'm @ mile 1234.3, that puts my average daily distance at 12.343 miles (including zero days). I feel like I'm in the middle of NoWhere, PA, but today I ran into 2 large groups of non-thruhikers on the trail. The first group consisted of 30 Japanese tourists staring off into the distance from an overlook called 'The Pinnacle', which wasn't particularly scenic. I don't have any idea how they got there: there aren't any roads leading to the overlook and they certainly weren't dressed like or looked like hikers. I probably should have asked if they were lost. About 5 miles later, I ran into a large squadron of Civil Air Patrol members training to locate airplane crashes. At least they all had backpacks so they looked more like they belonged in the woods. Aside from that, there's really not a lot to say about the AT in Pennsylvania - except the rocks. The trail doesn't go anywhere particularly interesting and there aren't a lot of great views.

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/505809,"Day 101 - Well, I certainly got introduced to Rockslyvania today. Some hikers hate the smaller rocks: the toe stubbers, the sole piercers, the ankle twisters, and the pole grabbers. Those don't bother me that much - my feet are pretty tough and my shoes can handle them. What I don't like, because of the chance of severe injury, is the boulder leaping. Boulder climbing isn't so bad because if your foot slips you're just not going to go up - you won't necessarily fall. But if you are jumping from boulder to boulder or if you're descending down a boulder field and your foot slips or a rock tips, gravity takes over. You're going down and it's going to hurt, probably pretty bad. Poles are of little use then because the metal tips just skitter across the rock - they can't be trusted. There's a place called the Knife Edge I had to walk on today. If I were a dancer and graceful on my feet, I probably would have loved the boulder leaping. Those who know me also know that I'm about as graceful as an elephant. Anyway, I'm only about 39. 5 miles from New Jersey, where hopefully this rock madness will end! I was glad I ran into a guy on the trail today surveying Elm trees in this part of Pennsylvania. He said they are bouncing back very strongly from Dutch Elm Disease. That's good news to hear - the Emerald Ash Borer has been playing havoc with Ash trees as well. As you may recall, dear readers, I recently stayed at the Port Clinton Hotel. I've read some hiker reviews on-line that call it a ""rundown old fleabag"". The Port Clinton Hotel was built in the early 1800's and at one point was a stage coach stop. Very old, yes, but I loved it. It could have been a set right out of a western movie with a saloon downstairs and a few rooms for rent upstairs. The folks were friendly and the food was good. It met my needs. I guess if some hikers prefer more sanitized, homogenized rooms near the trail, they can stay at a Microtel, Red Carpet Inn, etc, which seem to be abundant.Until tomorrow,,,,,,","stealth campsite

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/505929,"Day 102 - This morning I stopped in for water at the George W. Outerbridge Shelter and met ""The Belgium Machine"". He pointed out a snake that was living up in the shelter rafters. I couldn't tell what kind it was, but I never considered snakes living there before. Now I have something else to consider if I'm thinking of staying in a shelter. Thankfully, I never did get poison ivy from that section of trail where they weed whacked it. I guess miracles do happen (even if I don't believe in them). Today I climbed out of the Lehigh Valley and into a boulder field. Literally, a huge field of nothing but boulders. The reputation that Pennsylvania has for it's rocks on the AT is justified, but they really are doable. Patience and good weather help. It's said that nearly half the people who make it past Harpers Ferry drop out in Pennsylvania because of the rocks. I don't understand this - like any nuisance (long high climbs, hot humid weather, heavy rain, etc.) - you just need to wait it out and eventually it will end. I think that's why it's said that half of the AT challenge is mental. Anyway, only 20 miles more and I'll be out of this state. Tomorrow's plan is for about 16 miles to set me up for a nero day into Delaware Water Gap on Sunday so I can meet up with some pre-retirement work friends from Rotork Controls. Oh, I almost forgot to mention, I met the world's most interesting man today - I didn't know he was doing the trail this year.Until tomorrow...stay thirsty my friends!!","campsite @ mile 1254.2

There was one early this morning. Unfortunately, by 7 am, it had moved on and I had to hike. I planned to quit for the day at a campsite about 4 miles from Delaware Water Gap because I'm meeting John and Laura, my friends from home, there on Sunday. While hiking over Wolf Rocks today, I came upon a young day hiking couple sitting on the rocks enjoying the view. As I passed by, the guy said, ""We've got a friendly snake here"". There was a medium sized rattlesnake about a foot beneath them on the rocks. I told them what it was and I've never seen anyone move as fast as they did. I think the girl dragged the guy right back to their car! Gernot ( a hiker from Germany) and I arrived at Kirkridge Shelter around 2:30 in the afternoon. Hiking with Gernot ( trail name Tonreg) is a bit of a challenge in that he speaks almost no English and I speak absolutely no German. Communication between us becomes a game of charades - but usually the point gets across. We decided to push on toward Delaware Water Gap. Thanks go out to some section hikers staying at Kirkridge Shelter for providing us with a couple of beers. I'm sure they helped us endure those last 6 miles! Anyway, we met my friends, John and Laura, at The Deer Head Inn. They treated Garnot and me to a wonderful dinner - minestrone soup, potatoes, asparagus, steak, and blueberry corn cake w/ice cream. There was no calorie deficit today!! John speaks fluent German, so with him as a translator, I learned more about Gernot in the time it took us to eat than I had in all the days I've hiked with him. I'd better install a German voice translator on my iPhone if I continue to hike with him. There'll be another filling breakfast and then lunch with my friends before they head back home to Upstate New York. It was great to see John and Laura, who brought me up to date on happenings at home and my former workplace. Tomorrow I'll cross the Delaware River on a walkway over I-80 and enter New Jersey. I look forward to saying goodbye to the rocks of Pennsylvania, but, according to some hikers, I'll say hello to the rocks of New Jersey. Stay thirsty, my friends! Unless you're hiking...","Leroy A.

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/506317,"Day 104 - Last night, a number of hikers gathered on the porch of The Deer Head Inn swapping stories and showing photos. To the amusement of non-hiking patrons, it evolved into a contest of who had the most bizarre snake pictures. The Belgium Machine won with his picture of an 8 foot long skinny green snake. It was lots of fun and a good time was had by all. It's a hot day today - in the upper 90's at Delaware Water Gap. I'm in no hurry to hit the trail because my friends from home, John and Laura, are still here. After a large breakfast at The Deer Head Inn, I visited the local outfitter for some gear odds and ends. John and Laura took Gernot (the German speaking hiker) and me to Walmart to resupply our food bags. In Walmart, Laura accused me of swiping a large Pepsi from someone else's cart, but my version of the story is that the cart had been abandoned! We all went to Friendly's for lunch - complete with ice cream sundaes for all. At lunch, I read some notes Laura had brought from my former coworkers at Rotork. They really meant a lot to me - even the one from Don K., who was always trying to put gas in my electric car! Thanks to all of you for taking the time to do this! Gernot and I delayed the inevitable return to the trail (and heat) as long as possible. My friends dropped us off at the trail around 3 pm and Gernot and I began our trek into New Jersey across the I-80 bridge. We resolved to go slow and that made the heat bearable. Eventually, we made it into the woods, where it was close to 10 degrees cooler. There were no steep climbs out of Delaware Water Gap and that helped as well. We tackled two milestones today - the New Jersey border and the 1, 300 mile point marker by 6 pm. To celebrate, Gernot and I ended the night with some Fireball (cinnamon flavored whiskey). Tomorrow is supposed to be a cooler day. We should be able to cover some ground - while keeping an eye open for bears. NJ has the highest bear density of any place on the AT. It's joked that ""Even Ray Charles sees bears in NJ"". Even if I can't understand a word Gernot says, it's good to have a hiking partner in New Jersey. Two can fight off bears better than one!

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/506436,"Day 105 - I like this part of New Jersey - except for the heat (not New Jersey's fault) and the mosquitoes. The trail is fairly easy, there are lots of scenic ponds, little lakes and overlooks, and the rocks are a more friendly breed. I'm happy to be out of Rocksylvania! The DEET has finally been put to good use because of the mosquitoes. I found a tiny tick stuck to my shin, at least I think it was a tick. It was too far from my eyes and too small to get a definitive ID. The tick was about the size of a grain of pepper and wouldn't let go of my leg, but I eventually got it off. If they are that small, I may have others on me that I don't know about. I got an early start hiking to take advantage of the cool morning air. The forecast called for another really hot day, though not quite as hot as yesterday. Trail magic at lunch time today! It was provided by the Trail Angels Division of the Hunterdon NJ Hiking Club - fruit, hot dog, cheeseburger, corn on the cob, and two bottles of Gatorade. There will be no weight loss today! I planned to finish the day at Brink Road Shelter, but the place was so overrun by mosquitoes that it was impossible to stay there. Even the DEET was only a minor obstacle to them. They were very adept at finding any square inch of untreated skin. The campsite I am at now overlooks a beautiful lake, has a cool breeze, and should even have a wonderful sunrise. About 1.3 miles ahead, there's a restaurant at a road crossing - just the perfect location for breakfast in the morning too! Does it seem like I'm a little pre-occupied with food? There's only 46 more miles of the AT in New Jersey before it enters New York, so I won't be in this beautiful state long. The trail follows the western and northern borders of New Jersey, an area I had never seen before. Tomorrow is supposed to be another hot day, then it's supposed to cool down for the rest of the week. That should make hiking more enjoyable. Until tomorrow.....","unnamed campsite @ mile 1301.5

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/506618,"Day 106 - I like early starts, especially on hot days. And I really wanted to eat breakfast at a diner that crosses the AT on Rt. 206. The forecast's for another very hot day, but fortunately, the last one for awhile. Here's one thing to note: when asking a non-hiker how far down the road a diner (or anything else) is, it's important to know that they are likely to underestimate the distance by at least 100%. A gas station attendant said the diner was about a half mile down the road, but it was more like a mile and a quarter. At the diner, there was a large bear who had just decided his breakfast should come from the diner dumpster. My first thought was I'd hate to meet him in the woods!! He was big! The trail was very rocky (Pennsylvania type rocky) today, so my opinion of the AT in New Jersey has diminished a bit. The mosquitoes were out in force as well. Because Gernot and I were hot, sweaty, dirty, and downright stinky, we decided to end the day at a hotel near Port Jervis, NY. That way we could enjoy the much anticipated cooler days with clean bodies and clean clothes. In the morning, our challenge will be to find a ride the 4.2 miles back to the headquarters at High Point State Park. But, that will be after an all you can eat continental breakfast here at the hotel. We'll clean them out of food and they'll never know what hit them!!

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/506792,"Day 107 - Gernot (pronounced Genoot) and I had a hard time getting a ride from our hotel back to High Point State Park where our hike would continue. I can understand the reluctance of women picking up scruffy looking old geezers. Some of the male car drivers that passed us must have known we were AT hikers just needing a ride back to the trail. Maybe they were all late for work, I don't know... but about a half a mile later, we thought we were going to have to walk all of the 4.2 miles uphill back to the trail. Just as this realization came to us, a guy responded to our hitchhiking thumbs and pulled over! At that moment, we were the two happiest guys on the planet. In our ordinary, everyday lives, most of us don't have to beg for help from strangers. Most folks tend to have resources available to them through their jobs, church, clubs, family, friends, or public/private agencies so they don't need to flat out beg for help. Maybe that creates a hard time for us to empathize with someone who does need help...just a thought. It can become easy to think that someone else will help them out, they're just lazy, they should just help themselves, or that our own lives are hard. I hope in the future I'll be more likely to respond to requests for help from others since I've been the recipient of help when I've needed it here on the AT. I know how grateful I was when I got help. Perhaps we're a bit too judgmental about those seeking assistance. I know it's changed my thoughts. Anyway, enough of my preaching for today. We were able to start today's hike just a little after 8 am. The air was cool and it looked like it was going to be a great hiking day. New Jersey partially redeemed itself from yesterday. The trail was much less rocky, the scenery was pretty, and the bugs were dormant. Gernot and I would have covered more distance today, but in NJ, you're only supposed to camp at shelters and the spacing is inconvenient. The next shelter from where we're camped (probably illegally) is another 7 miles (a 3.5 hr. hike) ahead. That would not be doable before dark, so this is the best we can find for the night. Wandering around in the dark looking for a place to set up a tent is really not a great idea. The New York line is just 10 miles ahead. I'll be marching into my home state tomorrow. I'm looking forward to that. Until then....","High Point State Park Headquarters (NJ Rt.23)

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/506996,"Day 108 - Does everyone see bears in New Jersey? I guess the bear I saw in the dumpster will have to be my New Jersey bear. If he's typical of NJ bears, I'm glad I didn't see another one! I came upon a climb today called ""Stairway to Heaven"". There had better be another way to get to Heaven because if this is the only way, most people aren't going to make it. It was a steep, rocky, tough climb. I'm glad I was able to do it in the cool morning air because I was still hot and sweaty when I reached the top. It was a special moment for me to cross over into New York today - my home state. It's such a clear day. From one of the ridges, I could see the skyline of New York City in the far distance. I don't think it's visible in the picture I took, but check out the photo anyway on my photos page. Right now I'm only about 30 miles from Bear Mountain Bridge, which goes over the Hudson River. I've section hiked from there north to Woodstock, VT so I'll know what to expect on that part of the AT. Today's hiking included a lot of rock leaping, but this was much better and more fun because it was bedrock. I didn't need to think about rocks tipping. The traction was very solid. All things considered, I liked New Jersey. The section of NY I hiked today was good too and the weather was perfect! The best part of the day though was crossing NY 17A to reach Bellvale Farm Creamery - a large ice cream emporium. I had 2 large dishes of ice cream and a cone - delicious calories. It was hiker heaven! From there, it was just 2 miles to reach Wildcat Shelter, where I'm staying tonight.

High mileage days over rough terrain is not easily sustainable, especially so with a full pack. It's too easy to injure yourself. Today wasn't the easy day we were hoping for. The trail here in Southern NY State has many large boulders with steep ups and downs. Our hike today culminated in the ""Lemon Squeezer"". Many famous features of the AT have fear inducing names like Jacobs Ladder, The Roller Coaster, Fat Man's Squeeze, Stairway to Heaven, etc...but most do not live up to the hype. This one did. It could have been named Thin Guy's Squeeze because even a thin guy would need to distort himself to get through and in no way get through wearing a pack. On the other side of the Lemon Squeezer is a climb that is reminiscent of the climbing walls that you might see in a large mall/outdoor store or at outdoor events. For the faint of heart or in case of very bad weather, there is a blue blaze trail around The Lemon Squeezer. Purists don't take blue blaze trails though. Near there, I came upon a huge rattlesnake on the trail. I didn't even know NY really had rattlesnakes. I have never seen one around the part of New York State where I live. The picture I took shows the rattles on his tail. I think there were 13, which would indicate he's about 12 years old. Over the last couple of days, I've seen some southbound thruhikers. They started in Maine and are headed toward Georgia. Seeing southbounders will become more numerous in the days ahead. When I've section hiked in the past, I've typically carried a couple of liter bottles of water. Now, I usually carry just one liter. When I fill the bottle up at water sources though, I drink as much as I possibly can. That allows for the liter I'm carrying to last longer and saves 2+ pounds of weight I don't want to be carrying on my shoulders. I do, however, really need to be aware of the availability of water up ahead and plan accordingly. All of my equipment has been holding up exceptionally well. I was concerned about my Thermarest NeoXair mattress and my Eureka Backcountry 1 tent, but both show no signs of deterioration. My second pair of Merrell shoes are starting to look beat up, but shoes are a consumable item on a thruhike on the AT. I'll be getting a new pair in a couple of weeks. Tomorrow I'll be passing the 1400 mile point, crossing Bear Mountain, and passing through the zoo at Bear Mountain State Park before crossing the Hudson River on the Bear Mountain bridge. There's a food concession at the zoo and that means hot dogs and ice cream. I can't wait!Until tomorrow......","Wildcat Shelter

I crossed the 1400 mile point, went up and over Bear Mountain and crossed the Hudson River. What was most important though was the great trail magic I experienced today. I was running low on food and didn't have a resupply plan. Even though I need to be in the small village of Stormville, NY on Monday to pick up a package, I don't thing there's a grocery store there - so I'd be out of luck. Since one of the campers at this campsite had to go back to his nearby house to give his diabetic cat an insulin shot, he volunteered to drive me to the local grocery store. The trail provides! It's very dry in this part on New York State and a lot of the water sources have dried up. I took advantage of the vending machines on top of Bear Mountain and later at Bear Mountain State Park to stay hydrated. I hope the water situation improves as I head north. The ironic thing is that where I live in Western NY it has been much wetter than normal. The trail over West Mountain and Bear Mountain was crowded with day hikers. Many of them picked bags of wild blueberries. I ate some blueberries, but the wild ones are so small. It just didn't seem to be worth the effort. Anyway, I'm back to the area on the AT that I've hiked before. That is reassuring because I know there's nothing that's too tough for me on this section of the trail, but that also reduces the chance for surprise.

I immediately plugged in my iPhone to charge (always the first thing), but then had breakfast #2. Orange juice, a cheese Danish, coffee, yogurt, and banana bread. What an amazing luxury. As Gernot and I sat there eating, a Jeep pulled up and out jumped City Kick, a hiker I hadn't seen in months. She's now section hiking with her dog. After hearing that Gernot needed to get to Stormville, NY tomorrow to pick up some new shoes, she said she'd drive us there in the morning. That will save us about 4 miles of non-trail walking. Again, the trail provides! Gernot and I had planned to camp for the night at Clarence Fahnestock State Park. When we got there, City Kick had already set up camp, had a beer and potato chips for us, and told us that a guy named Joe at site 11 was going to cook dinner for all the hikers! Wow!! Plus, there's free showers and one night of free camping at this park for AT hikers. After a day of hiking through two thunderstorms, all this trail magic was just what I needed. Gernot's shoes completely fell apart today. The big question for tomorrow is, ""Will Gernot's new shoes actually be at the Post Office and will they fit him?"".

They were there, but unfortunately they were too small. After talking to REI, they agreed to overnight ship the next size larger, which should be right. Free shipping and a 20% discount on the shoes because of the mixup sort of made up for our delay. City Kick also took us to Walmart to resupply our food. We didn't get back on the trail until after 1PM. That's ok since now we're at this shelter for the night. We'll only have a 5 mile hike and a 2 mile hitch to get back to the Stormville post office again tomorrow to get the new package of shoes from REI. My mileage plan for tomorrow is unknown - I can never predict how easy it will be to hitch a ride to and from a town. I'm only about a 2 days hike away from Connecticut and about 5 days from Massachusetts. The state count will be climbing soon. Unfortunately, so will the temperatures, which is always pretty tough on me and may slow me down. It's dry here in this area so I may need to carry extra water as well. I'm looking forward to a zero day or two with Mrs. Pockets in the not so distant future. I hope it doesn't create a crisis in my motivation to continue hiking, but I'm willing to chance it!

From there, we hitched into Stormville, NY to the post office to pick up Gernot's new shoes that REI said would be delivered overnight. Of course, they hadn't come in yet. I was pretty frustrated, had no idea what to do, there really wasn't anything close by in Stormville and I didn't want to wait around. It would be difficult to hitch back to Stormville tomorrow because we'd likely be 14-16 miles further ahead. The helpful postal worker came up with a solution - he would forward them on to Wingdale, NY. The shoes should be there tomorrow (hopefully). So we'll hike 12 miles tomorrow, hitch into Wingdale, get a motel room (showers, laundry, pizza, ice cream, etc) and pick up the shoes Thursday morning. I'm so ready for a shower after hiking in the heat these past few days. After we got all this figured out, we had to hitch from Stormville back to the AT. A police car pulled over nearby us - with its lights flashing. Hitch hiking is illegal in New York and we got caught! The police officers checked my ID to see if there are any arrest warrants out for me, but they didn't seem to know what to do with a German National that couldn't speak any English. Then they gave us a ride back to the AT and wished us a safe journey!! Maybe they're used to thruhikers hitchhiking near the AT and overlooked the illegality of it for us, but we were lucky for sure.

I hope the temperatures I encounter in Northern Connecticut and Massachusetts will be lower, especially at the higher elevations. It doesn't take much of a climb to get me soaking wet with sweat. The knats are still a problem, the mosquitoes less so, probably because it's been so dry here. We passed the famous Dover Oak Tree with a girth of 28 feet - the largest tree on the AT. My sister, Spyder, and my brother, Cotton, will be interested to know I saw no sign of 'Aunt Mary'. The path was very overgrown in this section - causing a concern about ticks.

Because of his lack of English and his unfamiliarity with American food, whatever I order, Gernot orders too. The only difference is that he really likes chocolate milk and usually has 3 of those, while I love my coffee. After my last cup of coffee, I called the post office to ask about the package. I was told, ""No, no express packages arrived today."" Deeply disappointed, I told her that it was only coming from Stormville and asked why was it taking so long? She said, ""Oh, you must be talking about the hiker box - yes it's here."" Finally! The post office was just a short walk from the bakery so we hurried right over, got the package and to make a long story short - Gernot now has his new hiking shoes. They are still about a half size smaller than his old ones, but he seems really pleased with them. We returned to the Dutchess Motor Lodge, packed up, and the owner shuttled us back to the AT - a very hot trail. After 5 miles and a steep climb, we were once again soaked in sweat.

I came out here thinking that hiking from Georgia to Maine would not only be very challenging, but I might not take the most safe, easiest, or guaranteed way to get there. Although on life or death decisions out here, I do recommend making the safe choice! I crossed the 1, 500 mile point - only 689.2 miles to go! Riga Shelter, where I'm at right now, is about 4 miles from the Massachusetts state line. I'll add that state to the roster tomorrow morning. Right off the bat, I'll need to climb Mount Race, Mount Everett, and Mount Bushnell. My climbing muscles, which haven't been used much since Virginia, will be forced back into service. I expect them to complain loudly. They let me know they were not happy today as I climbed Bear Mountain! There's a great easterly view from Riga Shelter. Usually I tent at shelter sites, but tonight I'm in the shelter. I expect to see a great sunrise in the morning. Until tomorrow.....","Pine Swamp Brook Shelter (in CT)

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/508802,"Day 119 - Our climbing muscles screamed today as we crossed over 4 mountains - Bear, Race, Everett, and Bushnell. Today's original plan had been to hike 15 - 17 miles, camp for the night, get up and hike 8 - 10 miles in the A.M. before Mrs. Pockets would pick up me and Gernot somewhere along Rte. 23. A lack of suitable camping spots, hot weather, and ravenous mosquitoes forced us to reconsider that plan. We nearly ran the last 4 miles today trying to outrace a big swarm of mosquitoes chasing after us. Binjali, a guy we've been hiking with for a few days, suggested the 3 of us split a room at the Days Inn in Great Barrington. Taking two zero days (zero = no hiking) instead of the planned one zero day will give our joints, tendons, and my calorie deficiency a chance to recuperate. So here I am at the Days Inn - nice and comfortable for the night in an air conditioned, no mosquito room while waiting for Mrs. Pockets to arrive tomorrow. This part of the trail is special for me, though, because it is where my brother 'Cotton', my sister 'Spyder', and I did our first section hike in 2004. I was surprised to find that I had forgotten how beautiful Sages Ravine is - it's now one of my favorite places on the trail. It was here that we met hikers Dharma, No Dog, and No Beard - our first true interaction with thruhikers. Our packs were heavy that year, nearly 50 pounds. In spite of that, we caught the AT hiking bug while hiking this section and we've section hiked together every year since then. Those hikes led directly to my thruhike this year. They say a thruhike changes you. I don't know if I've changed - people who really know me may be a better judge of that. In any event, there's a lot more trail to be hiked. I've surprised myself at how far I've come. I thought my knees, feet, ankles or something else would have forced me off the trail by now. They still might, but the prospects of finishing are looking pretty darn good. Thanks, dear readers, for all of your encouragement!!","Riga Shelter

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/508878,"Day 120 - A zero day in Great Barrington, MA and Manchester, CT. Since it would take Mrs. Pockets several hours to drive from our home near Canandaigua, NY to Great Barrington, MA, Gernot and I had the rare opportunity to sleep in late at the Days Inn. That was followed by a large, leisurely breakfast at a local diner, a stroll around town and a sample of the wares of the ice cream store. Great Barrington is a nice little town with friendly residents. I'd like to revisit it again sometime in the future. After Mrs. Pockets arrived and introductions to Gernot and Binjali were made, Mrs. Pockets, Gernot and I headed toward Manchester, CT to visit my sister 'Spyder' and her family. Mrs. Pockets had downloaded the same translator as Gernot's to her phone. They chatted away the miles as we drove. I heard lots of laughter whenever the translator messed up and created some very odd messages. Shortly after settling in at my sister's house, our conversations turned back to the AT. Spyder and my brother 'Cotton' are leaving for a week long southbound section hike between New Hampshire and Vermont later this week. Right now, Gernot and I are hiking through a section of the trail my siblings and I have hiked before. They don't really want to repeat it and I don't really want to jump ahead. So unfortunately, we'll not be hiking together this year. There was just enough time before dinner to get in a quick trip to a nearby outfitter store to look for some needed replacements. A very pretty sunset view from their deck followed happy hour and a great home cooked meal by Spyder's husband, Tom. And zero again tomorrow...","Rt. 7 near Great Barrington, MA @ mile 1521

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/508911,"Dear Readers: This is Mrs. Pockets here. Apparently, Pockets is under the impression that if he takes a zero day that also includes me, he doesn't have to do his own journal entry for that day! Imagine that! It has a somewhat familiar ring to it, but all in all, I really don't mind. Pockets needs to rest. Today was a really fun day. It's always a treat to visit with 'Spyder' and her family, but today was extra special because Gernot was with us. None of us speak German, so that wonderful google translator surely saved us from looking like a bunch of monkeys or like we were constantly playing a game of charades as we tried to talk to Gernot. After chocolate milk for Gernot and coffee for us, Spyder and I cooked up a big breakfast of bacon, scrambled eggs, and toast for all. Then it was off to REI to get the few remaining gear replacement items Pockets needed and more shoes for Gernot. This time, though, they were a pair of Keen rugged sandals, which Gernot must have decided would be better for fording rivers than the strapless crocs he carries. When Pockets had tried to explain to Gernot where Spyder's house was located, Gernot asked if he could see the Atlantic Ocean. So we hopped in the car again and took off for Stonington, CT, a pretty little seaport village. The movie Hope Springs (Steve Carell, Meryl Streep, Tommy Lee Jones) was filmed there. There's more photos of Stonington on Pockets' photo page. We got back to Spyder's house in time for happy hour, another great home cooked meal by Spyder's husband Tom, and again a lovely sunset.

That plan fell apart - who voluntarily gets up that early? After getting on the road back to Great Barrington at 6:30 am, hunger hit us. We stopped for breakfast at a cafe in Stockbridge, MA and didn't make it back to the trail until 9:00 am. Gernot and I set off north into a fairly easy section of the trail. It had only a couple of significant climbs and a number of pine forests, which are easy on the feet. I was wearing my new, un-broken-in shoes so I was concerned about blisters. Fortunately none developed. In spite of the late start, we still did a respectable number of miles today. We crossed paths with a number of southbound thruhikers. They said they've been on the trail for about 50 days now. I hope I can finish in less time than that since those 50 days included their 'low miles getting acclimated to the trail' days similar to what the northbounders have when starting in Geogia. They also said that the White Mountains of New Hampshire aren't as bad as people fear because the trail is well maintained. All music to my ears! Looking ahead, I'll be climbing Mount Greylock and heading into Vermont this weekend so I am making some nice progress.

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/509026,"Day 123 - Today was very special for me because I got to revisit some of my favorite places on the AT - Upper Goose Pond Cabin, the walkway over I-90, and the Cookie Lady's House. When I section hiked in Massachusetts in 2004, some of my siblings and I spent the night at Upper Goose Pond Cabin. We went swimming and canoeing on the lake, listened to the stories of the caretaker, and ate his treasured blueberry pancakes in the morning. The I-90 AT walkway is a favorite spot because I drive under it so often. Just as I did in 2004, I walked over it today. The 'Cookie Lady' has been giving away homemade cookies to hikers for 30 years. She and her husband also sell hard boiled eggs, blueberries, and sodas: all hiker favorites. They allow camping on their property and provide a spigot for water. Gernot and I are staying here tonight. Roy and Marilyn are true Trail Angels!! In spite of the shorter daylight hours, I still seem to have my 20 mile mojo working. That may help me and Gernot get to Katahdin by the middle of next month. The southbounders I've talked to say it's definitely doable. That gives us hope that Gernot can make it too as his visa expires about that time. The great weather continues - highs in the 70s are rare in August in these parts, but that's what's in the forecast for the next several days. I intend to take maximum advantage of it. When Gernot and I were zeroing at my sister's house in CT a couple of days ago, a huge storm hit the section I'm in now. There were reports of hail, high winds, severe lightening, and a drenching rain. We've encountered quite a few downed trees across the trail from that storm. We were lucky to have missed it. In spite of that, I'm appreciative of the overall good weather this year. Don't know where I'll end up tomorrow - I'll let you know in my next update.","Shaker Campsite @ 1538.6

What was remarkable about today was how much food I managed to eat. I started with half a bag of granola for breakfast (1000 calories), a cheesesteak bomb overload sub for lunch (3000+ calories), a large dish of ice cream, a huge steak dinner at The Bass Works Grill (another 3000+ calories), 2 beers and another 600 or 700 calories in power bars during the day. I'd better watch it or my weight might climb to 225 pounds again! The weather remains exceptionally nice - at least until Tuesday, when it will almost certainly rain. When Gernot and I were taking a couple of zero days at my sister's house, her husband, Tom, did a great job of temporarily fixing up Gernot's backpack. It's held up quite well. The manufacturer is sending Gernot a replacement part. We will pick that up tomorrow in Williamstown at the Willow Motel and resupply our food for the journey into Vermont.

That part of the day went according to plan, but then the plan just all fell apart. After eating lunch at Bascom Lodge at the top of Mt. Greylock, I thought maybe I should reserve a room at the Willow Motel. We'd have to go there to pick up the replacement frame sheet for Gernot's backpack. There were no rooms available at that motel or at any place else in Williamstown or North Adams. I didn't have a 'Plan B' and my mind freezes over when that happens. When it unfroze, I decided we'd hike to North Adams, hitch into Williamstown, get the part, then hike on to Sherman Brook Campsite. Then we could resupply in Bennington, VT tomorrow. Fortunately, Gernot and I had enough food for that to work out. As it turned out though, we didn't even need to hitch into Williamstown. Right where the trail enters North Adams, there's a house that offers free bicycles to hikers to get to town. Gernot and I hopped on the bikes, rode to Williamstown to get the part, stopped at Dunkin Donuts for a snack, returned the bikes, and hiked on to the campsite. Mission accomplished! Right now, we're about 5 miles from the Vermont state line and about 6 miles from the 1600 mile point of this journey.

The hiking today was fairly easy until the descent to Rt. 9 at the end of the day. It was a steep, long, rocky drop. By the end of it, my knees were screaming at me. I should have taken some ibuprofen (vitamin I), but didn't think of it until too late. The motel we're staying at in Bennington picked us up at Rt. 9 and soon I was showered, dressed in clean clothes and off to the Dollar General for resupply. I had a great dinner tonight of nachos, soup, grilled chicken, garlic potatoes, and asparagus. I topped it off with chocolate mousse pie alamode. Tomorrow, I'll start off with a big climb.

I didn't get on the trail until after 9 am because that's when the free bus leaves Bennington. On the bright side though, that did give Gernot and me time to have a great breakfast in town. We got to Kid Gore Shelter about 5 pm today. Ordinarily, I would have kept going for another 1.5 or 2 hours, but I wanted a space inside the shelter because of the weather forecast. Shelters fill up fast when it rains. No one wants to pack up a wet tent in the rain! So 14.4 miles it is. I'll likely be hiking in heavy rain tomorrow with wet feet (damn!). I don't expect to set any mileage records tomorrow either. The forecast calls for an 80% chance of rain, but maybe I'll get lucky and the sun will come out. There's a big climb up Stratton Mountain tomorrow. I'll be approaching 4000 ft - haven't been that high up in quite a while. Not much else to report today.

I tried and failed several times before deciding that I had to be an adult and get moving. Starting a day in the rain is never easy, but at least I didn't need to pack up a wet tent. I didn't know if Gernot and I would make it to Stratton Pond Shelter as planned because of this weather. Stratton Pond Shelter is a nice one and is large, so it became the goal for today. There was a big climb up Stratton Mountain - it took an hour and a half to make it to the top. Then the rain changed to a slight drizzle and it was only 3 more miles downhill to the shelter. We did that in an hour, but to my dismay, the shelter was very crowded. Fortunately, we managed to find two small spots and quickly claimed them. I hate crowded shelters. Trying to cook and organize my stuff is difficult enough in a shelter. With everyone else's stuff strewn all over the place, it's even worse.

Everyone was trying to pack up and eat breakfast at the same time. There are no skylights or windows in this shelter so everyone was using their head lamps as well. Such is life in a large popular shelter. The morning walk was fairly easy. I finally caught up to Scout and Tumbles, a 19 yr. old boy hiking the AT with his 16 yr. old sister. Tumbles makes artistic entries in the shelter registers that always made me laugh. They are quite an inspiration hiking the AT at such a young age. In the afternoon, I climbed over two mountains: Bromley Mountain (a mountain ski resort) and Peru Peak. It was sunny most of the day - a welcome change from yesterday. Just after I got to Peru Peak Shelter all hell broke loose with a large, loud thunderstorm. Gernot and I couldn't have timed our arrival better.

In addition, there's a bus that stops there and provides a ride into Rutland. In all likelihood, that means LUNCH as well. We can do a resupply in Rutland and then return to the trail. We had a good hiking day today. I finally ran into BonBon. She has hiked with Katwalk and with my sister, No Spring Chicken. We passed the Cairn Rock Garden. It's beyond description - you need to look at the photos. We also caught up to 4Be. I've hiked with him on several occasions only to have him get ahead when I've taken zeros for one reason or another. Tomorrow, I should pass the '500 miles to Katahdin' marker. That seems like a lot of miles still, but it feels like just a month ago, I passed the '1000 miles to Katahdin' point. My right shoulder still hurts, but there's not much I can do about it except take ibuprofen - at least I didn't injure it again today. Gernot is teaching me to count in German. It makes communicating a lot easier, especially when talking about distances, i.e. how far to the shelter, how far we've come, etc. I'm a slow learner and am having a particular problem with the number 5. I think it is something like 'femth'. We're moving out of the deer tick infestation zone so the risk of Lyme disease is rapidly decreasing - one less thing to be concerned about.

We were joined by BonBon, C.shell, and D.no. Then we split the cost of a shuttle into Rutland, where Gernot and I were able to resupply at Walmart. We had lunch at The Yellow Deli Cafe/Hiker Hostel in Rutland and caught up with Pocket Spider, Macdaddy, Sloppy Mud, Hollywood, and a couple of other hikers in our hiker bubble. The cafe/hostel is run by 60's style flower children. It's a commune type environment based on a religious organization called The Twelve Tribes. There was a low key pitch to join them or at least stay and work there for a few days. Lots of hikers do stay there overnight and even longer, but we needed to get back to the trail. A retired military 'trail angel' gave us a ride back to the AT. For most of the ride, he vented about the hippies and liberals in town that he thinks are ruining the economy of Rutland. I didn't take the conversational bait, after all he was kind enough to give us a ride. Besides, if he found out that I'm pretty liberal, he just might have kicked me out of his car! In spite of his concern, Rutland seems like a great city. I saw no sign of it being ruined.

To make it even more of a challenge, it was raining when I woke up. Now in case you forgot, I'm nursing a sore shoulder on top of that. Even though the rain did stop before I started out, it had rained long enough that the rocks were slippery and the trail was a muddy mess.

Check it out on my photos page. Spyder's husband Tom picked us up about 10 minutes after we made it to Rt. 4. Then Tom, Spyder, Cotton, Gernot, and I had a long, relaxing, and delicious lunch at the Inn.

The low miles yesterday and the thought of a shower and clean clothes were clouding my judgment. I made it through the last 5 miles powered not by just the thought of food, but by visions of ice cream. I was also pretty worried because my sweat was smelling like ammonia, which meant I was burning muscle and essentially starving myself. But, unknown to me at that time, there's a hostel just a couple hundred yards from where the AT crosses Rt 12. The hostel owner, Dan, saw Gernot and me with our thumbs in the air trying to hitch a ride into Woodstock. He stopped and invited us to stay at his hostel, but said he and his friend were heading to Silver Lake to go for a swim. So we went along with them. It was as good or better than any shower. On the way back to the hostel, Dan stopped at a farm market to get some fresh vegetables. Gernot started picking out all sorts of stuff. I told Dan that Gernot is a chef in Germany. Dan was more than willing to let Gernot prepare dinner for all of us - sautéed vegetables, corn on the cob, barbeque chicken, edible flowers, beer, and ice cream.

After a minor resupply at CVS and finally heading back to the trail, I noticed a mention of Tigger's Tree House in AWOL's trail guide book. I thought staying in a real tree house would be pretty cool, so I called the number and made a reservation. Now it turns out that the 'tree house' isn't really a tree house. It's a motor home (non-drivable) in the backyard of the owner. It does come with access to the downstairs of the owner's house for showers, laundry, cooking, TV, computer, WIFI, and a hiker box full of food and other good stuff. Hiker sleeping quarters are in the motor home. Chef Gernot whipped up a good dinner for us from food odds and ends from the hiker box.

Moosilauke, the typical start of the hike is at 1800' Kinsman Notch heading south, climbing up a very steep 3000' to the summit of Mt. Moosilauke to 4800', and then descending 3800' to NH Rt. 25. I tend to find it easier to climb a very steep, rocky trail than descend such a path, especially so if it's been raining and the rocks are slick like they were today. After the hostel owner dropped us off at Kinsman Notch, Gernot and I planned to hike 9.5 miles south back to the hostel. This took almost 7 hours (10 am - 5 pm). The climb up was not a path at all. It was a set of occasional white blazes on rocks, indicating which rocks needed to be scaled on the route to the top. The hike down the south side was more conventional, less steep and longer. This was my introduction to the White Mountains of New Hampshire. It became readily apparent to me today that with my injured shoulder and bad knee, I really wasn't in good enough condition to hike through the Whites. I was relying on and was too heavily dependent on my trekking poles. If I continued on in this manner - in the most challenging part of the AT - it would be foolhardy and potentially dangerous. It's easy enough to fall on the AT when one's at 100% and I wasn't at 100% at all. So at this point, @ mile 1799.8, I will mark the end of my 2015 AT adventure. As luck would have it, a bunch of German hikers had arrived at the hostel just as I shared my decision with Gernot. They chatted away like long lost buddies. Hopefully, Gernot and his German friends will be able to reach Katahdin before their visas run out. I might return to finish the AT next year, possibly starting in July and finishing in early August. I'm a little wary to start planning that - time will tell. It may give me the incentive I need to stay in shape though. I'd like to thank all of you who offered me encouragement along the way. I couldn't have done this without the support of my wonderful wife, who maintained this journal and kept our home front together. It's been a hell of a ride and a wonderful experience. The only piece of advice I have for aspiring AT thruhikers is: Don't wait until you're 62 to do it! Now that I'm back home, life is slowly returning to normal. I'm continuing to wake up at 2:00 am wondering what shelter I'm at. Then I come to the realization - I'm in my own bed, in my own home.Until next year.....","NH Rt. 25 @ mile 1790.3

Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/516284,"Dear Readers: This is Mrs. Pockets here - As you may recall, Pockets reluctantly got off the AT on August 21st @ mile 1799.8 due to repeated falls on his right shoulder as well as a bothersome knee. His knee was better with a week of rest. In spite of a clean x-ray, a month of physical therapy and a cortisone shot, his shoulder was not. An MRI revealed a torn rotator cuff and Pockets had surgery for that last week. Although it was a tough decision to get off the trail with only 389.4 miles to Mt. Katahdin, I'm sure glad he stopped when he did. Pockets said he didn't regret his attempt at a thru-hike for a moment - it was an incredible adventure. He has plans to hike with some of his siblings in Washington State next summer and is still considering returning to the AT in 2016 to finish up his hike.Some have asked us about Gernot, the non-English speaking German guy (trail name Tonreg), Pockets hiked with through several states. Some other journals noted that Gernot summited Mt. Katahdin before the expiration of his visa. We've communicated with Gernot's family, who confirmed that he did complete his hike and has safely returned to Germany.
Update 10/28/15 - Gernot's family just sent us a couple of photos of Gernot summiting Katahdin. Check them out on Pocket's photo page.",,View Entry,"Oct 25, Sun",0
Pockets,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607095,"After I left the trail in 2015 because of a torn rotator cuff, I assumed that I would complete my hike in 2016.  Well, for lots of reasons that didn't happen, but the good news is that finally this year I will attempt to complete my hike.  I won't start at Mt. Moosilauke where I ended my 2015 attempt;  I won't be in shape for that.  Instead, I will start about July 1st where the trail trail crosses from Conn to Mass.  Re-hiking Mass, Vt, and the part of Vt up to Mt. Moosilauke will allow me to get my trail legs and lose some weight/get back into shape before hitting the Whites (and besides, I really like the trail in Mass.  It's not that I'm grossly out of shape; I've been hitting the gym, but my trail weight should be between 195 and 205 pounds and right now I'm at about 215 +/-.  Since leaving the trail I've become a vegan and I'm not sure I can get enough calories on the trail on just a vegan diet.  I had a real problem losing too much weight on Part 1 of my hike, even though I ate as much food (of all kinds) as I could.   I may need to become a 'flexitarian' for the 2 months this hike will take.  My pack should be a little lighter - switching from a Jetboil to a Esbit fueled ultralight stove which should save about 1 pound, and I may jettison my trusty Eureka Backcountry 1 tent (about 4 pounds) for a Big Agnes Flycreek HV UL1 (2 pounds 1oz) or a Nemo Hornet Elite 1P (less than 2 pounds).  Three pounds is a LOT.  So, 4 1/2 months out, everything is a 'Go' for Part 2.","
