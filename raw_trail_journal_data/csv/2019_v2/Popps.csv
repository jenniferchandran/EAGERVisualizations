Popps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605526,"Took a short hike (6.6 mi) to and around Bear Lake in the Blackwater River State Forest to test new gear:Osprey Atmos 65 (lightly loaded to 18 lbs) with rain coverREI Drypoint rain jacketOboz Sawtooth trail shoesEnlightened Equipment rain wrapSnowpeak canister stoveToaks titanium mugDIY pot and pouch coziesDIY rain mittsDirty Girl gaitersSince it is hunting season I wore a blaze orange cap and draped the orange vest over my pack even though hunting is not allowed around Bear Lake. I am NOT a deer! The weather was perfect for testing rain gear, 55°with rain and wind. The jacket was superb! I never got clammy or overheated. Full disclosure commands that I confess the trail is basically flat with a few roots so not challenging; I moved at a 2.5-3 mph pace. The rain wrap also performed well. I wore it with the overlap behind me and never felt constricted. The material did not cling to my shorts or legs. Many puddles on the trail of course so wet feet were expected. I had Injinji toed socks under Darn Tough socks in the Oboz and felt perfectly comfortable. Not really needed in the cool weather yet I had to try out the rain mitts I made from James Hardie® house wrap. They were comfortable and worked well too.Stopped at a vacant group site on the east side of the lake for lunch. The stove boiled a cup of water in under 3 minutes then added it to a pouch of mashed potatoes with some bacon bits for added flavor. Note to self; Stir thoroughly! A cup of Via coffee and a Snickers completed a great lunch on a cool day by the lake.The pack rode nicely. Though only lightly packed, it was enough to make the small tweaks and adjustments for comfort.Lessons learned: Pouch cozies fly when left lying on the windy table! Tuck the open top of the jacket under the pack strap to keep it out of the face. Lubricate the zippers on new pack.",,"Bear Lake in Blackwater Forest State Park, FL Panhandle","Nov 13, Tue",6.60
Popps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605566,"Yay, my quilts arrived from Hammock Gear!! I will be hammock camping on the AT and with an early March start there WILL be some cold nights. I have camped in a hammock before but not in freezing weather so was excited (nervous?) to see if quilts work.Both quilts are from Hammock Gear and rated at 20°. The top quilt is the Burrow with goose down. It has a zippered foot box and then lays flat unlike a sleeping bag that forms a tube. The under quilt is the Econ Incubator with 1 oz overstuff of duck down. Overstuffing adds a bit more fill which helps reduce the heat loss to convection. An under quilt snugs up to the hammock and has shock cords around the edge to form a pouch.I set up before dark so as to have everything adjusted properly. The forecast called for cold weather, well Florida cold anyway, the low was to be 32°. Brrr!! Being paranoid of freezing even though my warm house was only 50' away, I wore base top/bottom, wool socks, beanie, insulated jacket and fleece neck gaiter. Also filled my nalgene with hot water and wrapped it in a bandana.Darkness fell along with the temperature and I was ready! Off to the unknown I trekked with headlamp and book in hand. Got settled in and the little thermometer hanging from the ridge line showed 38°. Within 20 minutes though, the jacket and gaiter came off, it was too warm! The jacket went over the foot end of the top quilt while the gaiter was put to good use in insulating the nalgene at my feet. ZzzzzzzzzzzzzzWoke about 5:00 am after a great sleep, not cold at anytime. Temp was 31°. Yesssss, below freezing! Ha, I lived!!Slid out of my hanging nest and inside to hot coffee. So quilts confirmed. If the temp had been colder or windy or both, the insulated jacket, gaiter, and maybe gloves would provide a supplement. The water in the nalgene was 100°, nice and warm.",,View Entry,"Nov 27, Tue",0

Popps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605653,"Joined the trail crew of the Western Gate chapter of the Florida Trail to do maintenance work today. Laid some logs and added wood chips over a couple of wet spots, then cut off boot stopping stubs of small saplings from recent clearing. Beautiful day to go play in the woods; sunny and 40°- 50°.",,View Entry,"Dec 06, Thu",0
Popps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606339,"It seems the days are flying by now since 2019 began!So the countdown checklist includes:Eye appointment - get some really durable lenses and framesAssemble and begin filling the supply boxes with non-food items for target datesSubscribe to Iridium network for InReachMake final decision on GoPro vs phone for videoPre-order prescription medsMake reservations in GA - Done!!Make stretching a habit every morningTreat fabrics with permethrinFine tune hammock & tarp suspensionsCancel online subscriptions that will not be used for a whileFind a company to cut the grassThe gear list is the easiest part of planning for me because it is tangible. The physical effort I can anticipate. This is not a race and going slowly at first is okay. Nutrition and hydration needs have been thoroughly tested during many marathons and triathlons. Even though the races lasted for just a few hours (hmm, 16 hrs for Ironman is more than a few, ha ha) the concepts are similar.The difficult items are the mental challenges. The effects of days of rain or cold, depending upon new people for companionship, letting go of new friends as the trail dictates, separation from family, meeting my goal on Shatterproof to help change the conversation regarding substance use disorder (addiction), seeing a mountain 'just over there' and knowing it will take days to reach it and monotony of doing the same thing everyday for six months. I hope that by just voicing the concerns they will be lessened, or at least more easily resolved.So 55 days to go!",,View Entry,"Jan 10, Thu",0
Popps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606465,"TW is a fellow hiker in the FL panhandle and we met for lunch today in Pensacola to get acquainted. Great guy! It was nice to share the same anticipation, anxiety, and excitement for a March start at Springer. With only a couple of weeks separating our step-offs, it is a sure thing we will see each other on the long walk north.The ATC registration chart shows 21 people starting on Mar 6. I am guessing that is about half or maybe even only a third of the actual number. Given that most will start early in the morning, there will be a lot of folks climbing the steps together.The Garmin InReach Mini arrived yesterday. Amazing technology in a very small package! For comparison, I had a 'bag phone' years ago that weighed five pounds and we thought then it was so cool. The InReach is key to my wife giving her okie-dokie for the hike. I can certainly manage to send an ""I'm alive! LU"" note everyday.",,View Entry,"Jan 15, Tue",0
Popps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606709,"We do not get many cold nights in FL so when one does come along it must be used. While record low temps were being suffered north of us, we barely hit 30° here. Even so I set up the tarp in wind-cold mode with steep pitch and doors closed on my WB Mountain Fly. Slept very comfortably in the hammock with 20° top and under quilts. The moderate cold did sap my iPhone battery though! Will have to keep it with my hiking clothes layered between the hammock and under quilt. 
35 days to go!",,View Entry,"Jan 30, Wed",0
Popps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607014,"TW (starting north later in March) and I went for an overnight trip in the Blackwater State Forest north of Pensacola. We were expecting (and hoping for!) the rain that was forecast to arrive overnight. Alas, there was not enough to disturb the pollen on my tarp. Two unseasonably warm days of hiking in the 70°'s made for a sweaty, though productive trip. My pack weight with 2 liters of water and 5 days of food tipped the scale at 34 pounds. After tightening the hip belt way more, it rode nicely. It is still hunting season so a blaze orange hat was necessary. Cheapo hat from Wally World does NOT breathe well at all. Better that than an overanxious hunter ventilating my cranium though!Three weeks to Amicalola!!",,View Entry,"Feb 12, Tue",0

Popps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607642,"I registered yesterday at the Amicalola Falls AT&T office, my hiker number is 575.
Susan from the Atlanta shatterproof office and her husband came up to give me a sendoff. I really appreciated her being there and her support.
I also met Conductor, and Mountain Dew and his lovely wife at the visitors center. They are both starting today as well.
Had a nice dinner last night with my bride of 37 years and a good nights sleep and preparation for stepping off today.

Popps,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607904,"The bubble is moving on without me, and I am moving on with the priorities in my life that were made clear on the AT.The trail is spectacular! Tooling along the side of a mountain in fog-shrouded trees is ethereal. The perfectly clear sky while at the top of Springer Mt was glorious. Rock hopping and log bridges make crossing cold mountain streams a treat. The HIKING is perfect.So many journals, videos, and blogs detail the ascents and descents, the views, the weather, and the bugs. The basic housekeeping necessities were what caused me to evaluate how I wanted to spend the next six months however. Making camp, breaking camp, making camp, breaking camp; spending the majority of the 24 hours in camp is where I was not prepared. The sore muscles will fade as legs develop; the tedium (to me) of living outside will stay the same. I slept beautifully in my hammock, high and dry off the ground, and the rest of my kit performed equally well. So for ME, I chose to leave the trail to pursue other activities that will be a better use of my time in the next six months. It is said to only the leave the trail on a good day. I did that. David and I spent a great day hiking in cool, foggy mountain air while sharing our life stories.I wish TW, David, Conductor, Legacy, Sophie, Nicole, Mountain Dew, Tabasco, Tortoise, and all the others Fair Skies and Solid Steps!",,View Entry,"Mar 11, Mon",0
