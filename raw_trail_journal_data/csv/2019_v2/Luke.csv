Luke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583521,"In 2015, I attempted a thru hike and failed miserably, quitting after just 80 miles due to an injury. I was preparing to return in 2016 for a second attempt, but as life has a tendency to do, I was thrown a curve ball when medical issues forced me to change my plans.
In 2017, I sectioned hiked about 400 miles of the AT finishing in Grayson Highlands Virginia. This is where I will begin my 2018 hike on March 17. My plans are not in concrete. I will hike to Katahdin at which point I will be a successful AT section hiker. I will then decide if I want to flip flop back to Virginia, and hike south for a true thru hike of the AT.

Luke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583523,"I have completed 503 miles of the AT and pretty much have my gear down. Since it may be cold and wet in Virginia in March, I am adding some Possum gloves and socks. They are supposed to be excellent at repelling water. I am also switching from my Jet Boil stove to an MSR pocket rocket. The Jet Boil is great, but I'm looking to shed some weight. My base weight will be close to 13 pounds unless I decide to add some extra cold weather gear, depending what the weather looks like. I am also adding a Big Sky International pillow. It is a 1.4 ounce blow up pillow. I have always used my clothes stuff sack as a pillow, but on a recommendation thought I would give it a try. I'll let you know the verdict. 

I have added most of my gear to the gear section.

Two young ladies out for a weekend hike were already there. Being St. Patrick’s day they had brought with them some Guinness and Jamesons. Chops Sticks, an x marine showed up a little later and we helped the girls with their Irish treats.

Luke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584586,"SAS (Slow and Steady) and I hit the trail around 9:00. Since we’re keeping the miles short until we get our hiking legs, it was easy to stay in a warm sleeping bag. We had an 800 foot climb first thing to get the blood flowing. The next 8 miles was fairly easy with just a few short climbs, then we hit the final 2 miles which was straight downhill with lots of rocks. Arrived at an empty Trimpi Shelter around five. Set up camp, made dinner and called it an early night. Patches showed up around 9:00 after a 23 mile day. He is trying to reach Katahdin by the end of July as he will start Med school in the fall.

Had a quick breakfast, including bacon. This is pre cooked and doesn’t have to be refrigerated...who knew!  Patches was just beginning to stir... must have been the bacon. Start of hike was down hill followed by 4 miles uphill. Nothing too steep and followed a ridge line. One advantage of hiking this time of the year is that there are more views.  The leaf less trees made for a nice afternoon on the ridge. Did not see another hiker on the trail the entire day except for my hiking buddy SAS. We arrived at the Partnership shelter around 3:00. This has got to be one of the nicer shelters which is a good thing since they don’t allow camping. Patches arrived shortly after and began making dinner before he hiked on another 8 miles to the next shelter...that man is on a mission! The shelter is a couple hundred yards from the Mount Rogers Pat Jennings Visitor Center. We headed over to check things out, warm up and use a real bathroom. It was very nice but the highlight for hikers is Pizza delivery from a nearby town.  An hour later we were feasting on a large sausage pizza, bread sticks, and salad...not bad! Mess from Detroit showed up a bit later. He started Feb. 2nd and had spent some cold nights on the trail. Went to sleep around 9:00. A hiker showed up around 10:30 but didn’t find out it was Steady Eddie until the following day as he was still sleeping when we left in the morning.","Trimpi Shelter

As it turned out it didn’t rain all day but was cold and windy. A couple of short but very steep climbs over the first few miles. Two twenty something NOBOs slack packers flew by us on one of the uphills. More proof youth is wasted on the young.  We picked up a 4 legged hiking buddy today. He didn’t have a collar but looked in good health. He hung with us until we hit town at which point he took off.  Checked into the Travel Inn... you get what you pay for, enough said. It snowed less than an inch overnight in town but the mountains got around 6”.","Partnership Shelter

We had shipped resupply boxes to the Comfort Inn. The AWOL guide said they accepted them. Unfortunately, they changed their policy and took them to the Post Office. The PO cannot hold packages that are returned by the recepient, so they were returned back home the day we arrived. Off to Ingles to resupply.

Luke,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584785,"We got a ride to VA 42 in order to slack packed southbound 12.5 miles back to Atkins in anticipation of another snowstorm coming tomorrow. Our shuttle driver was a very nice women with an interesting background. Over the 40 minute ride to the trail head, she shared some of her life's story. She was raised in NC, where she was married at the age of 14. Her husband convinced her that she did not need to go to high school. After a failed first marriage, she remarried. Over the years her husband spent some time in prison. Her older son is currently in prison. She is caring for a 7 year old girl whose mother is doing five years in prison. The young girls family is not wiling to care for her, but does see her once or twice a month. She is a religious women and has a good outlook on life. I am not including this information to judge these people, but rather to share their stories and to keep in mind that many of us are very fortunate and often forget or choose to forget that some people have difficult lives. 
We were dropped off at the trail head around 9:00am to below freezing conditions. We took off quickly to keep warm. We hiked through a nice valley with farms, then next to a river before we started our ascent. As we climbed higher, the snow got deeper where eventually we were hiking in over a foot of snow. Once over the summit, we dropped down quickly and got out of snow. It was like walking through two climates today, with cold and wind on the northern side of the hills and calm and warmth from the sun on the southern side. Ran into Jeep and Hard Knocks hiking north. Also, came across five guys out for a section hike that didn’t know about the upcoming storm, but said they had the gear to handle it. The last few miles back into Atkins was through rolling farm land. Nice to be out of the woods in the warm sun. It’s nice of the owners to provide access through their property. Probably will zero another day. Too many zeros, but don’t want to be out in snow storms. Weather outlook improving on Sunday with spring like temps later in the week...finally!","Atkins Va

If that wasn’t tough enough, there were well over a hundred trees down on the trail from the wet heavy snow. That and the snow slowed our pace. It took 9 hours to trek the 12.5 miles to the shelter. The challenge was well worth it. The shelter is of the enclosed variety with four walls a door and windows. It was a welcome sight as temperatures were going to drop below 30 with high winds. First thing we did was warm our feet by drying them and jumping into our sleeping bags. It took about an hour to warm up. Light dinner as we were too tired to do much else. Started getting dark and we headed to bed. My 20 degree ZPack kept me warm all night. Didn’t see anyone all day. The five section hikers that we had ran in to two days earlier and had warned them about the upcoming storm apparently had a rough time. They had written in the shelter log book, that if it wasn't for getting to the shelter when they did they might not have made it.","Va 42

All three disipated once they got over us. That was a waste of time, however it did allow    the temperature to go up a bit. We put on our frozen shoes and hit the trail knowing that nothing had really changed from the previous day.  We were right. Slow going due to deep snow. Fortunately, there were very few trees downed on the trail unlike the previous day. As the temps increased, the snow softened and became treacherous not knowing what was below it. A number of times you would step thru the soft snow and slip on the rock below. SAS took two spills, no injuries.  We were planning to go 10.5 miles to the next shelter, but with the late start, and still recovering from the previous day we decided to take a nero.

We stayed in the main house in very nice rooms. Some people think the name has a religious connotation, but nothing more than the traveling saint reference. Snow melt from the previous day made hiking much better, not quite back to normal yet. We got to Jenkins shelter and decided to go another 4 miles to a stealt camp site next to a river.

This is my last resupply. Resupply is good and bad.

The rest of the day, depending on which side of the mountain you were on was either nice or high winds and cold. Ran into Research. She hiked the first 500 miles with her Great Pyrenees dog but decided it would be best to take him home last week. Also met Freek Out from Belgium. Freek is his actual name, but the pronunciation is Freik in his home country, so he adapted the American pronunciation. He is a freek, hiking 30 miles a day. Mongo, the owner of Lick Skillet Hostel picked us up after a 13 plus mile day...you can’t make this stuff up.  The hostel is an old converted church. Mongo is a great guy and the hostel is very nice with a outdoor hot shower and he even does your laundry.

Five miles in, we road hiked the half mile to Trent’s Grocery to have lunch and try the hamburger their well known for. It didn’t live up to its reputation. Had a better burger at Bushy Mountain Outpost a few days earlier. Still, it was a nice change from trail lunch. Hiked to Wapiti Shelter to spend the night. No one else was there as some hikers are a bit leary to stay. In 1981, two hikers were killed by a local man. He only did 15 years for the murders as part of a plea bargain. A few years later, after leaving prison, just one half miles from the Wapiti Shelter he struck again shooting two men. Fortunately, they survived. The murderer was quickly caught after crashing the truck he had stolen from one of the victims. A few days later he was found dead in his jail cell, apparently of natural causes. Some hikers believe the shelter is haunted and refuse to stay there. But after our second longest day, we were tired and decided to risk it.

We were on our way to Woods Hole Hostel with a reputation of one of the best hostels on the trail. They did not disappoint. But first we had a 1,400 foot climb. The first part wasn’t too bad, but then it turned into a straight up hill climb. Finally at the top, we were rewarded with a great view of Wilburn Valley (see photos). Views have been sparse due to the persistent cloudy and foggy weather over the last two weeks. The last mile was super rocky, so care had to be taken. A half mile walk to the Hostel from the trail and we were their by 1:00pm. Met Neville, the owner of Woods Hole, got the tour and settled in to a private room.

They had hiked from Pennsylvania in some bad weather. First Sobo’s we have met. Left the shelter to attack an 1,800 ft climb. Warm temperatures and a hot sun made the first part difficult. A cool stream about a third of the way up was a real welcome. I wet a towel, put it on my head and doused my shirt with the cold water. That made the next 1,200 feet more manageable. One half mile before the summit, I crossed a dirt road, and lo and behold there was a gentleman with trail magic. Soda, cookies and hotdogs. I had the soda and cookies, took another coke and two hotdogs with me to have for dinner. It was 6:00pm and had another two and a half miles to the shelter. Got to the shelter around 7:00.

Walked by a river for about 3 miles. There were spring flowers everywhere (see pic). Clean water was scarce today, even though we crossed many rivers. Contamination from farms and ranches made it risky to drink even if we filtered.  Finally reached the end of the valley and back into the mountains (hills). After a mile, we finally crossed a stream that was safe to drink. We had planned to camp here, but something about the area was strange. Could of been the very old rusted out car. How it got there is anyone’s guess. Once SAS caught up with me, I convinced him to climb 1 more mile to the top of the mountain, even though it was 6:30pm.

Palmerton is known for one of the most difficult and dangerous climbs out of town. The hype exceeded my expectations. After a half mile steep climb, we came face to face with close to vertical climb up huge boulders. I put my poles in my back pack,  as I had to use both hands to maneuver up the massive boulders. At one point, I had to put my knee on the next ledge, as it was too far to raise my leg, and then reach my hands up to the next rock to pull myself up. We got to the top and was awarded with a great view. What made it even more difficult, was that it was raining making the rocks slick. Later, we ran into a south bounder, that said there was an alternate trail recommended to be used in the winter and when it rained.

Temps around 70 degrees made it a beautiful day. We hiked passed Sunfish Pond, a glacial pond and National Natural Landmark and then ridge walked with great views the rest of the day. Camped in a stealth camp site with clear skies tonight and hoping for a show of stars.

I stepped a few feet off the trail, and not two feet in front of me was a rattle snake, coiled up. I moved back quickly. Due to the cold weather, he wasn’t active. No rattle of the tail or move toward me. I’ve seen a lot of black snakes, but this is the first rattler. 


Made it to Brink Road Shelter around 5:00. Supposed to start raining later tonight and continue most of the day tomorrow. SAS is in the shelter and I’m in my hammock. I would prefer getting a good nights sleep and deal with the rain rather than sleep in the shelter. One other person in the shelter tonight. New Jersey is known to have more bears than any other state on the trail. Haven’t seen any yet. There is a bear box at the shelter which makes it easy not having to hang our food.

It drizzled most of the morning, but cleared up around 1:00. The Doppler kept showing heavy thunderstorms coming our way, but they would dissipate before reaching us. Went by a number of lakes and did more climbing then we’ve done since Virginia, culminating in a 19.5 mile day. Didn’t arrive in camp until 7:00pm. We’re at High Point Shelter, but as usual not staying in the shelter. Found a nice spot for my hammock. Three gentlemen about my age are in the shelter along with an unknown number of mice.

We walked through miles of marshlands and bogs. Fortunately, most of it had boardwalks to keep you out of the slop, although by the end of the day we had trudged through our share of mud.  Near the end of the day, we came to the Pochuck Boardwalk. This is a 1 mile boardwalk through marshland that is very popular with the locals.

Walked atop a ridge for 3 or 4 miles on extremely slick rocks. SAS fell 3 times, lucky not to get hurt. After 15 miles, cold and wet we dropped into Bellvale Farm Creamery. We have run into a number of these locally owned farm creameries near the trail in NJ. Yes, I was cold and wet but could not pass up home made ice cream.

Terrain was pretty much the same with multiple climbs culminating with hand over hand rock climbs near the top. After 16 tough miles, we arrived at the shelter just before 8:00. We decided to stay in the shelter as it was getting dark and we had heard through the trail vine that a very smart bear was stealing food bags that were hung from trees as they should be. There were 5 of us in the shelter and we decided to keep our food bags with us and not risk hanging them. A young man arrived shortly after and decided to hang his bag. At about 11:00pm we heard a racket in front of the shelter. There he was, a large bear trying to get the bag down from the tree. We shined our headlamps to get a good view of the show. After about thirty minutes, the bag fell to the ground and off the bear went, at least that’s what we thought. An hour later, we were all back asleep when one of the guys yelled, “bear.” The bear was ten feet from the wide open face of the shelter. We yelled and he sauntered off. Usually bears run when you yell at them. A few minutes later he was back, having only walked around the back of the shelter to appear on the other side. We all got up to show a united force, yelled, banged our feet and raised our arms to look bigger than we actually were. The bear wasn’t impressed, but turned anyway and walked back into the woods. We fell back asleep and only had to worry about the mice running across our sleeping bags the rest of the night.

Yes, the trail goes right through it. It’s a small zoo and the animals are in fairly small containment areas. Pretty sad and strange, in that we’re walking through the woods and then see animals out of their natural environment, caged. Upon exiting the zoo, we immediately crossed the Hudson River on the Bear Mountain Bridge, followed by a very steep climb back into the mountains. This is a few miles north of West Point Academy.  After six miles, we came to the Appalachian Deli at a road crossing. An excellent NY style Deli in a convenience store. Fairly easy day, now lying in my hammock being serenaded by the bugs.

The afternoon was pretty much one climb after another, but fairly nice trail until the last mile when there were a few steep rocky climbs. The trail was poorly marked and got off trail a few times over the last mile. There were a fair amount of day hikers out being that it was Saturday.

A couple of section hikers gave us a ride back down the road.  Train arrived on time for the  two hour trip to the city. Arrived at Grand Central Station at 5:00pm. What a stark difference from just two hours ago. I was walking in the woods just two hours ago and now I’m walking in the concrete jungle...I’ll take the woods any day. Met my son for some good NY pizza after he got off work. The next day, he got off work at 12:30 and we made our way to a Cuban restaurant for lunch. After lunch we went to the new John Wick movie. I think there were no less than a thousand people killed in the movie, and John Wick, shot no less than 10 times, motorcycles crashes, multiple knife wounds and a plethora of attacks by would be MMA fighters, prevailed in the end...no surprise.

I was out of the room in the morning before he woke up. Headed for Grand Central Station where I was to meet up with Ted at 9:00 to catch the train to Pawlin NY, our stop off spot in May. Two hour train ride, then grabbed some Deli in Pawlin before heading to the trail. Got to the trail head at 1:40. After 7 miles we crossed into Connecticut. Five states to go. Ran into 5 SOBO’s. They had started from Katahdin in mid July. They will be in for cold weather down south when they finish in December. After 9.4 miles we stopped at Ten Mile Shelter for the night.

Out of camp at 8:00. Hiked a mile and a half on the trail to a side road to what we thought was going to be a restaurant. Ended up being a convenient store. The road had an old 19th Century covered bridge. The people who ran the store were very nice and appreciated hikers. A chocolate muffin and a couple of hard boiled eggs and off we went. Planned on a 15 mile day, but knew there were a number of climbs that might deter our plans. Back through the covered bridge and up a 900 ft climb. Wasn’t too bad and at the top we were rewarded with our first view. The first day was nothing but PUD’s ( pointless up and downs.) Made 8.5 miles by 1:30 and had lunch at a shelter. The two guys from the previous nights shelter showed up just as we were finishing up lunch. They were stopping for the day. We had another 7 miles to go. Met a trail runner after a few miles. Trail runners are volunteers who help maintain the trail and make sure hikers are behaving themselves. Talked for a few minutes and she assured us we would have a challenging down hill towards the end of the day. We reached the section she was referring to at mile 12 and she wasn’t kidding. A very tenuous and steep half a mile, climbing down over large rocks and boulders. Not embarrassed to admit doing a few butt slides. I told Ted I would wait for him at the top so we could descend together. Jokingly, I said I didn’t want to have to climb back up if he fell. Fortunately, we both made it unscathed. 2 flat miles to camp to wrap up a 15.4 mile day. Our legs were rubber to say the least. Set up camp quickly and had dinner as it was getting dark.

Stopped at a shelter at 2:30 for lunch. The gnats and mosquitoes were crazy bad, but when you went into the shelter they didn’t follow. Ate quickly as we had 2.5 miles to go. I flew down the trail trying to beat the rain. I jogged the last half mile. Arrived at camp, still no rain. Set my hammock up and started on the rain tarp. Wouldn’t you know it, I had a huge tangle in one of the lines and it was starting to rain. Ted showed up as I was messing with the line. He quickly set up his tent.
