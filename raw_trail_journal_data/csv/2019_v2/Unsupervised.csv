Unsupervised,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608966,"It was two years ago today I set out for my first section hike along the AT, from Front Royal to Harpers Ferry. I'd never done more than day hiking and car camping before this, and while my day hikes were up to 11+ miles, I wasn't entirely prepared for how taxing, and rewarding this experience was going to be.I start another section hike in a little over a month, this time Front Royal to Waynesboro, the Shenandoah National Park portion of the same trail. I'm both excited and feeling way less prepared, as I haven't done anywhere near the prep work of last time and the trail is about twice as long. But I'll get there.",,View Entry,"Mar 27, Wed",0
Unsupervised,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609096,"It's been two years since I started my first hike... as my phone keeps reminding me with it's ""on this day"" photo feature.
I was supposed to go on a day hike today, for training, but I caught a cold over the last couple days so that's a no go... But I have my reminders that keep telling me I need to be training.

Right now I just want a nap.",,View Entry,"Mar 29, Fri",0
Unsupervised,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609149,"I'm not counting days exactly. But it's getting me through work each day, focusing on the hike coming up. Ok, so I haven't been training as well as I should, but I'm so looking forward to being out on the trail again. It's the light at the end of the tunnel. Just have to make it a month.",,View Entry,"Mar 30, Sat",0
Unsupervised,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609907,"I had a pretty good day yesterday, prep wise for the trail. Some friends hit my Hiking Wish List on amazon and got me a hammock bug net, a new water bladder, and a hip bag, all of which I've been wanting for a while.
     On my own, with the help of REI coupons and member dividend, I was able to pick up a waterproof trail journal, space pen, a couple of 50' lengths of reflective gear line, a tick key, and a titanium long handled spork (I would say something snarky about this one not breaking on the first night like my plastic one from the previous hike, but knowing me it's best to not tempt the gods). Gear wise I should be a lot more prepared for a hike this time than last. Physically...well that's another story, but I did manage to get in at least one training walk so far, only 8 miles, but it was a start.",,View Entry,"Apr 08, Mon",0

Unsupervised,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611533,"Gear sorted. Pack is packed. Food situated. Itinerary set. Just a week and a day til I start. 
I've still not had time to do any practice hikes or shakedowns this time and despite my discovery last time that I just wasn't that hungry, I've still packed a full compliment of food. I'll probably regret that later. 
Bring on the trails!",,View Entry,"Apr 26, Fri",0
Unsupervised,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612350,"It's now just after midnight, so I officially have just one day til my section.      Excited, nervous, worried, all of the above, but most of that will fade after I start walking.    Just about everything is set and ready to go, just some last minute organizing and shuffling of things. One day of work to get through, some sleep, and then the fun.",,View Entry,"May 04, Sat",0
