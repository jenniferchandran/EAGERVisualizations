Dennis Criddle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580110,"I did not complete the hike as I had planned but I did learn a lot about myself and my gear.  The trail started out flat going across the dam and up the road until I made it to the woods and then it was up hill for the next 4 miles with only a few switch back, it kicked my butt.  I will have to be in better shape when I start my thru hike.It started raining a couple of hours into the hike and continued raining until 30 minutes before I stopped for the day.  I got my tent set up, got some water, made dinner and hung my bear bag on one of the cables provided there.  I was in my tent asleep before it was dark.  Rain hitting the tent woke me several times thru out the night.  I woke up about 6 and it was still raining.  It finally stopped around 6:30.  I went and got my bear bag and found a hole where something, probably a squirrel had had a feast with my food.  Just as I got everything packed up it started raining again and rain for about 3 hours.I hiked for about 30 minutes and realized there was now way I was going to make the 12 miles to my planned stopping point (in the Smokies you can only camp in designated areas and as a section hiker you have to reserve the spots you will be stopping) at the pace I was able to hike.  Luckily I was able to get my wife on the phone (thanks Verizon) and have her pick me up at Fontana Dam.Things I learned on this hike;1.  I need to be in better shape when I start my thru hike.2.  My tent held up great in the rain, no water in the tent.3.  I need to find some way to keep the animals out of my bear bag.4.  Even though my feet were soaked for most of the hike I did not get any blisters wearing Soloman trail runners.","Fontana Dam

Dennis Criddle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583714,My wife Cheryl and youngest son Jeremy drove me down to Amicalola State Park today (thank you).  After 15 hours we arrived at 7:30.  We left Kentucky and drove to Mississippi to see my mom before my adventure and then on to Georgia. We will check in and weigh my pack at the visitor center in the morning and then I will start hiking north,"

Dennis Criddle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583749,"Unfortunately the first day of my hike ended up being the last day of my hike. I was about 5.5 miles into the hike and everything was going good, not tired and just a few more miles to get to Springer Mountain.  All of a sudden I started wheezing a lot so I stop for about 30 minutes to see if it stopped. When I started walking again the wheezing started again, now I am getting nervous thinking about the issues with blood clots I had in October. So I called my wife and son to pick me up. I  am not sure what caused it but I didn’t want to take any chances. One close call was enough. Thanks for the support.","

Dennis Criddle,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611270,My wife and couple of her sister dropped me off at 7:30 to start my hike. The first few miles were flat and then the hills began. I thought I was doing pretty good with the workouts at the  “y” until I started up the hill and it let me know I had work to do. I got to the first shelter about 12 (6.3 miles) and as I turned to take the trail to the shelter the rock I was on flipped over sending me into face plant into a mud puddle. Now I had to walk .4 miles down hill to get to the water source to wash off. This hill was steeper than the first one and the .8 down and back doesn’t count to the AT miles. I had lunch and left the shelter about 1:45. I made to Crampton Gap Shelter about 4:30 and settled in for the night.,"Harpers Ferry
