Forget-me-not,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608732,"I injured my knee years ago hiking Mt. Si near Seattle. Every time I'd step down steeply I'd get a throb in the knee. I'm happy to say that after three months of work, Megan at Bougeois Physical Therapy has got my knee, and my core strength, in great shape. I still feel it a little when my form is poor, but it's world's better.
I also picked up the book, Fixing Your Feet, which immediately fixed all kinds of stuff like my loping gait, crooked hip, and my stance. Highly recommended.",,"Prairieville, LA","Dec 03, Mon",0
Forget-me-not,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608734,"With the exception of my backpack and hammock body, I've sewn a lot of my gear. It's been a lot of fun designing, making, and destroying things along with learning how to sew.",,View Entry,"Feb 04, Mon",0
Forget-me-not,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608738,"A shakedown hike is a hike you take to test out your gear and make sure you're otherwise prepared mentally and physically for the longer through hike. My sister Paula and I drove up to Georgia and hung out with Michael so I could hike near the AT approach trail.We visited the AT welcome center and we took my picture under 'the arch.' That was a bit of an emotional 'shit just got real' moment. I'm really doing this. And I am.We hiked up the Amicalola Falls steps and then Paula and Michael left me to fend for myself for a few days. I spent the night at the welcome center shelter site and headed up the approach trail late the next morning.It was a beautiful hike full of sunshine and clear skies. I thought it was unusually warm for mid-February, but I had no complaints.The hike was strenuous, but not beyond my ability. It gave me the confidence that I'll be able to get my trail legs by starting in W. Virginia without much more training beforehand. I met John on the trail and we hiked the last few hours together. I met Rooster at Black Gap shelter and we all failed together in making a fire from wet wood.I hadn't finished my real quilt yet so I brought my two Costco quilts instead. They worked amazingly well in the near freezing temperatures that decended over night, except for my big toe which I left poking out.The next morning was cold and foggy and I hiked back down the approach trail in hail, sleet,  and 1000 yard visibility. I loved it - even when my gloves frosted over and I was being pelted in the head by pea-sized hail.Thank you Paula for taking me to Georgia and Michael for hosting us for the weekend. Beer and Monty Python was a great end to my hike.I'm ready.",,Black Gap Shelter,"Feb 16, Sat",0
Forget-me-not,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611140,"Spent 33 pleasent hours on the train. Saw hundreds of cherry blossom trees in full bloom. Met Brent. He's section hiking, but what he really wants to do is hobo on the Chicago High Line train from the East coast all the way to West coast. He pointed out some of the hobo graffiti on the side of rail cars, but I couldn't tell the difference between them and regular tagging.I'm sleeping at a bus stop, which can happen when you just show up to town at 6 in the evening and you're all ready to ruff it. The bus stop is right next to the train tracks. This spot is neither comfortable or quiet, but it is somewhat dry.Tomorrow morning I climb the hill into town and register with the Appalachian Trail Conservancy and take off.",,View Entry,"Apr 14, Sun",0
Forget-me-not,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611266,"Checked in at the ATC as soon as they opened, got my picture taken, my hang tag, and saw Brett heading to the convience store.
The AT out of Harper's Ferry starts on a pedestrian footbridge attached to a railroad bridge and onto a beautiful, wide, flat path out of town. Then the trail assumes it's normal form of up, down, mud, rocks, in a tunnel of brown and green. It's beautiful really.
High winds all day. One large tree had fallen across the trail. I saw two more fall within a few hundred yards of me this morning.
At the shelter Brent showed up and we said hello. He moved on and I considered making it as far as I could, but the wind was pretty bad. I never saw Brent again.","Harper's Ferry 
",Ed Garvey,"Apr 15, Mon",8.10
Forget-me-not,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611272,"Met 'Little Steps'. We had signed in at the ATC at the same time.
Stopped at a park that had a spiggot, power, a garbage can, and a bathroom. What more could I need? Garbage cans are actually few and far between on the trail.
Boundless energy today. I hopped from rock to rock to avoid the mud.
Some type of fungus or bacteria is killing all the trees here. It looked so sad I couldn't bare to take a picture. Like the black death for trees.","Ed Garvey

Forget-me-not,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611274,"Saw the original Washington monument today. I was there for 30 minutes before they closed it for the rest of the summer. Outstanding views of Maryland from atop the hill. Left my water bottle here.
Found a bathroom in the middle of the woods that had a hot shower and power.
Met Anne and her dog on the trail today. Not the Appalachian Trail. I took a wrong turn and totally ignored all the small trees intentionally blocking the path. But it was nice to have a conversation about Louisiana and Missouri and how some dogs love to hike and some don't.
Today's trail was a lot of rocks and a brown tunnel of dead trees, but I still loved it. There was one really nice view. I passed Little Steps on trail and I never saw her again.There's a bunch of people here tonight but I'm just too tired to socialize.","Rocky Run

Forget-me-not,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611275,"Pine Knob - Annapolis Rocks
Today I left behind my tarp ridgeline. I noticed this when I set up this afternoon in anticipation of a significant thunderstorm approaching. I improvised a new one from my bear bag hang kit. I started to feel bad about losing two things in two days until a child came to the site saying he lost his dad. In some way losing my tarp line didn't seem so bad, but I will do better in the future.I'm sitting on the Annapolis Rocks. It's a beautiful view, but similar to the last few views. I don't have any anxiety about the height until I look at one little patch of trees. They are just close enough that I can make out the detail of the limbs, but they are so small and so far below me. Now that I've 'studied' them I don't feel anxious about them. Maybe this trick will work when I'm climbing up a cliff face. I doubt it.I met Sarge who was heading to Harper's Ferry. He was hoping to make it all the way to Harper's Ferry and get a nice hotel room. He only gave me his trail name, which is the exact opposite of Brent. I only hiked a few miles today. My knee is beginning to hurt and I don't think I could have made it 8 miles to the next site.I have been told I have to have closure for the lost child... The ranger took the boy back to his shack and later his dad came around looking for him. I saw them all camping together later that night.And they all lived happily ever after.","Pine Knob

Forget-me-not,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611882,"Annapolis Rocks - Ensign Cowell
Met Lukedog and SAS (Slow and Steady) on the trail. A big storm was coming so I decided to stay in the shelter for the first time. Among the other 14 shelter-mates we're an older couple who really likes coffee, a family of 4 that were section hiking and doing 15-20 mile days, The Cigarette Smoking Man who had never hiked before and did all his cooking on a fire, 3 military-brother-machinists, and Sean.The storm didn't seem that bad to me, but I will need a pad if I spend too many nights on a floor.I washed my clothes in my opsack - totally worth it.","Annapolis Rocks
",Ensign Cowell Shelter,"Apr 19, Fri",5.60
Forget-me-not,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611883,"Met Alex, who I've nicknamed ""The welcoming committee"" and gave him a virtual Ripple Pin for helping everyone. Met Stephan, from Chicago, via Switzerland, who speaks french. I hoped to hike with him the next day but haven't seen him again.Hiked with Sean into Smithsburg/Cavetown. Got rides everywhere. Beautiful town and nice people. Sean left his tent at the shelter and his poles on a picnic table in town. He had a bad day. I got my resupply, meds, my quilt repaired, pizza, and a charging cable. I had a good day.","Ensign Cowell

Forget-me-not,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611885,"It's Easter. Called Mom and Dad. Left the shelter going fast. I waited for Sean at my first stop, but I had to press on. I never saw him again. There was a beautiful overlook with lots of graffiti. Made it to Penmar Park at midday, but it's closed until May. So no water, bathroom, power, or crowds. Beautiful park. Called the house again once everyone was together and talked to everyone.There was a big rock scramble that was poorly marked that I had to use some way finding skills to get back on the trail. There was a big guy up there too with a huge pack so that saved him from going down into the same hole I was in.Some guy wanted me to hang out at this campsite, but he kinda spooked me so I moved on.I tried to pick up all the broken glass I found on the trail today. I was successful until I came across an entire pane of broken glass right before the big park. The profound lesson here is to do what you can, but don't think you can do it all by yourself. And that's ok.","Raven Rock

He's throughhiked the AT twice and then moved to the area to help other hikers.I bought a family size rotisserie chicken and went all Sandor Clegane on it right there in Walmart. Actually ate it at the Subway in there, but still.I found the laundromat. Washing machine machine turned the entire load into a giant knot. The laundromat owner came by. I'm assuming he was watching me on the cameras and said ""ohh a through-hike!"". He talked for 3 hours. I did not take him up on offer to come clean his stable.I called Roger for a pickup and he was there in 5 minutes with a speedy delivery to the trail.I met Turtle at Dear Lick shelter. He's actually the big guy with the huge pack from before. He stayed at the campsite I was spooked from and said that guy was Auge, a local that likes helping hikers. My spidey-sense failed me that time.I pushed on again and glad I did. My knee feels a little better.","Falls Creek

He's a PATC volunteer and gave me my first trail magic (apple, bannana, two protein bars). His YouTube is ""wildonthetrail"".So many people associated with the PATC stopped and helped me this week.
