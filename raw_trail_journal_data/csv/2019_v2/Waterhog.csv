We have 432 miles to drive to get to Amicalola Falls State Park, where we stay the night and then a 8 mile hike to the actual start. It is supposed to be 100% chance of thunderstorms and rain. 100% chance sounds like an oxymoron. There is no chance in 100%. One hundred percent means that the chance is gone and it is gonna rain. I think this is a fitting start. Better to start in horrible weather and then have your first sunny day on Monday.","Bedford VA.

It rained all day and night the first day. Everyone was thankful for dry clothes at night. ""Yes..."" Joshua said when I reminded him he hadn't wanted to bring his dry pajamas... Setting up a tent in a rainstorm is like putting on dry clothes outside in the rain. You almost wonder, ""What's the point?""

He was excited to see us again. Another guy walked a long time with us. I talked at length about the Lord. He politely listened. Met a last night who very much enjoyed the boys laughter- Joshua is very funny! He was not open to hearing about Jesus. He said he believed in Buddhist philosophy. I think our attitude spoke more to him. He complemented the boys several times.
It's now Monday morning. Yesterday was really and good and really bad. Around 11am, I felt the Holy Spirit come on me and I started weeping while walking. I had to stop between, I couldn't see through the tears. I felt the Lord's love. I also felt so selfish. So self oriented. ""Lord, give me a love for others that overflows!""
This morning I prayed for a young man, Arrow, who is struggling because all his life he wanted to be an ASL interpreter. His last semester in college, he was told he couldn't do the internship because he had a complaint against him. One of his students had a hard time understanding him. He has a lisp and a slight stutter. Joshua and I prayed over him for God's purpose and I felt the Holy Spirit speak through me as I prayed. He was very encouraged.","Woody Gap

Waterhog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614731,"I had a surreal experience. Joshua and I piped out at Clingmans Dome. This is a tourist spot that has a large tower that people can walk up. Everyone looked like they were dressed so nice and the smell of perfume wafted through the air. People stared at Joshua and me like we were to be pitied. Our clothes stink. Our hands and face have that permanent grime of creek washing without the benefit of soap. I looked down and my legs looked like someone attacked me with a weed whacker (or trimmer, for you southerners.) We smiled at two little girls and they withdrew to their mothers legs. And, this is entirely true- three Japanese men surrounded us and started photographing us. All we wanted was food. We thought there was a gift store but it was all tourist trinkets. 
We were going to have to retreat back into the woods. Then a man asked, ""Are you thru-hikers?!""  
I was very tempted to say, ""No... just homeless,"" but he looked so sincere that I replied, ""Yes.""
He pointed up the trail and said that there was a young lady who was looking to do some trail magic for hikers. Her name was Emily (I think?!! Sorry, Emily) Two sodas later and a whole bag of chips and snacks galore, we headed back to the trail. Emily and her dad were a delightful surprise and wonderful to visit with.

Waterhog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614738,"Yesterday, we hiked 26 miles from Icewater Shelter to Davenport Gap. This was our longest hike yet. Much of it was downhill, although this sounds nice, the downhills are the hardest punishment on the joints and quad muscles. Our calves are strong enough now to keep up a good pace uphill and we have learned to use the hiking poles more effectively to carry us up the hills. 
We hitchhiked into Gatlinburg, TN to restock on food. I looked for shoes, but there were no wide pairs in stock at the NOC. The best part of the day was lunch at Cici's Pizza! This is a pizza buffet, AYCE: ""All You Can Eat."" Hiker hunger has set in. The boys are living off of the calories they take in. I, however, have some reserve fat. Thank God!
(My apologies to those who have experienced real hunger from lack of food, because I am sure it is worse than ""Hiker Hunger."")
It is as if we can't eat enough. We entered Cici's at 11:30am, right after opening bell. The cook was stepping out to take a break. There was one lady that rang us up. The buffet line had whole pizzas. There was sausage and mushroom, cheese, pepperoni, spinach and feta, and BBQ, and a white sauce pizza and pineapple bacon. 
We ate ALL of them. 
The cook came back in from his break when I was up at the salad bar. He exclaimed, ""What the (Bleep!!)""
More pizza came to the line. Pepperoni; we ate it. Cheese; we at it. Sausage? Gone. Spinach and feta (my favorite), gone. A pound of cheese bread and marina sauce; gone. A pan of brownies: gone. We ate the spaghetti and noodles. We ate the cinnamon desert pizza, and the lemon bars.  
Two hours later.. we staggered out of the restaurant. The lady at the cash register stared at us... I think it was in admiration, but could have been disdain. My counselor daughter, Rebekah, says that anger, joy, and disgust are all the same emotion but our brains process the emotion interpretation. I'm hoping her limbic system interpreted happiness. I tried to guide her by smiling at her, but I am unsure of my success. 
Later that day, as hunger returned, I thought about Jesus' words, ""Those who hunger and thirst for righteousness' sake, shall be filled."" This slight, gnawing hunger is a physical experience of what should be happening spiritually. Someday, we will feast at the Lord's Table and be satisfied. Until then, we eat, we hunger and return to eat with the Lord. 
""Please keep me hungry, until the day I am before my Savior's face, then I will be satisfied forever in His presence.""","Icewater Shelter

The forest ground was covered with a kelly-green sea. The trail was smooth and I was humming praises. Suddenly, we came upon a bright bluebird in the middle of the trail. That would have been wonderful except that it was lying on its side, dead. We both stared at it.

Waterhog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615676,"I've been waking early to spend time with the Lord. It has become the highlight of this journey. This morning at campsite, the pre-Dawn light gave a reddish glow. I found a log above the field where the tents lay. The mist was just lifting above the tents. I turned and faced the start of the rising sun. For those who have never experienced being in the presence of the Lord, it is hard to describe. I begin with praise and worship. I listen. I am aware of my own presence. I worship. The Lord's presence will start to come and it is like someone coming and sitting next to you. You lose the sense of your own presence and your spirit and the Holy Spirit commune. It's not some transcendental experience, or weird out of body experience. But, again, it is hard to describe to those who don't know the Lord. The Lord's love is so strong that I often question, ""Why, do you love me?"" Which brings me to this experience. Jesus washed the feet of the disciples. Peter exclaimed, ""O no Lord! You will never wash my feet! The Lord replied that if Peter did not let him wash his feet then Peter would have no part in the Lord. Peter then rightly says, ""Then not just my feet but my head and body as well!""The Lord explains that Peter only needs his feet washed. We, as those cleansed by Jesus, are finished. We need no more body washing. But, we need our feet washed.Today, as I communed with the Lord, His presence came. I was undone. The Lord, through my tears, came and washed my feet.","Curley Gap

Waterhog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616704,"We have 76 miles to New Jersey. Dawn is coming today for a visit and resupply. So, we are taking our second zero day. Another true story...A famous hiker, Skurka, recently wrote an article arguing against the use of hanging bear bags. https://andrewskurka.com/argument-against-hanging-bear-bag/He is way more experienced and wise in outdoor matters than me. But this led me to some fun thoughts. But first, For those who don't know what a bear hang is: it is taking your food in a bag and hanging it from a tree too high for the bear to reach it. Picture a bunch of bags swinging from trees near a shelter and you get the idea. Problem is that some bears occasionally get the low hanging fruit and then have a feast. This trains the bear to come back to that place over and over looking for food.To be fair, Skurka's recommendation is to use a smell free, hard canister and keep it with you. But, I'm not worried about the canister. I'm worried about the food smells from my sticky honey bun fingers that screw the lid on the canister. My wise wife told us to not brush our teeth with mint toothpaste and then spit next to the tent. Sound advice. Bears, I assume, like mint.To extend the logic of sleeping with your food so that bears associate humans with food, and thus, eventually give up fighting for it: we could speed up the process of retraining the bears. My suggestion is to squish some marshmallows in your hair. Take a couple bites of peanut butter, and then fall asleep in your tent. You will smell like a fluffed-nutter. At 2 in the morning, the back of your tent will be slashed open with bear claws. Thankfully, or, rather hopefully, you will awaken quickly. In your terror, you jump up to frantically find the front of the tent zipper. The bear will find his fluffer-nutter sandwich moving away. He will act quickly and bite down.But, since your head is sticky from the marshmallow, the pillow will be stuck to the back of your head. This is what the hungry bear will bite down on. Since, you are a Thru-hiker, the bear will gag and choke on thousands of down feathers. This gives you the few extra seconds to flee the tent and keep your head attached. The bear will think that humans in tents have choking food and will learn to stay away. This will be at least as effective as throwing a stone at a bear...","

It's mind boggling to me that someone would break into a car at a trailhead parking spot. We have had so many encounters of generosity and kindness and when something like that happens it reminds us that there is evil in this world. Chris actually left and brought back burgers and shakes for us - AFTER - seeing his window broken. Incredibly generous. Wow...","

Waterhog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619214,"We made it to MT Washington! We were headed up Wednesday and there was supposed to be a thunderstorm. So, we made the decision to go Thursday. It ended up being sunny with a slight breeze. The cell service has been very spotty. The updates to the journal has been difficult. Chris and his sons, John Paul and Caleb, met us on rt.302. They resupplied us with great food, warm hats, and jackets. I think we turned them into official trail angels... We enter Maine tomorrow! Our goal is still to summit Katahdin on August 9, but we might get there early. I feel somewhat bittersweet about finishing. It would be nice to not wake up sore but this has been a wonderful time of bonding with my sons and spiritual revival in my life.Still 288 miles to go so lots can happen. Dawn said there were connections at Baxter State Park we were going to have. Can't wait..","

Bad: gonna be tough explaining why the bank account is drained.
Good: We summit the last mountain, Katahdin in a day.
Bad: We still haven't figured out how we are going to get the 1,200 miles back home.Good: Maine is beautiful!Bad: and buggy, and steep, and full of roots, and resupply is few and farBut with all that.. We are starting to count the days to home. Somewhat bittersweet... beds would be nice, but it is nice to hear the birds sing in the morning and see the stars and jump in every creek...","

Waterhog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619740,"We just passed the plaque for the 2000 mile marker. We have 192 miles to go...Tonight we head to Stratton for a resupply. We have a couple 4000 footers to complete and then the mountains get smaller until we hit the 100 mile wilderness. Mount Katahdin is after the wilderness and rises like a triangle. We summit up and down in a day. Ethan and I had to get new shoes. We are so close to the end that we decided to buy a couple 26 dollar Walmart brand. It has been three days and the bottom is shredded already. Sometimes it is cheaper to pay more...We are all doing well, mostly.  Ethan has some feet problems - soreness on the bottom. My right knee flares up going downhill but isn't getting worse. Caleb's hips hurt. Joshua, the youngest, is still springy and strong. His calf's look like Popeye's arms. He has also grown two inches. To answer ""what do we eat??"" Ramen and potato at night. Bars and sometimes bagels during days. Oatmeal, sometimes grits at breakfast.  Nuts and peanut butter round out the protein and tuna is a mainstay. Not very varied...but keeps us going.","

Waterhog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619915,"There are logs across bogs that are intended to help the hiker not sink and die in the swamp. Some of these logs look like they have been there since the trail was finished in 1937. It is not unusual to find a log broken in half.I used to take all the kids shopping with me. We would grab three carts and they would follow me around the store as I threw food into the carts. This was always fun and we would sing and make a spectacle as me and 7 small children trained our way through the store. Occasionally the child driving the cart behind me would run the cart into the back of my heels. This hurts. Really bad.Since then, I've developed a keen sense of when someone is too close to me. This happens frequently on the trail. We cross a bog and I can just feel my son behind me, too close. I threaten and cajole, ""Give me some room... too much weight on the log""I've said that a hundred times. Still, I remind again. We were crossing a particularly black, muddy, quicksand type of bog one day and I noted out loud, ""Pity the poor sap that's going across the log and it breaks in half!"" I said this partly to get out the reminder to stay off my log, couched in a friendly way.I was halfway across the log when the log turned 180 degrees sideways. My arms flailed out like two wings, and I started to fall sideways. I had enough sense to plunge my trekking pole into the bog and this temporarily slowed the pending disaster. The pole sunk two feet. I thought for a second that i had saved myself. However, the weight was too much for the pole and the pole snapped in half. My relief turned to panic as I hit the bog sideways. I immediately sunk in. Thankfully, my descent only went in about 6 inches of warm goo. The pole that had snapped was standing straight up with the sharp edge exposed. I imagined the pole breaking through my skin and stabbing through my left ventricle. I would bleed out on the bog. My last words, ""Finish the hike boys. Finish the hike..."" At my funeral, ""He was a good dad...at least he died doing what he loved...if he had only been more careful...""A plaque would be put in the bog and I would rest among the mosquitos and gnats. ""Bill Vickery died here while crossing the bog. This plaque is in memory of his last hike and his inability to make it to Katahdin.""Usually when one of us falls, comments come fast. ""Good one!"" Or ""Lets see that in slow motion""This time there was complete silence as I turned around. Half of my body in the bog, looking at the boys, their faces a mixture of awe and shock.Joshua, the youngest, broke the silence. ""Pity the poor sap who falls in the bog.""","

Waterhog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620544,"I am waiting in a quiet library for Chris Martin and his son, JP. They are coming through Millinocket, Maine to pick us up. We have stealth tented just before Baxter State Park in preparation for the morning hike up Katahdin. To be in a library before the last hike is surreal. Everyone is whispering and besides the click, click of the computer keys it is silent. Seems like there should be some raucous yelling when we are this close to victory. No one here, except for those who know what thru-hikers smell like, suspect that we have just completed over 2,000 miles of hiking. Hiking over roots, rocks, bogs, hills, rock scrambles, in rain, lightening, hot sun, and more rain. I suppose this is what it will feel like when I return to work and home life. The feeling that something major has happened and yet the world does not realize it. I felt this way after our first daughter was born. I went to the store for the first time and no one even looked at me. I wanted to shout, ""Hey everyone! we just had a baby!"" to shock them out of their ho-hum day. But, I didn't. How many times have I walked by someone and not been aware? The saying, ""You never know someone else's story"", rings true - unless you seek to know. I remember one man in a nursing home in New Hampshire that was a world famous horticulturist. He even had some Iris' and Tulips named after him. Most people walked by him and had no idea that the Tulip growing in front of their house may have been developed by him. He didn't talk about it unless asked. Right after my wife and I had our wedding reception we went to this old cabin for our first honeymoon night. Unfortunately, someone had forgotten to turn on the water. We both had headaches. Really. So, I went a half-mile down the mountain, in my wedding tux to find water. I ended up driving a short distance up the road to a bar. I walked in - exhausted, dressed up, and a bit harried. Everyone turned to stare at me. ""Hello'"". I said and smiled. ""I just got married and need something to drink.""""Well, hell, yeah..."" One of the old Vermonters drawled. ""Can't even wait to get undressed, huh?""""Who did you marry"", a younger man asked.""Dawn Denton"". I said, suddenly realizing they thought I wanted a stronger drink than water ""Hey, I know her!"" One man exclaimed, laughing. ""I'll buy this guy's first drink!""It took a few minutes to get a gallon of water and get our of the bar but by the time I left, my presence had cheered up the place considerably.In Mark, chapter 5, there is a story about the crowds pressing in on Jesus as he is walking. One woman sneaks through the crowd, and touches the wings of his garment. The lady was healed - she reached in faith. But, more interesting, is that no one else noticed her because she had a disease that would have made her unclean and she should have not been in the crowd. Yet, Jesus calls her out - he singles out the hurting woman and talks to her. Jesus crashes through every tradition and cultural norm to see the individual - even at the risk of being called a lawbreaker. The invisible woman no one else sees, He heals and calls forth.Stories like that happen over and over again in the gospels. We don't need to be Jesus to recognize those in front of us. Anna and Simeon, in Luke 2, recognize a 8-day old child being brought to the Temple, raise him up, prophecy, and declare that the Messiah is in their midst. No one else recognized the momentous event right in front of them. Lord, open our eyes and ears to see those around us. Make us aware.","
