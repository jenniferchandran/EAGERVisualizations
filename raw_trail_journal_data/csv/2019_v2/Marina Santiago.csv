Marina Santiago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615201,"My plans have had to change because Katahdin will be closed until at least the third week of June! Apparently the spring has been very cold and wet, and it's still not safe to climb Katahdin and enter the 100 mile wilderness. 
But, I'm antsy to get going, so instead of a Southbound hike, I'll be doing a flip flop hike starting on June 8 or 9 (depending on when I can get a ride) at the Great Barrington trail head near the Beartown State Forest in Western Massachusetts. Then, I'll first hike the ~660 miles or so North to Katahdin before taking a bus back down to the same trail head in the Beartown State Forest and hiking the 1532 miles to Springer Mountain in Georgia. This means that my bounce box schedule is going to be different, though I will still use the same towns as I was planning on before. 1.

We were supposed to meet at a certain shelter, but they never showed up. On 6/12, I hiked 13.4 miles and saw 3 deer (2 were chasing each other, and one was not giving a shit) and 3 bears (a mom and two cubs - the trail headed away from them so I walked away super fast). I also learned to try not to make cornbread on a camp stove.6/13 was a long day. I went about 24 miles, which was very tiring. Then I ate a whole family sized (8 servings) or chicken soup. I climbed mt greylock and crossed into Vermont that day too. Vermont is muddier than can possibly be imaginedToday, I stopped in Bennington, VT to buy a couple more days worth of food, and see if I can find a better raincoat.

Miserable hiking weather, and after 16 miles or so, I gave up and stopped in a shelter. This whole state is so muddy, we should give it to Canada. I have nothing good to say about the trail here","

Marina Santiago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616835,"I made it to my first bounce box stop in Killington yesterday less than a day behind schedule. The original plan was to get there the morning off the 19th, but I had a couple bad days, and I didn't think I'd get there til the 20th. But, with the right motivation (100% chance of thunderstorms starting the night the 19th), I was able to hike 40 miles in 2 days, and make it to Killington yesterday afternoon. I'm now 182 miles in, or about 8.3% done!
The last couple of days have been interesting. After the utterly miserable rain all day on the 16th, I decided to get better rain gear, so I hitch hiked into Manchester. While I was there, I also bought a couple more days of food, and mailed some stuff back to Boston (thanks, Heidi!) to lighten my pack a little, and ate 3 breakfasts. I think the 3 breakfasts and the good weather helped improve my mood a lot. By the time I got back on the trail, I was feeling strong, but I still had to stop early because my feet started to blister. When I took off my shoes, I discovered that they had been so wet so long that their pruniness from being wet had gotten so extreme that the edges of the wrinkles are rubbing against each other, causing itching, burning, and blisters. It got so bad, I stealth camped a couple miles from my goal, to give them a chance to dry out. 
The next day, once I popped a couple blisters, my feet were in decent shape, and I took it slow, but I still made it about 22 miles. Felt good to be almost back on track. At the shelter, I found Pit Stop and Birdie! Pit Stop was in rough shape: he had a knee brace, only one hiking pole, and his feet were covered in duct tape. Once they get to Rutland, he's going home, but Birdie is pushing on. They were going to be hiking ~16 miles to the road, which was only a couple miles from my inn, so we hiked together yesterday. We climbed Mt Killington, which was tough. 10 miles uphill, and 6 miles downhill. I said goodbye to Pit Stop at the road, and Birdie and I might try to meet up on the trail later on. Without Pit Stop to slow him down, he might be too fast for me, but we'll see. 
I made it to the inn, where I had my first hot shower in 10 days and did laundry. Going to take it easy today, and get back on the trail tomorrow! 
My next bounce box stop will be Lincoln, NH, and I think I can get there in about 5 days.","

Marina Santiago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617104,"I made it to NH. I'm now 227 miles in, and 10.3% done. If I can keep this pace up, I should be done in less than 5 months total. I have a feeling that my pace will slow down a bit for the next couple weeks as I make my way through the white mountains and southern Maine, but after that, I'll be really strong, and just fly through the mid Atlantic once I start going south
I had a really great zero day in Killington last Thurs (6/20). I resupplied, ate everything, and bought new insoles for my shoes. My ankles are still super sore, though, so I'm gong to look for some ankle sleeves, while in in town today. 
After breakfast at the inn on Friday, I hiked 18 miles. It started out rainy, but then cleared up by the afternoon. I stayed at a shelter with Tank and RALI (retired and loving it), who I had seen on and off since I started. 
Yesterday (6/22) I did most of my hiking alone, and decided though I hate wearing headphones, I have run out of things to think about, and need to distract myself with audiobooks. I'm going to buy some today and reactivate my audible account. Send me book suggestions!
I did meet up with Tank, RALI, and their friend, Just Ben again towards the end of the day. Tank gave me a trail name, ""Brown Eyed Girl"". RALI had a couple other trail name ideas, ""Smart Cookie"" and ""Infectious Smile"", but it seems like Brown Eyed Girl is what's sticking. 

The trail yesterday was gorgeous. It went through rolling hills and lots of wild flowers, and I made good time, so I stopped at a farm stand and ate a grilled cheese and maple soda. Apparently, I missed the spot with homemade ice cream sandwiches, though, which was disappointing, but I'm sure I'll find others.
Today, we got up extra early, and hiked into Hanover, crossing the border around 7:30am. We got breakfast at a diner, and once I charge my phone up, I'll try to get another 11 miles in this afternoon.","

Marina Santiago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617353,"I'm 280 miles in now (12.7% done)! I'm officially in the white mountains, which are just about as tough as I expected with a pack on. People keep asking me how much my pack weighs. I don't think it's significantly heavier than the average, but I'm a smaller than average thru hiker, so it looks big. I don't feel like I'm carrying anything I don't need, either. I'm not at the point yet where I want to give up hot food. 
The day I left Hanover, I hiked a total of about 17 miles and stayed at the Moose Mountain shelter. The top of Moose Mountain was gorgeous, and there were a couple of nice girls there who gave me some fresh cherries. They also had a very good dog named Atticus. He was afraid of my hiking poles, but jumped in my lap once I put them down. The only other person staying in the shelter was Red Man who has been hiking the trail on and off since 1995. His pack was very heavy since most of his gear is from the 90s.
The next day I hiked 21 miles and stealth camped near a stream. It was very mountainous, and it took me 12 hours to do it, which is a lot longer than I'm used to. I'm getting some good calluses on my hands from the hiking poles. The weather was great though! 
Yesterday, I did about 19 miles. The weather started out nice, but it started to drizzle around 11am. By the time I got to the base of Mt Moosilauke, it was really raining. While I was under tree line, my poncho kept me relatively dry, but once I got above the trees, the wind was driving the rain sideways, and I was soaked pretty quick. I couldn't see much in all the rain, so it felt like it took forever to get to the summit. I didn't get to relax at the summit because I knew as soon as I stopped moving, I would start freezing. I booked it the 2.5 miles down to the next shelter, so I could get dry and warm. Only one other person was in the shelter, and he let me use some of his water to cook my food, so I wouldn't have to go out in the rain again. He was talkative, which was nice after a very quiet day, and also the first south bounder I've met! He started on May 22, but skipped Katahdin since it was closed.
Woke up early this morning, so I could hike down the rest of the mountain and catch the 7am shuttle to the hostel I'm staying at tonight. I'm considering staying there a couple nights and slack packing a couple days to give my joints a little rest, but we'll see. Either way, I'll hike the Kinsman mountains tomorrow and the Franconia ridge the next day.","

Marina Santiago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617460,"I was able to stay two nights in my hostel, so I was able to hike without my full pack today.When I got to the hostel after running errands in town yesterday, Birdie was there! It was good to hang out again, but he's about a day ahead of me, so I don't know if I'll see him again now. I also met Murph and Bananas. They were fun, but unfortunately Bananas is giving up and going home. He's having a miserable time, and it doesn't make sense to do something if you're miserable.Slack packing today was magical. I was able to move so quickly and easily without a full pack (I even ran a little just for the fun of it), and I finished the full 17 miles 3 hours before the shuttle was scheduled to get me. So I ate a lot of ice cream and napped in the sun at the Flume visitor's center. I also met Finding Philip, who is doing one of the most impressive things I've ever heard of. He is climbing all 48 4000 footers in NH in every month of the year IN ONE YEAR! That's 576 mountains in one year. He's on track to break the record and finish in 10.5 months and should be finishing in the next week or two. Crazy! I'm heading into Franconia tomorrow and the Presidentials soon after. I've done these mountains with a pack before, but I'm not sure that it makes me prepared for it.","

Marina Santiago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617913,"I'm 371 miles in and about 17% done. It's been a little slower going through NH this last week, but absolutely beautiful, and I should be crossing into Maine sometime in the next day or two. Southern Maine will be rough like NH, but then it'll be pretty flat til Katahdin.
I had a long day coming out of Lincoln on the 28th. I did 19 miles including 5 4000 footers (Lincoln, Lafayette, Garfield, South Twin, and Zealand). I had a quick stop at Galehead hut where I bought two brownies, and two slices of coffee cake, which helped get me over the last two mountains. 
The 28th was a really good day, but I paid for it the next day. I was tired and I managed to roll my ankles on the way down Zealand. I was feeling so tired, I was going to hitch hike to the AMC highland center for real food, but when I got down to the road, there was a couple who had extra soda, fruit, and snacks that they were sharing with thru hikers, and they gave me all their extra pepperoni and cheese! It was the best trail magic yet! I still only made it 11 miles that day, but I got my camp on top of Webster cliff set up before the first storm came through, so I was pretty happy.
The next day (6/30) was very cold, windy, and wet. My plan A was to make it over the presidentials, but that is a really bad idea when the weather is bad. Plan B was to make it to the Lake of the Clouds hut before the summit to Washington, but that's above tree line and dangerous too. I stopped at a hut a few miles in to see if they had an updated weather forecast, and it was bad enough that I considered setting my tent up there and only going about 5 miles that day, but the woman there convinced me that I should push on to Lake of the Clouds. It didn't get bad until about 2 miles from the hut when it started to thunder. Those were the fastest two miles I've hiked yet. I was above tree line and hiked very fast, jogging through the most exposed areas, while it thundered around me. It was hard to see the lightning, so I couldn't tell how dangerous it actually was. When it started to hail, I crouched near a big rock that protected my face from the worst of it. It eventually cleared up until I was about 100 meters from the hut. Then out of nowhere, the storm started again, so bad I couldn't see the hut anymore until I was just about there. I paid to stay in the dungeon (their storm cellar), where they let thru hikers stay for cheap. There were a lot of very unprepared people taking shelter at the hut. I can see why so many people die on those mountains. Whole generations of children will probably never go hiking again after freezing in that storm. I did spend time with two families with little girls who had toughed it out. I lent my sweater to one because hers was soaked. The other little girl ate four pieces of cake. She's my hero. When the stormed cleared, the sunset was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. The pictures I took don't do it justice. 
The next day, I hiked 15 miles to Gorham, NH over the rest of the presidentials. It took a long time, partly because I met so many southbound AT hikers, who were really chatty. I also ran into Finding Philip, only a few miles into his final lap of 4000 footers! 
The hostel I'm at now slack packed me today. I did 21.5 miles over 6 4000 footers (the Wildcats, Carters, and Mt Moriah). It was one of my toughest days yet, and my legs are exhausted!","

Marina Santiago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618153,"I should have taken more of a break after the white mountains because I have been tired and sore, and the going has been slow, but I'm in Maine now, and I'm taking a belated rest day at the Human Nature hostel, which is a geodesic dome outside Andover. 
So far, the distinguishing characteristics of Maine seem to be mud pits that may or may not have a bottom (I stepped in one and went past my knees before I caught myself and didn't reach the bottom) and hordes of mosquitos and flies. I've never used so much bug spray. 
I wanted to cross into Maine the day I left Gorham, but as soon as I started going uphill, I knew I want going to make it, so I had a slow 12 mile day and stopped early at a shelter next to a pond, where I soaked my ankles and took a nap. I shared the shelter with Jefe, a quiet retired guy, who is also pretty tired. 
On the 4th, I also only went about 12 miles, but it took most of the day. The Goose Eye mountains were surprisingly tough. I also went through the Mahoosuc notch, which is supposedly the hardest or most fun mile of the trail. It's essentially 3 fields of boulders that you have to climb over/under for a mile. I thought it was fun, but not as much fun as hiking above tree line and not as hard as some of the climbs I did. Then someone told me that the next climb was supposedly the hardest on the AT, so I decided that I would rather wait to do that tomorrow, and I camped on the North side of the notch with Jefe again and Bruiser, an older hippie lady, who raved about the Human Nature hostel, so I decided to check it out. 
Yesterday, even with the climb that was supposedly the toughest on the trail (it wasn't too bad), I got about 17 miles in. I went over the Mahoosuc arm, Old Speck, and Bald Pate mountains. The Bald Pates were my favorites, but it was brutally hot and muggy with no breeze, even above tree line, so I didn't stick around long. I also met Kip there. She's really fast and trying to do the whole trail in 100 days! I didn't make it to the road in time to catch the shuttle to the hostel, so I camped near the road next to a small waterfall and swimming hole.
While waiting for the morning shuttle pickup, I ran into Kip again. She gave me some super glue for my shoes, which are in the process of falling apart. I was going to try and switch them out for new ones soon, but now I might be able to get another hundred miles out on them! I will need to get a new pair of socks soon, though. I walked a hole in my favorite pair.
Update: The geodesic dome hostel is super cool. There's an outdoor shower, a ton of space, and they make REALLY good pancakes.","

Marina Santiago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618632,"I have almost no cell service in Maine, but I'm staying at a hostel tonight in Caratunk, Maine where I have wifi. 
Maine has more species of biting insects than anywhere I have ever been. At every camp site, the main topic of conversation is whether the mosquitos, black flies, or big horse flies are the worst. I think the big flies are the worst. I have to wrap my buff around my whole head so they don't bite my ears and scalp. 
I just passed the 500 mile mark yesterday. That felt good. I hadn't realized I had already made it this far. On the other hand, my right big toe has gone numb, and I think I'm allergic to something out here. My nose has been irritated and I'm getting a lot of nose bleeds. 
I've finally started to meet people I like, but unfortunately most of them are going south right now. Hopefully I'll meet them again once I flip back around. I spent a couple days with Jefe again. He has linked up with Cheerleader, Burn, and Wrong Way. Cheerleader invited me to her birthday party in Stratton, and I went for a quick drink and pint of ice cream, but then got back on the trail. I like Jefe, but I get weird vibes from Burn and Wrong Way, and Cheerleader is as ditzy and bubbly as her name suggests, so she drives me crazy. I've gotten ahead of them now, and I'll probably try and stay ahead of them.
Other highlights from the last few days include:-Staying at the Hiker Hut, a primitive cabin (no electricity or running water) that has a butterfly and humming bird garden. It's run by Steve and Tomb Raider. Tomb Raider had a very good dog named Levi.-I met another good dog named Mabel near Stratton. She belonged to Kitchen Sink. Mabel's bag of treats looked like my bag of cookies, so she begged for treats from me until her owner gave me some treats to give her. Then Mabel protected me from the mosquitos by sitting on my feet and snapping at mosquitos that came near. She was the best. Kitchen Sink carries a trumpet with him and played taps at night and reveille in the morning. -I've found a lot of wild strawberries-I crossed the kennebec river in a canoe today. It's the only river crossing on the trail that you can't ford or cross on a bridge.

I've averaged about 15.4 miles/day (including rest days), which puts me right at my expected average for the whole trail. I expect to speed up a bit on the way south (someone told me today that I've already done something like 80% of the elevation gain on the trail), so I should be done well before the end of October, if nothing goes wrong. 
I'm taking a rest day tomorrow, and then I'll enter the 100 mile wilderness.

Marina Santiago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619265,"I'm out of the hundred mile wilderness! I did it in four and a half days, and now I'm in the middle of nowhere in northern Maine. It's very rural. More dirt roads than paved. I'm far enough North now that it's light out really late and really early, so it's hard to sleep. People are really nice out here, and a lot of them seem really concerned about a woman doing the trail by herself. I guess it's good that people are looking out for each other, but I'm not used to so much concern.
The hardest part of the wilderness was how much food I had to carry the first few days. The second hardest part was the mosquitos. They swarm all over you and get in your eyes and nose (and probably mouth if I hiked with my mouth open). I probably killed fifty with just my eyelashes. On the third day of the wilderness, my bug spray broke open in my bag, so I was without bug spray for the last couple days, except when I was able to beg a couple squirts off of other people on the trail.
One of the nice parts of the wilderness was that I knew someone who was doing it at the same time. I met Murph back in NH, but he was a day ahead of me until Monson. He's an engineer and a pretty quiet solitary person, but we got along. We didn't hike together, but we happened to be going the same distance every day, and it was really nice to know that when I got to camp, there would be at least one face I recognized. The other nice part was the crazy geography. It's mostly flat with lots of lakes but also has big mountains and hills that rise out of nowhere. I'm assuming it was all caused by glaciers, but if it weren't for all the trees and lakes, I bet it would look like the mesas and buttes of the south west. The best parts were the flora and fauna. Lots of cool flowers, ferns, moss, and other swampy plants. I also got to see a beaver up close and some grouse chicks (very cute). 
The third day of the wilderness, I went 25.1 miles, which is a new distance record for me, and it only took 11 hours. I was mostly able to do it just because the last 10 miles were really flat, and if I hiked quickly, I created enough breeze to out pace some of the mosquitos. 
I hiked out of the wilderness yesterday and stayed at a private campground where I could take a shower and wash my clothes. It's been so hot and humid, I smelled absolutely foul and was sticking to everything. Today I had a short day and hiked 10 miles to the base of Katahdin. It stormed and rained for the whole hike. After I checked in at the ranger station, I was able to hitch hike into Millinocket. The rangers were skeptical of my plans, but I didn't want to pay $50 for a shuttle. I decided to give hitchhiking a shot anyway, and luckily within 15 min, a retiree from Illinois picked me up. He had been hiking on the trail with his wife but hated it, so now he's following his wife around, bringing her supplies and car camping, while she finishes the trail. Heidi will be picking me up soon. We'll camp tonight and do Katahdin tomorrow! After that, I'll head back to Boston for a day or two and then start south!","

Marina Santiago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619569,"I climbed mount Katahdin with Heidi! This marks the end of the first leg of my hike. I'm:A little over 30% done in terms of miles Done with 3 or of the 14 states it runs through (almost 4. I only have a few miles left in Massachusetts)Through the majority (someone told me 80% but I don't know if it's true) of the elevation gain and loss on the trail. Definitely the steepest parts are done. I've heard that in the south, the trail has switch backs and doesn't go straight up mountains. My knees are looking forward to that.Katahdin itself was a very unique mountain range. The trail starts easy but gradually gets steeper and steeper until there's a mile or so in the middle where you're scrambling hand over hand climbing a steep boulder pile. Then it levels off into an alpine table land with small, easy climbs to the different peaks. We had perfect weather and the view was phenomenal. I could see some of the mountains I climbed over at the beginning of the 100 mile wilderness, and all the forests and lakes in between. We had lunch at the top, which was crowded with people, and then headed down the mountain. We had heard rumors of rain and wanted to make it down the tough scrambling section before it got wet and slippery. I'd love to go back and spend a couple days hiking there.It ended up not raining, but it did finally cool off. We got back to our camp site, and cooked pasta over our campfire. We made Smores, and Heidi showed me how to make banana boats (bananas stuffed with marshmallows and chocolate and cooked in the fire). It's going to be hard to go back to eating tuna, clif bars, and rice sides after that feast. I'm in Boston now and looking forward to seeing friends and resting a little, but I'll be heading down to Great Barrington on Friday. I've been texting with some of the south bounders I met and liked. They're still a few weeks behind me, but maybe they'll catch up.","

I can already tell that it's getting darker earlier now that I'm further south, but I'm sure I'll still have plenty of daylight hiking hours for now. And I think I have enough food to get to NY before I'll need to resupply. We'll see how it goes though!","

Marina Santiago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620199,"I am now about ~787 miles (36%) in to the trail and staying at a motel in Fort Montgomery, NY tonight to shower and do my laundry. I've finished up MA and CT, and I'll finish up NY/NJ (the trail crosses the biggest a couple times) in the next week.
CT was surprisingly exciting. As soon as you enter the state, you climb to the highest point in the state and get a nice view of the area. I stayed that night in a shelter that didn't have a good water source because it had been so dry, but I was able to follow the muddy puddles upstream until I found a clear, cold puddle that must have been the source of the spring. A lot of water sources have started to dry up, and I'm carrying a lot more water now.
So far, CT and NY have had a lot of civilization compared to VT, NH, and ME. The downsides of this are lots of road noise and trash on the trail. The upside is that there are LOTS of cafes and delis within a half mile of the trail, so my diet has been more exciting than it was. I've been able to stop somewhere for breakfast or lunch almost every day. I've also been enjoying the easier terrain, and I can go the miles I want to while taking longer breaks and these detours for deli food and not being too exhausted at the end of the day. 
There's also been a lot of wild fruits to eat! CT mostly had blueberries and huckleberries. The blueberries were especially good but were mostly done bearing, so when I saw a bush that still had berries, I had to stop. This was how I almost stepped on a rattlesnake. I had just found a good blueberry patch and was walking down the trail looking not at the trail but at the side of it to see if there were more blueberries. The rattlesnake was apparently sunning itself in the middle of the trail, and rattled at me as I was about to walk on top of it. That was the first time I think I've heard a rattle in real life, but it's not a sound you need to have heard before to know you should back off. I instinctively stepped backward mid stride while my brain was still thinking, ""wow, that's a fat snake. It must have just eaten something big"". The snake also ran away off the trail, so I was able to keep going without bothering it. 
NY has fewer blueberries but lots of red raspberries, which are really good, and some blackberries (mostly unripe so far, and the ones that are ripe haven't been super sweet). 
It wasn't until my 4th day out from Great Barrington that I saw another south bounder. I actually met Bean Pot back in NH, so it was cool to see him again now that we're going the same direction. His name comes from the fact that when he was starting out, he packed a 7lb bag of 15 bean soup mix, not realizing you have to simmer it for 2 hours, which is not something you can do on the trail. Luckily he figured this out before he got on the trail, and he ended up cooking a huge pot of bean soup for the whole hostel. He's nice, but I'm not sure he's the brightest bulb. One time, he forgot his tent and had to hike back 3 miles to get it. He mostly hikes at night, but we've been crossing paths every once in a while the last couple days. It turns out that I'm close to the front of the south bounder pack, so it might be hard still to find people to hike with.
It's been pretty hot. One day, I think it got up to 97, so I've had to change my daily schedule a little. I still get up early and try to be on the trail by 6am, but I try to go hard and get most of the miles done by noon. Then I have a long lunch and hike slow and easy through the heat of the day. A couple times, this has included an hour or two of sitting in the shade when it gets too hot or when we get an afternoon thunder shower.

Marina Santiago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620280,"I woke up in the middle of the night last night sick with a stomach bug of some sort. Luckily, I was already in town, so I didn't have to hike while feeling disgusting, and the owner of the motel I'm staying at has been super nice. He was able to shuffle rooms to let me stay another night, and he went out to buy me crackers and ginger ale. I'm really hoping that I'll feel better by tomorrow morning, so I can keep going. This place isn't cheap. Not sure what the source of the stomach bug was. Water has been rare, so trail angels put out water caches, and some of those could have been contaminated. I also had a salad at a restaurant the night before, and maybe the spinach or lettuce didn't get washed well. It could be norovirus from some of the North bounders I've run into, and I'm really hoping it's not giardia because that can apparently last for weeks. I'm not too worried though. I'm feeling better now than I did last night, and it was bound to happen eventually, with how sensitive my stomach is. If I end up staying here for more than a day or so, I'll update the timings on my next mail drops.","

Marina Santiago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620609,"I am now about ~896 miles (41%) in to the trail and staying at a hostel in Delaware Water Gap, PA. I made it through the rest if New York and all of New Jersey over the lady couple days, and I am back on schedule after my mysterious illness.
The day I left Fort Montgomery, I still felt a little rough, and I did a slow 14 miles to Tiorati lake where I relaxed for a bit. The shelter I was planning on staying at was close by, but when I got there, I found that someone had left out all their food and trash. That shelter is one of the most notorious for bears, so I decided to go 3 miles further and stealth camp. 
It stormed really hard that night, but the next day, I ran into more south bounders: Glucose (he has type 1 diabetes) and Half Gallon (he loves milk and often packs out a half gallon of it). They are really nice and are going about the same pace as me. We crossed into NJ together, but they ended up staying in town while I pushed on to the next shelter. I saw them again the next night, and they were with another south bounder, Wombat, an engineer from Australia. I've been hiking with him for the last couple days, and it has been making the time fly. He's very interesting and talkative. 
We've seen some gorgeous sunrises and lots of snakes including a copperhead. I had my longest day miles wise today. We hiked 25.1 miles, but only took 8.5 hours. The terrain has been really easy, only a little rocky. The next couple days are supposed to be really rocky, but I think it's probably overblown by the North bounders who haven't run into many rocks yet.","

Marina Santiago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621106,"I'm over 1000 miles in, and about 47% done! I've been hiking with Glucose and Wombat for the last week (Half Gallon got a dream job offer and went home), and it has been a lot of fun to hike with other people. Wombat especially does some pretty big miles and hikes pretty fast, and it has been a bit of a challenge to keep up, but we've been making really good time across Pennsylvania.
All the North bounders warned us that Pennsylvania would slow us down because of all the rocks (they call it Rocksylvania), and it has been rocky, but it's so flat that we can still make good time. On the other hand, we've started calling it Hornetsylvania because I've been attacked by hornets or yellow jackets or something twice now. The first time, I stopped to dig a cat hole and got attacked and stung on the butt and legs as soon as I took off my shorts. I really don't recommend getting stung on the butt. The second time, both Glucose and I got stung, and it must have been a different type because the stings left little craters in my leg, and big blisters on Glucose. His looks like a chemical burn. 
Other than that, Pennsylvania has been really pretty. Lots of great views of rolling countryside and easy flat hiking. I've stayed at some beautiful campsites and stopped at some very idyllic lunch spots. They say the rest of the state is really easy, too, so I should be getting to Harper's Ferry (the halfway point) in about a week!","

We ended up doing just about 100 miles in only 4 days, and I'm looking forward to sleeping in a bit tomorrow.The rest of PA was relatively uneventful, though we did get attacked by hornets one more time. This time I only got stung once and Wombat got stung four times. Glucose got away this time, which was probably good considering how crazily his body reacted before. I still got stung most, so I guess I won that prize. Glucose's family came to visit him, so he dropped back to meet them. I think he'll be able to catch back up soon though. The day Glucose left, Wombat and I met Ahab, and the three of us spent the night at a hostel near the halfway point. We played piano and chess and had a good night. Since then, we've practically sprinted to Harper's Ferry. We have been getting a lot of thunder storms in the afternoons and evenings, so we try and get lots of miles in while the weather is good. There was one really intense storm a few nights ago. We saw a lot of trees down the next day. Yesterday, we ran into Capone, who was going to hike to the next shelter but got stuck in a storm, and we ended up hiking with him most of the day to Harper's Ferry. We hiked really fast, and I tripped going downhill and scraped up my knees. When we got into town, we learned that we were the 9th, 10th, and 11th South bounders, so we're definitely at the front of the pack.

It was the first time I hiked in the dark on this trip, and it was kind of nice: very cool, and I saw a little owl. I don't much like getting into camp after dark though. Anyone else there is already asleep, so you feel bad even just making noise while cooking dinner. Since leaving Harper's Ferry, we've been averaging about 29 miles/day. The first day that I did more than 30 miles was the same day that we went through ""The Roller Coaster,"" which consists of 12 miles of constant ups and downs, app I was pretty tired at the end of the day. The next day, we stopped in at Front Royal, VA where we ran into almost all the other South Bounders that we knew were somewhere near us: Bean Pot, Capone, Smokey, Celsius, and Sweet Cheeks (the only other thru hiking woman I've seen since I started South). It was really nice to hang out with them while showering and doing laundry, but I haven't seen any of them since a day or two after leaving Front Royal. They're probably nearby, but just hike later in the day than I do.The Shenandoahs have been gorgeous easy hiking, but it's been cold. I think I was starting to adapt to the 90+ degree weather, and so when it got down to 45 degrees one night, I had to wear all my clothes in my sleeping bag. The cool weather and easy terrain has made the miles fly by though. I also saw a bear pretty close climbing down a tree. It was young and terrified, but it was pretty cute. The last couple days, we've been hiking with Infra Red, an ex-special forces marine, who has pretty bad PTSD, and is dealing with it by hiking. He just started his thru hike, so is still getting his trail legs, but he kept up with us for most of the day. He's pretty tough. I'm taking an easy day in Waynesboro today, and after this, the trail will be paralleling the Blue Ridge Parkway. The mountains will be getting bigger, but I'm looking forward to the rest of Virginia!","

Marina Santiago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622220,"I'm now 1462 miles in, about halfway done with Virginia, and officially 2/3 done with the trail. Time has been flying lately. The second third seems to have taken a lot less time than the first third.
I'm in Dalesville for the day. We got up extra early and hiked down to town for breakfast. I forgot about labor day though, so now I have to stay in town until the post office opens tomorrow. I've got my bounce box there, but more importantly, I ordered new shoes to be sent there, and I don't think the ones I'm wearing will last another 10 miles. They are falling apart. I've worn them to smithereens.
I'm still enjoying Virginia, though there have been fewer amazing views than there was in the Shenandoahs. There have been a couple big mountains including The Priest (the register at the top was filled with entries beginning with ""forgive me father for I have sinned"") and Apple Orchard Mountain (no apple orchards at the top, but there were some at the base. I ate a lot of apples). 
The most exciting thing that has happened recently was Wombat getting attacked by more stinging insects. We were hiking along when we saw four hiking poles in the middle of the trail. At first we weren't sure what they were doing there, but then we saw the big swarm of hornets around them. Someone must have dropped them when the hornets attacked. I had no desire to get stung again, so I went way way around, but Wombat had just broken his third set of poles and wanted to rescue the ones on the ground. So, he planned to sprint through the hornets, grab the poles, and keep going, but he tripped and fell pretty much right into the nest as he bent down to pick up the poles, and he got stung everywhere, probably at least 20 times. I was worried I was going to have to go in and rescue him, but he was able to get up and run away. The hornets chased him for a long time, and he lost his water bottle in the process. I've heard of people going to the ER with fewer stings, so I gave him a ton of Benadryl, and he survived without a visit to the hospital. He was feeling really bad the rest of the day though. I managed to not get stung at all. We're both avoiding wasps, bees, and hornets like the plague now though.
Two days ago, we stayed at a really big shelter where we met Frenchie and Jockey, two out of the three South bounders that we knew were ahead of us. We've passed then up now, so now we're the second and third south bounders on the trail (out of a few hundred). There was also a really cute family at the same shelter: a dad and his son and daughter. They were only out for the weekend, but the kids were really excited to learn more about the Appalachian trail. We all played rummy together, and it ended up being a really nice night. 
Tomorrow, after breakfast, we'll head back out on the trail. We have the Virginia Triple Crown and the Grayson Highlands coming up, which I'm really looking forward to. I think I'll be able to get to Damascus around September 12th. After Damascus, my final bounce box will be in Hot Springs, NC (zipcode 28743) around September 22nd.","

We got a late start out of Daleville on the 3rd because I had to wait for the post office to open, but it was worth it. The outfitters there was also having a big Labor day sale, so I got a whole new hiking outfit. My old one had become pretty much permanently smelly, even after washing it. The first day out of Daleville, we saw the Tinker Cliffs, the first part of the Virginia Triple Crown, three amazing natural rock monuments that have some of the best views on the trail. That night, we stayed at a shelter with a really nice section hiker named Matt, and we all played rummy. Blister and Glucose caught up later in the evening, and we decided to get up extra early to eat breakfast and watch the sunrise from McAfee Knob (Triple Crown Part 2). It was still so dark when we got to the top that we actually stopped at the wrong place at first, but once it got lighter out, we found the right knob. It was amazing. I didn't expect it to live up to the hype, but it more than surpassed it. That view was one of the most amazing I've ever seen. We stayed there for an hour and a half, drinking in the view and taking pictures. 
That day ended up being REALLY hot, and the climb up Dragon's Tooth (Triple Crown Part 3) was the toughest since Maine. We had initially had grand plans to do our biggest mile day yet that day, but it was too hot, and we quit one shelter early. I was glad we did too because Jockey and Frenchie were there, and we had a nice South Bounder party. Glucose also offered to get us free white water rafting this weekend, the catch being that we had to get to Woods Hole Hostel by Friday night. That meant two 31 mile days in a row over really mountainous terrain. We did it in good time, hiking 10 or 11 hours/day,  pushing hard up the mountains and running down the other side. In total, we did about 90 miles in the last 3 days. Yesterday, the last day, we got up extra early, and hiked in the dark so we could get to the hostel earlier and because we knew there wasn't any water for at least 20 miles (there hasn't been rain in ages, and all the streams have dried up), so we wanted to hike in the cool dark as long as possible. It was really foggy at the top of the mountain, and it made the first few hours of the day feel surreal, like we were stuck in twilight. I also discovered that foggy rocky terrain is one of the few types of terrain where I'm a faster hiker than Wombat. 
We got to the hostel yesterday, and the hostel workers drove us into town for delicious Mexican food. We ended the day sitting on the front porch, singing songs and listening to Glucose playing guitar. I was absolutely exhausted but completely happy. I think it was a perfect day. 
The only challenge I've been experiencing is noseeums. They are eating my legs alive. At least, I'm assuming that's what is giving me itchy leg bumps. There aren't any mosquitos around. It's either that or I'm having some kind of reaction to the plants were hiking through. The trail hasn't been very well maintained around here and it's pretty overgrown. I just bought some anti itch stuff, though, which is helping a lot. 
We got up early for rafting today, but unfortunately found out that it has been so dry that the river is too low for rafting. We might try to meet up with Glucose's friend anyway, which I would like to do because I haven't hung out with another woman since I started heading South, and we'll take a well deserved rest day before continuing on tomorrow.","

Time and miles have been flying by. Mom should be meeting me here soon, and we'll do a couple short days of hiking together before I go back to long days.
We've been doing some pretty long days, too. It took 5 days to do the 150ish miles between Woods Hole Hostel and Damascus. We were hurrying, so I could make sure I got to Roan Mountain, TN tonight or tomorrow morning at the latest, so I could meet mom when she got here. The longest day we did was 35 miles, and the shortest day we did in those 5 days was supposed to be 28 miles, but we took a wrong turn, and it ended up being closer to 30. 
It was a pretty tough time especially because water is almost non existent. Luckily some people left water at a few roads. Otherwise, we might have gotten really dehydrated. I also managed to explode a bunch of honey inside my food bag, so everything got sticky, and I felt like bear bait. There were good things too though.
- One day we decided to stop early and camp by a stream. While eating dinner, we saw a snake fall out of a tree- The shelter near Mt Rogers visitor center is close enough to civilization that a pizza place delivered A TON of food to us. - The Grayson Highlands were magical. There are feral long horn cattle and ponies just walking around. We stayed at one of the highest shelters on trail. A pony tried to lick my salty legs while I was filtering water, and I woke up in the middle of the night to a pony hanging out by the shelter picnic table lit by a really bright full moon. Very surreal. - I also remet a couple people from my trip North. Steve was an older guy I met on my way down mt Madison in New Hampshire. And I just ran into Stitcher today. She was the flip flopper I met back in MA who was (and still is) taking dog tick medicine. She said she found one tick on her and it had died, so the dog medicine is working!

Marina Santiago,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623768,"So I'm done with the trail now, but it's been so long since I updated that I'll split it into two parts. The next update will be more of a summary of the whole experience. 
After the Roan Highlands, I stayed with a trail angel named Rob Bird for a few days. He's a native American and a former state trooper who now spends his time taking care of hikers in both MA and TN. He slack packed us for a few days, and though it should have given us a chance to relax and not carry our packs, we ended up running most of the miles. Since I haven't run in a while, my legs were really sore. Still, it was nice to cook for ourselves and sleep in a bed for a few days.
From the last of the slack packing, it was only a day and a half to Hot Springs, NC. We didn't spend the night there, but we got there early for breakfast and met up with Jefe, who was that older guy I saw a bunch in Maine. He's doing a wrap around hike, meaning that after he did Katahdin, he went down to the end of the trail in Georgia and starting heading north to Harper's Ferry. He's only going to make it to Damascus, VA this fall though. He'll finish up the trail in the spring. After breakfast, we splurged and went to the resort for an hour soak in the hot springs. It was super relaxing, and my legs felt better than they have for AGES. 
From Hot Springs, it wasn't too far to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. We had initially considered slowing down, but the way the shelters were spaced made it so we had to go back to doing 30+ mile days again. In fact, one day there wasn't water at the shelter we planned on staying at, so we did our longest day yet, 35.6 miles. It took 14 hours, but part of it was because there were a lot of people really excited to see thru hikers that were close to finishing, so they stopped us to chat and give us snacks. In general, since we hit the smokies, people have been giving us lots of free food, and it's very much appreciated. The smokies were gorgeous, but I'm glad we didn't spend too much time there because the trail and shelters were really crowded and most of them didn't have privies, just ""toilet areas"" where people were supposed to dig holes to poop in. Kind of gross.
For the last week or so of the trail, there aren't many towns, so we made our last stop for showers and laundry at the NOC (Nantahala Outdoor Center), a white water rafting complex right on the trail. And the day after, we made our last resupply stop in Franklin, NC. A really nice older couple picked us up and brought us into town, and they were also able to pick us up and bring its back to the trail because their errands in town took the same amount of time ours did.   
After that, it was kind of a blur to the finish. We did easier miles for a few days, but it didn't feel much easier because there were a lot of afternoon thunderstorms, so we were still getting up early and hiking fast to get under cover before it started raining. One day though, Murph, the flip flopper I hiked with through the hundred mile wilderness in Maine, hiked 5 miles in to bring me pizza and burritos. He had just finished the whole trail, and I think was looking for someone to celebrate with. It was good to see him again, and it felt good to have caught up with someone who had a 300 mile head start on me. 
I initially planned on finishing the trail on October 2, but Murph convinced us to stay at a stone cabin on top of Blood Mountain in Georgia because it has really nice sunsets. So we did a 29+ mile day to get there, and it was worth it. The view was phenomenal! We cooked dinner on top of the highest rock and watched the sun set over the mountains, with the leaves just starting to change colors. 
The next day we had the option of doing a shorter day and then summitting on the original day or going another 30 miles and finishing the trail a day early. Both of us knew we wouldn't be able to relax being that close to the end and not finishing so we decided to do the long day. After we went through the last gap, I saw a sign saying 4 miles to Springer Mountain, and I was so excited and crazed, I almost ran up the mountain. It rained for a little bit on the way up and the humidity meant I was absolutely drenched in sweat by the time I got to the top. We did actually run the last quarter mile or so. Getting to the top and finishing the trail was a very surreal feeling. I was pretty sad that the whole experience was over, but it feels good to have done it much faster than the average person, and I do feel pretty invincible now.","

Things I won't miss- Searching for and filtering water. It's been very dry- Carrying 30lbs on my back every day. The humidity has been rough with this. I've got some sores on my back that could use some healing
What I learned- Absolutely anything is possible with good companions. The people who were sad or who were quitting were usually the ones doing it alone. Humans are pack animals for sure.- Doing something so physically strenuous peels back all the artifice.  You can't help but be your most basic self. Most people's basic selves are very good, kind, and altruistic.- 90% of the time, if I'm sad and don't know why, I probably just need to eat","
