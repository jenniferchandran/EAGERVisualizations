TBD,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606885,"As I finish up today at work I can't hardly believe that I'll be retired in 15 days. I've spent the last 35 years working 24 hour shifts here at the firehouse in North St. Louis County. This is where this journey began. One night some 8 years ago I was watching a National Geographic show on the Appalachian Trail at work. Since then this has been my plan. I would retire hike the trail and transission into the next chapter of my life. I still love what I do professionally (especially the guys and gals I've done life with) but I'm ready for that next chapter. For the past several years I've followed others on Trail Journals, but now it's my turn. My Family, my wife, our 2 grown children and my son-in-law will be going on vacation to the Gulf Coast in mid March. On the way home I booked the night of March 20th at Amicalola Falls Lodge. On the 21st they will head north by vehicle and I'll head north by trail. Really looking forward to this.",,View Entry,"Feb 06, Wed",0
TBD,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606957,"As I've stated earlier I've been planning this thru hike for several years. In December I went to an Ortho to see why I was having so much pain in my right knee. After he had x-rays taken he told me I needed a total knee replacement. Needless to say I was upset and asked him when I should I have it done. He stated, ""yesterday"". I told him that I would be getting a second opinion. I then made an appointment with a well known Sports Doc in my area. After explaining to him my plans he said he thought he could help. He injected my knee with Cortisone that day. I didn't get much relief. I also was fitted for a brace and was to make a second appointment to receive a gel injection. I received that injection 2 weeks ago. I'm back to around 80%. I'm continuing to work out at the gym and doing several hikes. This past weekend I did an 8 mile hike on some serious uneven bad frozen trails afer a bad freezing rain here in St. Louis. My knee feels pretty good. Everything is a go. 6 more work days before my retirement. Then I'll have a month to really test it out.",,View Entry,"Feb 11, Mon",0
TBD,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607169,"On Feb. 23rd, 1983 I walked into the Fire House for the first time. That day I walking in with 3 oranges, a tooth brush and a tube of toothpaste. I didn't know anybody or what to expect. Today I'll walk out with fond memories and friendships that will last forever. As much as I've been blessed by this career and my brothers and sisters, I'm looking forward to the next chapter in my life. That starts with the AT. Looking forward to meeting new people and the friendships that will be.",,View Entry,"Feb 19, Tue",0
TBD,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608619,Didn’t have service last night. So let me recap Day 1. Lorie and the kids dropped me off a mile away from Springer Mt. it was hard seeing them leave. Made it up Springer and took a couple of pictures. I still struggle with how to put them in the journal. Today’s hike reminded me of Missouri as far as the climbs. Everywhere you turned there were beautiful views. Met several people today. A nice guy from Pittsburgh (he doesn’t have a trail name yet either) and a really good guy named Match’s from NH. Just as I was filtering water for the night it started raining and sleeting. Thankfully it didn’t last long. I set everything up and hung out by the shelter for a while. I know I was in bed by 6:30.During the night a near by army base was flying practice missions. They were really close. The winds gusted through out the night but the tent held up just fine.,"Springer Mountain

TBD,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608620,"Today was a really hard day. My knee brace is tearing up my thigh. The ups and downs were tough. 12.5 miles with just under 3000’ of climb. There was a big party being thrown tonight at Gooch campground. A lot of hikers had stopped there around 2:30. I decided to push on. As I was walking out of the Gap, this guy comes running up to me and said, “hey are you a thru hiker?”  I said, “that’s the plan but I’m taking it day by day”.  He them said you want an Apple. My first trail magic. I pushed on to Woody Gap, that made 12.5 and I wanted no more. As I walked up to a trash container to pitch my trash, this lady hollered to me “hey are you a thru hiker?” Again, I stated that was the plan. Her and her husband asked if I wanted a cold hamburger and a cold soda. I said that sounded wonderful. This couple lives in Pensacola, Fl. She thru hiked in 2000. I sat in their lawn chair and killed that burger. As we talked I realized that they were in the same 11 o’cloacknowledge church service at the Florabama as we were. They gave me a ride to a hostel I’m staying at. All by my self.","Hawk Mountain Shelter

TBD,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608670,"Woke up and hitched a ride back to Woody’s Gap. It was a beautiful spring weekend day and the trail was crowded. I again received trail magic from a church group out of Nashville. My knee brace is tearing up my leg. So I pulled it off after about 2 miles.Today was a lot of ups and downs. With the biggest up in Georgia. Blood Mountain, 4457’ in elevation. I want to tell you, it didn’t disappoint. The views were incredible. You could see downtown Atlanta. Those views didn’t come easy. Man, that was a real butt kicker. Then it was 2 miles straight down. As we ended the day at an outfitters in Neel Gap. I let the expert there go over my gear and do a shake down. I sent home a bunch of electronic stuff, (sorry Frank) my map book and some water socks. 2.5 lbs. Doesn’t sound like much but my knees will greatly appreciate it. The expert told me that I have to much food. Tonight I split a cabin with a guy from Pennsylvania. He’s young a pounds those hills.","Suches, GA

TBD,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608748,"Woke up today around 5:30. It was without a doubt the best night sleep I’ve gotten so far. We (Joe from Pennsylvania) immediately started with a big climb. Him only being 26, pulls ahead but never out of site. I have a feeling that is going to change. It was another beautiful day. I’m sweating like crazy. At around 9 miles we came down to a Gap and there was trail magic. It was a local Christian guy who offered a prayer over all of us. I gladly excepted. He also shocked me when he asked if he could make me a salad. I said sure. After that Joe and I had one last climb and a big down hill into the shelter. After setting everything up it was down for water make dinner, hang the bear bags. Update on the aches and pains: knee is starting to hurt more. Still not wearing my brace, trying to let my thigh heal. They’re forecasting 90% chance of rain tomorrow. We’ll see. Good night sweetheart.","Neel Gap

TBD,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608805,"Woke up around 5 o’clock and started packing everything up. I slept terrible last night. The ground wasn’t level, the guy two tents over was snoring so bad it sounded like an old chainsaw. Joe and I hit the trail around 7:30. We averaged 2 miles an hour with breaks and filtering water. I finally tried my sharp cedar cheese with spicy tuna fish tortilla. Not bad. First day it’s rained since I’ve started. Bad as bad as I thought it would be. So the last mile and a half to where I was ending for the day there was a 1000 foot descend from a bunch of wet rocks. It was brutal. I swore this is hit. Both of my knees were screaming. Joe and I hitched a ride to Hiawassee, Ga. The only rooms in town are at a Holiday Inn Express. We ate at a home cooked buffet, pretty good. Took a shower, icing my knee and getting ready for tomorrow.","Low Gap Shelter

TBD,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608907,"Got on the trail at 9:30. Started with a 1000’ climb into a 1000’ decline, into 1300’ climb up Tray mountain. It started pouring right at 3pm like my weather app said it would. The only problem, I didn’t get to this site until 4:30. Tent is up, wet clothes off and dry ones on. It’s suppose to rain until 10 or so tonight and then be really nice until Sunday. I’m cold and hungry. I’ll write more tomorrow. God Bless","Unicoi Gap

TBD,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608987,"Last night was rough. I hiked in a steady rain for an hour and a half. Set up my tent in the rain. The first thing I did was get out of those wet clothes. I ate a Cliff Bar and went to bed. It stopped raining sometime in the middle of the night. I woke up it was 34 degrees. I quickly put on my wet clothes, broke camp and started hiking. Today overall was a good day. I ate lunch with brothers from Colorado who hitch hiked to St. Louis and caught a Grayhound bus to Atlanta. They were drinking Hamm’s tall boys with their lunch. I can’t imagine carrying that extra weight. Oh to be young I guess. Tonight I’m staying in a 3 story shelter. I’m really hoping that there are no serious snores here tonight. We’ll see. Tomorrow I’ll be leaving Georgia. These mountains have been seriously hard.","Addis Camp Site

TBD,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609125,"First I want to thank all of you for the encouraging messages. Yesterday I made it through Georgia, took a pic and was ready to hit North Carolina. Well the first two mountains were killers. I finished after 12.2 miles and put up my tent. The temperature got down to around freezing. I don’t get cold, but my nose does. (Listen no nose jokes, I know it’s big) anyway, I stick my nose under the covers to warm it up. Well my nose smells my 4 days of not showering arm pits and butt. I sleep with a cold nose. Today we (Joe and I) planned on doing 11.2 miles. That would leave us 12 miles into Franklin, NC on Saturday. We got to the campsite at 1:00, we pushed on. We climbed Mt. Albert today (at the end of the day). It was a killer, some 500-600 of incline in a little over a quarter mile. It was worth it, the view from the fire tower at the top was unbelievable. They say you can see the Smokies from the tower and there 65 miles away. As we started coming down Mt. Albert we passed the 100 mile mark. It was a great day.","Plumorchard gap shelter.

TBD,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609155,"Slept terrible last night, maybe got 3 hours. I would have thought after such a big mile day I’d slept solid but I can’t turn my mind off. Anyway, I got on the trail around 7:45 with 7.2 miles to where we’d hitch hike into Franklin. About 3 miles into today’s hike, Joe and I started coming down into Rock Gap. It was on a paved road with a paved parking lot. There were a few cars parked, so I said “I wonder if they’ll be any trail magic”.  Joe said, “he hoped someone was handing out Coke’s. No such luck. But I looked across the parking lot where the trail picks up and there sitting beside the trail was a 12 pack of Coke a Cola. I said look. We both ran to the box. Joe picked it up, there was only one soda. He told me to take it. I said no, he called it, it was his. Joe said let’s split it. So we did. You would have thought someone gave us a thousand dollars. That one soda from a Trail Angel made our morning. Life is really simple out here. We finished our hike and ended up in Winding Stair Gap. As we came off the trail there was a huge motor home with a couple of Trail Angels making breakfast burritos. We each had one and hitched a ride to Franklin, NC. The car was a compact and three full size guys sat in the backseat. I was in the middle. A mile into a 15 mile ride my knee started hurting. I mean bad, on a scale of 1 to 10 I’m talking a solid 7. I thought I was going to puke it hurt so bad. Joe noticed and tried to make as much room as possible but nothing helped. This nice family dropped us off right at our motel. Once I got out of the car the pain went right away. Praise God. First things first, I went to Hudle House and ate $16 worth of breakfast, showered and now planning on laundry, shopping and sleeping. Tomorrow I’ll be zeroing. That’s just hanging here resting and planning next week.","Long Branch Shelter

TBD,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609227,Woke up in a nice warm bed. Went to Ingel’s a Local grocery store here to resupply for the next two days until we get to the NOC. As we walked in we found out they sell breakfasts there for $5. Pounded this breakfast and bought just enough food. I’m starting to get this down a little better. I still have food from ten days ago. I’m tired of carrying to much. The rest of today will be spent stretching and icing down my knee. Oh and getting ready for the Duke/Michigan State game. Go Big 10. A big shout out to my family at Simple this morning.,"Winding Stair Gap

TBD,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609366,"Caught a ride back to the trail. Got there around 8:00. It was 27 degrees and sunny when we started. A perfect day to hike. We started a 1200 foot climb right out of the gate. I felt pretty good. A little knee pain but I’ve had that every day out here. 3 miles in and my knee started really hurting. I was falling back and Joe was gone. About 5 miles in there was Joe filtering water waiting for me. I told him about the knee. We hiked on. A couple of more miles I knew I had to get off the trail and get this looked at. Neither of us had cell service. At 8 miles Joe got service and I called an Uber driver with 4 wheel drive to pick us up at the firetower. (See the picture above, what a view). Joe came with me back to Franklin, I got a room and found a Ortho just 3/4 miles away. I limped to his office. Now it wasn’t just knee pain but my hip and back were killing me too. I guess I was compensating for my knee Once there the Dr. came in and said he wanted to get some x-rays but first we talked. After talking he said he didn’t need the x-rays. He said, “stop doing what aggravating my knee, rest for three days, ice it and take 800 milligrams of vitamin I 3 times a day”. I told him that I was thru hiking the AT. He just shrugged his shoulders and said “I don’t think so “. I limped back to the hotel in deep thought. I’m going to take the next couple of days off and maybe try a slack pack (that’s only carrying the essentials) and see if it’s any better. This is where Joe and I will separate. Say a prayer for him, he’s a great kid and maybe one for my knee as well. This isn’t what I had planned but I knew my knee situation before I left St. Louis. In closing I want to wish good luck to all my friends running in elections today.
