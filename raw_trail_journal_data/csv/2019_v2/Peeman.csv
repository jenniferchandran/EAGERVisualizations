Peeman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/544190,"My son is a rising sophomore in high school. He is home schooled, independent minded, and he has a dream: To be self sufficient. To live off the land. To live on a secluded island. I am a highly motivated, obsessive-compulsive, urologist, who put off ""living"" to accomplish just about everything in life I wanted. I sacrificed a lot to become a very successful urologist. Now, we share a dream as a father, as a son, with way too much estrogen in our family. I love my wife and 4 daughters, and so does my son, but there comes a time in life, when a father and son need to live from that place in our hearts that says ""Seize the moment"", ""Live the dream"", ""Go for the Gusto"". It makes no sense for me to leave my urology practice for 4-6 months, and financially, it is somewhat of a suicide, but we only live once. My wife will have to make sacrifices, and we will miss the girls. But, for once, we are going to go for it. We have 3 years to plan. He will be in charge of the gear; I will be in charge of the finances. We have the support of the rest of the family. And, we are going to live out a dream. We look forward to getting off the grid, spending time with one another, and doing something that really won't make a lot of sense to a lot of people. David, I love you. Let's do this.","Southboung

Peeman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/545711,"Well, I know it,s a long time until we depart. Nearly three years to go. And, so far, my son David and I are facing doubters. Mainly, I doubt my ability to follow-thru with our pans, our dream. The reality of leaving my wife and girls (one just started Univerist of Tennessee) is something I am trying to keep out of my mind. My wife has her own dreams, mainly having to do with Uganda, and she of course, is concerned about raising a family without me for 6 months.    And, a lot can happen in three years.I told my financial planner - not the craziest idea he has heard of, but nonetheless, I don't think he was too pleased. David is the chief operating officer for the trip. I am the CFO. I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW I AM GOING TO COVER THE COST, WHICH ISNT REALLY THE BIG DEAL. THE BIGGER DEAL, IS HOW I AM GOING TO TELL MY PARTNERS. I am in a 6 man urology group, and we have never sponsored a partner's sabbatical because doctors DO NOT take sabbaticals, unless they are addicted to drugs, and need to go to rehab. It's going to take some negotiatiating. I can't just google ""doctors financial advice Appalachian Trail"" to get the plan in place. That's up to me. And, I doubt my ability to do it. Maybe because I am feeling selfish. Maybe because the practical side of me says it's not wise. Or maybe because I am scared and living by the motto ""Just Do It"" or YOLO hasn't been my modus operandi. In any case, it's part of the adventure, the calling, the dream. And maybe it won't come soon enough. I have become a callous Doctor, not the kind of Doctor I want to be. need a break. And, to take that break, I am going to have to do something that most doctors don't do: think outside the box.","Murfreesboro, TN

Peeman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578334,"So, here I sit watching SEC football (Go Dores), and thinking about the trip for next Saturday. I promised David that we would go hiking for Fall break. We had wanted to thru-hike the AT, but at this point, we just need to start. I am a bit daunted by the planning because I have to take responsibility for something I have no real experience in.  I can look on the web all day, but in the end, let's face it, I am winging. And, if I am winging it, why plan?  My main concern at this point is that we only have a week to hike. I don't know how far we can go, or how it will go, but I do want to get back to my car.  Where am I going to park my car?  How are we going to get back?   So, any advice at this point would be very appreciated.  The starting is the hardest part. Always. I don't care what you are doing in your life, but that is always the thing that keeps me from making changes in life. When we start next  Saturday, its going to be a learning adventure. And we are going to have a great time. So, until then, I am going to stress and I am going to try to figure it out.  I can't wait to spend one week hiking the trail with David.","Appalachian Trail

Peeman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579264,"So, we did not start from Springer mountain though that was the original plan. When I started calling to arrange a shuttle, one of the shuttle drivers said that there were tons of trees down from Springer mountain because of the recent hurricane and they were pulling exhausted hikers off the trail. It did not sound like the way we should experience our first AT hike.  So,  I chose Damascus as a starting location which turned out to be a wise decision.  Firstly, the weather was perfect for the week. Secondly, the views were spectacular. And mostly, my son and I had a great time.  We hiked 10-6-12-16-10-10 miles (roughly) for the week.  Neither one of us were in particularly great shape, but I think I surprised my son with my hill climbing abilities...and I had the heavier pack!  He suffered from bilateral achilles tenderness -  clearly needs better hiking shoes.  I just want to thank Lumpy from Mt. Rogers Outfitters for the help in selecting a route and giving us a ride.  He also told us some great stories! And then there were all the other hikers we met along the way, especially Hot Mess, Bog Angel, and Milkshake at Trimp Shelter who gave us all kinds of hiking/backpacking advice. I also have to give a shout out to Liberty, Rocky, and Giggles, Morrocco Mole and Lil' Woofer (dog), and other such as Sriracha (hope you enjoyed the bottle I gave you!), Okay, Happy Feet, Dirt, and others along the way.  I've already made some equipment adjustments such as buying a Sawyer system (the pump system got clogged by day 3), and David has started looking at alcohol stoves  - though I still love the Jet Boil system.We are definitely both hooked on the A.T. and looking forward to getting real trail names and experiencing the the A.T. further. We are dreaming about a thru hike in 2019!","Damascus
