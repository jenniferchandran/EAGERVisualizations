Trail Portage Dude,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622196,"""Heaven is both present and future. As you walk along your life-path holding My hand, you are already in touch with the presence of heaven: nearness to me. You can also find many hints of heaven along your pathway, because the earth is radiantly alive with My presence. Shimmering sunshine awakens your heart, gently reminding you of My brilliant light. Birds and flowers, trees and skies evoke praises to My holy Name. Keep your eyes and ears fully open as you journey with me.""",,View Entry,"Sep 02, Mon",0
Trail Portage Dude,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622508,"While our 'sobos' continue to enjoy summer weather, we in Warwick are reveling in cooler temperatures, especially in the evenings. There will be little leaf-peeping here, as the leaves turn from green to brown, but who can say what the hikers will experience? Warwick is a bit lonelier, but so enriched from all our visitors this summer. I am back in the university classroom, and have so much inspiration to share this semester. Thank you, thank you thank you.Road Portage Dude (R P D)",,View Entry,"Sep 06, Fri",0
