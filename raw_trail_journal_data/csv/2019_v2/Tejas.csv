Tejas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626674,"The Appalachian Trail did not exist for me until the year I turned 26. I had been teaching at Texas A&M and took a one year teaching job at East Stroudsburg University in Pennsylvania. That location is very close to where the Appalachian Trail crosses through Delaware Water Gap. The Fall and Spring, I did a lot of hiking with my dog Rebel on the AT. I bought the guidebook for the Pennsylvania and New Jersey Section. Rebel and I would drive to a trailhead and hike out to the midway point to the next trailhead and return. We put the pieces together in a series of out and backs for several sections of the trail. I then moved on to other thing in my life.",,View Entry,"Aug 07, Mon",0
Tejas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626676,Flash forward several years. I am back teaching at Texas A&M and married now with 3 months off in the summer. My husband and our dog Chama decided to do the Appalachian Trail with no planning or real thought. We drove to Amicalola Falls and left our pickup there in May of 2004? We took off hiking. I don't remember too much of that hike except that we only made it as far as Three Forks with it raining all day for two of the three days we hiked. I decided I didn't want to spend my precious summer getting rained on every day so we hiked back to our truck and headed west to spend our summer out west.,,View Entry,"May 14, Mon",0
Tejas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626677,"I forgot about the AT for awhile but soon it started coming back into my consciousness. I really wanted to hike it but now I was married to my husband Steve. We have a Bernese Mountain dog and other things to consider such as jobs. I kept wracking my brain trying to figure out how I could do the hike with others to consider. My husband retired so the chance finally came along. We planned to hike the Georgia section as a series of day hikes in the spring of 2019. It would be a start. I was very excited planning the trip. My husband was not. It was on my bucket list, not his. He had no intention of letting me hike the trail alone though so we finally sat down and finalized plans. I had meshed out a framework but I am a Gemini so it left a lot to chance. My husband Steve looked at it with his Virgo eyes and improved upon the plan until we thought we would have one that would work. We set the date for a two week trip and booked our flights.",,View Entry,"Jan 01, Tue",0
Tejas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626691,"So, we now have a plan in place to do the Georgia section of the trail over a two week period in April. I wanted to include the approach trail from Amicalola Falls because it is such a neat start to the trail with the arch and falls. We planned to rent 2 vehicles to be able to set up each day's hike without backtracking. My husband has no desire to backpack so we planned to spend each night in a hotel. This would be a test run to see if I could convince my husband to do this with me and to see what it would look like. I was excited to say the least!",,View Entry,"Mar 01, Fri",0
Tejas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626692,"We left our Bernese mountain dog, Tucker with an aunt of his and caught the early morning flight out of Montana. After a layover in Denver, we finally arrived in Atlanta where we picked up two small pickups for the trip. Our plan was to drive to Ellijay where we would spend the first few nights. The trip out of Atlanta was my worst nightmare. We were in an unfamiliar city in unfamiliar vehicles leaving at 5:30 to head north in solid rush hour traffic. To top it off a thunderstorm hit and was dumping gallons of water out of the sky. We only passed one wreck though and finally made it to our destination. Tomorrow starts the 2nd attempt!",,View Entry,"Apr 09, Tue",0
Tejas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626700,"We got up early with a plan to drive to the Gap below Springer Mountain. We actually ended up at the Benton McKaye Trail where it crossed the road and started from there. That added 1.5 miles to what was supposed to be a 7.6 mile day. We crossed several easy stream crossings by rock hopping. The big rain from yesterday had all the little streams flowing. We saw several backpackers starting their NOBO treks - one solo female, 2 couples and 4 solo males. We stopped for a break at the Stover Creek shelter and signed the logbook. It was a nice enough looking shelter. There were plenty of parked out campsites near water all during our hike today. We made the short trip to Long Falls. It was worth the side trip. There were 4 day-hikers there that we chatted with for a little while. A second highlight of the day was a large hollowed out tree that was very cool. It was hot and sunny today. The first part of the day was cool and green with a lot of hiking through rhododendron. The second half was hot and dry. This was the longest hike for Steve since we have been married (almost 10 years)! We visited Hickory Flats Cemetary where there was a pavilion. I found a gravestone dating from 1903.","Big Stamp Gap

Tejas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626702,We parked at the correct trailhead to access Springer Mountain  today and hiked the mile up to the summit in a dripping fog. There were no views to be had but we signed the summit register and took pictures anyway. We then started down to Amicalola Falls. I had already done this section as an up several years ago and didn't want to kill my husband so we had decided down was the better choice for his sake. We stopped at Black Gap Shelter - another neat little shelter. All the traffic was NOBO and there was quite a bit of traffic. Lots of people with clean clothes and big packs and big plans. Dirty Girl gaiters seemed to be the trail norm in all sorts of different colors. We finally ran out of the first group of backpackers by the time we reached Black Gap Shelter so we had the place to ourselves for a little break. The second wave of backpackers starting the day from Amicalola Falls didn't hit until a little later around the top of Frost Mountain where we stopped for lunch. The fog had burned off by then giving us good views of the valley below. Amicalola Falls was beautiful. We took the never-ending 602 steps to the base of the falls and then went to get our picture taken at the arch. We drove back up to Big Stamp Gap and hiked the 0.3 miles down and back to connect with where we had joined the trail from the Benton McKaye trail yesterday. Then it was back to the hotel for another night in a bed.,"Big Stamp Gap

Tejas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626719,"Today it rained on and off the whole time we were setting up our shuttle for the day. The last 15 miles of driving was in a dense fog as well. We immediately started up from Hightower Gap when we finally started hiking. I wondered how many of guys with Budweiser tumors and chunky gals I saw starting the trail the last couple of days would make it all the way to Khatadin. If they did, I'd hazard a guess they wouldn't be sporting the tumors by then. One guy coming off the trail as we were prepping to start at the Gap said he was through. He has a lot of company as a lot of people drop out in the first 100 miles. We still had the fog with us on top of Sassafras Mountain. It finally burned off and we had a nice sunny day for the last half of our hike though. Several backpackers passed us during the day. Some we would see again, some not. Gooch Shelter appeared to be filling up as we passed it around 2:30. An older couple that had already finished the Triple Crown passed us in trail shoes or tennis shoes. Their packs were about the size of Steve's daypack. They were headed to Woody Gap for the night. Both Steve and I were wearing light hikers. I might rethink that for next year though. I watched as people who had started the trail solo were starting to socialize and get to know each other. I'm sure some of them bonded enough to hike together at least for awhile. Trail communities tend to be pretty fluid in general. Staying together at the shelters and sharing stories was helping to build the community as well. I felt like an outsider but HYOH.","Hightower Gap

Tejas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626720,"We jumped ahead today and did the short stretch over Blood Mountain due to a storm forecast to roll in tomorrow. We hiked up the Jarrad Gap Trail to the AT and then continued on to the top of Blood Mountain. I was happy that although it wasn't sunny, there were still good views.  The shelter on top of Blood Mountain was made of stone and not any place I would want to spend the night. It just looked like a really cold, dark place to sleep. I guess if you got caught on top in a storm it would look pretty good though. Everything is relative. There were a lot of people and dogs on the trail today since it was a Saturday. Somehow I managed to lose the key to my rental vehicle so we will have to resolve that tomorrow. We do not have a spare. We finished the day at Mountain Crossings where we each got a t-shirt. I also got a sticker that said hike faster, I hear banjos. The people we have run into so far all seem to be pretty normal people out here hiking and nice folks. I wasn't really sure what to expect. My line of work tends to have me looking for the shady side of people rather than the positive side so I was very pleasantly surprised. Steve has been dead set against me hiking on this trail by myself but I think this year's hike did a lot to allay his fears. The thru hikers are all mostly using two hiking poles and moving faster than us. They have deadlines to meet, especially starting in April. The clock is ticking. The vast majority of the folks through hiking are past this point at this time. We are seeing the tail end of the bubble. Steve talked his way out of a ticket for parking where we shouldn't have parked. We hitched a ride back to our other truck with a nice couple that drove well out of their way to take us where we needed to go after hearing our story. Still no sign of my key even after retracing my steps up the Jarrad Gap trail part way. We moved on to Blairsville for the next few nights. Driving around this part of Georgia, I've seen names of places like Turniptown, Booger Hollow and and Possum Holler but I haven't heard any banjos yet.","Jarrad Gap

Tejas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626721,Today was a zero day and a very frustrating day at that trying to resolve the lack of a car key. We drove to Atlanta because we were told they could make a key there at the car rental place after the local locksmith declined to drive to the trailhead. We got there and found they couldn't do it on a Sunday. We finally ended up renting another vehicle from the local car rental place and had the other car towed back to the car rental place. I thought it was going to cost us a ton of money for all this but between our insurance and rental coverage we came out pretty good. Side note - we ended up finding the key a few days later in the sunglass holder of the other truck so now we had a key without a vehicle. The rest of the trip we were constantly double checking where our keys were. Steve was actually a very good sport about it all. I was the one that got the most frustrated as is often the case. I guess the timing was good as it rained most of the day.,"

Tejas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626723,"We got a late start today as we had to wait for the tow of the vehicle and for the rental place to open to pick up our new vehicle. As a result we didn't get onto the trail until 1:45 pm. We took off from the Walasi-Yi Center and climbed Levelland Mountain, Wolf Laurel Mountain and Cowrock Mountain. A severe storm had pushed through yesterday leaving it clear, windy and cold at 47 degrees in the heat of the day. I was cold most of the day especially when exposed to the wind coming from the west. I was happy to see trail sections down off the ridgeline on the east side of mountains for the wind break. We put in our most elevation gain in one day today. Cowrock Mountain had the best views - looking down on Town Creek drainage and across at Wildcat Mountain. You could see spring bursting out in the valleys down below as trees started to leaf out. Spring hadn't made it to our ridgetops yet though. We saw our first ail magic at Tesnatee Gap where two guys were handing out hot chocolate, cookies and candy. I told them we were just day hikers but they said grab some stuff anyway and made us feel like part of the group. We talked awhile before continuing on to our toughest climb of the trip up Wildcat Mountain. People were loving the hot cocoa and I wasn't any different. We actually passed a backpacker - a older heavy set female slowly making her way up Wildcat Mountain.","Neal Gap

Tejas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626734,"Today the temperature was 37 degrees when we got started but it quickly warmed up, There was a bright sun with no wind.  The hiking today was pretty easy relatively speaking. There were a couple of harder climbs but nothing we couldn't handle. We climbed up Ramrock Mountain and could actually see the tall buildings of Atlanta in the hazy distance to the south. Preaching Rock provided great views out to the east. I felt obliged to stand on it and recite what I knew of the Friends, Romans, countrymen lend me your ears speech. :) We saw some more thru hikers today but there aren't many coming through anymore as most are further down the trail. It has been fun watching the trees begin to leaf out and the flowers start to bloom this week. We have seen lots of violets, trillium and may apples. From the high points we can see the green of spring down below. We did over 10 miles today, ending at Winfield Scott Recreation Area where we soaked our sore feet in the lake there. We ran into a Georgia ATC guy who told us unabashedly that this was the best maintained section of trail by the best club on the best trail in the world. I'm not completely sure about his logic but he was obviously very proud of his club, the trail and the work they do. I am very happy that people out there have a passion for the trail. We didn't know it at the time but where we stationed one of our vehicles at Lake Winfield Scott Recreation area was in a no parking zone. The camp host left a nasty note on our truck so we went to talk to him and try to smooth over his ruffled feathers. That was a good job for Steve and he got it done. :) 
  We moved to Helen, Georgia for the next few nights. It is a very cool little trail town with a German theme. It was kinda before tourist season so we didn't have to put up with the complete craziness I'm sure the place gets in the summer. The north Georgia mountains seems to be where Atlanta goes in the summer to escape the heat. There was a very cool little country store across from our hotel with all kinds of neat things inside including old time candy, all kinds of trail treats, and moonshine flavored preserves. 
  We didn't do a whole lot of training for this hike this year and it showed. Both of us are nursing multiple blisters on our feet. We are using a lot of moleskin.","Gooch Gap

Tejas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626746,"We got a good night's sleep last night and needed it for the 2.4 mile hike in and up from Jack's Gap to the AT at Chattahoochee Gap. 6.5 miles made for a short day of hiking though. We seem to be getting stronger because it seemed to be a fairly easy day in spite of starting out with three steep climbs to small peaks that went straight up with no switchbacks. And that was just to get to the AT.  I have been very proud of Steve on this hike. He is actually often coming out better off then me after each day of hiking. I have high hopes for this plan of how to hike the AT to actually work out! He seems to be enjoying himself which is good as well.
  We continue to see some folks each day who are planning to thru hike. One good thing about starting later like this for them is that they do not need to fight for places to stay or for services. Today was another beautiful sunny day that started at 47 degrees and hit 76 degrees by the time we finished. We had great views most of the day as our route followed several ridgelines. After we finished we went to Betty's store in Helen for a sandwich - a very cool country store with outdoor tables in the shade. I love that store!","Jacks Gap

Tejas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626748,Today was our longest and fastest paced day yet. The terrain was rolling today with nothing too crazy. We only saw 3 people all day - a guy and 2 girls all backpacking and all hiking solo. The storm coming tonight is on everybody's minds I'm sure. I finally saw some bloodroot in bloom. There are a lot of flowers coming out now. The trail out was a brutal downhill sketched into the side of the hills. It took us straight up and down over a peak called Eagle Rest. I now have 3 blisters that haven't popped on my feet that I am nursing. Tomorrow is scheduled to be less than 5 miles but could be in a downpour.,"Hogpen Gap

Tejas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626819,"We got an early start today and hiked in a steady drip most of the day. When it wasn't lightly raining it was snowing. We actually hiked in quite a bit of snow today. The creeks were full from the rainstorm yesterday. The trail had a fair amount of mud and water on it. I've been amazed how well the trail holds up under the deluges with all of the foot traffic on it. We saw a few people out hiking and backpacking in the rain. All of them seemed positive and upbeat, including one man who was using an umbrella and hiking with a dog. This section had a lot of climbing in it for a short section.","Unicoi Gap

Tejas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626820,We finished our first hike today rather early so we decided to knock off another section. By doing this we would still have a shot at finishing all of the Georgia section of the AT this trip. The afternoon was a carbon copy of the morning hike - lots of hiking in rain and snow. We got it done though and wound up with over 3000 feet of elevation gain for the day. Two sections to go to complete the Georgia section of the AT!,"Dick's Creek Gap

Tejas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626824,"Today dawned windy and cold but it wasn't snowing at least and the sun came out for us. It was a beautiful Easter Day. We started with a cold climb up Tray Mountain. Just getting to the trailhead was an adventure. We had come in from the Helen side earlier in the trip and in trying to go out another way, we ran into a creek overflowing its banks that had the road completely blocked off. Normally we would have been able to drive through but not with the water running as high as it was. It was only 1/2 mile from the paved highway so we had to backtrack 10 miles of sketchy dirt road to get out of there. A local shuttler then told us of another route to the Tray Gap Road. We used that route today. It had a couple of sketchy places but al in all was a good way to get to Tray Mountain. It involved a long time on dirt though. 
  We started with a cold climb up Tray Mountain, the first of 2 big mountains to climb today. This turned out to be our longest day of hiking in Georgia. Throughout the day, when we were on the east facing slopes with the sun and no wind, it was very pleasant. On the west facing slopes without the sun and a wind, it was downright chilly. We saw quite a lot of people out backpacking and day-hiking today enjoying Easter Sunday. We ran into some folks out for a Sunday stroll after church and they mentioned they would be coming to Glacier National Park for their vacation this summer. I found it somewhat ironic that we were vacationing at their home area and they would be spending their vacation in our home area.","Tray Gap

Tejas,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/626825,"Well, we finished the Georgia section today, yeah! Steve took our 2-wheel drive rental pickup up the 4x4 road all the way to Blue Ridge Gap to save us some hiking distance. I was glad he was driving as I never would have made it that far. We had a very pleasant hike on a bright sunny day. We saw lots of backpackers today. All seemed to be very excited to make it to the Georgia border and put their first state behind them. Only 12 more to go for the thru hikers. We almost missed the sign at the border as it is small and not facing toward the trail. We got pics of us at the border and took other people's pictures there as well. We then walked the short distance to Bly Gap to see the old tree there. This will be our starting point next year to continue north. I was excited to have our first state done but also a little sad the trip was coming to an end. We returned back the way we came to Blue Ridge Gap and then started the drive back to Atlanta to fly out the next day. 
   I wound up with 3 blisters during the trip, none of which popped. It was interesting that during the first week of travel we never thought about where we sat for breaks. During the second week as things started to green up, the poison ivy came out in full force, We had to be careful where we sat to avoid coming in contact with it. I got a small case of poison ivy rash on one hand. I also wound up with a sore right knee and sore heels. My knee would keep me from acing my fitness test for work a couple weeks later but eventually healed. I still did well enough on the test to pass though. We had a total of 18851 feet of elevation gain for the Georgia section and wound up with 97.16 miles of hiking. Steve surprised me with how well he did. He fared better than me and was the stronger hiker of us two. It showed me I need to put some training in for next year's section if I would like to fully enjoy it.
  Hike faster - I hear banjos. We said that a lot to each other to help motivate us. :)
  Carry on sweet southern comfort carry on - song that seemed to be stuck in my head a lot..
  I can't see this world unless I go outside my southern comfort zone - another song stuck in my head..
  Toby hiked with us a lot. He is a Bernese Mountain dog we lost to cancer a couple of years ago and the sweetest dog. He still hikes with us but now he doesn't get tired and doesn't need me to carry water for him. I still miss my little boy. Heaven called him back home too soon but I know he is up there watching over me and hiking with me. 
  There is supposed to be 30000 deer in Georgia. I never saw any of them or even any sign of them.
  The trail in Georgia is very well maintained with very little trash and great tread. I'm sure a big shout out needs to go the Georgia ATC.
  I was amazed at the sheer numbers of backpacker I saw.
  I was amazed at how safe a place the trail felt.
  1000 feet is a long climb in this part of the world. The climbs are short but the ups and downs are pretty steep.
I had a blast and am already looking forward to next year!","Blue Ridge Gap
