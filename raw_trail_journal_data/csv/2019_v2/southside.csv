Not too bad.On Weds,  at 6:10 am i catch a train from Providence to Harpers Ferry and i arrive at 5:10pm. first night i have reservations at the Teahorse Hostel. Thursday i hit the trail and head north to the Mass pike approximately 500 miles. I have done this section once in 2010 and it took me 38 days.

southside,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610093,"This has been one hell of a trip, originally i was going to do 6wks and maybe 500+ miles. Well after the first day i new that wasn't likely. So i adjusted my goals to as many as i could [days and or miles] then after 3 days i started peeing blood. Sure sign of kidney stones, and after 2 restless nights i realized this might not be  the best month for this trip. So when i got to highway 30 in PA i hitched a ride into Gettysburg. From there i got a hotel room, and a rental car. I will drive the 7 hrs home tomorrow.Hopefully Squire and I can go for a section hike this summer.Lata southside","tumbling run shelter
