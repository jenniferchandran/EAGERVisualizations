Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613268,"I’m Spike’s Mom.  I am a social science professor who decided to not renew her contract for the next school year and go for a hike instead.  I still need to finish up this semester, so I will be starting in late May and doing a flip-flop of the AT.  The plan is to start in Southern Virginia, hike north to Katahdin, drive back to southern Virginia, and then hike south to Springer.  As I have begun to tell people of my plans, here are the questions people have been asking:Are you hiking *alone*?!?!No, I’m Spike’s Mom, so I am bringing Spike.  He’s a stuffed rhino (Beanie Baby, to be exact) who likes to hike.  Spike also has a dad who will be staying home to work in order to fund this adventure and watch the rest of our crash.
Also, I have invited one of Spike’s cousins and she has agreed to come.  Spike has 20 cousins (not counting cousins-in-law), but there was one that was the right age, gender, and fitness level to join us on this journey (let’s be honest, I’ll be slowing her down).  We invited her and she has decided to come with us!Finally, it is the Appalachian Trail.  Thousands of people hike it every year – are you ever truly hiking “alone”?Are you bringing a gun?Um, no.  I don’t know how to use a gun.  I am definitely not willing to carry something that heavy (someone told me that they are not *that* heavy, but then I reminded them that it would be silly to carry a gun without ammunition).  I will be walking through 14 different states with 14 different sets of laws regarding firearms.  Instead, I have a set of trekking poles and a niece with a black belt in something and no plans to sleep with my food.  Plus, have you ever *smelled* a hiker?  No one (or bear) will be messing with us.

Here’s what you probably should ask:  What are you going to eat?Um, I have some food issues.  I am allergic to wheat, soy, and peanuts.  No, I am not celiac (although my allergic symptoms do include gastro-intestinal exuberance), and fortunately I have never experienced anaphylaxis.  But, still, what does everyone eat on the trail?  Peanut butter (peanuts), ramen noodles (wheat, soy), Knorr pasta sides (wheat), Knorr rice sides (they have wheat too!), tuna pouches (soy), honey buns (wheat)…you get the idea.  I figure I will be smelling bad enough that I do not need to add gastro-intestinal exuberance to the mix and the chaffing will probably be bad enough that I do not want to deal with that on top of atopic eczema.  So, I am trying to find friendly foods.  Fortunately, there are a number of companies making backpacking meals that are lacking wheat, soy, and peanut ingredients.  If you work for one of these companies, let me know if you are interested in sponsoring my hike with some free food!",,View Entry,"Mar 02, Sat",0
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613269,"Spike, Spike’s Dad, Spike’s Cousin, and I decided to do a shakedown hike for spring break.  At first, we were going to do the Knobstone Trail in Indiana or the Red River Gorge in Kentucky, but the forecasts called for cold, rainy weather.  We looked at doing some part of the AT, but the weather wasn’t much better there.  We ended up at a hotel in Greenville, SC so we could have a base to retreat to if the weather got bad.  On the way there we stopped and explored a little of the AT where it crosses I-40 in Tennessee.We arrived in Greenville on Saturday and drove out to a trail to a huge waterfall the next day.  It was less than 2.5 miles round trip, but there was a lot of elevation (my fitness tracker registered 91 flights for the day).  Spike’s Cousin and I wore our packs even though we knew we were not camping out.Monday night was supposed to be the mildest one of the week, so we decided to do an overnight.  This was actually Spike’s Cousin’s first overnight backpacking trip!  We did a section of the Foothills Trail.  We hiked in about 7 miles and camped at an established campsite that had a lot of trash.  Spike’s Cousin went to bed reasonably early, while Spike, Spike’s Dad, and I stayed up late talking by a fire Dad had started.  By the time we went to bed, I was chilled to the bone.  I put on all the clothes I brought and broke out my emergency blanket, and I still was shivering for quite a while.The next morning, we decided to pack up but leave our packs where we camped and then walk further up the trail and try and find a waterfall that was on the map.  We found the waterfall and learned that we had stayed at a different campsite than we had thought.  We then walked back to the campsite, shouldered our packs and returned the way we had come the day before.  We only saw one other person while we were out there – a man hiking with his dog who asked what time it was and our names.  I figured that he was probably attempting some sort of FKT and needed to document who he encountered.We got back to the car and then drove to the hotel.  We were staying on the second floor, so we had just been taking the stairs, but I walked in and made a beeline for the elevators.  Spike’s Dad made the comment that I probably had 99 flights on my fitness tracker, and I should take the stairs.  “Don’t care,” was my response.  Sure enough, I got to the room and it said 99 flights!That night the hotel fire alarm went off at 11:30 pm.  When we came back in, I took the stairs.  I ended up with 101 flights for the day, a new record.On Wednesday we hung around Greenville, ate good food, and visited a couple of outfitters.  Amazingly I did not feel sore from 3 days of hiking with my pack.  I wonder if my new pack is just that much better at carrying weight than my old one.We left Greenville on Thursday and stopped by the Biltmore on our way back to the Midwest.  While we crossed the AT on I-40 again, we did not stop and say hi this time.  Overall, a good trip where we learned that Spike’s Cousin doesn’t hate backpacking.  Oh, and that the Corn Chowdah from Good To-Go is really good!",,View Entry,"Mar 08, Fri",0
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613494,"I’m typing this on my phone to try a journal entry without a laptop. So far everything has been done with a computer.


Today I shaved off all my hair. I figure it will be easier to take care of (and find ticks in) if it’s short. I also picked up a pack cover. I want a pair of camp shoes but otherwise I think I have all my gear. 


Another thing I did today (besides renew my driver’s license before I got rid of all my hair) was to get a bone density and body composition scan. I’m going to do one when I come back and see what changes.",,View Entry,"May 14, Tue",0

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614285,"On Thursday Spike’s dad and I drove down to Spike’s cousin’s house. We put together our first few resupply boxes and spent one last night with friends and family. We got up early Friday morning and made the drive to Troutdale, VA. We stayed the night at a hostel there so we could leave a resupply box there and arrange for a stay a few days later. 
7 of us drove down to VA: Spike, Spike’s dad, Spike’s cousin (let’s just call her SC from here on), SC’s parents, SC’s boyfriend, and me. It took us about 13 hours to get to Troutdale. We stopped and got Jenni’s ice cream in Columbus, OH and had dinner at a pizza place (I had a salad). It was an uneventful drive, fortunately. We checked into the hostel and did one last pack check, then went to bed. 
At 10:20pm there was knocking on the door. SC’s dad found the hostel owner to figure out what to do. When the owner came out to bring in the newcomer, he found other hostel visitors playing a drinking game and kicked them out. So the end of the day ended up being interesting!
P.S. I’m updating from the trail and the site doesn’t like my pictures. I’ll try to get them added soon but you’ll just have to read and use your imagination for now.",,View Entry,"May 17, Fri",0
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614284,"I was up early at the hostel. I took one last shower and did some work on my computer. We had requested breakfast at 7 but it didn’t materialize until about 8. We got going around 9 and arrived in Damascus about 9:45. The town was hopping with Trail Days. We walked through the booths, got a few free things, and bought a few others. We ended up saying our final good byes about 11:30 and started hiking out of town. It was hot and the hills were so difficult. We were passed by several nobos and saw several sobo-ing into Damascus. We had a great view a few miles in and stopped at a creek to get water and cool our feet. We met several people there and told them we were going to the first shelter.
We were 7.8 miles in when we saw a sign that said 2 miles to the shelter. Unfortunately, those 2 miles were all uphill. It probably took us 2 hours to hike those 2 miles. It seemed like we would never get there. But then, we saw the sign: Shelter 1/4 mi!!  We got to the shelter and the people who we had met at the creek cheered and congratulated us on surviving our first day.
We sat down our packs and picked out a place for the tent when it suddenly started to rain. We did a quick pitch and sat inside eating until the rain subsided. Then it was evening chores. I had cell service so I updated Spike’s dad on where we were. We went to bed about 9pm.","Damascus, VA
",Saunders Shelter (VA),"May 18, Sat",9.80
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614757,"I woke up about 5am but didn’t get moving until 6 when everyone else seemed to be getting up and it was almost light enough to see. SC got up about 7. It took us a little while to get packed up and moving. I sent a happy birthday text to my sister and one last text to Spike’s dad before we left as I figured it was the last time I’d have cell service for a while.  Ended up leaving about 8:30. 
Saunders Shelter is a little ways from the trail and we had taken a short cut to get to the shelter so we set our packs by the trail and went back to hike the 1/2mi we had missed. We then hiked back to our packs and started north for the next shelter. 
Lost Mountain Shelter was only 6mi away so we took our time and got there about 2pm. After yesterday’s hard day, an easy one was in order. We did meet up with our first ridgerunner who warned us about problems people have been having on trail with bears. She said tonight’s shelter hasn’t had problems and the next 2 shelters after that had bear boxes we could use. Later we passed a couple (looked like a father-daughter) who warned us to heed the bear warnings. The trail gossip is that they watched their food get stolen by a bear. I’ve heard several people say, “They hung it wrong then,” but it’s day 2 and I’ve already seen a lot of poor bear bag hangs including my own!
We came to a place where the trail was shared with a bike trail and there was a bench. We sat and had some snacks and then went to a creek that ran nearby to soak our feet. The rest of the hike was uphill but not nearly as difficult as yesterday’s final climb. 
Because we got to the shelter relatively early we decided to stay in the shelter itself. There were already 2 people in a shelter for 6. We cooked dinner around 3 and then had a second dinner at 5:30 because we had not eaten our dinner last night. Mostly we hung around and met a lot of new people. Only one person we had met yesterday and he was just on a section hike to prepare for a thru-hike next year. 
There were a few people who came through and just had dinner and pushed on to the next campsite. Most of the people here came from Damascus this morning and were stopping here because the next shelter is 12mi and a 2,000’ climb away. I think SC went to bed about 8 and I followed about 30min later. I had in earplugs but could still hear people talking out at the picnic table just outside the shelter. I must have drifted off because I was awakened at 9 by someone saying, “You can discuss that tomorrow.” The talkers took that as their sign to go to bed. No sooner than they left, it started raining and would rain off and on the rest of the night.","Saunders Shelter (VA)
",Lost Mountain Shelter (VA),"May 19, Sun",6.50
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614758,"The day started out anything but promising. At 4am 2 people in the shelter got up and started getting ready. At 5am they were still packing up. They had been at the shelter since noon yesterday. I don’t know why they couldn’t have been packed and ready to go the night before.
Anyway, I got up at 5 and went to the privy. We hang our food in trees to keep it away from animals (particularly bear, this known as bear bagging). I couldn’t get it down so I just sat at the picnic table and journaled until more people were up. It ended up taking 3 guys to get our bag down.  SC and I packed up after breakfast and then got on the trail about 7:45am. About 10 minutes later I went to blow my nose and my bandanna wasn’t there. I had left it back at the shelter!  Spike and SC waited with my pack while I walked back to the shelter. When I got there I noticed that I had also managed to leave my camp shoes. So glad I went back but it’s frustrating to have to backtrack. 
It had rained intermittently throughout the night and it was cool, cloudy, and we were occasionally rained on. We came out of the woods and we were treated to a beautiful field with cows. Once we got out of the field we decided that the clouds looked like they wanted to rain on us so we stopped to put raincovers on our packs. We then began a long uphill to Whitetop Mountain. We stopped often to catch our breath and drink water. At one point we stopped for a snack and heard the sound of claws on tree bark. We looked over to see a small black bear (looked too big for a cub but not full grown) ungracefully slide down a tree and then run away. It was only the 3rd day and we saw our first bear!!

That would have made the day but it got even better. As we were climbing up Whitetop, we eventually broke out of the trees for a amazing view. It was one of those climbs where basically every step brings an even more amazing view. We stopped for lunch, enjoyed the view and watched the rain clouds burn away.
Next we entered a beautiful enchanted forest. Seriously it looked like something out of a fairy tale. We thought it couldn’t get better and then we got to Elk Garden. Words can’t describe. The whole way up to Thomas Knob Shelter was one great view after another.
When I arrived at the shelter, I had cell service so I texted Spike’s Dad that he should send a helicopter and pick us up because the day was so beautiful and perfect, there’s no way it could get any better and we should just quit now and go home!","Lost Mountain Shelter (VA)
",Thomas Knob Shelter (VA),"May 20, Mon",12.30
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614759,"We woke up in the morning and the helicopter we had ordered had not materialized, so we put on our packs and started hiking. We stayed in the upstairs of a two floor shelter. Someone had put up their tent in the shelter, which for the record is a trail no-no. That made for an interesting morning, but no matter, it was going to be pony day!
We had seen evidence (aka, poop) of these ponies before we even reached Thomas Knob, and other hikers had stories of being licked. But SC and I? Nada. Not even a passing glance. But someone we shared breakfast with had one chewing on his tent. 
Anyway, we left the shelter and continued to be treated with beautiful views for miles. Finally, we came over a hill and there they were: four beautiful ponies grazing (that’s what they’re there for—to eat the vegetation and help keep the views clear). And we weren’t even in Grayson Highlands State Park, their main hangout.
We finally entered the park. Again, lots of pony evidence, no ponies. A family hiking in the opposite direction of us warned that there was an upset mom with a dead foal ahead. We eventually saw one more pony: it was running around with some purpose in its step but didn’t appear to be a grieving mother. We never saw the foal, but others hiking just in front of us had pictures. Anyway, we ended up having little pony luck. However, Spike had been nervous about the possibility of being licked, so he was happy when we left pony territory without incident. 
Once we left the highlands, we were mostly in woods. Pretty enough but nothing compared to the earlier views. Our destination for the day was Old Orchard Shelter. We ended up tenting and having dinner with some people we’d been hiking with and some sobo section hikers. We did quite a few miles but they were easier miles than yesterday’s. There had been stories about bears in the area so everyone was careful about putting all their food in the provided bear boxes.","Thomas Knob Shelter (VA)
",Old Orchard Shelter (VA),"May 21, Tue",11.90
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614877,"We seemed to have survived the night without a bear visitation. We packed up and hit the trail. Today we would be going to a hostel for the night but first we would need to hike 9+ miles. 
Not long after leaving Old Orchard we hit the tail end of some “trail magic.”  A couple of guys from North Carolina had set up an oasis in the woods with fruit and coffee as well as a few other things. I had a couple of bananas which helped me power up the next hill. We took a break at the Hurricane Shelter and called the hostel to let them know when to pick us up. It then was 5 relatively uneventful miles to Dickey Gap for our pick up.
The exciting part was a bridge that was “out.” We were supposed to take a detour but had been told by sobos that it was fine to cross and the detour involved a hot road walk longer than the missed section. Anyway, SC and I got there not long after Old Dog and Wet Feet, a couple of section hikers we had been keeping pace with. Wet Feet was the biggest, so he went across first. It was kinda sagging in the middle on the upstream side but otherwise seemed fine. We all crossed without incident. However, a mile or so later there was another bridge and this one had loose boards and no railing. Somehow it was perfectly safe to cross?
We got to the gap where Old Dog and Wet Feet decided to press on to the Partnership Shelter. We were picked up by the hostel. We were able to do laundry and take showers. We then went to a Hiker Picnic hosted by a local church. We met a couple of hikers from Indiana. Overall, a productive day.","Old Orchard Shelter (VA)
",Dickey Gap (VA),"May 22, Wed",9.30
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614878,"We had a lazy day planned. Get up at the hostel, have a nice breakfast, go out to the trail, hike the 4 miles to the next shelter, call it a day. It was all going according to plan until we got to that first shelter (Trimpi) and there were people talking about how it was only 10 miles to pizza. Then it was all about getting to the pizza.
We ended up just shy of 14 miles, our longest day yet. Overall it was relatively flat but I did develop 2 new blisters.  We had been dropped off at the trail around 9:15 and got to Partnership Shelter just after 6. 
To explain the pizza thing: Partnership Shelter is close to a state highway and a town. There’s no cell service there but there’s a phone nearby with a pizza menu. You can call and have it delivered. SC had the steak pizza, and I had a pizza salad. I forgot to indicate a preferred dressing, so I just ate it dry, and yet it was one of the best things I had ever eaten. It’s funny how the hiking 14 miles will do that.","Dickey Gap (VA)
",Partnership Shelter (VA),"May 23, Thu",13.90
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614879,"We stayed in the shelter itself last night, but I somehow didn’t wake up until 6am. It was weird to open my eyes and see that it was already light outside. I’m a light sleeper to begin with, but it’s even worse when I go camping. Apparently the answer to getting sleep is that you have to walk at least 14 miles. 
Because yesterday had been such a big day, we decided to take it easy today. We were the last people out of the shelter, and then we went over to a nearby visitor center to check out their exhibits, buy some postcards, and use flushing toilets!
When we did start hiking, our destination for the day was the next shelter: Chatfield. It was only 7 miles away, which seemed appropriate for our 7th day on the trail. Again, a relatively flat day, but my feet were happy to get something of a break. 
We were the first ones who decided to stay at the shelter although we decided to tent. We ended up being joined by 2 people we had met at previous shelters and 2 new people. Of the 6 (non-rhino) people, 4 of us were women. That doesn’t happen often. 
There was a nice creek right in front of the shelter filled with salamanders. We soaked our feet and watched people with trail legs push on. A quiet night to follow a night where there were a ton of people (shelters with pizza delivery tend to be popular) was just what we needed.","Partnership Shelter (VA)
",Chatfield Shelter (VA),"May 24, Fri",7
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614880,"This morning I woke up at 6:30. I have trouble sleeping in that late when I have a bed to sleep in! However, the bags under my eyes were swollen. I’m not sure what that was about. 
Today everyone was excited for trail magic and a restaurant meal. SC and I were again the last ones out of camp (I’m gonna credit sleeping in and having some stove troubles for that). There is an old one room schoolhouse that is basically stocked with hiking essentials: chips, candy, and sodas along with a solid supply of toiletry items only about a mile and a half from the shelter and then a restaurant basically right on the trail another 3 miles later. 
As we were walking up to the schoolhouse, I could hear voices. I figured there was a gathering of hikers enjoying the trail magic. However, as I rounded the corner I saw a bunch of people who looked nothing like hikers. Apparently, the church that provides the chips and candy were here for their annual Memorial Day weekend picnic, and we were invited!
They had all the usual cookout foods: hamburgers, hotdogs, pasta salad, baked beans, and lots of different desserts. It was only 9:30am, but we decided to stay. While we waited for the hamburgers to cook, SC and I decided to check out the museum visitors center. It’s called the Virginia Settlers Museum and they have several buildings (including the schoolhouse) preserved to show what life was like for the early settlers and some exhibits on who the settlers were and what they found when they came to the area. Anyway, it was a nice little diversion from hiking. 
We ate (too much), caught up with hikers we knew, and met some new-to-us hikers. When a hiker we didn’t particularly like showed up, we decided it was time to move on. The rest of the day was hot and we had a lot of open fields to walk through. SC was particularly excited to cross some train tracks. When we arrived in Atkins, we were still full, so decided against stopping at the Barn restaurant, but we did hit up a convenience store for some ice cream.
Our goal for the day was a creek-side campsite between two mountains. That meant a long uphill followed by a long downhill and will necessitate a long uphill first thing tomorrow. We hadn’t seen much water and I was dry by the time we arrived. We didn’t do much looking for a tenting space: just set up camp by the first water we saw. We basically ended up with our tent on the trail itself. We had a doe visit us before bed.","Chatfield Shelter (VA)
",Reed Creek Campsite (VA),"May 25, Sat",11.30
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614927,"Last night it started to rain about 10pm. There were also a couple of owls hooting at each other. Managed to fall asleep but woke up early. 
When I woke up I could still hear raindrops hitting the tent so I was making mental plans about how to pack up everything without getting wet, but when I got up to go to the bathroom, the sky was blue and the sun was shining. 

There were 4 of us at the campsite, and we were the first ones out. The other 2 passed us within an hour. One already had his tent set up when we got to camp last night. I thought maybe he was just one to keep to himself, but when he passed me he proudly announced that he had slept 15 hours.
Everyone had hopes that being a holiday weekend we would see more trail magic today. SC was even told by a sobo that there was at a road crossing. We didn’t find any but there was a pavilion with picnic tables (we didn’t have to sit on the ground!). We had a snack, dried out the tent, and chatted with some other hikers who had stopped there. Today we had more meadows. They are probably some of the most beautiful hiking, but they are also hot with a lot of the sun exposure. Most of them also have cows, which means there are cow patties to avoid. So far none of the cows have expressed any interest in us for which Spike is grateful. 
Because it was a holiday weekend we did see a lot of people just out for the weekend. A section hiker noticed Spike and said, “I like your rhino.” I don’t think the thru hikers notice him because if you’re hiking this trail, you’re already a little weird.
We ended today next to another creek. We had dinner with 2 guys hiking together that we had met at the pavilion and a third guy staying across the creek. One of they guys said something to the effect of, “Are you kidding me? That one bridge was condemned (see 5/22 entry) and this one is held together with duct tape?” It did appear to be supported with duct tape — blaze orange duct tape, to be exact. The creek was one of the larger ones we’ve seen, and SC basically took a bath in it. I just sat on the edge with my feet in the water admiring the crayfish — there were dozens of them!","Reed Creek Campsite (VA)
",Lick Creek Campsite (VA),"May 26, Sun",11.70
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614976,"Last night before bed, SC asked if it was supposed to rain. I said, “No, but it wasn’t supposed to rain last night either.” Well, about 9pm it started pouring. Earlier in the day, we had passed a bridge with a sign next to it to show how far above the bridge any flood waters might be (the creek was lower than the bridge at the time). When I heard the rain, I thought about that sign and hoped the creek we were next to wouldn’t flood. I was lying there thinking about this in my half-asleep state and decided that other people were closer to the creek than we were, so we would probably hear them yelling if the creek reached their tents. Strangely comforted by this, I fell back asleep. 

The rain stopped by morning. No one had been swept away. Because we camped by a creek, it meant we started with an uphill. And this was a big uphill, 2000’ over 5 miles. The original plan was to go to the Davis Farm Campsite, about 13 miles away, but I got to the top of Chestnut Knob (which was absolutely beautiful, by the way) and was feeling pretty good. I told SC that maybe we could push for Jenkins Shelter, an additional 3.5 miles.
We had a nice downhill after Chestnut Knob and took a celebratory trail selfie at our 100 mile point. But then the trail turned evil. We would go up a short, steep hill and right back down, over and over again. In addition to the painful hills, the trail was covered with rocks, so I had to watch each step carefully. It became clear that we wouldn’t be making the shelter. 
The exciting thing about this section is that we ran into a trail maintainer, and he allowed SC to paint a white blaze!
Anyway, we adjusted our plans back to Davis Farm, but then we saw a campsite next to VA 623 and our feet decided they were done for the day. We made camp just a few yards from the road, but the traffic was minimal and consisted mostly of Amish buggies. There was no water around, but the trail maintainer had water in his car and shared with us. 
After getting ready for bed, I looked at my trail information and tried to figure out what to do next. We had planned to go into Bland from US-52, but we were still almost 16 miles away. That would probably take us 2 more days. We had plenty of food, but it had been 5 days since our last shower. I looked and saw another road crossing only 8.9 miles away (we could get a ride from the road we were camping by, but I got car sick just looking at it on the map). That would be our plan, 8.9 miles and then into town for a rest.","Lick Creek Campsite (VA)
",VA 623,"May 27, Mon",11.90
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615100,"VA 623 was quiet over night and it didn’t rain. We did get our first taste of whip-poor-will singing, but it only lasted about 20 minutes. When we started hiking, we faced a few more evil miles of trail before it turned into wonderful trail that was flat and dirt.  We were glad we had stayed at the road when we talked with another hiker who had walked to Davis Farm and found that there was only room for 1 tent and it had already been taken. 
We stopped into Jenkins Shelter for water and lunch. We met a few new hikers there, including one who had just seen her first bear, and by bear, I mean she saw 3 cubs and their momma!
We had requested a shuttle pick up at VA 615 for 3:30. We got there at 3:15 and the shuttle was waiting. Next thing we knew, we were at the motel. The first thing I did was to wash my hands. I cannot tell you how great that felt. 
Next we took showers before heading across the street to DQ.  They were out of a lot of things: lettuce, pecans, cheesecake, napkins. But, they had food, so we ate some dinner with plans of getting Blizzards for dessert. However, before we finished eating they managed to run out of ice cream!  If a DQ has no ice cream, does it cease to be a DQ?","VA 623

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615483,"We ran some errands before taking a shuttle back to where we had left off. We got started a little later than usual, around 10:15am. There was some trail magic going on at the road crossing, but I was still full from breakfast, so we didn’t stay and partake. We did run into a couple of Hoosiers we had previously met at the Troutdale church hiker picnic (5/22). They had left the trail a few days to attend a wedding and had already caught back up to us. 
The trail today was smooth and relatively flat. We made good time to US-52: the place where we originally were going to shuttle into town. There was a place there to get food, but again, I was full from breakfast and our packs were heavy from the resupplying in town. We kept going to the first shelter: Helveys Mill. It was a ways off the trail and we got there just before 4pm. We got water and then set up inside the shelter.

At first we thought we might be the only ones dumb enough to walk this far off trail to stay at a shelter, although eventually it ended up a rather popular place to stay. 
Some people tried to start a fire. It wasn’t going well until someone used their cook stove as a blow torch. 
We’ve met a lot of new people here. Until we get our trail legs, we’re going to be meeting lots of new people. I think we’re just behind the “bubble” even though there are still plenty of people south of us.","VA 615 (Bland, VA)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615485,"There were a lot of people in the shelter area last night, but everything quickly got quiet when the rain started around 9pm. When I got up in the morning, it was cloudy and there was still rain coming down from the trees when the wind blew. However, it was not actively raining.
I counted 13 tents and 1 hammock besides the 4 of us who had stayed in the shelter. We had less than 10 miles to hike, so SC and I were not exactly racing to get out of the shelter, and yet we still managed to be 2 of the first people to leave camp. The others slowly passed us over the next couple of hours. 
Today’s hike was mostly along a heavily forested ridge. We hiked more quickly than usual because of the flat trail and lack of views to stop and appreciate. I was kind of disappointed in this because I could tell that with the rain last night there were some fog and clouds that would have enhanced the views. What we did see was the 600 mile marker for those who had started in Georgia. Also, red efts!  According to the AWOL guide, they are immature red-spotted salamanders. They live on land during the eft stage and are bright orange. They are unbelievably cute and move slowly. We’ve seen a couple in the last few days, but today must have been the right weather for them because I saw 3!
We got to our destination for the day around 2pm and a bunch of the people from the last shelter were there having lunch.  Once they pushed on for their destinations, SC and I moved in to settle into the shelter. After all, I had cell service most of the day as well as last night. I had been watching the weather and knew a storm was about to blow in. There was another hiker who was also planning on staying in the shelter, and we had shared a shelter with him last night as well. He’s a nice young man who that morning had carried up 2(!) gallons of water from the water source at Helveys Mill (a very long and steep hike) for others to use. He’s a thru hiker, but is going slow right now because he’s had some foot pain. Another couple of guys were also in the shelter, but just to wait out the first storm. Once it let up, they started hiking again. 
We had a second storm, and one person stopped at the shelter just to get water. She was planning on going to a hostel at the next road crossing, so she wasn’t worried about going out into the rain. 
After the second storm, the sun came out and it was beautiful. We made dinner and it was starting to get late. We would hear voices on the trail, but they weren’t coming down to the shelter. About 7pm I began to think Spike, SC, the nice guy, and I would be the only ones there for the night. 
It was not to be. Around 7:30, 3 guys and 2 girls showed up. With the exception of one guy who was quiet and set up his tent, the others were loud and started making dinner and drinking. One assured me they were not obnoxious drunks, they were obnoxious without alcohol and they didn’t get any worse with beer. 
I will say they were entertaining!  However, I was tired and ready for bed. Around 9:30, I put in my earplugs, put my sleeping bag over my eyes, and I was out.

P.S. Today a couple of fighter planes flew very low and close to us. Unfortunately, I couldn’t see them because of the tree cover. SC was hiking ahead of me at the time, so when I caught up to her I asked how she liked the fighter planes. “Is that what that was? I thought it might be some sort of weird thunder.” She was hiking at the time with another woman who didn’t know what it was either. Anyway, “Highway to the Danger Zone” was in my head for the rest of the hike.","Helveys Mill Shelter (VA)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615521,"I woke up about 6:15. The nice guy was already out of camp. The loud crowd was asleep until one of their alarms went off at 7am. Apparently they were trying to get out of camp by 8am, but they were still packing up when SC and I left around 8:20. According to SC, they didn’t settle down last night until 10:30. 
Today’s hike was shorter than yesterday’s but had a few good views and involved crossing a suspension bridge. We were aiming for Dismal Falls, and when we got there it was full of people we had met over the last few days including the loud crowd and the 2 Hoosier women. The water was cold, and it felt great to soak my feet. As always, Spike stayed as far away from the water as he could. 
SC and I spent just over an hour there. Everyone else had left by the time we decided to put our shoes on and move a little farther down the trail. We only went about a quarter mile before setting up camp in an “unofficial” campsite. 
We made dinner early and went to bed early hoping to get out of camp early to enjoy as much time at tomorrow’s hostel as possible.","Jenny Knob Shelter (VA)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615906,"As we were getting ready for bed last night, we saw several people walk by. After I had fallen asleep, I woke up to some nearby noises. I listened, hoping it wasn’t a bear going after our food (we didn’t have the best hang this time). Then I heard voices and saw the light of a flashlight. I looked at my phone, it was 10:45!  Pretty late for a night hike. 
When I got up, I was happy to see that our food had not been disturbed by any animals. We ate breakfast and packed up, getting out of camp around 7:35, nearly an hour earlier than usual.

The first 6 miles were relatively flat and easy. We were following Dismal Creek and crossing a bunch of its tributaries. There was a lot of mud and several footbridges. I went slowly through the mud, hoping I wouldn’t lose a shoe to the mire. Still, we made good time to the Wapiti Shelter. When we got there, there were still a couple of hikers packing up. One left soon, the other was still packing when we left.
We were resting up for an upcoming climb. Fortunately, it wasn’t terribly steep and there were great views on top (and cell service)!  We followed a ridge for a while and took a side trail to Sugar Run Mountain. I could look out and see where we would be hiking the next few days. Anyway, it would be mostly downhill to the hostel, and we were making good time. 

That’s when we hit evil trail. There were lots of rocks, all different sizes, and I had to watch my steps carefully. I do notice that I am better at this than I used to be. My ankles seem stronger, and I move a little more quickly, but still, not my favorite. Apparently the state of Pennsylvania almost entirely like this, so I suppose it’s training. On one of the larger rocks, I lost my footing and fell, landing on my pack. First fall of the trip—I’m surprised it took so long.
Anyway, after 2 miles of evil trail, we got to the road that leads to the hostel. SC said her feet were mad at her and didn’t want to go any further. I told her to tell them that we were only a half mile away, and it was on a road, so no more rocks. 
When we got to the hostel, SC was in heaven. First of all, the aesthetic of the place is so much like her house back in Indiana. And it’s a farm with dogs and goats and other animals. One of the hikers also had a dog.  She said, “If I had known about this place, I would have voted to have taken our zero here!”

The first thing we did was to take showers and then put on loaner clothes (cotton!), while they did our laundry. Dinner was Mexican, and I ate a lot, but I have to say I wasn’t full. Maybe my hiker hunger is kicking in?
We went to bed just after 9pm. There were still some lights on in the bunkhouse, but I just put a blanket over my head and fell asleep in a bed with a real mattress and pillow.","Dismal Creekside (VA)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615907,"I slept well last night and then got to get up in the morning and use a flush toilet and wash my hands in running water! Oh the things you appreciate while hiking. 
Breakfast was scrambled eggs with Swiss chard, watermelon, and French toast. I was eating my eggs and watermelon, listening to people talk about how amazing the French toast was and feeling sorry for myself.
Anyway, the hostel owner sat down at our table to eat with us. She looked over at my sad plate of eggs and watermelon and exclaimed, “I almost forgot! We heated up some leftover peach crisp for you!” So, I didn’t get to have creme brûlée French toast, but I did get peach crisp, which only had a few stray peaches in there and was mostly crisp. You know, the way fruit crisp should be. 
Anyway, we did what we could to help out with cleaning up the bunkhouse, went to the bathroom 5 more times, took pictures with Spike’s new friends, and basically did everything to avoid getting back on the trail. However, we needed to pick up a package in Pearisburg. Also, this hostel sucks people in—we met so many people who were just going to stay the night and were there for 3 days. We needed to keep moving. 
We walked up the road to the trail and got started just after 10am. For the first few miles it was back to evil, rocky trail, but it’s much easier to deal with when your feet are fresh.
Today we had a gradual uphill, followed by a few views, and then a really intense downhill headed into town. 
Once we got to the road that would take us into Pearisburg, we knew we were too late to make it to the post office before it closed. We walked the mile into town and stopped at the first place we saw: DQ. They were out of pecans, but at least they still had ice cream!
We were sitting there, eating our Blizzards, and I was contemplating our next move. There was a certain hostel I wanted to stay at, but it was a 2.5mile walk. Did I want to call a shuttle driver? Should we stay at the hostel that offered shuttle services if you stayed there?
SC’s phone rings and she answers it. She’s saying, “I’m at Dairy Queen. Where are you?”  Apparently one of her brother’s friends is a truck driver and had a run in the area (only 4 hours away?!) and decided to stop by and surprise her. We had dinner at a local Mexican place and then he drove us to the hostel! Plus SC got to see a friend from home. 

This hostel was very different than the one we stayed in last night. It is basically self-service. It has a kitchen with the usual stuff (including a lot of food), a flush toilet, a shower, towels, and a washer (dryer is to hang things on the porch). Sleeping quarters consists of a large loft. We set up our bedding in the loft and then both SC and I used the best cell service we had in some time to check in with family.
I was sitting on the porch when a woman and 2 men walk up. The woman is giving the history of the hostel. I ask her if she belongs to the church that runs the hostel and she says that she doesn’t but that she and her husband are local trail volunteers and help out with several of the local hostels. She then gives us her number and says we can call for a ride tomorrow if we need one!

They leave, and a little while later 3 guys carrying Walmart bags and wearing packs appear from the trees. “Do you know where the hostel is?” one of them asks. “This is it,” I tell them. It turns out this is a group of “May flies”: they start in May and “fly” up the trail. These young men had only started 12 days before we did and have managed to do 470 more miles. One of them told me that, “Trail legs are just a mental thing.” I wish the length of my legs was just a “mental thing.” I have to take so many more steps per mile compared to these young guys with their long legs.
As it is currently 9:30, Spike and I will take this opportunity to go to bed. Everyone else is still eating (the guys) or talking to family on the phone (SC).","Sugar Run Gap, VA (Wood’s Hole Hostel)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615908,"I didn’t hear the others go to bed last night. I’m the first one up, and I decide to take advantage of the flush toilet and shower. I then take a walk to one of the greatest supply stores known to hikers: Walmart. It’s just down the hill from the hostel. The walk offers a great view of the hill (mountain?) we climbed down yesterday. 
I get some resupply items and by the time I get back, everyone is up. I make pancakes (some sort of grain-free keto thing?) while SC showers, and then I pack and clean up the hostel while SC makes her own trip to Walmart. 
Finally, at 10:30, we’re ready to leave. We call our trail angel and she drives up as we walk out to the parking lot. She is with her husband and dog, and they let me run into the post office before driving us to the trail. We thank them and try to fit all the stuff we got at Walmart and our resupply box in our packs. We start hiking just after 11am. 
When I looked at the weather forecast a few days ago, today was only supposed to have a high of 66. Instead, it’s in the 80’s. I’m hot, my feet hurt, and my legs don’t want to climb any hills. Also my pack is heavy having just resupplied. 
The beginning of the hike is a lot of up and down with numerous road crossings. After one crossing, we see a local who encourages us to check out an old cemetery just off the trail. There were several benches in this stretch including 2 in the cemetery. I take advantage of every one.

After the last road crossing before the shelter, I tell SC to not wait up for me. I take my sweet time up this hill, taking a leisurely break at a campsite, and then stopping to get water at the last creek before the shelter. When I get there, SC had already been there for 45 minutes and says she was starting to worry. 
This shelter is at the top of a ridge with a beautiful view of the sunset. There’s 7 of us here (8 counting Spike). SC and I are staying in the shelter with another woman, 3 are in hammocks, and there’s one tent. All 8 of us went out on the ridge to watch the sunset. We should be able to see the sunrise in the morning if it’s not raining.","Cross Avenue, Pearisburg, VA

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616181,"There’s a saying on the AT: “No rain, no Maine.” If you’re not willing to walk in the rain, you’ll be unable to complete the trail. Somehow in the last 18 days we’ve managed to avoid hiking in anything more than a brief sprinkle. That’s not to say it hasn’t rained, only that when it has it’s either been at night when we’re sleeping or we’ve been in some sort of enclosure (shelter, hotel, or hostel).
Today we would see if we had what it takes to be true thru hikers. 
I don’t know if it’s a good thing or not to have cell service at a shelter. At any rate, I spent the morning trying to figure out the weather. It had rained overnight, and it was dry but cloudy when I got up. My weather app was predicting thunderstorms at 8:30. Because we were on an exposed ridge, I decided to try to get out and into tree cover as soon as possible. I started hiking at 7:50 with SC leaving a few minutes behind me. Because of the risk for getting wet, Spike was hidden in my pack which I covered with a waterproof pack cover. 
It did sprinkle throughout the morning, but nothing serious and certainly no thunder or lightning. We stopped for a lunch break about halfway between today’s 2 shelters. There the weather app was saying thunderstorms to begin at 12:30. I looked at the radar which showed more rain but nothing that looked like storms.
As we hiked to the shelter, the rain started and it was more serious than the morning’s sprinkles. I was throughly wet by the time I got to the shelter. When I arrived, SC was talking to a couple of guys who had passed us just before the shelter. After a break, they moved on and I entertained Spike and SC with stories of my college spring break backpacking trip to Arizona. 
Later we were joined by 6 other hikers for dinner. 4 moved on hoping to make it to the next shelter and 2 joined us for a night in the shelter. According to Guthook, it’s haunted but I’m not telling anyone else that. 
Anyway, we survived our first hike in the rain while keeping our important gear dry. Our shoes and socks are soaking wet, but that was true before the rain even started: our morning started out with several meadows we had to walk through, and our shoes were no match for the wet grass.
P.S. We started and ended today in VA, but we were on the VA/WV border most of the day, so we were able to be in a new state for a little while.","Rice Field Shelter (VA)
",Pine Swamp Branch Shelter (VA),"Jun 05, Wed",12.60
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616182,"Yesterday it stopped raining a few hours after we got to the shelter. The sun even came out for a little while. Then last night was dry, but I didn’t have cell service, so I packed Spike away and put my pack cover on before heading out for today’s hike.
Oh, before I talk about the hike, let me tell you about my morning. I was the first one up at 5:45 and started my day with a productive trip to the privy (I know, TMI, but this is especially important out here). I then got our food bags (I tried to retrieve our fellow shelter-dwellers’ but their rope was too wet). I had breakfast before proceeding to clean my hands (it’s been awhile since I didn’t have dirt under my nails) and my “foon” (think spork). I then had a second successful privy trip. And all of this was before the other 3 started stirring around 7:30. 
So, on to the hike. The first goal for the day was the next shelter: Bailey Gap. I got there first but only because the other 3 stopped to get water on the way up. There was a warning on Guthook about the rocks following the shelter, but I decided that rather than curse the evil trail and try to get through it quickly, I would approach the rocks mindfully. I chose each step carefully and tried to pay attention to the trees and birds and other things around me. It ended up taking me nearly 2 hours to go 2.5 miles, but I got to the next water source with my feet and sanity intact. I stopped to get water and a sobo couple was there. They warned me about the mud they had just encountered and asked me if there was more. I said, “No, only rocks. Take your time and respect the rocks.”

There was some mud, but my feet welcomed the soft ground. The next destination was Wind Rock. I arrived maybe 20 minutes after the others. They had their socks and shoes laid out in the sun to dry. I did the same despite the dark clouds now obscuring the sun. Then it started to sprinkle and our view from the rock showed more rain coming. I quickly put my shoes and socks back on and started hiking. As it rained, I started singing “The Ants Go Marching” (I think I was only singing in my head, but I can’t be sure). By the time I got to “The ants go marching 10 by 10,” the rain had stopped and the sun was out again.
I hadn’t had cell service all day, and I noticed this one spot on the trail that was a little higher than the rest. When I got there I checked and I had service! I texted Spike’s Dad with an update and one of Spike’s other cousins to wish her a happy birthday. I also looked at the weather. It was looking like rain all day every day for at least the next 5 days. 
After having service, the trail was downhill for the next 2.5 miles. I was passed by 2 other hikers and saw 2 red efts, a brown snake, and a garter snake. SC and I had thought about hiking on to the next campsite so we could make it to our 200-mile point on day 20, but by the time I got there, it was already thundering and there was room in the shelter. We only have 1.3 to go in the morning before we hit that milestone.

The first thing I did when I got to camp was to take off my shoes and go to a nearby creek to get water. I stood in the creek as I filtered my water. It felt amazing.
There are 6 of us in the shelter (7 with Spike, but he doesn’t take up much space) and 1 tenting. We all made dinner out at the picnic table and then it started to rain, so we scrambled to get everything inside the shelter to finish eating in there. It rained off and on (but mostly on) until we all settled in for bed around 9:15.","Pine Swamp Branch Shelter (VA)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616482,"I forgot to take Benadryl before bed last night. I was awake from 12:30-3:15 and then woke up at 5:30. At least I got some work done. I figured out some of our options for the next few days of hiking and put the finishing touches on the last few journal entries. 
It had started raining last night as we were eating dinner and it didn’t let up all night. It was difficult for all of us to pack up and go out into the rain. After 1.3 miles SC and I stopped for our 200mile celebration photo. Spike is in the photo in his raincoat (that is, a ziplock bag).
I had started the hike in my raincoat but quickly was more wet from sweat than rain. I took it off when we stopped for the photo. The next couple of miles were were hiking up to Kelly Knob, but as soon as the trail leveled off I got cold. SC went out to the knob, but I kept going, knowing there wasn’t a view.
We stopped at Laurel Creek Shelter for lunch. It gave us a chance to dry off and warm up. There were four hikers trying to get up the courage to go out in the rain as I arrived. They were trying to psych themselves up to hike 30 miles to get to the next hostel that night. We had a hot lunch and a 200mile celebratory chocolate bar. We also had trouble working up the motivation to go back out in the rain and probably stayed at the shelter for a good 90 minutes. 
Finally we got going. I wore my raincoat and told myself to slow down if I got too warm. I ended up getting soaked, but I stayed warm. 


The rest of today’s hike involved rolling meadows for several miles. I passed by the Keffer Oak, the largest oak tree along the trail. It was huge! It was raining too hard to get a picture, though. Then we started climbing up. Let me tell you, it was the most pleasant climb I’ve experienced thus far. The trail maintainers here had put in steps! I mean, it wasn’t steps all the way up, just when there was a particularly steep or rocky section. It was beautiful. I want to hug whoever did this (after a shower of course).
Then I got to the top of the ridge, it was raining and foggy, and there were these huge rock piles. It was kinda creepy in the fog. The shelter we were aiming for was .4 miles off trail. However, the trail down was beautifully maintained as well.
Today I hiked 12.6 miles in the rain and my feet didn’t hurt. Maybe if we had gotten going earlier in the morning and hadn’t stopped so long for lunch, we could have made it to the next shelter. However, this shelter seems like a good one as it has a huge covered deck in front to hopefully keep things a little drier. 
There is one other hiker staying with us at this shelter. It feels like we are the only people left in the world.","War Spur Shelter (VA)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616483,"When I woke up it was still raining. I went to the privy (where there was also cell service) and the weather app said there was supposed to be rain all day today, tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow. 
I went back to the shelter and told myself I could do it. We only needed to hike 6 miles today to the next shelter, 10 tomorrow, and then on Monday we would be picked up by some friends and get off trail to dry out.
I sat down to heat up water for oatmeal. I could get the stove started but couldn’t get a consistent burn. Then it would just go out without warning before the water was hot. I tried everything I could think of, but one of the things I need to figure out my stove is to listen to it. Because of the constant rain, I couldn’t hear what was going on. 
I finally got enough water hot enough to make some oatmeal. By this time the other two were up. It took some time before our shelter-mate was packed and ready to get on trail. His plan was to hike to a road crossing 15+ miles north and see if a hostel would pick him up. 
I was still trying to figure out our next move. SC is pretty much up for whatever, so I often find myself in the position of being the decision-maker. We only had 6 miles to hike (6.4 if you count the hike back to the trail), and it looked like there might be a window in the afternoon of less rain, so I had some time to think.

The pros of moving forward: more miles under our belt.
Cons of moving forward: stove not working, SC’s pack cover was not keeping her pack dry, my feet were in bad shape from being wet, I was having trouble keeping my sleeping bag dry, everything we owned smelled like wet dog, and the thought of spending 2+ more days in the rain made me want to cry. 
I didn’t think we could make 15 miles to get picked up by the hostel, and I figured with all the rain, the hostel was probably already full. There was nowhere else to stay in the next town. Looking at Guthook and seeing the comments, I decided to try and see if we could get a ride from one of yesterday’s road crossings into Blacksburg. I went to the privy and texted a number I found in Guthook. Next thing I know, we have a ride set up!
I go back to the shelter, and SC and I start packing. Two others have just arrived at the shelter for the night. We bid them farewell, and went back to the trail.
It felt like a sort of defeat to be walking the wrong way. The good news is that I was able to appreciate those beautiful steps going down this time. SC had missed the Keffer Oak yesterday and was able to see it today. We bumped into several hikers who we thought were ahead of us. It made us feel a little better about getting off trail in the rain. Also, this is the first real test of our gear — the others have had months to dial things in. 
We made it to the road, our trail angel picked us up and drove us to Blacksburg, she refused to accept any compensation, and we got checked into a motel that is across the street from an outfitter. After taking a shower, I walked to a drug store to get something for my feet. We also got pizza, and it was from a place where I could get a gluten free one rather than just having a salad! This is much better than eating a tepid dehydrated meal before crawling into a damp sleeping bag.","Sarver Hollow Shelter (VA)

Early in the day I heard from our friends who were going to pick us up on Monday. They had decided to return today and would be at the hotel about 5pm. I figured I might as well run some errands. First I got the stove up and running (no idea why it wasn’t working yesterday). Kroger was a .4mi walk from the hotel, so I headed that direction. Before I got there, a restaurant serving brunch and beer appeared. I went in and had something to eat. You know what they say, you’re not supposed to go grocery shopping on an empty stomach.
After eating, I picked up some resupply food and then went back to the hotel. SC was up by this time, so the 2 of us crossed the street to check out an outfitters. We didn’t end up getting anything, but it was good to look.

That means that while we only completed 7.5 miles of the trail today, we actually hiked 15 miles. 
Let me just say, I’m glad we got off the trail when we did. Sure it was “only” 6 miles from Sarver Hollow to Niday, but those 6 miles included long stretches of rock slabs tilted at precarious angles. I can’t imagine how difficult that would have been in the rain. Also, because the mountains were no longer shrouded in clouds, we had beautiful views.
Today was also a big wildlife day. I saw 5 deer, 3 lizards, 2 snakes, and a salamander. 
It was a long day. I ate dinner by headlamp. We didn’t get to bed until almost 10.","Sarver Hollow Shelter/Farmville, VA

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616557,"It was cold last night, so I was able to sleep well. We only were going 8.6 miles today, so I let SC sleep in. We got up and going just before 10. We started with a climb that offered great cell service.  About 3 miles in, there was a bench. My rule is that if there’s a bench or chair in the woods, it must be sat in and appreciated. So, I sat on that bench for a few minutes. About a quarter mile later, another bench!
SC and I met for lunch at the Audie Murphy Monument. It’s one of those things that I’ve seen so many pictures of from other hikers, but seeing it in person, it was bigger than what I was expecting. And guess what the monument had: 2 benches! There was a sign that said, “Overlook,” just past the monument. I took the path down to check it out and guess what I found. You’re right, another bench. That’s 5 benches in one day!
After the monument, the trail went mostly downhill. When we get to the bottom there’s a road and a trash can (it’s always good to have a chance to throw away trash rather than carry it).  We cross the road and then a bridge. And what do I spy? A chair down by the creek we are crossing. I stopped and sat in it for a few minutes as well. 
Another highlight of the day was that I had my first blueberries on the trail. 
Anyway, we finally get to our goal shelter for the day: Pickle Branch. There’s already a hiker there, a guy doing a long section hike with a friend who is about to finish his last section of the trail. The friend arrives later. It ends up being just the 4 of us in the shelter. 7 if you also count Spike, Arthur, and Tanner. SC was the only one without a trail mascot. It rained a little before bed. Pretty much everyone was in bed by 7pm.","VA 621/Craig Creekside
",Pickle Branch Shelter (VA),"Jun 12, Wed",8.60
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616631,"I was the first one up this morning and the first one on the trail. It had rained overnight, so I was the person who had to walk through the underbrush and shake off all the water from the leaves as well as clear the trail of spiderwebs. Fortunately, SC passed me in about an hour to take over those duties. 
We started off hiking uphill toward Dragons Tooth. It was a long climb that got rockier as we went. There were some great views at the Tooth itself. It’s one of those places where I’ve seen so many pictures, but there’s never anything for scale. It’s a lot bigger than I had imagined. SC said she got close to climbing to the top but didn’t make it all the way. Spike and I kept mainly to the ground around the Tooth (the gums?).
I left before SC, and the trail was downhill from the Tooth. And when I say downhill, I mean it was like rock climbing but in reverse. So far I hadn’t seen any other hikers since the shelter, and the gentlemen we had stayed with last night were headed sobo. Once I left the Tooth, I started seeing day hikers headed up.  Then, once I passed the turnoff to the Dragons Tooth parking lot, it was a quiet trail again. SC didn’t catch up with me for another 2.3 miles. Oh, I should also mention that this was the section where my left knee decided that it was no longer talking to me, but like an easily distracted toddler, it forgot why it was mad as soon as the trail leveled off. 
The next stretch of trail was long and devoid of body parts of mythical creatures. There were some pretty fields and a couple of thru-hikers passed me easily on a hill. I didn’t really stop until I reached VA 311. SC was there. I hadn’t seen her in 6 miles. There was also a guy there offering cold drinks to thru hikers and asking for their pictures. I agreed, but also asked for a ride to a trail-famous restaurant, just 1.4 miles away. He was nice enough to oblige us and next thing we know, we’re getting dinner at The Homeplace. SC and I ate so much! And the food was so much better than a dehydrated meal. (Spike’s Dad also said it was cheaper, but that’s per meal, and right now SC and I are still splitting dinners.)
Our next challenge was to get back to the trail. It was the first time we tried hitch-hiking. We started in the restaurant’s driveway, but it wasn’t until we got to the road that someone pulled over and gave us a ride. His trail name is Kringle, and he is a local trail supporter (he even had an AT license plate). He was actually on his way to meet a friend to do an evening hike and drove a couple miles out of his way to get us back to the trailhead!
We had one more mile to get to the next shelter. It was mostly uphill and it was difficult hiking on a full stomach. Just before I reached the shelter, it started to rain. I started running and managed to get to the shelter before Spike or I got very wet. It didn’t rain long, just enough to convince us to stay at this shelter and not hike one more mile to the next one. Guthook says that the shelter fills up fast, but Spike, SC, and I have it all to ourselves.","Pickle Branch Shelter (VA)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616632,"It seems that almost every trail journal I’ve read, there’s this one day that the hiker gets to the shelter they were aiming for that day at noon and they decide that maybe they should just keep going. I am beginning to think that day will not come for me. Granted, yesterday was a big day. Not only was it one of the longest days we’ve had so far, my phone says I climbed the equivalent of 182 floors. This is the most we’ve done in one day since 5/20 when we did 161 floors (my average in April before I started hiking was 16 floors per day). 
Anyway, we had a big day yesterday, and I was up at 6:30am, but we didn’t start hiking until 9:30. By that time the trail was beginning to fill with day hikers on their way to McAfee Knob.
In fact, some people were already on their way back down. SC said she was awakened at 3:30am by some hikers probably trying to get there to watch the sunrise. One family stepped aside to let me pass. I thanked them, and someone said, “Well, we don’t want to break your stride.” Great, now guess what song was in my head the rest of the day. The good news is that I actually passed some hikers today. Of course they were day hikers who looked (and smelled) like they were not accustomed to this whole hiking thing, but still it was nice to be the one passing for a change. 
I actually passed the turn-off to McAfee Knob. I showed up at this overlook and a trail maintainer I talked to earlier said, “Have you already been to the Knob?” Um, apparently not? I walked back and found SC already there. We hung out and took lots of pictures. Several people were up there with their dogs which made SC’s day. 
However, we were now only 2.7 miles into our 9.4-mile plan and it was already 12:30. We eventually got back on the trail and headed to today’s other big attraction: Tinker Cliffs. But first we would have to do 3 big climbs. They were not real long climbs, but I had gotten accustomed to having switchbacks or steps (or both!) for steep climbs. This is where I most distinctly experienced my lack of trail legs. I feel like the steps I’m taking are so small that I’m practically going backwards.
Anyway, after climbing what seemed to be forever, we finally reached the cliffs. Apparently from here you can see Dragons Tooth and McAfee Knob. I couldn’t make out those landmarks, but the view was incredible. We sat in the sun and got a little sunburned. I finally decided to keep going to the shelter and SC followed a little later. It was 1.6 miles all downhill, and fortunately for my knees, there were switchbacks for this section. 
We had stayed in a shelter by ourselves last night, and had met up with a couple of thru hikers who were heading into the next town tonight, so we weren’t sure if there would be anyone at Lamberts Meadow. However, there was a guy sleeping in the shelter when we arrived, and we met a couple more while getting water. As we got settled in, several more people arrived. There’s a nice mix of thru and section hikers. Apparently there’s something called the Triple Crown Loop (Dragons Tooth, McAfee Knob, and Tinker Cliffs make up the Virginia Triple Crown) that a number of them are doing. 
When the sleeping guy wakes up we do some talking. He started in early March but just got back on after taking a month off (I don’t remember the reason). I bemoan my lack of trail legs. He tells me he didn’t get his until day 40. That gives me some hope as this is day 28 for me. 
Anyway, I decided to get ready for bed. I try to be somewhat discrete when changing into my sleeping clothes, so I decided to find a place away from the shelter where I can pee and change into the pants I sleep in. As I am walking away from the shelter and toward the trail, I hear something in a tree above me. At first I think it’s a squirrel, but then I look more closely and it’s too big and black to be a squirrel. I run back to the shelter and tell SC and the guy who had been sleeping that there’s a bear!  They both run out to see and they confirm, yes, that’s a bear. We watch for a while and figure out it’s actually 2 bears!  We stand out there watching the tree for probably a good 20 minutes until it gets to dark to see anything. Now we’re back at the shelter. The sleeping guy took a hit of weed and is now asleep. SC and I are on our phones. I hope I can get some sleep.","Johns Spring Shelter (VA)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617181,"I didn’t sleep well at all last night. Every twig snapping was sure to be a bear about to attack us. When I put away my phone last night, I noticed our shelter-mate was actually still awake, watching videos on his phone. His plan was to get up early and get into town early, but when I woke up around 5:45, he was still sleeping. There was a guy who tented nearby, and he also said he was going to get up super early (3 or 4am) and get in town for breakfast. However, he was hovering around the shelter. About 6am I decided to get up and visit the privy. I’m getting my stuff when I hear a loud pop. The tenter and I turn the corner around the side of the shelter and come face to face with a bear!
Suddenly SC and our shelter-mate were up and rushing over for a look. It wasn’t particularly big, and it didn’t seem worried about four hikers staring at it. We yelled and it got further away but it didn’t leave the area. We noticed that the shelter was surrounded by cherry trees and the bear seemed particularly interested in the cherries. I went to the privy and when I got back, the bear was in a tree.

The tenter and our shelter-mate eventually packed up and headed to town. SC and I had trouble concentrating on our morning chores because we kept watching the bear. A couple of others who tented nearby came up to get their food from the bear box, and we told them about the bear. Then someone noticed something else in another tree. It was a cub! No wonder the bear was not running away, she was staying near her cubs (eventually we saw a second cub).
Now that we knew we were dealing with a mama bear and cubs, we had a little more motivation to get moving. We had 9.4 miles to get to town where Spike’s Dad and grandparents would be meeting us and taking us off trail for a couple of days. 
Today’s trail looked to be mostly downhill with a rather calm elevation profile and lots of views. There was a place called Hay Rock. SC climbed up for the view but Spike and I kept going. At the rock, there were a couple of new parents with a baby (he looked to be maybe 9 months old) out for his first hike. I thought that was pretty cool, but as I hiked, I had even more appreciation for what the parents had done. There were several rock scrambles I encountered, and it would have been difficult to do with a baby carrier. 
As we walked, we encountered more and more day hikers. Some of them were wearing running shoes and just carrying a small bottle of water. I wanted to tell them, “This hill is kicking my butt and I’m hiking *down*.” We saw a guy who asked us how it was. It was about noon. I asked him where he was going and he answered Tinker Cliffs. We were there yesterday. He was proposing a 20-mile round trip and he was just now starting. We tried to tell him he probably wouldn’t make it. He didn’t seem to take us seriously. I saw a father looking at a map, telling his children, “This will be easy.” I wanted to tell them that their father has no idea what he’s talking about. 
We finally make it to US 220, just south of Daleville. The plan is to hike .3 miles to get lunch and then see where the people who are picking us up are. When we get done eating, our ride is stuck in traffic. We are uncomfortably full and it is super hot, but we decide to keep hiking.
We get back on the trail, and fortunately the next couple of miles are a walk in the park, literally. Before we know it, we are at Mountain Pass Road, the last road crossing in the area, 30 minutes before our ride. When they show up, we jump in the car and head back to Farmville.
We check into a hotel, get showers, change into the non-hiking clothes they brought (yay, cotton!), and then get dinner on a rooftop. How quickly things change.","Lamberts Meadow Shelter (VA)

When we got to the store, the shoes were too narrow. Apparently I’m a men’s size 8EE in this particular brand. Ugh, why is finding shoes so hard? I did buy new socks, though. 
Before going back on the trail, we got lunch. Then it was time to say good bye to Spike’s Dad and grandparents. SC and I started up the first hill and it was was like hiking through molasses. We had gotten accustomed to air conditioning and now it was really hot. We got to the first shelter and had a snack. It started to thunder before we left. 
After about an hour, it started to rain, but it never rained very hard and there was no thunder or lightning. I walked 2.5 hours in the rain to get to the next shelter, only to find that the shelter was full and there were about 5 tents set up. We also set up our tent, but by this time it had fortunately stopped raining.","Mountain Pass Road, Troutville, VA/Farmville, VA

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617558,"I was one of the first people up this morning, so I got down our bear bags and then filtered water. I made my breakfast and then took down the tent while SC ate. I was able to get going before SC, which is nice because her longer and younger legs are faster than mine. 
However, it took her longer than usual to catch up with me today because she was still feeling sluggish after our time off trail. It didn’t help that it was pretty warm out.
Anyway, today I felt like I was keeping up and actually passing some people. I found out later that the people I was passing were either section hikers or had just returned to the trail after being off for 6 weeks due to injury, but I’ll take what I can get. 
Today we also Blue Ridge Parkway day. We were paralleling the Parkway all day and crossed it several times. This means there were trash cans, so we could unload some weight and smelly trash. 
Oh, speaking of smelly, at our last resupply, I had found gluten free cheese crackers. There was a clean ziplock bag in the hotel room, so I had taken the crackers out of their metallic bag and put it in the resealable plastic one. Today when I went to have some crackers, they tasted kinda funny and they smelled like perfume. At one of our breaks I had SC smell them and she recognized the smell. When Spike’s Dad came to visit, he picked up some things from her house. Her mom had put together a bag of her things and had included letters from friends and family. SC’s boyfriend had written a letter, sprayed it with cologne, and sealed it in a ziplock bag. This baggie had ended up in our available bags pile, and it looked like it had never been used. I hadn’t thought to smell it first. And if you’re wondering, I ate the crackers—I was that hungry. I did transfer them to another baggie as soon as one was available. 
So today’s hike was pretty mild. There were a lot of rolling hills as we were on a ridge all day. Because of the Blue Ridge Parkway, there were several areas with great views. It started raining about an hour before I got to the shelter. It was more serious than yesterday’s rain, and my top half was soaked when I got to the shelter, but my feet were relatively dry, so that was good.
Here at the shelter there are a couple of other thru-hikers, including one going sobo. There’s also a father-son team doing a long section hike who are sharing the shelter. Dad doesn’t know how to turn the sound off on his phone or that he doesn’t need to use a headlamp while using his phone. They are carrying 90 liter packs. They are great people, like most I’ve met out here, but I’m not sure that son is enjoying himself. I’m hoping they drop some of their excess stuff and dial back their attempted miles.","Wilson Creek Shelter (VA)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617559,"There’s a tree shirt I saw a few years ago in Gatlinburg, TN that said something along the lines of, “You don’t have to run faster than the bear, just faster than one of your friends.” I’m thinking about this tonight because SC threw a beautiful bear line tonight. It was so pretty, I took a picture of it. However, because we are staying at a shelter with a bunch of people, one of whom has their food bag basically within easy reach of a bear, we didn’t need such a perfect hang. If a bear comes, our food is safe because the bear is going to go for that bag first.
Anyway, how did we get here? Today was a tough day. It started off easy enough with a 3.2-mile downhill to a creek. SC and I took off our shoes and waded. Comments in Guthook suggested that we would see snakes there, but we didn’t see any. 
Next we had another 3.6 miles up and over a hill to a shelter. On our way down, we passed a man who warned us of a copperhead near the trail. Disappointingly I didn’t see any snakes on the way to the shelter. 
We stopped at the shelter to have lunch and get water. It was a beautiful shelter, but we needed to get more miles in to make it to our next pick up point on Saturday.
We now only had 5.1 miles to our destination for the day, but it involved a 2,500 foot climb up a mountain that had no views. I set out slowly and listening to podcasts. I let myself stop and get a drink of water and check my progress about every 45 minutes. It seemed like it took forever, but finally I heard voices. The shelter was near. 
I walked up and was greeted with, “Sunshine!”
“I’m not Sunshine.”
“You look just like her. We just saw her a couple of days ago. So who are you?”
“I’m Spike’s Mom.”
“Spike’s Mom! We’ve been reading your entries in the shelter registers.” I often use my own pen in the resisters, so my entries stand out and I get this a lot. 
Anyway, SC and I were surprised to find the shelter was full and there were several tents already up. Where did these people come from? Apparently most of them had spent the night last night at a campground off trail and had been dropped off at a road crossing just before we got there. We had been hiking all day without seeing anyone and suddenly we’re surrounded.

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617560,"So, first of all, I woke up this morning worried that I had jinxed us by writing that stuff last night about the bear bags. Fortunately, everyone’s food was hanging as it was last night. 
Today was the first day of summer, which means #HikeNakedDay. For a while SC was asking if we had to hike today, but it ended up being cold and windy, so while we saw a few people in underwear, for the most part people were fully clothed. 

This morning while people were getting packed up, a guy walks into camp wearing only his pack, shoes, socks, and black briefs. He had stopped to use the privy. One of the section hikers looked at him for a minute with confusion. Then he slapped his forehead and said, “Oh, right, it’s hike naked day. Dude, you know that’s only for girls, right?” The guy just shrugged and went on with what he was doing. I think it’s funny that the section hiker thought he would be able to see naked girls all day and no naked guys. SC and I were fully clothed all day but Spike was naked. But then again, he’s naked every day.
Today’s terrain looked mild compared to yesterday’s, and we were only going .6 miles further, so we kind of lollygaged all day. We met up at Black Rock Overlook, then at Parkers Gap Road. A mile past Parkers Gap, we hit 300 miles, so we took a selfie at the spot. Next was Apple Orchard Mountain which had a FAA tower on top and a building where we were able to do some charging of our electronics.
1.2 miles later there was a shelter, so we stopped there to sign the register. Then there was the Thunder Ridge Overlook which was right by a Blue Ridge Parkway parking lot where there was a trash can. Next thing we know, it’s 3pm and we still have 5.7 miles to do. We finally get to our campsite and there’s probably 5 tents set up. Most people are down on a lovely flat, grassy space that’s surrounded by dead trees. We set up our tent up the hill a ways. It’s rocky but at least there’s no widow makers.","Cornelius Creek Shelter (VA)

I got up and went about my morning chores while someone with an annoying alarm pressed snooze over and over. We were a little slow getting ready because because we had trouble getting the stove started. Poor SC had to eat cold oatmeal. 
We only had 7.7 miles before reaching US 501 where we would be meeting up with some friends who would take us off trail for the night. We met up at an intersection with another trail (last spot with reliable cell service), then at Matts Creek Shelter (to chat with other hikers and read/sign the shelter register), before reaching the main event: the James River Foot Bridge (it’s both a footbridge—the longest on the AT—and named in memory of a guy named Foot). SC loved the bridge and asked if we could come back tomorrow and just hang out at the bridge. 
However, our friends were there to pick us up and showers were calling our names. Our first stop was actually an urgent care clinic. I’ve developed a burning rash on my calves over the last couple of days. After a quick chat with a PA, I was on my way with an antibiotic prescription. Then we got lupper (lunch? supper?) and picked up a few things at Target.

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617568,"This morning we had breakfast, and then I got my hair cut for the first time since starting the trail. The friends we were staying with had clippers, and my hair was beginning to get long enough that it was getting hot and annoying. It’s not as short as last time (1/8” vs. 1/16”) because they didn’t have the shorter guard and I wasn’t willing to go completely bald.
We then packed up our packs and there wasn’t anything else to do, so we went back to the trail, stopping for a minor resupply on the way. We had left a cache of food and a few other resupply items at their house earlier, so there wasn’t much more we needed. 
We were back on the trail within 24 hours of leaving and in that time we showered, did laundry, got ice cream, slept in a real bed, spent time with good people, and resupplied, plus I got medical care and a haircut! That’s a productive 24 hours. 

The hiking plan for today was to go to the first shelter. It was only 1.7 miles from the road but the next shelter was another 8.8 miles and 3,000+ feet of elevation away. There didn’t appear to be any good places to camp in between, so it seemed like our best option was just to stay here.
When we first got to the shelter there was one nobo thru-hiker and a couple of hikers sobo-ing who appeared to be section hikers. All 3 moved on. A little later 2 nobo thru-hikers came through. They also pushed on to the next shelter. 
We were beginning to think it was just going to be us for the night when a tramily (trail family—a group of people who hike together) came in and set up tents. There are 5 of them and apparently another stopped off in Glasgow. We went to bed while they were still eating dinner. 
It was a good, restful day even with everything we got accomplished. I’m not looking forward to the climbs and weird spacing on shelters over the next few days.","US 501/Farmville, VA

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617569,"I didn’t sleep well last night. There were bugs in the shelter and it was hot. If I was under my sleeping bag, I was hot. If I exposed any flesh, I was bit. I also had weird dreams that there was something in the woods or someone was coming into the shelter in the middle of the night. 
Finally it was late enough to get up and ready for the day. SC and I packed up and were out of camp before several of the tramily were even awake. The first thing we had to do was climb Bluff Mountain. It wasn’t that steep of a climb but it seemed to go on forever. We were passed by a few people who appeared to be thru-hikers, but not the people who we stayed with last night.

The climb was also very hot. There were cicadas doing their cicada noise thing, which makes it even sound hot. When I finally reached the top, I admired the view briefly. Most of the views we’ve had so far have been either clear or cloudy. This was the first one that was hazy from the heat and humidity.
At the top of Bluff, the Guthook comments said a copperhead lived there. I looked around but didn’t see anything, and it was so oppressively hot, that I kept going north to look for a place in the shade to take a break. SC stayed near the peak. 
After spending some time in the shade getting some water, I continued on to the next shelter: Punchbowl. A few people I had met that day were there. Two had stories and even a video of a rattlesnake they saw just past Bluff. A little while later another hiker came to the shelter saying she had seen 2 rattlesnakes and had been charged by a buck. Nothing nearly that exciting had happened to me. 
Punchbowl Shelter had been our goal for the day and both of my guides didn’t list any camping opportunities until the next shelter, 9.5 miles away. But it was only 3:30 and I would need to do 15 miles the next day if I stayed at the shelter. However, a couple of people had put comments in Guthook about a stealth site around mile marker 800.3, about 3 miles away. SC finally arrived at the shelter about 4:30. I told her my plan and she was willing, so we started toward this campsite. It really was hidden and it took some searching to find it, but it’s a good spot.

Today was another day of climbing. I had heard that Virginia was supposed to be flat. It’s a lie! Fortunately the storm had made things a little cooler. 
Anyway, today we were to climb Bald Knob, but first we went downhill and then flat before doing the climb basically at the end of the day. We were headed to either Cow Camp Gap or Hog Camp Gap. I don’t know where these names come from, but we didn’t see any farm animals. 
I had been hoping that we could make it to the farther Hog Camp Gap, but by the time I made it to the top of Bald Knob, my feet were begging for mercy. We settled on Cow Camp Gap where there was a shelter and water even though it was a half mile off trail. I am so glad we did those additional 3 miles yesterday. 
On our way down to the shelter, a couple of section hikers passed me (because I’m still so slow section hikers pass me!). We talked with them once we all got to the shelter, and one had been a thru-hiker in 2014.

They opted to stay in the shelter but given the bugs we endured the night before last and the fact that the mice were so loud here we can hear them squeaking, we’ll be in our tent, thank you very much.
In fact, SC and I just got settled in and there is a late arrival to the shelter. It’s a thru-hiker we’ve met before and we’ll catch up with him tomorrow.","Stealth Campsite MM800.3 (VA)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617691,"I was the first person up this morning. When I fell asleep last night, I was under the impression that the late-comer had stayed in the shelter but apparently he had set up a tent. Later I learned that he had been bothered by the mice while eating dinner, so he opted for the tent. This was actually a hiker we had met back on 6/18.  He had gotten off trail at Glasgow and spent 3 days there getting drunk which was the reason he was now behind us.


The section hikers woke up shortly after I did and were on the trail before the thru-hiker woke up. Even though he woke up last, he managed to get on the trail before SC and I. Even though it takes us a while to get ready, I’ve never gotten to the end of the day and thought, “If I had left sooner this morning, I would have gone farther.”
That applies to today. We “only” did 11.3 miles of the AT (there was additional .5 to get from last night’s shelter back to the trail to make it 11.8) which were relatively flat, and when I got to tonight’s campsite, my feet were so glad to be done. Our longest day still is Day 6 when we did 13.9 to get to Partnership Shelter and pizza. I will get new shoes soon and that should help, but I’m still holding out hope that one of these days I will start moving faster and doing bigger miles.
Today we were passed by the guy at the shelter as he left before us. We then climbed Cole Mountain (which is beautiful, by the way) and were passed by someone slackpacking. We stopped late in the day at a river to get water and were talking about how we hadn’t seen anyone else hiking nobo all day when a thru-hiker came by and passed us. He said there were a few more behind him. A few minutes later, a woman passes me and I asked, “Didn’t you pass me yesterday? I figured you were long ahead of me.” She said that she stops “in all the towns,” so she had gotten off to visit Buena Vista yesterday.
Not long after seeing her, we got to a shelter where we signed the register and were passed by yet another hiker. The shelter had cell service, so we talked with SC’s family about meeting up with them tomorrow. I’m not sure what our service will look like tomorrow. According to Guthook comments, the next shelter doesn’t have cell service and the campsite we are staying at tonight doesn’t either.
Anyway, we did 1.1 more miles after the shelter to get to this campsite which is called Porters Gap in Guthook and Rock Spring in the AWOL guide. There’s a sign on the trail with both names. Not long after we get here, another female hiker shows up. I talk with her and she’s using the ATC’s thru-hikers’ companion which calls this place Porters Field and she is confused by the lack of resemblance to a field this place has. Spike’s Dad had commented that he had hoped Porters Gap had more porters than Cow Camp Gap had cows; and it didn’t matter what type of porters they were: dark beers or people that help carry your stuff. So far I have encountered neither. 
Anyway, I talked with the hiker and introduced myself as “Spike’s Mom,” and her response was, “What kind of name is that?” to which I replied, “A trail name.” She appears to be a thru-hiker so I am surprised she isn’t familiar with trail names. I wondered if she had been hiking for 800+ miles without talking to other hikers. However, an older gentleman came in as SC and I were finishing dinner, and they are talking as if they’ve been hiking together, so I don’t know what to think.","Cow Camp Gap Shelter (VA)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617795,"I woke up first in our camping area, and was second out. The woman I met last night got out first, and then I was confused when she passed me later in the day. Apparently there is a very steep gravel road that goes to a town. It’s 2 miles round trip, and she had gone down to get beer to drink at an upcoming river.
Our first stop of the day was Spy Rock. It was a bit of a rock scramble to get to the top, but a 360degree view once we were up there. We didn’t stay long because it was already hot. 
We next headed to the Priest Shelter. It’s near the summit of The Priest (I think it’s a mountain but everyone just refers to it as “The Priest”). The shelter log there is probably the best on trail because hikers use it to confess their trail sins. It makes for an entertaining read. On the way up I was passed by 2 hikers, one we last saw on 5/23!

Then it was a long walk down The Priest to VA Route 56. My feet and knees were complaining by the end. It had been so hot, and then it started to thunder. And not a little thunder but almost constant rumbling. I didn’t see any lightning, and we must have been on the edge of the storm because we got some sprinkles but no real rain. I put Spike away in my pack and put the pack cover on just in case.
When we finally got down to the road, SC’s parents (Spike’s Aunt and Uncle) were there to take us off trail for the night. They brought SC’s boyfriend and one of her nieces (Spike’s Second Cousin?) with them. They have rented an Airbnb for the next few days so we can see them and do some slackpacking. We went to the condo, took showers, and then had burgers for dinner. I’m now in my cotton jammies ready to sleep in a real bed.","Porters Gap, Rock Spring Campsite (VA)
","VA Route 56/Wintergreen, VA","Jun 27, Thu",10.30
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617799,"This morning I woke up and realized that I didn’t wake up last night with my arms asleep. I do this regularly out on the trail because of the way my sleeping pad works. And it seems like it usually happens now when I’m in a real bed too, but maybe I’ve turned some sort of corner.

After breakfast of yogurt, granola, and fresh fruit (the granola is the only thing I could carry on the trail and yet I usually don’t); SC, SC’s boyfriend, and SC’s niece and I were shuttled back to where we were picked up yesterday.
Today’s hike would involve some climbing. We stopped by the Harpers Creek Shelter to rest and check in before tackling Chimney Rock. Then we climbed even higher to the top of Three Ridges. On the way down from Three Ridges we stopped to appreciate the view from Hanging Rock Overlook. SC and her boyfriend got close to the edge while Spike, SC’s niece, and I all kept a safe distance.
After going down for a ways it was time to go back up to the summit of Bee Mountain. Then it was down again to Maupin Shelter. SC and the other two youngins got there first and caught up with a few thru-hikers we had met previously. I didn’t see any thru-hikers. 
Anyway, we got water at the shelter and signed the log. I decided to go ahead and make my way to our pick up spot, 1.7 miles down the trail. The others hung out at the shelter a little longer. I was just under a mile to the car when a storm seemed to come out of nowhere. I hoped the others were not far behind me and kept walking. Eventually it poured. I’m talking about the kind of wet you get when a bucket gets dumped on your head. There was thunder, lightning, and it even started to hail. I stopped when I noticed the hail and just stood there in the rain with my hands covering my head to try to provide some protection. The hail wasn’t that big and didn’t last very long, but I wasn’t sure what to expect from the storm. 
Fortunately, a couple of minutes later the other 3 catch up with me. I inform them that there’s a meadow up ahead and to not cross into the open if there was lightning. They pass me and then I catch up with them when they stop at the edge of the meadow. Fortunately, the trail was along the edge of the meadow, so we didn’t have to cross into an open field. A few minutes later, we arrive at our pick up place and SC’s parents are already there, waiting. 
We piled into their van for a quick ride back to the condo. One of the great things about where we are staying is that there are 3 showers and no one had to wait too long. I did hear one particularly loud rumble of thunder while I was showering. Yeah, showering during a lightning storm, probably not the safest thing. Anyway, we all survived our showers, and then started laundry. Dinner was some fattening chicken with cheese casserole dish. It was great. And then we had ice cream. 
After we were showered and fed, I asked SC’s niece’s favorite part of the hike. She answered without hesitation, “The rain!”","VA Route 56/Wintergreen, VA
","Reeds Gap, VA 664/Wintergreen, VA","Jun 28, Fri",10.70
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618155,"Today we decided to just do a short slackpack. The choices were .5, 4.8, 6, 11.4, or 19.1. I chose 6 so we could have some time to check out Waynesboro while we had access to a vehicle and to figure out resupply. SC’s parents had brought a bunch of food and we needed to figure out what we would be taking with us and what would need to be sent in our next resupply. 
SC’s boyfriend and niece joined us again today. It was mostly a flat walk with a couple of good views: Rock Point and Cedar Cliffs. I expected to see a lot of people out because the parking area where we were dropped off was full and it was a Saturday. We did see a few but not as many as I thought we would. 
We got done just before noon. The thing I have noticed over the last couple of days of slackpacking is that it seems easier to hike with a light pack but my legs are still short and I’m still going slow. I do think I’m stronger than I was when I started but only a little faster. It has me getting nervous about making it Katahdin before camping closes in mid-October. I want to see how Shenandoah goes before I start worrying though. 
Fortunately (or maybe unfortunately for SC’s niece), it did not rain today, and when we got picked up, we headed over to Waynesboro to check it out. We got kombucha at Blue Ridge Bucha and then headed over to Rockfish Gap Outfitters. I picked up a few things I needed and asked about shoes. They didn’t have much in my size for trail runners, but they sent me over to Corzet Running. They also didn’t have much in my size, but I got a pair that seems like they will work. I really need to call places before I go so there can be some shoes in my size when I get there. 
Anyway, we went back to the condo, organized stuff (mostly food) for our hike through Shenandoah. We watched the documentary made by the Crawford family about their thru-hike last year. They did it in a little over five months. I think, if they can do it, why can’t I? Well, one thing they did have that SC and I don’t are a bunch of followers on YouTube picking us up at the end of the day and feeding us. They basically slackpacked the 100 Mile Wilderness.  Even so, watching that has inspired me to try and do some longer days, trail legs or no.","Reeds Gap, VA 664/Wintergreen, VA
","Humpback Picnic Area/Wintergreen, VA","Jun 29, Sat",6
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618157,"Today we said good-bye to SC’s family. Everyone slept in for the most part. We left the condo about 11 and started hiking maybe 30 minutes later. First we had to get back to the trail. The picnic area was .3 miles from the AT, but fortunately it was mostly flat. On this particular trail 2 hikers noticed Spike and asked about him. Pretty good for only .3 miles of trail. 
I was kind of hoping that we would hike all the way to the road to Waynesboro today. However, we didn’t particularly start early enough for that. Also I had us doing a lot of bonus miles (walking off trail). I mean, when Guthook comments say things about a view like “Totes amazed balls!” and “Super awesome dope fresh yo!” it’s obviously worth the steep .4-mile round trip plus the climbing we did on the Humpback Rocks themselves. So we are staying at Paul C. Wolfe shelter which is really nice and has a great creek running in front of it.
SC and I also got a new experience today: using a bear pole. You use a long hook to hang your food bag on hooks at the top of a tall pole. I have seen these and understand the concept, but this was my first time actually using one. The pole you use to get the bag to the top was much heavier than I had expected. Plus we’re carrying a lot of food. The guy we are sharing the shelter with was highly amused by our (ultimately successful) attempt. 
Anyway, today was another day of seeing thru-hikers pass us. We saw eight and are sheltering with a guy who started in Georgia but is ending in Harpers Ferry. We are always surprised that we are not the last people making our way to Maine. Although there is a saying out here, “Last one to Katahdin wins.”","Humpback Picnic Area/Wintergreen, VA
",Paul C. Wolfe Shelter (VA),"Jun 30, Sun",8.10
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618734,"Today we left the George Washington National Forest and entered our first national park. Our choices were either stay at the first shelter at 12.7 miles or the second was only 25.7 miles. We stayed at the first.
I had heard Shenandoah was flat. So far it seems as hilly and rocky as it has been of late. There wasn’t anything too exciting today although we did cross I-64. We could have gone into Waynesboro, but we didn’t need anything there. 
We walked across Bear Den Mountain with its communication towers and tractor seats. Then SC and I met up on top of Little Calf Mountain because .3 miles past the summit we hit 400 miles! Little Calf Mountain was followed by Big Calf Mountain and then Calf Mountain Shelter. Apparently the backpacking shelters in Shenandoah are called “huts” but Calf Mountain isn’t technically within the national park boundaries so it still gets to be called a shelter. 
Anyway, we get to the shelter and there are three women sitting at the picnic table. I ask if there’s room in the shelter itself and apparently two of them are staying in the shelter while the third is hammocking. SC and I set up inside and learn that two of them are from Michigan. The other is from Florida and this is her first night backpacking. Later a fourth woman joins. SC had talked with her earlier and she is on her 4th day of hiking. She sets up in the shelter as well. 
So, not counting Spike, there were five women in the shelter and only women. Then there was one of the women from Michigan hammocking along with a young guy who appears to be thru-hiking. We leapfrogged with him all day but haven’t seen him before. Then there are two tenters: a man and a woman who we last stayed with at Porters Gap. 

The female hammocker attempted a thru-hike in 2015, was injured, and then came back to finish in 2016. Anyway, she is super tall, and we all sought her assistance in using the bear pole. SC and I were better than we would have been had we not had the practice at the last shelter, but the stick thing you use to put the bag on the pole was short, so it was difficult for short people like me to use.
Anyway, we all have our food hung on the bear pole except for the tenters. They have packed in wine from town which they were clearly enjoying. Sometime after dark they realize that they need to hang their food. Most of us in the shelter are still awake and enjoying watching the drunk people try to figure out how to use the bear pole in the dark. I guess I should be getting some shut eye now.","Paul C.

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618735,"The slumber party got going early this morning. Everyone was excited for the day, so SC was awakened earlier than usual which meant we started earlier than usual.
The shelter we were staying was .3 miles off the trail and the water was on the path between the trail and the shelter .2 miles from the trail. Anyway, I had filled up last night, so I didn’t stop for water on the way back to the trail. There was a trail reroute almost as soon as we got on the trail. It rerouted us around the next water source. Then there was one source about 1.5 miles from the shelter. It would be our last water source until we reached the next shelter (this time it would be called a “hut”), about 12 miles away.
The six of us ladies all stopped at that source to fill up on water. It was hot too, which made the situation a little more difficult. We saw the tenters throughout the day as well. When we left, the guy in the hammock appeared to still be sleeping. We didn’t see him again. I imagine that he’s still at that shelter waiting for someone tall enough to help him retrieve his food bag from the bear pole.
Today we had relatively easy terrain, but the heat made it difficult. Early on I passed some ripe wineberries, and then I was mad at myself later for passing them up. Later I saw blueberries, so I stopped and picked a bunch for a nice snack. 
We were also offered “trail magic” by a couple of older guys out with backpacks full of honeybuns, fig newtons, and peanut butter crackers. Unfortunately I have to turn these down. SC on the other hand gets to experience her first honeybun. It’s a thru-hiking staple for many because of its calorie to weight ratio. 
At one point in the afternoon it started thundering. SC, the hammocker, and I all put on our waterproof pack covers, ensuring that it would not rain. 
.8 miles before Blackrock Hut there was a sign stating that “due to aggressive bear activity” the hut was still available to hikers but tenting was closed. Between Calf Mountain Shelter and Blackrock Hut there were 3 miles of trail closed to “dispersed camping” (camping in places that are not official, established campsites).  There were no other official campsites, and like I mentioned above, 12 miles without water sources. You pretty much had to do 13 miles (+ the .3 between Calf Mountain and the trail). More warning than .8 miles would have been helpful, especially because we were hiking with 2 new hikers. 13 miles is a big day to begin with when you’re just starting out. They had opened up a picnic area to tenting, but it was another 2.5 miles. Also you had to go down to Blackrock Hut because of the water situation. So a 13.5-mile day could into 15.8 real fast. 


That’s what last night’s tenters decided to do. They came down to get water and then went on to the picnic area to tent, but they are thru-hikers so they had no problem with that distance.
Then, as it was just starting to get dark, the woman who was on day five of her hike arrived. She ran out of water and decided that she would take the road for a 3-mile section instead of the trail. She figured that maybe someone would see her and stop to offer her some water. And someone did! Anyway, 13 miles was the biggest day she had done so far. She announced that she would hike to the campground tomorrow and then take a zero day.
It is the same 5 women in the shelter again tonight. The hammocker also joined us by hanging her hammock along the entrance to the shelter. We called her a bear burrito.","Calf Mountain Shelter (VA)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618737,"So last night was exciting. I first woke up about 10:45 and my sleeping pad had deflated. I tried to go back to sleep but it was too uncomfortable, so rolled to the side and blew it up again. I also heard some sort of flapping noise in the shelter, so I put in my earplugs to block the noise (what I don’t know won’t hurt me). 
About 2 hours later, I am awakened by headlamps. Apparently a couple of the women had heard something outside that they were sure was a bear, so they went out to scare it away. My sleeping pad had once again deflated, so I blew it up again. 
When I woke up this morning, my sleeping pad was fully inflated but I saw a mouse crawling through SC’s stuff. Fortunately nothing appears to have been chewed on. 
Before we got out of camp, a sobo section hiker stopped by to fill up on water. She had stayed at the Picnic Area last night because she was hiking with a dog and they are not allowed in shelters. She had talked to a ridgerunner who said the reason for the closure of tenting here was that some people who were tenting had left their food outside by their tents and got it taken by a bear. 
Today we parted company with our slumber party crew. The hammocker has to drive home in order to go to work on Friday. The other 3 are planning on stopping at Loft Mountain Campground and getting a campsite. SC and I have been planning for some time to go to the next shelter in order to set us up for a 20-mile day tomorrow. We see them off and on throughout the day. 
Our first stop of the day is at the Dundo Picnic Area which is now also the Blackrock Hut tenting site. SC and I agree we could have made it here yesterday if we needed to. The trail between Blackrock and here was relatively tame. 
Finally we reach the campground. SC and I sit outside the campstore charging our electronics. I buy $20 of food and eat everything but some popcorn immediately. Next to the outlets and campstore there’s the nicest bathrooms I’ve seen in months. They also have showers but we still have 6 more miles to hike and we will just be gross and sweaty right after we start hiking again. 
Eventually we tear ourselves away from the wonderful campstore to take our place back in the world of hiker trash. At the next shelter we meet a new-to-us hiker who just returned from an immigration interview. She thinks the way to get the process going is to tell them you’re hiking the trail. She’s tenting. Also tenting are the same 2 hikers we’ve been seeing at the last few sites. We’re sharing the shelter with a guy we met at the Paul C. Wolfe Shelter.
There’s a bear pole here along with a bear box. Most people use the box because it is easier. I use the pole because I’m a pro at it now and because we’re trying to get an early start tomorrow and the tenters are close to the box (which makes a lot of noise to open and close).
I have everything set up to get an early start in the morning. I was going to try to sleep in my hiking clothes, but I just can’t do it so I’ll have to change. I warn our sheltermate that last night I had to reinflate my sleeping pad 2x last night before turning in for the night.","Blackrock Hut (VA)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619119,"I was awake at 5:30 and woke up SC. She was out by 6:10, and I was a few minutes behind her, probably because I had to change from my sleeping clothes to my hiking clothes. I slept well and didn’t have to reinflate my sleeping pad in the night.
SC wanted to try to do a 10x10 (10 miles by 10am), so I told her just to go on and check in by text.  She didn’t make the 10x10 but she did a 10x10:10 and an 11x11:11. 
We were the first ones out of camp. Everyone else passed me about 8:30am. I was planning to break up the day with 2 shoes-off breaks: 1 at 8 miles and the other at 14. My first break was Hightop Hut. I planned on stopping for 30 minutes. However, it took some time to get my shoes off and then there was a south bound section hiker to talk to and the hut register to sign. Then I went to get water. A day hiker then dropped by. By the time I got my shoes back on, my 30 minute break had turned into 90 minutes.
It started thundering about an hour before I took my second break. I was sure Spike and I would get wet, but the rain held off. The second break was at the South River Picnic Area. Because of the threat of storms, I didn’t end up taking my shoes off for that break. I just took off my pack, threw away some garbage, and put on my packcover. I had hoped there would be some families picnicking for the holiday that might feel sorry for me and give me a cold soda, but no such luck. 
It was now about 5:45 and I had 6 miles to go. Those last 6 miles were probably the fastest of the day. By this point it had cooled off and it was sprinkling off and on. My feet had given up on sending pain messages to my brain. The terrain was good for fast miles. And I also got something like a second wind. 
I got to the shelter about sunset. SC had picked up some food for me at a campground just before the hut (I didn’t get there until after they had closed).  The one thing I really was wanting to celebrate this accomplishment was a beer. Somehow there were two(!) waiting for me. I’m hoping my body isn’t completely wrecked when I wake up tomorrow.","Pinefield Hut (VA)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619120,"One of the things that kept me going yesterday was knowing that today we would pass by a campground where we could get showers and do laundry. I have a sensitive nose, and before I started this journey I was concerned that my smell would get to me. For the most part, this hasn’t bothered me but today? Today I felt disgusting. 
We had a relatively uneventful first eight miles to Big Meadows Campground. We each got a shower and then did laundry. A guy who seemed like he must live in the park had lots of questions about our hike as well as lots of advice.
Once we were all fresh and clean, we were presentable enough for Big Meadows Lodge. We were there before dinner service started, so I checked out the tap room. They didn’t have much on their menu that I could have, so I opted to wait for dinner. We sat in this beautiful room with windows that looked out at a view of the Shenandoah Valley. We took this opportunity to charge our electronics and use WiFi to update our phones. 
Finally it was time for dinner. SC got a burger and I had the short ribs along with a blackberry ale. Dessert was a sundae: blackberry ice cream with chocolate and blackberry syrups and whipped cream. Everything was good except for the polenta that came with my dish. I mean, I’m a hiker. I eat food off the ground. If I’m not eating your polenta, it must be bad.
Dinner took longer than anticipated, and suddenly it was 7:30 and we still had 3.5 miles to the next hut. It was thundering, so I put on my packcover and got out my headlamp. SC decided to try and get by without a light. However, when you are walking in the woods at dusk, everything looks like a potential bear. SC saw one such stump, and she did such a double take, she lost her footing and fell. This is her first official fall of the hike. 
Meanwhile, I’m following as usual (I might have taken a quick pee break once we were out of sight of the campground), and I see something on the trail in front of me and my first thought is, “Bear!” But this bear is wearing SC’s pack? Oh good it’s her! Yeah, I had caught up to her (I don’t know the last time that happened), and she told me about her fall. We walk together the rest of the way to the next hut, talking loudly to warn any possible bears about our presence. 
I had told SC we were going to tent at this hut because it was raining and it was supposed to be a particularly leaky hut. Also we knew who would be in the hut, and one of them was not very considerate with sound and light at night. However, once we found the shelter in the dark and saw that there were only 2 people there and that it was raining pretty hard, I had a quick change of mind. We couldn’t even find the tentsites in the dark, and so pitching a tent in the dark and rain suddenly seems impossible. So we set up in the shelter. I’ll enjoy falling asleep to the rain on the tin roof.
I feared that I would be sore or my feet would be mad after yesterday’s 20 mile day, but everything feels about normal for out here.","Bearfence Mountain Hut (VA)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619122,"The plan for today was to do just over 15 miles. I’ve done a 20 now, 15 is nothing, right? Never mind that it is our second longest day since we started.
I was the first one up at the shelter this morning. I got water from the spring down the hill and retrieved our food from the bear box. Eventually everyone else was awake too.
I started hiking a little earlier than our usual of 8:30, maybe 8:00. The elevation profile looked tame, and we arrived at Skyland Resort (4.4 miles away) almost an hour before lunch was being served. Like at Big Meadows yesterday, we hooked into the WiFi and charged our devices while waiting.
SC and I shared the fried brussel sprouts. She had the turkey dinner while I had a salad with grilled chicken. Everything was good once we put more salt on the sprouts. We were disappointed that they didn’t offer the sundae here, but the cheesecake with blackberry compote was an acceptable alternative. Anyway, I’ve been enjoying this eating at restaurants along the trail thing. 
We left a little after 1. We still had 10.9 miles to go, but this is Shenandoah National Park. It’s flat, right?
We first encounter a bunch of day hikers. A woman points me out to her son, maybe 11 years old. “Do you want to do that one day, put everything you need into a pack and go on a long hike?”
“Um, no.”
Most of the day hikers are headed to Stony Man. It’s .2 miles off trail, and we don’t have time for many bonus miles today. Besides, the trail goes right over Little Stony Man which is supposed to have similar views.
I’m going downhill for a little while when I see a sign for a view. It claims it’s only 100 yards away. It was one of the longest 100 yards I’ve experienced. The view was ok, but it was fun to see where people were getting on to climb Little Stony Man. 
SC and I meet up at Byrds Nest #3 Hut to sign the hut register, and make plans to meet up again at Mary’s Rock. It’s only .1 miles off trail and comments on Guthook promise good views. By the time I get up there, I’m already dragging. It’s hard for me to find the motivation to get up and press on to the next hut. But eventually I do get up and start hiking again. SC leaves before me, and I tell her I’ll see her at the hut. 
I have 3 miles to cover and most of it is downhill. I figure it will take me about 90 minutes. I’ll get to the hut about sunset. But there were rocks coming downhill, lots of rocks. I kept seeing the road I was supposed to be crossing and it still looked so far away. I walked for what seemed like forever before getting to a parking lot, and it was there that I saw my 5th bear. It wasn’t a scary encounter, but it did remind me that I was in bear country.
I look at Guthook, and I’m discouraged to see that I still have 1.2 miles to go and they’re all uphill. It’s now dark, so I put on my headlamp. I’m tapping my trekking poles on every rock I can find and on each other, trying to warn any potential bears about my presence. Finally, I see the shelter!  I’m just about there and I see something moving in brush. I let out a shriek. SC hears me. “Are you okay?” she asks.
“Yeah, it was just a rabbit.” It was actually the 3rd one of the day, and besides the ones at Holy Family Hostel, the only ones I had seen on the trail.
Anyway, this was the 3rd day in a row I had come into camp after dark. I need to quit doing this. SC and I had talked about it last night. While a lot of hikers like to night hike, we talked about the downsides: in the dark everything looks like a bear, you can’t enjoy the scenery because you can’t see the scenery, and the hassle of setting up in the dark.","Rock Spring Hut (VA)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619290,"This morning I wasn’t sure if blackberry milkshakes were real or not. You see, one of the things I had heard about Shenandoah National Park is that they have these things called waysides where you could get blackberry milkshakes. There are three waysides in the park. From south to north they are Loft Mountain, Big Meadows, and Elkwallow. Loft Mountain was too far off trail to be worth it, especially because the Loft Mountain camp store was only 70 yards off trail. The Big Meadows Wayside was closed for remodeling, and besides you could eat a more substantial meal at the lodge. This left Elkwallow Wayside.

The question was, do they have blackberry milkshakes? Guthook was no help. Some people left reviews about how great the blackberry milkshakes were while others shared their disappointment over the lack of said milkshakes. Who was messing with who? The Pass Mountain Hut register was filled with entries of people wondering if these milkshakes existed. One person wrote, “If there are no blackberry milkshakes, that’s it, I’m leaving the park tomorrow.” (This is funny because, unless you are super slow or going sobo, everyone is leaving the park the day after staying at this hut.)
Anyway, that was the goal SC and I set out for today: solve the milkshake mystery and set ourselves up to exit Shenandoah National Park tomorrow.
It was a 7.4-mile hike to Elkwallow Wayside. We arrive about lunchtime and see one of our shelter mates from last night. He is holding a 25oz lite beer. “Well,” we ask him, “blackberry milkshakes?”
“Yeah, they’re great. I would have gotten a second one but this beer was calling my name.”
We go inside and there are TV monitors with the menu, but they change too quickly to read. I do see a sign that reads, “Out of blackberry ice cream.”  My heart sinks a little. The woman at the counter notices our confusion and points to a hard copy of the menu. SC gets a hamburger with cheese fries and a blackberry milkshake. I get my milkshake with a salad. Apparently blackberry milkshakes do not require having blackberry ice cream available. 
My salad was a salad, but SC’s hamburger looked amazing (she confirmed that it was really good). The blackberry milkshakes do in fact exist, at least for today at the Elkwallow Wayside. They might be a little overrated, but it was nice to have a flavor that wasn’t vanilla/chocolate/strawberry. It appears that they take a vanilla milkshake base and add blackberry flavoring to it, so the blackberry flavor isn’t as strong as I would have liked, but I don’t regret getting it. 
After our lunch, we try to work up the motivation to hike again. I don’t have cell service to check the weather, but it’s thundering. (It seems like it has at least thundered, if not stormed every day we’ve been in Shenandoah.) We put on our packcovers and start heading towards the next hut. Not long after we start hiking, it starts raining, a little at first and then stronger. It stops before we get to hut. I see a guy heading sobo and we are exchanging the usual hiker pleasantries (e.g., “How’s it going?” and “Have a good hike.”) when I notice he’s bone dry. “Wait, how are not wet?!” I wanted to know. 
“I was at the shelter when it started raining. I just stayed there until it passed.”
I got to the shelter, and I had enough service to see that it was likely to rain at night. SC and I got spots in the hut and caught up with some people we had hiked with before and met a couple of new hikers, all sobo section hikers. All of us nobos are excited to get out of the park and into town tomorrow.","Pass Mountain Hut (VA)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619372,"It did rain most of the night last night. It was still wet and cloudy when we left the hut. As always, it was hard to get motivated to leave when it’s raining. However, we would be getting off the trail tonight and taking a zero tomorrow, so that helped. 
Both SC and I started off with covers on our packs and wearing rain gear. You have to be careful in rain coats: if it is too warm, you’ll be wetter from sweat than you would have been from the rain. It rained pretty steadily through the morning, and we hiked by several viewpoints obscured by clouds. I was careful to move up hills slowly in order to keep from getting too hot. 
Eventually the rain stopped. I began to get warm, so I told myself, when you start to go uphill again, stop and take off your poncho. However, not 2 minutes later, the rain came back with a vengeance. I couldn’t help but sing “Rainy Days and Mondays” in my head most of the day. 
I finally left Shenandoah National Park. I feel like I can say it now that I’m done, but I kinda felt “meh” about the whole Shenandoah experience. Sure there were some nice places to eat, but the views weren’t nearly as great as what we saw in southern Virginia and it rained pretty much every day. The terrain was easier than what we had been doing but not as easy as I had been led to believe. And maybe I just have what are called the “Virginia blues.” Anyway, I’m glad I’m done with the park. 
After leaving the park, the trail became very rocky. Ugh. And this is particularly not fun in the rain. 
SC and I take a break at a shelter (this one is actually called a “wayside” for some unknown reason). Again, we have trouble motivating ourselves to venture out in the rain, but eventually we do and take a moment a couple miles later to take a picture to mark having completed 500 miles!
By this point the rain has mostly stopped but the trail is muddy and slippery. At one point I hear a loud thud. I look around and notice that the ground is covered in walnuts the size of lemons! I move quickly before one hits me in the head and gives me a concussion. 
As we get close to the road, there’s a couple of coolers marked as trail magic, but all we find in them is water which we are not exactly wanting more of at the moment.
At the road, a guy offers us a place to sit and some snacks. We are only a half mile from the hostel and want to get out of our damp clothes and take showers. SC takes a couple of snacks, but he’s not offering anything I’m not allergic to, so I politely decline.
We keep going and wonder if we’ll have the place to ourselves. No one we stayed with last night was planning on stopping here and no one has passed us during the day. We are surprised to show up and find a full house! Apparently the rain has a way of getting people to leave the trail.","Gravel Spring Hut (VA)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619433,"SC and I have been doing a lot of hiking over the last few weeks. We haven’t had a zero day since 6/17 and we both are experiencing at least some level of Virginia Blues. So, we decided to take a zero day in Front Royal. We get a ride into town with a non-hiker guest and then walk all over to resupply and check out the town. The visitors center even has a hiker bag with really nice lip balm. 
My shoe issues continue. If you remember, I picked up new shoes in Waynesboro, a little over a 100 miles ago. They are too big without enough support or cushioning. I went to an outfitter and picked up a pair of insoles. We’ll see how they work. 
When we were done, we got a ride back to the hostel which is now a much quieter place. The weather was nicer so everyone else got back on trail. We’ll join them tomorrow.","US 522/Mountain Home Hostel and B&B, Front Royal, VA

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619436,"We had a good breakfast and said good bye to our gracious hosts before getting back on the trail. Even though it didn’t rain yesterday or today, the trail is still pretty muddy and sloppy.
We basically have our choice of three shelters at 5, 10, or 15 miles. 5 miles is too short and the shelter in 10 miles isn’t very nice, so we go for the 15.
Between the first and second shelters we come out to a road and a woman sitting in a lawn chair asks us if we would like a cold soda. I wasn’t much of a soda drinker before hiking but I now believe it is the nectar of the gods. And today it is hot. This sudden offer of soda is the best surprise. It turns out her husband is hiking. He had to take some time off the trail to have some medical treatment, and she’s slack packing him while he gets his trail legs back. She also has some snacks, again, all things I’m allergic to, but SC has her first Twinkie. It’s a great break, but time to get back to hiking. 

The last 5 miles are difficult, and I get to the shelter as the sun is setting. We are staying at the shelter with 2 thru-hikers and one section hiker on his first day out. The section hiker had been planning this trip with his brother who then backed out. Let’s just say if I were him, I would be mad at my brother for his gear suggestions.
One of the things we noticed in the shelter logs today is that some person (probably a guy, they usually are) has been leaving rambling, conspiracy-filled manifestos. The one for this shelter is particularly long and ends with “pack out my trash.” We have hung his trash on the bear pole. I understand his manifestos have been reported to the proper authorities.","US 522/Mountain Home Hostel and B&B, Front Royal, VA
",Whiskey Hollow Shelter (VA),"Jul 10, Wed",15
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619440,"I didn’t sleep well last night. The section hiker had trouble getting his dinner to cook and didn’t get to bed until after 10. This morning he woke up to find that a flying squirrel had gotten into his food bag that was hanging on the bear pole. One the thru-hikers found that a mouse had tried to make a nest in his backpack. Fortunately, SC and I didn’t have anything bothered. 

The plan for today was to pass the next shelter and then tent a mile or two into the “roller coaster.” The roller coaster is 13+ miles of closely spaced ascents and descents which is notoriously difficult. One of the owners of the hostel where we just stayed was telling us to be sure we respected the difficulty of this part of the trail.
Anyway, we were going to try and complete a mile or two of the roller coaster today, but we ended up just staying at this shelter. There are a couple of reasons for this. First, I’m pretty beat up after our long day yesterday. Also, it was really hot most of the day. Then, it stormed. While the forecast said that it was supposed to clear up again, we decided to just call it a day. 
Last night there were 5 of us in the shelter. Tonight it looks like it is going to be 7 with another 8 or so in tents or hammocks. Where did all these people come from? And while a few are section hiking, most are thrus. They are also people we haven’t met previously.","Whiskey Hollow Shelter (VA)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619443,"Today we began the roller coaster. So far it has been very difficult. It doesn’t help that we had another hot day today. I have learned that the roller coaster isn’t difficult necessarily because of the ups and downs, but rather the rocks. Ugh, rocks, my least favorite type of trail.
We had heard about this hostel about 9 miles into the roller coaster called Bears Den. They’re famous for their hikers special: a bunk, shower, laundry, pizza, soda, and pint of ice cream for $30. I dismissed the possibility of staying here because it was only 10 miles away. We would be there about 2pm, hours before they opened their doors at 5pm. 
I did not get here at 2pm. It was more like 5:30. SC and I went in to see about bunks and we were the first ones to arrive.
I showered first and then started laundry while SC showered. I then got a ride “across the street” (it really was across the street, but it gets quotes because the driveway was a half mile long) to a brewery, while SC stayed and ate pizza and finished up the laundry. By the time I got back, the hostel was full of people, only a few of whom we had met last night.","Rod Hollow Shelter (VA)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619484,"This morning we had pancakes with real maple syrup. In our last resupply box, we had requested this gluten free keto pancake mix. We stir it into oatmeal to thicken it up and add some protein. Well, in addition to the mix, we also got small bottles of maple syrup. I was wondering what we were going to do with it. However, this hostel has make your own pancakes available for breakfast. I decided to make my mix because I couldn’t have the mix provided, topped with real maple syrup (the hostel only had that fake stuff but I really can’t blame them, real maple syrup is expensive) and fresh mulberries.
We left the hostel about 9am to head north again and finish the roller coaster. The plan was to hike about 16 miles and set up camp about 4 miles outside of Harpers Ferry. At one point SC asks why we don’t just hike the additional 4 miles into town. “Because a 20-mile day starting at 9am doesn’t sound feasible. Besides, we just stayed at a hostel last night.” However, we didn’t end up even going the 16. We got to this shelter about 6pm and it seemed too nice to pass up. We are the only ones in the shelter. A father with 2 kids is tenting nearby. 
After we got started today, we saw the woman who gave us the sodas the day before yesterday and got to meet her husband. We crossed a busy road and there were a bunch of day hikers. They appeared to be hiking to a viewpoint just past the VA/WV border. Just before I got to the border, I saw a guy and young woman hiking sobo. The guy asked if I had seen any snakes as he had heard from a nobo that there was a copperhead on the trail ahead. When I said no, he put down a log he had been holding. “And what were you going to do with that?” I asked him with a laugh.
“It was merely for defense,” he told me. 
We then got to the VA/WV border. We will be following the state line for about 15 miles. Here the east side of the trail is in Virginia and the west side is in West Virginia. This shelter is east, so one more night in Virginia. We also finished the roller coaster. I’m glad to get off that ride. 
We hiked by the Blackburn Trail Center today but didn’t want to leave the trail to check it out. Near there I encountered a man and woman out for a day hike. They asked me where I started, “Harpers Ferry?”
I was a little confused as I hadn’t gotten to Harpers Ferry yet. “No, Damascus.”
“Damascus, Maryland?”
“No, Virginia. I’m going north.”


They tried to tell me I was going south, but I checked Guthook and my little arrow showed that I was going north. “No wonder we seem to be getting further from where we were trying to go.” [insert hand to forehead emoji here]
This shelter has an interesting register. There’s a lot of moaning about the roller coaster in it. Someone we hiked with earlier had written that the song “Here It Goes Again” by OK Go had been inspired by the roller coaster. SC did not know about this song, and we had cell service, so I made her watch the music video. She kept saying, “I wonder how many times they fell while practicing.”
The other thing mentioned in the register is the hike to water source. We filled up with extra water at a spring just past the roller coaster as we didn’t want to have to go .3 miles down a steep hill to get water here. Anyway, apparently a woman got to the shelter and went to get water. She didn’t bring her phone or a headlamp with her and ended up getting lost and spending the night trying to keep warm (this was in May) until it was light enough to find her way back. Even though her stuff was at the shelter, no one came to look for her. This is why even when I step a few yards off trail to pee, I always take my phone.","Bears Den Hostel (VA)
",David Lesser Memorial Shelter ,"Jul 13, Sat",11.20
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619567,"We got up early this morning to get in and out of Harpers Ferry. The hike into town wasn’t too bad. There were some rocky places, but also a fair amount of easy trail. There were a lot of day hikers, especially as we got close to town. We finally crossed completely into West Virginia about 10am. I would say we have finished Virginia, but we still have that 3ish miles south of Damascus yet to complete. 
We crossed the Shenandoah River on a busy highway bridge (luckily there was a separate area to walk) and then took a side trail to go to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy Headquarters.
Remember, we were the only thru-hikers at the shelter last night. Today we had not seen anyone on trail except day and section hikers. We figure we’ll be the only thru-hikers at the ATC HQ today. Um, wrong!  We saw so many people we had hiked with recently in town! According to one of the people working the HQ, yesterday they had 20 thru-hikers come through. 
We had to do 2 things at ATC HQ: get our tags and our photo. They have binders of photos of hikers. Anyone who is doing a hike of any length on the AT can get one. They take your picture in front of the building and you write in some info about you and your hike. Disappointingly, Spike got cut out of the picture! He was in there but when the final one was printed, he was gone. If it hadn’t been as busy as it was in there, I would have had them reprint it. 

Then there are thru-hiker tags. We had tried to pick them up from the ATC in Damascus, but they had run out. They said to pick ours up when we got to Harpers Ferry, and now we’re here! The tag indicates that you’re a thru-hiker. On the trail, I find myself looking to see if someone has a tag. It’s a quick way to identify who is a section hiker versus thru.
While we were at the HQ, we flipped through the pages to see who we knew had been through already. We found someone we met early on was only 5 days ahead of us. Someone we didn’t like was 2 weeks ahead. It was fun seeing the many people we have hiked with over the last couple of months. 
After getting all of that done, we head to a restaurant we had heard good things about on Guthook. I ordered the nachos. As the waiter set it down, he said, “The only people who finish these are hikers.” It was an obscene amount of food. I did not finish them, even with substantial help from SC. I had them packed up to go.
We then walked back to the ATC HQ where we found a hungry hiker who was happy to get leftover nachos. We filled up our water bottles, and then headed back to the trail. It was about 4:30 and we still had 7 miles to get to the next shelter. We walked down through the historic part of Harpers Ferry, and then crossed the Potomac River on a railroad bridge that had a pedestrian walkway. When we did that, we completed our first full state: West Virginia! I was disappointed that there wasn’t a “Welcome to Maryland” sign.

The first 2.7 miles of Maryland were super flat as we were following the former C&O Canal Towpath. It’s a bike path so there were lots of people out on bikes. One guy asked if I was a thru-hiker as he rolled by. “Yes!” I answered. I realized that this was the first time I answered with an unconditional affirmative. Usually I say, “That’s the plan.” I think getting my thru-hiker tag and taking the picture at ATC HQ made me feel more official.
As we got to the end of the towpath, I saw a man carrying a cooler. “Do you have any sodas I can take off your hands?”  He opened the cooler to reveal ice cold Coke! He apologized for not having alcohol, but Coke was exactly what I wanted. SC got one as well. We sat on a large rock to rest and drink our sodas. 
Next we had a climb up a hill to get to the shelter. It was tough after such a long day, but made it before sunset. There are two guys here: a nobo thru-hiker and a sobo section hiker. The section hiker was planning on tenting. The other was trying to decide if he should tent or stay in the shelter. SC and I are in the shelter. Anyway, apparently the shelter problem is that the shelter has both a metal roof and a hickory tree. When the hickory nuts hit the roof, it sounds like a gunshot. It hasn’t done it since I’ve been here though.","David Lesser Memorial Shelter (VA)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619603,"Last night the thru-hiker decided to stay in the shelter. SC and I were in the main part, and he decided to set up in the loft (or the “penthouse” as it was referred to in the shelter register). No sooner than he is settled in when “Bang, bang, bang!” Three hickory nuts hit the roof in rapid succession. The three of us just laughed. I didn’t sleep very well. It seemed like whenever I would drift off, another hickory nut would hit the roof. The guy upstairs didn’t sleep well either. I could hear him trying to get comfortable on his sleeping pad all night. 
SC and I had trouble getting motivated to leave camp this morning. Our goal was Pine Knob Shelter in 16.6 miles. However, early in the day, I noticed on Guthook that there was a *free* campground for backpackers in 11.9 miles. My feet were protesting after yesterday’s towpath walk, so plans were quickly changed. 
Today I decided that I like Maryland. It has a lot of rules: you have to camp/stay in designated areas, no alcohol, etc. But they seem to want to make it easy on you, so they have lots of designated areas for campers set up. The whole AT in Maryland is basically a state park. And so far the terrain has been good. 

This morning we didn’t make breakfast because the water source was so far downhill from the shelter and cooking requires water. We ate some snacks and then headed to Gathland State Park. There they had restrooms with flushing toilets(!) and water from pipes that didn’t need to be filtered. SC and I stopped there and made brunch. I went through one of the museums there, got a postcard, and talked to the woman working there. She said she also works at the Washington Monument Park, so I said I would see her tomorrow.
We then walked through a Civil War battlefield. I got a little lost/turned around in this area. I think it would be fun to come back and check out the history stuff more thoroughly. 
Then we arrived at the campground. There were picnic tables, electrical outlets, and running water. Even showers! I took a shower and did a little sink laundry. We set up our tent without the rain fly because it has been so hot lately. Hopefully it doesn’t rain.","Ed Garvey Shelter (MD!)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619834,"I slept well last night, and fortunately it didn’t rain. The clothes I “washed” last night were mostly dry. Anyway, we get on the trail and almost immediately cross a road with a restaurant. If I had known we were that close, I might have eaten here last night.
Early in the day, we get to Washington Monument State Park. I wanted to go to the museum/visitors center and get a postcard for my brother-in-law and talk with the woman I met yesterday at Gathland State Park. It wasn’t clear from my guides or the Washington Monument website where it was. There’s even a map on the website but it doesn’t include the museum. There’s a museum page on the website. It has a picture of a building, but that building is not the museum. Anyway, eventually I find the museum, say hi to the woman I met yesterday, and buy a postcard.
I then meet up with SC at the monument itself. There’s a good view from the top. Behind the monument are piles of rocks: a preview of what is to come. There are also more butterflies than I’ve ever seen in one place. 
Next up, I-70 and US 40: two roads I grew up next to only further east. We cross over 70 on a foot bridge and then almost immediately pass below 40. I take pictures for my family. 
After the highways, we stop for a break at the turn off for a shelter. We are trying to get to the road for Smithsburg before the post office closes at 4:30. That would mean hiking 8 miles in 4.25 hours, not impossible but pretty unlikely. The trail here is wide and fairly rocky. I find myself seeking out the part of the trail with the fewest rocks. I’m making good time but adding distance each time I switch sides. 

Then the thunder starts. I stop and put on my packcover. It rains but not too hard. It then gets really rocky. My pace slows way down as I get closer to the road. I make it there a full hour after the post office closes, so just keep moving on to the next shelter. Fortunately we’ll cross another road early tomorrow that also goes into Smithsburg.

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619836,"The people we shared a shelter with last night got up early but were slow to leave. 3 left before us and 1 was still sitting there when we left.
While I was waiting for SC to wake up and start getting ready, I run some numbers. Yesterday we completed Day 60 on the trail, so I looked at averages for the first 2 months of hiking. While we did significantly increase our mileage in the second month, it’s still slower than I would like. That combined with sore feet from yesterday’s rocks left me pretty discouraged this morning. 
Immediately, it was hot this morning. We were walking through these fields wet with dew and the sun baking us. There was a small section where we went through some trees and the sudden drop in temperature was refreshing.
It was just over a mile until we got to the road to Smithsburg. We crossed and stuck out our thumbs while starting to walk towards town. The first (!) vehicle to pass us stops to pick us up. It’s a guy who works for the Maryland State Parks Department. He drives us to the post office where SC has a package with new shoes waiting for her.
After picking up the shoes, (SC says it feels like she’s walking on clouds) we walk to a Dollar General to resupply (reminder to self: there isn’t much backpacking food to get at DG that doesn’t have wheat, soy, or peanuts). We then go back to the road we came in on to get a hitch back out. This takes us a little longer but eventually a woman who lives nearby picks us up. 
Now back on the trail it is even hotter than before. The trail alternates between flat dirt and difficult rocks. We stop at a creek to get water and there is some sort of camp out for an overnight. I count at least 18 people in the group which seems large. 
A little later we pass another creek where I slip off a rock.  I don’t fall but I do end up with 2 wet feet. 
At one point SC is ahead of me and I’m meeting her at the next park. It’s thundering, so I’ve stopped to put on my packcover. A guy comes up to me and offers tea or “adult beverages.” I look and instead of the usual light beers he’s carrying Budweiser and there’s one can of Founders All Day IPA. I go for the Founders. We talk for a little and I excuse myself to do more hiking. As I start with a beer in my hand, the trail goes down a rocky hill. I find I need to just finish the beer and put the can away. Eventually the trail flattens out again and I pick up speed. I get to Pen Mar Park and it’s raining. I look around for SC and just as I see which picnic pavilion she has set up in, the sky opens up. I was so close to making it, but I get out of the rain rather quickly.

The beer trail magic guy is there. He’s a local and we talk with him about the trail in the area. He gives us information about the campsite we’re going to. When the rain lets up, we use the flush toilets. SC gets her phone back from a maintenance guy who was letting her charge it. Eventually the sun comes out, and we hike on, although we have less than a mile to go.
Just past the park we have an exciting milestone: we leave Maryland and enter Pennsylvania! We have now completed the four state challenge, although not exactly successfully. The challenge is actually to hike from the VA/WV border to the MD/PA border in 24 hours. It took us about 4 days, that’s practically the same thing, right?
We find our campsite, set up our tent, and then go to hang our bear bag. We’ve been staying places lately with bear poles or boxes so we are a little out of practice. SC gets the rope up, but the branch breaks as we are trying to put it up. We end up hanging it from the footbridge that crosses the creek here. That’s not exactly protocol, but it was getting dark and we couldn’t find another tree. 
As we were almost ready for bed we see a headlamp illuminating our tent. It’s a guy we’ve stayed several times over the last 3 weeks. We last saw him in Harpers Ferry. “The guy at the park said you would be here.” We invite him to stay nearby.","Ensign Cowall Shelter (MD)

We stop for lunch and to dry out our tent at Old Forge Picnic Area. They have pit toilets and a water spigot in addition to picnic tables. A guy rides in on a mountain bike and starts talking to a maintenance guy. He sounds like he’s in the midst of a manic episode. He gets back on his bike and starts heading our direction. SC and I look at each other thinking, “What are we going to do?” However, he simply waves at us and tells us to have a nice day.
There’s a summer camp nearby. I recognize the sound and the buildings look cute.
I go to the bathroom, and as I’m walking back to the picnic table, it sounds as though SC is talking to someone she’s really excited to see. Then I notice she’s on the phone. I quickly figure out she is talking to her sister who has just told her she’s pregnant. I go ahead and pack up my stuff as my shoes (which were still wet from their time in the creek yesterday) are now mostly dry. I let SC know where we’ll meet up next and hike on. 
We end up visiting 2 shelters during the day, and then meeting up where the trail crosses Swamp Road just outside of South Mountain, PA. There’s a place to eat and get a shower called the South Mountain Hotel. Between Guthook comments and Google Maps, we figure out how to get there. As we are walking up to the building, it looks closed. There’s only one car in the lot and no sign to indicate it’s open. We place our packs on a picnic table and I go in to check things out. 
I walk into what is clearly a bar complete with cigarette smoke. I tell the bartender I’m a hiker and asks her how things work here. She tells me where I can sit with SC and hands me a menu after having me sign their hiker guest book. I see the name of the guy we tented with last night. Apparently he’s still here!
I go out and SC is talking with the tenter. He’s already had a burger and is getting ready to take a shower. He’s camping in their lawn, so we decide to join him. We put up our tent and then go inside for food. 

The food was great, and the shower was hot (not quite as refreshing as one would hope, but at least I’m clean). SC and I were both craving ice cream after dinner, but their dessert choices are limited to movie theater candy. I go on Google Maps and the closest ice cream place, grocery store, or convenience store is 4.5 miles away. This town has this bar, a couple of churches, some auto repair places, and a sprawling psychiatric hospital. That’s it.
Anyway, Spike, SC, the other tenter, and I all stay up a little later than usual. Finally we head to bed, and the lawn where we set up our tents is already covered in dew. There are bright security lights on the building, so it looks like dusk in our tent even though it is well past sunset. There’s also a road nearby with some traffic. I don’t know how I’ll sleep tonight.","Falls Creek Campsite (PA!)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620686,"I don’t have any trouble falling asleep, but then I wake up about 3am and can’t get back to sleep. I finally get up about 5:30 and everything is soaked in dew. As the sun comes up I try to move things in the sunlight to dry them out. Eventually SC and the guy we tented with the last two nights were up, but with everything so wet, it took us a while to get everything dry enough to pack up. It is seriously hot. At one point I have to go to the bathroom, and the bar isn’t open yet, so I ask SC for our “toilet” (a small sack with a trowel, toilet paper, and hand sanitizer) as she was carrying it yesterday. We look all over for it and apparently it’s gone. I borrow a trowel from the guy we’re staying with. I call the people who manage the Old Forge Picnic Area as that is the last time SC remembers seeing it. With her sister’s announcement yesterday, she must have left it behind. They send someone to look for it, and then call me back later to let me know they didn’t find anything. We’re all up relatively early, but we still don’t get going until 8:30 because we’re trying to get things dry. SC and I stop at a ditch on our way out of town to get water. 
We then walk through the psychiatric hospital (or as the sign calls it, “restoration center”) and there are actual cars and stuff there. Yesterday evening it looked abandoned. Anyway, the grounds and outsides of buildings look really nice. I hope it is a good place for those staying there.
We get back on trail about 9:15. The first thing we do is climb up and over Rocky Mountain. It came by that name honestly. At one point SC asks, “ Do you smell the cows?” I’m relieved that she thinks that there’s a farm nearby. I just thought I smelled bad.
We walk to a park with a pool. The guy taking money (he appears to be a park ranger), is super friendly and tells us where to get water and other stuff. We go to the pool. I change into my pajamas to swim and I do sink laundry with the rest of my clothes (except my socks for some reason). The water is freezing. It’s great. There’s a water slide and I go down it twice. But then I get antsy. We’ve only done 5 miles so far. Eventually I take a shower and put on my mostly dry and slightly cleaner hiking clothes. I attach my now wet sleeping clothes to the outside of my pack.
As SC and I leave the park, we find ourselves facing a huge hill. I start off slowly, hoping not to sweat too much now that I’m sorta clean. As I’m climbing this hill, as insect of some kind lands on the tip of my right middle finger and either bites or stings it. It is so painful. Even as I type this a couple of hours later, it still really hurts. After it stung/bit me, it flew around me for several laps and I was terrified it would hurt me again. Fortunately, it’s just the one. And my finger looks completely fine. It should swell up or turn colors so that everyone else can see that it hurts.
The first shelter after the pool is Quarry Gap. It’s the nicest shelter I’ve seen on the trail. Seriously, the privy has art and air fresheners. There are flowers planted all around. But it’s still early, and there’s a lot of tenting spots coming up, so we push on. Eventually we reach this campsite just past Ridge Road. Fortunately the traffic is light and consists mostly of four-wheelers and dirt bikes. About a mile back there was some coolers left with trail magic. I didn’t take anything because, as usual, it was mostly wheat-based products. SC was able to supplement her food and was nice enough to let me have a bag of chips she picked up (but not the sour cream and onion chips—those were gone before I even got to the campsite). We are not the only ones here: the guy we’ve tented with the last 2 nights is also here. This is the longest we’ve been around the same person.","Swamp Road, South Mountain, PA

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620687,"Today was day two of the weekend heat wave and was supposed to be the worst of the three days. Yesterday we went swimming, today the plan was ice cream.
I was the first one up (as usual). Our campsite mate was the first out of camp and hiking. Now one thing to know about this guy is that he has been hiking for nearly 1100 miles and still hasn’t seen a bear. So guess what comes strolling by the campsite about 20 minutes after he leaves? That’s right, a bear. SC and I have 470 fewer miles completed and we’ve seen six and five, respectively.
We begin the day by passing three different half way markers. For those starting at either Springer Mountain, GA or Mount Katahdin, ME, this is the halfway point. SC and I have another 470 miles to hike in order to have completed the half of the trail.
The terrain for most of our hike today was relatively calm. What I did notice was all the work being done around here to restore the woods to native plants. Some places had been “mowed,” others burned, some treated with herbicide, and still others with some combination of the first three. One area that had been burned in recent years was now covered in blueberries! Both SC and I walked slowly through this area enjoying what she now refers to as “God’s trail magic.” We then walked through an area that was overtaken by some sort of invasive vine. It reminded me of kudzu, the way it covered everything, but it is a lighter shade of green and has arrow-shaped leaves. It also is covered with hooks, so you have to be careful walking by or it will grab you.
The heat wasn’t as oppressive as I had expected. The sky was mostly overcast and there was a good breeze most of the day. It was by no means cool, just not as bad as I thought it would be.
We finally get to the Pine Grove Furnace State Park. They have a store there that has a “half gallon challenge.” The challenge is to eat a half gallon of ice cream in one sitting. If you complete it, you get to say you’ve completed it and you get a small wooden ice cream spoon that says you’ve completed it. The idea is to do something to celebrate completing half of the trail.
Even though SC and I have not actually completed half of the trail yet, we have been looking forward to this challenge. This might be the only “challenge” on the trail I’m interested in. After all, you get to eat half a gallon of ice cream!
Now, one of the issues is that companies don’t sell half gallons of ice cream anymore, so you have to buy 1.5 quarts and a pint. For my 1.5 quarts I got mint chocolate chip and chocolate for my pint. SC got chocolate chip cookie dough and Neapolitan. The first 1.5 quarts went down pretty easily. That last pint was difficult, though. SC said the problem was that I had chocolate. She said she had no problem with the vanilla and strawberry parts of her Neapolitan, but eating the chocolate was a chore. We were kind of limited on what flavors were available, though. Despite the difficulties of the challenge we both managed to eat a half gallon of ice cream in one sitting and neither of us got sick. It took us a little over an hour. We ended up not eating dinner.
Anyway, we spent several hours sitting outside of the store, eating ice cream, charging our phones, talking to fellow hikers, and avoiding the heat of the day. A little before 7:00, we decided to start hiking again and find a place to camp for the night. There was no camping in the park, so we walked out along a very flat trail. Once we left the park, the trail went up a hill and got rather rocky. We found a flat spot just off the trail at about mile marker 1106.5. We put up our tent without the rain fly and hang our bear bag, and then congratulate ourselves for surviving what was supposed to be the hottest day of the heat wave weekend.","Ridge Road Campsite (PA)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620688,"I had trouble falling asleep last night. I used my phone to plan logistics and edit journal entries until about 12:45. Partly I think the problem was the heat, but having eaten a half gallon of ice cream might have also played a role. I then woke up about 5am.
There was no ice cream or swimming pools to look forward to today, just trying to get to the Alec Kennedy Shelter so we can have a short day into Boiling Springs tomorrow. While we had a campsite to ourselves last night, we were passed by a couple of hikers who had tented closer to the park. SC and I made plans to meet at a woods road in 3.5 miles. However, when I got there, she wasn’t there. I texted and she said she was at the road, but she hadn’t realized that the road she was at was 5.3 miles from our campsite. She was in the zone this morning, and went almost 2 miles farther without even noticing!
Anyway, we plan to meet at a railroad crossing in another mile. I leave first and am walking through this swamp and the mosquitoes are eating me alive. When I get to the railroad crossing, I drop my pack as quickly as I can and pull out my insect repellent. Mosquitoes swarm around me as I dive into my pack looking for my headnet. I had been recently wondering if I should send it home. I’m glad I haven’t!
After the railroad, we walk together for a change. There’s supposed to be a convenience store at the next road crossing and we don’t want to miss it as we’ve heard they have good food and we are getting low on snacks.
We find the store and are greeted with a wonderful blast of air conditioning. The 2 guys who passed us this morning are here. We get our food and sodas, then sit down to enjoy the AC for a while. I got a taco salad and it was exactly what I was craving. We were coming up on Old Town Road, and SC hadn’t heard the song, so while we were having lunch, I showed her the video on my phone. That song has been in my head lately, particularly after I asked a 9 year-old section hiker how he was enjoying his hike and his response was to sing the chorus. I’ve changed the words to fit the trail:Gonna take my boots to the old town road,Gonna hike ‘til I can’t no more.
I’m the first one to leave the store. Then over the next mile or so I am passed by the other 3 and 4 others we’ve been hiking with lately. I meet up with everyone at a stream and another hiker shows up that we thought was several days ahead of us. Apparently he got sick after the half gallon challenge and spent a couple of days in a hotel room recovering. We all leave about the same time to cross Old Town Road and then climb a hill where the Rock Maze is waiting for us. The Rock Maze was fun. If followed the blazes, you got right through, but it was easy to think you knew the way and not pay attention and find yourself off trail. It was a nice change of pace to be scrambling through rocks and watching carefully for blazes. So often on the trail we just go on autopilot and plod forward.
After the Rock Maze, a bunch of us met back up at the next road crossing. Most people were going into town, while SC, three guys, and I were stopping at the shelter just 4 miles before. As we left the road it was thundering and we hoped we wouldn’t have to hike in a storm. It seemed like those last few miles to the shelter took forever. I stopped and filtered water at a creek just before the shelter turn off because the water at the shelter was supposed to be difficult to get to. The last half mile carrying all that water was particularly tough.
Finally I got to the shelter and even had dinner made when it started to rain. It had been hot all day, probably even hotter than yesterday and the storm brought instant relief.","Unoffical Campsite at MM1106.5 (PA)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620689,"It stormed off and on last night. One of my last thoughts before falling asleep was that the rain was blowing in and getting my face wet. However, I woke up dry. It was supposed to storm again this morning, so most of us got packed up and going to get into town before it hit.
Hiking was much easier today in the cool air. We began by hiking up Center Point Knob which was an early midpoint of the trail. There was a nice AT plaque at the top. Coming down from the knob, the woods reminded me of Indiana in terms of the flora. There were also sink holes—I could have been in McCormick’s Creek State Park!
Then we came out of the woods and the trail went through corn and soybean fields. Now I definitely felt like I was in Indiana. I was particularly glad it was cool and overcast today. That would have been brutal in the heat. We reached Boiling Springs, and walked through a park with a pond full of clear water. Next thing we knew, we were at the Mid Atlantic ATC Visitors Center. It was across the street from the post office, which had a resupply package for us. We left our packs at the ATC and walked first to a cafe to get an early lunch and then a mile to the grocery store. We supplemented our resupply box with mostly snacks from the store. However, I was disappointed in their lack of the usual snacks I get.  We also picked up a roasted chicken and a couple of bagged salads for dinner. It looked like it could rain at any minute during our walk back, but it held off.
We got back to the ATC about an hour before the bed and breakfast I had reservations for would pick us up. There were other hikers to visit with though. I texted the B&B, and they came to pick us up. We are in the Bluebird Room.
The first thing we did was send everything to be laundered, then SC and I took showers. Then I took a nap! I don’t remember the last time that happened. We ate our chicken and salads for dinner. SC went outside to call family, while I called Spike’s Dad from the room. It finally poured down raining just as the sun was setting. It’s so nice to enjoy the rain from inside something other than a shelter or tent. It’s also nice to really wash clothes. We hadn’t done laundry since Bears Den, 10 days ago! That’s the longest we’ve gone without laundry. I’m looking forward to sleeping in a real bed tonight.","Alec Kennedy Shelter (PA)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620690,"This morning it was hard to get up and get going. I wanted to stay in bed. Breakfast was at 8, though, so got up and had a great breakfast. We then got a ride back to the ATC, and were hiking by 9:30.
Today we had to go at least 14.3 miles because that was the next place any camping was allowed. Today was more corn and soybean fields. At one point I was eating wineberries growing along the trail and then realized that I probably shouldn’t be eating fruit growing so close to a conventional farm field. Fortunately, it was even cooler today than it had been yesterday.
The trail was mostly flat, although very muddy after yesterday’s rain. I will take mud over rocks any day. There were also many road crossings. We saw two trail maintainers out working on the trail. Despite the mud, there was little water on the trail. About a mile before the shelter, the trail left the fields and started heading uphill. We stopped at a spring to fill up with water as the spring at the shelter would sometimes run dry.
There’s a guy here we stayed with at the last shelter and two young women from Montreal who are carrying a lot of different kinds of tape. It’s the Montreal girls, Spike, SC, and I in the shelter tonight.","Boiling Springs, PA/Red Cardinal B&B

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620691,"I was up early this morning to use the Taj Mahal privy. Honestly, I was expecting a little more from something called the Taj Mahal.
The original plan was to walk straight through Duncannon. After all we were just in a town yesterday. However, the women from Montreal were sobo section hikers who had great reviews of a church hostel in town. According to both the AWOL and Guthook guides, there is also a church there that has a hiker dinner on Wednesdays. Well, it’s Wednesday! Plus, I still didn’t have enough snacks to last me to the next resupply. So we decided to stay in Duncannon.
There were a few more fields this morning, and then there were trees and rocks. It was mostly downhill into town. There were some local teen girls at Hawk Rocks. I ended up taking a short cut straight down this steep slope because I couldn’t figure out where the trail was in that section.
When we got to the road, there was a trail to the grocery store blazed by Trail Angel Mary. It went on side streets so that hikers don’t take a busier road. When we got to the store, we saw familiar faces. They were getting a shuttle provided by the store back “downtown.”  We picked up a few things and then took the shuttle. Again, I couldn’t find my usual snacks. I’m striking out with PA grocery stores.
The shuttle dropped us off at the Doyle, an AT institution. I would have liked to have gotten dinner there (the burger is supposed to be great), but dinner at the church is free.
So we found the church offering dinner. They were serving spaghetti and meatballs, so I just had salad, but then they offered me some cold cuts and cheese, so everything ended up great. They also had some non-food resupply items we needed like toilet paper, hand sanitizer, and ziplock bags. After eating, SC and I left our packs at the church, took Spike, and walked back to pick up the part of the trail we missed by taking the shuttle back from the grocery store. It was only a few blocks, but Spike insists we walk the whole trail. We then got our packs and proceeded to move to a different church to stay the night. They had this great basement with air conditioning and a really nice shower with real towels. We’re just sleeping on our sleeping pads on the floor, but hey it’s free!","Darlington Shelter (PA)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620692,"I was the first one up at the church basement this morning. I went over to a diner that serves breakfast and had an omelet and talked with the guy who was waiting tables. He said he was retired and just helping out his friend who runs the diner. It sounds like he travels a lot, and he warned me about the mosquitoes in Maine.
I’m still short on snacks, so I walked over to a convenience store but things were nearly twice as expensive as they are at a grocery store. I was about to go to another convenience store when I saw that the post office was about to open. I heard they had free food for hikers. I went and they had a great selection of protein bars including ones that didn’t have soy! I picked up 5 bars, enough to get me through to my next resupply.
I went back to the hostel. Packed up and managed to get out before SC (she had stayed to make mac and cheese at the hostel). The walk was flat and along roads for several miles, and then I crossed 2 large rivers on walkways on the sides of highway bridges. Then I came to a railroad crossing where I waited for SC.
Now was the fun part: climbing uphill out of the river valley. There were some nice views on the way up at least. It was also rocky in places, but still not bad. We stopped by the first shelter out of town to sign the shelter register. A little later we passed through a parking lot. Someone had left water there as trail magic. It was appreciated because there were not a lot of places to get water.
Our goal for the day was Peter Mountain Shelter. By the time I got there, SC had already been down to get water and returned. There was a sign that said it was 300 steps down. I’m glad she got extra water so that I don’t have to go down or come back up so many steps. A couple of the guys we stayed with at the hostel came by and had dinner before pushing on.

Today the terrain was pretty flat but there were a decent amount of rocks. My feet seem more mad about the rocks than I think they should be. It’s probably time for a new pair of shoes.
It was a quiet day. We saw one nobo and one sobo. We also passed a tent in the middle of the day, which was weird. You tend to see tents early and late in the day. This is the first one I’ve seen with someone clearly in it at 2pm.
The tent site where we are staying tonight is supposed to be haunted. Fortunately we won’t be alone. A guy we haven’t seen before hiking nobo has joined us. He expressed disappointment in the site because it didn’t have open sky so he could see sunset or sunrise. We’ve only seen one sunset and that was back at the beginning of June!

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620694,"I slept well in the haunted campsite. There were also stories in the trail register about fearless deer. We didn’t experience those either. I was the first one up, again. I was practically completely packed by the time SC woke up.
An older woman stopped by about 7:40. She had already hiked a few miles and had about 16 more planned for the day. She said she had thru-hiked in 2015, and was out for a 3-day trip. She had started yesterday. She was asking about water, saying she had gotten some here 4 years ago but there’s nothing in my guides about water here, despite being called Yellow Springs (not sure that yellow water would be that good anyway). She also said the mailbox hadn’t been here either.
Hiking today involved a lot of rocks with a little bit of mud thrown in. We passed a the turn off for a shelter and found ourselves at a beaver dam reroute. The woman I talked to this morning was there saying that she had tried to go down the trail and turned around because it was so wet and mucky. I showed her the sign that warned of a beaver dam and another sign that pointed to the reroute. “Well, that wasn’t here 4 years ago,” she informed us. She then was trying to say that the trail maintainers should trap and move the beavers and then blast the dam. Um, okay lady.
She, SC, and I started walking down the reroute. It was either an old road or train tracks that was now used for bicycles. It was straight and flat. The 3 of us started out together but eventually spread out according to our paces. SC led, the woman was in the middle, and I brought up the rear. After about a mile, there was a sign that showed where to turn to get back to the trail. SC stopped and the woman kept walking right by her. When I got there, we started yelling for the woman to stop. I don’t know the last time I yelled that loud. She wasn’t that far away, but either she didn’t hear us or didn’t think we were talking to her. We were not going to run after her, so we turned and stayed on the reroute.
When we got back to the AT, we stopped for a snack and talked to the sobo we had passed yesterday. Apparently he was just out for the night and was heading back. He’s a local and hikes here often. He was telling us about the beaver dam and some other local info. We start hiking again with plans to meet up by a creek to get water as the place we are camping at tonight doesn’t have any. SC takes off and I start leapfrogging with a few people we’ve been seeing the last few days. At one point, I catch up with a guy who had just passed me. He’s standing off to the side of the trail and I hear the loudest cicada ever. “Everything okay?” I ask. “Yeah, it’s just a nope noddle.” I come over to where he’s standing and he points out a huge rattlesnake at the base of a tree. So, apparently that wasn’t a cicada! I got a picture and a video. You really can’t see much in either but I wasn’t getting any closer.
When I get to the creek, I show SC the video and also sent it to Spike’s Dad. We then press on to our campsite. We cross a road and then a really old bridge. Then we follow an access road for a while. The trail then starts going uphill. It’s a difficult climb with lots of rocks. I feel like it’s taking forever, but eventually I arrive and we set up camp and make dinner. Then we look and there’s a guy we’ve stayed with at a couple of shelters just downhill from us at a really rocky site. We invite him up to stay near us.
As we’re getting ready for bed we see a couple guys we’ve stayed with before pass us. They started hiking this morning at 11:30 and are trying to see how many miles they can do in 24 hours. They are hiking with 2 others who haven’t come by yet.","Yellow Springs Campsite (PA)

It was probably because we camped on a hillside and we knew we would be starting with a rocky uphill. Apparently “Rocksylvania” started just before Duncannon. I’ve just been telling myself lately that the trail is just going to be a big mess of rocks so that I’m pleasantly surprised when it’s not. Today we started off with a big mess of rocks and there were a few smaller messes as we went on, but nothing like I was telling myself it would be.
We stopped by a shelter to sign in. Our last PA shelter for a couple of months! There was a note there about a missing guy. When we got to the next road (PA 645), there were a lot of people in the parking lot, and a van that said “Coroner.” There was a tent set up across the road that could have been trail magic or could have been for the search party for the missing guy. We were headed to PA 501, 2 miles away, and didn’t really need to check out possible trail magic.
Just before 501, my dad is at an overlook with SC. The 3 of us walk to the car where mom is waiting with slushies. We drive to Allentown, PA to stay in a hotel and get ready to drive to Maine tomorrow. You see, back during the torture that was the roller coaster, I was thinking about PA and its rocks.

One of the things I noticed is that it light out earlier here.  I looked out at 6am and it was full daylight.  That’s usually the time I get up because it is when you can first see.  I hadn’t thought about the fact that we had not only gone north, we had gone east, so sunrise and sunset are earlier.

When we get to the end of the reroute, we are a mile in and have not done any significant ascent yet.  I start to get worried.  I have not read any summit accounts recently, but the one thing I remember is that there is about a mile of flat before the sign.  That means we will be climbing 4,000+ feet in 3 miles? That sounds hard. 
I didn’t want to get out Guthook while we hiked, so I could be as surprised as possible. SC did the same. After the stream, there were rock stairs. Not too difficult. Then it got a little harder. I kept coming to these 4-foot ledges, and I would have to put my trekking poles up on the ledge in order to haul myself up. When we got to the tree line, we both put our poles away because we could see that we were going to be pretty much rock climbing for the foreseeable future. We could see little tiny people high on the rocks above us.
We climbed with a group of friends who were out for a hike and a family with elementary aged kids. Several nobos who were finishing their hikes passed us, and we met a few people who were flip-flopping like us. We met one woman who was going to do the trail sobo, but had started by hiking the 100 mile wilderness nobo and then climbing Katahdin. She’ll start from Monson, and we might see her again. 
Anyway, after climbing for what seemed like forever, we get to the “Tablelands.” It is mostly flat but fairly rocky. I try just to walk but soon get out my trekking poles again. We look up and see tiny people up on a ridge maybe a mile away. “Do we have to go all the way over there?” SC asks pointing to the far end of the ridge. “I don’t know.” I still don’t want to look at Guthook. 
After a long, flat but rocky walk, we start ascending some rock stairs. Then, suddenly, there’s the sign! Apparently we wouldn’t have to walk all the way to the end of the ridge. 
I thought maybe I would cry when I saw the sign. I usually cry when I read about people’s summits. But maybe because we’ve only been hiking 700 miles it’s not as impactful? Or maybe I don’t cry as easily these days. There have been several times on the trail so far that I probably would have cried prior to hiking and I just haven’t. I think all the exercise is helping me work through my emotions in a way. 
SC, Spike, and I all get our pictures taken with the sign individually and together. We eat a snack and then head back down. When we get to the climbing part, I put my poles away again. 
In general, climbing up is easier than climbing down. The whole way up I tried not to think about how I was going to get back down. It ended up being easier and less scary than I thought. However, it did start thundering and eventually it rained. That made things a little bit more challenging. I did a lot of sliding down on my behind. My hands became pretty raw. 
When we got to the tree line, it became a little more easier because I could use trees for support. Bark is easier on the hands than rocks, but sometimes there is sap. We stopped for water about 2 miles from the campground, and I finally got my trekking poles out again. On the way down I noticed markings that indicated 2 miles and 3 miles from the summit. I hadn’t seen them on the way up. 
We crossed the stream without incident and headed down to the parking lot. My parents had been getting worried. All together, we were gone about 11.5 hours. 6 hours up, 1/2 hour at the summit, and 5 hours down. I would say it was by far the most difficult day of hiking I’ve ever done except that it was more climbing than hiking. And even though we went 10.4 miles, we only get to count 5.2 towards our trail total. 
We got dinner on the way back to the hotel. We then showered before getting to bed. Another night getting to bed well after hiker midnight. We have to get up early again to get into the park to finish the rest of the trail in the park.","Baxter Peak, Katahdin (ME)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621052,"We got up early again to go back to Baxter State Park. We left a little later but still made it to the park on time. There wasn’t a line of cars waiting for parking passes this morning. I wonder if it’s that there is a higher chance of storms today, if people prefer to climb on the first day of the month and are waiting for tomorrow, or a bit of both. 
Hiking today was rooty but fairly flat, especially compared to yesterday. I’m very sore today. It hurts more stepping down than stepping up. My arms are even sore.
We got to see some waterfalls and cross a couple of creeks. The guides said we would have to ford one, but I made it across by rock hopping, even with my short legs.
At one point we ran into mosquitoes. People had warned us, “The mosquitoes in Maine are the size of birds!” They didn’t seem bigger to me than the mosquitoes in Pennsylvania, but there were more of them and they were aggressive. I had on long pants, a long-sleeved shirt, a bug headnet, and bug spray on the backs of my hands, so they bit the palms of my hands! The good news is, my immune system no longer feels like it needs to have a huge reaction whenever I get bit. The bites are annoying but after an hour or so they don’t itch. 

The last few miles were along the Penobscot River. I saw a bald eagle flying downstream. We both saw 3 nobos that will summit Katahdin tomorrow and finish their thru-hikes. It’s exciting to see their excitement.
We left the park and got a beautiful view of Katahdin. The next half mile was a road walk. We got to a restaurant and my parents were there, so we joined them for lunch. We then made them drive back to the view of Katahdin and take our picture. 
The rest of the day was packing and organizing to begin the 100 mile wilderness tomorrow. Fortunately we can sleep in a little in the morning because we don’t have to go into the park.","Katahdin Stream Campground/Millinocket, ME

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621053,"Even though we could sleep in this morning, I woke up about 4:45. I went down to the hotel lobby and tried to update the blog but couldn’t get the WiFi to work. I had yogurt and bananas for breakfast. 
My parents drive us back to the restaurant where we left off hiking yesterday.  We say goodbye and begin hiking. We are on the road for another half mile or so and then see the sign that we are entering the 100 Mile Wilderness!

The mosquitoes are bad again. SC got out her bug spray and immediately ran out! She’ll have to carry the empty can for the rest of the 100 miles.
We asking people who we pass if they are thru-hikers. We meet a few, but most people are section hikers. I meet a guy who started a thru-hike in 2011 and is finishing up the last 850 miles. He tells me he’s seen 2 moose today!
Moose are something I have never seen in the wild, so I hope I get to see one. I’ve started seeing moose poop, at least that’s what I think it is. It looks like deer poop only 5x bigger. I also saw a moose track today. 
We stopped at a shelter (they’re called “lean-tos” in Maine for some reason) and talked with a few people there. The plan was to hike to the second shelter for a total of 15 miles, but the hiking was very difficult today. It didn’t help that I’m more sore today from the Katahdin climb than I was yesterday. Also, I’m carrying the most food I ever have at one time which also makes things harder. 
After the lean-to, we meet up at this place called Rainbow Ledges. The ledges are covered with blueberry bushes with ripe berries. SC picks almost 2 cups while she’s waiting for me. There’s a great view of Katahdin here. 
SC and I were planning on meeting up at a campsite with a spring to get water. 1.3 miles from the campsite, I fell for the 5th time on the trail. I’m not sure what happened, but I figure I must have tripped because I fell forward and ended up with my face just inches from the rocks. It was the first fall where I had to take off my pack in order to get up. Anyway, not long after I came up on SC. She had forgotten where we were meeting. I told her we would just stay at the upcoming campsite because I had fallen and didn’t want to go farther. 
When we get to the campsite, it’s pretty full. There’s a group of campers doing a 22(!) day trip from Stratton, ME to Katahdin. The counselors have some of the campers move so that we can have a space. In addition to the campers, there appear to be 3 nobo thru-hikers and a guy with a huge food bag, so I’m gonna guess he’s a sobo. 
We heard from a nobo that we don’t have to worry about doing a bear bag hang here, which is good because our bags are heavy. We’re going to sleep with our food and hope for the best. We can hear both loons and seagulls from the nearby lake.","Abol Bridge/Millinocket, ME
",Rainbow Spring Campsite (ME),"Aug 01, Thu",11.50
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621054,"The loons went crazy all night last night. I’ve never heard so many. It was a comforting sound, and it helped me sleep well. I did wake up to hear something walking around in the dark. It was probably only a deer, but I was more comfortable with earplugs in.
Before we flipped, I was getting up most mornings at 6, SC would wake up about 7:30, and we would start hiking about 8:30. This morning I got up at 5, SC 6, and we were hiking at 7! However, all the nobos were up and on the trail before 6. The campers were all still in bed when we left.
Today began with lots of mud but there were what appeared to be new steppingstones put in place. Thanks volunteers! I saw more moose tracks in the mud (okay, now I want ice cream). 
We stopped by the shelter we were aiming for last night, talked to a family who was doing the 100MW there. We then stopped by some cascades that a nobo we saw said was a good swimming spot. I tried to swim but I was too cold and so was the water. 

There was a nobo man and woman I passed this morning. They appeared to just be section hikers. Anyway, the guy says to me as I pass, “You smell like soap!” I’m sure when I’m this close to the south end of the 100MW, everyone going nobo will smell very clean. It’s something that you notice when you haven’t showered in a while.
I saw a nobo thru-hiker later who said, “That’s a nice color [referring to my shirt which is pink and white plaid]. Everything I own is dirty and muddy.” I want to call my shirt the “I’m-not-a-thru-hiker” shirt because people think it looks so nice there’s no way I’m a thru-hiker. I do think it’s some sort of magic shirt because it never gets very dirty looking. 

Then we climbed our first named mountain of the 100MW: Nesuntabunt Mountain. We didn’t actually go to the summit where there was a view of Katahdin because there was a good view from the trail. The “climb” was less than 500 feet. SC had service and talked to her mom and one of her sisters. I didn’t have any service.
Going up the “mountain” wasn’t too bad, it was coming back down that was difficult. This is how SC described it later to a nobo: Someone took a stick, drew a line in the dirt down the side of the mountain, and then threw rocks all over it. It was a discouraging mountain probably because it seemed so small and yet was so difficult. I thought the 100MW was supposed to be relatively easy.
At some point coming down the mountain my right foot started to hurt. We were going to try for the next shelter, but we met up at this campsite and my foot was hurting. I don’t think we could make another 3.5 miles before dark anyway. When I got here, SC was helping an older couple unload their things and take them to a tent site. There are two tent sites here plus some other places where you can set up tents, they just don’t have picnic tables. 
We are on a grassy spot not far from the lake. It was windy when we first arrived but it’s since died down. I went wading in the water; SC went in completely. We are able to watch the sunset from here. However, our neighbors in one of the campsites (not the ones SC helped) came out on the beach about 2 minutes after the sunset. I think they came out about 30 minutes before “sunset” not realizing that from this angle the sun would be setting behind a hill making sunset earlier. Anyway, I hope the loons sing to us all night like they did last night.","Rainbow Spring Campsite (ME)
",Nahmakanta Lake Campsite (ME),"Aug 02, Fri",14.30
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621056,"I heard a few loons last night, but not nearly as many as the night before. I woke up at one point and it was completely silent. As I was going to sleep, I heard the couple SC had helped walk out to the beach. I never heard them leave, so they must have been quiet or I must have been very asleep.
I got up to use the privy this morning and had to walk by the 2 tent sites. There were no tent set up, everyone was cowboy camping. I do not trust the Maine weather enough to do that yet. 
Today was much easier hiking than the last 2 days. We got to this campsite before 3pm. We didn’t climb any mountains today. I did kinda get lost after stopping at one of the lean-tos and I noticed some new rock stairs, but otherwise the hike was pretty uneventful. We even stopped before I was tired and my feet were mad. 

This was the first goal of the day. We had a secondary goal of pushing on to Jo-Mary Road, another 4.2 miles. I give SC the choice to stay here or push on. She doesn’t like making decisions, so this is good for her. It isn’t often that there is a decision like this to make. I think she wants me to step in and make the “adult” decision to move on. What we need to pay attention to is getting to Monson, ME by the time her parents come up on the 8th. We can stay here, average 11 miles a day, and still make it to Monson on time. It does make things a little tricky for tomorrow. We can either do 8 or 16 miles. I hope we can make the 16.

The campsite is on Jo-Mary Lake, on a peninsula. SC picked out a tent spot right at the end of the peninsula. We should be able to see sunset and sunrise from here.
Before making dinner, we went for a swim. The water wasn’t as clean (a lot of algae) as last night’s lake, but it was cooler, more refreshing. There are a lot of people camping here, and we got to talk to several. I count at least 3 nobo section hikers, 2 nobo thru-hikers, and 6 sobo thru-hikers. On of the sobos was the guy we saw at the first place we camped. I’m surprised that there are so many sobos starting this late in the summer. 
We were both tired, so we went to bed early. SC was asleep by 6:30. Unfortunately, it was too cloudy to see the sunset. SC has asked that I wake her up for sunrise. I did have to wake her up just now to close up the tent because it is raining.","Nahmakanta Lake Campsite (ME)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621231,"Last night I dreamed that I went to a pho restaurant. I was trying to figure out if they had anything I could eat given my allergies. Someone took me back to the kitchen where I was lectured by someone who had taken a class in “family development,” where she had learned that allergies were psychological. Meanwhile, SC was dreaming that she was in the house of someone she didn’t know, but they had an amazing pantry filled with every kind of cereal. Apparently we were both dreaming about food. 
I woke up at 5 and the sun was not yet up. I woke up SC so that she could watch the sunrise. I went to find the privy. I finally found it on the other side of the trail. Inside was the register for the campsite. The privy had 2 seats, so most of the register entries referenced this. 
I got back to the tent just as the sun was coming up and decided to make breakfast on the beach. This added a little time to the morning routine, so we ended up leaving about 7:15. 
We stopped to have lunch at a lean-to with a beautiful swimming hole right in front. There was a Guthook comment that said, “If you don’t swim here, you’ll regret it.” It seemed too cold and too early to go for a swim, so I plopped myself down by the water where I could dangle my feet in. I was telling SC how good the water felt when I looked down and saw something black on the little toe on my right foot. A Leech! I quickly removed my feet from the water, and asked SC to pull the leech off. I then noticed another one on my right heel! SC couldn’t get that one, so I had her get the salt from my food bag. I sprinkled some salt on it and it let go. I now wonder if the comment on Guthook actually was, “Don’t swim here; you’ll regret it.” or if it just was an older comment. The register entries from last year say, “Amazing swimming hole.”  This year’s say, “Argh! Leeches!”
I left that lean-to a little traumatized. We then climbed our second named mountain of the 100MW: Little Boardman Mountain. It wasn’t anything too exciting, but I did see a hiker whose vlog I had watched. I managed to control myself and not go all fangirl on her. 
Anyway, even with the longer miles and crossing a mountain, we still made it to this shelter at a reasonable hour, and I don’t feel like my legs or feet are mad at me. I would still like to put my feet in the water here (it’s nice to stand in a creek at the end of the day while filtering water), but the water source here is full of leeches—you can see them!!
We are sharing the lean-to tonight with the sobo thru-hiker that was tented near us the first night in the 100MW. There is another sobo thru-hiker here and a flip-flopping couple we met when we summited Katahdin (but we don’t know their names). There are at least 2 others tenting, but I don’t know anything about them.","Antlers Campsite (ME)
",East Branch Lean-To (ME),"Aug 04, Sun",16.10
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621232,"I didn’t sleep well last night. It didn’t help that some guy came in at 11:20pm and set up in the lean-to. Then his alarm went off at 5am. However, he appeared to be still asleep when we left at 7. 
Last night I noticed there was a ton of moose poop around the shelter. I was hoping that we might see a moose this morning but no dice. 
Today’s challenge was White Cap Mountain. We stopped at the first lean-to, which was only 3.6 miles into the day. We talked to the sobo thru-hikers we stayed with last night and commiserated over the late-night arrival. Also, there was a really nice privy at this lean-to. The graffiti inside suggested it had been used as a shelter for sleeping. I could see staying there. 

The lean-to here was full when we arrived, so we are tenting on the other side of the Gulf Hagas Brook. I went down to the brook while dinner was rehydrating to get water. I could put my feet in here—the leeches aren’t bad here. As I was filtering water, a nobo thru-hiker was there telling us sobos to respect southern Maine. He said if we do a 10 mile day, we should pat ourselves on the back. He said once we pass the White Mountains in New Hampshire, things would get substantially easier. We’ve been hearing this a lot lately from nobos.
Anyway, we are tented next to a trail crew who is working nearby. I hope that means there is some nice trail in the morning. The 2 sobos we stayed with last night are also tenting somewhere nearby. It’s a pretty crowded place.","East Branch Lean-To (ME)
",Carl Newhall Lean-To (ME),"Aug 05, Mon",10.80
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621548,"Last night I kept having dreams that I was somewhere and the lights would get turned off. At one point in the dream I was trying to swim in a pool and in another, I was in my grandma’s kitchen. I have no idea what that means, but I woke up with the song “18 Wheels and a Dozen Roses” in my head. SC was not familiar with the song, so I sang the chorus. SC thinks that the line “10 more miles on his 4 day run” might have something to do with it. We did 10 miles yesterday and we now have 3 days left in the 100MW. 
Anyway, I got up early and first thing I noticed was that there was a tent right next to ours that wasn’t there last night. They must have been really quiet because I had no idea they were there. I then trekked across the brook to visit the privy. When I came back, I started making breakfast. I heard hoofsteps. It sounded like a horse. I stood up and not 15 feet away was a moose. I told SC, “Wake up. There’s a moose.” while getting out my phone to get a picture or video. I ended up taking a video. Then, here comes a second one! The first was a female, and this second one was smaller, so I’m guessing it was her calf. Anyway, our first moose! SC was surprised at how big they were. Also, everyone back in Indiana was telling her how aggressive they are, so she was also surprised that they basically ignored us.
Today we were to climb another mountain. This time it would be Chairback. We got going a little earlier than usual because of the moose excitement. The 2 sobos we’ve stayed with the last 2 nights passed us early in the day. Neither of them had trail names yet, but one was super good about taking care of his feet, so I decided he should be Dr. Scholl. If it sticks, it will be the first trail name I’ve bestowed on someone. We probably won’t see him again, though. He’s moving faster than us even though he just started. The other sobo is also faster but he is doing this side trail with waterfalls today that adds some extra miles.
Another first for today was our first ford! A ford is when you get to a creek or river that doesn’t have a bridge and there are not rocks that you can use to hop across. Apparently it’s been a dry summer because there have been other places where the guidebooks have said we would need to ford, but we managed to find ways to get across without getting wet. The West Branch Pleasant River was not one of the places where we could rock hop. We took our shoes off and put on our camp shoes (we both have a pair of knock-off Crocs that we wear around camp) and crossed the river. It was about 20 yards wide but even the deepest section came up to mid-calf on me. 
After the refreshing ford, it was time to start up Chairback Mountain. It seemed to take forever. Every time we went up for a while, the trail would go back down again. I was beginning to wonder if I would ever make it to the top. A guy coming down said, “Do you have a climb ahead of you!” Ugh. 
At one point I was walking across these wide, flat rocks. It was easy hiking and it reminded me of hiking in New York. Anyway, I look up and see this rock face ahead, of me and thought, “Oh no, I’m going to have to go up there!” Eventually I get to the part where it goes up. On Guthook this is marked as a “rock slide.” It’s basically a pile of large, jagged rocks. It was not a fun climb but I’d rather go up it than down. I get to the top where there are some nice views and cell service.
The next lean-to is not much farther from the summit. We stop by and sign the register, but it’s still early and there’s no water. We cross another mountain. This one is called Columbus and then find an unofficial campsite just .3 miles north of a stream. We set up our tent, and the sobo who took the waterfall trail shows up. He sets up as well and he and SC make the .6mile round trip for water. I find a spot not far away that is filled with moose poop. I mean, this might be some sort of moose gathering place. Maybe we’ll see moose 2 days in a row!","Carl Newhall Lean-To (ME)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621549,"When I had cell service yesterday, it said there was a 50% chance of rain today. I woke up to sounds of raindrops on the tent. I woke up SC and we closed our respective sides of our tent. I looked and it was 3:21am. It took me a while but I managed to fall back asleep. I woke up again and it was 4:45–too early to get up. I fell asleep again and had a dream that I went to the Y to pick up my middle sister’s kids (which has never happened btw). The girls were there but I couldn’t find their brother. The Y was closing for the night, so I went to the front desk to tell them there was a missing child. I finally found him under a bed. “I took a nap!” He announced triumphantly. I then went outside to sit and watch some water fountains, but apparently it was part of one of those giant swing amusement park rides. I closed my eyes and tried to enjoy the ride. I woke up and it was 5:21, the latest I’ve slept while in Maine. 
No moose this morning. We got going about 7:30 and walked south to the stream to get water before starting up Third Mountain. As I am coming down Third on my way up Forth (apparently they got lazy naming the mountains around here), I saw a familiar face! It’s a guy we shared a shelter with in Virginia, just before we did Dragons Tooth.  He has been doing the trail in sections and is finishing up his last section at Katahdin! A little while later, more familiar faces. It’s the 3 May flies we met at the Holy Family Hostel in Pearisburg, VA. 
After Forth Mountain, we walked through a beautiful bog. It had pitcher plants. I don’t think I’ve ever seen pitcher plants in the wild. These were even blooming. 
All day it threatened rain and there was lots of climbing. Once we came down Barren Mountain, things got a little calmer terrain-wise. Even so, I managed to have fall #6. My right foot stepped on a loose rock and went forward while my left leg bent under me. I fell to the right and I’m sure I’m going to have a bruise on my right arm where I fell into a tree. Fortunately, nothing is seriously injured. 
We stopped by a lean-to for a break and to sign in. There were rumors of trail magic south of the lean-to, but we passed the next road with no signs of anything. Then 2 nobos passed saying that we had to go to the trail magic. Then we got to a logging road and followed the sign. We get to a hunting cabin and a dog comes out to meet us. Then a couple of guys appear on the porch. They give us soda and potato salad and make us cheeseburgers. I also have a beer. Another hiker shows up and they do the same for him. 
As I sit there, I feel my left knee stiffen up from the earlier fall. The trail angels bring me one of those instant ice packs. About 7pm, it starts to sprinkle, and we have 3.3 more miles to the shelter. SC and I decide to leave. I’m moving slowly because my knee hurts but it loosens up as I walk. The trail angels try to tell me to stay. If I can’t walk in the morning, they can get me into town. But if I’m fine, we have almost 14 miles to do to meet SC’s parents tomorrow. I told them we would be to the road by 2pm. I won’t be able to make that. I’ll also feel silly if I stay and everything is fine in the morning. I’m hoping we can stay in the lean-to so we don’t have to pack up a wet tent in the morning. At least, this is how I justified leaving and pushing on to the lean-to. 
I told SC to go ahead and find a place for us in the lean-to and I would be there as soon as I could. We left just after 7pm and I turned my headlamp on at 7:45. The first 2 miles were slow: 1mph. It hurt to bend my left knee. Fortunately, the trail was well marked. Unfortunately, there were several boulder fields which are usually tricky, let alone at night with a bum knee. 
After 2 hours (2 miles), my knee apparently warmed up or something because I was able to walk normally. The terrain also improved, and I picked up speed. The whole way I’m thinking that we should have stayed with the trail angels or I should have told SC to come back to find me once she got set up at the lean-to. Around 9:30 it started to rain. 
Just before 10, I heard SC ask if it was me. Apparently she had been sitting there in the dark for about an hour. Her headlamp wasn’t working and there was a short reroute because of a beaver dam. She had done well following the white blazes that mark the trail because the white almost glows in the dark, but the reroute was marked with pink survey ribbon that she kept loosing, so she just sat down and waited for me. 
I led the way through the reroute and on to the lean-to. We had only been about .2 miles away. We see a tent set up with a huge tarp over it and gear out in front of the lean-to, so we found a semi-flat spot and did a quick pitch of the tent and threw all our stuff in there. It’s 10:45 and we finally have everything set up for sleeping.","Unofficial Campsite MM2102.1 (ME)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621551,"I had trouble falling asleep. I thought I probably wouldn’t sleep but ended up getting several hours of shut eye. It was about midnight when I heard an eerie sound. I then remembered that there were train tracks nearby.
At 2:30 I wake up to water splashing on my face. I turn on my headlamp to try to figure out what’s going on. I can’t quite figure out why I’m getting wet, so I turn off the light and try to get back to sleep. I turn over and suddenly my leg is cold and wet. I turn the light back on. There is a creek running through the middle of the tent. I grab Spike and pile my sleeping bag on top of my sleeping pad. I figure I will be awake the rest of the night, but somehow I manage to get back to sleep. 
I wake up at 5 and need to use the privy. It takes me some time but I eventually I find it. It’s now light enough to see so I stop by the lean-to. There’s only one guy in there and we know him! It’s the same guy we’ve stayed with every night in the 100MW with the exception of night 2! If we had known, we would have totally woken him up to get space in the shelter and not have a wet tent. 
I bring a bunch of my stuff to the lean-to and make breakfast. Our 100MW friend wakes up and then I wake up SC to tell her he’s in the lean-to.
It was still raining. Not particularly hard, but everything’s wet. It makes it so hard to get moving. I told SC’s parents we would meet them at the road in just over 10 miles at 2pm, so I need to get moving. The 3 of us plan to meet up at the next shelter in 7.4 miles. We do cross the first stream together. It is a ford, but we leave our hiking shoes on because they’re going to be wet anyway. 
I am moving, trying to make the deadline. In some sort of miracle, my left knee isn’t hurting. I run whenever I can, which isn’t much. There are no named mountains today. There is a second stream that I end up fording. Usually it is a rock hop, but the rocks are slick in the rain, so I just plow through.  There are rock ledges I walk on for quite a ways. They are not too slick and the wind is blowing while the rain has stopped, so I dry out a little. 
I get to the lean-to and a hiker has this huge fire going despite the rain and wet wood. SC says her parents have just got to Maine, so we have some time. I am completely out of snacks, so we cook one of our dinners for lunch. 
SC has service so I ask her to ask her parents when they expected to get to the pick up spot. She tells me 4:15. “We have plenty of time.” But that’s a little over 2 hours and we have 3 miles to go. If it’s anything like the rest of the 100MW, it’s going to take me at least 2 hours to go those 3 miles. 
And I’m right. I leave at 2:10 and get to the parking lot about 4:30. Fortunately they haven’t been waiting too long. I am soaked by the time I get there because even though I was almost completely dry, I get caught in a downpour about 4pm. 
We pile into their van for the 2 hour drive to Carrabassett, ME.  Even though I’m wet and miserable, just knowing that we are heading towards a shower and real beds makes it doable.","Wilson Valley Lean-To (ME)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621553,"Today was recovery from the 100MW. I was kind of disappointed that it took us 8 days to go 100 miles. I had heard the 100MW was “easy,” but maybe that’s just in comparison to the rest of Maine. We came from Pennsylvania, where there are a lot of rocks, but not a lot of elevation. I checked my phone stats last night. I think I mentioned it before but I have an app on my phone that counts my steps and tells me how many flights of stairs I’ve climbed each day. In July, I had a daily average of 77 flights. So far in Maine? 166! No wonder this is so hard. 
Anyway, today was mostly organizing food. It was also a day to sit and put my feet up. I am so thankful for a day of rest.","ME Route 15, Monson, ME/Carrabassett Valley, ME

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621554,"So the reason we are in Carrabassett Valley, ME is that this is where SC’s parents could find a place to stay that was reasonable in price. It didn’t make sense to either drive back to Monson to do a slack pack or to take 2 consecutive zeros. So I found an 8.3-mile section not far from the cabin.
SC, her brother, her boyfriend, Spike, and I were dropped off by her parents on Caribou Valley Road. The road is closed during the week but open on the weekend. Fortunately this was a Saturday. When we got to the end of the road, there were tons of cars parked there. I wonder if the weekday closures makes this place more busy on the weekends. 
Anyway, once we got dropped off, we had to walk about a half mile to the trail. The younger 3 quickly pulled ahead of Spike and me. I was about half way to the trail when a teenaged boy approaches me and asks where the trail is. Well, it’s basically the opposite way he is walking .2 miles. We walk up to the trail together. He is part of a summer camp that is doing a 10-day trip south. When we get back to the trail, some of the other campers are there and he goes with them. When he came to the road, he should have taken a slight right and instead took a major left and kept walking. 
Anyway, we get started and not long after pass a campsite. There are two older men there and we exchange pleasantries. (Oh, I should say, for today we are nobo, just to make things more confusing.) A little while later I am passed by what appears to be a middle aged couple out for a day hike. They are hiking particularly fast, and that’s when I realize the reason for all the cars: peak baggers! The 2 peaks we are crossing today are both over 4,000 feet and are part of a challenge to climb every peak over 4,000 feet in New England. The reason these non-thru-hikers are so fast is that they spend their weekends climbing mountains. I’m soon passed by the 2 older gentlemen and one guy out by himself. 
It’s off and on raining and for the most part cloudy. It’s cold and I wear my rain jacket both to keep dry and keep warm. The sun comes out for a while but of course not when we are high up and can get any views.

The lone hiker passes me going back down before I even get to the first summit, South Crocker. I take the gentlemen’s picture on top and then move on to Crocker. The couple passes me on the way to the second summit.
On the second summit, Crocker, I meet up with a couple of nobo thru-hikers. The guys show up and I take their picture again. I ask them how many of the summits they have so far. They say 60-62. 
SC, her crew, the nobos, Spike, and I continue north while the peak baggers turn south to go back to their car. On the way down, SC falls and hits her knee on a root. I slip on a rock and go down for what I believe is the 7th time on the trail. After we get picked up, we go back to the cabin where we are staying. After dinner SC and I go to the grocery store to pick up a few more food items, and then we all head to some sort of highway department area to watch for moose. Unfortunately, we don’t see any and go back to the cabin, a little disappointed.","Caribou Valley Road, Carrabassett Valley, ME

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621555,"I was up early and took a final shower before we leave. While SC’s Dad takes our trash from the last 3 days to the transfer station, I drop off a resupply package at a hostel nearby. It will take us about a week to get back here. 
In Monson, we stop by an outfitters where SC gets a pair of her own gaiters. She borrowed mine in the 100MW and is excited to have her own with a tie-dye pattern. 
We get to the trailhead, take some pictures, and start hiking south just before 11am. We only have 9 miles to the first lean-to. At first we see a bunch of hikers and then there are none. 
We do ford a river today: the East Branch of the Piscataquis River. Otherwise, it was a fairly unremarkable hike. There is one other person at the lean-to: a nobo section hiker out for the ~35 miles from Caratunk to Monson.","ME Route 15, Monson, ME/Carrabassett Valley, ME

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621556,"I slept well last night. There was the steady noise of the river at the bottom of the hill, but otherwise it was a quiet night. 
I woke up at my usual 5am, but it was darker than I expected. I went to the privy and while I was there, it started to rain. No wonder it was dark. 
I decided to go ahead and wake up SC at 6:40. The section hiker had already left. The rain had been brief and light, and I started hiking about 7. SC passed me about 2 miles in. 
Today we crossed the West Branch of the Piscataquis River. Unlike yesterday’s uneventful ford of the East Branch, SC and I took different routes. SC went for deep but short. I went for long but shallow. Apparently she chose correctly because she made it across without incident while I slipped on a rock and fell in. (For those of you following along at home, this is fall #8.) I immediately jumped back up. Later, SC remarked on my “recovery.” I was just thinking, “I must keep my sleeping bag dry!” I still don’t know why I let Spike’s Dad talk me into a 15L drawstring sack rather than a 20L roll top one. 
Anyway, I left the river significantly wetter than when I went in. Fortunately it was no longer raining and it wasn’t particularly cold. We had several other water crossings but they did not involve fording and no one fell in. 
Today’s hike was mostly flat until we were just a couple of miles from the lean-to. It was there that we climbed up Moxie Bald Mountain. It was back to raining off and on, and we could see a rainbow at the top. 
It was downhill to the lean-to, and there was room, so SC and I set up inside. However, the sleeping deck for this one is bouncy, which could make for an interesting night.","Horseshoe Canyon Lean-To (ME)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621557,"It rained though most of the night, so I was glad we were in the lean-to even though every time someone rolled over, it shook the whole place. I woke up at 4:45, got up at 5:15, woke SC up at 6:40, and started hiking about 7:15. 
I stopped about 2.5 miles in to get water where a stream met a pond. I was sitting on a dock when a familiar-looking nobo walked by. She kinda looked at me and started to pass, and then she came back and said, “Are you Spike’s Mom?” I recognized her from the shelter we stayed at back on Day 7! We caught up a little and then I could hear her talking to SC who had just arrived. It was fun seeing someone from so early in our hike who also recognized us. 
Today we had to cross Pleasant Pond Mountain on our way to Caratunk, ME. It wasn’t a particularly difficult climb, but it was one where it wasn’t clear if you would ever get to the top because every time we went up, we came back down again. Eventually we did get to the top and were treated with some gorgeous views. SC kept stopping to pick blueberries, so I was able to keep up with her. 
Several people noticed Spike today. I sometimes remembered to tell them that it was his birthday. One guy asked me if he was 1. He’s actually 23!
At the next lean-to, I told SC to go ahead and go into Caratunk, buy me a milkshake (according to the guides, they only had shakes until 4pm and I didn’t think I could make it by then), and see if there was any room in the hostel. 
I pushed hard the next 5.7 miles and made it to the hostel about 4:45.  There was a milkshake waiting in the freezer for me. It wasn’t the most amazing shake I had ever had, but after pushing that hard and long, it hit the spot. Also, when SC had arrived the hostel was full, but they had recently had a cancellation for a room with a double bed.
We took it, and then got a ride to a restaurant where we both got burgers. They kept getting our order wrong. First they brought SC a blueberry ale rather than the blueberry soda she had ordered. I drank it to keep it from going to waste. Then I had ordered sweet potato fries with my burger and it came with regular ones instead, so I ended up with both. Even though SC helped with both sets of my fries, we still had regular fries left over at the end. 
We went back to the hostel and got showers. I noticed when I went to shower that I had a large bruise on my left side. It must have happened when I fell in the river yesterday. Fortunately, it doesn’t bother me and it’s in a place where my pack won’t make it worse. Now we get to sleep in a real bed.","Bald Mountain Brook Lean-To (ME)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621558,"I slept in until 5:25! I got up, used the bathroom, and then got back into bed and posted some entries to the blog. Just before 7 we heard breakfast was almost ready, so we headed downstairs for that. There are so many comments on Guthook about the milkshakes here, but breakfast was amazing, particularly the fried potatoes. I didn’t have the French toast or the blueberry muffins and still came away very satisfied. It probably is because of the ferry schedule which has sobos staying in Caratunk and nobos getting milkshakes and moving on, but more on that in a minute. 
Next it was time to pack up. We weren’t in much of a hurry because today we were crossing the Kennebec River which requires a ferry ride. The ferry is a canoe and operates at this time of the year 9am to 2pm.
We packed our bags and then checked out of the hostel. They had a scale to weigh your pack. Mine came in at 33.22 pounds with 2 liters of water and a 4 day supply of food. That’s not terrible. 
We left the hostel and walked to the ferry. The operator was just getting set up. We were the only ones on the “north” side of the river, so we got to go first. Spike got to ride on the bow of the boat for a little while. It was a fairly short ride, but I’m glad to not have to ford this river! 

The trail today started out following a stream. There were several waterfalls and the trail was rolling. At Pierce Pond, the trail seemed to be on top of a makeshift dam. We stopped at the lean-to there to register and have a snack.
After that, the trail used lots of bog boards. They are boards they put through swampy or muddy places to keep your shoes out of the mire and protect the wetlands. They are made out of wood and can be very slick. I was about .2 from the lean-to where we were staying tonight, walking on a bog board when, BAM, I’m flat on my face. This is fall #9. I’m not exactly sure what happened, but I somehow got my foot wedged between 2 boards, and it took some time to extricate myself from them. I don’t know how I came away without an injury.
We are staying in the shelter tonight with a couple of guys we met this morning at breakfast. They are also sobos. There are also a couple of nobos here.","Caratunk, ME

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621559,"Today seemed like it lasted forever. We got going at our usual time and the trail was fairly flat. At one point, a line of 6 guys passed. I got off trail to let them by, and one of them said, “Nobo vortex train, coming through” and then followed with a train whistle sound. 
Eventually we had to climb Little Bigelow. A family out for a day hike passed me, but they didn’t have as much stuff and it seemed like this is something they do often. However, my pace went down and I could barely do 1mph. 
By the time I got to the campsite, it was 6pm. Even though I started 2 hours earlier and had done 1.4 miles less than yesterday, I only got in an hour earlier. Today was only Little Bigelow; tomorrow we have the “big” Bigelows. The hostel we are staying with has pick ups at 1 and 4:30pm. Even though we are doing shorter miles, I don’t know if I can make the pick up time. Then a couple comes in at 7. They are also doing a flip-flop hike and are currently nobo. I asked them where they started today and they only did about 8 miles. I almost start freaking out. It doesn’t help that the weather report has rain in the forecast. 
SC sees that I’m worried and tries to tell me, “ We got this.” I have service, so I call Spike’s Dad. I’m trying to tell myself that I can always pay a little more for a late pickup. It’s not working.","West Carry Pond Lean-To (ME)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621560,"As you might imagine, I didn’t sleep well last night. I also woke up when someone came into the campsite at 1:40am. I woke up about 4:30 and I have service so I check the weather. It’s supposed to start raining at 5am and continue until 11:30. I use the privy and then wake SC up at 5am. I tell her that if we pack up and leave now, she won’t have to carry a wet tent. 
It started raining as we were packing. We could hear a few others nearby also getting an early start. We were on the trail about 5:40. Just after 6, we heard thunder, so we took refuge under a huge rock for 20 minutes. 
Our first summit was Avery Peak of Bigelow Mountain. It was 2 miles in and had taken us nearly 3 hours. There was absolutely no view, so we took a picture with the summit sign and kept going. 
Next was the West Peak, which was higher than Avery, but we had to go down before going up. The down was difficult. It was pretty much just climbing down a vertical boulder field in the rain. But then there was a flat spot that actually had dirt to walk on and the climb up West Peak wasn’t too bad. As we got near the tree line, we passed a couple of hikers coming down who warned us it was windy at the top. And they were right! It was the most wind I have experienced on trail. I thought it might whip our packcovers off. I got a picture of SC at the sign. I didn’t get all the way up because of the wind. 
Coming down from West Peak wasn’t as steep and rocky as Avery. The wind did make things interesting and it was hard to find the trail sometimes in the clouds. 
Finally we had the South Horn. By the time we got here, the rain had mostly stopped. There were still no views, though. 
We stopped to have lunch at the Horns Pond Lean-Tos. We had completed 5.5 miles and it had taken us 6 hours. I texted the hostel to let them know we would be there tonight, but we might have to call for a later shuttle. We had 5.1 miles to go and 4 hours to do it. 

The first hour after lunch I managed to go one mile. It was rugged terrain and constantly going down hurt my knees. However, then it finally leveled off, and I did the last 4 miles in 2.5 hours.
When we reached the parking lot, a trail angel was there with cold drinks and cookies. All she wanted was for us to sign her book and take a picture of us. As I was sitting there enjoying my Gatorade, a truck comes by and asks if we are going to Hostel of Maine. We are, so we jump in the bed and we’re off! I don’t remember the last time I rode in a truck bed, but I must be getting old because it is a lot scarier than I remembered. We were on a highway going highway speeds, and every little bump we hit seemed to have the possibility of launching us into the air. Still we managed to arrive safely.

The hostel is full and there are people we know here. Not only have we caught back up with our friend from the 100MW, we ran into a guy we had hiked with near Glasgow, VA! At the hostel we found loaner clothes, took showers, and then walked over to an Italian restaurant just down the road. It was great.

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621561,"I didn’t sleep well last night. I woke up at 1:30 and didn’t get back to sleep after that. I did have a dream that the hostel had washed my shoes, and the shoes ended up in even worse shape than they already are. 
I finally got up at 5:30 and sat in the common room in a big comfy chair. I journaled and watched videos until breakfast was served just before 7. I had homemade granola, bananas, and a hard boiled egg. 
We only had 5.2 miles to do today, so I was in no hurry to leave, especially after how hard we had pushed yesterday. Plus it was raining but supposed to clear up in the afternoon. The latest shuttle we could take was at 10, and we were back on the trail hiking just before 11am.
Because last Saturday we hiked from Caribou Valley Road to ME 27, today we started at Caribou Valley and headed south. 

There was some elevation we would do today, but I wasn’t concerned. I hadn’t heard any horror stories about this stretch, and we were not summitting any 4,000 foot peaks. However, today I came close to quitting.
The trail started off nicely enough. We were following the contour of this hill, slowly gaining elevation. But then, without warning, we turned and went straight uphill. Early on, there was a 50’ section that was basically rock climbing. It wasn’t clear which way to go except up. I would climb a little on the right side and then reach a dead end. The left side would look better so I would move horizontally over there, climb a little bit, and then get stuck again. I don’t know how many times I moved from one side to the other, but it was too many for such a short stretch. As I got to the top, a nobo was coming down. I told him, “I wish you could have seen me climb this so you could see where not to go.”
A little while later, I get to a 4’ vertical step. In case you didn’t know, my legs are too short for a 4’ step. I looked at this step for a full minute trying to figure out how to get up. I finally figured out a way up and did some sort of weird maneuver where I became horizontal by hanging on to a tree with my hands. Anyway, I get up this step and hear a man and woman coming up behind me. I figured I had some time while they figured out the step, and then next thing I knew, they were right behind me. 
“How did you figure out that step so quickly?” I asked the woman. 
“It helps that I’m just out here for the day,” she answered while motioning to her tiny pack. 
I let them pass me, and then resumed my climb. However, I then hear the woman say, “Should I take off my pack and pass it up to you?” My heart sank. If this woman who clearly spends her weekends peak bagging and is wearing a tiny pack is having trouble, then what am I going to do?
I get to the next step. This one isn’t 4’, it’s 10’. I’m looking everywhere for footholds or handholds. I’m hundreds of feet up the mountain now. It’s cloudy and I can’t see much, but it’s clear that falling would not end well. How is this a trail? I didn’t sign up for rock climbing! Eventually I figure out a way up that large step and a few more that followed. When I finally catch up with SC, I am almost in tears, but they come out as laughter instead. It took me nearly 2 hours to do one mile of “trail.”
After that, the trail became more trail-like. There was another climb, but not nearly as demoralizing as the first one. We got to the lean-to and there were already a 2 hikers set up inside. As we start getting set up ourselves, 4 section hikers arrive. However, only one is interested in staying in the shelter. We end up with 6 people in a 6-person lean-to. A sobo section hiker we saw at the hostel is incredulous. “How did you get here before me?” he wants to know. We explain that we had already completed the Crockers last weekend. 
Anyway, it’s supposed to rain tonight, so I’m glad we are in the lean-to.","Caribou Valley Road, Carrabassett Valley, ME

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621562,"It rained most of the night. At one point I heard one of the guys in the lean-to get up. I thought maybe it was 4am, and he was an early riser. I fell back asleep and dreamed that I went to the Y (what’s with the Y dreams recently?) to go swimming. I got in and used my last, free guest pass. I then realized I didn’t look at the swim schedule before going. There were 2 pools, and the one for lap swimming was full. They were short lifeguards, so I filled in. I recognized some of the swimmers as hikers and they told me hikers got in free, so now I’m upset that I wasted a guest pass. People were starting to get out of the pool, so I went to get in but a manager told me that the pool was now closed so they could have swim lessons. 
I woke up and looked at the time. It was 3:25. Certainly that hiker hadn’t left *that* early. I fell asleep again. When I woke up I just lay there. I didn’t want to be the first one up. Then I heard someone’s alarm for 5. I stayed in sleeping bag through them snoozing the alarm 2 more times and then got up. This was practically sleeping in! 
When we finally got going, we started off downhill. It seemed like we would never reach the bottom. When we did get there, we had a stream to cross. SC went to the middle of the stream on rocks, stood there for a while, and then came back. There was one place where she would have to jump and she didn’t trust that she could jump that far on these rocks while wearing a pack. Well, if she’s not confident that she can, I’m confident that I can’t. I take my pack off and put on my camp shoes in order to ford the stream. Meanwhile, we keep seeing nobos cross without problems. However, if you cross nobo, you have a better angle on a slanted rock, so they don’t have to jump. It does feel good to soak my feet in the cold water. 
After the stream, it is uphill to the lean-to. We get there early and have the time and energy to go to the next campsite, but it’s supposed to rain again tonight. The guys we had stayed with each night between Caratunk and Stratton have caught back up with us and are staying here tonight.

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621967,"It did in fact rain basically all night. It might have even hailed. I had a dream that I was around a bunch of people. One person would make these weird, loud noises while breathing. I would get one person to stop, and someone else would start doing it. I woke up and realized the guy next to me was snoring. I woke him up, and he stopped for the rest of the night. 
It was another slow morning with everything being wet. We started about 7:30 and climbed up and over Saddleback Junior. It was pretty cloudy. While there were some views, we couldn’t see Saddleback senior to see where we were going. 
Between Saddleback Junior and the Horn, we went down to where the campsite we could have stayed last night. I fell on the way down, having slipped on a wet rock. I was concerned about going over the rest of the Saddlebacks because the trail was above tree line for 3 miles and an earlier weather report forecasted thunderstorms. We didn’t have any service, so we went ahead and went up to the tree line. SC had service here. Her weather app was saying that the storms were unlikely before 4pm. We decided we would be able to get over the Saddlebacks before the thunderstorms started. 
It was not long before we hit the Horn. We could look one way and see the top of Saddleback Junior and the trail we had come down, and look the other way and see the entire trail where in went down from the Horn and up to the summit of Saddleback Mountain. You could see hikers coming from perhaps a mile away. 
I had gone down the Horn and had started up Saddleback proper, clouds started to roll in from the east. I thought they would completely obscure the trail, but the trail appeared to be a boundary line of sorts. It was completely cloudy to the east, while the west remained clear. 
After a long climb, I got to what I thought was the top of Saddleback, but it was a false summit. Fortunately, it was clear and I could see the actual summit ahead. When I reached the summit, I sat down to talk to SC, drink some water, and have a snack. However, a large gray cloud appeared to be forming to the southwest, so we got moving again. 

The next mile was all above tree line. I’m glad threatening weather wasn’t immediate because that could be scary being so exposed. However, because it wasn’t, we had a nice walk across the mostly flat alpine area.
When I got to tree line, I checked my phone and I had service so I checked the weather. My app was saying thunderstorms from 4:30 to 8:30. It’s 3 miles to the shelter and depending on terrain, we should be able to make it there before it storms. 
Not long after I check the weather, I have my second fall of the day. I stepped on a loose rock and then slid, landing on my hind end. No damage done, though. It was a long, tedious climb down. At one point there was a ladder and at another point, rebar steps in the rocks. Where were these on our way up Sugarloaf? However, even with these aids, I managed to fall for the third time today, 12th of the trail. This time I tripped over a root. 
I was going slowly down the mountain, about 1mph. I got to a nice little spot overlooking a pond, so stopped to rest, have a snack, and get some water. I’m about to leave and walk the .8 miles to the lean-to, when I look up at the sky and notice it is getting dark. I take a few more minutes to put on my pack cover. 
Shortly after I started hiking, a thunderstorm rolled through. Fortunately, it only lasted a few minutes and I was no longer on the top of a mountain where I could be in danger of a lightning strike. The trail was also easier. It even had switchbacks(!), which we haven’t seen since we flipped. 
By the time I got to the lean-to, the rain had stopped and the sun was out. SC and a sobo we’ve stayed with last couple of nights was there. A little later a couple of nobos stopped by. The woman decided to push on to a campsite in 2 miles, while the guy stayed with us. I wonder if this is the first time he’s been this outnumbered by sobos. 
This is a nice area to stay in. The water source isn’t very far away and has a place where it is easy to fill up a filter. The lean-to has skylights, so it is bright inside when the sun is out. There are tons of tent sites and some newer-looking tent platforms. There’s supposed to be a caretaker for the area, but we’ve not seen any sign of them. We did less than 9 miles today and I got in before 5pm, but this is a great place to stay after a 3-fall day.","Poplar Ridge Lean-To (ME)

I dreamed that I was trying to meet up with a friend from college, but I was having trouble because I also had to watch a group of middle school students. If you’re wondering why I share my dreams, it’s because I’ve been remembering them lately. I am interested in if I can make some meaning of them when I get done.

I am able to keep pace with him until the trail starts to go down. Then my thighs start complaining that they did too much downhill yesterday. Anyway, we talk for a while and he says he’s going to the road to meet a friend. When we get to the road, we know the friend. He’s a guy who has been slack packing the trail, but his support crew had to go home, so he’s going to start backpacking the trail. Anyway, we stop by his truck for about 30 minutes and have some drinks and offload our trash. They are taking the rest of the day off, so they will be somewhere behind us for a while. 
After we leave, we see a guy I’m 99% sure passed us on our first day. We stop and talk to a trail maintainer. We’re the 23rd and 24th hikers he’s seen today. He said the most he had seen in a day while out this summer is 18. He comments that he hasn’t seen as many women as usual. We really haven’t seen that many either since we came to Maine. 
While we didn’t have any significant climbs today, the trail was full of what SC calls spaghetti and meatballs, that is, roots and rocks. It takes a lot of mental energy to figure out where to put your foot with every step. We saw a lot of survey tape today where they marked out where the trail will be improved for future hikers. 
We got to the lean-to about 4:30. There’s a few guys tenting and a nobo thru-hiker sharing the lean-to with us. The pond is clear, but SC saw leeches, so I am limiting my exposure to it.","Piazza Rock Lean-To (ME)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621971,"I slept reasonably well last night. I did have a dream that my parents were looking for a new house because theirs had disappeared. Where their house had been was just an empty grass lot with a mailbox. They were looking at other houses in their neighborhood.  I went in to see one but it looked like no one had lived there in 30 years. The decor was out of date, there were huge cracks in the walls, and it was filled with snakes. 
I slept well last night and got out of camp around 7:15. The last time I had service, my weather app had forecast rain from 2pm today until 4am tomorrow, so we were just going to the next lean-to so we wouldn’t have to sleep in the rain. 
Around 10am I hear something in the woods. I look and see a cow moose eating vegetation. I then hear nobo trekking poles. 2 young women are hiking towards me and they have their earbuds in. I try to get their attention with a loud whisper, “Hey, guys, a moose!” They see me and then the moose. We’re all taking pictures and I hear something else and see more brown fur. “There’s another one!” It’s not one but 2 calves! The 3 of them just stand together eating while we take pictures. Eventually, I hike on. SC was waiting for me at the next road, and she was disappointed she missed them. 

The first road we cross is ME Route 17. There’s a beautiful view there and a bench. We walk along the road for a little while and someone has covered the guardrail with stickers. The trail goes down from there, crosses a stream, and then follows a gravel road for a while. There’s a parking spot for 2-3 cars where the trail goes back into the woods, and today there’s trail magic! There are chairs, benches, and a cooler with food. SC and I each have a soda and a bag of carrots. She also has a chocolate covered devil dog. Then someone comes up in an ATV and drops off a can of Campbell’s Chunky soup. It was 18 oz and only had 260 calories, and SC decides to take it!
Now that we’ve had a nice break and enjoyed some trail magic, it’s time to make our final push for the lean-to. I look at the water situation and realize that the stream we passed .2 miles ago was the last water source until the lean-to, and the source at the lean-to is unreliable. We leave our packs by the road and go back to get water.
Finally, we head up the mountain. We climb Bemis First Peak and then Second Peak. The climb is up slanted rock. Uphill is generally easier than downhill for not hurting one’s knees and not slipping and falling. This is particularly true on slanted rock like this, so I’m glad to be going uphill. Every once in a while, I turn around to take in the view that gets better as I climb higher. I also take my time and stop to eat the blueberries. The mountain is covered in blueberry bushes, and we appear to be in peak blueberry season. 
I am not in any rush to get to the lean-to because I know I’ll get there early, and there’s no more lean-tos between here and the next road, an additional 8.7 miles. I’m about a quarter mile away when it starts to sprinkle. I’m tempted to just keep walking, but I figure I might get caught in a sudden downpour, so I stop to put on my packcover. Next thing I know, I make it to the lean-to. There’s several nobos who have just come from town. They stayed at different hostels, and they are making their cases to SC for which hostel we should stay at while we are in town. It’s kinda funny to hear them argue about which hostel is better. I’m happy to hear that we should have a good experience wherever we land. 
At 4:30, a sobo section hiker shows up. He appears to be the last person coming in, at least I hope so. It’s 6:30pm and we are all tucked in. Looks like an early bedtime. It’s been raining off and on since I got to the lean-to.","Sabbath Day Pond Lean-To (ME)
",Bemis Mountain Lean-To (ME),"Aug 21, Wed",8.30
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622211,"It rained most of the night. I remember 2 dreams I had. In the first one, I was recovering from a stroke and was prescribed marijuana. It was supposed to keep my brain more open to healing or something like that. Anyway, people could smell me coming. 
In the next one, I was working at a private practice where I had worked prior to coming out on the trail. I only had one client, and we were meeting in a some sort of storage facility because the office was being remodeled. I went over to the office to see how the remodel was coming. It looked like nearly no progress had been made. 
I woke up at 4:45 and one of the nobos is up getting ready. He didn’t have a headlamp on and was doing everything by touch! I got up at 5, went to the bathroom, and then started breakfast. The one guy left at 5:30, and the others started getting up around 6. 
While it had stopped raining about 3am, it was overcast and wet. I started the day with my packcover on because it seemed like it might rain at any point and because the trees were wet. The lack of sunshine made it hard to get going.  Plus, we only had to go 8.7 miles to get to the road into town. 
While we went over 2 of the Bemis peaks yesterday, we still had the main peak to summit today. However, we had stayed just below the summit last night, so we didn’t have much further to go. The main peak didn’t have the views yesterday’s peaks had. I was hoping to have service on top to figure out where we were staying in town, but didn’t have anything on Bemis. 
We went down a little and then back up again to Old Blue Mountain. Here I had service! I agreed to call a hostel, but had SC decide which one I was calling. She decided that we should call the one closer to town. I called and they were expecting a trail celebrity to come this afternoon and were not sure how many would be in his entourage, so they didn’t know if they’d have room. I called the other hostel and they just said, “Be at the road by 4pm.”
We only had 2.8 miles and they would be downhill, but it’s hard telling how long those miles would take. I left at 1pm hoping it wouldn’t be rock climbing like it was down the Saddlebacks. 
I got to the road at 3pm, not too far behind SC. I took off my wet shoes and socks and laid them out to dry in the sun which was now shining. A nobo slack packer came out of the woods from the other direction and said she was also staying at the same hostel. A few minutes later, the shuttle for the hostel drives up. “I figured you guys would be here,” he says, and we leave for the hostel 30 minutes early. 

This hostel is outside of town, so the driver stops in town so that we can pick up anything we need. We go into a convenience store and I’m tired and can’t figure out what to get. I end up with a bag of chips and some cheese. The hostel serves dinner, and tonight it’s pizza, which I can’t have. They also do all you can eat pancakes for breakfast. I don’t know if they’ll have anything I’ll be able to eat.
We get to the hostel and get a tour. SC and I are on separate futons in the loft. She liked her pizza and I had a couple of Klondike bars in addition to my chips and cheese. We’re slack packing tomorrow and I only have a few snacks to get me through the day. Hopefully I will be better able to navigate the convenience store tomorrow.","Bemis Mountain Lean-To (ME)
","South Arm Road, Andover, ME","Aug 22, Thu",8.70
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622212,"I slept okay last night. I was awake for a while in the middle of the night because someone got up and slammed a bunch of doors at 1:45am. 
SC had pancakes for breakfast and I finished my chips and cheese. We got in the first shuttle to go slack packing. There is a group of 12 hikers here who have been hiking together for some time, and they are hiking north, so we are doing the same hike because it was easier for the hostel. 
We get started just after 8:30. There are a few hikers getting dropped off by another hostel. I hike with a woman probably about 25 years older than me and am able to keep up with her up the first hill and down the first hill, but when we start up the second hill, I wish her a good hike. “Oh, you’ll see me again,” she assured me. “I take lots of breaks.” I didn’t see her again. 

The first 4 miles are primarily uphill to the top of Wyman Mountain. It’s a nice, gentle climb. SC and I stop at Hall Mountain Lean-To. Then it is down to Sawyer Brook. There’s one more mountain and the elevation profile looks steeper than Wyman. The climb up is steep but not too steep. I get to the top of this mountain, Moody, about 3pm. I am feeling moody myself. The shuttle driver had said we should be done with the hike about 1. I was still coming down Wyman at that time. Fortunately, they have another shuttle coming at 4pm.
As I’m on top of Moody, I take a look at Guthook to see when the Andover post office is open because we have a package waiting. Guthook shows that it closes at 4:15(!) and has no hours listed for Saturdays. I start to get a little panicked. Yesterday the shuttle showed up at 3:30. Maybe he’ll be early today too. 

The climb down Moody is steep but it has rock stairs in a lot of places, which makes the downhill easier. When we are almost to the road, suddenly there’s a privy! I hadn’t realized there was an established campsite there when we got picked up here yesterday. SC is at the campsite enjoying some trail magic, and I let her know I’m headed to the road in case the shuttle comes early.
I get to the road about 3:40 and do what I can to be ready to jump in the shuttle like collapse my trekking poles and have my “wallet” out. SC is there a few minutes later joined by a couple of others who will be joining us at the hostel. One is a nobo with a hurt ankle. The other is our friend from the 100MW, Sidewinder! We had last seen him at the last hostel we stayed at a week ago. He’s still 10 miles behind us but he should be able to make that up tomorrow when we take a short day. I check with Sidewinder and the nobo and ask if it’s okay if we go straight to the post office and try to get there before it closes. They say they are good with that. 
The shuttle driver gets there maybe 2 minutes before 4pm. I ask him if there’s any way we could get to the post office before it closes. He says maybe, but he then keeps forgetting he’s trying to go fast. We get to town about 4:13 and pull up to the post office at 4:14. I jump out of the car and sprint to the door. The woman running the post office is coming out to lock the door. “I’m closed,” she tells me, “and I don’t get paid for overtime.” There’s something in her tone that just hurts. Here I am, having tried to do everything I could to get there on time, adrenaline all spiked, and she can’t even see what it is that I need? Anyway, I walk away and break down crying.

The shuttle driver takes us to the convenience store while he goes to pick up hikers from the other trailhead. I stand in the store crying, so SC and the nobo give me a group hug. I feel a little better and then I find the protein bar section of the store. They actually carry some that I’m not allergic to. I pick up a couple for breakfast. Tonight they are serving hamburgers at the hostel, so at least I can have that.
It takes a while for the hostel driver to return from the other trailhead and then those hikers are let out at the convenience store so they can go shopping. It seems like forever before we get back to the hostel.
We’ve been moved from our futons in the loft to bunks in the bunk room. I’m fine with this because it should be darker and cooler in the bunk room.
Anyway, after putting in my hamburger order, I go out to the back deck and call Spike’s Dad. I cry some more. I think several things came together today. 1. We were hiking north and so it was more clear than usual how slow I am because of all the people passing me. 2. I haven’t eaten much the last few days. 3. Rushing to get to the post office only to get there right as it was closing and getting no compassion from the woman there. 
I’ve now eaten and am in bed. I just had to ask a guy to leave because he was on a video call with his family in the bunk room. There are signs everywhere saying that the bunk room is a quiet room for sleeping only. Apparently he was doing this out by the TV and was distracting everyone and they asked him to go somewhere else, so instead of going outside, he came into the bunk room?! Fortunately, Sidewinder backed me up when I said something. However, now I’m in bed angry at the post office lady and the guy on the phone. I hope I can sleep.","East B Hill Road, Andover, ME

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622213,"I got to sleep ok last night and then woke up at 3am. I decided to get up at 5 and take a shower. When I got here on Thursday, I used the indoor shower because they were doing work on the outside ones, so this morning I took an outdoor shower. My indoor shower was cold. This one the temperature would swing from hot to cold without warning. Fortunately, I was able to end the shower when it was warm. 
As we were were packing up to leave, I decided to look to see what AWOL’s guide had for the post office’s hours. He showed they were open Saturday mornings! I then checked Google Maps and it also said the post office would be open this morning! I should be able to pick up our package today and not have to worry about forwarding it to another place!
While everyone else ate pancakes, I talked to Spike’s grandparents on the phone. My Mom’s birthday was earlier this week, and I didn’t have service to call her at the time. 
Anyway, SC and I got a ride on the shuttle into town at 8am. Given the lack of wheat-free foods, distance from town, and lack of hot showers, I didn’t love the hostel, but it easily has made SC’s top 3.
We dropped our packs off on the porch of the Little Red Hen and went inside for a real breakfast. I ordered “Sarah’s Sensation”: an open faced omelet with corned beef hash, steak, potatoes, grilled onions and peppers, and cheese. It was exactly what I wanted and needed. I heard some locals in the restaurant talking about someone being a “miserable human being,” and I knew they were talking about the woman at the post office before they even mentioned her job. 
After breakfast, we went to the post office and picked up the package. It took all of 45 seconds. Really, we couldn’t have done this yesterday? I’m sure she’s had a hard life and it’s probably hard to find someone to run a post office in rural Maine. 
Back on the Little Red Hen porch, we unpacked the box and divided up the food. As we were doing this, we found 4 monarch chrysalises on the porch. This is the first time I’ve seen chrysalises in the wild! This day was continuing to get better and better. 
Now that we knew what food we had in our box, we went to the 2 convenience stores in town to do the rest of our resupply. This should get us to Gorham, NH where there is a Walmart! I’ve never looked forward to a Walmart so much in my life. 
Back to the porch where we take our food out of the packaging and divide it up. We then go back into the restaurant to get ice cream and Clif bars for SC. After we’ve paid, we ask about a ride to the trail. They have just hit a lull in their busy Saturday morning, so a guy who appears to be the owner or at least manager gives us a ride. I tell him how much I enjoyed Sarah’s Sensation, and apparently Sarah is his daughter!
He drops us off at the trail and we’re hiking. I’ve only planned for us to go to the next lean-to, 4.5 miles. We take our time and walk together. We haven’t done much hiking together recently because SC is so much faster than I am. This is nice to have a chance to really talk. Just a mile in we run into a couple of guys we met our second week on trail. 
We get to the lean-to before 4pm. The next lean-to is only another 3.5 miles, but it does involve hiking over a mountain. Eventually Sidewinder shows up. He did the 10 miles we slack packed yesterday and then the 4.5 from the road we did today. We hope we get to hike with him for a little while. 

There are some friendly nobos here. They are all tenting, but came over to the lean-to to make dinner and talk. There’s also a college orientation group that has taken over the main tent sites. They appear to be from Harvard, and they don’t appear to understand how to close the privy when they’re done using it. The signs that say, “Latch the door or porcupines will eat the building” are funny, but based on how many teeth marks there are on privies around here, they speak truth.
Today was a good reset after my bad day yesterday.","East B Hill Road, Andover, ME
",Frye Notch Lean-To (ME),"Aug 24, Sat",4.50
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622214,"Last night I could hear the Harvard group as I went to bed, but I fell asleep quickly. Sidewinder had a harder time and actually told them to keep it down twice. When I got up this morning to use the privy, the door was wide open and the lid was up. I’m wondering if I should contact the person in charge of outdoor orientation to tell them about these problems. I’m actually wondering the reason they send students out to the Appalachian Trail in Maine when there are plenty of places that are not as heavily traveled and closer to Cambridge. 

This morning it was cold when I got up. It seems like it is so hard to move when it gets cold. More tents had appeared while we were sleeping.
Today our first challenge was the Baldpates. The initial climb up reminded me of Bemis, and the trail between East and West peaks reminded me of the Saddlebacks. 
Just after the Baldpates, we stopped by our last lean-to. From here on out, they are all shelters. We have left the Maine Appalachian Trail Club (MATC) and have entered the Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC), or as I’ve heard it referred to several times already, the Appalachian Money Club. 
As we get close to Grafton Notch, we start to encounter lots of day hikers. We cross the road and come upon a parking lot. And what is that? Could it be? Yes, it is, trail magic! By the welcome kiosk are boxes of pastries, a huge bag of Snickers bars, and 4 large containers of cherry tomatoes. Then there’s a cooler with sodas, salads, and yogurt. I take a salad and a soda. The salad has spinach, hard boiled eggs, almonds, cranberries, cheese, and dressing. It also comes with a fork! When I’m done with the salad, I fill up my salad bowl with some tomatoes. This is probably my favorite trail magic I’ve received so far.
Now that we’ve been refreshed by the wonderful trail magic, it’s time to hike up and over another mountain. Sidewinder takes the Eyebrow Trail because it’s longer and more scenic than the AT. However, when he gets back to the AT he turns the wrong way. Fortunately he didn’t go too far before running into SC and getting pointed in the right direction. He and SC decide to take the .3mile side trail to the summit of Old Speck Mountain. I am content just hike the AT, and I’m going to be late enough without adding another .6 miles to my day.
SC goes up Old Speck, climbs the fire tower (she said it wasn’t very tall), and still beats me to the shelter. This is our first AMC shelter and it has a caretaker and you have to pay to stay. I make dinner and then pay the caretaker while the food rehydrates. We eat dinner by headlamp, and then I have to set up in the dark. There is a woman here we met on our first day on the trail.","Frye Notch Lean-To (ME)
",Speck Pond Shelter (ME),"Aug 25, Sun",10.40
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622215,"I didn’t sleep particularly well last night. I had a dream that I was at a camp that had imported tigers to roam free around the camp. I tried to tell them it wasn’t going to work out well for them. 
We used a space blanket (a big piece of Mylar) last night under our sleeping pads and it worked great. It was another cold morning. I was cold until I was hiking for a while. 
SC and I stopped at the top of the Mahoosuc Arm, .9 miles from the shelter. I needed to get something from my pack and I realized, Spike’s not with me! I know exactly where I left him. I took a picture of him this morning at the shelter. SC volunteers to go get him as she knows she is faster. She leaves her pack and heads back to the shelter. 
A few minutes later I hear her talking to Sidewinder. We left before him and he saw Spike and picked him up! He even took pictures of Spike doing things like climbing a ladder. I’m so glad no one had to go all the way back!
Today is supposed to be one of the most difficult. I have only planned for us to do a little over 5 miles because of this. In the last lean-to there was an entry in the log by Firsure that said, “It’s Notch gonna be a cakewalk,” and “If Notch now, then when? If Notch you, then Mahoosuc?” SC says we’re going to hike together today, but going down the Mahoosuc Arm, she and Sidewinder quickly pull ahead. The Arm is 1500’ of descent in 1 mile. Anything over 700’ per mile tends to be slow and difficult. Lots of nobos have warned us about how difficult the Arm is. However, it isn’t as bad as they made it sound. It was a lot easier than coming down Katahdin. 
After the Arm is the Notch. SC and Sidewinder are waiting for me before starting. We meet up with a family with 2 boys ages 13 & 15. The 15 year old completed the Notch in 30 minutes. The Notch is 1 mile long. It took the woman we  saw at the shelter last night and had met on our first day 4.5 hours.

The Mahoosuc Notch is a valley filled with large boulders. It is considered the toughest mile of the AT. We put our trekking poles away and start climbing. SC and Sidewinder have me go first so that I can set the pace. I think about what I was told by a nobo and try to go up and over whenever possible. Maybe .2 in, we come across an orientation group from Tufts. One of the women in the group says, “I signed up for Level 2: no previous outdoor experience!” We are trying to figure out what Level 1 would be: I’ve spent the last 18 years of my life playing video games indoors?
Halfway through the Notch, SC and I pause to take a picture in celebration of reaching 1000 miles. We still are not halfway through the trail though. 
It ends up taking us about 3.5 hours to do the Notch. It was fun. We took pictures and videos and laughed and joked with one another. At the end we sit, rest, and have some snacks. The 15 year old couldn’t figure out how to get his trekking poles to collapse, so his dad had told him just to leave them. Now Sidewinder has new poles!

There’s only 1.6 miles to the shelter but there’s another mountain to climb. This one is called Fulling Mill. Maybe because I am spent from the Notch, but this climb seems more difficult than the descent from the Arm. It is a lot of climbing where I have to find hand holds and pull myself up. It’s nothing I haven’t done before, I’m just so tired.
I get to the shelter at a reasonable time. I am able to set up and cook dinner before 6pm. Also before 6pm, a section hiker is snoring in the shelter.","Speck Pond Shelter (ME)
",Full Goose Shelter (ME),"Aug 26, Mon",5.10
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622216,"Last night I knew snoring was going to be an issue, so I put in my earplugs, put on my hat, pulled my hat down over my ears and eyes, got into my sleeping bag, and pulled my bag around my face so only my mouth and nose were uncovered. I remember thinking, I can still hear the snoring, but I soon fell asleep. I woke up at 1:15 and had to pee, but I tucked myself back in and went right back to sleep. 
I got up a little after 5am. It was still cold this morning, but not as cold as it has been. I joined another hiker on an empty tent platform to eat breakfast and watch the sunrise. 
We started hiking at 7:30 and immediately were greeted with a ladder to climb down. It wasn’t long before we were climbing up the Goose Eyes. First we did North Peak, which was a climb but not anything too crazy. East Peak, on the other hand, was ladders and rock walls. On the way up East I saw a woman we stayed with back at Partnership Shelter. When I got to the top, SC was talking with the guy we’d stayed with at Sarver Hollow, or as we like to call it, “the Haunted Shelter.” 
Climbing down East was not much fun either. Again, ladders and rock walls. SC could see me from West Peak and called out, “How’s it going?” I responded, “I signed up for Level 2: no previous rock climbing experience!”
After the Goose Eyes was Mt. Carlo. Fortunately Carlo was not as exciting as the Goose Eyes, and next thing we know, we’re at the side trail to Carlo Col Shelter. It’s .3 miles off trail but we all need water and I also need to use the privy. SC and Sidewinder finish before me, and I tell them to go on and I’ll catch them at the state border because we only have half a mile of Maine left!!
Soon I’m on my way when suddenly I’m staring at a 50’ cliff I’m somehow supposed to climb?! It reminded me of the Notch, only the boulders were a little smaller and rather than moving horizontally, I’m going vertical. When I get to the border I ask, “What the h*ck was that?!” SC and Sidewinder know exactly what I’m talking about. 
Next was, you guessed it, another mountain. This one was called Success. SC met me there, but Sidewinder had pushed on. He wanted to camp on a ledge to get a good view of the night sky and have a shorter day into town tomorrow. SC and I were going to the next shelter. 
We were about to leave Mt. Success, when a familiar-looking guy walks up. “Are you Great Scott?” I ask. It is him! We had shared a shelter with him our second night on the trail. As we’re talking, 7 more hikers walk up, 5 of whom we had met on day 2 or 3 of our hike. Today we saw a total of 10 people we had met early on the trail. 
I decide to listen to a podcast for the hike down Success. It’s a 2 hour 22 minute interview with someone who just finished the trail. She comments, “No one told me I needed to be part mountain goat to hike the AT.” I feel so validated!
It takes me the entire episode to make my way down Success. I need to use the headlamp to make and eat dinner. Fortunately, there’s not a lot of people here, so we aren’t disturbing people as we set up in the shelter. There’s a family with 2 teenagers tenting nearby. SC thinks she saw them back at Partnership Shelter.  There’s a pond near the shelter (hence the name), so there’s a couple of nobos down there hoping to see their first moose. The view out of the shelter is the best I’ve seen.","Full Goose Shelter (ME)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622217,"I was up before sunrise as usual. While I wasn’t able to see the sunrise from the shelter, the hills turned a beautiful shade of pink as the sun came up. 
We had 2 named mountains today: Cascade and Hayes. They were by no means like walking in Virginia, but were a lot easier than what we did yesterday. There was a lot of walking across big, flat rocks today. I like this type of hiking. However, you have to pay more attention because it’s easier to lose the trail. 
After coming down Hayes, it was a nice, long, gradual descent into town. That part was a lot like Virginia. 
We do some road walking to the hostel. We get checked in and take showers. This place has my favorite loaner clothes. I might need to look into having them sent to other hostels. 
We order dinner from a pizza place. SC gets a pizza and I get a salad. I’m worried that the salad won’t be enough, so I also order loaded fries. I end up eating the fries and getting full. I guess I’m having salad for breakfast. This is another hostel that serves all you can eat pancakes for breakfast.

We decided to take a zero day today. We haven’t had a zero day in 3 weeks, and also we need time to do a resupply. After the convenience stores we had to work with in Maine, I’m excited to go to Walmart. 

There’s an 8:30 shuttle to the post office. We ask the shuttle driver if he can take us to the hardware store that’s right by the PO. On our way there we see a bear cross the road. That’s #10 for SC. Maybe #6 for me? At the hardware store we pick up stove fuel. Then the shuttle driver takes us to a coffee shop. SC and I both get lattes and sandwiches. I also get a piece of gluten free chocolate cake.
Back at the hostel, I eat second breakfast (the first was the salad I didn’t have for dinner). I have a nice talk with a dermatologist about the reasons we’re on trail and our plans for when we’re done. 

There’s a noon shuttle to Walmart. We have an hour, but we have so much to get. SC and I are running around, trying to get different things, and we keep losing each other. Finally we get in line and of course the woman in front of us can’t get her card to work. I run to the shuttle to let them know we’ll be a few more minutes. Then SC is trying to pay for some things with her Walmart gift card and they have to bring a manager over to figure it out. It involves SC typing in the numbers on the card. The process seems overly complicated.
After all that, we go back to the hostel and I post some journal entries and edit others. At dinner I have a frozen microwave meal, a bagged salad, and a bottle of kombucha. I’m glad I remembered to get dinner for tonight and breakfast for tomorrow.
I have my earplugs ready and hope to sleep better tonight.","US 2, Gorham, NH

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622219,"I slept a little better last night. However, at one point, one of my earplugs fell out, and I couldn’t find it. I would lay with one ear down and the other with an earplug in. When I needed to change sides, I would have to switch which ear the earplug was in. I finally gave up about 4:30 and got up to take a shower. 
We took our time getting out of the hostel this morning. We had 8 miles to hike and even though we are crossing a +4000’ peak, the way nobos were talking, it wouldn’t be that difficult. Also, while we were taking our zero yesterday, Sidewinder did a 21-mile slack pack. That puts him at least 2 days ahead of us. We said goodbye to the one hiker we’ve done the most hiking with. He’s going to try to pick up his pace and catch Dr. Scholl. Maybe we’ll see him again south of Damascus. 
We hiked .1 mile down the highway and then entered the White Mountain National Forest. 2 miles in we get to our first shelter. Just before the shelter, there’s an orientation group of Brown students. At the shelter is a group of Bates students. They head sobo while I make use of the privy. The privy is a disaster. Don’t worry, I’m not going to give you details. 

There’s a couple of hikers that passed us while we were stopped at the shelter that we quickly catch up to at a stream crossing. There’s not much water, but the stream bed is full of large rocks that are difficult to walk on. I duck under a fallen tree and gain the lead. I’m almost to the other side when I step on a rock and down I go! It doesn’t hurt at all, but definitely counts as a fall. It takes me a little work to get back up as I’m carrying a lot of weight in food. As soon as I start hiking, SC steps on the exact same rock and also falls. The other 2 hikers learn from this and decide to take a different route.
A little later, we pass the Bates students and I ask if I can share some trail karma information. They agree and I begin by saying, “It was probably the Brown students, not you guys,” before sharing what I saw in the privy. Anyway, it seemed to go well. They are heading to the same shelter as us, so hopefully we won’t have a repeat of the issues we had with the Harvard students. 
SC and I plan to meet up on top of our climb for today, Mt. Moriah. I’m almost to the top, and I try to rush to get to SC. It looks like it’s about to rain, and SC doesn’t have a pack cover. In my haste, I do something new: I fall going uphill! I trip and bang my right knee on a rock. That is fall #14. 
Just after I hurt my knee, I meet up with 3 day hikers coming down. “We have a message for you,” the first one tells me. Apparently SC had decided to go on to the shelter. 
Going down from Moriah is uneventful. There are a few places where I start to slip and am able to catch myself. Is the tread wearing out on these shoes already? I only have 200 miles on them.
When I get to the shelter, SC is on the phone. I filter water, set up my sleep system, and make dinner. She gets off the phone when dinner is ready.
I feel good about today because I left late and still made it to the shelter and didn’t have to use my headlamp. I also passed 12 sobo hikers. Granted, they are all section hikers, but still.","US 2, Gorham, NH
",Imp Shelter (NH),"Aug 30, Fri",8
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622873,"I slept okay last night. I stayed warm even though the wind blew straight into the shelter all night. It wasn’t all that cold when I got up, but I got cold eating breakfast. 

There were lots of people around to talk to this morning and we got going a little later than usual. Our first challenge of the day was the Carters. We went up North Carter then across Middle Carter and South Carter before descending into Zeta Pass. Then we went up Mt. Hight and over to Carter Dome before going down to Carter Notch. Then we had one more big climb up Wildcat A.
Basically today was a lot of going up and down. Occasionally there were spots like through Zeta Pass where there were a series of bog boards, but even those you have to be careful of because they can be slippery. It was also kinda flat in Carter Notch but the trail was strewn with 1’-5’ boulders which also slowed things down. Up on the Carters we had views of the Presidentials, but their summits were hidden in the clouds. 
Going down Carter Dome into Carter Notch was particularly difficult. There were rock steps which I usually prefer to randomly scattered boulders, but there were so many steps that were 2 or more feet down, my knees were protesting. There was also a place coming down where you could see Carter Notch Hut almost straight down and Wildcat rising nearly straight up on the other side of the notch. The scale of everything made me dizzy for a minute. 
After Imp, the next official campsite is Osgood, an 18-mile hike over lots of mountains. We were trying for Pinkham Notch, about 13 miles away and was rumored to have some unofficial places to camp nearby. We got to Carter Notch Hut about 3pm and still had 6 more miles to go.
A thing about the White Mountain Huts. They are lodges with bunks that serve dinner and breakfast to guests. However, they are expensive (up to $150pp/night) and this being Labor Day Weekend, probably was booked. Thru-hikers can sometimes land a work for stay and get some food and a spot to sleep in the dining room floor in exchange for doing some work. I didn’t want to ask at this hut when it was so early in the day and I wanted to go at least a little farther before calling it a day.
I sat inside for a little while, filled my water bottles, and then went to leave but I couldn’t find the AT. A croo member (don’t ask me why they spell “crew” that way) was out front, and I asked her how to get to the AT. 
“Are you going north or south?”
“South.”
“Then you’re going to go over the Wildcats and into Pinkham Notch.”
“Yes, I know that. What I’m trying to figure out is how to get from right here to the AT.”
“Oh, you go that way about a quarter mile. You can’t miss it.”
First of all, this kind of freaked me out. I’m .25 miles from the AT?! Apparently I did miss it because I hadn’t even realized I had gotten off the trail when I went to the hut. And it ended up being only .1 mile from the trail. 
Okay, so we climb the mile almost straight up Wildcat A. At the top there’s this viewpoint looking out over Carter Notch. SC is there waiting for me. Just before the viewpoint was an unofficial tent site with a backpack sitting there. Apparently it had already been claimed.
Anyway, I get to the viewpoint and sit down to get a drink and eat a snack. It’s almost 5pm. I ask SC, “What if we hike until we find a place to pitch our tent?” She’s agreeable to this, so we start hiking and just past the viewpoint I see a small path through the trees. I walk back there and find a spot with room for about 3 tents. We decide this is where we’ll make our home for the night. 
We do our usual evening chores and get to bed at a reasonable hour. We are surrounded by a thick wall of trees, so we are mostly protected from the wind that is blowing so hard up on this mountaintop.","Imp Shelter (NH)
",Unofficial Campsite on Wildcat A (NH),"Aug 31, Sat",8.10
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622874,"I had trouble getting to sleep because I was cold. I thought that because it was supposed to be warmer and we were staying in the tent which is warmer than a shelter. But I finally had to break down and get out the space blanket. I slept pretty well after that although I was awake enough around 3am to notice that the wind had died down. 
I woke up about 5:15 and got up to check the viewpoint. We were still about 30 minutes away from sunrise, but the sky was already changing to bright reds and oranges. I went back to the tent to wake up SC. She had asked me to get her up so she could see the sunrise, but she complained she was cold and stayed in sleeping bag for a while longer. 
It was another cold morning. We started hiking about 8 and I wore my jacket for the first time hiking. The first 2 miles were the uneven ridge line of the Wildcats. We had camped on A and crossed C, D, and E (B must be off the trail?). On D there was a observation deck. We sat on top and had snacks while admiring the views of the Presidentials. We saw a couple of hikers there that we had met just before the roller coaster. Today we had clear views and could see the buildings and towers on Mt. Washington. It would have been a great day to walk across those peaks. However, we are at least a day away from there. 
Between Wildcats D and E was a gondola. There were a bunch of clean-smelling people hanging out there. SC wanted to take the gondola down because so many people had comments on Guthook about the descent from Wildcat E to Pinkham Notch.
It was about 3 miles down. We put our trekking poles away in anticipation of using our hands a lot. I will say it was difficult. There were lots of places where it was exposed. In one in particular I had to crawl down this rock face and then there were wooden steps bolted into the rock when it got very steep. I’m so glad we were doing this on a nice day. 
But like all things, it eventually came to an end. I actually had a harder time when we got down to the Notch because the elevation profile looked flat when in reality it was climbing up ten feet and then down ten feet over and over again. We did run into a couple hikers we had met just south of Catawba, VA. 
We made it to the road and saw cars parked along the road as far as the eye could see. The parking lot had a sign saying it was full. I was dreading going to the visitors center because I figured it would be packed. However, we went in and there was hardly anyone there. Apparently they are all out hiking. 
We headed straight for the bathrooms, then went to the pack room to charge electronics. While they were charging, we went to the gift shop and I got postcards. They had a thru-hiker special of soup and bread for $2. I had the zucchini coconut soup with gluten free bread and SC had the chili with white bread. Next we went back to the pack room and I tried to clean my food bag. I had a bottle of olive oil that somehow leaked on everything. After about 90 minutes it was time to get back on trail.
Osgood Campsite was 4.8 miles and they were supposed to be relatively easy miles. We crossed the Washington Auto Road, and then ran into a guy we had first met in Maryland and hiked with for a while in Pennsylvania. He had hiked from the Delaware Water Gap to Vermont previously, so he had skipped up to Vermont once he finished Pennsylvania. Anyway, he had hiked across Mts. Washington and Madison today with this beautiful weather. 
We pressed on to the campsite. I got there about 7 and it was starting to get dark. SC and I hung out with some other hikers by the fire and made dinner. Before we went to the platform to get ready for bed, I went to the bear box by the first tent platform because Sidewinder had texted SC to check the bear box. Inside was a note and some trash compactor bags that SC could use because she had lost her packcover!
Anyway, it’s a late night here, but we have a tent on a wooden platform with a bear box and privy nearby. And we don’t have to pay to stay here. It’s supposed to rain tonight.","Unofficial Campsite on Wildcat A (NH)
",Osgood Campsite (NH),"Sep 01, Sun",9.70
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622875,"I didn’t sleep well last night. I was listening for the rain to start. I first heard some sprinkling about 12:45, and then the rain began in earnest around 2. I got up to use the privy and retrieve our food bags at 5:30, I then sat in the tent and thought about what to do. 
It is raining. It is supposed to rain all day. We are currently at the base of Mt. Madison, so for the next 2.5 miles, the trail is uphill and goes above tree line. We’re not supposed to lightning, but wet rocks and wind aren’t a good combination. My thought yesterday was we would climb over Madison and then go to the Madison Hut to see if we could get a work for stay. If not, there’s a campsite .6 miles from the hut we could stay at. However, that campsite had earthen tent pads rather than wooden platforms and doesn’t have bear boxes. Also we would be packing up a wet tent, climbing Madison in the rain, and possibly setting up our tent in the rain. Or we could stay here. SC’s bladder got her up at 7:30. When she gets back to the tent, I tell her my plan. As she is the one that carries the tent and doesn’t have a packcover, she likes this proposal.
So today we mostly sat in our tent and read and wrote. I called Spike’s Dad and talked to him for a while. I wasn’t particularly hungry or thirsty, but SC had to keep herself from eating everything in her food bag. SC remarked, “This is the first zero day we haven’t done anything.”","Osgood Campsite (NH)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622876,"I went to bed at 8pm last night, although I was technically in bed most of the day. Anyway, I fell asleep listening to the rain fall on the tent. I slept pretty well for just sitting around all day. I don’t know exactly when the rain stopped, but it was before I woke up about 4:15 and got up at 4:45 to use the privy. When I got back to the tent, I used my towel to dry it off as much as possible. Then got inside the tent and began packing. Soon SC was awake and packing as well. 
We had 2 big mountains (including the tallest mountain in New Hampshire) in 10.3 miles to do today, so we were trying to get out of camp as early as we could. I left just before 6:30. SC caught up with me about an hour later. 
We had camped at the base of Mt. Madison, so as soon as we started hiking, we were going up. The first 1.5 miles were in the trees which hung on the trail and got us wet. Then there was a mile from the tree line to the summit. As we walked up, the clouds swirled around us. Sometimes we could see down in the valleys below and sometimes we could barely see more than a few feet away. 
I fell once on the way up Madison (#15). I was on a slight downhill and slipped on a rock. At the time, I had twisted my arm trying to catch myself, but it quickly recovered.
When I got to the top of Madison, there wasn’t much to see. I wasn’t even sure where the summit was as it wasn’t marked. I was excited to go down until I actually started going down. The trail was treacherous. Lots of rocks and boulders, no clear trail, and lots of places where one could sprain an ankle or bash a head against a rock. Climbing up was slow. Climbing down was slower. 
At one point I looked down, and saw a leather bracelet between some rocks. I recognized it as belonging to SC. I picked it up and gave it to her later. She hadn’t even realized it had fallen off. I can’t believe I saw it given that there wasn’t a clear trail so I could have been yards away from the route SC had taken.
I finally reached Mt. Madison Hut on the other side. It took me 5 hours to go 3.5 miles. I still had another 7 miles to go. I hoped the rest of the miles would go faster.
After taking a brief break and getting water at the hut, I kept hiking. The trail past the hut was much better. There were places where the rocks had been laid flat so that it was like walking on a sidewalk.
Between Madison and Washington, we hiked by Adams, Jefferson, and Clay. At one point, SC passed me when I thought she was ahead of me. Apparently she had started up Jefferson and saw me walking below. She was about to yell to tell me I was not on the AT, but then she checked her phone and saw she was the one not on the right trail. She told me later that there were several places where she got off on a wrong trail. I was checking Guthook regularly and was always on the AT even when I thought I had made a wrong turn. 

The whole way to Washington was not sidewalk-like. Several places were rocky and difficult. Fortunately they were horizontal and not vertical. The last half mile up Washington was particularly sketchy. I was so glad we were going up and not down. I was worried that it would be bad when we came down the other side.
I got up on Washington and it was nearly empty. It took me a while to find SC who was in the hiker basement at the visitors center charging electronics and organizing her pack. They were closing, so we went out and found a couple to take our picture by the summit sign. Most of the summit sign pictures I have seen of hikers are in clouds, wind, and rain. We had a beautiful, clear summit. 
We had 1.5 miles to Lakes of the Clouds Hut. The trail down was really nice. It wasn’t quite a sidewalk but got close at times. We arrived about 7pm. We could pay $10 to stay on the floor or commit to working in the morning and stay for free and get breakfast. We picked the second option. I was surprised there were still work for stays available this late. Most people just paid the $10. 
We made dinner outside and then ate inside with other thru-hikers. There’s one other flip-flopper here going sobo. Everyone else is nobo. We met a couple of them back in Virginia. It’s now late (after 9pm), but we are sleeping on the dining room floor so we have to wait until the hut guests go to bed before we can set up.","Osgood Campsite (NH)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622878,"They announced 15 minutes until lights out at 9:15 and the guests started going to bed and the thru-hikers started setting up our sleeping pads. I was in the very back and could see so many stars out the windows. I put in my earplugs, put my buff over my eyes and ears, and tried to sleep. There were a lot of heavy foot steps and some people talking oddly loudly, but eventually I managed to fall asleep.

I woke up around 3am, and the stars had disappeared. When I woke up at 5:30, clouds had completely enveloped the hut.

There were not a lot of guests staying at the hut, so they let us stay and sit in the dining room while the guests had breakfast. After guests were done eating, SC, a couple of nobos, and I had a chance to eat leftovers before starting on our work for stay chores. SC and I straightened up and swept the bunk rooms for an hour.
About 9:30 we headed out into the clouds. It was rainy and windy. There was a trail crew out working on the trail, and for most of the hike to Mizpah Spring the trail was nicely maintained. We walked just below the summit of Monroe, across Franklin, just below the summit of Eisenhower, and then across Pierce. The first half of the hike was pretty exposed, and as we hiked we were going lower in elevation and gaining tree cover. This was good because when we were about a half mile from the hut, we heard thunder. It was also here that the trail became steep and more difficult. But then we saw the hut!
We went in and got our free bowl of soup (we get one at one hut for buying a thru-hiker pass). SC was looking for something to pass the time, so she offered to help out and they put her to work washing dishes. 
At 4pm we went to the person in the kitchen and asked for a work for stay, and they said yes! Second night in a row where we get to stay inside for free. We were joined by 3 other hikers and they had us hang out in the library while the guests had dinner. We mostly just sat around and talked about food. We did wonder if we had made the right decision to stay when we saw the sun come out around 5pm, but a few minutes later it was raining again
When dinner was over, we were invited down to eat leftovers. In addition to dinner, they also had some soup they were trying to get rid of. I have had so much soup today. 
Next was the work part of the work for stay. SC scrubbed dishes in the kitchen while I defrosted and inventoried a fridge in the basement. Then we asked nicely and they said we could stay in the library tonight rather than set up on the dining room floor. This is great because it is cleaner and warmer in here. We did have a croo member come in and ask us to keep it down. This is a good group of people to hang out with and I’m so glad we don’t have to tent outside in the cold rain.","Lakes of the Clouds Hut (NH)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622879,"I slept pretty well in the library. We all got up and got moving relatively early. We got a group picture before heading our separate ways. 

The air was so cold this morning. I’m so glad we were able to stay inside last night. The morning was also pretty cloudy and windy.
Our first destination for the day was Mt. Jackson. SC said she could see Mt. Washington when she first got up there, but the only thing I could see by the time I arrived was clouds. Fortunately the clouds began to burn away and by the time we got to Mt. Webster, the sky was clear. Jackson involved a lot of climbing both up and down. Webster was confusing. I couldn’t figure out which way to go until I saw a couple coming nobo. It turns out I had met them before and they recognized Spike and me. They are actually doing this thing where they have 2 cars and hike between them. They end up going south while hiking north. I may run into them again. 
After Mt. Webster is the Webster Cliffs. For at least a half mile there are vertigo inducing views of Crawford Notch. 
At one point we took a break and was admiring the view and we started to see a bunch of rabbits. They were bigger than the cottontails we have back in the Midwest. We would only see one at a time but they would come from different directions and then would get close to us without stopping. SC also saw another mammal. It sounds like a pine marten. I want to see a pine marten!
Webster Cliffs of course involved some climbing down. We saw several people we had met back in Virginia during this stretch. Eventually we got down to the road. The next 7.6 miles were the fastest trail we’ve had since we flipped up to Katahdin. First we had a .3 mile road walk. Then we took a break at a parking lot where we met a couple who were looking for their niece. They gave us a description and we were pretty sure we had seen her not long before we crossed the road. Then they showed us a picture and we were sure that we had seen her. But basically that means she walked right by them. 
Next we started a 2.5mile uphill. Even though we were going up, it was gradual and didn’t involve rock climbing. Most of the way there were even log steps!
Our original goal for the day was Ethan Pond Shelter. We got to the turn off just after 3pm, and we had heard from the other hikers we worked with last night that the trail between Ethan Pond and Zealand Falls Hut was fast, so we decided to press on and see if we could get a third night of work for stay in a row. It would also mean a shorter day tomorrow. 

The trail was in fact super easy for the next 5.5 miles. It was real trail involving dirt rather than rocks and tree roots. It was also flat. It only took me a little over 2 hours to go those 5.5 miles which is much faster than the 1mph I’ve been averaging lately.
We got to the hut around 5:30pm and were given a work for stay. We sat out front waiting for permission to go inside and eat leftovers although it was quickly getting cold and dark. An older woman who had hiked the trail in 1991 and was now doing the northern half this year after completing the southern half last year had arrived not long after us and also got a work for stay. We were sitting outside talking and one of the croo came out and invited us to come inside and have soup while the guests ate. 

This ended up being the most difficult meal in regards to avoiding my allergies. The soup was lentil and barley. I’ve been told I’m allergic to wheat, but the proteins in barley are very similar to those in wheat, so I usually avoid barley as well. I figured a little barley in some soup wouldn’t hurt me. But then the croo brought over the dinner leftovers. There was veggie lasagna, green beans, salad, and a bowl full of different kinds of breads. I ate some green beans (they were too crunchy) and polished off the salad. For dessert there was earl grey tea cake with lemon glaze. It looked amazing so I took the smallest piece. It was so moist and the flavor was amazing. It was definitely worth the price I’ll pay for eating it later.
After dinner, SC went to work on dishes while I was given a dish drainer thing to scrub with a toothbrush. I definitely needed a smaller brush to get in the holes, but it looked a lot better than when I started. As we were working another woman came in to ask about a work for stay. They said she could do the morning shift.
While I was scrubbing, one of the croo members ended up splashing some water on my foot. She felt bad and said I didn’t need to scrub anymore. I had been working for less than 45 minutes! I went to get ready for bed and they let SC and the older woman be done shortly afterwards. 
All the guests were out of the dining room by 9:15, so we were all set up for bed by the time the lights were turned off at 9:30. SC looks cozy having set up under on of the tables. It seems like better weather tonight, but I’m happy to have completed over 14 miles today. The next official place to camp is the Guyot Shelter which is another 4 miles plus an additional mile off trail.","Mizpah Spring Hut (NH)
",Zealand Falls Hut (NH),"Sep 05, Thu",14.20
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622880,"It was another good night of sleep. I dreamed that I was in a swim meet and the coach had only signed me up for one event: the 500 yard free. However, I was feeling really good with my butterfly, so I was trying to get placed in the 100 fly. However, the 2 events were back to back and I was concerned about doing well in the 500 when I had just completed the 100 fly. It was a coed meet, so there would be a men’s event between the 100 fly and the 500 free, but it would be the men’s 100 fly, which would not give me enough rest time. I wanted the men’s 500 to go before the women’s so that I could have that time to recover. 
Anyway, I was not the first person up for once this morning. The older woman got up first but I wasn’t that far behind her. We were all up and packing before the croo woke up the guests at 6:30. I went outside to make hot water for oatmeal by the falls and watched the sunrise over the mountains.
We started hiking about 7:10 and it wasn’t long before I lost the trail. The trail was following the Whitewall Brook which had lots of cascades. People had made all these side paths to look at the brook that when the trail actually turned and crossed the brook, I didn’t notice until the trail I was following got so small and overgrown that I realized I wasn’t on the AT anymore. 
I was spoiled by yesterday’s trail. Today was back to rocks, roots, and climbing. I felt like I was dragging all day. 
A couple of women passed me in the morning. They greeted me with, “Are you auntie?” I said yes and then one of the women started telling me that SC was carrying too much weight. “Apparently it’s not enough because she’s still so much faster than me.”
“She’s going to get worn down and tendinitis!” I wanted to say, what about me? I’m the one with joints 22 years older than hers. No one seems worried that I’m going to get tendinitis. 
When I caught up to SC, she said the women talked to her for a while. They had gone to stay at the Guyot Shelter last night except that when they got there, the shelter was gone and they hadn’t brought a tent. Someone was there who helped them rig up a tarp. A new shelter was going to be flown in by helicopter today!



The climb up South Twin Mountain was difficult, but at least we had views when we got to the top. In fact we could see the helicopter flying supplies to the Guyot Shelter. We were hoping to see a shelter flying through the air, but apparently they fly it in in pieces, not whole. Bummer.
The climb down South Twin was also difficult. We ran into several nobos today that we had met in Virginia. They seemed very discouraged with all the climbing and rocks. We were able to tell them they would have good trail between Zealand Falls Hut and Crawford Notch. We also told them that the Whites are hard and everyone was struggling. We didn’t tell them that it was going to be this way for the rest of the trail. That would just be demoralizing.
After descending South Twin, we headed over to Galehead Hut. SC and I both got soup. SC also had free chocolate cake. Apparently there was something wrong with it, so they were giving it to thru-hikers so they wouldn’t have to pack it out (the croo have to carry in most of the supplies and carry out the trash). Thru-hikers are their garbage disposals. 
It was too early to ask for work for stay and we wanted to go farther anyway, so we left the hut and began climbing Mt. Garfield. The trail went straight up the mountain and was extremely rocky. No wonder we had seen so many discouraged hikers today. There were places where we were basically climbing a waterfall. I just told myself that hundreds, if not thousands, of people have done this section of trail this year. If they can do it, I can do it.
It seemed like forever but I finally made it to the turn off to the shelter. The uphill climb at the end of the day was discouraging, but at least I can look ahead and see that it’s going to get easier for me. For the nobos, it’s going to remain difficult. I think I would have trouble continuing under those circumstances. 
At the shelter were 3 hikers we had met back in Virginia. We caught up with them. We all made dinner in the cold wind and then bundled up for bed early. It’s the first time I’m going to sleep before 9:30pm in a while.","Zealand Falls Hut (NH)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622882,"I woke up at 2:15am. I thought I couldn’t get back to sleep but then I looked and it was 5:25, so must have slept at some point. I could hear the wind howling throughout the night, although when I got up, things were more calm and the promised rain hadn’t materialized.
I made and ate breakfast and everyone else was starting to stir when I got back to the shelter. The shelter was .2 miles from the AT which is also where there was water.  (Remember the climb up the waterfall yesterday? Yeah, that water.) I filled up and started hiking.

The trail was still uphill when I started, but not as steep and with fewer waterfalls than yesterday. At the top of Mt. Garfield, SC caught up with me and we could see Franconia Ridge ahead.
After Garfield we of course had to go down and then back up to Mt. Lafayette to begin Franconia Ridge. The climbs up and down were probably difficult, but I think we’re just getting used to all the rocks and climbing so it just seems normal now. The north side of Lafayette had lots of trail runners. We saw several pass us going up and then coming back down.
Up on top of Lafayette the views were incredible. I could see for miles in every direction. We could see the Presidentials we have completed and the rest of the ridge we are to do today.
As we continued south along the ridge, it became clear that today was a Saturday. The ridge became packed with people who did not appear to have very much hiking experience. Because it is a ridge, sometimes only one person can be on the trail at a time so I spent an inordinate amount of time waiting for people to pass. At one point, there was a short climb that had plenty of hand and foot holds. A guy going the opposite way balked at the “cliff.” I laughed, “Oh, it’s just a little one.” He looked at me wide-eyed, “There are worse?”
I have to wonder if today is some sort of Canadian holiday. It seemed like there were more French speakers on the ridge than English speakers. 
Eventually we got to the end of the ridge and started heading back down below tree line. There we saw a couple of hikers we met around mile 200. Then, .4 miles past the Liberty Springs Campsite, we hit our halfway point! We have now completed 1096 miles of the Appalachian Trail. Only 1096 left!
After that the trail became increasingly flat. Eventually the AT joined up with a bike trail to cross a stream. Just past the bridge, the trail turned north, but we stayed on the bike path. We then took a trail to a parking lot because we were getting off trail for the night!
A cousin of a friend lives in New Hampshire and she came up to meet us. Her car was parked right where we came out of the woods. She drove us into North Woodstock where we checked into a motel and got showers. Then we went down the street to a restaurant for dinner.
This is tied with the longest time we’ve been out between town stops. Both this section of the Whites and the 100MW took 8 days. The one difference was that we didn’t bring as much food but it worked out because we could get food from the huts as well as the Pinkham Notch visitors center. We also did some charging of electronics at Pinkham Notch.","Garfield Ridge Shelter (NH)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622883,"I slept well last night in a real bed and still woke up early. Fortunately, there’s a 24-hour laundromat across the street, so I took everything there. SC stayed in the room and continued to sleep. I wore rain gear so all of my clothes could be washed. Then I went back to the room so I could take another shower and put on clean clothes. 
Our next stop was a restaurant for breakfast before going to a convenience store to resupply. We are stopping at Glencliff in a couple of days so all we needed was breakfasts and snacks for 2 days. Early on the trail I would refuse to buy stuff at convenience stores because it’s so expensive, but around here it’s all that’s available. It is a little cheaper than buying the same snacks at the huts. 



Then we went back to the room to organize everything and finish charging our electronics. We were not going very far today, so I was going to stay in the room until check out time.
The motel offers rides to the trail starting at 8:30 and going until everyone is shuttled. Waiting until 11am to leave means that we have to find our own ride. We were not the only hikers who stayed “late.” We met a couple dropping off their key at the same time as us. They were headed south into town though. SC and I stuck our thumbs out and headed north toward the trail. Vehicle #4 pulled over and picked us up. It was a guy who works at a local brewery who said he wasn’t all that interested in going to work.
He asked if we were going to the Liberty Springs trailhead, and we said yes. However, he dropped us off at the Flume Gorge Visitors Center. No problem, we’ll just take the bike path rather than the trail we took yesterday. And despite being .3 miles longer, I think the bike path was faster.
Just .2 miles after we got back to the trail we hit another milestone. 1100 miles! We took a picture and then kept hiking. 
We took our time today because we only wanted to go 4.8 miles and wait until tomorrow to tackle the Kinsmans. We stopped at our last hut. I got a free soup, but SC wanted the soup and grilled cheese combo. The woman working the kitchen asked her if she was willing to do some dishes in exchange for food.  SC jumped in the kitchen and went right to work.
Eventually we left the warmth and yummy smells of the hut and got ourselves moving again. It was uphill to the shelter. A sobo flip-flopper we’ve been leap-frogging with is here along with a couple of people who appear to be section hikers. There is also a caretaker at this shelter, so we have to pay to stay here, but this is her last night! If we were here tomorrow, we wouldn’t have to pay. It’s worth paying though to have a clean privy and a bear box.
It’s going to be another cold, windy night.","Cascade Brook/Franconia Notch/North Woodstock, NH

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623179,"Last night was cold, and I didn’t sleep very well. I woke up around 4am, and finally let myself get up at 5. When I got up it was cold, and fortunately the wind had died down and there was no rain. 
We got going just after 7:30am. We first tackled North Kinsman before going over South Kinsman. We were already part of the way up North Kinsman by going to the shelter. The climb wasn’t so bad. Going down was longer. 
While the climbs were par for the course, the mud we encountered today was something new. We first went through a bog where there were missing bog boards. It was impossible to go through without getting your feet wet. Fortunately the bog wasn’t terribly deep, so by choosing my steps carefully, the water never came all the way over my shoes. But then we had mud. Some places there were yards of trail that were just mud and I had to feel around with my trekking poles to find places where there were rocks close to the surface. I ran into a couple of hikers we had met near Glasgow, VA and one had mud up to his right knee because he had taken a wrong step.
As we came down into Kinsman Notch, a nobo passed saying something about “only” having a 17 mile day. I haven’t seen a 17 mile day since we flipped. I wanted to tell him I was going to be really happy if I could make 13 miles today. 
As I got close to the road, SC was sitting sitting on a rock waiting for me. I was glad to see her because I wanted to talk about today’s destination. Apparently this was also what she wanted to talk about. Our goal had been the Beaver Brook Shelter. However, getting there involves a 1.5 mile steep climb with waterfalls. Not wanting to repeat the discouragement of our night at Garfield Ridge, we decide to camp just past the road where there are supposed to be unofficial campsites. There is also a parking lot with pit toilets and trash cans. We will save that climb for the morning when our legs are fresh. 
We have set up our camp near Beaver Brook and beside what appears to be a beaver pond. There are trees here that have obviously been worked on by beavers, but none of it looks fresh. This is the first night we have hung a bear line since we flipped north. 
SC got a text from Sidewinder today. He had been 4 days ahead of us, but he got off for a couple of days on the road we just crossed, so now we are ahead of him. Maybe we will see him tomorrow.","Kinsman Pond Shelter (NH)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623183,"Today was SC’s last day on the trail. When we were back taking a zero day in Gorham, she made the decision to finish the Whites and then go home. Today is the 116th day since we started. Prior to this, the longest she had been away from home was 3 weeks. She has been an amazing hiking partner, and I do not think I could have made it this far without her.
I woke up this morning, and like most mornings, I had to go to the bathroom. Because we were camping close to the parking lot that had toilets, I decided to walk there rather than dig a cat hole, but it was dark and we had set up our tent as far as we could from the trail, so I had trouble finding the lot. That was an exciting way to start the day. 
We did our usual morning chores and got started a little later than usual, 8:10. Because it was SC’s last day, I took the lead so we could hike together. 

The first thing we did was start climbing. We had one last mountain to climb: Moosilauke. I’ve heard people talk about how difficult the north side is. Many nobos slack pack this mountain sobo so they can climb the steepest part rather than go down it. It was steep and difficult; however, there was less climbing than I had expected. Also, I had heard that you were climbing a waterfall, so I was expecting something like the climb up Garfield only longer. We were climbing *beside* a waterfall, not in it. When I needed to take a break (which was often), the waterfalls were something nice to look at, but they didn’t make the climb any more difficult.
We stopped and took a break when we got to the turn off to the shelter. Then it was time to just hike up the mountain rather than climb it, so I got my trekking poles out. Eventually we got to the tree line. A guy was coming down saying that it was a good day to be on top of Moosilauke because it was warm and not too windy. I don’t know if the weather changed or if he just has a different threshold for what constitutes warm and not too windy, because it was pretty cold and windy when we got to the summit. It was a beautiful summit, though. For a long time we were up above the tree line with great views in every direction.

Then it was time to start our descent. At first it was pretty easy. There was obviously some trail maintenance done here recently. Then we had our usual tricky Whites descent. As we got closer to our end point, the trail flattened out. It felt like we were flying!
We stopped by the last shelter before SC was to get off. Sidewinder had signed in earlier today! He must have gotten on trail and passed us before we started this morning.
On top of Moosilauke, SC had texted with her parents who were coming to pick her up and bring some things for me. They estimated that they would be at the parking lot off of NH Route 25 in 3.5 hours. I was thinking it was going to take us about 4. We made plans to meet them at the lot. 
We reached the road and at first I wasn’t sure it was the right road. We got there faster than I expected, only a few minutes after 4pm. Also, SC’s parents, who usually show up early, were not there. But I checked Guthook and we were at the right place. We organized our things. I got rid of some things I didn’t want to carry and took some things from her that I would need. I collapsed my trekking poles and changed from hiking shoes to camp shoes. I worked on my journal entries. At 5pm they still hadn’t arrived and neither of us had cell service, so I had SC stay there and I walked down to a hostel nearby. I still didn’t have service, but the hostel had WiFi. I called SC’s mom, and it went to voicemail which says the mailbox is full. I then called her dad and left a message. I then called Spike’s Dad. He then started texting and calling. He finally got through and gave them some information. Just before 6pm, I get a text from SC’s mom, and a few moments later, they pull into the hostel’s parking lot. I got in and we drove down to pick up SC and our stuff. Apparently they were using driving directions on one of the phones and then accidentally got out of navigation when they didn’t have service. They were on the right road but kept turning around before they got far enough north. 
We go back to the hostel and I pick up some food and other supplies they had brought for me including a one person tent. I hug SC good bye, and then they leave. I teared up a little bit, although I thought I would ugly cry. I think the stress with her parents getting there late made the good bye less sad and more stressful.
Now I’m sitting here at this hostel feeling kinda lost. I had a plan for how and when we were going to get here. I guess I will get on the trail tomorrow and start hiking.","Unofficial Campsite by Beaver Brook (NH)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623188,"Last night I sat around for a little while talking to some of the other hikers. Then about 8:30 I decided to get ready for bed. By the time I had everything set up it sounded like there was a party going on downstairs. I put in my earplugs and managed to fall asleep.
For some reason I woke up at 3am and finally got up at 4:30. I went out to the “bathhouse” which is where the running water (toilet, sink, washer and dryer, and shower) is. This is probably the least clean hostel I’ve been to and the set up of everything in the yard under a tent doesn’t help things. I decided I didn’t want to shower so I just washed my face and feet well. I then went inside and worked on journal entries until more people were up and moving. The first guy to come down after me went outside, probably to use the toilet. A few minutes later I could smell skunk. Fortunately the guy didn’t get sprayed. I don’t know what the skunk may have reacted to. 
By 6:30 several people were up and the lights were on. There was a shuttle leaving for people slack packing Moosilauke at 7:30 and another at 8:30. I just needed to walk up the road to get on trail, but I didn’t have enough snacks to get me to Hanover. I needed to wait for all of shuttles to be completed to get a ride to the store. I found another guy who needed to resupply and they took us about 10:30. The store was still pretty much a convenience store, but it was bigger and nicer than most of the others I’ve been to lately. I also got some ice cream for lunch because why not?
About 11:45 I was all packed and organized so I started walking toward the trail. This time I was completely by myself. 

There were some rolling hills today. Plenty of rocks and roots but also more dirt. One of the hills was called Mt. Mist, but it was nothing like the recent mountains we had been doing.
I saw 6 nobos today, one of whom I had met back in Virginia. There was a guy from the hostel who left after me. I hadn’t realized he was a sobo. We leapfrogged several times today. I also saw 2 red efts today, the first ones I’ve seen since we flipped up to Katahdin. 
I got to a campsite just south of NH Route 25A. There’s actually several places along the trail here that look like they are frequented by locals, and based on the trash here, they’re gluten free. I saw a tent set up about 100 yards north of me, but for the most part I’m alone.
The trees are just starting to change color. However, today it was raining in the morning and the afternoon was hot and humid. Mosquitoes were biting me as I made dinner, which hasn’t happened in a while.","NH Route 25, Glencliff, NH

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623191,"I woke up this morning at 5:25am and it takes me nearly 2 hours to get on the trail. I was hoping that if I wasn’t waiting on SC to wake up I might be able to get on the trail faster in the morning. However, I’m not used to breaking down this tent and in general it’s going to be slower to get ready when I’m in a tent rather than a shelter. I guess I’ll have to see how things go as I get used to being by myself. 
While I didn’t get any rain overnight, it is cloudy when I get up and starts raining shortly after I get on trail. I start off the day with a climb up Mt. Cube. I see a day hiker with a large dog and 3 nobos while walking up the mountain. I am also passed by the guy I leapfrogged with yesterday who wants to know when I passed him. 

The top of Mt. Cube is rocky and open, covered with slick rock. There would be views without the rain and clouds. I have service on top and am happy to see that the rain is supposed to stop by 11am.
I see 2 more nobos coming down Mt. Cube. One of them warns me that there is a lot of slick rock on Smarts Mountain. I cross a road and then a creek. I stop at the creek and take off my packcover and filter water. Spike is glad to get out of the confines of the pack and see again. A couple going nobo stop at the creek and we exchange information. They also warn me about the slick rock on Smarts which is my next climb. 
I don’t have too many problems climbing Smarts. There is a fire tower on top which Spike and I climb. Spike is nervous about heights, but by the time we get to a height he’s worried about we look up and we’ve reached the top.
I meet a couple of day hikers coming down Smarts. When they come down, they ask questions about our hike. They tell me about the great views on the way down the trail. Maybe I’ve been ruined by Maine and the Whites because I don’t find the slick rock as treacherous as the nobos seemed to think it was and the views weren’t all that great either. I had fall #17 today coming down Smarts. I stepped on a slippery rock and went down without injury. I did notice that we are starting to see some fall color. I should also mention that I saw 4 red efts today. 

There’s a road and a creek at the bottom of Smarts. I fill up with water and check Guthook for camping options. There is supposed to be a place to camp off of another trail about .1 from here. I have found something. Not the best campsite ever but it will work.
I have survived my second day out here alone. Tonight there doesn’t appear to be anyone camped nearby. My phone is telling me I climbed 325 flights today. That seems like an overestimate. Maybe the fire tower climb threw things off.","Unofficial Campsite MM1784.3 (NH)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623192,"I didn’t sleep well last night, and then I woke up at 3:30 and got up at 5. This morning was another 2 hours to get on the trail and I didn’t even dig a cat hole. 
I had been hoping to get to the Trapper John Shelter yesterday but I didn’t want to be hiking in the dark, so I stopped and camped. Today I stopped by the shelter and used the privy and signed the shelter register. The privy was the fullest I have seen. It was almost unusable. In the register I see that Sidewinder is a day ahead of me. 


The trail was very quiet this morning. I didn’t see anyone until 10:45 when 2 women with dogs passed me. Shortly after that, I passed a couple still in their tent at 11am. At first I thought they had found a nice spot with a bench of some sort, and when I got close I saw their tent was practically on the trail and the bench was actually a footbridge. I had to avoid their kitchen set up to cross the stream.

There is an old stone fireplace by the shelter, so Spike gets his picture taken on it before we move on to Moose Mountain. We stop at the north peak of Moose and have an hour lunch break. There is a shelter just before Hanover, but getting there would be an 18 mile day, and I’m not feeling that. Looking through the Guthook comments, my best bet for a campsite is only an 11 mile day, so I feel like I can take my time.
Between the north and south peaks of Moose Mountain is the Moose Mountain shelter. I also stop there to read and sign the register. They have a bench there too, so of course Spike and I spend some time sitting on it. 
On my way down Moose I see a guy I met back on the third day we were on trail. I then make my way to the campsite which is beside a creek. I don’t like camping so close to water or the trail (not exactly practicing leave no trace here), but all I see in Guthook are comments about places that aren’t good for camping. I’m alone again tonight, although I’ve seen a number of day hikers walk by since I’ve been here. A woman with 2 kids and 3 dogs stopped and talked for a little while. I also have service here so I talked to Spike’s Dad. I enjoyed getting to camp early enough that I didn’t have to rush to get everything done before dark. I do wish I had more daylight when I put up my bear bag because I have this one on a branch 45’ up and I’d like to take a picture of it. I am impressed especially because I was aiming for a lower branch.

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623194,"I didn’t sleep well. I woke up at 12midnight and couldn’t get back to sleep so I posted journal entries. I went back to bed around 3:30 and dreamed I was trying to take a bath but the water would get dirty quickly and I couldn’t get clean. I haven’t showered or done laundry in 6 days, so it seems pretty accurate. 
I woke up at 5:45 and again took about 2 hours to get going. The sky was dark as I was packing up and it even sprinkled for a few seconds as I was packing. The weather said it was supposed to rain around 11am, so I hoped I could make it to town before then.
I hiked with my packcover on my backpack much to Spike’s dismay because the sky looked like it was about to open up at any minute.
A couple of day hikers/trail runners passed me as I was doing my morning chores. Once I was on the trail, a trail runner passed me from behind and said I was hiking nearly as fast as he was running. When I saw my first thru-hiker of the day, I knew him! We had hiked with him in Pennsylvania. He had been hiking with his best friend for longer than SC and I had been hiking together, and then his best friend broke his foot in New York and had to get off the trail.
After seeing the trail today, I wish I had pressed on yesterday. There was a lot of wide open woods that would have worked to camp in. 
Today’s trail had a lot of up and down with many rocks or roots. I kept up a good pace and got to Hanover around noon. It had sprinkled a little but never really rained. I walked by the co-op where I was going to resupply and then to the community center. I had heard the community center was only open Monday-Friday but the nobo I talked to said it was “like a Y.” In the guides it is listed as a “recreation center” which makes it sound like a Y. Anyway, I walked by there and it was closed for the weekend. It’s a community center, a place for local organizations to meet. They do offer showers and laundry to hikers for a fee. He had also told me the local hostel didn’t have running water. It’s a bummer I was here on a Saturday because otherwise I could have showered and done laundry and just gotten back on the trail.
My first stop was the Indian restaurant for lunch. I ordered coconut soup, rogan josh, and chai and then proceeded to clean my plates. The waitress was impressed with how much I ate. If she hadn’t brought the check, though, I probably would have also ordered dessert. 
Next I went to the public library. There was a list of trail angels that would provide rides or a place to stay. I needed a place to shower and do laundry but the thought of calling a bunch of strangers was stressful. I had run into a couple when I first got into town who told me to not bother calling the first 4 on the list because they were “out of town.” There was a guy at the library though telling me to call the first 2 because they were friends of his. I said that they were out of town, but he was saying that it meant they lived in Norwich, not that they were on vacation. I’m going toward Norwich, so that isn’t a problem. I do wish the list indicated who was in Hanover and who was in Norwich. Anyway, now I’m stressed out and confused. I decide to just call the hostel and ask if they have water because the nobo I passed earlier said that last he heard, they didn’t. They do, so I decide to go there after I resupply. 
I walk back to the co-op and pick up food. There’s a guy sitting outside charging his phone and smoking who has a million questions about the Whites. He has Guthook on his phone and nominally looks like a thru-hiker, but some of his questions seem strange. For example he doesn’t know what nobo, sobo, or flip-flop mean.
Once I have my resupply food packed up, I follow the trail through Hanover and towards Norwich. I remember that I need to pick up something at CVS, so I take a slight detour. While I’m there I check out food prices and they are higher than the convenience stores I’ve been to lately. I’m glad I stopped at the co-op because it was more expensive than a regular grocery store but less than a convenience store.
Hanover is home to Dartmouth. The trail skirted around the school, so I didn’t get a sense of campus. It does appear that classes haven’t started yet. I saw a lot of students moving into apartments. An Episcopal church advertised a “Blessing of laptops and backpacks” for tomorrow.
Next it was downhill and across the Connecticut River. The river is the border between New Hampshire and Vermont, so we’ve completed another state! The road walk between Hanover and Norwich was boring, and then once I got into Norwich, it was a super cute town. I sat on a bench in a park where an antiques market was being held and called the hostel. 15 minutes later I was riding to the hostel. I had hiked 10 miles, had lunch, and resupplied by 3:30. Maybe it’s okay that I didn’t hike farther yesterday. 

There were 3 hikers at the hostel when I arrived. I think they are all nobo, although it also seems like they might have been here for a few days already. I’m staying in a room upstairs with a section hiker who arrived after me. I took a shower and then started laundry. While laundry was going, I took advantage of the $1 pints of Ben & Jerry’s by having some Cherry Garcia.
Eventually laundry was done and I went upstairs and got ready for bed. My roommate came in shortly after. We are both in bed, looking at our phones in the dark.","Mink Brook Unofficial Campsite (NH)

I managed to fall back asleep and sleep pretty well until 5:30. Then I got up to go to the bathroom and have breakfast. This hostel offers all you can eat pancakes and eggs. Finally, something besides pancakes. I had also picked up yogurt and kombucha at the co-op yesterday, so I had that as well. I considered having another pint of ice cream, but decided against it. Maybe if they had chunky monkey. 
A guy who came in late last night is the first one to join me. He is going sobo and summited Katahdin 26 days before me. Finally, someone going slower than me!

The sobo, my roommate, and I are all itching to get out and on the trail. The other 3 appear to be staying another day. I get a ride back to Norwich and start hiking about 8:20. I start off with more road walking. The houses are all old and really look nice.
Finally I’m back in the woods. I start seeing red efts almost immediately. Over the course of the day I see 5. That has to be tied with the most I’ve seen in one day. 

Then I see the guy who showed me the “nope noodle” back in Pennsylvania. He remembered my name and seemed excited to see someone he knew. He’s trying to catch up with the guy I saw yesterday. He had lots of questions about the Whites.
I stop by the Happy Hill Shelter. It’s super cute, but the register book is missing. I eat a snack and move on. 

There’s a lot of walking in the woods today which I like because it’s a lot easier on the feet to walk on dirt than rock. There’s also evidence of trail maintenance in this section. In the middle there’s another road walk. Just before I get there I pass 4 nobos, 2 of whom tell me about some trail angels that live on the road walk in West Hartford. I stop by the back porch of Randy and Linda and have a soda and talk with Randy for a little bit. They have friends visiting so they are a little preoccupied. I see in their log book that the guy I leapfrogged with on Wednesday was here today. Randy tells me that he stayed the night with them last night and didn’t leave until 10am. That means he’s less than 4 hours ahead of me.
I don’t stay long and I’m back to road walking. Just when I reach the woods again, last night’s roommate appears. She was doing a day hike and ending at West Hartford. She is followed a few minutes later by a guy who looks very tired. 
I walk a few more miles and come to the second shelter of the day. It’s only 4:30 and I could go farther, but I want to see if I can get ready faster if I don’t have to pack up the tent. Also there’s another hiker here, and I would prefer not to be alone. 

This hiker has a bad cough he says from camping in the rain. He has apparently been hiking the trail for the last 14 months and has done 5300 miles. He has built a large fire in the fire ring here and says he does so every night if he can. It’s nice to have a fire.

I woke up about 5:30, used the privy, retrieved my food bag, and then made breakfast. My sheltermate began stirring around 6:15, so I got dressed and started packing. I was able to get on the trail by 7:20. A slight improvement, although I’d still like to be faster.
Today was lots of walking through fields.  One even had cows! I felt like I was back in Virginia again. The last several days there have been lots of apple trees too. I haven’t been brave enough to eat any though.
When I was in the woods, I noticed a lot of leaf confetti. Apparently something is cutting out small holes in the leaves around here, so there are a lot of leaves with holes in them and a lot of little leaf circles on the ground. I’m guessing some sort of invasive insect is at work.

The next shelter after Thistle Hill was Winturri, 12.3 miles into the day. I got there about 3:30 and stopped to get water. My goal for the day was the Lookout and it is dry, so I needed water. I signed the register while I was there.
I got to the Lookout about 5:30. It is privately owned, and they let hikers use it. There’s a primitive cabin with an observation deck on top. I set up my bedding inside and then went outside to make dinner. A day hiker came up with a dog and then a nobo thru-hiker arrived. He checked the place out and climbed up to the deck. I brought Spike and my dinner up on the deck. All these mountains are making me less afraid of heights.

The nobo was up there taking pictures. He pointed out that we can see the Whites from here. I ate dinner while the sun set. The nobo left to get some more miles in. A few minutes later I hear someone coming. I look and it’s the same nobo. He said it was too great of a place to not stay.
Once the sun was down I climbed down and then got ready for bed. I am now tucked into my sleeping bag. The nobo is still up doing his own thing. I hear mice scurrying around, so I’m going to put in my earplugs and pretend they’re not here.","Thistle Hill Shelter (VT)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623501,"I slept pretty well last night. I think wearing earplugs helps me sleep. I did wake up at 4:45 thanks to my bladder though. 
I made breakfast and then went to the observation deck to watch the sunrise. The nobo came up just as the sun was coming over the horizon. Once the sky was nice and bright, I headed back down to pack. I was back on the trail by 7:20. I think I could have been earlier if I could have done so packing while waiting for water for my breakfast to boil. Also there was 20 minutes that I was just sitting on top of the Lookout waiting for the sun to come up.
Once I said goodbye to the nobo it was a while until I saw anyone. I encountered active logging on the trail. There was only one machine which was fascinating to watch, while also being scary. After all, I didn’t know how visible I was to the guy operating the machine and it was clear that it was harvesting trees on both sides of the trail. I’m kinda surprised that there weren’t any signs warning about this. 
As I was thinking about how to tell nobos about where to expect the logging, I realized that I had passed Chateauguay Road. We have completed 1200 miles! Spike and I stopped to take a 1200 mile selfie. This also means we have less than 1000 miles left. That’s right, we’re in the triple digits. 

The first person I saw today was relieving himself while standing on the trail. I came around a corner, and boom, there he was. Fortunately he had mostly finished up when I saw him. I would expect that it would happen more often. Anyway, he looked like he belonged on a motorcycle more than on the trail. I told him about the logging and he asked me about the possibility of getting a hitch on Chateauguay Road (not good), then we both went our respective ways.

I stopped at the Stony Brook Shelter and left a note warning nobos about the logging. A little while later, I ran into a couple of nobos who had left the Yellow Deli after staying there a couple of days. I’ve heard good things about the Yellow Deli, but Spike’s Dad is coming on Saturday so I don’t need to go to a hostel at this point. 
I continue hiking and see something blue off trail. I then realize it’s a woman who has just finished relieving herself. Nothing for 122 days and now 2 on the same day? I slow my pace and try to make more noise. As I get close and say hello, she starts asking me about my hike. Suddenly another woman emerges from off trail. They both had stopped for a pee break. 
I go back to hiking and when I get to the road a woman asks me if I met her hiking partners and I confirm that I did. I then walk to a large waterfall. The trail to the waterfall is a boardwalk, and I read somewhere that it is the longest section of wheelchair accessible trail in Vermont. 

Then I walk along the lake which provides the water that is going over the falls. A man is fishing and I try to make some noise so he knows I’m coming, but he’s so focused on fishing that when I ask how the fish are biting, he about jumps out of his skin.
My original goal for today was Gifford Woods State Park. They have discounted camping rates for thru-hikers as well as running water and showers! What they don’t have is a restaurant, but if I hike another 2 miles, I can dine at an Irish pub and tent for free nearby. That becomes my new plan.
I press on to the Inn at Long Trail. It used to be on the AT, but the trail was rerouted a few years back. Once I get to Sherburne Pass Trail, I have another .5 miles to hike that are not on the AT. Several people are hiking up as I am coming down. 
At the Inn I see a guy organizing food in the back of his truck. I ask him how long he’s going out for and he responds by saying, “Spike’s Mom!” It’s the husband in the couple who is using 2 vehicles to go south by hiking north. I last saw them on Mt. Webster in the Whites. I catch up with him and then talk with a couple of Long Trail hikers who are waiting for a friend outside of the Inn. The Long Trail runs the length of Vermont from Massachusetts to Canada. For the southern 100 miles of its length, the LT and AT are together. I was only a mile from where they meet up when I detoured for food. 
I go inside the Inn and talk with the woman at the front desk. She confirms that I can tent across the street, so I go there, set up my tent and hang my food bag before crossing the road to check out the pub. 
I sit at the bar and order a Guinness and corned beef and cabbage. The couple using two vehicles comes in a little later and invite me to join their table. We trade hiking stories until the pub empties, about 8pm which is late for hikers. We say good night, and I cross the street to my tent.
I am tenting in a grassy patch, and the grass is already wet with dew. I’m going to have a soaked tent in the morning. Dinner was really good so I am considering going to breakfast in the morning and giving my tent some time to dry out.","The Lookout (VT)
","Sherburne Pass Trail/Inn at Long Trail, Killington, VT","Sep 17, Tue",15.50
Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623502,"I woke up at 4:15 and one of my earplugs had fallen out. Things seemed quiet so I decided to just put my earplugs away and go back to sleep. As soon as I do, the traffic suddenly picks up on the road. I finally get up at 5. The tent is soaked as I imagined it would be. Fortunately my sleeping bag and the other things in the tent are dry. I change clothes and pack everything up except the tent which I drape over a fence.

The restaurant opens at 7:30 for breakfast, so I go over for that. The couple I talked to last night are there, and they give me a link to follow their progress.
Given the wetness of my tent and my proximity to Walmart, I decide to take the bus into town to pick up snacks for the next few days. By the time I get done with breakfast, the next westbound bus is scheduled for 9:20, so I cross the road to make sure my tent is drying out. When I go to cross back over, the eastbound bus sees me and stops despite my attempts to wave the driver off. I hope that when he comes back westbound he stops for me.
I sit in a game room to wait for the bus and overhear a hiker trying to figure out how to get cash for the bus. I’m glad to know there will be someone else trying to catch the bus. When the time comes, we stand out by the road and the bus stops. Turns out he’s hiking the Long Trail and is planning on doing the AT next year. 
When we get to the bus terminal, I make a beeline for Walmart. I pick up my snacks, check out, and am back with 10 minutes to spare before the bus leaves again. The bus driver seems impressed.
Back at the Inn, I put away my snacks and pack up my drier but not completely dry tent. As I am packing, a van stops and drops off a couple of hikers. One is the guy from the last hostel I leapfrogged with for a while. He says that I must have passed him when he stayed in his tent one day until 3pm. The other is the guy I stayed with at the Thistle Hill Shelter. They took a shuttle from a road crossing several miles back and are going to take the bus from here to the Yellow Deli. 
I finish packing and start back up Sherburne Pass Trail at 11:15. I’m back on the AT by 11:40 and a mile later I’m on the joint AT/Long Trail. Just after the merger, I meet a couple of LT hikers who seem so excited to be on the trail. This is a huge contrast to the mostly discouraged AT nobos I’ve encountered recently.
A little while later I catch up with Sidewinder! I’ve gotten within a few hours of him, but this is the first time I’ve seen him since before the Whites. I also met his current hiking partner. We talked a little, and then I kept hiking knowing he would catch up.
A little while later I meet an LT section hiker. She’s really friendly and gives me a bunch of information about the upcoming trail, but I can only process so much. The shelter I’m aiming for has no water so I ask her where to get water. “Oh, there’s lots of water on the trail before you get there.” That’s not exactly helpful.
I get to a shelter that has a sign saying it’s the last chance for water before my goal shelter. It’s .1 miles off the trail and Guthook says it’s another 100 feet to the water. It feels farther than that. And when I get to the water, it’s difficult to collect. I wish that section hiker had told me to fill up at a brook I crossed just a little while before the turn off before the shelter because it was right on trail and much easier to collect from. But then I keep hiking and about .3 miles before Cooper Lodge, there are 2 streams that cross the trail, both flowing much better than the one at the shelter. Now I’m wishing the section hiker was more specific and the sign at the shelter hadn’t been there because now I’ve carried 2.5 liters of water uphill for several miles when I didn’t need to. 
I get to Cooper Lodge and it looks pretty sketchy and immediately decide to tent. I can see the tents set up a little further up the trail.

This shelter and tenting area are near a spur trail to Killington, the last 4,000’ mountain until after I skip down to Damascus. Sidewinder’s pack is here (we had leapfrogged a few times on the way here), so I assume he has climbed up Killington. He is talking about hiking on because he is less than 5 miles from his 500 mile mark and would like to get there today. I’ve only done 8.2 miles, but that’s pretty good considering I didn’t start until almost noon.
I set up my tent with 2 other tents and a hammock, and Sidewinder comes down from Killington, picks up his pack, and continues hiking. I tell him I’ll probably see him again within the next few days.
Once I set up, I have about 30 minutes until sunset. I grab Spike, my headlamp, and some snacks and head up the summit of Killington. While the hike was short, it was steep and required the use of my hands to climb. The hammocker and a couple of women staying in Cooper Lodge itself are also up there to see the sunset. This is the second sunset I’ve seen in 3 days. The only other sunset I’ve seen was from Rice Field Shelter just outside Pearisburg, VA. I would consider getting up to watch the sunrise, but I am not anxious to do that climb again.","Sherburne Pass Trail/Inn at Long Trail, Killington, VT

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623661,"I knew it would be cold last night, I just didn’t know how cold. I was up near the top of a mountain (the temperature drops as you go higher in elevation) and had my tent on a platform which is usually colder than the ground. I have a space blanket that I will put in the tent under my sleeping pad to reflect body heat and keep cold air from coming up underneath. I did that last night, journaled, then went to bed at 9pm. I woke up cold and had to go to the bathroom, but when I looked at the time it was only 9:45. Maybe I hadn’t even fallen asleep yet. I curled up in my sleeping bag and tried to think warm thoughts. That didn’t work, so at 10:45 I put on my puffy jacket (over a light jacket I was already wearing) and went to the bathroom. When I got back to the tent, I arranged the space blanket so that it would be under me and over me.
The problem with space blankets is that they don’t “breathe.” When I woke up this morning, the space blanket was covered with condensation and my sleeping bag was wet but I was warm.
I was the first one up at the campsite. I changed into my hiking clothes with both jackets, my hat, and gloves all on. I made a hot breakfast which was usual but even more necessary. One of the tenters left a few minutes before me and I was the second one out. I took over 2 hours to get ready. Not long after I started hiking, I came across where Sidewinder and his hiking partner had camped last night. They were still getting packed up. Sidewinder told me, “I said last night that you would pass us this morning.” So they had not made it to the 500 mile mark, but they would do so today. They passed me a few miles later and then I caught up again when they stopped at the first shelter. I stayed for a little while to have a snack and sign the register, and then got going again. I figured they would catch me again shortly, but I didn’t see them until the afternoon.
Even though the 500 mile marker isn’t a sign that I’ve completed 500 miles or have 500 miles left, I wanted to get a picture with the sign. I saw a guy sitting beside the trail and asked him how close I was to the sign. We then talked for a little while. He had planned on a thru-hike this year, but didn’t feel like he was going to make it to Katahdin before it got too cold.  He said he would continue to Hanover, NH and then come back to finish New Hampshire and Maine next year.
Less than a mile later, I saw a couple of 500 mile signs that hikers had made, and then there was the sign on the tree that I had seen numerous pictures of over the years.  I wanted a picture with that sign, and I was afraid I would miss it.  However, it was not hard to miss it, especially because there was a little kiosk type thing where you could register.  I signed the register and then tried to set up to take a selfie with the sign (I need to work on my selfie skills — having hiked with a teenager, I mostly had her do the selfies).  However, then I saw a hiker coming nobo.  He took a picture of me (“be sure to get the rhino”), and then I took a picture of him (“be sure to get the kilt”).  He was trying for a 30 mile day today with the intention of getting to Katahdin before it gets too cold and snowy.  I did not tell him about the difficulty of the Whites and Maine.  He’ll see that soon enough.
Today’s hike was relatively easy until I got to Clarendon Gorge.  The trail was steep going down into the gorge, which my knees did not appreciate at all.  There was also a climb coming out of the gorge, but it was mostly inclines rather than steps.  My knees would have preferred coming down what we went up and vice versa.
At the gorge, Sidewinder and his hiking partner showed up.  They both looked hot and tired.  It’s funny how hot it got today considering how cold it was last night.  When we got to the gorge, they decided to stay and camp along the river.  While it would have been nice to stay and swim in the river, I was about 2.5 miles from the shelter, and wanted to press on to keep on pace with meeting up with Spike’s Dad on Saturday.
There are 3 others at the shelter tonight: a couple of guys using hammocks out for a shakedown hike and a woman who I met at the last hostel (not my roommate).  The guys are hoping to come out next year and thru-hike the AT.  The woman was planning on a thru-hike initially, although she says she is getting off trail on Saturday because she has done what she wanted and now is looking to go back home and get a job.  She says she is hoping to do a “marathon” tomorrow (26.2 miles) so she asks me to be “aggressively loud” in the morning so that she gets up early.","Cooper Lodge (VT)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623662,"I woke up around 4:15 and got up about 15 minutes later.  I wasn’t “aggressively loud,” but I didn’t try to be quiet either.  My sheltermate got up about an hour after me and said she was waiting until it got more light out to start hiking.  I was on the trail by 6am, the fastest I’ve gotten out of camp since I’ve been hiking by myself.

When I began hiking, I needed my headlamp to see.  I did more banging of my trekking poles than usual because I was concerned about surprising bears, skunks, or other woodland creatures that are up in the early morning.I had only gone a half mile when I had to go to the bathroom.  I tried to ask my colon why it could not have decided to go when we were back at the shelter where there was a privy, and I did not get a response.
At this point I also had cell service, so I talked to Spike’s Dad on the phone to figure out our plans for when he comes to pick us up tomorrow.
I took my time today.  The trail was relatively easy and I had an early start, but doing an additional 4.7 miles to get to the next shelter didn’t seem like a good idea.  I stopped in the morning and had a snack by a waterfall.  In the afternoon, I had an extended break at the Little Rock Pond Shelter and a shorter break at the Big Branch Shelter.Big Branch was right on the trail, while Little Rock Pond was just off the trail.  I didn’t see Sidewinder or last night’s sheltermate pass me, although they could have while I was at Little Rock.  I did see several nobos.  Two were a couple of older guys who asked me if I was heading to Massachusetts or just out for a section.  I said, “Actually, I am heading to Georgia.”  “Oh, yeah, I keep forgetting that we are also on the AT,” one of them responded.
When I got to the shelter, I was glad I wasn’t going any further.  There appears to be something wrong with my feet.  The arches have been kind of red and burning recently.  I don’t remember when I first noticed it.  Maybe a couple of days ago when I was at the Inn at Long Trail?  Anyway, there is a creek here (I have no idea where Lost Pond is — I haven’t found it), and I would like to soak my feet, but I don’t really have the time to do that.  Maybe I should have when I was getting water.  Anyway, whatever is going on with my feet, it is much worse today than it has been.
I tried to hang a bear bag, and have just not had any luck with any of the trees here and I was tired and wanted to get off of my feet.  I have my food hanging from the shelter.  I hope there are no bears in the area.  I am pretty sure I heard one run away from me yesterday morning.  There was a shelter just south of here in Vermont where a bear *destroyed* the privy (rumor is that someone couldn’t finish their dinner, so they dumped it into the privy).  Anyway, they passed a law in Vermont that you have to “properly” store all food, so in addition to not having bears, I am hoping there are no ranger-types who show up.  So far I am alone in the shelter, and no one is camping nearby.
So, Spike’s Dad comes tomorrow and is planning on staying 5 nights in Vermont.  We had talked about doing some camping together, but that just sounds like too much work to figure out the logistics for that, so instead I’m planning on just doing day hikes and then he will come out for one.  However, I am looking at the road crossings coming up, and there is a 19 mile stretch without a road crossing.  I don’t understand this because it feels like I have been crossing roads about every 5 miles recently.  Anyway, I have been staring this for the last 30 minutes without anything changing, and I guess we’ll just deal with that when we get there.  How my feet look and feel in the morning will also determine what happens.","Minerva Hinchey Shelter (VT)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623663,"I did not have any visitors, bear or otherwise, to the shelter last night.  Unlike 2 nights ago when it was so cold, I was actually pretty warm, and had to stick my feet out of the sleeping bag because they were basically on fire.  They do not feel significantly better this morning than they did last night.

I waited until the last possible minute to put on my shoes, and then started hiking up Baker Peak.  At the top I have service and call Spike’s Dad.  The plan was for him to pick me up at VT 11/30 around 4:30pm, but there is another road crossing that is closer to me, so I give him instructions to pick me up there instead around 1pm.
I am in significant pain today.  It’s the worst when I first get up after stopping for a snack or something, but pretty much unless I am walking on flat ground (of which there is very little on the trail), every step creates pain.  I don’t know anything about bed sores, but I think my feet look and feel like they have pressure sores that have not opened yet.
I stop by a shelter that is on the trail and leave a note in the register that I am likely getting off trail.  I don’t know if Sidewinder is ahead of me or behind me, but SC has his number if I need it.  I would like to say good-bye, but I do not see him today.
I cross Peru Peak and then Styles Peak before heading downhill to the parking lot at Mad Tom Notch.  Occasionally I start to tear up as I think about getting off trail.  As I come down Styles, I begin to run into day hikers coming up the mountain to enjoy a beautiful Saturday.  Several ask me how I am doing and I just tell them that I am great even though my feet are in pain and I want to cry because I’m going to have to get off the trail.  I keep my mind busy by thinking about next year.  Maybe I can get back on and finish what I have left.
When I reach Mad Tom Notch, I have completed 1,258.8 miles of the trail with 933.2 still to complete.  Spike’s Dad is waiting for us just before the road because he wants to do part of the trail with us.
The first thing I do when I get to the car is take off my shoes.  We drive to the hotel in Manchester Center.  I expected that I would cry, but I don’t.  I take a shower and then we go out for burgers.  This is it.  I’m done.  But it doesn’t feel real.","Lost Pond Shelter (VT)

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623681,"It has been just over a week since I got off trail and just under a week since I got home.  In that time I have seen a primary care physician, a podiatrist, and a dermatologist about my feet.  The PCP thought that I had a bad case of athlete’s foot.  The other two did not know what it was but pretty much said it was not athlete’s foot.  Anyway, my feet are looking a lot better after doing a lot less walking on them.  Now my feet just hurt all over and my toes feel like they’ve been shot with novocaine.
The living room looks like it has been hit with a hiking gear tornado.  Today’s job was to clean my pack.  I scrubbed it down in the tub.  It took 2 rounds of soap and 4 rinses.
I also have been trying to figure out what clothes I own that fit.  I lost 35ish pounds on the trail (I’m not sure of the exact number — Spike’s Dad gave away our bathroom scale while I was gone), so pretty much everything I was wearing is now too big.  I still have clothes from before I broke my ankle (and gained weight), but none of them are too small.  I’m not looking to get new clothes, though.  If there is one thing I learned on the trail is that I have the ability to wear the same clothes for 100 days straight. Also, I am not sure how successful I will be staying this size when I am not hiking every day while carrying 30 pounds on my back.
I figured that I would need smaller clothes and bigger shoes, but my feet do not appear to have changed all that much.  I think I went from an 8 to an 8.5.  I will need new shoes eventually, though, because I either wore the shoes I had until they fell apart or gave them to my sister.
I thought I would cry or at least feel depressed.  I feel pretty good, although I am not exactly doing anything.  I do a lot of staring out the window. I haven’t quite figured out what to do with myself if I’m not hiking.  I have plenty of things to do, just no motivation to do not hiking-related things yet.
I do want to fix up this blog eventually.  The mileage is off about 11 miles, so I need to figure that out.   I also want to add photos to all the entries.  I still have entries from 2017 and 2018 to post as well!  It was good for me to write something every day and just post it without editing for hours.  I am bothered by the inconsistent verb tenses, but it was an important practice for me to post without getting everything perfect first.

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625649,"This is the last entry for my 2019 AT hike.  I am returning to finish the AT later this year.  I have begun the Trail Journals blog for that hike if you would like to follow along with this year’s hike. 

My feet are doing much better, thank you for asking.  After about a month home the sores on the soles of my feet healed and my feet stopped peeling like crazy.  I still have a couple of toes on my right foot that tingle like they are “asleep,” but they are getting better, and I think they will eventually come back.  I started running in mid-November, and I am training for a half-marathon in April.  So far the running is going well, and I think I’m a little faster than I was last year at this time.  I am also practicing yoga regularly.  I would like to get back to swimming and strength training, I just haven’t figured out where to add those in yet. 

Getting off the trail early, I felt like I wasn’t able to get to that point where I figured out what I want to do with the rest of my life or even the next few years.  Fortunately, Spike’s Dad just got a new job that came with a pay raise, so I am currently keeping house.  While I was on the trail some of the siding on our house fell off and squirrels moved in, which means I have been trying to find a contractor to do repairs and evict the squirrels.  I am hoping that after another 933.2 miles on the AT I will have a better idea of what I want to do next.  The one thing I do know is that I want to stay in Michigan. 

Anyway, this will be my last post for this hike.  Please follow along at my AT 2020 journal.  Oh, I almost forgot: Spike and I have been doing some hiking on the North Country Trail (NCT) since we’ve been back.  I have finally completed my NCT 2017 journal, and I am currently working on getting the 2018 one caught up.  I plan to have it completed by the time I start back on the AT.  I will do a 2020 NCT journal, and we will try to complete the 2020 #hike100NCT challenge.  Our 2019 NCT hikes will eventually be catalogued there.

Spike's Mom,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/630830,"One year ago, I hobbled down the Appalachian Trail with sores on my feet to Mad Tom Notch near Manchester Center, VT and abandoned my thru-hike attempt.  I had hiked 1258.8 miles over the course of 127 days.  
Yeah, I know that I said that my last entry was going to be the last one for this journal, but that was before COVID-19 turned everything upside down.  I have spent the last 127 days posting each day’s Trail Journal entry from the year before on Twitter (@hikewithspike).  It has been great to relive that the time on the trail and now I think it is time that I reflect a little given that I was not able to get back on trail this year to finish up those last 933.2 miles.

Some updates: Sidewinder did end up finishing the trail sometime during the winter. He then started going north again, and last I heard, he had switched over to the Continental Divide Trail.

I saw the couple who was shuttling themselves along the trail using two cars again just after I got off the trail.  They were staying at the same hotel we were staying at in Manchester Center.  They were doing a complicated flip-flop and they completed the trail in November.

Spike’s Cousin turned 18, got her driver’s license, finished high school, and recently got married.  I was able to go out a few months ago and see her for a few hours.  I’m still waiting for her to figure out a way to share her pictures with me.

I recently got an email from the sobo I met at the hostel in Norwich, VT.  He told me he finally finished around the end of June.  In the email he said something about hoping my feet got better.  So apparently I was having feet issues at least a week before I got off trail.  I had so many different ailments that came and went while I was hiking, I didn’t really keep track.

My feet are now healed.  They peeled for about a month and after about 4 months feeling was restored to all of my toes.

I have gained back most of the weight I lost on trail, but I am happy that it came back more slowly than it came off and that I am still 5 pounds less than I was before I started the trail.  I have a lot of aches and pains, but that’s probably just getting old.

I have been wondering, if you had told me a year ago, “Oh, by the way, there’s going to be a pandemic next year and you won’t be able to finish,” what would I have done?  Would I have tried to push on?  Would that have just made things worse?  Could I have taken a few days off while Spike’s Dad was visiting VT to stay off my feet and then gone back and tried to take my time, taking off my shoes and putting my feet up when I could?  I talked to SD about this the other day and he looked at me like I had two heads.  “Are you kidding?  You could barely walk.  Your feet looked horrible.”  Even with that I still have my doubts and wonder if maybe I’m just a wimp.

Looking back, I do think that the flip-flop we did was accidentally a good one.  We were able to start the trail with a bubble and meet a lot of cool people.  We ended up being in Maine at the height of blueberry season and right at the end of mosquito season.  We got to see a bunch of people again who we had met earlier in our hike.  We completed Maine and the White Mountains, two of the most beautiful (and difficult) sections of trail.
I had been overly optimistic about how many miles I could do and about my ability to develop trail legs.  It looks like if I had wanted to go north, summit Katahdin in late September (my original goal), and then flip south, I should have started at the south end of Shenandoah National Park rather than 400 miles further south in Damascus.  However, like I said, I’m glad we did what we did.If I were to have the opportunity to do the entire trail and start any time I liked, I would want to approach Katahdin from the south, but I don’t know that I would start in Georgia.  Starting at Springer in the cold of March with a bazillion other people all giving each other Norovirus does not sound appealing to me.   I think my preference would be to start around Harper’s Ferry in late April or early May and head north.  Once I completed Katahdin, then I would go south from Harper’s.  Maybe that will be my plan for 2029…",,View Entry,"Sep 21, Mon",0
