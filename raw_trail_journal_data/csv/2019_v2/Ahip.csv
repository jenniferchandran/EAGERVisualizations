Ahip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607247,"So as I sit in the cold and snow, I am dreaming about next year's hike. I will retire sometime this year an now I will have the time for an adventure this long. When I brought up the idea with my wife she was very supportive of the hike. She knows I love doing it although I'm pretty sure she thinks I'm nuts. There is also the fact that I turn 60 this year and I think Joan feels that it is bothering me, but I don't think of it really. So I will spend this year working on my physical conditioning, planning and fine tuning my gear and maybe selling off some of the stuff that was great for weekend hiking but not as appropriate for one with this many miles.",,Section Hike on the AT,"Feb 21, Thu",0
Ahip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607271,"So as we are in the last few weeks of winter here in Canada and I'm sort of still haphazardly thinking about next year's hike I have started to go through my gear list and try to determine the suitability of my gear for a month long 300ish mile hike. Now in my defense when I was purchasing this stuff my hiking focus was different than it is today. My son lived in Roanoke Va. and I was mostly planning 3-4 day hikes in Virginia as well as the same length hikes here in Ontario. 
While day hiking in Virginia I last summer I hiked the Dragons Tooth Trail, the Andy Lane Trail to Tinker's Cliffs, and McAfee Knob back to back to back, and that my friends is when the lure of the Appalachian Trail firmly got its teeth into me. Now that I have been forced into retirement I have decided to embrace it because time is the one thing you cannot buy.
So now I need to adjust my gear, sell some and replace it with different things all in the quest of a 30 pound pack. It won't be easy. I'm 59 years old and I have never been a fan of deprivation. So here we go (this will probably continue for a few posts and suggestions are welcome.
1.  Pack: So here is one I'm going to be stubborn about. My first good day hiking pack was an Osprey Stratos 34. The only thing I don't like about this pack is I can't reach the waterbottles in the side pouches without removing my pack and because of this I wasn't drinking enough. I fixed this by using a bladder...Problem solved. When I went looking for a multi day pack my choice was an Atmos 65 by Osprey. The side pockets have dual entry points so I can reach the bottles. This is not an overly light pack at 4.4 pounds. What this pack does is carry weight extremely comfortably for me. I have carried 35-38 pounds multiple days with absolutely no discomfort. So the Pack stays.
2.  Tent: Now it will start to get ugly. When I was doing research about tents there was always the sawoff of price/durability/weight. I finally ended up with an MSR Hubba Hubba NX. It was more durable looking than lighter weight tents in the MSR line and cheaper than a Big Agnes. One thing: not all tents that are available in the US are easy to find in Canada and buying them online adds Duty and Taxes to our dollar exchange rate so they are just too much money for what you get. Let me say I like this tent! At 3lbs and 4ozs it is fine to carry for a few days, better if you are sharing the weight with a partner, not so much for 300 miles it pains me to say. So I'm selling the tent. What I have decided on is a ZPacks Duplex and for the price of it God I hope I like it!
3.  Sleeping Bag: Here is one I really struggled with the price of (this stuff is expensive with the Canadian Peso). I bought a Marmot Sawtooth 15. Negatives: Heavy at 2lbs 7ozs, but again not bad over 3-4 days. Not very compressable as I can barely get it into a 10l compression bag. Positives: Dang this thing is warm. I used it in Algonquin Park at 0C and had to open it up to cool down. This is one I an having trouble with because sticker shock on REALLY good bags is nasty. I am leaning toward a Mountain Engineering Megalite bag. I'm pretty broad around the shoulders and most mummy bags are tight for me so I will like the extra room.
4. Sleeping Pad:  This one is a no brainer, I spent the money and got a Therm-a-rest Neo Air Xlite regular length pad and I love it. 12 ounces is a bonus.
5. Hiking poles: I use Black Diamond Cork Ergo Grip poles in aluminum. I have used these for a ton of miles. I have jammed these things between rocks, under roots etc. where I'm sure I would have snapped a carbon fibre pole. These will also be my tent poles. One word of advice I heard from Bigfoot on you tube. If you are short (I'm 5'7"") buy women's poles. They are lighter and you don't need the extra length. I will have to see if they are long enough for tent poles but I believe they will be.

Ahip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607762,"I know most of my gear is pretty standard stuff so it might be kind of boring to hikers but I am hoping that this journal will allow my non hiking friends to follow along with my life on the trail. 
When I started buying gear my wife, Joan thought maybe I was obsessing a little too much over how much things weighed but as the pile started to grow it becomes obvious how the little things add up.
Last year when I was getting ready for my Algonquin Park hike Joan and I spent many afternoons hiking a local trail with me carrying my fully loaded pack. I must admit we got more than a few odd looks from people out walking the trails with nothing but a water bottle wondering what is that guy carrying?
So on with more of my gear list for the AT.
Pillow: Sea to Summit Aeros Ultralight. This might be the best 2.1oz in my pack. It fits inside my coffee mug in my pack and makes all the difference between a good nights sleep or a bad sleep. I absolutely love it.
GPS: Garmin inReach. So a lot of people might feel this is an unnessessary piece of gear on the AT but Joan asked me to get one last year for hiking in Algonquin Park in Ontario. Algonquin is much more remote and a lot less travelled than large parts of the Appalachian Trail. There a few things I really like about it. It Bluetooths to my phone so I can see the maps and text using my phone while sending and receiving texts through GPS satellites when I don't have cell service. I can drop cookie crumbs so my wife can follow my progess from home. You can subscribe monthly so if you only use it a few times a year you only pay for it as required and they offer an insurance policy for rescue costs if heaven forbid you need them. The only real negative is, it weighs 8 oz but Garmin came out with a mini shortly after I bought this one.
Cookset: Again this is pretty standard stuff. I use a Pocket Rocket 2 stove; it's compact, fairly light at 2.6oz and it boils water quickly. For my cookpot I use a Snow Peak Trek 700 Titanium cookset. It is light, tough, and the right size for me. I can fit my stove, a small bic lighter, and a small fuel canister inside it making it efficient for packing.
Mug: GSI Infinity Backpackers Mug. Now this is one of those luxury items for me...if you can call a plastic mug a luxury item. I know some people will use their pot as a mug but this works for me. I really enjoy coffee in the morning. It has a neoprene insulating cover and a Sippy lid it also doubles as a measuring cup. It weighs 3.5oz.
Spoon: Optimus Titanium Long Spoon. Other than a small pocket knife it is the only utensil I carry. The long handle lets me eat out of a zip lock bag or Mountain House meal without getting food all over my hands. Its also great for getting peanut butter from the jar. :)
So that covers most of the essentials and I will get into the clothing and miscellaneous stuff in another post. Thank you for reading. Any questions or input are always welcome.",,Section Hike on the AT,"Mar 08, Fri",0
Ahip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608056,"I have spent the last couple of weeks fine tuning my gear list and finding replacements for some of my older stuff, mainly clothing and shoes. While I have been doing all of this I had set myself a goal of a 30 pound pack weight with 4 days of food and 2 litres of water. A couple of factors made this a really tough goal to hit; my pack is on the heavy side so the first thing I did was ditch the brain (I will miss the extra pockets at least for a while). I carry a Garmin inReach GPS; it weighs 8 ounces and it is a bit redundant with my phone and Guthooks guide App, but it gives Joan comfort being able to follow along from home and knowing I can comunicate even with no cell service. I used lighterpacks.com to breakdown and chart all my gear. I was suprised to see that clothing was such a large part of my load although Crocs account for almost a pound by themselves. Here is a link to my pack list https://lighterpack.com/r/e9i7... . It contains everything I can think of (up til now). I don't think I made it, my base weight is 18.2 lbs so I can see my pack ending up in the 31-32 pound range fully loaded. May the wind always be at your back!",,View Entry,"Mar 14, Thu",0
Ahip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608610,"So today I ordered my new Zpacks Duplex tent, and now the wait begins. Between this tent and my new sleeping bag, I have pretty much finalized my gear for next years AT hike(s). Speaking of the sleeping bag I will order the Western Mountaineering Megalite next week but it has a 6-8 week delivery time here in the Big Smoke (Toronto) so for any hikes this summer I will use my 40 degree bag. A couple of really cool things about this bag are that Western Mountaineering offers an overfill option where they pump in 2 extra ounces of fill (which is more than it sounds) and that takes it from a 30 degree F bag to around a 25 degree. It also has continuous baffles so you can move the fill from top to underside and vice versa to adjust how warm the bag is. Win-Win.The other new and I mean new piece of gear I got is a pair of Technica Plasma S hiking shoes. They just came on the market and they use ski boot heat molding technology. Which is to say they heat em up and mold them to your feet. They are so comfortable!!! I am just going to wear them enough to make sure there are no issues with them and then put them away until next spring.Once I get my last two pieces of new stuff delivered it will be time to get on the trail to shake all my preparations down. I have looked at my gear list again and again, other than adding a couple of small things like lens cleaner and a glasses case there is nothing I really am will to cut back on. It will be a tad heavier than I wanted but that is mostly in clothing that if the weather goes bad I will be happy I have. that's all for now and Happy Hiking.",,View Entry,"Mar 22, Fri",0
Ahip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608897,"So my original plan was to do a large section hike in the spring of 2020 hopefully from the Springer Mountain Approach Trail to Hot Springs NC. That seems to have morphed into maybe stringing a bunch of section hikes together and doing the whole AT over a few years. I have spent some time figuring out the logistics of the first few hikes, but now I have come to find out that I may well get 2 extra weeks of holidays that I wasn't really expecting.Well reading everyone's journals has gotten me antsy to get on the trail, ANY TRAIL, but the reality is I probably won't be able to do more than a weekend hike or two until late June. So now I have planned a hike from Bland VA to 311 Catawba VA (just outside of Roanoke). This will give me a chance to test out my new tent and other gear over a 118 mile hike. It will also give me a jump on my AT dreams and maybe I won't be such a noob next spring!",,View Entry,"Mar 26, Tue",0
Ahip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609888,"I have been avidly reading hiker's journals and following them on their journeys, but it makes it especially hard knowing I won't be on the trail for a while yet. I have been following Wow's journal closely and it's a great read. He is currently doing the section I will do this summer so I'm watching for tips! My new tent should be delivered to Louisiana today or tomorrow but my son won't be bringing it to me until early June. The trails around here are just starting to thaw out and will be a little muddy but I hope to get out fairly often now. I have swapped out a few things and fine tuned my pack so now I want to load it up and start upping mileage in preparation for this summer's hike. I think ten days will give me a pretty good feel for next springs hike other than the weather difference. My summer pack will be quite a bit lighter due to a summer sleeping bag and way less clothing.Because I am starting my hike a little later than most due to only hiking the first 300 miles clothing will be the hardest part to figure out so I regularly check the current weather on the trail to look for temperature trends. I don't want to bring too much clothing but then again I definitely don't want to not have enough. Everything else is set and I will figure food out as I go due to what is available on the trail.",,View Entry,"Apr 08, Mon",0
Ahip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617379,"So today I am doing my final preparations for my section hike in Virginia. I just have to spray some of my equipment and clothing with Permethrin and double check all my gear and I should be ready to go.Friday I will make the 12 hour drive from the Big Smoke to Roanoke. On Saturday I will be picked up and shuttled to Bland Va., kicked out and told to walk back! The plan is a little fluid depending on how I am feeling, mileage, etc. I can bail out at Catawba 311 or continue on to Troutville.One thing that I want to make sure of is that I enjoy the experience. I don’t want to miss things because I feel pressed for time.I feel that I have prepared everything as best I can and because it is summer my pack should be at a manageable weight even though I am sure I will end up taking things that I don’t really need. This will be my longest hike so far so I am sure mistakes will be made! The trick will be to learn from this experience so when I start out again next April from Amicalola there will be less worrying.The only concern I have really at this point is water availability on the trail. I hiked the Virginia big 3 last year during the same time period as 3 day hikes so I know it will be hot and humid. I have gone through my Guthooks app and know there are going to be long stretches of no water in this section. My plan is to fill up every chance I get and maybe carry a little extra until I get comfortable with water availability.This should be my last pre hike entry and the next one should be with some mileage under my belt “yay me"". This is my first time trying to make a journal entry from my phone so please excuse any spelling and grammatical errors. I have fat fingers!I would like to thank you for following me on my journey.",,View Entry,"Jun 26, Wed",0
