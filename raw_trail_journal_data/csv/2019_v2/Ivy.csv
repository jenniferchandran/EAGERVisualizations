Ivy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581992,"The AT has been a dream my entire adult life.  I did the Georgia section 10 years ago with 3 friends and always knew I would be back but wanted to attempt a thru-hike.  I was given the book, ""Odessa"" by a woman my age (60) who had completed the trail a few years ago solo.  I am so inspired by her courage, determination and willingness to share her journey with me.  I will be leaving my current position next summer so the time has come that I can actively start planning for this journey!!  I enjoy blogging so look forward to sharing my journey.","

Ivy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581993,"I hiked the Camino trail in Spain last summer with my good friend, Cleo, and I am hoping she will join me for this journey as well.  I met Cleo in Kuwait 7 years ago.  We were both in education but met at the desert bike club!!  She has expressed an interest and is at the same stage in life where she has time for this trek.  I am willing to go it alone but really hope she will join!!!","

Ivy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/581994,I have been working abroad for the past 7 years in education and have seen the world.  I will be returning to my Colorado home next summer and look forward to being based back at my home.  I will always travel as I have been blessed with the wanderlust gene but have a yearning to be back home close to my loved ones.  I will be a grandma for the first time this year so that is a huge pull to return home as well!  I am an outdoor enthusiast and I am constantly thinking of the next adventure.  This journey will be my biggest feat if I am lucky enough to complete.  I am beyond excited to begin planning!,"

Ivy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582763,I am currently finishing my contract in the Cayman Islands ending late June.  I sold my car so I am walking to work and everywhere else.  It feels good to have the AT in my head as I am walking so much every single day!  I originally thought I would begin the trail in March 2019 but I think now I will consider January/February.  I will be in-between jobs so now is the time.  My Father lives in Georgia so I might beg him to be my support crew on this journey!  I like the idea of starting early and then not having to fight for shelter space etc.  Still ruminating at this point but nice to have this journal to write down my thoughts!,"
