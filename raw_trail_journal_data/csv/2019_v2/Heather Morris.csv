Heather Morris,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616169,"Starting at Sunrise Overlook at Culver’s Gap, we set out with 50lbs in our pack and some company from my dad and stepmom. We saw some birds nests and a deer, as well as, lots of red efts. We at first started going the wrong way but we luckily met Flatlander and he pointed us in the right direction. We went about 11 miles to high point shelter and it took about 7.5 hours at a pace of 2 miles per hour. Some sights were Sawmill Pond, Mountain Creek, saw the high point monument, and we went up the observation tower at high point. We met Danger Boy, A grumpy guy, and Goat at high point ranger station. Got our passports stamped here and a free can of soda. We ate dinner with some older gentleman section hiking as well as another guy finishing his in Vermont. Have some bad blisters. For dinner we had burritos (not very good). Camped in between two streams near the shelter. Counter 2 road crossings, 4 creeks, 28 logs.","Sunrise Overlook

Heather Morris,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616645,"Today was a long day! Pulled out our first 12 miles with our incredibly heavy and huge packs. We started off a little late, getting on the trail around 8:30. A lot of blisters with my too small shoes. Traveled along boards laid out through swamps and wet areas while seeing a ton of frogs. For lunch we decided to check out the Jim Murray ""secret shelter"". This beautiful property had a cabin for hikers to recharge their phone and obtain water from the pump right outside. As we were finishing up our tuna packets and getting ready to move on, a chubby donkey came out of no where! This ended up in a 30 minute detour from our plan to leave as we took pictures with the donkey and petted him. Finally Kara pulled me away and we headed to the shelter. This walk was a slow painful walk and we eventually stopped at the Wallkill Bridge to eat our afternoon snack and redress my banadages. We were going to try to go for a quick swim, since it was so hot out, but ended up getting very muddy. We got back on the trail and traveled through Wallkill National Wildlife Refuge. Here we encountered many birds, a small fawn, and some snakes. Our final .6 mile stretch was the worst! Straight up hill 0.2 miles was our last water source for the night. We filled up water as I was in tears about the pain of my feet. Kara, being the trooper she is, managed to get me to travel to the shelter. This was another 0.4 miles straight up with our humongous, water filled packs. We got our pack set up and met some new friends! We ate dinner with Flatlander and Blue. During the night we had some visitors walk through camp including a bear and a deer. Luckily, Kara and I both have to pee at the same time in the middle of the night and could make sure either of us weren't eaten.","High Point Shelter

Heather Morris,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616647,"After a restless night of sleeping, we ate breakfast down by the shelter. We met new people including Treadmill, Rabbit, and Greyhound who are also flip floppers. We packed up to leave and again climb a hill with too very large packs. My climbing was more like a hobble as my feet felt like shockwaves of pain were going through. I will later see at Aunt Nancy's that in addition to the two huge blisters I as taking care of, my pinky toe had disappeared under layers of blisters and my one toe nail was falling off. Fun times. As I hobbled and Kara hunch backed her way through the Jersey hills we made a call to stop at Glenwood 565 to treat our injuries and get me a new pair of shoes. Luckily  Aunt Nancy was extremely flexible and came to pick us up. We had a wonderful nero and zero day with her, got some great food, and continued on the trail!","Pochuck Mountain Shelter

Heather Morris,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616651,"Today was the day of boardwalks, Heaven hill farms and icecream, Stairway to Heaven, and pretty much revisiting Vernon. Beautiful sunny day, hot going up the stairway to Heaven, but worth the view. Kara really enjoyed the turkey vultures. We enjoyed our lunch at a beautiful bridge with a river. Here we met Chocaholic and Duke. We spent the rest of the day up on the ridge and stopped at the Waywayanda Ranger Station to fill up on water. We unfortunately missed the open times but Aunt Nancy was nice enough to bring us in the morning where we could get our passports stamped. Aunt Nancy picked us up at Longhouse or Lakehouse Rd and we enjoyed a nice cozy bed and wonderful dinner!","Glenwood 565

Heather Morris,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616668,"Dropped back off in time to say hello to Duke and run into Chocoholic. So glad to have run into them. Chocoholic filled the hours with her incredible stories of accomplishments she had achieved such as ultramarathons, ironmans, hiking southern portion of the Appalachian Trail, backpacking throughout the world, living in different countries, gear advice, and so much more. She's an incredibly positive and bubbly character that has now turned into one of our closest friends on the trail and we would not know what we would do without her. Today was the day of the Bellvale Creamery where we saw Duke eating massive sunday. We all went in and of course got ourselves some waffle cones and icecream and sat down at the picnic tables. Here we became the animals at a zoo as onlookers lined up for icecream and stared at our still overly large packs, with Duke's also large pack (he had a huge tupperware container), and Chocoholics minimalist base weight of 13lb's pack. We also smelled pretty bad probably. We waited for Duke to recieve his pizza delivery to the icecream place then headed up just in time to meet J^2 (our second closest friend on the trail) as his wife dropped him off. With icecream in our bellies, there was 2ish miles to the shelter. We got there set up and were joined by weekend warriors (father and a son, and two guys who apparently like to talk about couples massages at 11:30pm while smoking weed). The group we have is a lot of fun and had a fun first pack shakedown by chocaholic. Today we saw a baby snake, big snake, and toads. We heard red eyed vireos, ovenbirds, hermit thrushes, eastern wood peewees, and eastern phoebes.","Longhouse Road
",Wildcat Shelter,"Jun 08, Sat",10.20
Heather Morris,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616669,"Due to problems with bears at Fingerboard shelter, there was too large of a gap to the next shelter (20ish miles). We heard a bear had ripped through a mans tent, grabbed the backpack, and got the food sack out in day light as he was setting up his camp. So instead we headed out to do more rock scrambling like the day before, putting our poles on our packs, and almost rock climbing up the mountains. These were not easy in the slightest bit but were not ""death inducing"" (as Duke has said) as yesterdays that were one wrong step and you would fall off a cliff and die (maybe, hopefully not). Beautiful mountain Laurel everywhere and gaain it was a pleasure to hike with Chocaholic. We took lunch near water again and continued on. As we were walking a 5 lined skink exploded out from the leaves and tried to get up my pants leg. Another afternoon snack wwtih Duke and Chocaholic by a lake covered in mountain laurel.  A lot of steep up and downs after this that Chocaholic blew past us with. At one point, Duke, Kara, and I, were all red faced at the bottom struggling to breathe and dripping sweat while she steadily climbed to the top and exclaimed ""this is fun!"". Kara and I both agree that this was not our ideal moment of fun and Duke got very annoyed to see there were more uphills. As we finally went over the last uphill, there was an even steeper down hill on rocks, leaves, and boulders. Kara gracefully ran down the mountain as Duke, Chocoholic and I struggled and looked down in amazement that Kara was not rolling down. At the bottom we encountered our first trail magic (jugs of water) and J^2! Chocoholic then gave us our first trail names that we have decided to be reserved for use by only her! I got Bambi (Of course all I talk about is animals and I told her my mom said I have cow eyes, Chocoholic compromised at deer eyes). Kara became Swiss Miss after she decided not to go with my suggestion of leiderhosen lady with her sock liners, braids, and egg cap. Chocoholic recommended Swiss Miss. We also said goodbye to Duke. He was only doing a section hiker and was still in high school! We may see him again in Vermont!","Wildcat Shelter

Heather Morris,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616672,"Said a sad goodbye to our wonderful trail angel Aunt Nancy who we think should be trail named Mary Poppins because she had everything for my ailments, problems, and goodies! We miss her and Maggie <3. On our way up the hill we got stuck behind a field trip of second graders. For Kara we lucked out and got out second dose of trail magic, a donut! Beautiful grassy meadows through the woods overlooking a lake to the lemon squeeze. Kara and I barely fit but we did it while walking sideways and while the second graders cheered ""her pack is to big"". Immediately after the lemon squeeze was a rock climbing maneuver. With second graders behind us, I tried with someone giving me a hand but found that with the weight of my pack and my height I could not reach over. Kara tried next and was almost climbed over by a second grader. We ended up taking the blue blaze trail and were called ""losers"" by the boy that climbed over Kara. We watched a girl take on the blue blaze scramble with caterpillars on her hands because the teacher would not take them for her. We climbed up those and Kara made the wise decision of dropping our packs there and going back to try again...and we were successful! With a reach with both hands around a gigantic tree root and a sideways turn with knees pressed against the rocks, you were able to launch yourself up and over. Again, fun times! We proceeded to keep walking hrough more meadows, ferns, blueberry bushes, and on top of ridges. It started misting and drizzling but not too bad. At the fingerboard, bear problem shelter, we saw a deer.We made it to T_____? park pavilion where we ate lunch in the rain. As we climbed back up and down hills we encountered many red efts and a marbled salamander. After hours of walking through the pouring rain, one time getting lost, one Kara fall, and our clothes totally drenched even with rain gear we made it to the shelter. We thought we were going to have to make dinner in the rain BUT we are smart and set up my tent to try to put some stuff under then set up Kara's rain tarp and sat in our wetted down rain gear to cook dinner. After we set up her hammock. As we got water for the next day, we saw the one and only Chocoholic! We were very excited. She pointed us to the water and we proceeded to nail our first bear hang. With no branches and pouring rain, it took us about an hour to sort of suspend our bags between two trees. Other people just tied them to a tree, we felt that the bear would take theirs first. We stopped by the shelter to say hi and met another high schooler out for a section hike, a guy whose tent we passed floating in a pool of water earlier, J^2 (he just always seems to appear), Nuke or Newt (still not sure), and Sir Nick. Then we went to bed to finally get dry and warm.Note on People:Chocoholic- Finishing at KatahdinJ^2- flip-flop from PaSir Nick- Flip flop from JerseyNuke: guest hiking, thru hiked a different year","Aunt Nancys

Heather Morris,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616676,"Dried out tent a little with the wind over night. Stayed dry otherwise. Had a 3am excursion to get fruit snacks down for Kara with pouring rain and night! Last night, I forgot to mention, it was foggy and we were eating dinner and a turkey appeared! As we were eating breakfast this morning, the turkey reappeared and walked through camp, almost into the shelter, and back out into the fog. Kara fondly named him Tyrone and we figured he guarded our food from bears last night. We saw him a few more times, patrolling. No one else noticed the turkey. SO maybe we were seeing things. Chocoholic left early, as did J^2, but we saw Sir Nick and Nuke for most of the day. Trail was steep and rocks were slippery in  many sections. As we climbed up over West Mountain, you could see the NYC skyline. As we were taking pictures, Kara yelled: Don't move, snake. 4 feet away was the largest rattlesnake (Timber) I have ever seen with 10 rattles. He was not rattling and eyes were cloudy indicating a shed soon. Very pretty but we quickly moved on to be spooked by a skin draped close to the trail. As we maneuvered down some slippery rocks, we became the red eft rescue team as we picked up all sizes and placed them off the trail (at laest 20-50 per day). Cool to see bear moutain and monument from across the way but were not excited to hike up it. The time did come and we did hike up some steep sections with lots of rock work stairs. We sat in a beautiful wooden bench and overlooked a rock with crater like depressions, out to the spots we had just taken pictures at about 2 hours earlier. We hiked to the monument and treated ourselves to a soda. We then walked down the beautiful path of Bear Mountain towards the inn and saw a black rat snake and waterfall. As we got to the inn, we called ""Grandpa"" at the Bear Mountain Bridge Motel. He picked us up and showed us our beautiful room. He told us plenty of stories and introduced us to his beautiful and sweet pit bull Bella. (I almost put her in my pack). After showers and laundry, we were told that someone who knew Swiss Miss was coming. So off went Grandpa to get these hikers that we were usure if we had met. Turns out we hadn't and that there's another Swiss Miss, who is pretty famous (especially after having a bear come into the shelter with her). That is when we met Dairy King, Tiawana (definitely not the right spelling), and  Papa Smurph. They invited to us to dinner at a BBQ place next door (Very good for Fort Montgomery, NY). After we came back to hang out with Grandpa, who showed me the trees we fell and we shared stories of woodsmen, Montana, and the trail. Dairy King showed us professional stretches using a traffic cone (not really, he also kept trying to put his foot behind his head as we all laughed at him or with him, whatever you prefer). Very fun evening and traded contact info and are still hearing from them!","William Brien Shelter

Heather Morris,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616678,"After realizing my Pop pop took my brother and I up the what-seems-like million steps, we finally left any trail that I would recognize from this point forward besides Mt. Washington. Weather was decent and had an easier day. We slept in and got coffee at the breakfast place next door. It was a very hard goodbye with Grandpa and Bella. I was allowed to sit in the back of the truck (brought out specially for us) so I could sit with Bella ( I love her). We promised to send them post cards! Highly recommend the motel! Hiked through the zoo and saw our first bears! (we only heard the night time bear at Pochuck).  Got out passports stamped and met up with a college friend, Jake Craven. He bought us lunch and brought us back to his house that overlooked the Hudson River, Bear Mountain Bridge, and eagles! We met his father and he told us about his Uncle who was the 35th or 36th person to hike the trail. In order to hike across the bridge, you were supposed to pay 10 cents and if you didn't have it you had to prove that you had none by emptying your entire pack! After a quick resupply, Jake dropped us off and we congratulated him on his brand new engagement and good luck for his move to California with his new fiancee. The walk over Bear Mountain bridge was beautiful! The hike up the mountain after was not. Chauncy, a very famous hiker, blew past us with other in-shape- small-pack hikers. Hiked for a while and met Brick, another thru hiker that was at first a section hiker. We ended up at the Appalachian Market that seemed to be taken over with hikers. Here we saw  J^2 and met one of the biggest characters of the trail; Brother Blood. He bought a beer and I got a piece of pizza. We talked for a bit. Then all hiked to Greymoore Spiritual Center where we could camp at a baseball field. Brother Blood started a fire and we sat around eating dinner and talking. Brother blood is a former thru hiker who had written a book. He was out section hiking with his lawyer friends, Maverick and Steve. He did claim that if it rained the next day, those two would be at a bed and breakfast. Lots of entertainment! At the fire it was Kara, Me, Maverick, Brick, Steve, Tortoise, Brother Blood, and J^2.","William Brien Shelter

Heather Morris,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616680,"First big day! We pushed 14.5 miles but with walking down to the campground it was more like 16. Rough morning to waking up to pouring rain. Kind of a hard day for me! Did 4 miles by 10 and started at 8:30. Soaked through though. Lots of salamanders again. Very slippery rocks and mud. I fell. I landed quite hard on my hand and was not really happy, so in my response to that, I cried. Thank you Kara for just letting me cry! When we were pretty down spirit wise, we ran into chocoholic! What a life saver. She again cheered us up with her stories. Had lunch and caught up with her. As we were eating we met another interesting and brave person by the name of Fern. She was a thru-hiker, starting in Georgia and from New Zealand. She was pushing 27 miles every day and had great advice. She was definitely a tough person and gone 100 or so miles without a zero day. She was finally taking one on Friday as she felt she was getting tired. We pushed on and left Chocoholic for a little while as we walked through cool forest and blow downs. We finally hobbled, hunch backed, and stumbled into camp at Clarence Fahenstock hiker campground on Canopus Lake. Here was J^2 sitting by trail magic beer! James was also here ( section Hiker). We set up camp, went up the showers where I got sprayed in the face with very cold water, and kara took a shower. When we got back Chocoholic had arrived! J^2 started a fire and we were eating dinner when Sela came in. Also a thru hikre from Georgia, he had done 27 miles. Very nice, softspoken guy who has become our hero. He has carried 45 lbs on his back since Georgia since he cannot figure out how others get their weight lower. At around 8, Brother Blood stumbled inn and true to his word Maverick and Steve were in a motel. He had to order them an uber, tell them how much to tip, and then pressed on.  Brother Blood gave us our new trail names, I being Hatchet because I cut myself with an axe twice and Kara because he things a buck saw is a crosscut saw! We went to bed hearing Brother Bloods snoring and knowing that if a bear came into camp if would go for him first because he kept his food under his hammock.","Greymoore Spiritual Center

Heather Morris,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616685,"In the morning we talked to Sela and J^2 and decided to give a sign for trail magic a chance out of respect and gratitude for people like them. We walked 15 minutes to the real campground and met Eric. He was so excited. He sets up camp for a week and waits for thru hikers to make them breakfast, lunch, or dinner. He has done this for the past 10 years/ Unfortunately, the campground moved the thru-hikers to a new area and no one wanted to talk over to him. We were the first thru hikers he had seen and he was leaving the next morning. Talk about set up. he had everything thought out. He made us eggs and hot dogs, ham and cheese sandwiches, coffee, and soda. He had cups, plates, silver ware stored in tennis ball containers. Every condiment and boxes of cat food piled with snacks and foods for thru hikers. He was ex military and felt that instead of doing the trail he felt like he would make better use of his time to make food for hikers and has loved doing it! He's also a huge tennis fan! Will be keeping in contact through email! MADE IT TO 100 in our first 3 miles. Rained that night but otherwise beautiful day. More giant blow downs and huge trees to walk around. Met up with Chocoholic on trail for a bit but ended up passing. Made it to road where Eric from our hotel picked us up. The hotel was so unique and gorgeous. 6 sisters bought this hotel from the past owner and it looked like a renovated mansion. Eric brought our dirty, smelly bags up to a huge room with the most beautiful double beds, chairs, bathroom, view, and etc. They had blankets for us to spread our stuff on to spare their floor and Charlene was nice enough to touch our beyond disgusting clothes to wash them. After getting cleaned we walked down to grab an early dinner. We met a third sister who was helping out with the gardening and they let us sit outside as they were doing work. It felt like we were royalty. Between Eric giving us rides and talking to us about hiking, to  Charlene sharing her dream of eventually doing the trail and giving me a garbage bag for my new rain dress, to the waiter making us laugh and attending to our every needs, to the chef for delicious foods and amazing grilled cheese display, to the hostess who was cheerful and showed us around, to the beautiful gardens, to the wonderful and fancy continental breakfast and man who ran it, this place is beyond perfect and amazing. I recommend going if you are a thru-hiker or looking to get away. Located in Stormville, Ny it  is a perfect location to stay and hike!","Clarence Fahenstock

Heather Morris,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616688,"After getting dropped off by Eric, we had a very beautiful but not eventful hike. At Morgan Stewart shelter, we stopped for lunch and met Mountain Calf (NOBO). We met 3 other hikers, one of which made us feel uncomfortable. We encountered trail magic where a wonderful women's hiking club supplied chocolates, oranges, and a quinoa salad for us (WISH I GOT THEIR NAMES AND PICTURE). Here we saw another hiker who looked familiar but had shaved off his beard. It was PIRATE. we met him at the bear mountain bridge motel briefly for about 2 minute before heading off. We saw him again at the telephone pioneers shelter that we were hoping to stay at but it was OVERRUN with weekenders. He said he was going to camp in the park .6 miles ahead and the guy who made us uncomfortable was at that shelter, so we decided to push forward. Turns out the man did too and proceeded to say more uncomfortable things to us as they left the shelter and we passed them going down the trail. We quickly caught up with pirate and walked the VERY long 2.5 miles into town to the park. Well worth it! Pirate is our third close trail friend now and we met Scootch, who we also became good friends with. Another character! We ordered pizza to the park (buff chick). Not long after a trail nagle by the name of Tomkat with a K (or as we know him Komcat) showed up with his mom and two other hammockers. They had been drinking at the carnival in town and Komcat brought us some shaken up sodas that he admitted dropping due to being drunk. He enjoyed trying to learn our names but was too drunk to understand when to stop talking after asking a question. Him and his mom ( he is about 30ish years old) then went and relaxed on the swings and was yelling ""wee"". Pirate was cracking up and kept saying we were in the twilight zone of Pawling, NY. I do not disagree with that. The night was filled with some rain, good laughs, and loud bull frogs.","Le Chambord

Heather Morris,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616692,"Woke up at park and decided to have a late morning. We walked into town with pirate and scootch where we were easily convinced to do another 12.2 mile day. Had 5 creampuffs and a coffee at Sunflower bakery. Then got a sandwich at the famous Vinny's deli. Also we ran into none other then, J^2. Scoot took a train back to the second road we didnt get to and we got a taxi back with pirate to our spot. Here we took pictures of this 300+ year old oak that was the largest on the East Coast and known as the Dover Oak on West Dover Road of Pawling, NY. Hiked about 2 miles with Pirate through beautiful field where we talked about the haunted creepy shelter, gear advice, and favorite hostels and zero day spots. He then flew past us. We stopped at a garden center that was a huge fan of thru hikers and stamped our book. Here we ran into a section hiker by the name of Tri pad we passed going to bear mountain and who was also at Greymoore. He was still decided on NY being his most hated state to hike. He also does not hike in the rain and was eagerly awaiting his return to a manager position back home near D.C. We also met Mammoth briefly, (nobo thru hiker). As we hiked on it rained on and off but we remained mostly dry. As we stopped for lunch, we saw a scarlett tanager and we wished our dad's a Happy Fathers Day! We hiked onward to Wiley Shelter and met another section hiker Maple leaf and her dog Yankee (trail name: Marshmallow). We saw them again at Wiley shelter where we stopped for a quick break from the rain. We met Rooster here, who was a little hung over from his night in NYC with friends. Maple leaf and Yankee showed up as did Mammoth, and Tripad. I had looked at my radar though and saw we had a no rain break from 3-4 so we made our break short and continued onward over some steeper climbs into Connecticut. FIRST STATE DOWN. I'm getting my trail legs going up hill and Kara is learning how to be a steady hiker not a sprinter. The cool thing is that we hike about even on flat terrain but she is faster downhill and I am faster uphill so we keep an even pace! Eventually got to shelter in pouring rain, tent got wet but oh well, and we did our cool little cooking under a tarp trick. At the shelter was Scootch, J^2, Maple Leaf, Yankee, the three older guys, and Mammoth!","Edward B Marrow Park

Heather Morris,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616693,"2 weeks on trail. Walked along the beautiful Housatonik River and over bridges. Went to the Bulls Bridge country store with Yankee and Maple leaf for coffee and went under the famous covered bridge. We said goodbye to Scootch, J^2, and Mammoth but ran into Tripad coming out of the woods. We hiked up a very long, steep mountain overlooking the river. It was a treacherous walk down, slipping on rocks (Kara fell twice), I almost stepped on a rattlesnake, and Kara almost fell on a copper head. Luckily we made it over and put our heads down to get into Kent, Connecticut. It was a beautiful day otherwise and was very pretty with views, JUST TOUGH. Saved a lot of salamanders again. Barbie (our hostel owner) picked us up and gave us a tour. We stopped at the grocery store to pick up lunch and dinner, and a quick stop to the cafe and coffee store. She then took us back to one of the most beautiful views of mountains, fields, and cows. Chocoholic was also here and we caught up with her on her treacherous journey on those very slippery rocks (in the rain). Barbie has a very cute house and we took a walk to see 5 wild turkeys (Tyrone, Tammy, and friends). We didn't see our friends Timothy (turkey vultures that Kara had named). We enjoyed a very nice dinner, fresh corn on the cobb,  a great dessert, and tea!","Ten Mile River Shelter

Heather Morris,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619037,"Today was a long but good day! We had a beautiful morning up a mountain to cliffs and St. John’s ledges. There was some mountain laurel, sassafras, and red efts. There were crazy technical downhill “stairs” of rocks and had to slide on butt mostly. Stopped for lunch at Stewart Brook Shelter and decided to do more miles instead of stay at silver hill campsite. We came down to a flat road next to a river and luckily saw a bear! There were large boulders of quartz with reds, whites, browns, and etc. We crossed a river to meet a girl named Jukebox and a guy named Peach. Apparently Peach had heard about us (the lumberjills from Brother Blood). We ended up at the campsite with Peach and his father, Gopher. Peach quickly ran into his tent for the night after we were swarmed with mosquitos. We instead suffered and talked to gopher while eating dinner outside. We were excited to see Mayor show up and he offered us some candy!","Kent Connecticut
