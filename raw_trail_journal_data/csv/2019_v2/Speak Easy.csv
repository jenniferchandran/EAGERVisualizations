Speak Easy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606142,"I get asked why a lot. Then I get a good looking up and down and a hmm. That’s going to be incredibly hard. As if my mid life layer of spongey insulation says, not possible.  So the philosophical answer. Life is short, filled with routine, tragedy, loss, it’s messy,  and even fulfilled dreams that can disappoint, and possibly/likely regrets. As Buddha said “life is suffering”. That’s sounds dark.. When life brings you to your knees stand up and go further. Physical and mental endurance is key to life. Life also has it’s great moments and gotta grab every good or great moment or potential opportunity for great moments as you can. Like hiking the A.T. I expect it to be painful, torcher really. However it’s sometimes in these moments the most difficult that you discover things. I’ll have significant amounts of time for inner reflection. Certainly over such a journey there’s nearly countless unanticipated events to experience that one cannot fully predict. As I mentioned in about me I never require an excuse to get outside.  How about the nonphilosophical reasons. Because it’s there. This is most likely my best opportunity to do this and regardless of any concerns I will seize this opportunity. Ya never know what’s around the corner, who knows how much time I have left on this planet and in sorta decent physical condition to do it.  The memories that stand out in life are not the days filled with routine. Not the days that you choose to follow the usual path in your decisions. I would like to die with significant memories. To cliche or not to cliche, how time moves so quickly. Slow the clock by making bolder moves by creating more memories and slowing the pace of time in your mind.",,View Entry,"Dec 30, Sun",0
Speak Easy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606328,"Hiked from Cooper Gap to Gooch Gap and back yesterday with full pack. About 9 miles total. Day started off foggy with a very fine mist. Fog cleared couple hours in. Became aware almost 4 miles in that my fly was open, (went to grocery store in same condition today). This seems to happen with unusual frequency. One might be lead to believe I’m some kind of exhibitionist. A trench coat being the logical next step. However this is not the case. In fact I don’t think anyone that knows me has ever even seen me wearing shorts. Possibly early onset dementia... Any doctors in the house? Anyway took hour break to lay in hammock. Averaged only 2.5 miles an hour. Some days are slower than others.. I hike this area pretty frequently as it’s in my district. Walking district at moment as we had some strong winds and a lot of rain recently and am checking for Blowdown’s. District is from Hightower Gap to Woody Gap. Saw only one Blowdown yesterday and will clear it as soon as government reopens. There’s two creek crossings in this area including Justus creek. Which was featured on the cover of Appalachian trail guide North Carolina Georgia 2013. I’ll include picture. This section Brookshire Gap to Justus creek including tent pads I personally maintain as Overseer. Both were running higher than average but not nearly as high as I’ve seen it. This is the best time of year to hike this section as with leaves off trees get beautiful Mountain views. Nothing too exciting but still a great day in the woods.
 So for a full pack, (really over full) I’m carrying 2 liters of water all base supplies and food for 7 days. Pack weight 30lbs, base weight is about half that. Hopefully if hike with pack loaded down will feel light with normal supplies.  Or maybe I’ll carry this minus a liter so can resupply less often.. 
 Tomorrow will hike from Woody Gap to Gooch Gap or Gooch to Preacher and back for a mileage total of either just 7 or 9.8.

This day I had started at woody Gap and hiked to Gooch Gap and back. With the leaves off the trees had a great Mountain View for most of the hike. There’s also a couple great look outs. The more we’ll known being Ramrock. I ran into a friend from the Gatc on my way out and hiked the rest of the way back to the parking lot with him. Bruce is always great to talk to. He’s one of the trail hero’s. He has been maintainer of the year 2 years in a row! Ran into a very nice young lady whom had thru hiked last year. Was great talking to her.

So within the calendar year that can count towards thru hike mileage I’ve done 12 miles so far. Of course backtracked all those miles and have actually done a total of 24.  Day started off very cold with a brisk wind and remained cold. I had some pictures but apparently all of them are too large to add. Just a bit over a mile in on south side of Sassafras Mountain I stepped on a nothing little twig fully expecting it to just crunch under my foot. The twig had other vengeful plans. With lightning like reflexes it whipped me square on the wiener. Not just a tickle, I mean full on smack down. Some guys may be into this 50 shades stuff, but I’d prefer to pass. Anyway next time may consider wearing a cup. Remainder of the day was happily uneventful. The trail on this section is a constant up or down with 4 gaps in 3.5 miles.

Yesterday hiked from Hightower Gap to Three Forks and back for a total of 8.6 miles with a minuscule 4.3 official miles. Yesterday was blistering cold started off my hike with 25 degrees temperature and finished day with temperature at a balmy 29 degrees. I actually much prefer the cold. I may actually die of heatstroke this summer. The frost on the trees turned an ordinary section of forest into enchanted. Three forks is always beautiful, however made even more so today by higher water. Peaceful and quiet day.

Speak Easy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606757,"Wasn’t sure about hiking today as weather forecasters were calling for the snowpocalypse. Was a bit nervous as I was driving up to three forks whether I would be able to get back out. Had full pack with me so even if that were the case could’ve stayed out overnight. Temperature on the trail this morning was around 30. There was a brisk breeze most of the day. Couldn’t say what the temperature was with the wind chill.  Definitely snowed on the mountain and had between a dusting and up to 1 1/2 of snow. On the south side of the mountain as I was heading out there was no snow, Dahlonega no snow and dry. The big scary winter vortex that was supposed to dump a bunch of snow on us and which just the threat caused all the schools to close in anticipation was a giant nothing burger! Anyway I always enjoy hiking this section. Starting with the beautiful creek at three forks, through rhododendron tunnel, then through beautiful hemlock forest, and through dense woods. Kept a good pace all day and was averaging close to three miles an hour. What should have been just 6.6 miles round trip today ended up being more like 7.6. I somehow got off trail, probably old A.T., did a big loop and ended up heading in wrong direction. Now I’ve hiked this section many times, I blame the beautiful mask of snow... No doubt won’t be the last time I get off track. Unfortunately to make things worse while I was unaware yet that I had looped around and was heading north instead of south I pointed another fellow hiker in the wrong direction. Sorry!!! He must’ve figured it out though as once I got myself turned back around I never ran into him again. I didn’t get any miles in last week as I was a bit under the weather. Officially got 3.3 trail miles in today and did total of somewhere in the range of 7.6. 
 I plan to hike from woody Gap to Jarrard  Gap next. Had hiked woody to a bit past Henry Gap and back on 12/24 however will rehike it so it’s within 2019 and can count miles for thru hike. That’ll be a challenging 11.8 mile round trip hike. Of course as I get my hiker legs under me that’ll seem like nothing later.

Was way to warm for this time of year! Temperature was in the high 60’s. Got pretty sweaty and was a good day to test some anti chaff underwear. They failed. Luckily have some Gold bond and generously powdered up after. If anyone out there has this same issue and has found something that really works please let me know! Other than that bit of excitement which I’m sure you all wanted to know about, it was an uneventful day. I only averaged 2 miles an hour. This section includes the fabulously rumpled blanket mountain view of preacher rock. Nearly the entire route offers views through the trees this time of year. 
 Also I want to thank those of you whom have sent me messages! I’d love to reply, however there doesn’t seem to be an option to do so.

Started at Jarrard Gap at lake Winfield Scott Recreation Area.  Didn’t see many people till I made it to top of Blood Mountain. From there to Neel Gap was a super crowd of people taking advantage of the warm sunny day. By the time I was getting close to end of the day near Jarrard Gap I was really dragging. Will still be some time before I get some sturdier trail legs under me. The views were fantastic today with soft puffy clouds over distant mountains. Pictures of course never do long range views justice. I will add some of yesterday’s to photos. Was a 10.5 mile day total with just 5 of that being actual official miles.
 Next stop I hope to take on springer parking lot to visitors center.
  I worked as a Trail Ambassador on this hike. I won’t say too much on this. I will say though that it’s important to be conscientious of the rules in the National Forest. These rules are in place for good reason. In addition to those rules the importance of leave no trace principles.

Speak Easy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607394,"Over the last couple days hiked from Unicoi Gap to Low Gap shelter then to Neels Gap. For a total of 21.2 miles. 
 Started from Unicoi Gap hiking south. Started off a bit chilly however with a good clump out of Unicoi warmed up very quickly. I was hiking today with a friend from the Georgia Appalachian Trail Club and fellow Trail Ambassador. She was wearing the brightest possible yellow shirt. We made slow miles Sunday but enjoyed the great broken views through the trees, joking around, and talking to fellow hikers. We ran into several other club members as well on Sunday. One whom is currently thru hiking. Possibly I’ll see him up the trail again, his trail name is Bear Bag. He’s an Overseer of section 4.1 in my district. An Overseer is a trail maintainer whom maintains a section of trail, usually about a mile to a mile and a half. He came to me already an experienced maintainer and he’s an outstanding Overseer. I offered a couple possible trail name to my hiking partner. Sunshine for her sunny disposition and impossibly yellow uniform shirt. However every year there’s numerous Sunshine’s. So later offered Wind chime as a trail name for the noise that her gear made when a gust of wind would hit us. Wind Chime must’ve had at least 20 pieces of gear flapping around that was attached to her pack. Possibly she was attempting camouflage her silhouette like a special forces ghillie suit. I’ll include a picture or 2 though not all of it shows up in the pictures. She hasn’t been able recently to do much hiking as she’s been busy with work and school. Has a slower pace than I do but has impressive determination. Never a complaint about the difficulty of the terrain, which was very challenging and more so in a southern direction through this section. 
 We stayed at Low Gap shelter for the night with half a dozen other hikers and a Ridge Runner. A Ridge Runner is similar to a Trail Ambassador but often with more experience. They are paid employees of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. Most if not all have attempted a thru hike or have completed one. Captain Planet had completed a thru hike herself. She has the perfect disposition to be a Ridge Runner. She’s experienced, knowledgeable, passionate, and has a super outgoing friendly personality. 
 The night was in the 20’s and the wind was ferocious. I stayed reasonably warm but had some cold spots that kept me awake. My bag, a magma is actually rated at 16 degrees. But where the down gets crushed down doesn’t do any good. I was sleeping in a hammock. I did have a winter under quilt of sorts but think I’ll switch to my tent till spring. The wind was so ludicrously loud all night that a Bear could’ve made a midnight snack out of my tented neighbor Wind Chime I wouldn’t have hear a thing. 
 Without a good nights sleep for either of us we had an even bigger day ahead of us. I was dragging a bit myself and would say the hiking pace between us wasn’t that significant Sunday. The terrain was mostly steep climbs with some spectacular clear views. We saw another GATC member who is also attempting a thru hike this year. We did however eventually arrived at Neels Gap and had an additional half mile to the above mileage to road walk to her car in the Byron Reece parking area. 
Was an excellent couple days hiking . Wind Chime, thank you for joining me! I most certainly enjoyed hiking with you! She plans to thru hike in the next year or 2 herself. I have no doubt she’ll make it all the way!

Speak Easy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607578,"Started day off at Dicks Creek Gap Saturday and hiked south as a Trail Ambassador and thru hiker of course. I like to hike south when on trail as a trail ambassador to catch all the other thru hikers through whatever section I’m on. Plan this past weekend was to get to Unicoi Gap Sunday.
 Started off with a seemingly endless climb south out of Dicks Creek Gap. Weather was ideal, cool and sunny. As usual for this time of year expansive views through the trees most of the day. I had no plan as to where I would stop for the night when I started out. Thought maybe Deep Gap or Sassafras Gap. Then after passing both thought maybe Steele trap Gap. After arriving there at 3 o’clock thought still felt strong and should head to Tray mountain. When I arrived at the shelter thought I’d see if I could find a stealth spot to camp instead. Stealth camping is setting up camp for the night beyond a shelter or officially designated tent pads. There is a tent area past the shelter. I thought surely there’s something better and hiked on. That turned out to be an excellent decision, how marvelous when things work out so perfectly. Came to the craggy layered rocky overlook and took a seat to take in the what has to be a very decent portion of the state of Georgia. I noticed a small clearing below and found there the perfect stealth spot just large enough for my tent. Now I wouldn’t have stayed there if was a pristine area. We should all stay on durable surfaces that are already significantly impacted and well established so as to protect the remaining unimpacted forest. See pictures. After setting up my tent I sat on the overlook taking in this magnificent view from both sides of the mountain while enjoying dinner and the setting sun. I retired to my tent after dark as it’s hiker midnight as we say. Thru hikers respect this hiker midnight as bedtime or quite time as soon as it turns dark. 
 I had slept moderately well and woke to a perfect morning. Cool damp foggy air. By the time I’d packed up and sat again on the rocky overlook, the fog cleared for my breakfast. I only had about 5 miles left to reach Unicoi Gap. I had told my wife to pick me up at 10:30. Even with another epic climb and talking with a number of thru hikers I finished at 10:35. The day was warm with lush tunnels of mountain laurels and rhododendrons. 
 I’m off trail for few days before trail becomes my home for next number of months. Thursday I’ll be dropped off at Dicks creek gap and head north towards Mt Katahdin Maine. My next resupply stop will be in Franklin North Carolina. I will also try to break down by day after today rather than by trip.

The A.T. takes an average of 15 days longer than the pct which is about 400 miles longer, and 15 days longer than doing the cdt which is about 800 miles longer. The elevation gained on a thru hike of the A.T. is 515,000 feet. I thought I had a good grasp of what roughly a couple hundred feet or a 1,000 feet in elevation gain is.

So had some steep climbs today, very steep. However was a significantly easier day than yesterday’s crazy climb. Not many views today. I did find an excellent camp site. The shelters can fill up they don’t make for peaceful nights. My camp site tonight is surrounded by like 4 different babbling springs. Can’t really capture in photo. I have a very concerning scarce amount of toilet paper left for the morning. Hiking all day everyday makes you very regular. I hear from past thru hikers they were going several times a day.

Lush with moss covering everything from large granite boulders to dead trees, and dirt. Strange when you’re seemingly deep in the mountains and you come out to a road. I hit the 200 mile mark just before the look out. The look out on Clingmans Dome is a strange sight, nothing around it but trees, mountains, and a single lane paved road. It’s a hulking concrete spiral ramp that lead up to a circular overlook. Luckily was mostly clear and the view is certainly worth the climb.

 Tom and Yiqing were kind enough to drop me back off at Davenport Gap around 12:30 today and hike the first half mile/mile with me. It was hard saying goodbye to everyone today, most especially Alena of course but have to make some miles. 
 It’s always a very big climb out of the gaps. Some hikers have developed an aversion to anything with gap in the name. The day started with a nice little creek and falls before passing under I-40 and up the mountain the trail went. Mostly unremarkable though. By nightfall was climbing steps up to Max Patch. By the time I reached the top minutes later I couldn’t see where I was going without headlamp. Came to a flat spot soon after and decided that would be it for the day. Did 16 miles today.

Finally it came around 2 o’clock and gave everything a thorough soaking.

I was definitely in need of electrolytes. When I reached the gap I was met by Trail Angels Pete Horeyseck, Denny Boyce, Larry Wobker, and Eric Sowder.
