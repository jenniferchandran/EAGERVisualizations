Bob Rogers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615522,"Welcome to my first ever backpacking event ever! I know the drop out rate is very high and I just plan to hike my own hike. Even the worst day of hiking is better than any day at work. My expectations are to lose weight, grapple with some inner self growth, increase my stamina (although I work at least one 20 + hour day per month), and fulfill a life long fantasy of walking in nature for days upon end!
Items not shown in gear selection layout are my CPAP and battery. Initially had pack at 20lbs. Now at 31lbs after much thought and the addition of CPAP.

Bob Rogers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615523,"Having camped since 2000 beginning with my girls troop in scouting, we have tent camped every other year more or less by primitive, KOA, and semi-primitive camping (meaning hot showers-no electricity). I will admit to two years in a row to renting one travel trailer and one RV. Hiking though never. So I started with several library books on hiking. Ordered from Amazon, Appalachian Trail (AT) Data Book 2019,The At Guide north bound, then realized there was a south bound version. So ordered the PDF of it. Through Hiker Companion Guide 2019, How to hike the AT by Chris Cage, and AWOL by David Miller.Web sites like the AT Conservancy, REI, Mountain crossing, Backpacker, Back packing light, AThiker.org, lots of youtube (with great appreciation for the effort of the individual posters), well as this site.

Bob Rogers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615528,"I departed/resigned work April 24th 2019, with the intention to per sure other activities. not exactly knowing the exact activity I began 4/25 with the gym. At first one hour then quickly worked up to two or more hours in the next week. Spent all day Saturday the 27th on the jet ski with a new friend and stupidly did not apply sunscreen. Lessen learned.May 6th was the day I decided to hike the AT and began preparation in earnest. So basically speaking I have spent one month and three days doing activities to begin this adventure on Sunday June 9th. Living on the treasure coast of Florida, this time of year is still semi-mild in temp est. 74/84, but still huge in humidity. Having spent the prior week and 1/2 doing sprinkler maintenance, pruning of overgrown oak trees, and palm trees, I have at least semi-accumulated myself to the the heat and high physical demands manual labor without any negative effects on my body. Still I believe having learned form others that nothing can compare to the physical demand and overall conditioning the several weeks on the AT will bring.

Bob Rogers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615530,"Thursday April 6th will be only the second day of wearing the backpack at base weight for a few hours doing house cleaning. The first being several weeks ago on the treadmill. Attempted to set up tent a couple times w/o fully completing the task, so that will be done prior to the 9th. I have spent more time with my best friend, dog Bella, in the last several weeks and given her mush attention. I will miss her so much I get emotional just thinking about it. My oldest daughter has let me occupy her large dinning room table with 7 supply boxes full of food and other necessities I think I will need. The remainder of the table is laid out with extra food, clothing, ect. She has already shipped my four day supply of food to the Teahorse hostile in Harpers Ferry ( Really hope my spork is in the bag since I cant find it today). My first ever hostile. My sister will take Bella in what will be no less than a five star accommodation in my absence. Bella may not even want to return to my house! Being human I can go to dark places in my mind. How ever briefly those thoughts they do help you realize how great life is and how much it I cherish the gifts I have. One of those dark thoughts relates to Bella. She is 14 y/o and showing a steady, however slowly decline in overall health. I have s/w my sister on any final arrangements that my be needed. I would be hard pressed not to leave the trail at once if the worst were to happen.

Bob Rogers,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616407,Wednesday June 12 felt very ill and thought best to get off trail. A trail angel gave me a lift to Washington Dulles int airport hertz rental car. Now it’s Saturday June 15 and I’m waiting on my cars new water pump to be installed. As I was feeling better and heading to springer mountain the water pump decided to fail after 20 years. Lol. Not sure what will happen in the future with section hiking for me. I guess the motivation to hike a trail I certainly was not ready for has given me time to pause. I learned a lot on this 12 mile shake down and will put it to good use in the future trails I do overnight.,"David lesser memorial shelter
