Feel good about the training in the heat of GTMO in the hope that it gets me somewhat acclimated to the 80+ degree heat I'll hit along the AT in GA/NC/TN in June.  Training without shade in GTMO is also an added psychological and physical edge over the anticipated tree canopy of the AT.",,Golf Ball Hill R/T,"Apr 29, Sun",7

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591837,"I've been spending the past ten days catching up on all my ""to do"" things so that I could hopefully get them all done and not have things hanging over my head while on the trail.  I actually got all the important things done.  I haven't done any specific hiking but have used the time to allow my body to rest up and heal from minor aches/pains.  At this point, I feel great and am ready to go! I'll catch up this journal as I can along the trail. My first itinerary:Sunday, May 270700-0848 - Catch flight from Norfolk to Atlanta0848-1015 - limo service from Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson airport to Amicalola Falls in Dawsonville, GA, the start of the 8.8 mile pre-trail leading to the Appalachian Trail southern terminus at Springer Mountain.1015-1130 - pick up lighter and stove fuel since I couldn't ship in advance or bring either on the plane.  have lunch and then pick up my box of supplies I sent via UPS several days ago.  Repack pack, fill water bottles, call Susan. 1130 - start the 8.8 mile pre-trail with the 600 + stairs leading up to Amicalola Falls and onward north.  I hope to get to Springer Mountain by 4:00.  Once at Springer, I'll call Susan again, top off my water, register and hit the trail.  My intent is to make it to Hawk Mountain Campsite 7.4 miles away from Springer and set up camp on the first day there.I realize I may have to shorten or modify the distance, particularly since there is a tropical storm coming north from the Gulf of Mexico that could dump a lot of rain.  Despite Alberto, the weather was already forecast for occasional thunderstorms.  The good news is the temps are predicted to be in the mid-70's and all my gear is protected in individual dry sacks and I've got my pack cover and poncho.  I don't care if I get wet.  I care if my stuff gets wet.If all goes well on day one, day two, Monday, I'll hike 12.9 miles to Woody Gap and then either hitchhike and/or walk two miles along GA-60 into Suches, GA.  I've already got a cabin reserved for Monday night at Two Wheels in Suches.  I hope to get there around 3:00pm.Tuesday my intent is to hike or get a ride over the two miles of GA-60 back to the AT from Suches and then hike the 10.6 miles into Neel Gap which will take me up and over Blood Mountain, the highest point along the AT in Georgia at 4500 feet.  So if all goes well, I'll be roughly 40 miles along at the end of day three.I'll try to forecast my itinerary out three days as I update my journal.",,View Entry,"May 25, Fri",0
TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591948,"Well, had a great lead-in to the extended Memorial Day weekend.  Susan and I attended Friday night's meet & greet at the Marriott downtown Norfolk commemorating the 50th anniversary of the final patrol of the USS Scorpion (SSN-589).  Scorpion was declared lost in May 0f 1968 with the loss of all 99 crewmembers aboard.  My connection to the survivors association is as a member of the US Submarine Veterans, Inc. (USSVI) and becoming aware of the reunion.  Through my company, Fermion Government Services, LLC I became a major donor for the event and also as President of the USS Lapon Association, also a donor.  Lapon was a Squadron Six shipmate of the Scorpion's in the 1960's.  But, another important link between my family and the USS Scorpion is that my dad, James E. Richard, was Repair Officer on the USS Orion (AS-18), the submarine tender for Squadron Six at the time Scorpion was lost.  In my dad's papers, I found a letter from the Board of Inquiry notifying him and a dozen or so other Naval officers that they may be called to testify during the board's investigation.  That would only make sense since dad was the repair officer on the tender and would be in possession of the repair records of the Scorpion.  Another connection he had was that he was one of the officers chosen to go around town and notify family members that their loved ones were not coming home.  Friday night, an older couple asked if they could sit with us and as we began talking I learned that this gentleman, Bill Richardson, had been an officer on Scorpion but gotten off a couple years prior to her last deployment.  He related that he was stationed in Naples, Italy, the last port-of-call for Scorpion on that fateful patrol.  A couple of ladies later joined us and it turned out that the elder of the two was a sister of a crewmember who was lost and the younger lady was his daughter.  The last letter he received from his wife informed him that she was pregnant and the daughter before us Friday night was she, born in October of 1968, so several months after Scorpion went down, so she never knew her father.  Saturday we rode with 8 buses of family members and friends to the Scorpion memorial at pier 22 at Norfolk Naval Base for the ceremony.  I knew that Admiral John Richardson, the Chief of Naval Operations, was the main speaker and I'd known John for about 10 years or so going back to when he was SubLant in Norfolk.  Anyhow, it turns out that the gentleman that introduced Admiral Richardson was none other than the Bill Richardson (Captain, retired) I had spoken at length to the night before, Admiral Richardson's father!  I quickly reran my conversations with him from the night before and thankfully I couldn't recall anything stupid I'd said, thank God!  Anyhow, I got a chance to say hi to the Admiral again and relate the previous night's meeting with his father and mother.  I also ran into, actually was seated two down from, my 2nd Commanding Officer, Captain Pete Flannery.  Saturday night's banquet was equally worthwhile and continued to put into perspective what Memorial Day is all about.  I was a little surprised when I got recognized and called up to speak.  I kept it short though and related what I said in the first paragraph above.  Anyhow, now it's late as I type this and make my final preparations to depart tomorrow for the AT, but it was all well worth it and I wouldn't change a thing.  I gave up a beautiful Saturday and some sleep to honor 99 submariners who gave up their lives and to spend two days thoroughly enjoying conversations and fellowship with their families.  This is the best Memorial Day weekend I've ever had.",,View Entry,"May 26, Sat",0
TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592281,"Susan & I woke up at 4:30am and by 5:00 we were on our way to the Norfolk airport.  
The airport I was a little concerned about because of my oversized backpack carry-on.  Things went well though without a hitch and I cruised through TSA no problem. I had previously boxed up and sent UPS the things I needed that I thought may be a TSA or airline problem, things like my Leatherman, stove, trekking poles, tent stakes and food.  In all, 20 lbs of stuff, so my pack was relatively light at 20 lbs.  
Since I was going to be roughing it for 40 days, I had allowed myself the luxury of first class on the Delta direct flight, so I was in seat 1A, excellent for a quick exit.  I didn’t partake of the free drink offers, I felt with a 16+ mile hike still to go that day I needed to be all business from that point on.  The flight was uneventful other than talking to the guy next to me who was on a 40-day trek himself.  Turns out he works for Military Sealift Command and he was visiting several ports on business. Anyhow, as I deplaned several people wished me luck, I guess overhearing my conversation with the MSC guy, and I was out of there on on to meet my driver at the private limo area by baggage claim.  In all the flight was from 7:00-8:35 and I was right on schedule to meet the driver at 8:48. At first I couldn’t find him and I got a little concerned but as I was calling their office, and got voicemail which got me more concerned, he saw me and we spoke and all that stress now went away. I can’t recall his name but he was a very nice young guy, early thirties, and we spoke the whole 70-mile ride to Amicalola Falls Visitor Center.  He told me about his brother Sam who had dropped out of college and got wrapped up with some get rich quick scheme claiming to have a formula to beat baccarat.  He told me Sam and a friend would drive limos for several months then take the money they made and go to Vegas to break the baccarat bank.  Well, long story short is Sam’s done that chauffeuring to gambling cycle about 5 times and still not gotten rich.  Poor guy.  Anyhow, the driver when he dropped me off told me I’d gotten him all fired up about the AT and maybe he’d coax Sam out of Vegas and into the woods.",,Amicalola Falls Visitor Center,"May 27, Sun",0
TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592288,"So in the visitor’s center I told them what I was planning and that I needed to pick up my box.  They had me register for the trail and got me my box of stuff.  I asked about outlier thru-hikers and they said that yes, some are trickling through and that two had started the day before.  So, I may cross paths with some along the way or hopefully catch some.   
So I then found a picnic table outside and emptied my pack and my box and repacked the pack.  I weighed my loaded pack, 41lbs, a little heavier than I wanted but it had 10 days of food in it.  I then topped off my two 1/2 liter water bottles, put some electrolyte tablets in and went to the arch entry to wait for someone to come along and take my picture.  They did and I took off down the trail at about noon on Sunday.  I’ll save posting that photo until I get a similar one  in Damascus and post them together.
After only a couple hundred yards comes the stairs leading up the Falls.  All 606 of them.  That was an ordeal but I stopped at landings when I needed and for photos, those I am including, and then 1/10 mile adjacent to the top is an inn that has a restaurant so I stopped in there for their brunch.  When I was heading in two hikers, a young guy and girl, were coming out with backpacks and I ended up seeing them later.  
Crap, I wrote this once and had to log back in and it deleted it all so here Ingo again.  Probably gotta stop typing and save peridlodically.
Anyhow, I headed on up the trail towards Hawk Mountain Campground about 16 miles away where I intended to stay that night.  My stopping off point would be Springer Mountain, the actual start to the AT 8.8 miles away.  Most of the hike there was uneventful ups and downs, it was humid and overcast and visibility wasn’t very good so not a lot to see.  I did take two pictures of millipedes, one about 6” long and 1/2” wide, and a tree branch shaped like the letter ""n"".  I know, not too exciting. No bears, boars or other wild animals.  Things were progressing smoothly and then I hit the base of Springer Mountain.  I was already tired and short on water then Springer took it all out of me.  It was basically 1.5 miles up 600 feet of elevation on large rocks, rock slabs, tree roots and wet clay.  I only fell once though and it was controlled.  I slipped a bunch though.  Trekking poles are definitely good. I had to stop every 25/50 yards to catch my breath and I could hear my heart pounding.  After a few seconds I could move on though.  Finally I made the top of Springer and there was the couple from outside the buffet inn.  So I talked to them a while, they were from Titusville, Florida, and up there weekend hiking. I told them what I was doing and the three of us set off down the trail 1/4 mile to the shelter.  I needed water and my phone had died and I was using my Runkeeper app because it gives you mileage and pace based on GPS.  I was feeling pretty tired so once we got to the shelter I took my pack off, set up my phone to charge (I carry a solar charger, not that it did any good that day recharging but it had a full charge on it), ate a Pro Bar and went to the stream for water.  On my way back it downpoured and once at the shelter, we were each discussing our plans.  The couple decided to stay but I needed to press on.  I had reservations for a cabin the next day at Two Wheels in Suches, Ga and I didn’t want to add on to what was already a planned 13 mile day.  Several other camper/hikers came over to the shelter to talk, there were probably twenty or so camped out, and one girl was going almost as far as me to Carolina near the Virginia border.  I was feeling pretty good after resting 40 minutes.  It was still raining but that felt better than the heat and humidity of the day so far and besides, I thought the rain would rinse all the sweat out of my clothes.  So I decided to try to get to Stover Creek Shelter 2.6 miles away.  First I had to backtrack to the top of Springer Mountain again because I hadn’t signed the log book yet, so that was a 1/4 mile backtrack. Once there I called Susan for the first time. At 7:30pm I was off again.
I was feeling great after the rest, water and eating.  Springer to Stover is downhill coming off the mountain on the other side so that 2+ miles felt fine so much so that when I got there I figured I’d go on to the original destination, Hawk Mountain.  It was dark by now but I figured I had as long as it took.  It was another 4.7 miles away.  I had a headlamp but when I turned it on the lumens weren’t enough and it was like having no headlamp at all.  Being the prepared submariner I am, I had not one but two back-ups, two handheld mini lights.  I only needed the one and it cast a bright wide beam onto the trail.  From Stover the next waypoint was Three Forks about 1/2 mile away and that was the low point in the gap between mountains.  From there it was a gradual climb up Hawk but not really bad, about 800 feet over 4.2 miles.  
Now that the sun was down things had cooled off and it was quiet, except for some wildlife, and peaceful.  I heard an owl. I couldn’t find it with my light though.  I went through a rhododendron tunnel and in one area could smell the Jasmine, it was pretty cool traipsing along the AT.  
At Long Creek Falls I stopped to rest a bit and walked into a camp.  It was a family of four and I think I scared them at first, it being 10 at night and me looking bedraggled.  They were up and it was lit so it wasn’t like I was a bear waking them from a dead sleep.  Anyhow, I talked to the dad for about 10 minutes and then took off up the trail.  I’d noticed that the moon was out and off to my right and that’ll come into play in the next paragraph.
I only had about two miles to go but I got lost twice in those two miles.  My first time was where the trail hit a T-intersection and I didn’t see any white blazes on the trees in either direction.  White blazes are rectangles about the size of a chalkboard eraser the AT maintainers paint on trees about every 100 yards or so so you can stay on the trail.  Well, I picked a direction, left, and walked down the trail looking for a white blaze.  I quickly realized this wasn’t the right trail because it turned grassy instead of the often tread on main trail of dirt/roots/rocks.  So I went the other way and after about 100 yards I saw a white blaze tree and knew I was going the right way so that mistake only cost me about 300 yards out of my way.
The second time was a little more difficult.  I came upon a five way intersection. I just paused for a moment and took it all in.  Then I went about 10 yards down each of the other trails to see if I could see a white blaze but I could not.  I noted that the trail I was on had a white blaze tree near the junction that I could see from the intersection.  So, I went down one of the trails across from me but quickly eliminated both it and the one next to it because they both narrowed and became grassy.  So, I went back to the intersection and went down the trail that had been off to my right since it was the broadest of the remaining two.  I went about 1/4 mile looking for a white blaze and never saw one.  So, I turned around and headed back to the junction looking for the white blaze on the tree to my left.  I never saw it and the trail ended.  That seems weird but I was tired.  I didn’t panic or anything but I walked back and forth looking for my original trail.  Anyhow, all I kept thinking at 11:00 at night was here I am in the middle of the woods and I can’t be lost.  Misplaced, yes.  I was a submarine electronics technician with a specialty in NAVIGATION.  I can’t get lost!  I’ll never hear the end of it!  Anyhow, I found another junction somehow with two choices so I went right and within a few yards I see a white blaze so now at least I know I’m on the AT, but, which way am I headed?  North as intended or backtracking south?  I had my I-phone. I forgot it has a compass at the time though.   I wouldn’t have relied on it anyhow because the AT generally goes north/south but does change direction sometimes going east, west, north or south.  Then I remembered the moon but I couldn’t see it.  I wasn’t going to trust it anyhow for the same reason but it would have given me some sense I was going in the right direction.  I tried to recall landmarks from 1/2 hour ago as I went and nothing looked familiar but I was going the opposite direction if I was backtracking so I kept having to turn around and see if that perspective looked familiar, in the dark.  Then I came upon a Florida Gators ballcap hanging on a low branch on the side of the trail and I felt pretty sure I was going the right way because I hadn’t passed that before and I doubt anyone else was up at 11:00 at night hanging hats on the trail.  So I confidently went on and 20 minutes later came to a wooden marker and was praying it would say Hawk Mountain Campground and not Long Creek Falls Campground but it was Hawk and I was relieved.  More so at my excellent navigational skills still being intact.  I studied the Campground map for a bit and settled on a hammock site near the spring at the end, 1/2 mile down the side trail so off I went past sleeping hikers and campers.  I went straight to the spring and filled both my dirty and clean 64 oz bottles then set up camp.  I took a bandana bath and changed into clean dry clothes and then as an afterthought I threw my pack and trail shoes into the hammock with me in the event it rained during the night.  So at 1:00am after 11-1/2 hours of hiking  18+ miles I climbed in the hammock to sleep.  10 minutes later it started raining and it rained off and on all night so having my pack and shoes in the hammock was the right call, even if it was like sleeping with a 40 pound dead weight that kept tumbling into me all night.","Amicalola Falls Visitor Center

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592302,"so after a restless night I woke up at 7:30 and commenced to breaking down my camp, in the on again off again rain.  By 8:50 I was packed and off the side Campground trail and back on the main AT heading north to my next destination of Woody Gap and then a short two-mile walk on GA-60 into Suches, Georgia and the Two Wheels restaurant and cabins.  
The first thee miles felt great mainly because they were gently rolling hills.  It was still raining off/on but I had my pack cover on and my poncho and the rain sure beat Sunday’s humidity.  
I passed one group of guys taking a break atop a hill just past Hightower Gap.  I stopped and talked to them for a bit, about seven in all, 5 guys in their early twenties or late teens and two older guys about 45-50. They were heading to Gooch Gap which is 3.5 miles before before Woody Gap. Anyhow, after about 5 minutes I pressed on.  It was rolling hills again for about 1-1/2 miles then I came to Horse Gap and the base of Sassafras Mountain. 
What a pain!!  It’s about a 600 foot climb over a mile to the top starting from Horse Gap.  I had to stop a lot to catch my breath again.  I slipped some but only fell once, again a slow controlled fall onto my pack.  It’s harder getting up than it is falling down!
That reminds me,I quit the whole AT thing during my first major mountain yesterday and decided to walk home.  Via Damascus, Virginia!  I keep telling myself that after these arduous climbs.
Sassafras was bad because it’s rock slabs, big tree roots, slippery clay and due to the rain, running water, all up hill.  You’d look ahead and just see another climb for 10-20-30 yards and that’s all you could see.  While climbing I’d think I hope it flattens outor goes down some but no, up and up it went, switchbacking to the top.  About 1/2 mile from the top two of the younger guys from the previous group of seven I mentioned caught up to me while I was taking about 3 minutes.  They said this mountain was taking it to them as well so that made me feel better.  They were going to hang out and wait for the rest of their guys so I told them I’d yell from the top of the mountain to let them know how far it was.  So I trekked on and a little while later it leveled off and I could see for about 100 yards and it was level.  So I gave out a big yell, as big as I could being beat, and went on thinking it’s downhill from here.  Nope, a little while later more climbs, about a 1/4 mile of them, then down into Cooper Gap.  
Cooper Gap sits at a crossroads of USFS 42/69.  When I came off the mountain and into the gap, I saw three guys maybe in their late twenties/early thirties under a tarp and what looked like a fuel trailer nearby.  So I said hi and asked about the nearest spring because I was out of water again.  One of them pointed to the trailer and said it’s easier than that.  The trailer was marked “potable water”.  I filled up both my 16s and my clean 64, dropped in some electrolyte tabs and drank away. The potable water trailer belongs to the army out of nearby Camp Frank D Merrill and the army used the area for Army ranger training.  In fact, the AT guides warn you that if you see army guys hiding in the woods, leave them alone, don’t even talk to them and they aren’t supposed to acknowledge you either.  I did hear gunfire and helicopters while going over Sassafras but I knew about the ranger training so didn’t pay it much mind.  Several times when I was standing talking the three guys there army vehicles rolled up and filled up cans of water.  
But getting back to these theee guys.  They were heading to the same place I was, Two Wheels in Suches.  They were only out for the weekend.  They had had it though and couldn’t go on but they had talked to a local guy who said he’d come back with his truck and give them a ride into town.  Otherwise, they’d have to walk the 8+ miles remaining and hey were only averaging about a mile an hour and it was already nearing 1:00pm.  One of the guys had cel coverage and called Two Wheels to tell them that they, and I, would be arriving sometime that night and not to give the cabins away.  Two Wheels said we had all night and that the keys to each of our cabins would be on the porch by the door, so that was cool they did that and that the other hikers did that for me.  So, after eating a Pro Bar and a bag of tuna, I lightened my load by another pound or so and left some “trail magic” , as it’s called of food beside the trail at Cooper Gap and headed onward around 1:10pm.  
Out of the Gap ( you quickly catch on that while a gap is good coming off the mountain, it’s called a gap because you have to them go up another one) I saw a sign saying 3.5 miles to Gooch Gap so off I went up Justus Mountain but I was fresh and the climb was a lot easier than Sassafras and was only about 400 feet over 3/4 mile.  So I made it straight through to Gooch Gap non-stop and felt pretty good.  I rested for about ten minutes there and ate a little, drank a little.  No one was around.  I thought I only had 1-1/2 miles to Woody Gap and I’d lost that rain soaked page I’d torn from my guide (and my back-up guide) so I wasn’t really sure.  So, after my break I went on down the trail.  Well, it turned out to be 3.5 miles and although it was rolling hills and not too bad, 1-1/2 miles prior to Woody Gap was Ramrock Mountain and that hammered me.  It was only about a 275 foot climb in elevation but over about 200 yards so it sucked!!!
I ran into a couple from Waynesboro, VA hiking the other way and they told me that park rangers were suggesting that hikers stay off the trail on Tuesday because Tropical Storm Alberto was dumping a lot of rain in the area and heavy winds were expected as well as tornado warnings.  Well, I was pretty beat anyhow so I figured once I got into Suches I’d see about extending and taking a “zero” day or rest day. 
So I finally got to GA-60 around 5:15 sore as can be, mainly my feet and severe rash from hiking in wet shorts all day.  That’s a pleasant thought, but true.  I thought some baby powder and a diaper would feel great right now along with a tall draft beer. 
So I immediately started thumbing into Suches, two miles away.  After a mile, only four cars came by and none of them picked me up despite my best efforts to look forelorn and with my USS Lapon ballcap on!  Unpatriotic, if you ask me, and on Memorial Day!
I was walking around a bend in the road and an SUV went by and I saw brake lights thinking they’d turn around and come get me, but no, the SUV pulled in a driveway and stopped and the lady got out to check her mailbox before driving on up the drive.  I kinda picked up my pace and she saw me and said hi so I said hi back and tried to look (I didn’t have to try hard) beat to death.  She asked if I needed a ride and of course I said yes.  So I put my pack in the back and got in and there was one little 5 year old girl in the back and another infant girl in a car seat.  So, she asked me where I was going and I told her Two Wheels a mile up.  She knew it well of course and drove me there.  We talked the usual expected chatter, where you from?  Where you going? Etc.  when she pulled up to Two Wheels, it was closed.  Well this lady gets all concerned about my well being and I assured her it was OK, my key is at the  cabin, but I was bummed out ‘cause no tall draft beer.  Anyhow, I showed her my reservation on my phone so all was good.  She introduced herself as Sarah and then I got introduced to the rest of the family and she offered to take me across the street to a gas station/deli or I wanted, to another inn about 2- miles away.  But, I assured her she’s done enough for me already and besides, I was cutting into her family time.  So we said goodbye and I trudged off to my cabin.  
Just like they said, the key was by the door so I let myself in and was a little surprised at how sparse it was.  Two two beds, a nightstand, a lamp, an overhead light, one 1 foot square shelf and another 1x3 foot shelf with Four pegs to hang stuff beneath.  That’s it.  Oh, and a broom and dustpan in the corner.  They did have towels on each bed so I took off for the showers about 200 yards away.  That felt great.  I rinsed out my hiking clothes and headed back.I then went to the deli gas station and ordered a pizza and bought a six-pack of beer.  When I sat down on the deli side waiting for my pizza, I cracked a beer and started drinking it.  A little while later the manager comes over in a panic and says you can’t drink in here!  I said I didn’t know that so aintold him I’d just down it real quick and hide the bottle so I did.  He was OK after that.  So, my pizza came and I ate it and talked to Sudan again.  Then I walked back over to the cabin and crashed.  I slept good last night!","Hawk Mountain Campground

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592310,"so I slept great and in the morning my rash(es) was mainly gone thanks in large part to the anti-chafe Body Glide stick I’d thrown in my pack from my running gear back home.  That stuff’s awesome.  So I re-organized my pack this morning and I’m looking around my cabin discovered a small square electric heater.  So, I plugged it in and sorted all my wet gear in front and above it on the shelf hooks so it could dry out.  The cabin got really hot but I didn’t mind.  It was raining and windy out and I wasn’t in it.  I was able the night before to call and extend my stay a day too so all was good.  I fell asleep again around 10:30 and woke up around 12:00.  I had sorted out stuff to ship home so I looked up the post office hours, it’s right behind the deli/gas station and fortunately they had just opened.  So I took my bag of stuff there and sent it home.  It weighed in at just over seven pounds.  Good riddence. My pack should be around 32 pounds tomorrow considering what I ate, the trail magic and he shipment home.
So I went to the deli after that and got an order of wings which I ate there and bought three liters of water and went back to the cabin.  Since then all my clothes and gear are dry, I am catching up on this journal, I made reservations for tomorrow at the Blood Mountain cabins on the other side of Blood Mountain by Neel Gap and I started reading the paperback I brought, In His Own Write & A Spaniard In The Works by John Lennon.  I read it many years ago but I thought I’d read through it again and then leave it in one of the shelters for someone else.  I got another copy at home anyhow.  
So it’s 10:15 now and the rain just kicked in heavy as well as thunder for the first time today.  That’ll make for great sleeping.  I’m just finishing off this journal entry and the last of my Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and I’m going to bed.
Until tomorrow and the other side of Blood Mountain, the tallest mountain on the AT in Georgia.","Woody Gap and Suches, GA

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592574,"I’m quickly losing track of what day it is, which is nice!  I woke up early, got cleaned up, re-packed strategically, and since it was already overcast and drizzling, went ahead and put my pack cover and poncho on.  The ponch’s advantages over a rain suit are that with the side snaps, it breathes much better and the back of the poncho over the pack gives that extra layer of water protection to your pack stuff and best of all keeps water from running down your back between your back and the pack.  It does make you look like Quasimodo but so what. Functionality not fashion.  
So by 7:40 I was out the door and on my way with all my gear dry and no major aches and pains. I started hitching towards Woody Gap but no one picked me up.  Only about 6 vehicles came by during the 2-mile walk along GA-60 and I can’t blame them for not licking me up.  Once I had gotten on 60, the rain picked up and became a downpour.  I was walking along the road at a pretty good clip for me, about 18 minutes a mile, and before long I was at the trail junction.  I took a short break under the awning of the trail map and information big board and resituated everything.  There was an old beat up van sitting in the corner of the parking lot right next to me and a guy fiddling around as well with stuff and then he got in the front passenger side of the van.  Just one guy, I didn’t see anyone else.  Anyhow, after a couple of minutes he comes over, the van was only about 15 feet from where I was, and he asks me if I need a ride anywhere.  He was an older gentleman, older than me, at least, so probably around 65.  I’m sure he had the best of intentions but right away I thought of Uncle Ernie, for any of you The Who fans.  I realize that was an unfair assessment of the guy because I also realize there are people who live all along the trail who are just plain nice and consider it an honor and privilege to help out the hikers.  Many of them are hikers themselves and/or simply lonely and enjoy the conversation and sense of usefulness.  He was originally from West Virginia, which made me think even more about Uncle Ernie.  Well, I chatted just long enough to get my gear set, said thanks for the offer but I didn’t need a ride as I was heading on over Blood Mountain.  His parting words were, “watch out for the snakes, the rain brings ‘em out”, like I needed to hear that. 
So I started off and right away I come to a wooden sign at the trailhead.  Neel Gap-11.3 miles, Blood Mountain-9 miles, so off I go.
I had my trepidations and anxieties about Blood Mountain for several reasons.  One was that after dumping 7 pounds from my pack weight (and probably another 2-3 in food eaten/given away), would it really make a big difference?  Well, more on that later.  Another concern was that I’d heard from several sources, people who grew up or still live in Georgia, that the Mountain is the first real test you get and the most difficult in Georgia.  Self-doubt crept in and I had to ask myself am I really in shape for this?  Do I have the physical ability to do this?  After all, I’m not a spry young 50-year old anymore, I’m 58!  But, what my head’s argument countered with is you’re a distance runner.  You’ve been a distance runner for 45 years.  On top of that, (and I really do think about this while I’m hiking), you’re a Kempsville Cross Country alumnus, and more so a Piccillo protege (for anyone reading this who doesn’t know who Piccillo, or “Pic” is, he was my cross country and track coach my senior year and one of the winningest and most respected coaches in the Eastern Region of Virginia).  His runners are still a tight knit group and I know many of them are reading this.  We are all still very much in touch with each other.  My third concern was the treacherousness of it due to the recent, and current, rain and the recent storm winds.  While there’s the old paradox, I guess you’d call it, that if a tree falls in the woods and no one’s around does it make a sound?  Well, if a tree falls in the woods and you ARE around, you better be pretty alert and have your wits about you because you don’t want a tree coming down on you.  I’d heard several horror stories just the day before if that very thing happening. The threat of snakes and other critters didn’t really bother me.  I had done enough reading and planning that I was very confident I was prepared for any encounter.  Besides, I’ve trained in Seashore State Park in Virginia Beach for 45 years and the way I run and hike, my eyes are very focused at the ground about 10 feet in front of me and I’m blessed to be able to detect the slightest movement quickly ( examples of that later in my story).  I’ve come across copperheads and water moccasins, sometimes literally run/jumped over them, on the trails.  I also don’t listen to anything like a radio or have any earbuds or anything that will distract or diminish my hearing.  I am very alert to the sounds peripherally around me. 99+ percent of the time the ambient sounds of critters are either birds or squirells.  But, it’s the other 0. whatever percent you gotta be concerned about.  If it is a louder heavier sound, it really gets your attention.  Is it a “widow maker” (a hanging branch that finally falls from overhead), a tree falling, or a big critter like a fox, deer or, up here, a bear?  Lastly, where was I going with this?  Oh, Blood Mountain concerns.  Well, with a name like Blood Mountain, who wouldn’t be concerned?  Actually, it got its name because of a battle between the Creek and Cherokee and the ground literally running red with blood.  Great!  So now I gotta worry about ancient Creek and Cherokee burial grounds and the spirits of the dead!  
So anyhow, I digress.  I’m a Richard and we tend to do that.
Big Cedar Mountain was my first climb, about 400 feet over 4/10ths of a mile right away and it was pretty much a breeze.  The lighter pack was making a big difference.  The trail from there is rolling hills slowly climbing to the base of Blood 6-1/2 miles away.  Blood climbs on its southern face about 800 feet over 1-1/2 miles so it’s not that bad.  My legs and left msg felt worked but invigorated and I was able to power up it without as many breaks as I’d had on Sassafras. Maybe I was getting my trail legs early! I stopped at several vistas but it was too foggy and overcast to see very far.  The fogginess gave the mountain that eerie feeling which was really cool.  I’m not a spooked individual so I wasn’t concerned about Cherokee or Creek specter’s looming in the trees.  I’ve got photos I just have to figure out how to upload them.  
At the top of Blood is the Blood Mountain shelter.  It’s pretty famous along the AT, an old stone and wood beam building about 15 feet square.  As soon as I approached a voice from inside welcomed me.  Specters?, no, a fellow biker taking a break.  I never caught her name but she was a 20-ish through-hiker doing the trail north-to-south, so she was a day or two from finishing.  She was from Michigan, so the cold north start made sense, but she had lived in Newport News when her dad was in the military.  I get that more times than not. The place I’m writing this from, the guy who gave me my coffee also lived in Newport News once.  Anyhow (I am aware I say that a lot but so what), she had lost 60 pounds on the trail!  Good for her!  No sooner does she take off and I hear a thud on the shelter floor as I’m resting my pack and drinking electrolyte mix.  I look around and there’s large mouse or a small rat in front of the entrance. It had fallen from a beam above and I guess it landed on it’s head because it wasn’t dead but lying on its side with a kinda “what the f___ just happened look on its little beady-eyed face.  So I took a picture.  A little about rhe shelters, they are all along the trail, most three-sided very rudimentary outposts if you will, for the hikers to take refuge.  The rodents in particular and the bears have figured out that where there’s hikers, there’s food, so the rodents congregate in and around the shelters for freebies.  Why hunt for food when it’s so easy to get?  So I left the shelter and got about 50 yards away and realized I’d left my trekking poles (lifesavers, literally) leaning against the wall outside the shelter.  So I went back and when I looked in, Ellis, my nickname now for the mouse, was gone.  I guess it shook it off and moved on and so did I.  

More to follow...
So, same day, Friday, June 1, different venue in Helen, GA to catch up the journal.
The north side or downside in my case of Blood is steeper and I can’t really say more treacherous, it is a challenge rain or shine, in my case rain.  Again, thank God for trekking poles and if you don’t know how to use them, you’ll learn pretty quick coming off of a mountain.  
The north side of Blood is a 1300 foot decent into Neel Gap over 2.5 miles, not too bad a slope, right?  Well, most of it is over rock slabs that sometimes span 60+ feet across and spill over the fog-covered edge into the great abyss.  Do, again, you have to pay attention and also look for the white blazes, in this case painted on the rock itself because there are no trees to paint it on.  One time I got, well, not lost, but disoriented at a huge rock slab so I backtracked 20 yards and I saw the blaze painter leading over the left edge of the mountainside and I thought. WTF? As I got closer, carefully, it tucked under and veered off to the left on a small trail you couldn’t see from above so boom!  Off I went, after taking photos of course.  Some of the vistas are spectacular even in the fog/cloud/rain covered sky and it reinforced that’s the main reason I’m here.  Most people will never get to experience this.  Really cool!  
So I start my descent and within 1/8th of a mile I hear voices coming up.  It was a couple from Florida and they were just out day hiking from Neel Gap, my destination to Blood summit and back.  So we talked for about 5-minutes and we hear someone descending at a rapid rate over my shoulder.  So we stop and look and this younger 20-something wearing running shorts and a more mimalist pack, no shirt, comes flitting by, and all I can think of is, man, if I was 18 again I’m with you, brother.  Simply amazing, on the wet slippery mountain rocks but he was parkouring it rock to rock and as he passed he says, “going for the course record”.  Again, amazing!  2100 miles of this to Maine.  Needless to say I didn’t see him again.
I have learned about myself that I favor my left leg on descending steps and my right leg on ascending steps.  Without getting into the anatomy of it all, all I can figure is my right knee is still recovering from the broken off femur head cartilage I suffered in an indoor 3000 meter race in January, 2017.  It will absorb the jolt stepping g down but it doesn’t much like the exertion of stepping up.  My right leg it’s the heel.  I have to deal with plantar fasciitis and a nagging heel spur so it dowsn’t Like coming down on that but going up it’s my go-to leg.  Sometimes in the expediency of things I forget and I’lquickly reminded to get my lead legs straight, a little painfully but nothing major.  The other issue that I was very concerned about but very pleased so far with the outcome is I suffer fromMorton’s neuroma in both feet.  While it flares a little in my right foot on the trail and so far not in my left, I power through it and it will abate.  All I can figure is that the rocks and roots I’m having to endure actually cause my foot to flex and bend so much that I’m torquing it out.  Funny, I can’t run a full marathon without stopping and taking my shoes off and massaging the forefoot because of the Morton’s pain but on the trail, I’ve done upwards of 21-1/2 miles at a stretch and the Morton’s is a small inconvenience that the more miles I do and the tougher the terrain the better it feels.  I can dig it, in the words of what’s-his-name from the movie, “Warriors”. Thanks 
So back to the trail.  I got into Neel Gap, I forget what time now, I think around 3:30. So, Runkeeper said 13.3 miles in 6 hours and 8 minutes so I was pretty pleased.  The trail literally goes through Walasi-Yi Center, an outdoor store, so I went in and asked where the Blood Mountain cabins were.  I had a cabin reserved there.  To explain a little.  My goal is to HIKE the AT, not CAMP the AT.  If I can logistically schedule my hikes cabin-to-cabin or town-to-town then I will.  Most people who hike the trail are on a limited budget and can’t do that tmr.  I am very fortunate in that I don’t have a budget so once I’ve got my hike on for the day, give me a bed and a shower and I’m good to go.  So In Walasi-Yi I ask for directions to the cabins the whole time their Pit Bull has taken a liking to me and is non-stop licking the salt and blood off my legs (I hit a thorny vine a few miles back). Who am I to complain?  It felt good.  How much for the little dog?? I asked and had been relishing a nice cold draft beer for the previous many miles, my incentive coming off the mountain, so I asked, “where can I get a beer”?  We don’t sell beer in here, you gotta go into Blairsville.  UGH!!!  I’m not thumbing into Blairsville!  So I walked on down the road to my cabins which had a pizzeria attached to it.  Great!! Pizza and beer!  So I go up to the cabin office door and I swear, there the hours are posted and it has hours for every day except Wednesday.  Wednesday they are closed, as well as the laundry, restaurant, everything.  Crap!  My key is in an envelope attached to the door.  Can this get any better?  Yes.  The cabin has all the amenities, kitchen, full bath and a TV with DirecTv.  Great, I can catch up on the weather, news and veg out while I plan tomorrow.  Only problem, DirecTV set-top box doesn’t power up.  I call the office.  Their day off, etc, etc.  oK, so what, I’ve got my John Lennon book “In His Own Write & A Spaniard In the Works” to read (again after 40 years), who needs tv?  Anyhow, I can get weather updates on my I-phone.  Wrong!  Very limited cell coverage and I can’t even do that.  I can’t even call into Blairsville and get someone to come get me to drive me into town to get a decent meal.  So after hours of trying, I relented to eating beef jerky, dehydrated fruit and vegetables and pistachios for dinner.  They did have a fire place and wood for sale on the honor system so I grabbed a bundle, started a fire to dry my gear, read and planned tomorrow.  About 10:30 I called it a day and nustled into a nice, warm bed falling asleep to the rain outside.  Sure beat a sleeping bag in a hammock on the trail...Until tomorrow.","Suches II

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592623,"So to continue my ongoing 40-day trek, 
So I planned on awaking at 6:00am, getting cleaned up again, packing my stuff and being on the trail by 7:00.  Well, I am blessed with a rather acute circadian rhythm and I haven’t woken to an alarm clock since my navy days, unless it’s like to catch a flight or something and even then, I usually beat the clock.  So, no different on Thursday morning.  Wednesday night I said to myself, “self, set your brain’s alarm for 6:00 am” and true to form my eyes fluttered open to the sound of birds outside my window and I looked at the clock and it was 5:52.  Cool!  8 more minutes.  But I got up at 5:58.  So once I got things together, I was gone and on down the road the 3/10ths of a mile to catch the trail junction at Walasi-Yi, which passes through the actual building, more like a dogtrot section of the building then the main building itself.  Anyhow, immediate uphill and my legs are still waking up so I’m taking it easy as I go.
I had decided the day before I’m gonna shoot for Unicoi Gap and then thumb or call a cab into Helen, GA 9 miles away.  21.3 miles of hiking.   I was not all that confident but I planned it out and thought well, miles every thirty minutes counting breaks I’ll be there long before sunset.  The town and more so the thought of a nice hotel room served as incentive as well as my decision to count Friday as a zero day if I made it.  I decided to break the hike into three 7-mile segments and take minor 2-5 minute breaks at the 3-4 mile points.  With my Runkeeper app set to tell me (in her pre-programmed French acccent) when I hit each 1/2 mile increment I was all set.  “Ooh-La-La”, she tells me.  “Think of all the croissants you can now eat!”, is one of her sayings.  I don’t even like croissants but hey, it motivates you none-the-less.
So no one around and I’ve got the solitude of the trail to myself and I’m cruising away.  3/4 of a mile from where I started today and up Levelland Mountain, a nice 800 foot climb over 1-1/2 miles, I hear a loud crashing through the ferns and brush 20 yerds to my 10:00 off the trail.  I immediately stop, freeze, look that way and there’s a  black bear cub trying to shimmy up a tree.  It gets about 15 feet up, drops back down, runs around the other side of the tree so that the tree itself is between it and me, shimmies up about 15 feet again, drops down, and takes off through the ferns and disappears.  This all happened in about 4 seconds.  My immediate thought was, where’s mama.  I reached for my bear spray, instead of my I-phone for pictures, and I couldn’t reach it!  I had kept it on my left hip belt but it sat too far back to grab quickly.  When I finally did get it out, after about 10 seconds, it still had the packaging tie-wraps holding the trigger in place.  So, I pulled out my mini-Leatherman, cut off the tie-wraps and thought, what an idiot I am.  30 seconds have gone by and if I had been between mama bear and cub, I’d be in a world of hurt!!  So, I walked on up the trail about 50 yards where I could assess the situation and make sure the bears were gone, I took off my pack, repositioned my bear spray to my right shoulder strap (I’m left-handed) with a carabiner and I was again good to go and the adrenaline rush served me well for the next 6 miles.  Sorry, but no pics of the bear but it was a beautiful cub, hard to judge but maybe 60-80 pounds and with the characteristic light brown patch on its chest.  I was never scared but I attribute that to reading two bear books prior to the hike, the one by Steven Herrera, the leading bear expert in the world.  Freeze, face the bear, don’t make eye contact, assess, don’t run, and if need be, make a lot of noise and make yourself as big as possible.  Check.  Didn’t have to do half that.
So I’m cruising along chewing up miles in the early morning and I can feel my phone vibrate on my arm.  I carry it on my left bicept in a velcro sleeve.  So I stop at a convenient scenic overlook to see what’s up.  Well it’s a text and a voicemail from Susan telling me she is concerned for my safety because she has heard that Helen, GA has endured a major flood from the storm rains and she knows that is my destination.  So I text and call her and assure her that I’m 17 miles still from Helen and I am at 3700 feet altitude, Helen is at 3000 feet altitude, water flows downhill and I’m good, I’ll deal with it when I get close in 8 hours or so.  So off I go again.  So on the meantime, I’m constantly hearing thunder but encountering no rain, no major winds, no people, it’s me and the AT and life is good.  
I’m tracking my miles and fluids and realize I’m close to my 7-mile break and Tesnatee Gap is coming up.  It’s early but you take water where you can get it.  So Tesnatee is coming off of Cowrock Mountain, a 1100 foot descent over one and I was practically trotting down it, anticipating my break and trying to keep time.  So once at Tesnatee, nothing more than a small pull-off off of GA-348, I crossed over to where the trail picks up on the northern side and water is gushing through a 18” drainage pipe off of the roadway and into the woods so I offload my pack, break out my phone charger, recharge it, break out my 64 oz dirty bag and fill it up as it runs out of the pipe into the woods.  While it is filtering I ate a Pro Bar even though I didn’t feel hungry, ate some jerky, mainly for the salt and protein, drank both of my 1/2 liter bottles of electrolyte solutions and just hung out beside the trail and the adjacent road 15 feet away waiting for my water to filter.  I pulled out my trail map to see what the next segment had in store and realized I had an immediate 500 foot climb over 1/2 mile.  Ugh!!!  So I downed as much water as I could, got strapped back in and took off.  I was renewed and fresh.  Thunder still but no rain so far.  
So on down the trail I went.  Remember my ability to see movement however small?  Well, I get on a flatter section of the trail and something very tiny is moving around before my feet and I look down and see two bumble bees fighting.  So I stop and check it out and then realize they are not fighting, they are getting it on.  So, I take a picture.  I’ll post it once I figure out how to.  Today turned out to be critter day.  I saw and photographed a cool-colored centipede earlier, saw a chipmunk, a salamander and a really cool light green fern field.  Hard to explain.  You had to be there.  
Mike Ellis and Linda Weirsch know what I mean.  Mike is one of my Kempsville cross country buds and as boyfriend/girlfriend they thru-hiked the entire 2100 mile AT in 1990 when Mike got out of the Navy.  He was 27 at the time and in my mind, and his probably, that was the opportune time to do it.  They completed the full trail 1 day shy of 6 months, miluch of it Mike carrying a 90-pound backpack. Thank God for technology!!!
Anyhow, I digress again but shout out to Mike and Linda!  They also hiked and met Bill Irwin, the blind man who thru-hiked the AT the same year with his Shepherd guide dog, Orient, trail name, the Orient Express.   Bill’s book was the last of 13 I read about the AT prior to me setting out on this adventure.  
So, back to the trail logic.  I scrambled up the mountain out of Tesnatee and into Whitley Gap, from there it was flat/rolling over three minor hills, or so I thought, until a slow climb up Sheep Rock 4-miles away.  Well, those 3 hills were not necessarily a major pain but they left their mark and let you know you were going uphill.  
At Sheep Rock I took a brief break to reassess and thought, 12 miles down, 9 to go, and all flat, rolling and down from here.  WRONG!!
In the meantime, I have crossed paths with a mom and her two daughters who were day-hiking out of Unicoi.  I asked them about Helen and they said it took several mud slides and flooding but was assessable.  I told them about the bears but also that I could hear them, her and the girls, from 1/4 mile out and the cachophony would scare any critters away.  Not to be mean, of course, as mom agreed and referred to herself and daughters as “Chatty Cathies” and off we each went in opposite directions.
At one point, not sure when, but I sensed movement crossing the trail in front of me, immediately in front of me.  So I stopped, looked down, and the “stick” moved.  It was a beautiful 8” ring neck snake crossing left to right not feeling too photogenic by its nature, but I was determined and actually talked to it so I said, I’m not leaving until I get a good shot of you, and it paused and I did get a good shot.  
So I zoomed on looking forward to mile 14 and my next major break.  I was about 30 minutes off pace but I figured the worst was behind me and I’d make it up on the last 7-mile leg.  The last several hours I’d heard the rumbling of thunder but so far no rain.  All good.
So I get near Poplar Stamp Gap and run across a couple out for a 14-mile day hike going the opposite direction.  So, I ask them about Unicoi Gap and the town of Helen and they too tell me they just came from there and despite the mudslides and flooding, it is assessible.  Cool!  I mentioned about the “smooth sailing” in my direction to Unicoi according to the guide I’m using and the guy says, “it’s not flat, it’s gradual upslope from here to Blue Mountain, then a 1000 foot drop over boulders into Unicoi”.  Yeah, what do you know, dayhiker  who just hiked it.  So I set off undeterred.  
So I cruise on into mile 14 around Cold Springs Gap and as I approach I can hear the water from a distance so I know there’s a source ahead.  So off to my left is water just flowing over a rock ledge just 10 feet off the trail.  Well, my phone was down to a 30% charge and I could use the rest so I stripped off the pack, hooked my phone up to charge, Runkeeper had me at 14.16 miles so I was right on.  I took my time, filtered 64 oz off the rocks as it fell, and it was cold water.  Couldn’t wait to gulp it down.  In the meantime, I started chomping pistachios and jerky and stripped off my shirt and ballcap and rinsed each out upder the cascading water.  Then I took my bandana, I keep it looked through my left-side hop belt zipper loop, rinsed it out and took a bandana bath.  That felt awesome!  Ice cold water on a humid 80 degree day.  So with 7 miles to go I was determined to “camel up”.  Trail term for drinking as much as you can, resupplying and moving on.
This may sound gross but it is very critical to your health and survival, but if you are not sweating, bad news.  Equally, if you do not pee, even worse news.  So you have to monitor that stuff.  When and if you do pee, you have to pay attention to the quantity and color.  If it is dark you are not getting enough fluids but equally as important, the necessary electrolytes.  Well, I had only peed so far that day like trickles despite all I drank and it was tea colored so while I was concerned, I felt good and I knew I was doing all the right things by intaking the electrolyte mixtures with water, filtered water itself, and jerky and pistachios that had salt.  So during my 14-mile break I literally downed two 16-ounce electrolyte mixtures and 64 ounces of cold filtered water, then refilled each and set off feeling great.  
No sooner I get 200 yards up trail and the skies explode.  I am inundated by a torrential downpour.  
Fortunately, I am cameled up and fresh as can be.  I was surrounded by forest so I wasn’t too concerned about lightning and I thought to myself m, if ranger Rick popped out of the woods and chastised me for being an idiot in the woods during a thunderstorm, where was I to go?  I cranked out 4 miles as hard as I could go under the rush of adrenaline and in the forefront of my mind, as I’d hit up slopes, the voice of Pic, my coach, yelling at me to “suck it up!!” as well as imagining my team mates and me doing interval work up the “hills” of Mount Trashmore in Virginia Beach.  Well, it worked and I didn’t die.  I rolled to the top of Blue Mountain just outside of Unicoi Gap 1000 feet below.  I stopped, pulled off my pack and pulled out my charger, then phoned Country Inn & Suites nine miles away in Helen.  No vacancy.  Crap!  I did slightly panic then. So instead of being choosey, I called the first hotel in my guide, the Helendorf River Inn.  Yes, they have vacancy for today and another zero day for tomorrow. After 3 hours of speed hiking through rain and an overall 21.6 mile day without adequate food in a day and a half, I was taking another day off.  So I ask if someone can come pick me up at Unicoi Gap and she says no.  Really?  I’ll pay, a lot, just come get me.  She tells me to cal Alpine Taxi and make sure I ask for “Dave”.  OK, got the number?  So she gives me the number and I call Dave and tell him the situation.  I’m on top of Blue Mountain 1.2 miles from Unicoi Gap on my way down and need a ride rhe last nine miles into Helen.  SpnDabe says He’ll be there in 40 minutes it’ll take me T least that long to get down.  Dave, is that. Challenge??  So I take off determined to get to the bottom before Dave gets there, plus, Indon’t like To make people wait.
Oh yeah, before I forget, prior to all this when I was cruising through the last few miles and it was raining, I heard a lot of loud crashing off my 10:00 again so Infroze and looked down off the trail to my left.  I heard a lot of something running away and finally caught a glimpse of about 8-10 deer about 50 yards away running further into the woods.  I heard water flowing from a spring so I knew they had been just drinking and I spooked them.  So I walked on and about 30-seconds later I hear a few more large animals scamper off in the same direction.  Never saw them, so I figure more deer or possibly bear getting water further up the steam to me than the deer had been.  Either way, I wasn’t going to investigate. 
So, back to Dave.  The descent was very rocky and slippery but I had become pretty adept at using my trekking poles and learning my left foot from my right so which to plant first and which to climb first.  All in all, I only had three minor slips in the 21.6 mile day and one controlled fall.  So, get to the bottom of this 1000 got mountain and let’s go to civilization.  So as I get near, I can’t see the road but I can hear the vehicles on it.  Well now I’m really flying down the switchbacks alternating between looking at the trail and my trail watch.  6:07 when I called Dave, it’s 6:45 now.  Crap!  I can beat Dave!!  So I get almost down and the trail backtracks and parallels the road and I can look through the trees and see the parking lot 100 yards away.  The road is beside and below me only 5 yards distant.  All of a sudden I hear that now-familiar loud crash through the trees and brush 50 yards or so off my 10:00 again.  So, I freeze, catch a multi-second glimpse of black fur scampering for higher ground, am thankful I got to see two bears in one day and I mosey on to meet up with Dave.
OK, so to finish today’s odyssey off, I get to Dave’s. An and I go, did you see that?  He says, what?   I say, the bear!  He’s like, whatever, get in.  Needless to say they see a lot of bears down here. 
So Dave drops me at Helendorf Inn and I get to finally shower and clean up, unpack, after a nearly 12 hour hoke day. So Inhad asked Dave, since he lives here. Where to go eat and get a beer.  Well, first of all, when you drive into Helen, a town of only 1-1/2 miles wide along a main drag, it is Bavarian themed.  Everything.  So fro someone who likes, check that, loves Bavarian beer, I was in heaven.  So Dave sends me to Cowboys & Angels.  So after I get cleaned up I was over there and get their largest steak, fries, ‘cause the grease will do me good
On the trail and broccoli, because Inlike it and it’s good for you.  So sitting a few stools down are two guys and a girl.  So they start talking to me.  They are bike touring around the south out of Alabama.  The one guy, Daniel, is a computer programmer working a government contract at an Air Force base in Alabama.  His girlfriend, Elizabeth, owns her own company but I can’t recall doing what and the other guy, Keith, Indidn’t recall what he did.  So we sat talking along with the bartender Ashley until they closed at 10:00 and Elizabeth asks Ashley what’s the best place to go late night.  So Ashley says Monday’s up the street 3/4 mile, named after he founders.  Right away For all you baseball fans Inthonk of Rick Monday who used to play for the A’s and I think the Dodgers bit I never got a chance to ask if there was any connection.  Maybe I will tonight.  So anyhow, the theeesome tell me they are heading to Monday’s and maybe they’ll see me later.  So I finish eating and Cowboys is closing to I ask Ashley how to get to Monday’s.  She says it’s 3/4 mile down the main road on the left behind Circle K, can’t miss it.  She asks if I need a ride.  I’m like, Ashley, I just hiked 21.6 miles to get here, I think I can handle 3/4 mile.  So I get to Monday’s and the other theee are there so we start talking, typical stuff, religion, politics and sports and at some point the older gent to my left starts chiming I’m when we’re talking military stuff.
So this grey-haired 70-ish lanky cantankerous “Old” guy starts in (later found out he was 72).  So he’s a local since 1972 and starts telling me all about being a search & rescue pilot in Nam and around that time Keith is asleep at the bar and the other two tote him off so Michael, the pilot, and I start chatting more.  Turns out he’s hiked the trail theee times, twice south to north and once north to south.  His trail name is Joshua.  So he shows me this bear claw he has around his neck, says he shot the bear back in the 1970 before he transplanted to Helen in Staunton, Virginia.  Well right away Ininterupt Joshua and say, I’m from Virginia.  He even pronounced “Staunton” correctly so I knew he wasn’t b.s.ing me.  So anyhow, he was an ornery sort of fellow, very much the stereotype of what you’d imagine  a coggery, ornery, pissed-of-at society old guy could be.  Every time I’d try to break away and start watching the Braves-Nationals game or the Cleveland-Golden State game he’s engage me again.  Finally, alright Josh, you got me, I’m your bud tonight, talk away.  So Josh did, that’s all he needed was a sympathetic ear and he went on about Nam, about the VA and his terminal cancer that was supposed to have killed him 20 years ago, about how he didn’t have anyone in his life and didn’t need anyone, on and on.  I listened and every once in a while, interjected something that I knew would fire him up like, Jane Fonda’s pretty cool, what do you think, Josh?  Anyhow, out of nowhere, Josh, like it’s an afterthought, pulls a Keno ticket out of his pocket and goes over to an electronic reader to see if its a winner.  Well he comes back and tells me it’s a big winner because the readers won’t cash you if it’s above $600.  So he calls over the owner’s son and asks him to verify the numbers.  So pretty soon the owner’s son comes back over with the ticket and goes, Josh, this is a $2000 ticket.  Well Josh thanks him and goes on drinking his beer, no reaction what’s-so-ever.  So he turns to. me and says, you here that, $2000.  I said, I heard, Josh, congrats.  So no sooner the bar owner comes over, congrats Josh, Josh tips the bar $10 and the owner’s son for looking up the numbers and Josh places $5 on the bar and asks for a Keno form.  She brings it, Josh opts for a computer pick for all five picks, she runs the numbers and I swear I’m lying I’m dying she comes back over to Josh and goes, Joshua, you just hit for $4000 more.  Well Joshua thanks her, gives her another $10 too, turns to me and goes, see that, I just hit for $4000, like no expression, no celebration, no exuberance, he could have just as well been saying, I just passed gas.  I said yeah Josh, that’s awesome!  $6000 on two tickets!  Can I rub your head??!  I was way more excited than he was. 
So to end this saga for today the bar closes and I’ve got out stuck in my head the directions Ashley had told me earlier, down the street on the left only I mentally left the, “behind Circle K” part out.  I had only had theee beers in there too so I was fine!  So I walk out prepared to walk down Main Street the less-than 3/4 mile to my hotel on the same side of the street.  So Ingo our the front door of Monday’s and turn right and start hoofing it fast.  Well it had started to rain again and I’m wearing my “town” clothes, the one set you save for just such occasions, and I’m getting dumped on and trucking along up the street as fast as I can go.  Well I start start passing establishments and thinking, I don’t recall that, and so on, but I didn’t pay it much mind because I had been distracted on the way to Monday’s talking to Susan in the phone.  So I swear, I’m at the point where I know I’m going the wrong way but I keep running through my head, “down the steeet on the left”, so to go back” down the street on the right”.  After about 3/4 mile and I’l soaked through, an epiphany hits me and I think, Circle K, BEHIND the Circle K is Monday’s it isn’t on Main Street but a side street.  So I cuss my own dumbass for a few seconds, remind myself that I’m a seasoned veteran submarine NAVAGATIONAL electronics technician and I can’t possibly get “lost”, and mosey on down the road backtracking the 3-4 mile Plus the other nearly 3/4 mile I had to walk anyhow.  But you know what?  I got to see a really killer lightning storm above the Gap (and thankfully not get hit) and my Salomon trail runners got washed off, so Inwas glad I got, in the words of Daniel Boone, misplaced (never lost).  So ended the day.OK. I didn’t spell check all this so bear with me.","Neel Gap

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593129,"so after the long day yesterday, I had decided on a zero day in Helen mainly to plan and rest.  Helen only has a population of 430 people but there was sure a lot more than that here.  Turns out there's a bike rally going on and a hot air balloon festival, so there's actually a couple thousand people here.  Too bad I'm writing this 4 days after the fact because things run together and it's hard for me to recall.  I'll have to do a better job of keeping the paper journal updated and then updating the online version when I get into towns.  I spent some time in the afternoon at the Bier Garden catching up on my carbo-loading and met a lot of people, some local, some from in and around the state.  Everyone very friendly and helpful.  Small world but two of the guys working at the Bier Garden are submarine veterans.  Word spreads in a small town and I found myself later that evening fielding questions about the AT.  I found that surprising because Helen is so close to it.  I was getting questions from locals as much as out-of-towners.  I guess it's like me being from Virginia Beach (since 1967) and not having been t the aquarium until last year for the first time.  I've begun encouraging locals to at least get out on the trail for 1/2 mile or so so they can get a feel for what hikers who visit their town are experiencing.  I didn't stay out too late or drink too much because Sunday I had a 17-mile hike to complete from where I'd left off a t Unicoi Gap to Dick's Creek Gap.  While I'd been out that night, I called Dave to coordinate him picking me up in the morning and was asking him if I should stay the next night in Haiawassee or back in Helen.  He suggested Helen because things were a lot closer than in Hiawassee, so I took his suggestion.  When I got to the hotel and booked the additional night, I realized that since Dave since Dave was gong to be dropping me off at Unicoi in the morning and back up at Dick's Creek late that afternoon and bringing me right back to Helen, why did I need to take my entire pack and stuff on Sunday's hike?  I slept well Saturday and fell asleep to some old Bette Davis movie on TCM...","

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593136,"So Dave picked me up at the Helendorf Hotel a little after 7:00am and after a quick breakfast of coffee, a bagel and 6 of those little pre-packaged chocolate donuts, I was off once again.  Because Dave was going to pick me up at Dick's Creek later that afternoon, I was going to be ""slack packing"" this leg of the hike, meaning I was carrying a minimal load.  I still carried my pack, but all it had in it was a wind breaker, my water filtration system, (2) full 16 oz. water bottles, by bear spray (always) and some jerky.  All in all it probably weighed 10 lbs and 4 of that was pack weight alone.  Needless to say I was feeling light carrying 20 lbs. less than normal.  right out of Unicoi going north the AT goes up Rocky Mountain, a 1000 foot climb over 1-1/2 , miles.  Slack packing or not, that'll wake you up and get the legs burning.  what goes up of course must come down and I was able to fly down the other side of Rocky Mountain and into Indian Grave Gap at about a 22-minute mile, compared to 33 minutes going up.  Immediately after Indian Grave is the long 2-1/2 mile up 1300 feet to the top of Tray Mountain.  After that it's a series of smaller ups and downs, none more than a 300 foot climb, for almost 6 miles until the base of Kelly Knob.  Well, it may be a knob, but it sure felt like a mountain at this point.  It is a steady climb of a mile going up 800 feet.  That one burned.  After Kelly though I was only 4 miles to Dick's Creek so I calculated my time based on my Runkeeper app and called Dave and said where I was and that I'd meet him at 4:00 at Dick's.  He seemed skeptical and said he'd be there between 4:00-4:30 but I said if that were the case, I'd be waiting on him.  Challenge on I took off.  Only one small hill over the four miles, a 250 foot climb right after getting to the base of Kelly Knob so no big deal.  I kept looking at my watch in that last mile and I was trotting/walking down the trail.  As I got to the last 100 yards here comes Dave walking up from the other direction.  My watch said 3:58.  Dave was surprised.  I told him I don't like to keep people waiting.  So, 17.29 miles in 8 hours and 7 minutes and a satisfying day.  Dave dropped me off back at the hotel and I was then able to get all my laundry done.  I later did some food shopping, called and talked to John McCabe and Charlie Doss, Kempsville cross country alums, and visited the bier garden again for re-hydration and planning.  Dave had told me that the next nearest town was 40 miles away and I was going to have to camp at least one night in the woods.  So, later that day I studied and pored over both of my guides, AWOL's (David Miller's AT hiker nickname) 2018 The A.T. Guide and the Appalachian Trail Association's 2018 Guide.  Dave was right and I'd have to figure a game plan so I decided on back-to-back 20 milers.  Wasn't sure if I could do it but I was going to try.  I actually refined that to a 22-miler and an 18-miler because I figured the psychological edge of doing something under 20 miles on the second day would be an advantage as well as the knowledge that I'm heading into town.  so the plan was to get up and over the 5500 foot Standing Indian Mountain late Sunday and stay at the northside base at Beech Gap.  Plus, I liked the name ""Beach"" Gap, being from Virginia Beach...","Helen, GA

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593279,"This was going to be a long and grueling day and to top it off, I’d have no hot shower, soft bed and a decent cooked meal at the end and I’d still be halfway to any of those.  
I got up at 6:15am and packed all my stuff, each time more strategically than the last with things like clothes, my sleeping bag and liner bag in the bottom, hygiene, medical and food in the middle and jacket and hydration filter kit at the top.  My solar phone charger sat in a zippered back pocket on the left and my wallet/money, comb, and DEET in a similar pocket on the right.  I kept my current guide page in a zip lock baggie in my right hip belt pouch along with Pro Bar gummies bites and in my left hip belt pouch I usually kept a big baggie of beef jerky.  On the zipper ring of that pouch I always kept my bandana.  My I-phone sat in an arm sleeve on my left arm and while in Helen, Mel from Bier Garden had turned me into a wire braided jacketed I-phone power cord.  He told me he’d gotten it from the Dollar Store so I’d walked down there on Saturday and gotten one for $15.  It’s 10 feet long!  So I had about two feet of that cord plugged between my charger and my phone so now my phone would stay charged all day long and I didn’t have to take breaks and wait for my phone to charge.  To take photos, I could pull the phone out of it’s sleeve and I still had plenty of cord to use it without unplugging it.
So I checked out around 7:15, sorry to see Helen go but I had to move on.  I had the same breakfast as Saturday and then Dave showed up a little early and we left for Dick’s Creek Gap.  
Dave and I talked the whole drive out and I felt like I’d known him for a while instead of the three days it’d been.  He dropped me off at the Gap around 8:25am and once againI was back on the AT.
Immediately I went into a low climb. It took my legs a while to get into the groove and this first climb didn’t help but I powered up it ok then had a brief down for 1/2 mile before another climb, this one 1.2 miles going up about 750 feet.  Then I had a couple more ups/downs before a long grade up from Blue Ridge Gap to Courthouse Bald, a distance of 4-1/2 miles climbing 3100 feet up to 4700 feet.  Through this stretch, I’d been running low on water and unfortunately passed a couple springs by earlier thinking there’ll be more ahead soon.  After all, the springs had been plentiful the previous week but I realized it hadn’t been raining like the week before and this not so many springs.  Finally, around the 10-mile mark, I saw a spring sign and peeled off the trail.  It wasn’t very far, only about 10 yards, and two guys were there doing the same thing.  When I asked where the spring was they pointed to a little cut-through and the trickle of water was only about 20 feet away.  It was so small and shallow that I couldn’t get water to flow into my 64 oz dirty bag.  I blew into the bag to inflate it and tried again that way and I was able to get about 1/4 of the bag full, hardly what I’d need.  But, I filtered that and just did it again.  Then I moved some rocks and silt and got my bag to sit lower in the narrow streamlet and I was able to get about half the bag to fill.  So I was finally able to filter enough to camel up and to fill my 2 16-oz electrolyte bottles and put about 40 oz in my clean 64 oz bottle.  
In he meantime, the three of us sat and talked.  They had started with a slightly larger group of friends the year before but we’d only able to do about a week each year.  The two wet only doing about 10 miles a day. When they asked where I was going and I told them Franklin in two days doing back-to-back 20’s, they expressed a bit of awe.  Now I’d told someone else what I was doing, there was no altering it if I’d wanted to. They took off up the trail about 5-minutes before I did and after about a thirty minute break I was in pursuit.  
I caught them within a mile and moved on.  Within the next couple of miles I passed the GA/NC state line marker and was a little disappointed that the metal tune there didn’t have the sign-in sheet/book in it.  Oh well.  Then it was on to Sharp Top and Courthouse Bald.  On the guide chart they looked steep but not that bad.  In reality, both of them wiped me out.  I had to stop every 20-50 yards to catch my breath.  It was a killer climb.  On top of that, the skies darkened and the thunder cracked above for over an hour and it began to sprinkle but no heavy rain so I kept my poncho put away but put my pack cover on.  I always kept those in a center back of the pack pocket side-by-side.  
Once Courthouse was done I had a series of rolling hills for 6 miles until the base of Standing Indian Mountain.  Heck, I was already dead tired and I still had 11-miles to go to the Beech.  I also was chasing time because I didn’t want to be hiking and setting up camp after sunset again.  
After another long water break at 12-miles, I tried to maintain miles around 30 minutes per mile and was able to average better than that.  Some, on downs, were 23’s but others, on ups, were 32’s.  I finally got to the base of Standing Indian and as I climbed the 2.5 miles to the top, I just kept looking at my watch and Runkeeper app and watching he sun get lower and lower.  The climb is almost a flat slope going up 1100 feet but at least it was a steady grade of switchbacks up the mountain.  Once I reached the top I was disappointed there was no good cut-outs or vistas for photos!  5600 feet or so up and no good unobstructed views!  I got to the other side where I’d start down and startled 3 dogs and the man and two women they were with.  We talked for just a minute or two and I told them where I was heading and they said I had a pretty easy down and that Beech Gap was a nice camping spot.  2.8 miles to go and the sun getting lower.  I had to pick it up. I clicked off a 25-minute mile and my last one was my fastest of the day in 23 but by then the sun was long gone and I was making my way in the twilight. Finally, with 6/10 of a mile to go it was just too dark.  I got out my mini flashlight and moved on finally arriving at Beech Gap at 9:12pm.  Days final tally:  21.58 miles in 12 hours and 45 minutes and total day’s elevation of 6100 feet.  I was tired and now I had to set up my stuff!  No one else was at Beech.As I pulled my stuff out I noticed my water bottle was empty but I had thought I had left about a 1/4 in it.  As I pulled my sleeping bag and silk bag liner out of their bottom compartment, some water trickled out and both the sleeping bag and liner were wet.  The liner took the brunt of it, it sopped it all up and was a useless ball of mush.  I guess I didn’t have the cap on the bottle tightly and it had leaked out.  My sleeping bag and liner are the only two things I didn’t have on dry bags.  Stupid, stupid, stupid!!!  Next town, dry bags!  So I got the hammock set up and by then, it was getting really windy and the temp had dropped drastically from a high that day in the mid 70’s to now somewhere in the low 40’s.  I had changed to dry clothes but I knew with no bag liner and a damp down sleeping bag, hypothermia might be a real concern tonight.  The down bag loses its insulating properties when it gets wet, so body heat in a damp bag gets you no where.  I hung my bear bag with all my food and hygiene stuff about 50 yards away and tried to turn in.  It really sucks getting into a damp sleeping bag after. Long day but at least I had the hammock to myself this time.  I clipped my pack to the atlas strap of the hammock and covered it with my poncho.  In the dark, it looked like my own personal sentry standing there, like the bears would care.Well, I got very little sleep that night and was so cold that I had to get up and put all my clothes on, except the wet ones I’d hiked in.  I was still not warm.  I thought about getting up, packing up and hiking throughout the night but opted wisely to stay put and just last it out.  I wasn’t getting any colder but I wasn’t getting any warmer.  So the night went...","Dick's Creek Gap, GA
",Beech Gap,"Jun 03, Sun",21.58
TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593323,"OK, I typed this once already this morning and the website times out on me and I lost it all so now here I go again.  I gotta remember to hit “save” every 10 minutes or so.
So after being awake most of the previous night and this morning, I awoke at 6:40am and got up.  It was still windy and cold out.  I went and got my bear bag and thankfully I must have strung it up right because no critters got to it.  So I took that back over to where my hammock was and then proceeded to break things down and repack. 
At 7:31am I started my Runkeeper app and headed up the trail.  (I’ll come back later to the journal and update the place names because where I’m at now, the Nantahala Outdoor Center, I don’t have my past guide maps on me to refer to.)
So I noticed when I got up that I had a new ache.  This one might be serious.  I had developed a sharp pain along the outside of my right ankle running up/down the ankle.  It was right along the area where the top of my Salomons were. Not good, I thought.  I pressed on (what else was I going to do) and just tried to monitor it, self diagnose ( I DID get a D in Anatomy & Physiology in college, after all, as I’m always bragging to Susan)and keep it from getting worse. Not sure at all how it happened.  I may have partially twisted it on a rock or root and maybe he pain did occur until the next morning.  At any rate, I was able to go and the pain would come and go.  Eventually throughout the day it mainly subsided so that was good.
As Inwas midway through my first climb that day, I came up on a young couple and I assumed the lead.  We talked throughout the ascent and I learned they were just out hiking for a few days and both were distance runners.  I told them of my background in running.  They were from a town near Atlanta.  At the top, they went on as this was the first of two scheduled breaks for me.  I called Susan, took some photos of the adjacent mountains and caught up on my hydration.  
So I start off again and soon I’m going up the incline leading to Albert Mountain.  Now on a guide page, Albert doesn’t look so bad.  It’s like a hiccup in the grade of the landscape, a nipple, if you will.  Well, Albert was a lot more than that!  It rises severely to 400 feet in about 3/10 of a mile.  The rise is so severe and over boulders, not rocks, that much of it is hand-to-hand.  The trekking poles don’t come into play much, now it is mountain climbing, with a 30-lb pack.  You have to gain momentum and go for it because if your weight takes you backwards, it’s 30 feet or more tumbling down the mountain.  The slope seemed to be at 70 degrees in places.  I doubt the photos (when I get them posted) will do it much justice.  It was so cool though to stop and catch my breath and look out over the horizon.  That and look right next to me at the mountain terrain itself and it reminded me of those original 1960’s Adam West Batman episodes when he and Robin would be going up the side of a building.  
So I survive the southern side climb of Albert in tact but tired and I come to a large rock flat spot on top where you can see all around.  By the way, before I forget, I winter camp with high school/college friends each year in the GW National Forest in February each year and one of the guys is named Albert.  I was cussing him the whole way up.  Next February the first thing I’m going to say to Albert is F-you and your damn mountain!!  Anyhow, I rest at the top, eat some jerky, drink some fluids, take some photos and call Susan.  She asks if I’ve climbed Albert yet.  I literally spun around and did a 360 and said, how did you know where I’m at?  I just did it.  
Well she’d been following me in AWOL’s book and had read ahead.  AWOL describes Albert similarly to the way I did.  Anyhow, talked for a bit and I got ready to head down.  I looked at my guide page and the north side looked just like the south and I thought, crap, more of the same only going down!  I went through a narrow trail opening and thought I was on the descent and I swear, not 20 yards from where I’d been breaking at the “top” is a massive mountaintop tower!!  It rose another 30 feet above the mountain.  At its base were dipictions and identifications of the surrounding mountains.  So I took a few more pictures and thought of going up the tower but I figured I had enough shots so I went on.
The north side descent of Albert was nothing like the south ascent and I was completely happy with that!  No boulders and some rocks and roots.  
Eventually I was able to cruise onto the Franklin overlook mountain where I called Jim, the shuttle driver that the Microtel Inn had recommended.  I had made reservations for this day and tomorrow’s rest day there in Franklin. So I had a good signal and called Jim.  I told him where I was and that I’d be at Winding Stair Gap in an hour.  
I flew down the two-mile descent looking forward to Franklin, a shower, a beer (or two or three), a nice hot meal and a soft bed.  
When I got to the parking area below Jim was already there.  Jim was and older gentleman, older than me, 70 I’d guess, and he is of Austrian decent.  Or is it descent?  Anyhow, he welcomes me and as I’m putting my gear in the back of his SUV he offers me an apple and a banana.
Well I take the banana and politefully decline the apple (remembering all those Halloween razor blade traumatic warnings as a kid.  Not really, I just don’t like apples I unless they are Granny Smith) and I got in the front seat.  But, before I got in, there was a brown bag on the seat so Inmoved it to the center console.  Jim got in and said, that’s for you!  For me. What is it?  Well it was a Whopper from Hardee’s.  Jim had bought two and apparently when he picks up hikers he gets this food for them knowing they probably haven’t eaten.  Again, I thought of those Halloween razor blades...not really. I tore into the Whopper, after removing the onions and tomatoes, and wolfed it down as we drove into Franklin.
Jim was great and full of useful advice.  About my ankle and general aching feet he told me to get epsom salt and soak them.  He also told me to get plenty of rest and to take advantage of the AYCE Shoney’s next door to the hotel.  Further, he told me to call him I needed to go anywhere and he’d come get me.  He was great!  I told Jim though, I had just walked over the mountains 40 miles in two days I can handle a 1.8 mile walk into town.  I didn’t like taking advantage of his generosity but he was prett insistent.  When we got to the hotel and I asked him how much I owed him, he said he shuttled for tips.  I gave him $40 and he gave me $20 back but I made him take the whole $40.  After all, he gave me a banana and a Whopper!After checking in, I cleaned up and that felt so good!  I then walked across the street to Fatz, had a beer and ordered some wings and fries.  I ended up having a second beer, and a lot of water,!and then around 10:00 went back to the hotel and crashed.  I was dead tired!!!!","Beech Gap

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593333,"so after a great night’s sleep with the HVAC cranked to 78 degrees (after the previous night I was gonna be hot tonight!) I got up and toon my John Lennon book, my notebook and my trail guide notes to Shoneys.  As I enjoyed their buffet, I planned out my zero day, not a rest day by any stretch as you’ll see but a zero nonetheless.  My waitress was great and kept me supplied with coffee, something I had not had on the trail, and orange juice.  As we talked I asked her if she’d ever been on the trail and she had not!  I told her that hey, I was from Virginia Beach and had only recently been to the aquarium so I understood but then proceeded to tell her all the good reasons why she needed to at least go up on the trail. 

My “to do” list was vast and I needed to get started.  In one sense I was a Kerouac beatnik living “off the road” and that was fun but on the other hand, no one like Susan or Bob were around to do anything for me.  Cursed Ginsburg and Ferlinghetti and the whole lot!!
Anyhow I left Shoney’s and went next door to Walgreens and got my epsom salt, an ankle brace (that I sent home as soon as I put it on), some of those scuchie things girls tie their hair back with ( although I think guys with ponytails look stupid, I realized I may have to succumb temporarily) and something else important but now I forget.  
From Walgreens I went back to the hotel and immediately started the epsom foot bath but I accidentally dumped like half the bag of salts into the tub so I figured I guess a whole body epsom bath can’t hurt.  So I cranked up ESPN in the next room and turned up the hot water and filled the tub.  
It was steamy hot and as I got in I was sweating.  I didn’t care one bit.  I easily reminded myself of hypothermia night as I sank into the tub.  
I thought, if any creepy crawlers were on me that I didn’t find, this’ll get ‘em.  I am very fortunate so far that I haven’t found any ticks and the mosquitoes and flies have been pretty much nil to me.  I hear them all around me but for some reason they don’t bother me.  I like to think I walk too fast for them to keep up but I reality they probably just don’t prefer sucking anything out of me.  Good!  We understand each other!!
So I get cleaned up and off to the next daily agenda item, laundry.  So I heard there was one about 1/2 mile away (the hotel didn’t have one) so I asked at the front desk and the girl on duty says yeah but that one closed and merged with one four miles away.  So, I take advantage of the hotel’s computer right there in the lobby and go to Googlemaps and punch in laundry and up pops the one around the corner.  So I call them and a lady answers and I ask if they are open and she says yes, until six, and I say no, that’s not what I mean, but yeah, kinda it is but I heard you were closed?  She said not until six.  I said no, I heard your business was closed and you moved and she said no, I am right here, you called me!  I said yeah, yeah, I know, I’ll be right over.  So, I carry my little satchel of clothes plus my sleeping bag and bag liner over, about a 1/2 mile walnwhich felt great on my feet after that epsom bath!  Very therapeutic!  
So I get over there and the lady who runs the joint and an older guy folding clothes are the only two I theee. I tell her what I need and apologize for the ignorance of the hotel and get my quarters.  I put my stuff in the washer except for my sleeping bag and liner, they just needed puffing, and the older guy asks if I’ve got soap and I did not.  So, he gives me one of his.  Nice guy!  So I ask while my laundry does it’s thing, where’s the nearest ATM and place to get a beer?  So they send me across the parking lot to  bank building and next door to them for a beer.  Well, the money transaction went off without a hitch but when I got to the BBQ place next door, I told the lady at the front desk I was doing laundry next door and just wanted a beer while I wait.  She said well you have to order food with that. So, in typical Timbo fashion I inform her that beer has four of the five food groups in it and this I am eating.  She was not humored but I got a table nonetheless.  When the young waitress came around I told her I simply was not hungry and the whole situation and she seemed in my corner so I ordered a side of mixed vegetables for $2.00 to my beer order.  Take that! Nazi seating lady! 
So before my beer was done I had to go next door and move my stuff to the dryer and get a second dryer to fluff my sleeping bag and the separate silk liner.  So I do all that with this guy’s help (the older guy who is still in there).  So I go back to my beer (I had gulped down the veggies and they were actually really good.  Good call Nazi lady!) l.  So a little while later I check out and go back over next door to the laundry and my stuff is done.  All my clothes were dry ( I had been wearing my conversion shorts and a USA Track and Field (USATF) windbreaker while Indid my laundry)  and fortunately my sleeping bag down fluffed back out and the silk liner was dry and soft,  cool! So I’m talking to the older guy, now known as George, and he asks me about my US Air Force windbreaker and I tell him no, that’s USA Track &Field.  So as we talk I pull off the jacket the lady owner says you can’t get dressed/undressed in here!  I said OK, and calmly put a shirt on.  She gave me a big smirk, thank you very much!!
So George, who is retired Air Force, asks me where I’m going and I tell him my to do stuff and he offers to drive me around!  Says he’s got nothing better to do.
So I take George up on his offer and as I’m heading for the front door with my laindry he’s heading to the back of the laundry mat so I do a double-back and catch up and ask, where you going?  He says, to my SUV, I park out back.  I almost walked out on my ride!  So while George is taking me to the hotel he tells me that he’s been doing his laundry every Tuesday at the laundry mat.  He has a washing machine but the dryer crapped out so he used to bring the wet laundry just to dry.  Then he got wise and figured heck, for an additional $1.00 per load, he could wash it here as well and get it all done at once.
Son George was an Air Force pilot trainer and retired after 20 years.  Among his students were all of the Mercury 7 astronauts and Chuck Yeager as they flew around in George’s T-38s.  I swear, you never know who you’re gonna meet or what their background story is.  Too cool!  So George tells me his wife passed several years ago and it’s just him and his son at home but his brothers live here in Franklin as well.  So I asked if he was from here and he says no, New York.  What???
So what’s that story?  So George’s parents all had three sons.  Two ended up retiring in Franklin and soon thereafter so did George’s parents.  So collectively they convinced George and his wife to retire there as well.  George said  it worked out because when his parents died, they died in their own beds and amongst their children and grandchildren.  Pretty cool.  
So after dropping off my laundry and picking up my stuff to ship home, George proceeds to show me the town.  I said, George, as long as w make it to the PO by 5:00 because I have a care package to pick up and stuff to mail home.  So anyhow, I get the full tour and In the meantime George and I bond and I tell him all about my own military background and yes, for those who have seen me lately, why I am growing my hair back out for the third time to donate for cancer (I was blessed with good genes to grow hair and frankly, in the three-year meantime between growing and cutting, it’s fun to shake it and act all “beachy”.  
So despite my specific “to do” list prioritization, George takes me to the local outfitters store.  We go in and I’ve got several things to get, top of the list being two dry bags, for my sleeping bag and bag liner, but also a small fire starter kit (the cold night in Beech Gap, an arm sleeve for my map and a new headlamp and I was good to go.  So I find all of the above minus the map sleeve and I’m good with that.  So so check out and they give me a free store bandana ( which I lost the very next day Andy i was bummed), but as we’re leaving, George points to a full-size canoe on the wall and says, I made that. I took pictures and hopefully once I figure out how to post properly to this website you’ll see.  It was simply beautiful!!!  George said he makes them from time-to-time.  I was blown away! 
So as we leave the outfitters he’s like, where next? I’m like, George, you’ve done enough!  Stop!  I have. Lot of stuff to do and you have your things to go on to.  He nixed  that and showed me the rest of the town.  We ended up at the Lazy Hiker brewery for a beer, which I didn’t mind, but I kept looking at my watch.  I needed to get to the PO by five.  So finally after a beer I said to George, we gotta leave, I gotta get my stuff and send my other stuff back.  So George took me there straight away and was gonna stay and I had to plead with him to go on, knowing he wa supposed to meet friends for dinner at five.  He was still willing to drive me all over town but I assured him I was OK and that I could make it back to the Microtel all safe and sound.  
So to finish off this fabulous “zero day”. 
So at the PO, everything went smoothly and I got my box, opened it, repacked my stuff (in other words shipped stuff back) and left the PO.  
So I go across he street and down a block to Mulligan’s Bar & Grill for a well-deserved  beer and my lunch/dinner, er lupper.  
So I go in and can’t get a seat at the big boy table so I sit at s small table on the fringe catching up my notes.  
Soon enough I spy a spot at the bar and graduate to the big boy table.  So I’m sitting there minding my own time and two trees come in and belittle me, one on each side.  They were each easily 6’8” and towered over my stretched 5’10”.
Well pretty soon, the jolly green to my left starts talking to me.  I think he overheard me saying something about Helen, Ga and my driver Dave and asked me about Dave.  He says, you mean Dave the cab driver from Helen? I say, yeah, looking up at him with my neck crooked. He says, I went to high school with Dave, tell him Steve says hi.  I said, I will, and I immediately sent a text to Dave.  Small world, huh? 
So pretty soon Steve leaves and no sooner the guy on my right starts talking to me.  Now anyone who knows me really well knows I am pretty much a loner in a bar scenario.  I just mind my own business and that’s it.  BUT, eventually people start talking to me so I talk back
So, pretty soon Jolly Green right starts talking to me.  Turns out he’s of Norwegian descent and his dad was a “military advisor” during the Korean War and Vietnam where he supported Air America and the CIA early on.  Anyhow, he and I had a great discussion.  I told him all about Norway, which I’d been to in 1989 on my way to the North Pole on USS Lapon (SSN-661) and he had never been to and he told me all about his life growing up in America and particularly. Franklin.  

Well pretty soon Ted Kjis leaves, that was his name, and some brunette lady comes in and sits where Ted had been.  So true to form I mind my own business and pretty soon she starts talking to me.  I told her all about the trail, which she’d never been on which amazed me. So we small talked for a while along with Renee the bartender Ann pretty soon Brenda, the lady next to me, said she was leaving soon.  Not one to miss out on and opportunity I told her where I was staying amd asked for a ride and it just so happened, her house was right behind there.  So, my night ended with Brenda dropping me off and I thanked God I didn’t have to walk that 1.8 miles back to the hotel.  
Until tomorrow...","

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593392,"So I woke up at 6:15 again, 15 minutes before my alarm was going to go off, and packed all my stuff.  I ate a Pro Bar and left about 1/2 my food that had been shipped in the hotel for future hikers.  
Jim picked me up at 7:30, drove me to Winding Stair Gap, gave me two bananas and dropped me off.  
Out of Winding Stair the trail takes a 4-1/2 mile slope up the mountain to Silver Bald.  Silver Bald is this huge meadow on the mountain, perfect environment for a bear sighting but no such luck.  
I took a couple pictures and went on into the woods following the trail.  I stopped about 50 yards into the woods to take my 5-mile break when a young couple came by.  We talked a little and they had just spent the night on top of Silver Bald.  They said there was an awesome 360 degree view of the surrounding mountains and that it was worth going up there.  So I doubled back and walked up the scant trail to the top and they were right, it was spectacular!! There were no maps to identify the mountains and distant towns but that didn’t matter.  There was a lone fire ring and a rectangular metal plate identifying the spot as Silver Bald.  So far along the trail, this is one of the best spots.  I made my way back off the Bald while two young ladies were making their way up.  They had hiked 55 miles and this was their last day.  They were heading back home after Wayah Bald at mile 119.  There’s was a planned exit, they weren’t just up and quitting like so many do.  
So by the time I got back to where I met the couple who advised me to go up the Bald, I’d made a mile round trip.  So off down the trail I went.
I passed several other couples and each one I told about Silver Bald.  They in turn told me about Wayah Bald.  Wayah Bald is right along the trail and there’s an observation tower built by the Conservation Corps back in the 1930’s.  Wayah is Cherokee for wolf and hopefully I wouldn’t come across any of those on this hike.  If so, I guess bear spray would work on them as well.  
Anyhow, The north side Of Silver Bald U descended into Wayah Gap and then right back up again for 2-1/2 miles to the top of Wine Spring, but there was no wine.  From there it’s a 1-1/2 mile trek across a dip in the mountain to Wayah Bald.  This wasn’t a big open meadow like Silver Bald but the views from the tower were still great and there were marker maps to identify the surrounding mountains and towns.  I could look what seemed like dozens of miles away across the horizon and see Albert Mountain.  The memory of going up it seemed so long ago.  I could also look across to my right and see Silver Bald.  That was pretty neat since I had just been there.  
From the tower I called Maggie, my shuttle connection, who was picking me up at Burningtown Gap.  Maggie and her husband Steve own and run the Aquone Hostel at Nantahala Mountain Lodge.  I had tried to get a room there but they close June 1 for the season so they are only open for the mass of they-hikers each year from March through May.  They still run a shuttle service year around.
Maggie was from Northumberland, England but has lived in the US for 28 years.  I told her that Susan and I had just been to Scotland and England last year at this time and that I had lived in Scotland near Holy Loch as a toddler.  She said her father had been stationed at Holy Loch as well as a member of the British Navy.  
So in coordinating. Pick-up time to meet at Burningtown Gap, it was 1:38pm and Maggie and I agreed I had 4.7 miles to go so she said she’d meet me at 4:15.  So I set off down the trail, mostly flat and down with a slight up in the middle the. Into Burningtown.  I actually got there way early, at 3:40, and the Gap sits beside the dead end of a gravel road. I was used to coming into such areas and there’d be a parking lot and a main road but not so here.  I wondered if I was in the right spot and if there was the familiar parking lot just around the corner.  So I started up the trail but after only 20 yards of going literally up realized that no, this was it.  There was a wooden marker there identifying it as Burningtown Gap and I was overthinking this.  So I started walking down the gravel road thinking maybe there was a main road further down and I’d come to the parking lot.  Either way, I’d catch Maggie either coming up the road or at a lot nearby.  
I was also out of water so as I walked down the road Inkept an eye and ear out for a spring.  About 1/2 mile down the road I found a small PVC pipe sticking out of the hillside and water was running out so I broke out my filter system and filtered 64 oz of fresh water.  About that time here comes Maggie, right on time.  
It was about a 1/2 hour drive to my cabin at Nantahala and Maggie sped around the winding roads at breakneck speed.  I drive fast but Maggie put me to shame.  I ask her how long she had lived up here and she said 18 years.  They had just suffered massive flooding and a landslide the week before, while I was heading into Helen, and the crews were still working on repairing things in areas.  When we got to the Nantahala Outdoor Center, the NOC, I knew we were close because when I made my reservation Janette had told me the cabins were 3.5 miles from the NOC.  Well we got to the address and it was this run-down place and was pretty much abandoned.  I phoned Janette and she said I was at the old place, not the new one.  So Maggie and I set off again and 1-1/2 miles up the road we got to the cabins.  Maggie dropped me off and said Steve, her husband, would pick me up at 8:30 in the morning. And drop me back off at Burningtown Gap for my bike into the NOC.  The cabin was great, the best part being the hot tub on the back porch.  I got in right away and my feet felt great. I got cleaned up and walked the 1.8 miles down the road to the gas station service center.  No beer.  Oh well, they did have ice cream so I ate a pint.  Then I went back in and bought a frozen pizza, some chips, V-8 juice and, I had a craving for an ice cold coke.  I haven’t drank soda in years but I bought one now!  I didn’t want to walk the 1.8 miles back along the road so I asked. Young guy who had pulled up to get gas which way he was going.  He was going the opposite direction but offered me a ride anyhow.  So I gave him $10 for his trouble and he dropped me at the cabin entrance.  He asked me what I was doing and Intold him about hiking to Damascus and he said he and his friends had occasionally hiked the trail but that they’d only done about 70 miles or so.So I cooked my pizza, ate it all and some chips, drank my coke and watched a little ESPN catching up on the sports news and then crashed for the night.So far in the journey:  11 days, 124 trail miles, 8.8 miles of approach trail miles and 154 miles overall on my Runkeeper.  346 miles to Damascus...","Winding Stair Gap
",Burningtown Gap,"Jun 06, Wed",15.87
TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593473,"I woke up again at 6:15 after setting my alarm the previous night for 6:30. I guess my internal clock is running 15 minutes fast.  
I had arranged for Maggie’s husband Steve Bennett to pick me up at 8:30am.
After I woke up I laid in bed and made several more journal entries.  Then got my stuff together for an easy day.  I’d be coming back to my cabin at the end of the day so I’d be slack packing it again, just hydration, filter and wind breaker in the pack.  To make it better, it was a shorter leg at 12.46 miles over a relatively easy part of the trail, two uphills, a couple of flats and a big downhill into the NOC.
So Steve showed up right on time and we talked as he drove the 1/2 hour to Burningtown Gap.  Steve had through-hiked the trail in 2010.  He is also a retired British Special Forces Commando so we talked a lot about submarines and their support of Special Ops forces.  
For all you Virginia Tech Hokies, when we got to Burningtown, a wild turkey ran across the gravel road in front of us.  
At 9:04am I started my next leg’s journey to the NOC.  The beginning was a 1-1/2 mile uphill from 4250 feet to Cooper Ridge Bald Lookout at 5100 feet.  It wasn’t that bad a climb but as other days, it takes a while for my legs to get into the initial climbs and the lactic acid burns in the quads.  What do you do though but keep going and take shorter steps.  
I heard a couple of woodpeckers essentially pecking away in what sounded like either a courting sequence or a competition.  One would rat-a-tat out a hammering thread and then the other would match it.  This went on for several minutes until I got too far away to hear them for real.  For real, I say, because for the next mile or so Incouldn’t get their hammering out of my own head!
Rocky Bald Lookout is adjacent to Cooper Ridge Lookout but I missed them both!  Next thing I knew I was in a decline and that meant Tellico Gap.  Several people warned me about Tellico because there are areas of the descent that are dangerously steep.  It didn’t seem that bad but I was cautious nonetheless.  
On the uphill climb side of Tellico was a missing person’s poster on a tree beside the trail.  I wondered if the person chose to go missing.  It isn’t like people get lost out here and abducting hikers isn’t a likelihood.  
I shortly thereafter came across a volunteer cleaning a section of the trail. I talked to her about snakes, rattlesnakes in particular.  I told her I’d been really looking the sides of the trail over as I went in hopes of getting a photo of one.  She said that was highly unlikely and that in all her years of volunteering on the trail cleaning and leading expeditions, she’d only seen two snakes, a Garter and a Copperhead, and both of those on the same day.  I told her I’d seen two so far this trip and both were Ringnecks. She said Rattlesnakes are out here but they tend to be off the trail and under rocks and downed trees or limbs.  I’m not going hunting for any but I’m still keeping my eye out for them.
The climb out of Tellico becomes a series of switchbacks that lead up to Wesser Bald observation tower.  The metal tower is thirty feet tall and provides a great view in all directions of the surrounding mountains.  Fontana Lake is clearly visible from the tower.  That’s my destination on Saturday.  About 15 hikers were at the tower when I got there.  Several men ranging in age from early 20’s to probably mid-50’s were hanging out at the base.  Some resting, some eating.  It may be unfair in saying but my gut feeling was not a good one about these guys.   There was also a couple with a toddler hanging out as well.  I went on up the tower and there was a family of 5 up there, the man and woman, two elementary-age children and another toddler.  I couldn’t figure out if the whole group was together or not and if they were all hiking the trail or just visiting the tower.  There were several packs at the base of the tower though but I wasn’t going to pry.  Also, at the Microtel in Franklin a couple days ago, one of the desk clerks was telling me about a family that was hiking the trail and they had several children with them including a toddler and they were heading north.  So, this very well may have been them. 
As I left the tower and got back on the main trail, several other hikers crossed my path.  Two I didn’t speak to as they made their way to the tower and another spoke to me asking if I’d seen his buddy come by.  I told him a guy had passed me before I got to the tower and described him and yes, that was his friend.  They were heading to Maine, so a couple of thru-hikers getting a late start.  This guy took off like his buddy though and was soon out of sight. 
After Wesser the trail didn’t look that bad, a mile and half of flats and then a 4-1/2 mile descent into the NOC.  Easy, only it wasn’t. The short duration ups were a pain!  Some were rocky and steep and others twisted and turned.  I also encountered several spots along the mountainside trail where it was mountain wall on my left, 8” to maybe 18” of trail, and then a sheer drop off on my right.  I looked down several times and it dropped 30 feet or more into a vine-thickened abyss.  I didn’t look too often or too long because I’d begin to lose my balance just glancing over.  I stayed focused on the trail I had, however small, and kept digging in my trekking poles as I went.
I rolled into the NOC around 2:40 in the afternoon, 20 minutes ahead of my planned arrival.  Now where’s the cold beer???So I ended today’s 12.46 miles in 5 hours and 40 minutes and including stops, averaged 27:21 per mile.  Pretty quick for me.  The NOC is at mile 136-1/2 on the trail so including the approach trail’s 8.8 miles, I’ve now completed 145+ miles of the 480 or so total to Damascus.  12 days down, 26 to go to get me there on July 3rd.  So, I need to average 12.9 per day with no breaks and that’s not happening so I know I’ll have a few more zero days and a few more 20+ mile days to compensate.  The next couple day’s agenda is Friday a 13.7 mile from the NOC to Stecoah Gap and then a shuttle into the town of Ribbonsville, NC where I’ll stay at Quality Inn, on Saturday a 15.6 into Fontana where I’ll stay at The Fontana Village Resort & Marina overlooking Fontana Lake and then Sunday is a zero day at Fontana to do laundry, catch up the journal, and complete other “to do” stuff.  But back to that beer...
I went across the bridge that spans the river to the outdoor bar/restaurant and got a table. I sat there for several hours updating my journal, listening to music and having several local IPAs along with a ton of water.  At around 6 I went to the regular restaurant back across the bridge and had a burger for dinner.  After I ate I hung around talking with several of the employees who were asking me about the hike and then I paid one $10 to run me up the road to my cabin.  We did a quick stop at the gas station from the day before where I got another Coke, a Diet Coke, and when I got back to the cabin I put it in the freezer for later.  Then I got in the hot tub and called.  Charlie Doss and talked to him for a while before going in and watching the NCAA Track & Field Championships from Eugene, Oregon on ESPN.  I fell asleep pretty easily...","Burningtown Gap

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593488,"I had set my alarm again for 6:30 but once again awoke at 6:15am.  So I worked on the journal again for an hour and then got up and got prepared to leave.  For $10, one of the ladies who works for the cabins was going to meet me at the cabin entrance and drive me the 3.5 miles to the NOC at 8:40.  My shirt and shorts were not completely dry so I put one on a baking pan and in the oven and the other on the oven door as I got my other stuff sorted.
At 8:20 I walked on down to the cabin entrance and the road below.  I uploaded several photographs to the journal website and waited.  Right on time she showed up and drove me to the NOC.  On the way she talked to me about her children and ten grandchildren.  I just listened and said “wow” or “that’s cool” every 30 seconds.  
So she dropped me off and I got my I-phone and charger situated and put it in my pack.  Then I stood by the store and studied a huge wall map of the NOC looking for where I needed to go.  The trail followed the crosswalk across the street and across the bridge over the river and then over the railroad tracks in the back of the premesis and into the hillside.
So at 8:57 I was once again off.  Today a full pack journey of 13.7 miles to Stecoah Gap.  The start was all uphill with some flats and few downs for 8 miles.  This was going to be a slow day.  Soon after I left, around the mile mark, I got to thinking that I hadn’t made any arrangement for a hotel in Robbinsville, my next town location, or for Fontana, and it was the weekend.  It was on my mind so I stopped and made the calls.  Around that time a group of four guys caught up to me.  One immediately acknowledged my USS Lapon ballcap and asked me about it.  Yes, I am a submarine veteran and had been on Lapon.  He said he’d been on the USS Chicago.  He had been the Communications Officer.  So we talked awhile about boats and then Brian, another in the group, asked me about my Ragnar shirt.  So I told him yes, I’d run several Ragnar ultra-distance relays and he said he’d talk to me more about it when we all got to Swim Bald, their destination five miles ahead.  
So they took off up the trail and I finished with my reservations. Cool, all worked out.  I’d be in the Quality Inn in Robbinsville, 9 miles off the trail, and the clerk would text me the contact info for a shuttle driver.  I went on-line and made my reservations for Saturday and Sunday at the Fontana Lodge.  Now I could rest easy and just hike.
Well the going was already tough, mainly due to the heat and humidity, but also the long uphill, a rise of some 2500 feet to Cheoah Bald.  On the way, a flatter lull between Cheoah and Swim Bald of about two miles.  A mile before Swim Bald I caught back up with John, Brian and their group.  They were taking an extended break before going up the last steep hill to Swim Bald.  So we caught up on Ragnar and submarines and I moved out while they were putting their packs on.  In the meantime, two other hikers passed whom I’d seen the day before.  The one I kept flip-flopping with up the hill until he caught his buddy at Swim Bald and I motored on, more invigorated now I thought by nearing Cheoah.  Once at the top I took several photos, soon to be posted, and called my shuttle driver.  The bugs were horrendous!  I started to cloud over and cool off but I hadn’t really noticed.  Another hiker joined me at the top for the views as I spoke to Fred, the shuttle driver, about meeting me.  I was 5.7 miles from Stecoah and it was 2:30.  I’d be there around 5:00 and call him again once I got within 2-miles.  Fred said he was 15 minutes from the Gap and he’d be there.  No sooner do I get started back up again and I hear thunder and the skies open up.  Well I put my pack cover on but left my poncho off.  I was already wet with sweat so I’d just let the rain rinse my clothes out on the way down the mountain.  Well it poured and it got cold but I just kept going, counting off each 1/2 mile.  I finally got to where I could hear the vehicles on the road below.  Way below.  The last 1-1/2 miles down was nothing but switchbacks so you could go fast if it weren’t for the slippery wet mud and rocks.  I finally got down and Fred was waiting.  It was 5:19 and I’d called him again from 1-1/2 miles up and said I’d be there by 5:15.  I’m four minutes late, Fred, sorry.
I loaded my stuff in Fred’s red Chevy truck.
So to finish this chapter before I start the next, Fred dropped me off at Quality Inn where there were 2 dozen bikes and bikers in the parking lot.  Apparently good motorcycle riding up here.  Fred said several of them end up killing themselves each year.
So I checked in, got cleaned up, went down to the front desk and asked where I could grab a beer.  Sorry, dry county.  What?  OK, where can I get some chocolate ice cream then.  So I walked to Wendy’s and ate and had a Frosty for dessert then stopped by Family Dollar for Epsom Salts and headed back to the hotel.  I soaked in the Epsom salts for 15 minutes then sorted my stuff, caught up the journal and watched more of the NCAA Track and Field Championships then finally dozed off, another day complete. So, 13 days done, 160 approach and trail miles.  On to Fontana Village on Saturday!!","Nantahala Outdoor Center

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593531,"So, I set my alarm last night for 6:00 because I asked Fred to pick me up at7:30.  This morning the clock did all the work as I did not rise before it as I usually do.  I guess I must have been dreaming good but I can’t remember any of them if I was.  
So I popped right up and updated the journal.  All caught up, except for photos.  Gotta get better at posting those as well as taking them.  
So I used the last of my epsom salt from yesterday and soaked for 15 minutes then took a shower.  Felt great!  I packed up all my stuff and got dressed for another day.  I had inverted my Salomons upside down over the HVAC unit and cranked it up to 75 all night to get them to dry out completely.  It worked.  I forgot that I had my shirt and shorts hanging in the closet or I would have done the same to them.  It didn’t matter as the shirt was dry and my shorts were about 90%.  Good enough to throw on.  My socks were still wet so had to go with back-up pair.  No biggie.  Doing laundry at Fontana anyhow.  
So I popped my vitamins, an Aleve and headed out the door.  At the lobby buffet, I ate a quick breakfast of scrambled eggs, a sausage link, an English muffin, a glass of OJ and a cup of coffee.  As I waited in the lobby looking out the window waiting for Fred, I finished up the journal.  I had seen a red truck out there but I thought the color was not a dark enough red for Fred’s so I didn’t pay it any mind.  Well, it got to be 7:33 and it dawned on me, that’s Fred’s truck.  He’d been sitting there for at least 15 minutes!  So I ran out, apologized and we were off.  
Fred is a retired bridge designer.  I asked him if all his bridges are still standing.  He said, I hope so!  He shuttles hikers because he likes to meet them and hear their stories.  He also bear hunts during the short season in the Fall.  I asked him what kind of weapon he preferred.  He said he uses his grandfather’s Winchester 30-30.  He said that gun has probably killed 75 bears over the years.  I told him I had seen two bears so far and he said that’s rare, that some hikers go the whole way and never see a bear.  He said hikers ask him all the time where the bears are and Fred says they’re up there in the woods but that for the most part they don’t want anything to do with hikers or people in general.  I told him I carry bear spray and Fred says you’ll never need it.  I said, well that may be true but I’d rather have it and not need it than the other way around.  Fred said, well you’ve got a point there.  
Oh, before I forget, I saw another snake yesterday and got a really good photo so I’ll try to post it today.  It was just a Garter snake but really nice looking and sat real still on the trail for its photo op.  
So Fred drops me off at the trail junction just before 8:00am and I parked all my gear on a picnic table, called Susan and ate a Pro Bar before setting out.  I knew I had an immediate uphill out of Stecoah and I was kind of dreading it because the last few starts like that had been hell on my quads, all the lactic acid.  Today though Inwas surprised and I powered up and up no problem at all.  I got a really good photo of the mountains through a gap over the road too from about 200 feet up.  
So I’m cruising along up the hill and I hear a car or two pull in the lot below and people getting out and I think, great, I’ve got weekend hikers for company.  Not that that is bad but there’s something to a hike in solitude to collect your thoughts and in this case, looking forward to Fontana Dam.  So I cranked it up a little to out space between me and whomever it was.  About an hour later I can hear all this chatter behind me getting louder and I know whoever it is is going to catch me soon.  
Well it turns out to be Chicago Submarine John and his three friends.  I said (I’m not doing those quote signs anymore.  It’s a pain on an I-phone so a comma will have to suffice so follow along), I thought you guys were staying at Swim Bald last night?  How the heck did you catch me?  They said they were but when it down poured they pressed on and went to Stecoah as well and stayed at a local hostel.  They were heading to Fontana as well so now I had company along the way, for what it’s worth.  I let them take the lead and I laid back behind up and down the hills. I’d catch them during their breaks and we’d do the same thing all over again.  I had no intention of leading.  I was pacing myself and I had pre-set times to stop.  Hike your own hike, they say.  Well, once we hit Hogback Gap at mile 4-1/2, the trail flattened out for the most part for the next 2-1/2 miles and then a deep down and up to Black Gum Gap, a painful one at that. So I took my 10-minute breaks at 5.25 miles and again at 11.6 miles where I took off my pack, ate a Pro Bar (only at 5.25) drank half my electrolyte mixture and water at each and cruised on.  I tend to get stronger as the day goes on.  Don’t really know why but I do and I use it to my advantage.  So I catch up with John and his group while they are eating lunch just before mile 8.5.  We talked just a little and Fontana was their planned end of the line. Craig had his car there and they were all going to John’s mother’s house not far from Fontana.  I told Craig his car was probably on cinder blocks, ha, ha.  Then John apologizes for taking off on today’s hike but says he and Craig are only carrying water, they’ll double back to the hostel for their packs.  Well, that explains why they pulled away from me so easily.  Four people, two packs.  No problem, John.  They made room for me to join them but I said I didn’t want to cool down and I had a scheduled stop at 11-miles so I’d better get going.  As I left I made it a point to power up the next hill out of that Gap and for the next 1-1/2 miles I just pushed as hard as I could.  Call it male ego or my competitive nature...OK, anyone who knows me knows it is massive amounts of both, but there was no way they were going to catch me again, slack packers or not.  
Once I got past Black Gum and my 11-mile break, which I pushed until 11.6 mile mark because I knew from there I only had 4 more miles, I checked my guide again and confirmed that it was all downhill from here.  
Well, despite what the guides look like, it’s never just all down hill from anywhere.  It was for the most part but at this point even the little ups hurt.  I encountered a pair of women who were just starting out from Fontana heading to Springer.  We talked for about 30 seconds and then each went our opposite ways.  
Before long I could hear the auto sounds around Fontana and based on my Runkeeper I knew I was only 2-miles away and it was really all downhill switchbacks.  I was pretty much flying down, for me, doing 22-minute miles and at one point I heard voices up the mountain above me and just knew that was John.  No more stops even for a second!!  I powered on determined to not allow them to catch me.  Truth is, and I knew it, they were so far back up the switchbacks that they were probably a mile back.  
So I finally set foot on asphalt and look over at a Fontana Dam building and parking lot of vehicles as well as a glimpse of the lake and I think, I have arrived!  Not!  I see a sign on the other side of the parking lot plus I know I haven’t gone enough miles.  So I walk over to the sign where the trail picks back up and it says 1.4 miles to the   Visitor’s Center. So I crank it up the trail again thinking about John behind me.  So I’m cruising through the woods and counting down the last 1-1/2 miles and I can see the lake and I’m keeping an eye out for this famous dam I’ve heard of.  Largest east of the Rockies, how can you miss that, right?  And the AT goes right over it.  So I’m hiking, hiking and hiking, and still passing white blazes sonInknow I’m not lost and no dam.  Where the hell’s the damn dam???  So I’m Loking at my Runkeeper and 15.6 miles comes and goes (my preDetermined mileage) and I’m still not there.  Finally Income our odnthe woods onto a hardtop road and I see a white blaze leading up the road. So I follow it of course and then I get to a concrete walkway beside a road and Insee one whites blaze on a low wall and then nothing.  So I keep walking along this road and walk.  Finally, Income to a spillway and I say to myself, self, that’s a pretty small dam.  I know it isn’t the dam but I’m tired and I gotta humor myself.  So I take a left around the next corner and there it is, Fontana Dam and the Visitor’s Center.  The dam still doesn’t look that high, I think, but I realize I’m looking at the dammed side, not the other side.  Anyhow, I go in the visitor’s center and ask where the lodge is.  The lady there tells me it’s two miles that way.  I ask if there’s a shuttle.  She says there is and it costs $3.00.  I asked her to call them because I sure wasn’t going to walk it.  The concrete beat my feet to hell.  The trail was fine, the concrete is another thing.  So I bought. Diet Coke and a water and downed them while I waited.After about ten minutes the shuttle van showed up and it dropped me at the doorstep of the lodge.  A really nice place.  Look up Fontana  Village Resort Marina.  So I checked in and went straight to my room to get cleaned up.  No epsom salt yet but I’ll get some tomorrow.So I do md my way to the AWOL’s wood Bar & Grill, I had a large IPA and water, in separate glasses, of course and talked to the staff.  Then a couple of guys came in asking about the Belmont Stakes.  Heck, I thought all that was over.  So we all watched Justify win the Triple Crown and then I ordered a ribeye, ate, and now I’m on the grill patio listening to live music, updating this blog and drinking my third IPA.  Four of the five food groups in beer...So, agenda going forward.  I’m currently at AT mile 165-1/2 with Damascus at marker 470.  I am on the doorstep if he Great Smokey Mountains and will enter them within 1/2 hour of my next leg.  Tomorrow, Sunday, is a planned zero day to do laundry and other odds & ends and just rest up.  Monday is a big mileage day at 30 to get to Siler Bald.  That’s a goal, nothing more, so if I fall short, it just means more miles into Tiesday’s 12-mile hike to the crossroads that take me into Gatlinburg, TN.  So I gotta camp out for the third time at Siler, no big deal.  For now, a couple more IPAs, listen to the music and look forward to relaxing tomorrow...","Stecoah Gap
",Fontana Dam,"Jun 09, Sat",15.87
TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593594,"So today is my zero day at Fontana Village Resort & Marina.  I slept late and that felt good and I got up finally at 8:55 to the roar of motorcycles as the revved up to hit the mountain roads around here.  
So I worked on my “to do” list. Laundry for sure, which I am doing now and just waiting for my stuff to dry, drinking a Bud Light by the side of the pool.  I also did some shopping in the general store here, got my Epsom salts, a post card, a few stickers for my mainland refrigerator and some pins for my pack.  I did not have camp shoes yet, I’d originally brought my Vibram five fingers because they are so light but I’d brought the bright orange pair, safety orange, I don’t know why Indidn’t bring the black pair.  I was not going to walk around town in my town clothes with bright orange vibrams, I’d look like a clown, so I had sent them home in Franklin.  So, any time I wanted to get cleaned up and walk around town I had to wear my hiking Salomons.  That was fine, they’re comfortable, but when they got rain-soaked on the trail, I’d have to get cleaned up and put on wet Salomons.  So at the pool snack shack, what do I see but water shoes, in black!  So I bought a pair.  Minor problem solved at minimal weight!
So I recharged my charger, my phone and my Garmin watch as well this morning.  I also did my first aid to self, minor again, for two blisters, one on the inside of my right third toe that was formed from rubbing against one on the left inside of my fourth toe.  So I put on some neosporin and individual band-aids and then taped the toes together with what else?  Duct tape.  I also took photos of my trekking poles to send to Liki, the manufacturer, because I lost the tip on one in the trail mud.  That’s not supposed to happen.  So not sure when hey can get me a replacement, maybe in Gatlinburg or Hot Springs.  I still use the pole I just have to extend the length to compensate for the missing tip.  The pole shaft itself becomes the ground contact point.  
So after laundry, I plan on having lunch, updating the journal and adding more photos, calling Susan (if I can get decent reception), cleaning out my e-mail, detailing my next leg of the hike (the 30-miles to Siler Bald that may get shortened if needed), cleaning my water filter, finishing my John Lennon book and leaving it for the next person (lighten the hiking load by a few ounces), working on the Sunday LA Times crossword from two weeks ago, and last but certainly not least, ice cream.  Oh yeah, and I’ve got to arrange for shuttle service back to the Visitor’s Center for 6:00am so I can get on the trail at 6:30am.To update this from Gatlinburg, TN on Wednesday, June 13:I finished my laundry and stopped off at the bar & Grill for lunch and to work on the journal and finish my Lennon book. While I was there I met a Brit who had quit his job and was hiking the trail.  He was using the trail to decide what he wanted to do with his life.  Interesting character.  His philosophy on ticks and Lyme Disease was one of odds.  If x number of people have hiked the trail and only a small fraction of them have contracted Lyme Disease, then the odds are in his favor that he would not contract it since the percentage is so small.  He therefore did not see the need to take any preventive measures. Flawed philosophy if you ask me. So I stayed at the grill on the patio for a while and later got into a friendly debate over people taking infants and toddlers with them on AT section or thru-hikes.  I argued against citing the inability for the infant or toddler to explicitly express concerns such as dehydration, heat exhaustion, etc.  also, that the hazardous critters such as bears, snakes, ticks and mosquitoes, chiggers, etc. would be much worse on them than an adult.  Plus, the infant or toddler has no choice in the matter.  I saw both an infant and toddler at one of the towers with a larger group and I had heard of a family traveling north while I was in Franklin.  Not sure if the two were the same but speculated they were.  Anyhow, went back to the main lodge to pack up everything then came back to the bat & Grill for dinner.  Had pasta and egg rolls.  Was getting antsy about tomorrow’s 30-miler as well.  Could I really do it? At dinner, saw a table of 8 hikers across from me and recognized two of them.  They had been ahead of me two days earlier and They had just gotten into Fontana that day.  I guess i passed them at some point on the trail and since I overheard they were taking the next day as a zero, I’d probably never see them again. So I finished dinner and meant to ask about dessert but I forgot.  I did contact a shuttle driver, Dillon, and arranged for him to pick me up at the lodge entrance at 6:00am and drive me to Fontana Dam where I’d gotten off the trail.  This would save me a lot of time in the morning since otherwise it was a 3.1 mile walk.So after that I went back to my room to watch a little TV, look over my route for tomorrow and get to sleep by 10:00pm.  I had set my alarm for 5:15.  The last thing I did was use the last of my Epsom salt for a hot bath, quickly becoming a ritualistic trend for me at the hotels and it felt great.","Amicalola Falls Visitor Center
",Fontana Resort,"Jun 10, Sun",0
TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594086,"well, I did it again.  I got today’s journal entry almost done and forgot to “add” periodically so it wouldn’t time out and I lost the entire “thrilling” entry.  So, here’s the abbreviated version...
So I once again beat my alarm clock which was set for 5:15am and I got up at 5:00am.  I was really nervous about today’s 30-mile hike.  Could I really do it heading into the Great Smokey Mountains?  Could I do 30-miles, period?  I’d never gone 30-miles before at one time except in a car or on a bicycle.  Well, I tried to quell my anxieties and I told myself once I began, the worst would be over.
So I used the last of my Epsom salt ( I know I said I used the last of it last night but no, I used half last night and the other half this morning.  I hope you can’t OD on magnesium sulfate because if you can, I’m in a world of hurt.  I’m not carrying the stuff on the trail so despite the size bag I buy, and I always try to buy the smallest, I use it all in 2-3 baths. 
So after My bath I got my stuff together, ate a Pro Bar for breakfast, had a couple cups of coffee, the last as I walked out the door to meet Dillon out front.  Well I get out front at 5:55am and wait.  At 6:00am I’m still waiting.  At 6:05am I call Dillon but his phone immediately goes into the automated message meaning his phone is off.  Great!  So I go back inside and tell the lobby clerk that my shuttle ride is late and that if he shows up, tell him I started walking to the Dam.  So I start walking.  3.1 miles and 58 minutes later I get to the Dam.  So now my 30-mile day has turned into a 33-mile day and I’m over 1/2 hour behind schedule.  Th schedule was important because as it was, if I averaged 30 minutes per mile, I’d still be hiking the last 1/2 mile or so in the dark well past sunset.  No big deal for only 1/2 mile or so.  Now that I was 1/2 hour behind my original start time plus had to go 3-miles further, things just got tougher.  Well, nothing to do but to go for it.  
To top that off, entering the Smokies I had an 8-mile long 2700 foot climb to start the day.  Again nothing to do but put one foot in front of the other.  I used my angst at Dillon as fuel but kept reminding myself to let it go.  That was all behind me now and I had to focus on the task at hand.  
My trusty traveling companion, I’ll call her Brigette from now on in honor of the beautiful French actress, Brigette Bardot (not to be confused with the tasty French bread, baguette) was all I had and we had a plan.  Brigette, you tell me every 1/2 mile how far we’ve gone and what my pace is and I’ll keep your batteries charged.  Brigette is the voice that speaks to me from my Runkeeper app and she recites the same encouraging verses over and over as I’ve said before.  But, as routine as her sayings go, I look forward to them for it means another 1/2 mile down.  It’s when I’m at a particularly difficult stage that she’ll chime in with her chipper voice and attitude that grates me but only for a split second.  Then I’m actually glad to hear her voice that adds that needed bit of levity to my situation. 
So after taking the necessary photos of the Dam and the “smoke” in and around the mountains that make them famous we were off!  As I entered the Smokies, I had to do stop and conduct the required business of dropping my Great Smokey Mountain registration sheet in the box at the entrance.  Half the sheet actually, for the other half I guess was my proof of who I am and I supposed there’d be a drop box at rhe other end.  
Well, the uphill climb was an ordeal but not nearly as difficult as I’d expected,  I had paused at 5-miles for a quick 1-minute rehydration break and I was still averaging around 27:30 per mile!  I didn’t realize at the time that that was skewed in my favor because I had averaged about 18:30 per mile on the asphalt over the 3.1 miles I had to walk because Dillon didn’t show up.  
Still, I calculated that I had made up some ground.  Not sure how much but there was no time to try and figure it out.  I’d do it in my head along the way, pass the time.  
I passed an elderly lady ( I hate to use that term but, older than me so, elderly) into the climb.  She had been up at the Shuckstack Fire Tower at mile 4.5 and was coming back down from her morning round trip.  We talked for a few seconds and then we both went on.  I kept wondering how often this lady made the 9-mile round trip?  I kept up my pace and felt good and within a few hours Infinally came to Doe Knob.  Not much to look at but the top nonetheless!  Now I could concentrate on a series of ups and downs in my effort to get to Siler.  Around 10 miles I had my second break of the day scheduled. A longer one where I’d take off my pack and stretch out, drink some and maybe eat something then head on.  But around 10 miles I heard heavy thunder in the air and the trail had darkened, I knew I was still behind schedule so I pressed on.  
At 10.9 miles it got really dark, the thunder was on top of me and it started to sprinkle.  I stopped then and took my break, using the opportunity to put on my pack cover and poncho as well.  No sooner do I get that done and back on the hike and the skies let loose with a torrential downpour.  What to do but hike on!  
One of the biggest negatives of hiking in the wilderness when it’s raining is that the rain drowns out all other sounds so it is difficult to hear, for instance, the loud telltale sound of a large mammal bearing (no pun intended) down on you.  Equally, the thought that they cannot hear you approaching.  So, besides being very focused on where I stepped, I had to look ahead and around every so often to make sure there were no surprises awaiting me.  
On the other hand, and I prefer to look at the other hand or the positives in this case on this adventure, the air is cooler, the adrenaline is fueling you forward and the rain cools you off.  
So a little after I get started on up the trail, a very colorful hiker comes from the opposite direction.  So we pause briefly to talk.  He has this umbrella hat on and rainbow colored gaiters over his shoes.  He says, it won’t last long, it hasn’t all week, speaking of the rain of course.  I’m thinking, who are you, God, to tell me how long this downpour will last, you with your funny umbrella hat that isn’t doing squat for keeping the rain off you and your rainbow-colored gaiters that equally aren’t keeping the rain out!  So we part ways and two hours later the rain stops.  So much for rainbowman’s forecast of it not lasting long.  On top of that, my Salomon’s may be made with Gortex but once the rain gets inside, it doesn’t much matter.  So, I marched on to my intended destination 20 + miles away with imaginary visions of me being G.I. Joe trudging through the Mekong Delta.  
So my next scheduled stop was thereabouts 15-miles so I stopped near Delil’s Tater Patch (not for long!), the top of a hill, took my hydration break for a minute or so and moved on.  Halfway there and if Brigette and I recall, it was only 1:30pm.  18 or so miles to go and 8 hours of daylight!  No time to dilly-dally! I had to hurry so if Inmet people it had to be brief and if I had a great vista I had to enjoy it quickly, take pictures and move on.  I was still averaging under 30 minutes per mile and if I kept this pace up I knew I’d be at Siler by 10:30 or so, only 1-1/2 hours or so in the dark!  Not bad.  
On I went with a vengeance, my next four miles were 28, 26, 23 and 25 minutes and I was feeling great!!  Then came Rocky Top.  A one-mile flat plateau, but the approach and even the downside are arduous.  Besides that, I was starting to get fatigued.  I knew it would set it sooner or later.  Part of the problem of this stretch of the AT in the Smokies is the scarcity of water.  In Georgia, it was everywhere, spilling from mountainside rocks and underfoot.  Maybe it had been all the rain the last two weeks and the fact that it has slackened off recently but whatever, the Smokies had little water except at the shelters every 3-6 miles along the AT and even then you’d have to go down a side trail 100-400 yards to the source.  So, I was using my water sparingly.  
I recal passing an older greyhaired fellow at one point, he was heading in the opposite direction, and he asks, I hope you can reassure me of something, so I ask what?  He asks, am I heading north or south because I got confused on the trail a while back and now I’m not sure.  I’m hoping I’m going south.  I said, you are definitely going south because I am going north.  He said, are you sure?  I said I am positive, but, at worst I am 50% sure that I am heading north and you south.  He looked at me with his face all scrunched up studying me when I said, well, gotta go!  
Coming off Rocky Top I was feeling drained and I still had 10+ miles to go.  I also had some serious decisions to make. In the Smokies, you’re not allowed to camp in the wild.  You must stay at the shelters.  Much of this is for your own protection because of the activity of the black bears.  I had a choice to make soon:  push on fatigued for Siler, part of the way in the dark by headlamp (I picked one up previously) or stop short at Derrick Knob Shelter 5 miles shy.  If I stopped at Derrick it meant an 18-mile day tomorrow instead of a short 12, if I pushed on I had a lot of miles in the dark, fatigued, one major uphill and limited water.  I opted to bow out and stop at Derrick.  As Clint Eastwood would say, a man has to know his limitations and mine this day would not be 30-miles.  
Those last few miles into Derrick were torture.  Aside from that, each break in a climb I’d think I’d see something that looks like a cabin/shelter only to fooled by the sunlight playing amongst the trees.  That alone would demoralize me. Finally, I trudged into Derrick in time to see a hiker girl, her back to me, removing her top into a clean top.  She had no idea I was there.  I respected her assumed privacy and made a little more noise as I trudged past totally ignoring her into the shelter opening.  
The shelter was already jam packed, maybe 25 people crammed in sleeping bags all lined up like sardines in a cab.  A few other people were still milling about, fixing their dinner, tinkering, amongst the hanging packs on mouseproof hanging cords with pie plates the mice can’t figure out how to navigate around (yet). 
As they welcome me, someone in a bag tells, how many miles today?  I look at Brigette and she says, 26.77.  They all go whoa!! 26.7!  The guy then says the water’s down that trail, there and back and you might hit 27.  I said, yes, water I need but Brigette and I are done for the day and I silenced her at 26.77.  Again, a man has to know his limitations.  While Inwas disappointed with not getting my 30 and missing my first major goal, I’m pleased with myself in that I wasn’t an idiot and pressed on just for the sake of hitting a goal.  
It took me a long while to get my things together, I set up my hammock beside the shelter by a tent, ate a pouch of tuna, hung my bear bag, did a bandana bath, changed clothes and all the while talked to the ones still up.  
One couple were just going to Clingman’s Dome, the high point on the AT.  Another were doing the Great Smokies from Fontana to Davenport Gap, a distance of 72.4 miles.  They were a young running couple from Arkansas so we talked about running and they’d seen my Ragnar shirt so we asking me about that.My feet were killing me and it was getting chilly.! With everyone else turned in for the night I set up my sleeping bag and liner inside and positioned my pack with the poncho as a raincover over it and my Salomons, both suspended from one end of my hammock Atlas strap by a carabiner.  I climbed in the hammock but once again had a hard time getting a good night’s sleep.  This time it was my sore and trench-footed feet and terrible rashes I’d developed under and around each arm and the pits.  Gross, I know, but the truth.  I tried to figure out why my armpit and shoulder areas were so torn up and I realized so were my hips, but not as bad and then it dawned on me that I’d lost so much weight already that my pack needed some serious readjustments to fit me properly.  My feet never felt good all night so needless to say I didn’t get a sound sleep.  I couldn’t wait for sunup.  In the meantime, I heard several owls that kept me up along with the random nightly noises that arouse one’s imagination while in a slight stupor of sleep.  At some point I did drift off, and soon enough it was morning.","Fontana Resort
",Siler Bald,"Jun 11, Mon",26.77
TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594134,"Before I go on, I forgot to mention that in Fontana, I finished the John Lennon book and left it for the next thru-hiker.  I have another copy at home.  I also started and finished The Pill Vs. The Springhill Mine Disaster, a collection of short poems written by Richard Brautigan.  Richard was a strange bird, ala Timothy Leary, Ken Kesey, Jack Kerouac.  He was very good friends with Jimmy Buffet and committed suicide several decades back. BUT, his writing is excellent.  One of his best is a short novel titled, In Watermelon Sugar.  I read The Pill book in about an hour and left it for another hiker.  Anything to reduce pack weight.  Again, I have copy in a larger volume of Brautigan’s work.  So, I started on my third book, one I’ve had for years but have never started, The Epic of Gilgamesh.  I’m still on the intro now.  
Anyhow, on to the hike.
So I woke up at 6:40, not so much woke up as got up.  The couple who were in a tent next to me were already packed up and just finishing their breakfast.  They headed out about 15 minutes after I got up headed to the end of their journey, Clingman’s Dome, about 10-miles away.  
So I got as cleaned up as I could, which means running a comb through my tangled hair and brushing my teeth.  Then I slowly packed up my gear, ate a pouch of tuna, and drank up some water and electrolyte mix.  
Slowly the pairs departed north along the trail.  The only ones left were me and the guy who the night before told me to hike on for my 27-miles.  Turns out they were a small band of thru-hikers who were going to flip-flop.  That means that they would hike north from Springer Mountain at the southern terminus in Georgia to a designated point, in their case Harper’s Ferry, WV, and then travel north to Mount Kathadin, the norther terminus in Maine and hike south to Harper’s Ferry.  It’s all good.  A thru-hike in either direction, a flip-flop or a section thru-hike like I’m doing over several years are all recognized the same by the AT Association, they’ve all hiked the whole 2100 miles of the AT.  The reason for flip-flopping is that if you are too slow just hiking north, you run the risk of getting to the White Mountains and the 100 mile wilderness in Maine as well as Mt Kathadin itself at the beginning of the harsh late fall “winter” storms.  Also, the rangers close down Kathadin at some point in October and you can’t get up there to finish.  So, hikers will flip-flop.  So, it was pretty cool to be catching thru-hikers.
So I left on today’s 18-mile journey to Newfound Gap at 8:02am. Right out of Derrick I had several miles of up/down punctuated by Cold Spring Knob, a 250 foot bump on the trail a little over 2-miles in.  By then I’d already caught 2 couples who left before me, one already on their second breakfast of the day.  The next three miles were more up/down  until I got to Siler Bald Shelter, my original destination from the previous day and 5-1/2 miles from Derrick.  There Inran into the couple who had left first from Derrick and who were going to Clingman’s Dome and an aunt and her niece who were headed to Davenport Gap, the northern terminus of the AT in the Smokies.  They were from New Hampshire but now lived in Knoxville, TN.  We left together and talked for about 1/4 mile while the other couple were still resting at Siler.  Soon I distanced myself from the aunt/niece, said my goodbyes and moved on.  
Clingman’s Dome is 4.7 miles north of Siler’s Bald and no east task.  It only elevates 1200 feet but it is one rugged stretch.  I had a lot of stopping to catch my breath.  
Clingman’s is a famous AT landmark and milestone for all AT hikers.  For me, it was my Rubicon.  Although not quite the literal halfway point to Damascus, it was the metaphorical halfway point to me.  
When I finally got to Clingman’s, it was a little cloudy so visibility was limited.  There were a lot of tourists there and I was a little self-conscious because I could smell me and it wasn’t a good smell.  I was a thru-hiker though and looked the part so no one gave me a dirty look or said anything.  I even got someone to take my picture up there.  I also talked to a 2008 thru-hiker.  He was there with his wife and a cooler full of goodies to hand out to other thru-hikers.  I limited my choice to one small snickers bar.
So from Clingman’s, I called into Gatlinburg and made my reservations for the Courtyard Marriott.  I asked Thomas the clerk to text me shuttle/cab info which he did right away.  Being 8-miles out, it was still too early to call for a cab but at least I had the numbers.  Before setting off again I’d overheard several tourists and a ranger talking anout the bear near the southern entrance to Clinger’s.  Rangers there were trying to coax it back into the woods.  As I left Clinger and got back on the trail, I kept that bear in mind.  The Smokies were having an unusually high number of black bear sightings and encounters and all the shelters posted signs warning campers and hikers of them.
So back on the trail I went, determined to get to Newfound Gap by 6:00.  It was 2:17 now so I was going to have to hurry but with Clingman’s being the highest point on the AT, it was a downhill 8 except for a rough 500 foot climb up Sugarland Mountain 2-1/2 miles past Clingman’s.  
Well things were going well. I passed and spoke to several groups going south but all day or multi-day hikers.  Then it got dark around 4:00pm and I heard thunder. Soon thereafter the skies opened once again and I had to do my poncho and pack cover.  It was coming down really hard, like yesterday morning, and I still had 3-miles to go.  It rained the whole way.  I passed one poor girl going south who was just miserable.  She had a Virginia Is for Lovers ballcap on but I wasn’t about to stop and talk to her about it.  The rain was so bad and she was all alone and for a while after I left her I thought about her well-being.  But, I did not turn back.  So, the title of of this chapter, Slippery When Wet.  What is?  Everything in the woods!  Leaves, ferns, rocks, logs, mud.  I slipped on moss but I landed where my right hand caught me so it wasn’t that bad.
With a mile to go, and not to be gross, but  I passed this huge pile of bear poop right on the trail, and it was clearly fresh.  I dodn’t need to touch it or sniff it to find out.  I thought of the bear at Clingman’s.  This couldn’t have been more than 15 minutes old.  I was on high alert now and the added adrenaline rush spurred me on.  I finally got to the last 3/4 mile and decided to call the cab company.  Great, no signal.  So I went on and figured at worst I’d have to thumb in the rain the 15 miles into Gatlinburg.  When I got to Newfound Gap, there was a nice parking lot  and a CCC monument Roosevelt had dedicated back in the 1930’s.  Better still I had a signal and called the cab company.  They said theye’d send a guy right up and it should be about 1/2 hour so I hung out in the rain, couldn’t get any wetter, and called Susan.  I later got a couple to take my picture by the NC/TN boundary sign.  
Finally around 7:30 the cab showed up (I’d gotten to Newfound Gap at 6:56) and it felt good to be out of the rain and headed to a hotel.  
So the day’s hike was 18.15 miles and added to the previous out of Fontana, I’d hiked 44.92 miles in two days.  I looked forward to a zero day tomorrow.  
Once I got to the hotel things went smoothly.  Thomas was there to greet me and I got upgraded to a premium suite, complete with a big jacuzzi tub which I used right away.
After getting cleaned up I went down to the hotel restaurant and had a chicken pot pie for dinner and two Bud Lights.  By the time I finished that it was 10:00pm and I was tired so I took my two big chocolate chip cookies with me to my room.  I only ate one.  I fell asleep watching Forensic Files and so ended my 17th day on the AT.  207 miles down, 263 to go...","Derrick Knob Shelter
","Newfound Gap, TN","Jun 12, Tue",18.15
TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594220,"so started my zero day in Gatlinburg around 8:00am if I recall. I should know, it was only yesterday.  
So I made coffee and got all my laundry together and started that.  While the laundry was going, I worked on my “to do” list for the day.  I won’t go into it here but it numbered 21 and I got 19 done! Some were simple reminders like charge devices, others were more involved, like update journal.  
So I got cleaned up and by that time the dryer was done.
So after my laundry was dried and folded, I packed it away and got ready to go onto Main Street and get more stuff done.  
First stop, Walgreens for epsom salt.  Did that and toted it back to the hotel.  Then out again for lunch.  So I settled on a pizza joint in town and had a large all-the-fixin’s Pizza and only ate three slices.  I saved the rest for breakfast.  Then a I went to the Nantahala Outdoor Center in town and browsed around.  All I bought were some AT stickers for my mainland fridge and some AT pins for the back of my pack.  So I went to the hotel again to drop the pizza and NOC stuff off.  So then back out to the nearest bat & Grill to have a few beers and update the journal.  So I spent an hour or so updating it and forgot I have to add what I have every 15 minutes or so or the website will make me log back in and I’ll lose my work.  So that happened again!  So, I had to start over.  Finally got that day done and went back to the hotel.  I made dinner reservations at The Peddler, the best steakhouse in town and after dropping off some mail at the front desk went there for my 8:30 reservation.Great place!!  I had AYCE salad bar, filet mignon and trout, baked potato and for dessert, a huge chocolate and peanut butter pie in an Oreo shell with whipped cream and dripped fudge on top.  No problem finishing all that.  Fuel for tomorrow.So time flies and back to the hotel.  I got my stuff all ready for tomorrow’s hike, called the cab company for a 6:30 pick-up, watched the end of the Yankees game while in an epsom jacuzzi and then crashed reading The Epic of Gilgamesh.  Interesting book.  More tomorrow...","Gatlinburg
",Gatlinburg,"Jun 13, Wed",0
TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594343,"so I’d arranged for the same cab service that dropped me off to pick me up from the Courtyard Marriott in Gatlinburg at 6:30am.
So I get up at 5:00am.  I use the rest of my Epsom salts and soak for about 10 minutes then I took a shower.  Don’t know if that’s the correct way to do things or not but I don’t care really, seems to work for me, at least psychologically, and my body’s not complaining.  
So after that pleasantry I repacked my pack and re-positioned my pack straps so it fit better on my thinning frame.  
I fixed a couple cups of coffee and drank them while doing all this and I was pretty much done and out the door my 6:25am. So I’m waiting out front for the cab and I called Susan to let her know my plan for the next two days.  In the meantime, I kept looking at my watch and 6:30 came and went.  I was thinking, not Fontana again!!!  At 6:33am the cab did arrive though so all was well.  I could make up 3 minutes on the trail.  
It took a while getting the 15 miles to the trail junction but the driver and I just talked while she drove and I played with her little toy-whatever dog.  Finally we got there and she dropped me off.  It was still pretty cool, overcast and foggy.  Not a good start to the day for any good vistas but at least it wasn’t raining and the cool air was no problem as I knew I’d be warming up soon enough.
There were actually a lot of people on the trail, more than I could recall at 7:00am at any other trail junction.  Right away I had to figet with stuff and several couples went by me.  I soon got squared away and was off.  First destination, Charlie’s Bunion about 4-miles away, a fantastic overlook with a shear cliff drop edge.  As I warmed up I pretty much passed everyone who had passed me at the start and then some.  I also passed a fresh pile of bear you-know-what right on the trail.  So the old phrase off, does a bear shit in the woods?  The real answer is no he does not, he does it on the trail! So as I’m hiking I’m extra aware but I never hear or see a bear or any other notable critters for that matter.  I’m getting concerned though because I can see through the trees that the fog is not burning off.  If this doesn’t lift soon I’ll have no view from Charlie’s Bunion.  So I am nearing the junction of the AT and  side trail that cuts off to another popular scenic vista, Mt LeConte, and I catch up with four women.  So we start talking and they are teachers in the area and first they mention the bear pile on the trail.  Yeah, I saw it.  How can you miss it?  Well, they said they were a little behind a couple who came upon the bear on the trail and the guy clacked his trekking poles and the bear took off up a hill and then paused about 30 yards away.  The women said they came by and it was just hanging out up there looking back down on the trail.  I never saw it when Incame through but then Inwasn’t really looking up the hillsides.  So these four women  were going on up to LeConte for the day but they tell me how spectacular Charlie’s Bunion is.  Like a Bunion is a pretty thing to look at, but no, I know it is a rock formation.  So I’m only 1/2 mile or so from there and still fog.  So I get to the sign for Charlie’s Bunion and go up the side trail to the first overlook, about 10 yards off the AT, and nothing but fog!  Crap!  Oh well, what can you do?  So I took a photo of the sign at least and moved on.  Next stop?  My destintion of Cosby Knob Shelter, another 19.4 miles away.  
Why so far?  Because as I’ve explained before, I’m into this more for the hiking than the camping so the least number of nights I spend in the woods the better.  I’ll take  Courtyard Marriott over a hammock and two trees any day.  So my next destintion with any civilization to it was Standing Bear Hostel, some 34 miles from Newfound Gap.  Well inwasn’t going to be doing all that in one day so I had to split it up.  Because you can’t camp in the wild in the Smokey Mountains and have to stay at a shelter, it limits your choices.  So, I either do 23.4 miles to Cosby the first day and 9+ miles onto Standing Bear the next or I do 15.7 miles to Tei Corner Knob Shelter and then do the longer second day of 18+ into Standing Bear.  Well, I’d rather do the longer one while I’m fresh so that’s how I decided.  
Only, it didn’t work out that way.  Nine miles in I ran into Sid and his daughter Clair.  They were two of the ones I stayed at Derrick Knob Shelter with two night’s previous.  When Intold Sid I was going to Cosby he told me he thought it was closed due to heavy bear activity and that I should check with park service.  So I had good I-phone reception so I looked it up on their website and Sid was right, closed.  Darn!  That meant I had to stay at Tri Corner.  No choice.  The good news was a short day.  I’d get there by 3:00pm.  What then?  I hadn’t had that much time to kill before.  The bad news of course was the longer Friday hike.  Oh well, make the most of it.  So then Sid tells me that two other couples from Derrick are also headed to Tri Corner, as are he and Clair.  Great! At least I’ll know people.  The others were Meg and Tony from Tulsa (Inthink Insaid Arkansas before but it’s Tulsa.  Oklahoma, Arkansas, what’s the difference?).  And the other couple were actually an aunt and her niece, Cindy and Lesley, from Knoxville.  
Well, like I said, nothing to do but to get there and make the most of it.  So several miles later I Tony and Meg and we hike and talk for about 5 minutes but we hit a series of uphill switchbacks and I tell them to go ahead, I’m gonna take it easy and stop for a drink.  So two minutes later I’m back at it and within 5 minutes I catch them again!  So Meg tells me to go on so I go by them and head on up the trail.  That was actually a fairly tough series of switchbacks but I was feeling really good and was able to pretty  much power right up and over.  
Then I started seeing piles of other animal excrement on the trail, these recognizable as that from horse.  Well i’d seen the horseshoe prints earlier and on previous day so no surprise.  The surprise the the amount of it along the way to Tri Corner.  I’m talking for 4 or 5 miles!  It got to the point where I was no longer concerned about bears or snakes, I was trying not to step in random piles of this stuff!
Finally I’ about a mile from Tri Corner and I come face-to-face with a ranger on a horse, followed by six mules and another ranger on a horse.  I said, man, I was beginning to get concerned about your horse.  He said, what do you mean?  I said any horse that has to crap that much, there can’t be much left of him.  He laughed and said no, two horses, six mules.  He said they had just come from restocking the privy at Tri Corner with fresh mulch.bbi said thanks for thinking of me!  He said there’s two women headed there just ahead of you.  I said, yeah, I know who they are.  By the way, how come the mules and horses can crap on the trail and you don’t have to clean it up but if I do that in the woods I gotta bury it six inches deep?  He just shrugged and smiled and they got on their way and so did I.
So as I got closer to Tri Corner I thought, Is this gonna be a repeat of Derrick Knob and I’m gonna walk in on the women changing?  Well too bad for them if it is!  So I get there and the way the trail goes, I’m approaching from the back and left side of the shelter.  So as I round the corner to the opening of the three-sided structure (all the shelters are three-sided with an open front and all have a roof, some have a stone fireplace, as this one did), there’s Leslie and Cindy and they go, it’s a good thing we hadn’t decided to clean up and change yet!!  What can you say?  I said you are correct because I wasn’t going to knock.  They said they’d been wondering if I was going to be there that night because they had all (all 3 couples) been at Icewater Spring Shelter the night before but they knew I’d taken. zero day in Gatlinburg.  So I asked them how long they’d been there and it had only been 10 minutes.  I told them about where the other two couples were and then about that time we were joined by Katherine, a southbounder who was solo hiking from Davenport a few miles north.  
So we all talked for a while as the others came in.  Several soon had their hiking clothes laid out on the nearby bushes to dry and I went around the right side of the shelter where a narrow path ran between the shelter and the vegetation to get a bandana bath, change into dry clothes and to rinse out my hiking clothes and while I’ up there (the path ran up and stopped at the back edge of the shelter) I noticed the shelter had a metal roof.  A hot metal roof because the sun was out.  So I laid my clothes out up there to dry instead of the bushes below and went back down after I’d dressed to tell the others.  Soon the roof had clothes and boots everywhere drying out.  
The way this shelter area was laid out was nice, and a little odd.  Nice in the sense that the spring water was coming out of a PVC pipe only 20 feel away from the front of the shelter.  Odd in that the bear bag cables the rangers had installed at the site were only 20 yards away, also in front of the shelter opening and the privy was about 5 yards further but to the right.  Also, the grill area was 15 feet in front of the shelter opening, dead center.  Now I’m no expert but I had read two leading bear books and one thing both stressed is that you hang your bear bag at least 100 yards from where you plan on sleeping AND from where you plan on cooking your food.  Sorta like a big triangle.  So here the park rangers totally disregard that.  Also, why put the privy 5 yards beyond and adjacent to the bear bag cables?  I told the women in the morning, did any of you consider that getting up in the middle of the night you’d be walking in the dark past the bear bag cable system to the privy?  None had thought of that but thanked me for telling them then instead of the previous day.So anyhow, while it was still daylight, Tony and I gathered some dry wood.  There wasn’t much at all to be had.  I figured the horde of thru-hikers had scavenged most of it.  But. We did scrape up a little and someone started a fire in the fireplace and that kept things a little warm as the sunset.  Some, me included, used the fire as well to finish drying clothes that were still damp.  We all sat around talking while fixing our own dinners and I learned that Sid and Clair were from Blacksburg.  So we talked awhile about the area and about Virginia in general.  Clair is a student at George Mason.Well just before 9:00 2 young male hikers arrived and they set about doing what the rest of us had already done.  The way the shelter works is first come, first serve, so you pick a spot on either the top row of planks or on the bottom row of planks.  So I took the far left upper.  Also, you always sleep with your head facing the opening of the shelter never the rear because the mice come out at night and they’ll run along the rafter beams and along the perimeter of the interior at times.  People have had mice run into their bags, over their faces and even get tangled up in people’s hair. Mice generally don’t like to get out in the open though so, face the front!So Leslie and her aunt, Cindy, were right below me and somehow we got talking about bears and I said, why do you think I picked the top row?  If it/they come in here, they’re gonna sniff around the bottom row first, it’s easier.  With all of you down there they’ve got plenty to eat before they move on to the top row.  Cindy said she didn’t sleep well all night thinking about that.  So, once the sun set we pretty much all simultaneoulsy for in our sleeping bags.  Most went to sleep or tried to, some figeting around for that right position, and a few read by headlamps.  I didn’t have a sleeping pad because I normally sleep in my hammock but the wooden boards were not that uncomfortable, like sleeping on the floor really.  I used one of my collapsible water bottles that was only half full as a pillow.  Worked out great!  I still tossed and turned like the others most of the night but I got some decent sleep.  Enough to get me through another day...","Newfound Gap, TN
",Tri Corner Knob Shelter,"Jun 14, Thu",15.53
TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594366,"So just as we had all gone to bed the previous night sort of simultaneously without anyone really saying anything, we all arose with the sun at 6:00am.  
Most fixed breakfast for themselves and ate.  I don’t really do breakfast so I got my pack and unpacked it all where my sleeping bag was and slowly repacked everything in the order I wanted it.  I changed back into my hiking clothes which were nice and dry and only a little smelly after rinsing them out the night before.  I have two pair but the other pair I like to keep as my town clothes and I actually have a third set that I sleep in but on occasion, especially if I know my next destintion is a town hotel with a laundry, I’ll just leave on and hike in.
So pretty much everyone followed suit and repacked and got ready to leave and couple by couple they left.  Katherine and the two late arrivals were heading south and they left sometime after me.  The other three couples were all going north only to Davenport, 14.8 miles away.  They had each only hiked the 72 miles of the Smokey Mountains from Fontana to Davenport.  I think all of them were out there about as long as Leslie and Cindy who I knew were on their 6th and last day.  So I’d be going off in their direction only I’d be going 3 miles further today to Green Corner Road and then off the trail 200 yards to Standing Bear Hostel.
So Tony, Meg, Leslie and Cindy all took off together before me and Sid and Clair were still not ready.  I had a few things left to do and about 10 minutes after the foursome left, I left.  I asked Sid, you think I’ll catch them?  He laughed, oh yeah!
Leaving Tri Corner it’s - slight uphill then a long downhill until Low Gap 8 miles away.  Then the trail goes up again, hence the name, “Low Gap”, for 2-1/2 miles and then all downhill into Davenport Gap.  For some reason Inwas feeling really good.  Even going uphill at the beginning I did a 25-minute mile, pretty fast for me going up, down or flat.  I then hit the downs and went 22, 25 and 21 minute miles over the next three.  Well I caught the four in the meantime taking pictures at mile 2.7.  Leslie said, I told you all he’d catch us by three!  So we said our goodbyes again and I wished them well driving home and they let me go ahead.  Within several minutes their conversation faded off into the distance and it was just me and nature again.  
Coming up on one turn I heard something very big and loud in the bushes ahead 2” yards and on the lower bank to my left so I stopped.  I didn’t hear it again so I eased up trying to be quiet to see what it was.  It had to be either a bear, a boat or a deer.  Nothing else out there would be that big, or as big as it sounded.  Well, a mountain lion, but they’re rare and usually come out at night.  So I got up there and it was hard to see through the thick foliage but I heard it again, going away and more distant, so I missed whatever it was.  I had seen  cloven-hooved prints on the path both today and on previous days and knew board were a problem in the woods.  I don’t recall if I mentioned it before but the park service had erected steel grating (hooved animals won’t walk on grating) and heavy-gauge wire fencing to keep the boars out of delicate areas of the park such as where Birch trees were thriving.  So anyhow, never figured out what that animal was.
Shortly thereafter, at 10:22 (I’d left at 7:08), I got to Cosby Knob Shelter, my original destination from the previous day.  So I looked at my Runkeeper and my phone had died.  I checked my charger and nothing.  I guess it had died too.  Darn, that meant I’d have to go the last nine 11 miles without Brigette!  Totally alone now.  I left the foursome a note, ate a little dried fruit and vegetables, drank some electrolyte and headed on.  I was making great time and figured I’d be at the hostel between 3-4pm.  The first 7.6 miles had only taken me 3 hours and 12 minutes to cover and the last real hill was after Low Gap.  Nothing to stop for now too since my phone was dead.  No camera, no phone, no Runkeeper.  
So as can be expected, I came upon some good vista views but, couldn’t take pictures so I looked at them for a few seconds and moved on.  I came up one hill, must have been after Low Gap, and up ahead were these huge rocks and the trail turned to the left.  You could tell the rocks were at an overlook.  On top of the nearest boulder to me was a huge turkey.  Again, no camera.  So as I eased up I got about 10 yards from it and it flew over the rock edge.  For those who think wild turkeys can’t fly, yes, they can.
I saw a really cool bug towards the end of the hike today, but again, no camera.  It was vivid neon green and kept flitting about in front of me on the ground.  I’d get within a foot and it would fly up about four feet in front of me again and just kept that up for about 30 feet. 
I also saw a really cool waterfall just off of I-40 only a mile from my destination.  
So finally I arrived at the hostel, my timing pretty accurate, 3:20pm.  I’d made great time and now I could relax and charge my devices.
The hostel looks like a real throughback to the 1960’s.  I’m looking for The Magic Bus that must go with this place.  I kinda like it but then I was always reading up on the hippie/yippie generational stuff of Abbie Hoffman, Ken Kesey, Timothy Leary and even Charles Manson.  Lectured a class one day at New River Community College in Dublin, Virginia about Charles Manson.  So I could go on and on about this hostel but I’ll save that maybe for its own chapter.  It certainly could be one or two.  But I started charging my stuff, asked if they had any beer and they did, so I sat down outside with a small group talking and had about 3 beers.  Then I walked about 1/2 mile up the road to get better cell reception so I could make my reservations for Hot Springs and to call Susan.  Then back down to the hostel to check on my hiking clothes in the dryer, I’d already taken a shower and just rinsed them out while I was in there.  
So once I got back I ate half a can of Lays version of Pringles, filtered some water, drank that and another two PBRs and bought. Pizza and ate that.  I know, not the most nutritious of dinners and I actually commented on that but hey, at this point calories are calories and I’ll eat right in Hot Springs in two days.  I also bought bag of peanut M&Ms, the large one.  Ate those while typing this.So I’ve been updating this now for almost three hours.  It takes a while to type this on an I-phone.  Anyhow, it’s 11:00pm now and I gotta get up at 5:00am so I can get on the trail by sunup.  I have a 20 miler to Walnut Mountain Shelter, or thereabouts.  I don’t have to stay in shelters anymore because I’m out of the Great Smokey Mountains as of Davenport Gap.  So I made it through the whole 72.3 miles of GSMNP in 39-1/2 hours over 4 days of hiking and then the zero day thrown in there.  So after Walnut Mountain Shelter, the plan is to hike 13.3 miles into Hot Springs, NC on Sunday, the trail goes right through town, and then take a zero day on Monday to clean up and rest up.  So, today ends day 20 and I’ve now covered 241.1 of the 470.1 to Damascus (not counting the AT approach trail).  So, 230 miles to go and 18 days to get to Damascus by July 3rd.  We’ll see...","Tri Corner Knob Shelter

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594573,"so I awoke to a rooster crow at the hostel , heck, I was already awake.  It was 5:30am and I was anxious to go.  I had a long day ahead of me and the start wasn’t going to be easy.  A 5 mile long 2700 foot climb up Snowbird Mountain.  The was the only one awake at the hostel, so last one up, first one up, so I did my shopping in the hostel store, a couple packs of Ramen soup, a couple of energy bars and I was good to go.  I topped off my water and filtered it into its respective bottles of electrolyte and pure water and shortly I was out the door.  At 6:47am I was on my way once again.  Snowbird was not going to be a cakewalk by any stretch and I knew with my legs needing a 1/2 hour to 3-hour period to get the lactic acid out, this was going to be a “Pic high school XC workout”.  OK, let’s go!!  So things are going smoothly and I’m counting off each mile as a repetition in a workout chain when at 1-1/4 miles, as I’m following g the trail around the perimeter of a natural basin formed by a mountain stream, I hear the all-too-familiar sound of large mammals.  So, I freeze.  I look over the basin to my right about 1:00 on a clock dial and see three bears, two large cubs and mama, about thirty yards away, looking back up at me.  We all just paused for a few seconds.  I didn’t want to startle them any more so I slowly tried to put my trekking poles down and I reached for my I-phone on my sleeve at the same time.  I guess my poles made the slightest noise and they bolted into the basin below.  So, no photo once again but at least I got to see them.  I was hoping I’d catch them again on the other side but I never did.  Bear sightings now up to 5.  
So I eventually made it to the top of Snowbird and all the while (this is true of any mountain climbing) you, or I, envision a sort of Sound of Music vista of the surrounding mountains.  Guess what? It is rarely like that.  Usually you only notice you are now going downhill instead of up.  Well, Snowbird wasn’t like that and I saw  clearing, then a power line off the trail and into what was obviously a clearing so I followed it figuring I’d backtrack the 100 yards or so to the trail when I was done exploring.  So beyond the tower was the surreal image of a space age antenna.   Now I’m in the business of satellite communications so I’m supposed to be an expert on these things, but, beside it being manmade and obviously government, I wasn’t familiar with it.  It resembled a broader mind’s eye of what an Apollo nose capsule would look like.  Sorta.  So I went on up.  It was obviously also the top of Snowbird Mountain.  Woo-hoo!!  First obstacle in a long day down.  There was a wooden rail fence around the antenna with all the typical government warnings and threats so I took a break, took my pack off, hydrated and tried to call Susan all the while aware of the hidden cameras and such.  The notices informed that this was an FAA antenna and impeding or infringing on its operation could cost the lives of many people.  IK, chill, I’m not breeching  “the zone”, I’m just ‘laxing for a moment.  So I tried calling Susan but I had to keep wandering back and forth and around the fence to try to get anything above 1 bar.  Finally I got through so I stood still.  We talked and caught up for about twenty minutes and when I told her where I was and that I expected Feds to show up any more minute, sure enough, 5 minutes later as we’re talking here comes a white 4-wheel drive pick-up.  I said to Susan, they’re here...
So I didn’t panic or anything but just acted normal and kept right on talking like everything’s normal and I had nothing to hide, (except for the FAA crypto I had digitally cyphered using my super-secret Get Smart lunchbox).  Yeah, right.  So these two guys get out of the truck and are milling about and eventually I say good-bye to Susan.  So I wander over to where they are at,now realizing they are not Feds but just two guys up there.  The one guy, Heath, is a retired P-3 Orion pilot and immediately commented on my USS Lapon ballcap.  He had his command ballcap on top.  For those who don’t know, the P-3 is a multi-function aircraft, one of those functions being “submarine hunter”.  Heath, you never caught Lapon!!  So we talked for a long while.  He’s retired and looking to hike the AT so he was up there to leave trail magic.  His buddy Rick gave all these excuses as to how he’d love to hike but this pain and that malady.  Finally I (and Heath) said, you either do it or you don’t.  Everyone has reasons on why they can’t.  It’s the reasons they can that matter though.  Upon parting Rick and Heath were all fired up to hike the AT.  Heath took the photo of me in front of the FAA antenna.
So no sooner do I backtrack to the trail and I spot this guy 80 yards ahead and I think, where did he come from? He pauses for a photo and I get within maybe 40 yards and he’s gone.  I pause for the same photo vista so now I’m again 80 or more yards behind.  No big deal.  Recall my previous day’s entry bragging on myself about going through the Great Smokey Mountains in 4 daysand kicking ass taking names doing 20+ mile days?  Hell, I’ll chew this guy up in no time.
So I press on and on down Snowbird now and at Groundhog Creek Shelter, 7-miles into my day, I catch up with this guy.  So we start talking and his trail name is “Late Start”, because he got started on June 5.  Now it is June 16 and we’re at mile 248.3 and he and I both did the approach trail so add 8.8 miles to that for 257.1.  I thought I was fast!  Late Start had just done 257 miles in 12 days and the day wasn’t over yet!!! Where I had gone through the Smokies in 4 days plus a zero day, Late Start had done it in three with no breaks!  Now as we talked, I learned he was from Portland, Maine and the Whites were his backyard, plus hiking was his week-to-week forte as running was to me.  I was completely in awe, humbled, and immediately thought of my post from the previous day.  In comparing notes where I had done the one nearly 27-mile day, he had done several 28-29 milers, several 24+ miles and all 20+ mile days with no zeroes.  Hell, he was in another league!!!
Well, as it turned out he was heading for Walnut Mountain Shelter too and as pleasantries go he said, see you there and he was off. 
Well. A little while later I’l struggling ups mountain and two older women come by going south.  They had started in Damascus and I said that’s where I’m going! They said they were only going to Davenport Gap and then had to stop for a couple months and then were going to come back on the trail in August and finish up.  Here’s the kicker.  They had started the AT at Mount Kathadin in Maine 18 years ago, but due to children, family obligations, work and the rest, they had these setbacks.  Here they are 18 years later completing the journey!  So cool!!!
So I’m anticipating Max Patch, the premiere vista point of the southern AT, a mountaintop vista with 360 degree views of all the surrounding mountains.  So I finally start my climb up the path to the Patch, still 7-1/2 miles from Walnut Mountain, mind you, and I go by two black guys heading down so I comment on the view they have obviously just seen and what I am about to partake.  So a litttle bit of parting comment and the one guy says, hey, you want a beer?  And I , of course, say heck yeah!  He goes, it’s not cold, we’re going back to the car for cold ones now, trail magic, you know?  I said hot, cold, a beer’s a beer right now! So as we talked I learned that the first guy thru-hiked the AT last year in 6-1/2 months.  They are from m Charlotte and he so loved the view from Max Patch that they come come back here and leave trail magic and camp from time to time. I just was fortunate to make their acquaintance.  So the one guy goes, my trail name is Black-alachia.  I couldn’t understand what he said for 2-3-4 times and finally he goes, like Appalachia only I’m black, so,  Blackalachia!  So cool!!  
So I spent probably 40 minutes on top of Max Patch enjoying he view and watching he thunderstorm pass between the mountains to the northeast.  I talked to several people day hiking and camping out for that weekend and U got one guy to take my picture finishing the bottle of beer on top of Max Patch.
Finally I started down way behind schedule but it was well worth it and I’d still pull into Walnut Mountain Shelter before sunset.  
At the north base of Max Patch, there’s Blackalacian setting up camp with his group and I hear, Tim!,  you want another beer?  As well as the offer sounded I told Black I got 7+ miles to go and I needed my faculties so we said our goodbyes.  I told him I’d look up his You Tube videos, under Blackalacian, and he said he’d follow my posts.  So here’s to you, Blacalachian!!  A brother from a different mother, my friend!!!So after that I basically powered into Walnut around 7:20pm. Late Start was there along with Bill, a 30-year career Army Colonel retiree.  Bill and LS, I’ll call him, talked for a short while as I got my stuff situated.  Farmgirl was camped nearby and in her tent.  Bill and LS felt that Farmgirl was somewhat concerned about bears being a little away from the shelter and the bugs were so bad around the shelter that I said well, I’m putting my hammock up, so I put it next to Farmgirl. She came out to say hello, a 60-ish woman, very fit, and a new grandmother.  She’s been completing the AT in 250 mile segments year after year.  She’s from Iowa, hence Farmgirl.  So I got my stuff situated, took my bandana bath, hung my pack on the beat cables and turned in.So ended another night on the trail.  20.73 miles down in 12 hours and 35 minutes.  Total distance, not counting approach trail, 261.4 miles.  Only 208 miles to go!!!Talk to you tomorrow!","Walnut Mountain Shelter

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594556,"before I go into my daily diary of my hike, let me take this opportunity to wish all those Fathers a happy and wonderful Happy Father’s Day and particularly to my own son-in-law, Brian Twiddy, a new day as of six weeks ago!
So as I hiked today’s 13 miles into Hot Springs, NC, I had a lot of time to think about my own father, my experiences with him, my upbringing and my recollections and memories of him.  He passed in September of 2005, so as I thought the time on the trail flew by and Inwas filled with both sadness but mainly joy that I had a father to bring me up, for better or worse.  You can’t pick ‘me, you deal with what you’ e got, and somebody somewhere as it worse than you and would gladly switch with you so here goes:
My father, as far as I recollect, never told me he loved me (my mother would say he loved me but he never did).  My father beat me with a board, later in my early teens of my choosing, when I did wrong (and sometimes when I was wrongly judged).  My father rarely went to any of my events or supported me by his appearance in any way.  My father did three outdoor activities with me in my lifetime that I recall.  My father rarely, if ever, carried on any lengthy dialog with me or any meaningful conversation as to my life and future. 
What good was my father?  Plenty.  He was the only person he I had and in retrospect the only one I would it could ever want. 
Why?  What did my dad do?  I thought about this while hiking the 13.1 miles today into Hot Springs, NC on Father’s Day.
My father was career navy, a WWII submarine veteran and decorated hero.  He supported our family throughout my life and while we weren’t wealthy by any measure we were never for want and basically lived a typical middle class life. My parents never fought, they loved each other and despite flare-ups any family faces, life was good.  
From my earliest recollection, maybe 5-years old, my father took my brother (2-years older) Jim, Jr. and I to the desert near San Diego where we lived to shoot.  He had a .22 caliber long-barrel single shot revolver.  He lined up some soda bottles at what seemed like 25 yards away but it was probably more likely ken25 feet.  I recall listening intently to his instructions and how the pistol kicked violently and my hands leapt over my head as I fired but I didn’t drop the gun. The force rocked me. I missed the bottles completely.  Jim Jr. shot and I’ll never forget it but we had thought he too missed but he had put a round through he neck of a soda bottle and the bottle didn’t break.  He said he meant to do that.  Right, Hopalong!!
That’s all I remember from that day and I never shot guns with my father again.  53 years later I have that priceless memory.
When I was six my father had bought Jim Jr. and I baseball mitts for Christmas.  I’m a lefty so mine was a Joe Pepitone first baseman’s mitt.  I had that same mitt all through high school and into college but somewhere along the way I lost it.  I rarely used it anyhow.  
1st day I have the mitt, my father takes Jr. and I out in the yard to teach us how to throw and catch.  He had been an accomplished athlete himself in high school and was the player-coach of the SubPac Fleet softball team.  1st throw I miss the catch completely and the ball smacks me in the nose.  I’m bleeding, I’m shocked more than seriously hurt, and what little pride a six-year old can muster is gone.  I threw down the mitt ran inside to mama.  My father never played ball with me again.  To this day I suck at baseball and softball because of that fielding error, but, I have that priceless memory.
Again when I was six, in school we learning to tell time and we had a project to go home and construct a clock and bring it to class.  You could have help from a sibling or parent so all was good.  My father took heavy gauge construction board (white) put two real clock hands on it (black) with. Gold butterfly pin so that hands really moved and then used a stencil kit and put on the 12 numbers and the minute hash marks in between, all to scale and accurate.  It was about 1-foot square.  It was also simply amazing!!  I had the best clock in the class.  Most others were crude rudementary paper drawings of pencil or crayon.  I learned to tell time very quickly and I’d play with that clock all the time and take it everywhere until it finally broke down.  Probably needed rewinding or new batteries but, I have that priceless memory.  
WhenI was seven, we moved from Honolulu to Virginia Beach via San Diego (my parents were both from nearby Taft, California).  We drove cross country I. 7 days to “sight-see”.  Not much to see from a moving car doing 60+ MPH.  There’s the painted desert-ZOOM!!, there’s the Grand Canyon-ZOOM!!, etc, etc.  but my father bought Jim and me state pennants as we went through each state, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Arkansas, and so on and Matchbox cars and comic books to keep us occupied in the very back reward-facing seat of a 1967 Chrysler station wagon. I wish I still had the Matchbox cars and the comics!!  
I’m Virginia, my father became repair officer on the submarine tender USS Orion in Norfolk. On some of his duty nights, Jr. and I would vie for the opportunity to spend the night.  What a thrill!! I can recall running around the pier and tender all day, usually with Scotty Bellah, the C.O.’s son who was my age of eight.  It was our playground for a day!  We’d lower the sum waiter in the wardroom galley and then toss eggs down than reel it in to see the mess we made until some steward came and shooed is off, usually with a bug juice ransom not to return.  We’d run down to the parking lot and gather gravel rocks than gonna k on board along the weatherdecks and throw rocks at and through unsuspecting jelly fish below.  That was a blast!  We’d go to the wardroom and get out all the backgammon pieces and play whatever suited out imaginations, never bothering to put the pieces back.  Same with the playing cards.  We could also, with very little effort, get the stewards to give us plentiful ice cream, the soft-serve type, unt our stomachs hurt.  At the end of the day, I recall my father stripping down to his “skivvies” of white T-shirt and boxers so I’d do the same, only I had tightie whities and had not earned my boxers yet.  He’d get in his bottom bunk and I’d get in the top.  A whole day of blissful fun and we probably had not spoken all day and he had not done anything with me, but, I have that priceless memory.
When I was 10 my father was well in trenches in the Kempsville Volunteer Fire Department & Rescue Squad.  He took me to a day-long demo and I passed out due to heat exhaustion/stroke with the temps in the upper 90’s.  Once again my father wasn’t focused on me but his tasks at hand.  Fire & rescue people, including my father, revived me.  I got a chocolate bar out of the deal so all was good.  He never took me to another demo or any fire/rescue related event again and I never followed in his footsteps in that field ( my brother Jim did and was very successful at it).  But, I have that priceless memory.
Again when I was 10 and n Cub Scouts we had a pinebox derby competition where you buy the kit of rectangular pine and with your father or mentor carve it into a race at.  I recall that my father, despite being a nuclear and mechanical engineer, unbeknownst to me at the time), let me design it and it wasn’t the most aerodynamic.   But, he let me do it the. traced my design on the wood and I carved it out.  We added the wheels and I recall lathed out a space beneath the front, melted some lead from fishing weights and formed a rectangular weight and screwed that in place for added forward ballast.  That was all legal as long as your car weight was below a maximum limit.  We added decals from a plastic model kit and were set.  I think I lost in the first or second round but so what?  I have that priceless memory. 
In Webelos, the intermediary stage between Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts, we had a father/son camp out at a church nearby.  My father taught me how to bake a potatoe in aluminum foil in the fire.  I thought that was so cool, but, he never camped with me again, but I have that priceless memory.  
I later played 1 year of organized football for St. Gregory’s Catholic Church/School.  It just so happens I played on the team the year we went undefeated and won the championship.  Nothing to do with me, but I was a member of the team.  My father came to one game, the championship. And Mr. Robusto, put me in for a few plays at defensive back, because we were so far ahead.  I think I played two downs but it didn’t matter,we won and more importantly, my father was there in the stands so I have that priceless memory.
When I got into junior high school, I discovered my athletic calling, distance running, thanks to my good buddy Glen Barr.  I was fairly successful in junior high but my father never attended any of my races.  He finally came to the city championship meet where I finished second to my great friend and team mate ( and year younger than me) Rick Kujawski. I didn’t dwell on all the races my father had not been at but I relished in the fact that he was here for this one, even though I lost.  
High school was no different.  As a freshman, I was in a 1000 yard indoor track event (run outdoors by the way, go figure) against a fellow Kempsville senior, Steve Sawyer.  I had broken Eddie Lee’s junior high school record in the mile that year and Eddie had broken Steve’s junior high record 2 years prior so I guess I was supposed to be this young hotshot.  Didn’t work out that way.  Steve was the reigning Tidewater Athlete of the Year having set the area record in the mile at 4:14 and was one of the premier middle distance runners in the state of Virginia.  So my dad tells me to stay on Steve’s shoulder and then pass him at the end for the win.  OK, dad, will do.  Well we take off and I’m going all out trying to stay with the tall lanky Sawyer.  Barely 80 yards in Sawyer is pulling away and I’m going all out!!  Needless to say Sawyer beat me, and everyone else.  
I went on to have a pretty successful track career in the district, I didn’t make any noise on the regional or state level but I had fun and within the neighborhood was known as a distance runner of some success.  Despite all that, that freshman race was the only one my father attended.  After high school I competed at Norfolk State College for one year of cross country and indoor track and later ran countless road races which I still compete in.  In all, 100’s of races, some I won and set records, others I placed and yet most I simply finished. Yet through all those years my father showed up at only one other of my races, a 1989 Turkey Trot 10k at Mount Trashmore, an annual ritual in Virginia Beach.  I still have the audio/video he shot so his voice of course is on it.  So three races he attended of mine in 31 years, but guess what?  I remember those races because he was there not how I finished.
Later in life my father was best man at my wedding, he swore me in when I enlisted in the navy, he swore me again when I re-enlisted.  
Random tidbits about my father:
I was a fairly good chess player and had been a member of the junior high chess team and later even won a tournament on my submarine, USS Lapon.  My father never played chess although he knew how to play.  Despite my success, I played my father on three separate occasions and only after much pleading.  He beat me all three times.  
He was ambidextrous.  Not only that, he could write forward and backward and do both simultaneously.  He would write letters to my mom in code where each page was in a different color and you had to have all three or four letters in order to read the one.  
He was a WWII submarine hero but rarely talked about it.  Only later in life and when I became a submariner did he share some of his exploits.  
He was a multi-sport athlete in high school and in junior college until WWII intervened. 
He is a member of his high school hall-of-fame in Taft, California.
He was a very good amateur artist.  He’d ask you to pick a number, any number, and he’d fashion a characture out of it.  I once came to him with a linoleum block print project I had in sixth grade and I couldn’t think of what to have as a subject and in literal minutes he schetched out a dinged up aluminum trash can beside a lamppost and fence.  I used that as my model and made the linoleum block print for the Princess Ann Art Show and it placed! Someone later stole the block print.  But, that’s the kind of guy he was.
He was a graduate of the 5th nuclear power school class ever, taught by Westinghouse, that was the precursor of the now-prestigious Navy nuclear power program.  He and fellow grads were the first to ever conduct a nuclear core change-out.  Prior to that, it had never been done, in the world!  He worked on the USS  Nautilus, the famous nuclear submarine that ran under the polar ice cap. His military exploits are tremendous and legendary.
He became a volunteer fire fighter and rescue squad member and one of the first in the city of Virginia Beach to become a verified cardiac technician.  He was stellar at whatever he chose to accomplish throughout his life.  My mom and he stayed happily married for nearly 59 years until he died in 2005. They never argued that I recall and they truly loved and adored each other, setting the example and creating a blissful existence at home.  Yes, there was turmoil, it was no Brady Bunch, but in hindsight my childhood was great!  Between me and my 4 siblings, we’ve all been married only once, we’re all still married, and all at least 25 years or more thanks to the example my parents set.My father was by no means the perfect father.  He hated my friends as he considered them a bad influence not realizing that maybe I was the bad influence on them!  Their fathers likewise didn’t like me.  Funny,  all the moms liked us.  Johnny McCabe’s dad was the exception.  He liked us all and would do anything for us.  Despite all I’ve said here, for good or bad, he was my father.  I miss the lost opportunities but relish the memories I have however few they may seem to be.  I still see and talk to my father in my dreams.  I often both in my dreams and during the day ask for his advice.  Sometimes he answers in cryptic spiritual ways and sometimes not.  Sometimes the dreams are so vivid and real that I awake and think, I’m gonna call my dad today, and then, usually slowly, I realize he isn’t there anymore and he’s been dead for 13 years.  I am not sad.  I am thrilled that so dreamed of him and he spoke to me and I relish the time I can dream again of him! He is alive in my dreams and in my memories as I’ve expressed here and I’ll always have those priceless memories.As the anonymous quote my daughter, Darley, gave me goes:“The greatest gift ever had, came from God, I call him dad”.Happy Father’s Day, DAD!!!","N/A

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594614,"So for a long while I’m hearing Farmgirl zip and unzip her tent and/or sleeping bag and I’m wondering what the hell is she doing?  She never said anything but she’s sleeping literally 5 feet from me. I’m a little restless but OK I’m my hammock but I can’t figure out what her deal is.  
So, I wake up as usual with the birds and as I’m getting out of my hammock, Farmgirl soon emerges from her tent.  What had happened was she had thought there was a mouse in her Big Agnes, a premiere tent maker.  So she kept getting out of her sleeping bag and tent to investigate.  She never found one but as she fell asleep, a mouse pounced on her chest and as she turned on her light she was eye-to-eye with her nemesis.  She quickly evacuated it and finally went to sleep.  I heard all about it this morning.  Farmgirl, afraid of bears but not mice.  
As it turns out, a mouse had also infiltrated the bear bag hanging system and gotten into Late Start’s food bag.  The Colonel told me it sampled everything in Late Start’s food bag, so it was all useless and on top of that, you can’t dump it, you gotta carry it into town.  Fortunately, Late Start were both headed into Hot Sorings 13 miles away so no big deal.
So I set out about 10 minutes before Late Start and Bill and Farmgirl were hanging out as they were only going about 3 miles to the next shelter and then meeting up with either Bill or Farmgirl’s friends (they weren’t an item as far as I understood but were simply hiking friends) and then going into Hot Springs later.  
So I’m pouring on the miles thinking I don’t want Late Start to catch me but I know he will.  How long can I hold out? It’s only 13 miles so the race is on!
Well, I stopped for water at 2-1/2 miles and here comes Late Start! Damn!  I had a 10-minute head start and he still caught me.  So we camelled up and he went on ahead of me and I said I’ll see you later this afternoon in the Springs.  
So shortly thereafter, hiking alone, that’s when I started thinking about the meaning of Father’s Day and my own father and that carried me through the next 10-miles to Hot Springs.  
The thing about Hot Springs, like some other AT towns, is you hear the traffic from a long way off and that only fires you up.  At Hot Springs, you can actually see the town through the trees and it is close, maybe a few hundred yards away and down.  Problem is, in the mountains, you have a series of serpentine switchbacks to navigate to get there so your excitement is heightened but it takes “forever” to get there.  
Once I did, I stepped out I’d be woods into a residential street.  I saw the AT sign across the street so I followed it.  Pretty soon that transformed into AT diamonds on the sidewalk and I was walking down “main street”.  First gas ststion, the only gas station, I went in and bought a. 16-ounce Diet Coke and parked myself out front and drank it peacefully.  It was 1:05pm.  I had left Walnut Mountain Shelter at 6:48am so not bad by my account for hiking a 1/2 marathon on Father’s Day.
When I finished my Coke I noticed it was really hot out so I asked the attendant if she knew the temperature.  She looked at an outdoor thermometer and said, 102.  Really?  Probably not since it sits under a white metal awning but every bit of 90 degrees plus.  The news later confirmed that.  It drains you fast too, the direct sun and the asphalt/concrete.  
Anyhow, I had a 200 yards walk down the AT which passes right through town to the Hot Springs Resort & Spa, my destination. So as I’m making my way down the sidewalk, who do I see coming out of a bar & grill on the opposite side of main street but Late Start!  So I yell at him and go to greet him.  He had gotten in an hour earlier.  So we talked and I said, how old are you anyhow?  He says, 28, I said well I don’t feel so bad now not being able to keep up I’m 58.  He was amazed and said I only hope I can hike as fast as you when I’m 58!!  I said well, it’s only a number and I’m still gonn chase yor ass!  He was all excited because he was picking up his dog from a friend and he was going to hike the rest of the AT with his dog.  I found it very complimentary that Late Start said he wanted to hike along with me to Damascus because he felt we could feed off of each other.  I told him we’d hook up tomorrow in town and discuss it after I had a chance to update my plans.  Once I got to the Resort & Spa, they told me I was too early and had to wait until 3:00 to check in.  It was 1:40.  I told them that if I’d known that I’d have hiked slower,   Not really though.  So Inasked if there was a place Incould shower and/or get cleaned up on the meantime and she said not really but the French River is right over there.  I said, can I Swim in that? And she said, sure.  So I went down there and took off my Salomon’s and went in the rest of my clothes on, socks and all plus Lapon ballcap.  Believe me, I stunk.  I washed out my stuff and eventually emerged with just running shorts on.  I gathered my stuff and walked back up to the lodge entrance.  I sat my pack and clothes on the front porch and went in asking about a charging port since my I-phone had died on the trail and they pointed me to an outlet not caring that I was half naked in the lobby.  I then bought a fudgecycle or however it’s spelled and ate it on the front porch.  So I hung out there talking to guests and reading about Gilgamesh until 2:30 when I finally asked if I could check in and yes, my suite was ready.It is a three-section suite with a heart-shaped jacuzzi bath on one side, a living room in the middle and a bedroom on the other side.  So I dumped my stuff, filled the tub (it is fed from the same famous mineral springs) and took a quick hot bath.  Then I changed and went “downtown”, a one block strip of business.  I went to a bar & grill overlooking the river and ate a burger and caught up with the journal and other stuff as I could. Reception is terrible because Hot Springs is surrounded by the mountains.  Beautiful, but in a gap.  So, I met a ton of people and Ashley took good care of me and finally around 10:00 I was done and walked the 200 yards back to my suite.   I had planned my next few days and tomorrow I’ll refine that but for he most part, I’m on schedule andI have a zero tomorrow to catch up on things.  Until then, goodnight.  As for mileage, I’m now at 275 with 195 to go.Until tomorrow,Tim","Walnut Mountain Shelter

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594836,"So on my Hot Springs zero day I had a lot of things on my list, including make sure the clothes dried that I had washed in the jacuzzi tub the night before.
I got up at 8:00 and got cleaned up then went the 150 yards to town, one city block with no street lights.  That’s Hot Springs.  Maybe two city blocks if you count the gas station. Dollar Store and a few other outlying businesses.  
So I stopped by the local outfitters first to see what pins they’d have for my pack,if they had any decals or memorabilia magnets for my mainland refrigerator and any good postcards to mail home.  So I found what I needed there in talking with Wayne and James and then ask James if he might be able to fix my trekking pole that had lost its tip.  So he told me to bring it on by and leave it with him.
So I went from there to the Dollar Store for Epsom salts and to see if they had a 6-foot I-phone cable.  The 10-foot cable I was using was just too long and the standard 3-foot was too short.  So I was happy to find both the cable I needed and the salts there.  So back to the Resort & Spa to drop that stuff off and get my damaged trekking pole.  So I dropped the trekking pole off with James and by then the post office was open.  It’s only open 9:00-11:30.  Why?  I don’t know.  Maybe not enough business in such a small town.  So I got my pre-packed box of stuff Susan had sent and opened it there.  Most of the stuff, an assortment of food, I kept but I did send back about 3 pounds of stuff I didn’t need.  Inadvertently, I also shipped back the postcard I’d just bought and had intended to mail to Susan.  So back to the outfitters for another postcard and then back to the post office to mail it.
Then I went for morning coffee up the street and I sat in there approving time sheets on line and going through all my e-mail, mostly junk.  I watched a video of my HS coach’s Hall-of-game induction talk and updated the trail journal some.  I also added a bunch of photos to Facebook and talked to Russell Riggs about him meeting me on the trail the last day or so.  
After that, I intended to go to lunch at Mosaic, but they are closed on Mondays!  So I ended up at the same place as the night before.  
When I went into the patio area, there’s Late Start with his dog!  So we sat and talked and I ordered a water and a beer and when the waitress came back to take  my order, Insaid I’d have 6 of the fire wings and six of the hell fire wings.  She said I’d have to sign a waiver for the hell fire wings and asked if I wanted to do the challenge.  I said no, but I’m Cajun and I can handle most places’ hot stuff.  She said these are dangerously hot and over all the years only 4 people have been able to eat 6 in 5 minutes.  So I said, look, I’m not here to prove my manhood so how about 6 fire wings and 6 dry rub?  Well these hell fire wings got Late Start’s attention so he did he’d go for the challenge and that he’d never failed a wing challenge in all his 28 years.  So a guy comes out a little while later with the wings and gloves and he sits down to time Late Start.  What are the gloves for?  Well they’re mandatory.  These wings will burn your skin.  So Late Start’s looking a little concerned but not too much, he’s committed now.  So he comments, they smell hot already and I haven’t even started.  So after getting all set, he starts in and the timer hits his watch.  He gets through one and he’s sweating and his eyes are watering.  On two he takes a short breather, big mistake, and on three he suddenly says, I’m done, peels off the gloves and heads to the restroom.  The whole episode lasts maybe a minute.  I’m doing my best not to bust up laughing during the whole thing as is the timer.  The dog’s looking around like, where’s my master?  Tim, the manager and he’ll fire recipe guru comes over and sits down while Late Start is still in the bathroom.  So he’s chuckling by now as well.  Tim, I say, I know a little about capsaicin, what’s in those things?  He says he studied Asian and Mexican cooking techniques and the recipe for these wings includes a 7-million Scoville scale additive as well as a 3-million.  Now the Scoville scale goes to 16-million but that’s pure extracted capsaicin, produced in a laboratory, not naturally grown, as are the 3 & 7 million.  He also has Carolina Reaper and Ghost Pepper in there, two of the hottest hybrids of peppers.  After about 20 minutes, Late Start comes out of the bathroom and he looks rough.  Tim tells him what’s in the recipe and that each batch is individually made.  Tim tells him not to feel too bad that only 4 people had ever done it and the last guy just wolfed them down without pausing or taking a breath, then writhed on the floor for 5 minutes to wait out that requirement before taking any liquids, pickle juice, the house offering for failure or success.  So, I gotta try these wings.  Late Start wanted nothing to do with the remaining three.  I had suggested he take them back to the hostel and just set them out. Someone might try them without realizing what they are.  But Late Start was a kinder soul to his fellow man than Inwould have been and declined.  So, I peeled off about a one inch by three inch piece of wing and popped it in my mouth.  That was way more than I needed!!  My eyes were watering and my mouth burned.  Even though water nor beer helps, I was soon swishing both around in my mouth.  So after that ordeal Late Start and I talked some more and now that he’s got his dog on the trail and is nursing a calf ache, he can’t put in the huge miles so we may catch up on down the road but most likely not the next couple of days. So I paid for the lunch and he thanked me, surprised that I’d do that.  Called it trail magic.  I guess so.  I just knew he was on a budget and I’m not.  It was the least I could do, especially having witnessed his wing challenge.So he headed back to the hostel and I hung out, enjoying more beer, finishing my wings and working on both the journal, my book and my crossword.  Several people asked me about hiking the trail, particularly after I picked up my pole from James around 4:00 (he didn’t charge me either but I left him $5 and told him I’d buy him a beer or two for his trouble if he came across the street when he got off at 5).James never came in for the beer and at 9:00 I decided I better get back to the Resort with the rest of my wings for dinner since I had to get up at 5:00 to get on the trail by sun-up.I got more cash out of the bank ATM on my way back to the Resort.  Cash is still king on and around the trail!So once at the Resort, I had an epsom bath and then watched some AXS TV while still catching up the journal.  I finally went to bed at 11:00.","Hot Springs, NC

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594843,"So I get up at 5:00am and take my epsom bath with the last of the 4-pound bag.  Lasted 3 baths.  After that I get all my stuff organized as I like it in my pack.  I had a cup of coffee and ate a Pro Bar before setting out and filled my water and electrolyte bottles.  
At 6.26am I started my Runkeeper app for the day’s hike.  It was going to be a long one.  As soon as I got onto the road to cross the bridge over the French Broad River I looked back on the town to see about 8 deer run across about 150 yards away, quiet as could be, as was the rest of the town, save me.
So out of Hot Springs. The AT goes across the bridge and then into the woods on the north side.  From there it winds up a mountain about 1000 feet and you get these great views of Hot Springs, the river and the surrounding mountains.  I’ll post the ones I took.  So I saw a turtle on the trail before going up the mountain so I’ll post its picture too.  Once past Lover’s Leap Rock, which had some great boulder-sized overlooks that you could easily tumble to your death over, the trail meanders up and down for about three miles and then there’s a 2-mile up slope to the top of Rich Mountain, about 1200 feet up.  It didn’t look that bad on paper but it was a chore.  Maybe it was the heat that made it tough.  But I got up it and while hydrating and eating another Pro Bar at the top, a young couple I’d passed a few miles prior from Maine caught back up.  They were trying to average 17-miles a day and get through Pennsylvania by a certain date and only taking one zero a week.  They were heading today to Little Laurel Shelter, same as Late Start, whereas I was going 7-1/2 miles further to Jerry Cabin Shelter.  So I said happy trails and hiked on.  The trail was more flat and down with slight ups but nothing major for the next 11-1/2 miles, so it wasn’t too bad.  The worse part was trying to find water to filter without getting too sidetracked. 
As far as critters, I did see another rabbit that tried to act like it was invisible and froze, right on the trail with no cover whatsoever.  As I walked by I guess it figured it wasn’t invisible and darted off into the brush.  I also got completely startled by another grouse.  Only one this time but the whoosh-whoosh of it’s wings through and out of the rain underbrush sounded like a helicopter taking off and really got me good.  
At Little Laurel Shelter I stopped for water and there was a couple there with their dog.  I told them about the other 3 who were planning on staying there and possibly 4 thinking Moxey might be hiking with Late Start today (I didn’t know then that Moxey had skipped the zero in Hot Springs and was actually ahead of me).  It was 5:20pm when I left Little Laurel with 7-1/2 miles to go to Jerry Cabin Shelter.  By my calculations and pace, I should be there by 8:30, plenty of time to set up and I wouldn’t have to hike in the dark.  Well, the climb out of Little Laurel threw me off some because it was a steep 1.1 mile ascent of 1200 feet up Camp Creek Bald.  That took a lot out of me.  After that though it was a slight downgrade right into Jerry Cabin with some slight ups.  Easy.  Not so...The sky got dark and the temperature dropped noticeably and I still had 4 miles to go.  I tried to speed up knowing the rains were coming but to no avail.  The skies dumped on me once again.  I donned my pack cover and poncho and soldiered on.  What else was I going to do?  What I also failed to realize was that White Rock Cliffs and Bkackstack Cliffs, coming up, were just that, boulder-sized rocks that the trail led you through on the very top of the exposed mountain.  What a great unobstructed view for hundreds of miles, but not during a thunderstorm!!  Well, fortunately by then the storm was passing off to the southeast and it had stopped raining and I wasn’t in any real danger of getting hit by lightning but, I still had to navigate this narrow boulder field for 1.4 miles!  That was tedious, to say the least, but I didn’t fall and only slipped a few times, never seriously.  So finally I get back in the woods and was thankful for that.  Adrenaline sped me along and I made Jerry Cabin Shelter at 9:10pm.  In all for the day, 26.33 miles in 14 hours and 28 minutes.  I wasn’t as tired as the 26 miler out of Fontana so I must be getting in better shape!There were two guys, Go Pro and Little Bear (a 6’4” Georgian) at the shelter when I got there.  I thought they had bedded down but they were just getting up!  They had taken refuge during the thunderstorm and were going to night hike until morning so they finally took off at 11:00 so I had the shelter area to myself so I put up my hammock and after eating some nuts and dried vegetables, bandana bath and changing into dry clothes, repacking pack and hanging it from the bear cables, I read a little and looked over tomorrow’s route.  By the way, Go Pro and Little Bear were the ones who told me Moxey had passed through earlier and they said they’d heard about Late Start and me via the trail scuttlebutt, so, that’s pretty cool.  Anyhow, they soon left and I had my most peaceful night of hammock sleeping although my feet hurting kept me up a lot.Total miles:  301.  Miles to go:  170.Tomorrow’s hike:  21.1 miles to Street Gap Road and then shuttle to Nature’s Inn Hostel & Cabins.Friday’s hike:  22.6 miles to River Road and then a shuttle 3.8 miles into Erwin, TN.Saturday:  zero day in Erwin.","Hot Springs, NC

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/594875,"I got up early with the birds as I usually do on this trip but it took me longer to get my things together.  Same as usual morning routine, pack everything and get going.
A few minutes before Inwas heading out, a young girl came by from the south.  She stopped to get more water.  She had camped about a mile before the shelter.  She was attempting her first 20-miler that day to Sam’s Gap and from there getting shuttled to Mother Marian’s Hostel.  
So she left about 5-minutes ahead of me and I thought well, I’ll overtake her at some point soon but I didn’t.
After leaving the shelter, the trail led to a large meadow of overgrown grasses and weeds.  There were no great views because of the trees on the perimeter.  Then came a shirt up slope to the top of Big Butt Mountain.  Nothing spectacular, no good views even.  Then a really long down hill into Devil’s Fork Gap.  This was an 8-mile stretch of some relatively easy hiking but again no mountaintop views.  No animals to speak of either.  So far a distance hike day with nothing really to speak of.  
After Devil Fork, the trail goes up to Frozen Knob.  This was a really tough climb three miles up at an elevation of 1600 feet.  That one took a while.  I passed a couple guys getting water at one of the last stops and saw and photographed a nice waterfall.  The I finally made it to the top and was glad that was over.  The only 7-1/2 miles to go!
I got a little reprieve from the climbing with a 1.7 mile descent but then a gradual up of 1.5 miles to the top of High Tock and that was harder than it looked.  I figured I was probably tired and could have used more water and electrolyte but water sources were scarce and Inwas rationing.
After High Rock I caught up to the girl from Jerry Cabin and she was with a lady and her son and two dogs.  Turns out the dogs were Blue Tick tracking dogs with collars but they were lost on the trail.  The lady is on the phone with the owner and tells him that some guy, me, is going that way, north, and she’ll send the dogs out with me.  I tell her, lady, I’m not taking these dogs and I hike on.  The girl says she’s going north as well and she’ll take them.  The lady and her son were going south.  Right after that I pass a guy maintaining the trail and tell him about the dogs.  He can see them from where he is.  So I go on.  
So I get about 2-miles on down the trail and I hear something right behind me. I turn around and there’s one of the Blue Ticks following me, right on my heels!  So I say, come on, then, and we hike along.  He’d sniff here and there and run ahead a ways on the uphills but then stop and look back and wait for me.  This went on for about 1/2 mile until we could hear the owner and the dog ran on ahead to the road clearing.  I told him what happened and that the girl was behind me with the other dog.  He gave me a bottled water and a cold Mountain Dew while we talked and waited.  He’s an Army vet and asked about my Lapon hat.  His young son asked if he knew me and the man says, this is my brother, we’re all brothers if we served.  
A little while later the girl comes down but no dog.  The dog apparently wouldn’t follow her and went south.  The owner didn’t seem that concerned and said he’d pick him up at the next Gap at the other side of the mountain.  So he asks about the trail and I tell him where I’ve come from and where I’m going and he says, you know that place is crawling with rattlesnakes that you went through.  What place?  The place back up there, the big meadow with the tall grass.  Really?  I looked out for them but I didn’t see any.  He says a buddy of his went up there and came back with nine in one day.  Well good for him, I said, but I was hiking not turning over rocks and logs looking for them!
So the girl says she’s done with 10 miles to go (I guess I got out of sequence here in the story, this was all before Devil Fork).  She twisted her ankle and heard something pop so she was waiting for her ride to come get her there.  
At Sam’s Gap, the trail goes across a road.  I was two miles from meeting my ride to the hostel.  
I had one last 500 foot climb that hurt and called the shuttle from the top and then through a meadow and down into Street Gap.  
I then had to walk a gravel road for 3/4 mile to meet up with the driver on a state road.
Finally he showed up, Taft is his name, and he’s from Asheville but he bought this place in the mountains and fixed it up intending to cater to the many bikers who pass through.  Now his main clientele is hikers and bikers.  
So I got to the hostel around 7:00pm I guess it was and shared a three-bedroom house with a teacher from Carolina and her 13-year old son.  I fixed a pizza for dinner, talked to her awhile and ate some cookies and an ice cream sandwich and I’ve been updating this journal ever since.  I finally crashed around 11:00.  Early morning.  Taft’s taking me back to the trail at 8:00.So, 321 miles down now and 150 to go. I have a 22-mile hike today and then a shirt 3-mile ride into Erwin, TN where I’ll take a zero tomorrow, then back out on the trail on Saturday!","Jerry Cabin Shelter

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595000,"After back-to-back 20+ mile days today would make the third and I was looking forward to Erwin, TN. a hotel and a zero day.
The title of this chapter has recurred to me time and time again during my hike, particularly when I was plowing along to a given destination.  The title is that of a book by one of my favorites, Richard Brautigan, who I mentioned earlier.  
Fitting that I was heading to Erwin, TN and “The Desert Fox” Rommel’s first name was Erwin.
So I had talked with Taft, the hostel owner and shuttle driver, about a ride back to the trailhead in the morning and Taft said he could take me at 8:00am. I had really preferred something around 6:30am but I wasn’t going to complain.  So, at least I’d have a little more time in the morning but it would mean pushing all day to get into Erwin by nightfall.
So I got up at 6:30am and caught up more of the journal.  Then I repacked all my stuff and had six of those little donuts for breakfast. I good 500 calories before starting out. Taft showed up a little after 8:00 and we were off.  On the way he saw a wild turkey but I missed it.  I told Taft about the one I’d seen and the grouse and how loud they can be and startling.  He said he can’t hunt them anymore because of that.  So 20 minutes later we were at my drop off and I bid Taft fairwell and thanks for the stay and ride.  We did see another turkey before he dropped me off.
I had a 1/2 mile walk up the gravel and stone road just to get back to the trail.  So I took my time and got my legs and feet loosened up for the long uphill climb coming up.  
Big Bald, a huge meadow on top of the mountain, a popular spot for locals and tourists alike, with great views all around.  For me it would be a 4-1/2 mile trek up 1200 feet, some steep and other areas relatively flat.  Rumor has it that the mountain was once home to a hermit who was spurned by his love and spent out his days living in a cave up there.
So with 22-miles to go to Erwin, I looked forward to putting Big Bald behind me, the toughest of my 6 climbs today and my first.  I looked forward to the views, mind you, I just wanted to get the climb behind me. Some of it was open pasture or tall grass and I thought of what the Blue Ticl owner had said about rattlesnakes.  I never saw any though.  
It seemed to take forever to get to the top or even the clearing of Big Bald!  I kept looking at my Runkeeper app and my elevation chart thinking, ok, around the next turn I should be out of the woods only to continue on into wooded trail and eventually a boulder field.  Finally!  Nope, more winding forest trail after that.  I was that only one on the trail too.  I had not seen anyone else yet.  I could tell it was overcast because it was cold, damp air and foggy. I thought, I’m gonna get up there and there won’t be a view because of the fog.  I was also hoping the rain would hold off for most if not all of the day.
By the time I got to the clearing of Big Bald, I almost couldn’t believe it.  I finally arrived.  Just as unbelievable was the vastness of it all, and I was only looking at a small portion of it.  Low growth grassland meadow for as far as you could see. Which wasn’t far because of the fog.  Due to the wind, cold and slight rain, it reminded me of the mountains in Scotland.  I almost had to put long pants and a jacket on but just decided to walk faster and not dilly-dally too long.  What was really cool as well to me was that there was no other sign of like except for a bird or two.  I had the entire Big Bald to myself.  I stopped for my 5-mile pack break and to grab something quick to eat and down some electrolyte and water.  After about 5 minutes I headed north along the trail and back into the woods that I thought would take me down the north side of Big Bald and out onto the lower elevation trail.  In this area I heard something through the trees 20 yards away and saw a deer frozen and looking at me.  I was able to ease my camera out and get a photo as it turned and walked away from me.  Surprising to me but I went through a narrow wooded area and out onto another Bald, bigger than the first, and on this side the skies were clearing.  I could see the trail wind up and over another part of the Bald probably 1/4 mile away.  This side reminded me of the mountain scene in The Sound of Music, but I wasn’t about to start singing and traipsing around, being alone or not.  I did think about it briefly.  All in all the hike over Big Bald was well worth the climb up it.  
With Big Bald behind me now I could look forward to it’s smaller neighbor, Little Bald, and and a two mile descent into Whisling Gap.  Little Bald was disappointing in that I could myself hiking mainly through woods and never did find a Bald.  Maybe it really was little.  I also had rain threatening and was trying to get along as fast as I could.  I passed one guy going solo south and two men, a lady and a German Shepherd also going south.  Other than them, I still hadn’t seen anyone. 
So the trail from Little Bald winds down about four miles into Spivey Gap, about my halfway point.  Three of my six climbs behind me and only a 500 and two 300 foot climbs left besides the usual little ups and downs.  At Spivey Gap it started to rain and it cooled off a lot and got dark.  At first the rain was light, barely penetrating the trees so it felt great for hiking and I could cruise along.  The rain picked up though but despite that I was still fine because the trail hugged the side of the mountain and I was under a tropical awning for about a mile.  Then the rain just got too heavy and I lost my awning so I had to don my pack cover and poncho.
Fortunately, the rain didn’t get inside my Salomons like on other days so my feet stayed mainly dry and I could still pick up the pace through the rain with 10 miles to go.  The trail was in good condition with little precarious or boulder areas and I had little slowing me down.  The rain also felt good and I could power up all my remaining climbs without stopping.  That felt good.  Like a high school workout again.  
By the time I got to Temple Hill, the last hill of the day, I was 3-miles to the Nolichucky River and Uncle Johnny’s, the hostel at the base of thebAT junction.  So  I took advantage of the high spot on the hill to call the Super 8 where I’d be staying to send a shuttle for me.  I was told them I was three miles out, it was 6:15pm, and I’d be at Uncle Johnny’s at 7:30pm.  
Oh, just before all this about 50 yards back, I don’t know why but I glanced up the hill to my left (the left bank went up, the right side was a downhill bank) and there 30 feet away looking at me was a bear!  It was too big to be a cub so I suspected a female.  She looked at me and I stopped and looked at her.  I still had my poncho on but I slowly reached for my I-phone camera under the poncho on my left sleeve.  I knew if I went to fast I’d startle her and she’d bolt.  My bear spray was under my poncho on my right front pack strap but the way she was acting, she didn’t display nervousness or fear but seemed inquisitive.  She took two steps to the left and put an 18” thick tree between her and I, and again stood there looking at me from around the tree.  I just held my ground, looked at her facing her, and was still trying to ease my phone out without making any quick or noisy moves.  I never got it out as she I guess assumed me as no threat and turned and walked on up the hill and into the woods.  Drat!! No photo op!! 
So after arranging for the shuttle I took off down the hill almost trotting in some places.  The rain had stopped but I still had my poncho on in case it started again.  I just threw the left side up over my shoulder so my I-phone was free and so my legs weren’t hampered by the poncho.  I had to average 25-minute miles to be at the bottom by 7:30 and I don’t like keeping the drivers waiting.  Plus it was a challenge.  Every 1/2 mile Brigette would tell me how I’m doing.  I could finally hear the interstate traffic and the river itself but I could see neither through the trees.  Finally I could see the town and it looked so far away and my watch and mileage calculations had me within a mile and it was 7:10.  Will I make it?  I went faster and my Salomons didn’t let me down.  Overall I felt, not like I had done 22-miles already that day.  So finally I heard people and saw the low rooftops and knew I was very close.  Garmin time, 7:28, I’m gonna make it!  I got to the road and walked the 40 yards over to Uncle Johnny’s Hostel just Bessie the trail and adjacent road, and a guy was talking to a lady out front.  As I walked up he said, are you Tim?  I said I am.  He said, I’m Doug, your driver.  I looked at my Garmin and it said 7:30.  I said, we’re both right on time.Beaides running shuttle, Doug was a herpetologist.  He started talking to me all about the Timber, or Canebreak, rattlers all the way to the hotel.  It was fascinating.  He said he goes out in the wild capturing and studying them and setting the back out.  He has caught the same snake on more than one occasion in subsequent years and can tell by the snake’s particular marking patterns, like a fingerprint, and by any scars it may have.  He showed me a ton of photos in front of the hotel and when I asked how big around they were, he showed me a few four foot long ones that he said were as fat as your wrist!!  How do you overlook that on a trail?  That’s not a moving twig or stick, that’s a small log moving along!  He said despite their reputation, Timber Rattlers are actually quite passive and will not strike unless feeling threatened and cornered.  He said he’s taken hundreds of photos and sat down right beside or in front of them (something I will not do) and that they will sit still or crawl over or around you but as long as you aren’t stepping on them or hitting them, they’ll just go about their business.  The photos showed off their irredescence so I guess they are sort of chameleon-like the way the light plays off of their scales.  Doug’s picking me up tomorrow morning to take me back to the trail so I’m sure we’ll talk more about the rattlers.So after Doug dropped me off and we talked it was 8:00, so I checked in and got cleaned up and took everything out of my pack, hanging up the wet stuff to dry and sorted my laundry for the morning.  I then called a local pizza place and had one delivered.  I was too tired now to go anywhere plus the nearest place was a couple tenths of a mile away.  So by the time I finished eating and looked over the rest of the trail it was 11:00 so I caught up on the National news and then crashed out for the night.So, at this point, 343.9 miles of AT plus the 8.8 of approach trail complete in 26 days.  126.2 miles to go in 11 days to get me to Damascus on July 3rd.  Today, Friday June 22 is a zero day in Erwin.  I’ll take another zero day in Elk Park, NCand my final zero day in Hampton, TN at mile 428.Hot Springs to Erwin was a three day stretch of 26.33, 21.14 and 22.82 miles totaling 70.29 miles.  I feel great and no major injuries or aches and pains.  I do have aches and pains, just not major.  Saturday I plan on going 20.1 to Iron Mountain Gap and then getting a ride to a nearby cabin.  Sunday I’ll slack pack 16 miles to Carver’s Gap and then get a ride back to the cabin.  On Monday I’ll go from  Carver’s Gap 14.8 miles to US-19E at Buck Creek and catch a shuttle the 2.5 miles into Elk Park. From there I’ll update and reassess the way forward but with 7 days to go I’ll have 75.3 miles to go and one more zero.All for now...","Street Gap Road

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595053,"I slept great and I slept in until 8:50am. My body felt a little stiff in the morning but after walking around the room I quickly worked out the kinks and felt great. I cleaned up the room and put all my stuff away.  I don’t like messy hotel rooms.  I got all my clothes together and did laundry.  While that was going I called Susan and we talked for a while.  I looked over my guide and tried to plan ahead better and narrowed some things down.  I decided I’d look at it further at lunch but I am roughly 50 miles from Elk Park and I’m not doing two 25-mile days so it looks like three days of something that combine to 50.So after laundry was done I folded that and put it away.  In my last box I received, I had put a small spray bottle of Permethrin (ticks and other insects hate it because it kills them) and another of ammonia water.  The ammonia water is to spray on my pack, mainly where the straps are and the backplate where I had sweat a lot, and also on my shoes and hammock.  For one, bears don’t like the smell of ammonia and two, it kills bacteria.  I sprayed some in my Salomons, my camp shoes and my ballcap.  I left all that to dry out in the sun through my room window and went to Plaza Azteca for lunch, about a 1.6-mile walk away.  The sun was shining and it was warm and felt great.  The walking without a pack load felt great too! I needed to get out and get the blood circulating and not just lie around a room all day.  At Azteca, I had an enchilada and taco and rice and beans and drank three beers while I worked on my plan for the next few days.  I also uploaded more photos to the journal site and updated the narrative as well.  Then I went next door to the Dollar Store and got a big bag of peanut M&Ms and some Epsom salts for later.  I walked on down the road heading back and stopped in a Food Lion for some ice cream.  I hadn’t had any for days it seemed like.  I got a half gallon of my favorite. Edy’s Double Fusge Brownie.  I also got a six-pack of Bud Light and a big bottle of V-8 juice for breakfast. So then I hurried back to the hotel before the ice cream melted.  Once back I worked out the details of the next few days.  So my itinerary going forward is:Saturday-Doug picks me up at 7:00am and takes me to the trail junction.  I hike 20.1 miles to Iron Mountain Gap. Once there, a shuttle driver from Black Bear Resort 20-miles away will pick me up and take me to a streamside private cabin at the Resort.Sunday-the shuttle driver will take me back to Iron Mountain Gap and drop me off.  I’ll leave most of my gear at the Resort and slack pack 16.0 miles to Carver’s Gap.  The shuttle driver will pick me up that afternoon and take me back to the Resort.Monday-the shuttle driver will take me back to Carver’s Gap and I’ll hike 14.8 miles to US19E.  I have ‘t decided if I’ll do another night at the same Resort, but if I do Monday would also be a slack pack day.  If not, I’ll have my full pack and will figure out where to stay either Sunday or Monday.  While at Black Bear Resort I’ll sit with the owners, who are very familiar with the AT in this area through Damascus, and work out a plan for the final days.After I got all that sorted out, I walked to Bojangles and got a chicken dinner and called Susan again on the way there.  I read more of The Epic of Gilgamesh over dinner. On the way back I called Charlie Doss and he, Terry and Susan are coming to Damascus to meet me, celebrate the 4th of July in Damascus, and I’ll ride home on the 5th of July with them.So I’m my room once again I re-treated my stuff with Permethrin and Ammonia water.  Then I ate 1/2 the half-gallon of ice cream and I’ll save some of the rest for breakfast.  Not all of it though or I’ll feel terrible hiking.  I watched The Mountain Between Us on HBO, which just ended and I typed this.  It is 9:50pm now so I gotta repack my pack and get to bed.  Probably put something mindless on TV and watch the news to see what the weather will be like tomorrow.  So that ends another day.","Erwin, TN

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595169,"I started off my Saturday getting up at 5:30am and using the last of my Epsom salt on a hot bath.  I had already packed up most of my stuff the night before so I had very little prep to do before Doug picked me up at 7:00am.  All my gear was nice and dry.  I filled my electrolyte bottles and about 1/3 of a bottle (64oz) of fresh water.  I packed up the last of it and checked out and drank a couple cups of coffee and waited for Doug in the lobby.  Doug showed up right on time.
We drove the short distance back to the AT where he had picked me up, near Uncle Johnny's, and Doug talked to me the whole way about snakes and hunting and growing up in South Dakota (his father was a WWII/Korean War/Vietnam War USAF guy).  As I was getting my stuff out of Doug's car, it began to rain, and it rained pretty hard.  So, at 7:30am, I started my 20-mile leg in my poncho.
So I crossed the bridge over the Nolichucky River, stopping to take a few quick photos which I'll add later, and moved on.  My guide showed the trail being relatively flat and a slight up for a few miles which worked for me because I like getting the blood flowing and working the kinks out before larger climbs first thing in the morning.
By the time I took my first scheduled liquid break at the 5-mile mark, I'd been making good time and stopped several times only to take photos of some interesting plants, some unique areas of the trail and more critters.  Saw and photographed another box turtle, for example, and another rabbit eating grass at the Curley Maple Gap Shelter.  
I had wanted to get to Iron Mountain by 5:30pm so I knew I needed to average 30 minute/miles which was usually achievable for me, even with all the breaks for water, food and photos.  At 5-miles I was still on schedule.  My 1st break was only a minute or two to take fluids and get the pack off my back and I was soon on my way again.  
At around the 6-1/2 mile mark, I ran across the only other people I'd see that day on the trail, 2 men and a woman, heading south to Uncle Johnny's.  I stopped and moved to the side of the trail so they could get by and the lead guy saw my USS Lapon ballcap and commented.  He was a retired Navy aviation Master Chief.  I should have gotten a photo with him but forgot.  He had hair a lot longer than mine with braids in it and wore a cowboy-type hat with his Master Chief pin right in the middle front.  They were on a 4-day excursion.  We talked about the service for a few seconds and then both went on our way.
I passed several small waterfalls and streams as I went up the lower reaches of Unaka Mountain.  It was a low-grade ascent from my start to the mountain peak at mile 13-1/2.  Time was passing quickly and before I knew it I was approaching my 10-mile point ahead of time.  At 10 I took an extended break to rest my pack (yes, it needs rest), eat a Pro Bar and take in more fluids. The rain had stopped several hours prior at around 9:00 and it drizzled and/or fell from the trees until around 10:00am.  So I took off my poncho and pack cover.  My 10-mile break lasted about 15 minutes and I was now behind time-wise but not by much.  I knew I'd make it up if nowhere else, on the north downside of Unaka Mountain.  
I wasn't looking forward to the steepest climb of the day, the 1.6 mile, 1000 foot climb up Unaka.  By the time I got there though at mile 12, I didn't even realize I'd started the climb and by the time I did I just kept motoring away and felt great.  I was able to get all the way to the top and beyond without stopping or even pausing, something I could not have done three weeks earlier.  At the top of Unaka was a camp clearing and on the left side of the clearing was a Fir tree someone or several someones had decorated with Christmas ornaments.  I took a photo.  The entire top of Unaka was sparse with trees and if it hadn't been for the periodic white blazes, it would have been very difficult to follow the trail.  
I finally started making my way down and was thankful the rain had held off the rest of the day.  I did get some great photos at various clearings that showed towns both far and near as well as the endless mountain chains receding into the horizon.  The earth really is round and not flat.  
So the north side of Unaka ends at Low Gap, go figure, and from that low point immediately rises up and over a little 300 foot hill and then into Cherry Gap Shelter at mile 17.  From the little hill prior I called the Black Bear Resort to arrange for my shuttle pick-up.  I told Mary I was 4-miles out, it was 3:30, and I'd be there at Iron Mountain Gap and the NC226/TN107 road at 5:15pm.  I knew I was pushing it but I needed the challenge and I was feeling good.  So after taking the last of my fluids I set off.
I covered the last three miles, mainly low-grade downs and flats with some short uphills in under an hour and 4 minutes and got to the rendezvous point at 5:05pm.  Bob was waiting for me.  He said he was surprised I was so early and that he had just gotten there and thought he had time to read some.  I was pleased with today's effort and covered the 20.18 miles in 9 hours and 28 minutes.  
So we left for the 1/2 hour drive to his Resort and Bob asked about my background.  Tell me about yourself, he said.  So I gave him my bio dump and as I related my service background he told me he was retired Air Force.  they still had a place in Cape Canaveral they wintered at.  
We got to the Resort and I checked in with his daughter Stephanie and bought a few groceries for my cabin.  I was going to be in a streamside cabin all to my self for my stay.  Bob and his wife had said that theoretically I could stay there for the rest of my trip to Damascus.  We had discussed on the phone my planning that out with them once I got to the Resort and could study the larger geographical map that showed not only the AT but the intersecting roads that would allow for easy shuttle pick-up.  Once I got my meager groceries and key I went to my cabin to drop off my stuff and get cleaned up.  First I called Susan to let her know I had arrived and all was well.  I had no cell service but there is a phone on the front porch of the office for short-term use so I called from there.  There is also a laptop in the Resort common area which also has games, DVDs and a microwave and is available for all guests to use.  So, I'm using the laptop now to update the journal.  I'll probably be able to upload photos once I direct link between my phone and the laptop via the USB port.  So my cabin is just a three-room which is fine by me.  I have a bathroom with shower, a bedroom and a great room with a kitchen sink and cupboards at one end, a two-burner gizmo that I have to plug in to cook on, a microwave, a refrigerator and a toaster oven.  The other side of the room has a futon, a table with lamp, a coffee table and a TV with DVD player.  I don't have TV channels, just the DVD player, but that's ok, I have my books, besides The Epic Of Gilgamesh I have A Singular Man by JP Donleavy.  Mike Ellis had turned my on to Donleavy years ago, an Irish novelist best known for The Ginger Man.  So in my cabin I watched Eurotrip, some mindless comedy, and fixed one of my Ramen soups for dinner.  I also had a cheeseburger and drank two Bud Lights, two Diet Cokes and two Powerades.  For desert I ate all my Peanut M&Ms, a big 1 pound bag.  After all that I planned out the rest of my 106 mile journey into Damascus and from what I can tell it does look like I'll be able to stay here the entire time.  The benefits of that are that I have a familiar place to look forward to each evening, I can slack pack, and I have a reliable shuttle driver to pick me up and drop me off.  So, that's what I'll do.I ended up going to bed around 10:00 and read for a while and almost finished my LA Times crossword.I set my alarm for 6:30am and tomorrow Bob takes me at 8:00am back to Iron Mountain Gap for my 16-mile leg to Carver's Gap.","Erwin, TN

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595172,"Well, I got woken up around 3:00am by a tremendous thunderstorm.  This continued on and off, mainly on, until I got up at 6:30am.  I assessed the situation and at 7:00am made the determination that I had enough short mile days and two zero days added in to my remaining journey that I would switch things around and take a zero day to day.  In my younger days I would have thrown caution to the wind and went for it but I think I may be a little wiser and more prudent in my older age and besides, its my decision and I made it.  If it had just been the rain, maybe, but with the lightning and thunder I decided to not go.  
So I got cleaned up and went to the common room to use the computer and check on the weather and update my journal.  I couldn't log on so now I'd have to wait for Bob and Mary to arrive to figure out how to get on.  In the meantime, I cleaned up the common area and a couple of the women came in who were going to be shuttled with me to a different starting point.  I told them I had decided to zero it but they said they were still going because they only had so many days to get their 60+ mile hike done.
Bob and Mary showed up right before 8:00am and I told Bob I was taking the zero.  They both said they thought the rainstorm would pass and that the day would be nice but I told them I had already gotten into the zero day mindset.  Besides, I explained, I had plenty to bank.  Anyhow, the weather predictions had been wrong before in the mountains and besides that, there was no way of predicting how the heavy rains would affect the trail in the mountains and the gaps.  I didn't want to get out there for what had been planned as a 16-mile day and regret my decision.  I was content with the dryness and warmth of my cabin and I'd just catch up on reading, DVDs, the New York Times crossword and letting my body recover even more.  I'd shift the schedule around and do the 16-miler tomorrow.  I went over the rest of my plan to Damascus with Mary and Bob and referencing the larger wall map they had in the office. Bob had some slight change suggestions and I concurred and that was that.  
So now it's 9:50am and I've caught all this up.  I'm going to call Susan and tell her what's up.  I have some DVDs picked out so I'm going to relax and I'll come back to the computer later and add my photos if it allows me and wrap up the day's journal later tonight with my next few days' plans.Mary told me that Stephanie, her daughter, was going to a hairdresser at Wal-Mart and she'd take me if I wanted since I had asked how close town was from the Resort and had asked about fresh fruit and vegetables.  So I went with Stephanie and her three kids.  I shopped around for groceries while she got her hair done.  With 9 days at the Resort planned, I bought a lot but I was also limited by the small refrigerator and freezer I had.  Still, I walked out with about 6 bags after having spent $125.When we got back, I got everything to fit.  I actually took a photo of it all crammed into the refrigerator.  I fixed myself some lunch, it was now 1:00, and ate that while watching a DVD, Vacancy, I think it was.  I spent the rest of Sunday afternoon reading in both of my books, working on both the LA Times and New York Times Sunday crosswords from May 6th, watching two more DVDs, Cruel Intentions and Man on Fire (I only have about 50 DVDs here to choose from), drying my hiking clothes out in the sun and re-arranging the cupboards in the kitchen area.  It turned out to be a nice sunny day and maybe I should stuck with my original hiking plan but I didn't, and no changing that.  Just have to do it tomorrow regardless of the weather.I ended up going to bed at 9:30 and reading some more and then out. By the way, I forgot to mention that yesterday late in the hike I heard a ""baby"" cry out, once, to my left and in the distance.  Well, I knew what that was, and it was no baby...","Black Bear Resort

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595374,"I slept great and got up before my alarm at 6:00am.  I ate some Pop Tarts, a grapefruit and a banana for breakfast and got my things together.  With slack packing, it was a lot faster and easier to pack.  I had filtered water and prepped my electrolyte solutions the night before and put them in the refrigerator so they were cold.  The leftover water was just that in a separate bottle in my pack.  The only other things I carried was the dirty water bottle and filter, a windbreaker in case it got cold, and it does, my poncho and pack cover, bandana, beef jerky, a packet of Pro Bar power gels, my mini-Leatherman, a small notebook & pen, my wallet, my phone charger and I-phone and my cabin key.  That's it.  In all, my pack weight goes from 30-34 pounds depending on the amount of liquids I'm carrying to 13 pounds on slack pack days and that includes the fluids.  Big difference, obviously.
So I checked the weather, and that looked good, and tried to upload some photos to the journal.  The computer is slow so I was limited in what I could do.
At 8:00am Bob arrived to drive me to Iron Mountain Gap for today's 16 mile hike.  This would be the longest of my remaining day's hikes.  We got there and I was off at 8:40am.  I was making great time through the woods for 5-miles with really nothing to stop and see except for the occasional plant or strange growth.  I was hoping to see a bear or two early in the morning but I didn't see or hear any.  There were a lot of people on the trail for a Monday, as compared to Saturday.  I passed small groups of 1 and 2 people along the way.
At 5-miles, I stopped for fluids and to look at my elevation chart.  I was about to go up a little to Little Rock Knob.  Not much of an elevation change, only about 800 feet over 2 miles.  From there the trail winds down into Hughes Gap and then a long 4-mile ascent up Roan Mountain, about 2000 feet over that distance.  I was making great time, about 22-minutes/mile, and I knew I'd have to call Bob from atop Roan Mountain and tell him I'd be earlier than the 4:00-4:30pm I had predicted for pick-up at Carver's Gap.  The pack being 20-pounds lighter was making a big difference, and it got lighter every 5-miles as I drank the fluids and ate my jerky and power gels.  
As I was going up the southern base of Roan Mountain, I passed 2 guys heading north and shortly thereafter about 6 guys also heading north who had stopped for a break.  I picked up the pace to get some separation because the pair had been talking constantly and I thought the group of six would be as well when they got started again.  I have nothing against talking, but in the woods, if you want to see bears or any wildlife for that matter, you can't talk or be around anyone who is.  So I got the needed separation and slowed back into my normal pace.  By then I was halfway up Roan Mountain and encountered about 20 Boy Scouts all spread out over about 1/4 mile of the trail.  They were heading to Ash Gap to camp.  Once I got by them the only other person I encountered the rest of the hike was an elderly lady going up Roan Mountain on her own. I was going a lot faster than her and didn't want to startle her so I tried making a little noise as I approached from behind her.  That didn't work and as I was right behind her, I said excuse me or something and scared her anyhow.  
The top of Roan is a popular tourist area as there is a meadow and you can see 360 degrees around.  There is a parking lot 1.6 miles below and people can walk up.  I called Bob from the top of Roan, now only 2.5 miles from Carver's Gap, and told him I'd be there by 3:45pm.  After the call I drank the last of my fluids and headed down the mountain.  It was very rocky most of the way but it didn't bother my at all.  As I neared what I thought was the last 3/4 mile, I came out on a road with no trail or white blazes in sight.  I looked around for about thirty seconds and then backtracked looking for the white blazes on the trees.  Finally, 200 yards back up the trail, I saw a white blaze on a side trail.  I looked north and saw 2 white blazes on a tree on the trail I was on.  This is mismarked, I thought.  The double blazes are supposed to tell you to turn one way or the other based on the top blaze being offset left or right.  If it is directly atop the bottom blaze, as this one was, it meant a trail junction and to go straight, which I did, only I was really supposed to take a left hairpin turn.  As I got on the right trail, the young couple from Maine I'd met several days before approached.  They were still on track doing their 17-miles a day and heading to Pennsylvania.  I led them through Carver's Gap and we talked along the way about the hike so far.  
I came out at Carver's Gap still 1/2 mile before I thought I should, but this was definitely the place.  I walked around a little to see if Bob was there early because it was only 3:25pm and I was way early.  I talked to a couple other hikers and we commented on the impending storm you could see approaching.  I was fortunate to be done for the day.  I took some photos and waited for Bob.  I called Susan but soon lost that call.  Then it started to rain lightly but Bob showed up right about then and we were off, headed back to the Resort.  
Another hiker, Paul, was with Bob.  Paul had arrived the day before and had taken a zero day.  He was heading south to Springer Gap.  It took about 40 minutes to drive back to the Resort so we talked about various things along the way.  Paul asked me if I'd seen any critters on the trail and I told him about the really neat orange lizards, three of them, I'd seen.  I saw and photographed the first one and then 1/10 of a mile later saw the second one and 50 yards later the third.  They were all about three inches long.  The first one was moving towards the grass along the edge of the trail, the second one was still on top of a rock and the third sat still along the trail.  When I got back to the Resort I got on the Internet and looked them up.  They are actually Eastern Red Spotted Newts and they secrete a poisonous toxin from their skin. Well, I knew enough about colorful critters, and plants, to not touch them so I suppose its a good thing I didn't touch the newts.  I'll put the photos up later when I have more time.  Bob and Mary took Stephanie and her three kids and Paul and me to a Mexican restaurant in Elizabethton.  It was Bob's favorite and it was margarita night.  I had a burrito supreme, which was huge, a margarita and a 32 oz. Bud Light.  That hit the spot.  after we came back I watched Sin City and fell asleep watching it.  I ended up going to bed at 10:00pm and looked forward to tomorrow's hike.","Iron Mountain Gap
",Carver's Gap,"Jun 25, Mon",15.56
TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595431,"I was working on the journal this morning when Bob showed up to drive me back to Carver's Gap for today's hike.  It was supposed to be cloudy in the morning and then be partly sunny/cloudy the rest of the day so I was looking forward to a rain-free and pleasant slack pack day.  that would be short-lived.
We saw a fawn cross the road in front of us when we were almost there and it was foggy in the mountains.  Hopefully the fog would clear because Bob said the views from Little Hump and Hump Mountains were fantastic.  When we got to Carver's Gap, there was still fog in the mountains and the temperature was mild.  I along Grassy Ridge and there were a lot of day hikers out.  Mainly people hoping for a clear day and anxious to get some photos in.  I took a few myself as I climbed the ridge bald before entering the woods above.  The fog/clouds would come and go so sometimes I had a good view and sometimes I didn't. 
Soon after entering the woods it began to rain.  So much for a cloudy/sunny rain-free day.  It started raining hard and I had to don the poncho and pack cover.  It rained for about an hour and then subsided but still no sun.  At that point I didn't run into anyone along the trail.  I did almost run into a large deer, female, it looked like, that was on the trail and we didn't notice each other until we were about 15 feet apart.  She deftly made her silent exit by leaping off the trail and disappeared into the foliage.  
Because of the rain from the past few days and today's morning rain there was no way to avoid the mud and slick rocks.  I pretty much decided my Salomon's were going to get muddy and wet so might as well take the direct route through it all.  
Bob had asked me to stop and get photos at Overmountain Shelter.  The shelter is about 2/10ths of a mile off of the main trail on a side blue blaze trail and apparently was used in several films.  It is also the site of a famous Revolutionary War Battle, the battle of Sycamore Shoals, in which the Virginians, North Carolinians and Tennesseans routed the British.  The barn was renovated in 1987.  So I stopped in and took a bunch of photos and talked briefly to two hikers who had spent the night there.After that I made my way on up Little Hump Mountain which has a huge bald on top.  Unfortunately, it was still foggy and I couldn't see anything except the trail in front of me and maybe 50 yards all around.  Down the north side and into Bradley Gap I went, the gap between the Little Hump and the regular Hump Mountains.  At least it wasn't raining.  I made my way up Hump Mountain and again visability was nil so down the north side and into the woods I went.  I called the Resort with 4-miles to go and Mary said it was storming there.  Not good.  It was still overcast where I was but it wasn't raining.  I suspected that might not last.  I told Mary I'd be ready for pick-up at US19E at 4:00pm, an hour and 40 minutes away.  About 20 minutes after I got started, the skies opened up and with the rain came lightning and thunder, the latter about one-second apart meaning this storm was right over me.  I was glad I wasn't on the bald of Hump Mountain for this and felt a little safer in the woods.  Still, I had to be aware of potentially falling trees and running into bears.  I picked up the pace in an effort to get to US19E as fast as I could.  On the way I came upon a guy who was confused as to where the trail went.  I asked him where he was going and he said Damascus.  I said, me too.  Where are you going tonight?   , I asked.  He didn't have a destination and was just hiking along until it got dark.  Well, I figure you gotta have a destination at least on paper, particularly in times like what we were then facing.  He was relying in me to get him back on the right trail and said he'd follow me out.  There were two dead-ends and the trail actually made a hairpin turn around a boulder.  I found the north trail after about 30 seconds and led on.  I didn't intend to wait for him or ""talk"" along the way, considering the storm around us, so I resumed my fast pace and I think he followed for about a minute but was soon in the distance behind me.  I soon passed another guy who had all his gear out under a tree.  It was all wet.  What the heck?  On the AT and no rain gear or dry bags?  I sped by him determined to get out of this storm and back to the Resort as fast as I could.  I was making great time and could finally hear the vehicles on US19E.  I came out of the woods and onto the road at 3:49pm.  It had stopped raining so I took off my poncho and shook it out and my pack and set it beside a guardrail while I checked mail and stuff on my I-phone waiting for Bob.  Bob and Paul (Paul took another zero day) showed up at 3:55pm and we were heading back to the Resort.  Once we got back I got two Diet Cokes, a pint of chocolate ice cream and two Bud Lights from the store and went off to do laundry.  I took a hot shower first, that felt great, and then I washed everything so I had to wear my poncho with a towel on underneath while it washed and dried.  I read and worked on the crossword puzzles, finishing the LA Times one, in the meantime.  So now my laundry's done and I've caught up this journal.  I'm still trying to upload the photos but the connection here is slow.  I'll add as I can.So, 75 more miles to Damascus and one more week!!","Carver's Gap

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595548,"I had dried all my gear last night, Salomon's in particular, by a space heater management had in my cabin.  I had it set on 92.  Yes, it got hot, but dry gear mattered more.  Plus, it worked.  In the morning, all my gear was very much dry.  I didn't let it run all night.  I actually turned the heater off around 10:30pm, when I finally crashed for the night.
This morning, I was up at 6:15am and ready to go.  This would be a very short day, 11.5 miles, considering what I'd done up to now, and I was looking forward to getting back to the Resort for a late lunch.  
For breakfast I ate 2 chocolate Pop Tarts, a bowl of fresh strawberries and blueberries I'd gotten from Wal-Mart on Sunday, some V-8 juice and a banana, all while reading the intro still to The Epic of Gilgamesh.  About the book.  Half of it, I'm on page 48, is the mythological and archeological history on the story, which is really a poem, so I haven't even gotten there yet!!  Will I remember all the background info?  Probably not, but, gotta read it anyway because it's in the book and that's how I read.  If it's between the covers, read it.  Anyhow, after breakfast and reading I was good to go.  
Bob showed up a little early and I didn't have a chance to check the weather on the computer.  No biggie, Bob seemed to know what it was supposed to do each day, I guess he watched the news prior to picking me up over morning coffee.  So Bob arrived about 7:45am and after getting coffee my self in the office, we left for US19E.  Today's hike, like I said, would be quick and easy.  A 11.5 mile hike with two climbs.  One out of the gate 1000 feet over two miles and the second starting at mile 6.5 and also going up 1000 feet but strung out over four miles.  What could go wrong?
Things started out great!  The sun was out, there were some benign clouds in the sky and Bob told me it was supposed to be clear all day with a chance of scattered showers late in the afternoon.  No big deal, I'd be back by 1:00pm.  So he dropped me off at 8:30am and I hit the trail straight-away.  I was feeling great and the initial climb didn't faze me at all.  After about a mile in on a narrow 2-foot wide portion of the trail I came around a blind left-hand turn and almost ran into a southbound fawn.  We were 10-feet apart.  It looked at me and I looked at it as I moved slowly to the inside of the turn to let it pass if it wanted, all while reaching for my I-phone really slowly.  It thought for a couple seconds, max, and then decided no, I'm going back the way I came, and it was gone.  Sorry, no photo.  It was a neat experience anyhow.  So I continued on full of energy.  I soon reached the top of the first hill which doesn't have a name, about 1.8 miles in.  I was in a bald between mountains and the views were great on both sides!  I took several photos including a really good one of Little Hump and Hump from the day before.  It was hard to realize that I ha just climbed those yesterday.  They seemed so far off.  They looked grand from my perspective.  I identified them by an app I have on my I-phone, I should have used it more, for identifying mountains.  Hell, there's an app for everything now-a-days.  We could have used something like that on submarines, just point your I-phone at an ocean disturbance and it says, oh, that's shrimp or oh, that's a Soviet Akula-Class submarine.  
Anyhow, I continued on and still hadn't seen any other people.  so down the other side of the hill I went and back into the woods.  Shortly thereafter I did catch up to another northbound hiker and he let me pass and we really didn't say much other than the, what had become normal trail lingo, have a nice hike.  Right after that I came upon a cemetery.  Now when I say cemetery, I don't mean a private burial plot for family members from back in the 1800's or something.  No, a modern well-kept cemetery, with like a couple of hundred life-long members, with a chain-link fence around it and manicured grounds.  OK, this would have freaked me out but I don't get freaked out.  Plus, I read the AT guide and knew there was Isaacs Cemetery out here somewhere.  Still, it was pretty cool, a cemetery in the middle of nowhere, or the Tennessee woods on the Appalachian Trail deep in the Cherokee National Forest!  So what gives?  I don't know, I'll let someone else figure that one out and let me know.  There is a Southern Baptist Church about another 1/3 of a mile further along the trail so maybe they are connected. 
So I continued on, not wanting to spend a lot of time studying headstones in the cemetery.  My downhill was long, a little over 3-miles, into Sugar Hollow Stream, but very fulfilling.  Just prior to Sugar Hollow, I took a blue blaze side trail that the guide suggested to Jones Falls, about 1/10 of a mile off of the main AT.  Was it worth it?  Oh yeah!  A fantastic waterfall in the middle of the woods.  You could hear it for hundreds of yards in any direction.  There was a group of kids there with a few adults and one of them offered to take my picture with the falls as a backdrop so I'll try and get that posted.  They were really amazing falls.  I didn't stay long and said my goodbyes and hit the AT again.
Soon I came to Sugar Hollow and had to make the 4-mile ascent out of the hollow to Walnut Mountain.  There wasn't much to see but forest trail with a lot of foliage so I could really push it and turn the 11-mile hike into a heavy cardio workout which I did.  At this point I was averaging about 24 minutes a mile, including the stops for photos and I knew I could go faster.  The trail was mainly dirt so no rocks or roots.  Even the uphills were short and I could power up them pretty easily.  Things were going great!  
I had planned on calling Bob with three-miles to go and let him know what time to pick me up from Howard Harrison Road, an old forestry fire road that intersected the trail, according to the guide I was looking at.  So at 11:20am I call in and tell Stephanie I'll be there at 1:00pm.  Perfect, a 30-minute drive back and I'll be showered and eating a nice lunch by 1:45.  So I hang up and power on now determined to beat Bob to the pick-up point, something he'd gotten used to and that now he was trying to beat me there, no that I fudged my pick-up time or anything (and I didn't, I just went all out each time).  So things are going well and Brigette is matching well with the mile markers the guide has. I hit Walnut Mountain Road right on time and on mileage and I pause to look and I've only got 1.3 miles to go to Howard Harrison Road.  What's really good is its only 12:20 and I've been averaging just under 23 minute miles and dropping.  I'm gonna get there before 1:00pm!  About 30 minutes later it gets noticeably dark on the trail and I think, uh-oh!  Rain is coming!  So I look at my Runkeeper and I think, I've only got less than 1/2 mile to go, I don't need to don raingear, I can make it.  So at first, as usual, it starts sort of easy and the trees up above catch most of it.  So I'm picking up the pace, nearly running now, as it gets harder and harder.  Soon I pass where the road should be and there is no road.  Now what?  Well, either my GPS/Runkeeper is off or the guide is off.  The road is just around the next bend.  So instead of putting on the raingear, I power on even faster.  I hear Runkeeper update and my average pace is falling as I go, 23:54, 23:48, 23:30, 23:05...I go an other 1/2 mile then another 1/2 mile and still no road!  What the hell!  am I lost?  Can't be, I'm a navigational guy PLUS, I'm still on the AT, the road is lost, not me.  It's gotta be just ahead.  So I look at my watch and it's 1:00.  Bob will wait.  I'm not due until 1:00 but he knows it's raining and he'll just gloat that he beat me this time.  I'm soaked and so is the pack but there's nothing important in it to get wet, my filtration system and my water bottles, plus my rain gear and a windbreaker, big deal.  Anyhow, my pack needed cleaning, it was starting to smell.  So I figured, the road's not there.  Now what?  Go back to the known road at Walnut Mountain?  or press forward?  Always forward.  That didn't take much thought.  I knew a shelter or some sign would appear on the trail eventually so I just powered on.  Eventually I came to a sign over a stream and it said, YOU SHOULD HAVE TAKEN A ZERO DAY.  No, really it said, Upper Laurel Fork.  Great!  I knew where that was.  So I broke out my guide page and saw that I was past the pick-up point by a mile, but then I looked at a different page of the same guide and noticed that it didn't mention this Howard Harrison Road, but it did mention a USFS 293 at ""Bitter End"".  I recalled that Bob kept referring to Harrison Road as 293 and then it clicked.  The guide had ambiguous information on the same road!  So where was the fire road?  another 8/10ths of a mile ahead.  So I looked at my watch and it was 1:14.  Bob will wait.  I tried to call Stephanie at the Resort but I had no service.  No time to waste just go for it, so no I was running and walking really fast, fortunately I was slack packing so I only had a 15-pound load.  Just before getting to the road I heard a vehicle go by but I couldn't see it. I came out on a gravel road and no van.
It's now 1:35pm.  So I look east and quickly disqualify that as the direction I'm going because the road narrowed and seemed to go uphill to nowhere.  The road to the west was as broad and graveled as where I was standing so I went that way, plus, it just seemed right from what I was factoring in my head.  
So I go a couple hundred yards down the road and I see houses.  Good sign.  As I pass the first I see a guy out front so I ask him if this is USFS 293/Howard Harrison Road and he says yes.  Great!  Right road, back on track.  He says, have you seen a white dog?  I said, yes, right across the street up that dirt driveway.  He says, not that dog, my other dog.  I said, well, he isn't on the southern portion of the AT because I just came off that.  I still had no cell service so I asked him about it.  He said go up to the stop sign at the end of Harrison Road and you should have service.  So I walk up there in the pouring rain, can't get any wetter, and it's about 2/10ths of a mile walk.  So I get a bar and try to call Stephanie but the call drops.  So I go north up the state road about 1/10th of a mile in front of a house and try calling.  I get through but the call keeps dropping like 6 times, so I'm not sure how much Stephanie get.  At least she knows I'm still alive. So I decide to go south on the main road since there is a little rise about 1/10th of a mile past Harrison Road.  I get up there and I've got two bars.  Great!  So I call Stephanie and the same result.  Then I remember that I have Mary's cell phone number so I try to text her where I am, knowing that texts require less signal than calls.  Now I can't type because my screen is wet and I have nothing dry to wipe it with.  I try over and over and finally get some abbreviated version of I'm in front of 399 Old Buck Mountain Rd (I'd gotten the address off of the mailbox of the house I was in front of) and 1/10th of a mile from Harrison Road.  So I walked back down to Harrison Road and about the time I get there my phone rings.  I answer and it's Bob but the call is garbled.   So I keep repeating that I am at Harrison Road, I'm at Harrison Road and the call drops.  So I go back up the state road to the north hoping to get a better signal and as I'm calling him back, I see his van coming north on the state road so I start walking that way and waving my hands and he turns onto Harrison Road!  Crap!  He didn't see me!  It's still broad daylight and he didn't see me from 125 yards away.  So, I start walking down Harrison Road knowing he has to come out this way.  I'm thinking, I hope he doesn't go down there and park.  I don't want to walk all the way back down there.  I've already walked 13.4 miles today and that's almost 2 more than I was supposed to walk and I'm cold, wet and tired.  So I get halfway down Harrison and here he comes.
I get in and I'm not mad, I'm not anything, really.  I say, well, chalk this up to a misadventure, part of the overall AT adventure...
More to follow.  Gotta go eat for the first time today and it's 9:00pm... So now that I've eaten, to finish off this day's journal...So in the van besides Bob is Brian, an Army veteran counterintelligence officer out of Fort Campbell, KY.  Brian was on the AT but quit and Bob happened by and picked him up.  Brian needed a ride to Greasy Road Hostel where his car was and he was driving back to Kentucky.  So we are following Bob's GPS and it takes us the wrong way so now we are temporarily lost trying to get to the hostel.  I can't help Bob out because I have no cell service where we are.  Finally I do get cell service and give Bob directions until he gets close and finally his GPS gets us there, about an hour out of our way and 20+ miles further than we thought.  So after dropping Brian off, we end up with a 45-minute, 25 mile drive back to the Resort.  All I know is I'm wet, cold, tired and hungry and all I want to do is get back, get a shower and eat.  We finally make it back around 4:15pm.  So much for 1:30pm and a nice lunch.  So I get my shower and set out my stuff to dry in front of the heater in the cabin (some of it is still there drying out 6 hours later).  I caught up the journal and finally got something to eat.  I watched Lady's Man tonight, the pickings are getting slim.  Tomorrow should be easier.  Since I went two miles further today, tomorrow should be around a 9-miler and it ends about 1/2 mile up the road from the Resort so I'll walk back. So ends another day.  Again, I'll upload photos as I can.  Sorry for the delay in that.Less than 63 miles to go to Damascus!!","US19E
",Howard Harrison Road,"Jun 27, Wed",11.50
TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595628,"I awoke at 6:20am this morning and all my gear was dry, once again.  I had 2 chocolate Pop Tarts, a banana, a bowl of strawberries and blueberries and a glass of V-8 juice for breakfast.  All health, especially the pop Tarts.  I got all my gear together but opted to not take my windbreaker or water filter and dirty bottle.  I hadn't drank hardly any of my fluids yesterday so I went mainly with the (2) 16-ounce electrolyte bottles and the 64-ounce clean water bottle 1/3 full.  That should cover me just fine for the 11.1 mile hike today.  
Today's section wasn't particularly difficult either.  it was mainly flat for the first 3-miles and then gradually rose about 500 feet tp Moreland Gap Shelter and then a little more to White Rocks Mountain.  From there it took a dip then a last little 200 foot climb before descending into Dennis Cove.  Dennis Cove, come to find out from Bob, is named after the guy who used to own all this land.  There is no ""cove"" here, at least not in the watery sense, but the term ""cove"" means a low area between two mountains.  I had not known that and apparently Bob had not either until he looked it up.  
Bob and Mary Lee were going to visit their son who was in town and nearby.  So they drove me this morning back to the ""now dreaded"" Howard Harrison Road.  at 8:50am I started today's hike from there.  weather reports didn't indicate any rain but it was supposed to be cloudy all day.  Well, I was prepared for rain nonetheless and already had my pack cover on and my poncho was out of it's mesh bag and tucked in between the top of my pack and my back for quick retrieval.  A thick fog blanketed everything and visibility was probably about 75 yards, if that, for nearly all the hike, hence the name of today's hike.  I don't know why, but Hound of the Baskervilles came to me while I was hiking.  
Mary Lee and Bob had been concerned about Paul, the former US Marine and hiker who had zeroed two days with them and set off yesterday going south, hoping to make Springer Mountain.  Paul was ill-prepared for the hike, having little money and not the proper gear.  His clothes were cotton, which tends to trap moisture and is hard to dry, he was carrying an ax, a Maglite (which is heavy) and apparently 45 pounds (trimmed down from 90) of mostly useless stuff.  Bob and Mary Lee suspected Paul may have sheltered over at Moreland Gap Shelter after leaving their Resort on Wednesday morning.  Moreland Gap is only 6.5 miles along the trail, but they felt since Paul hated the rain so much he may have stopped there.  In any event, he had not passed me yet and since I was going north and he south, we should cross unless he continued on after I left the trail at 1:35pm yesterday.  I told Mary Lee and Bob I'd keep an eye out for him.I hadn't seen anyone all morning on the trail, or anything, for that matter.  Today's hike was looking to be a walk in the woods to Dennis Cove with no side story to speak of.  At 4.5 miles I came upon Moreland Gap Shelter and there was Paul.  I stopped to see how he was doing.  He had stopped there yesterday to wait out the rainstorm, as had many other hikers, according to Paul.  At this point, 11:00am, Paul was all alone and his clothes and all his gear was hanging in and around the shelter drying.  Paul said he was going to take another zero day there and dry his stuff out and then continue on.  I told him I didn't think his stuff would dry out because of the cold foggy air.  I suggested he get a fire started and maybe that would help dry some things out.  I also suggested he may want to backtrack the 6.5 miles to the Resort and regroup.  He said he was moving forward south and maybe he'd find a hostel near US19E.  I then suggested he go ahead and start hiking and find a laundromat near there to dry his things.  I told him I'd tell Stephanie, Bob and Mary Lee that he was OK, at least.So not much else happened the rest of my hike.  I passed one guy hiking solo and shortly after that two guys who had stopped to take photos.  At 1:25pm I came out of the woods at Dennis Cove and onto Dennis Cove Road.  So I walked the 1/2 mile to the resort and my hiking day was done.  I saw Stephanie and told her about Paul and bought some Bud Light.  I then got cleaned up, fixed a lunch of two big turkey and mustard sandwiches and had some Ruffles with that and some peanut M&Ms as a healthy dessert, as I watched Mel Brooke's Young Frankenstein.  I fell asleep as my gear dried in front of the heater (it wasn't that wet but damp from the moist air).  So now I've caught up the journal through 4:00pm today, I'll try and add some more photos.  As for the remainder of my trip, here's the updated agenda:Miles so far completed since May 27:  419.5Miles to go by July 3rd:  50.6Friday, June 29 leg:  Dennis Cove to Wilbur Dam Road - 13.0 miles, 37.6 miles to goSaturday, June 30 leg:  zero day at Black Bear ResortSunday, July 1 leg:  Wilbur Dam Road to TN 91 - 16.1 miles, 21.5 miles to goMonday, July 2 leg:  TN 91 to McQueen Gap - 10.2 miles, 11.3 miles to goTuesday, July 3 leg:  McQueen Gap to Damascus - 11.3 miles, done!I'm hoping to get started on that last leg by 9:00am.  That would put me in Damascus by 1:30pm Tuesday afternoon, to meet Susan and Charlie and Terry Doss, who are driving from Virginia Beach.  Russell Riggs is supposed to be joining me along the trail somewhere near the end to hike along some.  Well, that about does it for today.  I'll update anything that occurs today after 5:40pm (now) and when I go to bed...","Howard Harrison Road
",Dennis Cove,"Jun 28, Thu",11.04
TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595793,"Today I got started early because I was starting off from Dennis Cove, 1/2 mile from the Resort, so I wasn't reliant on Bob shuttling me and I could take off as early as I wanted.  So I got up at 5:15am, ate breakfast of chocolate Pop Tarts again, plus the last of my blueberries and a banana, packed my meager things and at 6:20am I was off.  I originally had a 13.0 mile day planned, but that got lengthened.  Not by choice, but as you read you'll find out why.
It was supposed to be a warm and sunny day today and the morning walk to the AT junction, about 1/2 mile, was looking very positive in that regard.  I wasn't too concerned about the ""real feel"" prediction of the temps in the 90's because I've learned that in the shade of the mountain trees it is considerably cooler, so I expected it to feel like the low 80's and yet sunny and warmer when I was in the open.  
The start of today's hike was some of the most scenic and beautiful forest hiking yet.  The trail almost immediately leads to and along the Laurel Fork River.  The sound of the river can be heard long before you get to it and it is punctuated by various cascades as it flows north. The trail also passes through shear rock cliffs that it is obvious the trail was carved through.  As it turns out, this was carved out many years ago to accommodate a train that supported logging and mining operations in the area.  The train tracks do not exist anymore nor does any evidence of it ever existing.  In places, the rocks have broken off and slid down upon the trail so you have to hike on or around them as you go.  
The trail crosses several bridges that span the river taking you back and forth from the right to the left side and back again and eventually starts winding its way upward.  The trail was relatively wide and mostly dirt so it was easily traversable, so much so that about 1-1/2 miles in I was looking down and not up for the blazes and completely missed a 90 degree turn-off of the white blaze trail.  When I did look up for the blazes, I saw a blue one on this ""main trail"".  So I just thought the trail had been mismarked, because I hadn't deviated off of it, so I just kept going.  I expected the trail to ascend and it did.  About 3/4 mile up, I came to a shelter where several hikers were milling about getting their things together.  A girl brushing her teeth turned and saw me as I entered the area and said, oh hey!  Long time no see!!  I recognized her as the young lady who I had encountered days ago when leaving Jerry Cabin Shelter the day we encountered the lost Blue Tick dogs.  She had twisted her ankle that afternoon and had to get off the trail to recuperate.  Well, she had healed up and was back on the trail.  She caught up with me because of my last week of shorter miles and zero days biding my time at the Resort and timing my arrival in Damascus for July 3rd.  So I asked about the trail markings and her and the others said, no, you missed the white blaze turnoff and it goes down along the river.  What???  So they said the white blaze AT picks back up just a few yards further north so I continued that way.  For a brief moment, I did consider just continuing on and not backtracking to make up the section of the white blaze trail I had missed.  No one would know or care but me.  That thought was short-lived and I thought, I will know, forever, that I did not do the entire AT and that I skipped a 3/4 mile section.  That didn't sit well with me at the moment and I knew it would gnaw at me forever.  I wasn't going to complete 480 miles of the AT in 2018 and have it tarnished by a 3/4 mile gap, or asterisk.  So, I backtracked south along the white blaze trail and along the river.  The sounds and the views were some of the best yet along the AT and I am so glad I decided to do it right.  Yes, it cost me time-wise and an extra 1.4 miles round-trip, but it was worth it.  Once I got back to the junction where I missed my turn-off, I saw then, obviously, my error and turned around to now go north again along the white blaze AT, retracing my steps I'd just taken.  I had to go back down the rocky trail of some 200 feet that I had just climbed and at the other end, the opposite, but in the meantime, the trail took me to Laurel Fork Falls, which are the best falls I've seen yet on the AT.  I took several photos and a video.  I was very tempted to jump in but I thought, no, I've got 11 more miles to go and I don't want to do it wet.  I should have thought about it and jumped in naked.  THAT would have been worth it.  The trail also takes you along a rock ledge no more than 8 inches wide and just above the river.  All in all a spectacular portion of the trail I would have missed completely if not for my decision to do the ""purist"" thing and complete the white blaze trail.
So I finally worked my way back to where the blue blaze and white blaze trails merge at the northern junction and continued on north along the white blaze trail, now paranoid of similar situations the remainder of the day.  I knew I had a major climb coming up and the extra miles didn't help.  To make it slightly worse, I'd lost all accuracy as to the miles my Runkeeper was telling me because of guesstimating the double-back error and my initial (roughly) 1/2 mile walk from the Resort to the trail junction first thing this morning.  I wouldn't come to a definitive landmark until I got to US-321 and that wasn't until the northern base of Pond Flats Mountain, some 6-1/2 miles away.  
Pond Flats Mountain, on the elevation chart, was almost symmetrical in its ascent and descent.  It was three miles and 1700 feet up and down.  I had no idea how the terrain would be.  As it turned out, it was a relatively easy hike up and I got there long before I thought I should have.  But soon I was clearly descending and I decided to call the Resort and let them know my predicted arrival time at Wilbur Dam Road no, even though it was seven miles away, than to risk getting lower in elevation and not having cell service.  So I talked to Stephanie and told her I'd be at Wilbur Dam Road at 1:00pm, ready to be picked up.  She talked to Bob and they said to just call them back when I got to Watauga Dam, about 1.3 miles south of Wilbur Dam Road (two different dams).  
So now I was travelling the next seven miles through heavy bear country.  So much so that the park service had prohibited camping, picnicking or loitering of any kind and only allowed thru-hiking and stressed that even that be done expeditiously.  So, I thought this is a great chance to see more bears and maybe get some photos for once.  I tried being as quiet as I could as I hiked along, but I never did see any bears.  Oh well, there's still 37 miles of trail left this year and I have seen six already.  Some people hike the entire trail and never see any!  
So when I got off the mountain, I only had less than 4-1/2 miles to go to get to Wilbur Dam Road and it wasn't even 11:00am yet.  I was surprised at the time I was making, particularly considering my blue blaze error.  So the last 4-1/2 miles the trail skirts Watauga Lake.   It's pretty flat and I was able to zoom through there and there wasn't anything worth taking pictures of anyhow.  
I got to Watauga Dam at 11:56am.  I remember because I thought, I'm gonna make it by noon and sure enough, I did.  This is an earthen dam whereas Wilbur Dam is a hydroelectric built back in the 1930's.  So I called the Resort again from Watauga Dam and had to leave a voicemail.  I told them where I was and that I was only 1.3 miles from the pick-up point of Wilbur Dam Road and I'd be there by 12:40pm.  I took many photos from the dam and even saw a group of turkey buzzards take flight as I crossed, all but one.  The one held its ground just off the right side of the road and maybe 50 yards ahead of me.  I slowly approached it with my I-phone camera ready and I could get as close as maybe 30 feet and take photos and it would then take flight and land about 30 yards away.  This went on several times where I'd approach and take photos and it would fly 30 yards away.  I got one short video of it taking flight and several close-ups of it.  The rest of the group in the meantime were soaring over the rock cliffs about 1/4 mile away and I got several photos of them.  They are an ugly bird, but majestic in their own right.  Something I read years ago stated that buzzards, because they feed off of the dead carcasses of animals, are immune to virtually all bacteria and diseases that these animals carry and/or are susceptible to.  Pretty wild.  
So I finally made it off of the dam and continued up the paved road for about 2/10ths of a mile until it took me back into the woods for the last mile.  The trail ascended mainly over this last mile and I finally came out onto Wilbur Dam Road.Mary Lee had called me during the last mile and said her and Bob would be there shortly and I may have to wait for 15 minutes or so.  No problem, I had brought my book this time plus I was hoping I'd have cell coverage so I could upload photos to the journal, which I was able to do.  I got to the pick-up point at 12:36pm, so well before I had predicted.  It was still a very sunny and warm day, unlike it had been for much of the AT thus far.  So we headed back to the Resort in Mary Lee's convertible with the top down, that felt great, and only stopped at the drug store and Arby's to get Bob and her some lunch to take back.  I had had peanut butter and jelly sandwiches on my mind for 10-miles so I didn't want anything.We got back to the Resort before 2:00 and I first started my laundry, then got cleaned up, and then sat down and had lunch.  I had to put my clothes from the washer to the dryer in nothing but a towel and my poncho because I washed everything.  So, I watched part of a movie in my cabin while my clothes finished drying, then retrieved them, put on my ""camp clothes"" and folded the others.  I went out for a little while and talked to Bob and Stephanie but eventually went back to the cabin and watched 50/50 and started watching Blazing Saddles.  It began to rain around 5:30, totally unexpected, and it rained hard for about an hour.  At 7:30 I decided to fix my dinner of broiled salmon and some broccoli.  I had peanut M&Ms for dessert.  At around 9:00 I was really getting tired, probably the M&Ms, so I turned off Blazing Saddles and went to bed to read.  That didn't last and I was out by 9:30pm.  I guess my body needed it.","Dennis Cove

I ate two PBJs and some chips and watched the rest of Blazing Saddles as well as an interesting narrative by Mel Brooks on the making of the movie.  They went right into the making of Young Frankenstein as soon as Blazing Saddles was done.  So after all that I came back out to chit-chat for a while on the porch and to take breaks editing the journal photos again.  So now it's 3:00pm and the editing is done.  I'm drinking a few Bud Lights and enjoying the sunny Saturday.  I'll probably go read some more Gilgamesh and in my other book, the Singular Man and work on the NYT crossword.  I've got about 3/4 of it done.  I'll catch the rest of the day up later.So, tomorrow is the 16.1 mile hike, followed Monday by the 10.2 mile hike and then capped off Tuesday with the ""Road to Damascus"" 11.3 mile hike.  Will it be a turning point in my life?  I think it already has been...","Black Bear Resort

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/595960,"I got up at 6:30am this morning and got cleaned up, then ate chocolate Pop Tarts (I have just enough left for Monday and Tuesday mornings), a grapefruit and a big glass of V-8 juice.  I have just enough of those as well to last until Tuesday morning, so I have rationed well.At 7:30 I checked the weather.  Things looked good for the most part.  Less than 2% chance of rain until 2:00 when it would shoot up to 47% and above 50% at both 3:00 & 4:00.  On top of that, the real feel temperature was supposed to be around 95-97 degrees.  No big deal on that, I thought, I'll be in the woods, besides, I'd trained for high temps in Guantanamo a couple months ago.  The real feat would be to get done as close to 2:00 as possible and avoid any of the potential rain.Bob picked me up at 8:00 sharp and we were off to Wilbur Dam Road.  We saw three rabbits on the way.  Exciting, I know, but I've been telling about all the critters I saw throughout this journal so why stop now.We got to the drop-off point at 8:24 and I threw my pack on and started my Runkeeper app at 8:25.  The first challenge of the day was going to be at the beginning, so that was nice, a 700 foot ascent over 7/10ths of a mile.  I cruised through that no problem and now that my legs were awake I could tackle the next, another 3.8 miles of mainly ascents up another 600 feet to Vaneventer Shelter at mile 4.5, so near my 5-mile break point.  I needed to get to the 5-mile point by 10:25, I figured, so I'd be averaging 24 minute miles, fast enough to get me to the pick-up point, TN-91, by 2:45.  That way if the forecast did hold, I'd only have to deal with rain for the last 2-miles or so.  I also had to factor in photo ops.  I was in heavy bear country and the warnings were out.  So, if I saw any bears, I was definitely stopping for photos.  I also didn't want to miss out on any scenic opportunities, so if I could bump the average below 24 minutes/mile while in the woods where there were no photo opportunities, then great!  I also knew that after Vandeventer, it was mainly flat or downhill.  So with the mainly uphill for the first 4.5 miles, I still averaged just over 24 minutes/mile so I was feeling good about that.  I had only seen 3 other hikers, and they were together and all going southbound (they'd be the only other hikers I'd see all day).  That was a little odd for a Sunday, but I guess most people were taking advantage of the sunny day and on or near the lake.So after Vandeventer, my guide didn't show any interesting areas along the trail for the rest of the day so I was into workout mode unless I saw critters or plants worth photographing.  At the 12:05 it began to rain.  CRAP!  It drizzled for literally about 30-seconds and stopped.  The sun was still out above the trees and it was humid but I was taking my fluids every 2.5-miles instead of every 5 so I felt good.  At the 10-mile mark, around 12:30pm, something big on my right about 10 feet in front of me bolted from shrubbery and took off down the hillside.  I did not see it but it was large, and the only other large critters, besides bears, would be deer, but deer don't crash through the woods like that, they bolt, but they are rather agile and prance deftly.  This was a bull-rush sound as if straight and through whatever might be in its way.  By deduction, a bear, but I can't be certain because I never saw it, so it doesn't count in my book.  Still stuck on 6 bear sightings.  I did see a deer a few miles before, but only one and it was heading away about 30 yards off.Bob had told me to call him when I was an hour from the pick-up point because it would take him that long to get there, so I had planned on calling him at mile 13.  So I called the Resort at 1:36pm and told them I'd be at TN-91 by 2:45pm.  Three miles to go and all downhill or flat but I had no idea about the terrain (rocks, roots, boulders, etc.).  It turned out to be mainly dirt trail with some rocks but nothing major.  I passed several distinct piles of bear scat so that had me a little concerned since none of them looked too old.  I didn't want to zip around a blind curve and bump into an unsuspecting bear, so I had to really pay attention all around me as I went.  I still made it to the pick-up point at 2:36pm, but Bob had beaten me there.  He said he just started reading his book when I got there.  So, overall a great day.  15.97 miles in 6 hours and 11 minutes, so a great workout, and I still got some photos in and have posted them already.  Wish I'd seen the bear though.  So it took us nearly an hour to get back.  I sat on the front porch and drank a beer and talked with Stephanie and Bob and then got cleaned up and fixed a late lunch of PBJs and Ramen soup with a tuna packet mixed in.  No M&Ms, saving them for tonight and tomorrow night.  So, my food supplies are dwindling but will last me just fine.  I also watched Signs and just finished it a little while ago while eating sliced turkey and mustard as a pre-dinner snack.So, 96% done.  21.5 miles to go.  10.2 miles to McQueen Gap tomorrow, and it's got one slight hill, Holston Mountain, and then all flat, so I hope to be back to the Resort by 1:00pm for lunch.  On Tuesday, Bob will drop me off with a full pack for my final leg from McQueen Gap to Damascus, 11.3 miles, and it is all mostly flat.  Russell Riggs will join me somewhere along that leg into Damascus and Susan, Charlie & Terry Doss will also meet me in Damascus.  So, I hope to get in there around 1:30pm and begin celebrating the end of the first stage, a little less than 25% of the AT will be complete.  Three more years to go, or four...","Wilbur Dam Rd

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596046,"I got up at 6:29am, one minute before my alarm was to go off.  I was anxious to get started today, it being a short 10-miler and my next to last day.  I had chocolate Pop Tarts, a grapefruit and V-8 juice for breakfast and loaded my pack with the slack pack basics, poncho, pack cover and fluids.  I checked the weather and all looked good.  No rain in the forecast but the temps were predicted to hit in the high 80's/low 90's with real feel temps in the low triple digits.  That wouldn't be until the early afternoon so I had incentive to get done early.Bob arrived right on time and I talked to Susan briefly this morning before Bob showed up so I was ready to go.  It was nearly an hour drive to get to the drop-off point of TN-91.  I was getting closer and closer to Virginia and further from the Resort.  At 8:49am I started off on today's hike.  The first mile took me through a farmer's fields, that was a nice change of pace.  I stopped several times to take photos but I didn't see any animals.  I saw evidence of animals, cows, it looked like, but no animals.  Finally, at the far corner of the farm and where the AT exits the property, I see all these cows huddled in a corner of the fenced-in property.  So I took a picture.There wasn't anything particularly difficult about today's hike.  I had a gradual 750 foot ascent up Holston Mountain over three miles and then the equal descent before 4.7 miles of relative flat trail.  Since it was only 10-miles, I turned it into a speed walking workout.  I was curious to see if I could average under 22:00/mile for the duration.  I hadn't hit anything that fast yet and Bob had told me this segment was pretty much ""green tunnel"" so there was little-to-no scenery to take in.  The only thing that would slow me down would be photos of bears, snakes or some other oddity so I pushed myself almost as fast as I could go without running.  I also decided I didn't need a break until the 5-mile point since it was only 10 total.  At 5-miles, I took the short fluid break and I still hadn't seen any wildlife, or other hikers, for that matter.  I was well under 22 minutes/mile and began wondering if I could get under 20 minutes/mile with just flats ahead.  Playing these games keeps me motivated, so I pressed on and by 7-1/2 miles I was averaging just under 21 minutes/mile.  I didn't think I'd be able to do it and I didn't know what the terrain was going to be like up ahead but I just pushed myself harder, knowing I only had one day left.When I got to McQueen Gap, I stopped my Runkeeper app and I had averaged 20:22/mile over the 10.1.  So, I missed going under 20 minutes/mile but I was satisfied with that and overall it was a great workout.  Bob and I had a drive back that was just over an hour and I nearly fell asleep several times.  The day turned out to be pretty awesome with high temps and few clouds.One we got back I drank a beer on the office porch and asked Mary Lee and Stephanie to total my bill since Bob and I would be leaving early in the morning.  I then got cleaned up and ate lunch, 2 PBJs and the last of my potato chips, and then did my laundry for the last time.  By then they had my bill totaled so I paid that and Bob gave me another beer which I drank with them on the porch.So I watched Into The Blue and am now a little into History of the World, Part I, but after I update the journal I'll probably read a little before fixing my dinner which'll be leftover chicken with Ramen soup and anything else I can find that I don't want to either leave behind or tote out of here tomorrow in my pack.So that's it for now.  I'll edit the photos I took and look forward to ending this year's adventure tomorrow.","TN-91

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596170,"I awoke today at 6:00am, excited that it was my last AT hike day of the year and that I would soon be with Susan again after over a month.  We hadn’t been apart this long in over 27years, since I deployed on USS Lapon in 1990.  
So I took a quick shower and started sorting things for the final packing.  I also sorted the last of my food and ate up pretty much the last of what I’d bought at Wal-Mart over a week ago.  I left the Resort 2 packets of unopened tuna, a can of mandarin oranges and a Diet Coke.  The only food I set aside to pack was some dried vegetables and fruit, the last baggie of my homemade beef jerky, baggies of the last of my pistachios, almonds and cashews and the last pack of my Pro Bar energy chews.  
It took me 1-1/2 hours to get all that done and to repack my pack for the final time and then to clean up and inspect the room to make sure I didn’t forget anything.  
I then returned the last DVD I watched, Mel Brooks’ The History of the World, Part I, called Susan from the office porch and waited for Bob.
Bob arrived a little earlier, 7:50am, and we departed the resort for the last time. We stopped for coffee along the way and didn’t get to McQueen Gap until 9:23am, so over a 1-1/2 hour drive.  I had settled up with the Resort the night before and Mary Lee and Stephanie informed me that I shattered a Resort record, that being the largest bill. I didn’t break it by a little, but by some 150%!  Not a record you really want but, as I told them it was a win/win.  I got the predictability of a cabin to stay in for 10 days and reliable shuttle service that allowed me to slack pack for the duration and that got my money.  Works for me.
So once we got to McQueen, I said goodbye to Bob for the last time and thanked him again for the hospitality and service.  
At 9:26am I set off for the last 11.3 miles of my adventure this year and the trek into Damascus.  I knew Susan, Terry and Charlie were leaving Hampton Roads at 8:30am and that it was a 6-hour trip, so they should get there around 2:30-3:00. Russell Riggs was somewhere between McQueen Gap and Damascus along the trail and I didn’t know when we’d cross paths.
Being super-excited and full of adrenaline, I set off on a torrid pace.  The terrain helped, bring mainly dirt path, and the rise/fall of the trail was tamped down from what it had been and was this mainly flat with some minor ups/downs.  Even when I did hit a rise, I knew it would be short-lived and powered up it.  
I also knew from previewing the guide documentation that this leg was essentially uneventful in terms of “things to see” and I was cruising from point A to point B through the Green Tunnel. The only thing that could slow me down today would be a bear or rattlesnake sighting. I was hoping for both. 
There were a lot of people on the trail for a Tuesday, maybe because it was the day before a holiday.
I said my hellos and have a great hike as I passed but really didn’t get caught up in any lengthy conversations, determined to push as fast as I could.  I also had a full pack for the first time in 10 days, at 32 pounds, having weighed it at the Resort, and was curious as to how it would affect me on this final hike.  
Well, it didn’t take long to discover the full pack weight would have no detrimental affect.  I blazed the 1st mile in 20:06 and the second in 18:17.  It got faster after that!  The only thing I had to look forward to besides Damascus was the Tennessee/Virginia border at mile 466.4, 3.7 miles before the end.
When I got to 4.3 miles, 7-miles out of Damascus, I heard the familiar heavy branch crunching off to my right and about 15 yards ahead.  I stopped and looked and did catch a glimpse of a fleeing bear, a cub it looked like.  I resumed my hike but not for long.  Within seconds and maybe 5 yards further, I saw the unmistakable black mass of a bear on the trail just ahead, maybe 30 feet away.  The Mom.  She had her back to me so she was facing north.  She looked over her right shoulder at me as I slowly reached for my I-phone camera.  I never even got to the zippered  arm sleeve it was in.  She turned back around and immediately followed the cub’s route and crashed through the foliage off the right side of the trail.  Bears 7 and 8 for the trip, but no photos. Now where are the rattlesnakes?
When I got to the TN/VA border I still hadn’t seen Russell, but there was a couple at the trail sign taking a break so the woman offered to take my picture beside the border sign.  Once she did that we chatted for about a minute and I was off, intent on making up the time I’d lost.  I still hadn’t stopped for any fluids or food and didn’t feel I needed to.  I was feeling great and the temps were mild in the mid-80’s, great for hiking.  
With less than 4-miles to go I was poring it on, just short of running.  I knew I’d hit Damascus around 1:00pm.  At the 9-mile mark or thereabouts. I finally caught up with Russell.  He was beside the trail taking a fluid/food break.  So we talked for a few seconds and I told him I’d hike to the far side of Damascus and meet him at the Mt. Rogers Outfitters where be’d parked.  So I set off again.  At the 10-1/2 mile mark I could finally hear and see Damascus below and I tried going faster, without getting hurt.  I broke through the trees and into back yards and onto the streets of Damascus.  The trail then takes you through the small town following S. Beaver Ave and turns right down W. Laurel Ave. and then right again down Douglas Drive where it merges with the Virginia Creeper Trail beside Mojo’s Trailside Cafe.  There’s a totem pole beside the trail there that has the mile markers on it and that was my stopping point for this year and starting point for next. Like I said, my goal was to get there by 1:00pm.  I got there at 1:01, so I missed by a minute, but I was done!  There was a guy getting in a truck right there so I got him to take my picture by he totem.I then went to Mojo’s to get a table and a beer and texted Russell to meet me there instead of at the Outfitters.  Russell showed up about 20 minutes later and we drank a couple beers and then he left to head back to DC since his kids were coming home for the 4th.  I texted Susan and they were only a little ways out.  They finally arrived around 2:30 and we had more beer and then went to Damascus Old Mill to check in. I had asked in Mojo’s about the 4th festivities and the town had set up a fair atmosphere and was doing fireworks in the town park.  We went to the Damascus Brewery to have beers and get something to eat but they quit serving at 4:00, food that is, so Charlie and I went across the street to Pizza Plus and picked up several things and brought it all back to the brewery.  We ate there but at 6:00 they closed so we went to Food City, also across the street, and picked up beer and brought that back to the Inn where we sat out on the deck by Mock’s Mills Falls and enjoyed the atmosphere, talked, listened to the fireworks go off at 9:00 and just socialized over drinks.  After the fireworks, we turned in. A nice culmination to this year’s hike.","McQueen Gap

Despite how bad I aches, particularly my right Achilles, I was feeling fine this morning.  So, I was looking forward to hiking and testing out my Achilles and all my other joints, tendons, muscles, etc.
I got to Sundog a little after 6:30, 1/2 hour before the pre-arranged pick-up time of 7:00am.  So I sat on a bench out front and waited.  A van pulled up about 6:45, Wolf, no doubt, so I loaded my pack and we were off.  
Wolf is about the same age as me with peppery gray hair and a matching long beard.  I had heard that he had hiked the AT five times so I asked him about it.  He hiked the first time after getting out of the Marine Corps back in 1986.  He said he didn’t make it the entire way but dropped out in the New Hampshire White Mountains because it wasn’t fun anymore.  He hiked it again the following year but again dropped off the trail in The Whites, this time because he met a girl.  He lived the hiking life for 5 years, often taking offshoot trails and just exploring nature.  He said he often gets credited or cited for hiking the AT five times but he never actually through-hiked it all at one time.  He said he has done it if you connect all the pieces over the 5 years.  He’s lived up in Damascus since then and often hikes in and around Mount Rogers, the highest mountain in Virginia, and neighboring Whitetop Mountain.
So Wolf dropped me off at 7:15 at Summit Cut and I was off on today’s adventure.  My first 5 miles looked to be the toughest of the day, a 2000 foot ascent of Whitetop Mountain.  I prefer having the long climbs early in the day when I’m fresh so this was just fine.  At 7:15 in the morning I had the trail to myself, and nature.  I tried to stay as quiet as I could because the morning seems to be the best time to sight bears but I didn’t see or hear any today.  Once at the peak of Whitetop I had some really good views of the neighboring mountains and valleys and just kept pushing on knowing I had a long way to go.  I was looking forward to the wild ponies in Grayson Highlands but wasn’t really sure when I’d come across them.  Wolf had said they are in and around Elk Garden which sat in the valley between Whitetop and Rogers Mountains.  I got to Elk Garden after the two-mile descent of Whitetop Mountain but no ponies.  I did see and photograph a deer that cut across the trail ahead of me and then it stopped and “froze” 30 feet away.  I got my I-phone camera out and I wasn’t fortunate not to spook it.  It had it’s hind end towards me so I made a kissing sound to get it to look my way and it did!  So, I got a pretty good photo of it I’ll post.  
My next highlight was going to be the ascent of Rogers Mountain.  The AT doesn’t go all the way to the top (5729 Ft.) but does go to an elevation of 5490.  By the time I got there I was happy with that and looking forward to the descent.  Again I had great views but no ponies!! 12 miles into today’s hike and no other people either, which suits me fine.  I like having the trail to myself.
So on the descent or northern side of Mount Rogers is Thomas Knob Shelter and as I came through the trees, before I even saw the shelter, I heard the unmistakable neighing of horses and then saw about a dozen of them as I came into the shelter clearing.  There were teo guys talking behind the shelter so I asked about the ponies.  They said the ponies showed up when they did so I guess they get used to food from people at the shelter and we’re thus hanging out for freebies.  I took a few photos and one pony started licking the sweat off my legs.  I had read that they’ll do that.  Then I started thinking, hey, this is a wild animal and who knows where that mouth has been or what diseases or stuff this horse could be transmitting to me.  So, I headed on and the pony dropped off after  only a few feet.  I ran into a couple and their dog right after that and told them about the ponies and about thirty seconds later heard the dog barking incessantly.  I guess it wasn’t familiar with horses.
At Massie Gap three miles later I came across 6 other ponies.  4 girls were there taking photos so I just kept hiking on towards Grayson Highlands.  Through Grayson Highlands I passed several groups of Mennonite or Amish schoolchildren heading towards Massie Gap, I guess to see the ponies.  The children, probably ranging in age from 12-18, were spread out in groups of 3-6 for about a mile!  I kept walking by them.  The girls all had the long dresses on but at least they had running shoes, most of them.  Four adults were at the rear.  I was amazed they were out there and so I’ll-preparer but I figure they were from the area and therefore knew what they were doing. 
I was pressing for time and wanting to get to VA-603 so i could call Sufi Hostel and catch a ride to their place for the night.  I wasn’t sure how long they’d run a shuttle or how much room they had.  I got to the road just before 7:00, and four guys were setting up camp to the right of the trail south of the road.  Of the few people I’d met the day before, here was one of them.  “Redbeard” is a young guy from Massachusetts and he remembered me from the previous day.  I told him my plans and he said I could camp with them if things didn’t work out, which they did not.  VA-603 sits in a valley between Stone Mountain, my third mountain that day, and Hurricane Mountain, my first one the next day, so, no cell service.  I tried thumbing a ride but no vehicles came by, let alone stopped.  So, I went back to where Redbeard was and set up my hammock-tent for the night. I met the other guys, “Flying Dutchman”, because he’s Dutch and in the beginning days was running down the hills; “Wizard”, because he’s an older grey-haired guy; “Laces”, because he hiked in sandals; and Redbeard, because he has a red beard.  We sat up by a campfire talking and each eating their own supper supplies until it got dark about 9:00 and then we all filed off for our separate tents for the night.  I left the raincover off my hammock so I just had the mosquito netting canopied above me.  I watched the stars and aircraft high above me with no city lights to wash them out.  I listened to the various animals and critters throughout the night, mainly an owl or two doing their thing.  I didn’t sleep very well in my hammock, rarely do, but it beats sleeping on the ground.  I tossed and turned but I guess I got a little sleep here and there.
So, for the day 23.95 miles in 11 hours 37 minutes.  All in all a long day but no major aches/pains so I’m pretty happy with that.
More tomorrow.","Summit Cut, VA
","VA-603 Fox Creek, VA","May 07, Tue",23.95
TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613002,"I started off today pretty well.  Despite only eating beef jerky and dehydrated vegetables and fruit, I wasn’t really that hungry.  I have about 30 pounds of food stores to burn off anyhow.  Feeling grimy/dirty was far worse.  I had taken a Wet Ones “bath” the night before, but those little wipes only go so far.  I was looking forward to a real shower but I had a 22-mile day ahead of me.  I got up at 6:15 and retrieved my bear bag from a tree about 100 yards away.  It had my food in it and anything else that puts off a scent like toothpaste, vitamins and yes, Wet Ones.  The bag was just as I’d left it so I guess no bears took interest.  There were, or are, bear warning signs all along this portion of the AT (yesterday’s portion).  They’re out there and not afraid of getting it from careless hikers.  Trail word is that a bear came through a hiker camp in the middle of the night several days ago.  I guess if they don’t smell or get any food left out they wander on.  Still, a little unnerving hearing the loud unmistakable crunching of branches and leaves outside your tent!
By 7:15 I had all my stuff packed up and was off again, destination VA-16, Sugar Grove, and I short 6-mile ride into Marion, VA.
My plan was to keep my hiking steady pace, no big breaks, only 5-minute fluid stops at 6, 12 and 18 miles.  That worked OK, but took its toll later on Wednesday evening.  I’ll get to that.  I left Fox Creek with two 16- oz collapsible bottles that were a mixture of water and Nuin electrolyte tabs.  Instead of using one tab per bottle I halved it.  I was trying to conserve.  Lesson:  don’t do that!  I also had my 64-oz bottle only half full.  I thought I’d save on the weight going uphill and I’d have plenty of spots to refill.  
So at 7:15 I started upout of the valley and winding up Hurricane Mountain.  It’s a short hike up, 2-miles, and 845 feet of elevation gain.  Once I got there I had 5-miles of flat-to-low rolling hills to traverse.  I got to the Dickey Gap Trail junction and took my first fluid break, 6-1/4 miles in.  I was still feeling really good overall and looking forward to Marion.  Along the way I saw a snake.  It stopped crossing the trail so I took a photo and as I went over it it continued on its way. My first snake this outing and fourth overall.  Oh yeah, I also had my first time uncontrolled fall this trip or last trip, so 520 miles of trail in.  My right toe clipped a root or a rock and I lost my balance forward and my right trekking pole gave way so I landed on my right thigh, knee and shoulder.  If there’d been another rock or root 4 inches high I’d have planted my face on it.  I got up, dusted off and headed on, no worse for wear, thankfully, except for a knee/calf abrasion.  I’ll take that any day.  
So I continued on and things were pretty uneventful and again, not many hikers.  A lot of the time the hike winds through the woods and trails take you along switchbacks up a mountain (instead of just going straight up), so besides vegetation and the occasional critter, there’s not much to stop in awe of.  Yes, there are great Mountain View’s, but a lot of the trail is in the woods.  So it becomes a workout of cranking out miles and counting down to the “beer frames”. That’s what I call the last 10-miles of any hike or run.  10 miles and I can enjoy a beer, 9 miles and I can enjoy a beer, and so on.  Whatever motivates ya.  It works though.  I get stronger in the last 2-3-4 miles.  
At Comers Creek and the 7-mile mark, I started my second ascent, 3-1/2 miles and 920 feet up High Point Mountain.  This one for some reason was a little tougher than it should have been.  Looking back I think it was the heat and I had not been taking in enough fluids.
I stopped at the top of High Point and took in more fluids but I couldn’t drink it all because I wasn’t sure where the next watering hole was.  I figured there’d be water at Trimpi Shelter 2-miles away or at Teas Road in the valley 4-miles away but I wasn’t sure.  It hadn’t rained in days so you can never count on the streams.  Sometimes they dry up.  Near Trimpi Shelter, or the turn off to the shelter, I took a longer break and ate some jerky, energy held, dehydrated vegetables and fruit and drank the last of my fluids.  I had opened a new bag of dehydrated bananas and was munching away when something in my mouth, something about these bananas, didn’t taste quite right.  I reached in my mouth and pulled out the partially chewed on dessicant pack.  Good thing it didn’t break!!  By the way, it turns red when it gets wet.
I got started again but was getting concerned about my lack of fluids.  I was thirsty now, even though I had just drank, but that was only my last 8-oz of electrolyte.  I started listening out for the sound of running water and I was going downhill so I knew there’d be a stream soon and sure enough, after 8/10 of a mile I came across one.  I decided I was going to fill up, not just my bottles, but “camel up” as the hikers say, and drink as much as I could.  I knew I was dehydrated but I didn’t know how bad.  Despite the 64 oz of water and electrolyte I’d had over the past 13 miles, I had only peed twice, and both times were not much at all and it was dark colored.  Not good!  Anyhow, I spent about 20-minute at the stream and started feeling a lot better with 9 miles to go. 
After Teas Toad the trail goes back up, this time ascending Pugh Mountain, 800 feet over 4-miles. It’s not steep at all but it does have its “hiccups” where it gains in rise, usually for a few tenths of a mile, and then goes back to a manageable grade or levels off.  Those hiccups take their toll!!  They don’t look like much on an elevation chart but they hurt.  
So after Pugh I had 2-miles rolling down and then 2 miles rolling up into Sugar Grove.  
I forgot something.  Back at mile 8 I came to a notice from the National Park Service that the bridge was out spanning Comers Creek.  It recommended taking the bypass trail 1.3 miles around.  Or, one could Ford the creek at their own risk.  Now if I were in my 20’s again, I’d have gone the adventurous route, but being 59 and supposedly older and wiser, I opted for the detour.  Plus, I was alone,so no one to pull me out if I fell in.  It turned out that the detour felt good on the feet since it was gravel road and then paved road.  Come to find out in Marion after talking to several other hikers, the bridge wasn’t out, but damaged and risky to cross, although some did.  Also, it turns out the detour only added 1/10 mile, not 1.3 miles, like several of us thought.
Back to story.  I was pleasantly surprised to get to the Mount Rogers Headquarters at VA-16 a little after 5:00.  Although they were closed, there was a free phone there and the numbers for cabs, shuttles, hotels, restaurants, etc.  I called a shuttle but no one answered so I called a cab.  10 minutes later I was on my way to Marion.  The driver was great and told me about and showed me all the stuff in Marion.  He dropped me at EconoLodge and the ride only cost me $20.  
After checking in and dropping off my stuff, I took a shower, dressed, washed out my hiking gear and hung it up to dry and walked up the street to a Mexican restaurant.  While I was in there enjoying a beer and burrito, my fingers on my left hand started curling and cramping.  At first it was a nuisance and I would flex them out but it kept happening.  Then it got worse.  Then it spread to both hands. I was talking to Susan and had to hang up because I could not hold the phone.  I drank more water, through the straw, because I couldn’t pick up the glass!  It was hurting pretty bad and I figured it was due to dehydration.  I looked it up on my I-phone and that sort of confirmed it for me, that and overuse of the hands.  Trekking poles for 10 hours straight might do that.  I almost had the restaurant call the Rescue Squad, I was real close, but the water seemed to help and the pain and cramping subsided.  I drank more water, and more beer, but more water than beer.  My hands cramped off and on for the next several hours but I continued to drink fluids, water and electrolyte, back in my room.  So, despite feeling good on the trail, dehydration had taken its toll.  I am taking more water breaks from now on.I was supposed to do another 24-miler followed by a 22-miler and then take a zero day in Wytheville, but after the dehydration scare I decided to re-write my schedule and start that off with a zero day in Marion tomorrow.So today’s totals were 22.32 miles in 10 hours 7 minutes with a total elevation climb of 4381 feet.  Tuesday’s elevation was 4873 feet total and Monday’s was 2868 feet.Since Monday, 62.18 miles down, 475 (roughly) to go...","VA-603 Fox Creek, VA

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613014,"my zero day started out great.  I slept late and got up around 8:00.  I got all my dirty clothes together, doesn’t amount to much hiking, and headed out the door. I stopped at Walgreens for a pair of insoles for my Salomon Trail runners.  I have a habit of pulling the insoles out of all my shoes and putting my preferred insoles in.  I had put in a pair of heel inserts to relieve my Achilles pain but forgot to stick in regular insoles beneath them.  So, I’ve been hiking for three days with no forefoot padding. I have them in there now!I then went next door to McDonald’s for breakfast and there at a table is Redbeard, Laces and the Dutchman!  They stopped in town after cranking out 6 miles this morning for breakfast and some resupply and then were gong back out for another 10. We talked for about 20 minutes then parted ways.  I’m sure I’ll see them up the trail.  I then went on down the road to the laundromat afte my breakfast.  My laundry went pretty quick and I talked to a couple more thru-hikers in there, a girl from Sarasota, Florida who had quit her job and decided to hike the trail and a student from Columbus, Ohio.  Once my laundry was done I waked the 1.1 miles back up the road to the hotel to put stuff away and get my hike planning paperwork to amend over a few beers at the Mexican restaurant.  The walk to and from the laundromat felt great.  My body overall feels good and the zero day definitely helped.  So amending my plans over beer I decided to shorten up my hike prior to driving back to Damascus for Trail Days.  Originally, I was gonna crank out 188 miles, get into Blacksburg, rent a car and drive back to Damascus.  But that called for one zero day and 6 of the remaining 9 hiking days 20+ mile days.  So after the dehydration scare I altered that to an 11-mile day tomorrow that I’ll “slack pack”, minimal gear and return to Marion.  Saturday will be a 12-miler, Sunday an 18-miler, Monday a 16-miler and I’lol shuttle to Wytheville where I’lol also stay over Tuesday and Wednesday, Tuesday as a zero day and Wednesday I’ll do 18-miles. I’ll be 25 miles north of Wytheville but shuttle back.  From there I drive to Trail Days in Damascus on Thursday.  I’ll amend my schedule as need be after Trail Days and I get back up to Wytheville.So I ate a big pizza for dinner and caught up the journal so more to follow tomorrow.","Marion

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613089,"I started off today by getting up at 6:25am, getting cleaned up and repacking my backpack got a slackpack day.  So, all I had in it was my first aid kit, some wheat rolls I had bought at Ingle’s yesterday, my 32oz bottle of water, (2) 16oz bottles of electrolyte mix, my water filter kit, my recharger pack and my ID/credit card/cash.  Oh, and my comb.  By the way, for all those concerned, my hair is holding up well.  I hike with my USS Lapon ballcap on and I tuck my hair behind my ears, so it is no problem.  I wet my ballcap in streams constantly and it keeps my head cool.  I won’t have the hair issue next year because I plan on donating it just prior to the 2020 hike so I’ll go on the trail with a shaved head.  That’ll feel good!  I did get told today that I looked like Willie Nelson, a first for me.  I guess the scraggly beard added to the image.  
So I called a cab at 7:00 and they picked me up shortly thereafter and dropped me off at VA-16 Sugar Grove where I’d stopped two days ago.  At 7:50 I was hiking.  On the ride there I modified one of my electrolyte bottles by cutting a small hole in the seam at the top and running a carabiner through it.  Then I connected that to a point on my left should strap of my pack, opposite my bear spray which sits on my right shoulder strap.  So the electrolyte bottle and my bear spray are both easily reachable across my chest.  I also used the elastic tie that is designed into the pack to hold folded trekking poles to hold the bottom of the electrolyte bottle in place.  It worked out really well today and I got plenty of fluids without having to stop.  I could just unclip the carabiner and pull the bottle out and reconnect it easily afterward.  Now once that 16oz bottle went dry then I’d have to stop and take off my pack to refill it with either my other electrolyte bottle on my right hip or my water bottle in the main compartment of my pack.  But that only took a minute or so.  So, I stayed hydrated and didn’t lose momentum with lengthy stops.  I still need to put a rubber grommet in the hole I cut into the bottle to keep it from wearing through as the carabiner stresses it.  Maybe a piece of 1/4 inch hose as well to adapt as a long straw.  A lot to think about.  Don’t want severe dehydration again!  Thank God I got a D in Anatomy & Physiology all those years ago in college!  Comes in handy to self-diagnose.
Oh, before Ingo any further, often when I’m hiking I remember things I either forgot or need to correct from a previous entry.  So those edits just occur when I can get to it.  For example, I referred to the group of schoolchildren on the 7th as Mormons, they were not.  They were either Mennonites or Amish.  I don’t know why I had Mormons on my mind when I wrote that.  
My first 5 miles of today’s 11.4 miler were primarily uphill.  Since it was first thing in the morning, I was slackpacking (it weighed about 10 lbs. instead of the normal 30), I had my improved hydration system and I had gel insoles now, I was feeling great for a short day.  I tried to stay as quiet as I could along the trail knowing I was one of the first ones up and out hiking and that the chances of a bear encounter would be good.  BUT, sad to say, no such encounters or photo ops today.  I didn’t even see my first person until 5.5 miles in.  There, just before the Glade Mountain overlook (see photo) I came upon “JJ”, so trail named because when people along the trail asked his name he would say “just John”, so some girl on the trail annointed him JJ.  JJ is from Massachusetts and just retired after a 20-year Air Force career.  He, like me, is a relative loner hiker and not one to fall in with the “tramilies”, trail families, that develop amongst the through-hikers along the trail.  Most are benign groups that hike at a similar pace but some matastisize into these “Lord of the Flies” territorial wolfpacks complete with the alpha male head honcho.  Those groups are, well, not pleasant (I’ll keep it clean).  So anyhow I talked to JJ shortly at Glade Mountain and then we parted ways (he was hiking slower than me).  
I also ran across a portion of Trail that was rezoned.  What the park service does from time to time along the AT is they reroute the trail of a given area if it has become eroded or damaged due to hiker overuse or abuse (short cuts).  In my case today, the reroute shortened the trail by 4/10 mile.  Sometimes the reroute will lengthen it, like when the bridge was out the other day.  
The north side of Glade Mountain was pretty much downhill all the way to I-81, so with me slackpacking and the trail mainly being dirt with very few sections of rocks or roots, I could practically run.  As I neared one clearing section, I heard what sounded like the hum of an electric power plant and didn’t know what to expect.  What it turned out to be was a high tension tower that the trail went directly under.  The hum of the electricity overhead was abnormally very loud but I wasn’t going to stick around to investigate.  I figure just passing beneath it altered my mitochondria and I didn’t want to hang around and sprout a third eye or something.
I caught up with Ron, another through-hiker at the Settler’s Museum and Lindamood Schoolhouse right along the trail.  Ron was recently medically discharged from the Army after 16-1/2 years and dontoom up the hike.  Approaching the area, There were several signs about trail magic (snacks/drinks for hikers left by locals or past hikers) at the schoolhouse but since I was on a short hike I didn’t need any and I didn’t want to take what some through-hiker behind me might need.  Ron felt the same way but he was gonna hang back and check out the museum so I motored on.  
About a mile later I could hear the vehicles on what I presumed was I-81.  It is pretty wild how far that sound can travel through the woods.  It sounds a lot closer than two miles away!  As I meandered onward I crossed railroad tracks and entered a field.  Now I could see the vehicles on I-81.  As it turned out, I still had 1.5 miles to go as the trail serpentined through the field and the trees.  Eventually though I came out at Route 11 and crossed the street to a Sunoco station which on the other side was I-81.  I walked on over to an Exxon next door which is where the trail led before continuing on under I-81.  My journey was over for the day and it was only 12:20pm.  I called the cab that dropped me off but couldn’t get an answer.  Finally after 30 minutes I did but they said they couldn’t get me until 5:00!  I called another cab and they said they’d be there in 15 minutes.  In the meantime I talked to two other hikers, Rob and Wade who were from Raleigh, NC.  They were only out hiking for four days so we’re awaiting their ride back to their car and then heading home.  Also while I waited I noticed a string of packs outside at The Barn, a restaurant across the street.  Most establishments don’t allow packs inside.  A little later than several hikers came out and proceeded along the road to the trail so they walked about 50 feet in front of me. The three from the laundromat yesterday were among them and they came over to say hi.  The one guy I hadn’t really met yesterday is from Charlotte, NC.  All of them are through-hiking.  Something I forgot to add that is a standard greeting along the trail in Lieu of a handshake is a fist bump.  The main reason for this type of greeting along the trail is because with so many people from all over the world hiking both directions along the trail, this minimizes the chances of spreading a cold or worse and infecting the entire trail.  So after fist bumps with the trio they took off and I awaited my cab which came moments later.  The drive back to the EconoLodge 10 miles away was uneventful and my driver didn’t talk much.  When I got out at the hotel I realized I didn’t have my trekking poles.  I tried calling the Exxon but only got a fax line.  In my room I started to look up an alternative number while unpacking my pack and realized I had folded my trekking poles and put them in my pack so that I wouldn’t forget them.  It’s a new habit I’m trying to maintain with my trek poles, gloves and other miscellaneous stuff so I don’t forget them.  Needless to say I was greatly relieved.I showered again and changed then washed out my hike gear.  Then I walked across the street to the Mexican restaurant for a late lunch, to make my lodging and ride plans for tomorrow and to update the journal.  That all being done I walked to WalMart to pick up some supplies to modify my water bottle more.  I picked up a small pack of eyelets and a two-pack of bolt snaps and it works great.  I hammered the eyelet through the hole I had cut in my bottle so now it is protected from tearing and then connected the bolt snap so now I can just connect my carabiner to the bolt snap. So now I’m just hanging out in my room and after this I’ll have to pre-pack for tomorrow, I’m getting picked up at 8:00am, and grab some dinner later.So, for the day I had 11.05 miles in 4 hours and 19 minutes.  So far that gives me 73.2 miles along the trail.  Tomorrow’s a relatively easy day at 12.6 miles.  It is supposed to thunderstorm off and on tomorrow so hopefully I can get done before it gets too bad.  I attached a photo of my entire schedule, subject to more changes, of course.","VA-16 Sugar Grove, VA
",I-81 Atkins AT junction,"May 10, Fri",11.05
TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613198,"Today started off great with the anticipation of completing a 12.6 mile hike from the Exxon station at I-81 Atkins to VA-42, Ceres, VA where I had already pre-arranged lodging at Bear Garden Hiker Hostel with one of the co-owners, Roberta, or, Bert.  
I woke up at 6:45am and after getting cleaned up repacked all my stuff since today would be a full pack hike day.  I would be leaving Marion in the taillights.  
I had pre-arranged a cab pick-up for 8:00am so I had plenty of time to take inventory and to pack specifically for today’s hike, taking into consideration the threat of thunderstorms in today’s forecast.  My poncho, pack cover and windbreaker were this in my outermost pocket of my backpack.
I went down to the lobby area for a quick OJ and coffee.  While there it started to sprinkle and it was already overcast with, wait for it...nimbostratus rain clouds!  Thank you Meteorology class!  
My ride showed up right on time, almost 8:00am on the spot. It was the same woman who picked me up yesterday but today she had her husband with her and he was driving.  From what I recall of our conversation yesterday, she was unfamiliar with the area we were going so it made sense someone familiar with the area would be with her. 
They dropped me off at the Exxon about 8;10am and with a little bit of preparation I was off.  The initial portion of the trail took me along the paved road north, route 683, Windsor Road, going under I-81.  As I walked along I contemplated donning my pack cover and poncho but the rain was right on the verge of do I or don’t I?  I was still in the open and I figured once in the “green tunnel” of the woods, I wouldn’t need them as long as the rain didn’t intensify.  Once past the on/off ramps on the north side of I-81, the trail took me into an open field to the east.  Again I elected to forego the rain covers and plodded along with a tree line just ahead.  Unfortunately, that tree line was short-lived and left me exposed again to the elements. I now looked for some sort of cover to stop and don the rain gear.  Within a few minutes I saw a road, Davis Valley Road, as it turned out.  There was a meager tree on the right of the trail just before the road so I decided to stop there and put on the rain gear.  I noticed several cars on the road and one lone guy who I assumed was a hiker.  He called out to me asking if I was a through-hiker.  I responded I was and was dreading carrying on a conversation let alone hiking with someone else.  He said that there were some people up the road who he thought I should talk to.  I was more than a little annoyed but perplexed as I followed him.  As we turned up the street, I was startled to see a dozen police vehicles, ranging from local agencies to national park service, black SUVs with flashing lights, K-9 units, Fish & Wildlife, Virginia State Police and as I walked with (as he introduced himself), Pat, more black SUVs and K-9 units rolled in.  I was introduced to a state trooper and another officer who I assumed was in charge and the teo proceeded to ask me a series of questions, did I know of a hiker calling himself “Sovereign”?, who was I hiking with?  Where was I going?  Where did I come from?  Surprisingly, they didn’t ask for an ID.  They did notice my USS Lapon ballcap though.  So I answered all their questions and explained that although I may not have known Sovereign by trailname, I had spent a few days in Marion and had both seen and met hikers there as well as others along the trail whom I simply did not get the names of.  I asked if they had a photo and the one in charge showed me a mug shot of a guy on his cell phone.  I explained that he still didn’t look familiar.  When I asked what this was all about they just said that there had been an “incident” along the trail.  I asked if they could elaborate and they said no, but there would be more information on the news later.  They then told me that the trail from Partnetship Shelter at VA-16 was shut down through VA-42 Ceres, my destination, due to the manhunt.  When I asked what my options were, they said, well, you’re done hiking for the day so they suggested I walk back up the road to the Exxon station.  I asked if the trail would be open tomorrow and they said, maybe.  So, I walked up the road, a shortcut as it was, to the Exxon.  Before I left though I asked if I could photograph the photo of the guy they were looking for since I was heading back to Marion to which they oblidged.  I was leery to take photos myself as I walked away so I only got a few of the vehicles as I was exiting and two at the trailhead by the interstate.  At the Exxon, after talking to Susan, I called the cab service back to arrange for a ride back to the EconoLodge in Marion. While I waited I talked to a couple different locals who were gassing up asking if they knew what was going on.  They were both oblivious.  I also talked to the Exxon proprietor and although she had noticed the police vehicles, she had not been briefed as to what was going on all around her.  Her station sits at the junction of the AT and I-81, halfway between the two endpoints of the closed off trail area and the search zone.  I showed her the photo and she took a photo of it with her phone.  Ditto for the cab driver when he picked me up.  I could not find any info on Google but when I got back to the EconoLodge some other hikers were out front and as we talked, they told me that through the hiker grapevine, the electronic communication pipeline along the AT, it had been reported that Sovereign had knife-attacked two female hikers and that one had died on the way to the hospital.  The hiker also said that Sovereign had been subdued and was in custody.  I said to explain that to the police dragnet 10 miles up the road.  They said that Sovereign had caused problems at several other locations along the trail in both North Carolina and Tennessee and had actually been arrested for assaulting two female hikers but was released when the hikers refused to stay behind and testify because they didn’t want to delay their hike.  As I checked back into my room, the scuttelbutt was fast and furious amongst the hikers and I wasn’t sure what was truth from fiction so I dropped off my stuff and went to McDonald’s for breakfast.  Marion was now teeming with hikers as they came in off the trail and I talked to two separate groups at McDonald’s, both who had personal contact with Sovereign back on the trail. No one was really sure what was going on.  One did relate that she heard from Laces and that he had been rousted from his tent by armed SWAT agents early in the morning.  I guess I’ll find out more about that from him later up the trail.So I went back to my room and shortly thereafter went to the Mexican restaurant to drink some beer, watch sports and read the paper.  At six I watched the news but the reports they gave Wet scetchy as well.  I called the Hostel I had been intending to stay at and talked to the co-owner Rita.  She explained that the police had woken her at 3:30am and explained the attack and manhunt and that one male had been killed and a female had fought off the attacker but sustained knife wounds to her arms and legs.  I was still trying to line up a shuttle ride for Sunday and had decided I’d just skip today’s section and make it up at some point in the future.  I finally hooked up with Bubba, a shuttle driver, and he’s picking me up at 6:00am and taking me to VA-42 Ceres where I’ll continue north.Still not exactly clear on what transpired but I suppose I’ll find out soon enough.Despite the tragedy, however bad it may turn out to be, prior to this there have been 11 murders along the 2200 miles of the AT since 1974. I’d put that statistic up against any other place in the Country.","Marion

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613467,"Bubba was actually a little early, which is always good, in picking me up this morning at the EconoLodge in Marion.  Hopefully this was my last day there.  Not that it was bad, but I need to move on.
I got Bubba’s information from both David “AWOL” Miller’s 2019 A.T. Guide, which is the most referenced guide on the AT, and the Appalachian Trail Thru-Hiker’s Companion, my preferred guide.  The photos I include of the elevation maps are taken from this guide.  Anyhow, Bubba is a reliable and popular shuttle driver in this area.
So as Bubba and I are driving to VA-42, about a 40 minute drive away, he asks me where I’m from.  “Virginia Beach”, I say.  He goes, “I’m from Virginia Beach!”.  So naturally, I ask, “what high school did you go to?”  “Bayside”, he says.  I told him I went to Kempsville and for those of you reading this who are not familiar with the Virginia Beach school system, these are neighboring rival high schools.  To top that off, his wife went to Kellam, another Virginia Beach high school.  Small world sometimes.  So Bubba and I hit it off right away.  He’s been shuttle driving up here for 9 years now and makes enough throughout 9 months of the hiking season to support the finances.  His wife works at Big Walker Motel in Bland, VA, 3.3 miles off the AT.  Bubba says over the years he’s met hikers from all over the world.  He tells me this story about a German who came over from Germany to hike the AT.  Bubba asks him what brings him to the trail and he says he’s going through a divorce and just needed time away.  He tells Bubba his wife has him “by the short rabbits”.  Bubba at first doesn’t understand and then realizes that through translation, the German has misinterpreted “hare” for “hair”.  It took me a couple seconds to get it.  Pretty funny.  
So at 6:30am Bubba drops me off at a grass parking area off VA-42.  The sky is very overcast and it is still dark outside.  Rain is imminent.  I have 17-miles ahead of me on this Mother’s Day and I know I’m going to get dumped on.  I went ahead and put on my pack cover but held off on my poncho for the time being, hoping “the green tunnel” (the woods) would trap most of the rain.  After I got myself situated, I started into the woods only to find a white blaze on trees going in opposite directions.  Now what?  I wasn’t sure which way to go and Bubba had left. I knew from my elevation chart that I had an immediate uphill climb but you can’t always count on the accuracy of the charts that are in the tenths of miles when trying to make a decision tend of yards apart.  Plus, the elevation chart had a large uphill in one direction and a smaller one in the other.  So, after pondering for a few seconds what to do, I chose the higher elevation direction mainly because my guide showed a higher elevation to the north.  It may sound obvious to the reader, but it is not so easy in the woods.  North is not always north.  The trail wraps in all directions as it makes a circuitous route in a general north-south direction.  So I was plodding along on the trail going uphill and not really confident that I was going the right direction.  It reminded me of the story I told last year about the older guy I crossed paths with who was going the opposite direction as me.  He is directionally challenged and asks me which way he is heading.  I say, “you are going south”.  He says, “are you sure?”, I say “well, I’m 50% sure, because I am going north”. 
I got about a mile into the hike and opened up the maps app on my phone.  By then I could zoom out and it indeed looked like I was going north.  I felt relieved but I still wasn’t 100% and wouldn’t be until I got to my first firm landmark which was to be Knot Maul Branch Shelter, some 2-miles north.  
In the meantime, I was ascending Brushy Mountain, a 537 foot ascent over 8/10 of a mile.  There was a light rain falling through the tree canopy but not enough to warrant my poncho.  I was trying to be as quiet as I could as I hiked on because I figured early in the morning and with no other hikers around to make noise that this might be an great opportunity to spot  bears.  But, I didn’t see any.  I haven’t seen any so far this year.  I guess I have nothing to gripe about.  I saw 9 last year and some people hike the entire AT and never see any. I got to the top of Brushy pretty quick and was feeling really good. No aches/pains.  Now I had a long descent into Lynn Camp Creek.  For those readers not familiar with hiking in the rain, the descents are worse, or less stable, than the ascents because everything is slippery.  The ascents are slippery too, as are the flats, but the descents are precarious dry and really bad wet.  The ascents and descents also require the use of different muscle groups in the legs, hips and buttocks as well as the arms and torso if using trekking poles, so after a while, any terrain gets taxing so one is never really satisfied or comfortable, unless you’re on a flat.  I often look forward to an ascent if I’ve been on a descent for a while and vice-versa.  
So my hike was pretty uneventful as I trekked along and I was not looking forward to Chestnut Ridge.  I was looking forward to putting it behind me but it was gonna be a monster climb and to top things off,in the rain and 7-1/2 miles into today’s hike.  Chestnut Ridge is a 2000 foot ascent over 4-1/2 miles.  There is no flat or down, just varying degrees of up.  A lot of it is switchbacks up the mountain but switchbacks or not, it is up.  Once I got to USFS (US Forest Service Road) 222/VA 625, I knew I was at the base.  Here goes nothing!  There’s almost no way to mentally prepare for a climb except to just go for it.  For me, every step I take is one closer to the top.  I usually dig in with the trekking poles and use my upper body as much as my legs.  I’ve also learned to conserve energy and so I alter my stride and pace, sometimes almost to a crawl but I never stop.  If you stop, lactic acid starts to build up and that only makes it worse.  You gotta just keep going.  I often think of it as a high school cross country workout.  I also look at my watch about every 10 minutes or so  and I look forward to my Runkeeper app (tracks my mileage and pace by GPS) going off every mile and Brigitte, my nickname for the computerized French female voice that spits out statistics to me on Runkeeper, telling me how much distance I’ve covered and therefore how much I still have left.  I also have my elevation chart for the day displayed in a clear arm sleeve, the same type thing quarterbacks use for calling plays in football.  I, for one, like to know what my elevation is going to be like.  Some hikers don’t, they like the surprise, not me, I like to mentally prepare. Quick flashback to Brigitte, I named her that in honor of Brigitte Bardot.  Often this is the only voice I hear throughout my hikes so I look forward to Brigitte talking to me even if she repeats the same 3 or 4 sentences over and over.  “Ooh, you are so fast!”, or “ think of all the croissants now you can eat!”  
When I got to what I thought was the top of Chestnut Ridge, it was not the top.  The forest thinned out and in places it was open meadow but it still went up.  Not as steep, but up.  Still no bear sightings and no critters at all really.  As far as people,  I had only seen one couple, an older man and a girl back about the 4-mile mark and they were heading south.   That was it for people on the trail.  It isn’t as populated as some may rhink.  On the ridge I did see a few bright yellow birds, small, like smaller than a sparrow, but every time I’d try to take a photo they’d fly off.  Come to find out they were American Goldfinches.  I’d never seen them before except in the zoo, pet store or a book.  The other cool bird I saw was about the same size and was black and iridescent dark blue.  Still can’t identify.  At Chestnut Knob Shelter I did pass two women who were slackpacking south.  I didn’t stop and talk but just a few sentences as we passed each other.  At Chestnut Knob I did get a good photo of the neighboring mountains and the valley below.  I also posted photos of the ascent at the top of Chestnut as well as a photo of the cool looking red spotted newt.  I actually saw three of them over about a 100 yards section but I only took the photo of the one.  
After Chestnut I had a brief descent into Walker Gap and then a little ascent and a relative straightaway into Garden Mountain.  Once I cleared Walker Gap I called ahead to Garden Mountain Hostel to inquire about a room and shuttle ride. They were listed as 2.0 miles off the trail where it crosses VA-623.  So good news, they had room and yes, they would pick me up at 623.  It had been raining off and on but nothing too bad.  That all ended with 1-1/4 mile to go.  The skies opened up.  I got dumped on and the poncho didn’t help much.  To top it off, the terrain was mainly large rocks and boulders.  I finally got the 623 at around 2:30pm and called the shuttle.  I stood in the pouring rain for about 15 minutes waiting for him to get there.  
This hostel was really an old farmhouse.  It wasn’t great but it sure beat sleeping outdoors.  I got a shower and changed into dry clothes and after 17 miles just plopped down on a sofa in my room and read, after calling Susan.  I almost dozed off.  It was a pretty uneventful rest of the day.  I ate some of my dehydrated food and read until 9:00 then went to sleep.  The bed was really comfortable.
Total miles, 17.05 in 7 hours 54 minutes with a total elevation climb of 4947 feet. Total trail miles so far, 91.41 in 5 days of hiking with 2 zero days thrown in.  463 miles to get to Harper’s Ferry.","VA-42 Ceres, VA - Mile Marker 557.6
",Garden Mountain,"May 12, Sun",17.12
TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613479,"Rain threatened again for the second day in a row.  I was less concerned today because I knew regardless, I was gonna be at a hotel and a hot shower at the end of the day.  
The hostel proprietor, I never did get his name, dropped me off at VA-623 where he’d picked me up the previous afternoon at 8:15am.  I did my usual pack prep which usually amounts to connecting my I-phone to my power bank so it remains charged the entire hike.  My I-phone then sits in a velcroed arm sleeve so both it and my elevation chart are on my left arm.  My bear spray hangs from my right front shoulder strap for easy access (I’m left handed) and my hand towel, used to be my all-purpose orange bandana but I lost it somewhere in Grayson Highlands, hangs from a carabiner off my left shoulder strap.  I also wear leather fingerless gloves that have reinforced padding in the knuckles and along the back of the hand and in the palm.  They have been awesome to hike with now for going on two years.  
This morning I put my pack cover on, which is nothing more than an elastic-rimmed piece of nylon that fits over the pack so the pack contents don’t get wet. The pack itself, an Osprey, like most packs, is not waterproof.  Everything in my pack is partitioned in dry bags or waterproof bags.  As another layer of protection against rain, I opt for a poncho over a rain suit because the back of the poncho covers the pack so in heavy rains, none of my pack contents ever gets wet.
Anyhow, this morning was not quite a poncho morning but rain was threatening.  
Today’s hike was both shorter than yesterday and looked to be less challenging with only two slight uphill climbs, one after Jenkins Shelter and the other at Laurel Creek.  Despite the idea that the hike is a sight-seeing adventure, a lot of the time is spent in the green tunnel and therefore is little more than a excursion from point A to point B.  You catch sightings of cool flora and fauna as it presents itself and move on.  
So today was all about speed and getting to Wytheville.  The plan was, and is, to wrap up today and stay at the Bolling Wilson Hotel in downtown Wytheville, if you can call it a downtown.  Wytheville’s pretty small but larger than Marion, VA.  Tuesday was to be a zero day to do laundry and catch up on the journal and other “chores” (e-mail, phone calls, etc.), Wednesday would be a slackpack 18-mile hike and then back to the hotel.  Thursday I’ll pick up my rental car from Enterprise and drive the 55 miles (not the 100+ serpentining miles of the AT) back to Damascus to the Old Mill Inn where I’d made reservations a year ago for Trail Days weekend.  Then drive back to Wytheville on Monday, turn in the rental car and hike 15 or so miles north.
So today’s hike, like I said, was relatively easy with after a short mile flat to Davis Farm took me almost 3-1/2 miles into a descent into Jenkins Shelter.  I passed one young guy going south at about the 4-mile mark and through Jenkins, he’s the only person I saw.  Again, no bears it any critters so far besides squirrels, birds and the occasional chipmunk.  After Jenkins I had a relatively flat speed hike section to Brushy Mountain.  Sound familiar?  Come to find out, aside from Brushy Mountain at mile 558.5, there’s another one at mile 583.3.  I looked on the Internet and there are many “Brushy Mountain” references in Virginia.  Come on, Virginia!, get creative! So once stop Brushy II, that led me to the quick plunge into and out of VA-615, Laurel Creek.  Around that time I caught up with a northbounder, an elderly (older than me) solo male hiker who I passed on an uphill and quickly distanced.  In light of what happened with the publicized attack on Saturday, I am more inclined to do that now, blow by people and not say much.  I’m in this for the hike, not to make friends.  After Laurel I had an easy up of about 1.3 miles and then 3-miles of easy rolling before a dip and rise into US-52.  It rained 3 times, each for short stints, and I only donned the poncho for the 2nd and 3rd one, the third one being as I neared UD-52.  I called Bubba 3-miles out at 1:55pm and we arranged for him to meet me at 3:10pm at US-52.  At that point I knew what my pace was averaging and now the race was on.  Who could get to US-52 quicker, me or Bubba? I only lost once to a shuttle driver last year.  I got to US52 at 2:45pm, granted it was actually 2.43 miles and not 3 like I thought, but I would have smoked Bubba anyhow.  There were two other hikers, a young man and woman, also waiting for Bubba when I got there.  They were awaiting a ride to the Bland post office.  Bubba showed up right on time.  He dropped them at the post office then drove me the 15 or so miles into Wytheville to the Bolling Wilson Hotel.  On the way we passed the hotel his wife works at, The Big Walker Motel.  Bubba also updated me on the trail murder, more on that later, and some of the oddball and/or unsavory characters he’s had the dubious pleasure of shuttling around the AT.  So once at the hotel, it was 3:30pm,  I checked in and took a really long shower.  Had to use conditioner on my mane.  Afterwards I went across the street to  Moondog Pizza and got a large plus a pitcher of Sweetwater beer.  I ate all but three slices of the pizza but drank all the beer.  Afterwards I dropped stuff off at the hotel and walked down the street to 7 Dogs Brewery, drank more liquid carbohydrates, read the paper, updated/amended my hike plan and watched a rerun of the SEC Track & Field Championships.  I then went back to the hotel and stopped in there lounge for another beer and as they closed went with a group, including the employees, to a really cool old tavern, the 1776 Log House.  The woodwork was extraordinary!!  The bar area itself is surrounded by wood beams hand hewn back in the late 18th century.  Really cool.  Anyhow, I got to know pretty much everyone in the place and as we closed it down at 1:00am, two women, one an employee at Moondogs and another of the the hotel, drove me the 1/4 mile back to the hotel and dropped me off for the nightSo that wraps up another day.  15.43 miles hiked in 6 hours and 26 minutes with a total elevation climb of 2942 feet. Total trail miles now at 106.84.  Tomorrow’s a “zero” day in Wytheville.  Looking forward to sleeping late then chores, mainly laundry!!","Garden Mountain

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613488,"A nice zero day after humping 33 miles over two days in and out of the rain.  I looked forward to Wytheville, a small town/city I first became acquainted with 10 years ago when I picked up a contract doing service work for Channel One TV.  Channel One is, or was, a satellite-based educational medium for transmitting teen formatted news and educational videos to students in subscriber districts throughout the United States.  I supported them for about 9 months by responding to various tech service calls throughout Virginia, West Virginia, Washington, DC and parts of North Carolina, Maryland and Pennsylvania.  I used to take off every Monday in a van full of equipment and travel a prearranged route I had mapped out and return late Friday or early Saturday and turn around Monday and do it all over again.  It may sound rough, and it was at times, but the great part was I got to see parts of my own state that I never would have ever imagined going to, like Wytheville, 10 years ago, to Scott Memorial Middle School.  The rewarding part of it all is I was able to restore or bring a much-needed educational medium to a group of kids.  That was very rewarding.  At Scott in particular, I recall working on the satellite antenna on the roof over the library and enjoying the skyline view of the mountains in the distance.  Here I am 10 years later hiking those very same mountains.
So the fact that Wytheville is my short-term hiatus is not by happenstance.  
I started the day by rising at a late-ish 8:30am.  I threw on my “city” clothes and asked the front desk where I could get breakfast, something I don’t normally eat except for coffee and a grapefruit or a oatmeal on occasion.  I’ve been craving McDonald’s Egg McMuffin meals lately, I’m sure it is my brain telling me what nutrients I need, so I set off on a mile walk to McDonald’s uptown.  After breakfast I walked back to the hotel and gathered my laundry and set off on another not-so-Long 1/2 mile walk to the local laundromat.  That didn’t take long and by the time I left it was a little after noon so I decided to stop by the local VFW/American Legion Post I had seen on a backstreet yesterday.  
The VFW Hall was not open but the American Legion door was open so I went in and it was really just a great hall, like a bingo room.  There was an older guy in there and I talked to him a few minutes.  He had just washed and waxed the floor and was waiting for it to dry.  He had served in the army in Vietnam, having the dubious timing to arrive just in time for the Tet Offensive.  He got out of the army in the early 1970’s but re-enlisted in the late 1970’s and later served in both Gulf wars finally retiring after a 32 year career.  Funny the people you happenstance meet.  
So I left American Legion and dropped off my laundry at my room then strolled across the street to Moon Dogs to update the journal.  After a few beers and 4 hours of journal I went back to the hotel, unloaded more stuff and now at hotel bar at 7:00pm updating yet again and previewing tomorrow’s slack pack day.Talked to a sales guy sitting next to me on travel in Blacksburg.  Lady in other side of him overheard us talking and she is from Virginia Beach as well.  Dates a Navy SEAL.  Small world yet again.
Bubba is picking me up at 7:00am and I have 18-miles of hiking.  I’m slack packing as I am coming back to the same hotel.  Bubba will pick me up in the afternoon at Trent’s Grocery and drive me the 25 miles back to Bolling Wilson Hotel.  Since I’m slackpacking and it looks to be a pretty smooth trek, I’m looking forward to a stress workout.  My guess is I’ll be done in about 7-1/2 hours so I should be back in Wytheville by 3:30, counting travel time.  Thursday I head to Damascus.
So that’s it for now.  No late night out carbo-replenishing.  Gotta get my rest.  That’s boring but oh well.  Good night to all until tomorrow.","Wytheville

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613568,"I got up at 5:45am this morning and repacked my pack for a slack day, so minimal gear.  Basically fluids, a little jerky and dehydrated vegetables/fruit and a first aid kit.  Bubba was supposed to pick me up at 7:00 and at 7:02 I called him.  He had mistaken a text he got that he thought was from me saying I didn’t need a ride.  He came right away and picked me up around 7:25am. We bounced Bayside High names off each other the whole ride to US-52.
Bubba dropped me off at 7:45am and I talked for a bit with two other hikers who were waiting at Brushy Mountain Outpost, right on the trail on the corner of US-52 and Wyrick Trail Road, for the place to open so they could get breakfast.  The one guy’s name was Roy and he was an Army vet from Morehead City, NC.  The other guy was “Catch 22” and he was from somewhere out in California.  He is a triple crowner already, meaning he has hiked the three longest trails, the three being the Pacific Crest Trail at 2654 miles, the Continental Divide Trail at 3100 miles and the AT at 2184 miles.  Although the shortest he, and most people, consider the AT the toughest.  So here he is again doing the AT.  I was the “youngster” of the three of us at 59.  They were both in their mid-60’s.  
I left them at 7:59am and started off on the next leg.  The first mile was paved road along US-52 and then Kimberling Rd. as the trail went over I-77.  Finally it cut into the woods at Kimberling Creek and continued a slight descent until 1.7 miles where it went up about 500 feet over 1/2 mile to Helvey’s Mill Shelter.  For the next 7 miles the trail was relatively flat, neither rising or falling more than 200 feet at any given segment. I saw one other joker scrolling on his I-phone at at about mile 3, other than he, I did not see anyone else over the 18-mile day.  I was disappointed in not seeing any bears or snakes either.  In fact I didn’t see any critters except for some birds.
At VA-611, mile marker 600 on the AT, I encountered my first hill of the day, going up Brushy Mountain but it was only about 350 feet over 6/10 of a mile.  I then had a nice 2.7 mile gradual descent to VA-608 at Lickskillet Hollow and then another ascent up Brushy Mountain of about 800 feet over 2 miles so it was really gradual and pretty easy.  Once up on Brushy I had about a 2-mile flat section before the last 2-mile descent into VA-606 along Kimberling Creek and then a 1/2 mile walk to Trent’s Grocery where I called Bubba to come get me.  He was only 10 minutes away as it turned out.  
I crossed Kimberling Creek on an interesting suspension bridge that swayed while crossing it.  I added a photos of it as well as a photo of one of the overlooks.
Trent’s had a visitor’s log so when I signed in I noticed that about a dozen hikers had passed through today prior to me.  The manager on duty said they were in two groups.  There may have been more people actually on the trail who didn’t opt to stop at Trent’s but probably not many since it is a hotspot to grab food and resupply just off the trail. 
So Bubba picked me up about 2:45 and by 3:30 I was back at the hotel in Wytheville and cleaned up and walking across the street to Moon Dog’s to update my journal and read the paper.  I noticed my Garmin registered 42,625 steps so far today.
So now it is 6:24 and I’ll close for now and catch up the rest of the night later.  
So, stats-wise I did 18.11 miles today in 6 hours and 34 minutes.  I’ve now logged 124.95 miles since May 6 in 7 days of hiking and 10 days overall.  Today’s elevation climb was 3267 feet.  So 429 miles to Harper’s Ferry.  Tomorrow though I pick a rental car just up the street and drive to Damascus for Trail Days on Friday-Saturday-Sunday then drive back to Wytheville and resume the hike!
To wrap up Wednesday night, I had told Austin, one of the cooks at Moon Dogs, that I was craving a steak and looking to go over to the Bolling Wilson Hotel restaurant for one but she suggested 1776 Log House so I took her advice and walked there.  I ran into Jack there, the local from Monday night.  He, Austin and Brooke (a waitress at the hotel restaurant) hung out there on Monday.  So Jack and I sat talking for a couple hours.  Austin and Brooke were supposed to show up but never made it.  I had a really good streak and then talked to some other locals about the trail and finally left to go back the hotel around 11;00pm.  I watched a little Fox News and crashed for the night.","US-52 - Bastian and Bland, VA

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613652,"I got up today at 8:30 and packed my stuff.  I then got a coffee and walked the 8/10 of a mile to Enterprise car rental to pick up the SUV I’d reserved to drive back to Damascus for Trail Days (www.traildays.us). The SUV wasn’t ready when I got there so i walked to a local Hardee’s for coffee and orange juice.  It still wasn’t ready so I walked back to the hotel to check out and told Enterprise to come pick me up when it was ready.  I intended to eat an early lunch at Moon Dog’s but they didn’t open until 11:00.  I got over there at 10:55 and Austin and another cook were out front on a bench so I talked to them and then walked in with them when it did open.  Just then my phone rang and it was Enterprise letting me know a Jeep was ready so they were driving over.  So I skipped the early lunch and went back to the hotel to wait out front.  Amy from Enterprise showed up about 15 minutes later.  I dropped he off at Enterprise and began the hour drive back to Damascus.  When I got into town, hikers were already converging on the tiny town for the 4-day festival.  I checked into Old Mill Inn, got my backpack of “city clothes” I had left with them and went to my room and changed out of hiking gear and into shorts, a cotton t-shirt and Reefs.  I then walked down the road to 7 Trails for lunch but stopped along the way to talk to one of the authors in town.  He writes a lot of guidebooks.  I forgot his name so I’ll have to edit this later.  At 7 Trails I had a burger and fries and talked to Joe Picone “Pinecone”, who has a House here but is from the Kent County area near Williamsburg. Now I’m sitting at the outdoor patio bar, watching baseball, talking to hikers and waiting for the band to begin playing from the parking lot venue.  Should be a good 4-day fest 
So I’m catching this up Friday evening.  
I ended up hanging out at 7 Trails until 9:30pm.  I ate 3/4 of a large pizza while hanging out with Joe and several of the other locals he introduced me to.  
I had the book, a Column of Fire by Ken Follett with me.  It is the third book in the Pillars of the Earth trilogy.  It actually just came out last year and Susan and I are reading it.  I had about 250 pages to go when I set out on the AT so I packed it with my city clothes.  So as I had it in front of me at 7 Trails, several people commented on it having read Follett.  Kevin, the 7 Trails bartender from my stay in town on Monday May 6 came in just as I was getting ready to leave and commented as well on the book, having read Pillars and book 2 of the trilogy, World Without End.  So that prolonged my stay a good 1/2 hour talking with Kevin and some other locals.  
I had also expressed to Joe that although I’m here for Trail Days, I don’t want to sit around all day and drink beer (for four days straight).  I said I wanted to do some other physical stuff in the mornings then I’d fell better about drinking beer all evening.  So Joe suggested biking the Virginia Creeper Trail.  A lot of visitors to Damascus will take the van ride to the top of Whitetop Mountain and bike the 17 miles down.  I said I’d rather bike up and then down.  So that became my plan for Friday morning.
I walked on back to the Old Mill Inn at 9:30 and then watched the World Track Relay Championships on TV until midnight and fell asleep.","Wytheville

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613834,"I had coffee and orange juice at the Old Mill Inn and then packed my backpack (not my hiking pack) with water, ID, cash, a towel and that was about it and walked up the street to Sun Dog rentals.  My intent was to rent a bike and ride to the top of Whitetop Mountain on the Virginia Creeper Trail and back to Damascus.  This would be a round trip of some 34 miles.  
It was around 9:15am and the sky was more than overcast, it was dark with rain clouds so precipitation was imminent and it was just a matter of time.  Rain I can deal with, I was just hoping there wouldn’t be lightning, particularly since I was going up a mountain.  
So I got to Sun Dog and rented the bike, a seven-speed mountain bike, then rearranged my stuff, putting on my leather hiking gloves,my ballcap, and my I-phone sleeve holder.  I didn’t have biking shoes but the camp shoes I had, really a pair of lace less water shoes, worked well.  As I started out the door beside two van loads of tourist bikers it started to rain.  It wasn’t a light drizzle but a steady rain.  I resituated my backpack and windbreaker so that the windbreaker was over the backpack and I set off up the trail.  Where the van loads of tourists were being driven the 17-miles to the top of Whitetop Mountain so they could coast and meander down, I was cycling up and then cycling down.  I had been told that it can take 2-1/2 to 3 hours to peddle up and 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 hours to peddle down.  I was determined to test that, rain or not.
The gravel and dirt trail was fairly flat for the first couple of miles, it seemed like, and that helped me get my “biking legs”. It also has some 20+wooden bridges to cross.  I was averaging just about 10 miles per hour, or 6-minute miles right away and that kept up for the first 10 miles where I made a mistake by taking the wrong fork in the trail.  I went nearly 1/2 mile out of my way before I realized it and had to turn around and ride the 1/2 mile back to the main trail.  I then began a slightly steeper ascent.  The trail up to that time had been rising but it felt pretty slight.  At some point the rain really started coming down hard but I just kept peddling away.  At least it wasn’t hot and despite being completely wet and getting muddy by the minute, I was cooled off.  I passed no one else on the trail, neither ascending nor descending.  
Where the trail had been ascending 30-40-50-60 feet every mile through 12 miles with an occasional spike to 90-130 feet, during the 13th mile it increased to 130-179 feet per mile and stayed like that through the top.  I had pretty much kept the bike in 3rd gear most of the way and only towards the end had to downshift to 1st.  The bike skipped 2nd gear and that pretty much sucked.  While 160 feet of rise per mile may not be overly strenuous for avid bikers, it was getting taxing, not exhausting, on me, particularly since I’m not a biker.  About 1-1/2 miles from the top a guy cruised by means disappeared.  Obviously, to me, an avid biker. When I got to the top I talked to him for a bit and he confirmed my suspicions. He was mapping out an alternative trail back and after a few minutes of small talk we each set off.  I had also passed over the last 6 miles many of the bikers who were driven to the top and only going down.  I knew going down I was going to be passing many if not all of them and after the cardio workout I, I was looking forward to a sheer speed workout down, muddy course or not.  The rain had stopped after only about a 25 minute downpour so we were all fortunate to have breaking clouds and no rain to ride in.  
I set off going down the mountain in 5th gear and that quickly changed to 7th and I was flying down the mountain, it seemed to me, at first 8 then quickly 17 then 18-1/2 miles an hour.  Seems slow thinking about it but on a mountain bike coming off a mountain on a muddy wet trail it sure felt fast.  I had to navigate around slower bikers pretty much the entire way and some were not well-versed in the biker etiquette of moving over to the right despite me yelling it to them “ON YOUR LEFT!!  Some, the New Englanders I suspect, were directionally challenged and would move to the left in front of me instead of to the right.  I almost lost it at top speed having to go off-trail into the weeds around a biker but all was well and  I was back on trail and on down the mountain before they realized what was happening.  
I made it down and hit the flat-to-low downhill section and knew I was only three or four miles out of Damascus and Sun Dog.  I realized that I wasn’t going to break an hour on the descent so while not easing it in I did slow down some.  I had done the total descent and in 5th through 7th gear, and probably 90% of it in 6-7th.  
So I turned in the bike and got an employee to take a few photos of me.  I was pretty muddy.  As I was leaving on foot to go back to Old Mill to get cleaned up I was reviewing my Runkeeper stats, I had set it for biking, and I had a total time of 3:02:03 when I subtracted for my 1-mile error.  So I’d made it up in 1:54:32 and down in 1:07:31.  Being a stats guy I was pretty pleased with that and curious as to what the fastest up and down times are but I haven’t found out yet.  I know I am not but I like putting my achievements in perspective. 
I got cleaned up and walked to 7 Trails for a late lunch and to read more of A Column of Fire.  While at 7 Trails I talked with countless locals and several hikers. One local couple were Mikey and Julie.  Julie has seen my book and was asking about it.  She had read Pillars of the Earth but hadn’t realized that book 3 of the trilogy was out.  They live close by in Tennessee and we’re out for a Friday night in “the big city” of Damascus.  They lived on 21 acres but until they moved into their new house that Mikey had built by himself, they had not had indoor plumbing, a refrigerator or a bathroom.  Julie showed me photos of the house and now she had a complete kitchen complete with a full size refrigerator and they had a bathroom too.  They didn’t have a tv but said they had raised their kids without one and didn’t feel the need or want for one now.  They finally left at one point but 20 minutes later walked back in.  We talked again for about another hour on all sorts of things.  They turned me onto several books to add to my list.  So after several hours of talk, refreshments and listening to the bands play and walked on back to the Old Mill Inn and watched late night track and field, this time the Diamond League meet from Doha, Qatar, and read more of the book before crashing out at 1:00am.","Damascus

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613940,"I woke up at 6:30am and fiddled around in my room before going to breakfast at the Damascus Diner around the corner.  I don’t normally eat breakfast but once in a while I indulge.  This morning I opted for scrambled eggs, bacon and pancakes plus coffee and orange juice.  Once I again I was asked by a fellow hiker sitting next to me about A Column of Fire.  So we talked about books and hiking while I ate. 
After breakfast I stopped to talk to the author I’d spoken to on Thursday and I bought two books from him.  Then I went to my room to grab water and then drove to The Great Channels, a wildlife preserve about 45 minutes away outside Abingdon, Va.   Joe has told me about them on Thursday so today’s workout was going to be the hike from the parking area to them and back.  To describe The Channels briefly, they are a natural sandstone monolithic formation that create a maze of passageways between, under and around the giant boulders.  
It took me about 45 minutes to drive there and the last several miles were up a pretty windy country road.  I got stuck behind 3 other vehicles otherwise I’d have tested out the handling of the rental Jeep Grand Cherokee I had.  As it turned out, the three vehicles in front of me all turned into the smallish Channels parking lot.  I navigated into the last spot, changed into my Salomon trail shoes and started out.  The 3-mile trail up is listed as moderate in difficulty, misty uphill and with relatively steep 20-30% grades at places. I hadn’t brought my trekking poles but I figured for such a short hike I didn’t really need them.  A group of four teen-to-twenty-year olds took off ahead of me and I was about 50 yards behind them but 1/2 way up they stopped for water and rest and I passed them and kept going.  Three miles up I reached the top.  I descended into the labyrinth and explored the many passageways and dead ends going from one end to the other.  Once I had my fill and took several photos, I thought, I Hope I can find my way out of here.  No one else was there when I was exploring and no one else showed up until I was leaving so that was pretty nice to have the entire 20 acre place to myself.  I climbed on top of the great rock expanse after wandering below and took several photos of the surrounding mountains and valleys.  Then, as with Whitetop but without a bike, I made the rapid 3-mile descent back to the parking lot passing several groups on the way.
I drove back down the mountain and I had no cars in front of me so the 7 or so mile drive down the windy road was a fast and fun descent.  I then went back for the Inn and got cleaned up then decided to wander through tent city and all the equipment vendor displays.  That didn’t take long and I then walked on down the Virginia Creeper Trail towards the 7 Trails Grill.  By the way, the Virginia Creeper Trail is not named for a plant.  It is named for a locomotive that used to run between Abingdon, VA and the top of Whitetop Mountain, a 68-mile round trip. The locomotive used to “creep” up the mountain, hence the name.  I forgot to mention that on my walk to 7 Trails, the hikers were lining up for the parade.  Each year what they do is walk Main Street in Damascus from one end to the other, about a mile, lined up according to class.  The earliest hikers this year were the class of 1980 and then chronologically the other classes file in behind.  Tradition is that they wear outlandish garb and they used to squirt people, particularly law enforcement, with squirt guns but that quit several years ago.  Some people didn’t like getting hit with squirt guns I heard.
At 7 Trails the afternoon band was already playing so I settled in to what had become my usual corner spot at the outdoor bar, ate a grilled chicken sandwich lunch and had a beer, and 2, and 3, ...  they were Michelob Ultras though, since I decided that was better for me if I was going to hang out, socialize and drink beer for several hours.  
Once I again I began meeting a slew of new people, both hikers and locals.  Right when I sat down the young lady to my right began talking to me.  She was visiting her boyfriend who was hiking the trail.  Shortly thereafter he came in and we talked about our different hiking experiences.  To my left a guy began talking to me and it turns out he was a DC lawyer, got fed up with the rat race, quit and sold everything and moved back to his childhood town in nearby Tennessee.  What he wants to do is represent the CBD growers that are sprouting up in the Tri-State area.  Because of the discrepancies between federal law and the state laws of North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia, there’s opportunities for legal representation in this area of the country where the three states come together.  Anyhow, we talked on and on about hiking, cannibis, law and politics.  We got off politics pretty quick and just enjoyed the afternoon, the beer and the bands.  
A man and a woman at some point ended up to my immediate left and she started asking me about the trail.  She was thinking of hiking it and was interested in any pointers I could give her.  I told her there were plenty of real experts all around who had hiked he entire trail several times over but I’d be happy to share my experiences.  So I answered her questions and concerns until their dinner came and they went to sit at a table. So many people were coming and going that I was losing track of all the conversations I had had and was continuing to have.  Joe showed up at some point because he said he was driving by and saw me.  I caught him up on my exploits over the past couple days and he said he wasn’t hanging out because he was driving back down to New Kent County early Sunday morning.  David from Sun Dog Outfitters came in and was standing to my right drinking a beer and a rather big muscular guy came on m and was next to him facing me (where the bar takes a 90 degree turn).  He overheard me say Virginia Beach and said he was from Chesapeake.  So we all began talking and come to find out, this was the well-known hiker “Wolf”, not the Wolf who had shuttled me on May 6, but another Wolf.  Now he knew Wolf the shuttle driver and said he was really the original “Lone Wolf”.  Anyhow, Wolf is getting ready to get out of the Army and he’s hiked the AT 5 times, all prior to him coming in the Army.  We must have talked for over an hour about all his hiking experiences and it was pretty impressive considering he’s over 6 feet tall and a muscular 230 lbs. (I had asked him what he weighed).  He hiked ultra-light with a 10-12 pound small pack and to make the AT tougher, hiked it in the winter at least once.  Not for me!!  We’ll catch up back in Hampton Roads.  
Again, I lost track of how many people I talked to and as I’d get ready to leave some Damascus friend would stroll in.  It get like I’d known a lot of these people for years yet it’d been just days.  Eventually the bands ended and things were winding down so I finally did cash out and leave, walking back to the Old Mill Inn.  As previously, I winded down by reading and watching late night TV, again track and field, my sport, and finally crashing around 1:00am again.  Nice long day!!","Damascus

Then I walked over to 7 Trails where I still am and drank beer, caught up on the journal, talked to some local friends and enjoyed local bluegrass players all afternoon.7 Trails Grill closed early at 6:00pm since Trail Days was over.  That was fine by me.  I ordered a pizza to go and walked back to the Inn.  On the way I stopped in for a 1/2 gallon of Rocky Road ice cream at the Dollar Store.  I’m my room I ate 1/2 the pizza and about a third of the ice cream and watched a couple episodes of Peter Gunn, the old 1960’s detective series.  Then I watched more track and field, this time the Diamond League meet from Shanghai.  I also finished my book so I’ll leave it behind for someone else to enjoy.

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614062,"Now that Trail Days is over it is time to get focused back on the hike and the next major destination, which is probably Waynesboro. I didn’t get up particularly early, just before 8:00am.  After getting cleaned up I laid all my stuff out on the bed and separated things to be shipped home from hiking stuff.  I then put all the stuff to go home in that backpack and my hiking gear in my hiking backpack.  Since I finished my book and Susan and I each have a copy, she had a great idea and suggested Inleave mine here so I wrote a little something in it and took it to 7 Trails, since so many patrons there had asked me about it.  After checking out of the Inn, I got a box for my backpack from SunDog Outfitters and then mailed it to my office.  I then got a coffee and drove to Wytheville and ate some leftover pizza for breakfast along the way.  I called Bubba about 15 minutes out of Wytheville and he agreed to meet me at Enterprise at 11:20am.  I got there a little early, 11:05, dropped off the rental and waited for Bubba.  He picked me up around 11:35 and drove me to the trail junction near Trent’s Grocery and I got started again on the trail at 12:20pm.  So everything worked out well throughout  the weekend and transitioning back out on the AT.  My first 9 miles were fairly flat-to-rolling so I was cruising through them pretty quickly and easily.  Then I hit Sugar Run Mountain and the 1000 foot ascent over 2 miles took the wind out of my sails.  I was still making good time overall I just had to take my time and not stop going uphill.  The last 4 miles were mainly down but over rocks mainly so that didn’t speed things up.  All in all a nice hike, nice weather, no bears or snakes but I did pass two packs just off the trail (I guess their owners were off getting water), then two hikers at a campsite and a little further on, around mile 4.5, 2 make hikers taking a break at a bridge.  Other than them I didn’t see anyone.  I got into WoodsHole at 6:05pm.  There were no more rooms or bunkhouse spaces left so I was relegated to tent space.  SonInset up my hammock-tent and then went to dinner with the large group of 24 or so hikers.  After that I got a shower and now I’m catching up this journal at 9:40pm lying in my hammock.Off to Pearisburg tomorrow.  Goodnight to all.","Trent’s Grocery

I passed one guy going the other way.  I think he was out for a run because he was dressed for it and he had no gear.  Further down I passed a man and woman going up, probably to Angel’s Rest, and a little while later a lady listening to an e-book as she went up the mountain. When I got down the mountain and into the junction with VA-100 at noon, I called Don Rains, a shuttle driver Bubba had recommended.  We arranged to meet at 1:45 at VA-641, Clendennin Rd.  I thought I had 4-miles to go but it was really a little more than that at 4.15 but I still made it to the point at 1:35, so 10 minutes early, and beat the driver there, a trend I strive to maintain.More later, my driver is here...","Woodshole Hostel

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614289,"In a sense I wasn’t looking forward to today’s hike.  It was the distance that gave me trepidation and I dreaded 5:30am coming.  22.7 (calculated) miles is a long way, period.  The reason for the high-mileage day is because I wanted to get to VA-613, Mountain Lake Rd, which would put me 5-miles from Mountain Lake Lodge, and that’s where I wanted to stay.  Besides it being a nice resort, it also was one of the sites for the filming of Dirty Dancing and Mountain Lake is one of only two natural lakes in Virginia ( Lake Drummond being the other).  I didn’t know either.
In the morning I had plenty of time to soak in the last two pounds of my 4 pound bag of Epsom Salts (works wonders).  I then packed all my gear and made 6 small sandwiches using the last of my Hawaiian King rolls, roast beef and turkey from the day before.  I wolfed those down then started on my journal update while awaiting my ride.  Don was scheduled to show up at 7:00am and he was right on time so I had to cut the journal short.  I’ll catch up on it tomorrow when I have more time.  As I’m writing this it is 10:35pm and I gotta get up around 6:30am plus I’m fading fast.  
So on the drive, Don was concerned about my next pick-up point.  He didn’t think the hotel shuttle drivers would have easy access to get me since the gravel road often washes out and even four-wheel drives have problems with it at times. I had talked to the hotel the day before though and they said that yes, they could get me there.  Don was also concerned about cell coverage.  It is very spotty along that segment of the AT and often not available at all.  At worse, I was gonna have a 5-mile walk, or hike, tacked on to the end of my 22.7 mile AT hike to get to the Mountain Lake Lodge.
I had calculated that I would get to the end of today’s hike by 5:11pm.  I know that seems pretty precise but I needed to know where I’d be when because the lodge quits running shuttle at 5:00pm unless specific arrangements are made.  They open at 9:00am and since I had not firmed up pick-up plans the previous day, I was going to have to call from the trail.  
What helped with my time is Fon dropped me off at 7:15am and I got started right away but I had calculated a 7:30am start so I was already up fifteen minutes.  
My first 3.3 miles was a 1250 foot rise which suited me fine.  Better to have a rise first thing in the morning when fresh as opposed to later in the day.  The worst part of it all was that the weather report from the previous day had called for warm temps and clear skies.  Well, up this mountain to Rice Field Shelter was anything but.  The wind seemed to come out of nowhere about 1/2 way up and with it the temperature dropped.  I had just my compression shorts on and my Ragnar short sleeve tech t-shirt so I was feeling it.  At first it felt good, cooling me off, then it got to the point where I almost stopped and put on long pants and a windbreaker, but, I didn’t want to stop and figured over the mountain the wind would die down.  As I hiked, I thought about what I had learned in Meteorology class about wind, that it is a differential in pressure and that the greater the differential and the shorter the distance, the stronger the wind and that the wind always blows from a higher pressure area to a lower.  Thinking about it kept my mind occupied as I trekked to the top.  Once up to Rice Field it was really billowing!  I had a great view of the surrounding mountains and the valley below so I got up on a big rock near the edge and took some photos.  As I was leaving, one of the hikers who had spent the night at the Shelter merged onto the trail right after me.  Now I felt the need to pick up my pace and distance myself.  I don’t like leading and I don’t like following, I just like hiking alone, plus I’m competitive so here was another “competition”.  I glanced back around turns and never saw the other hiker.  
My intent was to take fluids at either 5-10-15-20 miles or 6-12-18, depending on how I felt.  I was also judging fluid by the upcoming ascents and preferred to drink early if it meant carrying less weight up a mountain.  Every pound counts and at roughly 1 pound for every 16 ounces, Inwas toting 4 pounds.  
Once I got past Rice Field and back into the woods, the woods helped to block most of the wind, so that was nice.  Most of the next 3 miles was through a meadow that was enclosed by trees and had little rise/fall so I was able to pour on the speed.  Once I got to 5-miles I was on a roll so I just kept going.  At 6-miles I was determined to stop no matter how I felt so after 6 I was looking for a good place to stop.  I prefer a large log or rock so I have something to set my pack on.  I didn’t find a suitable one until 6.7 miles and as I was drinking water and electrolyte, the other hiker went by me.  He looked to be in his early 20’s and now I wondered if I could catch him.  After I got my pack back on and set off on pursuit, he was out-of-sight, and it remained that way the rest of the day.  So, I don’t know if he just outdistanced me, turned off on a side trail (usually water supplies are off side trails), or stopped at a shelter along the way to meet friends, eat, or any number of other reasons.  
Once I got to the top of Peters Mountain at mile 12.3, I figured that line hiker was gone.  On the mountain though I passed two guys who had stopped for fluids and a women going southbound.  Within a mile after that I passed a lone male hiker going north and a lone female going south.  
Next I had a 3-mile 1400 descent of Peters Mountain into Stony Creek Valley and except for one small hill hiccup at mile 13 made great time coming down.  I was an hour ahead of my projected time at mile 16.3 so I figured I’d still be able to call the lodge before the shuttle service ended at 5:00 even if I had to hike to the end and then call.  
By the way, on Peters Mountain I saw AT snake #5 and first one this year, a small garter snake.  It cut through some rocks across the trail so I never got a photo.  But, I also saw snake #2 this year and sixth overall later on on the hike, a larger garter snake, and I did get photos.  That one too was crossing the trail.  I’m convinced that practically the only way to see snakes on the AT is if they are crossing the trail, unless one is at a shelter or off trail looking for them.  They hang out at the shelters because rodents are at the shelters and rodents are at the shelters because hikers with food hang out at the shelters which is another reason I don’t like shelters.  
Still no bear sightings this year though so snakes are catching up.  Bear sightings overall 9, snakes 6.  
After the flats through Dismal Branch I thought I’d have smooth sailing until the end but the ascent of the south side of Wind Rock ruined that.  It’s 1250 feet over two miles and it was rough going.  I was a hurting unit through all of it but I pushed on, did not stop, although I was taking small steps, and eventually made it to the top.  From there I only had what looked like a 3.3 mile trek across a relatively smooth section with a few rises but nothing severe.  What I did not know is that all thee miles is through a boulder field.  Boulders make even little rises feel larger and the downs are no cakewalk.  I had passed another hiker on the steep ascent of the mountain but he caught back up in the boulder field because I had pulled out my cell and was trying to call the lodge.  I only had one bar though so despite repeated tries I couldn’t get through.  I then hiked the boulder field with my cell in my left hand and my two trekking poles in my right glancing at the bars periodically.  Not recommended.  Sort of like driving and texting.  I didn’t do that very long and after several attempts to call again when I’d get two bars, I had lost precious time but had an idea.  What if I can text?  Do I texted Susan with the number, the trail/road intersection and asked her to call the lodge and tell them Inam a registered guest, which I was having made reservations on-line the night before, and that I would be at the junction at 4:45, giving myself what I thought was plenty of time.  In the meantime, an Aussie male passed me.  I started hiking again and heard my phone beep telling me my text had been sent.  Shortly thereafter I heard it beep for an incoming text and it was from Susan and she was able to call the lodge and arrange the pick-up.  That was great so now I could just navigate the rocks and boulders and just get there.  I passed the Aussie and the other guy with 1.2 miles to go.  They had stopped to get water from a small trickle cutting through the rocks across the trail.  At 4:28pm I made it to the junction.  Once again, I beat the shuttle drivers!  I sat down and drank the last of my water and waited.  In the meantime both the other hikers walked past and I spoke to each briefly.  One was heading to a shelter 5-miles further and the Aussie wasn’t sure how much further he was going.  The boulders ate his feet up.  At 4:47pm my shuttle showed up.  Yea!  It was a lodge van and I’m surprised it made it along the gravel road because on the return trip there were several areas where the rain had washed deep and wide rugs across it.  It was slow going but we made it to the lodge a little after 5.  I was pretty tired and sweaty so after check-in I took a nice hot shower then went to the hotel tavern for a steak dinner and a few beers, or, painkillers.  I left the tavern at 9:30 and have been working on this journal since.  So, for the day, 22.44 miles in 9 hours and 14 minutes of hiking and a total elevation rise of 5398 feet!!  Only 14-miles tomorrow and I’m slack packing at that so I should be back at the lodge by 3:00 and I’ll catch up gaps in Monday and Tuesday’s journal and catch up on the photos as well.Until then...","VA-641 - Clendennin Rd

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614363,"Well, today was supposed to be a slack pack easy 14-miler, and for the most part it was.  Sunny skies, no rain, “easy” course, but no cell service!!  How much we rely on technology today, even when trekking “the wilderness”.  20 short years ago AT hikers would have been appalled at my “complaining” of no cell service.  A mere 65 years ago AT legends like Grandma Gatewood, at 68 years old and a great-grandmother, probably would have said, “suck it up buttercup and quit whining”, and she would have been completely right.  But, more on my intro as today’s journey plays out.
I slept really really well and woke up completely refreshed and ready to go at 6:30am.  I loaded my pack with just a windbreaker, my poncho, 32 oz of water (1/2 normal) and my two 16 oz bottles of electrolyte.  That’s all I took besides my usual standards, my power pack, my baggy with money, credit card, ID, health card, hotel key, my jerky baggy, my gummie energy gels, my pen, my mini-Leatherman and of course, my comb.  All in all my pack weighed 10 pounds.  Great weight for a slack pack day considering my normal pack weight is 30 pounds.  
So after packing, I went to breakfast, something I rarely do, and I was too early, they didn’t open until 7:30 and my shuttle driver was showing up at 8:00 and it was maybe 7:15 so I just waited.  Once They opened I ordered two scrambled eggs and two pancakes along with orange juice and coffee and wolfed it all down.  I walked out and within maybe 3 minutes my driver, Joe, showed up.  
Joe and I talked during the 5-mile, 30-minute drive to the AT junction.  It took so long because this back gravel and dirt road is washed out in places and even if it weren’t, there’s no way one could drive more that maybe 15mph along it.  As it turns out, Joe has lived in and around Giles County, Virginia for 32 years.  He and his wife are avid hunters of virtually all game so we talked bears.  Long and short he told me to keep doing what I’m doing.  Chances are I wouldn’t see too many if any in Giles because the natural food sources are lacking right now so they have probably moved elsewhere.  BUT, Joe did say to let him know later if I saw any signs of bear activity during my hike.  At some point during our conversation, Joe says, “is that a bear?”, referring to something crossing the gravel road some 200 yards ahead.  I totally missed it yet he saw something moving. Quickly he corrects himself and speculates that it is instead a turkey and sure enough, 10 seconds later we drive by and there’s a wild turkey, with a lame leg, hobbling off to the left into the woods.  So I picked Joe’s brain on not only bears but mountain lions, bobcats, boars, snakes, anything I could think of.  He told me a story about a rattlesnake that had taken up residence in his grandfather’s barn when he was younger. Joe had to go out and kill it because they had cattle and dogs that frequented that barn and they couldn’t take the chance of any of them getting bit.  Joe said he chopped off its head with a hoe and afterward he counted 12 rattles and estimated its girth equivalent to his bicep.  That snake must have chowed down on a lot of barn rodents.  Joe concurred with what I had learned elsewhere and seen myself in that snakes want nothing to do with humans so just leave them alone and they’ll leave you alone.  Besides that, they can sense vibration so they can “feel” one’s presence approaching and will try to get out of the way.  Like I said before, the only ones I’ve seen on the trail are ones crossing it.  
So Joe dropped me off at the AT junction at 8:30 and I quickly got myself situated and was off at 8:34am.  
According to my elevation guide, I had a flat beginning 3 miles and then a big downhill but I don’t take things for granted anymore.  Sometimes, the flats turn out to be over boulders, as it was yesterday, or through any number of other encumbering circumstances.  Today was pleasantly different.  The terrain was actually dirt with some rocks and roots thrown in and I was able to really speed along, all the while hopeful of a bear or rattlesnake or copperhead sighting.  I kept looking way ahead on the path so I could divert my footstep attention to the distance on either side for bears or into the rotting logs and brush beside the path for snakes.  No such luck though.  
After 2.7 miles of relative flats, the trail took a dive for 3.4 miles off of the north side of Wind Rock and 2000 feet into Johns Creek Valley at USFS 156 and mile 669 of the AT.  I was concerned that the trail may be full of obstacles as previous downhills often are but I was again pleasantly surprised that it was mainly dirt and with a slack pack, Infelt like Inwas almost able to trot or run down it.  I made great time and once at the gap, after only 5.7 total miles I was 15 minutes up on my initial estimated time.  
As Sting says in “St. Augustine In Hell” off of the Ten Summoner’s Tales album, “okay, break’s over!!”  Now I had a monster climb, 1750 feet over 2.1 miles which looked benign at first, but under closer examination began with a steep 350 feet rise over just 2/10 of a mile then sort of mellowed out over the next 1.6 miles rising about 900 feet but ended with a 500 foot climb in just 4/10 of a mile.  That last section was killer!!!  There was a fire road, 601, right before that last climb and two vehicles were parked there.  As I trekked by I noticed the one van had Connecticut plates and an older guy surprised me, I didn’t realize anyone was sitting in it, and he asked if I’d like an ice-cold drink.  I declined and said that I did not want to stop and allow lactic acid to build up besides, I was good on fluids.  Trail magic is where you least expect it.  
By the way, I had passed a solo male hiker going south early on and three young 20-ish hikers, 2 guys and a girl, hanging out by a small bridge in Johns Creek Valley.  
So as I began that last steep ascent, I was drenched in sweat and I could glance up and see maybe 80 yards ahead and all I saw was a wide gravel and dirt rutted path that went, well, UP!  As I got to a temporary landmark and could see around the bend all I saw was more of the same, UP.  Over and over this continued and in hindsight I didn’t realize  how far 4/10 of a mile is when it is at a 23% grade.  Most treadmills maybe go half that steep!!  I didn’t stop though and  plowed over the top and onward.  (after finishing for the day and looking at my computer stats, I covered the mile that that hill was a portion of in 26:40, which I was really surprised by.  In fact, I covered the first 500 feet in 26:19, the next 500 feet in 26:00 and the final 670 feet in 26:40).  I was slack packing though at at that time I had taken fluids so my pack weight was maybe 6-8 pounds.  After all that I passed the 9-mile mark along a much-needed flat section along the top and was relieved that I only had 6 more miles to go for the day and it wasn’t quite noon yet.  I quickly recovered and my legs and body were feeling great! One more mile and I get my second fluid break, although I wasn’t thirsty or parched after sweating out that climb, I knew I needed it.  So at 10 miles I took 2 minutes and gulped down both just water and then electrolyte mix and put my pack back on and took off.  I had a long 3-mile basically descent into Sinking Creek Valley and the junction with VA-42 where I’d call my shuttle, being only a mile from my pick-up point.  I’ll break here for the night since it is 11:30 pm and I gotta get up early and do an 18-miler tomorrow.  I’ve got a 13-miler on Saturday and a 20-miler on Sunday and then a zero day on Monday so if I don’t get things caught up over the weekend, I’ll fill in the blanks on my zero day in Daleville, Va, outside Roanoke.Until then...","Va-613 Mountain Lake Rd

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614432,"First off, I may have said this previously but going forward with my journal, here’s what I’m going to do.  I’ll write what I write and in the event I forget things or leave a day’s entry incomplete, instead of going back and filling it in, I’ll just add what I missed on the day I enter it in the journal and refer to the day the event occurred on.  In most cases, I won’t do an update on previous days until I have a zero day because it takes enough time already just to add the journal entry for the given day while things are still fresh in my head.  
So today was very eventful.  I probably took more photos today than all of the other days this year combined.
I started the day by getting up at 6:30am, I actually woke up to the alarm clock next door at 5:30 and went back to sleep. I slept very well, all through the night, something I rarely do.  
I organized all my gear and re-packed it all accordingly.  I then walked over to the main building at Mountain Lake Lodge and went to breakfast.  Same as yesterday.  Coffee, orange juice, 2 scrambled eggs and 2 pancakes.  At 8:00am Joe showed up right on time.  He drove me the 30-minute drive over to VA-630 in Sinking Creek.  I picked his brain on hunting and the nature of critters the whole way.  At 8:34am I set off on the day’s hike after the usual preliminaries:  pulling my leather fingerless gloves on, sliding my map sleeve up my left arm and connecting my I-phone to my power pack and making sure it is actually charging it.  
Beautiful sunny day to hike with no rain in the forecast except for a brief period around 2:00.  My biggest concern was the forecasted heat and humidity.  Nothing I could do about any of that so I set off.
I had forgotten that my guide mentioned this big 300 year old oak tree on the trail right after the start of this segment.  As I hiked through a brief section of woods I came to a fence line and as I was passing through there was this tree on the other side and I thought, that’s one huge tree trunk!  Then I remembered, so I stopped and there was a small wooden placard that read, The Keffer Oak.  Story is this is the largest oak tree on the AT in the south.  It’s girth was last measured at 18 feet 3 inches!  It is estimated to be over 300 years old.  Think about that.  1719. What was going on in southwestern Virginia in 1719?  This tree has been through it all.  Only the Dover Oak in New York is slightly larger as far as oaks on the AT.  Of course, I took several photos and they will all appear on the photo page of the journal.  It really is a majestic tree.  As I hiked on I kept looking back at it.  Simply beautiful and majestic.  
Right after Keffer I had to wade through a field of waist-high hay, at least I think it was hay.  If it wasn’t I’m sure someone reading this will correct me when you see those photos as well.  I kept my trekking poles out in front of me as I made my way through the field for two reasons, one, if any ticks were on the grass hopefully the poles would knock them off and two, if any snakes were lurking about hopefully they would strike at the poles instead of me.  It also helps clear the path from overhanging stalks of grass so I can see where I’m walking and don’t unintentionally step on something I’ll regret, like a snake.  
So as I trekked on in the early stages, I kept thinking that according to the elevation guide, I was supposed to be navigating a rather steep climb up the southern side of Sinking Creek Mountain.  I was some 1/2 mile in and so far this big meadow was easy.  I knew the big climb was coming though.  By Big I mean steep, as in 800 feet over 8/10 of a mile.  That may not seem steep to some but with a 30-pound pack it was steep to me.  Good thing, and I was prepared for this, it was first thing in the morning and I knew after this I had one more major climb later in the day over the total 18 miles.  
Once I did hit the major slope up, I decided to just go really easy.  Easier than I had on other climbs.  I figured today I would meander and not be in a hurry as long as I got to my pick-up spot by 6:00pm.  I didn’t know how long they’d be running shuttle but I didn’t want to push my luck.  As it was it took me 34 minutes to go up the initial 600 feet but that included the Keefer Oak and about a half dozen photo pauses of it and a couple other notable things in the photo section.  I was happy with that.  I did the next roughly 800 feet up to the top in 48 minutes.  I know I said the initial climb was 800 feet and what I just said doesn’t add up but what I didn’t say was that after the “steep” initial climb, I still had another 600 feet of elevation to go.  It makes more sense if you look at the chart so I’ll try to remember to put a photo of that in.  
I was feeling great at the top and looking forward to a long day knowing that first climb was behind me.  I saw more hikers than usual today, so much so that in retrospect I know I’ll leave people out so I’ll just mention the ones that stand out. At about 3-1/2 miles in I passed a guy who was talking on his phone.  Shortly after that I saw  guy standing on a rock overlook so I went to check it out and realized it was a guy I passed in the boulder field 2 days ago.  As we chatted briefly I could make out a European accent, perhaps German or Austrian.  I didn’t get into it with him as we both hit the main trail again along with the guy who had been on the phone.  I took the lead and in about 3 minutes I had separation.  At this point I was on a relatively flat section of the mountaintop (at least as the trail goes) and I cruised for 3-miles.  I took my first fluid break at six miles, right before I was going into the northern descent off of Sinking Creek Mountain.  My thoughts were to take fluid stops at either 5-10-15 or 6-12 and then have the remainder at 18 while I waited for the shuttle.  So I was feeling good having waited and taking my first at 6.  
The 3-mile down was not what I expected and instead of a narrow dirt path took the hikers out to the edge of the mountain, which view-wise was great for a change, but much of it was walking along rock face expanses at angles probably ranging from 20-45 degrees with the drop off into whatever on the right.  Trees really, and then the depths of whatever.  I trusted my Salomons and was able to trek right across each and every time.  I never slipped.  I even went left further up a rock face because I could tell it would put me at the pinnacle of the ridge line and I thought I could get some great photos of the mountains surrounding.  I did, then I had to shimmy back down the rock face to the trail, only about 20 feet, but still, going up seems easier than coming down.  
Just prior to the rock face hiking I had passed two more solo male hikers and a female solo hiker. The female I talked to very briefly as she was taking photos of an overlook as I came out to it myself to get a look.  I’m not sure how she handled the slanted rock face since I never saw her again.  
A few things about female hikers I’ve observed and speculated on, and I may be completely wrong, but one, they have a higher threshold for pain (innate given they bear children) so they tend to motor on when a lot of hikers struggle with a given section; two, they seem more focus-driven, so they may be going fast or slow, it doesn’t matter, but they are getting to where they want to be by the end of their day; three, given that most of the ones I’ve crossed paths with seem generally fit, either thin runner-type builds or muscular stocky, (I’ll catch hell from my field hockey friends, but yes, stocky) field hockey women; and lastly, that those fit women mostly weigh less than guys so all the anatomical/physiological benefits of lighter body weight while traversing mountains is a plus.  Maybe I’m full of it and don’t know what I’m talking about but I’ve observed plenty of women by themselves on the AT and they can definitely hold their own, if not moreso.
So back to the hike.  The six-mile point happens to be at the precipice of the descent down the northern side of Sinking Creek Mountain.  That descent goes on for nearly 4-miles into Craig Creek Valley.  I wasn’t sure what the terrain would be like since my chart doesn’t tell me that but it dropped about 1800 feet. 
Another cool thing about Sinking Creek Mountain.  It is listed as the northernmost spot where the AT crosses part of the continental divide.  So, water draining off the western side flow into the Mississippi River and eventually the Gulf of Mexico.  Water draining off the eastern side flow into the James River and eventually the Atlantic Ocean.  
So shortly after I made the descent off of Sinking Creek northside, I passed two male hikers and a female who were hanging out by a bridge and rehydrating.  I didn’t say much but just cruised by.  30-minutes or so after that I was motoring along and I heard branches break off to my right so I stopped for a second to see what it might be.  A bear?  Right after that I heard something behind me and as I’ve said before, I don’t tend to get passed so it startled me but it turned out to be a 20-ish male thru-hiker and he was making better speed than me and eased on by.  He heard the branches crackle as well but we never identified what caused it.  About 20-minutes after that I was stopped dead in my tracks when I spotted a 4-foot long timber rattler that had just crossed the trail left to right.  It’s tail end was still on the right edge of the trail and it had stopped moving altogether, probably because it felt the vibrations of my footfalls and was trying to assess the situation.  Well, I had no intent to rock it’s world.  It remained calm while I snapped off a series of photos, almost like it knew I was photographing it.  I eased around the back end of it and to the north side of the trail and took more photos before parting ways with it.  I was elated to have finally seen a rattlesnake. Nearly 700 miles of AT and my first venomous snake.  I counted between 10-12 segments of the rattle so I take it that means this snake is 10-12 years old.  It was not a “fat” snake but maybe 2-3” in diameter, so smallish by timber rattler standards as I’ve been told.  Beautiful snake though.
As I was nearing the ascent of Brushy Mountain and leaving Craig Creek Valley, I was looking up at the impending ridge line and for a moment took my eyes off the trail, something I rarely do while walking and for the reason I’m about to describe.  As I looked back down I was surprised by the tail end of a 5-foot long black snake that was still crossing the trail right to left.  I came about a foot from a stepping on it.  I stopped and took a series of photos of it as it made its way through the brush on the left of the trail, pretty much ignoring and seemingly oblivious of me.  So, my third black snake in two days.  
I do not know if this is true or not but I’ve heard that black snakes put off pheromones that venomous snakes can’t stand so they maintain a wide margin.  If that’s true then seeing a black snake, besides the fact that they dine on vermin like rodents, are indeed a good species to have around.
Brushy Mountain south is about a 1500 foot ascent over two miles, so not an easy climb.  To make matters worse, a lot of it towards the top half is exposed to the sun.  The day was already hot and humid and I was 11-12 miles into it when I came to this last major climb of the day.    I held my own on the lower half but the second half sapped me quickly.  I was really dragging and about 1/2 mile from the top I had to stop and take more fluids.  That seemed to do little good and I trudged on finally reaching the top.
Now Brushy Mountain is well known around here for a sad event that occurred here back in the 1970’s.
On May 28, 1971, a private plane in which Audie Murphy was a passenger slammed into  Brushy Mountain in conditions of rain, fog and poor visability.  The pilot and all four passengers were killed. Atop Brushy Mountain is a memorial to Audie Murphy maybe 30 yards off the trail.  So I stopped and took some photos, read the inscription and visited the vista overlook just beyond.
Thanks called the Four Pines Hostel as previously discussed from the top of the mountain because there is little-to-no cell service in the area otherwise.  It was 3:11pm so I told them to pick me up at the VA-620 AT junction, Trout Creek, at 5:00.  That have me plenty of time to make it down the last 3.8 miles of the mountain.  
On my way to meet the shuttle, I got to thinking about how little I like staying at the hostels. They are slightly better than camping.  As I’ve said, I prefer a Marriott.  So I thought I’d ask the shuttle driver if they ran shuttle simply to support the hostel or if the shuttling was as a business in itself?  If so, I wanted the driver to take me into Roanoke to the Holiday Inn many Tanglewood Mall.  I was familiar with the area from doing satellite system support work up here 10 years ago.  I did not care that Roanoke is 24 miles away.  If the shuttle people are business-minded, then there must be a cost in mind that would get me to Roanoke as opposed to their hostel.
Well, a little after 5:00 the shuttle arrived and I made my pitch.  The driver agreed and 45 minutes and $60 later Inwas being let out at the Holiday Inn Tanglewood Mall.  He agreed to pick me up at 7:15 the next morning for Saturday’s hike.  I had called to make my reservations en-route so once I got to the hotel I checked in and proceeded to take a hot shower and change clothes.  By this time it was 7:30 so I watched Jeopardy and then walked about 300 yards up the street to Buffalo Wild Wings for beer and food.  I sat in there playing trivia and updating the journal but lost track of time and before I knew it it was 1:00am and I had the shuttle coming at 7:15.  So I went back to the hotel and crashed for the night.So, my totals for the day were 18.47 miles hiked in 7 hours and 55 minutes.  The total elevation climb for the day was 3647 feet.  So far this year, since May 6, I have hiked 212.6 miles of the AT in 12 hiking days.  Combined with last year, I have now completed 695.5 miles (minus the 12.4 miles I have to make up near Atkins because of the murder) of the AT, or nearly 1/3.","VA-630 Sinking Creek

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614552,"NatureBoi, my shuttle driver, arrived right on time at 7:15am.  NatureBoi is from Maine and has hiked portions of the trail and theoughout Maine for years.  He moved to this area and has worked at the 4 Pines for a couple years, mainly as the primary shuttle driver.
He had another hiker with him, a 60-ish gentleman from New England as well.  We stopped at Dunkin‘ Donuts on the way to my drop-off point and I got a coffee and Boston Creme-filled chocolate donut.  
Today was going to be relatively short at 14 miles and I’d have the touristy Dragon’s Tooth to visit 5 miles in.  
So NatureBoi dropped me off at Trout Creek at 8:10am and I was pretty much off right away.  I had a long steady climb straight away up Cove Mountain.  That’s 1400 feet over 5.5 miles and culminates with The Dragon’s Tooth monolith about 150 yards down a blue-blaze side trail.  Dragon’s Tooth is a natural rock formation that juts up out of the landscape on the edge of the mountain, hence, dragon’s tooth.
There were about 15 tourists/hikers there when I got there and I used this opportunity to take my first fluid break.  I also decided to take my time today and just enjoy things, no hurry.  I took off my pack and drank and then I noticed a 50-ish guy photographing a younger guy with Dragon’s Tooth as a backdrop.  I offered to take a photo of both of them and they reciprocated.  We talked for several minutes after that and they are father/son just out enjoying Dragon’s Tooth and McAfee Knob, the most popular spot on the AT, 15 miles north.  The Dad thanked me for my service (I was wearing, and always hike with, my USS Lapon SSN-661 ballcap.  I asked if he served and he said yes, he was about to retire from the Army.  It turns out he is from the Richmond area.  His 21-year old son is out from Colorado.  So after talking with them I headed on north and off the mountain.  The initial hike down is a lot of hand-over-hand, so it turned out to not be such a bad thing that I had forgotten my trekking poles in the hotel room and was hiking today without support.  Kinda like getting used to training wheels and then riding a bike for the first time without them, mentally and somewhat physically.  
There were a lot of people making their way both up and down the rockface from the Dragon’s Tooth parking area 2.5 miles downtrail to the top.  What surprised me some was that many of them had no fluids or one 16 oz bottle of soda or water.  That’s for a 5-mile round trip which up the mountain and back is no easy task particularly on a hot humid day like today was, around 88 in the shade.  
Soon after I started down I stoped to talk to a family, 2 grandparents, 2 parents and 3 children.  They had seen my bear spray and asked me about it.  Again I got thanked for my service and while the dad didn’t serve the granddad did, in the National Guard.  So we talked a bit about bears and snakes and l gave them some pointers and how to traverse the rocks up, which is easier, but also their return trip down which is more difficult.  
About to get dropped off Sunday morning for a 20-miler so I’ll wrap this up later this evening.
So, it is Memorial Day Monday and A zero day for me!  I’ve got about ten things on my “to do” list, several which I’m already doing or have done this morning.  I bought this antibacterial/antifingal spray to spray on my pack, particularly the straps and backplate which absorbs most of my sweat throughout each day.  So, first thing this morning is I emptied my pack of everything, sprayed it inside and out and now it is drying by the window in my room.  I’m also doing laundry.  After those clothes are all done I have a new bottle of permethrin to respray all of my clothes and my pack.  That stuff works wonders.  I have not had a tick even on me in now over 700 miles of hiking this year and last.  I also am not bothered by mosquitoes, flies and other insects.  Permithrin effects their nervous system and pretty much kills them right away so I guess they sense it and back off.  It chemically bonds to the fabric so it lasts through some 1/2 dozen washes.  The other things on my agenda today are to get online and pay some routine bills, tend to some minor cuts/scrapes, mainly on my legs, with neosporin, soak at least 10 minutes in my Epsom Salt bath ( before the neosporin), that stuff works wonders too, answer e-mails, set up a ride back to Daleville, where I got off the trail, for tomorrow morning, lay out my hike plan for the next four days, and last but not least, update both the narrative and photo sections of my journal.
So back to Saturday’s hike and the descent from Dragon’s Tooth.  The first 1/2 mile or so is nothing but rock.  In a couple sections the park service has installed rungs into the rock to help people get up and down, that’s how steep it can be.  So, trekking poles don’t do any good and you’ve got to use your hands to, in my case, get down.  After about 1/2 mile it gets easier as it is more trail the next 2-miles to the VA-624, Newport Rd junction.  For me that was mile 8 from Trout Creek so 6 miles from my destination of VA-311, Catawba.  
So while descending along the trail I passed many people going in Both directions, as it was a Saturday and besides thru-hikers there were many weekend hikers out and Dragon’s Toothis a popular spot.  So a guy a little younger than me hiking with his two daughters sees my submarine ballcap and says he served on three submarines.  He rattled them off but I’ve since forgotten.  So he asks if I served with Pete Flannery, I said yes, he was my second C.O., I know him well and we still keep in touch, both of us living in Virginia Beach and with him being President of the Hampton Roads Navy Submarine League and me being President of the USS Lapon Association.  He says he worked with Pete while Pete was Commodore of Submarine Squadron 8 in Norfolk.  So, even along the AT you run into people that are that one or two degree of separation from someone you know! 
After that I ran into a AT ranger and we talked for a while.  I noticed he had a couple radio systems on him and we talked about satellite communications, my area of expertise, and his job along the trail. He asked my destination for the day and when I told him he says, oh, you’ve got sawtooth coming up but it’s all relatively easy from here on.  Sawtooth? I didn’t see that in my guide.  Well, I figured out pretty quickly why they call it sawtooth.  The trail from about mile 706, just after crossing VA-785, Blacksburg Rd, is a series of small ups and downs for the 3-1/2 miles to VA-311.  On an elevation chart it really looks like no big deal.  Well, hiking it is a slight deal as you think oh, I’ve got this level and/or slight downhill to go and then you go up.  Then you go down and think, oh, I’ve got this level and/or slight downhill...for 3-1/2 miles!  To end a 14-mile day it can sap you.
So when I got 1-1/2 miles out from 311, I texted NatureBoi and told him I’d be there at the junction parking lot at 3:00pm.  He texted back and said he was on his way.  I got there a few minutes early and without the tree cover it was blazing hot, in the mid-90’s.  I took off my pack and finished off the last of my electrolyte mix and the last of my water while I waited. The parking lot was full of cars as weekenders made the trek 4.5 miles north to McAfee’s Knob.  I would be making that trek on Sunday.So NatureBoi picked me up and he had a male and female hiker riding along.  I think they were staying at the 4 Pines Hostel and just wanted to break the boredom by going for a ride.  It seemed like a long ride back to civilization but I was soon at the Holiday Inn-Tanglewood Mall, my temporary home.  After getting cleaned up I didn’t want chicken wings a second day in a row, a surprise to those who know me because I think I could live off of just chicken wings, and there was a sushi place a few doors down.  So after stopping into Food Lion for a couple of Hershey chocolate bars for later, I stopped by the Sushi place but they didn’t open until 5:00 and it was only 4:40.  So I went on to BWW and drank several Bud Lights instead and caught up on Saturday sports.  I was thinking, here it is 4:45pm and I’m all clean, drinking a beer and watching sports and 2 hours ago I was trekking through the AT wilderness all nasty and tired.  I’m so fortunate to be able to stay at a hotel and not have to camp out, although a lot of the AT folks prefer that.  So I think I had theee tall beers and then went to the Sushi place.  I got it to go and ate in my room.  I just relaxed for a while then around 7:30 I was still hungry so I went to the hotel lounge and ordered a steak dinner with vegetables and rice, trying to eat healthy for at least a day.  I do keep up with my vitamins, by the way.  So I drank iced tea and hung out in there until 10:00 and then called it a night knowing I had a 20-miler tomorrow...","VA-620 - Trout Creek, VA

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614666,"I had another great night of sleep, and a few more hours than the previous night at 7 and after getting up at 6:30am, and getting my gear ready, I was picked up by NatireBoi at 7:15, just as planned.  Since I was slackpacking again today but it was for 20-miles, I only had my jerky, my energy gummies, my mini-Leatherman, my Sharpie, my Spacepen and my Sawyer water filtration system in my pack.  Since it was supposed to be a sunny and hot day in the mid-90’s, I also pre-filled my water bottle about 3/4 full, so 48 oz,and both my electrolyte  bottles, each 16oz, were full.  
When NatureBoi dropped me off at the parking lot off of 311, I saw the European Hiker I’d seen over the past few days getting ready to head north as well.  We spoke briefly and I found out he was originally from Krakow, Poland, not Germany or Austria.  I’m terrible at placing accents.  He currently lived and worked out of Long Island, NY and he was taking his time thru-hiking.  Well, with 20 miles to go for the day I was going to take it easy, particularly with the first of two climbs right away, the 4-mile ascent to McAfee’s Knob, the most photographed and popular spot on the entire AT.  It being Sunday, Memorial Day weekend and a nice sunny day, there were loads of people on the trail up.  
The hike up was really uneventful and I didn’t expect to see any wildlife of note, considering all the people,and I didn’t.  So the first nearly 4-miles were just a pedestrian climb of 1200 feet past Johns Spring Shelter at mile 710.3 and Catawba Mountain Shelter at mile 711.3.  
Once at the top, I was a little surprised because McAfee was not really marked, there was a sign that said “overlook”, and it was only about 20 yards up on a side or blueblaze trail.  Once on the overlook there was no mistaking that this was McAfee.  The rock outcrop is very unique and the view is breathtaking for 180 degrees and for 10’s if not 100 or more miles distant.  There were maybe 25 people at McAfee, some day-hikers and some AT thru-hikers.  The lady who had been in the van with me yesterday was there so I asked her to do the honors and take my McAfee photo.  Despite how close I look to the edge and the abyss below, the angle is deceiving and I am perfectly safe a good three feet from the actual edge.  I returned the favor and took photos of her on the rim as well.  I didn’t stay long on McAfee as I had a long day so I took my pack off and took fluids for the first time, took some additional photos and then started back along the trail.
From McAfee the trail descends about 700 feet over a mile and then goes into a rollercoaster of ups and downs for three miles into Brickey’s Gap before climbing for 1-mile and 700 feet to the Tinker Cliffs Ridge.  From Tinker you can look back across the valley and see where you just came from, McAfee Knob, and the ridgeline you just trekked across.  It is deceiving in that it seems so far and yet it is only a 5.5 mile hiking distance.  
So after more photos on Tinker Cliffs, so named because apparently Revolutionary War deserters hid out there and repaired pots and pans, hence, “Tinker”, I continued the northward journey.  I screwed up not paying attention and missed a hairpin turn in the trail assuming it went out over these rocks.  When I quickly realized it did not I turned around and went back the 10 yards or so I had gone and when I saw the white blaze I took it.  I knew I should be going downhill, and steeply, but the slight uphill I just took as a momentary rise before he fall.  When I got to the norther section of Tinker Cliffs again and recognized people I had ppreviously passed, I knew I had gone south on the trail instead of north and quickly turned around.  All in all it was a 1/2 mile round trip error.  Oh well, what are you gonna do, but pay better attention?  At Tinker I was nearly halfway through the 20 miles at 9.5.  Due to the heat I had worked out an option with NatureBoi and if the going got tough I could always take. Side trail at 10 miles and cut over to a road after the 3-mile side trail and get picked up.  I was feeling great though and after taking more fluids on Tinker I was determined to continue on to the full 20 miles and Daleville.  The descent from Tinker includes Scorched Earth Gap, the Andy Layne Trailhead, Lambert’s Meadow and Sawmill Run.  Well, while cruising through the relative flats of Lambert’s, I saw my first beat of the year and tenth overall.  It was smallish, so maybe a two or three year old, and off to my right about 30 degrees and about 50 yards away.  It never heard me but was nosing around in the sparsely- populated trees and brush for something to eat.  I leaned my trekking poles against my body and quickly took out my I-phone.  I shot off several photos, a first fornany bears I’d seen, and then switched to video and began filming it.  The bear was making its way up the gentle slope to the trail about 40 yards ahead of me.  As it got to the trail I was moving toward it slowly to try and get some better footage and I stepped on a twig.  As it snapped the bear immediately took off up the left slope and over the top.  Well, at least I got the photos and video.  I don’t know if I can post the video on my journal but I’ll try.  
After that I was hiking ultra-quietly and looking all over for bears in hopes of seeing more, but I did not, nor any snakes.
So after Lambert’s I had 8 more miles to go and the trail has a diminishing series of ups and downs before a gentle downslope into Daleville.  I didn’t see very many people the rest of the way and got into Daleville and the US-220 junction at 4:35.  
There was an Exxon station there and I had texted NatureBoi a mile out so when I got to Exxon he texted back that he was 5 minutes away.  Once again, I beat my shuttle driver.  I went into the Exxon mini-mart and got a 16oz Diet Coke I had been craving for 7 miles, even more than beer, a 16oz Gatorade and a 16 oz water. I drank them all down in quick succession on the ride back to Holiday Inn I’m Roanoke.
Once back at the hotel I quickly got cleaned up and was on my way over to BWW for some food and beer.  I looked at my watch and it was 5:30.  Wow, less than an hour ago I was hot, sweaty, tired and trekking the last few tenths of a mile through the woods.
So at B-dubs I ate wings and fries and celery and carrots and drank three tall Bud Lights again before leaving there and stopping at Food Lion.  There I got my favorite ice cream, Edy’s Double Fudge Brownie, a rosemary olive oil Artisan loaf of bread and four bananas.  I went back to my room and watched more of the Coca Cola 600 then started watching some mindless movie and enjoyed bread and ice cream and bananas and ice cream.  When my assault was over, 2/3 of the 1/2 gallon of ice cream along with two bananas and 1/2 the loaf were gone. I felt great!!  I fell asleep watching the movie around 9;30pm.So, for the day I did what worked out to 20.8 miles in 8 hours and 49 minutes for a total elevation climb of 3753 feet.  Yesterday was 13.54 miles in 6 hours and 42 minutes with a climb total of 3461 feet.  My totals now are 246.94 miles on 14 days of hiking and I am at mile marker 729 on the AT.  I have 295 miles until Harper’s Ferry and I’ve got until June 12 to get there because I fly from Norfolk to New Orléans on June 13 for my submarine reunion.  In six miles I link up to the Blue Ridge Parkway.  The AT parallels the BRP and later Skyline Drive for 200 miles so the hiking gets easier as one heads north through Virginia.  So will I make it to Harper’s Ferry??  I don’t know, it’s just a goal but better to have a goa that will challenge you than one that is too easy to achieve.  I expect to get some 25+ mile days ahead of me and maybe even a 30+ miler or two on some of the easier stretches.  As long as my body holds up I’m good to go. Right now everything is in good working order and the future looks bright!More to follow tomorrow...","VA-311, Catawba, VA

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614692,"I got all my to-do list things done today so I went to B-Dubs again for lunch, t plan out the next week and I watched UVA beat Yale for the NCAA lacrosse title.
Now I’m back in my room so here are several updates or miscellaneous tidbits:
I don’t know if I mentioned it previously but Joe, my driver to/from Mountain Lake Lodge told me that when it rains hard in the mountains, bears tend to lie down.  That’s because their most acute senses, smell and hearing, are negatively effected, and with poor eyesight they are, in a sense, senseless.
To offset dehydration, eat mustard.  Joe carries several mustard packets when out hunting.
A tablespoon of vinegar will ward off pesky insects.
Trains, cars and lawnmowers and dogs can be heard for many miles through the woods and mountains.  
Last week I heard regular  trains passing at mile 4 in a hike.  At mile 12 I crossed the railroad tracks finally after listening to the trains coming and going for 4 hours.  I heard them for another 3 hours as I completed the day’s hike.
Cars are usually a welcome noise because it means a road is near but if it is an interstate or major highway the sound can carry for many miles.
Unbeknownst to me there is a military flight pattern near Pearisburg, Va.  I could hear jets overhead for a few days and it reminded me of home and the jets flying in and out of Oceana.  But on one day, I think it was going up Brush Mountain, a jet flew particularly low and buzzed the mountaintop startling the heck out of me and my peaceful walk with nature.  I looked it up as soon as I could and found that the reasonable explanation is that Air Force F15E aircraft routinely fly out of Seymour Johnson AFB in North Carolina and over and around Smith Mountain Lake.  While Smith Mountain Lake is not in Pearisburg it is the most likely scenario for jets that may have a wide flight pattern.
Songs - don’t get the wrong one stuck in your head or it may be difficult-to-impossible to change the channel.  For some reason, I hiked for three days with either Olivia Newton-John’s “Hopelessly Devoted To You” and Diane Renay’s “Navy Blue” stick in rewind, mainly the latter.  What made things worse is I don’t even know the correct words so I was playing the tune knowing I had the words wrong over and over.  I still don’t know how or why it was that song.  It came out in 1964 and I haven’t heard it in decades, until now.
Also, songs play in your head on the background regardless of what else you are thinking of.  
Lastly, some may ask why I decided to hike the AT.  Well, several reasons.  
I first became aware of the AT in 1990 or 91 when Mike Ellis and his girlfriend Linda hiked it.  Mike and I knew each other through high school cross country at Kempsville High School.  Mike and Linda hiked the AT at the right time for a thru-hike.  Mike was relatively young at 28 and had just come out of the navy.  Hiking the AT had been in the back of my mind ever since.  So finally last year I decided to just do it. Once I decided I told as many people as I, that way I couldn’t back out. Then I read 13 AT books and two bear books to get educated and I trained by hiking over 500 miles before beginning.
So what do I get out of it or what motivates me?
1.  Because it is there.  It passes through my own back yard of Virginia and traverses 2100+ miles from Georgia to Maine.  It is a major challenge for anyone.2.  It is a physical challenge and at 58, now 59, I can’t think of too many undertakings that would allow me to push myself and my body to their limits.3.  It is an overall body workout.  It stresses not only the body but the mind and it is euphoric to set a goal and hit it and/or to see just what one’s body can do.4.  I find it a great compliment to my long distance running.  Hiking also seems to “work out” the nagging injuries and trouble spots my body has dealt with through running.  My feet get twisted and torqued yet my Morton’s neuroma I’m both feet is pretty much a non-issue.  My knees, while in good physical condition, suffer mildly from “runner’s knee”, a precursor to arthritis, yet hiking actually abates it.  I can only assume that the stress of hiking works the joints to the point where it strengthens them.  “Use it or lose it”, I suppose.5.  I’m losing weight and getting my body toned in all the right places.  When Intan in high school and college I weighed 140 lbs.  In the navy I weighed 150 lbs.  My optimal marathon weight seemed to be around 158 lbs.  Well, in my late 50’s my weight has hovered around 180-195 lbs.  I’d like to get back to or close to my 158 marathon weight so the AT helps get me there.  6.  I’m outdoors and seeing and visiting places I would not otherwise ever see.  Besides the flora and fauna of nature, I get to visit and stay at places and towns like Hot Springs, North Carolina, Helen, Georgia and Mountain Lake Resort in Virginia.  I get to experience bears, owls, rattlesnakes and orange spotted newts.  I never even knew there were orange spotted newts.7.  Ego.  I have one as does everyone and it is a great satisfaction to outhike people 1/2 and 1/3 my age as well as to compete against the clock or any other thing I can think of.I think that’s about it.So, as with my college degree which is still pending as I am on the 40-year plan, my AT adventure will not end with a thru-hike in 4-6 months like most.  Mine will be a long-term venture of 4-5 years and that’s just fine by me.","Roanoke

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614858,"I got up today at 7:00am and re-packed all my gear.  At 8:00 I checked out and called Uber to get a ride to my start point  in Daleville about 25 miles away.  The Iner showed up in about 5 minutes and at 8:53am I was off on today’s segment.  
I knew this was going to be a long day and long miles but I had no idea how grueling.  I had about 1/4 mile hike to get from the AT parking area in Daleville to where I had left the trail on Sunday.  After that, I knew I had to detour once in Troutville to pick up my resupply box at the post office.  Susan had sent it last week.  The hike from Daleville to Troutville was two miles. A little longer than I had thought, then I had 8/10 of a mile down US-11 to the post office.  My box was there so I pulled out what I wanted and mailed the rest to my office, along with a partial animal jawbone with teeth that I had found along the road.
Before I left the post office I went into the Wattstull Inn website and booked a room for the night.  They are in Buchanan , Va, just off of I-81 and 7 miles from the trail.
So after the post office I had the 8/10 mile walk back down US-11 to the trail junction.  So by the time I got back on trail, I had detoured 1.85 miles.  Today’s hike was going to be long anyhow and this just made it longer.
I then had a three-mile ascent of about 1200 feet but I was lethargic from the get go, even with a zero day yesterday.  I don’t know why, maybe the heat, but all day I felt I had no energy and the trail over the 20+ mile distance beat up my feet and legs as well.  
Near the top of the mountain I got passed just before Fullhardt Knob Shelter by the same young girl who took my photo on Tinker Cliffs.  She is a 2017 grad of Virginia Tech and started her thru-hike in March at Amicalola Falls in Georgia.  She eased on ahead and was soon out of sight.  
After Fullhardt the trail took a dip and then another climb, this time to another peak just before Salt Pond Road at trail mile 8 in the hike (not counting the detours).  I had stopped at mile 5.5 and drank water and electrolyte but I seemed to stay thirsty.  I decided that at the first sign of water I was going to drink and filter a lot.  I didn’t have to wait long as a mile later I decended into Curry Creek and a great stream.  My friend from Virginia Tech was there getting water as well.  She was planning to stop at. Shelter up ahead for lunch but I wasn’t sure how far she was planning to go today.  Soon after she left I was still filtering water when a young couple I had passed while they were eating at the peak near Salt Pond Road came by.  They didn’t stop for water and kept going.  About a mile later I passed them on an uphill.  These were the only other people I saw all day.  
I thought the trail was going to mellow out because the roses weren’t as high nor the falls so low so the net elevation seemed to max out at maybe 1000’ in any given area for the rest of the day, but most of it was 250’ or less.  At Wilson Creek Shelter I passed the VT grad eating lunch but I kept going on the trail.  That was at AT mile marker 740.3 or the 11-mile mark of my non-detour mileage day, mile 12.85 overall for the day.  I realized I was only halfway done.  
Just past the next peak at AT mile 742.6 I came to Black Horse Gap which marked the AT’s first intersection with the Blue Ridge Parkway, or BRP.  The trail then paralleled and crossed and recrossed the BRP until my destination at Bearwallow Gap.  The trail did get a little easier along the BRP, but I was so exhausted and hurting that even slight ups hurt and downs hurt in different ways.
At Peaks of Otter Overlook I texted the Inn and told them I was three miles from my pick-up point and I’d be there by 7:00pm.  By this time it was 6:00.
 Being so near being done motivated me and I upped my pace, mainly on the flats and downs but even somewhat on the ups.  The van showed up about 5 minutes after I did and drove me to the Inn.  The driver was the owner’s son and he runs things now since the Inn and restaurant will one day be his.  The restaurant is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays so I asked about food and drink.  He said there is a convenience store on the property which turned out to be a Shell Station/convenience store the family also owns.  So after checking in and changing my shirt and shoes, I waked to the Shell but jumped in the pool on the way.  That felt great!  So I picked up some chips, 2 Gatorades, ice cream bars, a Diet-Coke and a 6-pack of Bud Light.  Dinner.  I ate it all and drank 3 Bud Lights, the Coke and one of the Gatorades.
Now I’m just resting on the bed and updating this journal and planning tomorrow.  Not as long, 17.9 miles.  
My feet and legs still hurt but they should be OK by morning.
So my total for today was 23.43 miles in 10 hours and 26 seconds.  The total elevation climb was 5123 feet, so almost a mile!  My total this year so far is 270.37 miles and I’m at mile marker 750.6.  Only 273 more miles to Harper’s Ferry!  Halfway there and only 79 miles to The Priest and the Crabtree Falls area.","Daleville, VA, US-220

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615058,"The owner of the Inn was going to be driving any hikers back to Bearwallow Gap at 9:00am this morning, later than what I wanted but that worked for his schedule.  I had gotten up at 7:45am and packed my stuff and around 8:30am went to where the van was parked in front of the office.  No one was around yet so I put my stuff down and finished a bottle of Gatorade I had.  Then I realized there was a snack bar/breakfast room behind the inn so I went in there and got a coffee and a pack of those little donuts, powdered sugar ones only because there were no chocolate ones.
The owner lives in a house right next to the Inn, in fact, a roof connects the two and under the roof was a 2013 Mustang GT, white.  In the unattached garage, which was open, was a white 1965 or 1966 Mustang.  When the owner came out I showed him photos of my rebuilt 1966 Mustang and we started talking cars.  That turned out to be his hot button.  There was one other hiker going to the trail junction, a single female.  At the time I did not  know her trail name but later found out it was Tiger Lily (see tomorrow’s journal entry).
So at 9:00 the two of us were driven back to the trail junction 7 miles away and the owner and I talked cars the whole way.  Turns out he has rebuilt many older cars and raced them all over the country.  
So we got dropped off and Tiger Lily had set off before me as I figetted with my stuff.  I figured I’d catch her right away but it actually took me about three miles.  
By the way, the town we were in is Buchanan, VA, but it is not pronounced like James Buchanan’s name, it is pronounced, “Buck-an-un”, with the emphasis on the “Buck”.  
So I was feeling surprisingly fresh this morning and the trail helped.  The first 7 miles were basically down with a few slight uphills all the way into VA-614, Jennings Creek.  
Then St Augustine In Hell came to mind again and I thought, okay, break’s over, as I began the climb up Fork Mountain.  It was only 1000 feet but over 1.6 miles and it was not easy.  The top offered little relief because after a drop of 700 feet over the next mile, it eased into an 8-1/2 mile sporadic climb of Bryant Ridge, Floyd Mountain, Black Rock and a portion of Apple Orchard Mountain.  It was pretty much slow going and I seemed to plod along going up and up.  The total rise was  2250 feet but it just seemed a lot more.  
I had called ahead earlier in the day to Peaks of Otter Lodge about getting a room there but I had emphasized that I needed to be assured I could get a ride from them once I got to BRP 78.4 at Apple Orchard Trailhead.  Cathy, the lady I talked to, told me to call back and she’d try to line up a shuttle.  I called back around noon and she asked when Inthoigjt I’d get there.  I told her I was still 10 or so miles out but I figured between 4:45 and 5:15.  I told her I’d call her back in a few hours.  On top of Black Rock I called Cathy back.  I was 1-1/2 miles from the pick-up point and I refined my time with her to 5:00pm.  
Prior to that, at around the 4-mile to go point, I heard distant thunder  and the sky clouded over.  While the cooler temps felt good I knew it was going to rain, I was just hoping it would rain around me and not on Apple Orchard.
When I hung up with Cathy with 1.5 miles to go, the thunder was right over me. It still wasn’t raining and I was hoping it would hold off for at least 35 minutes so I could get to the pick-up point.  No such luck.  I got maybe 200 yards down the trail and it started raining.  I pulled my poncho out and threw that over me and the pack and set off again at higher speed.  It rained pretty steady the rest of the way and as I was coming up the 3/10 of a mile side trail to the BRP, the rain stopped.  At least the Peaks of Otter van was there! 
I was spent and that course took it all out of me.  I only saw a few other people today, one older guy resting on top of Fork Mountain, 2 guys who had just hiked up the northside of Fork Mountain heading south and a few people camping and hanging outside there tent when it started raining.
So my van driver was Davin and he was originally from nearby Bedford County.  The guy with him was Ray and he was from Detroit.  So, a contrast in backgrounds.  Ray was a cook at the lodge and Davin worked the front desk.  We talked hiking mostly all the way to the lodge.  It cost me $10 for the shuttle, which I gladly paid, plus I tipped them another $10 which they were pleasantly surprised of.  By the way, I walked up to the BRP overlook at 4:55pm, 5-minutes ahead of schedule.  
So I got all check in and dropped all my stuff and took a nice hot shower.  After that I got dressed and went to the hotel lounge and ordered a water and a Bud Light draft.  Both tasted great.  Some days I crave Diet-Coke on the trail, sometimes ice water, sometimes an ice- old beer.  Today it was a beer.  Darlene Anderson was the bartender and she was originally from Long Island but had moved to the area at some point.  I ordered 10 wings and their pork chop dinner with mashed potatoes and green bean casserole.  I ended up drinking a lot of water and 3 Bud Lights.  At some point a bluegrass duo, a man and a woman, came in and set up.  She played the fiddle and he played guitar, acoustic and slide.  They both sang.  I was the first one in the lounge but by this time, 2 hours later, it was full.  I started talking to a motorcyclist next to me, Bo, and he was from Maryland.  I can’t remember the town but it wasn’t far from Salisbury where he worked.  His parents lived in Knoxville but he grew up in Georgia.  He was on his way back home from Knoxville but was going to stop in Williamsburg on the way.  I told him my daughter and son-in-law lived there.  
A few other people, including the musicians, asked me about my hiking.  So I explained what I was doing and how it was going and around 9:30pm I left and went back to my room.  
I got my stuff ready for the next day’s hike.  I would have updated the journal then but the area had really bad connectivity.  
I think it was around 11:00pm when I finally crashed and I had made arrangements to be driven back to the trailhead the next morning at 8:00am.  I decided that since the restaurant opened at 7:30 I’d grab a quick breakfast to start the day off.
So, for the day I had 17.87 miles in 7 hours 29 minutes.  My total elevation climb was 5533 feet, so once again over a mile.  What a workout!  At least for me it was.Until tomorrow...","Bearwallow Gap - BRP Mile 90.9

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615065,"so I got up this morning at 6:45 and packed all my stuff, same routine, and made it to the lobby restaurant right at 7:30am.  I had pancakes, orange juice and coffee for breakfast, oh yeah, and leftover wings.  Several people from the night before came in, one couple who were motorcycling along the BRP, a mother/daughter from New Jersey and an older (older than me!) couple from Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania.  They got to asking me about the AT again so I answered a lot of questions and explained stuff as best I could before I paid my bill and checked out.  The shuttle driver was about 15 minutes late and that made me antsy and kind of ticked off but I shrugged it off once we were on our way.  
By the way, no one could tell me why the place was called Peaks of Otter.  You’d think if you work at such a place surely one of the first things they’d teach you is what the heck the name means or comes from.
I told him I was hiking close to Glasgow, VA but was opting to stay in the slightly larger town of Buena Vista, pronouncing it as I understood it was, the slightly Spanish “Buena”.  The driver corrected me and said, it is pronounced, “Bu-no”, as in “B” and a long “U” sound.  News to me but hey, he grew up here I guess he’d know.  I asked him if he knew why the place was called Peaks of Otter, I figured it had to do with the surrounding mountains resembling otters in some guy’s mind 250 years ago.  He told me it was named for the Otter River, and yes, the three surrounding mountain peaks.  “Otter” is actually a misconstrued from either a similar sounding Scottish or Native American word, he wasn’t sure.  Wikipedia concurs and is not sure which is true.
So anyhow I got dropped off and was on my way at 8:51am.  I had the 3/10 of a mile downhill on the Apple Orchard Trail to where it intersected the AT.  There Insaw the same older guy from the day before.  We spoke briefly and then I continued  on up the mountain, about a 900 foot climb over the first 1.5 miles.  One thing I was looking forward to about reaching the top at 4225 above sea level was that it was once an Air Force radar base and the surrounding area had barracks and support buildings for 250 people, according to the AT guide.  When I finally made it up there the radar, enclosed in a radome, and a few connecting buildings were still there surrounded by a chain link fence.  As I got close to it, I had to investigate, of course, I noticed that the cooling fans were on.  So, this was an active radar from what I could tell.  No other buildings were up there and I didn’t see any evidence of any other buildings so either the government tore them down or they may have been further down a side road which I wasn’t going to explore further off the AT.
By the way, Apple Orchard Mountain is listed as the highest mountain along the AT between Chestnut Knob and Mt. Moosilauke in New Hampshire.  
Well, I was glad the Apple Orchard climb was over and now it looked like I had 16 miles of down with a few Knob speed bumps thrown in.  On the initial descent of Apple Orchard I came across Tiger Lily again.  That’s when I actually found out her trail name.  She was an empty-nester from Dayton, Ohio and had started the trail back in March im Georgia.  Her adult son and daughter had hiked a portion earlier with her.  Anyhow, she and I hiked from about the 2-mile mark for me to about my 6-1/2 mile point.  We, or I, talked pretty much the whole way and the miles and time seemed to click away. She stopped to get water and I kept going  at 6-1/2 miles. 
The descent was unpleasantly interrupted by a 400 foot rise at mile 774 on the AT, a 700 rise up Highcock Knob at mile 777 and a smaller 400 foot rise at mile 780.5. Then it was downhill to mile 786.  
I called a cab service at mile 783 and told them I’d be at the James River Foot Bridge at US-501 at 4:15.  They said they’d be there.  I got there early, as usual, at 3:59.  At 4:15, no cab, 4:20, no cab, 4:25, no cab, 4:30, no cab.  I also had no cell service.  There was a group of teens/early 20-ish people at the parking lot and they were leaving in three vehicles.  The last one to pull out was a guy by himself.  I asked if he was going into Buena Vista, 15-miles away, and he said he was planning on taking a quick swim in the river and was then going that way.  I told him my predicament and asked if he’d give me a ride.  I told him I’d pay him as I was gonna pay the cab driver anyhow.  He agreed to drive me and skipped the swim.  We talked along the way about him growing up in the area, sports, what his future plans were and his take on college.  Soon we were at the Budget Inn, one of only 2 or 3 motels in the area, and I paid him $40.  He was really surprised but I insisted and told him to spend it on college or beer.  
So I checked into the motel and then called the cab company to find out what happened.  It was a different dispatcher though and she didn’t know.  I then did my laundry on the premises and walked to Hardee’s for a burger while my clothes were in the wash.  Then I went to a Family Dollar next to Hardee’s to get Epsom Salts and some snacks and walked back to put my clothes in the dryer.  
So after that I did some schedule planning and then watched Jeopardy and then went across the street for a chicken sandwich.  Since then I’ve been updating the journal.  I’ll add more photos later.
I did have a large deer run across the trail about 15 yards in front of me yesterday but that was the only notable critter I saw.  Today I saw another 4-foot black snake getting ready to cross the trail but it had stopped, as if at a stop sign, waiting for me to cross.  I just took a bunch of photos and it eventually backed up a little, changed it’s course of direction about 45 degrees and went about crossing the trail away from me.  I took more pictures.
So, today’s total was 17.08 miles in 7 hours and 8 minutes.  Total elevation climb of 2824 feet.  So I am now at AT mile marker 786.  238 miles to Harper’s Ferry and only 12 hiking days left if I hike through June 11.  I found out today that I can take the train/metro from Harper’s Ferry to Dulles for my flight home the morning of the 12th so that helps.  The train/metro is something like 3-1/2 hours and my flight isn’t until 1:30 I think.  So, we’ll see if I’ve got another 238 miles in me with no more zero days...","Apple Orchard Trailhead

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615109,"Before I start today’s journal entry, prayers and condolences to the victims and family members of today’s shooting in my hometown of Virginia Beach.
I had a cab scheduled to pick me up at 7:30am so I got up at 6:30 and since I was going to be slack packing, I didn’t have much in the way of preparation.  I had already pre-filtered my water and my electrolyte and it was in the refrigerator from the night before.  With no rain predicted until late in the afternoon, I opted to leave my poncho behind so all I took was my fluids, my water filter and my normal front pouch contents, jerky, pistachios, energy gummies, Mini-Leatherman, Spacepen, Sharpie.  Besides that, I had my baggy wallet, my power bank and, of course, my comb.
I was eating a chocolate fudge Poptart and I had just bought a coffee and Gatorade at the Exxon across the street when the cab showed up early at 7:15.  So I snatched my pack and trekking poles and got it, eating the Poptart and drinking the coffee on the way to the drop-off point.  We got there about 1/2 hour later just as 4 other hikers were preparing to set out.  One guy was heading south along the trail, a single woman, whom I have seen off and on since Marion, was heading north and two guys were together and also heading north.  The woman set off right away while the four of us guys got caught up discussing insect repellant.  The one guy was swathering on Deet and the southbounder asked him if he used Permithrin.  He said he did but only on his tent.  I told them I use it on all my clothes and gear and had not had a tick or inspect problem at all.  The southbounder basically concurred as he donned a mosquito face mask and headed off.  The two guys left a few minutes ahead of me and as I tailed them 200 yards behind I could smell Deet in the air.  I finally caught them just shy of the mile mark and moved on.
Before I continue, let me regress about songs stuck in your head.  The other day when I was doing the 8-1/2 mile uphill towards Apple Orchard, for some odd reason the Beatles’ “I’m So Tired” was going round and round in my head.  That’s the wrong song to have on one’s mind when you are totally beat and trekking an uphill.  “I’ so tired, I haven’t slept a wink.  I’m so tired, my mind is on the blink”...
Another song I was able to actually think about and get stuck on that helped was Sly and the Family Stone’s “Hot Fun in the Summertime” when it was 90+ degrees and I was cruising through a difficult portion.  I think it helped!  “That’s when I had most of my fun, back High, high, high, high there, them summer days, those summer days...”
I also had “Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie” cross my mind but I forced myself to think of something else, anything, until it went away.  Yesterday and today for some reason the song has been Jimmy Buffet’s Livingston Saturday Night.  “Fifteen May get you twenty, that’s all right...”.  Anyhow, back to today’s story.
I knew I had a couple tough climbs today and one was pretty much straight away.  After 1.8 miles of getting the legs warmed up through Johns Hollow Shelter, the trail took a noticeable ramp up, 2000 feet over 3-miles with one brief downturn  after Fullers Rocks 2/3 of the way up.  This brought me to the peak of Big Rocky Row.  It actually went surprisingly easy and I was able to ease through the next 3-miles of relative flats past Saddle Gap Trail and Saltlog Gap which brought me to the second challenge of the day, Bluff Mountain, an ascent of another 500 feet but beautiful views all around.  The top of Bluff also marked the 9-mile mark for the day so nearly half of today’s 21-miler.
Oh yeah, at mile 6 or so I caught up with Tiger Lily again.  I thought she was behind me on the trek but she had done 21 miles yesterday to my 17 and gotten ahead of me.  We talked for a bit and she was going to get off the trail at US-60 as well and do a zero day in Lexington.  Her kids were meeting her there and she told me she was related to Stonewall Jackson so they were going to check out some of the “relative” history in Lexington.  I mentioned to her that he had taught at VMI which was there in Lexington.  Anyhow, we hiked and talked for just a short while and then I sped off on a long downhill.  With her doing a zero and me having no zeros left to take we’ll probably not cross paths again.
Also, I keep forgetting to add photos of my elevation charts which I will post in the photo section going back to mile marker 714, otherwise readers don’t have much of an idea when I describe certain mountains or landmarks.
So after Bluff Mountain I had a 4-mile up and down to Rice Mountain that was really pretty easy and I was still feeling great.  Somewhere along the line I saw my first tick, it was on my right forearm and couldn’t have been there very long.  It was crawling up my arm so I brushed it off.  It hadn’t gotten to my Permithrin-impregnated shirt sleeve yet.  
I finally caught the woman who had left the parking lot 10-12 minutes ahead of me at mile marker 800 on the trail, 14 miles into today’s hike.  I was surprised it had taken me that long to catch her since I took only 1 short fluid break and Inwas hiking pretty fast for me, averaging about 24 minutes/mile.  She had stopped to take a photo of sticks arranged on the ground,”800”, signifying the benchmark. I didn’t see her again after that.  
I also did not see any snakes or bears today, nor any wildlife other than birds (I did see two grouse at different spots) and lots of squirrels. 
On the downside of Rice Mountain I heard my phone update so I knew Inhad a signal.  I called the cab service and told them I was 8-miles away and predicted I’d need to be picked up at 4:30pm at US-60.  I then finished the descent and now had 5-1/2 miles of relative flats from the Pedlar River Bridge to the base of Bald Knob, tomorrow’s challenge.  
I was doing great time wise and ahead of schedule, as usual, until I hit a trail detour sign with 4-miles to go.  The detour was because a bridge was out.  What was frustrating is that the sign did not say if any mileage had been deducted or added due to the detour, so now I had to speed up just to be sure.  I’m glad it was a slack pack day.  I was just short of running and turning sub-20 minute miles. It was all for naught as I got to US-60 at 4:15 and beat the cab.  There were 3 other thru-hikers there taking a break so we talked while I waited for my cab.  The one guy remembered me from the laundromat back in Marion. 
So my cab was early as well and by 4:20 we were driving back to Buena Vista.  I was her last fare for the day so she drove me all over Buena Vista on a grand and detailed tour.  It started raining so I had just missed a major thunderstorm that came through the area over the next several hours.  
When I got back I walked to the Exxon store and got 2 25-oz Bud Lights, a Gatorade and a water and went back to my room to drink my beer and decompress catching up on the news of the day.  I heard about the Virginia Beach shooting shortly thereafter.  I then got cleaned up and went next door to Subway for a sub dinner.  I’ve since downed the Gatorade as well and munched on pretzels and several Chips Ahoy cookies while catching up this journal.  
To bed soon as I have a 20-miler tomorrow to Crabtree Falls!!
So, the day’s stats are 21.17 miles hiked in 8 hours and 20 minutes with a total elevation climb of 5734, so over a mile again!!Since May 6 that’s something like 337.9 miles and I’m now at mile marker 807.7, only 216 until Harper’s Ferry and 11 days to get it done in...","James River Footbridge - US501

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615407,"I’m updating the past three days on the late evening of Monday, June 3 because for the past two days I did not have cell service at the end of the day.
This may be briefer than normal because now I have to think back.
A cab picked me up at the motel in Buena Vista at 7:00am on Saturday and dropped me at Long Mountain Wayside off of US-60.  I had my major climb for the day right away, a 2000’ ascent of Bald Knob over the initial 2.8 miles.  Things went pretty well though and I was feeling good.  After Bald Knob the trail to Crabtree Farm Road was just a series of ups and downs, with only one at 500’ and the rest lower than that.  
Things were pretty ineventful until I got within 3 miles of the endpoint and decided to call the Cabins at Crabtree Falls, where I had a reservation, to inquire about a pick-up at Crabtree Farm Road.  
I had poor reception and had to rely on texts.  The owner said that they did not do shuttles because of the liability issues.  That left me with an undetermined way to get from the trail to their place 6-miles away when I finished hiking for the day.  Not a pleasant thought when hiking.  
It turned out well though.  When I got to Crabtree Farm Road, just before entering The Priest Wilderness and less than a mile from the top of Crabtree Falls, I started down the road thinking maybe Incould catch a ride with a day hiker or someone visiting the Falls, particularly since it was a Saturday.  I got a couple hundred yards down the gravel road when a camper van appeared coming my way.  The van stopped and the driver asked me about Crabtree Falls.  I pointed out that it was further up the hill and then asked the driver if he was familiar with the area.  He said yes, somewhat so I asked him if this was the right way to VA-56 and to the Canins at Crabtree Falls.  He wasn’t familiar with the cabins but told me that 56 was a ways away if I was walking.  I told him I didn’t have any choice when he offered to drive me.  TRAIL ANGEL!!  He said he was going to check out a spot for him and his son to camp up by the Falls but he’d be back and for me to continue walking the direction I was heading in.  So I thanked him and continued walking.  About 15-minutes later he did come back and they picked me up.  They drove me into the cabin driveway!!  Come to find out, Mike, the driver is a 1991 graduate of Indian River High School in Chesapeake.  Small world.  His son lived with his mother and went to Western Branch, where Susan went to high school.  
The cabin was pretty sparse and they didn’t have any food, despite what I had thought.   No restaurants delivered there either so I was stuck having to eat dehydrated vegetables and fruit from my pack stash along with beef jerky and pistachios.  I did have a leftover Hersey bar for desert.  The cabin had a tv but no tv Channels, only DVD capability.  So I got the movie Twisted, with Ashley Judd, out of their video library and watched that.  A little about this cabin.  It is a real log cabin built back in the early 1800’s.  I added photos  of it and a copy of the history of the place.  Pretty interesting.So, after the movie I went to bed and slept great.So, for the day, 22.04 miles in 9 hours and  5 minutes.  I had a total elevation climb of 5627 feet, so over a mile again.  Completing today puts me at mile marker 827.5 so just under 200 miles to go over the next 10 days!","Long Mountain Wayside - US-60
",Crabtree Farm Road - VA826,"Jun 01, Sat",22.04
TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615420,"I got up at 6:00 and had pre-arranged with the owner, Paul, to get a ride back up to the trailhead.  So again I lucked out not having to walk 6 miles.  I ate my last pop tart, packed, and at 7:00 Paul and I were on our way.  We talked a little about the area and I told him that I’m high school and my early 20’s I had come to Lake Sherando and Crabtree Falls with guys from high school camping.  I told him all about our end of February camping trip and how that originated, the first years at Sherando and then the move to Switzer Lake where we still hold the annual event 40 years later.  It turns out that Paul and his wife both have links to Virginia Beach with several relatives living in the area.  Paul said that easily half of their guests are from the Hampton Roads area.
Paul told me that the climb up Three Ridges Mountain was a tough one  but I took that with a grain of salt.  It’s all relative and although Paul lives here, I’m the “experienced” hiker.  
A quick story Paul related about Crabtree Falls, besides it being the highest cascading waterfall east of the Mississippi and dozens of people having been killed falling from the Falls, was the story of the Cash sisters.  Apparently, they lived in a small cabin near the Falls for decades as their ancestors had for generations.  They had no electricity or running water and would walk, 8 miles, to “town” once-a-week for groceries.  This went on into the 1990’s until they both eventually passed.  
So my hike started from the Crabtree Falls parking area and I had a 1/2 mile walk to the trail, beats 6-miles, so at 7:40am I was off.  My initial climb the rest of the way up Priest Mountain was rather easy as it was only 700 feet.  The Priest people talk about is a vast overlook of the valley below and the mountains off into the distance.  Some say The Priest rivals McAfee Knob.  Despite me having been to Crabtree and Sherando many times and my friends having been to The Priest, I had never actually been.  It isn’t marked along the trail so the only clue is a narrow side trail.  Apparently I missed that trail and walked right by it.  It wasn’t until I was making my descent that I realized I had missed it.  I contemplated going back but decided against it.  The fact that I missed The Priest nagged at me so I eventually did turn around and go back.  I found it this time and took several photos and briefly talked to several hikers having breakfast there.  It was worth going back although it added 1.2 miles (round trip) to my hike.
The descent down The Priest into the Tye River Gap is not easy as it is 3000’ over 3-1/2 miles so it is tough on the feet and knees.  There were several other mountain overlooks along the way that I paused at for photos and it being a Sunday, a lot of weekend campers and day hikers were out. 
The ascent up the next mountain, Three Ridges, is sort of in three stages, hence the three ridges.  The first one takes you up 1000’ feet in two miles then there is a brief 7/10 of a mile decline of 200’.  Then you go up again, this time 1500’ over 2-miles and again have a brief respite, this time a 1/2 mile flat, then the final push to the top, 750’ over 1-mile.  So all in all it is a 3000’ ascent over  6-1/2 miles.  It was very tough.  I talked to a lot of hikers along the way and afterward and all agreed that Three Ridges is one of the toughest sections of trail so far.  I was happy to be at the top but even more happy to see the mileage sign to my destination of Reed’s Gap, 4.2 miles away!!
With Prometheus, a fellow hiker I had been flip-flopping with up the mountain, taking a break at the top, I sped up going down not wanting to be overtaken again. He didn’t catch me.  
Most of the young hikers will hike faster than me, on the order of sub-20 minute miles, whereas I hike at an average usually of 25 minutes/mile.  I’m faster on flats and slight ups and downs but overall around 25 minutes.  While I get passed by the younger hikers, I usually catch them throughout the day because they stop for extended periods to eat and/or rest, then zoom!  They are off again.  I, on the other hand, only stop 2-3 times a day and that’s just long enough to take in fluids, maybe 2 minutes each stop.  So although they are faster, I usually beat them to the final destinations.  I call it youthful exuberance vs measured maturity.  
Once I got to Reed’s Gap, at 4:20pm, a fellow hiker I had seen was thumbing.  We all had discussed going to Devil’s Backbone and apparently they ran a shuttle.  The hiker said the last shuttle came at 5:30 so he was trying to get there earlier by thumbing.  Since I was staying at Fenton Inn, 8/10 of a mile up the road, I started walking there so Incould check in, get a shower, then walk back in time to catch the shuttle.
To explain a little about Devil’s Backbone, they run what is called their basecamp 5 miles from the AT junction at Reed’s Gap.  It seems the founder is an avid outdoorsman and wanted to support the skiers at Wintergreen as well as the AT hikers, so they built basecamp.  This place is a complex, complete with campgrounds, RV accommodations, showers, stores and the restaurant and bar area.  It is huge!  So they run a shuttle several times a day picking up and dropping off hikers to and from Reed’s Gap.
As I was checking into Fenton, I told the owner what I was planning.  She told me to go ahead and get cleaned up and she’d call Devil’s Backbone and arrange for the shuttle to stop in front of her place.  When I was all ready, she walked out with me to wait and we talked about things.  She is originally from Crimea and she and her husband own the Inn.  We talked a lot of politics, naturally, Cold War stuff and Putin’s unchallenged invasion of Georgia, The Ukraine and the Crimean Peninsula. 
So the shuttle picked me up and I climbed on back with the other hikers and gear.  Prometheus was there and I joked him about beating him to Reed’s Gap. Once we got to Devil’s Backbone, they all piled out and went to set up their tents and get cleaned up.  I got in the front seat of the truck with Cassie driving and explained to her about my staying at Fenton Inn and that I needed to arrange for a drive back before I did any eating or drinking.  She dropped me off at the restaurant/bar and I found my way to the bar and sat down.  I ordered a draft and a water and within minutes Cassie was back introducing me to management.  I said I was not moving from my stool all night and I had no specific time to leave.  That worked for them and they said they’d get someone to drive me back once they closed at 9:30, which ended up being 10:30. Most of the hikers stayed outside or were milling about the property doing other things but I was content watching sports, eating a steak dinner and having a few drafts.  Several hikers did come in, including Andre, a young guy from Charlotte, and Prometheus.  We talked for a while and eventually they left.  A group of about 5 came in and we all talked for the rest of the night.  One guy was a Penn State engineering grad but Incan’t remember what the others backgrounds were.  I ended up putting their tab on mine since they were all on a hiker budget and at 10:30 I was being driven back to the Inn.Once at the Inn I tried watching a little TV and trying to update the journal but I had no cell service so around 11:00pm I crashed for the night.So, total miles for the day were 17.64 in 8 hours and 40 minutes.  The total elevation was 5354 feet.  I’m now at mile marker 843.8.  Trail miles to Harper’s Ferry?  180.2.  Days of hiking left?  NINE.","Crabtree Farm Road - VA826

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615493,"My title for this leg, Crossing the Rubicon” isn’t entirely accurate as I am well past the point of no return.  The phrase stuck in my head recently and so I applied it here to crossing a major thoroughfare. being a Virginian, that thoroughfare or “River” being Interstate 64!  So at the end of today I will have crossed I-64 at Rockfish Gap in Waynesboro.
So I got up late at the Fenton Inn, at 7:00am, because I knew they were serving breakfast starting at 8:00 so I decided a good breakfast to start the day would probably be good sacrificing a little time.  I already had a reservation for the Quality Inn I’m Waynesboro which I had set up at Devil’s Backbone so the only unknown was the ride, 4.8 miles, from Rockfish Gap to the hotel.
So after a breakfast of eggs, French toast, sausage, juice and coffee, I talked to the owners a little while and then finally headed out the door for my 8/10 of a mile walk (uphill) to the trail junction.  I got there a few minutes after the Devil’s Backbone shuttle had just dropped hikers who had camped at the basecamp off.  
So at 9:30am I set off for Waynesboro filtering in amongst the younger hikers.  The first three miles was relatively flat and that was nice as my body warmed up to today’s trek.  The next five miles were ‘t all that much harder, although it was primarily a low grade rise except for a couple back-to-back abrupt 250’ rises at miles 6&7.  
Woodpeckers.  You hear them throughout the woods but I’ve never seen one so never photographed one.  They peck at a tree for several seconds then quit.  Then repeat the process.  You can hear them from way off but it seems like when you get near the tree they are pecking on they either stop or move to another tree.
Lots of different butterflies too!  I see tons of Eastern Tiger Swallowtails.  Small wonder, come to find out they are Virginia’s state insect.  I didn’t even know we had a state insect.  You see lots of Greak Spangled Fritillary butterflies but the hardly land for very long.  They are smallish and orange and black.  Another popular one is I think the West Virginia White.  They are on the small side too.  A Zebra Swallowtail flitted around me today and landed but by the time I got my camera on it it flew off!  It was really neat looking with a little bit of red at it’s tail end.  Anyhow, lots of butterflies.So after Himpback Mountain at the 8-mile mark the Trail gets even easier with 6-miles of cascading downhills to Mill Creek and then 5-miles of relative flats to Rockfish Gap.  I got to the Gap and there was a list of shuttle drivers so I started calling them.  After about 4 non-responses or people who couldn’t come I called Uber.  Even with Uber I had three accept and then decline but the fourth one came.  It was going to be about twenty minutes so I went to a truck vendor a couple hundred yards away and got a Diet Coke, hotdog and fries.  I talked to a fellow hiker also waiting for a ride.  Finally my ride came and we were off to the Quality Inn.  Once I got checked in I took a shower and walked up the street to a New York Style Pizza place.  I ordered a large Sicilian style which is thicker and rectangular.  I ate half of it there watching WWF wrestling.  It’s what the bartender had on.  Rick Flair’s daughter wrestled.  I didn’t even know he had a daughter.  I drank a couple Bud Lights with my pizza and around 10:00 headed back to the hotel.  Once there I did my usual prep stuff for the next day and was in bed by 11:00.So, for the day, 19.70 miles in 8 hours and 13 minutes.  My elevation total was 3698 feet.  So, I’m now at AT mile marker 862.9, just 161.1 miles from Harper’s Ferry.","Reeds Gap VA664

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615500,"Yes. entering the Shenandoahs backwards.  As a strategy, I decided to stay at the Quality Inn another night I’m Waynesboro.  So instead of hiking south to north into the Shenandoahs and being unsure of cell coverage or shuttle availability, I had the shuttle driver drop me off at the northernpoint of Black Rock Gap and I hiked north to south back into Waynesboro.  I’ve done that once or twice before and I’m doing it again on Friday.  It is also a chance to slack pack since you are coming back to the same location from the previous day.
So at 8:00 this morning my shuttle driver showed up.  As we talked along the way onto Skyline Drive, I discovered that he had graduated from Princess Anne and his wife from Granby.  Small world again.  His dad had been career Navy so he went in the army.  His wife’s father was a WWII submarine Chief-of-the-boat but he couldn’t recall what submarine.  I didn’t owe anything for the ride, he simply said to pay it forward and that people had done a lot for him over his lifetime.  As I was getting my stuff out of the back of his truck, he pointed out a Doumar’s bumper sticker on his tailgate.  Doumar’s being the iconic Norfolk Drive-in Restaurant famous for creating the waffle ice cream cone.
So at 9:11am I started my trek back to Waynesboro.  The weather was ideal.  Temps in the 70’s and sunny.  
Unlike much of the AT prior to Skyline Drive, the Shenandoah thoroughfare that originated as a private drive to President Hoover’s summer White House, the AT flop-flops and serpentines over and around Skyline Drive.  During the Roosevelt administration Skyline Drive was built up with overlooks and facilities along the way.  What makes the AT easier here is that Skyline Drive is along the Shenandoah Mountain spine or ridgeline.  Likewise the AT is along the ridgeline.  This is mostly due to private ownership of the base and upwards of most of the mountain chain and the park service owns the top and a little ways down each side. What results for the hikers is an undulating trail that basically follows the ridgeline as opposed to the more severe ascents and descents along the southern AT.  Many thru-hikers enjoy the “break” and it is not uncommon for hikers to log daily mileages that are greater than what they have logged previously.So, back to my day.  The trail south from Black Rock was just as predicted and although there were rises and falls, none were more than 500’ and even those were far and few between.  The terrain was also better on the feet and legs, most of it being dirt or pine needle covered.  There were some rocky areas but overall it was a very pleasant trail.  Calf Mountain at mile marker 870 was the most difficult portion but even it’s 700’ northern slope was mild compared to any similarly high slope in the south.Besides AT hikers, the Shenandoahs have a lot of runners, nature lovers and day hikers so it is more populated than other areas of the AT.  Also, one is always not very far from Skyline Drive itself, which can be a positive or a negative, depending on how you look at it.I got back to Rockfish Gap just before 5:00 and I had better luck with the shuttle drivers today.  By the fourth call one was on the way.  I went over to the truck vendor again and got a hotdog and Diet Coke while I waited.  Fifteen minutes later I was on my way back to the hotel.  I got cleaned up once again and this time walked to a local grille and had a hamburger, fries and three Bud Lights.  I then went back to the hotel to do laundry and while at the restaurant and doing laundry I updated the journal.  So, I am all caught up.  I soaked in an Epsom Salt bath and am now watching the news and weather.  My shuttle driver in the morning is picking me up at 8:00 and he’ll drop me back at Black Rock Gap where I will resume my northern hike.So, for the day I had 20.09 miles in 7 hours and 36 minutes.  The total elevation climb was 4079, a surprise to me.  I am at AT mile marker 883 so 141 miles from Harper’s Ferry.","Black Rock Gap

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615613,"Since my shuttle driver was showing up at 8:00am I got up at 6:30, took another Epsom Salt bath, packed all my stuff, ate some leftover pizza and went to the lobby for coffee and water. Soon thereafter the driver arrived. 
He had a neon yellow truck so his “handle”, as opposed to a trail name, was “yellow truck”.  So me and another hiker piled in.  The other hiker was only going up the road to Rockfish Gap and then I was going 20 miles into the park to Blackrock Gap. The other hiker was from New Jersey and had quit his job as a WalMart manager of 14 years to hike the trail.  He related a weird event that happened to him and several other hikers the other day on the trail.  Apparently, an older couple and several men were at one of the shelters (I think) when the hikers showed up.  The couple and their “entourage” seemed out of place and the hikers (I’ve talked to two now about this) thought the situation odd.  So when one of the hikers started to light up a joint, one of the men from the odd group came over, flashed a badge, and said not to do that here.  Apparently, the couple was one of the Undersecretaries of Defense and his wife enjoying the great outdoors with their bodyguard contingent.  The hikers saw several black SUVs with the tinted windows at the fire road crossing when they were leaving.
So the shuttle was about to turn into the Blacrock Overlook area when we noticed a couple standing near the road and photographing something across the Drive.  That something turned out to be a medium-sized black bear picking at some leaves right at the trailhead.  I couldn’t get a camera shot as it lazily went on into the woods and I think towards the southern section of the trail.  As I headed over prepared to hike north I looked all over for the bear but didn’t see it so I hiked on.  I was due for a long day and I also knew that, intending on staying at an Inn in Elkton, I needed to get there before 7:00pm because the only semblance of a store for food nearby was a mart at an Exxon station and it closed at 7:00.  I still didn’t have Inn reservations nor a shuttle ride although the Inn advertised one from the AT to their Inn 2.7 miles away on Route 33.  I had to wait a little while to call so I began my hike at 8:52am. 
The first part of my day was going to be one of the hardest, relative to my 25-mile Shenandoah day, a 700 foot ascent of Blackrock over a mile.  It went pretty smoothly and the view at the top was really cool, and different.  Not so much of the surrounding area but of the top of Blackrock itself and the sides.  The top looked like someone had taken a giant dump truck load of massive boulders and dropped it, kind of like putting nuts atop an ice cream sundae.  Off one side it was as if the rocks spilled over and partway down.  I take it this is why the mountain is called “Blackrock”.  I took several photos so check them out in the photo section.
So as I was on high ground I decided to try and call Country View Inn and set up my shuttle pick-up and room reservation. After a couple attempts and defaults to a recording, I finally reached a real person.  I explained that I was hiking to Swift Run Gap (which intersects route 33) and that I would like a shuttle pick-up and that I then intended to stay at their place.  I also explained that I intended to get in no later than 7:00pm and would they have someone available to pick me up?  The lady said they would.  I told her I would refine that time down once I got within 3-miles and it more than likely would be closer to 6 than 7.  She told me that once I got to Swift Run Gap to go outside the park service vehicular access point and meet the driver there.  I told her I’d wait on the reservation for the room in the event something happened and I got held up.  She said there was plenty of room and that was no problem.
With that I set off at a faster steady pace intent on dropping my calculated arrival time closer to 6:00 so that the driver would have plenty of time to get me and take me to the Exxon mart before it closed and then back to the Inn.  The Exxon was only several hundred yards down the road from the Inn.
So with the shuttle and room settled I could concentrate on the hike.  The next 3-miles after Black Rock were pretty flat and I was cruising at sub 20-minute miles and shaving time off my previously calculated 7:00pm arrival time.  
I hit several ripples in the terrain over the next 7-miles but nothing too steep or too long, so all my miles through the first 11 were under 22-minutes per mile except for mile 9 when I stopped for fluids and that was a 24-minute mile.  By the way, when I calculate my estimated arrival time each day I use 25-minute miles as a default pace.  It’s easy to calculate multiplying the total miles by 25 and dividing by 60 to figure when I’ll finish.  My Runkeeper app, and Brigette, spits out my distance covered each mile and the running total so I can do the math in my head pretty easily and know if I am ahead or behind.  Halfway into my 25-mile day I was already something like 20 minutes ahead meaning a 6:40pm arrival.  
The terrain got more challenging over the second half and the onset of rain didn’t help.  I had to stop and put on my pack cover and poncho and with the humidity and warmer temps it felt as if I was getting wet regardless of the poncho, and I was through copious sweating.  
The long rise up Hightop Mountain really hurt and of course the rain and wet ground didn’t help.  The approach/rise is something like 3-1/2 miles long and goes up 1350’.  The good news is that once at the top, the destination of Swift Run Gap is 3-miles away and it’s all downhill.  So, while I lost time going up I made up for it coming down.  I called the hotel from the top and told them I’d be there at 6:15.  They said they’d have the driver waiting. Great!!  Even though I was beat, and my feet and legs beat up, I was going to get a ride and food shortly.  
By the way, once it started raining I only saw two other hikers on the trail.  One caught me just prior to the 900-mile AT marker point but as he hung out taking photos or whatever (I took a photo too and moved on) I never saw him again.  He may have pulled off or reached his destination point.  The other hiker I passed and never saw again.  So with the rain the only critters I saw of note was a doe (a deer, a female deer) and a very young fawn on the trail.  I almost ran up on them.  They were northbound on the trail as well and I had my head down because of the rain and I heard a twig snap and when I looked up I was about 15 yards from the fawn’s butt.  The doe stopped and looked over her shoulder at me then turned broadside.  The fawn never knew I was there.  I thought, this doe might go offensive on me but she just peeled off the trail to the right, stopped and waited for the little one to follow, the whole time never taking her eyes off me.  I had stopped and was trying to get my I-phone camera out but by the time I did the fawn had followed mama off the trail and they took off.  Oh well.  At least I didn’t get my butt kicked by a mama doe!  
So as I made it down the mountain I was somewhat excited, and tired as hell, wet and sore.  I was 10 minutes earlier than I thought I’d be and got to the park entrance at 6:05pm.  No shuttle yet.  I started walking down the entrance road towards route 33 thinking I’d help out the shuttle driver and all they’d have to do is a u-turn at route 33.  So now I’ve got my pack off and I’m standing still and I’m wet.  It’s no longer raining and hadn’t been for a couple hours but it was still overcast and I was getting really cold.  At 6:15 no shuttle.  6:20 no shuttle.  Hell, they are only 2.7 miles up route 33.  6:25 no shuttle.  So I called and got their voicemail!!  So I left a message and told them I was at the pick-up point we had agreed upon a little over an hour prior.  The lady tells me that the driver had to go to some function at his son’s school and that was due to end at 7:00 and then he’d come get me.  Heck, I can walk there by then, if I wasn’t so tired from walking all day.  So, I exploded on her as any reasonable person would.  After hanging up I realized, hey, I got cell service (you don’t always know in advance and it is spotty) so I called Uber. 13 minutes later I had a ride!  I told the driver don’t take me to Country View Inn and what had happened.  The next closest hotel was the Elkton Inn but on the way the two of us thought, hey, we’re only 17-more miles to Harrisonburg so Insaid just take me there.  I had stayed at the Marriott-owned properties enough times by the mall area and knew enough restaurants that this would work out much better.  So I called and made reservations at Fairfield Inn on the way and 10-minutes later I was there.  Before he left we arranged for him to pick me up at 6:30am for tomorrow’s hike.  I checked into the hotel and I was still cold.  Once I got to my room I cranked up the heat and took a really long hot shower.  Then I rinsed out my hiking clothes and hung them over the AC unit to dry.
So once I changed into my city clothes and unpacked my pack (things still get damp even with a pack cover and poncho) so things could dry off I walked a block and a half to Outback and besides enjoying ice water and a large Bud LightI ate a large Porterhouse steak, baked potato, broccolli and topped it all off with the Chocolate Thunder From Down Under desert.  All the while I got to watch the start of the NCAA Track and Field Championships on ESPN, so I had an enjoyable satisfying evening after a hard day and a disappointing shuttle experience.  
I went back to the hotel and did my normal pre-hike preparations then crawled in bed to update the journal and watch the news.  I had the heat still cranked up to 80.  I could not get comfortable in bed because my feet hurt so bad.  I eventually had to prop them up with a pillow under my calves because just the weight of them on the mattress hurt.  A little tip for future hikers.  A lot of hikers use their pack to support their legs and take the weight off their feet when sleeping for the same reason. 
I was too tired to complete the journal plus I knew I had to get up at 5:30 so I wasn’t going to get but 6 hours of sleep so, here O am finalizing it now! 
So, the totals for the day were 25.23 miles in 9 hours and 13 minutes.  My total elevation climb was 5631 feet.  By the way, quite often my mileage is longer than “official” AT mile marker miles because I often have to walk some distance to the trail from my drop-off point or from the trail to my pick-up point, so anyone counting will notice the mileage discrepancies.  That being said, I am now at AT mile marker 908.3 (yea!!  I crossed the 900-mile marker).  That puts me 115.7 miles from Harper’s Ferry with 6 hiking days to go!!  My body is breaking down, particularly my feet, and I wish I had a zero day but I don’t.  As bad as my body feels at night it feels way better on the morning and I’m ready to go again.  I’m not sure if it’s the Bud Light, Aleve or both that help.  The good news is I have no injuries and on that respect, my body is doing fine.  Also, my mind ebbs and flows and sometimes I feel like quitting.  Feeling like it and doing it are two different things though.  It’s OK to think it, just don’t do it.  It’s always a fleeting thought anyhow and usually occurs on a tough uphill, like Three Ridges, which a lot of hikers felt like quitting on!  So, 115 miles in 6 days.  Will I make it??","Blackrock Gap

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615723,"Thanks first for all the veterans of WWII, past and present, and particularly the veterans involved in the D-Day invasion.  A salute to The Greatest Generation from the AT.  
I started out today by getting up at 5:30am and repacking all my stuff, which had since dried out, and filtering water, doing my daily preparations for the day’s hike.  I was pretty much pain-free, although it seems like the toes aching is a constant thing.
I went to the lobby and drank some orange juice then got a plain toasted bagel and a coffee for the ride to Swift Run Gap.
Sal, my Uber driver from yesterday, showed up right on time.  As we rode to The Gap, we talked about what he is doing besides driving for Uber. He has a degree in the medical field from his native country (I forget where he is from) but it is not accepted in the US so he is back in school persuing his degree again. I told him I’m still going for mine on the 40-year plan.
So Sal dropped me off and at 7:07am I was off on my next leg, another 25-miler, this time to Skyland Resort at mile marker 41 along Skyline Drive.
I had a Hill right away, 800’ up over 2-miles, so not too bad, and then a long dip that brought me to the top of the next hill, a 700’ rise over 1.5 miles.  By that time I was at mile 5 and well into my hike .  I didn’t see anyone else on the trail and felt as if I had the AT and the park to myself.  All the while hiking I was quiet and looking for bear opportunities and/or other rare creatures.  I got my wish between 5&6 miles when I spotted a bear nibbling on the greenery off to my left about 15 yards away.  It apparently did not sense me.  As I was pulling my phone out to take pictures and hopefully get some video, Brigette spoke up in her French accent spitting out mileage statistics.  I quickly turned down the volume and the bear had not noticed.  Besides giving me my hiking distance and pace every mile, if I tap the Runkeeper app screen I get the current information so I have to be careful not to tap it, which I apparently did.  I watched and filmed the large (I’m guessing) male bear for about 8 minutes.  He would zig zag in and out towards the trail and left to right and as he did I would maneuver northward along the trail to get a better vantage point often bringing me closer to him.  Eventually I was on the northern side of the trail and him and I eased off leaving him to forage in peace.  I will post several videos and photos.
That encounter made the rest of the hike more than a success regardless of what happens.  
So the next 8 miles or so were rolling terrain until Hazeltop which rises about 600’.  I still had not seen anyone on the trail for about the first 12 miles, then at miles 13-14 I saw several groups of day-hikers but still no thru-hikers.  
At Hazeltop I had a close encounter with a deer, real close.  It froze off the trail about 12 feet from me so I got my camera out and as I did it took off leaping and sprinting north along the trail.  I did get some photos.  
As I got close to Big Meadows, I noticed someone had pulled up these plants and they were littering the path.  Further ahead I came across two park rangers who were pulling up the plants, apparently an invasive species, so that’s why they were left on the trail.  Further on I passed a trash bag full of them.  
I also passed a small cemetery along the way that was relatively modern but seemed out of place along the AT and in the park.  
Near Fisher’s Gap I saw what appeared to be a Girl Scout approaching but as she said hello and asked for my backcountry permit I realized she was an agent for the park enforcement mafia.  I said I didn’t have a permit and didn’t think I needed one.  She asked if I was a thru-hiker and I said I was.  She informed me that although the permits did not cost anything I needed one to camp along Skyline Drive.  I told her I was not camping along Skyline Drive.  She asked what, are you thru-hiking the park in one day?  No, I said, I stay in hotels along the way.  She said, oh, well you don’t need a permit then.  I said, I know, I told you that.  She asked for my trail name and as she did she said you’re not in trouble or anything, I just want to make a note.  I said I’m not concerned about being in trouble, I haven’t done anything and I have her my trail name, Timbo (my trivia nickname).  She seemed sort of flustered but after making a tally mark in her little notebook (she never wrote down my trailname) she “released” me with a “have a good hike”!  
During the interrogation a fellow thru-hiker passed me and she asked for his permit which he had pinned to his pack so she let him continue on his way.  
As I got closer to Skyland, now only 5-miles away, I had a brief rise to encounter, nothing great, a 600’ rise over mile, no sweat, I thought.  I had been treating today’s hike from the get-go as an LSD day.  For those non-distance runners reading this, that’s Long, Slow Distance, not the drug, although you can get high from either.  I figured that since I had no more zero days and I had a reservation at Skyland and was not dependent on a shuttle, I could get there whenever I wanted.  The slower pace would be less stressful on my body and I would treat today almost like a maintenance day.  My projected arrival time was 5:30 so I’d still get in early enough to relax, eat and get stuff done.  
Well, 5-miles our, Hawksbill Mountain ruined the easy day aspect.  For the next 5-miles I was hiking on small boulders and rocks.  My feet were getting eaten up.  There is pretty much no way to avoid it so you just have to persevere, which I did, arriving at the Skyland-AT junction right on time, 5:30.  I still had 7/10 of mile walk up the drive to check-in.
While checking in I overheard one of the clerks tell a couple that David Gilmour was playing in the lounge that night. I said, David Golmour?  The Pink Floyd guitarist?  She said, not THAT David Gilmour, another one.  She said we’ve gotten that a lot.  The younger clerk said, I’ve never heard of any of them.  Oh well.
So I got to my room right around the corner from the office and with a great view of rhe mountains and city below and got cleaned up.  I then went to the tap room and got a beer, talking with two fellow hikers and then some other guests started asking us questions about the AT.  I also secured a Saturday morning ride to Elkwallow Gap with the bartender.
After one beer I went over to the restaurant and had a pork chop dinner with potatoes and Brussels Sprouts, nice and healthy, then back over to the tap room.
Jeb, the bartender said he’d drive me to Elkwallow Gap, (where Friday I will hike back to Skyland Resort from as a north-to-south slack pack day) where I will continue my northerly hike.  As it turns out, Jeb grew up in Virginia Beach and went to Bayside.  He’s 43 so graduated way after me.  We spent the evening talking about places in and around the beach.  So that’s two Bayside grads I’ve met along the AT.Around 10:30 I made my way back to my room and pretty much went to bed, propping my feet up with a pillow.So, for the day that’s 25.46 miles in 10 hours and 33 minutes with a total elevation gain of 5313 feet.  I am now at AT mile marker 933, 91 miles from Harper’s Ferry.  Skyland Resort along Skyline Drive is just to the southeast of Luray, VA.  5 days to go!!","Swift Run Gap

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615819,"I got up at 6:00am and got my stuff ready for a slack pack day.  I would be driven to Elkwallow Gap 18 miles north on the trail and hiking south back to Skyland.  That way I didn’t have to carry all my stuff, O could just leave it in my room, I had my room for another night and, I would not be in a rush to meet a driver or have to get somewhere before it closed.  
After packing just a windbreaker and my 2 electrolyte bottles, I didn’t carry any other water or my filter because I knew it would be cool and overcast today and 32 oz of fluid would last me just fine over 18 miles.
I had time to update the journal while I waited for Alison, my shuttle driver, to arrive.  Alison owns a local hostel.
Alison showed up on time at 8:00 and we were off to Elkwallow Gap.  On the way she saw a bear cross the road behind us and we both saw a deer cross the road ahead of us.  Alison’s son graduated as an environmental engineer out of Christopher Newport University so she has ties to Hampton Roads.  She dropped me off at 8:30 and at 8:34 I was off, headed back to Skyland.
I predicted that at a 25-minute per mile pace I should be back by 4:15.  I wanted to pare that down to 4:00 or possibly earlier so I would have more time to relax in the early evening.  As it was, with the tougher terrain in the north-south direction I got back at 4:15.
The AT portion that runs through Skyline Drive isn’t difficult overall but it does have its challenges with certain sections. I hit several throughout the day.
My initial 3-1/2 miles was mild but then I hit a sharp rise up the northern side of “Beahm’s Gap”.  It’s a sharp rise but only goes up about 400 feet over about 1/2 a mile so it looks worse than it is on an elevation chart.  After that and he Gap the terrain gently rolls up the southern side to the top of Pass Mountain.  There were no views today from the overlooks or mountaintops because a dog had settled over the area.  
After Pass Mountain came the decline down the southern side into  Thornton Gap and then the rise up the most challenging part of the day, the 1200’ 2-mile climb up Mary’s Rock.  It was a path strewn with a lot of rocks but I took it slow and it wasn’t that bad.  The top is all rock and while there are usually great views of Luray below, today it was just fog.  After Mary’s there’s a little dip into the Byrd’s Nest and then another rise up a higher mountain than Mary’s, The Pinnacle, where the trail takes you along the perimeter of the ridge.  Again, there was no view but the thick fog made it a unique hike along the edge of the mountain.  
The trail then ran down into Hughes River Gap and then up the northern side of Stony Man Summit.  By then the fog was really thick and I had a great photo opportunity when a deer appeared out of the fog on the trail but it trotted off as I got my camera out.  The trail ended at Skyland after a 2-mile hike/walk through the woods which reminded me of Hounds of the Baskervilles, hence the title of this segment, with the eerie thick fog.I passed several hikers today who were confused seeing me because they knew I was a northbounder yet here I was going south so I had to explain the strategy of slack packing south back to Skyland.  I’ll probably see most of them Saturday when I start once again from Elkwallow Gap and head north into the city of Front Royal.  Once I got back to Skyland I got cleaned up and cleaned out all my dirty clothes in the sink and set them out to dry.  They do not have guest laundry facilities here.  Then I sat down and made arrangements for shuttles and hotels for my last 4 days.  After that I went over to the tap room to eat a late lunch/early dinner so Ingot wings and fries and a tall Bud Light.  The NCAA Track and Field Championships came on ESPN so I sat in the Tap Room and watched that while enjoying one of the local musicians play for the evening.  At 10:30 I went back to my room and talked to Susan before crashing for the night.  Jeb, the bartender from Virginia Beach is picking me up at 8:00am to take me back to Elkwallow Gap.So for the day I had 18.32 miles in 7 hours and 35 minutes.  My total elevation climb was 4670 feet.  I am now at AT mile marker 951.5 so that puts me 72.5 miles from Harper’s Ferry with 4 hiking days to go.  The light at the end of the tunnel is appearing...","Skyland

I went to the coffee shop and got an orange juice and coffee which constituted my breakfast.  Jeb came a little early and by 7:45 we were off for Elkwallow Gap.  
Heading north this time, I started off with  a 2-1/2 mile 900’ rise.  My right foot was killing me.  I had damaged the 2nd and 3rd toes somehow.  I may have kicked a chair leg or maybe it was the 5-mile wall on the rocks or both.  At around 3-miles I had to stop.  I pulled out my first aid kit and fashioned a cushion of moleskin and duct taped the two toes together.  It seemed to help some and alleviated the pain about 50%.  The injury made the whole day a painful and unenjoyable endeavor.  I just wanted to get to Front Royal and I was more or less just trudging along.  
The trail in general offered little relief.  For the first 13 miles it was ups and downs.  At 13 I had some decent downs but then I hit a long switchback of rocks and roots which did my feet no good.  
Eventually I left the Shenandoah National Park at mile 967 and had one 250’ hill to navigate before the decline into US-522.  As I was ascending the hill I encountered the bear in the video.  It was about 75 yards away and off to my left.  I tried to zoom in and record and walk that direction as well but I inadvertently activated Bridgette and she started spitting out mileage statistics.  You can hear her on the video.  I have a longer video but it exceeded the threshold for upload.  The bear proceeded to get on the trail about 60 yards ahead of me and headed north.  I tried to catch up all the while filming but I had to be quiet as well and the path was littered with leaves and twigs besides small rocks.  As I was closing ground the bear heard me and took off up the far hill.  I continued on along the path and saw it sitting up there looking at me inquisitively.  I tried to film and shoot pictures again but it went over the hill and I lost it.  As I continued up I kept a lookout for it hoping it hadn’t gone far but it was gone.  Best part of my day though.
So I eased the last two miles to US-522 and called Flip, a local shuttle driver.  He took me to Quality Inn, about 4 miles, in Front Royal.  I checked in, got cleaned up then walked to a local pizza place where I downed 3/4 of a large stuffed pizza.  I then walked to Dollar General and got Epsom Salts, cloth medical tape for my toe and new insoles.  By the way, the Dr. Scholl’s gel insoles I bought four weeks ago only lasted less than 3 weeks.  As I was hiking one day I felt the rocks a lot more and I also felt squishy in my shoes.  There was nothing to do and I figured they had ruptured.  When I got to town that night and took my shoes off the insoles had basically fallen apart.  
I only saw three thru-hikers today and one was southbound.  One of the others was eating beside the trail and the other was on his phone.  It being a Saturday I saw a lot of day/weekend hikers.  As for the thru-hikers I was around from Marion through Waynesboro, I am pretty sure most, if not all of them are somewhere behind me.  I say that because I put up big miles with no zero days and I know they were hiking 16s at best and factored in zero days.  I would if I could but I used all mine up!  
I think I forgot to mention my fall a couple weeks back as well.  I hit a rock and while my trekking poles were bracing me, my balance was thrown off and I was slowly losing it backwards and to the right.  I tried to save it with the right trekking pole but it was a slow motion losing battle as I fell on my pack.  Then I couldn’t get up.  I’m glad no one was around.  I was trying to just sit up and get up but with the 30 pound pack I couldn’t do it.  I had to roll on my side and use my hands to raise myself up.  It probably looked very comical.  I wasn’t hurt, maybe my pride, but that was about it.  
As for songs in my head it has been pretty good lately.  Still Sly and the Family Stone’s Hot Fun In The Summertime and lately Leonard Cohen’s Hallelujah.  Every once in a while Do-Re-Mi.  At least I know the words to that one.
So check out the new photos and videos posted.  For the day, I hiked 19.21 miles in 7 hours and 46 minutes with a total elevation climb of 3739 feet.  I am at AT mile marker 970.7, so, that puts me 53.3 miles from Harper’s Ferry with Sunday, Monday and Tuesday to go.  I went back in my training log and looked and I haven’t had a zero day since May 27 in Roanoke.  In the 12 days since then I have hiked 247.21 miles.  My body hurts but that stretch got me back into the hunt for Harper’s Ferry.  Hopefully I can treat my toe effectively by tomorrow morning and make it the last three days.","Elkwallow Gap

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615947,"Before I start today I don’t think I explained about the horses mentioned in yesterday’s title.  
With about three miles to go I heard women and a lot of commotion behind me in the distance and it was getting closer.  Eventually I was confronted with three women, probably in their 60’s,on horseback from behind wanting to get around me.  They were profusely apologizing explaining that a downed tree on the trail they had been on blocked their way so they got on the AT to get to wherever they were going.  They said they knew horses weren’t allowed on the AT (it is posted for foot traffic only often).  I was in no mood to talk with them or to exude even an ounce of sympathy for their predicament.  I put on my “I’m not pleased” face and scowled at them as they rode past me.  15 minutes later here they come again, apologizing and riding out the way they came in.  I found out why a few minutes later when I hit a 20 yard rock scree.  Those horses would not have made it over the array of bowling ball-to-pack size rocks.  I had also noticed that prior to there, one of the horses legs had sank deep into the dirt abutment where a log step had been placed on the trail.  That horse could have easily thrown the rider, fallen, or broken its leg.  There’s a reason why the AT is limited to foot traffic only.  I do not know why these women, when confronted with a fallen tree blocking their path on a  horse-approved trail, didn’t just get off their horses and guide them around the fallen tree, or, turn around and go back the way you came.  To take the AT because you have now legitimized it as an “emergency” and exception I’m your own mind is wrong, not only for the foot hikers but for the safety of the poor animal you are riding.
Also to close out last night, I ended up across the street from the hotel at a place called Pave Mint.  I sat at the end of the bar and enjoyed a few IPAs and worked on the journal.  A guy struck up a conversation with me about the AT (I showed him my toe, too), local history and that turned into national and world history and geography and several other fields.  It turned out my friend was Christian, owner of Pave Mint.  He also assured me it wasn’t going to rain on Sunday so I have a bone to pick with him.  Anyhow, we hit it off well but around 10:00 he finally had to go as his wife urged him out and I needed to get my sleep so I left when he did.  I made good friends as several employees wished me well on tomorrow’s hike and said they’d see me tomorrow.
So, on to today.
I got up at 6:00 and since I was slack packing from Ashby Gap south to US-522 and then on into Front Royal again, I didn’t have a lot to do.  I threw out my insoles and put in a new pair.  I also ate the largest slice of the three leftover pizza slices figuring I’d eat the other two post-hike.  Around 6:50 I went to the lobby to get coffee and OJ.  I downed the OJ and brought the coffee with me.  Flip was right on time and me and a fellow hiker piled in.  The other hiker, a 20-ish guy from Fredericksburg, was hiking north from Ashby Gap whereas I was going south.
(As I’m writing this, I’m back at the Pave Mint taking pain medication (beer) and getting involved in conversations with locals so I keep having to stop updating the journal and saving it.  Hopefully I’ll wrap it all up here soon).
So back to the hike.  From the parking area at Ashby Gap, I had a short interconnecting trail to the actual AT and I never thought to ask, which direction do I go?  The AT is marked with white blazes, the size of a chaulkboard eraser, but it is not usually marked directionally.  So, I looked at my elevation chart and chose to go left, more out of my innate submarine navigational expertise that is built into my core than anything else.  The other hiker had left 5 minutes before me and he was heading north.  Several minutes later he passed me, frustrated, because he was NOW heading north and therefore I South, my navigational radar and modest pride intact.  
So, now assured I was going in the right direction, I concentrated on the hike and less on my Runkeeper GPS.  Out of Ashby I took a long nearly 4 mile sloping rise to Sky Meadows.  Despite the forecast for rain, all was good.  No critters to speak of and I had only come across a few weekend hikers.  As I made my wat down through Whiskey Hollow and up towards Trillo Trail, still no rain, although it had been overcast all morning.  As I got into Manassas Gap Shelter on top of the mountain it did start to rain but it was really light in the woods and actually refreshing.  
The refreshment of the rain ended shortly thereafter when at mile 12 near Linden, VA, the sky opened up and just dumped wind and rain on the AT for the next 10 miles for me.  At that point it was a simple matter of getting to the finish line and not enjoying the scenery.
I did, however, take time to photo a rabbit that thought it was gonna hide from me behind a little sprig of grass and a wild turkey on the trail.  I also saw several of those small orange spotted newts I wrote of before but I didn’t stop to photo them because you’ve seen them before in previous posts.  
So the “Hokie”, or turkey I came across was during the downpour and it was just ahead of me on the trail going same direction, maybe 25 yards up.  I pulled out my cell phone to get photos and it had veered off to the right and into the brush.  It seemed frantic and I heard peeps so I didn’t know if it was disoriented and trying to find chicks and/or knew of my presence and was trying to avoid me.  I wanted nothing to do with a turkey (I’d already heard stories where they can attack) so I was content just trying to photograph it from the trail during the downpour.  I got one decent photo that I posted.  I left it to do its business.  
So, while hiking south trying to get to my pick up point I run across none other than Shoelaces and Dutchman, my camping buddies from WAY back on like May 9.  I had heard that Shoelaces got rousted out of his tent in the middle of the night by armed SWAT the night of the AT murder so I asked him about it.  He told me that he had heard the commotion (not the murder, but the authorities scouring the area) and thought it was obnoxious hikers making a lot of noise at 4:00am.  When they showed up at their camp they identified themselves as armed police and ordered everyone out of their tents.  It must have been something for the hikers but understandable considering what had happened.  Anyhow, Dutchman and Shoelaces were hiking shirtless in the rain and were starting to cool off so we said our goodbyes and parted ways, they north and me south.  I won’t see them again as I am some 15 miles ahead of them with only 32 miles to go.
My toe was feeling better in the rain and I was able to cruise along.  I think I run better in the rain and therefore I think I hike better in the rain.  I don’t know if that’s actually true or not but it doesn’t matter.  It is my reality.  
So 2-miles our I called Flip.  I didn’t mean to call him but to text him but my fingers and my phone and everything on me was wet and I couldn’t operate the phone.  I was fortunate that I COULD call him.  I told him where I was and that I’d be at US-522 at 3:45 and he said he’d be there.  2 miles to go, game on!  I got to the pick-up point at 3:36, Flip showed up at 3:39. I won again over the shuttle drivers!!  I covered my last 2-miles in under 35 minutes.  I hate to lose.  
So after Flip dropped me off at the hotel I took a Epsom bath and then a shower, changed and went to Pave Mint for beer and dinner.  I am now finally concluding the day’s journal still there, wrapping up my lay beer.  I still have laundry to do.A side note about this place, it reminds me of a day excursion I had the opportunity to take with my neighbor growing up, Cutch Armstrong.  One day Cutch and I were out together, I don’t recall why, Cutch, after all, is three years older than me (a senior when I was a freshman at the junior high) so it isn’t like we hung out.  But, this particular day we were.  Anyhow, he took me to this out-of-the-way beer joint in Virginia Beach and we drank a few “tall necks”, rare to find at that time.  Anyhow, that always stuck with me and I treasure the opportunities to pop into small out-of-the -way beer joints, drink the local beer and shoot the breeze with the locals.  I always think of Cutch and that experience all those years ago.  So here I am at The Pave Mint in Front Royal, VA, doing just that.  So, for the day, 20.23 miles in 7 hours and  56 minutes.  Total elevation climb of 3777 feet.  I am now at AT mile marker 990.6 so I am 33.4 miles from Harper’s Ferry with Monday and Tuesday to go.  I understand it’s supposed to rain tomorrow...","Ashby Gap

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616061,"My day started with rain in the forecast.  Not something I was looking forward to knowing I had “The Rollercoaster” and 21.5 miles overall today.
Flip was early so at 6:50 we set off for Ashby Gap.  This time I would be hiking north with a full pack as opposed to yesterday’s slack pack south from Ashby.  
We got there pretty quick and at 7:21am I was off.  It wasn’t raining yet but it was looming.  I had already put my pack cover on but figured with the overall temperatures in the low-to-mid 60’s I would forego the poncho today and when it rained I’d just go it wet.  I get wet in the poncho anyway with sweat, I’d rather get wet with rainwater.  It started raining about 1/2 hour into the hike.
So the first 3-1/2 miles out of Ashby were small ups and downs but I was dreading the upcoming “rollercoaster”.  It is a 13.5-mile section with ten ascents and descents.  It doesn’t look like much on the elevation chart, the largest rises only 500’, but it is a beast!!  I think what makes it difficult is the terrain of mainly rocks and roots.  Very little of the trail is dirt or leaf/pine needles.  What made it way worse and increased the difficulty was that the rain made everything slick and the dirt turned to a muddy mire.  I fell hard twice, the first time slipping on rocks and landing on my left hip.  All was good though except for maybe a bruise I’ll get now but no lingering pain so I lucked out.  The second time was on a vast array of exposed tree roots.  I landed on my left wrist and right side, having fallen forward.  Again, I lucked out as I had no damage.  
With the rain and slippery conditions, today was no day for flora or fauna.  Today was a day to make it from point A to point B in one piece.  My times were drastically slower than normal and from the getgo, I was not having a great time being wet and sore from my right toe injury.  I knew I would not make my 4:30pm pick-up time with Jay the cab driver but I figured I’d wait until 3:00 or so to call and update him with an amended predicted time.  
Hardly anyone was on the trail but I did get passed early on by Crusher and Gunner.  I was pretty sure I passed them right back as I assumed they stopped at the next Shelter (I later found out I was correct).  Crusher, what a trail name.  Crush what?  He passed me then stops.  Should call him Candy Crusher.  I dwelled on him for the next few miles.  Who am I?  I am the one they call (wait for it)...TIMBO!  The mere mention of the name would envelope mere mortal AT hikers in awe.  I could envision Crusher turning ashen with wide fearful eyes, a quivering lip and an uncontrolled shaking.  That’s right, Crusher, you are in the presence of (wait for it)...TIMBO!  So, my gradiose thoughts that carried me through the day would come back to haunt me. Read on...
At 16 miles I called Jay and said he better make it 6:00 instead of 4:30.  I was that far off pace, averaging barely under 30 minutes/mile.  I was nearly through The Rollercoaster and had 5.5 miles to go.  I think it was at Crescent Rock, an overlook that my last misfortune occurred.  At the top of the overlook was a tree with two white blazes, one offset and above the other.  What that means is there is a turn and the position of the top blaze dictates the direction.  It appeared to me to be a hairpin turn so I took it only to realize several seconds later that I was going down a dead end so I reversed course looking for the white blaze.  I saw the double blaze on the tree and took it, not realizing that I was now heading south, not north.  I passed the VA/WV border sign again and just thought I had crossed the border again.  I also crossed a stream over large rocks and just thought, oh, there’s a similar crossing a mile or so back.  I was hiking on thinking I was in my last 4-miles when I come upon non other than Crusher going the opposite direction.  We stopped to chat and Insaid where are you going?  He said the Shelter after Blackburn and then on to Harper’s Ferry tomorrow.  I said well where are you going right now?  He looked at me bewildered and said, the Shelter.  I said, well, you are going the wrong way, I am going to Blackburn right now.  He said well one of us is turned around.  I assured him it was not me.  He broke out his computer app guide, Gutthooks (which a lot of hikers use) and pointed out that I was the one going in the wrong direction.  Crap!!  So we hiked together on his direction , the correct one, for the next mile or so.  That’s what I get for belittling Crusher in my mind during my hike and building up my own superhuman persona.  I humbled myself as we hiked and admitted to him that I had been a navigation guy in submarines.  We both agreed the AT is no submarine.
I called Jay from the point I had gotten turned around and amended my pick-up time to 6:45 and Crusher waited.  He didn’t have to do that.  He probably didn’t want me to get lost again.  
Crusher is a 35-year old single male from Austin, TX.  He worked for 3M but quit to hike the trail.  He said he has an opportunty to reapply for his job when he finishes the AT in September.  He has no debt (his house is paid for) and he has multiple marketable skill sets that he feels he would not have a problem landing a job post-AT.  We never discussed my grandiose egotistical fantasies from earlier.
A short while after we resumed hiking he peeled off to get water and I continued on.  About 15 minutes later I stopped to finish my electrolyte fluids since I was now 3-1/2 miles out and Crusher passed me.  I didn’t mind.  
I got through The Rollercoaster, having done a portion of it twice, and now hit the last three-mile flat stretch.  I almost could have kept my 6:00 estimate as I ended up arriving at around 6:20.  The Blackburn Trail Center is 3/10 of a mile off the main trail and just before the turn off, Gunner, one of Crusher’s buddies, caught up with me.  At the turn-off, Crusher was waiting for him.  We stopped and talked again and I told Gunner what had happened.  I told both of them that if I had not ran into him and he corrected me, I may have gone some 4-miles one way, 8-miles round trip, out of my way making my day a 29.5, not a 21.5.  I had been thinking of it hiking alone those last few miles and I thought, I should somehow show my appreciation to Crusher.  So, I gave him $100 and said thanks for saving my behind.  I told him to consider it a parting gift since I was off trail tomorrow while they continued on.  Gunner took a photo of me handing Crusher the $100 but I didn’t think to have him send it to me.  At least they will remember the name (wait for it)...TIMBO, just not the way I had imagined.
Jay was right on time and we drove to Charles Town , WV about 17 miles away to Hampton Inn.  I was wet, cold and beat.  A long hot shower helped.  I’m now at Appleby’s updating the journal after enjoying a full rack of ribs.  Dessert is still in my future.
So Jay will pick me up at 6:30am tomorrow and I will complete the last 11.8 miles of AT into Harper’s Ferry.  Yea!!I uploaded all of the elevation charts that cover my consecutive hiking days going back to Daleville on May 28 at mile marker 729.1 through tomorrow’s Harper’s Ferry one at mile marker 1024.8.  For anyone who might do the math, I will NOT be doing an “extra” 4.3 miles to round that to an even 300.  I’m over 300 with getting lost, detours and making connections.  
So for the day I had 23.21 miles in 11 hours and 5 minutes, a long day.  I am now at AT mile marker 1012.2 and have 11.8 to Harper’s Ferry with one day to go.  Think I’ll make it???","Ashby Gap

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616103,"I had set my alarm for 5:30am but ended up waking at 5:09am so I just got up.  I was excited about last day and Harper’s Ferry.  I packed up my stuff one final time for the year, checked out, and ate some eggs, bacon, a bage, OJ and coffee for breakfast before Jay picked me up at 6:30am.  It was a quick drive to the Blackburn Trail Center and I was off at 7:10 for Harper’s.
I was determined to just enjoy the day and not rush.  I wasn’t going to meander in, I wanted to get there by 12:30, but I also didn’t want to get hurt on the last day and my body is feeling the hike.  
One great thing about today’s 12-miler is it was almost all flat.  The rises and falls were minimal and of short duration which added to the enjoyment of the last day.  What topped it off was cool temps in the low-to-mid 60’s and sunny skies.  I was hoping to see a bear and/or snake on the last day.  I did see a wild turkey and two deer though.  The turkey is hard to spot in the photo.  Several hikers passed me and I talked to each briefly.  Some I later saw and spoke to in Harper’s Ferry.  When I thought I was within 1.5 miles, I came to a sign that said, Appalachian Trail Conservancy - 1.9 miles.  So I followed the white blazes along the route.  It seemed to go on forever.  I came to a stairway leading up to a road and another sign saying, ATC - .8 miles.  UGH!!  I walked along the road and over the bridge that spanned the Shenandoah River.  When I got to the other side I passed a sign that said ATC - .5 miles.  UGH!, come on, already.  It seemed to take forever.  I followed the signs and went up another hill and then through the city streets following the blazes until I came to get another sign, ATC - .2 miles.  OK, closer! I followed the blazes, turned a corner and I was there!  The Appalachian Trail Conservancy and Visitor’s Center.  Packs and trekking poles lined the wall outside.  So I took off my pack and went in.  I talked to a lady and asked about photos so she came outside and took my “official” photo that goes into the 2019 binder.  I am northbound hiker #644 to come through the center. She also took a couple photos with my camera which I posted.  She also got me the 1990 binder and I looked up the Polaroid of my friends Mike and Linda which I also posted.  After leaving the ATC I went by the post office but they didn’t have any boxes big enough for my pack.  So I walked on down the road and was able to check in at the Quality Inn.  I asked about a box for my pack and they just so happened to have one the right size that a chair had come in.  So they gave me that and after getting cleaned up I packed my pack and trekking poles in the box, minus the clothes I am wearing, my ID, credit card, cash and a freezer bag of miscellaneous stuff like my phone charger, windbreaker and AT elevation page.So the maintenance guy at the hote drove me back to the post office where I mailed the box with my pack to my office.  I then walked down the street to the train station but it turns out its just a museum and I don’t need a ticket anyhow.  I just get on the MARC train in the morning that takes me to a Metro station that takes me to Dulles.  So then I went to The Rabbit Hole for lunch and here I sit in the afternoon sun catching up the journal and drinking beer.So, for the day I logged 12.66 miles in 5 hours and 15 minutes.  My elevation climb was 1560 feet.  So since May 6 when I began in Damascus, I have logged 554 AT miles and 593.82 miles overall, including my bike up and down Whitetop during Trail Days.  No telling how much weight I’ve lost.  I guess I’ll weigh myself when I get home and add a post note to this page.So the plan now is to catch the MARC into DC tomorrow morning then Metro to Dulles where I catch my flight at 1:00 to Norfolk where we land at 1:59pm.  I already have a one-hour massage scheduled at Fuller Massage for 3:00 tomorrow.  Then Thursday it is off to New Orléans for my submarine reunion overthe weekend.  I won’t look at any AT stuff for about a month but then will start planning next year’s leg.  In the meantime I’ll let my body heal over the next week and then resume my usual running.  So thanks for following along and I’ll pick up where I left off next year!!...","Blackburn Trail Center

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625977,"I needed to make up the section of trail I had been kicked off of near Marion, VA due to the murder on the AT back on May 11.  I decided to go back and complete it over the Columbus Day weekend for a couple reasons.  One, it was a longer holiday weekend and two, it coincided with the Richmond Folk Festival which Susan and I had attended the year before.  
So, I made plans to complete the 12-mile hike that week prior to the festival and then drive straight from the Marion area to Richmond.  I asked Susan if she wanted to hike it with me and after a little trepidation and some convincing by me, she agreed.
On Tuesday, October 8th, we set off for the Wilson-Bolling hotel in Wytheville.  I had stayed there previously during my AT hike and decided, being only 15 miles, so a 20-minute drive, it would be the best place to stay.  I also contacted Bubba, my area shuttle driver, and found out he'd be available to drive us as needed.
Our plan then was to get up early on Wednesday and drive to the Sunoco station off of I-81 in Groseclose which is right on the AT and about a mile from where I'd been kicked off by the police in May.  We'd arrange for Bubba to pick us up there and drive us north to Ceres, VA and then back hike southbound to my SUV.  This way, we weren't dependent on Bubba or any assistance and if need be, we could take as much time as needed.
I wanted an early start so Bubba and I agreed to meet at Sunoco at 7:00 that morning.
Susan had to get up pretty early and we left the hotel around 6:30am headed to Gloseclose.  Since we were coming back to the car we didn't have to take much so I did carry my pack but it only had fluids in it and my poncho and windbreaker.  
Bubba was right on time and he drove us over the mountain to Ceres.  Susan and I started the hike just around sun-up and headed back to Gloseclose.  The hike that day was going to be relatively easy, but Susan hadn't hiked so I wasn't sure how she'd take the few hills we had.  The opening mile or so was pretty flat, which was good to get her warmed up, and took us to the base of a small 400-foot hill.  We hiked up that pretty easily but that brought us down to the base of our biggest challenge of the day, Big Walker Mountain.  The AT route took us up about 800 feet over about 1-1/2 miles.  We kept a steady adn comfortable pace and again Susan handled it pretty easily.  Once atop Big Walker, we had 4-miles down and 8 to go.  The start of the last challenge, Gullion (Little Brushy) Mountain, was 2 miles away in Crawfish Valley.  So, we had a nice 2-mile 800-foot descent into the valley.  That took more of a toll on Susan than anything else.  Downs can be worse than ups often.  WE had a 1-mile 600-foot ascent up Gullion and then a 3/4-mile walk across it to a 400-foot descent followed by a 1-1/2 mile relative flat stretch before a final descent of 500-feet and then a flat 2-miles into Gloseclose.  
We saw some deer along the way, but aside from that, things were pretty uneventful.  We did pass the spot where the murder happened and hikers had adorned it as a makeshift memorial.  
In all, we covered 12.71 miles in 5 hours and 45 minutes for a 27-minute per mile average, so I think Susan did very well.  We were back at the SUV at 1:40pm.  From there we drove to the Holiday Inn in Roanoke, VA a 1-1/2 hour drive, and relaxed the rest of Wednesday and Thursday, playing a lot of Buzztime trivia and drinking beer at Buffalo Wild Wings.  We drove on to the Delta Hotel on Friday and spent Friday, Saturday and Sunday at the Folk Festival, spent Monday at the hotel as well and then drove to daughter and son-in-law's home in Williamsburg on Tuesday and home on Wednesday.
So, a week-long trip that covered hiking, trivia, music, relatives and plenty of beer.","VA-42 - Ceres, VA

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/636970,"I got up at 5:15am, a little apprehensive about the first day’s hike.  It has been nearly two years since I last did an extended hike on the AT.  I’m in great shape, having been pretty consistent with my distance running with walks and cycling sprinkled in, but, the AT is another beast altogether.  
I was packed up and on the trail by 6:15, just after sunrise, with a chilly 42 degree morning.  I was in hiking shorts and a windbreaker over my tech-T but the windbreaker came off before I’d gone 1/2 a mile.  Fortunately, for an 18 mile day, the first 3 miles out of Harper’s Ferry were along the very flat, wide and even C&O Canal towpath.  It’s where mules used to tow barges along the Potomac.  That helped get my “hiking legs” acclimated.
Then I hit the actual trails.  Overall, the rise/fall coming out of Harper’s Ferry isn’t bad.  The rises were gradual and nothing over 1000’.  Nice change of pace from Virginia and the southern trail states.  What was not welcome was the rocks.  I knew to expect them in Pennsylvania and was hoping they would crop up too soon in Maryland, but they did.  These take a great toll has your feet are twisted and turned every which way navigating through the fields of platter, football and softball-sized rocks that make up the trail.  Besides the twisting and turning, the kicking of rocks unintentionally doesn’t feel great either. I stumbled several times only to be saved by my trekking poles.  Lifesaver, trekking poles.  Don’t want to face plant into a ground of rocks.
Eventually, the rocks just wear your feet and energy down.  The intermittent dirt and tree debris paths are a short-lived welcome relief.
There weren’t too many people on the trail.  I got passed by several young hikers, one blonde pigtailed lanky guy twice.  He must have stopped off for water or something and hence passed me again.  He said he and his friends were attempting the 4-state challenge.  That’s a 40-mile trek through the last section of Virginia, continuing through West Virginia, then Maryland and ending at the north side of the Mason-Dixon Line in Pennsylvania.  All in 24-hours.  It’s a bragging rights thing.  I thought about attempting it to start 2020, but I nixed the idea realizing I would have been starting out a new year and needed the time to acclimate myself plus I wanted to focus on the longer-term goal and not the shorter one.  If I had been in my teens/twenties, like they were, then yes.I had one technical setback that I realized early on, fortunately.  I carry two power banks, one 26,400 mAh, and the other a small cylindrical one at only about 5000.  Well, the main one drained down in less than two hours and my phone was at 38%.   Why is this important?  Because I rely on the Runkeeper app that utilizes GPS to travk myself during the hike.  It lets me know at one-mile intervals how far I’ve gone and what my pace is.  I can then extrapolate out and figure when I’ll get to a certain spot or finish for the day.  Also, I’m reliant on my phone to call for a ride to town, and a hotel, when the day’s segment is complete.  So I had to switch to my smaller back-up power bank and that only got me through 10 miles.  So, I had to turn the phone off and do the last 8-miles by trail white blazes and my guidebook page alone.  I was averaging 22 minutes a mile prior to powering off the phone so I knew I could figure 25 minutes to be conservative and that based on that I should finish the day at 1:30.  At Fox Gap, About a mile from my destination, I stopped to talk to two guys checking out the Civil War monuments and respective information boards.  Turns out both are vets, one Army Ranger and the other I forget.  One lives in Belize now and the other Switzerland.  We had a good short discussion before we trekked on north along the trail.  They were stopping about 1/4 mile before me at Dahlgren’s Back Pack Campground.  Named for Dahlgren, the cannon guy.  So I made it, sore feet and all, to Turner’s Gap off a section of highway 40.  1:18 pm, so just over 7 hours and pretty close to my 10-mile mark guesstimate.  I only stopped for about five minutes to chat with the vets and prior to that once yo change my power bank and take fluids and one other time to take fluids, both 2-minute stops.  Don’t like to let the legs tighten up.  I tried half-heartedly to hitch a ride to Hagerstown 13 miles away while walking that direction but quickly figured, F-that.  I’m calling Uber.  So I rested against a telephone pole in the grass for 1/2 hour until it got there.  I was at the Hampton Inn Hagerstown just before 2:30.I checked in then finally took my Solomon’s off in the room and rested on the bed while my phone recharged and I recharged the power banks.  I fell asleep watching some mindless TV but woke 20 minutes later when someone called me.  Good thing.  I didn’t want to sleep all night.  I took a long shower and then headed to Texas Steakhouse across the highway for a big steak dinner and beer.  Streak for calories and protein and beer for calories and pain meds.  No, just because it is beer.  My feet ache but they should be good to go by tomorrow morning.  Another 18-miler to Raven Rock Hollow off of MD 491.  At least tomorrow is a slack pack day.  I’m coming back to the same hotel in Hagerstown so most of my gear will stay in the room.  I’ll only have my pack, fluids, and my phone stuff.  Drops pack weight from 32 pounds to 12.  Should help my feet out.  May be a speed day!","Harper’s Ferry, WV

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637049,"I stopped off at Walgreens last night after Texas Roadhouse and picked up Epsom salts and another power bank.  Great stuff, Epsom salts.  I soaked for 20 minutes and then watched more mindless tv while my three power banks charged.  I actually had to wake up in the middle of the night and switch them out because I only have one power adapter plug.  Might have to get another one.  
So I slept in a little, until 6:00, but I was packed up and out the door by 6:30.  I slack packed since I’m coming back to the same room.  So just my windbreaker, fluids.  Uber picked me up at 6:45 and at 7:15 I began hiking again from where I left off.  
I forgot to mention that The Old South Mountain Inn is where I wrapped up yesterday and began today.  It is one of the oldest public houses on the AT and apparently as once a brothel.  It’s a restaurant now but it was closed.  Across the street is the Dahlgren Chapel, a Gothic stone structure.
So I was a little nervous about my feet but they felt pretty good this morning.  I cruised through the opening miles at about a 22-minute per mile average and I didn’t stop until just after 6 miles for some fluids and to check my power bank. The one that was acting up seemed to be working and my phone was holding a charge around 80%.   I also switched my phone to airplane mode so that may have helped save battery power.  Runkeeper still worked fine and tracked me.  I even had my hiking companion, Brigette, the French-accented Runkeeper voice that tells me how great I’m doing every mile.
I had several deer cut across the trail in front of me at one point.  Then they waited on the other side of the trail just looking at me as I passed by.  As soon as I passed them, they all took off.  I also saw a Eastern Towhee, a colorful black, white and orange bird.  This one had a black tufted head.  Looked kind of like a punk rocker with a spiked hairdo.  I couldn’t get a picture quick enough though.
I saw the same two guys from yesterday too, the one from Switzerland and Belize.  They were taking a good break so I only spent about 30 seconds chatting and moved on.  Came across a small group on 10-year olds too.  They were doing a three/day hike of the Maryland AT section, with a chaperon of course.  Today was a 12-mile section for them.I saw other hikers today going in both directions, including some through hiker southbounders.  Nobody passed me today though, not that it’s a competition or anything. So I got to MD-491 ahead of schedule, at 2:00.  I didn’t have good cell service though.  I had to walk uphill up 491 for about 1/4 mile where I was able to call Uber.  1/2 hour later I was headed back to the Hampton Inn.  My feet were sore but not like yesterday.  I soaked in Epsom salts right away then went to Texas Roadhouse again to eat.  Hadn’t eaten since my last time there last night except for some jerky and pistachios today.  Ate good though.  Two pork chops, broccoli and a baked potato.  And beer.  Not too much though.  At 7:20, back in hotel updating this journal and prepping for tomorrow. Tomorrow.  Long one.  23 miles.  Will be staying in Chambersburg, PA after that.  We’ll see how feet hold up...","Turner’s Gap

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637253,"Yeow! 23.1 miles.  My trail legs/feet aren’t there yet but it wasn’t overall too bad.  My feet feel better but my legs still can’t handle the uphills like two years ago.  They’ll come around in a few days. 
I got started at 6:53am, knowing I had a long day.  My first leg was an immediate 500 foot ascent over the first 1/2 mile.  It was about 42 degrees out but I went with the trusty shorts and short sleeved shirt.  I was warm enough just fine after that 1/2 mile climb.  Gets the blood flowing and wakes up the legs too.  Don’t get me wrong, I’d rather a flat or down but I’d you gotta do a hill, and this was a short one, better to get it over with first thing when you’re fresh.  
It was a Saturday so lots of people out, day, weekend and short-term/long-term hikers.  Still, the AT is long and it isn’t like it is congested.  I went miles without seeing anyone, then at other times had to stop to let people pass (a trail courtesy.)
At five miles I came to the Mason-Dixon Line, the border separating MD/PA.  A welcome milestone.  So, GA, NC, TN, VA, WV and MD in the rear-view mirror.  The trail guide mentioned that Mason-Dixon marked the border with 3-5 foot long limestone blocks weighing 300-600 pounds each every mile.  I looked but I didn’t see any.  I didn’t spend a lot of time looking, either though.  So shortly after that, at 6-1/4 miles, I stopped for my first fluid break, about two minutes, then back at it.  The Penn hills were rolling and no Boulder fields of any extent to speak of by the rocks were everywhere with intermittent rock free paths every now and then.  All in all not that bad, in retrospect, but the uphills did take it out of me, only because I’m not used to them yet.  Something I learned first year is take them slow but keep going, do not stop.  Lactic acid will build up and you could tighten up if you do.  Slow down all you want but keep going.  Every hill has a flat/downside.  Those aren’t always welcome.  The worst rock field is a downhill one.  Rather fall going up then down any day.  
So I took another break around 13 miles at Old Forge Park and campgrounds.  This one was longer, 10 minutes.  I took off my shoes and dumped the debris, ate some jerky and energy gels and took fluids.  I knew with 10 miles to go I could down most of my fluids with one more stop at 18 miles and a little something for the end.  Losing the fluid weight on the pack would help with the fatigue.  So I left about 12 oz I’m my water bottle and 8 oz I’m each electrolyte bottle.  
Soon thereafter, mile 14, was the bane of the day, the 1.8 mile long 1000’ ascent to Chimney Rocks.  If I hadn’t already done 14 miles, and had another 10 to look forward to, it may not have been as grueling.  Well, it was a pain, both mentally and physically.  But, I made it, of course.  After that, the trail was basically flat, some short rolling hills and even some rock mounds/small fields to endure, but I just counted down the miles as I went.  I actually finished sooner than I thought, it being only 23.1 miles and not 24 miles like I’d originally thought.  So I got to MD-491 at 5:10pm.  All in all a 10 hour 16 minute hike.  I had cell service and called Uber only to be told no one was available.  Sucks!!  I walked another 3/10 of a mile down the road to Bonfire, a hamburger joint.  So I kept trying Uber while I ordered a soda (rare for me.  Sugar fix though) and a hot dog.  I tried the only cab companies (2) and Lyft.  No luck.  Around 6:20, I was like, screw this, I guess I’m either waking (8 miles to my hotel, La Quinta in Chambersburg) or thumbing.  I got about 3/10 of a mile down the road with no luck and my phone rang.  It was one of the cab companies saying their driver was in front of Bonfire waiting for me.  I said I’m down the road, tell them to drive down, can’t miss me, sad looking hiker with a backpack.  So I headed back and the driver met me halfway.  
La Quinta was a welcome pleasure.  I took a long shower then went to, the nearest restaurant, lo and behold, a Texas Roadhouse!! So I ate a dinner of, heck, I forget now but it had broccolli and a plain baked potato.  I think it was either salmon or grilled chicken. I had one Sunday and one Saturday.  And lots of water.  Beer too but lots of water.body very sore, especially feet.  Chafed too because of sweat.  but slept well and Sunday morning I felt about 80%.  No chafing either next morning.  Body’s a wonderful thing for fixing itself.Sunday I got up late, 7:50, and walked down the road about 3/10 mile (everything is 3/10 mile away in PA) and ate a big breakfast.  I came back to room, watched 3 mindless movies while planning my next few days and then did laundry.  At 3:15 I went to where else, Texas Roadhouse, watched the NASCAR race, drank water and medicinal beer and had dinner, broccolli, baked potato and whatever meat I didn’t have last night.So now I‘be got my journal caught up, I’m watching (or is playing in background) more mindless tv, my hike for the next two days is planned and my ride comes at 6:30 to take me back to Caledonia State Park to pick up where I left off at mile 1085.  I’ve already arranged for a shuttle driver to pick me up 19 miles later at Pine Grove Furnace State Park.  Not before I down 1/2 gallon of ice cream at Pine Grove General Store and get my souviner wooden spoon.  This is an AT challenge to commemorate the 1/2 way point of the AT.  Looking forward to it...","Raven Rock Hollow

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637226,"So before I update my journal, I felt it might be beneficial to some readers to know what has, and has not, worked for me during the 1st half of the 2200 mile AT.
First off, I’m older (not old) so there are things that one has to realize and plan accordingly for.  Although I consider myself to be in good shape, it takes a while for my brain to tell the rest of my body that, particularly my legs.  Yes, it hurts getting out of bed, or a sleeping bag, whatever the case may be, but give it 15-30 minutes and the blood flows and all feels good, really.
People may be far and few on the AT or you may see no one for hours or miles.  It’s not a race, so don’t get intimidated by others, “hike your own hike,” as the popular AT slogan goes.  Easier said than done, if you are like me, very competitive.  Just try to get in tune over time with your own body and you’ll be fine.  I tend to go basically the same pace whether uphill, downhill or on the flats.  It surprises me but the Runkeeper GPS doesn’t lie, so it is what is is.  That’s an overall average though.  Of course I go faster on the flats, but it takes a little while to recover from the transition.
Also, downs are not necessarily a welcome relief.  In most cases, it is more strenuous and precarious going down than on the flats or going up.  Plus, I’d rather fall going up than going down.  
Pack really light.  Really light.  And know your pack weight.  Mine is 32 pounds fully loaded.  That’s all fluids (128oz), my food and my hammock-tent.  The psychological good news is as I hike, I drink the fluids, and at 8 pounds per gallon of water that helps a lot as I tire through the day’s hike, 1/4 of my pack weight. Also, Eating my food/vitamins depletes my pack weight over time, whereas my fluids are replaced daily.  I tend to hike with the fluids I’ll need for essentially a marathon or 26-mile hike.  I don’t like to “hope” that water is available, because it isn’t always, particularly if there has been no rain for several days.  Everyone is different.  A gallon of water suits me but may not work for everyone.  Also, real critical, fluids are not water alone.  I carry 64oz. Of clean water and (2) 16oz. bottles of water with Nuun electrolyte mixed in.  The Nuun electrolyte comes in effervescent tablet form so really good for the hike.  Electrolytes are critical, so plan on them or you could seize up (done that) or worse. Depending on the distance and projected water availability I may carry 32-64 oz. of “unfiltered” water as well.  As for filtering, I’ve used a Sawyer water filter since starting the AT.  Keep it clean (backwash it from time to time) and it’s all you need.  It’ll filter 64 oz. of water in about 3 minutes.  Even muddy rain puddles or drainage ditches.  Done both.  DON’T drink unfiltered/untreated water no matter what others say or because you are out in nature.  Giardia is a terrible parasite (never had it) and it will lay you up with stuff coming out both ends for a week.  I even treat hotel water (think of Flint, MI.). 
Let’s see, other good stuff to know...
Get a microfiber towel and hang it from your pack strap. These are great for everything from blowing your nose to wiping stuff off.  For some reason, my nose seems to run a lot when I’m hiking so all I’ve got to do is reach over and get my towel and take care of business.  I don’t need to stop hiking.  Sounds gross, probably, but so do many other things I won’t even bother to mention.  
Some of the other “musts” that have worked wonders for me:
Trekking poles.  I originally thought those were for sissies.  Well, I guess I’m a sissy. Invest in the best you can afford.  Make sure they collapse for storage, in or off the trail.  At times on the trail, as I’ll experience soon, you’ll trek rock fields or other terrain where you don’t need them or they are actually a menace.  Mine fold up in three segments and I can attach them to straps on the front outside of my pack.  That way you can navigate treacherous terrain using your hands.  My go to trekking poles are by Leki, a micro-fiber style.  Also, go with a reputable company.  One of mine lost a tip during my GA-VA leg.  I got it temporarily repaired at an outfitter along the way but when I got home I reported it to Leki and the replaced the pair no questions asked.  They wanted the old pair back so they could figure out what went wrong and sent me a prepaid box.  Trekking poles go through a lot of wear and tear besides snagging on things occasionally, many times by choice to keep you from falling. They help tremendously with energy conservation and stability up and down terrain as well as on the flats.  Think of a cross-country skier.  Lay thing about trekking poles.  I learned this from other hikers.  Wrap duct tape around your poles.  That way you don’t need to carry duct tape in your pack.  If you ever need any, just peel it off of your poles.  
Gloves.  A must for me.  I’ve been wearing a pair of reinforced leather fingerless Outdoor Research gloves since day one.  Saved my hands in many a fall and potential falls.  You get maximum dexterity and protection.  
Dress light.  I wear the same pair of 7” running shorts with the Lycra briefs built in I started with.  The Lycra briefs are important because the keep ticks from unknowingly crawling up your legs.  I also wear roadrace t-shirts.  The microfiber micro mesh are the best.  They are light weight, durable, whisk moisture away, and rinse out easily and are dry by morning.  The AT is no fashion statement so pack for function, not form.  I carry two shirtsleeve T’s, my go to shorts, a pair of lightweight conversion pants (do the legs zipper off), a light windbreaker and 4 pairs of socks.  That’s it for clothes.  My socks are tow pair of Twin Skins by Hilly.  Great for wet weather.  And two pair of CEP light merino wool socks.  Great for dry days.  To each his own though, just don’t scrimp on price of good socks or you’ll pay for it during a hike.  
My shoes are same as day one.  Brand and model, that is.  I go with Salomon X-ultra GLTs.  Because I suffer from Morton’s neuroma, a nerve condition in both feet, I prefer a wider fit.  Salomons do that.  Also, buy a whole size up, your feet will swell.  I prefer the mid-ankle Salomons because they give my ankle stability and if something, like a snake, were to strike at me, hopefully it hits the padded upper instead of my ankle (not likely at all, a snake strike, but why not plan ahead?). When I say I’ve worn the same shoes, I mean brand and style.  I retired my first and second pair after the 2018 (470+ miles) and 2019 (550 miles) hikes.  I still wear them around home.  I’m on my 2020 pair, well broken in during the pandemic and holding up great.
Speaking of feet, ditch the insoles and get a pair of Superfeet insoles.  Well worth the money and hikers swear by them.  I cannot complain.  I tried a pair of generic gel insoles 1st year.  They literally came apart into a gooey mesh within 50 miles of the AT.  Never again!
Let’s see, keep your phone charged however you can.  That’s your lifeline to the real world.  You will be in the wilderness on the AT.  Sometimes I’ve gone 15 miles or so, hours, without seeing anyone.  You won’t always have service, but it is a true lifeline.  I usually carry 2 power banks, right now 3, because one is not holding the charge as much.  They weigh somewhat but it is a welcome weight.  I’d ditch food before my power banks.  Also, when you get to the end of the day’s hike, if you’re like me you want to be able to call for a ride to the hotel.  
Speaking of hotel, take advantage of them as often as you can.  The AT is a hike, not a camping trip.  You can do that in the back yard.  I splurge for the luxury but even the low-end motels beat a tent when your body is sore and you need real food.  Best tip:  Epsom salts.  Soaking my foot in a plastic trash can of it right now in my room.  Your body will feel so much better after a hotel stay then a tent stay.Last tip for now, spray all of your stuff with Permithrin before you head out.  I spray mine front/back, inside/outside.  It lasts through several washings.  This stuff kills and repels insects.  People assume the number one threat on the AT is other people or bears.  It is not.  It is deer ticks.  Bad juju.  I’ve had one tick on me in almost 1200 miles and it had just gotten on my right forearm seconds earlier.  I flicked it off.  Flies and mosquitos don’t trouble me.  Permithrin effects insects’ nervous systems and pretty much kills them right away.  I do not use Deet or any other insect repellant.  I want my skin to breathe and it feel nasty.  Permithrin.  Buy stock in that stuff.","

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637313,"taxi picked me up at 6:30am and I was on the trail at 6:43.  Brisk morning.  I almost threw on the windbreaker but after a 3/4 mile flat (actually a short detour because of flooding damage) I had a brief uphill, so I warmed up OK.  
I was feeling great and pretty much had the trail to myself.  I saw maybe 8 people the whole time.  Nothing much to speak of on today’s hike.  It was one of the easiest sections I’ve done on the AT.  
My Morton’s neuroma raised its ugly head in both my feet.  It is a burning sensation and/or feels like stepping on a small pebble in your shoe with each step.  I’ve had it so long that it is more of a nuisance.  It flares up from time to time and I generally feel it in my right foot more so that left but today it was right foot from the start and left from 9-mile mark on.  I also developed a slight blister on my middle toe on my right foot, between it and my fourth toe. Minor right now.  Got first aid kit though.
So I went through some cool Laurel tunnels today.  I tried to upload a photo but it was too large.  They weren’t flowering yet.
Saw my first bear, but it was on the news this morning.  That just tells me they are emerging from hibernation.  
Also passed 2018 and 2021 halfway points (see photos).  I saw another Towhee with the cool haircut but couldn’t get a photo of it.  According to Merlin Bird ID, they are rare, so that’s cool to see one.  Two counting the one the other day.  I also saw a Scarlet Tanager, another rare bird! I did get several photos of it and posted one.  Very vivid red with black wings.  
Got to Pine Grove General Store and after talking with a few hikers, sat down to attempt my ice cream challenge.  Half gallon of ice cream in one sitting to commemorate the halfway point of the AT.  They were running low and I really wanted chocolate but I settled on a liter of Mint Chocolate Chip and to get to the true half-gallon, you have to add a separate pint.  I got my chocolate there. Both were frozen solid so it took me a while to eat.  Even broke my plastic spoon and had to get a new one.  Still, finished it in 30-minutes.  The hiker I was sitting with finished his in 15, but he had them microwave his to soften it up.  So, I got my wooden spoon award.  See photos.  I got cold after that but I didn’t feel full at all.  All I had eaten this far was a bagel this morning.  I was holding out for the ice cream.  Ate 1/3 of a huge Sicilian pizza with the works 4 hours later.  
I got to the General store at 2:05 by the way, so in all, 19.5 miles in 7 hours 21 minutes.  I’ll try to start adding photos of the elevation guides I use.  They list the  landmarks along the way besides showing the mileage and elevation change.I’m at Allenberry Lodge in Boiling Springs, PA tonight and tomorrow so I get to slack pack 19 miles into Boiling Springs tomorrow and the trail crosses about 1/4 mile from the lodge.  Nice!  That’s it for now.","Caledonia State Park

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637389,"my shuttle driver was showing up at 5:45 so I had to get up at 5:00.  At 6:15 I began hiking today’s leg from the Pine Grove General Store where 16 hours earlier I’d downed a half-gallon of ice cream.
The first two miles of the hike were flat and fast as they were on paved or gravel paths through the state park.  I actually got cold because I was in shorts and short sleeve shirt but I didn’t want to stop and don the windbreaker as I knew I’d be hitting trail and going up soon enough.  I’d warm up.
By the way, the reason I hike so early in the morning is for several reasons.  I like to hike alone with no one around and by starting early I get 5-9 miles in before most people are rolling out of their tents or coming out on the trail from town.  I also like to get to my destination early, that way my day is done and I’ve still got several hours of daylight to relax and enjoy the rest of the day.  
Today’s hike was a little tougher than yesterday but overall, pretty easy and comfortable.  I can tell I’ve gotten my trail legs back, feet too, and I can cruise up and down the hills pretty easily and my feet don’t feel as beat up either.
There was really nothing to speak of.  I heard a lot of birds and was looking out for unique ones but that’s hard to do when you gotta watch where you’re walking.  I did hear an owl, yesterday too, but couldn’t find it. The woodpeckers I hear all the time but can never seem to spot them, until today.  I actually saw two different types, one right after the other.  The first was a smallish red-headed woodpecker and they’re uncommon but not rare.  The other was pretty cool.  It was a pileated woodpecker.  They’re uncommon as well.  It flew overhead just as I was crossing a gravel road and lit on a big tree on the other side.  It positioned itself on the opposite side of the tree from me.  It was as big as a crow, so 18” or so long, but skinny.  They have a wild looking hairdo, like a red Mohawk.  I tried to get photos but it worked it’s way around the tree as I approached the side it was on, then it flew off south down the trail and I wasn’t about to backtrack myself and chase it.  Still, pretty neat to see.  I spent about 10 minutes taking to two hikers who were taking a break on the trail.  They had gotten on on Monday a week ago at Harper’s Ferry and were flip-flopping, doing the northern section to Maine first then returning to Harper’s Ferry and doing the southern section to Georgia afterwards.  They told me about a guy hiking who had no tent or sleeping bag.  He would stay at the shelters and sleep underneath them.  Bad news.  That’s where the ticks, mice and snakes hang out.  The dude is an accident waiting to happen.I got to a bridge and a guy was resting there.  He was hiking south and when I told him I was going north, he warned me that I had a mile-long Boulder field coming up in 1/4 mile.  I was past my halfway point (of a 19-miler) so I wasn’t too concerned.  Nothing to do anyhow but get through it.  Besides being a boulder field, the terrain was up/down and rocky leading to it and out of it.  Besides that, it wasn’t one boulder field but probably 8 stretching for a mile with short spurts of rocky path interconnecting them.  I actually did better than I expected and was able to breeze through it all pretty quick.  Legs and feet feel fine.  In some cases, the white blazes marking the trail are painted on 20’ high boulders, meaning you gotta find a way over.  In other cases through, some openings being maybe 18”.  It was a nice rock climbing workout.I got into the last two miles and came out of the woods into a farm field.  The path took me along the perimeter and then right down the middle where a farmer was out plowing with a tractor.  That took me over a knoll to a similar stretch of farm field then eventually a road and across to yet another field.  I was no longer under the protection of the green tunnel, the woods, so I finally was feeling the direct heat of the day.  85+.   I was glad this was the end.  The trail then took me through a short stretch of woods again then out onto a city street, back into the woods then finally a gravel path around a lake where a lot of people were fishing.  This was the park in the middle of Boiling Springs.  The trail took me to the main road right in front of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC), which was closed.  I got in at 2:15, eight hours after starting.  Two fluid stops today, one between 7-8 miles and the other around 15, both about two minutes.  So far this trip, 6 days, five hiking, one rest day and 97 miles.  I’m now at mile marker 1124 of 2190 for the entire trail.","Pine Grove Furnace

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637471,"I didn’t need a shuttle this morning as my hotel was 1/2 mile walk from the AT where I left off yesterday.  I was on my way just before 7:00am.  The weather was great, probably mid-50’s.  
This portion of the trail and several miles prior to it make up the Cumberland Valley   section of the AT.  It’s very flat and much of it traverses fields and meadowlands.  What doesn’t is either short stints on city streets or nicely maintained dirt trails.  So, the hike was really pretty effortless.  The first 12 miles that is.  
It was also a really peaceful hike in that I had the entire trail to myself except for two runners who I passed two miles into the hike heading into Boiling Springs; a lady walking her dog at 9 miles; a guy on a day hike around 12 miles and a girl running at 14 miles.  So 5 people over nearly 17 miles.  
I saw more critters than usual too.  I got into a staring contest with a lone deer as I took its picture, then I saw my first turtle of this hike crossing the trail, or slowly trying to.  I heard a lot of different bird species as well but I’m not good enough t be able to identify them by sound yet, except for the obvious, like an owl, which I did hear.  
Some of the newer birds I caught sight of but couldn’t photograph were a yellow bird, (it wasn’t Big Bird) but I couldn’t tell what type.  It was too fast and flew into the trees.  Another was a grey catbird, I’m pretty sure.  They are grey and have a black streak down the back of their heads.  Saw a lot of them but they fly off as you get close, like within 30 feet, so not close enough for a photo.  I got startled by several grackles while walking through a field.  They were down in the grass and came flying up as I passed by.  Catches you off guard when it’s all peaceful and all of a sudden, whoosh! whoosh!The oddest part of the hike was on one of the dirt paths in the woods and I heard what sounded like someone knocking on a tabletop, like two times, then pause, and knock again.  It sounded like it was right beside me.  It took me about three seconds to realize what it was.  A woodpecker!  I looked up and spotted it about 20 feet right above me on a tree limb.  It was black and white, so no red head.  I scrambled for my phone camera and rattled off a few shots.! It would peck a spot a couple of times then move and do it again.  It did that for about 20 seconds then gave up and flew off.  So my third woodpecker sighting in two days and first photo in over 1000 miles.  You hear them all the time but they are hard to spot and/or elusive.  So around mile 9 or 10 I saw the mountain I was about to climb from a distance, Cove Mountain.  My elevation/mileage chart told me I’d be going slightly up at mile 12 for about a mile then build into a 750 foot rise over the next mile.  The sight rise was easy, the mile up a little less so.  It was a workout, that’s for sure.  I took photos from the top at mile 14 back down to where I’d just come from so I have photos from both perspectives.  I then called my shuttle driver and said I’d be at the AT/PA-850 intersection in an hour.  I thought I’ve got 3 miles t go but most of it is down the other side of the mountain.  I misjudged the terrain though.  I couldn’t go as fast as I wanted because it became a rocky path most of the way down.  But, I also misjudged the distance.  It was only 2.5 miles not 3.  I got to the road with 12 minutes to spare and several tenths of a mile to spare too.  Driver wasn’t there yet.  I always beat my drivers.  Something wasn’t right though.  Fortunately, I had the thought to pull up Google Maps and realized I was still about 4/10 of a mile from PA-850 and the road I was on was not on my chart.  I had just lost 4 minutes!  I scrambled across waist-high grass following a 6-inch path and still made it to PA-850 at 1:29, one minute to spare from the time I told the driver. Better yet, driver not there.  I won again.  The driver had made a wrong turn and showed up at 1:45.  In the meantime, I rested under an awning at the AT parking area and finished off my fluids.  All good.  Had the rest of the day to clean up then went to Buffalo Wild Wings for a few beers and to update my hike plan.  I then went to Longhorn Steakhouse for dinner and was back in my room relaxing by 7:00.Tomorrow’s hike, a half day slack pack 11 miler.  Should be back by 11:00am.Hiker tip:  turn your phone to airplane mode while hiking.  It’ll save the battery life, you won’t get texts and calls, but the Runkeeper app will still work and update using the phone’s GPS.","Boiling Springs, PA

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637504,"Today is actually a “zero” or rest day but I had an opportunity to get in a relatively easy 11 miler so I thought I’d do that and be done by 11:00am and still have all day to do laundry and laze about.
I wanted to try something different for a slack pack day so instead of carrying NG my 4-pound pack with essentials in it, normally another 8-pounds of fluids and stuff, I fashioned a fanny pack out of the pack’s separable nylon satchel that I normally through all my odds and ends in.  My “town” shorts have a built-in belt so I was able to run the satchel straps around the belt and I was all set.  I only took a 16-oz. water bottle, my wallet, my battery pack and that was about it.  For an 11-miler I was willing to travel really light.  It amounted to about 2-pounds.b get great to be so light.  I also had my usual gear, hiking gloves, phone sleeve, map sleeve and trekking poles, but at least I wasn’t toting them.  World of difference between 32 pounds and 2.
I woke up at 5:30am and an Uber picked me up at 6:00.  On the way to the PA-850 drop-off, the Uber navigation took us down a gravel then dirt road.  Not good.  So we were lost for about 20 minutes before we navigated by my Google Maps and finally made it to the drop off.  The guy apologized over and over and I was like, no big deal.  I’m hiking stress-free, when we get there we get there.  
I still started off at 6:42 this morning so getting lost didn’t delay me too much.  I wanted to get done around 11:00 and I was still on for that for 11 miles.
Right away the trail leads back up another portion of Cove Mountain.  Felt good to be light! The first leg up the mountain, about a 300-foot rise over 6/10 of a mile was pretty easy, aside from the rocks.  The second rise, after a 6/10 mile slight down, was a really sharp rise going up about 400-feet in just 3/10 of a mile, all of it rock.  Then came a slight upslope for 8/10 of a mile to the top.  It looks way more benign then it really is on the charts.  After that though the trail winds along the mountain for 4.7 miles where it’s either flat or slightly down.  At that point I was at mile 7 and knowing I was going to the Southside of Duncannon I had  2-miles of “city walking” at the end just getting through the town.  So, I only had 2-miles of trail left.  From Hawk Rock atop the Southside of Cove Mountain the trail plummets.  The only good thing is that the ATC has taken the effort to create steps out of rocks, none of it uniform or contiguous, of course, but it does help.  Still, the descent was as strenuous as the ascent.  I passed three day-hikers on the way down, the only people I’d seen all day.  For a day off I was glad to get into Duncannon.
As for critters, I heard an owl again this morning and once the double-tap of yesterday’s woodpecker.  I spotted this one but couldn’t get a photo off.  No other birds to speak of.  No other wildlife really at all until the downside of the mountain when I saw a garter snake, about 18”, but it slithered under a log and I couldn’t get a photo.  50 yards later I heard a rustling in the leaves on my right and there’s another one, about 2-feet long.  This one froze in place so I was able to get photos.  I posted one.  So great news that the snakes are out!  Maybe I’ll get some photos of timber rattlers or copperheads.  Black snakes are also all over so I figure I’ll see one or more of them.  Usually the sighted snakes are just crossing the trail from point A to B and want nothing to do with humans.  So, despite rumor, and movies, they aren’t coiled up beside the trail waiting to strike the ankles of unsuspecting hikers.  If I recall, only something like a dozen AT through-hikers have ever been bitten by a snake in 80 years over the entire 2200 miles.  They probably got bit for messing with the snake for a photo op.  I had a shuttle driver in Tennessee who was a herpetologist.  He told me that snakes, including the much-maligned timber rattlers, get a bad rap and that they are actually quite passive and will usually only strike when cornered and provoked.  He mentioned a meadow I’d already hiked through and informed me that the hillside is a breeding ground for timber rattlers.  Did you see any?  He asked.  No, I did not.  I stayed on the trail and they want nothing to do with the trail.
Anyhow, enough about snakes.
In Duncannon, the trail goes right through town.  In the outdoor store I stopped in to look for hiking pins to adorn my pack and ran into the hiker I sat with for my ice cream challenge.  He and a friend were just stopping in for essentials then doing another 10 miles.  Despite not seeing people for miles on the AT, in towns you see people you’ve seen before all the time.  Everyone hikes at their own pace.  Some take breaks for hours, others for days and even weeks.  
So I left them and continued on through Duncannon.  The trail passes right by the local VFW and shortly after, the American Legion.  I’m a life member of both.  I did not, however, pack my membership cards.  These guys are old school, which I can appreciate.  So, despite wearing my submarine ballcap, I could not get served a beer at the VFW.  Lesson to me:  carry your VFW and American Legion membership cards!!!
I next came to the famous Doyle hotel, a hiker haven.  Outside they advertised “ice cold beer.”  The doors were still locked.  Crap!  Hike (at that point) 9-1/2 miles and can’t get a beer.  So why if it’s only 10:00 on a Thursday.  So I continued on through the streets of Duncannon following white blazes spray painted on telephone poles, walls, bridges, and trees.  I finally came to the Clark’s Ferry Bridge that spans the Susquehanna River heading out of town.  On the other side as my stopping point.  When I got across and stopped my Runkeeper app, it was 11:05am.  Missed my goal by five minutes.  I’ll take that on a Thursday that feels every bit like a Saturday.","PA-850

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637645,"Sorry for not updating this yesterday.  I try to do it each day but sometimes I fall behind.  
I started off Friday from the Southside of Duncannon on the Southside of the Clark’s Ferry Bridge which spans the Susquehanna.  
I was dropped off by my Uber driver and started up the mountain at 6:53am.  The first 2 miles were pretty much uphill, about 1000-foot rise over that span.  It wasn’t very difficult and doing it first thing in the morning made it even better.  As I climbed, I could hear the I-81 traffic and the trains recede below me into the distance.  After 2-miles, the trail still went up but at a less steeper incline.  I also encountered boulders along the ridgeline for about a mile.  It was slow going but not very difficult.  So after 4 miles I was off my 25:00/mile pace by 18-minutes overall.  I figured I’d make it up on the ridgeline though.  
The next 12-1/2 miles basically follows the ridgeline and it times will drop down several dozen feet to one side or the other for a little while and then back up and to the top or the opposite side.  It was nice to break up the monotonous path and get different muscles working the ups and downs.  
Being Friday, there were a lot of people on the trail, maybe a dozen or more.  I ran into one group of women, three of them, who have been hiking the trails for decades.  They call themselves AWOL, Aging Women On the Loose.  Interesting.  These women were only 3 of their total 12.  Having hiked all over PA, they were a wealth of knowledge and let me know what “fun” I have coming up in the days ahead and next time I get out on the trail.  
This section apparently is known for the snakes but I didn’t see any.  I was constantly looking too.  
So I had pre-called my shuttled driver and said I’d be at the pick-up spot at 3:00.  I was hiking really well though so three miles out I texted and changed that to 2:00.  I cruised through the last mile descent of 800-feet and hit the Clark’s Valley AT parking area at 1:52.  Early, just like I like it, and beat the driver too.  Cody got there about 10 minutes later and dropped me at my new hotel, the Holiday Inn near Hershey.  
So all in all a 16.49 mile day in 6 hours, 59 minutes, averaging 25:24/mile, just off my goal.  So far, in 9 days I’ve logged 141.56 miles and that includes last Sunday’s zero rest day. I’m pretty happy with that.  
Hiker Tip:  some hikers carry bear spray, me included.  I’ve never had to use it.  Better to have it and not need it than the other way around.  I carry mine on my right pack strap so I almost forget it is there.  Besides bears, the spray would be effective against anything with a heartbeat.  The tip is this though.  Some people have been known to spray their tent as a deterrent to bears.  This is not effective and actually does the opposite. The spray contains capsaicin and once it dries, bears smell it and are attracted to it.  Keep in mind that a bear has a sense of smell 7x that of a bloodhound.  They can smell a Snickers bar, in the wrapper, from a mile away.  If you want to spray your tent and/or pack with a deterrent or something to mask the sweat and funk, use ammonia mixed with water.  No being with a nose likes the smell of ammonia.Saturday’s, or today’s hike was 17.5 miles and I slack-packed it.  I’ll update that later today. Sunday is my second and last zero day.  I need the rest and recovery.","Duncannon Southside
",Rte 325,"May 21, Fri",16.49
TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637656,"I scheduled my pick-up this morning for 6:30 and ended up getting to the start point and going at 7:19.  That’s a lot later than I prefer.  I just didn’t pay enough attention to the time/distance to get there.  
So at 7:19 I started in the middle of nowhere, where the AT crosses PA-325 at Clark’s Valley.  A lot of things around here named after Clark, whoever he, or she, was.  Haven’t looked it up.  I will on rest day tomorrow.  
Today’s hike chart didn’t look too difficult but you never know.  Sometimes the roughest terrain looks all flat on an elevation chart.  What I did have going for me today is I was slack packing.  Since I was coming back to the same hotel, all my gear was there and all I had was the little makeshift satchel I used last slack pack day.  I screwed up though and forgot to charge my new power bank.  I had to use the old one that doesn’t hold a charge as long.  It is heavier too.  I only packed (1) 16-ounce electrolyte replacement too.  I made up two of them but for a 17 mile day I felt I’d be ok with the one.  The weight felt better too, of course.  So besides that, all I had was my flimsy wallet and then my usual gloves, towel and arm sleeves for my phone and elevation guide.  Really light, maybe 6 pounds.  
So right away the trail goes back up out of the gap.  It’s pretty much a 1000 foot climb over nearly 2-miles.  It was really easy though and mainly dirt trail, few rocks.  Once at the top, it’s a hiker’s racecourse, 9-miles of mostly flat dirt trail with a slight descent the last 4 miles of that.  
This area is apparently known for its rattlesnakes, according to other hiker’s blogs, so I had my eyes out hoping to see one and get one video or photos.  Much of the trail and surrounding area seemed ideal for them, grassy and woodsy, but I never saw one.  I would hear the side of the trail brush rustle several times and stop and shake the area with my trekking pole but no luck.  Right around the 6-mile mark I did get an unexpected critter surprise though. I came across a porcupine eating about a foot off the trail 10 feet in front of me.  I was hiking pretty quietly, so I hadn’t startled it, and I had a tree to put myself behind as I got my phone camera ready.  A porcupine?  I didn’t realize they were around here.  So I rattled off several photos but it sensed me as I began to go far right around it.  It made for the tree it was next to and went up sort of slow.  I got up to the tree and took more photos but they weren’t as good as the ones I already had.  I did notice the quills raise up, mainly on the rear of it’s back near the tail.  I wanted no part of that so I wasn’t about to piss this thing off.  From what I understand, a porcupine quill is 1-4” long and has barbs all along it’s shaft.  Once it gets stuck in you, your own muscle fibers tend to contract and pull it in deeper. That must suck.  It can kill an animal as the quill goes deeper.  It’s therefore best to pull the quill(s) out as soon as possible, despite the excruciating pain the barbs will cause and the pieces of flesh it will bring with it.  Anyhow, I wasn’t about to startle the porcupine.  
So I hiked on up the trail and thought, I should have gotten video.  Well, 1/2 mile later there’s another one, much like the first.  On the left side of the trail eating. I did get video this time but the porcupine is in and out of the shot because I had to pay attention to it as I got closer and it headed for and up the tree.  It only went up about 12 feet though and stopped so I got some good photos of that and the video is ok.  That made my critter day.  I’m not sure if the video will post but I’ll try.  
So again on down the trail.  There were more hikers out today, I passed maybe twenty in all going south, so I knew my chances of seeing a snake or bear were slim.  People are generally noisy and that scares off most critters. I try to be as quiet as I can and since I hike alone, that’s pretty easy to do.  At around the 13 mile mark who do I come across but the guy I ate my ice cream challenge with last Thursday and his Buddy.  They were resting on a log atop the southern portion of the mountain.  So I talked to them about a minute and cruised on.  He was hoping to get a rattler to and capture some video.  
So I was going pretty fast for me, under 23:00/mile and felt no reason to let up.  At this pace I’d be done by 2:00.  So after passing through Rauschenberg Gap at mile 11, I had a slight uphill, then a flat 1-1/2 mile section and down into Swatara Gap. Rausch is pretty interesting.  The trail turns to coal.  Right before I realized that Insaw a small mound maybe 20 feet high and 50 feet across and thought, that looks like coal.  It had vegetation growing out of it including trees so it had been there a while.  I still wasn’t sure if it was coal or just really black soil.  Then the trail itself transitioned from dirt to coal and I knew that it was indeed a coal pile.  No duh, Pennsylvania.  So it turns out this area was a mining community over 100 years ago, 1000 people.  So I got a little nugget souvenir and kept on truckin’.  Soon after I came to a bridge and on the other side was an option.  Take the regular trail which goes by a beaver dam and across a stream/creek where the sign said you will have to wade across, or, take the 1.6 mile dry option.  Still white blaze trail, just a dry option.  So I thought I don’t know what I’m getting into going the wet way and I have 5 miles to go so I reluctantly went the dry route. But, 100 yards into it, a guy came by on a bike with his dog so I asked him about it. He said yes, the beaver dam route is a couple hundred feet of maybe thigh-high water.  Funny how the mind’s eye works. I thought of a pristine picturesque flowing stream and I thought, I can take my shoes off and just walk across.  Probably make my feet feel pretty good.  So, I turned around and went the beaver way.
I get there after about 3/4 mile no it doesn’t look good.  First of all, there was no Disney TV beaver dam.  This thing was a log jam, heck, a tree jam.  Also, the water wasn’t flowing.  What water there was looked like a stagnant wasteland.  I thought, oh crap, no soothing barefoot stroll across this morass.  What saved me was I had thought before I got there that it hasn’t rained in days, maybe it will be really shallow.  Well, it was.  Better than that, hikers had laid out branches and limbs to walk across on.  I lucked out!!  Industrious hikers, gotta love ‘em.  I took a photo of it from the other side looking back.  I’m pleased that I took the adventurous route.  
So at Swatara the trail cuts through the state park.  As I got closer to the end of today you could hear the PA-72 and I-81 traffic, a welcome cacophony of vehicular noise.  I got to my stopping point, I had cell coverage, I call Uber, no drivers available.  Crap!  So 2.4 miles away is Lickdale, and a Wendy’s.  So I thought I have to walk another 2.4 miles out of my way and maybe get a ride from there.  So I start walking.  I kept checking periodically to see if Uber would be available but no luck, despite me walking by houses along PA-72.  About a mile into my walk a see a man and his wife drilling post holes on their property out near the street so I cross over and ask them what the taxi/ride situation is like around here.  After some small talk and them providing some possible options, (I even said I’d pay someone $50 to drive me 13 miles to Grantville and my hotel.  Hint hint) the wife notices my USS Lapon ballcap.  Oh, we’re you on submarines?  Yes I was!  Turns out she works on nuclear reactors.  Go figure.  Thank God for my Lapon ballcap.  So I tell them I’m heading to Wendy’s to get something to eat and a Frosty and they say they had to return the drill auger and that if I hadn’t found  a ride when they get back that they would drive me to Grantville.  Awesome! So I keep walking.  About 6/10 of a mile from Wendy’s I see a state police station. I was really patched now, having finished off my fluids back at the gap.  Should have packed the other bottle.  So I go in and ask the duty trooper what my ride options are.  He said he’d look it up for me.  In the meantime, water fountain.  I filled up my collapsible bottle three times and drank it and one for the road.  So he gives me a taxi service number over in Lebanon.  Before I go he tells me he has hiked portions of the trail and wishes me good luck along the way. I don’t know if he has recognized my Lapon ballcap or not but I use the opportunity to mention that one of my ship mates, Brian Fleck, is a PA State Trooper.  He doesn’t know him, there being 5000 of them.  He asks if I have a trail name.  Yeah, look at my ballcap, it’s Lapon spelled backwards, NopaL.  Kinda like looking in your rear view mirror and reading “ambulance” spelled backwards, like the lights and siren don’t clue you in.  I feel the same way hiking.  NopaL coming through, get out of the way!  Also, I hike alone, so I got no pals. Anyhow, he tells me if you don’t have any luck getting a ride, call back here and we’ll figure something out.  I said I can always walk up on I-81 and you can “arrest” me and take me to my hotel.  He says, no, don’t do that!!  So I head on up the road.  I’m almost at Wendy’s and here comes that couple so they stop and say they’ve got to return this auger but they’ll be back around in 20 minutes and if I don’t have a ride they’ll take me.  Sweet!!  So Ingo in Wendy’s order, start eating and think, I oughta try Uber again.  Boom, ride in 7 minutes.  I’m back at the hotel around 4:00, so a two-hour ordeal.  I called the state police and got an answering machine!  So I left my trooper friend a message saying I’d gotten the ride and I knew the couple would know I got a ride because I had told them if I’m not standing by the road, then I got a ride.  
I was pretty sore after all that, my feet again.  I drank a lot more water too and my other bottle of electrolyte.  I’m fine now a d listening to a country western band at the Holiday Inn restaurant/bar The Winner’s Circle.  This place is packed.  All these locals western dancing.  I can’t western dance and I’m wearing my hiking boots and my feet hurt anyhow.  I’m just gonna sit here and drink my medicine, draft beer, and watch people dance and sports on tv.  Zero day/laundry day tomorrow!  So 10 days and 159.67 miles down and three hiking days to go this time out.  A 20+ miler on Monday, a 15 miler on Tuesday and a 14.5 miler on Wednesday.  After that, on Thursday I go to Lehigh Valley Intn’l airport, pick up a rental car, drive to Dulles International and pick up my SUV, drive to UVA and meet with advisor, professors, visit the library on Friday then back home a week from now on Saturday.","Rte 325

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637798,"After yesterday’s rest day I was feeling really good today.  My one concern was that I needed to get to my endpoint, Fort Dietrich/PA-183, by 3:00 because an employee of Quality Inn, where I’d be staying,was going to pick me up and bring me to the hotel so I wouldn’t have to walk the 4.4 miles after hiking 20.  To put more pressure on, my Uber, which was supposed to pick me up at 6:00, picked me up at 6:20.  That set me back a mile hiking time.  So I got to the drop-off point near Swatara State Park around 6:35.  What delayed me even more is that I had to walk about 1/2 mile from the drop-off point to where I’d left off on the trail because there’s no vehicular access. It was a steep uphill as well.  Despite all that, I got started at 6:48am.  The first 2.5 miles went up about 950 feet.  1/2 mile in, I passed a group of camper/hikers and someone called my name.  It turns out it was another hiker who has been reading my journal.  So that was pretty cool.  I quickly explained that I didn’t have time t stop because I had to catch a ride.  The day was overcast and rain seemed to threaten throughout.  A blessing and a curse because the low temps made it ideal for hiking but rain would put a damper on things and make the rocky trail slippery as well.  It rained very lightly once and that was only for about 10 minutes so I made out there.  The trail was very rocky, in some cases extended Boulder stretches that led to rocky paths and then more Boulder fields.  I navigated through them really well (for me) averaging a little under 21:00/mile through the first 12 miles all with a full pack.  Around mile 14 I zipped through a campsite and the trail took me down and along a stream.  About 1/4 mile in I realized I was seeing blue blazes (a side trail) not white ones.  Somewhere I’d gotten off the trail.  I had to backtrack 1/4 mile, now uphill, and I finally got on the white blaze trail again, another uphill.  I had failed to notice a hard left turn.  So a 12-minute 1/2 mile error.Despite that, I ended up at Fort Dietrich at 2:24 and called my ride, Vivian.  She was able to come get me right away.  A few minutes later I was at PA-183.  We got a little disjointed because I was waiting at the road and she was 3/10 of the mile down the road at the AT parking area, so I had to walk down to meet her.  Beats walking 4.4 miles though. So all in all a good day, and fast.  I did 20.5 miles in just under 7-1/2 hours averaging just under 22:00/mile overall.  That’s the second fastest I’ve hiked any stretch of 14-26 miles since I started the AT in Georgia.  Maybe I’m motivated to be finishing this hiking session.Tomorrow I’ve got a 15-miler and Wednesday a 14-miler and then home, with a detour to UVA in Charlottesville.  That’ll give me 210 miles in 14 days.  12 hiking days.  Hiking Tip:  buy shoes at least a size larger.  Your feet will swell while hiking and you’ll need the room.  If you buy your regular size, your toes will jam into the toe box and you’ll more than likely bruise them and lose several toenails as well.  I also opt to wear a wider shoe for the same reason but also because I have Morton’s neuroma in both feet, a dilated nerve condition, so the wider shoe keeps the nerve from being pinched by my toe bones and causing pain.  Doesn’t work 100% of the time but better than a regular fit shoe.","Swatara Gap

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637846,"Vivian from Quality Inn was kind enough to come in early and drive me back up to the drop off point 4.4 miles away.  She didn’t make me walk the 3/10 to the AT parking area, instead dropping me where the AT crosses PA-183.  
I got started at 6:42am and I had pretty much 8-miles of relatively flat trail.  The make-up of the trail was something else. A lot of rocks, some Boulder patches and a good deal of dry leafy trail that felt good and allowed me to move pretty quickly.  I didn’t intend to go as quick as I was but there was nothing really to stop for.  The weather was great, mid 60’s to low 70’s and being in the green tunnel lowered that.  My Runkeeper app had it had 51.  I don’t think it got that low though.  
At roughly 8.5 miles I hit an up that surprised me.  It was on the chart, at mile 1214.1, but I guess I overlooked it.  It was a 200-foot ascent over about 1/10 of a mile.  Doesn’t sound like much until you do it.  It will definitely get your heart rate up and get you sweating.  From what I calculated, that’s a 38-degree pitch.  It felt sort of good to be going up though after so long on the flats.  Soon enough it was over and I had nearly 2-miles of flat before the trail slanted down in its approach to Port Clinton. The worse part, or most treacherous part of the hike was the very end.  The trail plummets into the rail yard at Port Clinton.  It drops 1000’ in a mile.  500-feet of that in the last 3/10 of a mile.  I kept my poles out in front of me, holding them by the knobs on the end just to feel somewhat stable.  I could feel it in my knees so I had to take it somewhat slow.  I slid several times but never for long and I never lost my balance completely.  If you look at the chart in the pictures you’ll see this area at miles 1219-1220.5. Tomorrow’s start is a 2-stage version of this with a short flat break in between, only this is an ascent.  At this steepness, I’ll take the ascent any day.  So Port Clinton rail yard looks like a throwback 100 years or more.  Both the trains and the buildings.  Pretty neat.  I didn’t want to explore so I kept to the trail which now cut through town.  Soon enough I was parallel to PA-61 just waiting the junction where the AT crosses it.  Actually, it goes under it.  I had to hike up a small embankment to get off the trail at PA-61.  It was way early, only 12:30, and I was done for the day.  15.45 miles in 5 hours 47 minutes.  One short fluid break.  I didn’t bother calling for a ride.  The hotel was only 1.4 miles up the road.  I figured I wasn’t going to be able to check in that early anyhow.  I also looked forward to the flat asphalt walk, to stretch my legs out on solid ground and off the rocks.  I made it in 24 minutes.  I got to the hotel and my room was ready after all.  Sweet! I unpacked and got a shower, took a nap then walked 1.2 miles to a local restaurant/bar.  It’s not even 7:00 yet and I’m back at the hotel after walking back.  Tomorrow, the last day of this session, is a 14-miler to Hawk Mountain Road at mile marker 1235.  It has a few challenges but I’ll be slack packing as I am coming back to the same hotel.  I’ll walk the 1.4 miles back to the trailhead in the morning so my legs can get loosened up prior to the nearly 2-mile ascent to start the hike.  Hiker Tip:  get a really good pair of insoles for your shoes and throw the ones that come with the shoes out.  I use Superfeet insoles, as many AT hikers do.  There’s a carbon fiber reinforcement around the heel that extends 3/4 of the length of the insert.  I found that I could roll off the rocks, even sharp-edged ones, and not really feel the rock jabbing my feet.  I tried to stay off my toes when traversing the rocks and opted for a heel first plant or flat-footed.  My tread on my Salomons is wearing quickly because of the rocks but my Superfeet are holding up just fine.  So are my own feet!!","Fort Dietrich/PA-183

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/637918,"I had decided yesterday that since the trail was only 1.4 miles from the hotel and my first stretch was 2-miles basically up, I’d just walk there.  I had walked to the hotel after all and that was with a full pack.  Today I would be slack-packing with about 4-pounds.  My lightest hike day so far on the AT.  
Since I wasn’t reliant on anyone, I got up at 5:00am since sunrise was 5:42 and I was on my way around 5:40.  At 6:05 I was where I left off yesterday and started today’s hike.  From the gap at mile marker 1220.7, I had the immediate uphill climb, about 500 feet over 8/10 of a mile.  That transitioned into a very short downhill sloping reprieve before another 500 foot rise over about 7/10 of a mile.  The first one is the steepest making the second one seem easy.  This began a “potpourri” day for the first 9 miles of everything PA’s trails offer.  I had the steep ups, the steep downs, the gradual ups and downs and the ever-changing terrain of boulders, rocks, dirt, gravel and everything in between.  The fog on the mountain made the Boulder hopping more challenging as they became slick when wet.  I didn’t fall but I did slide and came close to falling more than once.  
This isn’t necessarily a hard part of the trail, that’s all relative to the individual anyhow, but it will definitely get your heart rate up and is a great cardio workout.  I kept thinking that this portion of the trail would have been great cross country training in high school.
The top of the mountain offers some great views at Pulpit Rock and at The Pinnacle, but when I got to both the fog was still enveloping the mountain so I didn’t even bother stopping.  
There weren’t too many people out today.  I passed four hikers going north like me and probably another 6 south-bounders and day hikers.  Two of the through-hikers I passed I spoke to for a short while because I’d seen them several times over the past week.  They started in Damascus and are going to Maine and then will go back to Damascus and do the last 475-ish miles down to the southern terminus in Georgia.  After 9 miles of ups and downs, the trail unexpectedly, but welcomely, turned into a 10-foot wide dirt road just after The Pinnacle.  For the next 5-miles, I enjoyed this flat-to-down sloping mountain service “road” all the way to Hawk Mountain Road.  That was about a 750-foot descent but felt really easy after the beginning section. I had called my shuttle driver Steve two miles from the end and when I got there, he pulled up 30 seconds later.  I beat my shuttle driver again, but barely.  So today’s hike was 14.38 miles in 5 hours  19 minutes and I was done by 11:30am.  Steve dropped me at the hotel and I immediately did laundry and made arrangements for my ride from the hotel to the Reading, PA Hertz rental car place tomorrow morning.  I then drive to Dulles International near DC to pick up my SUV and then on to UVA in Charlottesville where I’ll meet with my college advisor and get some other things done on campus on Friday.  Saturday I drive back to Virginia Beach, flatland.  I look forward to the long weekend and sitting still enjoying the beach.  So, 2 weeks and 210 miles down.  I’m happy with that.  I may get a chance to get back on the trail between semesters in August for 7-10 days but I’m gonna shelve my AT thoughts for now and enjoy the weekend.","Hamburg, PA

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651050,"My driver Steve, a cantankerous 81-year-old, showed up early, so we were on the road by 7:20 and at the drop-off point where the AT crosses Hawk Mountain Rd by 7:45. I got started at 7:50. It was overcast and slightly drizzly off and on. It had rained throughout the night so everything was wet, and slippery. I met Carbon, at the road as he was crossing heading north. He had started at Harper’s Ferry and is flip-flopping, doing Harper’s (midpoint of trail) to the finish at Kathadin in Maine then going back to Harper’s and going south. Carbon got ahead of me on the trail as I was getting my stuff ready but I caught up and passed him within a mile. For a Saturday, not a lot of people out due to the weather which was fine by me. Still, I passed several northbounders and passed several heading south. Most looked like day hikers though. Critter-wise, I had a couple deer cut across the path about 30 yards ahead of me. Later I saw a  black spotted red newt. I’ve seen several since GA, usually on rainy days. They are toxic and their bright color is supposed to be a warning. I heard several woodpeckers but never saw any. I did see a colorful Bluejay fly across the trail ahead of me. No beats although I was trying to be quiet and keep an eye out.
I hit the steepest uphill around 2-miles and it took its toll. I had to stop about every couple hundred yards and rest for several seconds. Not acclimated to the climbs yet. Carbon caught up and passed me back. Once I got to the top of the hill near Dan’s Pulpit, I was able to hike along pretty well since it was mainly flat, until I hit the rock patches. Most of them were several hundred yards long and mixed size rocks up to about four feet in diameter. It was made tougher because they were wet, so slippery. I hit one patch where the boulders were more like six or eight feet across and went up about 20 feet so I had to go up and over. I caught back up with Carbon, an Army vet, around 4-1/2 miles and we hiked together through 7.6 where he stopped at a shelter. The rest of my hike to PA-309 was fairly flat and the rocks not so bad. Where I was hiking about 34 minutes a mile through the rough spots, by the latter flats I was able to
hike at 21 minutes/mile until the end comfortably. My nerve issue (Morton’s Neuroma) flared up over the last three miles and I sought out sharper rocks sticking up to step on. They forced my toes to spread, twisted my foot, and alleviated the pain. I called Steve with two miles to go and when I got to 309, as I came up to the road, he pulled up 50 yards up the street. Timing. And still on my streak of beating my drivers to the pick-up spots. 
I’m fairly sore but I’ll be better by morning. Steve drove me 15 miles to Mahoning Inn in Lehighton where I have a room for Saturday and Sunday. We got there around 2:15. It started to rain. Nice being done. 
I got cleaned up and walked to the American Legion post a couple of tenths if a mile away. I had a few beers and made arrangements for my shuttle drive back to PA-309 and the trail crossing as well as pick-up at Lehigh Gap at the end of Sunday’s 14-mile hike. 
Today’s hike was 11.75 miles.
After American Legion I walked a couple tenths more to a place called Griff’s Ale Haus & Grill. They were out of a lot of stuff so I ate wings and fries and had another beer. I walked back to hotel around 6:45 in the drizzle. Felt great.
Steve’s picking me up at 7:00 tomorrow so pretty much relaxed now watching TV and gonna crash early.
Tomorrow’s hike has both the Knife Edge (it is what it sounds like along the rocky summit,) and Bake Oven which is a rocky outcropping overlooking for miles the forest and surrounding area.","Hawk Mountain Road/Eckville
",PA-309 at Blue Mountain Summit,"May 14, Sat",11.75
TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651127,"My driver, Steve, was late by an hour forty-five minutes. Really threw me off. I didn’t get started until 9:12 and wanted 7:30. I knew I had to make up some time on whatever easy sections I was going to have because my driver, Tyler, who works at the hotel, was getting off duty at 3:30 and I didn’t want to hold him up much. It was a 30-minute drive to where he’d pick me up.  So, I preferred to be done by 4:00. 

The first two miles were fairly easy. More dirt/grass trail with few football-sized rocks. It was a nice loosening up phase for what was to come.
At two miles I had a slight downhill for about 1/2 mile but I knew that was just the cue for what was just ahead. The Knife Edge. After the dip I had an equally sloped 1/2 mile uphill and the rocks were getting bigger, and more of them. Several times I had to traverse over them. I slipped at one point and fell on my back and right side but I was able to go with it at the last moment. It would have gone better with a full pack because my hammock-tent and other stuff would have padded the fall. Instead, with a nearly empty backpack (because I was slackpacking and going back to the same hotel) I felt the rocks. I felt just a little banged up but nothing serious. 1/2 hour later I realized what little aches from the fall I had had gone away. 


As I got close to the Knife Edge, the rocks quickly became big boulders and the AT white blaze markers took me to a big pile of them I had to climb up and over. I added a photo looking back down. The trekking poles got stowed and I started climbing hand over foot, probably 20-25 feet high on the boulders before they leveled off at the start of the Knife Edge. I took a photo of this as well. Both photos are in the photo section of the journal. This was slow going, particularly since I’d already had the reminder that even dry rocks/boulders can be slippery. So I slowly made my way along the upside down “V” shaped stretch of boulders. I could not see the end. It wasn’t as bad as it might seem. To fall to the left I would have landed on more big boulders. To fall to the right I would have slid down anywhere from 5-30 feet along the face of the flat boulders. I don’t think I’d have gone over the edge. But, I didn’t want to fall so I took my time. The opposite end was similar to climbing up to the Knife’s Edge, now I had to climb down. Down always seems harder. It was probably four times as long too, maybe 200 feet. The Knife Edge itself was probably 75 yards long. It was nice getting it behind me and I actually looked forward to the rock/Boulder path, for several minutes. The rocks and boulders really tear your feet up but the worse is the stress and strain overall on the body. It just saps you. 


So I had another 2-miles before Bake Oven Knob. This was relatively flat but still rocky for 1-1/2 miles then I hit the parking
Area and the trail for the next 1/2 mile or so was fairly easy, first half of that few rocks, but that all changed in the second half. I ended up never seeing the overlook. I think it sits off the AT somewhat and I had my head down watching where I was stepping so I guess I missed the turnoff. No big deal. Seen plenty of overlooks along the AT and Bake Oven has been severely vandalized by spray painters. Even the approach trail. Too sad. 



The next two miles were rolling hills, not too bad, then came the slight 300 foot descent to Ashfield Rd and then the 1/2 mile 400 foot ascent up the other side. I was curious if I could ascend none-stop so I slowed down and made it no problem. After yesterday’s struggle up the one mountain I get was happy about that. It’ll still take me a while to acclimate and get my legs used to climbing before I’ll be able to ascend at steeper and greater distances as I have in the past.
After the ascent the trail turned really flat for about 2-1/2 miles. Still had rocks though. A lot of it was along the mountaintop and I could look down to Lehigh Gap below and the river and highways. Because I was on top of the mountain, I was exposed without tree cover so now the sun’s heat added to the struggle sapping me of what little energy I had left. It gets kind of dangerous because when you get tired, you tend to shuffle your feet and unconsciously drag the trekking poles so both your feet and the poles catch on rocks. It’s OK to be tired, just do all you can to not act like it. 


Mile 12 was the descent into Lehigh Gap. After a slight downslope for 1/2 mile, the angle increased dropping the elevation 500 feet over a mile. Then it really dropped down to the Gap 700 feet in 1/2 mile. Dealing with rocks is more painful going downhill then up. 


I was really exhausted when I got done and probably near dehydration even though I had been drinking an electrolyte mix. I was pretty happy nonetheless that I’d gone 13.65 miles in six hours ten minutes getting to the pick-up spot at 3:25. Tyler wasn’t even off yet. I had called him from high ground 2-miles prior and gave him an update so he knew I’d be there by 3:45 so I beat that by 20 minutes. 


Tyler dropped me at the hotel and I drank 32 ounces of water and got cleaned up. I then walked up the street about 1/4 mile and ate a big Italian dinner and drank a lot more water, and three beers. I craved very light beer though so they were Michelob Ultras. 


Back in room since 7:45, planning tomorrow and making hotel/shuttle arrangements. Tomorrow is my shortest AT day ever. Only 6.2 miles. Just the way it worked out. Only hard elevation spot is the beginning. 1000 foot ascent over 3/4 mile out of Lehigh Gap. Rocks and boulders await. This is why hikers call Pennsylvania “rocksylvania.” I look forward to New Jersey 32 miles ahead. Although I’ll still have rocks for roughly another 36 miles along the ridgeline, they are supposed to be easier than Pennsylvania’s as well as less drastic ascents and descents. The last 36 miles of Jersey is pretty much meadowland. That’ll be nice on the feet and legs.sorry, I tried to load the Knife Edge and lead in to it but the files were too large for some reason. You can see them on line.","PA-309 at Blue Mountain Summit

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651178,"I got up at 6:00 and packed up my things. When I got to the front of the motel at 6:35, Tyler, my driver, was already waiting. He dropped me off at the Cherryville Service Center parking lot he’d picked me up at yesterday, adjacent to the trail. I started hiking today at 6:51. It was going to be a very short day, just over 5-miles. That’s because the next town is Wind Gap 21-miles away. I didn’t want to stress my body that much on the third day so I broke it up. A relatively light day today and a 15-1/2 miler tomorrow. 




The trail, or road, took me across the Lehigh Gap Bridge which spans the Lehigh River and then along PA-248 for about 200 yards where I had to cross the road and double-back about 100 feet to where the trail went up the northeast part of Blue Mountain. This was going to be another stress test but I didn’t realize the extent until I got to hiking up. I’d walked just under 1/2 mile to get to the trailhead so at least my legs were somewhat loosened up and I was feeling fine after yesterday. Now I had a one mile 1000 foot ascent.The trail from the start was steep gravel and small rocks but within a couple hundred feet it was boulders, sloped into the mountainside. The trail to the top was more of the same with some Boulder walls that had to be climbed. Trekking poles were no good. This went on for 9/10 of a mile and 1000’. I was pleased I made it non-stop except for several photos I took. I’ll try to post them. The climb was strenuous but not extremely hard. You just had to take your time, watch your footing, and your balance, particularly with a 32-pound backpack.
At the top, there were more rocky trails but they quickly transitioned into grassy pebble trails that were flat for the most part, some rolling hills. This went on for about 2-miles, really nice hiking after the rock climb. I stopped along the trail to get a drink and an older hiker, in his 60’s probably came by. His trail name is Slasher because he hiked so fast. He is from Seattle and was an accomplished hiker. He had previously hiked the 3000-mile plus Pacific Crest Trail. Said it took 23 years. Anyhow, we hiked together for about 1/2 mile then I slowed since this was an easy day for me. The trail cut up some more rocks under high tension wires and then into its mile descent 300 feet into Little Gap. I actually walked about 200 yards too far when I realized I was about to go uphill again and then turned around back to a road I had crossed. That turned out to be Blue Mountain Road which led into town. There was a restaurant 1.3 miles up the road so I just walked it. When I got there it was closed.


I walked a couple hundred yards and a young guy in a car asked if I wanted a ride. I got in and he was heading to a Giant about 7 miles away and not coming back that way. We were at the town light and there was a Miller Mart on the corner and I was only another mile from the Filbert B&B where I’d be staying so he just dropped me at the Mart. He had been holding a five dollar bill the whole time and now he was waving it at me as I got out. He was trying to give it to me. I explained that I wasn’t destitute, just hiking the AT. He was pretty adamant that I should take it but I kept turning it down explaining I owned a company, I was pretty well off, despite appearances. I thanked him for the 200 yard ride and left him with his five dollars. Nice thought on his part nonetheless.


I went in the Mart and checked things out. I asked the owner, Lynn Miller, about any restaurants around I could hang around in because it was only 11:00 and I couldn’t check in until 4:00. She said I could hang out with them, her and the other lady, Tonya. I told her I wanted to get a little cleaned up if I was going to hang out there so she said there was a hose out back I could use. So I got my hand towel wet and basically took a sponge bath and changed into my town clothes. Felt and smelled a lot better. When I was about to go back in a guy in a pick-up warned me of the upcoming thunderstorm. So bad the school system was closing early and letting kids out. I went back into the Mart and Lynn made me a pork BBQ sandwich. I ate that and talked to Susan a little. When I went back into the Mart, Lynn and Tonya were talking about the storm and concerned that the Mart would flood, which often did in heavy rains. Lynn was going to have to move stuff off the floor, mainly in their back warehouse area. I volunteered to do it for her since I had no where to be anyhow and I was just hanging out. Only took about 1/2 hour. Soon after, Tonya was leaving so she offered to drive me the mile up to Filbert’s. I sat on the porch there catching up on phone stuff and waiting to the owner Kathy when the storm kicked up. It rained and the wind blew for about 20 minutes and then was pretty much over. I cleaned up the front porch where rugs and other stuff got blown around then around 2:45 Kathy showed up with another hiker, Tom.


She showed us around and to our respective rooms. I got cleaned up and watched a little TV then went down and ate a couple hot dogs Tonya had made me and talked with Tom, a 70-year-old hiker from Wyoming. He had already hiked from Vermont to Katahdin with his brother a few years back so now he was finishing the AT.


So now I’m in my room watching some horror movie and finishing this journal entry. I got a text from my driver tomorrow in Wind Gap and I made reservations already at Hampton Inn in Easton, PA. So I can rest easy about tomorrow’s 15.5 miler.


Kathy is fixing Tom and me breakfast (which I rarely eat, but it is a bed & breakfast) and then driving us to the trail by 8:00. Supposed to be temps in the 60’s-70’s and zero chance of rain so should be a really nice hike.","Lehigh Gap

Kathy had coffee and what she called a hiker’s breakfast for us. Scrambled eggs, hash browns, sausage links, French toast, and fresh fruit. I don’t normally eat breakfast but it was good, and filling.


Kathy dropped us at the trailhead and we got started at 8:09. I said goodbye to Tom and hit the trail. I may see him again up the trail since despite being a slower hiker, Tom doesn’t take rest days whereas I do.


To start off, I had to go up out of the Gap. The northern side wasn’t nearly as steep (except for a sharp 1/10 mile ascent) but gradually rose maybe 200 feet over the next 1-1/2 miles. Then it leveled off pretty much for the next 12-1/2 miles. Still, Pennsylvania being what it is, the trail was nearly constantly rocks. Very few boulders to cross, but lots of softball-sized to tire-sized rocks. 



There were no overlooks so the entire hike was in the green tunnel (forest), so it was shaded. There were light-to-heavy breezes that felt great, almost too great. It got chilly at times despite the temps being in the mid-70’s (in the sun.)So with nothing really to see and lots of rocks, I shifted my vision from the rocks to up ahead and occasionally to my right and left if I hit a flat spot on the trail. Looking for critters, mainly bears and snakes. News up here says the bears are up and out and apparently I’m going through (the next few days included) a heavy rattlesnake area. Didn’t see any. The snakes I’ve seen in the past, including the one rattler in 1260 miles, don’t hang out on or near the trail. So the only ones I’ve seen have been crossing the trail. They stop because they sense something coming.


Despite not seeing any bears or snakes, I did see a deer that froze about 25 yards off the right side of the trail but I couldn’t get a good photo because trees were in the way. Later on I had a grey Fox cut across the trail right to left ahead of me maybe 40 yards. I just happened to be looking up ahead and saw it. When I got to the spot, I stopped and looked around on the left but it was gone. Figured it would be. Later into the hike I saw a male Scarlet Tanager. These male birds are really cool looking. Bright red with a black tail and black markings on the wings. I did get a photo but it wasn’t as close as I would have liked so the bird is hard to make out on a branch. Only other unusual critter I saw was a tortoise or turtle, not sure which, about twice the size of a desktop mouse. The turtle shell was pyramiding. It’s a protein thing due to the turtle’s need to forage and the exercise the turtle thus gets. Excess protein causes the shell plates to spike up. I’ll try to post the photo. Saw another deer about 20 yards off but it ran off.


So I called Kate, my driver, when I was 1-1/2 hours from the Wind Gap AT parking lot. I had a 1.2 mile 1000 foot descent but it wasn’t too bad with the switchbacks except for the rocks. 


Overall, despite having rocks, the trail also had a lot of tree detritus and some grass and dirt so it wasn’t just all rocks but added some cushioning at spots.


I fell again, this time hard. I was only 30 yards from the road at Wind Gap. I guess I was going a little fast on the last bit of downhill and my right toe caught a small rock or root and I went sprawling forward. I bent my right wrist backwards and got a minor cut in my right knee. Nothing major, although I can only bend my right little finger about 3/4 of the way and it’s all swollen at above the knuckle at the first joint. Probably sprained it. Good thing I’m left-handed. Note to self: don’t rush and lift your feet up!


I told Kate I’d be at the pick-up spot at 3:20 +/- 5 minutes. I got there at 3:06. Beat me driver again. Kate pulled up a little later and drove me to the Hampton Inn in Easton about 18 miles away. Tomorrow morning she’ll pick me up and take me to where she picked me up today and I’ll hike 17-miles to Delaware Water Gap and into New Jersey. Kate will pick me up there and take me to Hampton Inn in Stroudsburg. What’s nice is Kate lives in East Stroudsburg so she may be able to shuttle me for a couple more days. Her husband hiked the AT over the 2 years of COVID. He’s hiking the 3000+ mile Pacific Crest Trail right now. PCT is longer than the AT, but hikers who have done both say the AT is harder.


I walked to Applebee’s across the street from the hotel after getting cleaned up and ate grilled salmon with broccoli and mashed potatoes. So a healthy dinner. I did have 2 Bud Lights, but only two. 


Resting comfortably now updating this journal and watching Forensic Files on HeadLine News channel.","Little Gap
",Wind Gap,"May 17, Tue",15.02
TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651292,"Up at 6:15, packed up, got coffee , then Kate picked me up at 7:30. Since she was going to be picking me back up, she let me leave my hammock-tent and poncho in her car. Saved me toting five pounds.


Kate dropped me at the Wind Gap trailhead and I prepped for today’s hike: gloves, trekking poles, arm sleeve with today’s route, phone on Runkeeper app and plugged into power bank. My right glove went over my swollen hand fine. I was able to grasp the trekking pole just fine.


At 7:53 I got started with the ascent out of the Gap, 500 feet over 1/2 mile. It wasn’t that difficult at a slow and steady pace. When I got to the top I had 12-1/2 miles of pretty much flat terrain with minimal rises and falls along the way. Most of the trail was rocky, but occasionally I’d get grass/dirt paths and a couple times grave/dirt fire roads. Both were a welcome relief. 


Around mile 7, I had to navigate another knife edge, more like a butter knife edge, it being wider and easier to cross the 100 yard length. About midway, I got startled by something rustling in the vegetation to my left and I immediately knew it was a snake, and it was, but only a non-venomous black racer. The two-foot snake hightailed it over the rock ledge and out of sight. I guess we startled each other. Only fifty feet later I was preparing to cross a break in the boulders and in the 8” deep gap sat a timber rattler. I had passed a lady, Nora, when I got on the knife edge so I called back to her about the snake. As I took several photos she came up and did the same. 


Since going over the snake was not a wise option and there was only about a foot clearance either side of it, the route was not a safe option. So I went up and over a five-foot high Boulder wall on the left and back down onto the AT route on the other side of the snake and took more photos from that side. Nora did likewise as another hiker came up. I warned him and he took photos and then we all made our way along the AT boulder section. I saw another snake, a 2-foot non-venomous Blacksnake, fifty feet from the rattler. We continued down the boulders, cautious of more snakes, and then finally back down to ground level and gradually we separated. The other hiker was Five More Minutes, and he was hiking with his son. His son was somewhere behind. 


No more critters to speak of. It was a beautiful day and lots of birds out, but that was the extent of critters.


The descent into Delaware Water Gap is long at 3-1/2 miles dropping 1200 feet. A lot of it was rock/small Boulder. I was careful not to fall. When I got to the parking lot at Delaware Water Gap, I had about another 1-1/2 miles of city walking which included spanning a bridge across a river next to I-80. I also crossed into New Jersey in the middle of the bridge. I also passed the 900 miles to go to Katahdin five miles back. Two milestones one day. Kate picked me up at the Delaware Water Gap Visitor’s Center and dropped me at the Hampton Inn in Stroudsburg, PA. Tired and sore. 16.6 mile 8 hour day.","Wind Gap

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651351,"Kate picked me up at 7:00 this morning and I was on the trail at 7:21. It had rained during the night and was still drizzling and cold, 50 degrees, so I opted for the poncho more so to keep me somewhat warm but also to keep my pack dry.


Out of Delaware Water Gap going north, the trail immediately starts going up. It’s somewhat deceiving because compared to Pennsylvania, the rocks are still there but fewer during this stretch and the trail is less of drastic inclines as it switches back up the mountain. The ascent is only 1000 feet over those 4-miles and the inclines are broken up by flats. Those series of ups and flats reminded me of Mount Trashmore hill workouts while on the Kempsville High School cross country team and Coach Piccillo. Those workouts were harder than today but 40 years later I still had Coach Piccillo’s voice in my head telling me to suck it up.


Towards the top a string of students came by going south. Turned out to be about 1/2 dozen strings of students, about 80 in all, who must have been on at least an overnight experience. One told me they were from St. Benedicts. I thought about that and realizing where I was, NJ, I mentioned the name Edward Cheserek to several in a following group. Some had not heard of him but most had, as well as their chaperone. They were surprised I knew of him. Cheserek is a 17-time  NCAA champion in long distance running and was the top recruit out of high school. I told the chaperone I just ran a 1/2 marathon in April in Honolulu that Cheserek won. I was right behind him. A long way right behind him.


Anyhow, the trail at the top of the mountain goes around Sunfish Pond, more like a lake. This is the southernmost glacial pond on the AT. Really peaceful and beautiful, except for the rocks and muck I had to trek through around its edge for 1/3 mile!


I passed a lot of people today, all going south, most day hikers, probably another 30 or so. Oh, and I also saw more of those little red spotted newts the whole hike today. They look like little animal gummies. Not edible though.


Between Camp Road (where there’s a Mohican Outdoor Center) at mile 1307.5 and Catfish Fire Tower (mile 1310) is a rock ledge that’s pretty cool. Too bad it was still foggy. The trail goes along the exposed solid rock and slopes off the right to a sheer drop. Really cool considering the fog. I walked to about six feet of the drop off and got a photo over the edge and then several others of the sloping rock. There was another place early on in the hike where the trail was one piece of exposed bedrock solid for about 75 yards. Times like that I realize the bedrock is the mountain and the flora came later, took root, cracked the bedrock, and left layers of detritus as dirt. That’s my geological understanding.


After the fire tower, which you can go up but I did not, a place on the trail is called “Rattlesnake Spring.” I did not see any snakes though. 


Half mile later I was on Millbrook Rd. End of today’s hike at 12.52 miles in 6 hours 36 minutes. A lot of rocks to slow you down. I went to call my ride and had one bat on Verizon. I needed an address on the road and the direction I was going was downhill. As I walked I kept looking at the bars. Holding steady at one. If it went to zero I was in trouble. Either thumb or walk until I got bars or 15 miles to the hotel. About 1/2 mile down the road I came to a house and still had a bar, sometimes two. I called and my ride, Dad’s Taxi, would be there in 1/2 hour. In the meantime I just sat by the street on the corner of the property. The owner came out of his house after about twenty minutes to let his dogs out. He didn’t see me at first but I waved and said hi. I told him I was waiting on a cab and he offered to let me sit on the porch and if I wanted something to drink. I politely declined both. My cab finally showed up 45 minutes after I called.



The driver/owner asked if I’d seen any bears but I had not not. Probably all the people on the trail scared them off. She told me she’d seen five in two days. No surprise. Statistics reveal that NJ has more bears per square mile than any other state. That was a surprise to me when I learned it.She dropped me at Holiday Inn Express in Newton, NJ. I got cleaned up and went next door to Appleby’s for dinner. Don’t really prefer Appleby’s but can’t be picky. Back in room by 7 and been updating this journal.


One more milestone today. Passed 1300 mile mark since southern start in Georgia.","DWG NRC Information Center
",Millbrook Road,"May 19, Thu",12.52
TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651442,"I forgot to mention that yesterday I saw another Scarlet Tanager around Sun Pond when I stopped to take a pebble out of my shoe. It was on a branch 15 feet away. I tried to get a photo and the damn thing flew off! I also saw what I thought was a Bald Eagle, then thought it was a Golden Eagle with something in its mouth. The bird had just taken flight and was very majestic. Only saw it for about a second. I told a local about it today and they said it was probably a young Bald Eagle. Still, very cool to see from about 20 yards on a mountaintop. 
This is probably a good spot to insert something I should have expressed at the beginning.
On the trail, and I can only speak for myself, but senses are on overload. I gotta watch where I’m walking, I gotta also glance all around constantly, I gotta listen to everything, I gotta pay attention to if I am upwind or down, I have to pay attention to what my nose tells me, I gotta pay attention to temperature shifts, I gotta pay attention to changes visually however slight in the atmosphere (whether I can see it or not through the trees.) point is, so much is going on that it is sensory overload as it is happening, and it is all new to me as I hike. Bottom line, when I update my journal and reflect back on this morning, it feels as if that was so long ago. It is eerie. So bear with me if I forget something and add it the next day.


Other thing is some may think my journal entries are long and too detailed (no one has said such.) The entries are for me to reflect back on first and foremost. They are for the non-participant reader second. I value the reader in the sense that maybe I’m expressing something vicariously or for a future hiker something I write about helps them out.
Also, I write these on my I-phone Notes app and then copy/paste. Sometimes it doesn’t paste exactly what I wrote and I don’t catch the errors so bear with me. If I try to type this directly into the journal it times out and I lose all I typed and have to start over.


So that being said, Dora, my cab driver picked me up a little late at 7:45. It was a long haul back to my start point and between our conversations yesterday and today we have a great rapport, which is good for a hiker dependent on rides. Dora dropped me off at the AT road intersection around 8:25 after getting all my gear right (my phone connected to power, my gloves on, my map sleeve on, my bear spray attached to my pack, double check that I still have my cash and credit card/ID, check that all my backpack pockets are zipped up, etc, etc,) I set out at 8:29 for a 14-mile day. Literally .44 miles into it I hit a pond that has breeches its overflow because of the recent rains (hopefully the photos show up.) so what to do? There was a guy on the other side and I could tell he had gone through because he was wet. So I decided to not go the way he had gone and treaded along several exposed rocks until they disappeared and with 15 feet left had to just trust and step through the onrushing water across to the other side. I went up to my knees in water so not too bad. The other hiker met me with his trekking poles extended to keep me from losing my balance or slipping on the wet rocks and getting swept over the short falls downstream. I made it, obviously.


So my Salomon hiking boots, which I swear by, were soaked but so what. I’ve hiked in soaked shoes before. So I spent about 10 minutes talking to “Root Seeker” while he got out of his wet clothes. He is from PA and through-hiking from Georgia. I finally said my goodbye and didn’t see him again today.


About 1-1/2 miles I forgot about my wet feet. Felt fine. Salomons. Great stuff. 


So I had fantastic hiking terrain for about 7-1/2 miles. A lot of it dirt trail or fire road and flat. Every once and while an up or down slope. The bear warnings were out and I tried to be quiet but I never saw one. By the way, there were very few people on the trail, no one passed me (which I strive for) and I thought it would be the right opportunity to see a bear but it just didn’t happen. Maybe tomorrow. 


I did see several more Scarlet Tanagers and maybe the photo of one will post. I see an awe full lot of reddish-brown millipedes, about three inches long, as well. I hear woodpeckers and I think I saw a pileated one in flight (think of Woody the Woodpecker) but I’m not sure. I heard an owl twice but never saw one. 


So just before Rattlesnake Mountain (didn’t see any) was a series of four up/down hills over 3-1/2 miles. Reminded me of another Piccillo high school workout between miles 7-1/2 and 11. Treating it like high school and imagining my coach yelling at me made it easier only in the sense that I reminisced those experiences from 45 years ago. 


So I got several good photos from overlooks, I hope they show up.


At the end, what turned out to be 14 miles, is a tavern, which I ventured into. I got cleaned up in the bathroom and changed my shirt out then proceeded to drink beer as a thunderstorm crept in. Finished just in time. I ended up having to call Dora to come get me and drive me to the Hampton Inn in Matamoras 16 miles away. 45 minutes later when I left I had gotten to know one other hiker, three locals, and four bartenders. One of the locals and I had a really long conversation on the AT, farms, and farm equipment. I need a tractor.


So Dora picked me up and as it rained outside I was comfy in her SUV as we went to the hotel. She’ll pick me up in the morning and drop me off for tomorrow’s hike.


I got cleaned up at the hotel and walked to a strip mall Italian place. I met Chris who waited on me at the bar as I enjoyed a beer and ordered a large stuffed pizza. This thing is huge. Hopefully the photo shows up. I’m at the same hotel through Monday morning so plenty of leftovers. Anyhow, before I ever started, this older (than me) guy (Joe) comes in and sits down. Starts talking to me.  Vietnam vet, army. Game on. We talked for 2-hours. In comes another guy, 74-years old. Heard I’m a submarine vet. He was on Tinosa and later army intelligence.  All three of us talk until closing. Rich, intel guy, drives me back to hotel. Well, I know every employee in the restaurant now and two regulars. Good thing since I’m here two more days.

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651559,"It is Sunday afternoon. Sorry I didn’t update this yesterday. 


Saturday morning Dora picked me up for the last time, around 8:20, and I was back at Carver Gap and on my way at 8:48 am. 


After a short flat, muddy warm-up, the trail goes up about 550 feet over 1.3 miles. Not a bad climb but enough to break a sweat on what already is going to be a humid, hot, and breeze less day. 




The trail then goes about three miles over relatively flat terrain, fewer rocks, but includes three small “humps” over the last mile that are deceiving in that they get your attention. This then takes you up 300 feet to the top of Sunrise Mountain. This is roughly 5-miles into today’s 14-mile trek and my first break for fluids. Two minutes later I’m back at it.The next 3-1/2 miles looks easy and flat but is not. There are short sharp drops and rises that hit the quads. Then it is 6-miles of “more of the same” never rising or falling more than 150 feet but somewhat strenuous all the same with temps near 90 and no breeze.I passed maybe 50 hikers, all going south, and most day or weekend hikers. The biggest group was about three dozen high school students out for five days. I talked briefly with one of their guides, a Naval Academy Junior. 


All in all the day was uneventful, I didn’t see any cool critters, they were all out of the heat, and overall it wasn’t a hard hike. 


I finished up at 13.75 miles in 6 hours 17 minutes, so at 3:15, at the High Point Ranger Station at Port Jarvis, NJ.


I went inside and saw Nora again, the lady I had met when I took the photos of the rattlesnake several days ago. She showed me photos and video of another she had seen later that same day. I was ahead of her so I must have just missed it. This snake was huge, not long, maybe 3-1/2 feet, but fat, like wrist-size, and muscular looking. Most rattlesnakes pretty much fit that description, not really long but thick.


I called for a cab and within 10 minutes I was headed back to the Hampton Inn Lin Matamoras 8 miles away. I had slack packed today with only fluids so that was nice weight-wise leaving all my other gear in the room.


I did a little incidental shopping when I got back then went to Goodfella’s for a couple beers and to plan out the next week. 


I watched a little TV and fell asleep around 10:30. Nice to be in a hotel.

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651734,"I got up at 6:00 Monday morning and still had not gotten a response to my online cab request from Sunday. The cab dispatcher had told me on Sunday to call back at 7:00 Monday morning though despite me filing an online request. It’s a little unnerving not knowing if you have a ride 8-miles back to the trailhead or if you have to walk. That just goes with the territory of hiking and staying at hotels as opposed to camping. I called at 7:00 and a cab showed up not 10 minutes later.




The cab dropped me at the High Point Ranger Station and after prepping my gear I began the 18-mile hike to Rte-517 in Glenwood, NJ at 7:31am. The forecast was for temps in the 70’s and no rain.The trail started off across a field and then into the woods and went up two sharp inclines separated by a .4 mile flat section and ended near the High Point Monument. This is a memorial for New Jersey’s veterans and the spot is the highest point in New Jersey at 1800 feet on the Kittatinny Ridge.From there the trail continues through the woods and gradually off the mountain over the next nine miles. This section of the trail is not bad at all with few rocks and a mix of dirt trails and meadowlands. 



The trail follows several roads before several long straightaways of dirt road around the Wallkill National Wildlife Preserve leading back into the woods and up Pochuck Mountain. There’s a couple steep parts up the mountain but they are fairly short and not that bad. The northside of Pochuck brings one to County road 565 in Glenwood. Another 1.25 miles brings one to County road 517. That’s where I got off. This put me 3-miles from the Appalachian Motel.
I did see a deer and a garter snake today but the best was the 5-foot Blacksnake. I was on a winding dirt trail and I heard a rattle off to my right so I stopped cold thinking it was a rattlesnake. It didn’t sound quite right though so I thought maybe it was a juvenile one but I couldn’t see it. I took about three more steps be cautious and then saw what it was, a five foot Blacksnake swishing the tip of its tail in the dry leaves simulating a rattler. I had heard that they will do that. The snake was backed up against a tree and took an aggressive stance towards me. I took a photo before it turned and climbed the tree. I hadn’t seen that before. I took two photos so maybe they will post.


All in all this is a really nice section of the trail. My only complaint is that in several sections where it crosses roads, the trail is not clearly marked and it is hard to figure out which way to go. Very frustrating.


When I got to 517, I walked to the nearest residential street and called Uber but none were available. Then I tried calling a cab but had no luck. I had 1.7 miles to walk to Glenwood restaurant so I started walking. About halfway into it a guy was checking his mail so I asked if he knew of any local transportation services. He ended up offering to drive me up to the restaurant, which I gladly accepted. I ate dinner and drank a few beers taking to locals, one of which offered to drive me to the motel, which I again accepted.



The motel is pretty rustic but it beats sleeping in the woods. I made hotel reservations in Glenwood Lake for tomorrow and the owner is picking me up. Nice! I’ve also got a reservation for a ride back to the trailhead in the morning. It hasn’t been confirmed yet but at worst I have a 3-mile walk to look forward to.So today turned out to be 18.14 miles and it took me 7 hours and 46 minutes.


I passed another milestone a few days ago too. My hundredth day on the trail. Today marks my 103rd but only my 80th hiking day (because of zero days, or days off.) I’ve completed 1358 trail miles since the southern start in Georgia.","High Point Ranger Station

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651837,"Today’s hike started off disappointedly and got worse towards the end. These days happen. 


I had scheduled a cab ride to the trailhead 3-miles away but it had not been “confirmed” so at 6:40 I started walking. About 1-1/2 miles into it a lady pulled over and offered me a ride which I of course accepted. 


I was feeling really lethargic today, not sure why, maybe the eating once a day catching up with me although I have a lot of “stores” load under my belt to carry me. 



The trail out of Glenwood, NJ is a really nice boardwalk through and around Pochuck Creek. Pretty much a nature preserve at the base of Wawayanda Mountain. Wawayanda, which means ‘winding waters’ or something like that, takes hikers up the rock and Boulder face some 1000 feet over about 1-1/4 miles. It’s a strenuous climb with no breaks and is discouraging in that one can’t see a break in the rocks or trees ahead indicative of the top. As a hiker, there’s nothing to look forward to over the next clump of boulders. Finally I saw light shining through the mountaintop and knew I was close. Anyhow, really good workout for the morning and only 15 more miles to go for the day.After Wawayanda, the trail is a constant up and down over shorter 250 foot to 100 foot rises and falls. Not too bad but enough to let you know you are in the mountains. 


At Long House Creek the trail ramps up to the rocks/boulders that the elevation charts don’t explain. The trail looks relatively flat from there to Greenwood Lake. It is anything but. This is one of the most grueling parts of the AT so far. The bedrock at the top of the mountain chain continually has sharp rises and falls so a hiker has to climb up a steep point to get on top of the bedrock, then traipse along the top only to climb steeply down several hundred feet later, walk through a short stretch of woods and do it all over again. This goes on for miles. Every time one comes off the boulders and goes into the woods the thought of the boulders being over is only interrupted by another boulder stretch. In many cases, the trekking poles are useless and one has to pull oneself up the rock face. Or down. Sometimes the steps up or down are 30 or so inches so one is having to rely on momentum and faith. The legs really take a beating. 


I was really looking forward to Greenwood Lake and ended up taking an unexpected zero day. My body is beat up. That being said, I did pass into New York and from the boulders could actually see Manhattan very far away.



The owner of The Breezy Motel picked me up around 3:45 on NY 17A and drive me down three miles to the motel. Not before I walked and extra 1/4 mile to a local creamery for ice cream which tasted great after a 17-mile day.After getting situated in motel room and cleaned up, I walked a mile to a local place, Murphy’s, for a steak dinner and watching NY Mets and Rangers games with the locals. Only 3000 people in Greenwood Lake. Great little hide-a-way. 


I also reassessed the hike forward and opted for a zero day because I’m too beat up. It’s only been 34-miles since last break but the last 17 really took a toll. 


Tomorrow I’ll take care of some things and figure out what I’m going to do going forward.

Despite that, I felt a lot better than yesterday and the night’s rest was worth it as well as the unscheduled day off.I soaked in Epsom Salts (they work wonders on aches as well as small cuts) and took my time getting things in order. Around 11, I walked “downtown” (there is one light and 3000 people in Greenwood Lakes) to mail 1lb 5oz of unnecessary gear home, then exchanged money at a bank ($100’s are light but hard to break), went to CVS for something to treat my poison ivy on my arm and hip (pharmacist diagnosed it immediately) and then stopped by an Irish Pub for planning. I got a few things scheduled out going forward, mainly that I need to ratchet plans back from 18-mile days to 10-15 mile days for the immediate future, otherwise I’m going to get frustrated, badly hurt, or both, and quit. I don’t want any of that and since it is my hike with my preset goals, I can adjust on the fly, although disappointedly.

I went back to the Pub for a couple of beers before heading back to the motel.one thing about not camping and going into town is all the cool people you meet and the uniqueness of the environs. So I arranged forwarding my mail drops (priority mail allows you to forward ahead or return at no cost) and planned my shuttle pick-up tomorrow morning and afternoon as well as my next hotel, Hampton Inn.just watching a little TV now and crashing early for tomorrow.","Greenwood Lake, NY

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/651927,"Thursday’s hike, feeling good after the day off. Got up at 6:40, Carl is picking me up at 8:00. Carl was actually early and he dropped me off at the trail junction just before 8:00 and I was off at 8:03. The beginning mile was woodsy, flat and nice. Cool temps, almost too cool, but I knew I’d warm up.
After the warm-up came a drop down into the Eastern Pinnacles at mile 1376.7 and then Cat Rocks at 1377.5. These were similar to Tuesday’s boulders, steep ups and downs, but not as long. They had a nice crevice wide enough to fall through. Then the trail dropped more than 500 feet onto Lakes Road and right after led to Fitzgerald Falls. Not really high but the area is really nice nonetheless. A boulder staircase runs beside the falls. The top of the falls leads to a flat section that ends at Mombasha High Point. Supposedly you can see NYC from there including the Empire State Building but I couldn’t see it. Too much vegetation in the way.


At this point I had 6- miles in and 6 to go. So far the rises and falls had been rather easy, not too steep. That was about to change over the next 6 miles to Arden Valley Road.The elevation chart doesn’t do it justice but many of the steep rocks had to be traversed by hand. The worse is the downs although both ups and downs really stress different muscle groups and are mentally challenging regardless. Fatiguing as well either way. This part of the AT is definitely a workout. The sharpest fall/rise was between 2.3-5 miles where the trail drops 600 feet and then immediately rises 600 feet. The other was at the end at NY-17 where the trail is aptly named “agony grind.” Over about 4/10 of a mile, the trail plummets 500 feet and it is nearly all small boulders/big rocks. This took me nearly an hour. You gotta take your time or you are screwed. Fall here and something is likely to break. Very stressful on the joints and the feet in particular.So I got to the road just before 3:00 to end a slow 6 hour 48 minute day of 11.63 miles. Carl picked me up about 15 minutes later and dropped me at Hampton Inn four miles away. Did laundry, got cleaned up, ate dinner at TGIF and am watching New York Rangers hockey and catching up this journal.


Today was a great flora and fauna day. I took a video of a pileated woodpecker and probably 1/2 dozen photos. I hope they all post. So besides the video and stills of the woodpecker, I saw a four foot Blacksnake, a small Garter snake, several salamanders with red heads (gotta look those up,) a tree a beaver had been working over, some cool looking tree fungus, and a deer. I think that was it.


I’m sore all anew but tomorrow is a new day and I’ll be going another 12 miles to Beechy Bottom Brook near the Palisades Interstate Parkway. Carl will drop me off and pick me up. 


Already made reservations for tomorrow at Bear Mountain Inn on the west bank of the Hudson River and then Saturday and Sunday at the Inn on the Hudson on the east bank in Peekskill, NY. Saturday’s hike is a 14-miler to Peekskill, NY. Sunday is a rest day there and Monday not sure of yet.


So with 11.63today I’m at 149.45 since May 14. That’s 34-miles less than what I planned for but it is what it is.","Greenwood Lake

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652037,"Carl picked me up early from the Hampton Inn and I was off and hiking from the Harriman State Park entrance off of NY-17 at 7:54am. The first 1/2 mile was road and smooth path that led to the first big rise, 600 feet over a mile. This was relatively easy park path and along the way I saw a bear. It was 75 yards or so ahead on a path and went over a hill. The AT diverged to the left of the bear’s path and then paralleled it. I was downwind of the bear at first so I didn’t think it sensed me. Once the paths split, I knew it was off to my right somewhere. A short while later it came over a grassy knoll maybe 40 yards away to my right and it sensed me immediately and turned and ran out of sight. Shortly after I sighted it again, further off to my right and it did not sense me so I was able to photo and video it from maybe 100 yards. It eventually did sense me and ran off again. I’ll try to post video and photos. 


For the next hour or so I had to hike and be aware, looking all around, because I did not know if we would cross paths again and I didn’t want to startle it. I did not see it or another bear the rest of the day.



The hiking through the park was really nice, a welcome relief to my legs and feet. Many of the paths were grassy or loose dirt and pebbles with few rocks. The rises and falls were deceiving on the elevation chart because nearly all of them had stone steps so although taxing they beat scrambling up a dirt or boulder/rock-strewn mountainside.This part of the AT has the “Lemon Squeezer.” It’s a cavelike entrance into a thin crevice that the hiker has to walk through that is only 15-18” wide. My pack rubbed the whole way and almost got hung up. It’s only about 30 feet long. At the end, there’s a rock wall about 20 feet straight up. The trail goes over that. I had to pitch my trekking poles up and then go up it by hand. There’s an easier side cut but I wasn’t doing that. I made it just fine. I will try to post photos of the Lemon Squeezer.There’s photos of the elevation charts as well.When I was almost to Palisades Parkway, the end for the day, the trail detoured to my left and took me 2-miles out of my way. Through dry leaves I trekked until I heard the rattle 25 feet ahead. Good thing because the fat rattler was right on the trail. It had been crossing and now parked against a log, coiled up and ready to strike. I took several photos and video then worked my way far to the left of it cautious of any others and always watching it. Once on the other side I took more photos then moved on. Eventually I came out near Doyle traffic circle and 1/2 mile ahead of Anthony Wayne Recreation area where I was supposed to meet Carl. The detour just ended, no more markings. So I called Carl and told him where I was and that I’d be heading down the highway toward an exit and in the direction of the Bear Mountain Inn where I’d be staying. A little while later Carl and I reconnected and he drove me on to the Inn. 



The AT goes through the Inn’s property so that’ll make it nice for the morning when I can slack pack the 2.1 miles I missed and then head on into Peekskill tomorrow and pick up my relief package from the post office before checking into the Inn on the Hudson for the next two days.So a little trivia:


Harriman State Park is named for Averill Harriman, heir of a railroad magnate and government official throughout the Roosevelt-Truman- yada yada administrations. His third wife, Pamela, was once married to Randolph Churchill, Winston’s son. Pamela’s son is also named Winston Churchill. Aside from that but if trivia, there was debate over the building of a state prison on the land that eventually became the park so the prison, Sing Sing, was build further up the Hudson River, hence the phrase of being “sent up the river.”


Also, Anthony Wayne Recreational area is named for “Mad” Anthony Wayne, famous general of the American Revolution. For my Virginia friends, and AT hikers, since you will go through it, Waynesboro, Virginia is named in his honor. Also, Bruce Wayne, or Batman, is a direct descendant of General “Mad” Anthony Wayne.


Another milestone with today’s 14-1/4 miles. I went over 1400 on the AT.","Southfields, NY

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652140,"Daniel, the recreation director at the Bear Mountain Inn, drove me to Seven Lakes Drive and I was able to resume my northward AT hike gong up and over Bear Mountain. After 3.8 miles I was back at the resort. I had left my pack as I knew the trail cut through the property so I picked it up at the front desk. The hike is pretty easy as there are stone steps going up and down the mountain, a lot of them. Just one of the perks when the trail cuts through popular tourist/vacation areas. I’m sure a lot of people think the entire AT is this “easy,” it is not.


Bear Mountain is about a 1100 foot ascent/descent.


So I left the resort headed north and I saw my second bear up close. This was because the trail cuts through the trail side museum and zoo. 


It continues across the Hudson River via the Bear Mountain Bridge towards Peekskill with West Point just up the river. I could hear gun and cannon fire all day.


When I got to the middle of the bridge it began to rain hard. It had been overcast all morning so I knew it was coming. A lot of hikers will hunker down, understandably, because they don’t want to get all their gear wet. Because I opt for hotels I just hike through the rain. I threw on my poncho so it covered me and my pack. You still get wet from the humidity and the outside of the pack gets damp but oh well. Once I crossed the bridge, I had a short road walk then into the woods and up Anthony’s Nose, a 500 foot climb. It wasn’t that bad and the trees kept some rain off me. There’s a second 400 foot climb after a short descent but after that the trail is relatively flat until the descent to NY-9 and Route 403, 5 miles from Peekskill.


At the road junction is Appalachian Market. Very convenient, and excellent cell service. I was able to call an Uber and 12 minutes later I was being whisked to the Peekskill Post Office to pick up my resupply box. 2:00, and the PO closes at 4:00. Made it in plenty of time. The driver then took me the short 6/10 of a mile to the Inn on the Hudson. I had reservations for Saturday and Sunday, but since it is Memorial Day weekend, I extended it through Monday so I’ll hike again on Tuesday. 


So salute to all the active-duty personnel, the veterans, but more so to all those who served and who are no longer with us on this Memorial Day weekend.


I got in the room and unpacked all my stuff, laying the damp stuff in front of the AC. Then I got cleaned up and walked down the street to eat. Main Street has a lot to offer downtown. I ate healthy. Grilled salmon with potatoes and vegetables.


After that I went in search of a convenience store and heard live music. So I followed that and ended up in another part of town where several live bands were playing outdoors. I got a chocolate ice cream at a creamery and listened to several bands as I made my way slowly back to the Inn.



The places I hit were Birdsall House for dinner. Trivia: this was George Washington’s HQ and where he signed Benedict Arnold’s command papers for West Point.Down by the river where the music was I hit the Peekskill Station Deli and then the Peekskill Brewery. Both had live bands. Then on my way back I stopped at Sue’s Sunset House, an admitted “dive” bar, complete with a navy deep sea diving helmet. So I met a few folks in there and ended up talking the night away, mainly with Don, a former NYC policeman, a lawyer, and current judge in Peekskill. We had briefly met earlier at Birdsall.


So that ended my day/night. 10.13 miles in 4 hours 28 minutes. So 1413 miles down. I’ll take the next couple of days, do laundry, verify my trail waypoints, and make the necessary hotel/shuttle arrangements.","Palisades Parkway

From there I walked to a Family Dollar to pick up several things. From there back to hotel to drop stuff off. On way heard loudspeaker on Main Street playing “Morning Has Broken” with just church bells. Sounded really nice on a great Sunday weather-wise.Then walked back downtown for a pizza lunch. From there walked down to the river, where the music was last night, and walked around. Then got another ice cream at the creamery, walked around more, to the train station, the park, couldn’t decide what I wanted to do. Settled on the Taco Dive Bar by the railroad tracks and had a few beers while reviewing hike route for next several days. Then read weekend Wall Street Journal and did crossword while just hanging out. Then walked back towards hotel but stopped in Sue’s Sunset House. Judge Don was in there with his wife along with half a dozen other regulars. Hung out for two beers talking with guys about the trail. Left there and went back to hotel. Started watching Coca-Cola 600 NASCAR race and reading more of WSJ. Did some gear maintenance. Sprayed my pack, hammock-tent, gloves, poncho, and trekking pole handles with ammonia water. Kills stuff and keeps it from stinking plus my theory is that critters don’t like ammonia.Also liberally dusted my Salomon hiking shoes and insoles with Odor Eaters foot powder. Just watching end of race now and probably crash after that. Less stuff to do tomorrow.

They had a band playing and there were a lot of people out. One of the bartenders, Kyle, is a former aviation mechanic and was stationed at NAS Jacksonville. At one point my phone screen went almost completely black. I thought I was going to have to go to an Apple or Verizon store. I tried various things but couldn’t get it working right. Kyle asked to see it and he began hitting keys and in about 30 seconds it was fine. Somehow I had turned the brightness down. Big relief.I talked to a lot of people there, including a pharmacist and his wife. She had her doctorate in education. I was doing the WSJ crossword still and she was asking about it. Turns out she does them too. Her husband said he fly fished but didn’t really hike too much. He was familiar with a lot of the places along the trail though.I headed back down the riverwalk and walked and talked to a couple from Italy. I told them Susan is going in July. I stopped at the Taco Dive Bar and ended up talking to the owner’s family. We discussed my time in the service and the trail. Next I stopped my Sue’s and ended up talking to a bunch of the locals again.Then back to the Inn on the Hudson for the night.

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652281,"Called an Uber Tuesday morning and at 8:45 I was off on today’s hike. I forgot my power bank so I had to hike with my phone turned off. I usually rely on the Runkeeper app to keep track of where I am.


Also, to make things easier on myself, I slack packed today and reverse hiked, north to south, from Fahnestock State Park back to the Appalachian Market outside Peekskill. This allowed me to stay at Inn on the Hudson again so no guesswork on that and I knew I could get a ride at the Market since I had gotten an Uber from there on Saturday whereas Fahnestock I was unfamiliar with and unsure of Ubers or cabs.



The day was going to be hot, in the 90’s. Little did I know how hot. Although the hike was only 12.4 miles and relatively easy with few extreme rises and falls, the intense heat eventually sapped me and even fluids didn’t help. Also, there was pretty much no breeze. Being in the green tunnel did help some as the temps were lower and I wasn’t exposed to the direct sunlight but it was still humid and hot.
Not much to see today, although I did come across a snake with a frog’s leg in its mouth. I stopped to get a photo and the snake, paying more attention to me now, let the frog go.


At 3:00 I made it to the market, out of fluids and looking forward to downing some cold Gatorade and water. About 8 hikers were also at the market doing likewise in the shade of picnic table umbrellas. I got my stuff and joined them and we all swapped stories about the trail. They too agreed on how hot it was. Turns out it was 94 with a real feel temp of 102. Not fun.


An Uber picked me up and took me back to the Inn. I got cleaned up and walked to Birdsall’s for dinner. Now catching up journal and watching Theodore Roosevelt special on History Channel.


Already made hotel reservations for next two days in Pawling, NY. Talked to local cab driver too so I should be all set. After today I’m at mile 1426. The next two days are relatively light at 27 miles. Just the way things work out sometimes.


OK, trivia: Dutchman Jan Peeck began a fur trading business in 1650 in Annsville Creek. It later became known as John Peek’s Creek to the English but Peek’s Kill (creek or stream) to the Dutch. Jan Peeck also helped build the retaining wall in New York City for which Wall Street is named.","Peekskill
",Fahnestock State Park,"May 31, Tue",12.40
TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652321,"I got up at 6:40 and got all my stuff packed up. I called an Uber and was dropped back off at the AT crossing at Fahnestock State Park around 7:50. I got my gear all situated and was hiking at 7:58. Temps were cool and the forecast sounded a lot better than yesterday with temps in the 70’s throughout the day. As it was, they were lower than that in the woods, upper 50’s into the 60’s, ideal.


Today’s hike was an easy 12-miler with few hills. This would put me within a dozen miles of Pawling, NY. I arranged to stay at the Station Inn in the heart of this small town. My only concern was getting a ride there from the highway. I had talked to a Pawling cab company and they said they could get me but there are always concerns.


So I saw a garter snake pretty much right away and since it stopped I took a few photos. As with most snakes I’ve seen, it had been crossing the trail. By the way, yesterday’s snake was a garter as well with the classic yellow racing stripes and black herringbone pattern. I saw another garter later today. It raced across the trail right in front of me and went under a rock.


The only somewhat difficult parts of today were the sections going up/down Hosner Mountain at mile 1432.7 and again at mile 1436.3. The trail went down and back up about 600 feet over about 2-miles the first  time and down and up about 500 feet over 1.5 miles the second time. They weren’t really that bad. The switchbacks helped. I got to NY-52 in Stormville after the last down/up and within a few hundred feet found a street address and called an Uber.  I was in luck. 20 minutes later I was on my way to Pawling. I got dropped off at 2:30, too early to check in by 1/2 hour. Fortunately there was a place called Tacos and Cones a few doors up so I went and got a large cup of soft chocolate. By the time I finished that I could check in. So I unpacked all my stuff (two days here,) washed my shorts and shirt and hung them to dry, then took a shower. After that I walked across the street to McKinney & Doyle Fine Foods and had a ribeye dinner. That hit the spot. Now just updating the journal at the bar. I talked to several ladies in here who asked me about the trail. Kelly, the bartender, is from Stormville so it turns out where I caught the Uber is a couple houses down from hers. Another lady, Christine, went on Safari in Africa during COVID but she said she has contemplated hiking the AT. Another lady, Janice, whose daughter is Kelly’s best friend since 4th grade, has been to the Amazon rainforest, Machu Picchu, swimming with whales, and a number of other worldly adventures but she hasn’t hiked the AT.


So the reason I’m here two days is because today put me 13 miles (hiking)/11 miles (driving) from Pawling. After tomorrow’s hike I’ll be 2.8 miles from where I’m staying. So, I can slack pack and catch a ride when I come off the trail tomorrow. Friday I’ll head on north toward Kent, CT.


So today’s hike was only 11.57 miles and I did it in 5 hours, 50 minutes. 


Now it is raining in Pawling. Hopefully I don’t get caught in it tomorrow. 


Since I’ve seen garter snakes lately, here’s a little trivia on them. The males can put off both male and female pheromones. Apparently they can attract other males on cool/cold evenings and it keeps them warm.","Fahnestock State Park

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652406,"Another day, 2 June. An Uber picked me up at 6:25 this morning. I was hoping to get done before the late afternoon forecasted rain. Since I was coming back to Station Inn in Pawling, I was slack packing today.


Leaving NY-52 in Stormville northbound, the trail was pretty easy terrain-wise for 6-1/2 miles, but because it had rained since 5:00 yesterday evening off and on, the trail was heavily saturated and the insects were out. Even though my clothing and pack has been sprayed with Permethrin, which usually keeps them down, today there were pockets of the trail where the mosquitos seemed to not care or be affected and went after me anyhow. It was more nuisance than anything.



There was really nothing to see and no interesting critters along this stretch up the flattened Mt. Egbert, NY. It is probably great on a dry day.
I wasn’t feeling very energetic today so that only added to making today less than stellar. 


On the downside of Egbert into NY-55 and Poughquag, NY, this section of trail hits its most interesting feature, Nuclear Lake. This was a bomb-grade uranium and plutonium research and testing site throughout the Cold War from the 1950’s until it was closed in 1972. The area has been tested for radioactivity and been given a clean bill of health. Although, the National Park Service has closed four wells along the AT close to this area and warns of unsafe standards as per the Clean Waters Act. Still, I saw two different hikers get water from streams. Not me. I filter my hotel water.


After Nuclear Lake, the trail gradually rises up West Mountain,again, pretty easy, like Egbert. Then it’s a quick drop 600 feet over 1/2 mile onto West Dover Road and back into Pawling. I was three miles from the hotel. I continued on the trail after photographing a huge oak tree beside the road. This is the Dover Oak, believed to be the largest oak on the AT with a girth of some twenty feet near its base. It is estimated to be 300 years old but no one is sure or will be until it dies, is cut down, and the rings can be counted. A real impressive site. Hopefully my picture posts OK. By the way, the other huge oak on the AT is the Keffer Oak in Virginia. I took photos and wrote about that one in 2019. It too is right on the trail.


After Dover Road, it was a short 2-mile hike through pastureland and woods to NY-22 and the Appalachian Trail Railroad Station. I called a cab from a street vendor  area a couple hundred yards up the street (there’s a food trailer on each side of the road.) about 25 minutes later I was being driven the 2.4 miles back to the Station Inn. It was a little after 2:00. By the time I got back and got a shower, it was raining out. Just missed it. 


I went to O’Connor’s Public House for lunch/dinner of wings and fries and two Bud Lights. I made my travel arrangements for the next couple of days and paid some bills on line.


Here’s a lesson learned. When carrying cash, while $100’s are easier to manage and carry, a lot of banks will not break them unless you have an account with that bank. Very frustrating. It’s harder for cabs or some businesses to take $100’s and make change. So, many of the restaurants will break them,even if you do like me and charge the meal to a credit card. O’Connor’s happily gave me five twenties for a hundred.


After O’Connor’s I went to CVS for a snack for later and for a Gatorade and a Diet Coke. Then I stopped off at the ice cream place again for a large cup of chocolate.


Been back in room since 5:45, resting up, watching TV. Probably go to bed at 10:00.


Tomorrow I adjusted things since it is supposed to rain until 11:00 am. Instead of going early and long, 19 miles, and then having a zero day, I am going to leave at 11 and go 7.7 miles. The local cab company will pick me up and drop me at the next hotel in New Milford, CT. So I’ll avoid the rain and the short day will count as a zero day sort of. I’ll hike 11.2 miles on Saturday and come back to the same hotel, so that will be a slack pack day. Sunday I’ll be off on a 16-miler to Sharon, CT. Not sure if I’ll take a real zero after that and do laundry. Depends on how body feels.

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652439,"Today, Friday, was one of the best days yet. I didn’t see any exciting critters, but I felt great and after an on/off rain since yesterday afternoon, at 9:20 the skies cleared and the sun came out. Maybe eating an egg, pepper, and cheese croissant along with coffee and orange juice this morning we’re a major factor in how I felt.


I texted the taxi service and they picked me up at 9:45 and I was hiking at 10:05. I briefly talked to another north-bounder at the AT crossing on NY-22 at the start but he stopped to take pictures and I didn’t see him again. I had a south-bounder pass by after about 3/4 mile and they were the only people I saw until I was done for the day. Great hiking. No bears though. 




The first mile was through pastureland, which was nice getting the legs warmed up. I passed some cows that stared at me. I was wondering if I was going to get charged but they held tight.The next 6/10 of a mile ascends almost 500 feet to a ridge line and the climb felt fine. Also, I was concerned about mosquitoes since it had rained again but there were none, or few. Maybe the sun coming out and drying things helped.The ridge line descends slowly over 4 miles to Leather Hill Rd. From there I had a quick descent 350 feet over 3/10 mile to Duell Hollow Rd. Once I crossed, There was a detour notice with instructions and a separate map. I took photos of both. Apparently, a bridge had washed out up ahead so the trail was diverted to the roads for about 1.5 miles. I almost went for the adventure but opted out and stuck to the detour. When I got back on the trail, within 50 yards I passed a sign welcoming me to Connecticut. Yea! I only had a couple of tenths of a mile to get to CT-55, my pick-up spot.Once there I had no cell service. I walked toward my ultimate destination, Rocky River Inn in New Milford 8-miles away, and within 1/4 mile had a bar and a little further on 2 bars. I was in front of Witzke Landscaping & Tree Service, and I had an address. So I texted Segundo’s Taxi (great service, by the way) and they sent a driver out to get me. In the meantime, I noticed the biggest Sugar Maple I’ve ever seen in the front yard. I took a couple photos. The owner said they thought it might be one of the largest and oldest in Connecticut. So first a White Oak yesterday and now the Sugar Maple. It looked almost as big as the oak. 


Segundo’s showed up 20 minutes after I called them and in ten minutes I was checking into Rocky River Inn. It was only around 2:30 so not bad for a (not quite a zero) rest day. I got cleaned up and unpacked since tomorrow will be an eleven miler slack pack day into Kent, CT and then back to Rocky River Inn. The room is pretty nice. Only
Problem is nothing is within walking distance (NOT hiking after hiking.) They did have a menu from New Milford Pizza Station who delivers (more than pizza too.) I ordered a pizza so now I have breakfast as well. 


So today was 7.62 miles in 3 hours 19 minutes. I’m at 1460 miles on the AT.


Trivia: the largest Sugar Maple, by girth, in the world was measured in 2016 at 22-1/2 feet around. It is estimated at 72 feet tall. The national champion tree is in Giles, Virginia on Mountain Lake Rd.

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652499,"I got up at 6:00am on Saturday and at 7:00 Segundo’s Taxi was there to take me back to the trail crossing on CT-55.


I was able to get started at 7:18. It wasn’t going to be a particularly long or hard day but it had a few challenging points. Being Saturday, I wanted to finish early and enjoy some of the day relaxing.


The trail starts off sort of flat but quickly ascends. Over the next mile it rises a little over 500 feet up Ten Mile Hill. Coming down the other side of the hill is just as steep but it descends further, to over 700 feet. One then has easy trekking through the woods and along the banks and over the Housatonic River. This stretch is spectacular. It seems like a page out of a 1950’s Field & Stream magazine, complete with fly fishermen and river rapids. The trail follows the Housatonic for about 2-miles before gradually veering west and away from it.


At this point it’s time for the major climb of the day, a more than 1000 foot ascent of Schaghticoke Mountain. This was a workout, but I was determined to get to the top non-stop, and I made it. I had another male hiker about 25 yards behind me at the start up but I never saw him again. The only other person I saw north bound was a young lady and I passed her just after the halfway point of the one-mile ascent. I only stopped to take a photo of a medium-sized Blacksnake right after passing her. We did have two trail runners pass us going south, a young lady, maybe late twenties, leading a young man, maybe mid-thirties. They passed me again on their return about 6-miles later so they had a long mountain run.


Once on top of the mountain, the trail continues along the top, gradual ups and downs, for about four miles. 


At nine miles from CT-55, the telltale that the descent to Schaghticoke Road near Kent, CT is back-to-back rises. Neither are that bad at all. The first goes up 380 feet and the second one 200 feet, it’s peak bringing one to the 750 foot descent over a mile to the road below. This descent is over rocks and small boulders so the going is slow at times.


Once on the road it is a short 8/10 of a mile walk into the town of Kent. I stopped at Kingsley Tavern and had lunch on the front porch, a turkey sandwich, fries, and a few beers.


Uber was unavailable so I called the cab company and in 30 minutes I was on my way back to Rocky River Inn 12 miles away.


It was about 4:00 when I got back, so I got cleaned up and watched some TV before ordering some calamari and wings for dinner. Saving the last of yesterday’s pizza for breakfast.


I took several photographs today so hopefully they post no problem.


Tomorrow’s hike is a 16-miler, bringing me to within 4-1/2 miles of Sharon, CT where I’ll stay at Sharon Country Inn.


Today’s trivia - Schaghticoke, pronounced roughly as schatta-cook, is named in honor of a Native American confederacy of northeastern tribes that were dwindling, similar to the Seminoles in Florida. An ethnogenesis. Today there are roughly 300 registered Schaghticokes in the are","Connecticut 55

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652575,"I had Segundo’s Taxi pick me up at 7:00 Sunday morning for the start of a 16-miler to Sharon, CT. They came a little early and I was able to start hiking at 7:19am. 


Out of Kent, CT, the trail heads north through a meadow for several hundred yards before the first ascent which is nearly 500 feet over 1/2 mile that leads to a series of small, continual ups/downs for 2-1/2 miles culminating in a sharp 300 foot climb to Caleb’s Peak. This is pretty strenuous and over rocky boulders, as is the climb down Caleb’s Peak to St. John’s Ledges 300 feet below. That’s nothing compared to the 600 foot descent from St John’s to River Road over 2/10 of a mile. It is a steep descent over rocky boulders where trekking poles only get in the way and become a tripping hazard. It’s very tough on the feet, quads, and hips.


Once at River Road, everything changes. The trail hits a gravel road, very flat, and eventually a dirt path that is also flat that is along the bank of the Housatonic heading upstream. This goes on for 4-1/2 miles. It’s a welcome relief and very scenic.


According to the EPA, the Housatonic is PCB contaminated, heavily in sections in Massachusetts because of GE. Although contaminants flow into parts of Connecticut 140 miles downstream, it must be below threat levels because fishing, rafting, and swimming are promoted.


At River Road again, the ease of the dirt path ends and for 6-1/2 miles, the trail is another series of ups/downs only amplified. Instead of 50-200 foot rise/falls, now they are 200-700 foot rise/falls. These are all pretty strenuous, mainly rocky boulders, some dirt, a little reminiscent of Pennsylvania in places. There are some flatter sections to catch your breath, ease the legs, but these are short-lived. The last descent brought me down to my end point, W. Cornwall Rd. near Sharon, CT.


Once there I was 4.6 miles to the Sharon Country Inn where I had reservations. W. Cornwall Rd. Has few houses in this section and no businesses, except for the Sharon Audubon Center. There is no Uber service and without an address, cabs won’t pick up. By the time I got to where houses were, I had walked 2-miles of the asphalt road. Better conditions than the trail but tougher on the feet in other ways. Hard, hot, asphalt. I tried thumbing the whole way, a hiker adventure in itself, to no avail. I wouldn’t have picked me up either. I ended up walking the 4.6 miles to the Inn after the 16-mile hike. My feet/legs/hips are feeling it.","Kent, CT

TIm Richard,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/652579,"On this, the anniversary of D-Day, it is my own D-day, as in decision day. I slept for 10 hours. I had to prop up my legs last night because my feet, ankles, and my heels were painful. It isn’t just the bottoms of my feet, but in and around the individual bones, tendons, etc. of my whole foot and ankle. My heels and hips are starting to feel it too. So, I have decided to stop for this year here. I do not want to risk some serious injury. I am not finished with the AT permanently, I am just done for this session. It is a little disappointing in that I didn’t get to my original goal of New Hampshire or even to my modified goals. I did, however, make it to Connecticut; 1487 miles from the start in Georgia back in 2018; I am now 707 miles from Katahdin, the northern terminus. Since May 14 I did hike 252 miles that included 44,600 feet of ascents and 44,800 feet of descents.
Tomorrow I take a taxi from Sharon to Hudson, NY. Wednesday morning I take Amtrak from Hudson to NYC going through Rhinecliff, Poughkeepsie, and Yonkers along the way, so should be somewhat scenic. Then from NYC I transfer trains and come south into Newport News, VA passing through Philly, DC, and Richmond (and a lot of other stops) getting into Newport News at 8:20pm. Then it’s a bus ride to Norfolk getting in at 9:10pm and then an Uber home in Virginia Beach. I’ll get to enjoy the beach (and the Eastern Shore house) until the 21st when I go back to work and traveling again. So the plan going forward is to heal up, start running again and throw in some Planet Fitness cross-training and some Seashore State Park hiking to maintain that specificity, and plan the next session from Sharon, CT north. Not sure when that’ll be. No later than Spring, 2023, but could be Fall of 2022. No hurry.
Thanks to everyone who continues to follow the journey!
Last bit of trivia: the rock walls one encounters throughout the woods are the result of landowners decades and even centuries ago who had to clear the land so they could plant crops. As they encountered rocks, they moved them to the edge of their property and thus built these usually low, 2-4 foot walls stretching sometimes for hundreds of yards. The walls served to mark their property, store rocks for later use such as building structures, and to hem in livestock. The walls are in tact today and are encountered throughout the Appalachian Trail.","Sharon, CT
