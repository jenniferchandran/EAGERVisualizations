My boss has removed most of my work load already so I don't have much to do, which means I think about the Trail.
Do I have the right gear?Will I be able to work thru the emotionally tough times?Will I be able to walk while in pain?Will my support crew stay motivated to support me for the duration?Am I expecting too much from them, being too selfish?
I am humbled by the amount of support I have already received. Words of encouragement, amazement, disbelief even. I remain strong in my commitment to finish, but fully aware that is easy to say while sitting here at my comfy desk.

Two Tents,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606763,"I'm done. Today was my last day at work for the next many months. Time to start transitioning to a life on the trail.
My support crew and I went thru what to pack in my resupply boxes. I suggested several times that they can please put unusual food items in the boxes to add a little variety to my food. Can't wait to see what they include.  :) Then I started saying goodbye. This was both a much bigger deal and more emotional than I was expecting. It was quite heartening to see how much many of them cared about me and my adventure.My new Tarptent Aeon LI is to be delivered on Monday, leaving just a couple days to practice setting it up before we leave for NC on Thursday. Our friends the Sewells invited us to stay at their house in NC, and then drive (in 2 cars!) to Georgia to see me off.

Two Tents,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606802,"Perhaps as many as 10 years ago, I got interested in trying to design the perfect tent. It had to be simple, easy to set up in the rain, able to stand up to high winds, and lightweight. The Teepee or pyramid geometry was very intriguing and easily met the first 3 criteria. The challenge for my design was to figure out tweaks to the design that would make it as light as possible. The problem with the pyramid tent is that its volume to surface area ratio is relatively low compared to other designs like the classic A-frame, tunnel, or dome tents. A pyramid just doesn't have as much usable volume.
Back when I was working on this, the available fabrics were nearly all nylon or polyester based. These fabrics are lightweight, can be coated to be waterproof, and are very strong. Their biggest issues is that they absorb moisture and stretch, making a tent sag from rain or condensation, requiring the occupant to go outside the tent to tighten up the guylines. Also, condensation on the inside of a nylon tent tends to build up into droplets that fall like fine indoor rain.
To keep weight down on my tent, it would have only a single wall, not a double wall tent with an outer rain fly and inner tent. Double wall tents deal with the condensation problem by having a lightweight inner tent that in not waterproof, but still catches the water droplets, which then slide down the outside of the inner tent. Single wall tents make it more tricky to deal with condensation. Making the walls of the pyramid tent steep can make the condensation drops roll down the inside of the tent without dripping, but that uses even more fabric, making the tent heavier.
One trick I thought of was to somehow chop off the top of the pyramid, hoping to save some weight by not having all that fabric up at the pointy top of the pyramid that provided no usable space inside the tent. How to keep the flat top spread out without using some heavy rod was a challenging problem. I also realized that because all the walls are sloped, any wall with a door would let in some rain because the door would be sloped also. I tried many layouts and spent many hours on this fun tent design problem, but eventually I slowly came to the conclusion that a pyramid shape was just not the best shape, and I stopped working on the design.
When I decided to hike the AT in March 2018, I didn't have a tent that was light and strong, so I started looking at the many many tent designs and manufacturers. During my investigation into finding a good tent, I kept ignoring, even laughing at manufacturers who made pyramid tents, thinking why would anyone use them? I had it in my head that pyramid tents were out but completely forgot why I ""knew"" this. I simply didn't remember working on the tent design all those years ago. After MUCH research and comparison spreadsheets, I settled on a Hilleberg Anjan 2, and purchased one. This tent is a tunnel tent. It is very strong, easy to set up, and has tons of space inside. The problem is, it is heavy because it is actually just a little too big inside. Nevertheless, I was confident that it was best for me. Other than the weight, I love this tent.
Then, after months of watching YouTube videos by thru-hikers who all mostly agreed that the lighter your pack, the more likely you are to finish a hike; and reading books about keeping pack weight down, I started to get unsure of my tent selection so I went back to investigating other shelter systems. I'll leave out some details here, but suffice to say that this investigation was nearly as involved as my first investigation.
Eventually I came across this cottage tent designer/manufacturer called Tarptent. The name suggests that the tents are a hybrid between and tarp with bivy sack, and a classic tent, but really their designs are just single wall tents. I waffled a lot with their designs. They just didn't seem to work for me. But at one point late in 2018, their website showed a new design called the Aeon LI.
The tent is a half pyramid with the door on the vertical side. The door has flaps over it so no rain comes in like with the sloped door of a classic pyramid tent. The walls of the tent are made of Dyneema fabric which is far lighter than nylon, does not absorb moisture, and does not stretch. Other tents made of this fabric show too that the condensation on the walls tends to stick to the fabric and roll down the sides and not ""rain inside"". At the bottom of the walls there is a bug-net-filled gap that lets the water run outside the tent. It is a very well designed tent.
The only problem was that it was yet for sale. After much thought and consideration, I got on their waiting list and eventually purchased one that will hopefully arrive on time.
Why tell this long story? When I saw the tent of the Tarptent website, I knew right away it was the perfect tent for me, but I completely forgot that I had worked on a very similar design nearly 10 years ago!

Two Tents,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607080,"I did ""the stairs"" at Amicalola Falls on the 10th, then said goodbyes to family and friends and started my hike on the 11th at the top of the stairs. It was, as expected, very hard to walk away from Vicky, Conor, Alex, Jess, Max, and Bennett. Hugs all around, way too many pictures, then I turned and walked up the approach trail towards Springer Mountain. So much planning and preparation up to this point, but I actually did not know where I was going to stay that night. The trail forked off from the trail down to the top of the Falls, which was a surprise and fitting reminder of my favorite poem. A poem that can be partly credited with my desire to hike this trail so long ago. I memorized this poem as a young teenager and recited it aloud many times during my first few days on the trail.
The Road Not Taken BY ROBERT FROST
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,And sorry I could not travel bothAnd be one traveler, long I stoodAnd looked down one as far as I couldTo where it bent in the undergrowth;
Then took the other, as just as fair,And having perhaps the better claim,Because it was grassy and wanted wear;Though as for that the passing thereHad worn them really about the same,
And both that morning equally layIn leaves no step had trodden black.Oh, I kept the first for another day!Yet knowing how way leads on to way,I doubted if I should ever come back.
I shall be telling this with a sighSomewhere ages and ages hence:Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—I took the one less traveled by,And that has made all the difference.
I have several related pictures that I will try to attach to this post. As I think I said before, I'm not going to say ""the trail did this, I saw this, etc."" Rather this journal will be about me, my physical and mental state, the people I meet, new friends, hiking buddies, and thoughts and feelings that pop into my head while hiking (if I can remember them!).
Just before reaching the summit of Springer I had to answer nature's calling. While way off the trail (I thought) in the woods, I saw a youngish woman walk by as the trail hooked around where I was. I swear she saw me. Dang it! When I got to the top of Springer, the shock of what I was doing, a thing I had wanted to do for nearly 45 years, came over me and I just stood there looking at the Appalachian Trail sign inlaid into bedrock. I looked down the trail for a long time, then stepped onto it and started my journey. I caught up to the woman as she was removing a jacket. She said she was going to Maine also. My first thru-hiker on the trail! Maddie. We ended up sharing a shelter with 2 other Dads that night, then she went off the next morning much faster than any of us. One of the nicest people I have ever met. I hope she makes it!
One of the Dad's and I quickly realized we were in about the same shape (he's way heavier than me tho'!) and that we had about the same hiking goals, i.e., take it slow for a couple weeks, so we set off together around 8AM. Eventually we settled on his trailname ""Redline"" which is the American flag with a red line thru it for Fire Fighters, which he had been for 35 years. We had a wonderful, patient, supportive rapport for the next several days. Not much really in common, but that just doesn't actually matter. Sometimes we talked continuously, sometimes we were quiet for an hour or more. Never more than a few hundred yards apart. It was close to the best way I could have started my journey. Eventually we got our first paved road crossing and he decided that he needed to sleep in a real bed to give his hips a rest, so we parted ways. It was easy to say goodbye, but also my first ""okay, so now I'm hiking alone"" moment.
I soon realized I could walk faster than I did when I was with Redline, so I marched off at a good clip. My body seems to be holding up surprisingly well, but something is wrong with my innards. I often feel dizzy and have weird stomach aches. My pulse rate never goes down to its normal rate. There are obvious explanations of course. I don't sleep (fear? anxiety? discomfort?) much and I don't eat much. Even today, after sleeping in a bed in the comfort and ""safety"" of a motel room, I have almost no appetite. I'm assuming that will go away. That is, after all, one of the reasons I'm doing this: to be less tense.
My shoulder and neck cramps have decreased noticeably. Yay!!! I have a mantra while I walk that seems to have helped. ""Head up, shoulders down, one foot in front of the other, don't fall.""
Head up to reduce neck strain, and to see all the amazing sights.
Shoulders down ostensibly to reduce back pain, but also to actively reduce emotional tension.
One foot in front of the other. Keep walking.
Don't fall. My biggest fear of all. When going down slippery hills (everything is slippery when it's been raining for DAYS!), slick rocks, leaves (Yikes!); I move like I have never walked in the woods before. Very slow short steps. Trekking poles holding me up. Fortunately my upper body strength has not diminished with age so if I start to fall or slip I can hold myself up on the poles.
I had many aches and pains the first few days. Knees, hips, ankles, lower back; and every time something started hurting I would think ""is this the sign my body is going to fail me and end this hike?!?"" But surprisingly, so far they have all gone away. I was really trucking along on TH 1/14. Breathing hard, but loving the speed. It was really cool! Except when I missed a turn and walked down a steep hill to a sign that said ""This is not the AT. Turn around and go back up. The AT will be on your right."" Thanks. Two bouts of diarrhea (everyone talks about bodily functions on the trail) and 20 minutes of steep uphill bush-whacking later and I was back on the trail. I was literally shaking on the way up the hill. Stupid. I wasn't lost. I wasn't even really mad at myself. Just ""non-specific anxiety"" until I got back on the trail.
On another note, the urge to go fast is far more powerful than I expected. It is really hard to avoid thinking I could skip this shelter or campsite and push on the next just to ""get further"". That was one of the best things about hiking with Redline. He wisely wanted to go slow.It would be very helpful to have one on my nerd friends create a spreadsheet that calculate average miles per day walking (with and without zero days), number of days to completion, and end date; based on average miles per day including zeroes. Having a way to check this every few days would help I think slow me down and enjoy the time. Even just a simple 2 column X 10 row table that has miles per day in the first column and end date in the second column would be helpful. I am thinking about making this a 201 day hike, ending on Sept. 1 (if I did the math in my head correctly).
My time is up for this library computer session. Hope someone finds this post in some way helpful and/or entertaining. I love what I am doing and can't thank my extended support crew enough for not only letting me, but encouraging me and supporting me on this crazy journey.
'Till next time.

Two Tents,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607211,"This may be short because I am typing on my phone. My pulse is finally down to normal 60, but I can still feel the tension in my chest. I can rationalize that I will be fine, safe, and can deal with the discomfort, but the sort of background stress does not go away. It in itself is exhausting. I am eating much better in spite of my unsettled stomach, so I should have more energy and be able to deal with the cold this coming week. The plan is to get to Top of Georgia by end of day Friday. That will include Yet2b’s first 11 mile day on Friday. His rain jacket was made from an apparent bad batch of fabric and is not waterproof! The manufacturer is sending a new one to Top of Georgia. We have not made plans beyond that but will probably stay in a hostel near there Friday night.I was going to write more but I can’t think very well while typing this way.

Two Tents,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607431,"This journal entry was delayed for reasons that will be explained. It talks about the third section of my hike. As in my other posts, I am leaving out a lot of details about the actual hiking.
After a night in an overcrowded shelter, and one in a wonderfully nearly-empty shelter, Yet2b and I decided to go into Helen GA for a zero day. A father and Boy Scout son gave us a ride into town. Helen is a curious German-themed town in the GA mountains. We were hoping for German food but all the German restaurants were closed. Bummer. We stayed 1 1/2 days in Helen, and just like in Blairsville, the night before and morning of returning to the trail I had bad anxiety. It was a huge struggle to keep going. My mind went crazy with all kinds of rationalizations. So much support and so many people - so much texting. So much love I feel I don’t deserve and was frankly overwhelmed by. And the surprising stress of planning. Several times on the trail and at a motel or the hostel I could feel the tension of crying coming on, but the tears never came. I always felt watched or that someone would hear me. Being with Yet2b, a semi-retired psychologist both helped and strained because I didn’t want him to think I was hoping for “mental health” aid. But he did most of the planning and I just willed myself to keep going.

We decided to try hitching back to the pass where we stopped. Either the second or third car that went by stopped to pick us up. Dillon drove a huge pickup truck and had his own business installing antennas on cell towers! He gave us a ride back to the trail. This involved him taking us to the wrong pass, then apologizing, and driving forever to take us back to Helen, then up to the right pass. When he dropped us off, he spent 10 minutes explaining his climbing gear to us. It was great fun, but my mind seemed foggy. It was like I was so far out of my comfort zone I could barely function. In a more normal situation, I would have peppered Dillon with all sorts of questions, but instead I found myself uncomfortable. After discussion later on the trail, Yet2b and I considered Dillon to be our first trail angel.
The hiking day was rainy as usual, but spirits weren’t too bad. We enjoyed walking along a narrow foggy ridge, saw a Baltimore Oriole scurrying around on the ground (which I later found out is rare to see). The only hardship for me was the continuing sharp neck pain when going uphill. I still don’t know if I was tricking myself into thinking/feeling that I was actually dealing with everything reasonably well given all the rain, tho’ even when it really downpoured on us, I wasn’t “unhappy”. It was kind of neat to walk for a long time (hours) in a downpour. I would stop and play with the flow of the stream (the trail was often a stream), thinking of how my sisters and cousins played in a brook when we were kids. Again, not sure if I was fooling myself or what, but I did stop and “play” in the water several times, with a smile on my face.
I have one little tidbit for my musician friends and family members: When I walk with my trekking poles, the rhythm of the poles is almost never in sync with my feet. They aren’t even syncopated. My feet simply go at a different rate than my arms. Mom would be shocked.
Eventually we got to a road and a 1/2 mile road walk to the Top of Georgia Hostel, apparently one of the  bigger and more well-known hostels on the trail. We were soaked to the core by the time we got there. The crew there was clearly ready for us and came outside to tell us to drop our packs, take off our shoes and come inside and get some coffee or hot chocolate. That was a pretty neat feeling. Like we were important and they knew exactly what we were going thru. Which was true because they had all thru-hiked the AT previously. It got a little uncomfortable for me when we went to the bunkhouse. There were about 9 other guys there already. They were all sitting around chatting with each other about gear, how far to hike, how much their food resupply weighed. They were comfortable, at-ease, and not the least nervous. I don’t recall them even complaining about the rain. They were just hikers, some for the second or third time. And there I was, freaking out on the inside. Listening to them all talk so confidently, so calmly did nothing to calm me down. I still cannot pin down why but the next morning in my bunk, at I’d guess 3 or 4AM, in the nice safe, warm environment of the bunkhouse, I had a huge panic attack while lying under my quilt, shaking, my mind spinning with a million thoughts and feelings, just hours before I was to return to trail. That, it turned out, didn’t happen.","

Two Tents,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607460,"I have what may at first seem to be sad news. I have ended my adventure. This comes with a whole pile of mixed emotions, including my feeling the need to sincerely, deeply apologize to all those who have been involved in this debacle. I will try to explain in this post what happened and all the emotions and complex feelings of the last 16 days -and a year of gear shopping.
As you all know by now, I have wanted to hike the AT since I was a teenager. Back then I loved the feeling of being outside hiking with not a care in the world, completely independent, with everything I needed on my back. I remember those feelings clearly. I could not wait to get back out there and do it again. But those feelings did not return on this hike. There was no passion, no feeling of freedom. Soon after starting, I found I was nothing but nearly constantly nervous and anxious. I had at least 3 panic attacks in those 16 days. I still have not figured out why, but the feeling of anxiety, especially when not actually hiking, never left me. The reason why my ending this hike is not necessarily bad news is that I have taken the short impactful experience of walking roughly 75 miles (and the 30 hour bus ride home - more on that later) as a way to give myself a huge kick in the ass, have a good-ole midlife crisis, and make some significant changes to how I live, what my priorities are, and how I treat myself and others.
As for the anxiety and panic attacks, I’m guessing one cause may have been the overnight change from couch potato to long distance hiker and being completely on my own, combined with no passion for hiking. The problem was, there is some evidence that a panic attack with high blood can cause a heart attack. The last morning in the hostel I could tell my blood pressure was thru the roof. Not good.
Being an engineer, I can’t resist explaining one of my favorite frequently misunderstood analytical tools: Risk. Risk is likelihood times severity. The risk of something happening (a heart attack) is the likelihood (probably low, but inconclusive data) times the severity (almost certain death if it happened on the trail near the top of a mountain). In hindsight, my intuition told me to stop hiking. The risk was too high. At the time I didn’t do all this analysis, but now I believe strongly that is what happened. I got up from my bunk after shaking for hours and told Yet2b that I was ending my hike. At the time I wasn’t sure why, but now I am. It would be too risky to go on while having panic attacks, regardless of the cause of the attacks. Yes I would eventually get over them, but the risk was too high.
I intended to do this hike for myself. I had a whole list of reasons for doing it. But then it grew to include other people and started to feel like it wasn’t just for me, or about me. But at the same time I felt it was too selfish to make it be just for me. I created a catch 22 in my head of self-imposed responsibility to others who were (in my head) counting on me to finish. I couldn’t let that go and make it just for me -too selfish. That swirl of feelings may have been another cause of the panic attacks. They certainly didn’t help. I had these crazy thoughts while the panic attacks were happening. What is selfishness? When is it too much? We must all do things for ourselves, but how much? How altruistic can we be without losing ourselves? Unfortunately I don’t have answers to these questions.
Then the problem is how far do I go before deciding to quit? Given the panic attacks, I likened it to this: when you are on a hill and you lose the brakes in your car, when is the best time to jump? Right Away. So I did. I had nothing to prove that was worth the risk and in fact I had already proven to myself some very important lessons. I can make myself keep putting one foot in front of the other even with an excruciating cramp in my neck, in a downpour, on slippery leaves and rocks. I can make myself walk along the edge of a steep slope that, when I looked down, terrified me. I can make myself get dressed when it’s 31 degrees and 100% humidity (tho I often put on the wrong clothes). I can deal with constant diarrhea in the rain. No fun, but I can hack it. And most importantly, again in hindsight, I realized that my passion is and has always been ... wait for it ... music. While I was hiking I found myself singing instrumental tunes and imagining playing in front of an audience. So I intend to do just that. And, surprising to some, I also have a passion for analysing social interactions. (Where did THAT come from?) I loved listening to groups of people talking, figuring out why they respond the way they do, what their life experiences were, etc. etc. I’m going to study this and maybe even write something about it someday.
To be clear, all my reasons for attempting the hike still hold and need to be addressed. I have decided to finish some long-wanting projects, and to get back into music as a way of addressing some of those reasons. (Thanks, Kathy!)
I love hiking. I love the scenery, the birds, the rain, walking in intense fog, the vistas, walking in the water when the trail was a stream, playing with the flow of the streams, seeing so many water springs, some constant, some there only because of all the rain, many coming out from under trees, and I loved the scary incredibly steep slopes along and across the trail. I enjoyed all the walking, chugging slowly up challenging hills, yes the rain caused some unnecessary problems but only because of my inexperience, and I liked hiking with others -when it was just one-on-one. I will always enjoy hiking and hope to do some section hikes in the future.
I have to thank all those who texted me notes of support, including Colleen and many others at RightHand Robotics, my sister-in-law Tia and bestie Katie, and especially my friends Max and Jess who, without hesitation drove 2 hours to pick me up and let me stay in their house for several days as I pondered what to do. Thank you all so much. I am overwhelmed by the support and interest, and again I am truly sorry this crazy adventure ended so abruptly after subjecting so many people to my incessant jabbering about gear and hiking. Most of all a huge thank you to my wife and sons who supported me from the very beginning. I have let you down and I promise to make it up to you in ways that are more than just words.
Love to all,TwoTents aka Paul Sandin 
Addendum:When I was figuring out how to get home, I decided just for fun to compare flight costs with taking a bus. The bus was just a little cheaper, but the bus station was much closer than the airport so Max and Jess would not have to drive as far. I also figured the long bus ride would give me loads of time to think about the last 16 days and what, exactly, happened. The bus trip would take 30 hours from 9AM TU to 3PM WE. The trip turned out to be far more entertaining in ways that were completely unexpected. Here are some highlights.
I am one of those “talkers” on a bus. I try to strike up conversations with whomever is around. On this trip, I mostly failed. I talked a little to a few people, but never for more than a sentence or two. Over 30 hours not a single long-ish conversation.In the bus station in Philly, people of color outnumbered us pale-faces 10 to 1. I have never been in such a situation. At one point, after getting some food, a black kid called me over as I was looking for a place to sit, saying “Come on over, I’ve no problem with an older brother.” (He turned out to be one of the PIAs in the “Karma” story below.)One time while standing in line waiting to get on a bus, the person behind me complained about someone cutting in line ahead of us, then he cut in front of me.
KARMA: Our bus was cool but not cold. The heater was clearly struggling for some reason. At one point rather suddenly, a couple of younger people yelled “turn up the heat” and “at least turn off the AC”, rudely waking everyone on the bus, and rightly pissing off the driver. When we got to a rest area, the driver called her supervisor about the heat not working, which lead to an order to get a new bus. This of course would cause a delay, which the complainers then complained about. A second bus pulled up also going to NYC, and the kids who had yelled so rudely thought that bus would get them there sooner, so they changed buses telling us they were going to beat us to NYC. When they got off, everyone on our bus decided to push on to NYC in our old bus in spite of the cold. We left the rest stop 20 minutes before the other bus. The heater started working on the way and we had a pleasant quiet trip.
I hope this finds you healthy and happy.

Two Tents,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608766,"I understand this is all a bit weird, but I have decided to give this another try. I will be going back on the trail about 300 miles up from where I left, at a road crossing known as Sam's Gap on Interstate 26 in NC. This was chosen mostly because it is close to friends who will be giving me a ride, and also to stay at least a little ahead of ""the bubble"", but I expect there to be many more hikers on the trail where I start.
Several things will be different:
Gear changes: waterproof, tougher, simpler backpack; Pacer Pole trekking poles with angled form fitting handles; tougher rain jacket; swapping insulated vest, button down polyester shirt, and the lightweight merino tee for the heavy merino wool tee and  lightweight fleece. The goal of these changes is to reduce stressing out about damaging the pack and rain jacket, more comfort walking, and simpler lighter clothes.I'm hoping knowledge of the reasons behind the panic attacks will help me deal with them and/or mitigate them.I will not be replying to supporters' texts, which will hopefully reduce stress caused by my phone. I will still appreciate all the words of support, tho'!I'm going to try much harder to not be so affected by perceived judgement by others.I'm going to eat more, and eat more protein.

Printer broke at library, delaying us leaving for the airport.
Couldn’t find cheap parking lot at the airport.
Didn’t pack enough ice packs for my wife, a failure of mine that I sincerely apologize for.

Extremely detailed explanation of how to open the windows and hatches in case of emergency. He turned out to be a horrible driver.
Arrived at Port Authority station at 9:30PM., my bus was supposed to board at 10:10.



Around 11pm an announcement that there was no driver and no idea when the bus would leave.
Eventually it was announced the next driver would arrive at 6AM.
People started figuring out how and where to spend the night and try to sleep. Stretching out on the floor, chairs, benches. Bodies everywhere. Police arrived and the news was passed around that we all had to leave the station! Then they changed their minds when they realized kicking 75 people out into the cold was probably not a good idea.



I sat in the front right seat. She moved back a row saying there was more leg room. I moved across my favorite seat. She was right, it had limited leg room. I moved across and back to row 2. That seat had something hard, I laughed at this and she said something I again didn’t hear but it was clear she was cool with me sitting next to her, so I moved again and figured out why I didn’t understand her, she had an unplaceable accent. I eventually found out she was from Haiti and spoke 4 languages. She was sweet and easy to chat with. So after a long night of little sleep I ended up sitting next to an angel.
We all had to change tickets in Richmond to deal with the  delayed arrival. The kind person behind the counter neglected to note how the change in our schedules would affect what would happen when we got to Raleigh Durham. After another long wait for a bus (the driver was there but no bus), and a pleasant dinner in the only eatery in the station, we got on the bus to Raleigh Durham NC.This station is small and the two TVs were on all night while all tried again to sleep. Everyone else’s bus came at 6AM, mine was not to arrive until 10:30. I spent the next 4 hours completely alone in the station. My bus came, there was some confusion about my ticket, but they let me on and after 4 more hours, my friend picked me up in Hickory. 
I had left our condo at 11 on Thursday. Arrived at my destination at 2:30 on Saturday. 


I’m thinking the few hundred dollars saved by taking the bus over a plane was not worth it.",,View Entry,"Apr 07, Sun",0
Two Tents,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610267,"I restarted at Sams gap on April 7th, in the company of a close friend. This start felt much less dramatic which has seemed to help. He walked with me for over 2 hours, we had lunch on a big log, and then he said goodbye and I was off again.
I encountered several hikers on my way up to Big Bald, including hiking the last mile or so with the amazing Raven, a 20 year old who looks and acts 25  (no offense!). She kept my head clear and made the climb go fast. The view at the top was overwhelming.

Hiking with kids allows me to be more myself, slightly apart from the group and sometimes silly. This separateness yet friendliness is harder to find with the older crowd. This is all a sign that I am still consumed by what I perceive others think of me. 
I frequently yell at myself on the trail when I catch myself comparing my hike, gear, pace, etc to others. This is MY hike! For ME! I will go at my ownpace, my gear is what I need.
I decided to stay at the Greasy Creek Friendly hostel, without realizing it is .9 miles off the trail down a long hill. That is where I am right now. It has been a very interesting time here. 

I am sitting in their living room with two other hikers, waiting for the weather to clear and for a slight pain in the bottom of my right foot to subside before...
Starting the climb up Roan MT, 3000 feet up from the hostel! The longest climb I have ever done other than MT Washington. I am frankly quite concerned about this climb, but at the same time have some confidence gained from the climbs I didd this week.
I can see the mountain from the hostel and choke up when I look at it. Not sure why. May be because I am actually going to do it, tackle the fear straight on.
I had a great conversation with Nickle here in Greasy Creek Friendly, very helpful, so calm. He is a multi-thru hiker who gave me lots of helpful tips, and at the same time, confidence.","Sam’s Gap

Two Tents,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610978,"What a time the last two weeks have been. I restarted at Sam's Gap, with my buddy Max walking with me part way up to Big Bald. The whole feeling was quite different this time. Much less expectation, lower stress, mostly clear skies. We had lunch on a big log, diarrhea struck again, then we said our goodbyes and I walked off. I hadn't gotten very far when I caught up to a young woman named Raven, 20 years old, trying to do the trail on a very tight budget. We did the long climb up to the top o Big Bald together and her company really helped. She was excited for me to see -for the first time- a complete 360 deg. view at the top. Several others were already there and everyone seemed to know everyone, all in their 20's I'd guess. Happy Dance, who along with Raven I would hike with and/or see several times over the next few weeks. I owe them a debt for their kind patience listening to me complain, offering support and encouragement. It gave my restart a big boost. Thanks guys!
Thanks also to Andrew at RightHand for researching Plantar Fasciitis which I thought I was getting. It wasn't. Just one of many more temporary pains in my feet. Thanks also to Sunkist and Goat -both just a little older than me- who I met at the wonderful Roan Mountain B&B. We hiked together all last week, doing far more miles than either they or I had ever done per day. They too -especially Sunkist- had to listen to me complaining/talking about how my brain was all screwy. Thanks!
First a list, then on to emotions and thoughts.
My backpack really is totally waterproof! The outer pocket's zipper leaks as expected, but the main bag keeps everything completely dry. Why aren't all backpacks waterproof?!?The first hostel I stayed at is called the Greasy Creek Friendly. It is easily the most unusual place I have ever visited, let alone stayed at for 2 days. I mean nothing disparaging about it. CeeCee is a wonderfully polite, friendly, helpful host. The hostel is her 4 room house plus some other bunkhouses. I stayed in the bedroom in the house. You actually live in their house with them. She cooks meals, we all watched TV in their living room. It was great. And the night, 3 meal plus snacks and drinks over 2 days, cost ~$70.00!
I stayed at the Roan MT B&B just after the harshest waterproof test one could think of. Otherwise I would have continued on and not met Sunkist and Goat.The second bald I walked over was gloriously sunny. I had a huge craving for tuna fish and wolfed down a packet in seconds, chatted with some day hikers, then marched on to the most exciting and thrilling thing I have ever experienced:I carry a weather instrument that measures temp, wind speed, and humidity. It is easily accessed in my waist pack. As I was walking up the second bald, the wind picked up, then the rain, and then blowing fog similar to what happens on Mt Washington! The wind was pounding the rain into my rain jacket. The noise of the pelting rain on my right ear was deafening. I took out the weather instrument: 45mph gusts (higher right when I stopped measuring -50mph?), 100% humidity, 50 degrees, rain. I was wearing thin nylon pants which helped even tho' they completely wetted out, a Woolx short sleeve Merino wool Tee, and a Columbia Outdry rain jacket. Every piece of gear worked perfectly. As long as I kept moving I stayed comfortably cool and didn't sweat. My Tee shirt and the inside of my pack were both completely dry at the end of the day. Absolutely incredible. When I got to the top of the highest one I tried to let out a great yell in excitement, but what came out was the worst ""CROAK"" ever. My throat was just worn out from breathing so hard. It was unsatisfying and funny at the same time.A few days later while hiking with Sunkist and Goat, we decided to do a 13 mile day that would end with a monster climb. Make note: This was the hardest physical thing I have ever done. I am tearing up remembering it. The climb was 1600 feet up over 3 walking miles, after already hiking 10 miles. It was hot, steep, exposed to the sun, rocky, and utterly exhausting. I stopped several times and could tell I was getting in that frame of mind where thinking clearly starts to decay. Decisions must be made more slowly and deliberately, taking smaller steps, drinking water constantly. When I finally got to camp, all 4 of my new friends happened to be there waiting for me: Sunkist, Goat, Raven, and Happy Dance. I was too exhausted to say anything, but slowly my head cleared and I chatted a bit, set up my tent, ate, and slept.
I figured out the reason hikers carry a ""puffy"" all the time is to stay warm right when you get out of your bag of quilt, even if the morning temps are warm. I put it on, even for just a few minutes while getting things ready, then pack it away.Dirt, that thing that was fun to play in and nothing to consider when you are a kid, is now the great frenemy. Comfortable to sit on, essentially everywhere, and gets everything brown. --and worst of all: contains ticks.
I almost black out every time I stand up right when I get to camp. I squat down to set up my tent, stand up, and then woah!!! Don't fall over! I've gotten used to it, and of course the remedy is to not stand up so fast, or to take a break before setting up camp.I also have a scary hot flash every morning about 1/2 hour after waking up. It has happened so often that I can sometimes say to myself ""just wait a second, it will pass"" even tho' I feel like it is the beginning of some illness ... every ... time ... it happens.
I've seen all kinds of shelter construction types, but the coolest are those built of notched logs just like the original log cabins were built. At least one I saw must have been 150 years old. So cool to see the ""real thing"".
Certain parts of hiking become very routine. Not sure if that's good or bad.This last week my digestive system has worked better than it has in the last 5 years. So convenient to be able to get up, pee and poop, and be done for the day.

Why is this time out so different? I feel better. Actually, I actually feel this time. I take the time to look around and really soak in the experience. My therapist and I decided that a good way to deal with, and maybe control the crazy, racing, circular, stressful thoughts is to think of them as separate from ""me"". They are there, but they are not me. I detect they are taking over, yell at myself that they are not me, and try think about other things. So far this seems to work.

My digestive system has improved but still just as we were getting ready to leave the Roan MT B&B I had a diarrhea attack. Knowing I was going to hike with Sunkist and Goat I think helped.

While walking between the balds, the trail was like a muddy skating rink. I fell twice, twisting my left leg then my left hip, and slipped an uncountable number of times. I found myself yelling in anger at being so stupid and forgetting it was SLIPPERY.
I have also started to yell, like really yell out loud, when my brain starts to swirl around and doubting, feeling scared, etc., telling myself to STOP IT. This is MY hike, I am going to keep walking. That's all. No doubting, no thoughts of giving up allowed!
I think that some of the sleeplessness and anxiety is caused by genuine fear. I reread my ""why hike the AT"" list and it actually says ""get over my fear of the woods"". Logically I know there is no real danger, but I still feel fear in my tent. I think I have masked it from myself, but it is actually there. That should go away as I get more experience and hang around other more laid-back hikers.
Of course, this all sounds very positive. But will it continue? Will I actually keep walking ? I don't know. Tomorrow morning will be a big test of that. I so hope I can keep my brain in check. I really really love to walk, to push myself, to just be in the woods. Until next time. I hope this post finds you peaceful and content.","Sam's Gap NC

Written on phone. Excuse weird formatting.
Wood thrush right next to tent 
Grayson Highlands Ponies 
Springs everywhere in weird forest 
I walked 17 miles in one day. Amazing.
Walked with Ridge Runner for a bit. She was FAST.
Trimpi shelter is stone and concrete, need to look up history. Talked with some trail maintainers.
Chatfield Memorial Shelter is where I crossed 300 miles!
I am still concerned about this adventure/challenge financial cost.
I have been enjoying thinking about autonomous wheel barrow and its potential to be a financial success.
High wind last week cocooned in tent? I don't remember if I talked about this event yet, but one place that I camped the wind blew so hard I thought the tent would come apart, so I took down the single pole, leaving all the guylines  anchored and wrapped up in the tent, with all my other gear packed in my pack so I could make a quick exit if the tent ripped. I lay there for 4 hours until daylight, then packed the tent and started walking again. Very exciting!
Snake bit my shorts! Then I saw another snake 20 minutes later!
Still yelling at myself that this is MY hike, and to stop comparing myself to other hikers, mostly about how fast they walk and how many miles they hike per day. STOP THAT!!!
A bunch of kids and I had a pizza party at the Partnership Shelter, one of 2 shelters that you can have pizza delivered. It was one of the best times on the trail so far. Then I walked with Cheese, a teacher, for most of the day. We visited the tiny school house that had Trail Magic inside. All in all a great day. Thanks Cheese.
But I started that day with a panic attack when leaving the Partnership Shelter, walking to the trail. I called Betsy and just listening to her talk about her plans helped calm me down. Kathy left a voice mail which also helped. Chatting with Vicky while on the top of the first climb was wonderful. Thanks to all of you!
I brought a Pepsi with me on that climb, a bit weird but tasted so good. I was trying anything to ease the anxiety of getting back on the trail.
Many hikers take a lot of ibuprofen and/or weed constantly. I would rather feel the aches and pains and not have what seems to me to be a sort of masked experience.
Lonely at Quarter Way Inn, disconnected from family and friends, but lots (12) other hikers at hostel, nearly all strangers, talking about hiking and related stuff, actually feels good, but I don’t really feel as much a part of the group as they all seem to.
I miss the new puppy at home. I feel kinda left out or something.
Some of the group are former thru hikers and are at once cocky and kind when asked nubie questions.

I don’t have any of those goals or mindset. I have a carefully crafted set of goals that I think about while hiking. I sometimes (noisily) work on them. That won’t get me to Maine, and I don’t think/feel that getting to Maine is instrumental in accomplishing my goals. Hmm...
Remember that I have HOURS to think all day every day. I am realizing I guess that getting to Maine not the kind of goal I need, want, or frankly, can afford.
Next post could of course be completely different!
Hope this finds you peaceful and content.

Two Tents,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612281,"Well well. Things have changed yet again. First the list, then details and reasons for a major change in plans.
I slept alone in the woods for the first time. It was actually pretty neat. Complete privacy, no real fear, I got up when I wanted without any influence from the sounds of others getting up -AND STILL COMPARING MYSELF TO THEM...!  Argh.I walked with a group for a day or two, we seemed to get along very well, but then I got ahead and they stayed behind at a shelter without my knowing it. So I was on my own again. Kinda' cool, even if sometimes lonely. But the loneliness was not really a bad thing.I knew that some of the kids I had met over the last weeks were going to Dismal Falls to swim. The falls are .3 miles off the trail, just at the edge of too far, but I went anyway. One of the best decisisions I have made. They were all there, playing in the water, jumping off rocks, freezing our sore feet. It was a wonderful 1/2 hour.A little peak into my change in plans: Hiking the AT is physically far more demanding than I expected. This was not made clear in any of the books I read or videos I watched, or I ignored it. The uphills are sometimes so steep and long and I always seemed to be huffing and puffing more than other's did. I just got never got an improvement in cardiovascular ability. My legs and feet quickly got strong and tough, but I was always out of breath. Sometimes my stride would be a foot or less, trying to keep the steps per minute up (which really does help). This was disappointing. I could keep going for an hour or more, but only with much will power and effort -sometimes almost to the point of passing out.Then ... I saw the most beautiful bird I've ever seen in the wild. Fire engine red body with black wings. For some reason -I'd never done this before- I instantly called my sister Kathy to ask her what it was. ""Probably a Scarlet Tanager"" she said. We ended up talking while I hiked, for may 20 minutes. It was so cool to hike and talk about the woods, what I was seeing, the fact that I had run out of water and was a tad concerned about that. It was neat.I've realized, or perhaps confirmed, that there are advantages and disadvantages to hiking with kids vs adults. The adults are more inclusive but less interested in forming a Tramily, and easier to talk to about my emotional challenges; kids are far more entertaining, spontaneous, just plain fun, but I can't really be ""included"".I met Dash, a woman was I think said she is 65 years old. She gave me 2 bits of advice that really made me think. One, that she is not out to have fun. Her hike was an adventure. It may have fun parts, but that was not important. Two: she was the first one to suggest to me that I could skip around on the trail rather than hike ""thru"". This turned out to be a revelation. More on this later.Not everybody, but most -especially the older crowd- are competitive. Even if they try not to be, it is in their comments and tone when they talk about how far they walked, how fast they walk, etc. This has made me even more keen on being uncompetitive, trying to be myself without regard to how I perceive others or how I think they perceive/judge me.Around 10-11Am every morning in the toughest time for me to keep going. I just want to end it right at the next road crossing. Then in the afternoon I get all fired up and walk with gusto and think I can walk forever. Which lead me to this:
I just left the Woods Hole Hostel. My stay there could almost be called life changing. The place was packed, more than 20 people from all walks of life, and all thoughts/feelings about hiking. Dash was there, along with many of the kids I had hiked with, and a4 veterans. As we talked and got to know each other, and talked -as usual- about hiking, I got more and more comfortable with making a major change to my hiking plans.
I have decided, on a bright sunny day, that I don't need to hike the whole trail, nor even hike continuously until I choose to get off the Trail. Rather, I can jump ahead and hike the parts I've always wanted to hike, and make the whole adventure much shorter. I haven't worked out the details yet, but so far I plan to jump ahead to just south of Harper's Ferry, hike into that town and stay a few days (the headquarters of the ATC is there), then hike out; then figure out where to hike next or maybe a couple more stretches, then go home. There is actually a name of this: LASH, Long Ass Section Hiker.
I will post again with more plans and details when I can get to a computer, hopefully in Harper's Ferry!
I hope this post finds you peaceful and content. More news to come as I continue to learn and figure out things about myself.
p.s. I will be staying in a church-based hostel tonight almost certainly by myself. It is honor based, and has no proprietor. Just a building in town with a floor to sleep on. It will be an interesting experience for sure.","
