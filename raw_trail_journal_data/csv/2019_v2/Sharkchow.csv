Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609269,"This Appalachian Trail journal is meant to be a collaborative effort with my beautiful and talented wife, Linda (AKA Mrs. Sharkchow).
The plan is that I will be in daily cell phone contact with Linda to fill her in on my location, plans, and details of that day's happenings. She will then post an update to the journal. During some periods I may be outside cell phone range. In that case and update will be made as soon as possible. Posts made by Linda will be signed by her (Mrs. Sharkchow), and posts by me will be signed by me. 
Feel free to send any comments, thoughts, advice, or questions. We'll try to respond when we can.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609270,"Every year in late winter or early spring, I would visit this website to try to find someone to follow as they hiked the Appalachian Trail. Even though I wasn't myself on the trail, it gave me a daily dose of trail life -- a small respite from work and ""civilized"" city life. At some point during these accounts, the author would come upon someone on or near the trail offering food and cold drinks to hikers. In some particularly dry sections of the trail, containers of drinking water are left near the trail in anticipation of thirsty hikers headed that way.
These folks are called trail angels, and the gifts they bestow are known as trail magic. 
This is one of the reasons I want to hike the Appalachian Trail. Not to get free food. Hopefully, I'll have my act together enough that I won't have to rely on a chance encounter with trail magic to avoid hunger or thirst. But I like the idea that so many people -- many of whom have completed thru hikes of their own -- take time off from their lives to return to the AT to give something back.
Folks say that hiking the AT is a life-changing experience. I guess I'm about to find out. But that must be some pretty powerful magic to have such a hold on hikers long after their time walking the trail has ended.
It seems to me the AT is something more than just a footpath from Georgia to Maine. It is an entire community of like-minded folks drawn to something challenging and rewarding. You can't just sign up for this. You have to prove yourself worthy. Day after day with each additional mile, you earn your way into that community.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609271,"“And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece.”   Luke 9:3
I always considered Ray Jardine the pioneer of ultra-light trekking. But apparently Jesus had something important to say about long-distance travel as well. 
In my preparation for life on the AT I’ve been borrowing a bit of wisdom from both, but will likely end up carrying more than I should nonetheless. There will be plenty of time to tweak what’s in my pack. The weight on my back after each passing mile will provide ample incentive to get the load as light as possible. 
I’ve found experience is the best way to trim extra pounds from my pack. Experience isn’t thinking of all the stuff I might need out in the woods – that technique would fill a moving van. The trick is knowing that the few essential things I’m bringing will get the job done.
To be clear, I don’t consider myself an ultra-light backpacker. My base weight will likely be between 18 and 20 pounds without food or water. That isn’t great, but it will get me started walking north.
As for the Big Three, my pack is a ULA Catalyst. I’ll be sleeping in a Hennessy Hammock under a Hammock Gear Dyneema tarp. And I’ll be wrapped in a 20-degree Enlightened Equipment Enigma quilt.
I do not consider myself a gear head. But I do believe there is wisdom in the words of both Ray Jardine and The Bible. It boils down to three words: Less Is More.Sharkchow",,View Entry,"Mar 29, Fri",0
Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609272,"In the last few weeks I've found myself in the aisles in the grocery section at Walmart taking notes. There are several places along the AT where a Walmart will provide the best resupply option. I want to be able to walk into the store and go directly to the places on the shelves to find the food I need.
To speed the process I keep a grocery list on my cell phone. Among the items: tortillas, tuna packs, Knorr rice sides, peanut butter, Snickers bars. I like to tell myself that I'll linger in the fresh produce section and stock up on carrots and kale. We'll see.
In some places, the only available resupply is at a gas station. It will be interesting to see how that goes. In other places, like Hot Springs, North Carolina, and Damascus, Virginia, the trail takes hikers right through the center of town. Most trail towns are five to ten miles from the AT. My pre-hike rule is that if it is within a mile, I'll walk to town. Anything longer and I'll either hire a hiker shuttle service or hitchhike. For the record, it has been about 43 years since I last stuck my thumb out to hitch a free ride somewhere. They say the folks in trail towns are friendly and understand the whole thru-hiker experience. But after a few weeks on the trail I'll have a pretty good idea of how I'll look... and smell.

Day Two (today), 13 miles hiked, he will sleep in his hammock tonite. It rained all morning - and he loved it: “It was fantastic hiking in the rain!” says Sharkchow. Poncho and rain skirt worked well.
This morning, about 4 miles in, a guy burst onto the trail and announced “trail magic!” - hot dogs and other treats. Sharkchow skipped the dogs, but went for grapefruit juice, fruit, and hot chocolate. Thank you, Trail Magic Guy! 
Sharkchow didn’t have a whole lot of time to train before starting the hike, so I’ve been counseling him to take it easy. Train as you go. This is not a race! Tomorrow or the next day, he’ll hit a trail town. He says he’s “sore but moving… If I have a good day tomorrow, I’ll put in more miles.”

Sharkchow made it past the famous “boot tree” at Neel Gap, where supposedly 20 percent of AT “starters” drop out (after a mere 31.7 miles on the trail). The tradition is, take off your boots, fling ‘em into the tree, and call it a day. But not Sharkchow. Now he’s at the Mountain Crossings hostel at Neel Gap. Rinsed out his clothes, did some resupply at the store (plus fresh fruit and OJ for immediate consumption), took a hot shower.
Last night Sharkchow slept in his hammock, which he says was “fantastic.” Fell asleep at 8:30 pm. He sleeps better in the hammock - woke up ready to go, not sore. Tonight he’ll sleep in the basement hostel, where the bunk room smells ""abysmal."" “But it doesn’t bother me,"" he says. ""You kind of adapt.”
Plans to hike just 10 miles a day the next few days. “It will take a few weeks or a month to get up to speed.”

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609834,"Sharkchow hiked 11.5 miles today. The hostel last night at Mountain Crossings (Neel Gap) was indeed stinky, but the hot shower alone was worth the $20 it cost to stay there, he said. Tonight, back to the hammock near Low Gap Shelter. (See picture - the hammock is under the tarp!) It's supposed to rain tonight, and all day tomorrow, but Sharkchow is fine with that. The tarp will keep him dry tonight, and he's got rain gear for the hike. 
Aiming for another 11-mile day tomorrow. He doesn't want to overdo it.

Resupply! All you can eat dinner! Those are the headlines out of Hiawassee, Georgia, where Sharkchow is bunking down for the night. He hiked 11 miles today, from Tray Mountain Shelter to Dicks Creek Gap. From there, a van picks up hikers and takes them to the Top of Georgia Hostel in Hiawassee. From there, hikers head to Daniel's Steakhouse for the all you can eat buffet. Cost: $8. Really. 
""It was very southern, very fried,"" says Sharkchow. Pork and chicken, plus salad bar with fresh lettuce and veggies, including beets. 
He was sadly misinformed about breakfast at Top of Georgia - it's all you can eat cold cereal, not pancakes. :( But it'll do. Then the van takes hikers back to the trail.
Sharkchow is still trying to get the weight of his pack down (starting weight was 26 pounds, he says, not 27), and so he gave away his jar of peanut butter. Up next: Three-day hike to Franklin, NC.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610124,"Today, some firsts: Sharkchow crossed his first state line, from Georgia into NC. Later, after arriving at Muskrat Creek Shelter, he hung his first bear bag. So his food is up in a tree, and his backpack is tied to one of the trees where his hammock is.
The breakfast buffet of cold cereal at the Top of Georgia hostel sounded … underwhelming. But it was something. While hiking, he then had a bagel, then 2 poptarts, then beef jerky. At Muskrat Creek Shelter, he made a backpacker meal - a “3-person serving,” but he could have eaten more. 
After nearly a week on the trail, I asked Sharkchow if he had gotten into a rhythm. He paused. “Sort of. I’m still fully in training mode,” he says. “You can feel your body adjusting.” 
Here’s a tidbit from yesterday’s all-you-can-eat buffet in Hiawassee: Sharkchow ate with two other hikers, one an 80-year-old (!) man from South Africa (who has hiked the AT 2-3 times before) and a talkative woman named Wonder Woman. 
She came to the table with her plate piled high, put it down and photographed it. Must be a millennial.

Now he's at Baltimore Jack's Hiker Hostel, where he'll spend the night for $20. Dinner was a hoot. He and a bunch of other hikers went to a restaurant where, if you can eat their triple-decker hamburger - the El Dorado - in 45 minutes, they'll put your picture on the wall and give you a T-shirt from the restaurant. A guy from Kansas - trail name Toto, of course - took the plunge. And he did it. He consumed the El Dorado (the equivalent of 6 hamburgers) and a pound of fries in under 45 minutes. Sharkchow ate just one hamburger and was still full. Toto is now Toto Frodo. As Sharkchow and I were talking, Todo Frodo ambled by and gave an update: After dinner, he went to the Lazy Hiker Brewery for some beer and ice cream.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610375,"Day 10 began with an all-you-can-eat pancake and bacon breakfast at First Baptist Church, Franklin, NC. This is their famous “hiker breakfast,” which they do between mid-March and mid-April, a tradition since 2008. It's just for thru-hikers, free of charge. Sharkchow says there were 40-50 hikers there - including Toto, who seemed to have recovered from last night’s triple-decker cheeseburger, fries, beer, and ice cream.
Tonight, Sharkchow is in his hammock, near Cold Spring Shelter, after hiking 15.8 miles. “It was the perfect day for hiking,” he says - and for a wedding, which he happened upon as he walked by the Wayah Bald outlook. 
Sharkchow is getting a kick out of the place names - like Swinging Lick Gap. Who’s thinking this stuff up? he wonders.
He called kind of late, because he was at a campfire organized by a young couple - thru-hikers from Texas. A guy and a girl in their 20s who had sold everything and hit the trail. Nice.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610479,"Day 11 was payback for Day 10’s perfect weather. Overnight, there was torrential rain and high wind, maybe even the remnants of a tornado, Sharkchow said.  
“There were times when I thought the whole hammock would blow away,” he said. But it didn’t. Through it all, he stayed dry. 
This morning, one hour into the hike, more rain - intense rain, winds gusting to 60 MPH, trees down, branches flying. Sharkchow soldiered on, and hiked down to the Nantahala River and the Nantahala Outdoor Center. There, the skies cleared and it was beautiful and sunny. He thought about staying there, but the room was expensive.
Then Sharkchow saw a guy he recognized from the night before - trail name Montana Jesus - and the two of them decided to walk to the next shelter, more than 6 miles away. About a quarter mile in, it starts raining. And this time, there’s thunder and lightning, and branches flying. They see a tree come crashing down, right near them. 
Sharkchow and Montana Jesus arrived at Sassafras Gap Shelter just as daylight was disappearing. No dinner, straight to “bed.” Sharkchow called from inside his hammock, where he was warming up. It was his longest day yet - 18.9 miles. 
Why was the other guy named Montana Jesus? I asked. “Because he’s from Montana and he looks like Jesus,” Sharkchow said. Of course. Maybe he also kept them safe.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610640,"Day 13: Today was easy - a 5.5 mile hike to the jumping-off point for picturesque Fontana Village Resort in Fontana Dam, NC. Special room rate for thru-hikers: $79. The place is crawling with them. Sharkchow was eating dinner in the restaurant, and a nice older couple (thru-hikers) from Ashville, NC, walked up and said, “You look like a thru-hiker.” So they joined him. Maybe it was that lean and hungry look, though in fact he’s not all that hungry. “Hiker hunger” hasn’t kicked in yet.
Last Saturday I had sent Sharkchow a resupply package full of backpacker meals, Snickers, Cheezits, beef jerky, and some crumpled up pages of the New York Times, and it got to the hotel yesterday. Tomorrow he’ll venture into the great unknown - across the dam and into Great Smoky Mountains National Park, where at some point he’ll cross into Tennessee. Who knows when we’ll hear from him again. It could be days. 
Bad weather is predicted for Friday. And on Saturday it might snow. He’s hoping to get over Clingmans Dome - the highest point in the park at 6,643 feet - before the snow. 
Sharkchow has also started using his little transistor radio. “I’m becoming an expert on country music,” he says. “It’s the only reliable station out here.”

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610713,"Day 14: First day in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and the hike was all uphill. 14.9 miles’ worth of uphill. It was a long slog. Sharkchow is tired. But at least the weather was beautiful as he walked right along the NC-Tennessee border - left foot in Tennessee, right foot in NC.
Early in the evening, Sharkchow sent Mrs. Sharkchow what she thought was a nice photo of trees - a “proof of life” picture, as it were, just in case he couldn’t make a call later. But he did call, and when I told him I liked the picture of trees, he said that’s not just a picture of trees. Look closer.
“The whole forest floor is blanketed with little white flowers,” he said. Why so it is. 
Sharkchow is bracing for the possibility of snow on Saturday. He’s now at Russell Field Shelter, almost 20 miles from Clingmans Dome - the highest point on the AT. He hopes to get over the mountain before snow hits. If he has to divert and go into Gatlinburg for a day or two, then so be it. 
Then I asked about bears. Sharkchow’s food is hanging from bear cables, and his pack is hanging from a tree. “The park has a lot of bears,” he says. “I hope we don’t get visited tonight.”
Sharkchow has seen evidence of bear(s) - things dug up, bear scat on the trail. A hiker said they saw a bear - but in the distance. Montana Jesus is also at the shelter. Good!","Fontana 28 AT Crossing

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610796,"News of the release of the Mueller report did reach as far as Great Smoky Mountains National Park, but for Sharkchow, there were far weightier concerns. Like, when will it start to snow? And will he have to divert into Gatlinburg, and maybe wind up at the Hampton Inn?
Tonight, Sharkchow is sleeping inside the Double Spring Gap Shelter, and not his beloved hammock, because of expected rain and high wind overnight. At about 7 pm, the wind was already at 25-30 MPH. Sleeping in shelter = sleeping shoulder-to-shoulder with a bunch of other (snoring, stinky) hikers on a hard floor. 
Last night, in the hammock, “was the absolute best sleep of the trip so far,” Sharkchow said. “I was sore when I went to bed, not sore when I got up.” 
Today, he hiked 16.4 miles. Tomorrow, it will be just a 3-mile hike to Clingmans Dome, the highest spot on the AT, then another 7 miles to Newfound Gap. From there, he’ll decide if he hitches a ride into Gatlinburg or keeps going. He would rather keep going. Mrs. Sharkchow","Russell Field Shelter

He hiked 14.4 miles today in rain and sleet over Clingmans Dome - at 6,644 feet, the highest point on the entire Appalachian Trail. But it wasn’t a day for hanging out and enjoying the view. Given the weather, I’m guessing there wasn’t much of a view.
At one point, “the trail became a raging torrent of water,” Sharkchow said (see photo). In other words, he was walking in a stream. He made it past Newfound Gap - the halfway point thru Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and the jumping off point for Gatlinburg. So no side excursion to Gatlinburg.

Staying put was “totally the right thing to do,” he said. Plus, he got to spend the day with the “Magnificent Seven” - 7 guys from Birmingham, Ala., who were on a three-day bachelor party hike into the Great Smokies and they too were hunkered down at Icewater Spring Shelter.
These guys brought a ton of food, and a big frying pan and a pot, plus axes and saws for firewood, all stuff that thru-hikers can’t possibly carry. So the Seven started a fire and just cooked and cooked. Biscuits, sausage, and cheese in a pot, plus hotdogs. The reviews are in: Delicious. 
The Magnificent Seven were also hilarious, though I’m afraid I don’t have any jokes to share. But you can imagine - seven guys from Alabama, and one of them is about to have a huge wedding (325 guests). 
They'll all be sleeping in the shelter again tonight, along with Montana Jesus, and then the party ends. The Magnificent Seven head back to Birmingham tomorrow, and Sharkchow will hit the trail.Addendum: Sharkchow wanted me to add that the cowboy campers/Magnificent Seven must have carried in about 70 pounds of food for a three-day visit, and they fed every hiker who poked their head into the shelter.

Sharkchow spent the day going downhill - 4,000 feet. He’s spending the night at Standing Bear Farm Hostel, just off the trail. It isn’t really a farm, he says, but it’s a “cool place,” which the internet says is in Hartford, Tenn. He's looking ahead to his next destination, Hot Springs, NC, which he expects is two and a half days away. There, he will do some resupply, and maybe spend the night in a hostel or maybe camp further down the trail. 
To Mrs. Sharkchow, who can only imagine what this trip is really like (despite her Girl Scout days of hiking and camping in New England), the best part is the people Sharkchow is meeting along the way. Like the section hiker he met named Pete. At some point, when Pete was asked for his trail name, he said “I’m Pete, just Pete.” Thus was born his trail name, Pete Just Pete. Pete is a young guy from Charlotte, married, who “just likes to hike,” says Sharkchow.

So here’s the headline: After three weeks on the trail, Sharkchow has lost 15 pounds. He knew upfront he’d lose weight, and packed a stretchy belt. So his shorts aren’t falling off. He also pre-positioned a smaller pair of shorts at our house in Washington, DC, where he will make a detour when he’s up this way. But honestly, he says, he could use them now - and thinks maybe they would also be too big.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611452,"Sharkchow hiked 11 miles today to Spring Mountain Shelter, in Greene County, Tenn. What about his trail buddies? I asked. “No Keys” just arrived, he said. Who? Here's where that trail name came from: When he went to hike the trail, he handed his keys to his wife and said, “No keys.” And it stuck.
I’ve also been thinking about the weight-loss thing. As previously reported, Sharkchow lost 15 pounds in 21 days of hiking - but don’t worry, he’s doing great. In fact, he said, “everybody’s talking about how they’re losing weight.”
Then I did the math. If Sharkchow keeps losing weight at this rate, he will completely disappear in about 4.5 months. Haha, he said, that’s not happening. But he does need a smaller hip-belt for his backpack, which I have ordered. (At left is a shot of Sharkchow on Day 1 of his AT hike - a ""before"" picture.)
He also reports that he slept great last night in the bunkhouse at Laughing Heart Lodge hostel: Nobody snored. Besides Sharkchow and No Keys, there were two other guys, Showstopper and Sassafras, and a Swedish woman named Caboose. Showstopper is a Brit who hikes in a kilt. We need pictures!

""It's like a bald spot on a mountain - no trees, just grass,"" he says. 
Monday morning he'll head into Erwin, Tenn., and will probably stay at Uncle Johnny's hostel. Time for another shower, resupply, laundry, restaurant meal. 
When we spoke, he was in a valley, and the cell connection was spotty. But it was the first time we had spoken in 3 days. Saturday night, Mrs. Sharkchow was in the basement of the Washington Hilton - at the White House Correspondents' Dinner with 2,600 of her closest friends - and couldn't get calls. Honestly, she couldn't even hear the person sitting next to her, the room was so noisy. But some beautiful mountain flower pictures came through. Mrs. Sharkchow","Hogback Ridge Shelter

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611905,"Sharkchow rolled into Erwin, Tenn., Monday morning, and headed straight for the all-you-can-eat pizza and salad bar. Lots of hikers in attendance. ""We were all lined up like homeless people,"" Sharkchow says.  
Dinner was penne pasta w/meat sauce (and salad) at an Italian restaurant. So it was a carbo-load kind of day. 
Next was Walmart - the gold standard for resupply on the AT. So Sharkchow is all set for the next five days. Here's what the daily menu looks like: 
Breakfast #1: bagel (2 bagels Tuesday to get pack weight down)
Breakfast #2: Poptarts
Lunch #1: trail mix w/extra M&Ms
Lunch #2:  beef jerky
Snack: Clif bars
Dinner: Mountain House dehydrated backpacker meal, available in the sporting goods dept at Walmart.
Loaded up with all this food, the pack will be extra heavy. So there's an incentive to front-load the eating.
Some thoughts from Sharkchow on AT hikers: It's a good little community of people who are friendly, generous, and kind. You don't really get that from the blogs, he says. ""Some of the nicest people in the world are here,"" he says. ""Everyone is sharing the same impossible goal of walking all that way."" 
And on the hiking itself: ""This is WAY more difficult than I thought it would be, both physically and mentally, but mostly physically. Age is part of it.""
Yesterday was quite difficult (20.8 miles, the longest day so far). He says his legs were wobbly when he got to camp. Today he sounded much happier. I asked if he ever just stops to enjoy the view, and he insisted he does. The river here is beautiful, he says. There are train tracks near the edge of the river, and then a rail bridge over the river. As we spoke, a train rumbled by and blew its whistle. 
Last night, he heard an owl ""making owl noises."" You mean it was saying ""who?"" I asked. ""Not quite,"" he said, ""but you know it's an owl."" He also recalled how, back in Georgia one night, a bunch of coyotes ""going nuts"" as soon as the sun went down, howling to each other - or maybe it was one coyote and its howls were echoing. ""It sounded like we were surrounded,"" he said. 
Now he's sleeping in his hammock at Uncle Johnny's Nolichucky Hostel, which is on the AT, at the edge of Erwin, Tenn. ""What's a nolichucky?"" I asked. Answer: That's the name of the river that runs in front of the hostel.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612019,"“Today, I walked and I ate,” says Sharkchow.
He hit the trail early, but not before eating 2 bananas and a cherry pie (a local version of Hostess). Then while walking, he ate two blueberry bagels, 2 blueberry Poptarts, a fistful of beef jerky, 7-10 handfuls of trail mix, and a backpacker meal for dinner. 
Aren’t you getting tired of those backpacker meals? I asked. “No, they’re actually delicious,” he said. “They just are. And they’re convenient.” 
About 8 miles into today’s 18.5-mile hike, Sharkchow hit trail magic. He had lemonade, but nothing else that was offered. He’s trying to eat up his food and lighten his pack. 
It was really hot out today - mid-80s in the mountains. And he climbed 4,000 (sweaty) feet. Then he hiked down 1,000 feet to get to Cherry Gap Shelter. 
Other highlights of the day: walking thru a dense spruce forest, very dark, with soft pine needles covering the forest floor. It would be a cool place to camp, he says, but there’s no water. Also cool: the tree on Unaka Mountain that someone decorated as a Christmas tree. 
The little tiny purple mountain flowers in the picture were near a place appropriately named Beauty Spot Gap.

That’s higher than Mt. Washington. Cell connection was spotty, so we didn’t talk long. For more on Roan High Knob, one of “America’s best huts,” according to Backpacker magazine, check this out.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612248,"Day 29: Sharkchow reports that today (Thursday) hiking in the Roan highlands was “spectacular” - one of the five best days of the trip so far. See menacing clouds in photo, the top of Hump Mountain… but he got off the mountain and down into the valley before he started hearing thunder - and then it started raining. Hump Mountain is just a big bald, he says.
“You’re up pretty high, then suddenly it’s just grass,” says Sharkchow. 
Thursday night he’s staying at a hostel half a mile east of the AT called The Station at 19E (19E being a road) in Roan Mountain, Tenn. The hostel is “very full,” he says. Maybe that’s because the lower level is a bar featuring a full menu of craft beers. Sharkchow headed straight to the local BBQ place (long line, full of locals) and pigged out, as it were: a large pulled pork platter with an extra bun, side of baked potato w/garlic, cheese, and sour cream. 
“I’m stuffed,” he reports. Joining him at dinner were three other thru-hikers. One is a young woman named Cado (as in Avo-Cado) from Worcester, Mass., who literally eats avocado on the trail, and a couple (husband/wife or bf/gf) from the Eastern Shore of Maryland. 
In the morning, Sharkchow will have breakfast at the hostel before heading out. On the menu: eggs, potatoes, biscuits, pancakes. “I will eat all of the above,” he says. 
Mrs. Sharkchow had to ask if he had been paying attention to Washington news - AG Barr testimony one day, Barr refusing to testify the next. Indeed, he listened to NPR on his little radio on Wednesday, heard enough to know he had heard enough, then switched to a country and western station. Then he went to one of those “80s, 90s, and today” stations. 
“That got me up the mountain,” he says.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612324,"Sharkchow rolled into Moreland Gap Shelter in Tennessee today after an 18.9 mile hike. Along the way, he crossed the 400-mile mark. (See photo, cue the noisemakers.) Weather was like yesterday - beautiful in the morning, thunderstorms in the afternoon. The weather app on his phone isn’t all that helpful, he says. “In the mountains, anything can happen.”
Speaking of water… it occurred to Mrs. Sharkchow that she hadn’t heard how his water filtration system was working. Turns out it’s great. He uses a Sawyer Squeeze, which is popular with the AT crowd. He screws the filter onto a smart water bottle, then squeezes, forcing water thru the filter. 
In theory, water from a spring should be fine, but Sharkchow filters it anyway. Water from an open stream has to be filtered, because maybe an animal peed in it. The thing about the Sawyer Squeeze is it can’t freeze. So when Sharkchow is in cold temps, like when it snowed, he kept the filter in his sleeping bag when he slept, to keep it warm. 
Bottom line: “Filtered mountain water is delicious,” says Sharkchow. When he’s in a town, and drinking water from a tap, he can taste the difference.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612474,"One month ago today, Sharkchow started his long-anticipated walk in the woods. Now, 426.8 miles in, he’s a little dinged up and many pounds lighter, but psyched to keep going. Tonight (Saturday) he’s at the Boots Off Hostel in Hampton, Tenn., right off the trail. He arrived in the nick of time. Literally 30 seconds after he walked into the bunkroom, the wind picked up, the skies opened, and it poured rain.
One highlight of today’s hike was the beautiful Laurel Falls and river. Another highlight: The guy at the hostel who makes food for the hikers. Today it was pulled pork sandwiches. And not just any pulled pork sandwiches. 
“It was the best pulled pork sandwich I’ve ever had,” Sharkchow says. “So incredibly good, better than Sonny’s.” Anybody from Florida knows what that means. “That alone is a reason to come here.” 
The chef, a retiree who’s a “master pit boss,” cooks the pork overnight in a smoker with five different kinds of wood. Technically, this wasn’t trail magic - he charges $5 a sandwich, enough to cover his costs - but it sounds like magic to Mrs. Sharkchow. Yesterday he made BBQ ribs, tomorrow brisket. 
After the pork sandwich, Sharkchow headed into town to resupply at the Dollar General, then have more to eat. So he hit the McDonalds and had a fish filet, a Big Mac, and medium fries. Really. 
Sharkchow also got a kick out of the other hikers at the hostel, including a young guy named Flash Bandit (once known as Sharkbait) who got caught in the rain in the mountain. Then there’s a group of young women, who all started hiking the trail individually but met along the way and have formed a kind of posse. “It’s like they’ve known each other forever,” says Sharkchow. “They’re hilarious.” Their names are Bambi, Data, Keebler, and Zora. 
Sharkchow is impressed by these women hiking the trail. “They’re just fearless,” he says.

His boots are soaked, and will still be soaked in the morning, but tomorrow is supposed to be warm and sunny, so his boots will dry out as he walks … after about 10 miles.
The picture here is Watauga Lake near Hampton, Tenn., right before it started to rain. For much of the morning, Sharkchow walked along the edge of the lake, which is active bear area and has signs that say “don’t loiter.” He didn’t loiter. (The picture is from the other side, the “town” side of the lake.) A couple hours later he saw “a giant bear scat” in the middle of the trail. 
“That must have been a big bear,” Sharkchow said.
Tonight he’s at Iron Mountain Shelter with Flash Bandit (both in hammocks) and a few others, 4 sleeping in the shelter. It’s pretty chilly out, supposed to drop to the high 40s, but nobody made a fire. “Thru-hikers don’t make fires,” he said. They get set up, make dinner, hang bear bags, and hit the sack. 
He’s 26 miles from Damascus, Virginia, a famous trail town, and hopes to get there in maybe a day and a half.

It is said that by the time you reach Damascus, you have your “trail legs.” And people keep telling Sharkchow he’s doing great, including the guys at the outfitters. But he doesn’t feel that way.
“This has been extraordinarily more difficult than I thought it would be,” he said. “I’m just taking it one day at a time.” 
Sharkchow had dinner with a guy from Pensacola who’s also a first-time thru-hiker, a couple of years older, and they compared notes. He agrees, it’s much harder than he thought it would be.

The guys threw rocks at the bear (who was climbing the tree) to try to chase it away, but it seemed unimpressed and “just looked back at us.”
The guys also shined flashlights on the bear, but “all I could see was his two white eyes,” said Sharkchow. “He didn’t come at us.” 
Perdido, their other hiking buddy, stayed in his tent. “He thought we had it under control,” said Sharkchow, unperturbed.
The actual owner of the food in question, a hiker named Strikeout, was camped down by the river, and had hung his food further up the embankment, where the other guys were camped. “We were defending his food,” said Sharkchow, maybe a wee bit perturbed.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613165,"Update from Mrs. Sharkchow (Sunday morning): According to news reports, a guy with a large knife attacked two hikers in Wythe County, southwest Virginia, late Friday night, but apparently no one has died. A woman was “cut up pretty badly,” but is expected to survive, the sheriff said. No info on second victim. A 24-mile section of the AT, from VA-16 in Marion northward to VA-42, is still closed as of 7:00 am Sunday morning, per Appalachian Trail Conservancy site. 
Here's the earlier report: Someone was murdered on the AT last night, and the trail is closed for the 18 miles heading north out of Marion, Va. Just talked to Sharkchow (noon Saturday). Forest service official says “one person is in custody.” No ID yet on the victim. The problematic hiker's trail name is Sovereign, hiking with a big knife and a pitbull dog. He's been threatening hikers with the knife for a few weeks, was in custody for a while in NC, but he was released because they didn’t have anything on him other than threats.
Sharkchow says he never personally encountered the guy with the knife, but hikers had been talking about him for three weeks. Sharkchow figures he was a shelter or two behind this guy. 
At one point, “I was at a shelter the day after the guy with the knife was there threatening people,” Sharkchow says. Though someone is in custody, “I’m not sure if the killer has been caught.” 
At a shelter between Hot Springs, NC, and Erwin, TN, this guy Sovereign “went nutty, threatening people, and threatened to kill his dog with the knife,” Sharkchow heard.
Then authorities found him, held him for a period, then released him. But they were concerned he’d go back to the trail. Someone who runs a site called Hiker Yearbook found the guy on the trail, and tried to persuade him to go home, and gave him a bus ticket. 
“We’d heard he was on a bus, and off the trail,” said Sharkchow. “Then we heard yesterday or the day before that he was back on the trail, and now this.” 
Sharkchow is now hunkered down at an Econolodge in Marion, Va., with Perdido. He expects every available bed in town to fill up fast, as hikers are diverted from the trail.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613345,"Sadly, Sharkchow’s initial report was true. An AT hiker did die after being attacked by a knife-wielding man early Saturday morning. The suspect is in custody and faces federal charges. Here’s the Washington Post story, which is the most comprehensive I’ve seen. Sharkchow says he assumed the authorities initially weren’t discussing the hiker’s death for “investigative reasons,” ie, they were still investigating the incident and interrogating the suspect. Also, trying to reach the hiker’s family.
The 24-mile stretch of the AT north of Marion, Va., that had been closed was reopened Sunday morning. Sharkchow and Perdido decided to take a zero day anyway, in part because the weather was lousy. So it was a day for hanging out and enjoying civilization, like lunch at Bojangles (chicken and biscuits) and another night at the luxury Econolodge. 
Also, re that bear encounter Friday, Perdido pointed out that he did in fact get out of his tent, figured the situation was under control, and got back in his tent. There should be no doubt that Perdido is as tough a customer as Sharkchow. After all, Sharkchow doesn’t hike with just anybody. 
Speaking of which: Sharkchow reports he got a text from Montana Jesus, who heard about the incident on the trail and wanted to know how he was doing. Also, while in Marion, Sharkchow ran into some familiar faces, No Keys and Scout. 
Sharkchow also met a hiker with a fabulous trail name. To explain the name, this hiker pulled up a picture on his cell phone of Jimmy Carter getting off Marine One, and a marine saluting in the corner. Then he showed another picture of Ronald Reagan on Marine One, and again, there’s a marine saluting in the corner. That marine, now a bit older, is hiking the trail as ... Mr. President. 
It bears repeating that the tragic killing of an AT hiker over the weekend is a rare exception for an exceedingly peaceful place. According to the Post article, the last homicide on the AT took place in 2011. “The vast, vast majority of people on the trail are very, very nice,” says Sharkchow.  
In the morning, Sharkchow will make good use of the waffle machine at the Econolodge, then catch the shuttle bus with Perdido to get back on the trail. The bus ride costs 50 cents.

Sharkchow struck a pose, and texted the photo to Mrs. Sharkchow, who always appreciates “proof of life.”
When asked what he was thinking when he was crouched down like that, Sharkchow said, “How will I ever get back up?”
After an 18-mile hike, the guys reached a nice campsite and decided to stop for the night. They had all figured out where to set up their hammocks and tents, when two women came along and suggested the guys move ahead a quarter mile where there’s a nice flat area. The guys said, no thank you, we like it here.
Then the women went over to a corner of the campground, opened up their packs, and put on gloves. Sharkchow walked over and asked them what they were doing. He thought maybe they were there to pick mushrooms. Then he noticed stuff strewn about - an open bag of potato chips, socks, clothing, string. 
“You know what happened, right?” one of the women said. “We’re from the local hiking club, and we’re cleaning up stuff that got left behind.” 
Just two days earlier, this was a crime scene. Twenty feet from where Sharkchow had set up his hammock was where poor Ronald Sanchez Jr., 43, of Oklahoma had perished. Mrs. Sharkchow almost couldn’t tell this story, it’s so unnerving and sad…

Also of note: Sharkchow has lightened his pack by a few pounds, including no more stove. So no more hot meals. Tonight, dinner was a “cold-soaked” chicken teriyaki backpacker meal. Cold-soaked = add water, wait an hour or so, and eat it cold. We tested this method during the hiatus, and were pleasantly surprised by how good the beef stroganoff was cold.

Also, just before the rain, as he was walking along he nearly tripped on a little fawn in the middle of the path. It was just standing there, “blinking at me like Bambi,” he said. “It had no fear of me. I could have reached out and touched it with my stick.” 
Sharkchow wishes he had taken its picture, but sometimes we have to let words paint the picture.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615086,"Yet another 18-mile day for Sharkchow on Thursday. He made it to Niday Shelter, where he was joined by Survivor (and his dog, Gus), Big Red, Wizard, Cheese Curd, Slim, and some section hikers. There was no cell reception at Niday, so this info was gleaned from a voicemail left Friday morning while Mrs. Sharkchow was at a breakfast event deep inside the Beltway.
As of 8:50 Friday morning, Sharkchow was heading north (good) on “some ridge” and had just passed a monument to Audie Murphy on “some mountain"" (5 miles from Niday). Audie Murphy was a movie actor, and the most decorated American soldier of WWII. He died in May 1971 when the small plane in which he was a passenger crashed into Brush Mountain, 20 miles west of Roanoke, Va.

And that doesn’t include the additional 8/10 of a mile he hiked to and from a grocery where they make burgers and fries for hungry thru-hikers. He washed it down with a diet Coke and two big bottles of Gatorade. Sharkchow hiked most of the day with a guy from Rhode Island named Chowda.
Now he’s only 1.7 miles away from McAfee Knob - the iconic spot on the AT overlooking the Appalachian Mountains at 3,200 feet elevation. Sharkchow will head there in the morning. Pictures will be taken.

Sharkchow made it to McAfee at 7:40 a.m. Saturday, and posed for this shot, taken by fellow thru-hiker Wigs. Then they swapped positions, and Sharkchow took Wigs’ picture. They were the only two people there. The early crowd of thru-hikers who went to McAfee for the sunrise had already moved on.
“I just lucked out,” Sharkchow said. 
Then it was on to Daleville, Va., the best kind of trail town - motels are right off the trail. Sharkchow went for the Howard Johnson’s, then a BBQ dinner (one-third of a rack of ribs) with a bunch of thru-hikers. By chance, he sat next to a young guy named Gumby, who, upon hearing the name Sharkchow, made the connection to mutual friends in Massachusetts. Sometimes the world is incredibly small. 
Some readers have asked for more description of the trail itself. Sharkchow says a lot of today’s hike was along cliffs - not an easy stroll, every step taken mindfully. Even when it’s a seemingly simple path, hikers have to watch out for roots, rocks, and other hazards. At times, the trail can seem like one big obstacle course. The folks who design it seem to delight in routing hikers thru a big jumble of rocks, for example, says Sharkchow. 
“You’re not walking along whistling Dixie,” he says. 
What compels people to hike this trail? Sharkchow asks. 
Or maybe the better question is, once you know what it’s like, what compels you to keep going? “I don’t know what the answer is,” he says. 
Because it’s there? “Maybe.”

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615338,"Sharkchow hiked 25 miles today, his highest-mileage day so far. Mrs. Sharkchow started scolding him for overdoing it, but he cut me off: There was trail magic. Really delicious trail magic - cold drinks, watermelon, chili.
“Suddenly, there was real food, and I felt completely rejuvenated,” Sharkchow said. 
The chili was “fantastic.” The guy serving the magic, a 2013 AT alum named Pretzel, made the chili himself, complete with onions, carrots, and several kinds of beans. Sharkchow and his hiking companion, Lost Larry, reached Bobbelets Gap Shelter and decided to keep going (after Sharkchow filled water bottle and rinsed out shirt in stream). The trail magic gave them the fuel they needed to walk an additional 6.5 miles to Cove Mountain Shelter. 
Also, don’t let the name Lost Larry fool you. He knows what he’s doing. He hiked the Pacific Crest Trail in 1980 and last year did most of the Continental Divide Trail. At some point this year, he’ll go finish the Continental Divide, then come back and finish the AT. 
Sharkchow didn't like the HoJo's in Daleville. But it was really the breakfast that was disappointing. The waffle-maker didn’t work. “But they did have chocolate donuts, so I ate about 50 of them,” he said. They also had OJ. So it can’t have been that bad. 
Sharkchow has now been back on the trail a week, and in that time, has hiked 146 miles. Again, that sounds like too much. But he says he may not do a big day tomorrow. His next town will be Glasgow, Va., about 30 miles up the trail and 6 miles to the west. He’s heard that the people there are friendly and give rides to thru-hikers.

Sharkchow is still with Lost Larry, and will be for several days. Larry is a hiking machine. He’s up wicked early - 5:00 or 5:15 a.m. - and hits the trail. Sharkchow is down with that.
The trend is toward 20-plus-mile days. “Part of covering miles is building a sense of momentum,” Sharkchow says. “That’s what helps you get through a hike like this.” 
Tuesday they’ll hike about six miles, hitch a ride into Glasgow, Va., to resupply and take showers at a pavilion downtown, then hitch a ride back to the trail and keep going. Along the way, they’ll cross the James River via a 1,000-ft. footbridge. According to the guidebook, it’s the longest foot-use-only bridge on the AT. Mrs. Sharkchow","Cove Mountain Shelter

“It’s fine,” he said. “It has to do with trail conditions.” 
The trail in that part of Virginia, George Washington National Forest, is flat - but not all. 
“You’re going along, and then there are rocks,” he said. Also, “I’m trying to be efficient. That means leaving very, very early in the morning.” 
As in, getting up at 5:10 a.m., hitting the trail at 6:00. 
“If I need to slow down, I’ll slow down,” he said.
The highlight of Tuesday was two appearances of trail magic. First came right after Sharkchow and Lost Larry had crossed the James River (via the 1,000-foot-long footbridge). They sat down to eat breakfast, and noticed a woman setting up chairs. Sharkchow had a turkey sandwich, fig newtons, two oranges, and lemonade. Later in the day, there was a guy at a road crossing giving out apples and root beer. 
“It’s a terrific thing, because it gives you a boost right when you need it - the boost from calories, and the boost to your spirits,” Sharkchow says. 
He stayed Tuesday night at Brown Mountain Creek Shelter, right near the 800-mile mark on the AT.

There was a place where Lost Larry wanted to stop, but when Sharkchow got there, he didn’t think that was it, so he kept going. “When I figured it out, I was closer to this shelter,” he said. “I’ll eat dinner in the morning.” 
“I think I climbed three mountains today, and went down three mountains,” said a weary Sharkchow.
Earlier in the evening, as it was getting dark, Sharkchow saw a mother bear and two cubs ahead and had to yell and shake his stick to warn them away. They ran down the switchback where he was heading, so he had to yell again, and they ran off.
“They were cute little cubs,” he said. And mama bear wasn’t threatening.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615870,"The fun story for Friday begins on Thursday. Sharkchow was at Reed’s Gap, a place where hikers go to catch a shuttle to a craft beer brewery called the Devil’s Backbone.
“Interestingly, the closer they get to the pickup point, the faster they walk,” Sharkchow observes. “I am not among that group.”  
When he got to Reed’s Gap, there was a guy helping shuttle hikers to the brewery and giving out trail magic - fruit and protein bars. Sharkchow had an apple. Then he asked the guy if he had water. Just then, an older gentleman - a day hiker - happened along and said he had water in his car. So he went to his car and filled up Sharkchow’s extra liter, gave it to him, and drove away. 
Friday morning, Sharkchow walked an easy 5.2 miles to Rockfish Gap, the departure point for Waynesboro, Va. - a town about 4 miles away. 
Thru-hikers often hitchhike to get places off-trail, and Sharkchow was ready to try his luck getting to Waynesboro. At Rockfish Gap, on the Blue Ridge Parkway, he went up the hill and put his leg over the wooden guardrail. 
“I looked up, and here comes the same gentleman in his car,” Sharkchow says. “I stuck my thumb out, and he pulled over.” 
He agreed to give Sharkchow a ride into Waynesboro, but his car was full of stuff - his backpack on the passenger seat and a bicycle in the back seat. So he took the bike out, removed the wheels, put them in the trunk, and put the bike frame in the woods, to be retrieved later. 
During the ride into town, he told Sharkchow about his book. He had thru-hiked the AT in 2008, at age 63. His trail name was Steady and his brother’s was Slow, but after his brother dropped out, he kept going as Slow and Steady. He thru-hiked using a leap-frogging system that involved two cars. He’d drive one car north, leave it, hike back to the other car, then drive it north beyond the first car. At Harper’s Ferry, he drove to Maine, and did the leap-frogging routine south back to Harper’s Ferry. 
This gentleman’s name is Robert Callaway, and his book is called “Slow and Steady: Hiking the Appalachian Trail,” published in 2014. Now in his 70s, he’s doing day hikes to train for another thru-hike. 
For the second time in two days, Sharkchow extended his whole-hearted gratitude to Mr. Callaway.

While in town, they visited Rockfish Gap Outfitters, which had a treasure trove of Sharkchow’s favorite backpacker meal, Mountain House Pro-Pak Freeze-Dried Rice and Chicken. Net weight, 4.51 oz. Stamped on the back, “Best by June 2048.” We’re going to put one in a time capsule, and see if that's really true. 
At breakfast Saturday, we sat with Keith and Kristi, a.k.a. McDouble and Pacecar, a young couple from Nashville who Sharkchow had met early in his hike. “McDouble” stands for all the McDonalds he packs away; “Pacecar"" is so named because she hikes first and sets the pace. They started their AT thru-hike April 2, just days after returning to the US from Haiti, where they worked as Southern Baptist missionaries. We were impressed they could turn it around so quickly.

The good news Sunday evening is that Sharkchow is in his hammock - and dry. But his boots are soaking wet. His wet socks are hanging up under his tarp, but not inside the hammock. It rained all day, and the rain got heavier and heavier as the day wore on. 
“Three times I had to take off my boots and dump out the water,” Sharkchow says. “Three times I had to wring out my socks.” 
At one point, as he was wringing out his socks, a day-hiker with a kid on her back happened by, and asked if he was a thru-hiker. Sharkchow said he was, and they chatted a bit. Then she walked on. Next thing he knew, she was running after him and said she had some “flapjacks” for him.

Still, there were moments that sparked joy. Like when he stopped at the camp store after hiking 8 miles and got a (pricey) sandwich, cherry pie, and diet Coke at 10:30 in the morning. And snacking on delicious Fig Newtons in the afternoon. And later in the day, crossing the 900-mile mark. 
“Supposedly the sun will be out tomorrow, which would be a novelty,” Sharkchow said.
Rain notwithstanding, the paths on this part of the AT - Shenandoah National Park - are some of the nicest he’s seen of the whole hike. They’re mostly level, with some rocks and some climbing. But there are long sections of clear path. 
“That’s why you can do longer days here,” he said. “Tomorrow I’ll try for 24 miles.”

As in, after four days of rain, it finally stopped. His boots are almost dry. The night before, Monday into Tuesday, was the grand finale - a “horrific” rain storm. 
“The wind had to be 30-40 mph,” he says. “I was up in the mountain, on the exposed side of the ridge. It was fine - I stayed dry.” He had set up his hammock in the trees, which provided some shield, and made sure he wasn’t near trees that might blow down. By morning, it was in the 50s, breezy, and dry - great hiking weather. 
Sharkchow, by the way, loves to get an early start. “It’s beautiful to walk in the morning. Really quiet. If you get a ton done early in the day, it opens up possibilities for later in the day. You get a sense of accomplishment.” 
This picture is the view from near Big Meadows Lodge, the site for President Franklin Roosevelt’s dedication of Shenandoah National Park and Skyline Drive in 1936. 
All that beauty notwithstanding, Sharkchow is ready to get out of Virginia - the state with the most AT miles (550 - a quarter of the trail). “You get tired of being in the same state, and you want to feel like you’re making progress.”

Fearless deer that stand right in the trail and look back, blinking like Bambi. But the most memorable animal encounter was yesterday - the thru-hiker with the cat.
The hiker’s name is Pocket Pussy. Sharkchow didn’t get the cat’s name, but it’s a beautiful Siamese. It rides in a baby-carrier-like device, strapped to its owner’s front. 
“I don’t believe the cat walks the trail, I believe it rides,” says Sharkchow. “The cat seemed perfectly chill.” Or make that purr-fectly.
The bear encounter was nothing overly concerning - just a large bear in the middle of the trail that wouldn’t move. Sharkchow had to keep yelling “hey bear” and waving his stick to get it to go away, but it kept running down the trail and stopping and looking around. For a stretch, it had no way to get off the trail, but eventually it did. 
The groundhog story is a bit more perplexing. It also wouldn’t budge. It kept looking back at Sharkchow and saying, “I’m not moving.” But a groundhog isn’t a bear. Can’t you just step over it? “There isn’t room on the trail for both of us!” said Sharkchow. “The trail is very narrow - sometimes just 6 inches wide.” Finally, it scurried off into the brush. 
Friday’s hike - almost 30 miles, past the 1,000-mile marker - included an 18-mile section called the Roller-Coaster. “But it didn’t have anything to do with fun,” said Sharkchow. “It was so rocky. Just up and down, up a hill, down the other side, down to a brook, more up and down, then a marshy, muddy area. I survived.”

It was a marathon-like day Monday at 26.3 miles, landing at Tumbling Run Shelters, where there are two shelters: one labeled “Snoring,” the other “Non-Snoring.” Sharkchow didn’t have to make that tough decision, as he’s a hammock guy. More important, it was a fabulous place to stop for the day.
“This is the nicest shelter and camping area I’ve seen on the entire trail,” Sharkchow said. 
There’s a stream that runs through it, a spring for drinking water, a pavilion with a roof and picnic table, and laundry lines to hang damp clothing. He soaked his feet in the stream. Which made Mrs. Sharkchow wonder why he hiked so many miles - especially in Pennsylvania, which is a famously rocky part of the AT. He said he had read negative reviews of Deer Lick Shelters, and decided to go the extra 3.6 miles to get to Tumbling Run. He’s glad he did. 
“Here is perfect,” Sharkchow said. As for the terrain: “The trail varies. There’s some nice soft ground, then you turn the corner, and it’s just rock.”

The Appalachian Trail Conservancy says the trail is 2,190 miles long, but that’s not precise. The trail’s exact route changes every year. Indeed, Sharkchow says he saw old half-way markers, but there were no bells and whistles when he passed the invisible barrier of Half-Way 2019.
He did see a marker for 1,100 miles, but didn’t take a picture. Sharkchow was more excited about the trail magic he encountered at a shelter as he passed by. Three section-hikers were 3 miles from finishing their 100-mile trip, and would soon be picked up. 
“Hey, you want some cheese? How about a bagel?” someone asked him. It was their leftover food, so he had a bagel-and-cheese sandwich - a nice change of pace. Trail magic is great not just for the calories but also for the variety. Eating the same diet of backpacker meals, Snickers bars, beef jerky, and trail mix day in and day out gets old.

The challenge is to eat a half-gallon of ice cream in a half-hour (because it’s around the half-way point on the AT). It used to be that if you succeeded, you’d get the ice cream for free. Now you just get … a pat on the back? Indigestion?  
Anyway, the three other guys - named Chris, Sarasota, and Johnny Appleseed - had talked about this all night. Sharkchow wasn't so psyched, but thought maybe he’d eat a pint in solidarity. Sure enough, the three other guys each consumed a half-gallon. And Sharkchow ate a pint of Hershey’s brownie cookie dough ice cream. Then he got a big cheeseburger with a big flatbread bun.
Soon enough, it was time for lunch: roast beef sub, cherry Coke, big bottle of Gatorade.
“It was steaming hot today,” he said. 
Sharkchow called Wednesday night from Boiling Springs, Pa. - specifically, the Boiling Springs Hostel, a little bunkhouse in the basement of a private home several miles off the trail. (A shuttle transports hikers to the hostel.) He spent most of the day hiking with Chris, a Polish-American dual citizen who lives on Long Island - “really interesting guy, very very nice.” Chris will soon leave the AT to take his grandchildren to Poland.

And that doesn’t include the 6/10 of a mile hike up a hill to the grocery store - along a highway with no shoulder. Sharkchow, needless to say, did not enjoy trudging up that hill with cars zooming by right next to him.
“It was treacherous,” he said. 
But the grocery store was fabulous. He got a whole BBQ chicken, 3/4 of a pound of potato salad, and two Chobani yogurts, and ate pretty much all of it in a booth near the deli counter. Then when he was buying resupply, the checkout guy asked if he knew about the Assembly of God Church in town. Checkout guy was a member, and said they had a hiker hostel in the basement. The store manager set Sharkchow up with a ride to the church.

There was a big sign out front: “Hikers welcome, come as you are.” Inside, rules were listed, starting with hours for “quiet time.” Also, “No drugs. No alcohol. Clean up after yourself.”
Friday was less happy. In the morning, Sharkchow had a rainy walk across the Susquehanna River. When he got to the other side, there were railroad tracks. He looked down the tracks, and saw lights: A freight train was coming. So he had to stand there in the rain and wait for the train to cross. 
Sharkchow hiked 29 miles today. “It was a long, long day,” he said. Why didn’t he stop sooner, Mrs. Sharkchow wondered. Because there are issues with access to water, he said. It’s a Pennsylvania thing, especially as you move east. He doesn’t want to be up on a ridge with no water, so he has to plan ahead. And today, that meant hiking 29 miles. 
This afternoon, he discovered from the radio that today was the summer solstice, June 21, which means ... Naked Hiking Day! It’s a global tradition. Mrs. Sharkchow didn’t need to ask if he participated. Because of course he didn’t. Furthermore, he didn’t see any naked people all day.

He hiked 14.5 miles and landed at Eckville Shelter, which sounded pretty deluxe: It had a little shower, a flush toilet, and the ability to charge phones. There’s a caretaker who lives in a house right there, thus all the amenities. In fact, the property belongs to the caretaker.

“It’s a rocky outcrop - literally, walking along a rocky edge,” Sharkchow said. 
Given the previous situation with his ankle, he paid very close attention to each step. “If you lose your footing, you’re gone,” he said. Seeing as how Mrs. Sharkchow was talking to him, she assumed there were no mishaps. But she asked anyway: How did he do? “I’m alive. It was OK.” 
In this part of the trail, it alternates between rocky - pure rocks - and then nice sections, just a path thru the woods. It’s all or nothing. 
“It’s hard to know what you’re walking into,” he says. “But I did OK today - 24 miles in 12 hours.” 
The other challenge is water. As in, there isn’t much water for the next 20 miles. But he’ll figure it out. And he can’t wait to get out of Pennsylvania.

It was a really hot day. But he was motivated by one thing.
“I’m a day away from being done with rocks,” he said. “This is like hiker hell. But I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.” 
After reaching Delaware Water Gap, he’s looking forward to walking to his native land, the part of the AT that he first visited as a Boy Scout 50 years ago and which inspired him to do this ridiculously long hike. “It’ll be better in New Jersey,” he said confidently. For now, though, “it’s just a big long slog.” 
He’s camping at a site that’s not near a shelter. There are six tents and Sharkchow in his hammock. But he’s not exactly in the middle of nowhere; he can hear traffic noise. “It’s real woods, but with urban sounds,” he says.
There were also bees, and Sharkchow got stung twice. He had a big lump on his leg, but within 10 minutes it was gone. He thinks someone dropped something sweet, the bees found it, and then he intruded. “I had a misunderstanding with some bees,” he said.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618994,"It was his most distinctive piece of gear - a long, slender, straight, and sturdy piece of lodgepole pine, his trusty hiking stick. Sharkchow had picked it up 20 years ago from a pile of “yard waste” - ie, trail maintenance - in Yellowstone National Park, where he was hiking with his then-young son.
A month ago, when Mrs. Sharkchow was visiting him out in Harpers Ferry, he worried out loud that the stick might not make it. It was showing signs of wear and rot. 
Today, after 20 years and almost 1,300 miles on the AT, the stick met its demise - but for a noble cause. Sharkchow was walking along, and he stepped on a log. A branch from the log flew up and tripped him, and down he went on the rocks, head first. 
“Because the stick was slightly under me, it broke the fall,” he said. “Another inch, and I’m not sure I would have made it.” 
The stick protected him from slamming his head into the rocks. He’s a little dinged up, he says, but “I’m fine."" He lashed the two pieces of the stick together to finish the remaining 12 miles of Tuesday's hike into Delaware Water Gap, PA. 
There, he went to the local outfitter’s and got carbon fiber hiking poles - just like everyone else’s. But there will be no “burial at trail” for the beloved piece of lodgepole pine. It so happens that two college friends of Mrs. Sharkchow, who live about an hour away, are driving out to see him tomorrow, and among their many acts of kindness, they will retrieve the stick and mail it to Washington. 
Sharkchow is staying Tuesday night at a church hostel, the Presbyterian Church of the Mountain. Maybe he’ll say a little prayer for that piece of wood, which served him well over the years. 
“I am heartbroken,” he texted earlier today, along with pictures of the broken stick. “I feel like I’ve lost a best friend.”

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619044,"Sharkchow decided to give his dinged up body a rest Wednesday, and took a “zero” in Delaware Water Gap, PA. Mrs. Sharkchow’s college mate Christine drove in from New Jersey for a visit and a trip to Walmart in nearby East Stroudsburg. Christine had fun taking pix and video while Sharkchow resupplied at Walmart. The highlight might have been his commercial for Little Debbie Cakes - which he actually doesn’t eat. But they are famously caloric, so if the need arose… Then Sharkchow treated her to lunch (not at Walmart) and regaled her with trail stories.
“It was a very nice little break from the trail,” he said. 
Sharkchow is looking forward to walking across the bridge Thursday into New Jersey, the land of his birth. It’s supposed to rain tonight and into tomorrow, but he’s eager to get moving again - and out of that claustrophobic church basement. He also needs to teach himself how to hike with those two trekking poles. The pieces of his old lodgepole pine stick are now in Christine’s custody.

Did he cheer when he left PA? “Everyone did!” Sharkchow said. 
Soon he was crossing the 1,300-mile mark on the AT. There are some rocks in New Jersey, “but it’s 50 times better than in Pennsylvania!” 
He hiked with two other people - a guy named Two Dinners and a woman named Platypus. When they got to the shelter for the night, there was - astonishingly - another hiker named Platypus, this one a man. Sheer coincidence. And neither is from Australia. 
It rained much of the day, but had stopped by evening. So his wet stuff is on a clothes line, and he’s changed into dry clothes. He feels good/tired, is sleeping in hammock. It’s supposed to be wicked hot the next few days, so he thinks he’ll start walking early. 
New Jersey is famous for its bears. But so far no sightings. Food is safely in a bear box.

“It was so hot, my clothes were thoroughly soaked,” he said. He took his shirt off three or four times today just to wring it out. Then, in the highlight of the day, he went to the lake at High Point State Park and swam with his clothes on. Because his clothes couldn’t have gotten more wet. While he was at the lake, a nice lady walked over and offered him a pastry. 
Another highlight: Seeing a mama bear on the trail, and her two cute cubs scurrying up trees nearby.
Then there was the Trail Magic Guy - maybe the most amazing trail magic Sharkchow had ever seen. At 9:30 in the morning, he had coolers full of little sandwiches (ham, muenster, pickles), soft drinks, fresh fruit (pears, apples, peaches, cherries), cookies, Cheezits. 
Trail Magic Guy is in his 70s, and spends $80 or $90 a day on sustenance for hikers every day in July. He’s been doing this for years. “I’m wealthy, and I can afford it,” he told Sharkchow, who was his first customer of the day.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619228,"First, one more highlight from yesterday: At High Point Shelter in New Jersey, Sharkchow ran into a Boy Scout troop that was hiking south on the AT. 
“Fifty years ago, I was one of those scouts,” he told the troop leaders. “So here I am at High Point, where I first had the idea of hiking the AT.” (Sharkchow grew up in New Jersey.)
One of the leaders asked Sharkchow how far he’s gone. Then the leader turned to the boys, and said: “He’s just walked over 1,300 miles, and you have just walked four.” The troop broke into applause. 
Today (Saturday), was a two-stage day. First thing in the morning, a 7-mile hike in the New York-New Jersey highlands to Unionville, NY, which sounds like a cute town. Sharkchow hiked with a guy named Wizard (see picture), and they hung out in Unionville for the hot part of the day, including dinner at a pub. Then another 5-plus miles to Pochuck Mountain Shelter in NJ for the night. At some point this evening, it rained. Sharkchow is dry in his hammock.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619291,"Sharkchow hiked 23.7 miles Sunday, despite the miserable heat. The strategy: “At every substantial stream, take off shirt, rinse, repeat. That sort of invigorated us.” 
The “us” is Sharkchow and Wizard, with whom he hiked again today. See yesterday’s post for a picture of Wizard and his colorful tattoos and piercings. He's an ex-Army medic in Afghanistan, then was a park service ranger. 
Wizard is from Minnesota, so he must be nice. As the picture shows, Wizard is also hiking with a little guitar, and has been busking along the way to help fund the trip. On Sunday, he went to a popular farm stand off the trail and made $6. In the next few days, he’s going to head into Manhattan to busk - either at Times Square (alongside the Naked Cowboy?) or maybe right there at Grand Central Station. If you see him, please throw in a buck or two. 
So how does an AT thru-hiker make his/her way into Manhattan without walking a whole lot of extra miles? Why, the Appalachian Trail commuter rail stop. Apparently there’s also a spot on the AT from which Manhattan is visible. Bear Mountain, says Sharkchow. We demand pictures. 
Today was kind of exhausting - a lot of climbing to get up onto the ridge, “basically on big stones,” he said. There was actual rock climbing involved, with rebar ladder rungs embedded in the stone. “Doing it with a full pack was challenging,” he said. “Plus the hot temperature…” 
Was today’s hike as bad as Pennsylvania? 
“Nothing close,” he said. “Much better than that.” 
Also helpful: lots of trail magic. At almost every trail head, there were coolers with ice-cold water and soda, and signs saying ""For Thru-Hikers.""
One final moment of zen: They stopped at a farm store that had “the best cider donuts.” Sharkchow had two, plus Gatorade.

Soon after, Mother Nature added her own not entirely welcome refreshment. It started raining - punctuated by thunder and lightning - and didn’t stop. 
When Mrs. Sharkchow spoke to him late in the evening, it was still raining steadily and still hot. Boots are soaking wet. Wet boots are bad - “they chew your feet to pieces,” he says. 
An addition to Sunday report: He saw his 8th bear of the hike (it was running away). We didn't know he was keeping count. 
Monday night, he was at the William Brien Memorial Shelter, where he set up his hammock. In the rain. On Tuesday, he will hike over Bear Mountain - elevation 1,305 feet, w/view of Manhattan, but Sharkchow makes no promises. Then he will cross the Hudson River.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619566,"After an almost-17-mile hike, Sharkchow called late Tuesday from the pavilion at the Graymoor Spiritual Life Center in Garrison, NY. He sounded good. The Graymoor center is a ministry of the Franciscan Friars of the Atonement. St. Francis is the patron saint of animals and wanderers, known to care for strangers. And thru-hikers. 
Was Sharkchow there to atone for sins? “I suppose I might be,” he said. But really, he was there with a lot of other hikers - most camping in tents in the baseball field. Sharkchow had strung up his hammock between two posts in the open-sided pavilion, which is next to the ball field. Earlier, he had had a cold-water shower, which was “fantastic - it was so good!” 
Today he crossed the Hudson River. He also went over the top of Bear Mountain, but the view of Manhattan was a half-mile off-trail, and he didn’t want to walk the extra steps.
Right before Bear Mountain, the AT went right thru a little zoo with the saddest bear he had ever seen, lying there in a pen with some vultures. The guidebook says “bear cage is lowest point on AT,” and indeed it is, says Sharkchow. 
His boots are still wet. During today’s hike, he stopped a few times and took off his boots and socks just to air out his feet. He also crossed the 1,400-mile mark from Springer Mountain. But more important, today he is grateful to the Graymoor center for the accommodations, provided free of charge.

He filled us in a bit more on Friday. Karen’s hostel, where he stayed Friday night, cost $30 - a great deal for $$$ NW Connecticut.

Sharkchow sounded pretty exhausted Monday evening after hiking 21 miles, including a lot of climbing. He’s at Tom Leonard Shelter in Great Barrington, Mass. Water is an issue, and as the day wore on, he reached an “emergency level” of H20. Then trail magic appeared - at just the right time. 
“It bailed me out, because it was so hot and there’s not a lot of good water around here,” he said. A local church does trail magic at that particular spot on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. They grill hamburgers right there on the trail, and have coolers full of water and iced tea. Sharchow had two hamburgers and all the liquid he could guzzle. 
“I’m not sure I could have made it to this shelter without the trail magic,” he said, gratefully. 
Sharkchow also told a story from Sunday in Salisbury, CT. He was at a cemetery that lets people use their hose - a source of nice cold water - and noticed a man and a woman sitting on a bench. Later, he saw them at the Sages Ravine campsite. Turns out the man was Joe, a former newspaper reporter whom Sharkchow had met way back at Neel Gap in Georgia. 
“I thought you might be Sharkchow,” Joe said, “but you didn’t have that walking stick.” (Insert sad emoji, as Sharkchow remembers his broken lodgepole pine stick.)
Still, this little reunion with Joe is a reminder that you can take time off from the trail, then come back and still run into people you’ve met before. Because a lot of thru-hikers take time off, for one reason or another.

Levardi, a lifelong hiker, has been doing this for almost 40 years, according to the Berkshire Eagle. On Wednesday, there were four or five tents in his yard - plus Sharkchow’s hammock, strung between two posts on Levardi’s porch. 
Sharkchow also went to see the famous Cookie Lady of Dalton, but alas, she wasn’t there. As her name suggests, she bakes cookies for hikers (and lets them use her spigot), and has been doing this for decades. Another shoo-in for the Trail Angel Hall of Fame. 
While there, Sharkchow met a thru-hiker from Maine who had just returned to the trail after a five-week break. He had left the trail in Palmerton, PA - close to Hamburg, where Sharkchow had to be rescued in June - and was told by a doctor that he had multiple fractures in his feet. He had been wearing trail runners (kind of like sneakers), and was now wearing proper hiking boots. But sadly, it wasn’t working, and he was waiting to be picked up to go home. 
Sharkchow’s feet seem to be holding up, and he’s looking forward to the “big show” - crossing into Vermont and the beauty of northern New England’s mountains. He insists he’ll take those states a bit more slowly and actually enjoy the scenery.

There’s also a 93-foot lighthouse-shaped memorial up there - the Massachusetts Veterans War Memorial Tower - which Sharkchow said is “very cool.”
As soon as he arrived, he took a shower, rinsed out his clothes, and laid them out on stones to dry. In the evening, he sprang for the three-course dinner in the dining room, inquiring first as to any dress code. Jacket and tie not required, thankfully. But we’re guessing that a lack of shower would have been a deal-breaker. 
At dinner, Sharkchow had “beef something-or-other, very fancy,” salad, homemade bread, and a baked peach with sherbet and blueberries. There was a group of cyclists there; the other diners had driven up. Sharkchow was the only thru-hiker in the dining room, and was peppered with questions. One diner asked, what has been your favorite thing on the trail so far? 
“Getting picked up by my wife,” he said.
On Friday, Sharkchow will cross into Vermont, at last. “The part of the trail I really, really want to hike is Vermont through Maine,” he said. “That hike starts tomorrow.”

The Long Trail and the AT coincide for 105 miles, and Sharkchow has done 10 miles. He also passed the 1,600-mile mark on the AT, a mile and a half before crossing from Massachusetts into Vermont. 
“Vermont is somewhat different,” he said cryptically. “I suspect when I get higher, it will be much different.”
Meaning … what? “More alpine,” he finally said. 
Mount Greylock reminded him of the White Mountains, where he’s done a lot of hiking. At the top of the mountain, the trees were smaller; if the mountain had been any taller, he would have been above treeline, he said.  
It’s starting to get a little cool, at least at night. As of 11 pm Friday, in Bennington, VT (6 miles away), it was 63 degrees. Perfect sleeping weather. During the day, while doing his usual 20 miles or so, he’s still getting plenty sweaty.
Another great perk of being in northern New England is getting delicious water out of the streams. “But you have to be careful not to get water out of beaver ponds,” he says.

“It was just kind of a walk in the woods,” Sharkchow said, an inadvertent (we’re sure) reference to a funny book about hiking the AT that he did not appreciate. Because, in fact, Bill Bryson didn’t really hike the AT, he sampled it on and off for a total of 870 miles.

Some hikers take the gondola down to the resort for lunch. Not Sharkchow; he wanted to get to Spruce Peak Shelter by the end of the day. So he just hiked down the other side of the mountain. As it was, he went longer than he wanted (22.9 miles) so he could reach that shelter. 
Here’s another thing about the AT in Vermont: It can get muddy. And there’s a ton of mud there now, but it’s not a problem.
“It hasn’t really rained here for a few weeks, so the mud is the consistency of bread dough,” says Sharkchow. 
Still, he avoids stepping on it, and goes rock to rock. It’s also getting cold at night - “very nice,” he says. Tonight it’s going down into the 50s.

“Terrific place,” he said. When he arrived, he took a dip in the pond. It's always nice to “shower” before “bed” after a 22.6-mile hike.

What’s with all the rocks? “People just stack rocks,” he said. Why? “I don’t know, they just do that.” 
Maybe trail volunteers do that to clear a path for the hikers. Anything to avoid a rerun of Pennsylvania.

“I’m just below the peak of Killington Mountain,” he said. “It’s really cool here - very alpine.” 
It was also really hot - ""I'm soaked in sweat"" - as he had spent the morning climbing. Killington is the second tallest mountain in Vermont, at 4,235 feet. 
Sharkchow was planning to go to a little nearby general store for food resupply, and not further off-trail into Rutland. He’s aiming to reach Hanover, NH, on Friday.

Update: He stayed in his hammock Wednesday night at Stony Brook Shelter. Earlier in the day, he resupplied at a deli and market in the town of Killington.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620796,"Sharkchow hiked 14.7 miles Friday, and crossed the bridge from Norwich, VT, into Hanover, NH. Twelve states down, two to go. 
“Vermont is my favorite state so far,” he says, “but we’ve got New Hampshire and Maine coming up.”
On Vermont: “It’s low when you first get in - mud, beaver dams, very overgrown and jungle-like. The higher you get, the more the forest just becomes more forest-y. Eventually, when you get to Killington, it’s almost alpine. You almost reach treeline, and the trees get very small. It’s nice, because it’s cooler up high.”
At higher elevations, the forest is more developed and there’s nothing under the trees. “It’s just a big canopy, so it’s shaded,” he says.  
Vermont was also great because there are campgrounds with ponds (swimming!) and a caretaker. It costs $5 to camp at these places, but “it’s totally worth it.” The water is pristine, and good for the feet. 
Sharkchow loves New Hampshire, and has done a lot of hiking in the White Mountains - including parts of the AT. He hasn’t hiked in Maine before, other than climbing Mt. Katahdin about 20 years ago. 
News flash: He has finally figured out how to tie his boots. The big debate among hikers is “tight or loose.” Sharkchow has wide feet, and if he left the laces loose, his heels would slip and he’d get blisters. If the laces were tight, it would be uncomfortable. 
So he figured out that half-way up the tongue of the boot, there’s a loop to run the laces thru. Tie an overhand knot there, and that keeps the lower part loose, then tighten the top part. 
“It’s a small thing but it actually was very useful,” he says. He’s been doing this the last week or two. “I can’t believe it took this long to figure out.”
Mrs. Sharkchow drove up from DC on Friday and delivered new hiking boots and warmer gear, plus food resupply. We’ll take a zero Saturday, and he’ll hit the trail again Sunday.

We had two good meals at Molly’s, a classic college-town eatery on Main St., which doubles as the AT. Mrs. Sharkchow had been to Hanover before, but had never focused on the fact that the AT goes right thru downtown.

“It was a nice hike out of town,” he said. “Lots of up and down, the trail was clear.” 
He’ll be climbing Mt. Moosilauke (4,802 feet) in the next couple of days. Obviously, he’s not trying to duplicate the Dartmouth tradition of hiking the 56 miles from Hanover to Moosilauke in one 24-hour stretch, as described by a friend who did that while a student there. 
“I’m not sure where I’m staying tomorrow,” Sharkchow said. “The shelter situation is strange. They’re not spaced easily… some don’t have enough water.” 
He reports the new boots (see pic) are good. The pack is heavier, as he now has his cold-weather gear plus four days’ worth of food. But he needs that gear; it can get quite cold on this final stretch of the trail even in summer.

No one else had stopped there for the night because of inadequate water. But Sharkchow didn’t want to put in a 28-mile day. Instead, knowing Ore Hill didn’t have good water, he loaded up his bottles at a brook and schlepped 4 liters of H2O for 4 miles. That’s heavy. 
He went up and down at least two mountains Monday. Maybe more. 
“As I’m climbing and huffing and puffing, it’s ‘welcome to New Hampshire, Sharkchow,’” he said. “New Hampshire is a kick in the butt, I tell ya.”
There are times when the trail just goes straight up. No switchbacks here, like those wimpy trails out West. At least the weather was nice, high in the low 80s, but he was sweating hard - from the climbing, not the heat. On the northeastern side of these mountains, the trail is gentler. 
On top of Mt. Cube (2,911 feet), he stopped and enjoyed the view and snapped some pix. Tuesday is Mt. Moosilauke - at 4,800 feet, the first of several 4,000-footers he’ll summit in NH. Then it's on to Franconia Notch.

Usually he hangs his hammock near a shelter with a source of water and a privy, but the shelter he might have stopped at (Beaver Brook) wasn’t good. Earlier, he ran into a guy from Maine he had hiked with into Hanover, and that guy is stealth camping a bit behind him. 
The hike up Moosilauke - at 4,802 feet, the western-most 4,000-footer in NH - was challenging. Everyone had warned about the tricky descent, but going up was no picnic. Sharkchow took it very slow. “It was pretty steep and rocky,” he said.
On the way up, he passed a south-bound hiker who warned of the descent: “Don’t do it if it’s raining.” (So you just stay up there all night?) Near the top, it started to rain. Sharkchow put on his poncho, and reached the summit. 
The rain stopped. 
“Down the north side, it was sunny,” he said. “It seemed like it hadn’t rained at all.” 
As he went down, it didn’t seem too bad. But the tricky part of the descent was lower down. “It was very slippery,” he said. “It was hiker hell. It took forever, but I did it without a problem.”

In exchange for “doing what needs to be done” (the dishes?) he gets to stay for free, including dinner and breakfast. Paying customers are charged $129 per night for a bunk and two meals. “Work for stay” is a perk for thru-hikers.
Sharkchow plans to do this once, just to see what it’s like. But we can imagine he’ll get a kick out of working with the “kids” who run the place, typically college students on summer break.
When he arrived around 4 pm, the head guy offered him some mac & cheese, which he devoured. He had just hiked two mountains. In fact, today’s hike was “only” 11.6 miles, but “it was exhausting,” he said. “It was a very, very rugged trail, with steep descents.” 
Still, it was fantastic. “I love these mountains.” And the weather was gorgeous, as is the scenery. At the hut, there’s an amazing view of Franconia Ridge across the lake.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621166,"Sharkchow called this morning from beautiful downtown Lincoln, NH, to enthuse about his “work for stay” experience at Lonesome Lake Hut. First, the food: a “gigantic, heaping thing of pulled pork,” mashed potatoes, chili, salad, and cake. All you can eat. He thinks he ate an entire pound of pulled pork.
He and the other thru-hiker there, a young British guy going south-bound, stayed outside while the 45 paying guests ate, then Sharkchow and the Brit came in to gorge on leftovers. After that, they did cleanup, their “payment” for free room and board. The “room” was pretty great too. The hut manager dragged a couple of unused mattresses from a bunkroom and set them up on the dining room floor. Quite comfy. 
In the morning, Sharkchow skipped the hut breakfast, so he could hit the road early. Once off the trail, he hitch-hiked. An older couple (thru-hikers of many years ago) pulled over and took him into Lincoln. 
Lunch at McDonald’s: fish fillet, quarter pounder w/cheese, fries, diet Coke, chocolate shake. A couple hours later, he and some other hikers went to an ice cream place; Sharkchow got an extra-thick chocolate shake. Dinner from the Price Chopper: an entire roast chicken, macaroni salad, broccoli and cauliflower. Sharkchow shared the chicken with 2 other hikers, including a guy from India whose trail name is “Kaka,” which means “uncle” in Hindi. They’re in the same bunkroom tonight at Notch Hostel. 
The last 24 hours were essentially a food-a-palooza, and a little bit of hiking - just 2.8 miles on the trail. Basically, a “nero” (nearly a “zero”). Tomorrow, big important hiking begins.

From our second, evening call: He was camping at the Garfield Ridge Campsite (elevation 3,923 feet) with a whole bunch of other folks - including many he’s met earlier on the trail. 
“It’s jammed up here,” he said from his hammock. People have pitched their tents on platforms built there to lessen the environmental impact. 
It’s also chilly up there, but he’s fine in his lightweight down jacket and sleeping quilt.

But more on today. In the morning, he hiked to Rt 302 - boom, trail magic: “eggs, bacon, all kinds of stuff.” Then he got a ride up to the AMC Highland Center to pick up a resupply package from DC. The driver waited while he ran in, then drove him back to the trail - all for a smile. This act of kindness “made it possible to get to Lakes of the Clouds today,” Sharkchow said.
The hike up Webster Cliff trail sounded kind of treacherous. Something about “if you slip…” and a sleep incline. But apparently he made it. Banged his knee at some point… that’s life on the trail. You get dinged up. Still, he said, “this is amazing hiking.” 
There was no “work for stay” at Lakes of the Clouds, so he’s paying $10 to sleep on the floor with 18 other thru-hikers, “a good group.” Technically, there’s no food involved. But of course there’s food. 
“They brought out a big pot of cold scrambled eggs, plus cold sausage and cold macaroni,” he said. “We devoured it.” 
Then he ate one of his own backpacker meals, just to lighten his pack. 
As we spoke, he and the other thru-hikers were outside taking pictures of the sunset. As soon as the 47 paying customers turn in for the night, the thru-hikers will be allowed back inside and the mess hall will become a big slumber party.

He hit the trail around 6:30 a.m. - because he wanted to and he had to. Thru-hikers are supposed to leave the hut early, so the crew can get set up for breakfast for the paying customers. Lakes of the Clouds is at 5,097 feet and Washington is at 6,288. So he gained 1,191 feet of elevation in an hour.
There was a thick fog, and the winds were blowing 40-50 mph up there. Thus, no hat. 

“It was a furious wind,” Sharkchow said. 
He also summited Mt. Madison (5,366 feet) but once you’re up in the presidentials, you’re pretty much staying at high elevations. 
Tonight he’s in his hammock at Osgood Tent Site with three other thru-hikers, including a woman named “Jazz Hands.” She’s a jazz guitarist, and Sharkchow remembers hearing her play at the hostel in Woodstock, NH. She must have borrowed a guitar, as she’s not hiking with one.

The further down in elevation he could get, the safer he’d be. He could feel the air getting colder; the front was coming through. And he could see that it was raining heavily under those dark clouds. If he had to hike in a downpour, the rocks would be slippery. 
Suddenly, as if by divine intervention, the storm turned and went into the valley. “I just got the edge of it, a little sprinkling,” he said. “I didn’t even put on my rain gear.”

He was surprised to see Jay, who hikes “really fast.” How could he have not reached Katahdin yet? Turns out he did, on Aug. 15. When Jay had come thru Rattle River on his way to Maine, he hit it off with the owners, who offered him a job after he finished the trail. It was Jay who cooked the pancakes. 
“They were terrific,” Sharkchow said. 
Sharkchow also got a kick out of the “decontamination chamber” (ie, the mud room) every hiker must enter first. Boots and hiking poles stay outside, and hikers must shower before entering the house.

Sometimes the puzzle involved figuring out where to put his feet. Bottom line, he said, the guidebook was right: That section of the AT was ""both difficult and fun."" Also, “nerve-wracking.”

So here’s the deal with Mahoosuc Notch: Above one side there’s a rocky cliff, and a lot of rocks have tumbled into the ravine below. For about a mile, the trail runs right through those boulders. 
Two or three times, he had to take his pack off and slide through the rocks, pulling his pack behind him. In other places, up top, he could hop from rock to rock, and across crevasses. “If you slip or miss, buh-bye!” he said. Meaning … you’d die?! “I don’t know if you’d die, but you could get hurt badly. I was very careful.” 
When he was near the end of that stretch, he approached a woman who was crying. “My focus shifted, and I slipped and fell over, but not into anything,” he said. He wound up with a few scratches on his leg, and a skinned pinky finger. All in all, NBD. 
At one point, to keep going he had to put his butt against a nearly vertical wall and his back against an upper wall, and inch across a chasm. “That was probably the most daring part,” he said. 
At the campsite Sunday night, he had a campfire (rare for thru-hikers, so a big treat) with Big Heart and Space Jam. Monday he hiked 12.8 miles and is in his hammock at Frye Notch Lean-to. Closing in on Andover, Maine, and the resupply package that awaits him at the hiker hostel.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622073,"Sharkchow hiked the various Saddleback peaks Friday - so named, because they look like a saddle. After an 18.7-mile day, he’s in his hammock at Spaulding Mountain Lean-to. Tomorrow he’ll be “in the Bigelows” - that is, Bigelow Mountain and Little Bigelow. 
But here’s what he’s really thinking about: that hurricane. Sharkchow talked to a guy at the top of Saddleback who said, “If the storm comes up here, get off the trail.”
In fact, Sharkchow said, he wants to get out of the high mountains “before there’s any chance it comes up here.” And if the storm reaches that part of Maine, he’ll wait it out for 3-4 days. In such a storm, “the trail would become a big river,” he said. “The streams would overflow and become dangerous to cross.” 
As of Friday night, Hurricane Dorian is now a Category 4, heading right for Florida. And Sharkchow has just a little over 200 miles to go on the AT.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622120,"Sharkchow crossed the 2,000-mile mark Saturday, and kept going. Now he’s in his hammock at Horns Pond Lean-tos. The campsite is overflowing with people, this being a holiday weekend. 
“I’m basically camped in the woods between campsites,” he said. 
It’s going down to the low 40s tonite, and later in the week down into the 30s. But Sharkchow has his down “puffy” and his cold-weather sleeping quilt, so he’s fine. 
He also shared about one of his trail buddies, a guy named Pops, whom he’s been running into regularly since Hanover. Pops is about 60, and has shoulder-length hair and a big beard. He’s originally from Monmouth County, NJ (like Sharkchow) and lived many years in Florida (like Sharkchow). Pops is known for “green-blazing” - AT slang for smoking a lot of pot. 
“He walks very fast and takes a lot of breaks,” says Sharkchow. 
Back at Lakes of the Clouds, where they both slept on the floor of the mess hall, Sharkchow had helped Pops get a mattress. Pops was having back issues, and he was super grateful - and would certainly have shared his stash, but Sharkchow doesn’t smoke (anything). 
Speaking of Florida… Sharkchow was relieved to hear that Hurricane Dorian is no longer expected to make landfall in the Sunshine State. But he’s still worried about remnants that could reach Maine. That’s life on the AT - one big “cone of uncertainty.”

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622188,"Sharkchow called this afternoon from Flagstaff Lake, where he had just had a swim and rinsed out his clothes. 
“It was fantastic,” he said. It’s going to get cold tonite, so everything needs to dry fast. He was probably going to camp there tonite. We’ll assume he did. 
We also brought Sharkchow up to speed on Hurricane Dorian: now a Category 5, wreaking havoc on the Bahamas, projected path now closer to Florida than before. But his part of Florida is still not in the area of most danger, so he can stay focused on the task at hand.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622290,"Sharkchow made 16.5 miles Monday and is in his hammock at Harrison’s Pierce Pond Camps, three miles from the Kennebec River. The guidebook says about the river: “Do not ford. Use ferry service.” We hope he follows that advice. 
Today’s hike was a walk in the rain, but he didn’t seem to mind. Soon he will be in Caratunk, Maine, where a bed and a resupply package await him. 
The cell connection was bad, so we didn’t talk much - just enough to give him an update on Hurricane Dorian. 
A little under 155 miles to go.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622328,"Sharkchow took a “nero” Tuesday, hiking just 3.6 miles and landing this morning at the Caratunk House Hiker Hostel in Caratunk, Maine. The US Postal Service delivered his resupply package at 2:14 pm. Three cheers for USPS, which Mrs. Sharkchow prefers to Fedex. 
Sharkchow called mid-afternoon from the house phone at Caratunk House, as there’s no cell coverage there. It was a quick call. 
“This is a fantastic place,” he said. “It’s very, very nice and relaxing.” 
Taking a shower certainly brightens the mood. Yesterday, it was raining and wet and dreary, and he stopped at Harrison’s Pierce Pond Camps as an afterthought. He'll send pix when he's in cell range. 
Sharkchow is looking forward to spending a week going to all-you-can-eat buffets after he’s finished this hike. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves.
Just 151.2 miles to Baxter Peak on Mt. Katahdin.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622427,"Sharkchow hiked 17.8 miles Wednesday to the Moxie Bald Pond Lean-to, so he’s halfway from Caratunk to Monson - the gateway to the 100-Mile Wilderness. 
More detail on his crossing of the Kennebec River two days ago: Indeed, he did not ford the river, as instructed. The ATC pays for a guy to transport hikers across in a canoe. Sharkchow pitched in, and paddled from the front. We’re guessing it felt good to do a little paddling for a change. (The “Sharkchow” handle comes from his days of racing in a sea kayak off the Florida coast. His motto: “Stay in the boat, or you become shark chow.” He wrote a book about circumnavigating Florida and other stuff called “Without a Paddle.”)
It was kind of rainy most of the day Wednesday, and therefore slippery. The first mountain he hiked was Pleasant Mountain, a funny (to us) inversion of our DC neighborhood, Mt. Pleasant. The Caratunk hostel guy had told him to be careful on the backside of that mountain. But Sharkchow slipped anyway, and did a “safe at third” slide. “I nailed my elbow but it’s OK,” he said.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622456,"Sharkchow made it to Monson, Maine (pop. 680), mid-afternoon Thursday, and checked in to Shaw’s, the famous hiker hostel. He’ll take a zero Friday, and greet two special visitors (not Mrs. Sharkchow). He’ll also get organized for the 100-Mile Wilderness, including the 11.4-pound food resupply box from DC that arrived at Shaw’s just as he did. Thank you, Fedex. It sounds like he’ll split that supply in half, carry the first half in and have the second half delivered part-way along. 
He forded two rivers today: “You take your boots off, put on your crocs, strap your boots to your pack, and walk across. You get wet up to your mid-calf or knees.” Other rivers, the water is so low you can rock-hop.
Dinner was a visit to the BBQ place in Monson - a pulled pork sandwich and mac & cheese. Then to the convenience store for a pint of mint chip ice cream, a blueberry pie, and chocolate milk. 
The accommodations at Shaw’s sound downright luxurious: a bed with sheets and a blanket. In the morning, there’s an all-you-can-eat breakfast with blueberry pancakes, bacon, and eggs. 
He’s seen some familiar faces at Shaw’s: Promo, a guy he’s been hiking with for a while; Hollywood Tom, a guy in his 70s from Hollywood, Fla.; and ‘Cado (short for Avocado) who’s there with her boyfriend. Everyone but Sharchow is hitting the trail in the morning.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622526,"On a lovely zero day, Sharkchow got a visit from his son and his son’s boyfriend, who live in California. By sheer coincidence, they are attending a wedding in Portland, Maine, this weekend, and had time to make the drive up to Monson Friday morning. They all went out for coffee. Sharkchow, not a coffee-drinker and wanting calories, had chocolate milk. 
On Saturday, the trek thru the 100-Mile Wilderness begins, and it’s supposed to rain. But Sharkchow is unfazed. This is really the home stretch.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622573,"Hurricane Dorian - or at least the “outer, outer part” - reached Maine Saturday, and on the 100-Mile Wilderness, it sprinkled. Sharkchow didn’t even put on his raincoat. Though he did slip on a rock and isn’t happy about it. 
Sunday should be sunny and dry, good news for what is expected to be the most difficult (read: mountainous) day of the 100 Miles. 
Mornings can be tough. “It’s cold here. In the morning, it’s very, very cold, which makes it hard to get up and get going.” 
A number of people rode the shuttle from Shaw's with Sharkchow to the trail this morning, and after a 15.1-mile hike, they’re camped at Long Pond Stream Lean-to. There’s a young woman from Montreal who’s doing just the 100-Mile Wilderness and Katahdin. To hear Sharkchow tell it, she just woke up one morning and decided to go hike the 100-MW.
“She’s pretty fast,” he said. “Faster than me.” 
The trail is loaded with slippery roots, rocks, and mud. “There’s nothing easy about any of this stuff,” he said. “I’m always trying not to fall or trip or fall off a cliff.” 
He especially doesn’t like the sloping rocks with no guardrails…
Today, he forded three rivers. In one, the water was moving quickly, which made it tricky and dangerous, he said. But on the plus side, the scenery is gorgeous, including pristine ponds. 
99.4 miles to go.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622681,"Sharkchow had planned to hike 11 miles on Sunday, but oops, he did 20.8 miles.
“I got up early and just started walking,” he said. When he got to his intended destination, it was only lunchtime. To heck with that, he thought, and went on to the next shelter, the Carl A. Newhall Lean-to. 
Sharkchow had prepared himself for difficult hiking on Sunday. The Chairback Mountains are considered the toughest part of the 100-Mile Wilderness. But the Bigelows, earlier in Maine, were “substantially more difficult than anything going on here,” he said. 
The weather is cool during the day, cold at night, freezing cold in the morning. “And I’m basically walking in a T-shirt,” he says.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622690,"Sharkchow is on a roll. He hiked 26.8 miles Monday, and landed at Antlers Campsite, which is on a peninsula on Jo-Mary Lake. 
“It’s the most beautiful campsite,” he said. The guidebook says it has a two-seat privy. We’ll have to try that sometime. 
Monday morning, he knew he had a string of mountains to climb, so he got up early, and reached the top of the biggest mountain (White Cap) at 9:00 am. He also needed to reach the top of Boardman Mountain by noon, so he could call Shaw’s Hiker Hostel and have them deliver his resupply a day early, ie, Monday. 
Turns out he’s doing the 100-Mile Wilderness much faster than he expected. But at the top of Boardman’s he couldn’t reach Shaw’s, so he called Mrs. Sharkchow, who was in North Carolina for work, and she called Shaw’s. The delivery happened. Emergency averted. 
Now he has too much food, and his pack is heavy. “Tomorrow I’ll be eating all day,” he says. 
Speaking of privies... later in the day Monday, Sharkchow came upon a shelter with a brand new privy, which smelled “just like pine.” Of course he had to use it. 
51.8 miles to go.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622739,"No phone call Tuesday from Sharkchow, but he did send a bunch of pictures. So, proof of life. Here's a cool one he took Tuesday morning, which he labeled: ""My first real view of the end of the hike."" Presumably that's Mt. Katahdin in the distance. When we spoke Monday, he figured he would reach the summit on Thursday.
Update: We spoke Wednesday morning, have filled in Tuesday info. All is well, but now he probably won't summit Katahdin till Friday. It's just a matter of logistics.

Sharkchow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622782,"When Sharkchow called late this morning, he was six miles from Abol Bridge, the end of the 100-Mile Wilderness. He was planning to stay somewhere near Abol; let’s assume he did. 
He doesn’t expect to have cell coverage between now and the end of the trail. If there’s a signal at the top of Mt. Katahdin, he will call. We can only hope we’re in a position to take that call. At the very least, he promises to get someone to take his picture. 
Even though he has only 16.1 miles to go, he thinks he won’t summit Katahdin till Friday. All is well, it's just a matter of logistics. 
This morning, it rained hard, and the roots and rocks were slippery. We suspect Sharkchow is ready to finish this thing.
