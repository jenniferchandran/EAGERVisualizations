MOLASSES,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611841,"Peggy delivered me to the Amtrak station in San Antonio at about 20 minutes till 7 AM today, Sunday, April 28. Train is scheduled to leave at 7 AM and feels like it is about ready to launch. Train pulled out basically on time at 7:02 AM. Scrambled eggs, croissant, grits, bacon, coffee and orange juice for breakfast. I napped a little bit mid morning and then at 12:30 went to the dining car for lunch. I ordered a garden salad and a Dr Pepper. Tonight I’ll consider a little more food. Also I took a small cut off my smoked ring sausage that I bought in comfort for this trip. Very tasty. Dinner was Thyme Chicken, green beans, baked potato with are the fixins, tea and chocolate cake. Tonight I listened an Audible called ‘Light of the World’. Recommended. Lights out at 11 pm.",,View Entry,"Apr 28, Sun",0
MOLASSES,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612007,"Today I woke up in the train, showered and had breakfast of Raisin Bran, hard boiled egg, coffee, juice and milk. Train arrived on time in Harpers Ferry about 1130am and I was on the trail by 12:15 PM. Trail run parallel to the C&O canal towpath for a couple of miles and then went into the wilderness and uphill. The temperature was rather warm and my pack was heavy as it usually is when it is fully loaded before I’ve started consuming its food content. I really did not have lunch other than a chocolate bar. I arrived the Ed Garvey shelter at about 4:15 PM after an approximate 6 mile hike. The hike was fairly tough.  I had an elevation increase of about 1000 feet over about two miles. Lots of switchbacks and fairly rocky and the temperature at 75° was pretty warm. By the time I got to the shelter I was exhausted. I set down for a while and then walked down to the spring for water  which was an almost 1 mile round trip down and up. Tonight for dinner I had spam cooked in my frypan with tortillas cheese and mustard. Very tasty. there are about nine people at the shelter that are in a hiking club mostly from Ohio.  A brief shower came while I was already in the shelter so I didn’t get wet. It is now 7:37pm and I am about to lay down and listen to my book until I go to sleep.","

MOLASSES,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612093,"9.1 miles from Ed Garvey Shelter to Rocky Run Shelter (Maryland Shelter). Got up about 7am, had a cooked breakfast of instant oatmeal and hot tea. Left EGS at 7:50am. Had lunch on trail of tuna vacuum pack that I mixed with mayo and mustard and peanut butter crackers. Smacked on GORP(good ole raisins and peanuts) and sausage.  Trail was mostly on ridge(rocky with small elevation changes). Came across a civil war battlefield at Gathland State Park. From Park was a steep uphill for about a half mile. Today I considered having lunch at a Shelter 4 miles into hike but passed on that as Shelter was .25 mile off trail. I also decided hiking an additional 2 miles to a popular campground. My knees advised me against going any further than the RR Shelter. I was second to arrive after Redwood Rambler. So we are five. Join us are Cafee and Recon and Nitro. For dinner I had ramen and a chicken packet and water. It is now 5:50pm and I am going to bed.","

MOLASSES,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612205,"7.5 miles from Rocky run shelters to Pine knob shelter in Maryland. RRS At 8:15 and arrived PNS At 3:15 PM.  Today was a hot day for hiking with the temperature reaching and holding it 81° for a big part of the day.  When I left Rocky run shelter there were still three that left after me: Dominique from Holland, nitro and red wood rambler. They all passed me at varying times during the morning. At Dahlgren Backpack campground a couple of miles down the trail I stopped in and took a shower and refilled my water reservoir. That took about an hour. There have been several battles from the Civil War in these mountains and I came across the second one in two days at a place called Fox gap where there is a monument to one of the generals called Reno monument. I also passed through Washington Monument State Park which Washington monument was currently under some repairs so I did not go in.  On the trail I crossed over IH 40 on a footbridge. Many people had it placed locks on the chain link fence. Not sure why but Kinda reminds me of people tagging with spray paint.  So far tonight there are seven hikers at this pine knob shelter; two are a couple and they took the tent the rest are in the shelter it self. One of the Hiker’s, age 71, actually brought a guitar and has been singing now for about the last hour.  It is now 6:40 PM and I think I’m going to go lay down","Rocky Run Shelter

Hike started ruff thru a rock boulder field and many rocks thereafter. Highlight today was trail magic of cookies, candy and water. 10 at two shelters that accommodate 5 each. Today I thought seriously about taking a trip into Waynesboro and staying the night but decided to march on. Today I lost one of my crocs so one of the hikers going into Waynesboro said he would try to find a pair of camp shoes for me and bring them to camp today. Today was mostly cloudy and very humid.For the rest of the day I will prepare a meal of Ramen and chicken with dessert of Belavida crackers and honey. Also I will try to get cleaned up a little bit and change into clean clothes. My Apple Watch battery is dead, the back up battery is almost dead and my phone is at about 50% so posting for the next few days until I get charged up,probably in Fayetteville Pennsylvania, Will be brief.","Raven Rock Shelter
",Deer Lick Shelter,"May 04, Sat",9.60
MOLASSES,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612572,"13.2 miles from Deer lick shelter to Rocky Mountain shelter. Left deer lick this morning at 6:50 am and arrived Rocky Mountain shelter at about 4:30 PM. It rained a big portion of last night and was raining this morning when I started my hike. It rained all morning with some let up in the afternoon but then started again about an hour and a half before I got to camp. I was pretty much soaked all day, the trail was sloppy and at some places running with water. I did slip and fall one time but fortunately landed on fairly soft ground. I collected water at a campground park that I came to later in the morning. No collection tonight as tomorrow is only about 4 miles hike into Fayetteville Pennsylvania where I have made reservations for Monday and Tuesday night. Last night my shelter companions were stretch, grits, and head knocker. They are all about 25 to 30 years old. Head knocker is a chiropractor, stretch is an IT project manager and  Grits is works in the hospitality business. The three of them were heading in to Chambersburg Pennsylvania where there is a Hilton and grits can get them a discounted rate.For breakfast I had a cereal bar, for lunch a vacuum chicken packet and for dinner I had a Mountainhome beef stew with hot chocolate and hot tea.   Today I listened to a book called flight of the hornet and then started a book called Pompei. So far tonight in the shelter I am the only one present and do not expect anybody else to show up. There Is a bear box at this location so I put my food bag in it. It is now 7:34 PM which is sometimes referred to as Hiker midnight. Lights out.","Deer Lick Shelter

MOLASSES,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612654,"3 miles from rocky mountain shelters to US 30 and 3.2 mile Road in to Fayetteville Pennsylvania. This morning I left the shelter at 8 AM and at arrived US 30 at about 10 AM. I decided to try my hand at hitchhiking into town and in a short while a pick-up heading into Fayetteville stopped and delivered me to the hotel in Fayetteville.
I was the only Hiker at the Rocky Mountain shelter for the night. After I got up and started packing I accidentally knocked my iPhone phone off a shelf and the screen protector cracked when it hit ground. I am not sure if the iPhone screen cracked or not. UGH!  I passed on having breakfast in anticipation of a good meal in Fayetteville.
Anyway the trail went through a couple of bolder fields that I had to negotiate. Slow going. After the all-day range yesterday the trail was still sloppy but at least not streaming with water.  The primary colors I see while on the trail are green foliage, last falls brown leaves and the gray rocks and boulders.  The trail Is generally pretty evident due to the volume of traffic, nevertheless trees along the trail about every 100 yards or so are painted with a 2 x 6 white blaze to guide the way.  When there is a turn in the trail the upcoming turn is marked by two blazes with one blaze slightly above and to the left for a left turn and slightly above to the right for a right turn. There are also blue blazes similarly marked that give direction to off trail destinations such as shelters and water sources.
After I checked into the hotel I made arrangements with hotel staff to have all clothing washed, dried and folded. While waiting for the clothes I rested a bit and when they were done I walked across the road and had a delicious hamburger at the flamenco restaurant then I walked down to the Dollar General to check out If they carry the food items I will need to restock. They do so a trip to the Walmart is not necessary.  For the rest of the day I will be sorting and arranging the things I carry in my pack. When hiking things become somewhat unorganized.","Rocky Mountain Shelter

MOLASSES,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612785,"ZERO miles today as I am in Fayetteville Pennsylvania resting and restocking.  I had a nice breakfast of bacon and eggs and a spaghetti dinner.  
I spent a fair amount of time today arranging for a driver to shuttle me to the trail north of Fayetteville and I will walk south back to Fayetteville without my pack. Then on Thursday the driver Will deliver me to the same location that I Started from on Wednesday. This time I will walk north, again without my pack, to a hotel where Where my driver will have delivered my pack and I have a reservation in a town called boiling Springs Pennsylvania. Hiking the trail without the pack is called ‘slack-packing’.  The idea of course is to cover more miles without the burden of a 35-38 pound backpack.","Fayetteville

MOLASSES,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612901,"19.3 miles from Pine Grove Furnace SP to AT trail head near Fayetteville Pa. Robert, aka Junker, picked me up at hotel at 6:30 am and delivered me at 6:50 am to my slackpack hike start. Hiking temp excellent: 57° start,  cloudy most all day and never got hot. 
Hiking in a cool rain is preferable over days where temperatures are around 80°. Of course the problem with hiking in the rain is that your shoes and socks get damp which results in friction causing blisters.  
And I do have a blister. It is on my right foot on the toe pad next to my smallest toe. It is rather painful but I have been treating with Neosporin, mule skin and Band-Aids to prevent infection.  Hiking without the pack is less pressure on my toe. Blisters suck!  I came across one guy at a shelter that was hobbling so I gave him a Band-Aid and some tape that should help his case. 
Hiking south I came across many northbound hikers. Some the hikers I met were Katie f, Squeaker and Red both f, Woody, Freebird, Iowa, Headknocker f, Grits, Stretches, Posi, Hotdog,  and a  32-year-old northbound through Hiker. Hotdog, and Jet f. F is female.
Without the pack I averaged 2 mph.  Took me 9+ hours. After I was picked up and delivered to my hotel I rested, showered, change clothes and hitchhiked for a lasagna dinner which was very good and then hitchhiked back. Got back to hotel at about 8 pm.
Fayetteville is a small town on hwy 30. The people I have seen in town are mostly overweight, many with tattoos and fully bearded.  It’s getting late so I am going to turn in.

MOLASSES,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613008,"19.3 northbound slackpack miles from Pine Grove Furnace SP to Boiling Springs PA.  Highlights was meeting Poodle hiking AT with owner. Does 10 miles per day. He’s 2. Other highlight was Rock Maze. Tight fit in places and had to do some boulder climbing. Glad I was slackpacking. Arrived hotel about 6pm after short detour. 
Breakfast was a cereal bar, lunch was a tortilla with peanut butter and honey on a tortilla and dinner was leftover lasagna. Dinner was the best meal today.
Heavy rain for about an hour today that made trail sloppy, slippery and swampy. It’s now 10:15 PM and I’m ready for bed.","Pine Grove Furnace SP PA

MOLASSES,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613310,"15 miles from Boiling Springs Pennsylvania to Madison Road Pennsylvania Where i had arranged earlier in the day for a shuttle to pick me up and take me 10 miles into Duncannon. The famous hiker Hotel in Duncannon is called the Doyle Hotel. I looked at a couple of it’s rooms and decided not to stay there even though it’s nightly charge was half of what I paid at a hotel called the red carpet in.
Trail was slippery, sloppy and swampy.  Rained again today but not much. Todays highlight was a Chambers family graveyard in what seem like the middle of nowhere that had some tombstones over 200 years old. There was one very long wooden footbridge, perhaps as long as 60 to 70 yards, over a swampy area and later two stiles that were built for hikers to get over pasture fences.  Along time ago somebody somehow drove a truck, probably from the 1920s, halfway up the hill and that’s where it died and rusted.  Its bumper was now being enveloped by the trunk of the tree it rested again.  Would love to know the story of the vehicle and the people that left it halfway up an Appalachia mountain. 
Breakfast was leftover lasagna, lunch was a serial bar and peanut butter and dinner was pizza I had delivered to my hotel room. 
Took a hot bath, Watched a little TV. Lights out",,PA 850,"May 10, Fri",15
