Running Nose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611622,"Here is my planned itinerary.
Based on my last section hike this will probably evolve into something very different as my hike progresses, but hey, you got to start somewhere!  If things go great I could make it to Duncannon, PA which would be about 125 miles total.  I wouldn't bet your life on it though.  This plan seems pretty reasonable considering my past hiking trips and current fitness level.
BTW, this image is the cover of a book by Gary Sizer based on his thru hike of the AT.  I've listened to the book on audio a couple of times through.  Very enjoyable.  I'd recommend it.

Running Nose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612273,"It’s been almost a year since my last overnight backpacking trip so I am doing a little overnight, out-and-back trip to shake off the cobwebs and make sure my gear is all still in working order.  I’ve planned a 12.9 mi hike (each way) on the AT just north of Duncannon, PA. I’ll start at Peters Mountain Rd trailhead (AT NoBo mile 1157.1) aiming to camp at the intersection of the Horsehoe Trail with the AT. 
I got my stuff sacks all packed and my backpack ready to go last night.  I picked up a few last food items and found my missing headlamp today and I'm ready to go first thing tomorrow morning.  My pack weighs in at 29.2 lbs without water.  
Weather reports are not great. 30% chance of showers Saturday with 100% chance of rain overnight, then 70% chance of rain Sunday.  On the bright side, it’s good weather to test my gear and prep!",,View Entry,"May 03, Fri",0
Running Nose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612424,"It thunder-stormed last night and was raining off and on as I drove the 50 minutes from home to the Peters Mt parking lot for my 12.9 mile (each way) out-and-back overnight shakedown hike on the AT.  The rain stopped as soon as I hit the trail and didn’t return.  A great stroke of luck.
 I strapped on my pack around 8:30am, stopped at the Peters Mt Shelter to take a quick break and use the privy around 9:30am, stopped for lunch and rest around 12, descended to Clark Creek and began the 1,100ft ascent to my campsite arriving around 4:00pm.
That’s 12.9 miles in 7.5 hours or about 1.75 mi/hr with breaks included. Not too shabby (for me).
As I write this at 7pm it has started drizzling. There are two thru-hiker couples camping here tonight as well as a guy my age on a section hike. One of the couples are both dressed in purple head-to-toe and are sporting purple gear. Awesome!  I think they may be calling themselves the purple people. 
So far I’m feeling fine and the feet are both okay - just a little sore but no blisters.  Hopefully the trend continues on my way back out tomorrow.
Forecast is for rain this evening and tomorrow morning.  Yeah. I get to test out the hammock and rain gear. This IS a shakedown hike after all!",,View Entry,"May 04, Sat",0
Running Nose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612587,"Last nite the purple people couple graced the campsite with some absolutely  beautiful music.  He played a ukulele (I think) and she played a small zylaphone and sang.  What a treat to have on the top of a mountain on the AT!
It rained pretty steadily all night but I slept well in my hammock with my earplugs, eventually climbing into my sleeping bag to ward off a bit of chill.  The rain continued unabated through most of the day.
I ate breakfast and was packed up and on the trail by 8:30am to head back to my car.  I took a few short breaks along the way, stopped to filter some water, ate lunch and took my last break at Peters Mountain shelter.  There I met a section hiker who had come from Harpers Ferry WV (the starting point for my upcoming section hike).  He was spending a month on the trail.  I also met a thru hiker- Forget-Me-Not - who uses a Hennessy Hammock like me.  He was in the shelter updating his journal on www.trailjournals.com  I’ll have to check it out.
Soon after leaving the shelter I met a thru hiker named Good Samaritan.  He advised me to always remember ABCDEFGH - Always  Be  Chewing, Drinking, or Eating For a Good Hike!  He had lost 20lbs so far, but true to his credo he was chowing down on a sports bar when we met.
I arrived back at my car at 4:30pm - 12.9 miles in 8 hrs or 1.6 mi/hr with breaks included. A little slower than yesterday but with the rain I found I had to check my speed on large flat rocks to avoid slipping.  And there were no shortage of those on this section of trail.
Overall I am pleased with the way my gear performed.  My Tulley Airflo hat did eventually get soaked by the afternoon and occasionally water dripped in my eyes - wipe forehead with bandana, problem solved (for awhile anyway).  The temps were cool enough that I did not get sweaty in my REI rain jacket.  My mid calf gaiters kept the bottom of my pants dry and mud-free.",,View Entry,"May 05, Sun",0

my  gear was scattered like crumbs by a mouse. 
I gathered my things all into my pack,
and weighed them to see if it would all break my back!  
I went through my list and checked it all twice,
and prayed that the weather would be very nice!
At last I sat down to update my journal,
Looking forward to trail angels and woodlands most vernal.
Well, my full pack weighs in at 34 lbs with no water - 7.6 lbs is my food bag packed for 5 days.  I have a mail drop to resupply at what I expect will be my halfway point.
Tomorrow morning my wonderful wife and I will head to Harpers Ferry.  We plan on doing a bit of horseback riding at a nearby establishment, http://www.elkmountaintrails.com/, and visit the ATC headquarters in Harpers Ferry.  Then she’ll head home and I’ll hit the trail north.  Can’t wait!",,View Entry,"May 17, Fri",0

As I write this it is almost 10pm. Well past hiker midnight as they say on the trail. So I will try to keep it brief. 
Carrie and I had a great day today. We arrived in Harpers Ferry a little after 10am and visited the ATC headquarters. I got my picture added to the book of 2019 AT hikers. Then we did some horseback riding. I hadn’t rode a horse in 45 years - man I’m getting old!  But that was great fun.
We headed back to Harpers Ferry around 2:30pm for a late lunch.  Harpers Ferry was really packed with humans. We were both a bit hangry but eventually got some food and coffee and things were right with the world again. 
Carrie dropped me off at the old arsenal building which is right were the AT crosses the Potomac River, we said our goodbyes and I hit the trail!
The first four miles of the trail heading north from Harpers Ferry follow the old historic C&O Canal trail. This is probably the easiest four miles of the entire 2,200 mile AT!  Perfectly level and paved with finely crushed and compacted gravel it was a dream to walk on I did it in about 50 mins or about 4.8 miles per hour!
Needless to say my pace slowed to a crawl when the trail turned into the woods and began climbing about 1,000ft over a mile and a half.  Maybe the horseback riding had tired me out, but for whatever reason my butt was dragging when I reached my destination for the night - Ed Garvey Shelter around 7pm.
The water source for the Shelter is a nice piped spring, but the side trail to it leads seemingly all the way back down to the bottom of the mountain!  Still, it was a lot easier to do without a pack on.
There are some Boy Scouts here tonight and they started a smokey fire, the smoke from which has decided to follow the prevailing winds right into my hammock!  My eyes are burning.  Hopefully the darn thing will burn itself out soon!
I’m sleeping without my rain fly tonight.  The weather report looks okay but you never really know.  Guess I'll find out if I wake up to rain drops!  Good night all.","Harpers Ferry WV

Running Nose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613952,"From Ed Garvey Shelter (AT mile 1031.8) to Dahlgren Backpackers Campground (AT mile 1042.7).
I woke around 6:30am today.  I had my trail breakfast- a cliff bar and a vanilla protein shake with a packet of Starbucks instant coffee. Shaken, not stirred. No olives. ;)
I was all packed up and on the trail with two liters of water by 7:30am. The morning was cool and misty at times but no rain. Most of the morning was spent hiking with a tall natural wall of huge stones about 100ft off the trail to my right. Pretty cool. 
I stopped at a nice outlook with an unobstructed view of the mountain I had just hiked earlier.  There I ate a lunch of turkey jerky and did some blister foot care. 
My feet are beginning to slow me down today.  
The afternoon was sunny with cotton ball clouds and temps in the high 80s.  Humidity was not bad and it was cooler under the trees, which is where I was 90% of the time. 
The trail today was rocky in most places with a few muddy section mixed in just to prevent boredom. 
Early in the day I passed through Maryland’s Gathland State park and took advantage of the public restrooms and water to top off my water bottles. I saw a guy in a confederate civil war uniform walking through the parking lot. Throughout the day I would hear the boom of a large cannon. There must be weekend re-enactments going on. There are a good deal of civil war battlefields in the area. 
I arrived at Dahlgren Backpackers Campground around 2:15pm. My body was ready to keep going but my feet objected strenuously. I set up camp and took a little nap. 
It turns out my feet made a good call. There is a fancy restaurant a short walk from the campground - South Mountain Inn - that doesn’t turn away stinky hikers. I had an early dinner of crab soup, chicken saltimboca, fettuccini Alfredo, and a nice berry pie with ice cream. This hiking deprivation is really hard!  ;)
It’s 7:20pm as I finish writing this journal entry. Weather tonight is calling for a chance of thunderstorms. I have the rainfly up over my hammock and I am listening to the birds and occasional thunder in the distance.  Nice.","Ed Garvey Shelter

Running Nose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614048,"From Dahlgren Backpackers Campground (AT mile 1042.7) to stealth camp beyond Pogo Memorial campsite (AT mile 1053.9).
I was on the trail by about 9am this morning after breakfast and some foot care. 
The trail passed thru Washington Monument State park early on.  I took advantage of the restrooms and water. Unfortunately the monument was closed. Looks like they’re doing some maintenance on it.  FYI  this was the original monument before they built the one in D.C.
It was slow going in the morning, the Tylenol I packed was not taking the edge off my blisters. At the intersection of route 40 I got a Lyft ride to a local Sheetz and picked up the last bottle of Ibuprofen they had. The driver was great. Let me charge my phone and waited to give me a ride back to the trail. I was sitting by the side of the road getting my stuff in order when I realized I left my phone in his car!  Aaaaah!  30 seconds later he was back to return it.  Lucky me!
A couple of ibuprofen did the trick and I was moving with just a bit of discomfort to remind me to not over do it. 
I uploaded a lot of photos today. Check them out if you’re curious. 
At one point today the AT actually ran through someone’s backyard before crossing the six lane divided I70 highway on a footbridge. Crazy!
Soon after I came across what is called Trail Magic by the hiker community. Some kind soul left a large container full of individually packaged snacks for AT hikers to take just because.
I climbed up, up, up, and took a short side trail to visit Annapolis Rocks which is a rocky and precipitous drop off with some pretty views.  I ate lunch and watched the young day hikers take selfies near the edge.  Not me!
I reached my originally planned destination - around 3pm. Pogo Memorial  campsite. I cameled up with 4 liters of water and decided to continue on for a bit more.  The trail climbed to a rocky ridge line and I made it about 2 1/2 miles more before finding a spot I could set up my hammock around 5pm.
I fussed around picking a good site to tie up the hammock, making sure to avoid proximity to any widow makers (standing dead trees).  The wind has been blowing strong here tonight.
Finally I got settled in and had a nice dinner of pepper steak with rice, dehydrated of course, and hung my food bag out of the reach of any curious critters.
My hammock is set up on a ridge tonight not far from the trail. As I’m writing this I hiker Just passed by, I could hear the clicking of his trekking poles and see the beam of his headlamp in the darkness. Man!  I had a hard enough time getting over the rocks and boulders in the daylight!  Clearly he must have been a thru hiker.

From stealth camp beyond Pogo Memorial Campsite (AT mile 1053.9) to Falls Creek campsite (AT mile 1066.9).
Last night after I updated this journal, three more hikers speed by in the darkness with their headlights blazing. The last was singing at the top of her lungs, oblivious to my presence!  Awesome!  [Post edit:  These people were likely AT thru hikers doing the 4 state challenge.  The AT passes through four states - VA, WV, MD, and PA - in 40 some miles.  Some hikers try to do these miles in a single 24 hour period - the four state challenge.]
I didn’t sleep well with the blowing wind snapping my rain fly like flag in a gale, even with my ear plugs.
It got a bit chilly too. I have a sleeping bag rated for 15 degrees Fahrenheit. That means that you won’t die from hypothermia at that temp, not that you’ll be toasty warm. I wasn’t shivering or anything but I could feel the cold on the bottom of my bag from contact with the hammock. Wind chill!
I got up and was packed and on the trail by 7:30am.  I passed through lots of different landscapes today: Boulder scrabbles, rocky stretches, stream crossings, large rock formations, grassy meadows, parks, road crossings, railroad tracks, and even around residential houses!
I stopped for a morning break at Ensign Cowall Shelter and ate lunch at the Cascades - a small waterfall streaming down a rock wall with all kinds of big rock formations in the area. 
I met “Sharp Shin” today.  He is a SoBo (south bound) thru hiker. I believe he may have a trail journal online. I’ll have to check it out. 
I made to Pen-Mar Park for dinner near the MD-PA border.  I was motivated by the prospect of takeout food delivered to my park bench and I practically ran the last mile, arriving around 5pm. Indeed it was not just a fevered hiker dream, 40 minutes later I had a meatball parmigiana sandwich, a coke, and a hunk of cheese cake. They forgot napkins and a fork, but hey, I have two hands and i was not going to be deterred. 
I had a nice conversation with an older guy in a golf cart who was apparently a park custodian. We compared dinners. He had a apple and a yogurt. I think I won!  After scarfing down that heavenly mana, I headed to the restrooms to fill my water bottles and was back in the trail by 6pm with just a mile to go for my destination for the night. 
I crossed the Mason-Dixon Line and was at the Falling Creek campsite by 6:30pm. My hammock was strung up and my bear bag was hung and I was settling down for the night when I realized I had left my water bottles back in the restroom at Pen-Mar Park!  Crap!!!  I strapped on my considerably lighter backpack, grabbed my trekking poles and hoofed it back over the state line as fast as my weary legs would move. 
I did it in 15 minutes this time and it was mostly up hill!  I arrived at the park restroom just as the old caretaker was getting ready to lock it up for the night!  Whew!  Crisis averted.
Back across the state line to PA.  An extra 2 miles today that don't count spent running in circles.","Stealth camp ~2 mi N of Pogo Campsite

Running Nose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614267,"From Falls Creek campsite (AT mile 1066.9) to Rattlesnake Run Road (AT mile 1073.9).
I slept well last night but it was a bit chilly - probably low 40’s. Because of the cold air on the hammock surface my bottom half was a bit chilly while my topside was toasty warm. I have a reflector insert for the hammock for just these conditions. It’s back home right now because I thought we would be getting lows in the mid 50’s at worst. Oh well.  ;)
I was packed up and on the trail around 7:30am. I am planning a short day today so I can catch a ride to the Fayetteville P.O. to pick up my resupply box and get a motel room for the night. 
My feet are doing a little better today. But it still takes a morning “tune up” to get my blisters in the mood for hiking. I start out gingerly stepping, leaning heavily on my trekking poles, hobbling down the trail but I slowly pick up speed. After a bit of moving the blisters seem to realize that nobody is listening and they quiet down for the ride.  At this point, going up is much easier on the feet than the pounding associated with the downgrades. If I stop for any length of time I have two begin this training process again from the start.  But enough whining.
The woods of southern PA have a subtle uniqueness to them that speak of home to me. It is really beautiful to just walk through the hemlocks and pines listening to nothing but the birds and occasional  burbling water. The constant creaking of your pack straps and the sound of stones crunching under feet fade into the background. You can really zone out. Like, woah dude. Totally. ;)
When I reached PA route 16 I had to wait for the right moment and dash across Frogger-style to avoid the cars and trucks barreling down the road in both directions!
Soon after I passed through a picturesque thicket of mountain laurel and stopped to get water at a nearby spring around 9:30am. 
I passed through a few muddy sections today but on the whole the path I walked had a healthy portion of relatively smooth trail.  A nice change from the previous day in Maryland. 
I arrived at the AT trailhead on Rattlesnake Rd near the Old Forge picnic area around 11:30am. This was the spot I had planned to get get off the trail and get a ride to Fayetteville for the night. My cell coverage hovering between one and two bars. My phone battery was at 18% and dropping. Not great but good enough to get a ride, right?  After screwing around with the Lyft and Uber apps for 20 mins and finding neither had any drivers available, I tried several of the shuttle services listed in the AT Guide, but all where too far away to be feasible. Around 12:30 I decided I was out of alternatives. 
Hmmm. I’ve never hitch hiked before, but there’s gotta be a first time for everything, right?  The percentage of the population that drives around on backwoods roads looking to due harm a to stranger they might encounter has got to be pretty low, right?  Heck, the number of strangers said deviant might encounter on such outings has got to be so low as to cause said deviant to look for more fruitful pastures, right?
With no other recourse, I started hoofing it up the road in the direction I wanted to go and turned around and stuck my thumb out whenever I heard a car approaching. Several passed before a young lad stopped to give me a ride. He said he liked to drive the winding roads in the area listening to music on his lunch break. He took me a ways up the road before he had to drop me off so he could get back to work. 
More hoofing it with occasional backwards walking smiles and outstretched thumb for passing cars. Eventually a car passed but slowed and stopped down the road. I ran up the road to greet them. They said they could drop me off at route 30 but were heading east from there. They wanted to know if I was an ax murderer and I laughingly said no.  As we conversed about hiking, family, home, and the AT the two sisters eventually decided to go out of their way to take me to the Fayetteville P.O., and since I was staying at the Rite Spot Motel (Scottish Inn) we passed on the way to the P.O. they offered to wait and drop me off at the motel because they were heading that way also. They refused any money for gas. There are some very generous people out there. Thanks ladies. 
I was at the motel by 1:30pm. I immediately got a nice long shower and cleaned up. The motel washed my stinky laundry for 10 bucks and delivered it to my room.  They will probably shuttle me back to where I got off the trail today, but still waiting to hear on that. Nice. 
I’m having trouble with the motel WiFi and AT&T cell data coverage here so I haven’t been able to upload any pictures from yesterday or today. 
I ordered a pizza and I’m going to watch some TV while I go thru my resupply box.  Good night folks.","Falls Creek campsite

Running Nose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614356,"From Old Forge Park (AT mile 1073.6) to Rocky Mountain Shelters (AT mile 1081.3).
After getting a morning shower and soaking my legs and feet in a nice hot tub for 20 minutes, I packed up the rest of my gear, stuffed some leftover pizza in my pack and headed to the motel office to catch my 9am ride to the post office and back to the trail. 
At the post office I heard the chirping of birds from behind the counter. When I asked the clerk she said, “Oh, those are pigeon chicks. We get them in here probably twice a week.”  Okay. 
Back to the trail. After the P.O. the owner of the Rite Spot motel (Scottish Inns) drove me the twenty minutes back to the trail and left me off at Old Forge Park. This was just a bit further south then where I’d left the trail yesterday, but I forgot to fill up my water bottles back at the motel and I knew I could do so with the clean park water right by the AT there. 
I mixed my vanilla protein shake and Starbucks coffee packet breakfast in my water bottle and had finished munching down a honey bun before I got back to the road crossing where I’d left the trail yesterday. 
My feet are definitely feeling better.  No hobbling ramp up to hiking speed required today. 
The woods in Micheaux State Forest are really beautiful. Dotted with pines and hemlocks, mountain laurel and blueberry thickets not yet with berries. 
Around 11:15am I took the side trail to Chimney Rocks for lunch and ate the two slices of leftover pizza I brought from the motel. What a view. The rocks themselves are stunning and form a giant natural chimney of sorts which looks out to a small lake and a forested ridge in the distance. Definitely worth the climb up from Old Forge Park.  And definitely worth the short side trail detour from the AT.
I was walking again by noon. In the early afternoon I began to hear the rumble of thunder. I quickened my pace in attempt to beat the rain to the shelter up ahead, I had to eventually stop and put the rain cover on my pack. It rained for a bit but not too hard. I didn’t get very wet and it was actually refreshing. I love the smell when rain first starts to fall. 
By the time I arrived at the Rocky Mountain Shelters the rain had pretty much stopped. I dropped my pack in one of the shelters and headed down, down, down the side trail to the get water from the nearby spring.  Someone had removed the back of a Busch beer can, widened the mouth, and placed it so the main water flow from the spring issued from the can!  Funny!
At the shelter I met a fellow section hiker named Dodge O. In my race to the shelter earlier I had passed a woman with the trail name Nay Nay in her seventies who is hiking to the Whites in New Hampshire, and a young woman called Pink Socks. They both soon arrived at the shelter.
I began my quest for the perfect pair of trees to hang my hammock and was soon all set up. 
It turns out Nay Nay was a computer programmer back in the day and loved assembly language programming.  Dodge O also had experience with programming and we talked a bit of shop for a while. Pink socks is doing a six week hike.  We all had pleasant conversation and seemed to enjoy each other’s company. Maybe we’ll run into each other again out on the trail.","Old Forge Park

[I had no cell service at Birch Run Shelter tonight  so I wrote this entry offline and will up load it along with the days pics when I get covertage]
I was roused from my sleep around 5:30am thinking, “What kind of jerk is setting of firecrackers in the woods this early in the morning?!”  There was very loud BOOM as I realized a tree was falling and it hit the ground. I’m glad I checked all the trees surrounding my hammock for large dead limbs and standing dead trees. Word to the wise:  ALWAYS look up around your tent or hammock site and don’t set up near dead wood. There are a lot of standing dead trees in the woods because of past insect and fungal invasive species depredations and a dead tree does not always look dead at the ground level.  Nuf said. 
I had breakfast, packed up, wished Nay Nay well, and was on the trail by 7:30am.  Dodge O has already departed and Pink Socks was still sleeping.  It was a truly glorious day today, temps in the mid 60’s and low 70’s with wonderful breezes and sunny skies. Perfect hiking weather. 
Early in the morning I encountered a section of boulders I had to pick my way through and scrabble over. It was a fun little challenge. 
I soon crossed over PA route 30, waiting for my break in the traffic and jogging across.  This road runs east to my hometown of Lancaster, PA. I am kind of in my home turf now. I’ve done several hiking and backpacking trips in this area before. 
On the other side of 30 the trail enters Caledonia State park - a real treasure. I came across a wonderfully aromatic wild rose bush right there. The trail was detoured east on the Trolley trail, perhaps due to some maintenance project, but rejoined the AT after a short distance. 
After leaving the gravel paths of the park the trail began a big climb from about 900 ft to over 2,000 ft.  The trail passes through towering rhododendrons literally forming a green tunnel. The rhododendrons here have their new light green spring growth leaves but haven’t started to blossom yet. In a month or so this will be filled with purple and white magnificence!
The green tunnel widens to allow space for the Quarry Gap Shelter. This is without a doubt the most lovingly and meticulously maintained AT shelter I have yet seen. There is a picket fence and potted flowers, a porch swing, a sundial and a beautiful deep clear spring runs just feet in front of the shelter. Oh and the wooden duckie cutouts are awesome.  A hanging sign proudly declares that the shelter is maintained by “Innkeeper” Jim Staunch. I have to say, kudos to you sir, and a hearty and heartfelt thank you!
The trail spent a good amount of time meandering through conifers today. Often there was a carpet of pine needles and the heavenly sent of pine in the air. 
I ate my lunch of turkey jerky around 11:30am just after one of the power line crossings on the trail. 
My feet had a good day and I hiked without and pharmacological assistance (I.e. pain relievers).
I took a short afternoon break at the bottom of a steep hill where the trail passes the Milesburn cabin on a conveniently located bench by the stream crossing there. 
The trail passed through a section of forest that had just been logged. They rarely clear cut anymore, instead leaving some trees standing in the harvested area but spaced out. I wouldn't call myself a tree-hugger but having recently listened to the book, “The Hidden Life of Trees”, I was disheartened to see this. Especially right on the AT. Trees are communal lifeforms which depend on their roots connecting to other trees through fungal networks. Sister trees actually help their neighbors who are stressed or wounded by sending them nurishment through these root connections. When a tree has no neighbors that can help it through a bad year it is more susceptible to disease and insects. This is one reason why the trees in our “managed” forests rarely live to be 100.
I arrived at my destination, the Birch Run Shelter, around 3pm. I filtered water and briefly soaked my feet in the ice cold brook that runs in front of the shelter, then I wandered about looking for a suitable spot to hang my hammock. It was soon time for dinner and I fired up the JetBoil stove and had my ziplock freezer baggie of beef stroganoff with a desert of butter flavored waffle cookies and a big mug of cinnamon black tea. 
Dodge O, one of the hikers I met at yesterday’s shelter is also spending the night here. A gaggle of young weekend hikers arrived at the shelter as I was finishing dinner. They’re competing to see who can build the biggest fire. I’m sure they’ll be up late, but hey, I’ve got earplugs baby!
My food bag is hung from one of the steel bear poles here at the shelter and it’s 8pm as I finish writing this.  It was an fantastic day. Heading to pine Grove Furnace tomorrow - home of the half gallon challenge. If you eat an entire half gallon of ice cream in under one hour you get a free wooden spoon!  We’ll see how I’m feeling about this when I get there. Night all.","Rocky Mountain Shelters

Today was a day for snakes. No worrisome encounters but I did see a couple. First, I saw a timber rattlesnake in the woods near the privy this morning. He wasn’t rattling just laying there chilling out. Pretty cool. I got a pic and uploaded it if you want a peek. This afternoon at a high rock overlook someone pointed out a copperhead curled up in the rocks. I got a pic of this fella too. And lastly, while hanging my food bag I found a full length snake skin (without the snake in it).
Before leaving the shelter this morning I warned two guys hiking with a dog about the rattlesnake. Their pooch was the spitting image of my mutt Ivy - coloring, build, size, and temperament but male not female. I saw them several times throughout the day. 
I hit the trail around 8am this morning. It was another picture perfect day with fantastic weather.
Early in the day the trail passed through a more open section for about a half mile where the fragrance of wild roses was wafting around on the cool morning breezes.  Most excellent.
I took a break at Toms Run Shelter around 10am. The trail to and from this shelter was very wet. At some points you are literally hiking in what seems like a stream, moving from rock to rock. 
The trail around Pine Grove Furnace State park is true to the name. You are walking through groves of pines. 
The trail takes a short walk on roadway and passes by the Iron Masters Mansion which is a hostel for hikers.  A few steps further up the road I stopped for lunch at Pine Grove Furnace General store and had a bacon cheeseburger and a large dish of mint moose tracks ice cream. 
This establishment is the host of the Half-Gallon-Challenge. In celebration of reaching the halfway point in the AT, hikers will try to eat an entire half gallon of ice cream. If they finish in under an hour they get a cheap crap wooden ice cream spoon to memorialize the achievement. The record time is under 5 minutes!  There were several hikers attempting the feat when I left. I hope they have plenty of TP just in case!
I had planned to upload yesterday’s journal from the store but I got no cell coverage. Damn.
The Appalachian Trail museum is just a few hundred feet up the street from the store. I stopped in to look around.  There's some cool memorabilia there especially if your into the AT and hiking. I love the photo of Grandma (Gates?  her names not coming to me), one of the early hikers to do the entire AT. The photo shows her with all her gear in the sack she just slung over her shoulder and trudged up and done mountains with for 2,200 miles! Now that’s tough. Her first baby probably came out sideways and she didn’t scream or nothing!
The trail meanders through the park for a bit. There were plenty of picnickers out on this Memorial Day weekend.  A couple of thru hikers I met back at the store took a half hour to soak their sore feet and ankles in the lake here, part of which allows swimming. 
The trail leaves the park and begins climbing up for about 2.5 miles. Along the way up I stopped at a spring to “camel-up” on water because I’m not camping at a shelter with a water source tonight. 
Soon afterward I took the side trail to the Pole Steeple overlook. I left my pack at the bottom of the rocks and headed up and out onto them to take in the view.  It is definitely a very nice view and I got several pictures. I was also able to get a phone signal and was finally able to touch base with the home fort. 
My planned destination was a tent site not far from the Pole Steeple side trail. When I got there I discovered a “widow maker” dead tree standing perfectly straight up and with a line to drop on every viable hammock site I found. I decided that perhaps the trail gods where speaking to me the other morning when I was awoken by a falling tree and decided to press on in hopes of finding a better spot down the trail. And, perhaps a mile or so later, I found a decent spot to stealth camp just off the trail where the odds of not being crushed were considerably more favorable. 
I was settled in and cooking dinner by 5pm under the cover of my rain fly when it began to drizzle for a bit.   It has stopped for the moment but I can occasionally hear a thunder clap in the distance and it “feels” like some rain is likely tonight.","Birch Run Shelter

I slept like a baby last night, about 11 hours!  This morning I had eaten, packed up and broke camp by 8:30am. 
I stopped at the James Fry Shelter for a break around 10am. I finally had cell coverage and decided to call my lovely wife with a status update and take some time to upload my photos and journal entries from the last several days. 
As I was on the phone, a gaggle of young children appeared at the shelter. One asked in an incredulous tone, “Do you LIVE here?!”  Their parents soon caught up. “It’s best to give them stopping points like this ‘cabin’ and we can catch up rather than running after them the whole way.”
I ate lunch and went to filter some water at the shelter’s spring, and the family had moved on.  I passed them soon after I rejoined the AT at a wooden bridge stream crossing. 
Soon after, the trail crosses Pine Grove road and walks for a stretch on a nice smooth and level path which looks like an old railroad bed. There are fens and bogs on either side of the trail. The trail eventually took a turn and crossed a working railroad track complete with several cars sitting on a side track. 
Around 1pm it was beginning to get warm and I began to hear the rumble of thunder.  When the first drops began to fall I stopped to put on my pack’s rain cover and put my phone in it’s waterproof case. It never seems to feel like it rains as hard in the woods as it does out in the open.  The woods darkened and the temperature began to drop. Eventually it was raining hard with lightning and thunderclaps rolling from my left to right as I walked in the downpour. It was invigorating and cooled me down wonderfully.  It was all over in a half an hour and I began drying out as I walked.
Later, the trail climbed steeply up to a section a mammoth rocks. This was really cool. The trail goes over, around, up, and through them like a bit of an obstacle course. At one point I had to take off my pack and put it and my trekking poles up on a ledge in order to climb up myself!  When I did a section hike on the AT through NJ and NY there was a bit of this sort of thing around the famous “lemon squeezer”, but IMHO this particular section in Pa far exceeds what I encountered in NY. As far as I can tell this little gem is not even named. 
I made it to the shelter around 6:30pm and have good cell coverage to night. I put up my hammock and was joined by two other hikers here tonight. Tomorrow is a short 4 mile hike and I’ll meet my wife in Boiling Springs to wrap up this excellent adventure.","Campsite beyond Pole Steeple

I am writing this from the comfort of my home after showering, napping, and having a Five Guys burger and fries with a pint of Ben and Jerry’s ice cream. 
I woke this morning to yet another glorious day.  Truly the trail gods have smiled on me this entire hike.  By 8am I had eaten, packed up and hit the trail. Today was a short walk to Boiling Springs where I would meet my trail boss and wonderful wife, and end this fantastic section hike. 
Early on there was a climb to the top of Center Knob Point with some nice but partially obscured views through the trees on the way up. At the top there is a AT plaque. I’m not sure, but perhaps at one point in the past this may have been the midpoint of the trail. 
The trail walked down from the peak and exited the woods to walk through pastures and farmland. Some very nice and wide open bucolic views along the way. At one point through the fields there was a very wet area and I could not avoid getting my shoes and socks soaked. I stopped soon after to ring out my socks and continued on. 
The trail soon entered Boiling Springs proper, crossing a bridge and walking by a flowing creek festooned with fisherman of all varieties out on this Memorial Day holiday. I stopped there at a parking lot by the water to wait for my planned rendezvous. With my pack propped against a post marked with a white AT blaze, I sat back and rested while people with fishing gear and dogs passed by. I received only a few sidelong glances at my loitering and somewhat haggard form. 
My wife soon arrived, and our dogs were much more willing to embrace my odoriferous personage than she.  I put my pack in the trunk, changed into a clean shirt, socks and sneakers, and then we walked along the lovely little lake following the path of the AT to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy regional headquarters. 
We stopped by to chat for a bit then walked to the 101 Cafe just down the street and had a delicious Mexican food lunch sitting on their patio with our dogs. Just across the street, some veterans were having a flag raising ceremony to honor the day. 
It was a very nice ending to a simply wonderful ten day adventure.","Alec Kennedy Shelter

Running Nose,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615098,"My old trail blisters have turned into itchy callouses and my gear is still scattered about my screened in back porch waiting to be cleaned and packed away.  I’ve been home for several days and back to commuting an hour plus to/from work. I just finished 10 days climbing up and down rocky mountains carrying a backpack without injury, but yesterday my back went out just sitting in my office chair. Sheesh!  Wish I was still on the trail!
Anyway. Enough whining. It was just a lovely section hike and I was blessed with beautiful weather, pleasant interactions with hikers and others, no lost or broken gear, wonderful views, and peaceful, serene, and rejuvenating hours walking in the woods.  What more could one want? Just more of the same IMHO. 
So here are my conclusions. Everyone is going to have their own preferences and ideas, especially when it comes to gear. I provide this just so you can better understand how I worked things and have the opportunity to incorporate anything you see as useful into your regime. 
THOUGHTS ON ME
Blisters 
I did work at trying to get conditioned for this hike. I’d lost some weight. Did a good amount day hiking most weekends, working up to a 23 mile hike a few weeks before my shakedown. I have a good pair of Altra Timp Trail 1.5 trail runners that fit my feet well and wore Darn Tough boot cushion wool socks.  I did take breaks several times a day, taking off my shoes and socks for 20 minutes or more most times. I guess all of that was necessary, but just not sufficient in my case. Maybe I pushed too hard my first day, racing down the C&O Canal? Not sure. I certainly could stand to lose a solid 20-30 more lbs.  That would definitely help. I’m pretty confident my blisters were not from poor fitting or rubbing footwear but from just the repeated impact and pressure of my steps. Treatment?  (If you are squeamish skip this part) These were deep on the balls of my feet and lower heels under calloused skin. I had to pop them by cutting into them with a nail trimmers I carry that is similar to a handheld wire cutters.  A pin would not do the trick. I found it best not to try and cover them with moleskin.  Instead, I fashioned a pad about the size of the blister from gauze from my first aid kit and secured it with surgical tape. Note - wrapping the tape all the way around the foot so it is secured to itself will keep it in place so you don’t have to redo the whole thing every time you take off your socks.  Even the surgical tape won’t stick for long on your sweating, constantly moving feet. Don’t wrap the tape too tightly or it may restrict circulation in your feet or start cutting into them causing you more problems down the trail. Forget about band aids. They will not stay in place on your feet. This method let the blister drain and breathe while still providing some padding to the area. For me, Ibuprofen was much more effective at controlling this type of pain than Tylenol.My wife sent the rockplate inserts from my old pair of Altra Superior trail runners to my resupply point halfway through my hike.  I put the inserts in to my Altra Timp Trail 1.5 shoes. My theory was that these would help distribute the force of my footfalls. They didn’t seem to hurt, but I’m not certain they significantly helped - it’s possible they did. I wore them for the rest of my hike and I’ll probably continue to use them in the future.The blisters began healing a day or so after I popped them. It could be that for my feet, body mechanics, and gait that some starting blisters are just what I can expect at the start of a backpacking trip. Just the price of admission for a walk through heaven.Tempering my desire to go more miles helped with the healing. By the end of the day I could tell that if I went the extra 3-5 miles my legs could manage that my feet would be worse off for it.  My advice - Listen to the feet. 
Conditioning 
I was definitely in better condition for this section hike than my previous section hike two years ago. I had lost some weight (but still maybe 20-30 lbs overweight), and had done a good amount of weekend day hiking. This definitely gave me more stamina than I had before. I didn’t get winded as often on the uphills and was not completely exhausted when I stopped for the day.  While this definitely makes it easier, the natural human tendency is to push until it starts hurting and then wonder why.  I’ve seen plenty of people I’d say were more overweight or not in as good shape as me on the trail doing just fine. The simple fact is that it’s just walking, and you are in complete control of how far you go and at what pace you get there, as well as how much you carry along the way. 
Gravity Assist
On the downgrades I often find myself breaking into a sort of speed walk or slow trot gait. I’m sure this looks a little silly but I find it easier than wasting energy braking while going downhill. This is probably something you will not be trying if your knees are a problem for you.  I only do this if the trail and conditions permit. You need to stay in control, not get up too much speed, and be able to stop quickly at any point. If the trail is too rocky, steep, or wet this would be foolish. Know your body and your capabilities and act accordingly. 
Lollygagging
My section hike allowed for time to take some of the side trails to see the sights. Most of these were not too far off the AT and IMHO were worth the extra steps. Taking a bit of time to smell the roses along the way (and I quite literally did this several times) is definitely worth it I think. It can provide a quick change of pace and can be motivational as well as enjoyable. I tried to work these in as planned breaks or lunchtime stops when possible. 

THOUGHTS ON MY GEAR
Hennessy Hammock 
I’m very pleased with the comfort, ease of setup and packing, and greater ability to stealth camp VS a tent. I don’t have an underquilt but I do have a reflector, though I didn’t bring it on this trip. On one or two nights I would have been more comfortable if I’d had the reflector because of the wind and low temps.  That’s something I’ll reconsider on my next spring outing. I don’t sleep in the Shelters so with the hammock I don’t need to carry a sleeping mat.  Finding a good pair of trees usually takes a few minutes. The further apart they are, the more bow will naturally want to form in the line of the straps, tieout cord, and hammock proper, so the higher it must be attached to the trees to keep your butt off the ground.  When you first sit in it, it will naturally sag a bit as the lashing cinches itself up to the straps and tightens up. Plan for this by tying it a little tighter, leaving less room for the “knot” of your lashing to slide and cinch itself up to the straps, and position the straps so the hammock hangs a bit higher than where you want it to end up.I use the Hennessy snake skins to stow my hammock. I’ve tied a piece of fluorescent ribbon at the end of one of the snake skins so that I know which side of the hammock has the zipper opening and I can hang it appropriately without unfurling it from the snake skins. I like to set up so the guy lines of the rain fly on the zipper side of my hammock are wrapped around my trekking poles and then staked to the ground.  This raises the fly up a bit and makes the entrance more accessible. I also like to sit sideways using the hammock like a swing to cook and eat my meals.  No shelter picnic table needed! At night I tie my shoes together and hang them over the hammock underneath the rain fly. Socks, pants, and electronics gear bag hang on the ridge line inside.  Let me apologize in advance for this image, but it is possible to open the zipper and balance oneself hanging partially outside on the edge of the hammock and pee without getting out of the hammock. Sorry ladies, the difficulty class of this maneuver will probably be more challenging for you than it was for me. But desperate times often call for desperate measures. 
heavy duty lawn garbage bag 
I throw this on the ground like a tarp on which I put my gear and food when I’m cooking and packing up in the morning. I put my pack inside it at night to keep slugs and other crawly critters out and off of my pack and its contents.
Meals 
For dinners I bought large cans of Mountain House dehydrated meals. I portioned them out into individual freezer baggies. I put the baggie in the little flat-bottomed bowl that’s part of my cook system, then add the hot water. This keeps the bag upright and makes it easier to hold, but I still use my bandana like a hot pad.  I like to roll the top of the bag down to keep it more widely open when it’s ready to eat. I was happy with how this all worked out - a bit cheaper than the prepackaged individual servings, not as bulky, less trash, and maybe a few ounces lighter to boot!
Cooking 
I am pleased with the JetBoil MiniMo system as an upgrade from my old pocket rocket, collapsible pot and mug. Definitely more convenient and efficient and any weight difference is probably negligible IMHO. 
Water filter. 
I use the Platypus gravity water filter along with several collapsible plastic 1 liter bottles. Four bottles (along with my Nalgene) have been sufficient for my needs.  At the end of the day I like to get enough water for dinner, breakfast, and two liters to hike out with the next day all at once rather than going for water again the next morning before leaving.  If you are going for big miles the extra convenience of the Sawyer squeeze filter system might be worth not having to wait while your water filters.  For me, a water stop is a natural time to rest and having to wait while I filter water during the day is actually a good way to enforce something I need to do anyway and might be tempted to skip if I used the Sawyer filter.
Trekking Pole StrapsThis is probably going to be obvious to most people but it took me a while to put it together. When I first started hiking I was bothered by the feel of my trekking pole straps and didn’t use them. “Why do I need these straps?  It’s not like the poles are going to suddenly jump out of my hands, right?!  And they make it a pain to put the poles down.”Eventually I learned that the straps can distribute some of the force so that you don’t have to grip the poles as tightly if you “lean” on the straps with your wrists. Then I realized that with the straps I could let the poles drag behind me as I walk and use my hands to open and drink from my water bottle or eat a snack without having to stop.  Priceless. Caveman-realizes-rock-can-smash-nutshell type moment. Water Bottle 
I switched from a wide mouth Nalgene water bottle to a narrow mouth bottle. Definitely get a small mouth bottle if you don’t have one. You can drink from the bottle without having to stop to avoid spilling water all over yourself when hiking. Priceless.  Having a hard water bottle lets me mix up protein shakes and water add-ins like electrolyte supplements easily. I used to use one of those water bladders that slip into sleeve inside the back of the backpack and have a sipping tube that clips to a pack strap. One day on a trip in the past after getting water I was trying to squeeze the bladder back into my pack without having to completely unpack and repack all my stuff when the damn thing spouted water all over the contents of my pack. I haven’t used one since and don’t miss it in the least.  Your mileage may vary. 
Waterproof Stuff Sacks
All my gear is sorted into various waterproof stuff sacks except for the few things that are impervious to water - ex. stove and fuel canisters. I have a few things in gallon ziplock baggies like my food and meds for the day on trail and my toiletries kit.  These things it is nice to see inside the bag before opening it. My actual food bag is a large waterproof stuff sack intended for kayaking. It’s a bit more durable than the standard backpacking variety and bright yellow, making it easy to find in the morning. If I need to carry extra water in my pack, the bottles go inside a waterproof stuff sack because newly filtered water is generally cold and the bottles will sweat. Also, lids can come off, container seams can fail, and if it could happen it probably will happen to me.  All this gives me extra assurance that all my stuff will remain dry even if I slip and fall in a creek or do something pathetically comical like that. I still use a rain cover for my pack to keep it from soaking up a few extra few pounds of water during a downpour, but this way I don’t need a pack liner. In the past I’ve tried using a garbage bag for this purpose but I found it to be more of a pain is the butt than it was worth. Without a pack liner you can more easily find and/or reposition stuff in your pack.",,View Entry,"May 31, Fri",0
