Trip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611175,"Got picked up at the mountain house. Shuttle lady, Joyce would not stop talking. But she got me to Unicoi gap. The parking area was full of boy scouts 30-40 of them.  Weather was good. Packing in a sub sandwich was a good idea, I eat half while walking and the other half when i got to the shelter.  Got to Tray shelter around 2.  With poor weather moving in overnight shelter filled up fast. A tent was abandoned near the shelter so we made make shift front walls to keep the rain out. Tray Mtn shelter has a reputation for being windy. The people are nice but I do miss the people from last year.  It's strange, since I started right where I left off it's like the last year didn't happen and i started an spring 5 days ago.","Unicoi Gap

Trip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611178,"Most of the day is a blur.  It rained over night but the shelter stayed mostly dry. The weather while packing up was descent. Packed up and hit the trail.  Not sure when the rain started but it started. The wind blowing over the ridge top sounded like a jet engine and the rain was coming in sideways.  The rain kilt was working as long as the wind was not blowing. I need to put some Velcro a little way down the overlap so the wind does not blow it open.  Mile after stormy mile; but I made grate time.  While getting close to Dick's creek I tried to call the hostel for a shuttle but by my phone is wet and freaking out. No shuttle!  Got to Dick's Creek, now a 3/4 miles walk in the pouring  down a two lane mountain road.  Now at Top of GA hostel I picked up my drop box, bought a pizza, and paid for my laundry to be done ( mainly just to have it dried).  Ate my pizza and started to dry my gear out. I caught a shuttle to town to make a phone call and get dinner.  Made my phone call and started to walk toward the restaurant when it stated to rain again.  Ended up eating in the Grocery store deli waiting for the shuttle. Got back to the hostel to find they lost my t-shirt and a pant leg of my convertible pants. ","Tray Mountian

Trip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611184,"Spent the night worried about my  clothes and what to do about it.  They found my clothes and my gear is dry. Took an easy morning packing up and eating then caught the later shuttle to the trail. Found my pace today. Just a slow steady pass up hill and a slow careful pace down hill without  feeling a need to rush.  This was also the same pace as the old men on the trail. As a walked .3 miles to a shelter to have lunch I realized that the blue blaze miles are starting to add up.   
Crossed the GA NC state line! 
Do to the number of people that snore, I choose to sleep in my tent tonight away from the shelter so I did not feel a rush to get to  Muskrat Creek but by the time I got there it was very crowded. The bad weather Sunday had caused a bubble to form  and I was in it. I found a campsite that looked like it had some space and asked if they minded if i set up. They welcomed me in however, somebody still snored.","Dick's Creek

Trip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611938,"Left camp around 8:30 destination; standing Indian shelter about 5 miles away. A miles or so down the trail I stopped to send a video message to the family.  The guys from the campsite, all army buddies plus a nephew, caught back up to me.  I ended up hiking with them the rest of the day. My pace varied greatly depending of terrain but I seem to be matching the pace of at least one them. Hearing the weather was to turn bad Friday I decided to hike on and cover a little more distance to make sure I was off the trail by Thursday night. Set up camp with the army guys, at beech gap.  So much for a short day. ","Muskrat Creek

Trip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611945,"I woke up to my phone not working. While this was a problem I was trying not to rely on it and just let the trail take me. The goal today is to get over Albert Mtn. This is suppose to be one the steepest climbs on the A.T. After Albert the goal was to find a nice campsite.  The next site ended up being Long Branch Shelter. Unfortunately, It was packed  and  the people relatively rude. On we went.  The next  campsite was Rock Gap Shelter. I was not suppose to get to rock get until Thursday afternoon. It was also packed. We did find a small campsite, but it was right next to the stream. Up hill, from the site, the stream flowed right next to the privy.  There is no way this privy was 200 feet from the stream and it was over used. None of us was real thrilled about sleeping next to sewage  run off.  Me and Jon caught a ride into Franklin and picked up my truck. I then picked up everybody else and we stayed at the mtn. house that night.  Pizza, beer and a bed!","Beech Gap

Trip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611949,"We drove into down town Franklin and caught a the shuttle to rock gap. Although the 3.7 miles to Winding Stairs was  not difficult my legs had not recovered so it was still hard.  This was also my first time slack packing, hiking without my gear. Nearing Winding Stairs a free shuttle was already there so we hastily  my our way down to the road. Once back in town we stopped for lunch and browsed the local outfitters store. ","Rock Gap

Trip,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611952,"I completed my hike. Was able to do it injury free. There was pain. Each day something hurt but oddly what hurt was different each day. Most importantly none of the pain was because of or lead to injuries. If I was going to continue  on for a longer section hike I would have needed to take a rest day ( this might be not be needed if I took my planed short day and didn't compress another two days of hiking into one)  
Like last year  I didn't fully take  of being able not being a poor pot smoking hippy on the trail. I will have to consider staying in a hotel  vs a hostel next time.  I do not feel I slept well in the hostel and got less recovery from it.     
My gear did work much better this time. No major failures. I have to work better on food selection and quantities.   I had two less meals on the trail then I was planing but is still had an extra two pounds of food. As long as my phone works I can down size my extra battery.   will have to add camp shoes to the pack. Filtering from one bottle to another worked well but I want to try a larger dirty water bottle next time.
This hike started as one thing and ended something else. Being in better shape allowed me to focus more on other aspects of the trail and not just how physically hard it is. I hope I can continue reclaim more of my fitness that I lost due to my bout with Lyme.  
Randomly walking into a campsite  occupied by a great group of men, that I would continue my hike with, was unexpected and a very welcome experience.    ",,View Entry,"Apr 19, Fri",0
