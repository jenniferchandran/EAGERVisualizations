Tinkle Bell,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617650,We walked 11 miles today. We finished the Approach Trail. We are ending the day at 9.0. We are just north of Hightower Gap on a hill. Casey stopped at Hawk Mountain Shelter for the night.  My husband and I are the only ones in our campsite. He is so sweet. He can hike so much faster than me but he slows down to my pace which I  appreciate so much. He is a treasure!,"

We met up again with some fellows from Springfield, Illinois.  They are a great bunch of guys. They say their hiking club is the ""no hurry,  no worry "" hiking club. 
We also met Aleysia and her dog Sugar.  We took pictures and exchanged phone numbers.  She is new to hiking.  She is a beautiful young lady. 
We had some tough trails today. They are hard climbs for me at least.  It was beautiful. We are camping at Girard Gap tonight.  Casey is right beside us. We are in our tents.  It's 7:30. The sun is shining through our tent door.",,View Entry,"May 16, Thu",0
