Raid,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553455,"“You’re going to hike the Appalachian Trail? Wow, that’s crazy.” “Well, yes, yes it is,” was my reply. I was tired of feeling I needed to defend myself for my decision, and frankly, on that day, I also was beginning to think this endeavor was crazy. Previously, when people would ask the question, I would feel as though they were making a judgment, on my age ( I am no longer young,) on my physical appearance (I am no longer lean,) on my gender (I am still a female, and most likely will stay that way as I am quite happy with myself.) I was getting down to about 50 days left before I started my hike, getting down to actually feeling nervous instead of wistful wishing. I was realizing I was leaving my husband for a life time. Maybe that’s an exaggeration, but it’s still longer than the 12 or so hours we are apart during the day. I would be out of touch with our adult children who still like to run life’s issues past me every now and then, making me feel as though I must have had some parenting skills, which is not true at all. I truly possessed subpar skills but the kids persevered and were somehow determined they could raise their own Mother while raising themselves. I’m thankful that Scott was not a traveling sales man and was able to be home at night to take care of us all. Take care of us he did, along with taking care of puppies that grew into dogs and neighbor kids that were in and out of the house at will (Don’t leave your home unlocked because you have no keys if you don’t want neighbor kids in your home, eating your cereal. It’s cheaper to replace the keys, though not as entertaining.) He also welcomed into our home, Kasie, whom we had met only once before. She was a friend of our daughters who needed a place to live. She made a place in our home and our hearts.  So, I kind of feel that I know what crazy is. I am going to miss Scott, the kids, the pets, my friends and family and I will miss work. At work, I am treated very well, the people are great, and just about 50 feet down the hall is a Chick-fil-a and a Starbucks where it’s always warm and dry. Am I going to trade all of that for a new kind of crazy? “Well, yes, yes I am.”",,View Entry,"Jan 18, Wed",0
Raid,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553604,"This morning, I tried downloading Guthook's App and experienced technical difficulties on behalf of my carrier. I will probably go into the store to try to have them figure it out since the person on the phone was not able to help. I was going on a hike today on the AT and thought it would be good to try out the App. As it was, it rained pretty solid the entire time so I would not have brought my phone out to use the App anyway. A First World problem, I suppose. My rain skirt worked well, as expected, my jacket wet out, as expected but my rain mitts failed which was not expected. I am not sure if I want to purchase new or just use plastic bags over the mitts. I am not sure how reliable the bags will be and I really want something I can rely on since my hands and feet get cold quite easily. Another First World problem. When we got home, Scott made Sloppy Joes, and we got into warm, dry clothes. A First World blessing.",,View Entry,"Jan 21, Sat",0

Raid,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553789,"I have had a few people ask about my name.Scott and I live a few miles from MuddButt (class of 2003) and she agreed to meet with us and talk Trail. She comes from a family of Violin Makers, their shop is in an old home with wide baseboard and window moldings, it comes complete with squeaky hardwood floors that are beautiful. Violins and other stringed instruments adorn the walls.MudButt is a natural story teller and kept us mesmerized with her stories of the trail. As she talked, she mentioned that people pack their fears. I told her if that is true then I need to pack a can of Raid. She replied if I did, people would call me Raid. She continued on with her story for about ten minutes. She stopped, looked at me and said, ""Raid wouldn't be a bad trail name."" About ten minutes after that she asked if I was going to accept the name.I am arachnophobic. Lizards and snakes don't bother me so much, but spiders paralyze me. Along that note, tomorrow, I am sending my clothes to Insect Shield (www.insectshield.com) They will treat my clothes with permethrin and the treatment will last 70 washings as opposed to 6 if I do it myself, which will pretty much take me through my hike. Some people say that wading in streams with clothes treated this way will poison the water. I spoke with the people at Insect Shield and in its wet form, before it is applied and dried, it is toxic. Once it is dried, it is not. It does slowly break down, but it is the agitation of the wash machine that breaks it down, not wading in the streams. So, I am going to use this in hopes of keeping ticks, spiders, flies and mosquitoes away from me. My husband has a hat treated with this and it works incredibly well. If you are interested in doing this, you can download the order form from their web site. I have called them twice with questions and they are very gracious and will answer all of your questions.I have no affiliation with them.",,Trail Name,"Jan 25, Wed",0

Raid,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554014,"Tomorrow, it becomes official, I am going to hike the trail. Official in the manner that I am going to give my notice at work. Giving my notice is going to be very difficult to do. It isn't that they don't know about it, I let them know of my plans three years ago, but to be fair, none of the current management staff were in their positions three years ago, a fact that Lisa, my Supervisor reminds me of. Lisa would like me to give them six more months notice. She has a great sense of humor! But I secretly kind of wonder if she isn't serious. Lisa will someday hike part of the trail with me, I will carry her little babies if needed to make it happen. Our Management has very good to me, especially when accommodating my schedule. I am a person that needs a full time job but also needs lots and lots of vacation. Vacations take money, so I work, then when I have money, I want to vacation, it's a vicious cycle. I am sure I need some type of therapy for that. They put up with my ""this would work so much better if we did this.."" ideas, which I am sure every member of management hears so often from people who really have a very small view of the big picture. But they humorously listen to me and kindly let me go back to doing my job, and I appreciate that because I really need the job. Our Management has been very supportive of my hike and in fact, gave me their own trail name, ""Three Toes,"" which I actually like but I already have a trail name. I wonder if they were thinking I should give my second personality a trail name all her own? I don't really know if I have two personalities but I found you can get away with lots of things at work if you blame it on your other personality. I probably need some kind of therapy for that too.",,It's official,"Jan 31, Tue",0

Raid,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556709,"I have always thought it was important to have an annual physical, well OK, I didn't always think that, but as I age, I understand the importance of it. The problem is, that while I think I am doing fine, my Doctor always finds some things to tweek and tune, she reminds me of my mechanic, he always finds SOMETHING that needs fixing on my car. This year, my labs came back goofy (I am certain this is a real medical term) and I needed to visit a Specialist. I of course, have this hike pending and need the Specialist to see me ASAP. Specialists don't know what ASAP is. The day I am to see the Specialist, he is sick. Should I be concerned about being treated by a Doctor that is sick?? Maybe, but at this point I am desperate so I am more than willing to see his nurse. She was less impressed with my desire to hike and more impressed with my medical history and lab results and determined I needed a battery of tests, none of which is done ASAP. As a matter of fact, one of the tests was done on the very day I was to start my hike.The results are not what I wanted to hear, it is not a perfect scenario but it could be worse. Now, this issue concerns my liver. It was not caused by alcohol (I am taking the Specialists and Pathologists word on this) but I decide to have a little fun with our Pastor. I tell him the Doctor told me that our church cannot have communion every Sunday as it is bad for my liver. (We are Lutheran and communion takes a long time, I'm thinking, if we have communion just every other Sunday, that leaves us more time for cookies and coffee and every Lutheran knows cookies and coffee are worth their weight in gold.) Without missing a beat, Pastor Zach says, ""Well Cheri, if you wouldn't hang on to the Chalice so long and and let it go sooner, you wouldn't have this problem!"" For the record, the Specialist has cleared me to hike so I will be out there, albeit a little later than planned, probably doing some type of flip flop to make it all happen, but I know now, I am lucky to even be able to attempt this.",,Words of Wisdom from Pastor Zach,"Mar 17, Fri",0
Raid,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558838,"We decided it would relieve some pressure if I started at Winding Stair Gap. The first day was emotional, but I found out i could not cry while hiking up hill. So i just kept hiking. I met a man who I hiked with for a small part of the day. At a big hill, I took a break and he went on. Then i met Concrete, a man from Racine, WI. We hiked off and on together that day. We hung our bear bags together that night. My filter quit working the first day, i was panicked and called Scott. He calmly told me to ask another hiker for help. Concrete helped me back flush it. It was limping along but I decided to replace it at the NOC.","Winding Stair Gap

Raid,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558883,"I'm still not able to figure how to add mileage in but when I do, it will get updated.First, going into the NOC ended up being a bit treacherous. Gypsy J said it was dangerous and going up out of NOC was brutal. I don't think she exaggerated. A short time after I packed up leaving Wesser Bald Shelter, it started to rain. It was about 60 degrees and I was heading to the NOC so I didn't put on rain gear. It was raining pretty good when I got to the Jump Off. Its a place in the trail where the trail goes 180 degrees in the other direction and if you dont go in that direction, its a cliff. Its a pile of rocks. It looked more like a fall off place if you weren't careful. I couldn't get pics as it was raining. I ended up having to scoot down on my butt. The trail quickly goes into a hair pin turn. I promptly fell. In my dramatic brain, I envisiobed only 2 inches of teail between myself and falling over the cliff. When I recovered, I realized I had a couple of fwet before I would fall off. As I hiked on, it continued to rain. I caught up with Concrete. He fell 3 times, each time he was able to fall inland rather than over board. We both ended up slowing down. Got into the NOC and checked in. Even though we were all wet and muddy, they were happy to see us. Met some very nice women in my bunk house. It is worth the 20.00 to stay there. Going up the next day was as Gypsy J said, beutal. I'm quit certain I have left a lung back there somewhere. The climb didn't really end until almost to camp. I don't think I did too badly for my 4th hiking day. However, I would not recommend starting there. I did have lunch at a pretty site. I will try to pist the pucture of the view.","Wesser Bald Shelter

Raid,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558887,"I heard we had storms coming in today and tried to make it to Browns Fork Shelter. I went about 3 1/2 miles before it started raining hard. After a few minutes the wind picked up. It is really hard to explain how vulnerable I felt on top of the ridge with the wind. Then the thunder started and soon there was lightening. None of the lightening was close but its an uneasy feeling knowing you are up high and could be a target. It started getting colder so I zipped up my rain jacket and my hands were starting to get really cold. Jess and Brady ended up passing me and mentioned they were goung to stay at a hostel near the road crossing. I said I might like to do that too. I was uncertain since I would only be 2 miles from the next shelter but they were talking severe storms coming in during the night. I had so many people pass me that I knew there would be no room in the shelter. When I finally made it to the gap, the wind was unreal. Jess' pincho was blowing side ways and her trekking pole almost got blown off the picnic table. They were talking to the hostel and asked if they had room for me also. So, I am at the Cabin in the Woods. I am staying on a cot in the living room of a cabin with two guys, well, they have their own cots, but we are all in one room. They are 2 guys I have hiked with off and on. Jess and her husband are in the bedroom of the cabin. It's nice and clean and has hot water for showers. Gypsy J was worried about me and offered to come get me as the weather is to worsen tomorrow and possibly Friday. She will get me tomorrow and hopefully I can get back out Friday. This is a great gift for me since the hostel is full tomorrow and I would have to pay for hotel and shuttle back to trail.","Sassafras Gap Shelter

Raid,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/559052,"Someone asked if I was having fun. The answer is yes. My journals have been more factual but I will try to start providing insight on some of the more colorful aspects of the trail. On one section, the AT and Bartram trail run together. I told Concrete that the blazes are yellow for Bartram so he would know if he got off the AT and was on the Bartram. He hiked on ahead. I was hiking along, looking down as a person does most of the time to keep from falling. I stopped and looked up and , yes, I saw nothing but a yellow blaze. I swore and spun around. Right then, a guy was hiking behind me. I asked him, almost yelled actually, with a great amount of frustration if I was on the Bartram. He laughed and said I was on both the AT and the Bartram. We both laughed as I said thank you. It wasn't until awhile later that I would see a white blaze depicting the AT. Later, I ran into him at a shelter and we laughed at my panic. Another time I came upon a shelter right on the trail. It had a great water source about 20 feet in front of the shelter AND a picnic table. Thats a huge gift. There were about 5 or 6 guys hanging around at the table. I sat on the shelter floor to eat my lunch. One guy, Wilson, pulled out a gallon zip lock bag full, stuffed with candy, Jolly Ranchers and other types. He offered Jolly Ranchers to everyone, including me. All but one guy took a piece. The other guy said while pointing to a different type of candy, ""Could I have one of those instead?"" Wilson said with a serious voice, ""Sorry dude, I offered just the Jolly Ranchers."" Dead silence. I'm sitting about 8 feet away from the group and am thinking, ""Awkward!"" And I can see the looks on the others and they are thinking the same thing. Finally Wilson exclaims, ""Dude, I'm just kidding!"" Everybody roared, it was so funny. Wilson kept offering more of his candy and someone finally asked if he shopped hungry again. He said, ""Yes, that's why I'm trying to get rid of it, I bought to much!"" Everybody laughed again. Every bit of weight adds up, and carrying close to 2 pounds of candy is a lot of extra weight. It's those moments that make this fun, watching people interact and hearing the jokes they play on each other. 
I met a twenty something year old guy yesterday morning as I was packing up. He mentioned he heard the weather was going to be bad so he was going to stay at the shelter for 3 days. I asked if he had enough food to do that. He replied that he carried 8 days of food. He said he always does that and if he gets tired of it, he offers it to others. When I was ready to head out, he replied, ""So you are going to hike out today?"" I said ""Yes, well I don't know, what kind of food do you have in that bag?"" He laughed and replied, ""I will feed you, you can stay!"" People use a lot of simple humor out her, they are also very kind. Jess and her husband Brady, who I met at the NOC, and shared a cabin with ladt night, have asked me several times as they pass by if I'm OK. She is a nurse and I suppose my heavy breathing and red face make her a bit worried. LOL Yes I am having fun, even though it is physically hard. There are many characters out here, it will be interesting to get to know them better.
For now, I have been at Gypsy J's house, where it has poured rain off and on while the temps hovered around 35 degrees. We have had a great visit today. It will be hard to return to the trail tomorrow since she has spoiled me and we have laughed alot. She could use prayers, she has injured her ankle and it seems to be getting worse so she is off the trail until it heals.","Brown Fork Gap

Raid,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560904,"I am currently in Hot Springs, NC. When I hit Fontana Village, a woman named Pogo was sitting waiting for a shuttle, we ended up doing our resupply together and hiking on to the Fontana Hilton Shelter (It's not a Hilton, but it has a shower, indoor bathrooms and picnic table.) Since then, she has taken me under her wing and literally guided me through the Smokies. The first night at the shelter, we sat with Bean, Fresh and Sweet Tea. It was getting on to dark and about time to turn on headlamps if you wanted to walk back to your tent. We were at a picnic table (most shelters don't have them, but this one did.) and a man came up to us and started talking. After a few minutes, it was evident he was a trail maintainer. We could see the outline of about 4 badges on his vest but it was to dark to see them clearly. He continued talking about the trail, after about 10 minutes, Sweet Tea pointed to one of the badges and said ""Is, is that a Taco Bell badge? I feel like that's a Taco Bell badge."" All of us started cracking up. The trail maintainer kept on talking, he didn't even notice. We all got a great laugh out of that and it's one of those things that keep me laughing when I am struggling up the hill. Pogo started out earlier than I and I had no idea for sure where I was going to end up. The next day. after climbing up out of Fontana, I decided to continue to the shelter, and ran into Pogo again. Fresh and Bean along with Sweet Tea ended up camping at a site short of the shelter. We did not see them again until today. They are staying at the same hostel as I am. I lost my spoon (my only eating utensil) that night at the Hilton and Fresh and Bean gave me one of theirs. They would not take any money for it. I have since bought a new one and was gladly able to give it back to them today. People are so kind, they give food and gear, things they dearly need themselves.Pogo helped me navigate the Smokies and gave me encouragement along the way. She knew the terrain and was able to let me know when it was a good idea to do bigger miles than I might have tried. We got through the Smokies in seven days, having stayed one night at Gatlinburg, not a speed record by any means but I think I would still be there wandering around with our Pogo.","Fontana Hilton shelter

Raid,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560907,"One of my toughest days was in the Smokies. I just didn't think I had it in me to keep going. I was trying to keep track of how many miles I had hiked and where I was on the trail. The Guthooks app was not working properly. I was then looking for a water source, which would let me know where I was at for sure. I hiked and hiked, waiting to pass it, then I would know I had only a mile left until the shelter. I was getting frustrated, thinking to myself, ""You are so slow, two hours have gone by, you have not even passed the water source, so you have not even gone a mile and a half."" All of a sudden, I came into the clearing around the shelter. I could not believe I had passed the water source and that I was safely at the shelter. I later told Pogo that I was confused how I could pass the water source so clearly marked on my maps. She started laughing and said it was quite a ways off the trail and I would not have seen it at all. That day was a long one and I was beat at the end of it. I did not have the energy to set up my tent and opted to sleep in the shelter. I took a spot next to the wall ( most people don't want to sleep near the wall as the mice run along side of it.) The wall was made of stacked stone and I just knew there were spiders hiding in all of those places. I set up next to a man who said he was an entomologist, so I started calling him Bug Man and decided if I had to deal with spiders, who better to sleep next to than him?? My feet hurt and my legs ached but I was safe and had actually done faster miles than I thought. Pogo thought I should be called DC for directionally challenged, but actually, I am Distance Challenged. I cannot always tell how many miles I have gone. My Guthooks is now working properly and will help me along with that. It was a horrible day though and I thought I should call Scott and ask him to come get me. I prayed all that day for strength and several times that night. The next day, I hiked out and met up with the Groves, Papa G is 75 and is hiking with his daughter, Antenna and son, Thunderbuns. They welcomed me to hike with them and it was one of my best days. I enjoyed that day so much and it remains and probably will as one of my most fondest. Antenna got her name at the beginning of the trail. While in Georgia, they had a horrible storm at night. She said they had 60 mile an hour wind gusts, hail and lightening and pouring rain. Her tent poles snapped and tore a hole in her tent and tent fly. She hollered for her Dad to help and soon they realized they needed her brother. He had just gotten into his tent, his rain gear was muddy, he was in his underwear. He didn't want to put his rain gear back on and he was not interested in getting back into wet clothes, so he went out to help in his underwear. They soon realized many people were having issues and since they were all wet, they stayed outside to help others. So, her brother got the name Thunderbuns since he ran around in a storm in his underwear. Then next day, she discovered her tent poles would not collapse down and stuck out of the back of her pack about 2 1/2 feet. Each time she would pass a bush or Rhododendron the poles would snag. Thunderbuns filmed her from behind, all the while she is saying, ""You better not be filming this!"" Of course he shared the video and it is one of the funniest things to watch. She looks like she has an antenna coming out of her pack. Trail names sometimes have the funniest ways of coming about!We have hiked off and on with them and they are always a fun, uplifting family.","Smokies

Raid,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560911,"The day I got into Newfound Gap, Pogo and Yardsale had already gotten a hitch into town. I ran into Papa G and the family and they said I could hitch with them. Then Antenna found a lady who was giving trail magic (jelly beans and soda!) and found out she was giving a ride to another hiker. She asked if she would give me a ride also. Antenna said it was more important I get into town to resupply since I was leaving to hike back out in the morning. They were going to take a zero so didn't need to get to town early. I was glad to accept the ride, from a stranger no less! We do things out here we tell our children to never, ever do. The Trail Angel dropped me off at the hotel that Pogo and Yardsale were at, then the race began. A person has to get their laundry done, resupply, sort food, clean gear and then find a place to eat town food, all the while, you are on foot, trying to find the closest options. I went to Walgreens and found most of my food then went to a Mom and Pop store to complete the rest of it. We went out to eat that night and ran into Papa G and family and ended up eating with them, along with Jade and Neverland. Jade and Neverland were doing 250 miles of the trail this year for conditioning, as they are going to start the PCT this week. We all sat around eating and enjoying ourselves, joking as though we have all known each other a long time. We were able to get a free shuttle back to Newfound Gap in the morning from First Baptist Church who runs the free shuttles. It is amazing how much people give of themselves to help others they will never see again.I did eventually make it out of the Smokies. I did not see any bears though I am sure they saw me. A few miles before I was out, a beautiful doe was eating alongside the trail, about 12 feet from me. She took to steps towards me, I told her she shouldn't do that. She put her head down and kept on eating. I thought the fauna in the Smokies was beautiful, but the terrain is tough, I would never want to hike them again! The climb out of Fontana was tough, not as bad as the NOC but close. The long downhill to get out of the Smokies is tough on the knees but at the end was a couple giving out trail magic. We had ham sandwiches, chips and soda. Next stop, about a mile away was the hostel, Standing Bear, that we were staying at. So, I had to hike uphill with a full tummy. A nearly impossible task. I was groaning the entire way and had to tell myself I should know what lays ahead before I eat! It was a great feeling of accomplishment to hike the Smokies, but I know it is truly just the beginning of what lays ahead. I have been blessed so far with friends and trail angels, and a supportive family. I am a lucky person.","Gatlinburg

Raid,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/560915,"Pogo and I arrived at Standing Bear Hostel about 15 minutes apart. There are three women who have been great cheerleaders for me, T Squared, Honey Bee, and Sunshine. They always ask how I am doing and include me in their conversations. I cannot hike with them, they are too fast and will be picking up their miles. They were at the hostel and invited Pogo and I to share a cabin with them rather than staying in the bunk house. It was nice to have a semi private place. Standing Bear is like, hmm, I don't know, a hippie commune maybe??? For resupply, you are given an envelope and you go into the resupply shed, write down what you take and the price, its on the honor system. Then you square up at the end of your stay. To wash your clothes, there is a scrub board, but miracle upon miracle they have an electric dryer! I used the outdoor shower and they have a privy, no indoor toilet. A privy is similar to a porta potty, except it is a composting pit. After doing your business, you scoop leaves, etc on top of it and somehow it breaks down, so there is no emptying of it like a porta potty. This privy is about 10 feet away from a creek that runs on the property so I am not so sure these things are under any type of ""building code."" I am quite certain none of the buildings on the property were under any ""code."" My friend Kara, aka Arkansas Traveler told me, ""You will lower your standards tremendously when you are staying at places."" I have found this out to be true! After leaving Standing Bear, we ran into Dove and have been hiking off and on with her. She is a strong hiker and can go more miles but has been staying with us. She may hike out today though and then I may not see her again. I fell the other day, a face plant, she came back to help me up, she reached out with one hand and just pulled me up, she is strong. And for the record, I twisted my foot just a bit but am ok. While Pogo, Dove and I were hiking huge uphill, Pogo shared a story of her and U Turn hiking out of Fontana. She said they were going along the pace of a snail, each step taking only about 6 inches, they were exhausted and still had a long way to go. They are inching along when U Turn suddenly says ""We are going to CRUSH this hill!"" The three of us busted out laughing at this. Pogo said, ""The abundant enthusiasm at that moment was unbelievable!"" Those moments like that help keep us going when it seems a struggle. Pogo also suggested that I eat some candy before going uphill. I said many people eat Jolly Ranchers but that looked like a blocked air passage to me. I told her that since she hikes in front, she would not know if I was doing my usual gasping of air from exhaustion or if I was choking on candy as they would sound the same. Pogo and Dove have agreed to keep the hard candy away from me.","Smokies

I have been on the trail for 20 days. We were planning on coming into town on Wednesday but we reached the last shelter at 2:00 on Tuesday. It was raining and a bit cool. Pogo said we could sit around the shelter and be cold until 8:30 PM bedtime or we could hike the 3.5 miles into town. We opted to keep hiking, making it about a 14 mile day. Pogo stayed at a friends house, Dove and I hiked over the bridge and found flat places along the French Broad River to pitch our tents. It was free and town is just right there so why not? Dove said the cool thing about camping along the river is that all you can hear is the roar of the water. Then she said the bad thing about camping along the river is all you can hear is the roar of the the water and can't hear if anything is in camp. It was a warm night and I wanted to open my vestibule door but I kept thinking about what she said and I was afraid that I would wake up to something pressed up against my mesh. I'm a big chicken, I know!My Dad asked how Dove got her name. I told him that when she sleeps, she sounds like a cooing dove. He said, you mean you sleep near people? I told him when in the shelter, you sleep shoulder to shoulder with people you don't know and when in a tent, sometimes your tents almost touch. It is a different world. Last night, I stayed at Laughing Heart Hostel in a semi private room. Three beds to a room. My ""roommates"" didn't show up until about 6:00 PM. It was two men I have never met! Tonight they moved me to a private room for no extra fee as they needed the three bed room for someone else. On a side note, I have mentioned Wilson in a previous post. A generous funny guy who is friendly to everyone. He is quite fast and almost runs on the trail. He is an experienced hiker. He fell yesterday and knocked himself out. Another guy found him, and helped him sit up. He made Wilson take his pack off. Wilsons face was all bloody and he was worried if he had lost teeth. He did not, but he broke his eye socket, broke his sternum and cut his lip. After sitting up for a bit he decided to hike into town. The man helping him tried to get him to sit still for a bit longer as he thought he had a concussion since one pupil was a different size than another. Wilson hiked on into town to the clinic where there super glued his lip back together and told him he needs to go home. How many miles did Wilson hike AFTER his fall?? THIRTEEN! He is one tough guy. But he is heading home tomorrow. Many of us will miss him. When Wilson was telling us the story, he left out the fact he hiked that many miles, it was the other guy who told me.","Somewhere in the mountains

When she brought me back to the hostel, many people there knew her and she had a good visit with them. I unfortunately left the bacon in her car and told her she could just as well mail it up the trail, but she brought it all the way back today. We had breakfast together where I got to repay her generosity. Her foot is still not healed all the way. She is going to try to return to the trail in a week or so and see how it goes. I think of her and Wilson and my faceplant and realize how quickly a persons hike can be over due to injury. I pray each day for safety and guidance. And I pray for stronger lungs. Actually, I say ""Maybe you could just give me an extra lung?"" I think He has a sense of humor. I told some of my trail friends that I am convinced when I am done that I will go to the Dr and she will say ""Do you know you only have one lung?"" LOLHeading back to the trail tomorrow, on to Erwin, TN. I do hope Dove hikes out with us, she hikes behind me and pushes me uphill while Pogo pulls me.Thanks for all the encouragement from friends, family and from some I do not know. It all is appreciated.","Hot Springs

Raid,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561075,"I left Hot Springs today. It's an easy town to get around in, it has one street and is about a mile long. For resupply there is Hillbilly Market, a Mom and Pop shop but very friendly and very good resupply options. Plus they sell corn dogs and shakes. The outfitter also has resupply with some good choices and economically priced. Dollar General is also an option. 
Two things happened in Hot Springs. Wilson said good bye to all of us. He has to leave the trail due to his injuries, broken eye socket, severly cut lip, pushed in teeth, concussion and broken sternum. Wilson fell on his face and hit some rocks on the trail. He was kind and encouraging, funny and energetic. People enjoyed being around him. He is young but the trail treats all people the same and will hurt you no matter who you are.
Also, Fresh and Bean and Sweet Tea caught up with us! Bean had felt that his legs were just not right, so they camped short of the shelter when climbing up grom Fontana Dam, and have been a day or so behind us since. It was great to catch up and i was able to give them back their spoon they loaned me when I lost mine. 
On a sad note, Papa G may have to come off trail. He has bad shin splints that even KT tape is not helping. I hiked with them this morning and really enjoyed our time. I'm in camp now, i hiked in a light rain the last couple hours of the day. The only thing that bothered me was the thunder I kept hearing. It was hard to tell if it was coming my way or not. I just put my head down and kept at my task. I ran into a SOBO and asked how far the shelter was. My face lit up, well it was already red from being hot, even though it was raining, when he said it was just over the hill. I thought I had another mile to go when it was just 10 minutes away. I set my tent up in the rain, but soon after, it quit. It has just started up again. Since I cannot control it, I will enjoy the sound if it on my tent as I sleep. I am in camp with Honey Bee, Sunshine, T Squared and Papa G and family. Honey Bee is an affectionate lady and gave me a kiss on my cheek when I arrived. Pogo is behind me but will catch up tomorrow. I hope you are all as bkessed as I.","Hot Springs

Raid,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563023,"After leaving Hot Springs, Papa G did decide to leave the trail. As he was getting to the trail head to catch a ride, Antenna fell and hurt her knee. So she has decided to go home also and rehab before coming back out. Thunderbuns is on his own now and is long past us since he is a strong hiker. My first night after leaving Hot Springs, we had a terrible wind and rain come up. I set my tent up in the wrong direction and had to use my rain skirt to keep the rain from blowing in from the vestibule doors. Sunshine had her tent next to mine but it was so loud we could not talk. The next morning, i was all set to hike out. I checked with the people in the shelter and they let me know it was 48 degrees.  It was also pouring rain. Two men hiked out, but before they did, they warned me that if I started, i could not stop til the next shelter as hypothermia might set in. With that news, i went back to my tent and sat out the day. I kept going to the shelter to chat, then would get cold and go back to my tent to warm up. I met Mr Good Boy at the shelter and have seen him several times sonce, he greats me with a hug each time. He is young, about my sons age, he is interesting to talk with and I am fond of him. I slept off and on during the day. I think my body needed the rest because when night fell, I had no trouble sleeping. Pogo was still behind me when a person came to my tent and asked if it was Raids tent. I said yes and they responded wirh ""Hiker came into camp with a message for you. Pogo is camped 3 miles behind you.""

I thought I had a day and a half extra but somehow found myself short a day and half. I was trying to figure out what to do. I ran into U Turn and told her I was trying to figure out where to resupply,  she gave me some bars. She must have told Sweet Tea because he ran into me later in the day and asked if I was short food. I told him I  was and he  gave me food too. The kindess of these people made me cry. The next day, Choo Choo, a 70 year old lady I hiked off and on with since our rainy day,  decided she was going to contact a new hostel and get resupply. I decided to go with her. I was able to resupply and get back on the trail wirhin an hour. Running out of food is serious, I was 2 days hike from anywhere. I still do not know how it happened but hope I am more careful in the future. On a lighter note, my son Erik texted me a link to 20 edible plants you can find along the AT! Lol. Also, while at one of the shelters, a man came up with a bag of apples and gave us each one. He had no idea I was short food and how treasured it was.","

Raid,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563025,"Two days before getting to Erwin, I met Mishap. She and I hiked together that afternoon. We hiked over Bald Mountain in the rain. As soon as we stepped foot on the bald, the wind picked up started blowing us off balance. After hiking on this bald for quite awhile,  in the fog and rain, she asked if I thought we were just going in circles. Visibility was about 60 feet. Then she said if we see another survey marker, it means we are going in circles. We laughed at that but I secretly thought there was a chance she was correct.  She later tried taking a picture and the zipper on her pouch got stuck. There we are, in the cold rain and fog trying to get this undone. She stamps her foot and says, ""This sh*t always happens to me, thats how I got my name!"" Boy did I laugh at that. When we arrived at No Business Knob shelter, I decided to stay and she decided to hike on. I sat in the shelter trying to get warm and visiting with some new people, Carjack, Cricket and Sun. Cricket was actually rescued from the Smokies earlier this year for hypothermia.  She rested for 11 days and came back out. In the morning I headed out. I wanted to go further than the next shelter but did not want to camp alone and knew I could not hike all the way to Erwin. In the morning,  I met a couple, Sherlock and Darwin. They told me they hike til 5 then find a place to camp. They invited me to hike with them. We kept passing each other throughout the day.  When we met at the last shelter, we decided to hike on and camp together.  We do lots of things our Mothers tell us not to do, like go and camp with strangers! But hiking further that night gave me just a 4 mile hike into Erwin the next day.  Since that night, i have seen Sherlock and Darwin many times. I really like them and wish we could hike together more.","

Raid,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563050,"While hiking into Erwin, I almost stepped on a black rat snake. Truly almost pierced it with my hiking pole. As soon as i saw it, I reversed direction, midstride saying something highly intelligent, ""Blah, blah blah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."" Thats exactly what I said. My forward hiking speed isn't fast, but I was really impressed with my reverse speed and my intelectual speaking abilities. The snake was small, about 3 feet long.  He let me take pictures then moved on his way. 
When I got to Uncle Johnny's , the hostel I was going to stay at, I pitched my tent along the Nolichucky river on the hostel property. It costs 10.00 to tent compared to 25.00 for a bunk. This is the 2nd river I camped on. I can only think of the SNL with Chris Farley and him saying ""You're going to end up living in a van, down by the river.""  Only, I'm not even in a van, just a tent! I caught up with Pogo, Fresh and Bean were leaving, but Sweet Tea and Mornin Glory were there.  It was a hot day and we were able to stay in the shade and visit. A shower and laundry as well as resupply was on my list. 
It had been 7 days since my last shower and laundry. I do use a bandana and sponge bathe in my tent, but it is just not the same! Everyone smells, it can't be helped, but most of us try to do our best to stay clean. I would recommend Uncle Johnny's. They have 2 shuttles a day going to town, and there are a few places that deliver food there. While staying there,  I ran into Chicken, more about him later, and Darwin and Sherlock.  
We headed out the next day for Beauty Spot, another bald we would cross over.  I hoped for better weather since two of the other balds were socked in with fog and I didn't get good views. The day was warm, almost too warm, but after the cold rain, I looked forward to a dry day. So, Sweet Tea, Mornin Glory, Yardsale, Pogo and myself headed up to the bald. It was hard to say goodbye to the host, but my job is to hike, not lounge.","
",Erwin,"Apr 28, Fri",0
Raid,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/563053,"After leaving Erwin, we decided to camp on Beauty Spot so we could get a view of the sunset and sunrise. It became one mistake we swore would never happen again. Shortly after getting the camp set, the wind moved in. Pogo uses a hammock and thought she would like to sleep out under the stars. Yardsale and I both have 2 man tents so we told her she could sleep in one of our tents if she got cold. We were assured by some locals it would not rain.
Some time in the night, it began to rain. Pogo's bag got soaked.  She came into my tent and put on all of her dry layers. During the night, my tent stake pulled out multiple times with Pogo going out to restake it each time.  We had rocks holding the stakes in but they were no match for the wind.
The next morning, our little rag tag group made it down the other side of the bald and ate breakfast.  We talked of how my tent walls were billowing in and out and actually slapped us on the head a few times. The noise of the tent itself was unreal, keeping us up most of the night. My little tent is not aero dynamic, but it did the best it could.
We hiked 14 miles that day in the  cold rain. Pogo and I got ahead of Sweet Tea and Yardsale.  We decided to stay at Greasy Creek hostel. We needed to get out of the rain and dry out Pogo's bag. The hostel is 0.6 miles off the AT on a goat path, less maintained than the trail itself. They told us they would help. When we got there,  Mornin Glory was there and she was pretty upset. The place was disorganized, had one bathroom for all hikers, very little resupply and they wanted her to sleep on a futon or the floor.  They told me I could tent for 10.00 and that Pogo could sleep out on their front porch.  We explained her bag was wet, but they would not allow us to dry it. Unfortunately, the person we spoke to was not there and the man in charge knew nothing about our situation. 
We decided to call Uncle Johnnys to see if they knew anyone who could help. Pogo just could not sleep outside with a wet bag after hiking in a cold rain.  
Gary at Uncle Johnnys was able to get us a shuttle back to their hostel, stating he would stay open til we got there so we could get towels for hot showers and told us of some places we could get food delivered to us. He also arranged a shuttle back to the trail the next day. He even had Pogo dry her bag in their own dryer, not one the hikers use.  I cannot praise Uncle Johnnys enough.  It was a serious situation, one we got ourselves into, and one we needed help getting out of and Uncle Johnnys was there to help.
We hit the trail the next day. Mornin Glory decided to hike past the place we were going to camp at. We barely got to our camp site before dark, passing up trail magic because we wanted to get set up before dark. While we were eating, a young man named Uno Socko came into camp. He had been at the trail magic we passed up.  He sat with us while we ate and offered us a candy bar he got from the trail magic. He said it was funny how we blew past it and turned it down. We explained we were afraid of not making camp before dark and explained that we got a late start due to our wet gear issues.  We told him about our adventures on Beauty Spot and laughed about it now that it was a distant memory.  We also blamed it on our friends and told him we needed to pick better friends. Lol
Guess what? You know those things you swear you will never do again?? Well, we looked at Guthooks and Awol and talked with Ms Janet and decided to camp at Bradley Gap, which all 3 stated was a valid camp site. Well Bradley Gap is NOT a gap or camp spot. It is a slight depression dividing Big Hump bald from Little Hump, almost like a mini bald. We experienced 40 to 60 mile an hour winds with the stakes coming out again. Each time the stake would come out, Pogo had to get out and restake it. The winds were worse this night and sadly we did not have any friends near us to help out. Or to blame! Lol
This morning, when we crossed Big Hump, the wind blew us sideways. We had a hard time walking. We were told there were 50 mph winds with gusts up to 80 mph. There is a post on FB for the 2017 AT class that shows a person trying to cross one of the balds near us. It is very similar to what we experienced. 
We have made it to Roan Mountain, TN in spite of ourselves. Snow is expected so we will wait until Saturday. We are safe and warm at the Doe River Hostel. They are very accommodating and caring. Our friends, Mornin Glory and Sweet Tea will be here tomorrow.  It is raining hard even now and it makes me grateful to be inside.","

Honey Badger ran out of food, someone gave her days worth. Pogo lost her bandana and she found one later on. Chicken, a man hiking in our ""bubble "" had a tree branch fall on his tent. He was not injured but his tent received a huge tear in the shape of a ""T."" We were taking a break at a shelter when Chicken came up. I asked if he was going to hike on further. He explained about his tent and said he needed to make repairs, but needed tape to do it. What did he find at this shelter? An entire roll of duct tape!!  I was hiking one day and was running low on water, the next source was a few miles away.  It was a warm day and the climb to Snowbird Mountain was higher and longer than expected so I consumed more than I would ordinarily have. When we got to the top of Snowbird Mountain, people were giving away trail magic, with plenty of water! 
Uncanny things like this happen with frequency. I'm not sure if its because of the unbelievable amount of generosity of people, from hikers to strangers or if its because we appreciate such small, simple gestures, which provide a huge luxury to those who hike. If you are ever looking for the good in humanity, put on some hiking shoes and hike, you will soon find it in abundance.","

Raid,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564242,"Our daughter wanted to hike a few days with me. Because we were delayed due to the weather, my husband brought her and a friend up to Roan Mountain, TN. The terrain from there to Damascus is a good place for someone to hike who has not been doing a lot of it. The hills are not as daunting and there is plenty of water supplies (at this time), so no heavy water carries.
We hiked 9 miles the first day, making it to the shelter. The 2nd day, both girls felt their knees were injured and needed to get off the trail. Through Guthooks application, we found a hostel just 0.3 miles off the trail. We hiked into Scotty VanGogh's hostel. He happened to be there and agreed to bring the girls into Johnson City so they could stay at a hotel waiting for my husband to pick them up later in the week. 
Pogo and I continued on our hike. My foot was really aggravated, it has been hurting since two days before Erwin. But we are all in some form of pain, so I ignored it. That night at the shelter, after eating, I knew I needed to stand up and hang my food bag. I just didn't feel I could do it with the pain. After hanging the bag, I climbed into my tent. The wind was blowing again, this time INTO the shelter, so I decided to set up on the back side of the shelter and use it for a wind block. We were so tired of the blowing wind, we wanted a break. As soon as I climbed into my tent, now protected from the wind it died down! LOL I thought that was pretty funny, but was still willing to appreciate the break from the noise of the wind. 
The next day, we were headed towards Black Bear Resort and Hostel. It was a 0.6 mile walk down a paved road. We packed up in the rain, noting how our packs were heavier because our tents and tarps were wet. During the day, I had to tell Pogo I needed to come off the trail, something was wrong with my foot, every step was a shock wave going through it. I had not mentioned how much pain I was in so she was surprised, but again, everyone is in pain so I never thought to say anything, I just tied my shoes tighter, which seemed to help. I doubled up on Naproxen which barely took the edge off.  
Before we got to the hostel, we found a donkey in a very small fenced in area. I picked some grass and fed it to the donkey. He then started his wind up for a big bray. He initially started to sound as though he was having an asthma attack. Pogo asked what he was doing, wheezing and breathing heavy. I told her I thought he was going to bray. He kept at this heavy breathing until finally, I guess his lungs were full of air and he let loose with a very loud and joyous bray. The bray kept on going and we were trying to shush him because there were ""keep out"" signs everywhere. But we were laughing to hard to have any effect on the donkey. Plus he seemed so happy to have had that small bit of grass, we didn't want to take any of his happiness away. When he was done, I said to him, ""You are welcome!""  It did seem as though he was thanking us.
We made the 6 miles to the hostel. I told the owner I needed to get into an Urgent Care facility. She asked what was wrong and looked at my swollen foot. She told me the symptoms seemed similar to her stress fracture and that it would be a waste to go to the Urgent Care in town since they didn't have an Xray machine. She also said it probably would not show up on an xray anyway. With that information, I called my husband and asked him to come and get me, I wanted the Sports Medicine Dr I had worked with to look at it. For the record, you cannot get cell service there at the hostel but they are willing to let you make along distance call, if you keep it short.
Pogo and I talked and I said that I was hoping I could meet her in or just north of Damascus if my foot was not badly injured, then maybe I could slack pack these miles while others were at Trail Days. Sweet Tea and Mornin Glory were taking some time off the trail to meet with family, so Pogo had hoped she would be able to catch up with them.  Pogo left the next morning. It was hard to see her go, I have been hiking behind her for almost 4 weeks, in our slow steady rhythm that has steadily brought us north.  I will miss her humor and friendship.
My husband came to get me and seemed surprised at the amount of swelling in my foot. On our way home, I made an appointment for the next day at the Dr office. They took xrays and the film shows very clearly, two large breaks in my foot. The Dr looked at the xray, got a big smile on her face and said, ""You broke it good!""  When I explained what I had been doing and that I still had so many more miles to hike and I had planned this for 3 years, she lost her smile and said, ""I hate that for you."" It's a southern colloquial that says it all.
The type of break I have will take a least 8 weeks to heal, too much time for me to get back on the trail and complete it this year. I have not had time to process this news, there are many emotions I am feeling, it is beyond disappointing.",,"Hampton, TN","May 06, Sat",0
Raid,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/564542,"During my short hike, I stayed at several hostels. Each hostel has its own personality. 
My first was the NOC. It has roomy bunkhouses that were clean. Some of them are a short walk to the bathhouse so if being close to that area is important to you, ask when you check in to be close to it. There is also a communal kitchen with many tables to sit at.  Laundry is done near the General  Store and there is an outfitter located on premise. I was able to buy a filter there since mine had gone haywire on me. The restaurant on campus has good food but a bit on the pricey side. Resupply is available. Cell service was decent.
Cabin in the Woods was at Stecoah Gap. Our cabin was clean and bright with a full kitchen. She will also make supper for you for an additional fee, I did this and had a wonderful home cooked meal. Laundry is available for extra money and she will do it for you. No resupply is available. I did have cell service.
Leaving the Smokies, I stayed at Standing Bear Hostel. The resupply was the best on the trail that I encountered. It is done on the honor system, you keep track of what you take and square up at the end of your stay. Frozen pizza and beer is available, there is a partial kitchen. You do your own laundry on a wash board but there is a dryer available. There is a charging station for phones, but no cell service. There is a bunkhouse, camping and a cabin. Two showers, one of them is outdoors and just a privy is available. The people are helpful and it was a place to take shelter after getting out of the Smokies.
I stayed at Laughing Heart in Hot Springs, located at the southern end of the trail when it comes into town.  Laundry costs extra but they have a person who does it for you so you can run your errands while that is being done. The hostel does have camping in the yard as well as semi-private, private and bunkhouse rooms. A kitchen is on site and there are two bathrooms. The bathrooms and kitchen were cleaned  each morning but there is a sign that encourages people to clean the kitchen after use. I know that Honey Bee did dishes one morning, as did I just to help out.  Resupply is done in town, but the hostel has a ""hiker table"" loaded with things you can use such as shampoo, baby powder, etc. These are things that hikers have left behind for others to use. Jeff is the manager and was friendly and professional. At this time, they do take reservations. Cell service was decent.
I next stayed at Uncle Johnny's in Erwin. It is located right off the trail. Camping in the yard or along the river is allowed and they have cabins and a bunkhouse. We camped along the river which was cooler since the breeze came off the river. It was cheaper than camping in the yard, but is located just across the road so it feels as though you are still on campus. There is a bathhouse and laundry. You do your own laundry but your name must be on the signup board to save  your place. They offer two shuttles into town to eat at restaurants and for resupply. They do have a small outfitter shop. Some area restaurants will deliver. There is an incredible hammock pavilion that is covered and includes a picnic table with charging station for electronics. When that was full we plugged our phones in at the sink in the bathroom and set them on shelves to keep them dry. We could only get cell service on the bridge across from Uncle Johnny's. You have to go almost to middle of the bridge to get service.
We left Uncle Johnny's thinking we could get resupply at Greasy Creek Friendly Hostel. After sleeping on the bald and getting Pogo's quilt soaked, we needed to get into Greasy Creek to have a dry place to sleep. Pogo talked with the lady on the phone and explained the situation. She said they would not turn anyone down and would find an indoor place for her to stay. They are located 0.6 miles off the trail, difficult terrain to hike in and I would avoid going there if at all possible just for this reason. When we got to Greasy Creek, the lady was not there and her husband had no idea we were coming. We again explained the situation and his solution was to put Pogo outside under a covered porch with her soaked quilt. We asked if we could dry her quilt and he said that was not allowed. Mornin Glory was already there and she was a bit upset at the situation, so we decided to call Uncle Johnnys to see if they could help. Gary at Uncle Johnny's arranged for a shuttle to pick us up and bring us back to Uncle Johnny's. I think there was probably a communication breakdown between the two owners at Greasy Creek but we really needed to be able to rely on getting into dry accommodations and they could not offer that to us. Also, there is only one bathroom to accommodate all of the hikers.  There is a bunk house and private rooms in the house with camping in the yard that costs $10.00.  There is a very limited resupply and had we known how limited, we would have just carried extra food and not gone off trail to the hostel.
There is a new hostel near Sams Gap called Natures Inn Hostel and Cabins, their number is 828-216-1611. This is a beautiful setting with clean bathrooms, laundry and a creek outside each cabin. Camping is available also. I got cell service at the gap and was told you can get service on site. I did not use my phone on site so cannot confirm that. She has some resupply and is building more inventory, asking us what hikers want as she was doing a grocery run and wanted to get a better selection. At the time I was there, they were opened only one month. I was very short food and was able to get a full resupply for the 3 days I needed.  I would recommend this place for sure. They did not charge me to shuttle from the trail head and back since I spent money on resupply. 
When we got to Roan Mountain, Pogo had a package to pick up at Mountain Harbour B&B and Hostel. They were closed from 11:30 to 1:00 for cleaning. We had bad weather coming in and wanted to get camp set up. No one was around to let us know where we could do that. Pogo hiked back to the trail head as there was a man there who was giving out trail magic who also had a hostel. We made arrangements to stay at his place, Doe River Hostel.  It costs $30.00, but includes laundry (though you do your own) and free shuttles to town, as many times as you like. The hostel has rooms in the house and in a mobile home. We stayed in the mobile home, it has a full kitchen, two baths and can sleep 7 people with washer and dryer in the mobile home. Dave, the owner is very accommodating, running us into town when needed. He also brought us to a Thai restaurant with very good food. Roan Mountain has several good restaurants, rivaling Hot Springs. In Roan Mountain, there is a brick oven pizza place that is incredible. Eat there, you won't regret it. Doe River Hostel has some resupply, but it is limited and he will bring you into town to the grocery store or Dollar General. Stay at this place, it is well worth it. Cell service was available.
The last place I stayed was Black Bear Resort and Hostel. It is 0.6 miles down a road from the trail head. It is an easy walk on a paved road. This place is beautiful, clean and professionally run. It has cabins, bunkhouse and camping. Laundry is available as well as a good resupply. They will shuttle to town for a fee. Frozen pizza and sandwiches an be purchased as well as other snacks. The bathrooms and cabins were clean with everyone voting this as the best shower on the trail so far, the water pressure was great and hot, hot water! No cell service but they will allow you to make a long distance call if you keep it short.
Remember, these are hostels, not 5 star hotels, though Cabin in the Woods, Natures Inn and Black Bear were definitely cleaner than the others, you will need to lower your expectations when staying in hostels. With the exception of Greasy Creek Friendly, everyone was helpful and accommodating.  I hope this helps you plan a small part of your southern area hike. Most of these can be found on Guthooks but you could enter their information into your phone ahead of time. If you get in a dire strait, don't hesitate to call the hostels and ask if they have any connections near to where you are, they do want to help.",,View Entry,"May 14, Sun",0
