I hiked beside the Housatonic River for a few miles and the bugs were so bad, I finally had to use the head net that I have been carrying. Stopped at a shelter for lunch and took a nap.

I decided it was time to get up. In one mile I came to the road that led to Cornwall Bridge, Ct.and I decided since I was only going 12 miles, why not go to town. I had 2 breakfast sandwiches, 2 cold drinks and only one ice cream. After that it was just getting in the miles on a very hot day. I saw in some comments that there was a Coke machine at the road 0.3 mile past the campsite. I had to have a cold drink so I continued to the road.

I made one big climb today so it wasn’t too hard of a hike. Tomorrow I will have 3 big ones with one very steep downhill. That will be first tomorrow which is why I stopped short today.  I saw these Grouse chicks running up the trail, the mother ran across the trail dragging a wing to distract me.  When I walked past the spot where she crossed, she exploded out of the grass and flew away.

It was tough for about a half mile. Mt Race was next and was much longer in distance but not very steep and the climb down wasn’t bad. The last and hardest was Mount Everett. It was less than a mile but steep all the way, but still not as bad as I thought it would be. I stopped about 6.5 miles from Great Barrington because my bus doesn’t go until 5PM and I don’t want to be in town all day with nothing to do.

I got to the shelter about 5:30 and tented, it got dark again and sprinkled for a few seconds and that was the rain for the day.  Water sources are getting scarce so some rain would help.","Great Barrington

Then in a couple more miles there was a drink stand at a road crossing and I couldn’t pass that up. Then I ran into a South bound hiker who was from Lincoln so I talked with him for a while. By the time I got to the biggest climb of the day it was 11:30, so much for my early start. I had planned on going to a cabin on Upper Goose Pond but it was on a half mile side trail and I decided if I had to hike a half mile today and again tomorrow, I might as well hike 1.6 miles on the trail and have air conditioning tonight.","South Mount Wilcox Shelter

I stopped at the first shelter at about 7.5 miles and if I would have had a signal I would have made plane reservations right there. Instead I took a nap and then I read some of the book I was reading and then ate lunch. After a while another hiker showed up and then a young couple. We talked a while and after 2 hours I put my pack on and hiked another 8.8 miles to the next shelter, in a much better mood. The Cookie Lady wasn’t home and it rained hard but I was all right with that. Just before the last climb of the day I got trail magic.

Had the biggest climb in a long time, until tomorrow, right after leaving Dalton. It went pretty good, I had ice cream on my mind, when I got to Cheshire. Tomorrow will be harder, much bigger climb and the leaving town blues. Temperature is only supposed to be in the upper 70’s so that will help.

I hadn’t even gone a half mile when, stepping up a wet boulder, my left foot started to slide. I could feel a great stress in my left leg and I thought it was going to break. I fell off the boulder and off the side of the hill, not a cliff but a steep incline, but I grabbed a tree and hung on. I waited until I could access the leg and when I decided it wasn’t broken I crawled back to the trail. I had to go back down the hill to retrieve one of my poles, that I threw during the fall. I knew I needed both poles to hike. I had over 3 miles to hike to Cooper Lodge, from there I took a side trail to the top of Killington Ski Resort. It was only 0.2 mile, but most of it was a straight up boulder scramble. Once there I rode the gondola down to the bottom where I caught a bus to Rutland and the urgent care clinic. X-rays showed no break just an intermediate ankle sprain. It wasn’t long after that I decided I would rather be home than hiking, so it was time to go. I know how Forest Gump felt when he was running coast to coast and said, “I think I’ll go home now”.  I made it almost 1700 miles and the trail will still be there but if I decide to finish it, because I am now a section hiker instead of a thru-hiker.","Mile 1693.3
