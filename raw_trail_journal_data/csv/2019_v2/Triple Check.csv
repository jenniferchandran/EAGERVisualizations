He hiked the trail in '16 and will be having burgers, dogs, mac salad, beans, all the ingredients for a good garbage plate.                            Rain every day since we started the hike.  I am trying to ""embrace the suck"", as I walk the trail - which is a stream with all the rain.  I am glad Tetris is with me for my first week out.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Halfway to Woods Hole ""Safety Chute"" caught up with me and she gave it to me. This morning I'm packing my backpack and still a bit disorganized and misplacing things and ""Safety Chute' said "" You have to do a lot of double checking'"" and I said ""Triple checking"" and she said ""Hey, that should be your Trail Name. As ""Tetris"" says you have to let the Trail name you.                    Kudos to Paul (Bear Bag) Wetzel who cooked us a most delicious ""garbage plate"".

So ""Safety Chute"", ""Lone Star"", ""Jesse"", ""210"", ""Tetris"", and I all enjoyed burgers and cokes.

Turned out he was born in Rochester NY at the same hospital I was.                                                 After shower and all laundry done, about 10 of us took the 4 o'clock shuttle into Hiawassee for dinner and resupply.

Stopped at Standing Indian Shelter about 4.9 miles in to cook a hot lunch since I didn't cook last night. As I was setting up Safety Chute came wandering in. It was great to see her. She had pulled into Muskrat a little after me last night having taken the later shuttle to the trail head. She gave me a  half of a tomato to add to my Ramen. The rest of the trail to Carter Gap wasn't bad and weather comfortable. Only 2 of us in shelter tonight. Hiker named Ray and me. Lone Star set up his tarp,"Muskrat Creek Shelter

Climbed Albert Mountain fire tower today at little after 11 am and had excellent views of the surrounding area. The last 80 feet or so of Albert was an almost vertical rock scramble climb where you just put away your hiking poles since they are no use.     Called Marilyn, Bryant, and Neil from the top,  the 100 mile mark of the AT.         Heavy rain and sleet started right on schedule with a little less than 3 miles to the shelter. Rock Gap Shelter holds about 5 people. There were four of us in there when this couple show up from the nearby Gap road wondering if we had room for 9 people. Apparently they had a group of young adults on a hike. She even suggested that we could take the shuttle van that was at the Gap into Franklin. Uh... No thanks.","Carter Gap Shelter

Triple Check,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607598,"This morning we woke up to freezing cold. The rope on my Ursack (food bag made of a bullet proof materl tied around tree to protect food from bears and critters) was frozen. It took about 15 minutes but with the help of a young hiker Eli, we got it off the tree. But I still couldn't open it and  Jesse bailed me out with a couple of protein bars.                When I got to Winding Stair Gap at 10am I was lucky enough to get a ride immediately into Franklin NC from a shuttle driver named Beverly who transports from the trail head and around town for a donation. She dropped me off at the Budget Inn where Lone Star was in the office. We split the price of the room for 2 nights. Taking a zero (no hiking) tomorrow.                               We walked to Motor Co Grill for lunch of burgers, beer, and chocolate milkshake.                                                         This evening we went to Mulligan's for dinner.  Shortly after we sat down a group of 4 hikers came in including Ray (Pantry) who I'd met a couple days ago and sat in the booth next to us. A few seconds later Ray and this other guy came up and said ""Your Triple Check, I'm Halo"" I said "" Finally! I meet you, I meet  Halo"".  I'd been hearing about Halo from my second or third day on trail. People would ask ""Have you met Halo"", I would see every other day some encouragement to Halo laid out in sticks on the trail. His wife who is very supportive has left encouraging messages on my journal page as well as others who are hiking around her husbands trek. I'm glad I finally met him.","Rock Gap Shelter

Actually I haven't slept well at anytime on the trail.                                                                    This morning was freezing. Fingers were numbly cold. Gloves and rain proof mittens hardly helped warm up in the cold rain , sleet and yes half. Feeling sick already and hiking very slowly I looked at my options and decided to try and call The Nantahala Mountain Lodge/Hostel. I saw they picked up at Burningtown Gap just a couple miles ahead. Luckily they answered and had a bed available.                                                   ""Wiggy"" who hiked the entire trail in 2010 and his wife own and operate the place. Because I'm feeling sick they accommodated me in an area isolated from the other guests.                                   Weather is mostly miserable for the rest of weekend and into next week.

Triple Check,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607922,"Got shuttle from Microtel at 8am this morning to drive me back to Burningtown Gap to continue hike. Weather supposed to be good today. Started out by 9am.                                 Met a hiker ""Bear Bait"" who had camped near Cold Spring shelter and was just starting her day hiking and we hiked together a couple of miles. It was nice to have someone to talk to. She was meeting her boyfriend at the NOC and in Fontana on Thursday.                      Later when I got to Telico Gap I walked around a utility truck with 4 workers to sit on the steps on the opposite side of the road and have a snack. Major power lines go through this Gap. As I started eating one of the workers came over and said apologetically that I would have to move. He even offered me a bottle of water, which of course I accepted. He explained that they were having helicopter tree trimming in the area. Yeah, apparently they trim trees around these power lines using some kind of blade hanging from a helicopter.  Now that would have been cool to see.      So much for being a nice day all day. Rain started around 1 pm.                             My left knee started to bother me for the first time today. Lot of downhill sections this afternoon. I readjusted my knee strap, added voltaren ointment, took an ibuprofen, and slowed down a bit, all of which helped finish out my longest day so far.","Burningtown Gap

Triple Check,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607989,I started this hike with no goals or expectations in mind. I just wanted to get out and sense life on the trail. To really get a taste of the trail community.   I think I did. I met many nice people along the way. I was physically challenged more than I have been in years and enjoyed the challenge. I will continue to hike sections of the trail. Marilyn and I are planning hiking the Virginia Highlands this spring.                     Thanks to everyone who commented and gave encouragement.                                                                               Bill,"
