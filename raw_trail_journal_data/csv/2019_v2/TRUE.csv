TRUE,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607275,"Broke in my boots for the northern part of the hike today. Plan on starting in boots, moving into trail runners for the middle and back into boots for the high north. I'm a big fane of the La Sportiva boots, they are as light as some of my running shoes and give great support. Just a few weeks till I hit the trail.","

TRUE,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608114,"Its ETA 5 days till the great northern march starts. All plans are in place, 10 resupply boxes made up, all gear and 1st 5 days of food packed up ( weighing it at 32 lbs, less water). I will arrive at Amicalola Falls the afternoon on the 19th. Will make my way up the approach trail that afternoon to start my official northern trek from Springer Mtn,GA; southern terminus of the A; to Katahdin Mtn MA; northern terminus. My resupply boxes Ashley will mail out for every 100-150 miles I cover getting them to prearranged mail drops along the towns of the AT. I will be coming off the trail somewhere in VT for a week to attend my nieces wedding. Along the way I will post pictures, events, and my thoughts of how the trail is going.  I can not express the joy and love I have for my wife; Ashley; for being so supportive to me as I put myself away from our life in such a traditional time. She is my best friend and greatest supporter. To all my friends and family; some who think I've lost a screw; thank you for the support and well wishes. Follow along  my epic journey  on this journal, you might find its a laugh, a cry, sometimes even a holy sh%t, but its all part of life on the trail.",,View Entry,"Mar 15, Fri",0
TRUE,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608380,"Waiting at the Huntsville Airport on my Flight to Atlanta. I’m about crawl out of my skin with 50% excitement and 50% “Oh Shit, this just became real!” Hoping to make good time to check in and start the approach trail. Depending on time I will get as far up Springer Mtn today for the official start as planned on the 20th. I mailed off my 1 and 2 mail drops yesterday so they should be there at n plenty of time waiting on me. Left my wife with tearing eyes and lots of love between us. I could not have done this nor can I complete the massive undertaking with her support. Footnote: At a small local PO in Ryland, AL. mailing out my food drops, the post office worker Mindy asked if I was going for a thru hike of the AT. Then showed me a Yearbook done by AT thru hike Odie, she says yearly he drives and hikes up and down the AT taking pictures of hikers for the years book. So if you see Odie on the trail give him a shout out and buy a yearbook, well when the 2019 comes out. Small world is full of wonderful small towns. See you on the trail! TRUE","

TRUE,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608562,"3/19: arrived into Atlanta airport and the REI shuttle took me up to Springer Mtn. 1 mile into the trail. So at 330 pm I strapped my pack up and did the 1 mike back walk to the official Southern terminus of the AT, took my starting pic and started North. Only did d additional 2.8 and camped at Stover creek, very cold night. But I was just fine in my tent as long as I didn’t roll off the sleep pad. 3/20 1st full day. Stover to Gooch Mtn Shelter 12.9 miles. Good hike weather has been amazing. Spent the night in the shelter, not bad sleeping. Today was a hard push. 15.6 miles. With a last push up Blood Mtn. Highest Mtn in Georgia section of the AT. Made it into Neels Gap and staying the night at Mountain Crossing. It’s trail magic when we got settled into the hostel. The great people at Emanuel Baptist Church brought everyone an all you can eat pasta dinner with salad and garlic bread. What an amazing group of people. My heart and belly are full. Life has been good, feet hurt, legs tired, But what a life. PS: sorry for delay. Service in the woods is here and there.TRUE hiking North.","Gooch Mtn Shelter
