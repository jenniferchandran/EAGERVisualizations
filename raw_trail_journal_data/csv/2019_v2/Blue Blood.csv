Blue Blood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582583,"Tonight was another night of planning and thinking... no, dreaming about the trail. My hike, which is still over year out, is the product of a collision between what I believe in and what I dream of: helping others and hiking. I love hiking and want desperately to make it to Katahdin. I want to complete a thru-hike and can't explain why. Some coworkers understand it, but really only the ones who also hike get it, most of them think I'm crazy. But that's okay, like any passion in life only those who share it will really get it. I'm not trying to escape anything, I'm not trying to find myself or my passions; I know who I am and what I'm about. I imagine its the competitive side of me in many ways that attracts me to the trail. Its such a small sliver of society that can claim a thru-hike, its the major league of hiking. But I never thought I would have a chance to do it until I started working with the special needs community. Weird segue, I know, but bear with me. 

First off, I don't want to give too much away, but I'm a Cop. Now that that's out there I'll tell you about what it has to do with me hiking the AT and the special needs community. At my agency I'm on two special teams, I'm a member of our Search and Rescue team and a Team Leader for our Project Lifesaver Team. Project Lifesaver is a program we offer, for free, to our citizens who have special needs and are at risk for wandering and/or getting lost. Our most common clients are those on the Autism Spectrum and those with Alzheimer's or Dementia though we offer the service to anyone who could benefit from it. Our current equipment consists of a small wearable transmitter, about the size of a watch, which emits a radio frequency we can track using hand held receivers should the client go missing from the caregiver. I started to toy around with the idea of a fundraiser to purchase more receivers and upgrade our current equipment to newer and more effective models as well as organizing an outreach event between our jurisdiction's special needs community and its first responders (Law Enforcement, EMS, Fire, and Dispatch). As I sat around wondering how to organize a fundraiser or event like that I thought of other fundraisers I had heard of. In particular I thought of Jeff Alt and his book... A Walk for Sunshine. He hiked the AT to raise money for the facility where his brother received care... why couldn't I hike the AT for this? 

I suddenly realized all the possibilities... I could use this to pull the spotlight onto our special needs community and the importance of specialized training and education for the First Responders who interact with that community. I could raise awareness for a cause close to my heart and close to home and raise money for a program that has saved lives and will continue to save more. 

So here I am, pouring over maps and guidebooks, reading reviews for some lighter gear, and thinking about how I'm gonna pull this loose idea together into something real. Only 14 more months to go... I guess I better hurry!

Until next time,

Blue Blood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583072,"It was a short hike, but it was a hike nontheless. Today, with the Fiance in Tennessee visiting family, I decided to head into the mountains for a short hike. Just to get out and stretch the legs. I hit Dobie Mountain and made a loop on the Albright Trail and the Appalachian Trail. It was short hike at only 4 miles, but it felt great to get out and put some miles on my boots today.",,View Entry,"Feb 14, Wed",0
Blue Blood,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583071,"Once more, here I am, planning and dreaming about this project of mine. I've been pouring over articles, books, and studies on special needs in America and training guidelines for First Responders. I find myself bouncing between working on my presentations for potential sponsors and trying to plan the hike itself to the day. I know, I know; there is probably no point in planning the hike itself as anything can and likely will happen to disrupt my schedule. But, nonetheless, I find it comforting to attempt to plan it out. At the very least it gives me a rough idea of my timeline and where to stop along the way for mail, resupply, and zeroes. Zero/Nero days have become something I think a lot about. That probably seems silly since I'm not on the trail yet and won't be for over a year, but I think about my fiance, Randi, who, for some inexplicable reason, is supporting my project. She's putting up with a lot and I can't help but want to insure that I get plenty of days along the trail with her to remind her how much I appreciate her patience and support. Anyways, I'll continue to work on the project and will hopefully have a little more to share with you in my next entry besides ""still at it""!Till next time!",,View Entry,"Feb 19, Mon",0
