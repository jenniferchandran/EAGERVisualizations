Jumping from the CDT to the AT
   
I am a little bit disappointed that I will not be able to complete the CDT this year, but it seems very clear to me that with over 300% above average snowfall out west it is going to be many weeks before ALL of Colorado, the Winds Range of WY, and possibly the southern section of Yellowstone will dry out and be cleared of blowdowns and avalanche debris.
So... I am jumping east to hike the 723 miles of the AT from Hanover, NH to Harpers Ferry, WV.  I am thinking about 45 days to arrive in HF on August 2nd.
Amazingly I was able to get from Dubois, WY to Denver, CO to Portland, Maine in just 36 hours via hitching and flying standby.
I will stay a week with my son and his family in Southern Maine before heading to Hanover.

Ready to Go on the AT
In the past few days I was able to dump several pounds of winter weight gear from the CDT that I won't need on the AT.
I also sprayed all of my clothes and gear with Permethrin to help repell ticks.
       
To me, Hanover to Harpers Ferry is one of the best sections of the AT to hike in the summer. 
I can do this with a very light pack since I don't need to carry winter weight gear, and I don't need to carry much food and water at any given time.
After already thru-hiking the AT, the PCT, and hiking a big chuck of the CDT, these next six weeks or so on the AT should be a joy.
I am looking forward to a long hike with no pressure to push big miles every day, less extreme sun, less extreme hot/cold weather conditions, less extreme altitudes, and Much Less Stress about navigating the trail. I also will be covering what I feel is home ground.

One Day to the AT
Happy Fathers Day
     
The other day I went to the supermarket to get food for the first 47 mile section of my trek from Hanover, NH to Inn at Long Trail/Rutland, VT.
My pack is now 100% ready to go - and so am I.
Tomorrow morning I catch a Greyhound bus for the nine hour ride to Hanover, NH via Boston, MA.
If all goes well I should arrive in Hanover about 5:00pm.
The AT goes right through downtown Hanover, and the bus stop is actually right on the trail.
I will get a quick bit to eat in town then I only need to hike a few miles to get out of town to where there are campsites and water sources.

Inn at Long Trail
Sherburne Pass, Vermont
     
I was able to catch an earlier bus from Boston to Hanover, NH and arrived about 2:30 pm.
As usual I am getting on trail with more food than I will probably need, so rather than stop to eat at a local cafe I grabbed some stuff from my food bag and started following the AT white blaze's right down Main Street in Hanover for the mile or so to the Connecticut River bridge. The trail goes across the bridge into the quaint little village of Norwich, VT and then into woods heading westerly for about 43 miles to Killington, VT.
    
As expected, I feel 10 times more at home hiking the Long Green Tunnel of the AT than I do the mostly sunny, totally exposed trails out west. 
I love the lush green trees and ferns, the moss covered rocks, and the sounds of dozens of differnt types of birds singing, especially in the early morning.
Even though I got a late start out of Hanover on Monday,  I hiked seven miles to Podunk Brook and found a nice flat tent site. I passed a few NOBO thru-hikers but I was the only one camping at the brook.
I was on the trail about 6:30 am on Tuesday and hiked about 15 miles to a nice stealth campsite near a spring for water. Again I passed about a dozen NOBO hikers. It sounds like I am the only SOBO hiker they have seen in several days.
Yesterday I hiked about 15 miles to the Stoney Brook Shelter. I cooked my dinner at the shelter and chatted with several NOBO hikers there, then set up camp by myself near a stream a few hundred feet up the trail.
So far all I've seen is a few chipmunks and squirrels. I heard at least one deer near my tent last night and I saw a couple piles of moose turds on the trail.  No bear sightings yet although I am sure I will be seeing some as I get farther south.
Word on the trail was that a major rain storm is heading our way starting mid-day today until mid-day tomorrow.
This morning I packed up and got on trail before 6:00 am.
I hiked about eight miles to my favorite stop on the entire AT - The Inn at Long Trail.
This is a very comfortable New England country Inn that serves a great breakfast included with the room. It also has an Irish Pub for lunch and dinner. I have stayed here several times before on different hikes.
I got here about 10:00 am, just before a torrential rain storm hit.
I took a hot shower, washed my clothes and had a burger and beer in the pub.
I will have dinner there a little later this evening.
I still have several days of food in my bag so no need to resupply until Manchester, VT about 50 miles down the trail. 
Even though it might be raining, I am getting back on trail after breakfast tomorrow.  
I should get to Manchester Monday morning.

Inn at Long Trail to Clarendon Shelter
17 miles.
       This morning I left the Inn at Long Trail and hiked over Killington Peak in a light foggy mist. It slowly started clearing a short time later and the afternoon was beautiful as I hiked over Mendon Peak and Shrewsbury Peak to Clarendon Shelter.  
The trail had a bunch of short sections that were mud ruts with no place to go but to walk straight through them. No Big Deal. 
I saw about 20 northbound hikers today and a few at the shelter. 
They are a mix of AT thru-hikers, Long Trail hikers, and a few weekend hikers.
I cooked my dinner at the shelter and then set my tent up on a nice spot in the trees away from the shelter.

Clarendon Shelter to Big Branch Shelter.
17 miles
       I slept like a rock last night. I made breakfast and got on the trail about 7:00 am. 
There is a road crossing about a 1.5 miles up the trail where the very popular Loretta's Good Food Deli is just .9 down the road.
I got to the road crossing and walked to Lorretta's with visions of hot coffee and breakfast sandwich, and a meat ball sandwich to take with me for dinner. I got there at 8:00 am only to discover she doesn't open until 10:00am on Saturdays.
Bummer !!!
I hitched a ride back to the trailhead with a nice older couple of hikers.
As I got out of the car they gave me trail mix bars and boxes of little jelly beans.
Not exactly what I had hoped for this morning, but it was good Trail Magic anyways.
I hiked through Clarendon Gorge, then up past Airport Lookout, Domed Ledge, White Rocks, and the Rock Garden.
The Rock Garden is actually a couple of spots along the trail where over the years locals have piled dozens of the sandy colored stones into interesting cairn type figures.
The trail down the mountain from White Rocks to Little Rock Pond is especially muddy. 
From there it is a short hike to the aptly named Big Brook River and the Big Shelter.
I ate dinner at the shelter with four nobo section hikers then set my tent up a ways away down by the river.

Big Branch Shelter to VT Rt 11/30 Manchester, VT
16 miles
     
I got up at 4:30 am, had a quick breakfast and got on the trail before 6:00 am in hopes of getting to Manchester by dinner time.
I hiked up and over Baker Peak, down along Griffiths Lake, then up and over Peru Peak, Styles Peak, down and across Mad Tom Road, then up and over Bromley Mountain to the Rt 11/30 trailhead to Manchester.
Again I passed about about 18 nobo hikers.
On top of Baker Peak this morning I met hiker FLYBY who also hiked the PCT in 2016, and she did the CDT last year. I did not met her on either trail, but we have many mutual hiker friends from both trails. 
FLYBY told me one of my German friends from both trails FLOWERMAN is on the AT this year.
She didn't know exactly where he is behind her, but she has his text number and sent him a message to keep and eye out for me coming his way. 
FLOWERMAN and I started the PCT on the same day and saw each other many times along the trail. 
I ran into him on the CDT last year as I was hiking south of the Chinese Wall in Montana.
Chances are we will meet again on this trail sometime soon.
Today several nobo hikers told me some people had set up Trail Magic Beef Stew, fruit, and baked goods at Mad Tom Road.
D'hooo. The Trail Magic was over and gone by the time I got there late this afternoon.
Double Bummer !!!
Not to worry. I got to Rt 11/30 about 4:30pm, quickly got a hitch to the Manchester Econolodge, showered and changed, and had an Awesome Prime Rib dinner and beer at the Ravens Den Steakhouse and Tap Room. YUM.
Tomorrow I will go into town to do laundry, get food at the Price Chopper, and relax by the motel pool.Tueday morning I will get back on trail for the 55 mile trek to Willistown/North Adams, Massachusetts. I should be there on Friday.

Great Barrington, MA
Manchester, VT to Great Barrington, MA
125 miles
       
       
I hiked to the Rt. 23 trail head this afternoon and quickly got a hitch into town. 
I am feeling Great both physically and mentally.
I have not met any southbound hikers yet, but the majority of northbounders I am passing every day, or I meet at the shelters, greet me with big smiles and are happy to stop and chat a few minutes.
Going with the flow northbound most days they don't see any other hikers, and we all like to get a little trail info about what's happening up ahead of us.
I am only doing a quick cleanup and resupply in Great Barrington before getting back on trail in the morning, so no time for a detailed day by day report.
Briefly,
6/24  Hiked out of Mancherster, VT then over Spruce Peak, Prospect Rock, and around the base of Stratton Mtn since I have hiked it twice in the past, to Stratton Pond then tented at Story Spring Shelter.
6/25 I hiked over Glastonbury Mtn, went up the fire tower, then on to Little Pond Lookout, and I stealth camped by myself at Porcupine Outlook.
6/26 I hiked through Split Rock, crossed VT Rt 9, up over Harmon Hill, down past Beaver Ponds and tented near Seth Water Shelter.
6/27 I hiked across the border into Massachusetts to the Stop and Shop supermarket in Williamstown, MA.  I had panned to get a room in town, but there was a music festival going on that weekend and rooms were going for $200 a night and more, so I hung out at the market a few hours then hiked half way up Mt Greylock and tented at the Wilbur Clearing Shelter.
6/28  I hiked over Mt Williams then on up to the summit of Mt Greylock (highest point in MA) and got a excellent breakfast at the lodge. Then hiked on past Jones Nose Overlook and tented near the Mark Nobel Shelter.
6/29. I hiked a few miles to the Shell Station/C-store/Duncan Donuts in Cheshire, MA. There is a local outfitter a few miles away who will come and get hikers (Birkshire Outfitters) so I called and they brought me to the store where they put a new tip on one of my hiking poles, and I bought some propane cook fuel. They took me back to thr Shell station. I stopped and got a ice cream on my way out of town, then hiked over Cheshire Cobble to the Crystal Mtn Campsites.
6/30. I hiked a few miles into the town of Dalton, MA, had a great breakfast at the Juice N Java. I then bought a couple of hamburgers to go next door at Angelina's Sub Shop and hiked up over Warner Hill to October Mtn. Shelter. I had the burgers for dinner.
7/1. Hiked past the Beaver Bog, then over Beckett Mtn, crossed the Mass Turnpike, hiked past Upper Goose Pond, stopped at the AT Trail Stand and got a Coke and some cookies, then hiked up and over Tyrington Cobble, and found a really nice stealth campsite right next to a large brook.
7/2 Got up and on trail at 6:30 and got to the Great Barrington trailhead about 1:00pm.
I just picked up a few food items at Price Chopper and will hitch back to the trail head first thing tomorrow morning.
There are a series of small Connecticut towns coming up in the next week, so I don't know when or where I will do my next overnight stay.
My next update will probably be in a week or so.

This week I hiked from Great Barrington, MA to Fort Montgomery/Bear Mountain, NY. 
118 Miles
(See Photos link below)
        
Yesterday I hiked across the Bear Mountain Bridge over the Hudson River in New York still feeling great both physically and mentally. 
My original plan was to do a fast paced 723 mile hike between Hanover, NH and Harpers Ferry West Virginia in six weeks, finishing about August 1st.
Since I am not on a serious quest to complete a ""thru-hike"" this time, I switched mental gears from doing a fast paced 20+ miles per day trek to a northern or southern terminus, to a more relaxed 15 (+/-) miles per day pleasure cruise.
I still plan to hike into Harpers Ferry, WV about August 1st, so yesterday I got an Uber to take me about 100 miles down the trail to Delaware Water Gap, PA.
This will give me about 21 days to hike another 260 comfortable miles to Harpers Ferry.
Doing 600 miles on the AT this year is not the same as completing the last 1,400 miles of the CDT for my Triple Crown. 
This past week I did have serious thoughts about going back out to Colorado or Wyoming to at least get a few hundred more miles of the CDT completed:
But - I have happily come to fully accept that the East Coast is where I need to be this summer, and the 200 miles I did in Wyoming, plus these 600 AT miles will satisfy my inner long distance yearnings for this year.
This past week is been a long, mostly hot and humid trek from Great Barrinton, MA to Bear Mountain, NY.
I am still running into a steady flow of northbound thru-hikers, including four hikers I know from other trails.  
A few nights ago I camped at Wiley Shelter with Mama Lion and her 12 y/o son Boone, who I met on the PCT in Oregon and Washington, and Flowerman from Germany who I know from both the PCT and the CDT. The next morning I passed Lonesome Larry who I first met on the CDT in Montana last year.
Right now I am in a motel in Stroudsburg, PA getting ready to get back on trail tomorrow morning. 
Today I walked to Walmart to get food and some small stuff I need for the next section of this hike, and I did some much needed repairs to my backpack.
It looks like my next resupply stop will be in Hamburg, PA about 75 miles down trail.
I should be there about next Tuesday.

Pine Grove, PA
102 miles.
      
(See PHOTOS link below)
I hiked to the Pine Grove trailhead yesterday afternoon hot, tired, and stanky and quickly got a ride to the cool air conditioned Comfort Inn.
I guess much of the East is in the middle of a major heat wave, so this past week has been Very Hot and Humid. 
Fortunately hiking in the shade of the Long Green Tunnel was a bit cooler, but still the humidity zaps your energy, especially on the steep up hills, and I and my clothes were continually hot, damp and sticky. 
I guess it will be more of the same this coming week or so.
Pennsylvania is known as ""Rocksylvania"" by hikers for good reason. The entire AT is somewhat rocky, but here there are long sections of trail that are nothing but rocky ankle twisting walk ways and sections of huge hand over hand boulder piles.
I am not in a big hurry so the rocks aren't as annoying to me as they are to those trying to make big miles. To be fair PA also has many long sections of gently rolling less rocky trail.
I am still passing some northbound thru hikers but not as many as before.  
I have yet to see any bears or even hear about bear sightings from other hikers. When I hiked through here 11 years ago I saw several bears in PA and would regularly hear them near my tent at night.
I am getting back on trail this morning all fresh and showered with freshly washed clothes, but I am sure within a few minutes of hiking in the heat and humidity I will quickly revert back to a damp sticky hiking mode.
The next trail town is Duncannon, PA about 45 miles down the trail. The trail goes straight through town so I will probably just stop and get a good meal then hike on.
With the heat and rocks I am in no hurry so I should be there about Saturday.

Duncannon, PA
42 miles.
    
     
   
I hiked into the the mill town of Duncannon, PA Very Hot and Stanky.
This past week or so has been hot and humid, but its clear today and tomorrow are going to be the worst of the current major east coast Heat Wave.
As I said before, hiking in the shade of the Long Green Tunnel is a bit cooler, but still the humidity zaps your energy and it gets noticibly harder to breath when you pass through the occasional spots where the air is dead still.
There were a few streams where I was able to rinse out my shirt, rinse some of the sweat off my body, and start hiking wearing the cool damp shirt, but everything soon just gets hot, damp and stanky again.
The trail is getting much less rocky with long sections of mostly straight, gently rolling ridge running. There will always be some steep dips down to river valleys and low mountain passes and up the other side, but these are not as difficult as those up in the Northeast.
I am a bit suprised at the large number of northbound thru-hikers I am passing on the trail and those here in Duncannon.
They all know that they are at the end of the window to reasonably do a compete nobo thru-hike to Katahdin, so it's interesting how they now seem to be falling into distinct two categories:
1.) Those that are clearly determined to push 18-20 plus miles per day to get there before the end of September.
2.) Those who talk vaguely about ""trying"" to get there by mid-October, and mention they have been taking a lot of Zero Mile Days.
We all have to Hike Are Own Hike. I wish them all Good Luck and a Safe Journey.
Regarding my hike, I am really enjoying my Pleasure Cruise to Harpers Ferry. 
By going at a slower more comfortable pace I am feeling physically and mentally stronger and healthier than I ever have.
I am only about 123 miles from Harpers Ferry which means I only need to average an easy 12 miles per day.
With the current Heat Wave (95+ temp / 110+ heat index) and not being on a tight deadline I booked a nice air conditioned motel room just outside Duncannon for tonight and tomorrow night. 
The temperature is expected to drop back down to the mid-80's on Monday so I will get back on trail then.
For this last section I will be passing near and through a number of towns and campgrounds (convenience stores, supermarkets, resturants, diners, etc.) which means I won't need to carry much food weight.
Right now I am not planning any extended town stops before Harpers Ferry, but I will try to do one more update before I get there.
Best,

Harpers Ferry, WV
123.5 miles         Hiking on to Front Royal, VA    
I hiked into the beautiful historic village of Harpers Ferry after a very enjoyable seven and a half day hike from Duncannon.
The weather was mostly hot, but the PA rocks weren't as bad as farther north, there weren't as many difficult ups and downs, and I met a few very nice hikers along the way.
I tried to do just 10-12 miles a day for the first few days but the trail is so much easier now I couldn't hold back any longer. The past few days I did 18's to 20's per day. Yesterday I did 24 miles.
My plan was to arrive here in HF on August 1st so I guess I should have just jumped 50 miles and not a hundred miles from Bear Mountain, NY  (Oooops)
No Worries. Tomorrow morning I am getting back on trail for the 45 mile, three day hike on down to Front Royal, VA and end this trek there.
Recap of this past week.
From Duncannon I hiked past Carlisle, PA where I made a quick side trip .4 miles off trail to a diner for breakfast.
I hiked through Boiling Springs, PA where I got a shower at the community pool.
I hiked through Pine Grove Furnace where I got another shower at the lakeside comfort station, stopped at the Appalachian Trail Museum, and got lunch and a to go sandwich for dinner at the Pine Grove Furnace Store.
I hiked through Caledonia State Park and tented by a stream just past Old Forge Park.
I crossed into Maryland at Pen Mar State Park, hiked a few miles to the Smithsburg, MD trailhead where I got an Uber to take me to the local Dollar General to resupply my food bag. I bought a roast beef sandwich to go at the market next door and another Uber took me right back to the trail.
Yesterday I hiked past the Maryland Washington Monument, past Dalgren Campground and Gathland State Park and tented near a shelter about six miles from Harpers Ferry.
This morning I hiked into the village and got a great breakfast sandwich and coffee in the village.
I then stopped in to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy Headquarters here in town.
I hung out there with some other hikers for a while and had my photo taken in front of the building as every short and long distance hiker does when they pass through town.
The photos go into albums that the ATC puts together every year and keeps them in the Hiker Lounge for all to see. My photo from my 2008 thru-hike is in the Class of 2008 photo album there in the lounge.
 I am staying at the Quality Inn tonight to clean up and do laundry, then back on trail first thing in the morning.
I know this section very well, so it will be like hiking home.
I will post my final entry and photos when I get there.
Best,

Front Royal, VA
45 miles
     
Hanover, NH to Front Royal, VA Hike Completed       
I finished the fairly easy 45 miles from Harpers Ferry to the Rt 55 Linden/Front Royal trail head this morning feeling Great physically, and a little sad that this is  the end of my long distance hiking treks for this year.
As I said in an earlier post it's not the same as completing the Continental Divide Trail, but I am very happy with the 839 total CDT and AT miles I hiked over the past few months.
I hope to finish the CDT for my Triple Crown next year, but I am not going to make any final plans until late May or early June to see how much snow the San Juans of Colorado and Winds Mountains of Wyoming get.
If they get a much above average snow then I guess I will look at some other long trail such as the 1,175 mile Mountains to the Sea Trail in North Carolina.
In the meantime I plan to do a lot of short hiking and backpacking trips, plus many cycling and kayaking adventures.
