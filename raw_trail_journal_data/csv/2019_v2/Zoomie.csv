Basically drink lots of water, don't get too hot or too cold, don't fall and watch out for lightning. Still working on my mail drops for meds, coffee, freeze dried fruits, veggies & chicken (thank you Costco), powdered milk and coconut oil (rather than olive oil). Planning a mail drop every couple weeks. Strained my calf last weeks so the weekend off helped with that.

My feet are not barking at me after 12 miles! My mail drops are all set for my wife to send off about every two weeks (thank you sweetheart!). She will meet me about once a month and a couple hiking friends are going to do Katahdin with me and then help me flip-flop down to Springer to finish the southern portion.

All my gear is in place and I did a good shakedown hike a couple weekends ago with my scout troop as they we getting ready for Philmont this summer. It was 3days and 2 nights on part of the AT in Grayson Highlands St. Park, VA. Lousy weather-rainy, cold and frost. Good opportunity to check out my foul weather gear and it all worked. Pack was 36 pounds with food & 3 liters of water and I had no problem with that. On my thru hike I won't carry as much water nor some of the cold weather gear especially the insulated sleeping pad that weighs 17 oz. more than my new one. Still walking a lot , sometimes with my pack, spin classes, and workouts with trainer Kelly. My diet has me down 26 lbs with 4 to go. Only problem is my job getting in the way at times but last trip will be 4/25-27 to London with my family and looking forward to that.Have enjoyed reading many of the journals of the AT class of '16 and hope to see some of you on the trail.",,View Entry,"Mar 30, Wed",0

Hikers are Toast, Dill, Seeker & unknown. Larry & I saw them earlier in hike but they all took ""zero"" day in Harpers Ferry so I caught up with them.

Very time consuming but better than wet shoes & socks. At High Rocks @ 12:00 called for lodging & arranged with Burgundy Lane B&B. Best part-they picked me up at trailhead and will drop me off tomorrow after breakfast. Free laundry was nice too. Called niece Beverley to have dinner with her family.

Cool, cloudy weather and good trail helped me cover the 13.6 miles to the Toms Run Shelter by 2:15. It was a small shelter and too early to stop for the day besides it wasn't raining. So I did some stretches, checked on my feet, cleaned some water and hiked the additional 3.3 miles to the Ironmaster's Mansion Hostel in the Pine Grove Furnace St. Park. It was built in 1829 and makes a very interesting hostel. So after a shower, clean clothes and a pizza (all for $34) I feel pretty good about my decision to hike more. Haven't seen much wildlife: a few squirrels, some songbirds and one bob white quail. Tomorrow, I'll visit the AT Museum here before hiking on towards Boiling Spring on Friday.","Quarry Gap Shelters

Started 800' climb out of valley and filled water @ spring as water at shelter is unreliable. Added 8 extra lbs on last 500' of climb.

Ate early lunch at Cove Mountain Shelter then rocky, steep descent. Checked into the Doyle Hotel and picked up my mail drop. The place is a dump and reminds me of staff housing at Ravenknob. But I did not expect much for $25. Shower then lunch with a couple beers and then down the street to a laundromat. Forecast calls for a low of 36 tonight so good time to be in a room.

Also there had been a fire there and everything was covered with a fine layer of soot. The next spring was dry so onto the next resulting in a long day but I took a lot of breaks and feel good.

Zoomie,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623408,"It was 3 weeks ago today that OG Bob & I summited Katahdin to complete our section hike of the AT.  Debi & I took 3 days to drive home to NC and then celebrated with family & friends over the weekend.  They all wanted to meet Bob and figure out how he could put up with me for so long.  It was great fun and I was able to thank them for their help & support over these past 4 years.  
I planned on being a thru hiker but my arthritic knees did not cooperate.  As it turned out, I enjoyed the section hiking more as we had so much more flexibility and could take our time to visit and see the sights.  By having our 2 cars and driving to all the different trailheads, we saw much more than we would have just hiking.
We talked about our most memorable moments and it usually involved meeting other people, good hostels and food.  Debi said that we should write a guidebook of craft breweries along the AT as we did our best to try them all.
The hiking community is special and that really made the trip.  The hostel folks, trail angels and other hikers were all so helpful and kind.  Everyone was looking out for each other.
Now, I am recuperating from a strain or partial tear of my left IT band and getting ready for a bike trip in GA&AL this fall and rafting the Grand Canyon next May with OG Bob & some other friends.  I might try the Mountain to Sea Trail here in NC after my legs fully recover.
