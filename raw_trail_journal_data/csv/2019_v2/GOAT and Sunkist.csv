GOAT and Sunkist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606160,"We took our first mini-shakedown hike today. We hiked about 3 miles in the rain. It was in the low 40s as well. All in all we made it through unscathed. I had my base layer, Patagonia hoodie, and Precip jacket on. I stayed dry and comfortable. I feel good about our choices. I think at least this gear is dialed in. Next we have an overnighter planned for an upcoming weekend at Wolf Gap in WV.

We leave on 2/20, arrive at the Bearfoot Hills Hostel, and start our hike on the 21st. We’ve been testing out and dialing in our gear. We still need to do our shakedown hike, hopefully we can get that in in the next couple of weeks. I packed everything up yesterday and had a preliminary base weight of 20 pounds. I’d like to shave a couple of pounds from that. I haven’t finished with MJ’s pack so we do have some wiggle room to redistribute our loads.

GOAT and Sunkist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606887,"Well … 2 weeks until we board the flight to Atlanta to begin our adventure and I’ve been doing a little reflecting. It was 7 years ago that I was diagnosed with cancer which forever changed my life in so many ways. It also led me to my dream of hiking the Appalachian Trail. During my recovery I began hiking and getting reacquainted with my love of the outdoors. It was great therapy. Both mentally and physically. Shortly after that I met and fell in love with my soulmate who was more than willing to accompany me on my journey. Fast forward a few years and here we are 2 weeks away from starting our adventure. It is so incredibly surreal. I’m excited, nervous, anxious, impatient, but most of all I can’t wait. Onward to Georgia",,View Entry,"Feb 06, Wed",0
GOAT and Sunkist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607123,It’s getting real. 3 days and we’ll be on the trail. We’ve already had to adjust our schedule. We are scheduled to fly out of Dulles on the 20th. Originally we had a ride to the airport in the morning but there is supposed to be a snow/sleet/ice storm Tuesday night into Wednesday so we’ve decided to get a ride tomorrow afternoon and get a hotel room by the airport. In the meantime we’ll be packing and unpacking a 100 times until everything becomes second nature. I want to limit the on trail surprises as much as possible.,,View Entry,"Feb 18, Mon",0
GOAT and Sunkist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607227,"We finally made it to Georgia. This morning we woke up to a snow storm. We were flying out of Dulles in DC which had cancelled over 100 flights. Luckily our flight was one of the fortunate ones that took off close to on time. It was interesting taking off in a blizzard. We then took a train to North Springs where our shuttle driver, Ron Brown, picked us up and took us to the Barefoot Hills Hostel. We’re staying in a converted shipping container (attached photo). Tomorrow at 8am we are being shuttled to Amicalola Falls State Park where we begin our journey. Can’t wait.",,View Entry,"Feb 20, Wed",0
GOAT and Sunkist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607269,"Well it’s been one helluva start. Day one started off well enough. It was raining but not heavy and it eventually stopped. The stairs going up the waterfall at Amicalola were tough. They are the equivalent of climbing a 40 story building. The rest of the trail was hard as well. Then the downpour started. We ended up stopping two miles before Springer Mt at a shelter on the Approach Trail. We set up the tent and it poured all night long, with some thunder. We stayed dry in the tent but everything I had in the vestibule was drenched. Started off this morning in another downpour with wet shoes, socks, pants, and just about everything we had. As we climbed the mountain the rain got heavier and it got colder. By the time we reached the summit (the official start of the AT) we were both completely soak and I was starting to shiver. We walked a little more then ended up stopping at Springer shelter to warm up and have lunch. I had a hard time getting warm so we’ve decided to call it a day and stay in the shelter tonight. As someone said last night “the miles will come. Don’t push it”. I’m cold, wet, miserable, but still looking forward to many more miles.","Amicalola Falls State Park

GOAT and Sunkist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607400,"I haven’t posted in a few days due to lack of cell service. We ended up taking a zero day at the Springer shelter due to more rain and cold. Everything we had was soaked. The next morning the sun finally came out so I hung everything up for an hour or two. Then got back on trail ... late but moving forward. We hiked 7 miles and spent the night at Hawk Mountain campsite. A nice place even if we did see a pile of bear scat in the site next to ours. Woke up to sun, but high winds and in the 30s. Still better than rain. The day became beautiful, sunny and in the 50s. The big climb was up Sassafras Mt. Hard but doable. We made it to Gooch Gap shelter which had some really nicely laid out campsites. We picked one and set up camp. There were probably 10 other tents there but we were spread out so it was fine. Another 8 miles in the books. It’s good to get some miles in. This morning we woke up and after 6 days on the trail couldn’t stand the smell so we got a shuttle to Barefoot Hills Hostel. Our trail friend, So Far So Good (Katherine), came with us so we rented a 2 bedroom cabin for the night. Ahhhhh... a shower and nice bed. And a FLUSH TOILET! Beats sitting on a bowl out in the woods in 30 degree weather. Tomorrow we’ve got a shuttle to take us back to Woody Gap to continue our journey. The last 3 days have been great. I’m beginning to get my cardio in shape so I can hike up mountains without too many stops. My legs feel good except my calves are a little sore. No big deal though. We’ve had a great time so far. Even in our wettest, coldest time it never entered our mind to quit. The people we have met have been incredibly nice and supporting. It truly is a family out here. Everyone watching out for each other. Tomorrow it’s off to Low Gap, then Neel Gap. Both short days but there are restrictions where you can camp in that area because of bear problems. We’ll stop and camp before that, then hike our way through to Neel Gap. We’re both doing well and looking forward to many more miles.

GOAT and Sunkist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607437,"Another great day on the trail. MJ and I got our trail legs, at least some of them. We hiked our first double digit day ... 11 miles. That included up Blood Mountain and down, which may have been more challenging than up. We arrived at Neel Gap just before sunset. We had reservations for a cabin at Blood Mountain Cabins, which we’re sharing with our friend Katherine (So Far So Good). Since we walked in we got the hiker rate ... $70. Well worth it considering it’s supposed to rain tonight. As we got our keys, John (Achin’ Aiken) was standing on the porch and said one of the cabins had burgers, if we wanted. WE DID! Knocked on the door and were greeted by Sonya, Big Toe, and Colton. All people we’ve met earlier but never thought we see again. The camaraderie, bond, and friendships we have established are amazing. You meet someone and 10 minutes later feel like you’ve known them your whole life. I haven’t met anyone out here that I haven’t liked. Tomorrow’s plan is a 7 mile day to Whitley Gap shelter. We’re hoping for Hiawasee in 3 days. We’re loving it out here and are so proud of ourselves. We are far exceeding our expectations but still keeping the miles short for another couple of weeks. No reason to push it. We’re in no hurry.","Woody Gap

GOAT and Sunkist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607477,"Another beautiful day in the bush. We woke up to rain but at least it wasn’t heavy. Off to Mountain Crossings for supplies. I decided to trade out my sleeping bag. The one I have will probably not be warm enough for the Smokies so I wanted to upgrade. Plus I had a mail drop waiting there for me. My Uncle Willie and Just Bill set me up. Then it was off to the trail, which runs right through the building. The climb out was tough. 1000 feet in a little under 2 miles. A hard way to start the day. Plus it was starting to rain harder. We got to the top and the fog was very thick. It was spooky but I love hiking in it. It wasn’t long before we started feeling the strains of the last week. Our bodies were beginning to rebel. Everything hurt and we were soaked. We decided it was time for a zero day. We hiked another 5 miles, got a shuttle ride to Hiawasee and are now holed up in a Holiday Inn. We’re going to take tomorrow off and just rest. Our bodies need it. Our shuttle driver, Jeff, was a character. He was great. I know more about the history of Union County, Georgia than I ever suspected I would. Look him up on Facebook at Jeff’s Appalachian Trail Shuttle and Tours. Tell him Kevin sent you. Tomorrow I’m looking forward to rest, a meal that isn’t made with boiling water, and a dram of scotch.  The trail has been very difficult. We knew it would be but you still don’t know how hard until you’re actually on it. It is definitely the hardest thing I have ever done in my life. I am so proud of both of us. At no time since we’ve been out here have we ever thought of quitting. No matter how tough it is, we are loving it.","Neel Gap

GOAT and Sunkist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607521,"We got picked up by our shuttle driver, Jeff, at 8am and we were on the trail by 8:45. We were pushing to do our highest mileage yet. We wanted to get to Blue Mt Shelter which would be a 12 mile day. The first 9 miles went great! Not a lot of significant ups and downs but most of it was walking on the edge of the mountain. Not a lot of room for errors. As a matter of fact, MJ lost her bottle of water off the cliff while she was trying to get it out of her pack. Luckily we had an extra bottle. We breezed through with little problem until we hit mile 10. It became very rocky which slowed us down. The last mile was straight uphill which is the last thing either one of us wanted to see after 11 miles. We finally made it to the shelter around 4. Tired, sore, but in high spirits. We had plenty of time to setup, relax, and eat dinner. Tomorrow we are meeting back up with our friend So Far So Good. She has the keys to a friends cabin located about a mile from the trail. It’ll be a short day, 6 or 7 miles. We hope to get an early start so we can beat the rain in the afternoon. Today was a good day. Felt good getting back out here after our much needed zero in Hiawasee. Other than the usual aches and pains we’re holding up well. It’s time to turn in now, it’s hiker midnight ... 7pm.  Back at it in the morning.","Hogpen Gap

GOAT and Sunkist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607544,"Another good day but then any day out here is a good one. We got up and out early (for us). Hit the trail by 8:30. We wanted to beat the afternoon rain and thunderstorms. Down into Unicoi Gap, up and over Rocky Mt. We were meeting So Far So Good at Tray Mountain Rd. She had access to a mountain cabin and invited us to spend the night. It was about 2 miles off trail and just as we got to the road the skies opened up. We are so far back in the woods I’m expecting to hear dueling banjos. It was well worth the extra 2 miles to stay out of the storms. Then it’s back at it tomorrow morning. 
I recently posted the following on Facebook but I thought I would include it here too. Sorry it’s a little long ... Our journey is going really well. We’re both having a lot of fun and meeting a lot of great people. I wanted to write a little bit about trail magic. Usually when you hear that, you think of free food or maybe an unsolicited ride into town. But trail magic comes in many forms. Our first few days on the trail were pretty miserable. Cold, wet, tired. We zeroed in Springer Mountain Shelter, the first shelter on the AT, because of conditions. After 3 days we had gone a total of .2 miles on the AT. We were sitting in our sleeping bags in the back of the shelter feeling cold and defeated. Miserable. A hiker came in and said he was reliving some memories from his thru-hike the previous year. We talked for a minute and as he left the shelter he turned around pointed at us and said, “you are all superstars” and left. Those 4 words did more for my morale and spirit than any free cheeseburger or ride into town could ever do. I think about that moment often and it always lifts my spirits and makes me smile. So thank you, Scab (Travis McDaniel)  your words of encouragement meant more to us than you ever dreamed.","Blue Mountain Shelter

GOAT and Sunkist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607620,"Yesterday was our first day hiking in sun-freezing temps. It wasn’t bad though. It was also one of our longest days. There were a lot of ups and downs including Kelly Knob in the last couple of miles. You don’t hear a lot about it but it was a killer. 1000 feet in a mile. Especially after already hiking 8 miles. The real star of the day was the hoar frost. Hoar frost is when the condensation in the air freezes on the trees and grasses. It’s like everything in the woods is frosted. I attached a photo but it really doesn’t do it justice. It was amazingly beautiful. Of course it was also cold but as long as we kept moving we were fine. We got to Deep Gap shelter and set up shop inside. Two young kids we had met a couple of days ago joined us late. Tim and Britney from Florida. Last night was cooooold ... it got down to 16, which none of us were prepared for. I didn’t freeze but kept waking up chilled. Sunkist (MJ’s new trail name because of her sunny disposition and her orange pack cover) was very cold. We tried starting a fire but everything was too wet. No more sub-30 temps at night unless we’re prepared. Tonight’s another 15 degree night so we did a short hike this morning then got a shuttle into Hiawasee and we’re at the Holiday Inn again. We have 3 of us in a room so it’s cheap. Tomorrow we’re going to zero at the Top of Georgia Hostel and spend the night. It’s a great place and well known on the trail. We stopped in today on our way to Hiawasee and everyone was very nice. Thursday the temps are going to rebound a bit so we’re back at it starting at Dick’s Creek Gap. North Carolina is only 9 miles away. A big milestone. We’ll probably cross over Friday morning.","Tray Mountain Rd

Walked around town (because we haven’t walked enough lately), picked up some things, and got shuttled to Top of Georgia Hostel. Staying the night. We met “The Family” at the Hostel. Mom, Dad, and 4 daughters. They’re thru hiking as well. They’re also doing twice the miles as we are. Oh well, hike your own hike. 
I’m not really a hostel kind of guy but this place is ok.  Very friendly people. One guy, Tom Kennedy, helps run an organization that supports mental health thru hiking, Hike for Mental Health. A very worthy cause. Look for it on Facebook.

Big milestone Thursday ... we crossed over from Georgia to North Carolina. One state in the books.  We also did our biggest day ... 12.6 miles. The weather was perfect.  Sunny and around 50. The first 10 or so miles were not bad at all. Typical ups and downs but nothing too drastic. We were very excited to be in North Carolina then we started climbing and climbing and climbing. Straight up. It was one of the hardest climbs (in our opinion) to date. North Carolina sure welcomed us. We’re renting at Muskrat Creek shelter tonight.  There are 6 or 7 in the shelter and a half dozen tents here. It was an unusually crowded day on the trail today. We seem to be in a miniature bubble. We passed and were passed by probably 10 different people. Most we’ve run into before. Plus “The Family” was out there too. It’s Mom and Dad and 4 daughters. The youngest 5 and the oldest around 12. It’s supposed to start raining tomorrow morning and rain for the next 3 days. Tomorrow is supposed to be in the 40s so we may do a short 5 mile day to the next shelter.  Saturday and Sunday are supposed to be warmer. We’ll see what we do for those days. I kind of like just planning one day at a time. Just getting through the next day or two is almost all we think about. Other than our next meal. We start thinking about dinner before we finish lunch.

Friday we slept in. It rained off and on all night. Broke camp and headed out around 10. We hiked 5 miles in a cold rain. Got to Standing Indian Shelter around 1 and decided to stay. Too cold, too wet. It was a good idea to stop. We got there before the crowd. We were able to jam 7 of us in like sardines. There are also 7 or 8 tents setup. I don’t envy those who had to set them up in the rain.         Tomorrow is supposed to rain but hopefully 10 degrees warmer. My fingers are crossed.

Saturday was a good day. It never really rained hard, mostly misty and foggy.  We powered through and did our biggest day. 15.5 miles and that included a hand over hand rock scramble up Albert Mountain. We also had another milestone ... 100 miles completed so far. For the second night in a row we are in a shelter, Long Branch shelter.  It’s new and roomy. Plenty of room to stretch out.

As I laid awake all I could think of was what kind of food I wanted to eat when I got to town. It was another good group of people. We saw Waffle and his 13 year old son Hawkeye. We hadn’t seen them since Blood Mountain. Also saw Rick from Hamburg PA and Clair who we hadn’t seen since Blue Mountain Shelter. We only had a 4 mile hike to Rock Gap where we were going to call for a ride into Franklin. As we got near the parking lot a guy coming up the trail asked if we needed a ride into town. When I asked how much he said no charge. Turns out he is the owner of Baltimore Jack Hostel. Ron Haven. A great guy. Even though we weren’t staying at his place he still gave us a ride. That’s typical of the people we’ve been meeting. So we’re in Franklin for the next 2 days. Today was sunny and 72 degrees. Would have been a great hiking day but our bodies needed a break.

It wasn’t just anyone it was the Crawfords. They were the family of 8 that thru hiked last year. We followed their journey on YouTube. They were so nice and accommodating. It was a pleasure spending time with them chatting. Also there was Fresh Ground. He has been doing trail magic for years and is somewhat of a legend himself. 
We finally bid farewell and got back on the trail. It was a beautiful sunny day, temps in the 50s. We hiked 9 miles to Siler Bald. It’s a beautiful grass meadow at the top of the mountain. There are 360 degree views of the mountains. We decided to camp there instead of going to the shelter. We are the only ones here. Our first stealth camp during our hike.

That was in the middle of the night during a nature call. Luckily it wasn’t raining or windy. I’m trying to get a replacement at the NOC tomorrow. Then about 4 miles into our 11 mile day I had my first fall. Not sure what happened but I ended up on all fours in a small stream. I knew I had hurt my ankle but wasn’t sure how bad. I sat on a log for a few minutes then tried walking on it. No dice. I couldn’t put any weight on it. It was very tender and sore. I sat for another 15 minutes or so then tried again. I was able to limp around until I felt like I could continue. I really had no choice. It was almost 7 miles to the shelter and we were far enough from civilization that I had to try. I took 4 ibuprofens and started up the trail. We went very slow and I watched every step carefully. It seemed to loosen up as the miles went by but it still hurt. By the time I got to the shelter it felt pretty good. It still hurts but at least it feels stable. It’s swollen but not real bad. I think I’ll be ok. MJ gave me one of her compression socks to put on. I’m hoping it’s not too sore tomorrow. We’re doing another 11 mile day to the NOC to meet our friend So Far So Good. 
There was one part of the day that was good. The sunrise where we stayed on Siler Bald was spectacular. Very colorful. 
Once I got to the shelter in my bag I started feeling very fortunate. Fortunate that I should be able to continue my journey. It could have very well ended in that small stream.

There were 4 of us in the shelter last night so there was plenty of room. I didn’t sleep particularly well but then I never really do. But since we go to bed at 7:00 we’re getting enough sleep all in all. My ankle was stiff but after a couple of miles and a handful of ibuprofen it felt pretty good. I still kept it slow and very careful. It was raining when we left the shelter but stopped soon enough and turned out to be a pretty nice day. The sun even made a brief appearance. We hiked 11 miles into Nantahala Outdoor Center. We met our friend So Far So Good and got a room for 3. Good thing, my ankle is quite swollen and needs ice. Fortunately it doesn’t hurt all that much.

It was fun watching them practice. We decided to do our first slack-packing. We shipped our gear, minus a few essentials, to a hostel 14 miles up the trail and started hiking. It was nice only carrying 10 pounds instead of 30. The only problem was we couldn’t leave until noon and had to make the hostel before dark. The climb out of the NOC was 6 miles uphill. It was pretty grueling. Turned out we walked out of the woods just as the sun set. Perfect timing. The hostel owner picked us up and took us to a Mexican restaurant in Robbinsville then back to his place, A Cabin in the Woods. The 3 of us got a little cabin which was great. Craig and Eileen were wonderful hosts. I highly recommended the place. The next day Craig drove us back to the trailhead. The climb out of Stecoah Gap was hard. One of the top 5 hardest IMO. We only hiked 7 miles and got picked up by So Far So Good’s husband and driven to their home in Asheville. We’re going to stay there a few days to escape some of the frigid temps in the Smokies. Plus my ankle needs some healing. It doesn’t hurt much but is pretty swollen. I’ve also ordered something to fix the zipper on my tent fly which split the other night. I bought it right before we left. I am VERY disappointed in the customer service at Big Agnes. They basically told me my options were buy a new fly or fix it myself. It’s the worst service of any outdoor company I’ve ever dealt with. Live and learn. And the last thing is I finally got my trail name ... Goat.

We woke up in this morning to an inch of snow on top of the sleet. We got back on the trail which is the best way to warm up in the morning. Today was sunny, in the 40s, but very windy at times. The Smokies are no joke. Yesterday we climbed over 3700 feet. Today we climbed to 5400 feet. A lot of hard ups and downs. My legs were dead when we reached the shelter which was thankfully full. Woohoo! So we set up the tent. It’s supposed to get down into the teens tonight but we’ll be fine. We have another 12 mile day tomorrow just like first two. We’re thinking of zeroing in Gatlinburg on Monday because there is supposed to be a big storm then. Ice and snow in the mountains. We’ll keep an eye on the weather and see. 
In the morning we packed up and headed out. We always seem to be one of the last out of camp in the morning. Maybe because we enjoy a cup of coffee with our breakfast. Most just pack up and head out. We’re enjoying ourselves out here. The only drawback is we are usually the last ones in camp right before sunset. That’s fine, it’ll be better when the days are longer. We hiked most of the day on a snow covered trail. It was nice because it was packed down. It was also sunny and in the 50s. It was another hard uphill most of the day. The payoff was Clingmans Dome. The highest point on the AT. And another milestone ... we crossed the 200 mile mark. There is a tower we climbed that had a tremendous 360 view. Another 5 miles and we made it to Mt. Collins Shelter. There were only 7 of us so it was nice. It was the same crew we’ve been hiking with through the Smokies ... Ginger Goat, Pony Keg, and Moonie. All great people. The next morning we hiked to New Found Gap where we planned to go into Gatlinburg. We had met some local hikers the day before that said they’d be happy to come and pick us up, no charge. When we got to the parking lot they were there waiting for us as well as about 200 other people just sightseeing. Honestly, after not seeing many people the last month, it was a little unnerving. Also waiting for us was a group of former hikers (led by Mentor) handing out trail magic. Beer, cokes, fresh fruits, donuts, etc. They all made us feel so special. It’s hard to describe how we feel after spending days in the dirt and rain and snow and there are strangers waiting to make your day better for no other reason than they care. It’s humbling. We got our ride in Gatlinburg, which is the most crowded, touristy, place I’ve ever been. It makes the Jersey Shore boardwalk look like a quiet retreat. But our room is comfortable and our bodies definitely needed a break. Tomorrow is laundry, a few drinks with our friend, Ice Ager, and a day at rest. Back at it on Tuesday.","Derrick Knob Shelter

GOAT and Sunkist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609072,"We were back on the trail by 9am Tuesday. It was not a particularly nice day. Misty and cold all day. For most of the day the trail was a little river. There was no way to stay dry so by the time we reached Pecks Corner Shelter my feet were wet and cold. The shelter was almost full with a mixture of new folks and people we’ve been hiking with thru the Smokies. I never sleep well in the shelters and this night was no different. 
We were up and out by 9. Usually the last ones to leave. The day was better. No rain but not a lot of sun and quite cool. We hiked on a lot of ice as all the water from yesterday had frozen. We got to Crosby Knob Shelter around 4 and even though the shelter wasn’t full we set up our tent anyways. We found a nice level spot next to a stream behind some rhododendrons. 
Morning came early. We were up by 7 but were still the last ones out at 8:30. It was an awesome day. Sunny and in the 60s. Plus we were hiking out of the Smokies. We had about a 6 mile downhill to start. It was really hard on the knees but the beautiful weather and views made up for it. We exited the Smokies and waiting for us was a man with some trail magic. Chips, candy, cokes, Gatorade, etc. it was nice. Then it was off to Standing Bear Hostel. We had heard a lot about it. The most popular hostel on the trail. All I can say about it is it’s not my cup of tea. Its party central. A lot of 20 somethings drinking beer and smoking weed. We set up our tent instead of staying in the bunkhouse.

A day being easier has as much to do with how our bodies feel than the terrain. Today we felt strong out of the gate so the day seemed easier. So much so we did our longest day ... 16.6 miles. Other than a few aching feet we feel pretty good. Tomorrow we’re hiking into Hot Springs NC, which is right on the trail, and then we’ll take a zero on Monday. There are natural mineral hot springs that you can soak in. We might try one. Besides I need a shower desperately and a cheeseburger. Tonight will be our 6th day in a row in our tent, another record.

We wake up, usually at 7. I get dressed first. I have dedicated sleeping clothes that I do not wear for hiking. My hiking clothes are in the bottom of my sleeping bag staying relatively warm. Unfortunately they usually stink but then I usually do too so not a big deal. It’s still a shock when I have to put my shirt on in the morning. Cold but it wakes me up. As I’m getting out of the tent MJ is getting up. The first thing I do is get the bear bags down from wherever I hung them. I’ve gotten pretty good at hanging it but believe it or not, it’s been very hard finding a good tree. After getting our food bags, I fire up the stove for coffee. Meanwhile MJ is packing up everything in the tent. We drink our coffee and eat breakfast while we’re breaking down camp. We’ve gotten it down to about an hour before we’re packed up and ready to hit the trail. I think we can do it a little faster once the weather warms up. It won’t be so hard getting out of a warm sleeping bag. Usually the first mile is one of the best of the day especially if it’s a sunny day.

We did have some drama while climbing Little Hump. It started raining halfway up then when we reached the top it turned into a severe thunderstorm. We had no choice but to keep hiking. It was pretty hairy with the thunder and lightning but we made it. By the time we hit the next peak the sun was out. The trail was treacherous for the rest of the day. Very muddy and slick. I slipped just about every other step. It was very tiring. Another reason to get new shoes when we get to Damascus.

GOAT and Sunkist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611032,"During our zero day in Damascus I have a few random thoughts from the trail. 
My least favorite trail chore is filtering water. It takes too much time and always seems to interrupt us when we’re in a good hiking groove. That’s why we try to lunch at a place with available water. Not enough thanks is given to the volunteers that maintain the trail. One thing that has surprised me about the trail is how many downed trees there are out there. Yet there are very few that have not been cut up to allow hikers to get through. Some of these trees are miles from any road which means these volunteers have to lug heavy chainsaws up into the woods to do their work. So THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU DO. I’ve been surprised at how many thru hikers are from other countries. I don’t know the exact percentage but to say 1/4 of the hikers are from foreign lands would not be too much of an exaggeration. I have a lot of respect for them. For most, it’s there first trip to the US. After 8 weeks on the trail there have been maybe 2 or 3 people that we’ve met that haven’t been friendly.  That’s pretty amazing considering how many hikers we’ve met. Everyone is friendly, inviting, and helpful. All you have to do is meet someone once and the next time you see them it seems like you’re seeing a long lost friend. We are so glad we started off doing under 10 miles a day and have slowly increased our mileage. We are doing in the range of 13 to 16 miles a day and it’s really no big deal. Our bodies are noticeably stronger. Climbs that killed us a month ago are not a problem now. I am so thankful to be hiking with MJ. Besides loving her dearly she is also my best friend. We have become quite a team out here. We both lean on each other for support and encouragement. We are co-existing without any major disagreements. One of the things I worried the most about before beginning was pooping in the woods. Georgia and most of NC were fine because there were privies at every shelter. Even though the privies were basically a toilet seat in the middle of the woods with walls that barely came up enough to cover the pooper. The last 100 miles there have been no privies so it’s pick a spot in the woods and go. With practice it’s not so bad, except when it’s raining. I basically have only 2 rules for my thru hike. And I’m not naive enough to think they may not change as we move north but as of now they are: 1) touch every foot of the AT. So when we go off trail for anything; water, shelter, town visit, we get back on the trail at the exact point we exited. And of course no skipping sections. 2) always hike northbound. Some people slack pack by getting shuttled to a point north then they hike south back to the original point. I don’t mind slack packing but I always want to hike north. Both of these are my personal rules. It doesn’t make me right or better than others, it’s just for me. Hike your own hike. I’m not sure why but all of my day to day ailments I have in normal life, heartburn, tendinitis in both shoulders, sour stomach, diarrhea, etc, virtually have disappeared on the trail. It can’t be my diet, since that consist almost entirely of fat and sugar. Must be the 10 straight hours of physical activity each day.","

Monday was more of the usual ... long uphill to start then multiple ups and downs the rest of the day. Tuesday was a big day. We reached 500 miles in the morning then hiked right up to Grayson Highlands. We camped in an area that was closed last year due to aggressive bear activity. In the middle of the night we had a visitor. Something walked right next to our tent and tripped over one of the guywires of the tent. I made some noise and it ran off. Then in the morning I talked with some friends who had a bear steal there food bag out of the tree they hung it in. They were camping right down the trail from us. Wednesday was another big day. We hiked among the ponies in Grayson Highlands State Park. They’re wild ponies that were put on the mountain top to eat the negative vegetation. They are all over the mountain and pay no attention to people. It’s cool hiking in and around them. That night we stayed at the last shelter in the bear warning area. There was a bear box (big metal box to store food bags in) so we felt safe. Once again in the middle of the night a bear showed up trying to get into the box. He made quite a racket trying to get into the box. He was at it for about 15 minutes then finally left. 30 minutes later he was back and for the next half hour was banging and scratching the box trying to get in. We were only 50 feet away so we were thankful he was preoccupied with the box and not us. Actually we weren’t worried. Bears are after food not humans. We had nothing in our tent that would interest him unless he liked smelly hikers. Eventually one of the other tenters had had enough and yelled at him and he ran off. I think two nights in a row of bear activity is enough for awhile. 


So today we hiked 10 miles then hitchhiked into Marion, VA. Besides needing a resupply I want to consult with a doctor about the pain in my heels. I’m fine in the morning and for the first 5 or so miles, then they get sore. Not debilitating, just very annoying. I’ve tried everything I can think of, insoles, heel pads, new shoes, stretching, even foot massages from MJ. There’s a hospital/urgent care across the street from our hotel that I’m going to go to tomorrow. Hopefully they have some answers.","Damascus, VA

GOAT and Sunkist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611578,"I posted this to my Facebook page ... I have a couple of updates after my post from yesterday. I went to the local emergency room today to see what was giving me my heel pain. Turns out it is Achilles Tendonitis. Basically an over-use injury. The doctor said it could go away on its own or I may just have to live with it. She said steroids may help so she gave me a shot and a week’s worth of pills to step down the dosage. She suggested that I zero another day to let the steroids kick in. Plus it’d be better to be in town in case I had a reaction. I am cautiously optimistic that the roids will work. So we’re going to stay another day and hit the trail on Sunday. 


Update number two is I found a local barber and got my haircut. It was the longest haircut I’ve ever had. The guy was very meticulous and thorough. Took over an hour, which is an awful lot considering I don’t have that much hair to begin with. Then he asked if I wanted my beard trimmed. After thinking for a second I blurted out, “cut it all off”. He must of asked me 10 times if I was sure. I was, so off it came. I’m now beardless and loving it. I saw some other hikers we know and they didn’t recognize me. I told them this is how I look in the real world. I know it’s just going to grow back but for now I feel normal again. 


So last night I posted some of the things I miss about home. Now, after being in town for a day, there are a few things I’m missing about the trail. I miss that first hour hike on the trail in the morning. It’s crisp and quiet. We walk in silence hiking in the solitude. It is meditative. I miss the end of the day. Getting into the tent at sunset. Laying there writing about the day while it’s still fresh in my mind. Listening to the forest as it goes to sleep. Birds singing, rustling in the leaves, the wind. It is so peaceful. I miss hiking up a steep hill only to reach the summit and see a spectacular 360 degree view. I miss seeing a hiker friend I haven’t seen in weeks that I thought I’d never see again. Hmm ... I miss an awful lot from the trail. Can’t wait til Sunday.","

GOAT and Sunkist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611776,Today was pretty uneventful. I started the day still in a little bit of a funk but as the day went on my mental game improved. It’s like that the morning after a zero day. We hiked 10.5 miles but had to cut it short because my heel pain returned pretty bad. I think it was bad because I’ve stopped taking ibuprofen. I’ve been taking 4 to 16 everyday for the last month. The doctor and I both agreed I have to stop. I still have 4 more days of the steroids so I’ll see if that works. Although to be honest I’m not too optimistic. The doctor said the best thing to do is take a few weeks rest but I’m not ready to do that yet. I’m going to try to take it easy. More breaks and less total miles. The coolest part of the day was hiking through an active cow pasture. The cows were very chill and didn’t seem to mind us walking through their space. Then we met a hiker who warned us that there was going to be a controlled burn about 7 miles up the trail tomorrow. It may stop us from going forward. We’re not going to worry about it. If we’re stopped then we’re stopped. It’ll only hold us up for a day. We found a nice little campsite at the top of a hill for the night. Had dinner and hung our food bags. I’m hoping we don’t have any visitors tonight.,"Marion, VA

GOAT and Sunkist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611922,"Cell service two nights in a row! Amazing!  Today was a good day. Both of us woke up refreshed and ready to go. We hiked 7 miles and ran into a US Forest Ranger who told us they were doing a controlled burn on the mountain and part of the AT was closing. He said if we hurried and didn’t stop for the next 3 miles we could go on, so we did. A couple miles down trail we came upon a one room schoolhouse. Inside a local church had left hiker supplies in boxes in the back. Food, fruit, soda, medical supplies, toiletries, there was everything. How nice of them. We got a few things and headed out. Then we got word that there was a restaurant right on the trail with burgers! So we hightailed it 5 miles to get there by dinner. Unfortunately when we got there it was closed. Closed on Mondays! Agghhh! So we went across the street to the gas station and bought a quart of ice cream and ate it outside. Another mile and a half and we’re in camp now next to a cow pasture. The cows have been quite vocal since we got here. Hope they quiet down before dark.  


Oh and one side note. I had said in an earlier post that my least favorite trail chore was filtering water ... not anymore. Hanging my bear bag is. It’s nearly impossible to find a tree to hang from. All the trees are like telephone poles, straight with no branches. It’s one of the first things I do when I get to camp, I search for a suitable tree. It takes forever and it’s usually 100 yards from our tent. I hate it!


And thanks Little Monster for following along. Hope to see you on the trail someday.","Stealth Campsite

GOAT and Sunkist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612111,"We passed a pretty significant milestone on Tuesday, we are now a quarter of the way done with the trail. We’re at the 555 mile mark. We can now look at a map of the AT and see that we’ve actually made some progress. It’s pretty exciting to pass milestones like this. It keeps us energized. We kept it a short day. Early on in the hike MJ took a fall. She tripped over a root and went face first into another root. She is now sporting a grade A shiner that any boxer would be proud of. We decided to only do 8.5 miles and stay at a local hostel, The Quarter Way Inn. It’s a beautiful spot in the farmlands of Virginia.  We’re not zeroing, we’ll be leaving early tomorrow morning. We’ve met a lot of hikers we’ve never met before. We seem to get into these different “bubbles” of hikers after we take a zero. Our old group gets ahead and we pick up with the ones behind us. It’s interesting, everyone is very friendly when you meet and you can feel a kinship right away. A lot of the hikers we’re meeting now are younger and started way after us. Some as late as early April. They’ve been on the trail a month, we’ve been on the trail over 2 months. But everyone is pulling for us and very encouraging. I think they’re impressed that we’re doing it at our age and that we’ve made it this far. 


Wednesday was a difficult day. Besides being very hot and humid. The trail was hard and steep. It was one of those days where mentally I was just not into it. It was no fun. We got to the top of a 5 mile climb at the end of the day and were greeted by a fantastic view. We’ve setup our tent looking out over a valley and should be treated to an amazing sunrise. If the rain holds off.","Stealth Campsite near Atkins VA

GOAT and Sunkist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612284,"We had a nice restful sleep Wednesday night and woke up to a nice sunrise on top of Chestnut Knob. We did our normal morning rituals. I sit in the tent and boil water for coffee in the vestibule while MJ gets ready for the day. It’s one of my favorite times. We drink our coffee, eat breakfast, break camp, and hit the trail. We’re getting better at getting out earlier. We’ve been leaving by 8:15 - 8:30. Thursday morning was a lot of ridge walking, with a lot of rocks. The afternoon we had a very steep mile and a half climb. As we got to the top the heavens opened up and it started to rain. A downpour. I had just enough time to put my pack cover on. It was too late to get our rain jackets out so we just continued walking and got soaked. To the bone. It was in the 70s so it wasn’t too bad. It poured for about 20 minutes then the sun came out. Luckily everything in our packs stayed dry. We got to the bottom of the mountain and setup camp by the Laurel Creek. We’re glad we didn’t have to setup the tent in the rain. Some other hikers arrived and it seems we were the only ones who got rained on. Friday we got up and out by 8. Even though it didn’t rain at night everything was wet. It was a very clammy night. We hiked 7 miles to The Brushy Mountain Cafe (right on the trail) in record time. It’s amazing how much a burger can motivate us. On the way we saw our first snake. It was a 4 or 5 foot black snake. He was curled up next to the trail.  At the cafe, I had a Brushy Mountain Burger which consists of a 1/2 pound cheeseburger with everything on it and a one inch slab of bologna on top. It was excessive but I ate the whole thing. Afterwards we got picked up by a shuttle and taken into Bland, VA. We’re going to resupply, spend the night in town, then back on the trail Saturday morning. We think. There are supposed to be severe thunderstorms tomorrow so we’ll see.","Chestnut Knob

GOAT and Sunkist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612416,"We stayed at Big Walker Motel in Bland, VA last night. A clean, little, family owned place. It was nice and cheap. We had Bubba the shuttle driver take us back to the trailhead at 6:30am. We wanted to start early to try and beat the rain. We did some power hiking this morning. We did 11.5 miles by noon and then another 5 before we set up camp. At the ninth mile we went over the 600 mile mark for the trip. The rain was supposed to start around 4 or 5 and we wanted to be done setting up before then. Success! We had the tent up, ate dinner (Mountain House Beef Stroganoff) and hung the bear bag by 5. Rain started around 5:30. We’re just laying in our tent now, playing on our phones, listening to the rain on the tent fly. The forecast doesn’t look bad for the next few days. It’s going to rain all night and stop sometime tomorrow morning. Then sunny, mid-60s for Sunday and Monday. Which is good because we want to be in Pearisburg by Monday afternoon and we’ll need to do 2 more 15 mile days. We have a care package waiting for us and I ordered a couple of things for the trail and had them sent to the PO.","Bland, VA

GOAT and Sunkist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612703,"I haven’t talked about my heel/Achilles pain lately because I didn’t want that to be the focus of our hike. Unfortunately that is exactly what has happened. For the last 6 weeks I’ve been battling the soreness and pain. The first part of the day is fine then when we stopped for lunch it would begin to hurt. In the beginning it was just a dull soreness and was easily manageable. I applied ice and heat, new insoles, heel pads, more ibuprofen than I should have been taking, foot massages, got new shoes, elevated my feet whenever we stopped during the day, even lessened our miles. It seemed to work for awhile, then it stopped working. 3 weeks ago I went to see a doctor who diagnosed me with having Achilles tendinitis. She said that it was an overuse injury and I needed to rest it for 2 - 4 or more weeks. She also said that it’s not likely but there was a chance the Achilles’ could rupture or tear. I decided to try to keep going so she prescribed some steroids and told me to be careful. Over the last week the pain has intensified. To the point where I can barely walk when I get to camp late in the day.  Not only that but the pain is no longer just in my heels, it has begun to radiate up through my Achilles. The other day all I could think of was if the Achilles ruptured in the middle of nowhere I may not be able to make it back to civilization. So Mary Jane and I have decided to take a break, head home, and let me heal. Unfortunately this effectively ends my dream of a northbound thru-hike. We are already close to not being able to make it to Maine by the middle of October when Mt Katahdin closes, but taking 2 - 4 weeks off will make it nearly impossible. We’d have to increase our mileage by quite a bit and we really can’t do much more. This is all very disheartening. We had begun to hit our stride and were cranking out good mileage without pushing it. Before we started I thought of all the things that could get injured but I never thought that I’d experience foot pain. Knee or hip pain, yes, but not foot. 


Depending on the healing we have some options. We can do a flip flop hike. We can go up to Maine and hike south until we get to the place we got off. We could also start again further north, hike to Maine, then go back and finish up the section we skipped in the fall. Or we could just skip a section and hike up to Maine. Of course this all depends on how I heal. Even though I am beyond disappointed and heartbroken, I am also so proud of Mary Jane and myself for what we have accomplished. The people we have met along the way and the things we have seen have been inspiring. But most importantly the support we have gotten from our friends and families have been overwhelming and humbling. Thank you all. We have felt your presence and support the entire way. We hope to continue so when we know ... you’ll know.","Stealth Campsite

GOAT and Sunkist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613476,"We’ve been home for a week now trying to heal up. I have to admit it feels odd. My brother had a good analogy, I feel like Tom Hanks in Castaway when he goes back home at the end. I know it’s home but it feels strange, like I don’t belong. 
I went to see an orthopedic doctor today and he gave me good news. I do not have Plantar Faciatis, a stress fracture, bone spurs or any serious injury. He classified it as a Repetitive Stress Injury.  An inflammation in my heal area from the hiking everyday. It is not effecting my Achilles which he said are strong. He also said that my foot looks to be in great shape, bone-wise and arch-wise. He said as far as he was concerned I could get back on trail anytime I wanted. He gave me some tips on how to manage the injury so it wouldn’t be as painful and there is a good chance it would eventually go away. 
So we’ve come up with a plan.  We’re going to take another week or 2 off. The extra rest will help. MJ and I are both going to go up to PA and visit family, then come back home. We’ve decided to start back up, near where we live, in Front Royal, VA (northern end of Shenandoah National Park) and head north. This will put us back on schedule to finish by early September. Then after we summit Mt. Katahdin we can go back to southern VA and finish off the section that we skipped. 
We’re excited to have been medically cleared to continue and can’t wait to be back out there. And now that I know we’re going back maybe I can enjoy being home for another week.",,View Entry,"May 14, Tue",0
GOAT and Sunkist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614030,Just wanted to give a quick update. I went for a short shakedown hike this morning and other than a little stiffness my heels feel great. Of course a couple of miles is a big difference than 15 miles but it’s encouraging. We have decided to get back on trail on Saturday. We’re going to jump back on in Front Royal and head north. That means the section we will have skipped is a little over 300 miles. We can swing back around after we summit Katahdin and finish that section.   We’re excited about the next sections of the trail because they go through our home territory. I’m originally from NJ and lived in PA for 15 years and MJ has lived in PA most of her life. We still have loads of friends and family in both states. I also have family in Mass and ME so we’ll have plenty of support the rest of the way. The other thing we’re looking forward to is running into people that we’ve met along the trail that had gotten ahead of us. By jumping ahead they should be catching up with us all throughout PA. Can’t wait.,"

GOAT and Sunkist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614519,"We’re back at it. We got dropped off at the Hwy 522 trailhead in Front Royal, VA at 8:30am and headed north. The terrain wasn’t bad. Only 2 long climbs today. It was hot and humid which is something we hadn’t really experienced yet on our trip. The other big change since we got off trail is that everything is green and the forest is in mid summer form. There were parts of the trail that were already overgrown. When we got off 2 weeks ago things were just starting to bloom. We hiked a little over 10 miles. We’re feeling good but tired. Our legs were like jelly by the end which is to be expected after a 2 week layoff. We were on the trail for 30 minutes when we ran into West Country, a friend from the UK. We had hiked with him after we left the Smokies and then on and off afterwards. We’ll probably camp with him until we get into Harpers Ferry on Tuesday. We also saw a couple we met at a BandB in Roan Mt over a month ago. That’s the advantage of jumping forward on the Trail, we’re seeing people again who we know but are faster hikers than us and have moved ahead of us on the trail.","VA 522 - Front Royal

It’s nice having service while we’re laying in our tent waiting for it to get dark. Today was a good day. We did 13 miles and are tenting at Rod Hollow Shelter.

GOAT and Sunkist,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614819,"Our AT journey is officially over. After 76 days on the trail we have decided to call it an adventure. Our bodies, especially mine, were beginning to break down and we were tired of dealing with the pain. We’re obviously disappointed but also filled with pride and accomplishment. In total we hiked 653 miles. Spent 40 nights in our tent, 10 nights in shelters, and 26 nights in hostels/hotels/cabins. We endured thunderstorms on open mountaintops, saw spectacular sunrises and sunsets, mountain views that took our breath away. We experienced what it felt like to be alone, miles from civilization, and carrying everything we needed on our backs. It is the definition of self-reliance. We met and became friends with dozens of people that we would never have otherwise known. Good, decent people who would give you the shirt off their back, or better yet a half a roll of toilet paper, if you needed it.  We now know what it’s like to hike in a driving rainstorm for 5 straight hours with no relief. That day was also our most miles in the shortest period of time. 13 miles in 5 hours. But then there was a room and a cheeseburger waiting for us on the other end. We always hiked our fastest when we were going into town. We also now know when we look at a map and see we have a 3000 foot climb, over 5 miles, that we can do it. We experienced a lifestyle that few will ever get to experience. Im not saying everyone would like it but for us it was a once in a lifetime adventure that we wouldn’t have traded for the world. And we’re not done yet. We’ve already talked about exploring the National Parks. Maybe even a shorter thru hike like the Long Trail. Either way we are inspired to do more ... see more ... experience more. We’ve only just begun.",,Morgan Mill Rd - VA 605,"May 28, Tue",0
