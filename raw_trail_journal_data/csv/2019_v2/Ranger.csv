Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620513,I’m 1900 miles into the AT after starting it in 2014.  I had hoped to complete it over the last two years but a bout of Giardia in 2017 and a foot injury in 2018 has me still trying to get out of New Hampshire.I’ll be starting at Pinkham Notch where I was forced to get off last year.   Looking forward to Maine!!,,View Entry,"Aug 06, Tue",0
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620665,"It seems like I’ve done this so many times, packing for the trail.  It’s a ritual.  One of the rites that us LASHers, Long Ass Section Hikers go through every year.  I have a large plastic tub with all my gear in it that I pulled out and started sorting through it.  Pack, tent, sleeping pad, stove, left over snickers bar ... whoops.  I pulled everything out and shook my head that I could carry it once again.  Over the years I’ve refined my kit so I’m down to about 22 pounds base weight.  Base weight doesn’t include food or water.  Base weight does include way too much stuff.  I’m not an ultra lighter by any stretch but I have managed to shave off a few unnecessary pounds.  My first experience with weight loss was at Neal Gap, a few days in from Springer Mountain, GA.   The legendary Baltimore Jack tossed my pack and pulled out a couple pounds of stuff to mail back.  So now every year I try to reduce a little more, buy some newer and lighter piece of gear, or forgo something I haven’t used much.
This year the only thing I tried to replace were a couple of stuff sacks that I tried to get lighter.  I actually increased my load slightly from past years by carrying my winter down sleeping bag.  I wasn’t sure what to expect from Maine in early September.
I set up my tent in the front yard and sprayed it with waterproofing, I hung my clothes in the backyard and sprayed them with Permethrin, and gathered all the rest of my gear onto the floor.  Unfortunately I didn’t see anything that was able to be left out.  
Next up was grocery shopping.  I still had a pretty good selection of freeze dried dinners but needed to pick up breakfast, lunch and snack items.  It’s almost amazing at what looks good sitting at home versus what you crave after a 2,000 foot climb.  I did my best to remember what I craved last year and made my grocery list.
It’s also amazing when you walk out of the grocery store with 3 full shopping bags of food and then realize you’ll never be able to carry all this.  Well I’ll triage through that on the den floor.  
Confident that I purchased everything I needed, I returned home and retrieved my tent and clothes and plopped them on the den floor.  Somehow all this needed to get into my pack - tomorrow.  Today, it’s time for one last trip to the beach.",,View Entry,"Aug 07, Wed",0
Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620669,"Today was the last minute flurry of activity, buying bus tickets, getting a room at Joe Dodge Lodge, and ... packing.   It’s actually easier than I make it out to be, after 5 years of packing for the AT I have my system that works for me.  The toughest part was deciding what  food to fit in.  I always over pack on food and unfortunately today was no exception. My luxury item this year was homemade Bacon jerky.  This stuff is the best!  You bake a pound of brown sugar coated bacon for about an hour and 45 minutes and it becomes Bacon Perfection.  I baked the jerky early this morning so it will be as fresh as possible when I hit the trail.  I have a package of commercial Bacon jerky as well, but it just doesn’t match the decadence of the homemade variety.
Getting back to Pinkham Notch, NH consists of two easy bus rides for me of about 6 hours total.  A bus from Cape Cod to Boston’s South Station and then a bus direct to Pinkham Notch.  It’s a beautiful ride up through New Hampshire to the White Mountains.  I have a bunk room at the AMC Joe Dodge Lodge for the night, and then hit the trail in the morning.
Last year I left the trail at Joe Dodge Lodge after a foot injury coming down Mt. Madison cut my hike short.  I’m wary that some unexpected injury or illness could get me again, but hopeful that I will be standing on Katahdin in early September!",,View Entry,"Aug 08, Thu",0

I woke up early in Joe Dodge Lodge, orange light streaming through the open blinds.  I had come in late so didn’t notice that the blinds had been left open.  Breakfast was at 6:30 so I made a trip to the bathroom down the hall, got dressed and sent some emails as I now had WiFi.  


Breakfast was wonderful- pancakes, bacon, sausage, potatoes, fresh fruit.  Just what you need to start a grueling day of climbing Wildcat mountain.  I went back to my room and finished packing and was out the door to start up the mountain.  Until ...  since Ihad just changed phones the Guthook app that hikers use to give us trail information wasn’t registered to the new phone.  So back to the world of WiFi land where I could sign in to the so and update maps.  Now finally back on the trail.
I had heard the Wildcats were tough, but I wasn’t really prepared for this my first day back in the trail. One rock wall after another presented itself so I put away my hiking poles since they were worthless.  I climbed part of the way with a dayhiker named Lynn.  She was supposed to have hiked this with her thru hiker husband but he had gotten here early and decided not to wait for her and went ahead.  If my wife had come out to join me on a section of the hike I would definitely have waited for her! 


Reaching the summit of Wildcat D I was surprised to find a ski gondola operation.  I hadn’t realized that the Wildcats were a ski resort and they also operate in the summer to bring tourists to the summit.  We always joke after a tough climb that we should have taken the ski lift, and here there actually was one.  It’s a bit of a juxtaposition to see dirty, sweaty, exhausted hikers coming over the summit into a bunch of tourists in bright clean clothes and sandals who just rode up for a view.


After a quick lunch and a few pictures I continued on to the rest of the Wildcats.  There are 4 Wildcats named, E, D, C, and finally the tallest Wildcat A at 4422 msl.  The Wildcats are tough, with lots of rock climbs and  descents.  When you finally reach the summit of Wildcat A, you have a nice view of Carter Notch Hut, my goal for the night.  The Hut is 1100 feet below with a very steep and rocky 1.1 mile descent.


Reaching the Hut I was surprised to find a couple of the Croo were from one of the huts I stayed at last year.  E.B. and Kyler were at Lonesome Lake Hut last year and were working Carter Notch this year.  The huts are very cool, self sustaining hike-in lodging operated by the Appalachian Mountain Club.  They are staffed by 5-6 students, the Croo, who cook meals and maintain the hut.  They also have the chore of packing in all the food the guests eat so twice a week they go down the mountain and haul up 40-60 pounds of produce, meat, and any other food supplies needed.  They are incredible young people who have a passion for the mountains and service.


Unfortunately for me they didn’t have any work for stay available, but invited me to get dinner with the other hikers doing work for stay and told me where I could stealth camp not far away.  The other hikers were SOBO’s and had gotten to the Hut just before I did and got the work for stay gig.  Nuke, FitBit, and Quebec we’re headed south, three weeks out of Mt. Katahdin.  In exchange for meals and the luxury of sleeping in the floor in the dining haul, the Croo has you help with a cleaning task around the huts.  Usually sweeping up or doing dishes.


I went up the trail a quarter mile and set up camp and then came back down for dinner.  Chicken breasts, vegetables and fresh bread.  To a hiker it is such a feast!  It started raining while we were eating and I was glad to have already set up camp.  After dinner I climbed back up the mountain in the dark and crawled into my sleeping bag.  A tough day to start with a nice finish.  Tomorrow was going to be another tough set of mountains, the Carters.","Pinkham Notch- Joe Dodge Lodge

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620884,"It rained on and off all night and when morning came I did not want to get out of sleeping bag.  The rain had stopped at least and I crawled out to a gloomy day.  The forecast was for storms to come in and get colder.  I packed up and ate breakfast reluctantly.  I could hear the Croo down below at Carter Notch Hut called the guests to breakfast, 7 am.  I packed the last of my gear, checked the campsite (Leave No Trace) and started up Carter Dome. It started to rain again as soon as I started up the mountain, which was to be the theme of the day.  On and off rain showers.  The first 1000 feet was like like the Wildcats, lots of climbing rock faces.  Finally the trail started to change to a long continual uphill grade that was more hiking and less  rock climbing.  On top of Carter Dome there was an open area surrounded by trees and a foundation of a former fire tower.   The trail then descended steeply to Mt. Hight and then very steeply to Zeta pass, 1000 feet below.  


Zeta Pass was supposed to have water but everything was dry.  Fortunately a nice “Jewish mother” (her words), had extra water and offered me some of hers.  She and her husband were headed for Carter Notch Hut and I gave them a preview of the hike ahead of them.  I started up the trail again to South Carter, Middle Carter, and North Carter Mountains.  From North Carter it was a treacherous, Rocky 1200 foot descent to Imp Campsite, my objective for the night.  Half way down North Carter it started raining hard.   The wind picked up and I could hear thunder in the far distance.  The rocks got wet and even more slippery and I grew more cautious.


By the time I reached Imp I was soaked and all I wanted to do was get my tent set up.  The shelter was full and I found a small piece of level ground to set up my tent.  I set it up in the rain and threw the contents of my pack in it and dove in.  After a few minutes to collect myself, I started inflating my air mattress and get my sleeping bag spread out.  No small feat in a one man tent with me already inside of it.  I finally got things arranged, stripped off my wet clothes and crawled into my sleeping bag trying to get warm.  The wind was howling outside and coming up the valley to get underneath my tent fly.  I shivered in my sleeping bag until finally I warmed up.  I decided no dinner tonight, I just wanted to stay warm.


About midnight I woke up and went outside for a bathroom break and readjusted my tent stakes.  The wet ground had loosened around them.  The wind continued to howl all night long, coming down the mountain in waves.  It had been a tough second day, one that encourages you to quit this foolishness.  However we always say, Never Quit on a Bad Day.","Carter Notch

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620902,"I woke up to the sounds of howling wind and dripping on my tent.  The rain had stopped but everything was wet and muddy.  Crawling out of my tent I could see the mist swiftly flowing through the mountains above Imp Campsite.  I walked down to get my food out of the bear box and get water.  Everyone was moving slowly.The process of drying out was going to take a while.  I hung up my wet clothes in the trees and hopped the wind would at least dry them out a little.  I am not an ultralighter and so at least I had a second set of dry clothes, but that was just pants and T-shirt.  My only warm long sleeve shirt was soaked.  I ate breakfast while attempting to dry things out and slowly started packing up.  I finally got the courage to pull on my wet long sleeve shirt and rain jacket, put on dry socks and pulled on my wet boots.  I sling my pack on and started up the trail for 850 foot climb up Mt. Moriah.  To my fortune, the climb up Moriah was a pleasure compared to the Wildcats and the Carters.  It was more of a hike with very little rock climbing.  There were lots and lots of granite slabs to climb, but they were fairly easy grade and not slick at all.  There were lots of views all the way up Moriah and I kept thinking this is the way all the Whites should have been.


The views were fantastic and this would be one of the last views of the Presidential Range.  At 4049 feet, Moriah was the last of the 4000 footers on the AT in the Whites.  Descending down Moriah the sun started shining, the wind died down and the trail was a much easier descent than the last 100 miles. I was through the Whites!


 The trail was finally a dirt footpath through a forest as it got to the lower elevations.  Descending down to 830 feet elevation takes you back into mixed pine and hardwood forests, and much warmer temperatures.  Up at Imp someone said the temperature that night was 40 degrees.


My hoped for destination was Rattle River Hostel.  There I could dry out and get some real people food.  I got there around 5:30 and fortunately they still had a bunk available.  The hostel has been sold out for months I’m told.  The hostel in impressive and they make you take a shower before you can enter the house.  All camping gear has to stay outside too.  They do your laundry for you and you can get food delivered or use their kitchen.  At night there is a fire pit where we hear trail stories and I got to sleep in a real bed.  It was only my third day back but I was starting to re-aclimate to Trail life.","Imp Campsite

Ranger,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620971,"1900, it’s just a number, another of a long list of numbers on the way to 2192.  It’s 2192 miles from GA to ME, this year.  The trail length varies from year to year as the trail gets rerouted.  1900 also means that it’s less than 300 miles to Katahdin, and about 10 miles to Maine.  Yes, 1900 is a nice milestone number.  I passed the 1900 mile mark today and it feels good.


I woke up this morning in the comfort of a real bed in Rattle River Hostel.  The hostel provides sheets and blankets, they didn’t even allow sleeping bags in the house.  I spent some time writing trail journals and catching up email and news.  I decided not to rush out but to have an enjoyable morning before pushing back out on the trail.  Having WiFi in town is one of the pleasures of the trail.  Up in the mountains the cell coverage is worse than spotty.


With the Whites behind me I expected  a fairly easy day.  The campsite I was heading for was only 6 miles away and the day was warm and sunny.  Leaving town is always tough, but I finally paid my bill and walked away about 11 am.  The trail takes you to the outskirts of Gorham, NH walking on roads and then finally turns uphill into the forest.  The walking was pleasant except for mosquitoes, and with the exertion the warm day turned hot.  I was guzzling water throughout the 1700 foot climb and was starting to get concerned about the next water source.  Checking the trail guide I was disappointed to find that the water source labeled “small stream” was really just a few skanky puddles in the middle of summer.  As I pushed on I started to try to conserve water.  


When I reached the summit of Mt. Hayes at 2555 msl, I stopped for lunch and found wild blueberries!  I made sure to eat my fill of blueberries and then headed down the mountain toward the water source.  As predicted, the water source was just a few puddles as the stream wasn’t running.  I filled my bottle but told myself it was just emergency water.


Pushing along up the next climb over Cascade Mountain I was getting weary.  So far it had been good Trail with no rock climbs like the past few days, but on Cascade Mountain the trail designers turned to their old ways and found routes to take the trail up a number of rock faces.  I was surprised to see numerous piles of Moose droppings up on the side of Cascade Mountain.  I thought Moose would stay lower near the streams.  Finally reaching the top of Cascade Mountain I was exhausted until I came to a view that truly took my breath away.  From the overlook was a magnificent view of the Wildcats, the Carters, and Mt. Moriah.  All the effort put into climbing those mountains was now worth it for that view.  Just magnificent!


Coming down Cascade someone had arranged some sticks into a “1900” and there it was, another milestone!  A little further down the trail was the side trail to Trident Col Campsite.  Upon arriving there I met a group of hikers that had passed me on the morning climb- Head Knocker, Stretches, Lost and Found, Grits, and Other Guy.  They were Flip Floppers starting in Harpers Ferry and were celebrating less than 300 miles to Katahdin.   I set up my camp, made dinner and listened to their stories.  It was a day of Milestones.  We should move into Maine tomorrow and that will be another milestone.","Rattle River Hostel
