Suntory,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606397,"Hi everyone,
I am pleased to announce that I am starting back on the AT in mid to late March. I have already hiked from the Approach Trail to Springer to a bit above Daleville, VA. I have also hiked from North Adams, Massachusetts to about half way through New Hampshire. I have also hiked small sections in New Jersey, Connecticut, and Massachusetts, but I think that I will rehike these sections. 
If you would like to read my journals up to this point, please use the following urls, http:/www.trailjournals.com/suntoryt... for my 2016 travels and http:/www.trailjournals.com/suntory for my 2017 travels which weren’t as extensive. 
I willl be using the gear that I used in 2016. I have a Eureka Midori Solo Tent and a Lafuma sleeping bag rated to 20 degrees. In 2016, I also upgraded to a Hyperlight backpack. 
I am greatly looking forward to getting back on the trail. This year, I have decided to train every day at the Jewish Community Center in Vestal, NY in order to make sure I don’t bonk this year. When  I think back to 2016, I don’t know what kept me going as I was overweight and had done no physical training. I am running two miles a day almost every day and I’m also swimming laps in the pool. I feel pretty good and I hope I can hit the ground running when I get on the trail. 
I am also doing shakedown hikes on the Finger Lakes Trail and the numerous county parks that are around Binghamton, NY. It is snowy and cold right now in Upstate New York, but I am heartened by the fact that I’m hiking in the woods. 
There is also some good news. Starr Trek may be hiking with me for the first two weeks that I am back on the AT. I met Starr Trek around Rock Gap near Franklin, NC and we hiked together to Gatlinburg, TN. It will be nice to hike with him again. 
Anyway, please stay tuned. I plan on making it all the way to Katahdin this year by around Labor Day.",,Jennings Creek Gap,"Mar 01, Fri",0
Suntory,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608660,I begin again at the place I stopped last time--Jennings Creek Gap near Arcadia VA. My dad drove me down from NY and we stayed in Lexington last night. Weather turned to rain--but it's a good chance to test my gear. I am taking it slow at first. Starting late today and went to Bryant Ridge Shelter. This shelter is huge! But I guess I am very early and I am the only one here. The rain stopped and the sun came out even though it's gonna be cold tonight.,"Jennings Creek, Arcadia, VA
",Bryant Ridge Shelter,"Mar 21, Thu",3.80
Suntory,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608663,Cold night but slept well. No other hikers showed up so I guess I am starting a bit early up here in Virginia. After starting out the AT climbs 2200 feet to the top of Floyd Mountain. It will take a few days to get hiker legs again. Then the descent to Cornelius Creek Shelter. It looks like I have the place to myself tonight.,"Bryant Ridge Shelter
",Cornelius Creek Shelter,"Mar 22, Fri",4.90
Suntory,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608664,"It was cold and windy at Cornelius Creek Shelter. Got up and got moving eventually. It's sunny and the wind is gradually diminishing. I passed by Black Rock View--could probably see 100 miles. Greeted a few day hikers but no other LASHers or ThruHikers yet. I am reading a lot of comments in Guthook about snakes around here. So maybe starting early before they end hibernation is not such a bad idea. It was steep going up to Apple Orchard Mountain and I saw the weather radar station as I approached the top. Then a quick descent through the rock feature called the Guillotine and on to the shelter. I met two trail maintainers, Gasper and Happy Foot, who told me the spring at the shelter was fine. Time for some pasta primavera. It will be cold tonight.","Cornelius Creek Shelter
",Thunder Hill Shelter,"Mar 23, Sat",5.30
Suntory,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608800,"Someone showed up with their dog and set up a tent rather late so I didn't have a chance to meet and greet. It was really cold and despite my best efforts to wear everything, I had trouble sleeping. But when the sun rose and was shining into the shelter it warmed up fast and was too comfortable so I slept later than I wanted to. I didn't get on the trail until 11AM. It was much warmer as the afternoon went by. I had a nice view from the Thunder Ridge Overlook but continued on. I noticed a few comments about Highcock Knob being a climb with no view. It was more of a climb than I expected and there was basically no views although I could see some since the leaves are not out yet. I got to the Marble Spring campsite (and gushing spring) around 6pm. My Garmin map mentioned a Marble Spring Shelter--but that must be long gone. Nobody else showed up. Rain predicted for tomorrow.","Thunder Hill Shelter
",Marble Spring Campsite,"Mar 24, Sun",6.90
Suntory,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608915,It wasn't raining when I finally got up at Marble Spring. But I knew rain was coming. I could see the James River from the ridge but the trail then led away from that valley and down the valley to Matt's Creek. I met a hiker coming the other way who was wearing only a t-shirt and jeans. I hope he had other gear since he had 10 miles to go to Thunder Hill Shelter. As I reached Matt's Creek shelter the rain started. I was able to get across the creek on some sketchy boulders that were getting slippery in the rain. I decided I would hole up in the shelter rather than hiking further in the downpour. Some other nobo hikers showed up--a dad and his two sons. He explained he had hiked from Georgia to Pearisburg VA in 1981. So he took his grown sons to Pearisburg in 2019 to continue his hike. They were planning to hike as far as Delaware Water Gap. Then they'll go to Hawaii to celebrate his birthday. Sounds like a plan to me.,"Marble Spring Campsite

Suntory,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608916,The rain was gone and the sun came up. I hiked out to cross the James River. Apparently if you jump off the bridge you might get fined. Good thing it's too cold for me to want to jump in anyway. Time to head into Glasgow and Stanimals hostel. I have to pick up my resupply box and have some welcome town food.,"Matt's Creek Shelter
",Glasgow,"Mar 26, Tue",2.10
Suntory,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609030,"I was the only hiker at Stanimals hostel. I really liked staying there. Super clean! I took care of calling Hyperlite about a problem with an exterior cell phone carrier that ripped--they will be replacing it and sending the replacement ahead to Waynesboro. I ate burgers, did laundry and rested up. Tomorrow will be the brutal climb  north from the James River. At least the weather is going to be very good. I am watching Survivor tonight and getting a good night's sleep. I heard there might be three other hikers here tonight but haven't seen them yet.","Glasgow

Suntory,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609058,"I had a nice night at Stanimals. Got up, ate breakfast, and got ready for the shuttle back to the trail that left at 9AM. I got started and soon came to Johns Hollow Shelter. This is a nice shelter and I was tempted just to stay there the rest of the day but I pushed on and started the steep ascent to the ridge. You start at an elevation less than 700 feet at the River to around 2400 feet at the ridge in a short distance. I had a full pack and 4 liters of water knowing that I would not find water on the ridge and would be camping up there. I found there were nice campsites at Little Rocky Row and decided to stay there tonight. Weather is very nice. I am glad I got up that ascent.","
",Campsite at Little Rocky Row,"Mar 28, Thu",3.80
Suntory,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609137,"The campsite on Little Rocky Row was very comfortable, except for there being no water and no water for miles after you get up here. It wasn't as cold at night for which I was grateful. I got up to a warming day and started out. I felt a little sore after yesterday but some ""vitamin I"" soon improved that. I hiked over Big Rocky Row and then on to Salt Log Gap (where they might or might not be water .5 mile west--Guthook doesn't have it but AWOL does). But I didn't want to take time to find it and kept hiking. I hiked over Bluff Mountain and didn't see the snake there were comments about last year. Hopefully hibernation is still going on. I pulled into Punchbowl Shelter. I was soon joined by two other groups of thru hikers. So a social evening. One hiker, Sitting Rock, will be in the shelter tonight. He is doing a flip-flop after starting in Tennessee. I read some comments from last year about the bugs being bad at this shelter. But it's way too early for the bugs to be a problem tonight.","Campsite at Little Rocky Row
",Punchbowl Shelter,"Mar 29, Fri",7
Suntory,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609186,I had a restful night at Punchbowl Shelter but somehow just didn't have much gas in the tank when I got up. I got going and met a number of trail maintainers--thanks for all you do!! I had planned to go on to the next shelter since I knew it was supposed to rain late Saturday night/Sunday morning. But I decided to stay near a spring close to the Lynchburg Reservoir. I was getting close as I hiked over Rice Mountain. A comment mentioned a great stealth campsite. It took me a little while to find it but I finally did and it was a great site. I hope the rainstorm won't be too bad tonight.,"Punchbowl Shelter
