Ole Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607581,"Well
it's time to get serious about getting ready for my thru hike attempt. I have
to say attempt as 80% of those that start a thru hike on the Appalachian trail
do not finish. I have attempted twice before in 2017. I started northbound
(NOBO) and after week I had to leave as my Dad passed away unexpectedly. After
spending 2 months settling the majority of my parent’s estate I was back in
Maine.  Being in Maine it seemed to make
sense to try hiking southbound (SOBO).  I
had planned all the food, taken time off and saved for the trip. Once again
after only 5 days on the trail I fell in the 100-mile wilderness, falling down
a bank and had a really bad blow to the head. Now as a nurse I always think
about the worse and after hiking on for another couple miles with a severe
headache I felt I needed to leave the trail for safety sake. My concerns were
if I had a minor brain bleed from the fall, I could have severe consequences
before help could reach me in that remote area of the trail. I was able to get
a ride out with some fishermen and my husband picked me up outside of Milo
Maine. It's been a couple years, I've officially retired at 62 and feel it's
time to go hit the woods again to try and reach my dream of a full thru hike.
After much thought and deliberation, I decided on a flip flop hike. This is
when you start the Appalachian trail somewhere near the middle and hike north
or south, flip back and forth according you your plans to complete the trail
within a 12-month period. Originally my goal going northbound was I was hiking
""Home"". Being retired I spend my winters in Florida but I was raised in
Maine and a Mainiac at heart. My summers were spent at a girl scout camp
located beside Baxter Park and I have been climbing Mt Katahdin nearly every
year since I was 8 yo. Going home to Katahdin just felt so right. Well in my
NOBO attempt even though I was only on the trail for 6 days I learned a lot.  1.) I found I didn't like the big group of
people hiking, 2.) need to get a spot for camping early as there would be 50+
people in an area at night 3.)Hostels were filled or you had to make
reservations and that locked you into a time frame to complete miles regardless
of how you feel or weather.  I'm older,
I'm fat and slow that pressure to make miles changed my plan and suddenly it
didn't become my hike anymore.  In going
SOBO there wasn't the pressure of the people but you start in the most
difficult section of the trail. I have hiked most of Maine in section hikes.
Recently I found at my age the miles were harder and I was harder on myself to
make those miles. Even before the fall that took me off the trail, I was
worried about making it to Monson within my designated time frame with food and
such. Knowing those things personally and talking to successful flip flop “senior”
hikers I decided the flip flop hike was the best option for an overweight 62
yo. This allows me to start in the ""easiest"".... relative term
regarding backpacking on the Appalachian Trail... part of the hike. I will be
hitting New England with strong trail legs but not worn out and tired from 5
months of hiking.  No time restrictions
to reach Baxter before it closes.   It allows me to take a few weeks off in Maine
to spend time at home before flipping back and hiking south. Logistics for me
in Maine are easy as my family is there so they can join me for sections and
help support me. I am planning to start at the southern end of the Shenandoah
National Park and hike north to Katahdin. Additionally, besides the flip flop
plan I am starting off with a support vehicle. I will make use of the shuttle
services so I can park my car ahead along the trail and hike to it. The
distance ahead will depend on how it goes. To start I am planning on only a
little over 30 miles. Each time my goal is to extend that distance further.
Additionally I will be hiking with my Havanese dog. I will only be doing low daily
miles to start as I adjust to trail life and the exercise also this will be
easy for the dog to manage just fine.  As
I go along and the terrain gets more difficult, I can shuttle the dog home if
needed.... less mental stress on the journey. Another factor involved is one of
my 3 adult children and her husband will be coming back to Maine for a week
vacation. It’s been 3 years since they have been able to come home.  I want to be able to go back to Maine to be
there while they are home. This should help me with ""homesickness""
and missing the family emotions that creep up when hiking alone. 
YES, I
am hiking alone. I know I will find other hikers along the way and make new
friends. I do better hiking solo where I don't have to worry, I am holding
someone up or if I want to go further, stop sooner, or take a day off that a
hiking partner may not want to do.
Having
attempted a thru hike previously I have all my gear and done shake downs so
know what I will be taking. With the car support/shuttle plan I won't have to
carry as much. Extra gear, food and change out equipment can be kept in the car
for when I need it. By getting off the trail with the car every week I can look
at forecasts and pack accordingly, I don't have to pack for every occasion this
way. I will do a note on my gear next with photos of what I use.

Ole Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609193,"I officially retired yesterday, Friday and now last minute prep work is in order.   My plan is to start my hike at RockFish Gap the southern end of Shenandoah National Park in approximately 2 weeks.  Down to the count getting ready.  My plan is to have no plan.   I will putter along hiking northbound (NOBO) and see how things go.  If nothing else I learned in my previous thru hike attempts is life is unpredictable and sometimes shit happens we can't control.  By setting schedules and lots of planning I was putting too much pressure on myself.  This time I am hiking with no agenda, days will be as long as I wont and pace that feels right that day.  As another hiker said, ""never pass up a good sit rock""so I will sit, relax and enjoy the journey not pushing to make certain miles.  It is my hope as I adapt into trail life my daily miles will get higher and my conditioning better so I can start pushing myself more if it feels right.Today I organized food I have purchased and also tried cold soaking the pasta meals I have.   I purchased pre-set pasta meals at Walmart where everything is included.  Each box mix I divided into 3 Ziplock freezer bags and the seasoning powder into a small bag to add after pasta is hydrated.  The meals I tried worked well with cold soaking to hydrate for eating. Additionally I added a Tablespoon of dehydrated veggies for extra zip to the meal.  I have been picking up individual mayonnaise packets at the deli, a few each time, so used those with mixing the dressing for the pasta dishes.  It all was successful.  One packet suggested adding milk for a creamer mix so the first taste was okay then I added some powdered milk to the mixture and liked the creamer version.  So powdered milk added to those packed up for eating on the trailTomorrow my plan is to apply my premetherin to clothes and hammock.   Seeing too many folks struggling with Lyme disease in Maine I don't want to take any chances.   Depending on how my hike progresses I may need to retreat my clothes again as they will be washed weekly.   I will also spend some time organizing my pack, rechecking how things fit and placement. This will give me time to play around with things.  Also it's time for me to start wearing my fully loaded pack daily around the house and all my walks, including walking the dogs.  There probably won't be any more posts till I actually start hiking.  My plan is to journal frequently as I can when I have internet access.","None

Ole Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609783,"Making final plans for the start of my Flip Flop hike of the Appalachian Trail.   I received some information that parts of Shenandoah National park are closed due to storm damage.   Originally I was planning to start hiking at the southern end of the park, staging my car about 40 miles ahead in a parking area.   I would make use of shuttles to section hike northward with my dog.  As ""Harley"" is young and a small dog I felt I would need to bring him home after a bit and return to the trail alone to continue.   Part of me is insecure in finishing this hike as past trials I haven't done well.   So having my car is a safety net for me if I get sick or struggle.   It is with great hope that I get off successfully, no family emergencies, and I can successfully complete my hike as I have planned.   Soooo... with the intel on the closure and possible no parking in parts of SNP I looked an another option.   I contacted Open Arms Hostel in Luray VA for assistance.  They have been fabulous!!!!!!   My plan is to drive from Florida to Virginia next Friday.   Saturday morning I will finish my drive to Thornton Gap in SNP.   Open Arms Hostel shuttle will meet me at the parking lot at 1PM and drive me to Front Royal VA.  I will hike south from Front Royal back to my car.  Starting mid afternoon my goal is 2.9 miles to the first shelter south.  I can stealth if that doesn't workout.  There aren't options for parking in Front Royal.  After hiking back to my car over the next 4 days or so I plan on going to Open Arms Hostel for a night off the trail.  Shower, laundry and pet friendly so no issues with Harley being with me.   I am planning low miles each day to ease into hiking conditioning.  All my plans for hiking in Florida and workouts have not come to reality.  Always excuses and also life, work and getting things finished to leave seem to fill my days.  Time has flown by and now it's down to the wire.    Interestingly Alison from Open Arms Hostel told me she didn't know of any closures now in SNP and was unaware of parking limits.   This just reminds me to be flexible and work out things as I go and some folks may not be accurate in their information.  As it stands now I will be hiking most of SNP in the flip side of my hike in the Fall so any concerns with clearing the trail should be finished.  Also I most likely will not have my car so that wouldn't be an issue with parking.   I'd also have options for using Open Arms Hostel again starting southbound (SOBO).  Abbreviations.NOBO - Northbound,   SOBO - southbound.  Thru Hiker - someone who completes the Appalachian trail in a 12 month period in any way they want.   Flip Flop - alternate hiking plan, generally starting midway along the trail and hiking in one direction then flipping at a certain point and hike the rest of the trail in the other directions.  Most common Flip Flop is starting in Harpers Ferry north to Katahdin, back to Harpers Ferry and hike south to Springer Mnt.   SNP - Shenandoah National Park,    AMC - Appalachian Mountain Club (New England organization mostly involved in Whites of NH.)  White Blaze - White marks for the Appalachian trail.  GORP - ""good old raisins and peanuts or generally a trail mix snack.  HYOH -  Hike your own hike.  PUDs - Pointless Ups and Downs,  MUDs - Mindless Ups and Downs,  NERO - nearly 0 mile day, generally 1 mile or less,  ZERO - 0 miles hiked that day, rest day.Next posts will be from the trail.","None

Ole Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610794,"April 13, 2019  Day #1.  First day on the trail.  I met my shuttle driver at Thornton Gap.  Saw my first wild life there as a Doe and her fawn came strolling across an open area.   The owner of Open Arms hostel that gave me a shuttle, Alison, was soooooo nice.   I think I will stay there when I am done this section.  I may take a day and visit Luray caverns as I hear they are pretty interesting.  I don't know if I will ever be back this way so I'm going to take time to smell the Rose's and see the areas I'm in where I have my car.  Met a daughter, father team starting same time as me.  Didn't chat much but maybe will get to know them later.  Shes a plus size woman too and we big girls need to stick together.    Today was mostly elevation gain, a short down hill.  I set my goals to a tree and would hike to that.   Didn't pass up a good sit rock or downed tree in hoping I'm not beating my out of shape body up too bad.   This is slow and steady for me....no time frame.    I made it to the Tom floyd shelter where a group of boyscouts and their dads were already camped.  It was only 5 but they convinced me to stay and I'm glad I did.  It was a great evening of chatting with some great guys from Virginia.  Harley loved all the attention from the boys and adults.  They even fed me.  spicy bean and sausage soup.  I wasn't hungry but managed a cup of soup n beans.  Passed off the sausage as my stomach wasn't real happy with that much spice.   Drank my electrolytes.  Think I may need more.  Been thirsty tonight so getting more water in.    Weather was muggy to start in the 70s then cooled a bit with cloud cover and was more comfortable hiking.   the trees are just starting to bud and those that flower are in full bloom. Very pretty scattered thru out the woods.   I think they might be chockcherries.    Violets and some other white ground flowers add color to things.   Off to bed...tomorrows a new day and I'll see how I do with a full day of hiking.  The next shelter is 10.5 and where the boys are headed.  It might be nice to reach that tho I know that will be pushing this out of shape body.  My goal is 5 miles and we will see after that.","US Rt 522 Front Royal

Not much for photo shots with the cloud cover and rain.  I did jump a herd of 5 deer, one stayed for a photo shoot.  I  pushed on to get to the shelter as the rain started in earnest around 4 pm.  I had thought I might stay in the shelter where bad weather was predicted and started before I got there.  That wasn't going to happen...old white beard stopped me at the edge of the shelter shouting...""its full you cant stay"".  I hurried to hang my hammock as I was really shaking in cold.  I know hyperthermia was starting as I struggled to set up my hammock in a driving rain and gale winds on a side hill.   Everything got soaked as I worked to try to set up before complete darkness.  No dinner...crawled in my hammock and miserable night with gale winds and heavy heavy rain.  I was up multiple times to re-tie the rain fly as the wind was so strong it was ripping out my stakes.   This is a learning process as I am exposed to things I haven't been previously.   I have camped in rain but never in such a wild storm where I hurried to set up.   In trying to lighten my load I almost let out the space blanket in my first aid kit.   I was so glad I didn't because when I finally got into my hammock I was shaking with cold and soaked.  Rain was dripping in for a bit at first as I hadn't gotten the rainfly set well in the rush.  The space blanket helped warm me with my down quilt - allowing some protection from the wet as well.  Definitely will keep a space blanket in the pack......another day in the books.","Tom Floyd Shelter

Ole Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610897,"Zero day waiting out the storm coming through this afternoon thru midnight.  Tornado warnings so hammock hanging in the woods did not sound like a fun thing to me.  Slow and steady, even slower than I thought with the inclement weather.  In the big picture it really doesn't matter.  It's a long journey and it's my hike at my pace.   I know I need to take it slow.  If I was out and injured the delay would be much longer than a day and half.
Drove into Harpers Ferry to look around a bit today in the rain.  Picked up another pair of socks to replace the pair lost somewhere in Shenandoah NP.   Stopped at the Appalachian Trail conservatory and had a great chat with the two gentlemen there.  I may get a little more time to look around this really cool town next weekend during the AT Flip Flop Festival.
Just a little update on the old body.  No soreness which is great, other than a little leg stiffness in the AM which is common on any given day.  I do have 2 small blisters;  one on the outside of the left heel pad and one on the inside of the ball on my right foot.  Those both developed on day 2 when I pushed on through the rain.  Being tired I notice my gait becomes more rolling and that is why those two blisters developed I think.    Also I have 2 toenails on my left foot that are loosening after an injury prior to leaving for my hiking adventure.  The great toe doesn't bother yet but the second toe the nail is lose along one side so it shifts and causes pain if not secured down with good blister tape.  I think they will feel better once they come off.  
I reviewed my food choices for the next section and hope my appetite and stomach issues will start to improve.  I've trimmed down the amount of food as last section I came back with so much uneaten food.  No sense to carry extra weight.  Plan is to start hiking tomorrow around noon.  I will be leaving my car and getting a shuttle to start back where I left the trail at Tuckers Lane parking lot.    Sharon's Shuttle has been lined up for pick up and delivery.    This next outing will be about 33 miles before another break off the trail for the Flip Flop Festival.I look forward to gradually gaining more strength, stamina and losing weight.","None

Ole Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611476,"A late start due to shuttle couldn't pick me up till 1130.   Wild ride to Tuckers lane parking.   Sunny n warm.  Feeling strong.  Trail gradual ups n downs.  Lots of day hikers.  Some strange folks too.  Met 2 nice Military officers man n woman n talked to them a long time.   I'm a gabby jaws.  Not any views.  Trilliums in bloom n pretty, pink n white.  Stopped at 3pm  for late lunch at Manassas Gap shelter.  Seemed too soon to stop for night.  Pushed on to next shelter but it was 1/4 mile down hill so stealth camped  up by trail.  Water near by.   Couldn't get bear bag hung n line got stuck in tree. I cross tied best I could, not great but better than in my hammock.  
Picked a tough spot for camp, very wet so after tromping around it was very muddy.  As it seems to take me awhile to get organized setting up I am going to plan on stopping early for awhile.  Also couldn't get my bear bag hung properly and snagged the weight bag in a tree and ended up leaving it there.
Very scary last nite..around 1030 started hearing gun shots.   Then some crashing in woods coming towards me and more shots..  I didn't see any lights but got so scared.   I had my finger on the sos button of my GPS.  I almost grabbed my quilt and ran down to the shelter.  If the noise hadn't stopped when it did I would have. Surprisingly I managed some sleep.","Tuckers Lane Parking Lot

Ole Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611480,"April 21, Easter Sunday. Miles 8.4   Managed to get up around 645 so on the trail around 8 which is good for me so far.  Not a morning person.   I felt pretty good and had my morning drink with no dry heaves.   Had to keep Harley hooked so he wouldn't go back to the poop pile he discovered last night,  extra work fussing around him.   The morning was a beautiful section thru Big Meadow state park.  Lots of day hikers.  Feeling strong.  Crossed major road at Ashby Gap then up hill slog.  I'm still slow and winded going up hill.  Noticing my pack is heavy today.  Not sure if just tired or needs re-positioning.  Stopped at 3 PM to rest back as much as legs.  Glad to be here. 8.4 miles and I'm tired today.   Set up hammock and cold soaked dinner then laid down with Harley for pre dinner nap.    There were a couple Jack in pulpits beside my Hammock site which reminded me of mom and Shelly    This is the right spot for tonight.  Tomorrow I start what is called the ""roller coaster"". (13.5 miles of continuous ascents and descents).  Need lots of energy for that.  Stomach doing better today.    Two ladies I saw were out hiking from AT Women's group rolled in about an hr after me.  so nice and maybe I can hike with them for a few days.  4 thru hikers in late to shelter.  The ladies also told me that SNP ranger heard about the people not letting me into the shelter in the rain last week and guess its causing a stir... they are talking to everyone that you always make room.   Amazing how social media news travels up n down the trail.  Remember you always make room for one more in bad weather, no hiker left outside.","Whiskey Hollow Shelter

Ole Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611482,"Had great night last night and off for the day around 830.   Nice to have some other ladies to be watching for me.  Not walking step by step but they are watching out for me during the day.   Today entered the well known ""Roller Coaster"" section of the AT.   It is a section of 13.5 miles of ascent and descents .  No more of Virginia's switchbacks, now straight up and over each ridge line.  rocky and roots reminding me of hiking in Maine.   No views.   the trees are leafing out more, sunny and warm.   had several Thru hikers blow by, they said the coaster had slowed them down from 30 mile days to 20.   lol in my dreams.   I'm still struggling to slog out 8.   not a fun roller coaster, just my legs screaming and me gasping for air.   baby steps and lots of stops.   Nice to get to shelter around 430 and have my lady friends waiting.  Big black snake in trail waiting to greet me.  Guess he's living in the shelter so no mice there.  I'm happy to be in hammock.  By end of day it was just a group of women camping for night.  great sisterly comrades.   feeling tired tonight","Rod Hollow Shelter

Ole Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611484,"Today decided to stop with my new hiking buddies at the bears den hostel.  They are waiting resupply boxes and I have my car parked there for this section.  Phew rough day for me.   I really struggles with these 3 miles as we continue on the roller coaster.   Dry heaves all morning and several trips to the woods really zapped my energy.  Nothing in the tank so many stops to sit and rest.  Made it in 3 hrs and knew I was done.  We all drove together to local brewery, which had a great view, for lunch.  Only sandwiches so my craving for beef not met.   Feeling really sick so decided to drive into town for a hotel room and air conditioning hoping I can find something that will settle my stomach.  Still trying to figure out my stomach as I adjust to trail life.  It's hard to push when you feel like you are going to vomit and no eating then no energy.  Getting depressed with the way I'm feeling.   Had hoped at this point my body would be adjusting a bit better to the trail.   I don't need to push miles yet but I really want to feel better so I can eat and not feel like I'm fighting the flu....which I know I'm not, it is totally my body screaming ""what the heck are you doing to me"".   Hazards of being a plus sized woman I guess.","Sam Moore Shelter

Ole Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611485,"Hit the trails this am with my hiking buddies not feeling great still tho feel I can at least push on.  Had hoped some town food would get me back on track quick but guess my body is still rebelling on the stress.   I don't ache or have any muscle soreness, just sick to my stomach and low energy.  I have ordered some amino acid muscle enzymes from recommendation of other hikers to see if that will help my condition.   Nice sunny day today with finishing the Roller Coaster after 5 miles into the day.  A fair number of day hikers going up or down to ravens rock.   Harley made a new friend with a cute great Dane puppy.  The trail had a lot of blow downs after ravens rock which was a pain.  Not big trees but rather branches and debris in the trail from winter ice storm, that liked to grab your feet or scratch and slap your legs.    Got to the campsite which was .3 off the trail down the ridge around 4 pm.  Took my time hiking with stops and rests I still seem to need.   The care taker here was fabulous and brought me ginger ale where I wasn't feeling well.  Boy did that taste so good. True trail Magic,  a treat when not expecting it.  Settled my stomach enough I got in some tuna salad for dinner.    Tonight Go Girl and Data slept in the Hiker Hut which had bunks, no mattresses so you needed to have a pad.  Hammock hanging I don't carry a pad so I hung on one of the nice tent platforms available.  Only one other hiker in, a young man out for his first section hike.  This was a great spot with a power strip available from the caretaker to charge electronics needed.  There was a big screened in porch for sitting and relaxing if you wanted.  No fee but I left a $5 donation for such a great sot and to thank the caretaker for his gift of Ginger ale when I really needed something for my upset stomach.   After looking at the map we are hoping to push to Harpers Ferry tomorrow, a day earlier than planned.  There is no water between here and there except for a steep 1/4 mile downhill jaunt,  so makes sense to push on for refuel n hydration needs.","Bears Den Hostel

Ole Girl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611486,"Up with the ladies this am and on the trail around 830.   Looking at the terrain we decided to push to Harpers Ferry.  Tomorrow 90% chance of rain so be nice to be off trail.  Trail was very nice most of the day following a ridge line with a few gentle ups and downs.   A few short rocky sections that like to twist the ankles and stub the toes.   Stomach about the same. Did manage to eat half a bagel and cheese for breakfast.   Lunch was another little bit of cheese and crackers.  I talked with another hiker who said his daughter had the exact same symptoms and after 2 weeks she was back to normal hiker hunger.  There is hope for me.   Next few days I'll be hanging in Harpers Ferry for the hiker festival here.   Will be fun time and chance to meet some other hikers.    Biggest news of the day is I have a new Trail Name.   the ladies said Ole Girl just wasn't right for me after we've hiked together for a week.   My new name is ""True Grit"".  Said it better describes me.  I like it.","Blackburn Trail Center
