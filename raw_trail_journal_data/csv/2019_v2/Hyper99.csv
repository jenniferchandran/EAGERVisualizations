Hyper99,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608831,"My 20 year redo of the AT! I remember how my parents came down and started me off from here 20 years ago. How things change. Both of them are dead now, my father just last year in December. They loved shadowing me until their camper caught on fire outside of Franklin at the top of the pass by the AT and made the local paper's front page news.... ahhh so long ago. I too have changed. I was such a beast then. Now I feel far more fragile. One knee replaced, the other one also already qualifying for a replacement. Last time I too was challenged by the AT approach trail, but this time, while I was comfortably exhausted, my knees were on fire, screaming at every step at the end.  I gave myself permission to back out if I wanted to but just day one is not enough of a test. I made it a day hike and once we hit the Springer Mt parking lot I was happy for a ride to the bottom where I could sleep in a real bed and try to work out the aches and pains. Tomorrow? A two night stint to Woody gap and another ride to a clean dry bed. Yay, the privilege of old(der) age. Take it slow. Give myself more creature comforts and make a summer of it. Maybe I'll make it, maybe I won't. But at least today I made it to the top of Springer.

Hyper99,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608827,"My 20 year redo of the AT! This is to log that first mile of the AT from the top of Springer to the Springer parking lot as part of my AT hike  though of course the Approach Trail was the biggest part of today's journey. My companion for much of this hike will be my 2.5 year old Great Dane. She's very small for her age and still has big paws so most guess she's still a puppy. Definitely has puppy brain. Learning how to hike with a dog, (and she learning how to hike all day) has been a bit of a challenge. I'd say shes a good 10-20% handycap. She's constantly pulling on her leash either forward or back, or circling me causing me to do 360s to keep her leash in front of me. I've let her off the leash on occasion but there are alot of people hiking the approach trail so not the best plan. Besides she needs to get used to it for Shenandoah. I felt I was being passed by pretty much everyone today and I passed no one. All good. I promised myself to be good to myself and take all the time I need. Sleeping in a real bed tonight!!! Yes!

Hyper99,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608830,"Another gorgeous day. A good nights rest a little leg massage and two Aleve seemed to make a big difference. Took two more this morning just to have them on board if I was going to re-experience the knee pains I had from yesterday.  My two day goal is Woody Gap where I can get another trail rescue to a clean bed so two tens would be a good goal, but its supposed to rain much of tomorrow so a few extra miles today would be a bonus. I think the terrain was a bit easier today and another thing I remembered was to bring my hiking poles. They helped me significantly soften the impact of each step going either up or down steeper inclines. I'd like to say that was the difference. My goal had been Justice Creek at 14.4 but had a feeling that was too far. Remembering back to 20 years ago I realized I made it all the way to Gooch Gap Shelter at mile 15.7 but this time I was happy to dry camp at the top of Cooper Mountain (AT mile 11.6). The Hawk shelter was beyond packed with over 30 hikers and 4 dogs by 3PM. I didn't think I could make it the next 6 miles to Justice (the next water supply) so I had my ""dinner"" early and packed enough water to dry camp along the way. This was also a test of the dog. Leila had never camped and been outdoors overnight so other then learning how to hike, this overnighter would be quite an experience for her.

Hyper99,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608843,"I'm happy that the promised rain didn't start as early in the morning as had been predicted. Cooper Mountain was a great though dry camp site. It was at the top of the mountain and I was worried about pre storm wind, but I picked a fairly sheltered spot and the wind was not bad so a great stop all in all. Better than having stayed at Hawk Mt Shelter (mile 8.1) with its large crowds. As I met a few hikers from there though out the day I learned there was quite a bit of drama for much of the night. People on cell phones much of the night. People getting into arguments and storming off. Glad I missed the fun. I had my own drama.  Leila had never gone camping before so I wondered how this tenting thing would go. It went about as I expected, badly. She was a bit freaked and uncomfortable. Good thing I left my tent screen unzipped as she bolted up and barreled through it when she heard something. More than a couple of times in the night she headed out to bark at some imagined threat. I'm wondering what she would do if she encountered a bear. I'm not sure what I should do. She's so big I can't really control her if she's on that kind of mission. Neither of us got a good night sleep. I was encouraged however to see the moon through much of the night thinking we'd have a weather reprieve. We did. Happy to make it to Gooch Shelter without rain. Fun to meet some of the hikers there. Named Green Slouch and maybe Tater. Met Chopstix (2016) and Q-Tip. Did some Geocaching along the way! Shhh! And then the rains began. It was about 2 miles to Woody Gap. I remembered how much my Leila girl hates rain and realized I had no rain cover for her pack. Things to take care of for next time. That last stretch was also another small test for us as a hiking pair. The best news of all was that my knees have been only whispering their pain, not at all like day one. This I can live with. I'm sore and tired but not in too much pain. As the rain came pouring down we made it to the warm dry car. Ahhh for the want of a nice warm shower and a hot meal. Happy happy.

Hyper99,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608929,"Oh yes, I am so spoiled!  My partner has an RV and is shadowing me especially closely these early miles. I got to sleep in a real bed without rain. This also involved a real cooked meal a shower and heat! Today will be another slack packing day where I will be back at the RV for dinner. So sweet! I feel sorry for the poor saps stuck out there in the storm last night. It was pretty rough. The morning was partly sunny in the valleys but the clouds were stubbornly hanging on to the ridge line. Rain was forecasted for the evening again though. 
Blood Mountain was on the menu today and it was my boggy man experience from the first time. I now remember that 20 yrs ago I had done 16 miles on my second day and wanted to reach Neels Gap by the end of day three. This time I would be reaching it at the end of day four. But that last time exhausted me and also taught me my most memorable hiking lesson. 20 years ago hydration systems as well as ultralite packs and equipment were barely on the scene. If I wanted to get a drink of water or food I would have to take my pack off and it was pretty heavy so not something I did much. Further I had an old hiking practice where I would reward myself with a snack or meal once I reached some goal, say the top of a mountain or so. But I would always miscalculate and where I thought I would reach that mountain top by noon, I might only reach it by 3. Thus I would go too long without eating or drinking. This problem was finally compounded by my lack of digestive feedback. Normally, when I'm hungry my stomach would let me know. I have an internal dinner bell that gets quite demanding. It had just stopped. So I didn't know I was hungry. Some speedy hiker passed me and said,""Warm bed, hot shower 3 miles ahead, warm bed hot shower 3 miles ahead"" but I was acting like I was drunk, stumbling and weaving as I walked. Something was wrong. I knew 3 miles was far more than I could manage. There was a shelter nearby and I pulled in. It was only 3PM. Slowly I made myself a big meal. Then I laid out my sleeping bag and crawled in. 45 min later I woke up feeling like I had slept all night! Top on the list of changes was a hydration system. Next was changing my eating strategy. When hiking I now eat by the clock, Snack at 10, lunch at 12, snack at 2, drink, drink, drink. Blood Mountain was a cake walk today. Shorter hiking distances and properly fed and watered made all the difference. It was also sunny and beautiful with great views when I was there. There were perhaps 8-10 other thru hikers at the peak shelter so we shareds some fun banter. Trail names I heard were Polar bear, Almost There, River... (forgot) but the best was the story behind the newly minted trail name Thunder Buddy. He had been hiking yesterday and suddenly the skies let loose with some fierce rain and thunder. He ran over to the nearest standing tent and asked the occupant if he could duck in. I guess it was a very small tent and both men were of pretty good size, thus the name Thunder Buddy was born. Perfect, Just where a hiking trail name should come from. 
Made it in great time to Neels Gap where there is an old CCC building turned hiker hostel, outfitter and postal service. For most hikers this is the first time they get contact with the real world again and you could see they were happy. My partner brought up a little Trail Magic and we all had fun eating pie. While the views at the top of Blood Mountain were beautiful, in less than half an hour of our arrival it started raining again. So happy to be off the mountain as the descent had alot of ledges which would be treacherous in the rain. The rain became quite intense for a couple of hours. More hikers arrived but the hostel was full and the next campsite was another 1.6 miles away. They looked quite forlorn in the building's breezeway hoping for a break in the weather which did not come. Another day on the trail.

Hyper99,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609150,"Full pack today as the distance to the next road crossing is more than I can hike in a day. Whoo! That extra 20 lbs above my day pack weight was noticeable. I'm slower. Leila carried her pack as well as we have our second overnight tenting experience. My plan was to get to Unicoi Gap at mile marker 52.5 in two hiking days where we'd meet Stan again, keeping with my 10 miles per day goal. I've been feeling stronger everyday and though I had targeted Low Gap shelter at mile marker 42.8, I was hoping to make it a bit further. The hiking weather was again fantastic and terrain tolerable and I have been slowly getting my hiking stride back so I was pleased with my progress. Leila is also becoming a better hiking partner though tended to follow so close behind me she often stepped on the back of my shoes or, especially when going downhill, butted the back of my pack in such a way that it launched me forward a bit. Good thing I have hiking poles (sticks) so I didn't find myself face first down the hill! I readjusted my goal to the Poplar Stamp Gap at mile marker 44.3 and as it looked like another dry tent site so I needed a water plan. As before I figured I'd stop to eat dinner at the Low Gap shelter then hike the last mile or so to set up camp. There was quite a crowd at the shelter as well as a number of tenters nearby. It was hard to leave and getting later but I wanted to get in earlier to Unicoi so wanted to move on. I was in for a happy surprise. The trail out of Low Gap was an old graded mountain road. That was VERY easy walking! I flew up the hill at much better than normal hiking speed. Since this site was on the map I assumed I would find other campers there. In total there were 6 of us. A father and son (forgot their names), A german hiker Alex, Ethan, Eliza and myself. While I rarely make campfires, the group was up for it and we had a great time chit-chatting around the fire. Leila still needed to play guard dog however and stood guard for a few more hours before I could coax her in to sleep.

Hyper99,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609151,"That beautiful graded old roadbed continued out of Poplar Gap for another few miles and the hiking was fast and easy. Wow. If the whole hike could be this smooth, but eventually we were back to a more traditional hiking trail. I was far ahead of schedule so started looking at the next section, Unicoi to Dick's Gap. It still seemed more than I could do in a day (mile 52 to 69) but since I was so early perhaps I would just move on. I met Stan at Unicoi Gap at 1PM, plenty of time to hike a few more miles making Dicks Gap and mile 69 reachable in one more day. Unicoi also had another surprise, a ""hiker feed"" was taking place. I had never heard the term before but I guess its now more common. Some group sets up food for hikers. In this case it was a local baptist church offering burgers, chips, fruit, cookies, bibles, advice and more. I partook of the food and enjoyed the camaraderie of some of the other hikers that had stopped. It was good to sit for a bit before moving on especially looking at the hill we had to climb right out of the gap. Woof! To increase my speed for the next section I asked Stan to take pup. The short goal was Indian Grave Gap, up and down 1000 ft in three miles, the longer goal was Tray Mt shelter adding another 1000 ft elevation in another 3 miles. Did it!. Great spot, great views, lots of hikers again but I managed to snag a spot in the shelter for a quicker morning getaway.

Stan had found a nearby winery offering a tapas and live music event for the evening. If I could make it down by three we could make it. There's some motivation. I also promised myself a zero day tomorrow (no mileage). I don't want to stop as the weather is projected to be beautiful and I hate to waste a sunny day to sit around, but it's been 7 days of hiking and I can feel my body getting worn down. Everything is sore. I need to recover a bit. On the knee front, the new knee has been getting stronger, but the old knee is starting to tweek with more pain, especially on the downhills. In the beginning my old knee was doing extra duty to make up for the weaknesses of the new one. Now the reverse is starting to happen. I know I need to take the break. Since Tray Mt is the second highest peak in Georgia the net elevation change was all downhill. One 1000 foot climb up Kelly's Knob and we were into the Gap. I was also able to slide out of the shelter by 7:15 and was the first one on the trail this morning. Combining an early start with my improved strength I was happy to see the end of my hiking day at 1PM. As to the tapas, it was great but I was so tired I didn't even want to go. Just let me get clean, slide me into bed, get my feet up and sleep! We'll sort it all out tomorrow!

Ah, to lay down and get my feet up above my heart.  On the trail I put my backpack under my legs to elevate my feet at night and bring down the throbbing and any swelling in both feet or knees. Here I enjoyed a pillow. No blisters yet and I hope that stays that way. I was happy to get cleaned up, rest my body and eat real food. I have been eating well on the trail so far keeping up with my Nutritarian diet goals.  Most of that has been possible because of the amount of food I prepped before starting the trail. Alot of my food doesn't look that appetizing because it doesn't have the commercial color dyes but tastes just fine. This stop has also exposed how my diet change has improved my choices. 20 years ago my routine was a quart of OJ, a quart of milk and the greasiest burger I could find, this time we headed for the grocery store that had a beautiful salad bar and I piled it high. It was just as satisfying. I hear it on the trail and have heard it much of my athletic life: eat more protein, you need it to compete. Now I believe: eat more nutrients - greens, nuts, seeds, legumes. I feel so much better.","Dick's Gap

Hyper99,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609396,"Rained hard last night. I mean RAINED HARD!!! Thunder, lighting rocked the RV. I was so happy to be under cover. Avoiding this storm hadn't been my intention but it was sure good timing. Headed out before 8 to a damp cool morning. My last 7 miles in GA. Good bye pecan pie and sweet tea (neither of which I had had anyway, Georgia just reminds me of those things). Somehow its a milestone to say good bye to the first state of the trail. The trail maintainers along this section were outstanding. I met 4 of them and their care and attention to both the trail and structures as well as the passing hikers, was phenomenal. Kudos!!! Met and loosely hiked with two father/son pairs and we all crossed into NC together and took plenty of pictures of each other. My plan was a 3 day 41 mile stretch to Franklin NC Rt 64 so I needed to do close to 13-14 per day, however about mid day things really started changing. A cold front was moving in after that rain and it was starting to bite. Everyone else was pulling into Muskrat Creek Shelter and I wanted to share the company. I'd try to fit the extra miles into another day. Brrr it got cold. I'm told that at a lower elevation than us (4567 ft) it was only 15 degrees! We made a fire but even that was not enough and died down quickly. Turns out that in total we had five father/son pairs at this location. NC feels different. The shelters are different, or perhaps its just the cold introduction.

Hyper99,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609401,"Yikes! Getting up was not easy. Cold cold cold. I had every stitch of clothes on I had brought. Sleeping bag not warm enough. Poor Leila was suffering too. I tried hard to keep her on her sleeping pad (adds insulation from the ground) and wrapped in her blanket as well opening my sleeping bag to pull her in for extra shared heat. She was unfortunately waking up to hack some irritant out of her lungs multiple time during the night and that made bundling back into bed tough. No one slept well. 
Morning happened. In this situation I really know only one way to get warm. Start walking. The time, energy and cold exposure it would take to make a hot beverage would more than cancel out any benefit. I also had extra miles to pull. I grabbed my stuff as quickly as possible and was moving, stumbling would better describe it. Hoarfrost was everywhere, all the mud and puddles were frozen, icicles were hanging off the springs. I didn't need to go fast, just move. Sure enough an hour or so later I was feeling better. I stopped for my breakfast another hour after that.
I targeted Betty Creek tent site as my goal today but I knew that would be ambitious. Over 16 miles out with Standing Indian Mountain ahead. It is the highest peak in the Southern Nantahala forest standing over 5650 ft. Nothing to do but keep walking. It turned out that Standing Indian Mountain was an easy climb. As earlier, the mountain had once had a road to the top, so the walk had a smooth grade and we were quickly to the top. I took the time to take the side trail to the top and was not at all disappointed. Beautiful. Down was a bit more challenging but all around an easy time. After that it was in and out of creeks and valleys for what seemed forever. Carter Gap Shelter at mile 93.5 was a possibility but it just wasn't far enough. I passed by Carter around 3 pm so still plenty of time before dark, I figured I could make it to Betty. As I descended into Betty my knees started speaking loudly again. You might thing I'd be proud to have my longest mileage day yet, but I'm not. I need to take better care. This is not sustainable. I see some of the young ones sweep by me on the trail but know that simply not an option for me. 
Its another cold night below freezing but nothing close to yesterday. Found my dinner shy of calories and was supplemented by others. Met some fun new people as well as caught up with a few (Audible, Hot Sauce and friends). Found two other people from NH.","Muskrat Creek Shelter

Hyper99,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609408,"Leila and I had another rough night. She wasn't hacking tonight but she seemed even colder than last night. She was often shivering. I hadn't planned on a coat for her but I had brought an extra layer of mine for her. It worked amazingly well but still not enough to stave off the night time cold. After hours of trying I finely got her to tuck into my sleeping bag with her back so I could cover her with a big section of it. We finally got to sleep. Its the first time I woke up to full light. It was only 8AM but later than we had been getting up. It was definitely not as cold as yesterday, but I did like yesterday's strategy and employed it again today, just pack up and move. There were three hills and 12ish miles to cover so I didn't have to stress so much. The first was Mt Albert (5213 ft) with a fire tower, As I get closer I notice the snowflakes. By golly! Its snowing! I also had some information on a stand of American Chestnut trees in the area that I was hoping to look at. They used to comprise somewhere between 25-60% of all the trees in the Appalachian Mountains and were wiped out by an Asian blight back in the early 1900s. Can you imagine a forest completely different from the one we know today? Turns out there are still a number of stands that try to regrow throughout these mountains. They grow enough to throw seeds or grow shoots from their roots. They all eventually catch the blight themselves but live long enough to procreate, so persist. I found the story fascinating and went to take a look. By the time we got to the fire tower snow had actually accumulated a bit. It was fun and not threatening at all. The sun came out while touring the tower. Then it was off to the smaller two elevation climbs before the decent to Winding Stair Gap. Met a woman doing trail magic offering hard boiled eggs and carrots. Leila got my egg and I grabbed some carrots. First time I saw Leila flagging today. She has been such a trouper, really built for this. Her big feet and long legs making all of this look like a walk in the park. But in the end she stopped to lie down a few times. Could be the cold and lack of sleep more than just the terrain that she seems to float over. But tonight is another RV night so quick to the finish for a shower, a real meal and warm bed.

Hyper99,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609543,"Got off the trail last night and got treated to a shower, real food and a bed in that order. I'm trying to time my hikes around upcoming rain so had plans to get out early for the next two day section (26 mi) to Nantahala (Nan-Ta-Hal-La) Outdoor Center. But I woke up just too achy to hustle out the door. I could either get a ride to the trail before 9am or after noon. Feeling my bones, I opted for after noon and planned instead on 2.5 days getting me caught in a predicted Friday rain storm.  It turned out the choice was a good one. 
I got to go into town to visit the local AT hiker hostel and outfitter. Three Eagles in town is by and for hikers, so it has the right stuff and they're not over charging. I learned that Top of Georgia by Dick's Creek Gap near Hiawassee GA was charging a surcharge for this time of year asking $45 a night for a bunk! Franklin NC was only $20. This is also the kind of place you want to get your gear because they will sell you the right stuff and help you decide what you need as well as what you don't. As an entire town Franklin has embraced the AT and even offer a discount city shuttle service from the trail crossing into town. Other services are all within walking distance. A town's welcome mat does change behavior patterns. Hikers could be seen everywhere. Three Eagles also had a sign out which caught my attention identifying it as Baltimore Jack's Place. Was it the BJ I knew? Yes it was! BJ was a somewhat ledgendary AT hiker who hiked the trail 9 times and was an irascible old prankster. He died just a year or so ago and I had had the pleasure of hiking with him 20 years ago. We started swapping BJ stories and the morning just flew by.  
Soon it was time to go as I didn't want to waste the whole of a beautiful sunny hiking day. I was on the trail before one pm and hoped to put in as much mileage as possible to decrease my Friday rain exposure. What I wasn't expecting was the veritable heat wave. While yesterday I had been snowed on, today I wished I was wearing shorts. Leila was panting behind me. I was eating the miles faster than I had even hoped. Nantahala was at mile marker 136 and I was hoping to reach mile 113 or 115, but with town food in me and a beautiful day I kept pushing. Wayah Bald (Balds are mountains in this area that naturally have grasses on the top) became my goal. It would be a great place for a sunset. It wasn't even sunset and I was there. Just one more mile below at mile 120 and I'd be at a shelter/tenting area. Sweet! I can still make Nantahala in two days! 16 tomorrow, much of it downhill would be doable to avoid getting wet. But while I'm doing fine I'm worried. Leila is not. She seems listless. She's constantly leaving the trail to hide in shade and to lay down which she hasn't done until now. Something is off. Once we get to our overnight she turns her nose at food. Even her favorite treats cause no interest. This is a problem and I am alarmed. She will not make 16 miles in this condition. I'm already considering my options. It was a surprise to me but the top of Wayah Bald has road access with an ADA path and bathrooms as well as a picnic area. Its one mile behind me and over 1000 ft up but if I need an exit point I had it to consider. Lets see what tomorrow brings.

Hyper99,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609556,"All night I fret over the dog. She's not sleeping well. She is shivering. It's not even a very cold night. I consider my options. If she needs to be carried I'm going to struggle. She's just under 100 lbs and that 1000 ft climb back to the top of Wayah Bald is going to be close to impossible. Perhaps I could recruit another hiker to help. I figured in the worst case I would simply leave all my gear so I could get her up there. Then there was a ride. Thankfully I did have phone signal where I was (we have it about 1/2 the time mostly on mountain tops but not usually in valleys) so would be able to call for help. The deciding factor was how she would be in the morning. My biggest concern, would she eat? 
And the answer was no. She was, however, able to walk on her own. I took all she was carrying and strapped her empty pack on her. Then I packed all my and her things and we headed up. She did reasonably well with only a little prodding but she was clearly still listless. After a bit of a wait, Stan arrived to take us down. Amusingly, while I was waiting, another truck showed up with both a Lyft and Uber sticker and here he was dropping off a day hiker. Yes, for $25 Matt drives hikers up here. Again, the friendliness of Franklin. Google puts the one way drive at 45 minutes. 
Leila is not in urgent distress but still her behavior is not right. I book an appointment with Noahs Ark Animal Hospital based on Matt's recommendation. Here we are in Franklin again out of sorts and restless. I wanted to be hiking to Nantahala today and Stan was going to be on the move again but now we're both just waiting for Leila's appointment. The day would have been a great hiking day but it as it wears on it gets darker with tomorrow's impending storm. Then another surprise out of left field to brighten the day, a highly trained C.I.A. french chef decided to set up a true french bistro here, which is now one of the best rated restaurants in NC. This is breaking my diet habits but oh la la! Cafe Rel was outstanding! Then on to the vet. Again, I'm so lucky. The vet has two Great Danes of his own so knows the idiosyncrasies of the breed and he'd been an Iditerod sled dog race competitor so also understood the special needs of a dog hiking the AT. He had great people skills and gave us his time. Thankfully anything serious was ruled out and both fortunately and unfortunately he really had no advice to give. We addressed some possibilities and for now are just going to give her some R&R time. No hiking dog for a while. Often times, hiking the AT is hiking with a series of unexpected delays, this was one of them. Getting back on can be the challenge.
Now back to hiking... What to do tomorrow? Most of the storm is supposed to pass in the night and taper off by 11am. I have a 17 mile stretch. I'm thinking I'm going to make a run for it. Without my full pack and the dog I'm hoping if I start around 9-10 I can fly the distance fairly fast. While my joints are not liking miles, yesterday really showed me my strength is improving quite well. I did 11 miles with full pack and a listless dog in an afternoon. The joints will be much happier without the excess weight so regardless of the rain that's the plan.

Even with only a day pack I knew this would be a long day. I felt great until the great decent that began at mile 130. The rain stopped as predicted but it stayed foggy until late afternoon. I was very happy that by the time I reached the Wesser Bald fire tower things had cleared enough that we could catch a view before the next cloud washed over us. Then the six mile decent began. You don't really realize how high you are until you come down. From the top of Wesser all the mountains around looked like small hills nearby, but as we dropped deeper and deeper into the valley, the mountains appeared far larger and more ominous. We dropped over 3000 ft with sometimes difficult terrain only to know we'd have to climb it all again tomorrow when going up the other side of the valley. I met and hiked with a young Swiss woman for a portion of the day. She has taken a sabbatical from work for the summer to hike the AT. It was fun talking with her about her home. An older couple ""Skip and Linda 148"" were also moving along. The 148 stands for their combined age. Some people are on a mission already doing more than 20 miles per day. I see them only briefly before they disappear. Some, like Skip and Linda manage 5-7 miles per day and have a wonderful and different AT experience. It is likely I won't see them again as well. And then there are those that somewhat match your own speed. The trail can be a very social place as equal paced AT hikers form a moving community. You tend to see the same people for periods of time and catch up or fall behind as your own speed dictates. 
The final decent is always exciting. You hear the river, the cars and finally you see the road and buildings through the trees. I was happy to see Leila waiting for me at the road crossing. Her tail was wagging and she showed much more energy than the day before. NOC stand for Nantahala Outdoor Center. This place as grown into quite a large facility for everything from tubing and kayaking to corporate retreats. There was a kayak race course as you see in the Olympics set up in the river. I reached to bottom around 6PM. We didn't see anyone out there so late in the day, but dinner at the associated restaurant overlooking the river was great. The place was crawling with hikers. Nearly a dozen packs were parked outside like motorcycles at a rally, and through the window I could spot another dozen or so hikers lounging across the river at a large fire pit. They all were going to have a good time tonight. I was just heading for bed. Not sure how my legs will feel in the morning when we have 6-7 miles of ascent to get to the top of Cheoah Bald.  This next section is 30 miles but I'm planning for 2.5 days to reach my next town destination - Fontana Dam and the beginning of the Smokies. The predict 100% chance rain on the third day but as today once again reminded me, this many miles is too much for the knees and with this long climb ahead I'm planning on 11, then 12 then the rest on Friday.

Hyper99,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609931,"NOC and up. Five plus hours of up. Much of it had a reasonable grade with only a few sections of challenging rocks or steps. The morning was foggy and the peaks were enshrouded in clouds, but it was slowly clearing as we hiked. Thankfully no rain expected. I say we today because there seemed to be about 20+ of us hiking loosely together. It you stopped for a moment someone would pass. Five minutes later you would pass them again as they took a break. It was a long slow game of leap frog. I had wanted to make it to the top before lunch but I finally couldn't wait that long. The same was true for pretty much everyone else so there was alot of passing and mingling going on. Had some great talks with some of my co-through hikers. The arrival at the peak was exciting. It was clear and you could see the sky open up above. The last few steps were very steep in the trees but just above was a beautiful grassy clearing. This was Cheoah Bald, another bald, another grassy mountain top over 5000 ft. It was very satisfying. This was the big challenge of the day, now for the downhill. A few more ups and downs along the way but nothing outstanding.
I like most of this group has planned to make it to the tent site at mile marker 147 so it would be crowded there. On the way up I had been chatting with Bob who was slack packing to Stechoah Gap at mile 150. Where he'd hired someone to bring him and another hiker back to NOC for the night. I had a place to stay in Fontana Dam 15 miles ahead and nothing behind but was willing to  go if it could mean avoiding the rain and mud expected Friday. It would mean a real meal and a grocery stop. It also meant offering some cover for the other younger female hiker who I could tell was a bit uncomfortable with Bob. I was hiking fully loaded because I had planned to hike through but I made the extra miles. Happy to make it to the road and the ride. We drove to Robbinsville, hit the Ingles Grocery store and happy to find plenty of fresh fruit and veggies, then found El Pacifico mexican restaurant for dinner. I had tried to reach Stan by phone/text but after numerous unsuccessful efforts we finally let it go. 
By the time we made it back to NOC the place was already shut down for the evening

The weather was a little rainy to start but turned out to even have a few views as the day wore on. Amazing ridge walking with absolutely luminescent moss growing on the branches of trees. I ran into a woman going by the name of Raindancer. She was excited to see me as she also hiked in 1999. Unfortunately I did not remember her, nor did she I, but we could come up with a number of people we knew in common. Kind of fun. Then I also ran into the swiss woman again. We hiked together for the last bit. Once again, like dropping into NOC, the decent seemed to take forever. My knees were crying by the time we finally hit the bottom. What made it more tantalizing was that we could see the dam from up above but it just didn't seem like we could get there. There was no phone signal when we reached the road but a convenient snack structure had a landline with a note explaining that picking up the phone would connect us to the Fontana Village Resort and a shuttle ride. Another hiker popped out of the woods and his first question was what was the time. He desperately wanted to get to the General Store before 5 so he could buy him and his buddies a 12 pack. Haha.

I saw on the sign it had been built by another of my 1999 hiking mates - Papa Smurf. I knew there had been a Fontana Hilton before but don't have any memory of it.

I had forgotten that these trails were designed for horses so the grade is far easier than some of the rock scrambles we've been dealing with. The weather was stellar as was the track. I slacked the side trail to the fire tower and it was so worth it. Loved the views from the top. Once at the tower the trail became a ridge walk popping up and down the rest of the day. By mile 175 we reached an area where small flowers resembling strawberries appeared. Leaves were different though. They were so plentiful they looked like snow. I was thinking the song strawberry fields forever. It was a park like setting and it lasted for hours. Over 6 miles of a white flowery carpet. Got to the first shelter where I had thought to stay by 2 pm. Decided to do the extra 3 miles to the next shelter- Russell Field shelter mile 180. Thought of even going to the next, another 2.9 but this was a good crowd and the shelter had lots of room. Only 7 of us in a space for 16. Doc Griz. Caboose. Boy Scout, Pop Tart, Sunshine, and me. Two more showed at 8pm - a couple. Again, don't want to waste the beautiful weather. I can do shorter sections in the rain. Ridge hiking is nice because the ups and downs are usu short. You don't really notice you're going up more than down slowly rising to Clingmans Dome over 6000 ft. I won't make over the dome tomorrow but plan to be in spitting distance at me 195 tomorrow.

It was also reasonably warm. While rain wasn't predicted for today it was predicted 3am through 11am tomorrow. Got out by 730 you could feel the storm coming. Palpable. Even the cute little strawberry type flowers were closed up tight. The 1st 3 mi weren't bad but then the ridge running got tough. Water runs down the trail washing it out and leaving loose rocks on a steep grade. Finally reached Thunder mountain and found a ham radio operator working on a summits on the air challenge. Was fun to talk to him. The 5 miles to Derricks Knob shelter were tough but got there and found the trio still eating lunch. Scout told me the next 5 miles weren't as hard. Good to know. He was right. Planned to stay at Siler Bald shelter. Mile 195 but the boys had moved on and the next shelter was only 1.7 further. Worth it to move on before the storm. Was fun to suddenly reach the elevation for spruce trees. Loved the sudden change. Trees all on North side of hill for a bit until I got a little higher. The strawberry fields made it all the way to the pine forest. Amazing. Good to see the pine borers still hadn't gotten them all. Too bad i couldn't do Clingmans before the rain. Sad but seen it before. Arrived at 4:30 and only the trio was there. Thought that might be it for the night. Then people kept arriving all the way till 8 pm
 We suddenly had a full house with 3 ppl camping as well. 5 section hikers arrived and about 10 through hikers in total. Glad these are dbl decker shelters so more of us can have cover. The best spring too. Very near the shelter and clean water straight from the ground. Would trust not to filter but I did anyway. This one has a privy too where the Russell field did not.

The to top of Clingman's Dome was beautiful but foggy windy and rainy. I managed to climb to the top of the tower and found myself blown around quite significantly. It was a struggle while it wasn't terrifically cold it was very hard on my carpal tunnel. Both hands stopped functioning very well which made my descent very slow. Also because we didn't go that route to the parking area I missed out on the gift shop, heat, dry, bathrooms and any good treats that might have been available there. Its the anticipation thwarted that makes it more disappointing. While I only did 13 miles today it was a very wet hard slog. Shoes and feet got soaked as I stepped into puddles and was not really able to use my hands. As my hands got warmer they functioned better so hopefully that will not always be a problem. It was wonderful to come out at the parking lot by Newfound Gap. I did not know what to expect there but a large parking full with many people was not what I had in mind. All but one of the through hikers from Dbl Spring Gap shelter headed into Gatlinburg with one of the many available shuttles but I chose to push on. The saddest discovery from the parking lot was that as I looked back to the Dome, the mountain top was clear. Sigh. The only time it had been clouded over in the last 3 days was the few hours I had been there. Ah well. Another day will come. Tonight was another busy shelter night. Met some new interesting characters, The Wiz, Carver, Slim were all happy to smoke some weed and play some batchy ball with the Minnesota gang.

Today was the most beautiful section I've hiked so far truly ridge walking where it dropped down a lot on both sides. Great view much of the day even with the clouds. Terrain was pretty steady too. Charlies Bunion was the highlight of the day. Got to tri corners around 3 and wanted to continue hiking but it was just too far to push the next shelter 7.8 miles away. I thought too everyone from the Ice Water shelter would end up here too simply because of the distance. Sure enough. This one was too close and the next one was that little bit too far. Then add to that a bunch of section hikers from elsewhere and we were packed. Supposedly bad weather tomorrow. Hail, potential snow and gale winds 70 mph threatened so we're all packing into the shelter like sardines a bit fearful of what will come. The shelter is technically designed for 12, but we had 21 with 15 camping thats how busy it was. One fast crew who had only been on trail for 12 days from Springer planned an early morning getaway to try to beat as much of the weather as possible. Many of the rest of us thought what was a good idea as well so we went to sleep with much anticipation. The temps were expected to drop through the day with accumlated snow by evening. Now in hindsight I wish I had gone on for the next shelter even if I would have arrived at dark. Ah well.

Already the wind had been howling for a while and we'd had a few rain bursts prattling on our tin roof. Everyone was on edge. I also got up and started prepping. I counted 10 more shadows moving around packing to leave as well. It was an interesting play of dancing quiet shapes moving through everyone's red headlamps. I hoped I had grabbed everything but it was hard to do a thorough check in the dark. It was 6:45AM as I walked away. Just enough light to not need a headlamp. It wasn't raining at the moment but every once in a while we'd get a few spurts. The wind however just kept amping up. There were a few more ridge walks and you really had to lean into the wind to stay on trail. I was happy when I finally dropped below the ridge. The next shelter sure had been a long haul and today I was glad I had waited to reach it today. I would have missed some of the amazing views I got this morning and the wind was an experience worth having so all good. But at mile 7 of the day the rain started getting serious. I was well prepared so happily my pack and torso were dry. Everything from the knees down I sacrificed to the weather. Finally I reached the sign to Mt Cammerer and saw it was .6 off the trail. It was raining, cloudy, I still had far to go so the prospect of heading out there seemed unattractive, but hey, it was a virtual geocache and I had planned it. OK out we go. As I got closer suddenly everything changed. The sun appeared! Such a surprise. I got out to the end and was amazed. Even the approach reminded me of the ocean not the mountains. It also looked more like a lighthouse than a fire tower. In fact its not even known as a fire tower but a lookout. It was explained on the nearby sign that the difference between a fire tower and fire lookout is that one is built on the ground and only one or two stories while the other is a tall ironwork tower many feet in the air. It just so happened that another hiker (section hiker) was out there as well. So exciting to suddenly see the sun after the slop we'd been walking through. Then low and behold! A rainbow! A big one. Then briefly it was a double rainbow! Photos taken. What was downright amazing was that after leaving, the rain began again, now twice at hard as before. It rained hard for another few hours as I slowly descended into the valley. Only once reaching the valley floor did the sun appear again. Suddenly I could see the green leaves of the valley trees. It had seemed that every time spring seemed nearby we ascended another 1000 feet in elevation, but now we are about the embrace spring with a vengeance. The altitude and the Smokies are now over.

It is my first day hiking with Leila again as she was not allowed to join me in the smokies. She was very rambunctious in the beginning but as the day wore on she lost that bounce. While I had spent 7 more days getting in better physical condition she had been lounging. Now the cost of that vacation was visible. It was a long but consistant climb out of the valley. I notice that a similar descent seems to take longer thsn the climb. Snowbird peak (4200) was our first major peak of the day. Another bald but this one had some sort of installation on the top that looked a bit other worldly and hummed ominously with high voltage I did not go near to check it out. The trail then descended unto a beautiful gap that enticed me to spend the entire day. The nearby shelter did not deter from the beauty. The Minnesota thru hikers caught up with me here. I pressed on through a series of lumps and bumps. Two section hikers chose to stop at an uncomfortable camping site at about the 251 mile mark, but with the others, I chose the next steep incline and following ups and downs as Max Patch was the lure for the day. It is a monster sized bald that thru hikers often stealth camp at. Before we reach the bald however is a surprise. A previous thru hiker, trail name Peach, had set up a hiker feed at the base of Max Patch. I didn't recall that it was possible to drive here, but now it was a popular locals hang out. A full parking lot was at the base of the bald. I, the Minnesota crew and a few more section and thru hikers enjoyed Peach's gift. I felt sorry for the two hikers who had stayed behind. There were hot dogs, hamburgers, soda, juice, beer, wine, fruit, cookies, chairs and more. She even brought toilet paper. The boys were enthralled. I finally hiked on thinking I wanted to make the shelter 2 mi beyond Max Patch but the group plan was to hike the 0.8 to the top, camp and watch the sunset. Once there I knew it was right to stay. While for distance planning purposes going further was ideal, the Max Patch experience couldn't be denied. A local college out reach group of perhaps 20 and other random picnickers were enjoying the park like setting. As what was promising to be a beautiful sunset approached, more locals with blankets and wine or beer drove up to enjoy the experience. We also now had perhaps 15-20 thru hikers tents scattered on the bald and another few dozen transient visitors. It was a festive scene with children and dogs, camp fires, beers and smores. The wind was persistant but the sunset was worth it.

As yesterday's sunset was spectacular, this morning's sunrise was equally impressive. Leila had crashed for an hour or so when we had arrived yesterday but the she got her second wind. She spent the evening working the crowd successfully begging food from everyone.  She finally came to bed as it was getting cold in the persistant wind. She then however scared me a bit later as she got up and disappeared for over an hour or more. The large waxing moon made night vision fairly easy on the bald but I had no idea where to look. I went back to bed trusting she'd return and was happy when she did. I was just like a mother wondering where her baby had gone. Of course at 6:30 AM when everyone is out to watch the sunrise and the thru hikers are striking their tents and repacking their packs, my slug-a-bed is not interested in getting up. Sorry girl. Time to go. Sunrise done and now some extra miles to put in. The two big peaks today were Walnut and Bluff mountains once we completed the long 5 mile descent off of Max Patch. The Roaring Fork shelter i had wanted to stay at was a dark rude little structure and i was so glad i didn't stay there. The weather deteriorated through out the day as expected but it was still a great hiking day with hazy sun persisting to its end. Walnut (4300) was another bald with another older unfriendly looking shelter. Bluff (4600), larger than Walnut, seemed to go both up and down forever but both peaks offered up the white flowered carpet floors that we had seen in the Smokies. Very beautiful. Now that we are again at lower altitudes we are far more often flirting with spring. More varities of flowers are popping up everywhere. The dogwoods are also in blume and the trees are starting to leaf. We can still see the lay of the land through the trees and too much sun is still an issue but soon the upper stories of trees will rebuild their summer canopy.

I was excited to arrive. I left early and looked forward to the perrenial favorite, Smoky Mountain Diner, just steps into town. The town is small and doesn't really have too much to offer but to us it is close to nirvana. A great outfitter, post office, grocer, harware store, and 3-4 restaurants. Also a couple hostels and campground for showers and laundry.
We also always have our antenna up for weather. Today was to be nice but tomorrow showed 100% chance of rain with the following day looking only slightly better. I knew I was taking tomorrow off. But what to do about the rest of this sunny day after having only walked 3 miles? After the promised Diner breakfast I wanted to add a few extra hiking miles to my day, an opportunity I could fulfill here. Six miles North the trail crossed the road again. I got a ride to the intersection and slack packed my way back into Hot Springs this time heading South. It was fun to record all the startled looks from my northbounding brethren. Lovers leap is the main attraction on this leg. Impressive rock outcroppings overhang the equally impressive French Broad river below.  I was amazed at the water flow of this river, wide and fast right to its edges.

The weather forecast was for 100% chance of rain and it did not disappoint. But it wasn't a nice gentle rain, it was a constant heavy soaking, hours and hours of it. At first it didn't appear to be a problem. We stayed snugly inside, wandered out for lunch, got so decadent as to arrange for a soak the the ""world famous"" local hot springs and even added a massage. Ha! Nice dream....Flash flood warnings started coming across our phones. Our first clue that we had a problem was when they called to cancel the hot tub experience, the pumps were flooded and water not maintainable. Then in a late interlude of calm we noticed the French Broad River next to our campsite was rising. In fact it had risen so much that the Appalachian Trail out of Hot Springs was completely under water and so was the nearby parking lot. There was a pick up floating in the river! We all became Lookylues and headed over the bridge to gape. The vehicle seemed to be still on it's wheels for a while but then became unmoored and started floating. Oddly the windshield wipers were going. It bumped against a few trees and then seemed to get stuck thankfully facing into the oncoming waters. That's where my story of the pick up ends because our story picked up its pace. While we thought we were high enough in the campground we noticed the waters nearby were still rising now to a new level. A peek at the local weather service said the French Broad River would crest about midnight. That was far too many hours away for our comfort. The gate house staff told us we were fine but a random check in to the offices told a different story. The whole campground needed to evacuate. Here's your $50 dollars back now get out of here. Rain had started again. Dark clouds were still in the area though blue sky poked through in between. Another round of rain was also expected tomorrow. A mad dash of packing and hooking up took over the camp ground. What about the hike? Don't know, just get out of town now. So off we were to the unknown without a clear plan.We chose to head to the next expected AT crossing about 50 miles ahead.

It was a raw day; that cold clammy chill that seems to sneak into every joint and muscle. Met some hikers camped at the top of Rich Mountain who said they'd had hail, sleet and rain over night. They were still there at noon trying vainly to dry their tents out before packing them up. We also had lots of ups and downs with at least two 4000 footers. Even though the weather report predicted clearing through out the day that clearing happened in the valleys not up here in the mountains where the clouds clung tenaciously.

All in all I was contemplating the amount of permanent damage I was doing to my body trying to do this hike. It was not a good day for the heart and soul. The only campsite I could find near the shelter was quite sloped so I knew it would make for an uncomfortable night. Adding more trouble to my evening, everyone else hiking with dogs also showed up at this shelter so we had a total of 5 dogs running amock in the muddy leavings of the weeks' rains.

Another thing you become very attune to are the phases of the moon. Where recently at Max Patch we had a waxing moon, now after a few days of rain we have a waning moon. The clouds had finally cleared out and the moon and stars were out in their full glory. Having gone to bed so early I was also awake early and the bright moon urged me out. One of the treats of AT hiking is night hiking, but most do it was headlamps. This morning was one of those rare opportunities for another version. The leaves had not yet filled in and the moon was still close to full affording me my favorite experience, hiking by moonlight.  Also with a waning moon the sun will come up while the moon is still out so I could seamlessly start my hiking day. I started out about 5 AM in that spooky sort of twilight where everything is clear but also hidden. What eyes might be following me? I took my time and hiked slowly into the dawn up Viking Mountain. At least that seems to be what the locals call it, the sign said Camp Bald. We also passed an area named Jones Field which had no field, just a sea of gnarly mature rhododendron over boulders. There was a special 1.5 mile section of the trail here that reflects thousands of volunteer hours. Carefully placed rocks and boulders were moved to add this amazing ridge walk. I took Leila's pack off her only once so she could more easily negotiate the path. Its when you see this work you marvel at the dedication of the many trail volunteers. 
Leila's been quite active this outing, bright eyed and bushy tailed and also eating far more than I was used to. I did not have enough food to get her through 2-3 more nights on the trail so perhaps I was rationing a bit. But I have learned the hard way, dogs consider human waste a treat. Thru hikers know to bury their poop. It should be at least 6-7 inches deep and covered. Like most shelters this one had a privy, but someone decided to do their business right behind the shelter. I stopped for a minute to chat with the couple hikers there and she came around the corner excitedly working what looked like peanut butter on her tongue with a decidedly different odor. This is not the first time it's happened. Just gross...gross. Keep that muzzle away from me girl. yuck Thanks to that little experience her enthusiasm waned during the afternoon. She was no longer interested in her food or treats so clearly this had turned out to be a bad experience for her as well.
 I stopped at Flint Mountain Shelter. The next one on the way and the one most of last evening's hikers expected to reach today. Since Leila's issues with Lilly I decided to add an extra mile or so to avoid conflicts, but then the terrain was especially easy and the lure of a hostel at the upcoming road crossing urged me on. Trail magic by Tam and Torch greeted me at the road with sweets and soda. I had to explain I why I didn't want it.

The woman who sprayed down the bunk with Lysol had mentioned someone else sleeping there had gotten a ""stomach bug"", the ""mattress"" was a piece of foam where all the Lysol in the world wouldn't get it clean, but my dog had had her face in fecal matter earlier so I really don't know what to blame. I do know I started experiencing sweats and chills through out the night. The urge to hurl dinner was there but I tamped it down. By morning I had a quick rush to the privy for a round of explosive diarrhea. While I didn't feel well I also didn't feel completely incapacitated and I sure as heck wasn't going to spend any more time at this lovely ""hostel"". It was pretty unsanitary. So I headed up and out. My initial goal had been Big Bald, but I set my goals shorter, Sam's Gap was only 8.5.There was a fairly steep 2000 ft climb out of Devils Fork Gap and by the time I reached the top I knew I was in trouble. I was afraid to eat anything feeling anything I did eat would come right back up. I sipped water carefully but never too much expecting that to perhaps come up as well. The toll on my body was telling. I was struggling. It was 5.5 miles forward or 3 miles back. Terrain was in my favor so I continued on. With every passing mile things seemed to get worse. All I had to remember was one foot forward, just always one foot forward. I was a beautiful day but I was shambling like the walking dead, alternatively a bit light headed or delirious. It was scary. I guess it wouldn't have been bad if I had just camped and slept it off but I knew I had a ride waiting for me if I could just make it. Only 3.2 to go. Finally the shelter, only 2.4 to go. Made it up the last little rise, only 1.6 to go. Hiking in smaller and smaller increments. Up hill at all was utterly taxing and I would stop every few feet to rest. The stomach was both as glass and as twisted metal. There wasn't really any food in me to expel and the weakness was extreme. My muscles felt like a wrung out washcloth with all their strength sucked out of them. All the joy of hiking was also sucked out of me today. All the sunshine in the world couldn't help me feel better. Finally the last descent and waiting support. I made it. And now I'm going to crawl under a rock for a while.","Laurel Hostel

One of the things that amazed me 20 years ago and again now is the fast and also enduring creation of the season's hiker community. 300 plus miles. By this time on the trail, many of us have seen and met many in our cohort of hikers, not just once but sometimes dozens of times in dozen's of places. We know each other, whether by face or name or trail name. We might know why someone's hiking or where they're from or some other idiosyncrasy, but we're not deeply acquainted. None of that matters, we are now sharing a difficult challenge together and it seems to bring out the best in people. The day before I got sick, three thru hikers with a dog (Arrow) were slack packing because one of their families lived close by. Since I wasn't sure if I had enough food for Leila to make it all the way to Erwin I asked them if they could bring me a little extra dog food the next day to supplement what I had. The next day when I was struggling with my last section, sure enough Puppet and Pic come by with a bag of extra food for Leila. A few miles onward I meet Quest, another thru hiker on his own journey.  He is a bit older and hikes with a knee brace due to arthritis, so he is attempting to slack pack as much of the trail as possible. He is one man on the trail with two cars. Every hiking day he drives one car approximately 15 miles north of the place he parked his other car. He then hikes south to the other car which he drives 15 miles north of the previous parked car, thus leap frogging his way north but hiking south. Quest saw I was in trouble and asked to help. Could he take some of the things from my pack to lighten my load? Anything? He'd be happy to bring it to Erwin for me. And finally on the last stretch another hiker I recognized passed me by as I was resting. I asked if he had any sort of electrolytes to help me make it the rest of the way. Sure he said and gave me a bit of what he had. 
There is incredible respect, ethics and integrity among thru hikers. A pack might have more than a thousand dollars worth of gear but it would never cross anyone's mind to thieve. Our packs are our survival gear and no one would harm someone else's ability to survive. We help each other, advise, support and do whatever is necessary for everyone to succeed. Both Trail Magic and Trail Angels are born from this tradition. Almost across the board, such services are provided by previous years' hikers in their efforts to try to, not specifically recapture, but to give back, relive a bit and positively contribute to the success of the new season. They too were helped by others both on and off the trail and know how much it meant to them to receive that support when they needed it. When crossing the road at Devils Fork Gap a loaded trail stickered truck came around the bend and pulled over for me. Torch (2016) and Tam (2007) hopped out, ""Something to drink? to eat? Dog treats?"" On this day alone they had already driven over 100 miles in service to helping hikers. 
Its not only the hike that makes this experience phenomenal it is the hiker community that forms and then remains like a high school class with all the memories of the trials and tribulations of your year. The ""Where were you when..."" questions. From 20 years ago the one that still stands out is, ""Where were you when Hurricane Floyd came through?"" Any alumni can tell you in detail.
If there is trouble on the trail it's almost guaranteed to be from an outsider. 20 years ago we worried about the Atlanta GA abortion clinic bomber who was supposedly on the trail. This year we already had an incident with an unstable man threatening hikers at a shelter with a knife and otherwise being unruly. The information was broadly communicated to all the hikers who where on the lookout and the man was just arrested with hikers coming forward to press charges. Its an amazing community to be a part of and I am proud to be included.","Recovering

Thanks to the extra day though I have confidence I can do it tomorrow. Finally this evening I was actually hungry.
Last week when I left Hot Springs I saw new signs up for Uncle Johnny's Low Country Boil and chilly events Friday and Saturday. Many of my hiking companions have hiked on but this event might have encouraged people to take some zero days of their own. I felt sure I'd see of my friends at the event. Stan and I drove over to visit, share and perhaps create a few more stories and then head back to comfort.
The recovery time has been great for my feet and knees as well, but it's also exposed some concerns. Where my gait had been fairly smooth and normal before starting the hike, I'm now walking oddly. I don't feel like I'm in pain today but I've completely changed how I walk and it's not in a good way. I seem to swing my leg with the replacement knee like its a prosthetic. It has come about in response to carrying a pack and minimizing my impact per stride. I'm definitely processing pain when hiking. I can identify that when I see other hikers walk. I realize I could not walk like that because it would hurt too much, which then of course allows me to realize I am hurting. A number of doctors have pointed out that I have very high pain tolerance. This can be a good thing or a bad thing. Great, if you're being chased by tigers and need to that extra umph. Bad, if you're slowly inflicting permanent damage that you are not fully aware of.","Recovering

Sure enough I had a little bit still in my system. The stomach still clenched a bit when I exerted myself and the other effects were still around but at a much decreased level. By end of day however everything seemed to be worked out. The trail to Big Bald (5500 ft) was mostly gentle with some great breakout views of the top. Again the tiny flowers that resemble strawberry blooms were blanketing the ground. The backside of the mountain has an extensive housing development that seems centered on a local ski area but the trail carefully avoids it so we barely see it's existence until we reach the top. Big Bald is another grassy topped mountain followed closely by Big Stamp. Because the top of the mountain is so access able to people from the development it it a common spot for trail magic. Today was no different. Chips, snacks and beverages were available. Little Bald and High Rock completed the day before we descended to Spivey Gap. While I felt reasonably well at the end of the hike I could tell I was more exhausted than the workload would normally have cost. Good food and an early bed were on the ticket.

Today was an easy ""connecter"" hike without any memorable climbs. I really enjoyed popping in and out a long series of steep valleys all while keeping a similar elevation. On a non topo map the trail looks like a zig zagging switchback for a climb or descent but it is not at all. A very fun way to experience the tight valleys of this area. The final descent into Erwin TN and Uncle Johnny's hostel, which is the first thing that greets you as you step on the road, is an amazing view of the Nolichucky River from what feels like straight up. This is one of the places where the trail has gotten longer as they've done a great job adding more switchbacks to the trail.

It was crested with a beautiful fir forest. From there I hit Beauty Spot at 4400. A road accessible bald where the AT was a park like grassy path.

Its been getting warm in the valleys, upwards of 80 degrees!  The mountains are still cooler and spring is still in slumber but, you can sense it. Again I'm letting gravity do the work starting at a higher point than where I finish. What a beautiful hike! I headed up to Roan Mountain first and stopped in to see the highest elevation shelter on the entire AT (6200 ft) It was an entirely enclosed building. More like an old style one room house. Even though it is in the woods I'm told it gets quite windy here at night. Just a few hundred feet off the top and you'd never know it was windy.  Roan is also the former site of the Cloudland Hotel. One of those big fancy hotels of the early 1900s. Surprisingly, it did not burn down as so many others have done. It was closed and then dismantled when it became less fashionable. Roan was followed by a long descent into Hughes gap. Then up little Roan and finally Iron Mountain. Wandered through an old apple orchard. Fun to see how different it is from orchards today. The trees where huge! The could easily compete with the tallest birch/beech/oak in the area and as they were flowering, the bees were pollinating, but not the bees we're used to, wild american bees. They look much more like bumble bees than our imported honey bees. Was great to see nature taking back what we had wrought. 
I met a hiker at Hughes gap that had a surprising request. Sixtyish gentleman asked to use my phone, he was hoping for a pick up. What I was doing as a one day slack pack, he'd planned as a three day hike with two overnights. He was struggling and didn't think he could go on though he only at 9.6 miles to go and 24 hours to do it.  I realized then that while I was lamenting my slower pace this hiker showed me how truly well I was doing. I also met my racers, Smoochie and Sniper. They had started yesterday at Uncle Johnnys, overnighted at Hughes Gap and planned to cross 19E by evening, so what was/will be a 3 day hike for me is an easy two for them. They started in Springer April 9. They're not running but just moving fast. Her pack base weight she said was 10-11lbs, but I still wasn't close to keeping up even without a pack at all! I met them the first time at Sam's Gap but they'd needed a town day to replace her shoes. The other surprising hiker I met again today is a guy carrying a duffle bag and tarp over his shoulder. No pack at all, no hiking poles, just a duffle slung over his shoulder.  He's also moving quite quickly. It does not look comfortable at all but he appears to be making it work for him. My final siting of the day was Pop Tart. I hadn't seen him since the Smokies. Fun to do a bit of a catching up before I headed off to catch my ride. Weather is coming in soon but I now have to take over my equipment again. Tomorrow will be a zero and then I'll start hiking again.

When I was quickly climbing Hump Mountain, the last of the balds, the hikers before me were also claiming as quickly as they could because the storm clouds were gathering closer and closer as we hurried. I have not hiked this fast so far this year. The weather made it urgent. But then somehow the massive storm clouds parted around the mountain and continued on, dropping tons of rain beyond the mountain top and giving us a reprieve. It wasn't a full reprieve however It was another 5 miles from the top of the mountain to the road crossing and unfortunately storm clouds regathered and the last mile down to the road was very wet. The other amazing thing about today's hike was the overland shelter. It is actually a full sized barn that had been converted and repurposed as a shelter along the trail. It is an absolutely amazing space and incredibly picturesque both to look at and to be in and look out from. I would highly recommend this section as a 2 day hike starting at Carver gab staying overnight at the overland shelter and then hiking the rest of the way into the valley.

We walked through some beautiful fields and waterfalls. There was a picturesque field along a beautiful river that was quite amazing. It was so different from yesterday. You could hardly tell what the weather was like simply because the leaves were already so thick. You couldn't really keep an eye on the weather and certainly had no sense of the mountains or ridge lines nearby. It was also much warmer and more humid giving it a completely different feel.

I had been so afraid of the rain that paid the hostel to shuttle me so I could slack pack back to them and spend another rain free night there. But of course that comes at a price. Another night at the hostel plus the cost of two shuttles. I could have easily hiked what I did yesterday and set myself up in a tent long before the rains came. So today, though the weather report was the same, rains in the afternoon, I promised myself a hike and I would set up camp early enough to avoid any heavy rains.... Everything was going according to plan. I made my goal and hadn't gotten wet yet. Now time to find a place to camp. The sky was getting heavy with rain and I knew it wasn't far off. I crossed the road and passed the sign that said hostel nearby. I was determined to save myself the few shillings based on my overspending yesterday. Sigh. Wrong choice. For the next 1.5 miles I look for any descent spot to camp. Nothing, nothing, nothing. The sky was getting darker and darker. Finally I saw the next shelter was coming up in less than a mile. Still dry. Maybe I could hurry enough? Still no place to tent. How come when you're looking for a spot you come up empty and when you're not they seem everywhere! Frustrating. Finally my time just ran out. I was descending a series of steep stone steps as the heavens opened, and I mean opened! While I'm familiar with the term white out in snow conditions I had never seen anything like it with rain. For a short period it was raining so hard you could barely see. I was too slow into my rain gear and getting the dog into hers so in simply moments we were wet. It was as though we had stepped into a lake and stepped back out. Feet soaked, everything a mess. Now what? It was still a half mile to the shelter and I was still desperately looking for a campsite. Anything would do... And it did. Another 100 yards further I spied a nasty little spot. It was perhaps half the width of my tent and only barely long enough with a couple of embedded bowling ball sized rocks in the middle but it would have to do. It was the best I had seen for the last 1.5 miles and the wet path forward looked a little treacherous so I took it. Still raining, though past its initial fury, I set up camp. We were both pretty miserable. The moment I got the tent up, Leila flew inside, and naturally shook herself instantly creating an 8oz puddle in the middle of our sleeping place. She gave me a look that said ""How could you do this to me? Help me? I was miserable as well and knew that somehow we were going to have to make this work. I had a towel to wipe up the water and kept adjusting the tent until my tent floor no longer picked up rain from outside. It was a careful balancing act to get everything away from the walls, keep the condensation from dripping on us and hang the edges of the tent on this awkward site so as to keep the rain out. I ate an energy bar for dinner. Then we hunkered down between our bowling balls and surprisingly created a little warm nest to last out the night.

The outhouse is still up that hill and the outdoor showers are over there. The one benefit that mattered to me however was the small space heater that came with the cabin.

I stopped to check the water temp. It reminded me of when I took swimming lessons in NH. Yup it was a bit on the cold side but you'd get used to it once you got in. Thinking of summer swims at the lake put me in a good mood. The hike today was a straight line ridge walk along the lake. While the leaves are almost full size we had glimpses of the lake below as we moved along. The hike seemed to come easily and I just kept moving. The Rabbit Hole Hostel was really too far to be realistic but I kept having little reasons nudge me to get there. Two weeks ago I had gotten trail magic from Tam and Torch who offered me a wristband for a free milkshake at the Rabbit Hole. There had been concerns of bear activity in the area and I didn't want to have to deal with Leila and bears and finally I came across some hikers I'd hiked with before (Sunshine, Nobody, Buck) who challenged me to get there with them. Their goal was pizza and beer, but while their goal didn't intrigue me somehow their challenge did.  It was 4:40 and seven miles to go. The next shelter was only 3.... I found a second wind.

We would get there only a bit before dark and I wasn't going to scout around for a place to stay once there so I called ahead for a bed. Damascus has quite a few hostels but they charge a premium because it's such a popular stop. $40 would get me a bed in the living room with 6 others, breakfast and a wash of clothes whether I wanted it or not.

Hyper99,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613178,"Ponies!Ponies!Ponies!Again I joined Quest for a southbound slack while leap frogging his start points north. I'm spoiled by this after only two days. Its hard to imagine picking up my full pack again and worrying about where to spend the night. Notices for bear activity are everywhere and knowing I don't have to subject myself or Leila to a chance meeting is so reassuring. Today we drove to the top of Grayson Highlands at almost 5000 ft with the plan to hike to an ending point at about 3000 ft. Mt Rogers, Virginia's highest peak, is on this stretch but it is a spur trail so we had not made the decision if we were going to hike the extra 2 miles to summit it. The sky was dark and dramatic and while it threatened rain it did not. We had a very late start thanks to a Post Office stop I had needed to make and a fairly long drive to our start point. Then of course the highlight of the area are the wild ponies that graze these peaks. It does have that look of the highlands of Scotland and the wild sky added to the feel. We moved very slowly today thanks to all the distractions and the very rocky terrain. It was difficult for both of us. It was already noon and we still had ten miles to go. Yesterday we had already completed 10 miles by noon. Sadly we agreed Mt Rogers was not on our to do list today and we followed the AT as it skirted around the summit. The terrain got a bit easier as we left the higher elevations but in the end I'd say this shorter stretch was harder than yesterday's hike. The scenery was amazing though and I definitely add this to my list of favorite sections of the trail.","US R 58

Hyper99,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613179,"Today promised rain. Well, it promised rain last night. but this morning the rain evaporated. Because of the expected weather Quest and I planned a short day. He also had family nearby and had dinner obligations with them as well as plans in the upcoming week. It would be our last hiking day. We again leap frogged north and hiked south to the Grayson Highlands where we had parked the car yesterday. Now we were also climbing the elevation we had lost yesterday. The terrain was good and didn't really get rocky again until the last couple miles. What did come at us were bear activity reports. Hikers at one location were up at 4AM throwing rocks at a bear in a tree going after their food bags hanging there. Then further stories of other hikers who had lost their food to a successful bear. Someone posted a facebook video of a bear trying to pull down food bags that were on bear cables near a shelter. Also supposedly a bear had gotten into a bear proof bear box. We never met the hikers who saw the bear box theft. We only had second hand reports so what actually happened where was not clear. We also came across a ridge runner who was looking into the reports. So happy my girl and I are not camping out here. 
We moved pretty quickly and the weather stayed quite pleasant. Multiple times we considered adding the second small loop of 8 miles to this one to add a bit more, but by the time we reached the top and Quest's car we both knew it was a good time to stop. Rain was predicted tomorrow. This time it was 100% chance for the next two days and he had family obligations coming up so we called it an early day and headed down. Massie Gap is a popular place for hikers to grab a shuttle to a nearby store for ice cream and resupply. We decided to check it out on our exit and enjoyed the stop. Sadly Quest and my paths now part for the time being. We'll see what the future brings. Tonight I catch up with Stan and we'll hide out from the rain and rest for a couple days.","Massie Gap, Grayson Highlands

Hyper99,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613197,"Its my zero day but the news does not stop. This event took place only a day ahead of me on the trail and probably involved hikers I've met. With a full day yesterday I would have finished at mile 520 and this took place about mile 535, one day ahead. I have not met the attacker but seem to have been consistently behind him by only one day these last few weeks. His attacks in Unicoi TN two weeks ago were just a day ahead and he stayed at a hostel I also stayed at just the night before me. I had asked the hostel owner about the incident she'd had and she gave it a completely different spin than the hiker rumor mill. She considered him an unmedicated schizophrenic and that once some of the hikers identified him as a problem he lashed out at their aggression. It's sad and scary to see this sort of event on the trail. I'm also worried about his dog. Its not mentioned in the story but he had been hiking with his dog Felicity and seemed to be very important to him. Mental illness sucks, but as a friend pointed out whether someone stabs you in the back cuz they're mentally ill or just plain mean, you still have a knife in your back so best not to go there. Both victims are expected to recover so at least we're not talking murder as early rumors had mentioned. The AT is now closed from mile 535 through 555, but hopefully will be a short term closure for evidence gathering.

Hyper99,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624733,Headed out on my own this morning. It was a bit gray but clearing throughout the day. After a few miles I ran into Sunshine (the hiker). After the news of the murder and the loss of Quest as my hiking partner I was happy to see Sunshine on the trail and asked if he would hike with me today at least. It was good to have the company and we made fast time. He can be a fast hiker and do alot in a day but he was happy to hang with me.  Chow Hound was going to pick me up at the end of the day today. She was about 300 miles ahead of me now but she's had some sort of foot problem so she's rented a car and has come back to hang out with me and then we'll go to Trail Days this upcoming weekend. We had fun with cows again. Poor Leila does not know what to make of them and they scare her like crazy. In the end Sunshine figured he'd hike with me through Trail Days as well so we'll be together for the next few days.,"Marion

Hyper99,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624734,"Another great day on the trail. We passed another of the nicest shelters on the tail, The Partnership Shelter. Everyone had been talking about it. I guess you can order pizza to be delivered here and take warm showers. The pizza part is true but the shower part has long since become nonfunctional. Just a few 100 yards after the shelter is a parking lot for the Mt Rogers National Recreation area. Its a big tourist welcome center with a gift shop. I peeked in but dogs weren't allowed. I did learn however that a very rare species of birch tree stands in the front lawn of the building. There are only 6 known Round Leaf birches known to exist. Not really much to look at when you see it but a fun little tidbit to know. A nice ridge hike after the visitors center and then a decent into the valley to cross the freeway. In hind sight I picked a stupid place to end the day. I chose it because I thought more than 15 would be too much. There's a great shelter nearby and some good camping beyond this road crossing but if you're asking someone to come pick you up here its not convenient. The next 1.5 miles are an easy gradual downhill and I should have pushed to there for the day. So I've not written about my plans but after I passed through Damascus and even before I learned of the murder I had decided I would leave the trail after Trail Days. Numerous factors are guiding my choice. Mainly it is clear to me that my knee performance is slowly deteriorating. It is continuously swollen and troublesome. Its just not worth risking my future ability to walk by trying to do this now.  I think I just started too soon and it needs to heal more and I need more rehab. My gate is off and while in some aspects my leg has become stronger in others it has atrophied. There are other factors as well. I worry about Leila in a couple different ways. While her paws are doing great, which is often a reason dogs have to get off the trail, I'm more worried about both heat and poison ivy. I'm highly allergic to the stuff and while I can do a decent job trying to avoid it she has no concept of the problem. Given we can go days without showering and she will often rub against me after having romped in the flora, it will be impossible for me to avoid contact with it.  I can predict this will not end well. A single poison ivy outbreak lasts weeks for me. As to the heat, we've now run into a few warmer days and her panting is alarming. If she's already laboring this much at these temps how will those 100 degree days go for her? I've decided that I will at least finish one quarter of the trail. That will be mile 548. It makes tomorrow my last day.  I'm sad to leave my trail family but look forward to seeing everyone this weekend at Trail Days to say good bye. I have an appointment with my doc back home and will check in with him when I get there. I'm hoping perhaps I can do more later this year after my knee has had some more recovery time.

Hyper99,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624735,"So many thoughts as I wander these last few easy miles. On my own again today but I ran into a couple I recognized and hiked to the freeway with them. Every meeting of hikers is another juncture to talk about the tragedy. What did you know, when did you know it, what have you heard, and did you know anyone involved... It's a common cloud on this hike especially at this time. We bond over it and carry it's weight.On a happier note there's a really cool Settlers Museum of Southwest Virginia and trail magic at mile 542.9 When you see the old school house, go in. Its a self serve trail magic stop! Very fun. A care taker came out as we passed by and told us more. From there it was off to the freeway crossing and a popular hikers restaurant. As I started along the trail on the other side of the freeway I had a huge deja vu moment. I realized this was the spot that I had taken on of my favorite pictures from my hike 20 years ago. While I knew it was VA, I had no idea where on the trail that picture had been taken. Once I saw it again I knew it immediately. Its been a wonderful trip down memory lane as well. Places I couldn't remember came back in full once revisited. I saw my parents on many stops on the trail as well. Its been a wonderful cathartic trip and I hope its not yet over.","USFS 86

Hyper99,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624736,"We had a couple days of drizzle but we settled in nicely in Damascus to wait for Trail Days. Its fun to watch the build up of the event. We even took a day to rent bicycles and coast down the Virginia Creeper Rail Trail. The AT crosses it a couple times and parallels it a bit so it was fun to see from a different point of view. Now that its here Chow Hound, Sunshine, Stan, Leila and I are exploring all the opportunities. I joined the annual hikers parade and we held a vigil for the fatality as well as the survivor. Beyond that vendors of every stripe are offering their wares. Very cool solutions and upgrades were everywhere. Too bad most of us have already had to cobble together our solutions and don't have any more room or money for more stuff. We're having perfect weather for the event and everyone is having a great time. It was a wonderful way to end my time on the trail for the time being.Adios my friends.","Mile 548
