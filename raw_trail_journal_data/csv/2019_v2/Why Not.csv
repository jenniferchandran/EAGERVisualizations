(OK always seems to be just one more thing to get!) Mary and I will try to get some pre-trail hikes in to get a our backs use to carrying packs, start to get some semblance of trail legs although nothing around our house compares to what we will encounter on the trail.

Why Not,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607851,"Just a bit over 4 weeks before commencing what will be another epic journey.  But this time I’ll be rambling the AT with my wife Mary instead of my son Will.
Last time being a newbie to the hike (before my 2017 hike, last time I did any hiking/camping was as a boy scout at the age of 14 or 15!) it was more of a science project getting ready to go – researching gear, talking to past through hikers, reading tons of blogs and articles.  This time it has been more fun getting ready to go.  Plus getting a newbie, Mary, geared up and ready go has been exciting.  Her excitement has grown over the past few weeks as gear has arrived, we've been doing training hikes, she has been doing her own research.  Like so many others, she can’t wait to get going.  Fortunately we will be quite busy and travelling over the next 4 weeks.

It has been difficult for me to limit the amount of information I share with her.  A balance getting her ready, but making sure I limit what I experienced and what she may experience so she can properly discover all the joys (and miseries!) of the trail.  I did spoil the part about the potential of finding a slug in her shoe in the morning but only after she inserts her foot into the shoe and wonders what is causing that squishy, oozy feeling.  But hey, I’m sure she will quickly forget about doing slug shoe checks until the fateful morning it happens. 
Training has been a bit limited, but I’m not too worried.  We are both in pretty good share, packs will be light, and we will be taking it slow the first two weeks.  AND I’m certain Pickleball is perfect training for hiking the first three easy states of Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee! 
Still many questions about how far we will go, (targeting at least Hot Spring TN together), will I do an entire through hike, do the last 700 miles I was unable to do last time (due to injury in MA), etc.  One day at a time…",,View Entry,"Mar 10, Sun",0
Why Not,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608645,"A little under 3 weeks to go. We are both very anxious to get going. All the prep done, gear bought, research done, informed friends and family. I remember feeling this way last time. Just can’t wait to get going. Mary also wishing we were “going tomorrow”. Of course reading blogs and facebook posts of those who are out there now, we are wise to wait till mid April. 
Not much training can be done now as we are in Florida for another week, Mary taking a trip with friends first week of April.  I’ve been running and playing pickleball (skills necessary for hiking!) but here in Florida getting as much vertical in an entire day as I will get in one trip from my tent to the privy! Mary has done a couple of 3 mile walks on the beach with her pack just to maintain some base of weight on her back. 
To be honest I’ve been a bit caviler with training this time around. Hope that does not come back and bite me. Of course we will take it very slow in the beginning. 
So assuming no injuries or issues between now and April 10, we are as ready as we can be. Watch out Springer here we come.",,View Entry,"Mar 23, Sat",0
Why Not,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610249,"Two parts to today - part  one stressful, part two Superb 


Part one.  Alarm off at 3:50 AM. Yep you read that right. Up out of bed, quick change into hiking clothes then hoping the cab would show up  on time. First time I’ve taken a cab (vs Uber or Lyft) in a long time. It was minorly stressful not being able to see on an app where the taxi was.  Arrived on time thought. Next Logan airport.  Wow was the line to get through security long.  Took us 35 to 40 minutes to get through.  Finally a few anxious minutes in Atlanta airport waiting for our checked box (with poles, food, tent stakes, etc) to arrival on the carousel. Best part of the flight was deleting a bunch of  apps off my phone. I will free myself from news, social media, email, etc. to just the basics for survival. Funny how a phone and some apps have made it into todays maslows hierarchy of  needs.  I quickly put part one into perspective.  A bit of stress going to the airport and a bit of waiting in line hardly even rates as a first world problem or stress. So blessed to be healthily and have the time and ability to go off hiking in the woods. 


Part two. Arrived just north of Springer around noon.  A gorgeous sunny day temps low 70s. I decided to hike the one mile south to the top of Springer and the very beginning of the trail. Mary choose to wait in the parking lot and save hiking the “extra” 2 miles.  By 1:15 we both left the parking lot for the 6 mile hike to Hawk mountain tent sites.  A very pleasant walk. Only encountered a half dozen of so folks headed north. Most seemed to be through hikers as they were sporting their Appalachian Trail tags on their back packs. Arrived at hawk mountain just around 4. Fortunately the TSA line to get to the site was really short.  It took us both quite a bit of time to setup camp, but we will get quicker as the days go by. Dinner was Subway sandwiches we packed in. Deluxe dinners of Ramon start tomorrow!!


Going a little over 8 to Gooch mountain shelter. Tomorrow There will be several testy climbs.","Springer Mountian

I forgot many and clear the stars can be so far from light pollution   Was foggy and cool when we got up. Took quite awhile to break camp but that ok as we are in no rush to hit the trail since “only” doing 8 miles a day  at this time.  Was foggy and a bit windy for most of the day.  Hit some trail magic about noon just as we were ready to have lunch. Normally trail magic is excellent but we were looking to lighten of food load a bit.  But hey I’ll take trail magic anytime even if it means carry a bit of extra weight. Couple of small climbs today were no issue. Made it to camp about 2:30 and set up. I made some real rookie mistakes setting up my tent. First tried to set it up upside down, then wrong way around then with the pole half in haft out the door/bug screen. Good thing was not raining out!   


Mary doing really well  hiking. I think she just might be liking it. It’s really enjoyable hiking together.  Let’s see just how we fare in poor weather conditions. Here on the AT those days are rare. Ha! 


One nasty little climb tomorrow and a steep down hill into Lance creek where we plan to spend tomorrow night. Other than that should be a nice 8ish day.","Hawk mountain tent site

Foggy but very comfortable temps. We Cruised along at a nice pace. Just one or two semi tough climbs, but they were short.  I can’t believe how well we are both doing. 


Sun came out and I asked Mary what time it was (thinking it was somewhere between 11 and 12) but Mary said 1. Wow could not believe how quickly the morning went by. Found some great down trees and laid out out tent to dry. They were SOAKING wet. Ate lunch and packed up for the final mile into Lance creek. Our packs were at least a pound or so lighter due to the now dry tents!  Arrived at Lance and since it was early decided to push onto Jarred Gap.

Why Not,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610361,"Was a quiet weather night last night although....  In the middle of the night a giant crack of a limb falling.  In the morning I spoke with a few of the folks who camped with us and we all had the same thought - bear was up getting somebodies bear bag. We all guessed if that happened, we were not going to be able to chase it away, and beside only 5 miles into Neels gap and food. Alas, all bear bags were safe and sound so we all were able to eat breakfast and be on our way.   


span class=""Apple-converted-space""> Made it into Neels gap about noon.  We decide to get a cabin for the night as some very nasty weather is on it way.   Depending on what happens tomorrow weather wise we may also zero here tomorrow. 


It’s been fun to watch the groups of people starting to form.  We are beginning to recognize a small moving caravan of hikers.  It is such a nice feeling when you round a corner, come to a water source, or arrive at camp and recognize or get recognized by the early through hikers.","Jarrad gap
",Neels Gap,"Apr 13, Sat",5.10
Why Not,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610447,"Based on the weather forecast and rain that greeted us this morning, we decided to take a zero day.  Ended up being a wise choice as raining and very windy at times.  


Here is what Mary Mary wrote on Instagram. You can follow her @marykenyon or https://www.instagram.com/mary...


.
Waking up to thunder,  lightning,  pouring rain and a tornado watch,  we decided to stay put for the day in our cozy cabin.  We'll be back walking in the morning. .
span class=""Apple-converted-space""> So tomorrow when I step back on the trail,  I will have gone further than 1000 other hikers this year!
.
When we arrived yesterday here at the cabins,  we were given the option of taking a thru hiker rate and cabin that had not been cleaned, or a deluxe cabin at twice the price. We took the thru hiker cabin. We opened the door with our clean bedding and it looked as if no one had been there. Great. .
Later that night we were reading the journal for our cabin and there was an entry from the previous night. ""Three drunk degenerates finding laundry and a shower after a hard rain storm. Remember: full throttle until you see God then brake. "" Not kidding. I ran to clean the bathroom. .
As you know,  we are dedicating our AT efforts to 2 friends with Parkinson's and raising awareness of the Michael J. Foxx Foundation.  How appropriate is it that we were given the Fox cabin! Not exactly what I had in mind - having 3 stuffed foxes watching our every move - but a motivation none the less to keep moving north.  I'm keeping my boots for now.","Neels Gap

Why Not,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610546,"Windy.  Thats the word for today.   Woke up and it was cold. High 30s? Plus ( or minus?) with the wind chill. First time I’ve hiked in long pants and puffy jacket. Jacket did not come off till early afternoon. Was clear and sunny so we afforded multiple spectacular views.  Lots of ridge hiking (windy!). Lunched on a nice rock outcropping with a view down the valley. What a treat! Had the toughest climb of the hike so far. Fortunately was not too long. Several others agreed was the most difficult to date. 


We made a wise choice doing a zero yesterday. Ran into a small group of folks at the shelter who we’ve been hiking with since Gooch. They pushed off yesterday morning and did the 11.5 to low gap shelter in the wind and driving rain. They took a zero today at the shelter to dry out and recover. 


Lots of fun and wonderful folks around the dinner table. Looking like it will be cold tonight. 30s??  Mary’s new sleeping bag ( she got a new one at Neels gap.) better keep her warm or she’ll have to take it back tomorrow. Only 11.5 miles back to the shop!  Still windy as I finish this post at the end of the day.","Neels gap zero

Why Not,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610615,"Woke up to a cold morning. Best part was being woken up by a bird singing a beautiful song. Sun was rising so we could see it was going to be a clear day. Mary was kind enough to go down to the shelter and grab our food bags off the bear cables. Broke camp and got on our way.  Didn’t take but about 1-2 miles before we stopped and took off our warm clothes.  Hiking was an absolute pleasure. Temps were perfect, no wind. Amazing how still it felt after yesterday’s windy day.  We had lunch just after mile 50 - yea!!! - before descending down into Unicoi Gap. 


Nasty climb up to the top of Rocky Mountain. Steep 1000 feet in 1.5 miles (at 13% grade for you bikers out there).  We knew the camp site had no water so filled all bottles and water bags at a spring half way up the Mountain. It was a pleasure hauling 8.5 pounds of water up the last half of climb!  Can’t wait to do that again soon. 


Last night a full shelter, many tents and people. Tonight Mary and I have the peak of Rocky Mountain to ourselves.  


Today marked the end of a successful week one.  Can’t wait to see what week two brings. The end of hiking in Georgia and into North Carolina for sure.","Low gap

Why Not,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610698,"After last nights post, I left my tent to see the sun set. Couldn’t see it but I was treated to a fantastic view down the valley opposite the setting sun. The western facing side of the Mountains across the way were all lit up in the most magical orange color. You would have thought it was Fall here in Georgia. 


To match the sunset last night, awoke to a spectacular sun rise. Wow what a way to start the day. We broke camp and had breakfast on a log - where else??  We will miss Rocky Mountain. 


Was a beautify day to hike. Sun was out, gentle breeze, temps in the 70s. Didn’t see many people on the trail even though they are out there. Of course the one tough climb was right at the end of the day. (Okay it finished one mile from camp.). 800’ over a mile (at 14% - again for you bikers out there). Was exhausting but what a sense of accomplishment when we reached the peak. 


While we did not see many on the trail today, must have been 20ish in camp as I turned in for the night. 


Short day scheduled for  tomorrow, little less than 4 miles to a hostel where we will resupply and rest up for the day.","Rocky mountian
",Deep Gap Shelter,"Apr 17, Wed",11.70
Why Not,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610800,"Quiet restful night, especially since we knew a very short day ahead, 3.6 miles, to the hostel where we reserved a cabin. Of course the 3.6 did not include the .3 side trail from the shelter AND the gentle 1/2 mile walk down the road to the hostel. So really a whopping 4.4 mile total walking day. We were TOTALLY drained when we arrived at the hostel at 10:30.  


Hostel was nice enough to provide hospital scrubs while they did our laundry. Even though wash was done in an hour, we hung around in the comfortable scrubs for most of the day.  doctors and nurses certainly lead a life in comfy work clothes. Our scrubs got mixed up, so I sported a lovely flowered top.  Elicited many laughs amongst our fellow hikers.  


Shuttled into town for dinner and resupply.  Hung out on the back porch and debated whether or not to hike tomorrow. Nasty weather rolling in. Apparently it has been a very wet and unusually unsettling weather year here in the Georgia mountains. We are in no hurry getting anywhere so pretty relaxed about getting the miles in at this point. 


A bit after 9 as I post this. Bed time directly correlated to miles.  More miles, earlier bed time, less miles later bed time.","Deep Gap Shelter

Mary heard two hikers were planning on heading into the town of Clayton. As much fun as it would have been to hang out on the hostel porch, We decided to join them, especially since we spent most of yesterday hanging out on the porch. 


Clayton was a very cute “2 block” town. Of course the non discript commercial strip (Wendy’s, Macdonalds, CVS, RightAid, etc. - you get the point) was right outside the original town.  Spent a fair bit of time at the local outfitter - one of the hikers (trail name giggles) was getting new shoes Had lunch at a local restaurant, quite good especially at 6.99 for pork chops with a side of Mac and cheese and mash potatoes. Well the unlimited soda did set me back an extra buck.  


Mary is becoming a Instagram diva. Above photo with her new trail friends doing and learning Instagram!  


We’ll be off again tomorrow. Suppose to be a cold morning. Lots of discussion at the hostel on whether or not there will be snow/flurries in the morning. Glad we are not in the Smokies!","Dick creek gap

Up a bit before 7, packed up, breakfast, shuttled to trail head, and off on the trail by 8:15.  Was a bit chilly but excellent hiking temps.  On and off spitting rain. A couple of times the sun tried to make an appearance but alas Mother Nature had different plans for the day.  Around 1:00 a MAJOR milestone -crossed the Georgia North Carolina boarder. 78.1 miles of Georgia hiking done!  


span class=""Apple-converted-space""> Polished off the 11.8 miles at 2:30 and pulled into the empty shelter. Decided not to tent and quickly set up sleeping pads and bags. Man were we cold!  Snuggled into our bags for an hour or so to warm up. Light snow continued while we remained buried deep in our bags. In fact still slightly snowing / sleeting as I write this. All the foliage covered in a very light layer or snow and ice. Temps probably just below freezing. Pic of the COLD shelter


Made a quick dinner, hung bear bags even though we speculated the bears went back into hibernation ( if they were smart!). 


Tomorrow suppose to be in sunny and in the mid 60s. While it may get there, but not by 7 or 8 in the morning.","Dicks creek gap top of Georgia hostel zero day
",Muskrat creek sheltet,"Apr 20, Sat",11.80
Why Not,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611089,"A tough night. Was COLD. Slight breeze all night directly into the shelter. Not only a slight breeze, but carried in a nice fine mist/fog/part of the cloud weather we were in. Had to sleep with my water filter in my bag so it would not freeze (that would destroy the filter membrane thus rendering it ineffective). While snuggling with a water filter not as nice as snuggling with Mary, At least the water filter does not hit  me in the arm when I snore . Even though we were in the shelter, threw our tents on top of our bags to keep some of the moister off them. 


Finally decided to exit the comfort (I use that term loosely) of our sleeping bags about 8:30. Decided to defer breakfast until we hiked off the Mountain into the gap 3 miles ahead.  It was a cold muddy slippery hike to the gap. We joked we would have an Easter Brunch when we got there. Low and behold when we rounded the corner to the gap, a giant trail magic event was underway. Tons of food including omelets, biscuits, home fries, bacon, sausage, fresh cut fruit.  The event was put on by a gentleman who through hiked in 1979 and has been doing this trail magic every Easter Sunday since. 


After filling out bellies, we left for the 8+ miles to the shelter.  A nice 2.5 uphill climb.  Lots of switchbacks made the accent quite nice. After that pretty flat, just very genial ups and downs. Sun was out, temps perfect. Made up for the end of yesterday and beginning of today.  Into camp, set, ate and jumped into bed. Looking like will be a very comfortably cool tonight.

A chilly breeze at Carter Gap Shelter so we decided to do a few miles before breakfast.  Wasn’t a miles or so till we started hiking on the south side of The Mountain/ridge so stripped off our extra layers.  Hiking was easy and covered 3-4 quickly. Had breakfast overlooking the valley on a log that was just the right height.  After that scampered to our first goal of the day - 100 miles!!  Progress quickly came to a halt about 1/2 a mile before the 100 mile fire tower mark on Albert mountain. Very very steep ascent!  At times almost straight up. By far the hardest climb of the first 100.  Reached the top just past noon where we were afforded a tremendous view - as one might expect from a location where a fire tower was built. Had a lovely lunch then proceeded just under 6 miles to Rock gap. Was 6 of the easiest miles of the past 100. 


Caught a shuttle into Franklin - just happen to be one there when we got there - what are the chances of that??  Checked into the hotel, crossed the street to a local brewery and had a few well deserved beers and food.","Carter gap shelter

Walked to a local for breakfast where we discussed whether or not Mary and I were going to continue the trail.  After two wonderful sunny days capped off with making it 100 miles, Mary decided to end her hiking on a high note.  Was an extremely difficult decision for me to decide to continue for awhile. Not that I wasn’t enjoying myself, its just hard for me to see me out there with out my best buddy beside me. We decided to meet up again in two days so I could see if I was ok without her. 


A few errands and I was back on the trail around 12:30.  A pretty easy 11 miles into Wayah shelter. Typical ups and downs. Nothing overly strenuous. Only passed 3 people until the Wayah bald observation tower where I met up with a group of 5 who we have been bumping into on and off the past week. Highlight of the day was Siler Bald. Billed as  one of the most spectacular summits along the southern Appalachian Trail.  Easily lived up to it’s reputation!  Had lunch up on the bald - most specular 360 view of nothing but Georgia and North Carolina mountains.","Winding stair Gap

Biggest miles to date has been 12.5 


Hiking was easy and temp cool early on. After about 1.5 hours pulled into a gap and had breakfast underneath a flowering fruit tree.  How special is that??  Two amazing views today. One from Rocky bald and one of the best so far on the observation deck of Wesser Bald tower. 


A long 2500 foot down hill into the NOC. A few harrowing short pitches but other than that not too bad. Met Mary at the NOC, had a beer by the river then dinner in the near by town of Bryson City. 


A few side bars. When Mary left the trail yesterday we did some equipment swaps  and I dropped probably 3 lbs of weight.  Lighter tent, sleeping bag and sleep mattress. Also decided to drop my umbrella. Wow made a huge difference. 


Picked up a new trail name. Actually Mary gifted hers - Why Not - to me. I was touched. Now whenever someone calls me by my trail name, I’ll remember the special time we shared on the trail.

Some of the best b&g I’ve had and definitely out of this world sausage!  Helped Mary with her plans and packing. She off to Naples FL for a few days then back home. 


Explored Bryson city. Very cool little town - gateway to the Smokies. After that we went back to the NOC and hung out by the river. Ran into at least 10 to 15 of the folks we have been hiking with the past 2 weeks. Such comradeships have been formed. Most were moving on and doing a few more miles today. 


A BIG climb tomorrow. 3330 feet in 5 miles.  To put in perspective, the John Hancock tower (in Boston) is 800 feet tall, so the height of 4 Hancock towers. Oh and supposed to rain. It will also be a sad morning as Mary and I separate yet again tomorrow.","Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC)

Everyone in camp had “exciting” things to say about that section.  Weather was interesting - was cool (a good thing) and windy. Till about 1 slight rain now and then. Once it rained hard for 5 minutes or so.  Hiked further than anticipated. Thought I would do 14 to 16, but polished off 16 to a shelter by 3.

Experienced the sun rising right down the trail. Wow that was special. Shorty there after a couple of turkeys crossed the trail, one was quite active with his gobbling.  Excellent morning of hiking, sunny and a pleasant breeze. A few nice views along the way. About 3 miles before clingmans vegetation changed to a moss covered pine forest. 


View from clingmans was spectacular. Last time I was through with Will conditions slightly different. Maybe 10 to 15 degrees colder winds whipping and visibility was 10 feet max.  I remember running to the top of the tower and immediately running back down. 


Spoke with the ranger at the tower. 2 weeks ago (night we froze in the shelter) they took 20 through hikers off the mountain. Wind chills -10, hikers spent two tough days in the Smokies and needed to be evaluated.  Was in the 60s today! 


Only a few miles into camp after clongmans , arrived a bit after 2 so had time to clean up and do some wash. And just how many of you have done wash in a one gallon ziplock freezer baggy?  Dryer was broken so had to hang my wash. It will not be quite dry when I put it on tomorrow morning.

I think the store made their daily revenue number on me alone!  Crossed the street to a local outdoor / REI type store as I still neede a few more food items. Found out that there was a free shuttle to Newfound Gap at 11. What luck. Was back at the gap and on the trail before noon!  Saw a few fellow hikers at the gap getting ready to go into town.  Most notably Sketch, a gent from Japan who we met early on.  He is thru hiking and completing the triple crown - PCT, CDT and now the AT. 


Hiked 3 miles to a shelter and had lunch. The next 7 miles were some of the most amazing so far. Easy ridge hiking with fantastic views all along the way. I think I almost walked off the ridge a dozen times as I was busy looking at the views. 


Into the shelter by 5 and ate my packed out sub.  You don’t realize how much subs weight verses trail food. My pack ought to be mighty light tomorrow now sans two subs. Better be as I’m planning on doing 19+ tomorrow which will put me 1 mile away from the northern boundary of the Smokies. I may do an audible after 13 and stay at the shelter there instead. 13 not enough, 19 maybe too many.   In the Smokies one is required to stay at shelter sites (no stealth camping) so miles are dictated by distances between shelters.  And though I have been referencing “at the shelter” I tent at them verses stay in the actual shelter. I don’t mind cuddling with total strangers, just I prefer a bit of privacy.","My Collins shelter

Due to work of the park staff, they are making a come back. So nice to see our tax dollars at work. I’ve met at least 10 National Park staff the past week. Such dedicated and pleasant folks. 


Late afternoon passed the last shelter in the Smokies and without a thought decided to press on (this after 18 miles). Out of the Smokies about 4 PM. A sad moment. Wow 71 miles and 4 unbelievable weather days in the Smokies. Apparently highly unusual. 


Trekked on to the standing bear hostel. A place time has forgotten. Met up with 007 ( formally pork rind - don’t ask), Box and higina (sp?) who I met day two on the trail.  Double D and two sticks rolled in an hour after I did.

Had a giant breakfast burrito, did a bit of resupply, packed up and waited for 007.  


Nice little 5 mile 2400 climb right out of the gate.  Might have been that last beer I had last night, or the 23 miles I hiked yesterday or just maybe a 2400 foot climb, but was feeling it.  Also was the first whiff of summer weather, bit of heat and humidity, at lest till we got 1500-2000 feet higher.  


Nothing of note for the first 12-13 miles. Partly sunny and comfortable, manageable ups and downs - except of course the refreshing morning climb. 


3ish we hit one of biggest highlights of the southern AT - max patch.  A massive bald with tremendous views in all direction, especially up the Tennessee valley. We hit max between thunder storms so was especially dramatic seeing storms around the surrounding mountains, seeing rain showers off in the distance.  If you’re ever down this part of the country, go out of your way to experience max patch. You can drive to the base and take a short stroll to the top. Or start at Springer mountain and hike 23 days and 255 miles north.

Laundry a real issue here in Hot Springs. The one “laundry mat” closed months ago due to all the machines being broken.

Was not a happy memory, but I was glad to be getting back on the trail. Got going about 2:40. 


First two miles was a quick wake up call. A beautiful trail, but very muddy and the mosquitoes were out with vengeance.  Needless to say I was moving quickly. You would think they can’t catch you but a few do.  And I know it is just a few cause the once or twice I stopped, I was immediately attacked by MANY. I was thinking it was going to be a long day, but after awhile I moved out of the swampy area and was mosquito free the rest of the day.

Took a shade over 4 hours to cover the 11 miles. The two week break effected my trail legs and  conditioning. Shouldn’t be long till back to 100%, maybe a week?  Oh well I’ll just have to hike some extra time each day till then.

Lots of muddy places along the way.  So far the hiking in MA is a very pleasant surprise.  I have really enjoyed the trail here.  


Made 3 rookie mistakes today. First I left my socks out last night. They were almost dry until the rain got to them. So had to carry heavy wet socks all day.

Made it to zeland falls amc hut about 9:30. Bam - super trail magic. They fed me a huge bowl of oatmeal, scrambled eggs, bacon, pancakes and soup. And I found two freeze dried meals in the Hiker box.
