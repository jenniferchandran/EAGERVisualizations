Mosey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603663,"In 2000 my daughter did a few weeks on the AT and it intrigued me. I joined a local hiking meetup in California and after one backpacking trip I was hooked. I’ve done many backpacking trips all over the US and have had the long trail itch for many years. But every year it seemed that something stopped me; the births of grandchildren, health, etc. I’ve also had a fear of starting alone, as I have always backpacked with my daughters or husband. When I saw a post on FB Appalachian Trail Women that there were others starting next spring with the same fears I knew I had solved that issue. The next step was telling hubby. He was completely supportive and said he will meet me along the way. So I’m going for it!",,View Entry,"Sep 27, Thu",0
Mosey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603725,"Since I’ve done a lot of backpacking I have most of my gear. But since I’ve mostly gone with my daughters or husband I was able to share gear. So there are a few things I need to replace. The biggest item is a tent. We also carry an MSR water filter that is too heavy, so I need to figure out what filter system I will carry. And I’m considering not carrying a stove. ",,View Entry,"Sep 28, Fri",0
Mosey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603804,One thing I’ve found is that I don’t have anyone to talk to. I spend a lot of time researching and am excited to share but my family is already tired of my rambling on about the Appalachian Trail. I took a class at REI yesterday on hiking the AT. It was interesting. He had a lot of fun facts. ,,View Entry,"Sep 30, Sun",0
Mosey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605258,My husband and I did two nights here. It was beautiful with the leaves changing. There were some tough sections climbing through rocks and boulders but overall a nice hike. I was cold at night so realize I need to reconsider my cold weather clothes for beginning the AT.,,View Entry,"Nov 04, Sun",0
Mosey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605256,I got my Patagonia Nano puff today. I’m not sure if I will keep it. I have a North Face puffy that only weighs 1.5 ounces more and I’m not sure the Nano is any warmer based on reviews and comparisons. I should get my tent tomorrow; Big Agnes Copper Spur UL1. I bought the footprint also and now see one used on REI for less so might swap that. I think my Deuter pack might be too heavy but I love it. I’m also debating on my BV. I’ve carried it for years since it was required in many places. And it fits in the bottom section of my pack. I don’t feel comfortable with hanging my food. I think I have my weight pretty good other than these two things. I still have time to decide. ,,View Entry,"Nov 12, Mon",0
Mosey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606316,"I have all of my gear except sleep clothes. My son was in the Army and said their silk weight long underwear were real warm so I’m thinking of trying those to start with if I can find them. I’m worried about being cold. It’s a delicate balance between being warm enough and keeping weight down.  I’ll be trying my cold weather sleep system next week, camping at the Southern Ruck. 
I’m still having foot problems. The inserts helped with the pain on the outer edge of my foot but I still have other issues. All on my right foot. My toes were going numb so I switched to thinner Darn Tough socks and that seemed to help that. The last issue is pain in the ball of the foot. I have arthritis there so there might not be anything to do but I’ve been researching and think metatarsal pads might help but have yet to find any that will actually work for backpacking. I might have to buy a different pair of inserts that have them built in. ",,View Entry,"Jan 09, Wed",0
Mosey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606552,"last weekend I went to the Southern Ruck and camped at Vogel State Park. Saturday poured rain all day and my Big Agnes Copper Spur didn’t have a drop inside. I woke Sunday with my tent zipper frozen in the 20 degrees, tent covered in snow. I was cold at night so I have ordered some reflectix to put under my pad in the colder southern section. Overall I was very happy with my gear!",,View Entry,"Jan 23, Wed",0
Mosey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607563,"I had a panic moment last night thinking, Am I crazy?  What makes me think I can do this?  I couldn’t sleep so I got up and read a little from “Old Lady on the Trail: Triple Crown At 76”. It helped me remember that I just have to put one foot in front of the other, set small goals, really see what is around me, and remember how blessed I am to have this opportunity. Out of panic mode and back to excitement and anticipation!",,View Entry,"Mar 04, Mon",0

It was a beautiful, sunny day. I stopped at Long Creek Falls for lunch. There weren’t a lot of views but it was a great hike. 
I stopped at Hawk Mountain Shelter for the night. There were a lot of people there. We sat around the fire talking. Great friendly people. Chopsticks cooked an entire pork loin over the fire. I can’t believe he carried that in. 
Overall it was a great first day on the trail!!","Springer Mountain 
",Hawk Mountain Shelter,"Mar 23, Sat",8.10
Mosey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608768,"I didn’t get a very early start today. It will take me a few days to get my setting up and taking down camp system figured out. It was another beautiful day.  Several great views today. I’ll add pictures when I get this all figured out. 
We climbed Sassafras mountain right away and that was tough. We cheered at the top only to realize it was a false summit. But the rest of the way up wasn’t bad. When we got down to Cooper Gap there was our first trail magic!  One side of the road had breakfast and the other had lunch. I had a sausage biscuit and orange juice then went to the other side for dessert!  People are so nice!  Not just the trail angels but everyone!  
We had several more ups and downs and a couple of small water crossings. I hiked mostly with Shawn, John, and Colonel. He’s the only one with a trail name so far. He hiked it in 2017 with his daughter. When we got to Gooch Shelter the ridge runner said it was going to be crowded and suggested we go on to the next camping area over a mile away. It was only 1:30 so we liked that idea. The camp area is at a road crossing and had lots of sites. There are probably 20 of us here. There was also trail magic here!  Beer and hotdogs!
Another great day on the AT!","Hawk Mountain Shelter

Mosey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609036,"Last night it stormed like crazy!  Rain, thunder, lightening, wind and hail! But I stayed dry in my tent. Everything is a muddy mess and I was very cold. 
Climbed Blood Mountain this morning and had breakfast at the top. Sweetwater and I got a little off trail going down. we hiked into Neels Gap. I bought a new sleeping bag. Much warmer!  We shared a pizza and resupplied. Austin decided he was done and got a shuttle out. 
We hiked out about 4 miles to a campsite with a great view. As soon as we got our tents up it started to rain. 
Another great day!","Jarred Gap
",Wolf Laurel Top,"Mar 26, Tue",8.60
Mosey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609037,"We immediately climbed straight up out of Tenastee Gap. It is very cold and windy today. 
We stopped at Low Gap Shelter for water and I used the privy. Haven’t had to dig a cat hole yet. 
We hiked too many miles today. My foot was giving me a lot of pain and my back hurts. I can’t do these big miles yet. I had a meltdown in my tent. So much support from the AT women’s FB group. I just need to hike my own hike and if it means the guys go on without me, it will be ok. I didn’t enjoy the hike today. In fact I don’t even remember what I saw. We are taking a Nero tomorrow so I can reset and move on.","Wolf Laurel Top
",Chattahoochee Gap,"Mar 27, Wed",12.90
Mosey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609067,"Today was a short hike but straight up and down into Unicoi Gap.  We got a shuttle to the hostel and my first shower!!  I felt like a new woman. 
I talked with the guys about my need to take it a little easier. They agreed and seem fine with us hiking together for a while yet. 
The hostel shuttled us to town where we did laundry, bought groceries, and had dinner at a Mexican restaurant. Since I’m eating all cold food it was great to get a hot meal!
Sleeping in a bunk tonight then a tough climb out of the gap tomorrow. 
Oh!  The guys decided my trail name should be Mosey since I often say I’ll mosey on down the trail. I’ll take it!!","Chattahoochee Gap

Mosey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609115,"I ate a bagel,hummus and avocado that I had got in town for breakfast. Delish!  We were back on trail at 8:30. Lots of climbs and pretty views. I didn’t realize Georgia had so many mountains. We took a few breaks with our packs off and that allowed me to rest my foot.  It was a beautiful day ,in the 60’s and sunny.  A much more pleasant day. 
After we left the shuttle I didn’t see another woman the entire day. They’re supposed to be out here but not near me.
I saw Sparky and Hopeful from the Southern Ruck. It was nice to see them. 
I’m ready to settle in for the night. Maybe read for a bit.","Top of Georgia Hostel 
",Swag of the Blue Ridge ,"Mar 29, Fri",9.30
Mosey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609189,"First thing this morning we climbed up Kelly Knob.  I think that’s the toughest one so far. Then a long 2000 feet down to Dick’s Gap. At least that was pretty gradual. When we got the the Gap we walked the half mile to Top of Georgia Hostel to have lunch and resupply. The shuttle gave us a ride back to Dick’s Gap and we started the long second half of the day carrying 6 days of food. We are planning to hike to NOC by Friday.   I thought we were never going to get here but we crossed into N.C. and are camping at Bly Gap.  I’m sore, and tired.","Swag of the Blue Ridge 
",Bly Gap,"Mar 30, Sat",16.40
Mosey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609461,"It had rained all night and was bitter cold in the morning, so hard to get out of my sleeping bag. The rain had frozen in the trees so the gusting wind was causing the ice drops to fall on as we hiked. Then it started to snow. It was cold all day. 
Every day is hard out here. We started right out climbing straight up. There we switchbacks but some hard rocky areas. 
The view at the top of Standing Indian Mountain was really pretty. We were going to camp just below the summit in a rhododendron grove but it was too cold and windy so we hiked further. We got Trail magic at Deep Gap!  A doughnut. So good!
Got into camp and it is another bitter cold night.","Bly Gap
",Beech Gap,"Mar 31, Sun",12.10
Mosey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609463,"it was very cold last night but I wore three layers on top and was ok. Not cozy warm but pretty good. 
It was a very pleasant hike all morning. We took a long break at a beautiful spot. I ate my morning oatmeal. Since I didn’t bring a stove I eat everything cold. In the morning I put carnation instant breakfast and collagen powder in my water bottle and sip that as I walk.  Before I leave camp I add some water, powdered milk and chia to my oatmeal and usually eat that late morning. Then I have a granola bar late afternoon. For dinner I have ramen or instant mashed potatoes soaked with cold water and a piece of chocolate. 
After our break we came to a “green tunnel “. It is made of rhododendrons. This one was exceptionally pretty. 
We came down into Mooney Gap and had trail magic!  A beer!
Next we had a very hard climb to Albert Mountain Fire Tower. The climb reminded me of the Whites in New Hampshire. But up in the tower the views were 360 degrees. So amazing. 
From there was a very pleasant hike to camp. The water hole here is like an oasis. Very pretty. Again it’s very cold so I’m in my tent early. 
This was my favorite day yet!!!","Beech Gap
",Long Branch Creek Shelter,"Apr 01, Mon",11.90
Mosey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609464,"Another cold night and morning. It was a pleasant hike but snowing. We stopped at a shelter for water then started climbing. When we came down into Winding Stair Gap there was trail magic!  Root beer, cuties and a phone charge!  It was so cold and she was just standing out there waiting for hikers!
We crossed a main road and there was a small really pretty waterfall. 
Next we had more climbing up to Silar Bald  I should have gone up to the view but didn’t. 
We didn’t stop enough today and I was really struggling. But we got to our campsite and it was real nice with picnic tables. I pitched my tent in a cozy little rhododendron grove. 
The Colonel made me hot chocolate tonight. I think he feels sorry for me not getting warm food. So far I’m doing ok with it and I’m sure it will be even better when it’s warm. 
It’s another cold night so in my sleeping bag at 5:30.","Long Branch Creek Shelter
",Wayah Crest Picnic Area,"Apr 02, Tue",13
Mosey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609468,"it was a beautiful hiking day today. The usual ups and downs, but sunny and in the 40’s. 
We took a really long break at Wayah Bald Tower. It is an old stone tower and had clear 360 degree views. 
We had a long hard climb to our campsite but it is a nice site near the top of Copper Ridge and the sunrise should be awesome. 
Another cold night in the 30’s.","Wayah Crest Picnic Area
",Cold Spring Campsite ,"Apr 03, Wed",10
Mosey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609549,"We thought today was going to be an easy day because there was very little climbing and the trail went down all day long. But straight down is hard!  The total descent today was 3000 feet and that doesn’t include when we had to go up just to come back down. 
When we got to Tellico Gap there was trail magic in a Tupperware container. The Colonel got a jar of peanut butter and some MRE pop tarts for us. Not much but we sure enjoyed them!  It doesn’t take much to make us happy. 
Next we climbed up to Wesser Bald observation tower. We took a break and the views were pretty. From there it was down, down, down. It felt like my brakes were on the whole time.  For a while we walked along the spine with drop offs on both sides and some rock maneuvering. Part of that was a point called The Jumpoff that was just crazy!  Just a rocky point hanging out over the air. 
We finally got to camp and because it’s supposed to rain tonight we thought about staying in the shelter but 5 young people showed up so we let them have it and we pitched our tents. We’ll be packing up muddy gear tomorrow!  My tent is set up next to a stream that sounds so pretty. I also just realized that there is a tree root right under me too. I thought I’d missed them all. Oh well  
Another great day in the Appalachian Trail!","Cold Spring Campsite

Mosey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609743,It rained all night and all morning so I had to pack up a very muddy tent. It was only a one pleasant mile hike to the NOC. We went to the general store where we had coffee while we waited for Henry to pick us up. We also got our Smokies permits printed. Henry drove us to Franklin NC to the Hampton Inn. We got cleaned up and went to Outdoor 76 where Rob worked with me on my toe problems. Basically my boots are a size too small so I now have a size bigger Brooks Cascadias. Sure hope they help with the pain!We had a nice dinner at the Root & Barrel. ,"Rufus Morgan Shelter

Mosey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610022,"Henry dropped us off at NOC about 8:45. It was sprinkling as we started hiking. It soon stopped but was very warm and humid. I was sweating like crazy and had to stop to take off my winter leggings and hike in my skirt only. 
At first the climb didn’t seem too bad but it just kept getting harder and harder. We took a short break then started the climb to Cheoah Bald. Tough!!  We rested a bit then headed the final 2.5 miles to our campsite. We got to camp and set up and ate. Just as I got in my tent it started to rain. I also discovered that this site is on a slant and I’ll be sliding off my pad all night. Oh well!
I had no foot pain today!  Even though I don’t love the shoes, I guess they are keepers!","Nantahala Outdoor Center

Our plan was an 11 mile day to Cable Gap Shelter but when we got there Sweetwater said he was going all the way to Fontana and we could stay if we wanted. That meant an additional 5.5 miles. I knew I shouldn’t but I agreed to continue on. It was very tough. A big tough climb and muddy and slippery going down. I was climbing up a boulder and slipped back down, falling back on my pack. I scraped my arm but it could have been worse I didn’t have enough calories or rests to do this kind of day I barely made it","Locust Cove Gap

I got everything packed up as much as I could then we had breakfast at the lodge then walked down to do our laundry. Lots of hikers down there sitting on the porch. We sat around talking while waiting. When the post office opened at 11:45 we got our food resupply and took the shuttle back to the trail. We walked over the Fontana Dam then began climbing into the Smokies. It was tough with our packs carrying 6 days of food. There was a .1 trail u to Shuckstack Tower that we took without our packs. I didn’t climb to the top of the tower because it looked too rickety.

Mosey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610284,"Since I struggled so much yesterday I laid in my tent trying to figure out what to do. I knew my pack weight was part of the problem. I had one bar on my phone and was able to message someone from a women’s group. She was able to find someone to help me. Without even knowing me he drove two hours each way to meet me at Clingmans Dome. He brought us sodas, fruit pies and tangerines. He took some of my cold weather clothes, my camp shoes and my bear canister to mail home. And he loaned me a bear bag. And wouldn’t take any money. Now that is amazing trail magic. He text me later and said he had taken 5 pounds 1 ounce from my pack. I couldn’t believe how much better it felt. We couldn’t see anything from Clingmans Dome because it was raining. It was kind of a yucky day but we hiked most of the day through forest that was so pretty with miss growing on everything. We took a break a Newfound Gap. A couple people asked about what I am doing and said it was so cool. We are tenting outside the Shelter and could possibly have an amazing sunrise view if the weather cooperates. ","Double Spring Gap Shelter

Another hiker, Mellow, offered to give us a ride. She was being picked up at the 40 underpass. They dropped us off at a hotel where we got a shower, a good meal and laundry done.

That helped a little.  About 6 I put them on and crawled in my sleeping bag.  At 6:15 I decided to start packing up. We didn’t have a long hike but the hostel was then .7 from the trail. It’s a nice hostel. She did our laundry for $7. Then I took a wonderfully hot shower. I still didn’t warm up all day.

This is what we would have had to camp in if we hadn’t stayed at the hostel. Snow covered everything and the trees were covered in ice that would fall on us when the wind blew. The trail was a muddy mess. It made it tough to walk. Then we came to come crazy terrain at Firescald Knob.

But also at the Gap were the police, forest service, and a tv reporter. I guess there is a manhunt out for the psycho guy. Sure hope they catch him!

They also informed us that the psycho was caught and arrested at Sam’s Gap some time after we left yesterday. 
I tripped over a root and fell flat on my face. Surprisingly I’m just scratched and bruised.

When we got back we started the hard climb up to camp  we filtered water,  set up camp, ate dinner and now I’m settling down for the night.","No Business Knob Shelter

Mosey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611481,"I left camp by 6:45 and we didn’t get to the summit until noon. I thought we were never going to get there. It sprinkled off and on today but it was more refreshing than anything  
I met some YouTubers “It’s who we are”. They are a nice couple. 
We stopped at a shelter for a break and when talking to Patches I discovered it was her yellow raincoat I picked up!
We are camped in a version old Apple orchard. There are a few trees but it is mostly a huge field of beautiful wild flowers. 
It wasn’t a great day today. I struggled all day. Just no energy.","Curley Maple Gap Shelter

Mosey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611612,"Today started out ok. It was cool and cloudy which is really ok for hiking weather. It sprinkled off and on but no big deal. I came to a shelter about 8:45 but it had stopped raining and was early so I didn’t stop. About 1/2 mile later it started pouring. I stopped and put on my rain gear. As I hiked I got wetter and colder. But it was raining so I didn’t want to stop and take off my backpack to add a layer. I knew I was coming soon to a Gap and I thought there was a road so I was just praying there would be some way for me to get out of the rain to add layers. As I came down the hill I saw a canopy tent. Trail magic!!!  There was nobody there but there was a camping tent next to it and I figured they were sleeping. So I went into the canopy, layered up, sat in one of the chairs and ate a granola bar. Pretty soon I heard voices so I called out to let them know I was sitting in their tent. Em and Silver Lining came out. They were awesome!  He made me coffee and a cheeseburger. By then other hikers started showing up. It was the best trail magic ever on such a horrible day. 
We left to start the 4 mile climb up Roan Mountain. It was pouring and the wind was blowing sideways.  The trail was a muddy mess. Muddy water squished out of my shoes as I walked. And it just kept getting worse. By the time we reached the summit it was sleeting. 
We had intended to camp near the Roan Mountain Shelter but decided it would be too cold so we headed to a campsite 4.4 miles away. As we hiked it became apparent that the weather wasn’t improving so we decided to get out at Carver’s Gap and get a ride to Roan Mountain TN. 
When we got there I couldn’t believe Kim (try try) was there!  I’m shocked that I caught up with her. She got a ride from some people that were there. There were 2 guys in a truck and The Colonel asked them for a ride but they said they were going hiking. He told them about the weather on the mountain and advised them not to but they were determined. In the meantime 4 of us were crammed in the restroom trying to warm up. Eventually the 2 guys decided not to hike and offered us a ride. They to us to a hostel but they were full. I was so cold that I was shivering uncontrollably. Sweetwater found us another hostel and they came to get us. So we are at Station 16E. I got a hot shower, laundry is done, fish & chips for dinner, and I’m settling down for the night. 
The plan tomorrow is to slack pack the 14.8 miles from Carver’s Gap to Roan Mountain TN.

Mosey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611683,"Today was a gorgeous day, sunny, cold and windy. We were dropped off at Carver’s Gap by the shuttle about 8:30. It was a nice hike. We crossed over three balds. We stopped at a shelter for a short break then moved on. I was in front and quickly lost the guys. I knew they were more than 1/2 mile behind me so I decided to truck on. 
I climbed Little Hump and once at the top saw Hump Mountain in the distance and could tell that was going to be the big challenge of the day. It was a long climb with great views at the top. Once leaving the top it was 6 miles DOWN. and a lot of it was boulders which are just awful to hike on and over. But I made it to 19E about 2:45. Henry arrived about half an hour later and picked me up. He picked up the guys too when they got done. 
We are all staying at Mountain Harbour. 
Isaac, my grandson came with Henry and the will be hiking and camping with me tomorrow and Monday.","Carver’s Gap

Mosey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611858,"Henry, Isaac, and I had a big breakfast at the B&B, said goodbye to The Colonel and Sweetwater, and started hiking. Isaac did really great for his first backpacking trip. He enjoyed the views, water crossings, and other hikers passing by. 
Jones Falls were beautiful, much bigger than I thought they would be. We took our lunch break there. 
Not much later we were walking along the river and found a perfect campsite for the night. It was early but I didn’t want to push Isaac. We set up camp and he got our campfire all ready. Then he played in the river in his undies for a while. 
We ate dinner, my first hot dinner on trail since Henry brought our stove, then enjoyed the fire before an early bedtime.","Mountain Harbour B&B

Mosey,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612020,"It was one of three gorgeous days we had last week. I was hiking along and it just came to me, “I’m done”. I had gotten to the point, despite the ups and downs, literally and figuratively, that I was doing well on the hike. No more doubts about whether or not I could do this. The change was that I no longer wanted to. I was missing my family and my life.  We had already planned for Henry and Isaac to hike with me so I decided it made sense for that to be the end of my hike. And it just happened to be the same day I would pass 400 miles. I feel so happy and proud to have accomplished what I did, and I’m content to end it there. I’m glad I did the hike and feel that I got everything out of it that I wanted. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done and an amazing experience, but I’m finished with my Appalachian Trail hike.",,View Entry,"Apr 29, Mon",0
