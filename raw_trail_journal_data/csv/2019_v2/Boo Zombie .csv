Boo Zombie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606631,In 2018 decided I wanted to hike the 105 miles of the AT in Shenandoah National Park.  I found out my Niece Rampaige was doing a thru hike north bound starting March 21.  I ended up meeting up with her and the people she was hiking with at James River Bridge in Virginia first time in May and last time in Killington Vermont in July.   I first met Prophet at Dulles Airport when he flew out to get back on the trail in Harpers Ferry on May 28 with Rampaige and Minnesota.  He had gotten off the trail  in Buena Vista Virginia a couple weeks before. I said I would hike the part missed with him when he came back after summiting Katahdin.  He summitted August 3rd.  We started hiking August 8th.  I will talk about that in journal entry 2.,,View Entry,"Jan 27, Sun",0
Boo Zombie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606666,Prophet and Minnesota  summitted Katahdin August 3 and took the bus to Washington DC August 6.  I started my section hike August 8th. Dropped Prophet off at Buena Vista route 60 and me 8 miles north. I did not want to do Bald Knob and the Priest on first day.  Minnesota hiked SOBO to the Priest shelter after parking car and we all stayed at the shelter on the Priest the first night. Day 2 hiked down the priest and did the 3 ridges. Mini picked us up at the road to Devils Backbone and we camped there after enjoying the brewery.  Day 3 we entered Shenandoah National Park. We got a campsite for 3 nights at Loft mountain.  We were able to slack pack since Mini would drop us off and pick us up each day.  Prophet was ahead of me so she had 2 different drop off and pick ups each day.  After day 6 of hiking we drove the hour to my house and took the next day off. We started back up a Thorton Gap route 211.  I had to skip 19 miles to catch back up. We had planned on staying in shelters next 3 days but we made such good time each day we came back to my house since it was never more than 90 minute drive on this stretch. Hey it was August and I have a pool in my backyard.  Air Conditioning and showers were a bonus as well. Plan on doing the same this year if I am fortunate enough to make it that far.  Ended up finishing August 19 in Harpers Ferry.  I had to skip ahead 9 miles one day to catch back up so we could both finish on the same day.  It was great to hike into Harpers and be with someone that was completing the 2190 journey.  Next journal entry will be about the times and places I met my niece while she was on the trail.  A month from today I drive south to start the journey.               From Facebook post after hike                    Finished my hike on Appalachian Trail Sunday in Harpers Ferry. 11 days and 144 miles on the trail. Fell 2 times. 1 blister and 1 bee sting. Zero ticks. Hit hundreds of  webs. Usually right in the face. Saw 7 Bears all in Shenandoah National Park. Also saw deer turkeys chipmunks owls squirrels hawks rabbits and all kinds of other birds and tons of butterflies. I had a great time. Some days I hiked hours with out seeing a person and would catch up with my group at end of day. Thanks to Prophet and Minnesota (trail names) for hiking with me.,,View Entry,"Jan 28, Mon",0
Boo Zombie ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607045,"2 weeks from today I head south to Springer.   Rampaige will be flying out from Colorado to hike the first 30 days with me.  After that she will fly to California to start the PCT to finish her triple crown. I am very fortunate to have her to start with.  I had a great time last year following her on the AT.  I would get Spot Me GPS emails to let me know where she was each night.  She started with a friend and they hiked together until Hot Springs. The next 500 miles she was pretty much on her own. We picked her up the first time at James River Bridge for a couple days off at my house.  Dropped her back off and met next time at Southern Entrance of Shenandoah National Park.  Now she was hiking with Minnesota and they came to my house for a day off.  After completing SNP and making it to Harpers Ferry they came back to my house again for a day off.  Prophet Flew to Dulles airport joined them at Harpers.  I told them I would get a condo in Delaware Water gap and meet them in a couple weeks.  I met them at Wind Gap PA first day.  But now the group had grown to 8.  Tiger Lilly, Captain Ahab,  Tortoise, Mr Bean & Zebra.  They slacked packed 3 days than took a zero day. After dropping them off about 20 miles into New Jersey I had the condo for one more day.  The gang had left me a thank you note with words of encouragement about me hiking the AT.  That was the day I realized that I have to do this.  All 8 of these people finished in August 2018.  I met up with them again a month later in Killington Vermont. Minnesota and Prophet were ahead of the group since they skipped the Zero days the others took to go to Captain Ahabs house in Massachusetts.  They still had 8 people because now they had Donut and Thunder who also finished in August.  It was an amazing time just being a trail angel to the gang.  I got to see and smell what it is like to be Thru hiker (hiker trash).  Looking forward to starting March 2 and meeting lots of new people on the trail.                                      ",,View Entry,"Feb 14, Thu",0

I hope the Altra fit because everyone that wears them seems to love them. If not the last pair of Salomon lasted 400 miles which is good since I am heavier than the average hiker and seem to kick everything.  Great to be home and rest up for a few days.   Thanks to all the people that signed by Guest book with words of encouragement.
