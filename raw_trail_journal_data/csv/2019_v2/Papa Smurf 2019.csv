Papa Smurf 2019,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606405,"I know exactly when and where I was when I made the decision to attempt a thru hike.  It was July 2015 at the outfitter in Damascus VA with my father and my sister in-laws husband Johnny (trail name ""Chief"").  We had been riding the mountain road in NC and VA for most of the day and decided to stop in and visit the outfitter.  Chief has hiked the entire length of the AT, the MST and hiked several other trails.  I reminded my father that Chief had hiked the AT.  He had forgotten, as he was caught up examining all the items in the outfitter.   At that point, my father struck up a conversation with Chief about hiking.  He was making statements to him such as ""If I were younger, I sure would love to hike with you"",  ""If my legs could take it, I would hike"", ""I'm way too old to even think about hiking now"", and other statement like that.  At that point I made my decision to attempt an AT thru hike.  I told myself that I did not want to be at my fathers age making similar statements that I wished that had done something such as a thru hike attempt.  I had gotten caught up following Chief and others on their thru hike attempts back in 2001.  I thought to myself about the potential experience, but I was never too serious about those thoughts.  That is until I heard my fathers discussion with Chief.  So here I am, three years later, retired after 35 years in the corporate world, and ready to begin late February.  Wish me luck.",,View Entry,"Jan 14, Mon",0
Papa Smurf 2019,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606407,"Where did the trail name Papa Smurf come from?  That name was given to me by two separate individuals during two separate, unrelated events.   The first was back in October 2012 when I was taking a 4-day motorcycle safety class.  On the third day, one of the guys in the class called me Papa Smurf.  He said that it was because I was the oldest person in the class, I had graying hair, a full beard (at that time) and always wore a blue shirt to the classes.  We were required to wear long sleeve shirts to the classes.  For those that know me, I don't like to wear long sleeves unless I have to.  I sacrificed one of my older dress shirts for the class and wore it every day.  My camo long sleeve shirts are for hunting.
The second event occurred when one of my coworkers called me Papa Smurf at work.  She said that it was because of my graying hair/beard and because of my long time experience in the department that we worked.
I am adding 2019 to the name because I have heard of a Papa Smurf that hiked the AT in 2018.  I wanted to eliminate possible confusion.
To my family members that thought that I would take the trail name ""Frogman"", I am not taking that name because I gave that name to myself.  At least Papa Smurf was given to me by others.  Maybe not on the trail, but by two separate people.",,View Entry,"Jan 14, Mon",0

Papa Smurf 2019,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607465,"I made it to the Springer Mountain Southern Terminus today. The adventure has begun. I am staying at the Springer Mountain Shelter tonight. That means that I have hiked a whole 0.2 miles of the AT today. I hiked the Approach Trail as well. That is 8.8 miles. But that doesn’t count because it is not considered part of the AT.
Johnny (Chief) and Ed (Hot Sauce) hiked 0.9 miles from the parking lot to the Springer Mountain Shelter, set up to stay in the shelter, then packed it in and headed back to the truck. I want to thank them for picking me up at home and and driving me to Georgia. They picked me up on a 6/23/2019, we drove straight to Neels Gap to drop off my food supply so that it is available when I hike into Neels Gap 4-5 days from now. We stayed in a Motel that evening and they drove me to the visitors center so that I could register and start the Approach Trail. I was registered as NOBO hiker #283 with a pack weight of 32 lbs.

I was tired by my the time I made it to Gooch Mountain Shelter. I was greeted by two trail ambassadors named Mother Nature and Smoke Stack. After a couple of hours of conversation, I learned that they both know Chief and his friends Stumpknocker and Christmas. They shared many stories. It’s a small world, isn’t it? We also had our first trail magic. A couple that runs a local B&B stopped by the shelter and gave all of us hikers some baked scones. They were good.


I tried to give one of the guys in the group his trail name. His name is Tim. I wanted to call him “Leaf Blower”. Because he huffs and puffs so hard on the uphills that he blows all the leaves off the path. I don’t know if he will accept the name.

There were approximately 16 tents at the shelter with 4-5 people inside the shelter. I counted 6 separate tents that had “snorers” in them. It would have been 7 if I had been asleep. The loudest tent snorer was right next to my tent. Why not? The trail today wore me out. It was a 12 mile hike with some decent climbs throughout the day. Most, but not all views were obstructed by the clouds and fog.
By the way, we had our second trail magic. It was Odie. He is known for publishing the yearly hikers yearbook. He was in a modified short school bus located at Woody Gap. He handed out some fruit, candy bars, pop tarts and fruit paste. It hit the spot.

Papa Smurf 2019,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607470,"It started to rain around 6:00 AM. That meant that we all had to break camp in the rain. It was a relatively short hike today. However it was a steep climb up to the top of Blood Mountain. It is the highest mountain in Georgia on the AT and has the oldest shelter on the trail. The decent down from the top of Blood Mountain was very steep and had many, many solid rock sections that had to be managed very carefully due to the wet surfaces. No views available due to the clouds. 
Well, I got off trail on the wrong trail for the first time during my hike. I was trying to hike along the sides of the rock surfaces to avoid a slip/fall. As a result I missed a white blaze in the middle of the rock (trail). I went down hill approximately 200 yards.  I came across a sign that read “This is not the AT. Turn around and look for a blaze to your right”. It took me approximately 20-30 minutes to climb back up to the correct trail, it was that steep. I had a few choice words for that mistake.
I made it down to Neels Gap. I teamed up with Frank and Shane (two section hikers) and Dave (thru hiking) and we all split the cost of a cabin at Blood Mountain Cabins. The cost of the stay included laundry. Great deal and cheaper than staying at the nearby hostel. Laundry was not available at the hostel. We had soft drinks, chili and salad for supper at the cabin office. It was GREAT.

However, there was a handwritten sign on door stating that they could not open for breakfast until 11:00. We couldn’t wait that late to start so we fixed something in our cabin, stopped for some supplies at the outfitter and were on the trail 10:15. It rained the entire time we were hiking.Have you ever seen the Seinfeld episode about the Soup Nazi where he says “No soup for you”? I felt like Mother Nature was like the View Nazi. Saying “No view for you”. Due to the clouds and the rain, there were no views at all today. Oh well, we can try again tomorrow.We decided not to go to Whitley Gap Shelter because it was 1.2 miles off the trail. We didn’t want to add an additional unnecessary 2.4 miles miles to our hike.

Frank (Tank), Shane (Physical) and I started to break down camp starting around 6:00 AM. We were leaving our stealth site around 7:45 AM. It was very windy and foggy. The fog cleared after approximately 2 hours of daylight. After 2 hours of hiking I ran into Dave (Helluva) heading south bound. After I said good morning to him he realized that he had been hiking in the wrong direction, for the last 1.5 miles. He turned around and headed back in the correct direction. He had accidentally added 3 miles to his day. Needless to say, he cursed himself a few times.
I reached the Blue Mountain Shelter by mid afternoon. It was a good hike, but it took absolutely everything out of me. I forced down my supper and prepared for bedtime.

He has been offering trail magic to hikers for the past 5 years. He had teamed with the Crawford Family to set up for trail magic. If you are not familiar with the Crawford’s, they thru hiked the AT last year as a family of eight (8), and I followed their adventure on YouTube. The trail magic was great! Blueberry pancakes, mixed fruit, eggs, sausage, yogurt, coffee and juice. We were forced to eat all we could eat and then some.

We all got our resupply taken care of, rested and ate better food. Ian got a shuttle into town and got a haircut. 
Later in the afternoon the winds were so strong that it knocked out the power at the motel we're in. To give an example of how generous people have been, one of the guys in a room a few doors down offered ""Captain Handy"" and I the use of his pickup truck to take down the hill in the rain to pick up drinks from the convenience store. With no power and the heavy rains, we took him up on his offer. The guy was doing maintenance work on some of the rooms at the motel and simply offered his work truck to us “total strangers”. That doesn’t happen every day in real life (in the matrix).
We were told that the power should be back on later tonight around 11:00 pm. I hope that it comes on earlier so that I can get my phone fully charged.

Before starting the hike, we stopped inside the Brushy Mountain Outpost and had a nice hot breakfast. The hike itself was not too bad today. We were well rested, had a good breakfast and the wind and cooler temperatures made for a pleasant day. We made it over the 600 mile point today! 
While hiking I unknowingly stepped on a snake. I would not have even known that I did, except ""Captain Handy"" saw me step on the snake and said that it didn’t move like a normal stick. I watched it slither off as ""Captain Handy"" pointed it out to me. I am glad that it was only a garter snake. That makes five snakes that I have seen on the trail.

It turns out that he had picked up a new born bunny rabbit. Something had attacked the bunny and it was not going to survive. He tried nursing it for a while, but it didn’t make it. He found a total of six dead rabbits. We are not sure what attacked them and just left them there by and on the trail.
We had an uphill climb prior to lunch. Upon reaching the top, you had a clear line of sight into West Virginia.

We ate lunch at the Keffer Oak. I am glad that we did because it was above 80 degrees and we had a second long uphill climb. This second climb totally took all my remaining energy. I stopped multiple times to drink water to stay hydrated. The ridge walk was filled with large rock slabs. All the slabs tilted at 45 degrees making my feet slid constantly inside my shoes. While reaching the summit for this ridge walk it started to thunder and lightning. Before I could get off the ridge after 3-4 miles it started to rain.

I felt sluggish from the start of the day. As hill climbs and the heat increased, the more drained I felt. I think that I have made the right decision to shorten my hiking day.
Captain Handy was leaving the shelter with his water supply as I arrived. I informed him of my plans to stay at the shelter. It is not likely that I will meet up with him again. He finishes his section hike Sunday and will be flying back to Florida. I will miss his company. He was a wealth of trail knowledge as he has completed section hikes of the entire AT and has completed some sections twice. He was always available if I had questions about the trail.
As of today, Ian has been off the trail for a day now. He got a ride into Daleville yesterday. He is taking time to evaluate his plans for either returning to the trail, or not. We have no updates from him since he made it to Daleville.
One of the highlights of the day was visiting and paying our respects at the Audie Murphy Monument. It was located just off the trail. He was the most decorated American soldier of World War II, and later became an actor. He died in a plane crash not far from the monument, and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. I remember Mama Smurf's father saying he served in the same army infantry division as Audie Murphy.

Captain Handy and I saw a red bunting this morning. A beautiful red bird with black wings. I have only seen this type of bird two or three times in my life. Rare to see.

I am glad that I had a much shorter day planned. About two hours into the hike, I saw a man standing in the middle of the trail looking off into the woods. He said that he had just seen a bear that ran off as he approached. He said that he was canceling his day hike and was heading back to his car. I guess he did not feel comfortable with a bear in the area. 
I left the SNP today. Soon after leaving the park I was at the US 522 parking area. At that point I got a ride from a section hiker into Front Royal where I got a room at a nearby hotel.

The first notable thing I saw today was the other shelter in competition for the neatest, cleanest and best looking. There were lots of potted plants, a sun dial, welcoming signage and the cleanest privy that I have seen so far. The toilet seat actually “shined”.
Later I was looking for sticks in the middle of the trail and that mark the 2019 halfway point at mile 1,096.0. I did not see the markings in the trail. I took a Guthook GPS screenshot and I was 0.2 miles past that point. I did come across two other official halfway markers from previous years.
Next came the ""Half Gallon Challenge"". After crossing the trail’s halfway point, you are challenged to eat a half gallon of ice cream in one sitting. Me and two other hikers did our part. It was no problem. I even ordered a cheeseburger to go. That would be my supper for the evening.
Lastly I started the seven-mile hike to my final destination. However, before I got there I had to walk through two hours of heavy rain and marble/pea-sized hail. The hail was large enough for me to attempt to get next to a tree to minimize the hard impact. It covered the ground in some areas and looked a little like snow. The ground was green when it stopped, because the hail knocked off thousands of leaves from the trees. I did eventually make it to James Fry Shelter. It was my longest hiking day so far.

He shined his light in everyone's eyes looking to see if there was space available. He wound up in the front corner of the shelter. He shivered and moaned all night long. He never spoke up and said that he was in trouble or needed any help. About 3:30 am I got up for a nature call. At that time he whispered to me, asking if I had anything to help, that he was freezing. I reached into my pack and handed him my jacket. He never said anything again during the night. When everyone started stirring, he just sat in one place looking off into space. I asked him if he was doing OK, he indicated that he was fine. Without saying a word to anyone he simply left the shelter. We will likely never see him again. I believe he had an experience last night that he will never forget as long as he lives.
There were times during the hike today that required me to set aside my trekking poles and use my feet as well as my hands to climb up or down rock faces. This is preparation for what is to come. Both here in PA as well as other northern states. We moved down out of the mountains, down into open pasture land. Just prior to entering the town of Hot Springs, I set up my tent in a Backpacker Camp. There is room for many tents and a port-a-potty. I walked into town and took a shower at a nearby swimming pool and ate lunch with another hiker who was from the Netherlands. Several tents are set up in the area tonight.

Being muddy made it slippery in many areas. Other than the mud, the trail had it’s fair share of rocks, pasture land walking and marshy/swampy areas. Some of the marshy areas on trail had wooden boardwalks, which made travel through these areas much easier and enjoyable. 
I came to a wooden deck on trail. Atop this observation deck I could easily see on the nearby mountain. This is the highest point in NJ.  
Around lunchtime, I hiked into Unionville, NY and had my lunch and resupply at the General Store and Deli. (I also bought a sub sandwich for supper later this evening and it was good.) 
Later in the afternoon I made it to Pochuck Mountain Shelter where I set up my tent and went through my routine. All the hikers at the shelter this evening are new to me. Several weekend hikers and a few Flip-Flop Hikers.

Again, I like to get up early and take advantage of the cooler temperatures. Hiking over swamps was the highlight for today. We had the usual boardwalks over the wetlands. There was one stretch where the boardwalks were elevated approximately four to five feet above the swampy waters, which made for easy walking. However, there was no shade and the sun beat down on you the entire boardwalk experience. There was also a suspension bridge that went over the Pochuck Creek and made for easy hiking in these sections.
While I was at a stream getting water for the remainder of the day, two guys walked up and asked me if they were hiking in the north direction. I told them, no, it was back in the direction they came from. They had been hiking 3.5 miles in the wrong direction. They were out hiking for the week and had taken precious time off of their schedule to start their journey. I saw them later in the afternoon at the Wawayanda Shelter where I was set up for the evening. They said the time lost today should not interrupt their schedule too much. They are from Tennessee and Illinois, and grew up in the New Jersey and New York areas. They were looking for better tools (maps) to help them on their hike, so I showed them the AWOL Guide and Guthook app that I use to aid me during my hike. They are strongly considering getting either one or both of these items. 
My tent is set up and I am going through the chore activities for the afternoon. The camp is almost full. The shelter is full and all the tent sites are taken. Crowded with thru hikers (NOBO, Flip-Floppers, Section Hikers & Week-Long Hikers), it feels unusually crowded.

I quickly reached a well known location on the trail called the ""Lemon Squeezer"", a narrow passage between two split rock faces. The passageway was so narrow that I had to remove my pack and place it ahead and above at this location. ""Bluegrass"" came along just after I made it through. He had no issues as he was carrying a small day pack. Within ten yards we had to do a cliff face rock scramble. No trekking poles or pack during this brief climb.
Within less than half-mile we came to a huge buck, still in velvet--at least an eight-point. Only the second buck seen on trail and by far, the largest. Another two or three doe were seen throughout the day.

Before we even reached that destinatiion we ran into a guy at the first road crossing with food and drinks. He was a professional photographer and asked if he could take pictures and email them to us. While we were there, we were joined by ""Mountain Do"" and his wife.

They tried to force more food and drinks at us as we were leaving.
We later saw jugs of water at a road crossing. Due to the dark water color and quality of water in NY streams, it has been common to come upon water at many road crossings.
Later we crossed the New York/ Connecticut state line. Just behind the sign was a message and a cooler filled with soft drinks. The message welcomed us to the state of Connecticut. Another state complete--9 of 14! 
Less than a mile later we came to a sign for more trail magic. It was a husband and wife set up with a grill, handing out pulled chicken sandwiches with celery sticks and carrots. We each got an additional sandwich to take with us for the evening.

By early afternoon I was at Stewart Hollow Brook Shelter. I was sitting at the picnic table talking with Ben, a flip-flop hiker, and we both heard a sound right next to the table where we were sitting.

We decided that it was early enough and cool enough after a few light rain showers that we would push another five miles to a camp site. If we felt good at that point we might push even further (another three miles) to get off at Toymakers Deli and set up tents in their backyard. As it turned out, we did push on further.
The Toymakers Deli was closed but they did allow us to set up tents. They had the basics, water, electrical outlets to charge stuff and picnic tables. The owners were very nice.
The excitement for the evening involved skunks. The owners said that they had two skunks living under their storage building. They were expected to come out around dark. Well about an hour before dark, the neighbor's skunk showed up, ate the cat food and went under the storage building. We all ate our supper and I finished setting up inside my tent. I went back to the picnic table and was checking the weather forecast when I heard “Lucked In” making some strange grunting sounds. He was trying to warn me to stand back. He had a skunk sniffing his feet and he didn’t want to move or talk. He simply didn’t want to startle the skunk. After a few minutes of checking things out, the skunk left and returned to the storage building. “Lucked In” could not believe it. This was the first time that he had ever seen a skunk in the wild. And the first thing that happens to him is the skunk comes up to him and sniffs his feet. Just a little too much excitement for his first encounter. He is cowboy camping this evening.

However, this brand was more comfortable than what I had been wearing. My next challenge was to mail the other shoes home. I spoke with a police officer in town and he recommended a small business near the outfitter that could help me coordinate the shipment to my home address. After that was complete, we called for the shuttle pickup to Green Mountain House Hostel. There were five of us waiting for the pick up. It was a very clean and well managed hostel. The owner was out of town, but it was being well taken care of. It was a great opportunity to get myself and my clothes cleaned up. Some in the group got their hair cut by fellow hikers.

Very near the summit of this first mountain it was hand and foot climbs along a huge rock face.

The hike today had the usual climbs and descents. However, we had all our gear and a full resupply. A much heavier pack and more difficult terrain today.
The trail was constantly presenting rocks or roots, or both rocks and roots. This occurred all day, and the roots are really slippery if wet or damp. It had rained last night and threatened to rain the entire morning, but it never did thank goodness. There were stretches of trail over bogs or muddy sections, which usually had wooden boards or tree planks to walk on. Most of these planks are old, and many were broken and not safe to walk on.
The skies cleared in the afternoon and the views were very nice. By late afternoon, I arrived at Sabbath Day Pond Lean-to. There was not much daylight left to get all my chores done before it got dark. Time to finish this journal entry and get ready for bed. Good night all.","South Arm Road

I was able to take a few pictures after clouds passed, but the clouds were a constant all morning. It did clear up by the afternoon.

It was nice that we only had to hike it for just a few minutes and then it was done. For the first half of the hike it was relatively easy to handle. After eating lunch at Carl Newhall Lean-to it got a little more challenging, but nothing we could not handle. There were four mountain summits we had to tackle today: Gulf Hagas, West Peak, Hay and White Cap. Approximately 300-400 yards after summiting Gulf Hagas Mountain, I was approached by a hiker from the southbound direction and he told me that there was a moose up ahead. Sure enough there was a cow moose approximately 20 yards off the trail in some thick brush. She simply stood in one place and looked around as we talked and took pictures. Because of the thick brush, I could not get a good angle for pictures. At one time I was within 15 yards of her. I finally got to see a moose, up close too!

We hiked up and over the remaining mountains. At the summit of White Cap Mountain there was a side trail that presented northbound hikers their first viewing of Katahdin.

The first mile was easy with a gradual uphill grade. I came upon the crossing for Katahdin Stream. The bridge that is normally in place had been washed out in rain storms a couple of weeks ago. The choices were to rock hop to the opposite bank, ford the stream or take the bypass routine that was in place until the bridge could be replaced. I chose to ford the stream because the rocks were spaced wide apart and the bypass is not officially part of the AT. Shortly after the stream crossing, the grade got a little steeper. At the point where we were above tree line, the trail went vertical. This lasted for over one mile. There were points where rebar had been installed to aid with the climb. Many points required that you lift your entire body weight with your arm strength up and over ledges. This was slow and physically challenging. You could see clearly at this elevation, but could also see that the summit was engulfed in cloud cover. After a period of vertical climbing, things were less physically demanding, but were still uphill climbs. At this point, we were in the cloud layers. After walking for approximately a mile, I could see the outline of the Katahdin summit sign with a couple of people walking around. As I approached the sign, I asked someone what time it was. They told me that it was 9:22 am. So here are the stats:
After 189 days of hiking, I have COMPLETED my 2,192.0 mile thru hike of the Appalachian Trail. COMPLETE on 8/31/2019 at 9:22 amStarted 2/24/2019 at Springer Mountain Georgia (includes the Approach Trail)Ended 8/31/2019 at Mt Katahdin Maine
Because of our experience climbing up to the summit, several of us chose to take the Abol Trail down the mountain. At the bottom we had a two mile road walk back to Katahdin Stream Campgrounds. We got a ride from a park ranger the last mile. A thru hiker named ""Chocoholic"" took us from Baxter State Park into the town of Millinocket, where we checked in at the AT Lodge. ""Chocoholic"" will likely shuttle us into Bangor Maine tomorrow.

Papa Smurf 2019,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625146,"Well it has been three months since I completed my thru hike on 8/31/2019.  I figure that is enough time to provide proper post trail feedback and officially close out this journal for this adventure.  It was a really good feeling to arrive at the Raleigh/Durham airport and see my family (my son, wife and mother) to greet me when I set foot back in North Carolina.  I had no problems settling in back at home.  The immediate and constant issue that I had to deal with was hiker hunger.  During my time on trail I had lost approximately 72 lbs.  I did look like someone that had been starving in one of those concentration camps seen in WWII photos and videos.  I knew from reading other journals and YouTube videos that most that return from the trail gain all their weight back and pack on additional pounds as a bonus.  I don’t want to return to my original weight, so to help me with that effort I joined a local gym and have continued long walks (7-10 miles) four to five times per week.  The only problem with the longs walks is the flat land where I live in the eastern part of NC.  As of this last journal entry, my hiker hunger slowed after three weeks and I have gained back over 20 lbs.  The weight gain has slowed but not stopped.  I have more work to do to keep that under control.  I also had multiple doctor and dental visits to take care of when I returned.  For the first two months back, I felt like I was either at a doctor’s office or a dentist’s office.  I still have more work to be done on a dental implant.  I had the tooth extracted a few months prior to starting my thru hike, and the surgeon felt that putting in the implant just prior to me starting my hike might be risky should I have complications while on the trail.  So, we waited for my return to proceed with the implant.  Everything is healing well as of this time.Approximately three weeks after returning home, my wife and mother threw me a celebration party.  It was very nice.  We had a house filled with family.  I had heard from my wife and mother that several people had questions about my hike that they could not answer.  So, I thought that would be a good setting to get questions answered.  For those that know me well, they know that I am not a big talker.  However, during this session, I would not shut up.  A few family members stated they had never heard me talk so much for as long as they had known me.  I enjoyed sharing my hiking journey. On a similar note, my wife and mother had contacted the local newspaper about my hike.  They had never heard of anyone taking on such a journey and thought that the newspaper might want to interview me about the hike.  Well they did.  It was a full page in the paper with a few of the pictures that I shared.  These smaller towns must be desperate for news, I guess.One of the questions that I get routinely is, “will I do it again?”, or “when is my next thru hike?”.  I don’t think that I will ever do a hike of that length again.   That was too long to be away from home.  I could, however, see doing a shorter thru hike of 200-300 miles, that might be 1-2 months in duration.  That is more reasonable.  I plan on joining Tank and Physical during their section hike in NC in early 2020.  I met Tank and Physical when they were hiking the same section in Georgia.  They also took me to breakfast, resupply and a town trip one morning when I was in Pennsylvania.  Tank also picked me up and helped me with a town visit at his place when I entered New Jersey.  These guys have been really good friends.My favorite part of the thru hike was meeting all the great people and visiting the smaller towns along the way.  The mountain scenes were great, but the people made the adventure.  I think about the fact that in the 189 days that I was on the trail, I stayed in a different location each day, except those days when I took a zero.  I also ate my meals in different locations each day.  On the trail I saw wildlife such as porcupines, moose, loons and pine martens.  I don’t see such animals in the area where I live.  In my earlier journal entry, I mentioned seeing an otter-like animal crossing the trail.  I could not think of what it really was, except to describe it as otter-like.  When I saw my guest book, someone asked if what I saw was a pine marten. That was it. I knew what it was, but I had never seen one in person before.  That was an unexpected discovery on the trail.I have thought about the hundreds of people that helped me along the way.  I wanted to thank each one individually, but I know that I will overlook some.  So, I want to say THANK YOU TO ALL.  It has truly been a great adventure and I am so glad that I made the decision to take on this goal back in 2015 when I overheard my father telling my brother in-law that he wished that he could have joined him back in 2001-2003 when he did his hike of the AT.  As I have stated previously, I did not want to reach my father’s age and make the same types of statements wishing that I were younger so that I could attempt a thru hike.I will single out one person that has helped the most during my hike and that is my wife (“Mama Smurf”).  She was the one person that I was in constant contact with before, during and after the hike.  She has been with me every step of the way, from afar.  She has been my support system and has actually been the one to edit and post all my journal entries and pictures into Trail Journals.  I could not have done it without you.  I love you.Happy Trails,Papa Smurf",,View Entry,"Dec 03, Tue",0
