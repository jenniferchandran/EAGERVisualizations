Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606775,"It took a little over three hours for Mark and myself to drive to Amicalola Falls State Park. Mark had checked the place out earlier. He was very complimentary of the park and felt that it would give us a good taste of the AT. It would also give us a chance to try out some of our new gear in what was projected to be nighttime temperatures in the 30’s.
We checked in at the visitor’s center and paid five bucks for an overnight permit. We provided “next of kin” info so that they could notify our wives if we experienced a “non-planned event”. The overnight lot was located away from the paved lot near the visitor’s center near the park entrance. It was basically an extra wide gravel road that you could pull off and park on the side. We found a spot that gave some confidence that we wouldn’t get stuck and parked. We got our gear and walked down the gravel road to the paved road near the entrance. 
The trailhead was located behind the Visitor’s Center which was convenient since I am at the age where you should never pass a bathroom without using it. The park did a nice job with the trailhead entrance. A stone arch and distance signage was provided for Kodak moments which we passed up. We finally started on the trail around 12:30 or so.
The trail paralleled the road until crossing over near the lower amphitheater and followed the creek to the reflection pool. From there, the path led to the first staircase where we met a SOBO thru hiker that was finishing up. He had started his thru hike in June. He was not complementary of the stairs.

Hubris is a unfortunate human condition. For the last several years, I have supplemented my hiking hobby with regular visits to my company’s Wellness Center. I worked on strength and conditioning exercises and faithfully attended a boot camp class which regularly wore me out. I was confident that my training would prepare me for whatever the trail had to offer. Unfortunately, the brutal, seemly endless, staircase to the top of the falls caused me to be brought back to a stark reality. I was gassed. My legs were jelly and we had another seven miles of elevation climb or so to Springer. 
Perhaps memories fade; but as Mark reminded me, we had made the climb up from the Walls of Jericho several times and experienced the Rock Garden and the Stairway to Heaven on the Pinholti Trail in the pouring rain. However, it seemed that these paled in comparison to the staircase at Amicalola to me. 

The top of the falls was another nice area in the park. You can actually drive up if you didn’t want to experience the staircase. The view, which we were blessed with a clear day, was spectacular. We lingered to recover, take a photo and then continued up the trail.
The trail continued to climb towards Springer. We passed an intersection where a sign indicated the way to the Hike Inn. It is my understanding that it is a lodge similar to the one at Mt. Laconte near Gatlinburg. Continuing on, we soon encountered another SOBO that was headed towards Amicalola. He also had started in June. Mark noticed that he was wearing a pair of Keen boots and asked his opinion of them. The guy said that he liked them; but, he swapped the insoles for some Superfeet insoles. He highly recommended them.
Sometime afterwards, we met a hiker who was making her way back to Amicalola after a morning hike. She indicated that she was training for an AT thru hike starting in February to avoid the bubble of hikers that Mark and myself will be in at our March 3rd start date. She also mentioned that she was a ATC member and helped take care of a section of the trail at Hog Mountain. In our short discussion of gear, she mentioned that she would be taking a bear canister with her. She said that the ATC recommended them as bears were getting good at snapping lines of hung food bags.
The trail crossed a forest service road before beginning another climb. We walked past a plaque that memorialized a person that was killed in a plane crash a short distance away. I declined to take a picture as my phone was running out of juice. I made a mental note to make sure it is fully charged prior to heading out and bring a battery.
We encountered a number of climbs and descents before we reached the side trail to a shelter at the foot of Springer. A hiker and his dog were staying there as he had a nice fire going in the pit. We discussed camping there for the night since the sun had started going down. We decided to push on and try to make it to the summit before dark.
We only made about halfway up before we had to pull out the headlights. Hiking in the dark was not my favorite memory of the trip. We really couldn’t make out the blue blaze of the trail which slowed us further along with the narrowness of the trail. Mark was adept at identifying areas where if I fell that it would be probably be fatal. This was conveniently mentioned after we had made past the widow maker. I pointed out that, as the older brother, that he should be leading us. He acknowledged this but felt that it was his duty to train me to be the future lead dog. Besides, someone had to survive to report what happened. He uses this same lead dog excuse in the mornings which is the only other time he lets me be in front.
We finally made it to the summit where we found the plaque signifying the starting point of the AT. It took us a little while to determine that we had to go up the AT a little way to find the shelter. The shelter was inhabited by a hiker named Robert and what we found out later seemed to be 1000 mice. Robert greeted us shortly after our arrival. The mice waited until we bedding down to sleep before they made their presence known.
After eating, hanging our food bag and crawling into my sleeping bag, I was at the event horizon of sleep when one of these little terrors decided that he would rattle a wrapper he found somewhere near my head. I would swat at him and he would run off presumably with the wrapper. However, just when I almost dozed off he came back. A couple of his buddies joined in and they tussled over the wrapper. One of the ran up on my face. I swatted at them and they run off. Evidently, they stayed away long enough for me to conk out. 
The next morning Robert was the first one up. He packed up his gear and wolfed down a couple protein-type bars and headed back to Amicalola. Mark had protein bars and home and his made gorp for breakfast. He also made us some coffee. I had a freeze dried breakfast meal that I was trying out.  I was really surprised that it tasted good and was filling. Afterwards, we grabbed some water from a spring close by and hydrated up.
We packed up and headed back to the approach trail. At the Springer plaque, we met a SOBO, her mother and a friend that joined her on her hike about a week ago. The hiker and her friend were going to slack pack to Amicalola while her mother was going to hike a mile back to the trailhead parking lot and meet her at the Visitor’s Center.
They soon left us in their wake as youth, better conditioning and lighter packs enabled a quicker pace. The hike back was relatively uneventful. We met a couple of groups. Two guys on a day hike from the Hike Inn and one group of four heading to the shelter at Springer. 
We reached the park around one o’clock. We grabbed a couple of sport drinks and ice cream sandwiches after checking out at the Visitor’s Center and headed back to Birmingham.","Amicalola Falls State Park
",Springer Mountain summit,"Dec 06, Thu",9
Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606856,"I bought a new one person tent from REI to use on AT trail. Previously, I used a two man Eureka that I bought years ago when I naively thought that I could talk my wife into going backpacking with me.  She seemed to enjoy the relatively short hikes (less than six miles) around the local parks and nature preserves. However, the deal breaker was having to use the bathroom in the woods. 
The new tent had about half the weight along with half the width of the old one but had the dome-style that allows me to sit upright. I wanted to go try it out in a steady rain so the week leading up to the New Year had a rainy forecast. In fact, there were a couple of all-day frog strangler's two days before our trip. The creeks would definitely be up meaning that crossing them could be problematic. Drowning is especially a bad way to go since I probably had to do something stupid for it to happen. It would be depressing that my last thought on earth would be knowing how stupid I was to drown. 
My pack load also included a bear canister that I was considering to use on the AT.  I understand that the Appalachian Trail Conservancy was recommending their use due to an increase in human/bear encounters. I chose the Bear Assault canister as it seemed more robust than the clear plastic can that I considered.  I decorated it with both reflective tape and fluorescent tape to improve my chances of finding it after stashing it for the night. It added about three pounds that I would have to carry and consumed a large portion of my pack volume.
We parked Mark's truck at Pine Glen Campground in the Talladega National Forest.  My vehicle was parked at the Burns Trailhead where we had planned to finish after spending one night at a campsite.  As we were about to head out, we spoke to a group of three hikers that were heading west on the trail. They were on a multi-day hike from Heflin. The trailhead for our hike was located across the road from the campground entrance next to a creek.  The trail followed the creek for a while before turning left paralleling a much larger creek.  The trail was relatively flat and we made good time until we stopped for a break. Apparently, I dropped my trail guide and map somewhere along the trail. Mark agreed to stay with the pack while I struck a trot back up the trail.  I back tracked about a half mile before I decided that it was not to be found.
Naturally when I got back, Mark gave me the old ""you only had one job"" bit even though he really didn't care if we had a guide or not . I countered with pointing out that since he was the older brother it was actually his fault. He failed to provide sufficient supervision to prevent loss of vital trail intelligence. As is our custom, we continued this discussion on and off as we walked along.  I was saddened to know that I armed him with a tool that he could use at his leisure to pick at me. As such,  we would have to rely on our wits and the hope that the trail blazes would be frequent and visible.  Fortunately, our feeble wits did not have to come into play as the Pinholti is well marked.  The trail guide however, which I got from the Pinholti Trial Alliance website, would really be missed. It really helps in planning daily mileage and campsite selection.  It also lists water sources and other tidbits about the section of the trail. I truly regretted its loss. My brother probably cared less.  He would be just as happy without it.
 The trail soon came to Sweetwater Lake which was apparently at flood stage as the path disappeared into the water.  This was one of three lakes in this section that were built to control flooding. We followed the edge of the lake around to where the trail was visible again. From there, it roughly followed the swollen lake edge requiring us to make the first what turned out to be several creek crossings where we had to change into our camp/creek shoes and roll up our pants legs.  The water was cold but actually felt good on my feet and legs. We made it across with little difficulty and continued up the trail.  The path again followed the lake shore before embarking on a steady climb away from the lake.  The trail followed a ridge above a feeder creek to the lake.  It then dropped down our second creek crossing  near the Laurel Shelter where we took a break. I signed us in in the log book and read a couple of entries.  One was made by the three hikers that we met at Pine Glen.  The entry in the logbook related their experience of staying in the shelter during a thunderstorm the prior night and was signed by Snoopy, Linus and Charlie.  Evidently, it got pretty rough during the storm as Snoopy listed each time that lightning struck close by and lamented his misfortune being there.  The following entry was from someone that hiked down from the Coleman Lake trail head with his new puppy to check on the shelter. He mentioned that he assumed that the Peanuts Gang made it out as he found no bodies.  I made any entry confirming that we saw them at Pine Glen and that they were OK and headed west.
We continued on the trail until we reached the short path to Shoal Creek Baptist Church. The log church was built in 1892 and was designated a National Historic site. The Alabama Historical Society installed a marker that identified the age of the church and some of the families that attended it.  It also noted regular services were no longer held there but stated that a Sacred Harp convention was held there every year.  Nearby, a cemetery mostly contained graves that were only marked with a simple stone.  One of the marked graves was dated 1832 and another grave indicated that it contained a Confederate Soldier.
We spent quite a while there admiring the church and checking out the graves before heading back to the trail.  We met a family walking along the trail looking for the church.  After pointing them in the right direction, we moved on.  The path crossed a Forest Service Road and headed down to and followed along the edge of Coleman Lake.  We could see a fairly developed campground across the lake but chose to walk on to where we reached to Coleman lake trail head.  We took a break here an talked to an older couple that had just completed their day hike and were about to head home.  The parking area had signage indicating that a long leaf pine restoration project was across the Forest Service road.  The trail actually passed through the area so we would get a look at it.  Based on my feeble recollection of the trail guide, our campsite was about a tenth of a mile from the Coleman Lake trailhead.  We hiked on looking for the campsite until the sun started getting low on the horizon. Mark, weaponizing my misfortune of losing the guide,  remarked aloud several times as we searched for the campsite, that we sure could have used the trail guide. With false conviction, I again reminded him that it as actually his fault as he was negligent in his responsibility as the older brother.
Since we didn't want to stumble around in the dark like we did on the AT Approach trail, we decided to make camp on a ridge above the trail.  We chose not to build a fire since it appeared that rain was fixing to set in soon.  After setting up our tents and eating, I packed up our food and stashed my canister about a 50 yards away. I  wedged it against the base of a tree that I thought that I could find again.  I crawled in my tent a few minutes before the rain began to fall in earnest.  It got to be a heavy downpour at times but was not accompanied by high winds.  I went to sleep in short order.","Pine Glen Campground
",Camp Site,"Dec 29, Sat",10
Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607218,"The rain slacked
up by morning.  I had some moisture on the inside of my rain fly which
provided a few drips but otherwise no leaks. I made a metal note to apply some
water proofing to the seams before heading out on the AT. As usual, I woke up
hungry so I went to retrieve my bear canister. 
It was just where I left it the night before and undisturbed.  I
heated my last water for a freeze-dried breakfast.  Mark had some of his
protein-type bars and some of his homemade gorp.  He also heated some of
his water for coffee.  After ten years or so of hiking with my brother, I
discovered that the first thing that he looks for is coffee.  I wake up
hungry myself and look for something to eat.
After breakfast,
we packed up our gear.  We shook the water off our rain flies as best as
we could and stored them in our packs.  The temperature was in the
mid-forties so we layered up.  We also put on our rain suits with the
anticipation that it would be raining on and off most of the morning.  
Our first order
of business after breaking camp was to get water.  There was a branch just
down the hill from the trail so we didn't have to go very far.  We are fortunate
here in Alabama that there are plenty of branches, creeks and rivers.  We
found good spot where the water was clear and topped off our bottles after
drinking our fill.  I brought some aqua tabs in case we encountered nasty
looking water. However, the mini-filter is my preference.  Mark prefers to
treat his water.
We climbed back
up the hill to the trail and headed out.  The path followed the branch for
some time until it veered towards a large creek where we passed the campsite
that we were looking for yesterday. We only needed to have walked another 500
to 750 feet.  Mark used this as another
opportunity to remind me that we could have used the trail guide that I
lost.  I reminded him that it was
actually his fault as he was the older brother and he should have maintained
proper supervision. 
The trail
gradually descended to the creek where we had our first crossing of the
day.  We found a spot where the water
would stay below the knee and changed into our camp/creek crossing shoes.  We crossed over without any problems and changed
back into our boots.  The trail meandered
back and forth across the creek requiring several additional crossings until the
start of a climb to the ridge of the hollow. 

Several large
trees in this area were blown down in the same direction evidently losing a
battle with straight line winds. We took a break and pondered what it would be
like to be caught out there in that storm with multiple trees falling down around
us.  It didn’t appear that there was any
protective cover close by so we concluded that it the best you could do is
hunker down close to one of the fallen trees. We agreed that that circumstance
would certainly diminish our enjoyment of the trip.
We made the
climb and then walked on the ridge for a while until Choccolocco Lake came into
view.  The path then followed the ridge
above the shoreline until it crossed the dam. 
We got a nice view of the swollen lake and could see water being
released through what looked like a 36” diameter ductile iron pipe.  The water was basically blowing out of the
end of the pipe so I didn’t go look to see if it was an ACIPCO pipe. 
After crossing
the dam, we came across a sign that indicated a shelter was located down a side
trail.  We decided to go take a look at
it and take break before we headed on Burns trail head.  The shelter was very nice and had picnic table
along with a large fire ring.  We
observed signage indicating that the National Forest Service, Cleburne County City
of Heflin contributed to it being built. 
Sadly, the inside walls were defaced with declarations of love, statements
that someone in particular “sux” and other inconsiderate graffiti.  I signed the log book and we headed out after
eating a snack and drinking some water.
The trail followed
the shoreline for about another quarter mile or so before it we had to make a steady
climb away from the lake. We walked about another half mile or so before we reached
County Road 55.  The trail continued across
the road.  We were expecting to see the
trail head where My Explorer was parked. 
Not one to waste an opportunity, Mark said that it would be nice if we
had the trial guide.  I don’t know if I
was tired from the hike or he finally had beaten me down but I weakly agreed
that in fact it would have been nice to have the trail guide.
Mark continued up
the trail and I walked down the road to see if I could find the entrance to the
trail head.  Mark yelled out that he
found the side trail to the trailhead and I met him at the Explorer.  We loaded up our gear and changed into our athletic
shoes. 
We then spent a
little time driving up and down the road looking for the Forest Service road to
take us back to Pine Glen Campground so that Mark could pick up his truck.  Finally, after being reminded again how
valuable the trail guide was, we found the road that we were looking for.  Fortunately, there were signs indicating the
direction of the campground.  We had to
travel fifteen miles down the Forest Service road until we got to the entrance
of the campground.  We got out to load
Mark’s gear into his truck.  The ziplock
bag containing the trail guide and Pinholti Trail map was stuck in the driver’s
side door handle.  Evidently, someone at
the campground found it and put there. 
We drove another
five miles up the forest service road to reach pavement and then headed back to
Birmingham.","Camp Site

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607529,"We took the Amtrak Crescent to Atlanta. We decided to add this to our adventure to spare our wives the trouble of driving us to the trail head and then making the 3 hour trip back to Birmingham. In addition, this was Mark’s first time to ride a passenger train.  Gale and I took the Cresent to Washington DC a few years ago in a sleeper room for one of my bucket list items.
I like traveling by train as it is relatively hassle free in comparison to air travel although way slower and usually not on time. They allow you two 50lb bags which can be checked or stored in the bins above your seat. The seats also have a huge amount of leg room.
On the ride over, we met a through hiker that traveled from West Texas on the train on his way to Gainesville, Ga. He attempted the AT hike last year an had to come off the trail near Fontana Dam due to feet issues. He said that his shoes were too small which put a lot of pressure on his toes causing them to bruise. He felt like his equipment was too heavy also. He said that his new pack weighed about 23 lbs loaded. He was going to start back on the trail where he had left off. 
We arrived at the Atlanta Station nearly an hour past the scheduled time.  The station was nice but surprisingly smaller than what I thought Atlanta’s train station would be.  We called a Checker Cab which picked us up about 10 minutes. The drive took about 20 minutes to get to the Comfort Inn in Roswell Georgia and cost us 40 bucks. We walked to a Burger King close by and got the six dollar Whopper Box. 
We booked a shuttle with AT Survivor Dave so we should be on the trail tomorrow.",,Atlanta,"Mar 02, Sat",0
Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607729,"ATSurvivor Dave picked us up at around 11:45. We would have left sooner but he was waiting on two clients from Boston, Massachusetts. We met Chris and Pete. 
Dave let us out in the Springer Mtn parking lot which is about 9/10 mile from the actual start of the trail. It had started a steady rain on the way up to the mountain so we had to break out the rain gear. We all four hiked to  the start and made pictures. Then we backtracked through the parking lot to the trail on the other side.
The rain got heavy but no wind or thunder. We walked about two miles until we reached Stover Shelter. It was around 3 o’clock and the hikers at the shelter said that there were about twenty other hikers that pressed on to Hawk Mtn shelter which was our original goal. It was still raining hard so we decided to take a spot in the shelter. 
The rain continued through most of the night. Then the wind picked up and the temperature dropped. We planned to go to Gooch Shelter the next day.","Springer Mountain

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607732,"The cold temperatures that arrived during the night froze our water bottles and anything else that got wet the day before which includes Mark’s socks and boots. The Mountain House meal was nice to have in the morning after a cold wet night. Mark made us some coffee and he had a couple of the energy bars that my daughter-in-law, Joy, made for us.We headed out intending to get to Gooch Mountain. The weather was lousy with dropping temperatures, cold wind, ice and snow. This made the footing treacherous. I slipped and fell but only hurt my pride and a small tear in my pants. Mark later slipped and twisted his knee. He used his duct tape and Leuko tape to make a support. We managed to make it to Hawk Mtn Shelter where we secured a spot and called it a day. There were twelve of us in the shelter and twelve in tents.The night was cold and windy. I put everything electronic, my water filter, and my water bottles in the sleeping bag with me to keep them from freezing. At about 11:30 I was woken by heavy automatic gun fire and explosions.

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607739,"We were some of the last leaving the shelter. However, we made a pretty good pace as Mark’s knee was not as sore. We had a couple of pretty good climbs up to Woody’s Gap. We stopped there where a group had set up a couple of tents and served hot soup, hot tea, homemade bread and cookies to the hikers. This was our first experience of “trail magic”. The soup, lentils with vegetables, was out standing. The bread and hot tea was also very good.  
An older gentleman, who seemed to be the leader of the group, told us that his group have been doing it for five years now.  He was helped by two of his granddaughters and a couple of young guys that may also be of his kin. We also admired their restored bus, a 1950 something vintage. They had made it into a motorhome.
We thanked them for the good food and company. Mark made a donation and we headed out to the trail after visiting the restroom that was there. 
We headed up what turned out to be a tough climb but had great views along several points along the way. The trail then trended down until it reached Lance Creek. It was about 4:00 when got so we decided to call it a day since we had a hard climb ahead of us.","Gooch Mountain Shelter 
",Lance Creek Campsite,"Mar 06, Wed",8
Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607744,"We spent our first night in a tent. The night was not as cold as it had been.  I actually slept better than the previous nights. I don’t know if I am more suited to sleeping in my tent than shelter or I am getting more accustomed to being away from home.We broke down our gear and got our packs ready. We both ate Mountain House meals for breakfast. I now value a hot breakfast. It certainly seems to help warm me up on cold mornings.After, refilling and treating our water bottles, we put on our packs and started on what turned out to be a long climb to Blood Mountain.We finally reached the top of the mountain around noon. We planned to each lunch at the shelter on top so we were making pretty good time despite the long hard climb and Mark’s sore knee.The shelter at the top was built by the WPA in the thirties. It was a native stone structure with two rooms and a bricked up fire place. Near by was a large boulder that you could climb up and get a spectacular view. We climbed up a sat a while. The sky was clear and temperature had gotten back into the fifties so it was relatively comfortable.I took some pictures which I will load when I can and post them. We ate some trail bars for lunch, packed up and started back on the trail. The path continued past the shelter across the mountain top. We passed several day hikers and some of the through hikers that we have been seeing everyday at shelters or camps. The path was mostly on solid rock. The white blaze signifying the trail direction was painted on the stone surface. Since ice, mud, water and combinations of the three were still present, we had to use care to keep from slipping. In some ways, going down was harder than climbing up.A large portion of the trail going down was over and around large rocks. We wondered if we ever would get out of the ice and mud. Finally, we reached a gentler slope that relatively free of ice and/or mud so we were able to make better time.We reached Neek’s Gap around 2:30 and proceeded to Mountain Oufitters to plan our resupply.After checking out the outfitter, we decided to call a shuttle to take us into town. Mark wanted some knee braces and I needed to resupply my food plus pick up a chapstick that I stupidly left at home along with some other items. We both needed new rain suit bottoms and some triple A batteries. After several tries, “Splitter” agreed to take us to Dahlonega for 50 bucks round trip. We originally asked to go to Blairsville but we agreed as there is a Walmart in Dahlonega.Splitter has through hiked the AT several years ago. He got his trail name by splitting wood for stay at Mountain Outfitters on his through hike.On the way, he stopped at a Dollar General so Mark could get his knee braces. Mark said they had some that he liked.He took us to a Quality Inn that had a laundry. We paid Splitter 25 bucks and made arrangements to be taken back to Neel’s Gap Saturday morning. He said that he would pick us up at 8.","Lance Creek Campsite

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607799,"After splitter dropped us off at the Quality Inn, we checked in for two nights. We got there around Five o’ clock and felt that we needed the time to wash our clothes and resupply. Mark got some change for the washer and dryer. We took our stuff to the room and pulled out our clothes and sleeping bag liners so that they could be washed. Mark went to check out the laundry room. There was no vending machine for laundry detergent so he walked to a convenience store next door and brought a small container of Tide detergent.
Mark had an extra change of clothes. I only brought a pair of shorts and that was after Gale asked what I was going to wear as my clothes were washing. 
Mark took a shower while I ordered us a large Papa John’s “The Works” pizza and a two liter Pepsi for us to split. After he got out, he went to wash a load clothes while I got a shower. 
The pizza arrived as I was getting out of the shower. I dried off and put on my one clean shirt and my pair of shorts and practically inhaled a piece of the pizza as I was pretty hungry. Neither the pizza nor the Pepsi lasted very long.
The next day we called a taxi, “Mama’s Taxi” that was recommended by the front desk. She picked us up in a minivan and took us to Walmart. The fare was six bucks.
Mark still had a bunch of food so he didn’t get anything but a jar of peanut butter. I was down to one meal so I got a small jar of peanut butter, some tortillas, two tuna creations,  one a hickory smoked and the other a spicy one. I also got a couple of the Uncle Ben’s rice ready rice bags. They didn’t have any Gatorade straws so I picked up some Propel and some Great Value “energy” straws to use in combination. 
Walmart was out of rain suits so I bought some gorilla tape to make a repair. After paying for our stuff, we bought sandwich meals from the in-store Subway. We called Mama and she picked us up a short time later. 
Mark still needed a pair of rain pants so we made a brief stop at an outfitter that she knew was on the way. Mark bought a pair of Patagonia’s and a pair of gloves. I decided that I was going to try repairing my pants first.
After dropping us off, we paid Mama and went in to eat our sandwiches. We decided basically to hang around the hotel and rest up for tomorrow.
Later, around five o’clock, I went next door to the Japanese/Chinese/Thai restaurant, “Hoka Hoka” and got an order of soba noodles with chicken and vegetables for ten bucks. It was a large portion and very good. We watched a few episodes of CSI and turned in for the night.","Dahlonega, Ga

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607823,"Splitter dropped us off at Mountain Crossings at Neel’s Gap around 9 o’clock. We put on our rain gear and packs and started towards Low Gap. 
The knee braces that Mark bought seemed to help him walk less gingerly. We started off at a pretty good pace for us and made a few climbs but none as bad as Blood Mountain a couple of days ago. The path ran along ridges which would provided some good views if it wasn’t foggy. The trail was muddy which made some areas treacherous especially down hill. We passed several gaps and had a steep climb on the way to Hogpen Gap. We got to the top and saw the trail to Whitney Gap Shelter. It was located down a blue blaze trail 1.2 miles from the AT.  When we started off this morning, we considered that we may need to stay there if we could not make it to Low Gap before dark. We didn’t want to add any extra miles to our day so we pressed on.
The path trended down more gently than when we were climbing up the Mountain. However, the muddy conditions slowed us down and Mark’s knees gave him more trouble going downhill than climbing up.
We reached Hogpen Gap where we found our second instance of trail magic. A young lady, “Shenanigans” was offering candy, water refills and Pabst Blue Ribbon beer tithe hikers. She completed the AT a few years ago and recently did the Pacific Crest Trail. She said she was planning to complete the “Triple Crown” soon but had to work some first. She was on her way to Alabama to do some caving with some friends but stopped for a day to give back for some trail magic that she received when she did the trail.
She refilled our bottles for us and Mark got a Baby Ruth and I took a Blue Ribbon a drank it while we were talking. We thanked her and wished her good luck on her upcoming “belly crawl”. She also wished us well and told us to get some carrots when we get to  New Hampshire for the wild ponies. We said that we would and continued towards Low Gap.
We had a few more ups and downs until we reached the path to the shelter. As expected, it was full so we pitched our tents. It was sprinkling and the wind started picking up but we got them up without too much trouble,
I stashed our bear kegs after eating a trail bar and a small summer sausage. I then changed into some clean and dry clothes to sleep in. Hopefully, the weather will be better tomorrow.","Neels Gap

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607863,"The rain and wind continued all night. We got up and ate a cold breakfast since the crowded shelter was a good 100 yards downhill from our campsite. We put on our rainsuits to start packing up. I taped the rips in my rain suit but it doesn’t appear the repairs will hold very long. The rain produced a lot of mud in our campsite. Despite being careful, it got on our wet tents. There was no way to clean and dry them before we packed them up. 
It finally quit raining; but the trail was still muddy which made some areas slippery.  We had to walk carefully through them to avoid falling off the trail and down a steep ravine.
Our goal for the day was the Blue Mountain Shelter 8 miles away. It was a 1000 ft elevation change from Low Gap. We had several ups and downs on the way up to the shelter. We also came across a couple of guys, Dave and Chappy, that we have been seeing on the trail since the first day. 
We got to the shelter around 2:00. We ate some lunch and considered whether to stay there or continue in and tent camp a mile or so down the trail. We consulted the trail guide and determined that there would be no real advantage since the walk to the next shelter 8 miles away was going to take us over two big mountains. We decided to rest up and attack it in the morning.","Low Gap Shelter

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607965,"We woke up later than usual so we were late getting on the trail. We had to finish climbing over Blue Mountain at 4925 feet before dropping down to Unicoi Gap at 2949 feet. Typically, this does not mean that the trail will go steadily down. There are always ups and downs between elevations whether you are going up or as    In our case going down. Also, maps show distances in linear or as the “crow flies”. The actual “hiked distance” is, for the most part, considerably longer due to switchbacks and other trail constructions that make it possible to hike trails such as these.
When we started our final descent to Unicoi Gap, we ran into muddy conditions in combination with numerous large rocks which slowed us down more than normal. One slip can end your hiking trip or worse, your life.
Mark commented, when we encountered an especially hairy area, that he would not want to pick that area to fall off the trail. I responded that I have yet to see any area where I would not sustain life threatening injuries if I fell. It seems that all of these slippy trippy areas have a several hundred feet plummet with nothing but trees and large rocks to slow you down. 
We made it down to Unicoi Gap without incident. We stopped and took off our packs and drank some water. We had a couple more mountains to cross, Rocky Mountain and Tray Mountain, before we could get to Tray Mountain Shelter.
Rocky Mountain deserved it’s name. We walked on numerous ankle braking and knee twisting rocks on the trail. It was similar to the “rock garden” on the Pinholti Trail except this trail had a much higher elevation change. Fortunately, there were several switchbacks which gave us some relief.
We got to the top and there were several nice views of the countryside. The camera on my iPhone, at least with my meager skill set, can not do it justice. We then started down and encountered more rocks, mud and roots combined with potential widow making ravines. On a trail that runs from one to two feet wide with these conditions, you can’t afford to look at the scenery while walking.
We took a lunch break at Indian Grave Gap. We had another hard climb ahead of us and wanted to recover somewhat from the previous effort. I had a trail bar and some of my “go juice”. I made this by adding a Propel mix packet and a Great Value “energy” mix packet to my water. The Propel added electrolytes and the Great Value added a few “B” vitamins and 60 mg of caffeine. Mark also was trying this concoction.
After we finished lunch and rested a little, we started the climb up Tray Mountain. The trail had fewer switch backs which seemed to be more tiring. I am sure one factor may have been residual fatigue from the previous climb.
We passed a few dayhikers and what appeared to be overnighters based on their pack sizes coming down the trail. Apparently, this trail was somewhat popular with local hikers.
We were nearly to the top when it began a light rain with a brisk wind. Most of it didn’t reach us due to a thick canopy of mountain laurel. As we got closer to the top, the protective canopy thinned as the rain and wind picked up. We to stop and put on our pack covers and rain gear before continuing on.
We finally reached the shelter and managed to get out of the uncomfortable combination of blowing rain and cold cutting wind. There were several hikers present, including a couple that we consistently see on the trail, when we got there. However, we were able to use the “kitchen” to get out of the weather. Some shelters have “kitchens” which are basically a shelf fastened to an outside wall under the roof overhang. This shelter had one on each side and included a small bench that you could sit on.
The rain finally stopped and the wind, although still  cold, was not blowing as hard. It was around 4 o’clock, we started taking turns boiling water and eating. I ate my last freeze dried meal, chicken casserole. Mark ate chicken teriyaki. Even though he doesn’t like Asian food per se, he said it was good. 
I refilled my water bottles in preparation for the next day. The spring appeared to have been used for some other purpose than serving hikers. There was an old 10’ by 5’ concrete foundation close by and the spring was enclosed with a concrete box. Water flowed through a 2” pipe to empty into a small stream.
Mark decided to stay in the shelter. I spotted a small grassy area near a bluff with a great view on the way to the shelter. Personally, I prefer to tent than stay in the shelter. I like being able to get up when I please without disturbing anyone. Besides, I believe it is warmer because the shelter has wood slat floors that allow wind to blow through around you.After stashing my bear canister, I went to my tent to warm up and make a journal entry. Unfortunately, I only had one bar of service so I couldn’t make the entry but was able to have several text messages exchanges with Gale.Tomorrow, we plan to make it to Deep Gap Shelter and consider pushing on to Dick’s Creek Gap to resupply and wash our dirty and stanky clothes and bodies.","Blue Mountain Shelter

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607991,"I woke up slightly before daylight. The view was magnificent as I could see the lights from a small town in the distance. It was about 38 degrees according to the small thermometer that I have attached to my pack. I got out of my “sleep clothes” and packed up my gear. It had rained again during the night so I shook my rain fly off as best as I could and packed it up some what wet.
I picked up my stuff and walked back to the shelter to get my bear canister and eat. Mark was already up and fixing to eat. He had already gotten my bear canister for me so all I had to do is open it and eat. We had bought some instant coffee in our last supply run. Mark and I both rate it a double triple big thumb’s down. It will probably be donated to the “hikers box” at one of the hostels.
We finished breakfast, packed up and made one last visit to the privy before leaving. 
The walk down the mountain was similar to the going up. There was the usual roots and rocks and more mud due to the late afternoon and late night rain showers. As I mentioned before, walking down seems to work on the knees more than walking up.
The path wound through several ups and downs until it reached Kelly Knob which was a tough looooong climb up and around the mountain top. The trail then trended down towards Deep Gap. 
The shelter was actually down a “blue blazed” trail that went down a hollow for  about 3/10 mile. We decided that we were going to push on to Dick’s Creek Gap so we walked down the trail only far enough to get water and eat a light lunch.  We then started off towards Dick’s Creek. 
We had a couple of ups and downs but none as severe as those earlier in the day. We met two Ambassadors from the Appalachian Trail Conservancy as we headed down to the next rise. We stopped and talked about the trail conditions ahead and discussed gear and so forth. They said that they were out on “patrol” for a week to help hikers in distress, answer questions, assess trail conditions and promote “leave no trace” practices.
We told them that we appreciated what they do for the trail and moved on. According to the ATC guy, the trail would be much easier going after Mt. Powell which was our last climb for the day. He recommended that if we were going off trail to resupply and or zero that we call from Mt. Powell as there was no cell coverage at Dick’s Gap. He said that we would see a sign marked “vista” at a blue  blazed trail that we can go up and call. 
Mt. Powell was one of the easier climbs. We reached the sign and had a relatively easy walk up the trail to the top. We called the Top of Georgia Hiking Center first and all they had were bunks. All their cabins were booked so all they had left were bunks. Neither of us wanted that so we called the Budget Inn in Hiawassee which catered to hikers and offered  a free shuttle. Plus there were restaurants and grocery stores nearby. 
The manager said that all he had left were smoking room for the hiker rate of 50 bucks and a room with two king beds and a kitchenette for 65 dollars. We took the 65 dollar room. He asked what time would we be at Dick’s Gap. It was about 3:00 so we figured 4:30, maybe 5 based on the distance we had left.
The arrival estimation was good as we walked out of the woods around 4:30. We were the last group for the day. There were seven of us hikers with gear packed into that old van. It got us to the Budget Inn in one piece despite my reservations on its mechanical soundness.
We met two hikers from New York City. They recently retired from the NY Fire Department after 20 years. After finishing they were planning to get a job with the US Mail service. One hiker in the van was being taken to the emergency room which was across the street from the Budget Inn. She injured her ankle in a fall. She ended up getting a room next door to us. We found out later that she would have to be off trail for five days. The last passengers beside us was a married couple from Chicago that we originally met at Blue Mountain Shelter.
After arrival, Mark checked us in. We got a discount paying cash which saved us Ga taxes. The motel was nice back in 1960 and hasn’t been updated since. We didn’t use the kitchenette of questionable serviceability or the 20” tube TV that had been there since the 1970’s. However, it serves the purpose of providing a clean bed, a hot shower and a place to wash our clothes. I imagine that thru hiker traffic is what keeps it open.
Mark washed our clothes again since all I had to wear was a pair of shorts. He also walked to a nearby Taco Bell to get us some dinner. I bought since he was doing all the work. I made an entry to the trail journal and talked with Gale on the phone before cashing in for the night.","Tray Mountain Shelter

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608011,"We got up the next morning and walked to a Huddle House less than a mile away. This gave us a chance to loosen up our stiff legs and get a fresh cooked breakfast along with some decent coffee.
The part of town that we were in was nice with some relatively new looking side walks available that kept us off the busy Main Street. We took our time scoping out what businesses were available and what time they would open.
The breakfast was good. We both got the MVP platter with two eggs, hash browns, two biscuits with gravy and two waffles. The waitress also kept our coffee cups and water glasses full and certainly deserved the 20 percent tip.
As we walked back, we visited a couple of local outfitters, a Fred’s, a Dollar General and a local hardware store. I was needing a new rain suit and a new coffee filter to replace the one I left back at Gooch Gap Shelter. One of the outfitter’s had a rain suit but nobody had a coffee filter. 
We got back to the room and took inventory of our food and so forth. We try to maintain at least five days of food plus a little extra to get us by if we don’t get to another resupply point.  More than that is extra weight to care. Less means a bout of being “hangry”.
We originally planned to get a taxi to take us to Walmart; but decided that we could get just about everything we needed close by. On our initial walk to the Huddle House this morning, we saw an “Ingles” grocery store that appeared to be relatively be new.
At Ingles,  I bought some more Clif Bars, a couple of Uncle Ben’s rice sides, another pack of tortillas and a couple of more one liter bottles of smart water to replace the ones that I have been toting since Dahlonega. Mark bought similar items. We also split a box of coffee pods and a box of Fig Newtons. The coffee pods were basically coffee in a tea bag. We wanted to try these in an effort to have a decent tasting cup on the trail. We decided to give those crappy tasting instant coffee packets away or donate them to a hiker box.
On our way back to the room, we ran into Chappy and Dave, two hikers that we have been seeing on the trail since Stover Shelter. They didn’t make it to Dick’s Gap in time to catch the shuttle. They were headed to the all-you-can-eat steak restaurant that was down the road. They invited us to join them but neither of us was all that hungry.
We split up the coffee and fig newtons and restocked our canisters. We also started to put our packs back together in preparation for the trip back to the trail.Feeling hungry, we walked to “Barnies” a local bar & grill to eat lunch. We both ordered chili cheese burgers with fries and iced tea. Mark had sweet tea and I had my usual unsweetened. I also ordered a glass of locally made Hiawassee Ale to have with my meal.  Everything was good despite that it was a preformed patty.We plan to eat at a Zaxby’s close by tonite and get up early enough to go back to the Huddle House before the 9 o’clock shuttle leaves for Dick’s Gap.","Hiawassee, Ga

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608080,"We got up about 6 o’clock and started getting ready. I took one last shower and shave for the road. We walked across the road to a convenience store to get coffee grab something that we could eat for breakfast. We would of preferred walking back to Huddle House; however, we risked getting rained on or perhaps missing the first shuttle.
I spent 7 bucks for a cup of coffee, a blueberry muffin, a small pack of peanut m&m’s and a Kickstarter. Mark just had the cup of coffee and the muffin. I ended up sharing the m&m’s and Kickstarter with Mark after we got back to the room.
We loaded our gear into the van and climbed in. Six other hikers, two young women and four young men crawled in after us. We were packed in like a bunch of sardines.
The rain was light when the shuttle let us out. We thanked the driver for the ride and walked over to the trailhead. We put on our rainsuits as the weather forecast predicted thunderstorms starting in the afternoon.
 A volunteer trail maintainer arrived as we were putting on our gear. He was a friendly fellow and we talked for a short while. He said that he had not been out on the trail since winter and wanted to check things out. He carried a small rake and he had a set of loping shears in his daypack.
The trail started off with a short climb then started a long winding climb.  Some of the climbs were a little steep but for the most part were some of the more gradual climbs that we have seen.The path trended up in elevation. However, we couldn’t see a lot because we walked in fog or maybe a cloud all day. The climbing got us sweating so we unzipped our rain jackets. However, we zipped them back up when we stopped for a break because we would get cold. I don’t know if it was because we had fresh legs or the terrain; but, we seemed to make more progress than usual. We got to the GA/NC line around 3 o’clock and the Bly Gap campsite a short time later. We considered pressing on another couple of miles to Muskrat Shelter but decided to go ahead and camp since we didn’t know what time the storm would hit. We found a couple of spots down an unmarked trail that was out of the wind. It appeared that this area was an old road or fire break. We set up our tents with the door facing the bank to keep us from stumbling over the steep hollow that was beside us.The temperature was around 50 but seemed cold due to the wind and moisture. Our clothes under the rain suits were wet from sweat. We changed into our sleeping clothes and both got into our tents to keep warm.I ate a summer sausage, a couple of tortillas and a Fig Newton. I am not sure what Mark ate as we both stayed in our tents. He did mention that the Fig Newton that he ate was good which caused me to get one too.I brushed my teeth and went and stashed my canister in between the roots of a tree near the location where Mark had put his. We didn’t discuss tomorrow’s objective. I suppose we will talk about it during breakfast.","Hiawassee, Ga

In fact, I make it a point to stay in my wife’s good side so that she will wake me up when we have a tornado warning for our area. Last night’s storms actual woke me up twice. I suppose that  lightning hit somewhere close by. I woke up to thunderclaps and howling wind both times and only went back to sleep after the storms passed by,
We awoke to a steady downpour and seemingly ever present wind. I had my pack and other gear either inside the tent or under the vestibule so they remained dry. I was able to change into my hiking clothes including my rain gear inside the tent. I was also able pack my sleeping gear and other must dry items in the compactor bag lined pack inside the tent.  However, it is no fun breaking down a packing a tent in the pouring rain. We waited for it to let up as long as we could; but, the day started getting away from us.
To add to our winning ways, the trail started off as an immediate steep climb up Couthouse Bald in the rain. It got to a point that we wished that we had a rope and a grappling hook to pull us up. We finally made it to the top and was rewarded with a nice view of fog. The path then started winding down through a muddy, rocky and root infested trail. Several areas of the trail were underwater from the rain runoff.Around noon, we stopped for lunch at Muskrat Creek Shelter. We met a hiker “El Presidente” who retired from the Marines. He served as an honor guard for Presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan and Bush Sr. We also discussed hiking the John Muir trail in California.The rain finally stopped but we still had the wind and noticed that the temperature had dropped some. I checked the weather app which said that the highs were going to be around 50 and the lows were going to be in the upper 20’s.After we said goodby to El Presidente, he was taking a zero day there, we sat out on our way. The trail was still muddy and flooded in several areas as we pressed on. We had few slips but nothing that hurt us. Mark did predict that he would take an Advil before turning in as he thought that he would be sore from the mud, rocks and roots.We made a pretty good climb in elevation to Standing Indian Shelter. There were a few hikers already there. We got out our wet tents and hung them up to dry. The sun was out somewhat but the brisk wind that was with us all day enabled them to dry.

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608277,"What a difference a day makes. Yesterday, we had a tough climb, rain, wind then cold. Today we had cold which caused us to be slow getting started but no big gusty wind like the prior day. The trail conditions were a lot better. The mud and water were frozen when we started off which made walking less sloppy. In addition, the trail followed an old logging road up the mountain for the most part which had a gentler grade and a better walking surface.
As we neared the summit, we noticed evidence of a large fire that appeared to happen about a year or so. The mountain laurel and the Rhododendrons which generally form a green tunnel over the trail were devoid of leaves and dead. There were some new growth near the root of the plants but there were only a foot high.
After we got to the top the few views we had available were obscured by a haze. The path down the mountain was very good with only a few troublesome muddy areas. The fire also killed the foliage in this area. The canopy of dead rhododendrons reminded me of the haunted forest in the Wizard of Oz.The trail trended down for a while until we reached Betty Creek Gap campsites. We set up in a Rhododendron grove. Tomorrow we have to climb Albert Mountain which is another 1000 foot climb. Hopefully, the trail will be as kind to us as it was today.","Bly Gap

We both ate frozen trail bars which we had to melt in our mouths to enable us to chew them. We packed up and started out on the path to Albert Mountain. The path started out as a gradual ascent. Soon it turned into switch backs which made the elevation rise more tolerable. The path wound around the mountain on a two foot wide ledge held up mostly by rhododendron and some tree roots. The rhododendrons almost functioned as siderails to keep you from falling off the cliff which would be a widow maker. 
We got to the final approach to the summit. There was a gravel forest service road to the top that was marked as a blue blaze path. We followed the white blaze trail until the path turned into a significant rock climb.  It was the reverse of our descent at Blood Mountain. I had to crawl up using hand holds at several points. 
We made it to the top without falling to our deaths. The trail continued past a fire tower. We stopped a took a break. There several hikers here; six had camped there and two of those camped up in the tower.
The view from this point was outstanding. The sun was out and the sky was clear so you could see for miles. The tower was open, so we went up to take a look. The view from there was even better. We lingered a while and then we decided to get moving.
The trail down was a lot better than going up. It was a long gradual descent that was similar to the one coming down from Standing Indian Mountain. 
We had planned to reach Rock Gap Shelter to take a late lunch and determine if we could make it to Winding Stair Gap in time for the shuttle to Franklin.
We got to the shelter around 2:30 -3:00. While I was at the privy, Mark met a guy, “puddle jumper”,  at the shelter whose group was having trail magic at Rock Gap trail head, about 1/10 mile from the shelter. He said that it was a group that completed the through hike in 2017 and that they met each year since then to “pay-it-forward” for the trail magic that they received during their hike. 
We explained that we needed to get to winding stair to catch a shuttle to Franklin to resupply and zero for a day. He was kind enough to offer to take us in if we could hang around until they were through. We took him up on his offer and walked down to the trail head.
I shamelessly ate four hamburgers and two hotdogs. I honestly didn’t know that I was that hungry.  I washed that down with a PBR and a Gatorade. Mark ate two hamburgers and about a half a bag of Golden Flake sweet heat bbq potato chips. We also had a small cupcake a piece. Fortunately, none of the hikers present suggested “food hog” as a trail name for me.
After they closed up shop, they had been there all day serving food to hikers, we thanked the 2017 thru hikers for their generosity. We offered a donation for their efforts but they asked us to pay it forward when we finish the trail. 
Puddle Jumper squeezed our gear and us in his car.  On the way, we discussed his through hikes, he completed two, and exchanged other info about each other.
As promised, he delivered us to the Budget Inn. We had made a reservation while we were waiting for the trail magic to end. Again we asked if we could make a donation for all the food and ride to town. He reiterated that he would like us to pay it forward in the future.
It has been amazing to meet people such as these that go out of their way to helper fellow through hikers. It seems to be like a fraternity, except there are a lot of women that have completed the AT and also participate in the trail magic events. 
This Budget Inn was a step up from the one in Dahlonega. The owner put some effort in upgrading the facility.  He seems interested in attracting customers other than through hikers. We got the thru hikers and cash discounts so our tab for a pretty decent room was $60 bucks per night.","Betty Creek Cap Campsite

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608372,"As usual, we woke up hungry. Looking at the trail guide, it showed a McDonald’s, a Hardee’s and a Huddle House as breakfast options. Conceivably, we could have walked to the hamburger joints to eat their mostly pre-made microwaved food; however, the prior good experience at the Dahlonega location sold us.
The guide also suggested renting a car from Enterprise as an option to local or private shuttles. The advantage is that we would not shackled by the schedule or stop locations of the local shuttle and the private shuttle was not exactly cheap. Plus, Enterprise would pick us up and drop us back off at the motel after turning in the car.
Mark rented the car and drove us to Huddle House where we gorged ourselves on coffee and the MVP Platter.  He was wanting another pair of boots since his were not water proof as he thought. 
We went to Three Rivers Outfitters where he found a pair of Merrill’s that he liked. Lastly, we went to the local Walmart where we bought our food. Mark didn’t need much so he only bought a few things. I was down to about one day’s food so I bought four more days.
We went back to the room and repacked our gear for the next day. After that, we turned the car back in and were dropped off back at the room. Mark wanted try out his new boots so we walked around the town for the rest of the afternoon.
We stopped at another outfitter, Outside 76. We looked around and talked to some of the folks about hiking and the trails. I signed their 2019 AT thru hikers banner after they asked. They asked what our trail names were and we didn’t really have one; but, some of the other hikers were calling us the “NO BROS” which is a play off of “NOBO” or “North Bound”. It was given to us by a guy going by “Pony Keg” who was from Georgia but talked like “Crusher” from the “Nemo” cartoon.We walked down to the local Dominoes and picked up a pizza before heading back to the room for the night.","Franklin, NC

Macon County Transit operates a 3 dollar per person shuttle to Winding Stair Gap and Rock Gap, our getting off point. The shuttle route visits many of the hiker friendly hotels and hostels that don’t have their own shuttles. In that regard, he picked up four more hikers, including Alice and Mike, a couple that we have been seeing on the trail since Tray Mountain.
A total of six of us got off at Rock Gap. It was 23 degrees when we left the motel so it was about 18 or so at the trail head due to elevation. It was a clear sky so we anticipated that it would warm up quickly although the projected high was around 50.
The trail started off in a rolling fashion which helped us loosen up. We then had a climb which caused us to take off our coats and gloves. It turned out to be not a long climb as we got to the top and started trending down to Winding Stair Gap. 
We got to the Gap and met “Lone Chair”, a 1997 Thru Hiker that was doing trail magic. We were the 32nd and 33rd hikers that he met today. He offered us some outstanding homemade chocolate chip and walnut cookies, bananas and small snickers bars.
Lone Chair said that he can’t carry a pack anymore but does do trail magic on some of the days that he does trail maintenance work. We thanked for the food and offered a donation which he refused. He pointed us to the trail head across the road and wished us safe travels. He again displays the spirit that these former hikers of the AT have for the ones coming after them.
Our original goal was to get to Siler Bald Shelter since we got a late start hiking. However, we made a surprising good time so we decided to push on to Wine Creek Spring Camp. A motivating factor was that Siler Bald Shelter was a half mile off the trail and we didn’t want to add an extra mile there and back.
We got to the top and discovered that there was a large grass area on top that appeared to have been recently cut.
The trail crossed the field and started winding down to Wayah Gap which turned out to be a pretty busy road. We crossed the road and started out on what turned to be a long climb to the campsite.

I also had a couple of turkey sausages and a handful of trail mix.We packed up our gear and got on the trail. The hike was relatively smooth for a mile and trended down towards Tellico Gap. There, we met a US Army soldier that just let off a squad for a hike. He refilled our water bottles for us and offered us some food that they had left over from that morning. We were full so we didn’t want any food but we thanked him for the water and his service and headed on our way.We started an immediate climb up Wesser Bald. The path was fairly smooth but steadily increased in elevation winding up the mountain. We finally reached the top after a long climb. After taking off our packs and drinking some water, we checked out an observation tower that was an old decommissioned fire tower. The view, as with most that we have seen were spectacular.The trail down was opposite of the one coming up the mountain. One, we walked through another burned forest. Two, the trail followed ridge tops down which gave magnificent views of the surrounding mountains and valleys; but, was only about ten feet wide had had deep sheer cliffs on each side. Three, at the end of the ridges, we had to literally climb down about 20 -25 feet down a rock face to a switchback which put us on another narrow ridge. If you wanted to take a look at something off the trail, you have to stop it risk tumbling to a painful death. I found out later that the AT Guide calls this area the “Jump Off” which, in my opinion, does not accurately describe this dangerous area.We managed to get down to safer ground and started a long trend down to the Nantahala Outdoor Center. We planned to stop there for a night before making a long climb up Cheoah Bald. Unfortunately, they were booked up due to high school students taking up all the rooms. We caught a shuttle to Bryson City, NC to a Relax Inn. Nice place for 77 bucks.","Big Branch Campsite
",Nantahala Outdoor Center,"Mar 21, Thu",9.80
Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608622,"The shuttle picked us up at 8 o’clock as promised. The driver, Patrice, was a long time resident of the area. She also retired from the Nantahala Outdoor Center or “NOC” as it was commonly referred to, and was very knowledgeable about the local trails. She said that her knees would not let her tote a pack but she stays active as a “paddler”. 
She dropped us off near the bridge across the Nantahala river by the the local outfitter. We didn’t need any supplies so we got our gear together. 
The NOC is mostly known as a white water school but offers zip lining, raft rides, and hiking. The AT goes right through the complex. 
We walked across the bridge and admired the rapids, They had a kayaking course  built starting at the bridge and continuing down the river a ways. We didn’t see anyone kayaking but it was understandable since the weather had been cold.
We picked up the trail across the tracks for the Great Smoky Mountain Rail Road which runs right beside the complex. The path began an immediate upward track as we had about a 4000 foot climb out of the river valley up Sassafras Mountain. 
The trail passed by some large boulders which were fractured and would eventually fall sometime in the future. One several ton slab stuck out over the trail like a diving board. We did not linger in this area especially when Mark made the comment that “it wouldn’t take much for that to fall”. I agreed completely with his assessment.
The trail continued to wind up the mountain. The were several switchbacks to make the climb easier. We passed a memorial to a Forestry Service employee who died several years ago fighting a forest fire. There were several coins on the plaque along with a few small stones that hikers placed there as an acknowledgement of his sacrifice. Mark had a couple coins handy and left them on the plaque.
As we got closer to the top, we noticed a sprinkling of snow on the ground in the shade. The nearer we got to the top the more snow was present. Finally, when we got to the top the snow was about 1/2” deep in places that were shady. 
We stopped and took a lunch break on a bluff on the sunny side of the mountain that overlooked the river. We could make out the river and the NOC from that vantage point. While we were there we met a hiker from Michigan going by the name “Denali”. He said that he took that trail name after climbing Mt. Denali last year to raise money for cancer research. He is hiking the AT to raise money for the same  cause. 
We continued along a ridge to a gap that led us starting a 900 ft  climb to Cheoah Bald. The snow was more prevalent and thicker here. Our trekking poles came in handy to help us get through some areas.  Wind gusts were also becoming a factor in maintaining our balance.
Most of the snow and wind was on the shady side of the mountain. We finally got the the grass Bald and took a break. The temperature and wind speed here were completely different from the shaded mountain flank.We sat down and admired the view of the surrounding mountains and valleys. We talked with a couple of section hikers that were there also enjoying the weather and view from the Bald. We discussed hiking and pack weights and so forth. Knowing we still had about four miles to go before we camped, we put on our packs and moved on.The path followed a ridge for some time before starting down some switchbacks where the trail improved the lower down the flank it got. There were few more trees that fell across the path that we had to go over. One of these was held in place by a few roots. I had a vision of Slim Pickens riding down that bomb in the Dr. Strangelove movie as I straddled the two foot thick trunk to climb over. The flank of the mountain was very steep at that point.We wound down the mountain until we reached Locust Cove Gap where we planned to camp. The wind is gusty here and it is going to be cold tonight.Tomorrow, we are to meet Mark’s wife Bett so she can take us to Gatlinburg where Gale rented a cabin for us.","Nantahala Outdoor Center

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609052,"Gale dropped us off back at Stecoah Gap after four days with the family at a cabin in Sevierville. I had been missing my wife so it was a timely break from the trail. I had a great time but spent too much time making a pig of myself at the buffets.
The trail head was across the road from the parking lot where Gale dropped us off. The path started winding up the mountain in a reasonable gradual manner. It steepened as it got closer to the top of the mountain.
We finally got to the top after a long climb from the Gap. As with most mountain tops, the views were very good. 
The trail then switch backed down although the path near the top was rocky and rooty.  Fortunately, the trail smoothed out somewhat as we got lower down the mountain.
We reached the shelter around 3 o’clock that afternoon. The shelter was one if the older and smaller ones that we stayed in. We found that someone left a “puffy” jacket that contained a billfold. We planned to take it with us to the Fontana Visitor Center tomorrow. Later that afternoon, our friend Chappy showed up looking for his jacket.  He was very happy we had it. 
Tomorrow, we plan to hike to the Fontana “Hilton”.","Stecoah Gap

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609055,"There was another mountain to climb between us and Fontana Shelter.  It trail started going up immediately from the shelter. The path was relatively smooth until we started getting close to the top. We started encountering a few boulder fields that always seem to grab our poles, turn our ankles or trip us up. 
The  trip down the mountain was much longer than going up since we were walking down to a TVA lake. The shelter was by far the best that we have seen.  There is a bathhouse close by equipped with a shower and there is a spigot with city water available along with a solar charging station. We decided to stay there since the campsites between Fontana and the next shelter 13 miles away are closed due to bear activity.We caught a shuttle, $3  per person,  to the Fontana Lodge and had a very good hamburger that came with fries or onion rings for 10 bucks.Tomorrow we start climbing the Great Smokey Mountains.","Cable Gap Shelter

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609983,"We left the Fontana “Hilton” with its showers, city water, heated bathroom and charging station for a one mile walk down to and across the dam to the entrance of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. We were in for a long long hike up to Mollies Gap Shelter. It was a beautiful day with mild temperatures. 
We had to buy an online permit for $20 each to through hike the park. It allowed us eight days to get through the park and was good for 30 days. The trailhead had a box where we had to place a portion of the permit in the box with our starting date of entering the park.
For most of the time, we were walking with Chappy and/or our new friend John Metheny or “moonwalker”.  We met moonwalker at Cable Gap Shelter. Chappy gave him his trail name after it appeared that John was moon walking while sliding down a slick spot on the trail.
We got near the top of Shuckstack Mountain and took a blue blaze trail to an old fire tower. John said that he was not much for heights and would watch our packs.  Chappy decided to wait until we came down before he would go up. 
It was the smallest floor size and least maintained of those that we have seen so far. The steps up were solid but the tower floor did not inspire confidence. Mark and I made sure that we were next to the wall so we would have a chance to grab hold if the floor collapsed under us. Mark called Bett since he was able to get service. 
As with the other towers that we climbed, the views were spectacular. The wind picked up so we made our way down. We warned Chappy about the poor condition of the floor and the wind. He climbed up the steps part of the way said that he had seen enough.
We resumed our hike to Mollies Gap Shelter. The path wound down the flank of the mountain then across a ridge to a Gap then up a steep higher climb. This pattern was repeated until we reached the shelter.
The shelter had been constructed from native stone and had an actual working fireplace. We were the first ones there so we each grabbed a spot. According to the trail guide it would hold fourteen.
It soon filled up and several more were tenting. It was a long day so we turned in early.","Fontana Shelter
",Mollies Gap Shelter,"Mar 29, Fri",12
Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609989,"We were still feeling the effects of the long climb from the Fontana Hilton so we were slow getting in the trail. John took off about an hour sooner to get a head start on us.
The trail started off with a gradual incline for a couple of miles which softened the climb some. We walked up on a doe browsing on the trail. She didn’t seem afraid of us but kept her eye on us and her distance as we walked along the path. It was the first large mammal that we have seen. 
There was another shelter only about 3 miles away from Derrick’s Knob where Chappy was to meet someone in performance of his duty as Trail Chaplain. We didn’t know if we would cross paths again so we wished each other well.
A couple of miles or so later I learned on of the lessons that the trail can teach you. I had let myself become dehydrated to the point that I lost my equilibrium after a small stumble on a root. 
It was a scary moment as I had to grab a small tree to keep myself from falling off the trail down a deep ravine. Mark thought that he was about to lose another brother since it came on so sudden.  I tried to stand but was unable to keep erect without holding on to something. I sat down on the high side of the trail and asked Mark to hand me my water. Another hiker happened by and said he had some aspirin which Mark got a couple and wanted me to take just in case. I did but I told him that I felt fine except that I was dizzy. After a few minutes, I was able to regain some sense of balance. Since I was still wobbly legged, I set the pace as Mark followed behind. We were a couple of miles from the next shelter where we would eat lunch and let me fully rehydrate.
Fortunately, after drinking a full liter of water with electrolytes and eating something, I began to feel like myself again. I also took out my contacts which I felt contributed to my inability to regain my sense of balance. I was frustrated that I know better than not keep myself properly hydrated.
We had to climb Rocky Mountain which was a long steep climb for us. We stopped at the top and enjoyed the view along with several day hikers and a few thru hikers. One of the day hikers, most likely a Tennessee fan, said that was the mountain mentioned in the song. Another guy that was apparently hiking with him basically threw a BS Flag saying “that is what you expect a Tennessee fan to say”.
The next mountain, Thunderhead, was not as difficult because we did not lose much elevation from Rocky Top. We met another day hiker who pointed out the valley where Cades Cove lies. I took a picture as it was pretty from that vantage point.
We were not through climbing mountains as we had two more where the trail passed over the top. These were difficult because they had deep gaps between them. One was rooty and rocky all the way up and down.
We got to the shelter around 5 o’clock. John had made it there and wondered what happened to us. Our friend Dave or “double check” as he was now called was also there. Mark got the last space which was alright with me as I prefer tenting. Several more hikers were tenting close by me. 
The wind had picked up since we climbed Rocky Top which meant that we were going get some rain. I put some rocks on my tent stakes in case the wind picked up more.I drank a lot more water and ate a heavy meal consisting of a freeze dried spaghetti meal and a summer sausage. My water and electrolytes should be back in sync tomorrow.","Mollies Gap Shelter
",Derrick’s Knob Shelter,"Mar 30, Sat",12.10
Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609997,"The gusty wind that followed us from Rocky Top and Thunderhead foreshadowed rain as it started around 10 o’clock and woke me up briefly. My tent seemed to be fairly secure, although flapping somewhat so I fell back asleep. Sometime later it turned from blowing rain to blowing snow because it was cold and there was about an inch of it on the ground. It is funny how quickly the weather changes from mild shirt sleeve to cold snowy in twenty four hours.
I left my tent and retrieved Mark’s and my bear canisters from where we put them behind a log. I took them to the crowded shelter so we could eat and decide how far to go that day.
After eating a freez dried breakfast, I crawled back into my tent and started packing up my sleep gear. I got everything except my tent in the pack and took it to the shelter to get out of the blowing snow. I went back to breakdown my tent without it blowing away. Mark came and help me corral everything and shake off as much snow and ice as we could before rolling everything up.
We waited around to see if the snow or wind or both would let up. Neither did so we took off on the trail. By this time another inch of snow had accumulated. John decided to come with us at least until Silers Bald Shelter which was about five miles away. 
We trudged on until we reached the shelter and took a break for lunch. We decided to finish climbing Silers Bald and reach Double Spring Gap Shelter which was two miles away.
The snow finally stopped as we got over Silers Bald. We reached Double Spring Gap around 4 o’clock and decided to spend the night since the temperature was supposed to drop into the teen’s.  I took a spot in the shelter as I didn’t want to have de-ice my tent again.
The shelter filled up quickly with other hikers. This shelter also had a fireplace so Mark and another guy built a fire.
Tomorrow we head towards Newfound Gap and take a re-supply/ zero day in Gatlinburg.","Derrick’s Knob Shelter

We were slow getting up and packing our gear because of the cold temperature and maneuvering around people in the crowded shelter. We finally got started hiking around 9 o’clock.
We were only three miles from Clingman’s Dome but had to finish climbing Mt. Buckley at 6600 feet first. Fortunately, the shelter was already at 5500 feet so the climb should not be as long or tough unless we had to scale a rock face. But we still faced snow, mud and ice along with the, seemingly ever present roots and rocks.
The path wound up the mountain with not long steep areas. The sun warming things up, along with our climbing, caused us to shed our coats not long into the hike. We got to the top and had some nice views of the countryside. The trail then followed a ridge across a high gap to Clingman’s Dome.
Our climb up Clingman’s Dome went relatively well as the sun continued to warm things up and dry off the trail. We went up to the observation tower and spent a little time taking pictures while enjoying the views of the surrounding countryside. On the way down, I slipped on a patch of ice and fell down. Luckily, the only thing hurt was my pride. The trail down from Clingman’s Dome was treacherous. The path was a sheet of ice for large stretches. I slipped and fell twice. I was not hurt as my pack cushioned the fall somewhat. John fell hard once and bruised his arm along with his pride. Mark managed to make it down without hitting the ground although he had some close calls. The trail remained icy all the way to Indian Grave Gap. There was a marker there that identified it as the site of an old road that was once used as the main passage through the area. From there, we had to climb another mountain. We passed through a fenced area that served, according to the sign, to protect a beech tree forest from wild hogs.Finally, the trail reached Newfound Gap. We walked over to the parking area a sat down to call for a shuttle. As I was calling a potential shuttle for us, a man and a woman approached Mark and John and offered us a ride to Gatlinburg. He was a member of the Smoky Mountain Trail Club and did Trail maintenance. After talking with them a bit, we accepted their offer. They drive us to a Motel 6 that was listed in the guidebook. We thanked them and offered to pay for the ride but they refused. They asked us to pay it forward.","Double Spring Gap Shelter

We passed three day hikers heading back to Newfound Gap. One of them had his arm in a sling. He slipped on the ice and injured his shoulder.By 12 o’clock, we only managed to go four miles. We stopped at Charlie’s Bunion, a large rock outcropping that is a popular destination with day hikers. We ate lunch and took a few pictures. Mark and I climbed in and took a look at the nice views. John decided that he wanted to be the survivor that told what happened if we got blown off or fell.We continued to encounter ice and snow in the shady areas but fortunately did not have any steep climbs or descents.

Rogers, before we could get to Thomas Knob Shelter where we planned to spend the night. Fortunately, the gap from Lost Mountain to White Top did not cost us a bunch of elevation. But, the path up was still a long steady climb. After some initial switchbacks, the trail wound its way up the mountain flank. We reached a point where the clouds were low so we walked in a damp fog the rest of the way up. There was a grassy bald on top which lately means that we wouldn’t have any views.","Lost Mountain Shelter

The ice and snow on the trail was regulated to the shady areas of the higher elevations. Even then, it only extended 10 to 20 feet in stretches.We had a few more ups and downs until we reached Mt. Crosby. The climb was steady but rooty and rocky. We skirted the top and started down more rooty and rocky sections that worked on our ankles and feet.We reached the shelter and found several section hikers there with several more coming.

I wrapped my pack with the pack cover the night before and put it in the tents vestibule so it wouldn’t get wet. After putting on my rain suit and boots, I managed to pack up my sleep gear and reload it into my pack inside the tent. One of the reasons that I picked this tent is that it was a dome type which allowed me to sit up and have some working room.
I took my pack to the shelter and ate breakfast which consisted of a couple of protein bars. Mark made us some coffee.
The rain had stopped shortly after we finished eating. We went back and broke down our tents. We shook as much water off as we could but still had to pack them up wet.
We set out on the trail with John in tow. We had one more mountain to climb before Davenport Gap. It was a long climb so it didn’t take us too long to shed our rain jackets. We got to the top and there was a “blue blazed” or side trail to a observation tower. We passed it up because it was still cloudy and sprinkling.
The trail down seemed longer than going up. It was also muddy with the ever present roots and rocks which worked on our feet and ankles.
We got to Davenport Gap and  stopped to eat lunch. After discussing it, we decided to stay the night at the Standing Bear Farm Hostel which was about 3 miles away. This would be my first experience with staying at a hostel. 
We had a steep but short climb out of the gap which soon leveled off and then switch backed down before crossing two creeks. We passed a large cascade before coming out at a road near I 40. There a 2018 AT hiker, “Ghost”, and his wife was doing trail magic.  I had a piece of pizza, a banana and a bottle of chocolate milk. We thanked them for their kindness.
We passed under I 40 and climbed an old stone stair case which set us off on another climb. The trail leveled off after a while and we reached the road to the hostel. We made a short walk and was able to secure three spots in the overflow bunkhouse. The interesting thing about the place is that it is on the honor system for the little store and “cook house”.  The guy running the place, “Boston Jack” gave a slip of paper to keep up with our purchases.","Cosby Knob Shelter

Our bill was basically a scrap of paper that Boston Jack wrote our names on. We were to keep up with stuff that we got from the kitchen or store room. They seemed to be trusting folks and their prices were reasonable. We paid in cash and headed down the road.
We had a long climb up Snowbird Mountain. One of our hiker friends, Dave or “double check” got a video of a mama bear and her cub up in tree.  Dave asked us if we seen them. We said no but we thought that we heard the bear calling her cub. Dave said that they had waited until the bears left before moving on. 
We they went down into a gap to Ground Hog Shelter and stopped to eat lunch and refill our water bottles. 
We then started on a long climb to Max Patch, a grassy bald that is popular with hikers as a campsite. As luck will have it, a group of former AT hikers were doing trail magic one mile from the summit. They had lots of food and there were a number of other hikers eating when we got there. I ate some wings and chips with salsa along with a PBR. I also took an apple and an orange to eat later on the road. We refilled our water bottles with filtered water that they brought and sincerely thanked them for their kindness. I can’t say enough how awesome these former AT hikers are.
The views from Max Patch were fantastic.  The sky was clear and you could see for miles in all directions. It had a very large grassy area that was popular with locals and through hikers. There were over a hundred tents in view and we saw one couple getting married and several others  having pictures made. Several folks had chairs set up to watch the sunset.

I had packed up my gear inside the tent as it was raining, I had to use my bear canister to weigh my tent down to keep it  from blowing off the mountain while I was dismantling it.
The trail down had a lot more switchbacks and a easier grade than the long climb up. We ended up climbing a couple of smaller mountains before we reached Mt. Bluff where we had another long ascent. 
At some of the higher elevations, including on the way to Max Patch, we saw large areas of the forest floor covered with tiny white flowers. I took a picture to try and identify them later.

We finally got to Hot Springs after a bunch of switchbacks. Mark checked for vacancies at the Laughing Heart Hostel that was right at trailhead.

I had the big plate consisting of three eggs, country ham, hash browns, and biscuits and gravy. I wanted to follow my daddy’s advice and “eat so that I don’t get hungry”. I didn’t want to get hungry during the first part of the hike.
We finished our breakfast and went back to our room to brush our teeth and pick up our packs. There was no onsite manager so we put the key back in the lockbox that was on the outside wall next to the door.
We had to walk about a half mile or so to cross the bridge over the French Broad River and leave the town.  We then followed the trail parallel to the river until it started switchbacks up the side of a mountain. It took about an hour to get to the top with us stopping several times for water breaks.
The trail then followed a ridge for while before winding down to a gap. There the path followed a rolling terrain which allowed us to make pretty good time.  We took a short break at a pond formed by a dam on the creek. The dam was pretty old and was similar to the one on Turkey Creek in Morris.
The trail continued on to a US Forestry Service road that we followed for a half mile or so. The road bisected a large meadow or pasture that, according to the sign we found, was an old tobacco and cattle farm that the Forest Service purchased in 1970 and maintained it for wildlife like turkey, deer and grouse.The trail left the road and started a long climb up a mountain. It took a quite a while to get to the top. It then wound down to a shelter where we originally planned to stay but it was swarming with flies. John said according to the comments on the Guthook App that a homeless person lived there for over year with his dog. There was a tarp next to the shelter that covered a pack and other items. We didn’t fully investigate since we didn’t know if it belonged to the rumored homeless person or not.

It then assumed a steeper incline with no switchbacks. We managed to get on top of the ridge and followed it for a good bit.
The trail started up another ascent to a junction with a “bad weather” bypass. We elected to stay on the AT which took us on a narrow rocky and exposed ridge. Mark said it reminded him of the Quarry Trail at Ruffner Mountain. I said “yes but we were a lot higher up”. Mark responded: “that just gives you longer to scream”. 
We literally had to crawl up and down over large rocks.  The views were spectacular but we had to use care to keep from being blown off the ridge. Several times we had to wait for a lull in the wind gusts or had to crouch down to keep the wind from catching hold of us. John got blown against the rocks a time or two. Each time after a few expletives, he said that we were crazy for going this way. Crawling over this ridge took about an hour to complete. After we finally got out of the wind and started down the ridge, John observed: “Did y’all notice that nobody passed us on that trail? Nobody! They must have smart enough to take the bypass! John was alluding to the younger hikers passing us on a regular basis.Mark said “John when was the last time you had an adventure like that? We survived didn’t we? Besides, we only took that trail because we wanted to give you an opportunity to get some video for your blog”. John quickly threw a BS flag and said we were crazy. The trail resumed a rolling pattern and we made to the shelter around 4 o’clock. It was a nice stone shelter and we each took a spot in anticipation of stormy weather.","Deep Gap

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610512,"We left Jerry Cabin Shelter after the rain that was forecast showed up during the night as light rain. The wind picked up sometime in the night and was waiting for when we got up stirring around.  Today we had to go over Big Butt mountain before making a steady descent to Devil Fork Gap. Laurel Hostel was a short distance from there where we planned to pick up a day or two of food to get us to Erwin, TN where we would resupply. 
The trail went down to a gap where the were several tents set up.  It then followed a ridge for a mile or so which helped us warm up. The path started a brisk ascent with few switchbacks until we got up in elevation. We passed a memorial to a Howard Bassett whose ashes were interred there. According to the marker, he hiked the AT in 1968. Evidently, that was what he wanted done with his remains. We had passed an old logging road a short distance away which we guessed is where they brought the memorial stone up.  We were curious why that point on the trail was selected and what arrangements were made with the US Forestry Service to allow it to happen. Mark stated, that if he were to die on the trail for some reason, he would not want memorial. He also felt the same way about a memorial on the highway. I agreed and had the same feeling. John didn’t comment.
A short time later, we started the final climb to Big Butt Mountain. There we found a shorter version of the Firescald Ridge trail that we crawled across the day before. Fortunately, we were not exposed to the wind as the other trail but we did have to crawl up and down rocks in some areas. We managed to get through this area with out problems.
The trail then started down a few rocky switchbacks to a rolling section which took us to Flint Mountain Shelter where we ate lunch and refilled our water bottles. After we left the shelter we ran into “Yonder”, a 2007 AT thru hiker, doing trail magic. I had a donut and took an apple and a banana for later. He said that he lived only 17 miles away and liked paying it forward. He said his truck was parked on the side of the road and we were welcome to drop our trash off. We thanked him for his kindness. 
The trail descended at a steady clip and soon reached a road. The TN/NC line was about 50 feet from where the trail crossed the road. Yonder left some more snacks and soft drinks by a set of steps which would allow us to cross a barbed wire fence. There was a sign next to the steps that indicated that Laurel Hostel was located on the next road which was about a half mile away.
We crossed the fence and the trail continued across a pasture and re-entered the woods through a pedestrian gate through the fence. The path had a slight climb then went down to another road. We walked down the road a short distance to the hostel. 
It was a simple place with a six person bunkhouse with a shower connected to a covered pavilion. An outhouse was located close by. We took the three bunks that were available. The owner would do our laundry for 8 bucks a load. They didn’t have any resupply food but they would take us to the grocery store in Erwin for 10 bucks each. Three of us, I got Mark’s order, decided to take him up on it.
Tomorrow, we head for Bald Mountain Shelter which will be our longest mileage day so far.","Jerry Cabin Shelter

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610552,"We left Laurel Hostel around 7:30.  As expected, we had an immediate climb out of the gap. It had rained during the night which made the trail slick.  Fortunately, the path up had a number of switchbacks which helped us. Once we got up to a ridge, we followed it to the next climb. This repeated several times. It was also humid, so we had a lot of water breaks to cool off. It took us all day to get up to Big Bald. We climbed a couple of smaller mountains before getting there. The muddy pathway plagued us all day going up and down in elevation.  The trail up Big Bald was more of a constant incline which wore on us. A few more switchbacks would have been helpful. After we got to the top, we entered a very large grassy bald similar to Max Patch except there were only six people and a couple of dogs on top. The view was fantastic though in all directions. Apparently, this place was not as popular with the locals unless the reported bad weather that was on the way kept them away.The trail continued through the bald until it entered the woods on the far end. It then progressed down to a gap where the shelter was located. We each got a spot in the 12 person shelter for the night.","Laurel Hostel

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610553,"The decision to stay in the shelter was a good one. Thunderstorms rolled in during the night. We woke to sprinkling rain but still had the gusty winds. 
We put on our rainsuits and started down the trail. The pathway was muddy and slick which slowed us down somewhat. The rain and wind gusts also were not helpful. The trail trended down towards Spivey Gap. John slipped down and broke one of his trekking poles. He was not injured but was in a bad mood for most of the day. Mark found a dried stick for him to use until we run across something better. The path up from Spivey Gap followed a creek up the mountain for the most part. The wind seemed to become more gusty as the day wore on. It was whipping and twisting tree tops like the “whomping” tree in the Harry Potter movie. We heard one tree fall across the creek from us so we kept an eye out for dead trees and limbs that could break loose and kill us.  I had to stop a couple of times to make sure ones that were really being whipped by the wind wasn’t about to mash me like a grape. We came across several trees that appeared to have recently fallen on the trail. One of these blocked our way so  I helped Mark move it out of the way. The rain came back and soaked us before we got to the shelter. One of the hikers that were already there, “Root”, strung up a clothesline so we all could try to dry our clothes.Tomorrow, we wil hike the six or seven miles to Erwin to spend the night and resupply before heading out the following morning.","Bald Mountain Shelter

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610560,"The rain and wind continued on and off during the night. Sometime before we woke, the temperature dropped and the rain turned into snow.  It wasn’t sticking so we wouldn’t be looking at icy spots on the trail. Our clothes were still wet for the most part. I couldn’t wear my shirt but my pants were dry except at the pants leg cuffs. I had put on my under armor to sleep in and decided to keep it on since it was cold. I also put on my boggin and my rain jacket to keep the cold wind off of me. 
We got going around 8 o’clock which helped warm us up. The trail still followed a ridge around the mountain so we had ample time to warm up before we hit a climb. The trail started winding its way up a mountain before catching another ridge we followed for a while. Several trees were across the trail that we either removed, climbed over or in one case, had to belly crawl under after making sure it wouldn’t move at all.
We got past these obstacles and continued on the ridge before following a old logging road up to a bluff where we could see Erwin in the distance. There the path switchbacked all the way down to where it crossed the road near Uncle Johnny’s Hostel. We decided to check it out before staying there. It seemed to have everything that we needed, including free scheduled shuttles to town to eat and resupply. We each took a bunk. We got there in time to catch the shuttle for lunch at an all you can eat pizza buffet which was also next to a Dollar General. After pigging out, we to Dollar General and picked up a couple of things. We then got showers and washed our clothes which came with the stay, Later, we caught the dinner shuttle and ate at a Mexican restaurant which was also next to a Walmart where we finished our resupply. 
Tomorrow, we will bypass the first shelter since it is only four miles away and hike at until we get tired and then find a suitable campsite.","No Business Shelter

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610929,"The temperature outside caused me to put on my “puffy” or down jacket. We got everything packed and ready to go but waited on the onsite store to open at 8 o’clock to get a cup of coffee and I needed a tube of toothpaste.
We downed the coffee and headed across the bridge ove the Nolichucky River to where the trail entered the woods. The path meandered back and forth over a large stream. Thanks to the hardwork of the trail club that maintained this section, we had nice bridges to get us over the creek. We were joined by Bob, who we met back in the Smokies. He had got to feeling light headed and wanted to hike with us a while. 
The trail finally left the stream and switch backed up to a ridge where we walked a couple of miles. We reached Curley Maple Gap Shelter and ate lunch. A hiker that stayed at the hostel with us the night before was already there. He said that he started hiking the Pinholti Trail around Sylacauga up through Georgia then on the AT. He was planning to end his hike at Harpers Ferry. He had already done a section hike from Maine to there earlier. He was a young fellow so I asked him what he did for a living that would allow him to do his hiking for months at a time.  He said that he was a professional poker player out of Chicago.
We got back on the trail and it continued some long switchbacks which got us higher in elevation. The trail then followed a ridge for a while before climbing up to a higher point on the mountain. We reached a gravel road where a man, Brother Tom, was doing trail magic. He said that he had been doing it for six years as part of his ministry. We had pieces of homemade banana bread, brownies and cold sweet tea. We sat and talked with him a while and then thanked him for his kindness.
The trail continued to climb but with no switchbacks. We reached a large grassy bald called the Beauty Spot which like other balds offered outstanding  360 degree views of the surrounding countryside. We ran into Bob’ s hiking buddies taking a break  so we left him there with them. We needed water so we didn’t stay longer and continued on. 
We picked up some water at a spring in a gap before climbing Unaka Mountain to where we planned to camp.  The climb up was steep with large rocks that were laid out as steps. Fortunately, they included a few switchbacks that gave our quads a slight rest before the next set. We reached our tent site around 4:30 very tired from the climb. Our buddy John showed up about 30 minutes later. 
Nearby, one of the spruce trees was decorated like a Christmas tree with various ornaments. A sign that was on the tree said it was decorated in memory of Max Andrew Norrelk, 02/25/94 to 05/20/16.

The spruce forest provided a relatively soft walking surface and had a pleasant Christmas tree smell.  The trail wound its way through the forest for another two or three hundred yards on top of the mountain. Then the soft path of the spruce forest gave away to the familiar feet hurting rocks and roots as the trail headed down from the top. We reached a gap then had a few ups and downs but stayed above 3000 feet most of the way.We took a snack break at Cherry Gap Shelter where we also filled our water bottles.  The temperature warmed up to around 70 but we were drinking a lot of water while hiking.The trail continued on without any drastic elevation changes.  At least the climbs were not as taxing as others. We reached the shelter around 4 o’clock. We decided to take a space to same time setting up then taking down a tent in order to get an early start. Tomorrow will be a hard day as we need to go at least 14 miles to be on schedule to meet our wives Friday. We have to climb Little Knob, Big Knob and 6000 feet Roan Mountain during that stretch.","Tent site on Unaka Mountain 
",Clyde Smith Shelter,"Apr 17, Wed",12.40
Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610972,"We left Clyde Smith Shelter a little after 7’oclock.  The trail stayed rolling with a few ups and downs but gradually gaining elevation all along. We were spared for the most part rocky or roots trail conditions which allowed us to make good time until we reached Little Knob. There we had switchbacks to help with the elevation but the rocks and roots on the path surface still worked on our feet and ankles.
We finished climbing Little Knob then thankfully followed a ridge over to Big Knob which offered similar trail conditions until we got near the top near the top where we essentially had a rock stairs. These were rocks placed strategically by the trail  builders which worked our quads but spared our feet from uneven surfaces. The normal fantastic views were available from rock cliffs at the top.
The gap between Big Knob and Roan Mountain was not very deep and we only had about a 1000 foot climb to the top. We passed a monument commemorating the Hughes family which had owned the land we were walking on since 1878. I am amazed and grateful that landowners such as these were able to support the AT concept with land grants and easements so long ago.
The climb up Roan consisted of long switchbacks which got us up without one of us busting a lung. We reached the top and found a sign that commemorates he Cloudland Hotel that operated on top of the mountain at the turn of the century until 1914. According to the sign, the hotel actually straddled the TN/NC border and had the state line painted on the floor where patrons could walk across the room to the TN side and have an alcoholic drink. NC was dry at that time. Customers got there by  narrow gauge railroad then a 12 hour carriage ride up the mountain.
We stopped for lunch at the Roan Mountain shelter which was about a half mile from that point. It is the highest shelter, at a little over 6000 feet, on the AT. The shelter was more like a cabin as it had four walls, windows and an actual working front door. There was also a loft that would hold several people.
The trail followed an old road until turning off to a suprisingly well kept trail. The path surface was crushed stone and generous switchbacks. There also were several sturdy bridges constructed of wood with expanded metal walking surfaces to get us over several creek crossings. It was extremely obvious that the local trail club put a tremendous amount of work in trail maintenance.
We walked down to Carvers Gap and followed the trail to the first of two adjacent grassy balds. The crushed stone path took us to the top of Little Round Bald before converting to a rutty dirt trail. We enjoyed another 360 degree view of the countryside. As we approached the top a gusty crosswind started blowing. Several times were were blown sideways as we walked up to Jane Bald, which was a higher elevation. I started to assume a Quasimodo posture in an effort to keep the wind from catching hold of me. It seemed to be effective unless the gust blew when I had to raise my wind facing shoulder to move my trekking pole forward. I would be blown sideways for a couple of steps.The path finally turned out of the wind and entered the protective canopy of the woods. It then switch backed down to a ridge which led us to the gap the Stan Murray Shelter was located. The wind continued to blow and according to some hikers, a rain storm was on its way.Tomorrow, we have to go 11 miles to meet Bett and Gale for the weekend.","Clyde Smith Sheltery

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611029,"The tent foot prints that we hung on the front of the shelter was a wise precaution. The gusty wind continued through the night. Rain added it’s misery around 10 o’clock. The foot prints kept most of the rain off of Mark and myself. John didn’t have one so the rain was blown in on his feet.
We needed to hike 11 miles in stormy weather and probable lousy trail conditions to get to US 19E to meet Bett and Gale at 3 or 4 o’clock. We ate and packed up our gear as quickly as we could as we wanted to get started. The rain suits would definitely be needed today. 
The heavy rain turned the trail into swift flowing muddy creeks in most areas. Our waterproof boots filled with water running down our legs and our clothes were soaked from the neck and hand openings in our rain suits.  Hiking kept us warm for the most part. 
Generally, grassy balds are very scenic places with sweeping panoramic views of the surrounding countryside. Today, crossing theses areas were very difficult. We were blown sideways several times while trying make our way up both Little Hump and Big Hump. The frog strangling rain soaked us through to the skin through the tiniest openings in our rainsuits. Lightning popped uncomfortably close by. I told Mark that we needed get out of the kill zone that we were in. He replied in his blunt but reassuring manner: “Michael, if you get hit, you won’t know it”. We plodded on and managed to get into the safety of the woods before we got killed. We took a break and John caught up with us. He slipped down on some mud. He sat there and said “that is in the top ten of the stupidest things that I have ever done”. I said “what about going over the Firescald ridge during the high wind gusts?” John said “ I said top ten”.
We started down and walked on water flooded trails. Everything we had on including our boots were soaked.  We reached US 19E around 1:30. Gale and Bett were not due to get there by 3 or 4. Since we were not longer hiking, we got cold and started shivering. Fortunately, we were offered a ride by “Shannon”, a local trail maintainer and section hiker. He took us to “Bob’s Dairyland”, a hiker friendly restaurant, in the town of Roan Mt. We ate lunch and waited for our wives to pick us up.

We said our goodbyes but I was sad to see Gale go as it will be after May before I will see her again. To me, being separated from her is the hardest thing on this hike. Most hikers that have finished the AT have told us that the hike is 80% mental and 20% physical. I agree.I started out with my rain jacket on as it was a bit chilly. The jacket was soon stowed away after about 30 minutes of hiking as I warmed up. After an initial climb up from US 19E, the trail took on a rolling pattern. It took us across two gravel roads, along Elk river for a long stretch, past a cemetery in the middle of the woods and over several stream crossings. It was muddy in a few places but had no drastic elevation changes. We stopped at Mountaineer Shelter and ate lunch. Nearby was a nice waterfall, Mountaineer Falls, that would have been nice to get under in the summer when it is warmer.We decided to walk further and find a tentsite.

It doesn’t hurt but I will probably need a crown to fix it. We should get to a town that has dentist if it starts hurting. Otherwise, I will probably wait to I get back home.
Today’s trail had a lot more ups and downs than yesterday. We stayed above 3000 feet for about 5 miles. We then started losing elevation slowly then switchbacked down to what appeared to be an old farm. We passed an old barn constructed of logs with a couple of hikers eating lunch beside it. They told us that it was once occupied by a homeless person. Mark asked them “ is that his snake?”. They were unaware that a large black rat snake was sunning itself just a few feet from where they were sitting. They moved farther away from the barn to finish their lunch. 
We soon came to a paved road which we crossed over to the trailhead. We followed an old road that ran beside Laurel Fork river. The trail gradually gained elevation and passed through some cuts through the mountain. Mark felt that they were part of an old narrow gauge railroad. I agreed as the amount of rock that was removed was considerable. 
The trail then started down the mountain back towards Laurel Fork River. The path was essentially a boulder field that was rearranged somewhat to resemble a staircase. Our quads and knees got a workout navigating the rocks. We got to the bottom and found a large waterfall. We lingered there and ate lunch while enjoying the view. 
We had had short climb back up the rock stairs to the trail which paralleled the river for a short distance before we had walk on a narrow ledge on a cliff face above the swift flowing river. We then had to climb up another set of rock stairs where the path stretched along the river bank before having to climb another set of rock stairs up the mountain. Mark and I accidentally passed the Laurel Fork Shelter as we missed the sign to it.  We walked on crossing over the river a couple more times on foot bridges. We stopped where the trail would switchback up Pond Mountain and set up camp near by. John was a little way behind us and went to the shelter. He said that we didn’t miss anything because it was ratty.

It was 2 miles trailwise to get to the top. We stopped a Pond Flats, a campsite with a spring to refill our depleted water bottles. We ran across some hikers we knew, Big Heart, Johanna, and Tammy. We talked briefly with them while we waited for them to finish getting water from the spring. We rehydrated and refilled our bottles before    heading out again. 
We walked along the top for a little while before it started switchbacks down to Lake Watauga. We got down to a paved road and decided to stop for lunch and pickup a few items at Boots Off Hostel to get us to Damascus. We ate smoked brisket sandwiches, chips and a drink. John and I had a Klondike bar for dessert.  Mark had two. He said that he needed the calcium.
We left the hostel and headed down to the road. We walked along the road for about a half mile to the trailhead. The rain swollen lake flooded part of the trail so we had to take a bypass to higher ground.
The US Forest Service closed the section from the bypass trailhead to Watauga Lake Dam indefinitely in 2017 to everyone but AT through hikers due to aggressive bear activity. This included a shelter.  No camping, picnicking or lingering in this area was allowed. AT hikers to encouraged to get through the area as quickly as possible. 
We made it to the dam and waited on John to catch up. We then started across the dam and met a Tennessee Game Warden. We stopped and chatted for a little while. He asked us if we had any bear trouble or if there were anything that he needed to know. We said that we hadn’t seen any bears. John said that he heard something big in the brush but he couldn’t see what it actually was. The Game Warden walked up the trail while we continued across the dam and walked up the road to the trail head. The climb up from the dam was long and tiring. We were getting short on water and the next source was about 5 miles away. We went up and down several times before catching a ridge that wound its way up to the top of a mountain. By the time we got to the spring, we were down to our last swallow. We used our filters to drink water to rehydrate  before refilling the bottles. 
We decided to camp there for the night as the next easily available water source was another five miles. There was a water source at the Vandeventer shelter 2 miles away but it was about a half mile down a very steep ravine.","Tentsite at foot of Pond Mountain

This morning John got ready and left about 30 minutes ahead of Mark and myself. He left complaining about the bear activity around his tent during the night. He said that they came around twice as he was trying to sleep. He stayed in his tent and made noises to drive them off. Neither Mark nor I heard anything but another hiker that camped on a ridge before the spring walked by and asked if we had seen them. We told him that we didn’t since we sleep pretty sound. 
We had a steep but short climb to a ridge which carried us to Vandeventer Shelter which was perched on a cliff with a fantastic view of Lake Watauga and surrounding areas. We stayed long enough to make a Kodak moment and moved on. 
We were able to stay on the ridge that had a few gaps but no drastic elevation changes. We stopped at a memorial/Grave (?) to Nick Grindstaff that appeared to be fashioned from an old fireplace. It was apparently put there by his niece(s) and/or nephew(s) as it had “Uncle” at the top of the head stone. He was born Dec 26, 1851 and died July 22, 1923. An inscription said “ Lived alone, suffered alone and died alone”. 
We left there and happened across a hiker that we know, Tammy, getting her ankle taped by Johanna. Big Heart was also there. Tammy had sprained it and needed help getting to a road so that she could get somewhere and have it looked at. We divided up her gear and toted it out to the road while she limped down. We had to go 3 miles to the road and we returned her gear. We wished her well and left. Big Heart and Johanna were going to town with her.
The AT trailhead across the road led to a handicap compliant path that extended about a half mile through a large pasture.    The green grass field was speckled with the most dandelions that I have ever seen in one place. Numerous bees, which appeared to be mostly bumblebees, were flying around the yellow flowers. 
The handicap compliant portion of the trail ended at a nice bench on a knoll which offered a excellent view of the green with yellow poka dotted field. 
The trail continued on and crossed a fence to an adjacent field. There were some strategically placed boulders with the white blaze painted on them to guide us through the pasture. The trail then crossed another fence before going into the woods.

This was their sixth year of doing this for hikers. We thanked them for their kindness and moved on. Again, these AT alumni that do this are very friendly and kind.

 By mid afternoon, the sun came out and made it a beautiful day.  The town was over run with people renting bikes for the Virginia Creeper Trail. The trail, a repurposed rail right of way, extends for 33 miles from Abington through Damascus to White Top. Evidently, biking the Creeper Trail is a big thing. 
We walked around town looking at some of the well kept homes and checking out some of the info boards for historical facts about the town. It seems that Damascus was a big lumber town back in the day with millions of board feet from trees cut from the surrounding mountains. 
We stopped at the three outfitters in town and ended up buying a couple of items. Most of our resupply came from Dollar General. We also picked up a few things from Crazy Larry’s hiker box that he actually helps stock with food items.
Lunch for me was a Philly cheesesteak from Mojo’s. Mark and John went to Subway. Afterwards, we went back to Crazy Larry’s to relax a while. He gave each of us a Klondike bar for dessert. 
Mark decided to get a hair cut. John and I both futilely tried to talk him out of it by reminding him that he said that he wasn’t going to cut it until after we finish the trail.

Afterwards, we got our gear packed up. We thanked Larry for his hospitality. He took our picture for his Facebook page and wished us well. Larry was a generous and gracious host and an overall good guy.
The trail merged with the Creeper Trail for about a mile as it went out of town. It  then veered up a mountain. The climb out of the river valley was very long with a lot of switchbacks. We reached a ridge that paralleled the Creeper Trail for a while before veering away and up to another ridge. The trail did not have any large ups or downs for a good while. It then started down to a road. We crossed the road and started another switchback climb up. We got to the top and decided to stop to eat lunch and water refill at Saunders Shelter. We all had to use the privy which was the first one since we left North Carolina. John came back and began telling us how everything in Virginia was better using the privy as an example. Tennessee didn’t have privys after the Smokies and North Carolina’s were so small that you couldn’t close the door if it had one. After we got back on the trail, John didn’t let up. Virginia’s rocks were flatter, better weather, trails softer, water sweeter and so forth. I tripped on a root and brought that to his attention. He said “if that had been in Tennessee, I would have fallen down”. This went on for at least an hour. The trail wound back down the mountain and intersected and merged with the Creeper Trail again.  We walked a mile or so pausing only to talk with a couple riding bikes on the trail. They were fascinated that we were AT through hikers and asked us questions about it. We in turn asked them about the Creeper Trail.  We walked further and crossed a long trestle. We passed by a black rat snake that was sunning itself on the bridge. The trail then turned back into the woods. We started switchbacking up until we got to a ridge that led us to Lost Mountain Shelter. Most folks were tenting so we took spots in the shelter.","Damascus, VA
",Lost Mountain Shelter,"Apr 28, Sun",15.60
Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612245,"We got up earlier than usual. We were looking at two long climbs, White Top and Mt. Rogers, so we wanted to get a early start. 
Fortunately, the gap between Lost Mountain and White Top didn’t cost a whole lot of elevation. However, the path  up was a very long climb. After initial switchbacks, the trail slowly wound its way up around the mountain flank. We reached an area where the clouds were low so we hiked in cold damp fog the rest of the way up. 
There was a grassy bald on top which haven’t been too friendly to us recently. This one followed suit as the fog shrouded any Kodak moments and the high wind tried to blow us away.  The trail made sure that we had maximum exposure to these elements. 
We finally reached the other side and re- entered the woods where the trail started winding down towards the next gap. There we crossed a Forest Service road before climbing to a ridge that would get us to Mt. Rogers. 
After initial switchbacks, the trail became more steeper and lot more rocky.   Since I don’t have a full range of motion in my right foot, I have to turn my foot to the side and walk like “Chester” of the TV show “Gunsmoke” in the steeper areas of the trail. I have found that it is the most comfortable way to get up the steep areas. 
The rocky conditions of the trail were killing our ankles and feet. We finally got to the top and found a grassy/brushy areas that extended over wide swaths of the mountainside. Three of the “ feral” ponies that the Forest Service keeps up there greeted us as we walked up the trail looking for a handout. The Forest Service discourages trying to pet or feed the ponies. Nevertheless, some hikers bring carrots and pet them. The ponies also like to lick the salt off of sweaty skin. We saw several hikers allow one friendly pony to like the sweat off their exposed legs. One hiker had his leg nipped by one.The shelter was a two story structure and soon filled. We got there in time to get spaces for the night.","Lost Mountain Shelter

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612279,"Our bear canisters evidently work. I went to fetch our canisters and they were moved from where Mark stashed them. My canister was moved about 15 yards from Mark’s and both his and mine were very scratched up. One of my securing lugs was missing. Another hiker’s canister was also scratched up. She was tenting a little distance away and confirmed that a bear was trying to get in them. 
After eating and packing up our gear, we set out on the trail which took us through more of the pony grazing area. It wound us around some of the exposed rock outcroppings which gave us pretty good views of the surrounding countryside. The downside is that we were walking on rocky surfaces which were working on our feet and ankles again. 
John was a little more subdued with his “Virginia is Great” after we wore our feet and ankles yesterday and were doing it again today. Mark got on him a little asking him where were the flat rocks and soft Virginia trails were. John drifted back for a little while. The trail wound us around Grayson Highlands State Park and US National Forest land which both had feral ponies grazing on them. They were more timid than the ones near the shelter. We found out later that they were put there to keep the range open by the US Forest Service for wildlife habitat. We took a break at Wise Shelter and ran into a couple of hikers that we knew but haven’t seen since leaving Georgia. Mike and Alice were slack packing a section of the trail. Alice had hurt her foot and was unable to tote a pack for a while. We chatted for a little while then wished each other well before moving on. The trail became a little less rocky after we left the Grayson Highlands. The smoother surface helped us make better time. We stopped at Old Orchard Shelter for another break and to get water. We decided to hike further towards Hurricane Shelter about 5 miles away.  Since it was forecast to rain later in the week, we wanted to get as close to Marian, VA, our resupply point, as possible. We got to the shelter around 5 o’clock but all of the spaces were taken including the few adjacent tentsites. We found a spot at the junction of the trail going to the shelter and the AT and set up camp. A few more hikers were tenting close by.","Thomas Knob Shelter

Our original plan was to get to Trimpi Shelter 9 miles away and spend the night before the rain got there.  It turns out that we had another pretty day to walk. The trail had a few ups and downs but no drastic changes. A trail maintainer set up trail magic at a parking area near road that we crossed. We had met the gentleman and his dog before at a footbridge at a steam crossing. The bridge was closed but he said that he crossed it a few minutes earlier staying to one side. Mark went under the bridge and saw where it was broken. We decided to cross it one at a time by walking slow and staying to the non broken side. We all crossed with out incident and moved on. We continued on the trail to the road crossing and the guy at the bridge had drinks, sausage biscuits, hard boiled eggs and chips. I had had one of each except for the chips which I had two. We talked with him for a little while. He was John’s age (70) so he was very impressed that John was doing the AT. We thanked him for his kindness and moved on. We made it to Trimpi Shelter and took a lunch break. We filled our water bottles and decided to walk further and tent.

We stopped at the Partnership Shelter that was about 150 yards from the nature center. It was a very nice large two story shelter that could hold 16 hikers. It had a cold shower available also. 
We walked on to the welcome center and waited on the shuttle. It got there around 11:30 and we got to the Travel Inn where we booked a couple of nights.
Our room would not be ready until later in the afternoon, so the manager let us stash our gear while we walked a little over a half mile to Pizza Hut where we pigged out on the Pizza Buffet. We went by Walmart on the way back and bought our food resupply. We left there and took our stuff back to the room and each of us got showers. 
We then spent time getting our gear out of our packs, hanging up our sleeping bags so that they could air out, taking our   food out of the boxes and reloading our bear canisters. 
We were getting hungry again so we went to a Mexican restaurant about a 1/4 mile away, Mi Puerto, and ate. The food was good and they had a brisk business. We saw some hikers that we knew, such as Big Heart, and spoke with them for little while. They had already spent their zero day and were heading back to the trail on Friday. 
Mark and I decided we needed some more  clothes so we went back to Walmart and bought some. I also bought a Sawyer Squeeze to replace my Sawyer Mini which I felt was too slow to filter water.

First, I had to repair my right boot as the rubber toe guard came loose and was hanging on rocks and roots. Second, Marian had a Walmart which offers more variety than the Dollar General that we have been using in some of the smaller towns. Plus both Mark and I needed some more clothes as we have both lost a lot of weight since we started. So far I am down about 26 pounds. Mark said he was down about 20 and John is down about 15. Which leads to the Third reason,  we need to eat more calories as we are not getting enough on the trail. Forth, we have seen a lot more wildflowers blooming and more leaves on the trees which means bug season is on us. None of us have seen a tick yet so the time off combined with a sunny day will allow us to treat our clothes and tents with permethrin. 
We woke up and decided to walk to the post office a little over a mile away. Mark and I were going to mail some clothes and my Sawyer Mini back to Mark’s house.  It didn’t open until 9 o’clock so we planned to eat breakfast first at Sisters, a breakfast and lunch restaurant that Big Heart recommended. It was near the post office so it was not out of the way. 
We passed an old railroad terminal that was repurposed as offices. They kept a lot of the decor so the looked around. We then passed a building a little ways down the road that had a bronze plague commemorating it as the site where Mt. Dew was formulated by Bill Jones, President of the Top Corporation, during the early 1950’s. 
Big Heart had suggested getting the rosemary/Parmesan cheese  grits at Sisters. Since I have never tried any before,  I got a side dish of those to go with my hash brown casserole and biscuits with sausage gravy and coffee. All were very good. 
We left there and went to the Post Office and mailed our stuff to Mark’s house. We stopped by the Army/Navy store to see if they had any permethrin. Mark bought a bottle and I bought a pair of Injinji toe sock liners to replace some that I wore holes in. 
We stopped by Walmart to buy a cheap pair of shorts and tee shirt that we could wear while we sprayed our clothes with the permethrin. The hotel manager let us string a clothes line on the backside of the building. We hung up our clothes and tent and sprayed them and then let them dry for an hour or so before bringing them back in. 
We ate lunch at Bojangles since it was across the street. We could see it raining in the distance and didn’t want to get caught out in it. The Dollar Tree was close by so we stopped there to get me a toothbrush and Mark his ice cream fix. I also got me a pint so Mark didn’t have to eat his alone. I could probably use the calcium also. 
We came back to the room to started packing up our gear and relax a little bit. Around 5 o’clock, we went to subway for dinner and get a sandwich for the trail. It rained while we were there and we waited a little while until it stopped. We made it back to the room before it started raining again. 
We called a shuttle service that was going to pick us up at 8:30 Saturday morning. Since we were trying to calorie load before going back out on the trail. We planned to go to McDonald’s to eat breakfast before the shuttle arrived,","Marion, Va

The trail was more of a roller coaster today. The ups and downs were more pronounced than we seen since we left the Grayson Highlands. The path surface was as rocky as ever to which my feet and ankles can attest. Despite these undesirable conditions, we made pretty good time. I am thinking that it was due to a combination of full bellies and a full day’s rest. 
We came across a prescribed burn area where the Forest Service was probably getting rid of invasive plants and leaf build up. They had closed this part of the trail back on April 29th due to the burn. From the looks of it, they used the trail as a border for the burn area. 
We got to the top of the mountain and ran into a couple of day hikers eating lunch. We stopped and answered their questions about our through hike and our bear canisters. We related our experience  at Thomas Knob Shelter where a bear tried to get into our canisters. 
We continued on until we got to Chatfield Shelter where stopped for lunch. A hiker from Dublin,Ireland was already there eating lunch. We chatted for a while and found out that he decided to hike the AT after reading Bill Bryson’s book, A Walk in the Woods. He was recently retired and was known as a “hill walker” back home. He discussed it with his wife and she gave him her “ok”. He also said that he needed to get to Pearisburg, VA as his wife was going to meet him there in a few days. He said that he was wearing himself out trying to get there on time. We wished him well and safe travels.
I ate both halves of my Subway that I packed out. Mark and John saved one half  of their sandwiches for dinner. We packed up and left the shelter aiming to get to a tentsite before the rain that was supposed to start at 5 o’clock. 
The trail conditions actually the merciless rocks that we had been walking on faded away and was replaced by a relatively smooth surface under a rhododendron grove. We crossed several streams then initiated a slight climb to where we came across an old farm that was preserved as a museum.
We looked around and checked out the outbuildings that were identified such as the well house, which had an actual working hand pump, a root cellar, a granary, firewood house, a wash house, old farm implements and a corn crib. 
The farm house was in excellent condition. It was a two story with large porches on each level. The kitchen was attached to the back of the house and had its own small porch. The gate to the white picket fence was locked so we couldn’t get a look inside. 
We left there and got back on the trail. After we crossed a powerline right of way, we found a sign indicating that their was trail magic in a one room school house a short way down the trail. 
The trail passed right by the school house so we stopped to check out the building and the trail magic. The Lindamood School was built in 1894 and was used until the 1930’s. 
I understand that the local Methodist church owns the building and supplies the soft drinks and snacks for the trail magic inside the school. They have a sign that asks the hikers help keep the place clean by using the trash cans provided. I signed their guest book and made a donation to their preservation fund. We left there and continued on favorable trail conditions. We crossed several pastures and a couple of creeks before reaching Atkins, VA near I 81. We followed the white blaze marks up US 11 until we had to turn off and go under the I 81 overpass. The trail then turned off a crossed a few more pastures, including one with some cows and their calves. We finally climbed up to a fence crossing and re-entered the woods. We reached our campsite a little while later, got water and set up our tents right before it started raining.","Marion, VA

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612960,"It was raining when we went to sleep. It was raining when we woke up. The rain continued as we broke camp. It rained on us as we hiked.
We had a long climb in the rain over Walker Mountain right off the bat. We got to the top and walked in a damp cloud. The rain made the trail muddy but it didn’t get slippery until we started down the other side. The one positive to this wet and muddy hike was there were no rock piles to add their misery to our walk. 
We got down to the gap and walked through a rhododendron grove that was especially muddy. My rain suit functioned more like a sweat suit as I was soaking wet from sweat. I took off my rain jacket and stowed it away in my pack. Wet is wet. It is little difference whether it is from sweat or rain. 
We crossed a paved road before following the trail through a pasture until it entered the woods. We climbed a small knoll before going down into a gap and crossing a creek. We had to go over another small hill before crossing another paved road to get to Maul Knob.
The trail up Maul Knob began as a steep set of steps cut into the ground. This got us to steep switchbacks which got us to a steep trail going straight up for the most part. This got us to where the trail wound its way up to the top. 
We crossed over to the switchbacks going down. They were significantly less steep than the ones coming up. We reached a gap where the trail led us to the shelter. 
We got unpacked and changed into my five dollar swimsuit and my nine dollar hi- vis shirt that I bought in Marion. We hung up our clothes in a feeble but futile effort dry them. About an hour later, the rain stopped until later that night.","Tentsite at Mile 547.4

My clothes, including underwear and socks, were still wet. It is funny how the wetness makes skunky clothes smell worse. I considered wearing some dry clothes but since the sun was coming out and that I more than likely smelled as bad or worse as my wet clothes, I put my wet ones back on. I did put on dry socks hoping that I would have a chance to dry my others.
Mark made us some coffee and we both ate protein bars and whatever else jumped into our hands when we reached into our bear canisters. I am not sure what John ate. He gets off by himself and eats oatmeal or something. 
The trail started winding down the mountain. It was also muddy from all the rain so we had to walk like penguins to keep our footing in several areas. We got down to a creek that the trail crossed over several times before getting to a paved road. 
We stopped and took a break and refilled our water bottles. The climb before us was going to be a long one. Chestnut Knob was around 4400 feet and we were around 2300.
We walked across the road and almost immediately began climbing. The switchbacks were steep in a lot of areas which required me to use my “Chester” walk along with really digging in with my poles. 
Eventually, the switchbacks became a little less steep and we made easier progress. We stopped at a spring fed stream and refilled our water bottles. We also soaked our handkerchiefs to wipe off our faces and necks. 
The trail wound up around the mountain until we reached a grassy bald. The sun was shining and we had a gentle breeze. This was strange because the last several times that we crossed one of these the weather was trying to kill us. The Bald was very large and we had a long climb to the top where Chester Knob Shelter was located. 
We took a long break at the shelter to recover from the climb, eat lunch and dry our rain suits and tents. We could see the town of Burke’s Garden in the distance. It looked like it was set in a crater as it was ringed by mountain ridges. A couple of SOBO section hikers told us that the bowl was formed by limestone eroding away leaving the bowl. They said the locals call it “God’s Thumbprint”. The stone shelter was a repurposed Fire Warden’s cabin which made it pretty large for a shelter. Nearby, we found an old foundation for a fire tower. Since it was still pretty early in the day, we decided to hike further with the intentions of camping at Walker’s Gap. We started down the trail and followed a ridge most of the way down. We reached the gap and discovered that the campsite was close to the road. Also, the water didn’t look too good. We started climbing a ridge with the hope that we could find a campsite with water close by. Unfortunately, we didn’t find any campsites with water available. We continued along the rocky ridge until we reached  the Blue Blaze to Davis Farm Campsite. The campsite is about a half mile down a steep trail. Mark started setting up at a campsite on the ridge while went to fetch water.We found out from a passing hiker that John set up about a mile or so behind us.

Neither of us wanted to make the one mile round trip down the mountain to get more. Protein bars were the meal of the morning. We wanted to get to a water source which meant that we had to get off of the ridge. 
The ridge had a few more climbs before winding down to the valley. We finally got far enough down to where we crossed a stream. We stopped and rehydrated ourselves then refilled our water bottles. We then walked until we got to Jenkins Shelter and took a break. John rejoined us there. He said that he had another bear try to get his food sack. He managed to make enough noise to drive it away. 
We continued our descent towards Laurel Creek. We crossed the bridge and decided to eat lunch and pick up water. We then started the climb out of the valley. The trail was initially steep but soon settled into more reasonable switchbacks. We got up to a ridge and followed it for a mile or so before climbing up to another one. 
This led us to an old logging road which took us up the mountain. The grade was steady but very long. We decided to camp on an overlook with a great view of the valley below.","Tentsite at 576.9

The sun hadn’t chased away the cloud that had settled over valley which gave it a interesting but pretty view.  Our goal was to make it to Jenny Knob Shelter as rain was forecast for the late afternoon. 
The trail took us down towards the valley even though we had to climb up occasionally to a ridge to follow. We reached a gravel road where a trail angel left three gallon jugs of water and a box full of snacks. Since bears were active in this area, the water and snacks were put out this morning. We each refilled one bottle and picked a few snacks for the trail. I got a bag of jalapeño flavored Fritos to have with my ramen soup for dinner. I have never tried this flavor of Fritos before. Hopefully, they won’t be a “two burn” variety. 
The trail followed the gravel road down to an intersection with a paved road. We stopped at Brushy Mountain Grocery for second breakfast. The AWOL trail guide indicated that they served breakfast and lunch. Mark and I had the breakfast plate which came with two eggs, bacon or sausage, biscuit with gravy and a cup of coffee. John ordered the Brushy Mountain Burger which was a regular cheeseburger with toppings with the addition of a 1” thick slice of fried bologna. The sandwich was impressive to look at but John managed to finish eating it. Mark ordered a regular hamburger to eat for dinner on the trail. 
The owner refilled our water bottles before we left the store. The trail continued down the paved road crossing I - 81 before turning down hill to the trailhead. Naturally, we had to climb to a ridge using steep switchbacks. However, once we got on top the ups and downs were moderate and we were able to make good progress. There wasn’t any water on the ridge so we had to nurse our supply until we got to the shelter. We managed to get there with one swallow left. We dropped our packs and “cameled up” then refilled our bottles plus our Sawyer Squeeze bags. While eating dinner, a doe walked up about 25 yards away from us.

We dropped our packs and walked the 0.3 mile trail to check it out. It was a nice waterfall with a swimming hole below it. It was similar to Turkey Creek Falls a few miles from my house. 
We returned to the trail and walked until we reached the shelter. A couple of hikers that we know, Mike and Alice, were there eating lunch. They were still slack packing as Alice’s foot had not yet healed. We also met a young man from Australia that was through hiking the trail.
We decided to walk on to Doc’s Knob Shelter to spend the night. Rain was still in the forecast so we wanted to be in a shelter if we could. We had a significantly steeper and longer climb from the shelter. However, after we got to the top of the mountain, we followed the ridge a long way. The negative was that we also were walking on the Virginia rock pile the same distance. 
We stopped at a rock outcropping that had a spectacular view of the valley and surrounding mountains. The houses and farms below were tiny from our viewpoint. We lingered there for a few minutes before moving on. 
The rocky trail continued to abuse our feet down the side of the mountain and across the gap. We were getting short on water so we started looking for a spring to get some. We found a small seep that looked clean enough and had sufficient flow to scoop out water. While we were filling our bottles, Mike and Alice stopped and asked us if we seen the bear a little ways back off the trail. Evidently, we were focused on finding water and must of walked past it without noticing. Alice said that they made some noise but the bear just looked at them as they passed it. 
We hiked on and parted ways with Mike and Alice at a gravel road that we came to. They were staying at Woods Hole Hostel for the night.

We saw a break in the weather and set out for Bailey’s Gap Shelter. The trail followed ridges for a long way. The path was not particularly muddy but there were plenty of wet and slick rocks and roots to work on our feet and ankles. 
We stray Pine Swamp Shelter for lunch. Rain showers chased us back in the shelter as we were eating and taking a rest. Mark and I had taken off our boots and wrung out our socks in a futile effort to dry them in what little sunlight was available. The boots were hopelessly wet. The sporadic rain showers finally caused us to give up and put them back on so we continue on the trail. 
We left the shelter and followed a large creek for while before crossing a footbridge to a road crossing. From there we had a little over a half mile gradual climb until the trail steepened considerably. The steep trail continued until we got to the shelter.","Rice Field Shelter

Mark’s and John’s were the same or not much better. I ate my last Gatorade protein bar for breakfast.  I was still hungry but needed to conserve something for tomorrow. John and Mark were also having to ration their food. Mark made us the last of the coffee. The unplanned zero at Rice Field Shelter cut into our food supply.
Our goal for the day was to get to Laurel Creek Shelter which would put us within 5 miles of a paved road. There was a local grocery store, Super Value, that was 8 miles from the trail. We will need to either walk or hitchhike to get there. We started off on a ridge and followed it for a few miles. The rain finally stopped but we were harassed by a cold breeze and suffered through another wet rocky trail surface. The path turned off the ridge and started switchbacks down the mountain. It seemed a long way down to War Spur Shelter where we stopped for lunch. Leaving there, we traveled across the gap  crossing a Forest Service road before making a long climb up. The trail was steep in places and there were practically no switchbacks. One especially long steep area took us quite a while to climb. We got to the top and walked on rocks most of the way. The trail finally started down again with few switchbacks. It was muddy in several long stretches due to the rainfall. We reached the shelter and took spots because tonight was supposed to be colder than last night.","Bailey Gap Shelter

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613963,"We woke to a clear cold morning. My breakfast consisted of a protein bar and a nutrigrain bar. Mark ate his last Gatorade bar and a pack of peanut butter crackers.  John had a couple of eatables left. This was the last of our food so we needed to get to Newport, VA to resupply. Since Newport was 8 miles off the trail, we either had to walk there or hitchhike. Either way, I have found during this AT hike that thirst and hunger are powerful motivators. 
First we had to get to VA 42 so we set out on the trail a little after 7 o’clock. The path crisscrossed a creek several times. I slipped on a wet rock in the midst of crossing the creek and took a tumble.  I got a little wet and probably had a bruise or two but was not injured. My pack absorbed most of the impact. 
We then had a short steep climb which led us to a large pasture which we crossed to get to the road. 
We found a sign that indicated VA 42 East so we walked up the road with our thumbs stuck out. Our efforts to catch a hitch were unproductive.  We had walked about a mile and a half up the road when we discovered that we had gone the wrong way. Fortunately, just when we decided to turn around and started walking the other way, a trail angel named Jill, stopped and offered us a ride. We told her that we needed to resupply and that we hadn’t much to eat the last couple of days. 
She was on her way to buy gas at the same store that we needed to get to.  Mark bought her gas for her and she patiently waited as we picked out and paid for our food. She then took us to another store that had a good counter. I ordered two cheeseburgers, one for the trail, a small tub of Mac and cheese, a small tub of baked beans and two jelly filled donuts. Mark bought two hamburgers with one of those for the trail and some candy bars. John got chicken fingers and a corn dog. He also bought a hamburger for Jill for helping us. 
After eating, Jill dropped us off at the trailhead. We thanked her again for her kindness. As we were leaving, she gave a ride to another hiker that was leaving the trail and going home. We have met some genuinely kind people who go out of there way to help others. 
We left the road and started the climb up Sinking Creek Mountain. We passed through a couple of large pastures before entering the woods. The trail took us past the “Keffer Oak” which is one of the largest and oldest in Virginia. My phone was out of charge so Mark took the Kodak moment with his phone. 
The climb began getting steeper until we reach several flights of stones arranged to resemble steps. Our quads got a workout but the steps helped us gain elevation quicker. We got to the top and followed the ridge for quite a while. Initially, the trail surface was relatively smooth. We noticed several piles of rocks along the trail that were evidently for some purpose. It had to take a considerable amount of effort to stack them up in cairn-like fashion so I doubt that it was done just to improve the trail surface. Nevertheless, it sure make walking easier.
Along the way, we saw a doe grazing about 25 yards from us. She kept her eye on us as we passed but did not bolt. 
The smooth surface ended and the rocks were back to torment our feet and ankles. We then had to scramble over some boulders which put us on the “rock slide”. This was a cliff walk that provided some excellent views of the surrounding mountains and valley below. However, the rock surface was slanted about 45 degrees in most places which made footing tricky. Mark must have lost his adrenal gland as he walked over them like they were flat. I took a more cautious approach as I semi crawled over them. It took us a while to pass over them until we got to flatter and less dangerous areas.We reached the end of the ridge and the rocky trail started winding down the mountain flank. We eventually found softer trail surfaces about a mile before reaching the shelter.","Laurel Creek Shelter

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614007,"We woke around 6 o’clock and started packing up our gear. Our breakfast was a lot more filling due to our resupply. Our plan was to hike to Pickle Branch Shelter which is a little shorter day than we want. The problem was that the trail guide did not show any reliable water until the next shelter which was 13 miles further. 
We had a long and steady climb up Brushy Mountain. The trail had plenty of switchbacks and reasonable grade inclined to get us up to the top without busting our lungs. We also didn’t have to walk on a rock pile very often which was good for our ankles and feet. 
We got to the top and spent some time at the Audie Murphy Memorial erected by the VFW.  The inscription said the he died in a plane crash in 1971 near that site. It also recognized him as the most decorated soldier of WW II. There was a flag pole nearby that was equipped with LED lights to shine on the US Flag at night. A rock cairn had been built next to and around the marble memorial. It was decorated with small US Flags, dog tags, medals, patches, coins and other items left by visitors. 
We left the memorial and followed a long ridge across the mountain.  We reached the other side and started down the other side. It was a long way down but the trail had plenty of switchbacks to help with our knees. 
We got to the gap and refilled our water bottles. We had used all of it going over the mountain. We then set out on an bunch of steps dug into the ground to get us to a switchback. We soon encountered another set of steps that got us to another switchback and continued that pattern until we got to the top of the ridge. We then followed the ridge until the junction of the trail with the path to the shelter. We considered to walk farther but were concerned that we would run short on water. We had to walk downhill for a 1/3 mile to the shelter and another 1/4 mile further to a creek. 
Alice and Mike showed up a little while later. It was Alice’s first day back on the trail with a full pack. She said that her foot was still sore so they may slack pack some more. We briefly discussed the “machete man” murder.  It was not clear exactly what happened. From what Mike and Alice understood, the murdered hiker was a veteran that pulled three tours in Iraq. He was part of the wounded warriors project where veterans with PTSD were hiking the AT as part of their therapy. Alice told us that some hikers went home due to the incident including one female veteran with PTSD that she knew. Alice didn’t seem to be as enthusiastic about hiking the AT as before. I suppose here sore foot along with the murder and seeing hikers that she knew leave the trail is discouraging her. Hopefully, she will rediscover what brought her and Mike to the AT.","Niday Shelter

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614008,"We woke to an overcast sky. It appeared that rain would be on us soon. We quickly packed our gear and ate so we could get a jump on the weather.  We told Mike and Alice good bye and encouraged Alice to take care of her foot but keep going. 
We climbed back to the AT and walked a short distance before starting an immediate climb to a ridge. We followed a gradual ascent to where we started encountering large boulders that we had to climb around and over. The rain moved in on us along with some lightning and thunder. The ridge kept taking us higher and over and around more boulders. A hiker named “Pick Me Up” asked to walk with us as he was afraid of lightning. I guess that it made him feel better that he wouldn’t die alone if we got hit. 
We passed by a few exposed areas that would have provided some excellent views if it wasn’t rainy and foggy. 
The lightning and thunder stopped so Pick Me Up being a younger guy and a faster hiker soon left us. 
We finally got to the blue blaze trail to Dragon’s Tooth which is a large stone monolith. Since it was rainy and foggy, we passed up the Kodak moment to get off the ridge. 
The trail down was basically a cliff descent. We literally had to drop down our trekking poles and crawl down wet boulders. It took us about an hour to navigate the 3/4 mile to better trail conditions. We ran into a couple of more areas afterwards that also required us to crawl down before reaching some switchbacks that took us down the mountain.  As we neared the bottom, the Rain stopped and the sun came out. I was kind of bummed out because several times when there is a good view or something to see, it would be raining or storming. We got to a road and walked about a half mile to Catawba Grocery where each of us picked up a few items and ordered a Hunts Brothers Pizza. Perhaps my discriminating palate has been compromised since I have been on the trail, but this is the second time I have ordered one of these and both were excellent. While we were there, we ran into our old friend Chappy who we haven’t seen since the Smokies. He was waiting on a shuttle to Roanoke to meet his wife. He hasn’t seen her since he has started on the trail.We also ran into Big Heart and his group. They had spent the night at a local hostel, Four Pines, and was getting lunch before heading back on the trail. We finished our lunch and headed back to the trailhead. We had an immediate climb to a ridge which we followed until the trail wound down to a large creek. The path followed the creek for quite a while. We passed by the remnants of an old water powered mill. The steel water wheel was there along with some foundation but most of it was long gone. The trail turned away from the creek and led us through a series of large pastures before climbing back into the woods. We then started switchbacks that got us up to a ridge which we followed all the way to parking lot for McAfee Knob.  We then hiked about two miles to the shelter.","Pickle Branch Shelter

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614029,"The rain storm arrived around 11 o’clock last night. Normally, I am a sound sleeper; however, the combination of a howling wind and driving rain woke me up. The intense portion lasted only a short while. Then, it diminished to a light rain and only a slight breeze. I managed to go back to sleep and woke up to a clear morning. 
We got up early as we knew that we had McAfee Knob to finish and Tinker Cliffs a few miles behind it. We packed up and ate breakfast before starting the climb up. We were up pretty high on the ridge already so the trail up to McAfee Knob was not a steep grade. 
We got to the Knob which was a large cliff with a tremendous view of the Catawba Valley. In the distance, we could see that we would follow the ridge around the valley to Tinkers Cliffs a few miles away. McAfee’s Knob is a popular spot and several people were already there admiring the view and taking pictures. 
We left there and started down the trail. The way down was a whole lot easier than the path down from Dragon’s Tooth. We passed several people on their way to the bluff. 
We came across a stretch of the ridge where huge boulders jutted out of the ground at a 45 degree angle. Some of these we had to walk part way under. Others, we had to climb over, around and/or down. Intermittently, we came across an overlook that gave us a nice view of the valley or a large lake on the opposite side of the ridge. 
We had a fairly steep climb to Tinker’s Cliffs. The width of the ridge did not permit switchbacks so it was a straight steep ramp up or assumed a slightly serpentine shape in some areas.
We got to the top and the trail took us over to the cliffs. Again, the view was spectacular and in some ways was better than McAfee’s Knob. The total bluff area was much larger for one and the overall view of the valley for another. However, the boulders here were more cracked and stacked up on each other. If one or more of these got moving there would be nothing that would nothing that would stop them from going all the way to the bottom of the valley. 
The trail followed along the cliffs with its magnificent views for a half mile or so before turning back into the woods. We continued to climb over and around boulders as the trail endeavored to stay on top of the ridge. 
We reached a set of switchbacks that took us to a gap where it led us to Campbell Shelter. This was the last shelter until after Troutville. We ate lunch there and refilled our water bottles. Since we were on National Park Service land and the NPS restricts camping to shelters and designated campsites we either had to stay there for the night or walk to Daleville. In addition, rain was forecast for the next day and we haven’t had a shower or shave in nine days. We ultimately decided to make the trek to Daleville. 
We left the shelter and followed a creek for a while before climbing gradually back up to the ridge. From there, the ridge trail continued gain elevation with a few steep serpentine paths up to an exposed rocky area. We crawled over and around these boulders for some time. There were some overlooks that provided some nice views of a large lake in the valley below. 
We continued to follow the ridge navigating around and over several areas with large boulders. We finally turned down some switchbacks that got us down from the ridge and walking towards Daleville. The trail intersected VA 220. A Howard Johnson motel was close by so we booked a room for the night.","Catawba Shelter

John’s wife was to pick us up at 12 o’clock. We waited around in our room and checked out just before 11 o’clock. We then waited in the lobby until she arrived.
John introduced us to his wife, Lynn and his granddaughter, Carly. We climbed in her Chevy Traverse and se drove us to a house in nearby Troutville that she rented. We unloaded our packs and the boxes and ice chest that Lynn brought with her. 
We met the owners, Mr. and Mrs. Mark Nelson. His family was originally from Wisconsin so it is doubtful that they are any kin. The house, located on their farm, was originally his mother’s before she moved to Florida. They remodeled it and rent it out on a per night basis. Both he and his wife were gracious hosts. 
After we got settled, Lynn started to push food on us. She gave us soft drinks, snacks, crescent rolls with pepperoni in them. A little while later, she made us lunch with barbecue sandwiches with Mac and cheese. She puts bacon in her Mac and cheese which gives it a nice flavor. 
After lunch, we washed our clothes and hung them out on a clothesline that the owners allowed us to put up. We also emptied our bags to take stock of our supplies.

John drove us to Walmart to resupply. He then took us to a local outfitter so that Mark and I could look at and perhaps buy new backpacks. I had fell so many times on mine that I had broken one of the extruded aluminum braces. In addition, the buckles for the shoulder straps and the belt were worn to the point that they kept slipping. Mark had similar issues with his pack. Our ten year old packs were at the end of their useful life. 
Ultimately, we didn’t buy because the prices were significantly higher than REI for the same pack. We ordered on line and had them sent to Gale so that she could bring them on the 30th. Lynn made us some loaded nachos for lunch. Dinner was steak and corn on the cob.","Troutville

Lynn dropped us off at the trailhead across from the Howard Johnson. After thanking her for her hospitality and John saying his goodbyes, we walked back the mile and a half back to the house and picked up our packs. 
We then walked back to the trail and started climbing up and over a knoll. We then crossed a road and a creek before climbing another knoll that led us through a large pasture. The path entered the woods and started switchbacking up a mountain. We reached Fullhardt Knob Shelter after five miles of hiking and took a break. There was no water source so we couldn’t top off before leaving. The trail followed a ridge down crossing a couple of creeks. We refilled our bottles and “cameled up”. We passed by a historical marker that identified a site near the creek as a “Collier’s Pit”. Before coal mining became widespread, they used charcoal in iron furnaces. This was one site that they made charcoal. We walked up the trail for about a half a mile before reaching Wilson Creek Shelter  where we took another break. We still had some daylight left so we decided to walk further and camp at Black Horse Gap. The trail followed the ridge with a gradual increase in elevation. We got to the gap where we planned to camp and found it to be next to the Blue Ridge Parkway. We found tentsites and stopped for the night.","Troutville

We woke up early, broke down our tents and packed up our gear. While we were eating, a trail maintenance parked nearby and stopped to talk to us as he was on his way to work on the trail. There was a report of a fallen tree blocking the trail and he was going to remove it. He asked us our trail names and when we told him that he heard about us from another trail volunteer. Apparently, two brothers hiking north together was a novelty. We thanked him for his efforts to maintain the trail. 
The trail had a small climb to a ridge that paralleled the Blue Ridge Parkway. We made excellent progress as the trail had good surface conditions and maintained rolling pattern for long stretches. 
The trail crossed back and forth over the Blue Ridge Parkway several times. Often, near a pull off at a scenic overlook. The views were very nice. At one overlook, there was a sign that said that the AT parallels the BRP for 100 miles. We interpreted this that the trail would continue its rolling pattern and spare us from any exhausting arduous climbs. 
For the most part, that was the case until we had to climb over Fork Mountain. It was a long steep climb that got us winded. The switchbacks, although having a steep grade, ended way to soon. We were exhausted by the time we got to the top. However, the way down did not seem as long nor steep in grade as it was going up.
There was a nice flowing creek when we reached the bottom. We refilled our water bottles as drank all we had climbing up the mountain. We then followed the creek for a while crossing back and forth until the trail turned uphill. We had a gradual climb to Bryant Ridge Shelter. According to the trail guide, it was built in 1992 and is the largest on the AT with a capacity of 20. It was one of the nicer shelters we have stayed in.","Black Horse Gap

We packed up and started an immediate climb from the shelter. Initially, the few steep switchbacks turned into a long winding trail up Floyd Mountain. After four hours, we reached Cornelius Creek Shelter. We took a break and I discovered that I didn’t have my water bottles. 
Earlier in the day, we stopped to get water from a spring that was located about 1/4 mile downhill from the trail. We were down to only a few swallows so we needed pick some up. We had to dip the water as it wasn’t a very big spring. We then climbed back up to where we left our packs to filter it into our bottles. I had finished filtering the water, put the filter and squeeze bags back into my pack. Then, I put my pack on and left my full bottles by a log that I was setting on. 
I discovered this sad act of stupidity after I got to Cornelius Creek Shelter. Fortunately, I still had my Sawyer bags so I could carry water but had no way to fasten them to the outside of my backpack. 
Luckily, a group of ladies out for a day hike came by the shelter on their way to a parking lot nearby. One of the ladies gave me her quart Gatorade bottle to use along with an apple for each of us. We left there and the trail took us across a gap before beginning the long rocky climb up Old Apple Orchard Mountain. There were not many switchbacks and some of those were steep. The trail surface was rocky which worked on our ankles and feet. There were also a few boulders that we had to climb over or around. We got to the top and walked past a large  FAA installation. The guide book said there was a nice view but it was obscured by trees. The path down began with us having to crawl down between some boulders. The trail then continued to wind through the boulders. We had to go under the “Guillotine” which was a large boulder wedged between to larger boulders directly over the trail.We finally got down to a gap where the trail conditions were more favorable.  The trail had us cross the Blue Ridge Parkway again before walking a little over a mile to the shelter.

I had to use my sleeping bag liner as a bug screen to get any relief. Mark broke out his head net. I stated that I would be tenting from now on. 
The plan for the day was to walk to John’s Hollow Shelter. There would a big climb immediately after leaving there. We wanted to start the climb in the morning so that we would have fresh legs. The trail started off in a rolling manner with no big ups or downs. Then we had to climb a rocky knoll along with its rocky trail surface. The path up was long and steep. We reached the top and followed the ridge for quite a while. There were a few overlooks but they were obscured by tree cover.  We reached the end of the ridge and began a long descent into the James River Valley. The trail down had plenty of long winding switchbacks which helped our knees, feet and ankles after getting out of the rocky areas. We got down to the bottom and walked parallel with the James River for a mile or so. We walked past some high rocky bluffs as we walked along the river bank.The trail led us to the James River Foot Bridge. It is the longest foot travel only bridge on the AT. A memorial plaque stated that the bridge was dedicated to the memory of William T. Foot, a past president of the Natural Bridge Appalachian Trail Club. The bridge used some supports from an old railroad bridge but had steel construction and was very solid. Jumping off the bridge was prohibited by the US Forestry Service. Some hikers ignore this and risk a reportedly hefty fine. Budgetary constraints precluded my consideration taking the risk. The trail left the river and entered the woods.

We had a big climb ahead of us so we wanted to get started as soon as we got ready. Mark made us some coffee which helped us get going. We packed up and started climbing a steep and rocky trail. We had to get over two mountain peaks then walk a ridge over two Punchbowl Mountain. We climb was hard and we went through a lot of water. We had taken extra for this climb and water is scarce on the ridges. However, the ridge allowed us to recover somewhat before climbing Punchbowl Mountain. 
Near the top, we passed a memorial to Ottie Cline Powell, age 4 years and 11 months, whose body was found April 5, 1891 after straying a distance of 7 miles from Tower Hill School. 
We got to the top and had a nice view.  We met a trough hiker from Germany. He was inspired by “ A Walk in the Woods”. He also was between jobs and had some personal problems so he was hiking to clear his head. 
We had a descent down to Punchbowl Shelter where we would eat lunch and refill our water bottles. On the way to the shelter, my right foot slipped on a rock. I instinctively stuck my trekking pole into the ground to catch me. However, the pole buckled and bent 90 degrees but did slow my fall to the ground. John was behind me and asked if I was ok. I said yes but I was going to write Walmart a scathing letter of indignation as I paid 18 dollars and it only lasted 800 miles.  John shook his head. 
After getting to the shelter, we ate a late lunch and refilled our water bottles. We decided that we would walk further to shorten our hike to US 60 where we would get a shuttle or hitchhike to Buena Vista. We needed to resupply and intended on a Nero. I needed another trekking pole so as we were hiking I checked several downed limbs. None of them were suitable as they were easily broken. I told Mark that I needed something green to use. He found a large limb that was recently broken off that still had a green branch of the right diameter attached to it. I used my knife to trim off the branches and get into a rough but serviceable shape. My craftsmanship did not meet Mark’s expectations so he asked to borrow my knife and make some adjustments to the finish of the final product. Finally satisfied with the result, he handed back my knife and my new trekking stick.
We had to cross the Blue Ridge Parkway that happened to have a pull off with a trash can. We got there and found a through hiker and his mom doing trail magic. He was off trail for two weeks so he and his mom decided to set here and provide soft drinks, snacks and bananas to hikers. He didn’t say why he was off trail although we suspected injury. However, we thanked him and his mom for their generosity. 
The trail continued to trend down although there were a few bumps here and there. We reached a US Forestry Service road and ran into the same hiker and his mom again. Big Heart and some other hikers that we know were there enjoying the trail magic. We stopped and took some more Gatorade and chips. The Gatorade really hit the spot.

The trail followed a ridge until turning down and crisscrossed a creek several times. We stopped briefly at Brown Mountain Creek Shelter then continued on following the trail as it paralleled the creek. 
We passed a sign that identified a 1.4 mile section of the hollow that we were in as the site of the “Brown Mountain Creek Community”. According to the sign, the community was founded by freed slaves in the early 1900’s. We saw some rock walls and chimney ruins as the trail followed the creek. The area was pretty much over grown with vegetation so we could not see a whole lot of the ruins. It appeared that the trail was purposely on the opposite side of the creek from the ruins. 
The trail started up out of the hollow. We soon reached US60 where we called a local shuttle service which took us a couple of more hikers to Buena Vista. 
She dropped us off at the Budget Inn. It was similar condition to the other ones that we stayed in previously. In other words, it had hot water, a coin operated laundry and a bed. But none of our wives would have stayed there.

Initially, the switchbacks were a little steep but got us to a ridge where the grade was better going forward. The climb was still a long 2000 feet elevation gain which took some of the steam out of our stride. However, our full bellies and relatively fresh legs helped get us through it. 
We got to the top but didn’t have any scenic views due to the tree cover. The trail continued along the ridge and then dipped into a gap where Cow Camp Gap Shelter was located. The shelter was a half mile down the flank of the mountain and the water source was a little past there so we took our break at the junction of the trail going to the shelter and the AT. 
The trail continued across the gap and then started climbing again. We came across a couple of trail maintenance volunteers from the Natural Bridge Section of the ATC, presumably a man and a wife, taking a break near a rock overlook. The man had been using a weedeater to trim the vegetation back from the trail a couple of feet per side. The woman was repainting the white blaze marks. We had seen the results of their efforts earlier in the day. Cutting back the vegetation helps with ticks and walking along the trail. The freshly painted blazes help with staying on the trail especially when it intersects other trails. We thanked them for their everything that they were doing for the trail.
We continued along the ridge passing through a grassy bald before climbing up to another ridge. We walked through some rocky areas but no views of the valley below due to tree cover. It then wound down to a lower ridge that we followed to a meadow. We needed water so we followed a blue blaze trail 1/4 mile to a spring. We originally planned to eat lunch at a campsite nearby but the flies were so numerous that they were about to tote us off. We climbed out of the meadow and it’s swarm of flies and found a suitable spot on some boulders on top of the mountain. We had a few more ups and downs before reaching the shelter. It did not appear to be as buggy as the last two shelters so I took a spot for the night.","Buena Vista

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615335,"After we left the shelter, we continued to follow the mountain ridge. The terrain was rolling for the most part but we did have a few climbs to get us to a higher point on the ridge. The trail took us up an old logging road that was relatively steep and long. We got to the top of a ridge and ran into a blue blaze trail to Spy Rock. The trail guide described the point of interest as a large rock dome with a 360 degree view. Mark and I dropped our packs and walked the 1/10 mile trail to the rock. John did not want to climb so he walked on towards the shelter. 
Spy Rock was huge. We really couldn’t determine how to get on top as there were several trails around it. We picked one that required us to climb up the face of the rock. Mark was able to get up pretty quickly. My rock climbing skills are a little more suspect so it took me a little longer to get up to the top. 
The view was worth the climb with a nearly 360 degree sight line. We lingered long enough for a couple of pictures before heading back down. The wind was picking up so we decided to move on. There was actually an easier but longer trail on the front side of the rock. 
We picked up our packs and continued the long climb up the Priest Mountain. Due to the tree cover, the views that we normally see were obscured. We did manage to to walk to a large rock outcropping that gave us a nice view of a large farm in the valley below. 
Our climb brought us to a gap where the Priest Shelter was located. We stopped for lunch and water resupply. It is traditional to “confess to the Priest” by writing a “confession” in the shelter logbook. Most of the ones that I read were humorous. There were a few that were serious and heartfelt. I wrote: “Forgive me but us Southern Baptist’s have a direct line. However, Moonwalk is one of y’alls persuasion but he won’t touch the book because he is afraid of catching a Norovirus”. John, who is Catholic, poked at me for writing it but would not take the book to write a refutation.We reached the top of our 2000 feet climb and walked along the ridge until we started our descent. We had to go down 3000 feet to the Tye River. It took us quite as the trail down was initially rocky. We finally reached better trail conditions and made better progress. Our feet and ankles certainly welcomed the change to a smoother path. But, the front part of our knees were really being worked by the long path down.We reached the river, crossed it on a suspension foot bridge and took a break on the other side. We then began another long climb until we reached the Harpers Creek Shelter.","Seely-Woodworth Shelter

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615429,"it was a tough day. Long climbs, rocky and steep trail sections, and boulder fields to navigate and sometimes crawl across. 
We got packed up and ready to start our hike today. A hiker that we know, Doc, came by the shelter looking for Chappy. They got separated on the trail and got to the camp site after dark. He didn’t know if Chappy slipped past him and went to the shelter. We hadn’t seen him so Doc went back to his tent to wait for him. We asked him to say hello for us and that we would see them down the trail.
We left the shelter and began on an immediate climb on long winding switchbacks. The trail then led us across intermittent boulder fields. Some of these required us to climb over and around. A rocky trail surface became the norm as we got higher on Three Ridges Mountain. We got to the top of the first ridge and took a water break. We then followed a rocky path up to the second ridge which required some climbing over large rocks and between large boulders.
We had to climb higher over the rocky terrain to get to the third ridge. This ridge initially had a rocky trail surface but soon smoothed out some as we walked. We stopped at a lrage rock outcropping and took a break as we admired the view of the valley below. 
Leaving there, the trail turned down and switchbacked down towards a gap where Maupin Field Shelter was located. We stopped there for lunch and water resupply. While there, we met a local couple out for a day hike. They had came across a large dog that apparently was lost and followed them to the shelter. The very friendly dog had a collar with a tag but none of us had cell service. We talked with them a while and discussed the Shenandoah National Park and the Pinholti Trail in Alabama. They asked if there were any long trails in Alabama. They took a picture of us and left with the dog following them down a blue blaze trail that bypassed Three Ridges Mountain. 
We left there and followed the trail over to Humpback Mountain. It wasn’t long before we had another steep rocky climb. We climbed a bunch of stone “steps” to get some short and steep switchbacks with stones used for steps at the turns. We finally got to the top near a rock cliff overlook. We saw a storm in the distance so we hurriedly found our tent site about 50 yards away from the cliff and set up our tents. The wind was picking up so we tied the rain flies down as best as we could.","Harpers Creek Shelter

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615561,"We didn’t get the stormy weather that we anticipated. The storms moved around our mountain top perch during the night and left us with a clear but breezy morning. I got packed up and ate breakfast and went out to the cliff to see the view of the valley below. The storm threat forced me to get my tent set up so I didn’t have time to check out the rock bluff. I sat on a large rock shelf relaxing until Mark and John were ready to start walking.
The trail followed along the cliff for a short distance before turning away and heading down a switchback. We continued down the mountain on long gradual switchbacks on a fairly smooth trail surface. We walked past an old family cemetery with nearly all of the grave markers being simple, relatively flat stones. We couldn’t make out any of the inscriptions but a sign on a tree next to the trail identified it a the “Lowe Cemetery”.  Further down the mountain flank, we walked past the ruins of an old one room cabin. The rock underpinning and the chimney were all that was left.
As we got near the bottom, we finally saw our first bear. It was a young one and was running up the mountain side away from us. I couldn’t get my camera out in time to get a photo. We continued on down the trail and crossed a creek to take a lunch break at a shelter. A hiker that we know, Daytripper was already there eating lunch. We talked with him while he was finishing lunch. He was heading to a hostel in Waynesboro, Stananimal’s, for a Nero and resupply. 
After, filling our water bottles, we continued on the trail intending to get to Waynesboro to meet Gale and Bett. They were driving up to help us slackpack the Shenandoah National Park. Also, it had been quite a while since we have seen them so Mark and I were wanting get to Waynesboro as quick as we could. 
We had another climb or two before reaching Waynesboro. The trail continued on a road walk towards the SNP entrance. We originally were going to meet our wives at the visitor’s center near there but they were still a couple of hours away. So, we stopped at King’s Gourmet Popcorn and decided to get something to eat.  Daytripper was finishing his hotdog and waiting for his shuttle to the hostel which came as we were waiting on our food.  John soon arrived and got a hotdog and fries.
While we were there, a guy in a van stopped and asked us if we needed a ride into Waynesboro. We gladly accepted the ride and crawled in his van. He and a volunteer were coming back from doing trail maintenance and saw us sitting there. He is a “triple crowner” which means he has done the AT, the Pacific Crest Trail and the Continental Divide Trail. He lives in Waynesboro with his girl friend who he met on the AT. She has done both the AT and the PCT and some parts of the CDT. He took us to our hotel and invited us to dinner at a hostel that the Grace Lutheran Church runs for hikers. We told him that our wives were meeting us but appreciated the offer. After, he dropped us off, I noticed that his gas tank was approaching “E”. I offered him a twenty  but he refused and told us to pay it forward by helping another hiker or volunteer for trail maintenance some day. We told him that we certainly would and really appreciated his help.I checked in to the room that Gale booked and took a long hot shower. I then waited on her to arrive.","Tent site @ Mile 851.4

We were toting day packs that weighed less than 15 pounds so we anticipated having an easier time hiking. 
We walked across the bridge where the Blue Ridge Parkway turns into Skyland Drive. We followed the road to the trailhead which initiated a climb. We walked a short distance up the trail where we came across a self registration kiosk for overnight camping. John filled out a form since he planned to camp each night. 
The trail seemed to be rolling most of the day. We climbed a few times but none of them seemed very long. Surprisingly, we didn’t have any overlooks. We did pass a telecom tower complex where some one placed a several tractor seats around a round metal table a short distance away. 
When we got about 2 miles from the pickup point, it started raining. Mark and I got soaked.  Naturally, it stopped when we got to Blackrock  Gap. John and his son arrived about 30 minutes later and were a little damp but nowhere as wet as us. Fortunately, Gale and Bett brought some towels with them so we were able to dry off.

The path started up and we climbed to the summit of the mountain. They call this area “Blackrock” which, for me doesn’t adequately describe the massive pile of cracked and crumbling boulders that were there. It appeared that all of the dirt had eroded away and the exposed rock were being broken down by the weather. 
We carefully climbed to the top of the pile as falling here would be serious. We  had 360 views of the surrounding countryside.  We looked around for a little while before climbing down.  
We left this area and walked a ridge for a long way. We stopped and ate lunch at Loft Mountain Store as we felt that the Wayside was too far off the trail to go to. The store was pretty nice with a lot of hiker and picnic foods. We bought a couple Gatorades, paydays and ice cream sandwiches for our calcium fix. The trail resumed a rolling pattern with no large ups and downs.

We then had a descent of 1000 feet to a gap which we crossed to get us on the climb up Saddleback Mountain.  Fortunately, the trail stayed around the 3000 +/- foot elevation which helped us on the 3600 feet Baldface Mountain. We encountered long stretches of rocky trails going up and down. 
We pressed on past Bearfence Mountain which featured a large exposed ridge of rock and rocky trail surfaces. Next, was Hazeltop which on the descent put us on a ridge that got us to the very nice Big Meadows Store. The Wayside was closed for renovations so we each bought a Gatorade and waited until Bett and Gale got there. 
We decided to go to the lodge to eat. The lodge was also undergoing renovation but the restaurant was open. Supposedly, President Herbert Hoover stayed there. The wait was very long for the pricy and crowded restaurant. We saw “Whitey” a hiker from Ireland that we know. We spoke to him for a little while.

The trail stayed on a ridge that got us to Skyland Resort. We saw a few nice overlooks with good views as we hiked. The Skyland Resort Complex appeared to be of a more recent vintage than Big Meadows. The buildings exhibited a modern look where Big Meadows featured stone and wood. We stopped for lunch. The food was good. However,  The blackberry lemonade was actually pink lemonade as there were no blackberries in it that I could tell. It seems they could have used some at least as a garnish. We left there and the path took us down to another ridge but kept us above 3000 feet.

The ones that were probably available in the winter were now obscured by tree cover and vegetation. 
We did stop by Elkwallow Wayside and I finally got my Blackberry milkshake. It was ok. My expectations were diminished after trying the Blackberry Lemonade at Big Meadows Lodge and the Blackberry ice cream at Skyland Lodge.
Outside we saw some hikers that we knew, “Doc”, our friend “ Chappy”, Bilbo, and Perdido who was from Perdido Bay but originally from Birmingham. 


We left there and continued on. We had a few climbs but the light packs made it easier to get up and over.  The trail then began a long descent down. About 2/3 down the mountain, we passed a sign informing us that we were leaving the SNP. We were expecting to see a lot of bears in this park; but, evidently they don’t like Mark’s beer joint songs or we simply make too much noise while hiking.

Gale and Bett had brought our new Osprey Aether packs that we bought online from REI. We put the new packs on and really felt the difference between them and the slack packs that we were toting for the last week.

We headed up the trail looking for John. He got an early start so we didn’t see him until we took lunch at Manassas Gap Shelter. The trail paralleled the road for a short distance before turning to climb out of the gap. There were plenty of switchbacks which helped with the long climb. 
We several more ups and downs before we crossed VA 55 and followed a road under I 66. We then used a footbridge to cross a creek before making a climb to Manassas Gap Shelter. There we found John who was eating lunch.

The trail joined the C&O Canal Towpath and followed it for a couple of miles. The canal was overgrown with vegetation but we did see several areas that contained water. The towpath was used to move barges down the canal before trains rendered it obsolete. It was repurposed several years ago as a walking / bike trail. John actually participated in a bike ride on the C&O Towpath trail to Washington DC.

There was also a Civil War battle fought on the property. He had built a mausoleum on the property that was never used. He also built a huge memorial to the Civil War correspondents for both sides of the war.

We came across a four foot long timber rattler. It coiled up and shook its rattle as we got near. We watched it for a short time and gave it a wide berth as we passed by. 



The good trail surface continued until we got to the shelter. The shelter was another well kept facility. It had individual bunks that would accommodate eight hikers.","Rocky Mountain Shelter

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616809,"We woke up to sprinkling rain. By the time we got ready to hit the trail, it had checked up but remained cloudy.  The trail stayed on a rolling trend with no large ups and downs.  We walked about two miles and past a couple of “ halfway” markers . One was a simple circle of rocks with “1/2”   spelled out. Another was about 100 yards away and consisted of a pole with a sign on it signifying the halfway point.  About a half mile or so later we passed another marker for when the trail was 2181 miles long. 


We continued along the trail until we got to the Pine Grove State Park. We walked to the General Store which was noted for the half gallon ice cream challenge. We didn’t do the challenge, but Mark ate an ice cream cone before he got his hamburger and fries and a pint of ice cream afterwards. I got the “hiker” burger which was something that Homer Simpson would love. It was a cheeseburger with the usual toppings like lettuce, onions, pickles and tomato plus a fried egg, two strips of bacon and avocado on a ciabatta bun. I also ordered a large fries which was comparable to the large fries of Five Guys.  I washed all down with two regular Pepsi colas. I was too full for ice cream after finishing. 



The park was also home to the AT Museum that was housed in an old grist mill. It contained old trail artifacts and biographies of some of the early through hikers and proponents of establishing the trail.
We then walked past an old furnace that was similar to the one a Tannehill State Park in Alabama. It was not restored as completely as the one at Tannehill but was an impressive structure. 


The trail wound its way through the park along a gravel road before climbing back into the woods. We ended up on a ridge that we followed several miles before getting to the blue blaze trail to the shelter.The guide book said that the shelter was 0.2 mile off the AT but it seemed much longer. 


Just as we got to the shelter, the rain began again and lasted for about thirty minutes. We didn’t get wet from the rain but we were still soaked from sweat.  We changed into our dry clothes after dinner so that we didn’t get our sleeping bags wet.","Birch Run Shelter

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616812,"We woke to rain.  By the time we packed our gear, the rain slacked up to a steady sprinkle. Our clothes were still damp from yesterday’s sweat fest. We changed out of our dry clothes back into the damp ones as rain was forecast for most of the day.  We put on our rain hats to help keep water off our glasses but chose not wear our rain suits.  Our clothes were damp and the humid air along with hiking would make us wet from sweat any way. 


Today’s objective would be the Backpacker Campground in Boiling Springs, PA. We wanted to walk through and tent somewhere past there but there were no camp sites shown in the guide until Darlington Shelter which was 28 miles from our present location. We really didn’t want to stay at the Backpacker Campground as it is located near an active train track and it is located 0.4 mile from town. We were considering taking a chance on finding a campsite after Boiling Springs but found out that the AT corridor was very narrow and that it wound through a bunch of farms and residences. So, we were stuck with the campground. 


We walked back up the blue blaze trail back to the AT. It still seemed longer than 0.2 mile.  We took a right at the junction and headed up the trail. 


We started a steep climb up which got our blood pumping and sweat rolling. The trail took us through a rock maze at the top. We had to climb over and around large boulders. We then dropped down slightly and climbed over and around another rock maze. The trail then took us through two more areas of large boulders before dropping us down close to Alec Kennedy Shelter. We stopped and ate lunch.


We left there and had a short climb and descent before we had a steep climb up Center Point Knob. This was the original midpoint of the AT. We walked past the marker at the top then initiated a gradual descent. We reached a large cornfield which the trail had us walk past. We crossed a road and walked through another large field of corn and what appear to be a grain of some type until we reached the campground. It was raining so we hurriedly set up our tents and stashed our packs inside. We then walked into town to get something to eat. The town features a large spring fed man made lake. These springs flow so vigorously that they appear to boil which gave the town its name. The lake was built for a iron furnace nearby.


The landscaping around the lake was very nice and well kept. The AT follows a walking path along the lake before turning right near the ATC Mid-Atlantic Office. 


While John was picking up his mail drop, snark and I went to a local outfitter where each of us bought a pair of liner socks. Our toe socks had holes worn in them so we needed another pair. They didn’t have the toe socks so we settled on a standard pair of liners. 


We ate dinner at Anile’s Pizzeria and Ristorante. I had a large Stromboli of which I saved a portion for tomorrow’s breakfast.

The loud blaring train horn roused me from sleep around 4 o’clock. The noise and vibration made me feel like I was on the tracks. I tried to go back asleep but two more trains went by shortly after the first one.
It had rained during the night so we had to shake water off our tent flys before putting them up wet. We packed up our stuff and walked to the ATC Mid-Atlantic office to refill our water bottles. We decided to leave our packs there and walk to the convenience store. 


We went back and picked up our packs and started walking to the trailhead. The trail meandered for ten miles through the valley passing several farms and through many large fields of corn and soybeans. We also crisscrossed several creeks and crossed a river. 


We then reached a mountain that featured a steep climb out of the valley. We got to the top and went to the shelter for the night. The forecast called for more rain and thunderstorms.","

We got up and ready early so that we could get to Duncannon for a Nero. Our clothes and bodies were dirty and smelly from the mud and our sweat. Our time on the trail has made us appreciate the rejuvenating properties of a hot shower. We were also looking forward to a hot meal that we didn’t cook for ourselves. 
We hiked down from the mountain that we were on and then followed the trail through the woods before crossing a paved road. The path led us through a literal sea of waist high grass for a mile or two. We then crossed a fence into a cow pasture. The cows started walking towards us as we hiked through pasture before losing interest in us and focusing their bovine attention on a couple of hikers behind us that had a dog with them. We continued on crossing the fence  out of the pasture. 
We entered the woods and began a steep rocky climb up another mountain. We got to the top and followed a ridge over intermittent rock fields for a few miles.  We reached a cliff that had a nice view of Duncannon, PA. We lingered there for short time talking with a local day hiker. We started a steep descent that included numerous steep rock steps to get us to a switchback. Then several more steep rock steps to get to other switchbacks. We made it down to a street and walked into town. We stopped by a convenience store and bought some Gatorade to compensate for all the sweating from hiking. Afterwards, we walked to the Doyle Hotel, an iconic hiker hotel, and ate lunch. We ordered hamburgers and fries. Mark had a coke and John and I each ordered a beer. After lunch, we needed to resupply so we walked almost a mile to Mutzabaugh’s Grocery. We bought our resupply and the owner had one of his employees drive us back to town. We didn’t like the looks of the Doyle although the food was very good and reasonably priced.

The trail led us over a rocky ridge which required us to scramble over, down and around large boulders. The rocks were wet from last nights rain which made footing precarious. There were also plenty of ankle twisting and toe stumping rocks which worked on our feet and ankles. John fell twice suffering some bruises. I fell once getting a large scrape on my left leg. 


It started raining again. First light rain then heavy big drop rain that soaked us to the skin. This lasted until we got about three miles from the shelter.

We were eating breakfast when the rain started again. It lasted for about an hour and we left as soon as it was over. 


Our goal for the day was to hike 18 miles to Rausch Gap Shelter. The trail was muddy and the vegetation was still wet. But, we were on a relatively flat ridge so we felt that we could make good time.


After about an hour of hiking, the sun came out which was a welcome sight. The trail conditions deteriorated as the rain run off flooded the already muddy trail in several spots.


We followed the ridge for 6 miles before the trail turned down into a gap. We then crossed a road and a large rain swollen creek before making a long climb up to another ridge. We followed that ridge for several miles before heading down to Rausch Gap. The muddy flooded trail became more prevalent the closer that we got to the shelter.

We continued the descent started yesterday. The trail was still muddy in places but most of the standing water was gone. We reached an old rail bed that was converted to a gravel road. The trail turned up the road for a mile or two. We met a Game Warden coming up the road in his truck. He stopped and got out to talk to us for a short while. He asked if we had any trouble with animals or people or had anything to report. We told that we haven’t any trouble since we have been on the trail.  He left us and drove his truck up the road presumably to check out the shelter and adjoining campsites. 


We walked up the road and took a bypass around a flooded area of the trail. This added about a 1/2 mile to our walk. We had a fairly steep climb to a ridge where the bypass rejoined the AT.  We followed the ridge for a mile or so before descending to a road crossing. There, two 2017 through hikers, Trail Name and checklist, set up trail magic. We had second breakfast of scrambled eggs and hash browns along with banana nut bread, watermelon and soft drinks. We thanked them for their kindness. 


We left there and had to climb up to another ridge. The path was giving us a taste of the “Rocksilvania” that we heard was coming. The sharp angular rocks jutted up out of the ground in all kinds of directions which made footing uncomfortable and unsure. 


We followed the rocky ridge for a couple of miles before getting some relief for a couple miles. We then crossed a few boulder fields and then had another couple miles of good trail.  We had one more round of a boulder field before reaching PA 501.  The shelter was about a 0.1 mile from the road. It was a large four walled building with a large hexagon skylight in the center of the roof. There was a caretaker that lived in a cabin next door. He was a nice fellow that showed us around.

We left the shelter and started down the blue blaze trail to the AT.  Right off the bat, we ran into a long stretch of ankle twisting, toe stumping, foot bruising rocks.  We stumbled through this area and reached a smoother path although there were several muddy places still present. 



The trail was relatively flat with only a few short climbs. After a few miles, we passed the 1200 mile mark. It was spelled out with sticks on the trail. We walked further and the mud became more frequent where the rocks were absent. Dry path surfaces without the sharp angular rocks were few and far between.We ran across a marker that identified the site for Fort Drietrich Synder, a lookout post during the French and Indian War.  We looked but did not see any ruins.

The trail was a lot dryer today but there were still boulder fields and the small irritating angular pointy rocks to walk over. We had a one short but steep climb to get us to ridge which gave us another opportunity to walk over the foot bruising rocks. 


We finally started the descent to Port Clinton. It was a very steep trail without switchbacks that really fatigued our knees. We managed to get down without taking a tumble and reached a railroad yard. We crossed the tracks to a road and took a break at a picnic table near some large boulders of coal. 


We walked up the road and crossed over a bridge  following the white blazes that were marked on telephone poles. We were looking for the barbershop which was a hiker friendly place that had info on shuttles.

A few minutes later, he dropped us off at the trailhead. We began a steep ramp up the mountain side. We finally reached a switchback that would let us recover somewhat before resuming another steep ramp up. 


We got to the top and encountered a boulder field that we would have to navigate over. The rocks were slick from the rain which made walking on them more time consuming. 


We dropped down to another ridge and suffered through the sharp pointy rocks that hurt our ankles and feet for a mile or so. We then climbed up to different ridge and had another boulder walk. 


The trail took us down to a gap where Windsor Furnace was once located. We stopped at the shelter near there and ate lunch. We met a group that spent the night there and talked with them while we were eating and they were packing up. One of the guys, Ambush, did an AT through hike in 2015. They were nice fellows. 


We left there and made a long steep climb up to Pulpit Rock, a rock bluff with a nice view. To get there, we had to cross another boulder field. There was also a astronomical park on the other side of the ridge. There were several small observatories located there. A sign stated that the well kept area was the property of the Lehigh Valley Amateur Astronomical Society.


We continued to follow the ridge and suffer through the rocks for another mile or so before getting some relief with better trail conditions. We then followed the trail to where it became a dirt road which we walked for a couple of miles. We  came across a large rattlesnake. John almost stepped on it. We found it that was trying to swallow a squirrel. At first, we thought it was dead until we poked it with a trekking pole. It then started shaking its rattle. We left it to finish its meal.

The path surface was rocky going up and continued being rocky along the ridge with a few intermittent stretches of flat trail. It seemed that the trail planners did not waste any opportunity to take us over one of these hazardous boulder fields. The path through was not clear. The only clue that you were going the right way was the white blazes. One fall in any of these areas could result in a serious injury.  I suppose that they consider this stretch a rite of passage for the AT.

We left the shelter and proceeded on the boulder field tour again. Fresh legs and rested feet helped it from being a total grind to get through them. The last couple of days  of the trail, built by sadists and approved by masochists, must have been their idea of compensating for the few less than inspiring views that were not obscured by trees. 


We started down the mountain and took a lunch break at Outerbridge Shelter, allegedly built in 1965. It appeared to be the same age as Bake Oven Shelter which was built in 1937.  We refilled our water bottles, drank our fill and took an extra liter bag with us as it was the last good water for 20 miles. 
The trail continued down the mountain side to the Lehigh River. We crossed the river and then had a mile long climb out of the valley. The trail carried us up about 1,000 feet and over what was essentially a steep rock pile on the side of the mountain. We literally had to use both hands and feet to scramble up some of the steeper areas. Falling could have been catastrophic.

We crossed the road and found that trail angel left two 5 gallon jugs of drinking water for hikers. We each drank a liter and then refilled our water bottles. This was an especially timely trail magic as we would have had to walk several miles nursing what little water we had. 


We were then able to cross several more miles of boulders and pointy rocks to make it to Leroy Smith Shelter before we ran out of water. We ate lunch there, rehydrated and refilled our water bottles.

We left there and ran into a day hiker. We stopped and spoke with him for a short while. He said that he was walking down the trail doing trail magic. He offered us snacks, water or soft drinks that he was carrying in his pack. Mark and I took a bottle of water. John got a coke. We declined the snacks.  We thanked him for his kindness and moved on. 


We came to Wolf Rocks, a rocky outcropping similar to the Knife Edge that we crossed the day before but not as high or as physically challenging. We did come across a timber rattler laying on a rock that crawled off the side of the cliff as we approached. 


We stopped at Kirkridge Shelter for lunch and pick up water.  The shelter was close to a private lodge that had a drinking water spigot available for hikers.

We walked for about four miles when we came across Sunfish Pond.  The information sign said that it was a 41 acre glacial pond and one of the seven natural wonders of New Jersey. The sign said that the water was so acidic that only a few hardy species of fish such as pumpkin seed sunfish and yellow perch could survive in the pond. There was also a bronze plaque that said the pond was a “registered natural landmark” by the US Department of the Interior. The trail followed the shoreline around the pond before turning away to a short climb.  We followed the trail to the summit of the mountain. It was a grassy bald with a very nice 360 degree view of the area. We met a man birdwatching and talked with him as we admired the view. He was out trying to observe hawks that frequent that area. He also said that there were about 16 active bald eagle nests along the ridge. There was also a large mound of rocks nearby. We asked about it and he told us that his club built it as a windscreen to use while they were birdwatching and doing photography. Apparently, hikers were adding more rocks to get it to its present state. He wondered where they got all of the rocks. 


We left him to continue his hobby and walked until we reached the Mohican Outdoor Center, a lodge and campground owned by the Appalachian Mountain Club.  We ate lunch there and refilled our water bottles.

He then takes the first car and takes it to another trail head further down the trail and repeats. Anchor has been tagging along on occasion.

We ate lunch at Horler’s General Store. They had a deli that would make fresh subs. We ate our lunch on their large front porch which also had plenty of outlets to charge our phones.  I ate my whole sandwich along with chips and a pint of strawberry ice cream. Both Mark and John saved half of their sandwiches for dinner after getting to the shelter. After eating, we went back inside to pick up a few things to get us back to having five days food. 


We headed out of town and back to the trail head. We had an immediate climb up over a knoll then descended down to an old railroad bed that we followed for about a mile.

We had to walk around the perimeter of what was basically a swamp.  The trail turned off into the woods where we had another long boardwalk path through a swampy area to a road crossing. 


We crossed the road and had a steep climb to a trail to an abandoned house that the National Park Service owns. They have a water spigot available there for use by AT hikers. We stopped and each picked up two liters extra water for tonight and tomorrow mornings meals. We also took the opportunity to rinse out our shirts and bandannas. 


We resumed the steep 1/2 mile climb up Pochuck Mountain to the shelter. There were a few switchbacks before we got to the shelter but they were also steep so we didn’t get much help from them. I decided to set up my tent. Mark and John took spots in the shelter.","High Point Shelter

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618273,"It’s Independence Day and my brother Randy’s birthday. We woke up and got ready for the day. Our plan was to hike to Wawayanda Shelter which would be another short day. The New Jersey requirement that we stay in shelters or designated campsites dictates our mileage for the day. We prefer to hike at least 15 miles each day. 


We left the shelter and completed the climb over Pochuck Mountain. Actually, it was more like a double summit similar to a two hump camel.  We got over the first peak then dropped down a hundred feet or so before climbing over the second peak. 


From there, we dropped down to a road crossing. The trail continued over a nice boardwalk over a swamp. It extended over a half mile in one section and about a quarter mile in the other before crossing a suspension footbridge.  There were a lot of people out on the boardwalk today. One lady that was bird watching told us that it would be crowded in a couple of hours as it was a popular place. 


We had a short climb up a rocky knoll and followed the path gradually down the other side where we crossed another swampy area on a two board walkway for a half mile or so. 


We got to NJ 94 where we stopped for lunch. There was a hotdog stand there run by a guy named Mitch. He said that he was originally from Queens and was an interesting character to talk with. We each ordered two hotdogs, chips and Gatorade.  Mark usually turns his nose up at hot dogs but decided to get two chili dogs for the calories they offer.  


We finished those and walked across the road to Heaven Hill Farm, which sold ice cream along with produce and plants. We each bought some ice cream. I got strawberry, Mark got a combination of chocolate and vanilla and John picked blueberry cream. After finishing the dessert, Mark bought an orange, John bought a Granny Smith apple and I bought a Macintosh apple and a orange for the trail.


We put on our packs and walked to the trailhead. After a short climb, we had a pretty smooth trail over to Wawayanda Mountain. There were a lot of folks on this trail hiking up and back down “The Stairway to Heaven”.  This was a long 1000 feet climb up the side of the mountain on rocks arranged to function as steps.  Near the mountain top, there was a large rock outcropping that had a nice view of the valley. 


We got to the overlook and took a break checking out the view.  We then finished our climb over the mountain. The trail went down the other side in a substantially more gradual fashion. We walked the last two miles to the shelter.  After dropping our packs, we walked another half mile to the Wawayanda Park office to get water. The water sources we passed were unappealing as they either came off a beaver pond or were stagnant looking.","Pochuck Mountain Shelter

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618275,"We hit the trail around 7 o’clock. We wanted to get an early start to take advantage of the cooler temperature.  Our plan was to hike around 15 miles. The trail left the shelter and went down into a gap past a pond. We had several crossings over swampy areas on mostly two board walkovers. We then left the swamps and the trail started a rolling pattern with no steep ups or downs. After we had went three miles or so, we climbed up a steep rock face using our hands and feet to where the trail builders made a ladder up a rock face using rebar. Holes had been drilled into the rock and the rebar was bent and the ends inserted into the rock. 


We got on top and started walking an exposed rock ridge for about a mile. We passed a painted NY/NJ marking on the rock surface along with a USGS survey marker close by.  We were leaving New Jersey for the last time. We had been crisscrossing the border for a couple of days.

The trail continued along the exposed rock ridge for another three miles or so. We had an excellent view of a large lake in the valley below us at several points along the ridge. Intermittent gaps in the rock required some climbing down and then back up to the ridge. At one point, we passed a US Flag that someone had hanging from a wooden pole. 



The path finally left the rocky ridge and gradually started down to a gap. It then ran basically flat for a mile or so before taking us back up to another exposed rock ridge. We had another rock climb but did have a nice view from the top. This ridge only extended about an 1/8th mile before we had to climb down. 
The trail crossed a gap and took us up to another rock ridge. This one was a little shorter in length than the last one but seemed to require more  hand climbing. There was not much of a view from the top. 


We left the ridge and followed the trail on a gradual descent to a gap. We followed it across the gap and then took a short climb to a road crossing. Some thoughtful trail angel left a five gallon can of drinking water for hikers. We topped off our bottles and proceeded to the trailhead where some trail angels were offering pizza and Gatorade to hikers. We each took a pice and some Gatorade. We thanked them for their kindness. 


We finished the pizza and drink and walked about a 0.1 mile to Bellvale Farms Creamery where Mark could get his calcium fix for the day.  A information sign inside the building stated that the family owned business had been in operation since 1819. They had a brisk business as the place was packed.  They were “hiker friendly” as they had a water spigot and a charging station for phones on the side of the building. Mark had his usual bowl of chocolate and vanilla ice cream plus bought a large soft serve cone after he finished his bowl. John got a banana split. I had a bowl of strawberry and a root beer. 


A nice lady took John and Mark to a deli where they could buy us sandwiches for our dinner on the trail. I stayed with the packs as I was charging my phone and battery.  A short time later, they got back and we packed up to leave. 


We walked back to the trail head and hiked five miles to Mombasha Mountain. We passed Fitzgerald falls on the way and stopped there to pick up water. We then climbed up the mountain and found a tent site for the night.","Wawayanda Shelter 
",Tentsite at Mile 1379,"Jul 05, Fri",15.30
Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618307,"Today was a lot more rock climbing.  The trail took us over several rocky knolls. Some which we had to throw our trekking poles up and climb up by hand. We also had to literally climb down on the other side on others.  We also went through the “Lemon Squeeze”.  This was a climb with narrow passage. Mark and I had to remove our packs. He went through it and I handed the packs up to him. John managed to make it through without removing his pack. 


It was a very humid day and we consumed a lot of water. Fortunately, some trail angels left water caches at some of the road crossings.  Many thanks to Susan and Hikeman for one cache and to Lobster for another.  We did have to get one liter a piece at a stream with tannins in it. We filtered it with our Sawyer then dropped Aqua Tabs in the bottle. The water was still a little brown and tasted like swimming pool water. 


We finally got out of the rock climbs. However, the trail still took us over several knolls. We made the last climb up about 600 feet to Brien Shelter. It is an old stone shelter built by the CCC. Mark and John took spots in the shelter. I am tenting.","Tentsite at Mile 1379
",Brien Shelter ,"Jul 06, Sat",16.40
Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618319,"Morning came without rain. It clouded up late yesterday but must have blown over. I was pretty tired yesterday when we got to the shelter so I set up my tent, ate dinner, and talked to Gale a little bit before during a serious study of the back of my eyelids. 
I ate pop tarts and protein bars for breakfast. Then, I packed up my gear and walked over to the shelter. Mark had the boiling water ready so we drank the last of the coffee. 
Afterwards, we put on our packs intent on hiking 10 miles or so to Bear Mountain where we planned to resupply and wash our hazardous waste smelling clothes and equally smelly selves. 
The trail had us do another rock climb up next to the shelter. It then took us over a few knolls. We then reached a pretty long climb up a mountain that actually had several nice views. We took a break near one to rest and rehydrate. 
We had a steep long climb down from there. We navigated through some rocky areas that required setting our trekking poles down and using our hands to get down. 
We then reached a busy divided highway that we had to dart across due to the traffic. There was a sign that indicated New York City was 34 miles away. 
After crossing the highway, the trail took us to Bear Mountain. We had a long climb up a rocky trail. Then,  we crossed a road coming down from the top of the mountain which, bicycles, cars and crotch rockets liked to see how fast they could go. 
The trail followed an old CCC road for about a mile. There were stone supports along the side a various intervals that appeared to keep some of the boulders from falling on the road.  The path then left the road and had us climb a long section of stone stairs. We finally got to the top and followed the trail as it wound around the mountain. We passed several overlooks with nice views. One had a wooden bench made from limbs bolted to the rock. We lingered there a while taking in the view and rehydrating.
As we got closer to the park that was on the top, we began encountering day hikers and trail runners. The trail surface was wide, flat and topped with fine crushed stone.
We reached the main portion of the park which featured a stone observation tower. There were a couple of hundred people or more picnicking, sitting on a rock overlook, going up in the tower or walking along the side trails. There were also more than a dozen crotch rockets and their riders taking turns going down the steep road from the mountain. We climbed to the top of the tower and checked out the view. It was hazy in the distance so we couldn’t see the New York City outline. However, the view of the Hudson River and surrounding area was fantastic. 
We left there and began walking down stone steps. It seemed to take us longer to get down than climb up the other side. The climb up to the park must be popular as we passed a lot of people walking up the stairs. 
We reached the bottom and the trail took us past Hessian Lake. The place was crowded with people picnicking and kids playing. Swimming was not allowed in the lake but we saw a bunch of paddle boats navigating the lake. 
The trail then took us through The Trailside Zoo which exhibited native animals, plants and fish.  It was a donation based zoo so we contributed the suggested one dollar a piece.  The lowest point of elevation on the AT was located at the bear habitat.  The two bears there appeared to be old and fat. One was laying in a hammock half asleep. The other one was messing with some black vultures that were hanging around the area. 
We exited the zoo near the bridge over the Hudson. We stopped there and Mark called us an Uber to take us to our motel.","Brien Shelter 
",Bear Mountain/ Ft. Montgomery ,"Jul 08, Mon",10
Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618995,"We woke up to another clear morning. Hungry mosquitoes were waiting outside our tents for us to serve breakfast.  I killed several of the thirsty pests before I managed to apply my bug repellent.  After that I could see them flying around but not landing on my exposed skin.


We managed to eat our own breakfast relatively undisturbed. Mark’s coffee is a nice luxury to have. It seems to pair well with the chocolate protein bars that I usually have for breakfast. Also, the caffeine kick helps get us moving especially after a hard hike on the day before. 


The trail continued its rolling pattern with only a few short steep climbs. It took us past Nuclear Lake. The name comes from a plutonium research facility that was located on the shore of lake. It was shutdown in 1972 after a chemical explosion. Testing deemed the area safe but it was recommended that you don’t drink the water, swim or camp there. It seemed prudent to us to comply with their recommendations. 


We hiked a few more miles and reached the side trail the Telephone Pioneers Shelter. We walked up the path to the shelter where we ate lunch. It was on a bluff but you couldn’t see anything but trees. There was a small cabinet attached to the side that was stocked with paperback books which is nice if you were planning to stay there long enough to read one. 


We picked up water from a small stream nearby on our way back to the trail. We were all out of water and it was the only source for a while. We had to dip it but it was free of tannins and debris. We filtered it and was satisfied with the taste and color. 


We walked down the mountain to a road crossing.  We then walked across a swampy area on some fairly rotten and loose boards for a few hundred feet. We got another road crossing and a man and his wife were doing trail magic for hikers.  The also happened to be parked under the Dover Oak which is the largest oak tree on the AT. It has a circumference of over 20 feet and is estimated to be at least 300 years old. We had Gatorade and snacks. We sat and talked with them a little while before moving on. We thanked them for their kindness as we left. 


We climbed up a small hill and walked through a large pasture. The trail then re-entered the woods and then down to a 1/4 mile boardwalk over a swamp. I later found out that it was called “The Great Swamp” and it is the third largest wetland in New York.  The boardwalk was built in 2012 but it was already extremely weathered and had several rotted boards. 


We left the swamp and walked on some more rickety two board walkways over swampy areas. This got us to dry land and  to a metro railway. There is a small station there where you can catch the metro to Grand Central Station in New York City. While we were there, there was a sign that Tony’s Deli had camping spots and an electrical outlet available for hikers. We decided to walk the 1/2 mile down the highway and camp there. We also planned to eat dinner there and breakfast in the morning.","Tentsite at Mile 1436.4

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618997,"The tent site at Tony’s Deli was near the Metro Rail line. The trains ran nearly all night around every hour. Though not as loud as the freight trains at Boiling Springs, they were more frequent and loud enough to wake me up.
We had eaten dinner at Tony’s last night and decided to eat breakfast there this morning. I got the large Hungry Hiker sandwich which consisted of four eggs, lots of bacon, hash browns and three pepper cheese on a “wedge” ( sub bun). It was huge but I was hungry and wanted to pick up a few calories. I washed it down with a small bottle of chocolate milk, a kickstarter and a large cup of black coffee. Mark and John got the two egg version on a “roll” ( a large hamburger bun). 


Tony offered us a ride back to the trail head so we loaded our gear into his Suburban and got in. He dropped us off at the trail head a few minutes later. We thanked him and started walking up the trail. It led us up hill through a large pasture. There was an old wooden water tower on top of the hill. We took a Kodak moment and continued walking through the pasture.  The trail turned into another pasture where they had started bailing hay. There were a couple of tractors parked near a few large rolls of hay.  


We entered the woods and walked a few miles to Wiley Shelter where we took a break. It had a hand pump well which we used to get water for filtering. We then walked down hill and crossed a road and then used a foot bridge over a stream. We passed a sign that indicated the border between New York and Connecticut.  The trail then took us up and over Ten Mile Hill, a 600 feet each way climb and descent. This got us to Ten Mile River Shelter where we ate lunch. It also had a hand pump well which we used.The trail then took us over a footbridge over the Ten Mile River. We then started a 1000 ft climb out of the river valley. The trail took us up and around the mountain and across several bluffs. We stayed on the ridge for a mile or so before dropping down about half way down the mountain to a creek. There was a blue blazed trail that paralleled the creek back up the mountain a few hundred feet to the campsite. We were joined by several other hikers at the tenting areas. The privy was basically a toilet seat on a ply wood box setting out in the open woods down a side trail. 


It started raining soon after dinner. Hopefully, it will clear off by morning.","Tentsite at Tony’s Deli

It had rained enough during the night to make the rocks slick.  We found that out later as we were going down a rocky section of the trail.  I slipped and did a barrel roll down one of rock surfaces until Mark caught me. One of my trekking poles was thrown off the side during my fall but fortunately got caught in a bush.  Mark retrieved my pole for me as I was picking myself up.  I got another bruise and scrape on my arm and tweaked my ankle but was otherwise uninjured. 


We continued down the mountain finally reaching some switchbacks to ease our descent. We got to the road to Kent, CT where we planned to resupply and Nero. As we started down the road, we passed a woman sitting in her car. She asked if we wanted a ride to town. We put our gear in her car and got in. She took us to the hiker welcome center in town and let us out. We thanked her for her kindness and offered gas money which she refused. The welcome center was basically public restrooms with a kiosk of information about the town’s businesses. It also had a coin operated shower in the back along with a water bottle filling station. Our original plan was to shower there and camp behind the coffee shop. We had heard that the owner allowed hikers to tent on the grass behind the shop. We stopped in and inquired about tenting. We were given permission but decided not to because it was a too small of an area and was next to a driveway. 


We then decided to get a room at the Fife and Drum Inn. It didn’t have guest laundry so we went to the nearby laundromat and washed our clothes. There was a small grocery store nearby so we bought our resupply while the clothes were washing. Lunch was a Cossy’s New York Style Pizza and dinner for me and John was at Shanghai Chinese.

We left our packs outside and went to eat.  I ordered a breakfast burrito and coffee. Mark got two eggs, bacon and toast. John ordered an omelette with bacon.  Everyone liked their food and the size of their portions. 


While we were paying our bills, a man with an AT shirt on asked Mark if we were hiking the AT and if we would like a ride back to the trail head. He had through hiked several years ago. We loaded our gear and got in. He drove us to the trail head and wished us safe travels.  We thanked him for the ride and asked if we could give him some gas money. He refused it and said pay it forward. 


We put on our packs and followed the trail across a pasture. It then initiated a rather long and steep climb over a mountain and had an even steeper descent on the other side. We had to maintain at least three points of contact in most areas. There were other areas where we dropped our poles down and climbed down to them using both hands and feet. It took us longer to descend than to climb up the mountain. 


After getting down, we came to a gravel service road which the trail followed for a mile or two. The path then paralleled the Houstonic River for few miles. We took a blue blaze trail to Stewart Hollow Brook Shelter and ate lunch. 


After lunch, we returned to the trail and continued to follow the river until it turned back up the mountain.  The trail then assumed a roller coaster pattern with steep climbs and steep descents.

After it had made us climb through a large cracked boulder, the trail assumed a rolling pattern with more gradual climbs and descents.We stopped by Pine Swamp Shelter for a break and to pick up water.  The stream, which was supposed to be reliable, was dried up.  So we decided to try the Sharon Mountain Campsite which was two miles further. It was also dry. The next potential water source was at Belters Campsite three miles away. We managed to get there and found a nice flowing spring. We were completely out of water so we were relieved to finally rehydrate and refill our water bottles.

We all had hamburgers with fries and several glasses of ice tea with ice cream for dessert. It was all very good.The trail turned away from there and crossed a road. We then began a long but gradual climb up Mount Prospect. Part of the way up we stopped at a spring to rehydrate and pick up extra water.  We finished the climb and made it to our campsite.

We were a little low as the water source for the campsite was dry. The trail continued down until we got to a road. We had to walk along the road for almost a mile before it took us back into the woods.  We walked a little while on fairly rolling terrain before we had a steep climb up to the Lion’s Head Mountain. We stayed on the ridge for a little while and stopped at Riga Shelter for lunch. It had a very nice view of the valley below. 


We left there and followed the ridge to Bear Mountain where we had a steep climb to a stone observation tower.  It is supposed to be the highest ground in Connecticut. It was crowded so I didn’t climb up to the top of the tower.  We did take a break under some trees nearby and enjoyed a cool breeze. 


We started down the mountain and encountered a very rocky and steep descent. We managed to make it down without incident and continued along the trail.

This was timely as we were short on water. We refilled our bottles and moved on down the trail. 


We walked past a couple of shelters that were less than a mile apart. The trail continued to descend until we reached a road crossing. We walked about a mile through a mosquito infested hemlock forest. We hurried through the woods as clouds of them harassed us.  We left the forest and had to cross a swampy area on a boardwalk followed by the plague of mosquitos. 


We finally got a little relief when we reached a pasture that we had to cross to get to US 7.  We got there and rested while I booked a room at the Holiday Inn Express in Great Barrington, MA. 


Mark had talked to a hiker earlier and got a number for a shuttle. He called a talked to “Joe” who agreed to pick us up and take us to town. Joe arrived and two other hikers, “Blouse” ( who was actually a guy) and “Crush” asked to come with us. Joe agreed and we all squeezed in.  


Joe took us all to the Holiday Inn Express. He told us that it was more centrally located for resupply and there were some restaurants close by. He also agreed to pick us up at 8 o’clock and take us back to the trail head. Mark and John made a donation for his kindness. 


After showering and washing clothes, we walked to the Great Barrington Brewery and ate supper. We all ordered steak as we haven’t had any for a long time. I also tried one of their beers, a blond ale.  They have invested in a bunch of solar arrays which supplies 85% of the power needed to brew the beer.  The food, including the beer I drank, was good.

We bought some permethrin for our clothes and tents. Also, I bought a set of trekking poles. 


Tom took us back to the Inn afterwards. He mentioned on the drive back that all of the paper used by the Treasury in Washington, DC was made in Dalton, MA.  He also said that the town was established in the late 1780’s. We also saw several huge estates on the drive back. 


We sprayed our stuff and after it dried, went to Jacobs Restaurant for dinner. The food was ok but the tea tasted like instant and no free refills.  We regretted not going back to Angelina’s. 


We went back to the room and packed up our stuff so that we could get an early start.","Kay Wood Shelter

We finished eating and checked out. We thanked the owner and walked back to the trail.  It was still following the road so we walked about a mile before it entered the woods. It then began a gradual ascent up a mountain. We got to the top and followed a ridge for a while before the trail started down.  We reached the town of Cheshire and had another road walk. 


We stopped by a small sandwich shop and ate lunch. We also bought soft serve ice cream cones for dessert. The owner also refilled our water bottles for us before we left.  


We continued on the road walk until the trail entered a small narrow stand of woods. We passed through a corn field to a busy road crossing where a couple of cars stopped to let us pass.  We then began a long climb up Mt. Greylock. 


It was steep at times but had enough flat areas that enabled us to recover somewhat from the effort. We got to the ridge where the shelter was located and followed the trail until we reached the side trail to the shelter. Mark and John took spots. I decided to tent.","Dalton, MA

We continued the climb up the mountain from the shelter. The summit was still three miles away.  It had rained during the night so the roots and rocks were slick. We also encountered several muddy areas on the way up. 


We got to the top and passed by a good size pond on the way to a road crossing. The trail crossed in front of the lodge so we stopped for second breakfast. The lodge was built by the CCC and is owned by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Resources.  It was in very good shape. Our second breakfast was very good. I had an omelette with home fries. Mark had the three egg plate with home fries with a side of bacon. John had bacon, egg and cheese 
sandwich on ciabatta bread. We ran into Fish and his wife, Diane. They have been doing the car hop slack packing like another hiker that we know, Quest. We have been passing them on the trail going south bound for the last week or so. 


Across from the lodge is a 92 feet tall tower dedicated in 1933 as a war memorial to the Massachusetts men and women who died in World War I. It had a beacon at the top that shines each night as memorial to casualties of all wars. 
The trail passed by the tower and re- entered the woods on its way down the side of the mountain. It was not as steep going down but was just as long. It also started raining.  We ran into Quest who was still doing his car hop slack packing. We hadn’t passed him lately so we thought that he gotten ahead of us. He had his lady friend, Heidi, with him and introduced us. She had knee surgery earlier in the year had to leave the trail. 


We finally got down and followed the trail through another road walk. It took us about a half mile walk through the town of Greylock. We got to a construction area and a local Sheriff that was working traffic directed us to a bridge over a river. 


We then turned and followed the white blazes up another street a few hundred feet to where it crossed over and went uphill towards the woods. We stopped by a water spigot that a homeowner made available to hikers and refilled our war bottles. 
The rain continued to steadily come down. As the day wore on, the trail turned into a creek as water ran down the path. We were soaked but didn’t get cold as long as we were moving. We soon reached our adventure feature of the day. We had to climb a long jumble of slick rocks up to a ridge in the pouring rain. Thankfully, we had a climb rather than a descent. 


We got to the top and walked the ridge about a mile or so when we reached the MA / VT border. The trail continued along the ridge another three miles to the shelter. It was packed so we had to set our tents in the rain.","Mark Noepel Shelter

We futilely hung out in our tents hoping that it would slack up. We finally packed up and left around 9 o’clock.  The trail was basically a muddy creek for long stretches. 


We followed the ridge for quite a while with a few climbs and descents but had rolling terrain mostly. We stopped by Congdon Shelter for lunch where the rain ended and the sun finally peeked out from the clouds. 


We left there and continued to follow the ridge. After a few miles, it started winding its way down to a paved road. A few areas were steep and there were some slick mossy rocks arranged to resemble stairs. However, we managed to make it down without falling. 


We crossed the road and began an immediate long climb.  We had a few steep switchbacks that got us to today’s adventure feature. It was another long steep climb through a boulder field.  Some of the rocks were arranged to create steps which helped define the path and provided better footing. We got near the top and passed through a large cracked boulder.  We then had a few switchbacks which lead us to a winding path to the top.  We then walked about a mile or so to the shelter.

The trail was muddy in several areas and we walked through other areas where water was still running down the trail. 


We immediately started climbing from the shelter so it wasn’t long before we took our jackets off and stowed them in our packs.  We got up to 3000 feet and stayed there for most of the day.  We passed quite a few SOBO’s for the AT and the Long Trail which are concurrent in Vermont. Women made of the majority of those that we passed on the trail. 


We ate lunch at Goddard Shelter then climbed up to the top of Glastenbury Mountain where there is a fire tower. It was originally installed in 1927 but was recently refurbished according to the trail guide. It was not rickety like some of the other ones that Mark and I climbed.  It had  steel grates for steps and wire rope attached to the four corners and to anchor blocks. The view was spectacular at the top with 360 degree views. We lingered there a while and admired the views. It the distance, the could see a wind farm on a ridge a few miles away.

To get there, we had to endure another muddy trail and climb over Stratton Mountain. At the top, is a fire tower that is on the National Register of Historical Places and is where Benton McKaye git the inspiration for the Appalachian Trail. 


We stopped to eat lunch and then climbed the tower to enjoy the views. The clear sky enabled us to see ski resorts on nearby mountains, far away lakes and the wind mill farm that we saw at the other fire tower yesterday. 


We left there and descended down to a ridge. The trail took us through more muddy and wet areas until we reached the  side trail to the shelter. It was a half mile off the AT but was relatively flat and a better walk than some other side trails that we have been on. 


As we arrived, a crew from the Green Mountain Club was finishing up building a new privy. We thanked them for their hard work and things that they do for the trail. 


A spring was located nearby. The water was very cold and relatively free of debris.  I picked up a couple of liters to fill my empty water bottle and to use for dinner. After filtering my water, I accidentally dropped my filter on a rock and cracked it.

We left the shelter and walked the half mile back to the trail.  We followed the trail to where it turned down a USFS gravel road.  We were on the road for about a half mile or so until the path turned back into the woods.  The terrain assumed a rolling pattern with no large ups or downs. A few miles later we reached VT 11&30.  


We went across to the trailhead parking lot and held out our thumbs. After about 15 minutes, a kind lady stopped and gave us and another hiker a lift to McDonalds as we were hungry and couldn’t check into our room until later. I had a deluxe quarter pounder, a large fry, a Big Mac and an ice cream cone. Mark got the Double Quarter Pounder, large fry and an ice cream cone. John got the Double Quarter Pounder and a Filet O’Fish sandwich and an ice cream cone.


We left there and walked up to the Mountain Goat Outfitter so I could buy another Sawyer Squeeze Filter.  As I was putting my new filter in my pack, a hiker that we know, Crouton, hollered at us from a passing car. He and a 2017 AT hiker, Daze, came back to talk to us. They were going to eat and asked us to come. We declined as we had just recently ate and still had to wash our clothes and buy our groceries. We then discussed dinner after we got showers. Daze, who lives in Manchester, offered to take us to our motel after we finished washing our clothes. 


We left there and walked to the New Balance outlet where Mark bought some shoes. His Keen Arroyo III shoes were worn out so he was trying to get something that would last until Hanover, NH. Bett and Gale were sending us our winter clothes plus new boots along with some resupply items to the Post Office there.


We got to the laundromat and changed into our rain gear while our clothes were washing and drying. The place was hiker friendly so they had a place to change clothes. Basically, it was a closet size space with a curtain. They also had plenty of outlets so that we could charge our electronics. 


We got our clothes washed and dried. Daze picked us up and drove us to the Econolodge.  We thanked him for the ride and offered him a donation which he refused. We also told him that we couldn’t meet him and Crouton for dinner as by the time we got ready it would be after 6 o’clock or so. We were also pretty tired from the day. He understood and would convey our regrets to Crouton. 


We got our showers and then looked around for a nearby restaurant. We ended up walking across the street to the Fraternal Order of the Eagles lodge and ate a rib eye steak dinner that had open to the public. The food was pretty good and reasonably priced.","William Douglas Shelter

The Diner was one of those gleaming metal ones that you see on TV. We took a table and the waitress quickly brought us fresh brewed coffee and a glass of ice water. I ordered the Farmer Green Skillet which was loaded with eggs, home fries, peppers, onions, mushrooms and cheese. Mark got his usual two eggs over medium with toast and bacon. John got the same. I also ordered a bacon, egg and cheese bagel to carry out on the trail.  All of the food was very good. 


We went back to the Econolodge, picked up our packs and checked out. We then walked up the road to the Eagles Lodge to try and get a hitch. After about 15 minutes a lady picked us up and took us back to the trailhead. We thanked and offered her some money which she refused. 


We then began a long gradual ascent to Bromley Mountain. The trail didn’t really have any steep areas until we started up a ski slope.  We got to the top and took a break. The view was hazy but good. The ski lifts were nearby and there was a Warming Hut that hikers could sleep in when it is not in use. 


The trail down was also pretty gradual We got to a gap and then started climbing  back up to 3000 feet. We stayed on a ridge for a couple of miles then dropped down to another ridge which took us to Peru Peak Shelter where we ate lunch. 


We left there and continued along the ridge past Griffith Lake until we reached Baker Peak. This was our adventure feature of the day. We had to climb up an exposed rock ridge which was fortunately dry and moss free. Falling would have had catastrophic consequences.

We got down to Big Branch, a large creek, and walked along its bank until we reached a parking area. We took a break then re-entered the woods and started a gradual climb. The trail took us to Little Rock Pond, a nice sized lake. We walked along its bank for quite a while then began climbing again. 


After we got to the top of the mountain and walked a ridge for a short while before descending. As we walked down the mountain we passed two areas, the second larger than the first, where hikers had piled up rocks in artistic ways. Some of the rocks were arranged in patterns while others were placed in trees or made into “Rock Men” with sticks used as arms. It appeared that the rock gardens were built over many hours over several years.


We continued to descend and reached Green Wall Shelter after about a couple of miles. We stopped for lunch and finished off our water.  Fortunately, there was a stream about a mile further down the mountain where we picked up water. There was a nice cascade there which I was tempted to get under. However, the water was cold so I passed it up. 


We left there and crossed a paved road a mile or so later. We then began the long climb up Bear Mountain. This had to be at least the fourth one that we had to climb since we started.

After a couple of miles, we ran into Quest and his lady friend “Hyper”.  They were hiking back to where Quest parked his other car. They asked us to check on their cars at the trailhead parking lot when we got to it as there were some shady characters camping near there. We said we would and would call Quest on his phone if we saw anything out of order. 


A while later we checked out their cars and seeing nothing wrong continued on our hike. We crossed the road and walked through an overgrown pasture. The trail then took us up a steep boulder climb between two massive solid rock walls.  We got to the top and followed a ridge a mile over to Clarendon Shelter where we stopped for water.  The trail left there and began another climb to a ridge.  We wasn’t there very long before the path dropped down to a large creek. We crossed over on stepping stones and began climbing again.  


We reached Governor Clement Shelter and ate lunch.  We left there and began the long steep climb to Killington Peak.  The trail was very rooty along the path. At a little over halfway up, Both my left foot and left trekking pole got tangled up in the roots and I tripped. As I was falling forward, I let go of my poles so that I could catch myself with my hands. My left trekking pole still caught in the root sprang back up and busted my nose. I grabbed my nose thinking it was broken. I also checked my front teeth as they were also hit and I was spitting out blood. My nose was pretty sore and I had a little bit of a fat lip but nothing seemed to be broken. It was the first bloody nose that I had in over forty-five years. 


My trekking pole was bent in the process so Mark straightened it for me while I was getting the bleeding to stop. I asked him if my nose was swollen. He said, in his usual comforting way, that he couldn’t tell if it was any bigger than before. We sat there until I felt that I could walk without bleeding to death through my nose. It was a painful and bloody lesson how quickly one can get hurt.

Our plan for the day was to hike to US 4 and catch a hitch to Rutland, VT. We needed a short resupply to get us to Hanover, NH. Mark also needed a prescription filled. We were going to check out the Hiker Hostel at The Yellow Deli. 


We finished our breakfast and started out on the trail. The path led us down the mountain. The descent was a lot more gradual than the ascent. We ran into several AT SOBO’s and a few day hikers. We also ran into Quest who thanked us for checking on his car yesterday. 


We moved on down the mountain and reached US 4 which is the road to Rutland, VT.  After about 15 minutes, a young lady in a beat up Dodge Truck stopped and picked up us and another hiker. We all piled into the back of her truck. We asked her to take us to the Yellow Deli. 


She dropped us off after about 20 minutes at the Yellow Deli. We thanked her for the ride and offered her some cash. She refused and said she was glad to help. The caretaker at the hostel gave us a tour of the facility and went over the rules.  Both the deli and the hostel are run by the Twelve Tribes Community, a religious group.  We were pleasantly surprised with the facility. It was very clean and had laundry available so we decided to take bunks. 


We got showers and then ate lunch at the deli. I had the Deli Rose, a sandwich made with roast beef and turkey, provolone cheese and tomato and lettuce. I also got a cup of their garden vegetable soup which came with fresh baked bread. Mark had the Deli Rose with chips. John had a roast beef on rye bread sandwich with a cup of soup. Mark and I had carrot cake for dessert. John had a deluxe banana nut bread. 


We went and did our resupply then washed and dried our clothes. Afterward, we went back to the Deli for dinner. I had a chefs salad and a full bowl of the vegetable soup.

They didn’t have a TV or radio in the room so we sat around reading some of the religious material that they had available. Based on what I read, the two founders used to belong to the Presbyterian Church. They started the first “Yellow Deli” in Chattanooga, TN and eventually had seven locations. After some time had elapsed, they became disenchanted with the church and decided to start their own fundamentalist church which met in a local park. They attracted a lot of college age people to their meetings. Some became a part of their Twelve Tribes of Israel Community. As best as I can tell, they live communal, home school and all work in the various enterprises owned by the Twelve Tribes. 


We went back to the bunk room and stripped our sheets and pillow cases and put them in the designated laundry basket. It was time for breakfast, so we went into the restaurant and walked into a large room where they served breakfast. We had scrambled eggs, rice and two kinds of bread. We also had coffee and a fruit smoothie. 


After everyone had finished eating, the Hostel Caretaker asked for everyone’s attention. We kind expected that he would give us a sermon. However, he got a head count on how many were staying another night, how many were going to slackpack that day, did anyone want to volunteer to work on their farm for the day. He also told us that the first bus back to the trailhead left at 8:15 and then every hour after that. He then asked those that were staying to move their gear out of the hostel so that they could clean and put fresh sheets on the bed. 

They were very nice hosts and did not try to push their beliefs on their guests. This was by far the best hostel that we stayed in. It also was nicer than a lot of the hotels where we have spent the night.
We went back to the bunk room and picked up our gear. We then put some money in the donation box for the bunks and food.  It was close to 8:15 so we went got on the bus. He only charged us a dollar a piece since we were all over 60 years old.  About 30 minutes later we were back at the trail head. 

The path led us up a shirt steep climb after crossing an over grown pasture. We got to the top and walked a short distance before in started back down. The trail took us through Gifford Woods State Park. There were several occupied camper and tent spots. We got to a road and crossed over to the Kent Pond trail head. The trail took us along the shoreline of Kent Pond, a fairly large lake. 


After about a half mile, we turned away from the lake and climbed a small hill. We then followed the trail across a USFS service road. The path led us down to Thundering Falls. According to the trail guide, it is the largest waterfall on the AT in Vermont. We stopped there for a break and checked out the waterfall. It was impressive. There was also an old power generation plant located on the creek. We could see a pin stock pipe line extending from the top of the falls to an old wooden building at the bottom.


We left there and walked across a boardwalk over a swampy area to a road crossing. We then initiated a steep 1500 feet climb up Quimby Mountain. We finally got to the top and was able to walk the ridge for about 3 miles. The trail then took us down to Stony Brook Shelter.

We then started a gradual climb up to about 2000 feet and stayed on a ridge for about 7 miles. The trail then took us down to Wintturi Shelter where we ate lunch and refilled our water bottles. 


After lunch, we walked up the shelter side trail back to the AT. The path took us on a downward trend on a relatively good walking surface to VT 12. We walked up the road to “On the Edge Farm Stand” where we each bought a pint of ice cream. Mark and I also bought a Gatorade to drink. John bought some chocolate milk. 


While we were there, a hiker that we know, Granite, was waiting on a ride. She thought that she was having symptoms of Lyme’s disease and was going to the doctor to get checked out. She appeared to be upset that she may have to go off trail being this close to finishing. We wished her well and walked back to the trail head. 


We had a 1000 feet steep climb over a mountain peak. The trail then took us down in a more gradual manner than going up. We got down to a paved road and used a footbridge to cross over a creek.

The place did not open for another 30 minutes so we decided to wait. After about 15 minutes a man drove up in a ATV. He was the actual owner of the farm market but it was run by his daughter and wife. He told us about his 1000 acre farm and a little bit about the AT that he knew. He was a very nice fellow. The market opened and we went in to check it out. It was basically a restaurant/event center but did have a small section of items. They only had cinnamon flavored and coffee flavored ice cream. The only soft drinks available were some natural sugar local brand. They did have a chicken sandwich for sale so we each ordered one. Mark and I bought one of the soft drinks to have with our sandwich. John used his water bottle. The sandwich was very good but there were no side items like chips with it.
We left there and walked back to the trailhead. We then started back on the rolling terrain crossing a few gravel and paved roads. We finally got up on a ridge and followed it to West Hartford, VT.  We crossed over the White River and stopped by a house that has soft drinks and snacks for donations. We each had a soft drink and some of the snacks. We also refilled our water bottles. We left a donation for the drinks and snacks. 


We had a road walk through the small town. The white blazes then directed us to turn up another road until we re- entered the woods. We started an immediate long climb that was steep in places. However, the trail surface was relatively free of roots and rocks which made walking easier.

He is a nice guy and we were glad to meet him. 


 We wanted to pick up our boxes that our wives had sent us and have enough time to send stuff back if needed. Mark was planning to send home the New Balance shoes that he bought as a temporary replacement for the Keen hiking sandals that he wore out. My pair were worn out also but were good enough to last me until Hanover. Gale had bought me another pair of Keen Targhee III boots and shipped them to me along with several other needed items. The trail trended downhill in a rolling manner. The path surface was still relatively rock and root free so we made good progress. We exited the woods at a paved road. The trail had us on a road walk through Norwich, VT.  It appeared to be an expensive place as the homes were quite large.  A historical marker that we walked by stated that the town was chartered in 1761.  The white blazes kept us on a road walk towards Hanover. We passed a couple of SOBO’s on the way to the bridge over the Connecticut River. Midway, we crossed over the VT/NH border.  We continued up the road through Hanover. We passed by Dartmouth University which like most colleges seemed to be always building new buildings.  It is my understanding that it is very expensive to go to school there. 


We continued to follow the white blazes on the road walk. Soon, we walked to the Post Office which happened to be on the trail. We left our packs outside and as we walked in was greeted by a clerk that said: “You must be looking to pick up a package”.  She asked us for our ID’s and then went in the back to get our boxes. 


I waited outside with our packs while Mark and John were shipping their shoes back home. Soon we booked a room at the Sunset Motor Lodge that the guide said was hiker friendly and had a shuttle to pick us up. The room would not be ready until 1 o’clock and the pizza place was not open yet so we went to the Howe Library to kill some time. 



The pizza place, Brick Oven, gave us a free slice since we were AT through hikers. We also each bought a personal size pizza for lunch. The food was very good.We called the motel at 1 o’clock and the owner picked us up. The place was clean but there were no restaurants or grocery stores nearby. We would have call an Uber or a shuttle service to take us to eat and eat and resupply. 


We called an Uber after we showered and washed our clothes. He took us to the CO-OP Grocery store which appeared to be a “light” version of Whole Foods. There was a Mexican restaurant close by so we went and ate first. 


After we finished at the grocery store, we tried getting an Uber but there were none available. I had picked up a list of potential shuttles at the library so I called David Avery to see if he would take us back to the motel.

We started down the trail and walked past Dartmouth’s athletic Fields. We then entered the woods and began an immediate climb. The trail was steep in places but had enough switchbacks for us to recover.  We got to the top and followed a ridge for a while. We passed through some pastures and a few swamps. We met Quest heading south on the trail. We talked for a little while before moving on. 

The trail took us across several roads including where Quest stashed his car. We looked to make sure it was ok and continued on. The trail took on a roller coaster trend with several, some steep, ups and downs. We then had a long climb up Moose Mountain where the trail took us to Moose Mountain Shelter. We stopped for lunch. However, there was no water close by so we were not able to refill our water bottles. 


After lunch we got back on the trail and walked across the ridge to the North Peak of the mountain. The path then ramped down. The creeks that we crossed were either dry or basically mud holes. We finally reached a creek with good water. We refilled our bottles and cameled up on water.


We continued on down until we got to another road crossing. The trail took us past a beaver pond and swamp before starting the long steep climb to Holt’s Ledge. There were no switchbacks to give us any relief from the climb. The trail was either straight up or on a very steep ramp.


We finally got to the top and walked past the ledges. There were some nice views but none that I would consider as a Kodak moment. The trail then started down the other side in a more gradual manner with a few switchbacks. We reached the side trail to Trapper John Shelter and walked the 0.3 mile to it. There was a nice creek close by so we picked up some more water.","Hanover,

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620699,"We knew today would be a tough one for us so we got ready and was on the trail a little after 7 o’clock. The path continued down the mountain crossing a couple of creeks and swampy areas when we got to the bottom. We got to a road crossing and then started the long steep 2200 feet climb up Smarts Mountain. We had a little bit of everything. Stone steps, wood steps, rebar steps, rock climbs and exposed stone ridges but no switchbacks.  However, there was a fire tower at the top that provided fantastic 360 degree views of the surrounding countryside. There was also an old fire warden’s cabin, where we ate lunch,  nearby that is now used as an AT shelter. 


We then followed the trail on a long but gradual descent down to a large creek. We were about out so we picked up water.  We left there and started a long climb up Cube Mountain. The ascent was also steep with rock climbs and no switchbacks. We got the side trail to the Hexacube Shelter and decided to climb the steep 0.2 mile. 

The shelter gets its name from being constructed in a hexagon shape. The privy has a pentagon shape and is called the “Penta Privy”. I took a space in the shelter due to the few available tent sites not looking too good.","Trapper John Shelter

Only a few bugs bothered me last night. I pulled my liner sheet over my head which made an effective bug barrier.  By morning, the cooler temperature had run them off. 


Today, our goal was to hike to Jeffers Creek Shelter at the base of Mt. Moosilauke, at just over 4800 feet. We wanted fresh legs before tackling the 4 mile long climb. However, we had to complete our climb up and over Mt. Cube.  


We left the shelter around 7 o’clock and hiked down the steep 0.2 mile path to the AT.  We then crossed a dry creek and followed the trail around the side of the mountain. We then started our adventure feature of the day with steep rock climbs up rock balds. Fortunately, they were dry and our footing was more secure. We eventually got to the summit which had a nice view. We also saw where hikers scratched their names or dates into the rock surface. Two dates that we could see were 1873 and 1888. The name near the 1873 date was G.E. Ward. There was a name inscribed twice by the 1888 date, F.L. Beal, but it did not appear to be of the same vintage. 


We left there and walked a ridge for a short time. It then started steeply down the side of the mountain until we finally got to some switchbacks and a more moderate grade. 


We got down and crossed a paved and a gravel road before we started a 1000 feet climb up to Ore Hill tentsite where we ate lunch. The trail stayed on a ridge which took us to Mt. Mist. We had about a 500 feet climb then a 1000 feet descent to NH 25. 


Mark and I decided to walk 0.3 mile up the road to the Hikers Welcome Hostel. John decided to go on to the shelter. I needed to pickup a few food supplies which the guide said they carried. Mark, as usual, was wanting some ice cream. Mark and I bought the hikers combo which was a microwave pizza, a small bag of chips, a soft drink and a ice cream sandwich. Heretofore, microwave pizza would be on my “I would rather do with out” list. I am surprised how rapidly I inhaled that piece of cardboard. My palate now has no shame. 


Both us bought an additional soft drink. Mark, not surprisingly, bought another ice cream sandwich. I bought two frozen jimmy dean breakfast sandwiches to eat tomorrow morning. Before we left, we also refilled our water bottles from the faucet on the sink. 


We walked back down the road to the trail head. We crossed a stream and started a gradual climb. Evidently, Mark enjoyed his ice cream sandwiches as he mentioned several times that he wished that he had bought one more. We hiked a mile to the side trail to the shelter. There were several hikers tenting. Mark and John took spots in the shelter. I set up my tent.","Hexacube Shelter

I believe that today was most physically challenging days that we had. The climb up Mt. Moosilauke started off with a gradual gain in elevation. That changed after we hiked a mile or so. The relatively smooth trail morphed into a steep boulder climb. We had to use both hands to pull ourselves up and over large boulders in several areas. We would climb few hundred feet then walk a short distance to another boulder field to climb. Roots and trees often provided foot or handholds. Thankfully, it had not rained in s few days so neither the rocks or roots were slick. 


It took four hours for us to get to the ridge. We then hiked another mile to the peak which was above the tree line. The 360 view was amazing even though it was hazy. The wind was blowing brisk and our clothes were wet from sweat so we sat down behind an old cabin foundation and ate a snack.


Knowing that we still had a long hike ahead of us and that rain was forecast for the afternoon, we started down the mountain.  The trail down was a lot more steeper than going up. The going was slow as a fall could have been catastrophic. Again, small trees and roots were used to help us down steep areas. We used our hands more than our trekking poles. We descended about a 1000 feet when we reached the side trail to Beavers Brook Shelter. Hungry as usual, we decided to stop there for lunch. 


We finished lunch and continued our climb down the mountain.  We descended a little further and the trail started following a creek down the mountain. There were several long cascades and water “slides” that were pretty. I took a couple of pictures but they do not give it justice.


We reached a few areas where the trail maintainers had inserted rebar steps and several wood block steps. Some of the wood steps were rotted and some were missing which required us to sit and scoot down the rock. Please note that none of these steps would meet any safety regulations. 


We finally reached Kinsman Notch (NH 112) and crossed the road. It was 2:30 and we still had 8 miles to go to get to Elisa Brooke Shelter.  We had another steep boulder climb that got us up on a ridge. The trail took us steadily higher with a lot of short and sometimes steep climbs over boulders. It path then dropped down and we walked across a mountain top swamp on a two board walkway that had many rotten or broken boards. 


After we crossed the swamp, the guide indicated that an unreliable creek was not far away. It was humid so we each went through two liters not long after got past the swamp. We got to the creek and only found a trickle with couple of puddles that we could dip water. The water had a slight tint of tannin but tasted ok after we filtered it.


As luck would have it, it started raining. We put our covers on our packs but went with out our rainsuits as we were wet from sweat. The rain was light at first but then picked up in intensity. We were soaked to the bone in short order. Water started running down the trail which made footing slick on rocks and roots. The thunder and lightning did not help either. We were over 3000 feet at the height of the storm. Fortunately, we were under the tree canopy so we felt like that we had some protection. The storm passed but it was still raining steadily. The trail was flooded in a lot of places. Mark slipped into a mud hole and could not reach the bottom with his arm to  push himself back up. He wallowed over and managed to get up.  His right side was pretty much covered in mud. As a result, we started walking around other mud holes unless we had stepping stones or logs in there. 


The rain continued on and off but mostly on. It started getting dark so we eventually had to stop and get our headlamps on. The rain and fog limited the lights effectiveness so we had to be careful of where we stepped. We managed to get to the shelter at 8:30. We quickly got out of our wet clothes in to dry ones. We got cold after we stopped hiking. We were hungry, so dinner was a protein bar and a pack of cheese crackers. Mark ate spam wrapped in a tortilla. We both took spots in the shelter. John fell behind and found campsite somewhere on the mountain.","Jeffers Brook Shelter

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621133,"We woke to more rain. I had decided to eat my Mountain House spaghetti for breakfast. I tried to eat it slow as I was down to one Gatorade bar and one pack of pop tarts that I had bought at Hikers Welcome Hostel. Mark ate his poptart/ peanut butter sandwich for breakfast along with a protein bar. He still had a couple of protein bars and a pack or two of spam singles. We definitely had to make it to town to resupply. 


It was still raining when we left the shelter.   Our clothes were still wet from yesterday so there was really no reason wait any longer.  At first, it was a little cold but we warmed up from hiking. The trailhead was 8.8 miles away but we still had to climb about 2500 feet over Kinsman Mountain then a long descent. 



The trail was rough going up. Lots of wet rock climbs and no switchbacks. It took us a long time to get up to the top. When we got there, above the tree line, we were walking through a rain cloud which would have obscured any view.
The trail surface was exposed rock which was fairly smooth. This enabled us to travel a little faster along. We reached the other side and climbed down a hundred feet or more before encountering a more gradual descent.  It still took us quite a while to get  down the mountain. However, it finally quit raining and the sun came out a little later. 


We reached one of the Appalachian Mountain Club’s Huts that was on the shore of Lost Pond Lake. These are considered “full service” with meals and other amenities for their guests. 


We followed the trail around the lake until it turned and followed a creek for a few miles. The trail then went under Interstate 93 and followed another creek for a short way. We reached the side trail to the Liberty Springs Trailhead. We then walked about 0.8 mile to the parking lot where we called Gannon Taxi Service. While we were waiting in the parking lot, a bear walked up across from us. It didn’t seem afraid of us at all. It looked at us and started our way but I yelled at it and it turned walked away. Mark speculated that someone had been feeding it as it seemed comfortable around people. 


Not long after, our taxi arrived and took us to the Holiday Inn Express. We showered and walked to a nearby McDonald’s to eat dinner.","Elisa Brook Shelter

Then we walked down to the grocery store to resupply. I didn’t get much as Gale sent me a box of freeze dried food and a few other items that I needed. 


We walked back to the hotel and started packing up our gear and putting our food in our bear canisters. It was getting to be around 10:30 so we checked out and walked over to McDonald’s to eat lunch and call Gannon’s Taxi again. 


We got back to the trailhead around 12 o’clock. It was a long rocky but gradual climb up to the ridge. After 3 miles we reached the Liberty Springs tentsite. We stopped and refilled our water bottles and continued the climb up to the ridge. 


We reached the ridge and followed it over to Little Haystack Mountain. We had another steep climb over rocks. We reached the top and was above the tree line. The view was fantastic in all directions. We could see the trail extending along the exposed ridge tops for a long distance. We still had a lot of rock climbs and descents ahead of us. 


We reached the top of Mt. Lafayette and then the trail took us down a long rocky path. Our plan was to reach Garfield Ridge Shelter but it got too dark for us to go further. We found a tent site and set up our tents. We were short on water so we ate protein bars for dinner.  It started raining shortly after we got in our tents for the night.","Lincoln, NH

The rain had quit by the time we woke up. We were low on water so we had to pass on making coffee. Breakfast was protein bars. Our plan was to climb over Mt. Garfield, stop at the Garfield campsite for water and possibly head to Guyot Shelter if rain was forecast.

The trail took us up a long steep rock climb up the mountain. There was a short rocky ridge and then a long steep rock climb down to the Garfield Ridge Shelter. We “cameled up” and refilled our water bottles. We then continued the rock climb down to a ridge where we continued to encounter a rocky surface.


We reached Galehead Hut, a lodge operated by the Appalachian Mountain Club around noon. We each bought a bowl of potato soup. They didn’t have anything to go with it but the soup was very good. I went back and bought another bowl. We refilled our water bottles and then headed towards Guyot Shelter. Rain was forecast for 5 o’clock and we didn’t want to get caught in it. 


We had a steep rocky climb up South Twin mountain then the trail took us across a bunch rocks which served as the trail surface. We reached a side trail that indicated Guyot Shelter.  It was getting on in the afternoon, so we started climbing up above the tree line and reached a windy ridge top. It started sleeting, but it didn’t last very long. We then followed another rock strewn path down to a steep side trail to the shelter. We stopped by the caretakers tent and each of us paid ten bucks for the AT thru hikers pass. We then made it down to the shelter just before it started to rain.

My sleeping bag was warm and I was reluctant to leave it.  However, we got up and packed up our gear while we were waiting for the crowded eating area to clear out some.  I put my long sleeve shirt over my tee shirt and then put on my rain jacket due to the cold temperature. I have only worn long pants since we left Hanover.


We then went to eat our breakfast and refill our water bottles from the nearby spring.  Afterwards, we packed up the rest of our gear and started the rocky climb back up the trail. We got to the ridge above the tree line and found ourselves walking in a cloud. A wet howling wind was trying to blow us off of the ridge. I dipped my left shoulder and hunched over but some of the gusts still blew me sideways. 


We managed to get back on the AT and followed the trail back into the protection of the woods. The trail took us steadily down to another ridge where we got some relief from steep rock climbs up or down. However, the path surface was still strewn with ankle breaking rocks. 


We reached Zealand Falls Hut where we stopped to buy some soup. They had tomato soup and bread. We each bought the first bowl and got the second bowl for a half price. Both the bread and soup were very good on a cool day. Afterwards, we walked outside and there were several garter snakes curled up together near a bench presumably trying to keep warm.
We left there and finished the rocky descent to a ridge. We followed a relatively smooth trail   with only a few short rock piles to climb over.  We met three hikers who were doing trail magic on the trail. They gave each of us a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. They also gave us an 8 ounce block of sharp cheddar cheese and a package of pepperoni. In addition, they took our trash.   They also answered our questions on the mountains ahead. We thanked for their kindness and moved on. Farther down the trail we met a US Forest Service Ranger. We stopped and spoke with her a while. She was out  patrolling the trail. We thanked her for what she did and continued heading for the shelter.

One benefit of staying at a AMC run shelter is that they post the weather forecast for the mountain summits and the valleys. We would see both today as the trail took us down to Crawford Notch. The path surface leaving the shelter was relatively smooth with only a few rocks that we had to step around. We reached the start of the descent and ran into a few steep sections before getting to some switchbacks. The trail then wound us down to a trailhead parking area. We followed the white blazes down a paved road to NH 302.  After crossing the road, we started an immediate climb up Mt. Webster. Initially, we had long switchbacks taking us up the flank of the mountain.  The farther up the mountain we hiked, the steeper the switchbacks became. We finally got to a point where we were doing monkey climbs up the rocks. Fortunately, the rock surface was dry which aided footing.  We walked along several bluffs which had nice views of the countryside. The wind was gusty so we didn’t get too close to the edge or hang around for very long. 


We passed few hikers that were going to the Mizpah Spring Hut. It appears that it is popular to do the “Hut Traverse”. They make their reservations months in advance and hike to them each day. 


We got to the summit of Mt. Webster and had a magnificent 360 degree view of the surrounding countryside. We found a place out of the gusting wind and ate lunch.The trail took us down out of the wind and back in the trees. We then had several descents which often had us drop down our trekking poles before climbing down.  We followed the trail down to a ridge which took us over to Mt. Jackson.  We found ourselves scrambling up or down a rock face as much as hiking.  We got to the top and had  another stunning 360 degree view. We could see the Mizpah Spring Hut on the side of Mt. Pierce in the distance. We could also see the cloud shrouded peak of Mt. Washington which we will climb tomorrow, weather permitting. It is our understanding that the worst weather in the world is on the summit. Hopefully, the forecast will be favorable. 



The trail took us down to a ridge over to Mt. Pierce. We had a few rock faces that required us to drop down our trekking poles before climbing down. We also walked across some swampy areas on boards or log walkways.
We then climbed up to the ridge where the Hut was located. We stopped in and filled our water bottles and Sawyer bladders after “canceling up”. The Nauman Tentsite was adjacent to the Hut so we walked over to the caretakers tent and signed up for two tent spots.

It started raining before daylight. Fortunately, it didn’t last long and the gusty wind that followed it dried our tents off somewhat.  We packed up our gear and ate breakfast.  We then put on our packs and walked over to the hut to fill our water bottles. 


We started an immediate climb up to the summit of Mt. Pierce. We had a few rock climbs to get there. There was no view as we were walking in a cloud.  We stayed above the tree line for quite a while. It reminded me of the Franconia Ridge that we hiked a couple of days ago except fog prevented any view of the countryside. 


We reached the Lake of the Clouds Hut and stopped to take a break. We ate a couple of bowls of tomato soup and refilled our water bottles.  We then started up Mt. Washington. We passed a sign warning that the weather was the worst in America and that hikers have died from exposure even in the summer. 



The rocky trail turned into a rock hop. The grade was not too bad but having to walk on top of large rocks really worked our ankles, knees and feet. We were still enveloped by clouds so we couldn’t see more than fifty feet or so around us.
We finally got to the summit where there is a large complex of buildings. Besides the visitor center, there is a weather observatory and a museum called the Tip Top House which was an old lodge built from native stone. It was a pretty popular place as there many people there that either rode the cog train up or drive a car up the auto road. 


We went to the snack bar and decided to eat lunch. Mark had two slices of pizza. I got a slice of pizza and a chili dog with a bag of pretzels. We both had Powerade to drink. We also each bought a grinder (sub sandwich) to take on the trail. We walked outside and the wind gusts really picked up. We decided to get off the summit and head towards Madison Hut. 


We left there and began a rock hop down from the summit. The trip down seemed to put more stress on our knees and take much longer than going up. This continued for the five miles to Madison Hut. We filled our water bottles and decided to hike the 1/2 mile down the steep Valley Way trail to the Valley Way Campsite. It was getting late in the day and we didn’t want to be caught in the dark navigating over these rough trails. 



The trail down wasn’t anywhere close to being as rocky as the trails earlier in day. However, the steepness of it and long step downs did not help our knees. We were surprised, due to the difficulty of getting there, to see all of the tent pads occupied. We looked around and found a couple of small places barely big enough to put our tents. It was nearly dark and we were tired from the hike so we ate our sandwiches and turned in for the night.","Nauman Tentsite

We stopped at the hut and refilled our water bottles. The trail took us on another rock hop up Mt. Madison. We got to the summit and took a break. The view was outstanding. Afterwards, we followed the ridge down from the summit. The trail continued to be a jumble of rocks. There were few, if any, white blazes. Rather, the trail was marked by rock cairns so we followed those since it was difficult to determine the actual pathway. Some of the rocks had worn spots from people stepping on them so that also helped some. There were several locations where other trails intersected the AT. There were sign posts indicating the trails and directions but they were not always oriented correctly. In those cases, we would walk a short distance down the trail and check my Guthook App for the correct path. 


Progress was slow going down the ridge. The disadvantage to monovision contacts is that it affects my depth perception. I have to carefully step down until my foot contacts the rock surface or risk losing my balance and falling which happened a few times. Fortunately, all I got was some additions to my bruise collection and I lost one of my crocs somewhere. Mark commented that I need to quit sitting or laying down so much.


We finally made it to the tree line and got out of the rock field. It was still steep but we had a trees and roots to use for handholds. As we got lower down the ridge, our progress improved as the trail surface got better and leveled out some. 


It was about 3:30 when we got to the Pinkham Notch Visitor Center. We went inside and used our through hikers pass to get a two dollar bowl of soup and bread. We didn’t have cell service so the staff at the center let us use their phone to call around for a place to stay. We kept getting voice recordings but finally got a room at the Rattle River Hostel. It had a shuttle service included in the stay so they picked us up a little after 5 o’clock.  We need to resupply so we will have to take the first Zero since the Shenandoah’s.  On the bright side, it will give us a chance, me especially, for our knees to recover from the descents of the last few days.","Valley Way Tentsite

Afterwards, several of us helped clean up and load the dish washer. 



The hostel included shuttle service to Walmart. Mark needed a new set of trekking poles and we both needed new fuel canisters. We also were going to resupply our food. We intended to pickup at least seven days worth of food. The plan was to take a light pack with two day’s food and stash the other five days along with any clothes that we didn’t feel we would need at the hostel. Looking at the map on the wall at the hostel, we felt that we could complete the 21 miles in two days. The trailhead on NH Route 2 was only about a tenth of a mile from the hostel so it would be an easy walk back after we finished the Wildcat and Carter Mountain ranges.Walmart was out of both the trekking poles and the fuel canisters that we needed.

The shuttle dropped us off at the Pinkham Notch Visitor Center a little after 8 o’clock. We thanked the driver and went inside the Visitor Center and bought fuel canisters. Mark also bought a new set of trekking poles. We then got our packs and walked across the road to the trail head.Our plan was to try and make it to a shelter that was about 13 miles from Pinkham Notch. If we couldn’t make it, we would stop at Zeta Pass where some hikers that we talked to at the hostel said there were good stealth campsites. They also mentioned that the water source was dry. The trail took us back into the woods where we crossed a creek on a foot bridge. The path then turned parallel to the creek for about a half mile or so before beginning a long and steep rock climb up Wildcat Mountain. We encountered some rock faces which required us to throw our sticks up on top and use both hands to climb up. The rocks being wet and slick made it tougher.At one particular scary place, Mark asked me to wait until he got up the rock face before I attempted to climb. That way, if he fell he wouldn’t take me with him. The idea was that one of us needed to survive if the other fell. 


Mark complained that we were doing more rock climbing than hiking. I told him that I would have brought a grappling hook and some repelling gear if I had known that we would need it. 


We finally made it to the top of the ridge and made several more climbs until we reached Carter’s Notch.  We had a long steep climb down from the mountain until we finally reached a switchback or two. The took us to a side trail to Carter Notch Hut. We stopped at the hut and had a very good bowl of beef vegetable soup along with some cheesecake that we got free with our AMC through hikers pass.


After topping off our water bottles and picking up an extra liter a piece, we left and went back to the AT.  We then had a immediate long steep climb up Carter’s Dome which got us over 4000 feet again.  We then followed the trail over Mt.

It was still dark and rainy so I was in no hurry to get up. The interesting thing was that most mornings before we reached the White Mountain National Forest, birds singing would wake us up as soon as it was getting daylight. This morning, the sound of creaking wood and gusting wind provided us our wake up call.
I laid there a minute listening to the creaking sound and I was getting an uneasy feeling.  I said  “Mark, do you hear that creaking?” He said “yes, but I think it is only two trees rubbing together. I have to go pee so I will take a look.”  He came back shortly and said “ Hey Michael, we probably need to move. The tree that is creaking is busted open and will fall soon.” It was probably the quickest that I ever broke down and moved my gear. 


After we our stuff to another tent site out of the way of the widow maker,  we went back to check it out. Sure enough, the tree was split down the middle to about five feet from the ground. It was getting daylight by then and we could see the trees twisting in the wind.  Mark said “I don’t remember that tree looking like that last night”. I said “ me neither”. It is standard operating procedure to check for dead trees or limbs before setting up tents. Apparently, the wind split it last night while we slept in our tents. 


We ate breakfast then packed up and started on the trail. Mark has booked us a room for tonight before we left the hostel. Therefore, we had to hike 12.5 miles to make it back there today. 



The trail took us across the pass and initiated a long rocky and steep climb over Mt. Moriah. However, it did not seem as bad as the Wildcat’s or Carter’s. We got to the top and followed a ridge for a quite a while. We then began a steep rocky descent which finally got us to a winding trail down the mountain side. As we got lower, the elevation change became more gradual. We stopped a couple of times to pick up water.
Trail had us cross the creek that becomes the Rattle River downstream two or three times. After the last crossing, it followed the creek parallel down the mountain before turning away after a mile or so. We passed by the Rattle River Shelter and then walked another two miles on good smooth trail to the NH Rt 2 trailhead. From there, it was a short walk to the hostel. We   checked in, each of us got a nice hot shower then we caught the hostel’s shuttle to Walmart. Each of us bought a whole rotisserie chicken. I also bought a bag of premixed salad. We both ate all our chicken. I also ate all of the salad.

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621578,"During the night, it had rained so we would have to contend with more wet rocks, roots and mud. We ate all but two of our Jimmy Dean Breakfast sandwiches so we each decided to pack one out to have for breakfast tomorrow. 


Our plan was to hike to Gentian Shelter for the night. The next day, we would hike to Full Goose Shelter which is right before the Mahoosic Notch. This is reportedly the hardest mile on the AT and takes several hours to crawl over, around and under a canyon of huge boulders. We wanted to make sure that we had fresh legs before tackling it. 



The trail turns into a road walk that passes by the hostel. So all we had to do is cross the road and walk down another road that took us across a bridge near the Rattle River power generation dam. We then turned up a USFS road and walked to where the trail entered the woods.The climb up Mt. Hayes was fairly gradual. It had several false summits so we got a breather after reaching each one. The trail then took us down to a ridge which led us to our first steep rock climb of the day. There were several rock faces that we had to throw our trekking poles ahead of us before climbing up.
We got to the top and followed the ridge for quite a while. The trail took us past a couple of alpine ponds and bogs before dropping down to Gentian Pond.","Rattle River Hostel

We started on long steep climb up Mt. Success.  The trail pretty much went straight up the mountain. It was rocky and we had to monkey climb several rock faces. We got to the top and found a nice rock bald to take a break. The view was very nice and the cool wind felt good. The terrain of Goose Eye Mountain, with its three peaks,  was like a saw blade with lots of steep ups and downs.  It seemed we were doing more rock climbing than hiking. 


We were exhausted when we arrived at the shelter. I set up my tent and Mark took a place in the shelter. 


Tomorrow, we will tackle the Mahoosuc Notch which is a boulder crawl. Followed by the steep long climb of the Mahoosuc Arm. We got to talk to a couple SOBO’s that advised us to not use our trekking poles. We were going to need both hands.","Gentian Shelter

We then had a steep descent to the Notch. We arrived at the notch and stopped to strap our poles to our packs. We also had a snack and some water before starting our boulder crawl. 

The Mahoosuc Notch was everything that was advertised. It was basically a mile long canyon filled with a jumble of huge boulders. In one place, we had to remove our packs. The boulders were arranged like a tunnel. I crawled under the boulders while Mark pushed the packs to me. I then dragged the packs out from under the boulder while Mark pushed to me.
 The rest of time, we climbed over and around the boulders until we finally cleared the Notch after about two and a half hours. 


We stopped and ate lunch at a stealth campsite. We the started a long steep rock climb up the Mahoosuc Arm. Fortunately, the rock faces were pretty much dry. We had to throw our poles up ahead and then climb to them several times. Trees and roots also helped us get up the mountain. 


We got to the top and had some nice views of the countryside. The trail then dropped down and had us walked across some boards over muddy alpine bogs. It then took us over some bare rock which provided a nice walking surface for two or three hundred yards. 

The trail down was initially steep. Mark walked down while I climbed down some rebar fastened to the rock face. In another area there were wooden blocks fastened to the steep rock surface which we both walked down carefully. Lower down we reached boards with “toe boards” nailed on them to provide traction. Some were two boards wide and some only one board wide. Gradually, the grade improved as we descended.
The trail took us over another alpine bog before we reached more solid ground. The trail then took us by Speck Pond where the shelter was nearby. It was an AMC managed shelter so we used our thru hiker passes to pay five dollars each.","Goose Pond Shelter

Both my wife and my sister-in-law had sent a texts last night indicating we would be getting afternoon thunderstorms with some thatmay be severe. This was confirmed by the AMC caretaker when she posted the weather forecast. 


We got on the trail a little after 7 o’clock. We had a steep climb a little of a mile up Old Speck Mountain. We had a few climbs up rock faces but managed to get up to the top with no mishaps. The trail took us across a ridge the down a long but gradual descent to a trailhead at Grafton Notch. 


We crossed the road and walked back into the woods. The trail took us across a creek then started switchbacking up Bald Pate. We reached Bald Pate Shelter and ate lunch. We refilled our water bottles and got packed up to leave. As we were started walking back to the trail, It started raining.  So we re-evaluated plans and decided to stop for the night. We didn’t want to attempt to climb the rock faces of Bald Pate Mountain during a rain storm. I am told that discretion is the better part of valor. The rain continued on through the afternoon and evening.

Our plan for the day was to hike the 8 miles to East “B” Hill Road and shuttle to Andover, ME for resupply.  We decided to get bunks or a room at Pine Ellis Hiker Hostel since it was within walking distance of the grocery store and restaurant. Andover, is a very small town with few businesses.The trail took us on a climb up the west peak of Bald Pate Mountain. All the rain we had the night before made the rocks slick and the trail muddy in a lot of places. The higher up we went; the steeper it became.  We got near the top and basically had to crawl in a four point stance in several areas. 


We then had to climb down to a low place between the East and West peaks. As expected from our past climbs in this area, we had to cross an alpine bog. They generally have boards that you can walk across but the ones here were either missing or rotted. Mark was crossing one area and slipped in the mud. He sunk up to nearly his waist. I asked him if I needed to help him out but he said that he could get himself out. He was angry to say the least. Fortunately, there was a large puddle of rainwater nearby so he was able to wash himself off. I rinsed and wrung out his socks while he was washing the mud off. 


After Mark got cleaned up as best as he could, we continued on to the East Peak. This was another rock face crawl for the most part but was somewhat easier since the wind and sun dried up a lot of the wetness. We got to the top  and took a break. The views were very good in all directions.  While we were there, we tried calling the hostel to make a reservation. The cell phone reception was poor and I kept getting a “failed call”. However, on the third try, I was able to get through and make our reservation. 


We left there and started down to another gap. It was steep near the top and we had to climb down in several areas. In one place we had to use a rope that was tied to a tree to climb down to a ladder that got us down one particular steep rock face. Somewhere along the way, I had torn a big hole in my tent bag. I will need to buy some duct tape to fix it until I can buy a new bag.  The trail took us past Frye Notch Lean-to where we stopped for lunch. We then had to climb up and over to Little Bald Pate which was a relatively short but steep climb. We got to the top and I called the hostel, as instructed, to arrange for the shuttle pick up at East “B” Hill Road. We then followed the trail almost four miles to the road. It was pretty much a gradual descent with relatively smooth trail. 
We reached the road at 2:30 and our ride was waiting on us. He waited as we stopped by a tent set up by a former AT hiker, “Patriot” and his son doing trail magic. We both got Gatorade and some chips. We thanked him for their kindness. As we got in the SUV, it started raining again. 


By the time we reached the hostel, it rain stopped and the sun came back out. We checked in, showered, washed our clothes and went to the store to checkout supplies. We were a little hungry so we both had two large scoops of ice cream. We then went to Mexican Night Buffett at the Red Hen Restaurant. The food was excellent and we stuffed ourselves.

They had a hiker’s special which was two eggs, two strips of bacon and two thick slices of homemade wheat bread. Both of us had that and a side order of home fries along with coffee. 


We finished eating and went back to the hostel to finish packing up. The shuttle left at 7 o’clock and took us to the trailhead. We got on the trail around 7:30 and started gradually climbing Wyman Mountain. The trail surface was good with only intermittent rocks and a few rooty sections. 


We got over the top and walked a ridge to Hall Mountain Lean - to where we ate lunch. A shelter is called a “Lean-to” in Maine.  We left there and followed the trail down a steep descent to Sawyer Notch. We then began an immediate steeper climb up Moody Mountain.  Fortunately, the trail builders in Maine included switchbacks, rock stairs and rebar judiciously set into rock faces to help us get up the mountain. 


We got to the top, walked about 50 yards and started a long descent to South Arm Road. We got to a large campsite where a 2008 through hiker, “old buzzard”, and a section hiker Max, were doing trail magic. I ate two bowls of stew, four hot dogs, chips, homemade applesauce with whip cream along with a Soft drink and a Shipyard Double IPA. 
Mark ate a couple bowls of stew and chips with a orange flavored soft drink. 


Old Buzzard used to maintain the trail at Old Blue Mountain. He told us that it was a 3000 foot climb with the first 900 feet being very steep. We decided to camp and tackle Old Blue in the morning. 


In talking with Old Buzzard, he said that we were the first hikers from Alabama that he has met. He also talked at length about his project to get families out in nature and unplugged from electronics. He wrote a book entitled “Trail Dreams” which had a copy to show us that explains his philosophy. He also showed us some pictures of a cabin that he is having built to serve two purposes. One is to provide parents with young kids a free place to stay for a week in the woods. The second purpose is the family would function as hosts for AT Through hikers that would stay up donation based  bunkroom upstairs. The hikers could show up in the late afternoon and leave in the morning. The family would then have all day to enjoy the cabin and the woods. He said that he got the idea from the Upper Goose Pond Shelter which we stayed at. It was donation based and a family was the caretaker for the facility.","Pine Ellis Hostel, Andover, ME

We thanked Max for the hospitality and food. We also asked him to thank Old Buzzard for us. We then left the campsite, crossed a creek and a road and started climbing Old Blue Mountain. The trail wound its way up the mountain and got steeper as we got higher on the flank. We got into some steep switchbacks which had rocks arranged as steps at the turns. We also had a couple of rock faces which had rebar “ ladder rungs” which helped us climb up.
We finally got to a point on the mountain where the trail climbed more gradually. We followed it to the top and took a break in a place out of the wind. We then started a descent to a ridge which we followed over to Bemis Mountain. The trail took us up and over the first peak. Then we followed it down to a ridge that led us to the second peak. We were surprised by the ripe blueberries that were beside the trail. We stopped for a break and I picked a bunch to eat. I told Mark that I couldn’t believe the birds and animals were not scarfing them up. We moved on and I would stop briefly as we went down the trail and pick a few to eat.The trail took us down from the peak and the blueberries got fewer as we descended lower towards Bemis Mountain Road. The descent was steep in a few places until we got to a ridge which was more gradual. We got to the road and a local man and his wife were doing trail magic. This was the third day in a row. We had soft drinks and snacks. We thanked them for their kindness and walked down to the tent site near Bemis Stream. We set up our tents, got water from the stream and ate dinner.

Our plan for the day was to hike to Little Swift River Pond Campsite and spend the night. This would make it a short day but we did not see any advantage in getting to Rangeley, ME at 6 o’clock on Sunday Evening. The trail took us across a creek and then up a mountain. This put us on a rolling ridge that took us past a large lake to Sabbath Day Pond Lean-to. We decided to stop there for lunch. The shelter was located about a 100 yards up hill from Sabbath Day Pond which was another sizable lake.

We decided to stay at The Hiker Hut, an off the grid hostel that was only 0.3 mile from the trail. They offered shuttle service into town and would do our laundry for us.  We wanted to get there early enough to catch a mid morning shuttle so that we could pick up Mark’s prescription and go by the grocery store. I also needed to go by the outfitter in town so I could buy a new bag for my tent and a slide release buckle to replace a broken one on my pack. 

The trail continued on a rolling descent to ME 4. We passed by a large lake and saw plenty of signs that moose also used the trail. It appeared from the huge amounts of dung in some areas that it was their favorite place to go poop. We also saw a few hoof tracks from time to time but no live animal. I suppose we make to much noise.
The outdoor shower was located close to a creek. Strategically placed blinds were there for privacy. We were asked to use the Dr. Bronner’s natural soap to wash with. The water was heated as it was being used by a propane heater. It was pretty much instant hot water when I tried it.
We got to the trailhead parking lot and stopped briefly to talk to a couple that were planning to hike a section of the trail. We then crossed the road and started walking to the hostel. We reached the hostel and checked in. The hostel is a collection of four “tiny houses”, a five person bunkhouse, the owner’s slightly larger tiny house, a kitchen house and a gas fired outdoor shower.  There was no electricity and unfortunately had no cell service. It was certainly unique to me but was clean and well kept. 
Afterwards, we caught the shuttle to town.    Rangeley, from what we could see, was not much bigger than Andover. We went by a busy Post Office and Mark picked up his package. We then ate a hamburger and fries at Parkside and Main restaurant. Next, we went to an outfitter where I bought a stuff sack for my tent, a couple of slide buckles for my pack and a set of camp shoes to replace my mismatched pair of crocs. 


We stopped by the Red Onion Restaurant and each of ordered chili cheese fries and ice tea. We charged our electronics while we ate. We still had a while to go before our shuttle was to pick us up so the waitress moved us out to the deck near some electric plugs. She kept our tea glasses filled while we were waiting.


We decided to each order a pizza to take back with us to the hostel. After the pizza was ready, we packed up our stuff and paid our bill. We gave the waitress a nice tip for her hospitality. 


We then walked to the pick up point and waited fir our ride. A fellow stopped by and told us that Steve, the owner of the hostel, was up at the laundromat with a flat tire. He wanted us to walk up there. The laundromat was not far so it didn’t take us long to get there. Steve had just pulled out his lug wrench and started loosening the lug nuts. Mark, seeing an opportunity to work on a car, basically took over changing the tire. Steve thanked him and we got in the van. He drove us to the local grocery store and waited as we bought our food. We then went back to the hostel for the night. 


Steve spends six months each year in India. He became involved in raising money for some kids to give them access to education and medical services. He had been doing this for 22 years.

We got through eating and thanked Steve for his hospitality. We then picked up our packs and walked down the road to the trail head.  The trail took us up gradually to a ridge. There were some steep sections where we had to walk up a rock faces. The rock surface was dry so we could walk up it without slipping. There were also a few other sections where we had to throw our trekking poles up and climb up to them.

The Saddleback Mountain had several false summits which were all above the tree line and extended 3 miles. Blueberry bushes were plentiful and fully laden with ripe berries. I stopped briefly and picked some as we hiked. It was a clear day so 360 degree views were spectacular. We could see lakes and large streams along with small towns. We got to the actual summit and took a break.
We had a steep descent from the top to a ridge that took us over to the “Horn”. We had another steep climb up the exposed rock face.  We walked across the top and encountered another steep descent that required us to drop or trekking poles and actually climb down in several areas. We reached a ridge that took us to Saddleback Junior which we had a steep climb up. The descent started off being steep but soon became more gradual. 



The trail would down a ridge to a large stream that we crossed over by hopping on rocks. We then had a monkey climb up large rocks from the creek until we reached an old logging road.

We were in the woods most of the time so we didn’t have any nice views of the countryside.
We stopped by Spaulding Mountain Lean-to for lunch and to refill our bottles. We then followed the trail along the ridge for a few more miles.

The trail up South Crocker Mountain was steep, rocky and rooty. Last night’s rain did us no favors as it made footing treacherous. We crossed a couple of exposed boulder fields which had some nice views of the surrounding mountains and valleys. The steepness of the terrain and a brisk wind caused us not to linger there. We got near the top and came across some blueberries which I stopped and ate some. We then walked across a ridge where the trail took us down a few hundred feet to a ridge. We followed the trail over to North Crocker Mountain and began a steep climb. Fortunately, the climb was not as long as the one up the South peak. We got to the top and took a break. Although we were over 4,000 feet, we still below the tree line in the alpine zone. This gave us some protection from the wind. However, a cloud blew in and made things damp and uncomfortably cool.
We started down the steep trail still contending with the slick roots, rocks and mud. Both Mark and I slipped down at least once to add to our bruise and scrape collection. The descent became more gradual the farther we went down.  We got to the trailhead and managed to catch a ride to the Hostel of Maine. 



The hostel was a very nice extra clean facility. It was a large “log cabin” style with a bunkroom and several private rooms for rent. They had a complete resupply on food and a few other items. We managed to book the last private room which had its own bathroom and shower.
After checking in and getting the manager’s ok, we spread our tents out to dry on the grass yard. We then took showers and placed our laundry in a bag to be washed.

We scarfed down as much as we could before we had to leave. I had three hard boiled eggs, three cups of coffee, a glass of orange juice, four muffins, a blueberry bagel and a slice of home made bread. Mark ate something similar. 

The shuttle dropped us off at the trail head. We walked along the trail about a mile before we started gradually climbing. The trail wound us up to a ridge which we followed up until we got to what looked like a river of large rocks going up the mountainside. We climbed over and around these until we reached a switchback that took us over to another river of rocks. This seemed to repeat a couple of times before we got to the ridge where Horn Ponds Lean-to was located. We stopped there for lunch. We water source was dry so we couldn’t refill our bottles.
We left there and followed the trail over to the base of South Horn Mountain. We had a steep 800 feet climb to the top. We didn’t walk very far before descending about 600 feet to a ridge. The trail followed the ridge over to Bigelow West Peak. The climb up was steep. We got to the top and were above the tree line. It was cloudy and overcast but the views were impressive. We could see a full 360 degrees. However, we didn’t hang around long because the wind was gusting. 


We walked along the top for a pretty good distance before we had to make a steep knee wearing out descent. The trail dropped down to Bigelow Col Campsite. The water source was way off the trail so we moved on looking for a spring that was supposed to be on the trail. We passed a south bound hiker that told us that he passed it about 0.2 mile back. 



The trail soon took us on another rock climb up the Bigelow Avery Peak. About half way up, we came across the spring. It was clear and cold. We refilled both of our empty bottles plus drank some through our filters.
We got to the summit and found a plaque honoring Myron Avery who helped make the Appalachian Trail a reality. Close by, there was an old rock foundation for a fire tower. The wind was gusty here also but the 360 degree views were outstanding. We could clearly see the ski slopes of Sugarloaf Mountain. They looked like grass rivers running through the woods down the mountain. 

The trail took us on another steep knee killing descent down the mountain. We hiked down about 1800 feet to a to Safford Notch. As we got near the Notch the trail changed to switchbacks which took us around, between and partially under house sized boulders.

Our plan was to hike 14 miles to the Kennebec River where the Appalachian Trail Conservancy provides a free ferry service. The ferry only operates between 9 and 2 o’clock each day so we needed to be there or wait until tomorrow.  It was a clear day and according to the trail guide, the terrain would be favorable.


We started on the trail around a quarter to 7.  The trail surface was rooty in some sections and rocky in others. However, it was relatively smooth dirt most of the way. The terrain was rolling with no large climbs or descents more than 40 feet either way. 

The trail led us past a marker that identified the 1775 encampment of a small American Army under Col. Benedict Arnold. The marker further stated that a portion of the AT between Middle and West Carry Ponds, followed exactly an old portage trail used by the army in their operation against Quebec.

The trail took us along the shore of East Carry Pond which had a small sandy beach and then through the woods by Pierce Pond. We stopped for a brief lunch at Pierce Pond Lean-to that was located on the shore of Pierce Pond. We picked up water from the lake. 
We returned to the trail and followed it around the shore of the large lake until it returned to the woods. We then followed Pierce Pond Stream for a mile or so. The stream had several nice waterfalls and cascades. The trail left the stream and took up and down several hills before crossing Otter Pond Stream which had a nice waterfall next to a shaky three log footbridge.


We then had to climb another hill before descending down to the ferry. A sign warned against fording the river was posted. It stated that the river currents were unpredictable due to an upstream dam. Fortunately, we arrived in time and were the last ones to be taken across. 



The ferry service was a canoe that three people, including the ferryman, and two backpacks could fit. I sat in the front and helped paddle. The ferryman was at the back and Mark, along with our packs were in the middle. We asked about unpredictable currents in the river. The ferryman said that the river is currently flowing about 500 cubic feet per minute. The dam upstream releases water for white water rafting in the afternoon which increases the water flow to about 11,000 cubic feet per minute. That is why the service ends at 2 o’clock.

About five miles in, we reached the side trail for Pleasant Pond Lean-to. We stopped there to eat lunch with a side benefit of getting out of the rain. We finished eating and walked back down the side trail to the AT.  The trail started up Pleasant Pond Mountain. The steep climb up was made more difficult from the rain soaked trail surface and the wet rocks and roots. Mark and I both slipped down a couple of times adding to our scrapes and bruises. Mark also jammed his finger on a fall on a slick exposed rock surface.


We got to the rocky top of the mountain and had not any views due to the rain and clouds. The wind also made it uncomfortably cold when we stopped so we followed the trail back down into the woods. We dropped down a hundred feet or so and then made a short climb up Middle Mountain. It had a rocky top also but was fairly flat in most places. 


We began a long but gradual descent towards Bald Mountain Lean-to.  The trail became more muddy as the day went on. We finally reached the shelter in the late afternoon. We picked up water from a nearby rain swollen creek and each of us cooked some Knorr Pasta Sides for dinner.  


We then changed into dry clothes and wrung out the water in our wet clothes as well as we could before hanging them up.  I was still feeling a chill so I crawled into my sleeping bag to get warm.  Mark followed suit shortly after. It wasn’t long before I was asleep for the night.","Caratunk B&B

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623000,"The rain finally stopped sometime in the early morning. The sky was overcast and the temperature was cool so I dreaded putting on my still wet clothes. The wetness seemed to make them smell worse than usual, especially my socks. As usual Mark’s coffee was a nice luxury to have on a morning like today. 


Our goal was to hike over Moxie Bald Mountain which was about a 1000 feet each way climb and descent to reach Horseshoe Canyon Lean-to. 


Due to the rain, the trail was muddy for the first few miles. We also had plenty of rocks to step over, around and trip on. The climb up the mountain was steep in some areas. A few switchbacks helped us recover somewhat on the way up. We passed under a large slab of rock which generally makes me uncomfortable. Some of these large rocks don’t appear to be held up by much so I don’t stay under them long. At some point, the rain will eventually erode the ground supporting the slab or the ground that supports the rock that supports the slab. I am grateful that it is not today. 


We got the the top but had no views because we were walking in a cloud. The descent was not as steep as the climb. It did take longer to get to the bottom. We stopped for lunch at the Bald Mountain Pond Lean-to. It was located near a nice sized lake. While we were eating a relatively tame chipmunk came up looking for a handout. Mark accidentally dropped a peanut m&m and it snatched it up and ran off with it.  


We finished lunch and walked down the side trail back to the AT. The trail seemed to flatten out somewhat. We reached a wide creek that we were going to have to ford. There was a rope stretched across it but it seemed to be in the wrong place to be effective. While I was carefully evaluating the various factors such as estimated depth, current speed, scanning for possible submerged tripping hazards and so forth, Mark just said “well, hell” and  started tromping across. I dropped my analysis of the hazard and followed suit. Our shoes were still soaked from the prior day’s rain so it wasn’t worth the time to change into our camp/water shoes.


After a while, the trail surface really got pretty smooth with few rocks or roots and no mud. The sun finally came out and made the day more pleasant. The trail paralleled a large creek while climbing up to the shelter. 


We met a hiker from Australia that got bit by a wild animal. He was in his tent when something got up against his tent. He slapped the side of the tent and the animal bit him through the fabric. He thought that it was a “fisher cat”. I asked him if he was going to get it checked out at Monson. He said probably not because he has Australian health insurance and didn’t know if it was good here. I asked him if he should be concerned about rabies. He said that he has had rabies before when got bitten by a wild dog while climbing Mount Ararat in Turkey. I recommended that he still go to the doctor and get evaluated. He thought the he would be fine.","Bald Mountain Lean-to

Acipcoman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623002,"It was overcast when we got on the trail. We wanted to get to Monson as quickly as possible to beat the rain forecast. The trail  terrain pretty much cooperated with us except for a few muddy spots and a few rooty areas. We reached the trailhead parking lot and was offered a ride by a local hiker named Limping Eagle. He took us to Shaw’s Hiker Hostel as we requested  and waited on us as we talked with the owner. Unfortunately, all he had was tent space available. Since it was a high percentage chance of thunderstorms, we declined. Limping Eagle then took us to John Baptist Mission where we were able to secure a couple of spots in an old sauna building. The lady that runs the mission provided us another mattress since one was already in the sauna. She also gave us a kerosene lamp along with a fire extinguisher to take with us. Limping Eagle then took us to a store where we could pickup some lunch. We thanked Limping Eagle for his help. We gave him donation for gas. While we were waiting on our food, it started raining for about 15 minutes. 


After eating lunch, we walked down to the Appalachian Trail Welcome Center where we picked up some information on Mt. Katahdin. We then stopped by the Monson General Store and bought our resupply.  We then walked back to the John Baptist Mission. 


We reloaded our bear canisters and then took showers. The owner of the mission cooked spaghetti and meatballs, green beans, roasted vegetables and garlic bread. I had two helpings and was stuffed.  The rain started up again while we were eating.

The owner cooked a huge breakfast with eggs, biscuits, gravy, roasted potatoes and meatloaf cut into small cubes.  I also drank four cups of coffee. 

The owner’s daughter gave us a lift back to the trailhead. We thanked and gave her some gas money. We then loaded up our packs and headed down the trail. 
As we expected, the trail was muddy and the roots and rocks were wet. We followed the trail up and down hills and past lakes and across creeks. We walked along a few  rock ledges but really didn’t have any noteworthy views.  The path took us past Wilson Falls, a nice large waterfall.  We then followed the creek for a mile or so before climbing up to a ridge.  We walked along the ridge for a while and then dropped back down to Big Wilson Stream. We walked parallel to the large stream until we had to ford it. We took off our boots and put on our camp shoes. We then crossed the creek at a place that was about knee deep. 


After putting back on our boots, we followed the trail up a steep hill to the shelter. A large group of college students were already there set up in tents. According to one of the leaders, they were doing an orientation trip. Their school, the College of the Atlantic, offers outdoor trips   to their freshman students as part of their orientation. It is a small school with about 350 students so they encourage their students to get to know each other with these trips.  They told us that the college offers only one degree, Human Ecology. I am not sure how marketable the degree is but they seemed to be excited and confident.","John Baptist Mission

We ate breakfast and drank the coffee Mark made for us. We then told the college kids good luck with their academic careers and walked to the trail. 


We had a long climb up Barren Mountain It didn’t require us to rock climb until we got near the top. We walked along a ledge and then returned to the woods and slogged through a muddy and rooty trail. We finally reached the summit. It had a small exposed rock top but not much of a view. There was also remnants of a fire tower. It could be climbed but there was no cupola to stand in so we passed going up.  It was a pretty day with little wind so we ate lunch and called our wives since I had cell service.  Trees pretty much blocked our view of the countryside but there was a small opening where I could see a large lake in the distance. I watched a pontoon plane take off from the lake and fly away.


We finished lunch and continued on our way. We followed the trail down to a ridge which took us through a lot of ups and downs. We walked on rotted boards through a bog and several mud holes. 


We climbed a steep rocky path to the summit of Fourth Mountain. Then had a relatively steep descent to a ridge. We followed it over to a couple of steep rocky summits and plenty of mud holes and roots. 

The trail took us over to Columbus Mountain where we had a short steep climb to the top but a relatively gradual descent to the shelter.

The shelter was perched basically on a cliff. We got there just before dark and were exhausted so we did not want to climb down 50 feet to a creek which was the water source for the shelter. We decided to eat bars for dinner. Both of us took spots in the shelter for the night. A different group of students from the College of the Atlantic were set up in tents when we got there.","Wilson Valley Lean-to

However, it was getting daylight and we needed to get going. According to some other hikers, it was forecast to rain. We ate breakfast and Mark’s coffee was especially good this cold morning.


We packed up and climbed down the hill and walked over to the creek. We refilled our water bottles. The trail crossed over the creek and put us on a climb to Chairback Mountain. We got to the exposed rock summit and stopped to put on our pack covers as it started sprinkling. We could see the rain coming in the distance. The path down was a boulder crawl. Fortunately, we made it down to a ridge before the rain set in. 


We followed the ridge making short climbs with longer descents. We crossed bogs and muddy areas on rotted boards, slick rocks and roots. Where we could, we walked around these areas. We passed one of the guys that was in the shelter last night with us. He told us us that he had fell three times this morning and was calling it a hike. There was a gravel road up ahead and he was going home. We wished him well and moved on.Mark told me later that the guy said that he hated the trail and would not hike an inch of it again. 


We crossed the gravel road and followed the trail along a large creek for quite a while and passed a few tentsites, some larger than others. We reached the west branch of the Pleasant River which we had to ford. A ridge runner had her tarp and hammock set up on the bank next to where the AT intersected the river. As we were changing shoes and rolling up our pants, we talked to her. She said that she hiked the AT in 2017. She sets up here as the trail gets a lot of day hikers and section hikers planning to do the Gulf Hagas trail. The trail branches off from the AT and follows a large gorge with a lot of waterfalls and a large stand of old growth pines. She reminds the visitors that there is no camping along the Gulf Hagas trail. She didn’t think that she would see many hikers today since the weather was crappy.


We crossed the cold but less than knee deep stream. We then changed back into our boots. The trail began a gradual climb up Gulf Hagas Mountain. The trail paralleled a large creek up the mountain. The shelter was about halfway up. We crossed the creek and had a short climb to the shelter. I refilled my bottles and picked up extra to use for dinner. 


As usual, hikers flock to the shelter in rainy weather. The shelter holds only six and two section hikers were already there. Mark took a space and I did initially but decided that I didn’t want to be cramped so I decided to set up my tent. 


Unfortunately, I lost my repair sleeve for my tent so I had to duct tape an extra tent peg across the joint. I then went and ate dinner. The hot knorr pasta side hit the spot. I was wet and getting cold so I went to my tent and changed into dry clothes and got into my sleeping bag to warm up. I stayed there the rest of the night.","Chairback Gap Lean-to

However, we wanted to get over White Cap mountain which was the last big one before Mt. Katahdin. My clothes were still damp when I put them on. I dug out my gloves and toboggan and put both on along with my rain jacket. 


I took down my tent and found the repair sleeve that I thought I had lost on one of the other tent poles. In my hurry to set up my tent last night, I forgot that I slipped it on a good pole when packed it up last time. I packed up the rest of my gear then went to eat breakfast. I decided to cook some ramen since it was cold and I wanted something hot along with Mark’s coffee. 


A couple of hikers, H2 No and Fitty Cent, were on the last day of their section hike offered us some of their food and a canister of stove fuel. They did not want to  carry it out. We thanked them and took them up on their offer as our food and fuel was getting low.


We finished packing up and started climb ing up to the top of Gulf Hagas Mountain.  The climb was long and we had to contend with slick rocks, roots and mud from yesterday’s rain. We got to the top and actually had a pretty good trail surface, other than some mud holes.  The trail followed the ridge for a mile or so until we started climbing up Hay Mountain. It was steep but there were enough switchbacks so we could recover somewhat. We reached the summit but really didn’t have any views due to the tree cover.  We took a break to eat a little something to keep our energy levels up. 


Afterwards, the trail took us down a few hundred feet to a gap. We crossed the gap on a mostly muddy trail surface. Some of the mud holes were at least knee deep based on probing with our trekking poles.  

The climb up to White Cap was not too bad. The hike down into the gap kept us near 3000 feet so the ascent to the summit was around 700 to 800 feet with only a few steep rocky places. The summit was a small rocky bald. We had some nice views to the southeast but trees blocked the sight lines to the north and west.
We found a place out of the wind and ate lunch. I had a signal so we called our wives to let them know where we were. 
The trail down started off very rocky as we had cross a boulder field.  The hiking conditions got better after we entered the trees due to some switchbacks which got us down from the elevation.  We stopped at a shelter that was near the bottom and picked up some water.  The trail then took us through some swampy areas and across some creeks. 


We passed another shelter and took a break before crossing a large creek by hopping across rocks. We then passed a large lake which the trail paralleled for a while. We stopped at a spring on the way to Little Boardman Mountain and picked up extra water for camp. Adding two extra liters of water, about 4 - 1/2 pounds seems to make a huge difference when we put our packs back home. We had a steep climb up several hundred feet to the summit. We found tentsite near there and camped for the night.","Carl Newhall Lean-to

We passed by another large lake and crossed a few creeks.  We stopped by Cooper Brook Lean-to and took a break. It was next to a large creek which had a nice waterfall.


We then walked another four miles to a gravel road where we ate lunch.  After crossing a couple of creeks, we hiked on relatively smooth trail to the Antlers Campsite which is on the shore of Jo-Mary Lake.  We set up our tents for the night.

Our plans for the day is to hike six miles to the dock for White House Landing. We were about out of food with two more long hiking days left in the 100 mile wilderness. It would also give us a chance for two hot meals that we could calorie up on.



The trail took us across several creeks and the swampy areas that were generally located nearby. The walk boards over both the creek and swampy areas were slick and half rotted so we had to cross them one at a time. Still it didn’t take long to get to the side trail to the boat dock.
We came across Rebel who was watching a fisher cat up in a tree. It was real high up so all we could see was something moving around. He had some video of the animal as it first climbed the tree. The head of the animal appeared to look like a house cat to me but the body looked out of proportion as it was longer. I found out later that it is a larger relative of the American Marten. 


We watched the animal for a short while then walked to the dock. The owner left a note saying he would pick us up around 2 o’clock +/-.  At around 3:30, he pulled up in a boat. We got in and he took us to the lodge. 


White House Landing was  fairly large complex with several cabins, a bunkhouse, shower house, a lodge and his and her outhouses. We got showers and went and ate a large hamburger with chips. Curley and Rebel also ordered a pizza which they gave us a couple of slices. They also gave us some surplus food they didn’t need when they picked up their resupply box that Curley’s wife mailed here. We still had to buy some bars  and a couple of things.

This would leave us with a 15 mile hike tomorrow to get to Abol Bridge which is the end of the hundred mile wilderness and next to Baxter State Park. The trail condition was muddy with slick roots and rocks which made footing treacherous at times. I added to my bruise collection at least twice due to slippery roots and rocks. The trail followed the shore of a large lake for quite a while. Occasionally, it took us across a coarse sandy beach.  One such beach had two chairs that someone left.  The trail then turned into the woods where we crossed a few small creeks before reaching a shelter .

We finally reached Nesuntabunt Mountain after about 9 miles of hiking. It was steep in places but had a few switchbacks. We got about halfway up the mountain when it started to rain.

Our plan is to hike the 15 miles to the Abol Bridge Campground and Store where we have a couple of bunks in a small cabin reserved. This would put us in position near the kiosk for The Birches Campsite. This area is reserved for north bound through hikers and is first come first served. Unfortunately, there is only twelve spots so you have to be there early to get on the list. Also, you can only stay there one night. 


A couple of other benefits of staying at the Abol Bridge Campground is that besides showers and coin op laundry, we can get hot food and any needed supplies.


We got started around a little after 7 o’clock. The trail was a little drier than yesterday but there were plenty of mud holes that we had to cross or walk around.   The trail was also rooty and rocky in a lot of places which worked on our ankles and feet. Most of these were around the creeks we crossed and where the trail took us along the shore of a large lake. The good thing is that we only had one small mountain to cross over after about 10 miles. The sun was out and there was a nice view of Mt. Katahdin. 


Passing hikers, both NOBO and SOBO, mentioned that it was supposed to rain Saturday. The hike up Katahdin includes a section of exposed rock climbing which rainy weather would make too dangerous to attempt. However, Sunday was projected to be a pretty day. Hopefully, the rain forecast will diminish or be pushed back. Otherwise, we will be looking at a zero day. 


We reached the end of the 100 mile wilderness and came to a road. We followed the white blazes up the road and across the Abol Bridge over the Penobscot River. The campground was on the river next to the bridge. We checked in and went into the restaurant to eat a hamburger and fries. We then bought a few supplies, ate an ice cream cone and went to our cabin. 


After unpacking our bags and getting our laundry together, we went to the restroom building where the shower was located. We finished our showers and took our dirty clothes to the coin op laundry. We started the washer and walked into the store. We ran into Rebel and Curley who were tenting at the campground. They told us that they were going to Zero tomorrow and walk in the rain to The Birches on Saturday. Rebel said that there was a 70% chance of rain Saturday so they were going to summit Sunday. 


Mark and I discussed it and decided that we would walk to the kiosk early Friday morning and see if they had any openings at the Katahdin Stream Campground for Saturday. If so, we were going to The Birches Friday and summit Saturday if the weather holds off. Then if it rains, we can stay at the Katahdin Stream Campground and summit Sunday. 


If there are no openings at Katahdin Stream Campground, we may have to zero at Abol Bridge like Rebel and Curley. We went into the restaurant and had a bowl of beef and barley soup along with a side salad. We then walked back to the cabin for the night.

We got there around 6:30 but there was no one there. We read some of the posted information but the weather forecast was from yesterday. The sign up sheet for the day before only had three names. The instructions for the sheet said that you had to have your packs with you and be on your way into the park. Each hiker had to sign up for him or herself. 


Since today’s sheet was not posted and the ranger was not there, we decided to walk back to Abol Bridge Campground and eat breakfast after we picked up our packs from the cabin. 


We saw Rebel and Curley again at breakfast and discussed our plans. They were still committed to zeroing and try to summit Sunday. We finished eating and wished each other safe travels. The breakfast was an all you can eat continental similar to one at the Holiday Inn but not as good. Still, it beat eating protein bars on the trail. 


We picked our packs and walked back to the kiosk. We got there around 8:30 but the ranger was not there and the sign up sheet was not posted. While we were waiting around, Mark found today’s sign up sheet behind yesterday’s. We moved today’s sheet in front and both of us signed it. We also signed the register for entering the park. We put on our packs and started hiking to the Ranger Station to pay our camping fee and pick up our AT Hiker permit to climb Mt. Katahdin. 


We hiked about 5 miles to the Ranger Station. He was out so we walked around the campground for a little while. We then went back to the station and waited.  Today’s weather forecast was posted which said that the rain for tomorrow would be in the PM hours. We felt that we could start hiking at daylight and at least be past the rock scramble portion on our descent before the rain started. 


A short time later, the Ranger drove up. We got our permit and paid our camping fee. We also discussed our plan to start early and try to beat the rain. He said that we should be able to get up and down before the rain started.

We ate breakfast and each of us had two cups of Mark’s coffee. We put on our backpacks and carried our daypacks in our hand. We walked to the Ranger Station and placed our backpacks on the porch. We used the provided labels to put our names on them.


We then walked to the Katahdin Stream Bridge bypass trailhead and signed the register. The bridge was out so they built a bypass trail so hikers didn’t have to ford the stream.  It was not quite daylight so we used our headlights on the trail. It was rooty and very muddy until we got back to the AT. We then began a steady climb up the mountain. We passed Katahdin Stream Falls which was a nice sized waterfall. We were trying to beat the rain that was supposed to come in this afternoon so I made a mental note to see if I could get a decent picture when we came back down. 

The trail became steeper as we went further up the ridge. There was a spring which turned the trail into a small creek for a good distance. It wasn’t but a couple of inches deep so we walked through it until we passed the spring.
 We climbed a couple “flights” of rock steps which I find easier to climb than slopes. Mainly because I don’t have to turn my right foot sideways and walk like Chester. Mark also prefers the steps. He said that it was easier on his knees. 


We reached a jumble of boulders which required us to scramble up using both hands. This got us up over the tree line where the wind gusts could get to us.  We continued up and reached a plateau covered with blueberries, small brush and mossy areas. The sky was overcast and it was cold so we put on our rain jackets to stay warm. We passed Thoreau Spring, named after Henry David Thoreau  who climbed Mt. Katahdin in 1846. The wind was not so gusty here so we hiked to two miles  across the plateau. 

The wind picked back up as we started climbing to the summit. It also started blowing clouds across the mountain which made it damp and added to the chill. The wind got really strong when we got to the summit. There was a young couple already there behind a big rock which blocked the wind. We got behind the rock hoping that the wind would let up. It didn’t check up at all so we took turns taking our pictures at the sign. They left to go back down but we decided to eat something before we started back.
Another young couple showed up about the time it started raining. We waited for a little while until it slacked up before we left to go back down the mountain. I suppose that we finished the trail the same way we started. We were cold, wet and the wind was trying to blow us away. 
The trip down seemed to take longer than going up. The rocks were wet and we were being cautious. We passed by several other hikers on their way to the summit. We reached the steep boulder section and slowly climbed down. We finally reached the tree line and started getting some protection from the wind gusts and rain.


As we got lower, the rain was pretty much a drizzle. We stopped at Katahdin Stream Falls for a snack. I looked for a close vantage point where I could get a picture but didn’t see one. I was wet and cold so we moved on after we finished our snacks.  By the time we reached the bypass trailhead to sign out, the rain had stopped. We walked back to the Ranger Station and put our packs back together. We then started walking on the road while trying to get a hitch into Millinocket. After about 20 minutes, we caught a ride to Big Moose Lodge and Cabins. The women that picked us up were staying there. We decided to try and get something there as we were wet, cold and hungry rather than try a catch another hitch to Millinocket. As luck would have it, the driver of the car said that she was going to Portland tomorrow and that we could ride with her. We accepted her gracious offer and said that we would buy her gas. She told us to be ready at 7:30. 

The lodge didn’t have any vacancies but they had a cabin available. We took it. We got showers but they did not have laundry. The cabin was nice but the toilet room and the shower room for the cabin was in another building close by. We each took a shower then we went to the lodge bar & grill and got a hamburger and fries. We also got loaded nachos which we shared.
