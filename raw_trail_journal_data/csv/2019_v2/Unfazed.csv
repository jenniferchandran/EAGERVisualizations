Unfazed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606917,"We made another trip out to the lake to practice setting up my Palace tarp. The task of the day was to add the side pull-outs, and , after going deep down the well of YouTube hammocking videos, and once again pouring over The Untimate Hang, I decided that it’s high time I get comfortable tying at least several basic knots, and not be totally dependent on Dutchware, even though I think that Dutch deserves a MacArthur genius award. As for Shug, when I discovered his treasure trove of hammocking /tarping videos, I could have wept for joy. I am so grateful for all of the time and effort and wonderful good, intelligent humor he has put into them.  Today’s real challenge was the frozen ground, and finding a spot that would let me get the stakes deep enough. I was finally able to manage - but it wasn’t beautiful. I just couldn’t get the stakes where I wanted them. In a real situation I would just have to tie them to a log or another tree.  I also experimented with using an Esbit tab with my Firebox Nano, just to see if I can get a cup of coffee out of it in the morning.  After that, we switched to twigs and made a great miso and noodle soup full of my rehydrated veggies. The Nano has really exceeded my expectations, and  and I am looking forward to my own meals on the A T.",,View Entry,"Feb 09, Sat",0

I knit pretty much constantly. I teach it. I think about it , read about it , and hardly know what to do with my hands if I am not making something. I love the smell of wool, the colors and textures of yarn. Many of my projects take months of work and many hours a day to finish . 
I know that it won’t be realistic to take needles and yarn with me, tempted as I am to try. Long distance cycling allowed for packing needles and yarn in my panniers, but there is no such thing as extra space in a backpack . My  final projects are felted mittens with wide cuffs for easy on and easy off in my hiking poles , and a tiny dress and tee shirt for a summer baby .  
Something that serious knitters understand  - a project that involves tens of thousands of stitches takes shape so slowly that you can’t see it grow . One day you realize that progress has been made, and if you keep at it , the day will come when you are finished.  You may have to rip it out, redo it, change the design, adapt ... a lot like hiking. Maybe you aren’t fast . Why do you want to be fast ? It’s a meditation. It takes as long as it takes.",,View Entry,"Feb 09, Sat",0

(This was intended to be the first entry - but I’m still learning how to post here, and I messed up somehow!)
I have a son-in-law who is a college baseball coach. I learned this phrase from him, and it made immediate sense to me.  You make your intentions clear by an action that commits you to further action. 
I left my job as a university lecturer. 
I started my social security. 
I finally left my flip phone behind and bought a smart phone. 
I chose my backpack, hammock, tarp, etc. , afraid to open the packages as they landed on my front porch, for fear that I wouldn’t be able to figure out how to set up and use each new item. 
I made over 150 meals - at least 10 each of 15 different dinners, breakfasts, protein bars and desserts. I dehydrated, figured calorie counts, vacuum packed and scheduled drop boxes.
I obsessed over and fell in love with Dutchware .
I decided to go with a Firebox Nano, because I grew up cooking with wood, and I love the fact that I won’t have to think about buying fuel canisters or finding a place to recycle them. 
I know that many of my choices are outside of the conventional ones, but this is my hike, and these are the things I am comfortable with.

Sometime today I hit the wall . 
Repacking my backpack, tiny decision after tiny decision : Which  pair of socks? Should I bring some extra shock cord ? How about an extra s-biner ? How many instant coffees for the first few days ? Would it be decadent to use rubber bands to help keep the tie outs on my tarp from tangling? Should I  trim the top off this contractor’s bag ? 
And how about this bamboo spoon ? Or this little wooden spoon? I like the wood because it doesn’t scratch the bottom of my non-stick aluminum pot - unlike my titanium spork.... and then I realize that the clock is ticking, the light is fading, and I am frozen in indecision. I flit from task to task and when I return to my pack, the choice has only ballooned in magnitude.  It occurs to me that more psychic energy and life force has been spent ruminating on this subject than was spent on the initial decision to hike the trail.

I never made a last trip to the bank .
I haven’t called the credit card company and told them where I will be .
A pile of library books still needs to be returned, and I never got around to purchasing Guthook, or hand pollinating my Meyer lemon tree, which is blooming madly and futility like an unrequited lover.
And most importantly - 
I did not make a Key lime pie for a dear friend who is going to have surgery while I am on the plane to Georgia. Two bags of limes languish on my kitchen counter. 
This is the thing I feel bad about . As much as I am anxious and scared and bowled over by the magnitude of what is ahead of me , I am so fortunate that I have the health , the time and the resources to be able to attempt it.  I have a great husband who will see me off and mail my resupply , and two wonderful daughters who work hard to drag me yelling and screaming into the modern world . 
I used to live in Chicago, and when I could, I visited the Art Institute . The two paintings that I remember most clearly, the ones that brought me to an intense halt, were Ivan Albright’s “That Which I Should Have Done I Did Not Do”, and “The Song of the Lark”, by Jules Breton .

We got up at 5 to drive to the airport , and for the first time ever ... the car battery was dead !! We don’t use our car every day, we bike and walk wherever we can, and the light over the rear view mirror had been left on .  We were both stunned. Of all times for this to be happening... too early to wake up the neighbors, AAA wasn’t open, and there was no time to arrange a shuttle. Texted my son-in-law, the only other person I know who is up this early, and in ten minutes he had arranged, from the east coast, for an Uber to pull up at our door.  Whew ! Why didn’t I think of that ? I have mentioned before that I need to be dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century.  Case in point. 
I am a firm believer that things come in 3’s, and this day would not disappoint. It is never a good sign when the first words out of the pilot’s mouth are, “this is going to be a very bumpy ride the whole way.”  Although nothing actually hit the ceiling, it wasn’t for lack of trying. I was never happier to be on the ground . 
 We flew over a storm that hit Atlanta just after we landed. Torrential downpour- and when we got on the train to the rent a car terminal - a tornado alert ! The gods of transportation hadn’t finished with me yet.
In spite of my protests and the fact that we reserved the car well in advance, Budget Rent a Car insisted that a racy black sports car with a rumbling tailpipe was our only option.  So... in heavy rain and stop and go traffic, I blatted my way towards Amicalola Falls.
I registered my hike :  number 111 ! The park ranger who talked me through it was such a pro that I hardly had time to process a moment I had imagined for so long had come - and then gone - before I knew it.
The gods of transportation were still not done with me . I tried every shuttle driver I could find, and no one was available for today for a pick up at Springer. We wanted to hike the approach together and then come back to the park for one last night , but that’s not happening. Finally got a shuttle for him tomorrow, so we will hike the approach and say goodbye there. 
It’s a bit of a change, but it will allow me to go through that pack one last time, and take the kid’s advice and download Uber. Sigh.",,View Entry,"Feb 13, Wed",0

I have no reception tonight , so I can’t post anything or let me family know that I made it so far . I set up my tarp and hammock while the weather was still calm. Now the wind is picking up and it might rain. I am pretty snug in my sleeping bag right now, the temperature is going down into the twenties, so I haven’t bothered to undress, just in case I have to hop out in the middle of the night and fix my guy lines . Georgia soil here is sandy, and I am worried that the stakes might pull out in the wind . My feet are stuffed into my wool sweater, which I have turned upside down and am using like a mini sleeping bag. There are a few people camped here tonight , so I am not alone . One other hammock camper, a woman in a tent , and 3 people in the shelter . The site has a bear box, which is welcome, and I put everything including my backpack in it . Every now and then I can hear someone cough, squeak open the bear box , or walk by on their way to the privy. Throughout the night, the steady snore of a stranger assures me that all is well . For someone who does not tolerate noise, I find these sounds to be a comfort.
Today I hiked with Keith to Springer Mountain- then another mile past that to meet his shuttle . I left him in the parking lot where I crossed into the Chattahoochee National Forest , and suddenly found myself in a paradise of rhododendron tunnels, a gorgeous stream , and pine needle path . A couple of miles on I decided to stop at this shelter, knowing that my first time setting up could take awhile . I was able to do it without too many dumb mistakes, filter water and use my twig stove to make miso soup with noodles and veggies- all was going swimmingly until I dumped my rehydrated veggies into my boiling water and the splash put out my stove ! Oh well, it was almost done anyway, so I called it a success and skipped my tea .
It’s only 7:30, but everyone is in bed. I really wish I could let my family know that I am ok.","Springer Mountain

Unfazed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607125,"I have breakfast in the privy.
Hawk Mountain campsite 
Short day - it never stopped raining, and after a late start, I decided to stop here . I felt like I was hiking in the mist all day, and I didn’t want to arrive at the next shelter after an additional 8 miles of cloud walking. It was slow going - muddy wet leaves - at times awesomely beautiful, at times a miserable slog, climbing or descending on slippery wet rocks . 
I thought that others might stop here as well, but so far I am alone in more rain, and this time it is a convincing rain - nothing to do but hole up in my hammock and hope that it stops . 
Next day: when I wrote the above, it was still early in the evening. The rain became torrential and lasted until around 6 a.m. It was one of the worst nights of my life. I never slept, just stayed on alert, wanting to get up at sunrise and leave . But the rain got worse, and at 6 I made plans to move my tarp and hammock into the privy if I had to stay another day. Not because I was getting wet - I stayed dry the whole time . (Thank you Palace tarp. Thank you to all the YouTube videos that taught me how to set it up - especially Shug!) I planned to move to the privy because I could hear an animal prowling around, and I wasn’t liking it . I felt that there was something “ off” , even eerie about the place. It seemed entirely possible that I would be stranded there another day, and l reasoned that the biggest mistake I could make would be to act out of my emotions, (not wanting to be there), and leave in a downpour, hike down the mountain and slip and fall. 
I took a dispassionate inventory: Plenty of  food. No danger of hypothermia as long as I kept my gear dry. I could wait for a lull and move my stuff bit by bit. I would have to go a long way to the bear box to retrieve my backpack. I had camped near one , only to discover that it was broken and would not close, but I had already set my tarp up, so i used a box a lot farther down the hill.
Assessing the situation, I knew that I would be safer staying, even if I didn’t want to. Besides, taking down the tarp and hammock with quilts in a downpour would be impossible.
Waiting for light to begin my move, I decided to start by retrieving my backpack and bringing it back to the privy. I realized I had had no breakfast OR dinner the day before - probably anxiety about the weather - so I would start by using a solid  fuel tablet in my stove to boil water, make bulletproof coffee, and eat a bowl of my homemade granola with Nido. 
... and so I did.
The joyous ending is that around 7:00 the rain stopped ! The mist moved in. The owls hooted. I ate on the floor of the privy. Then I took down my tarp, packed everything up and made a beeline out of there into a forest shrouded in mist.","Stover Creek

The total distance as of today’s finish should be 15.7 ( not counting the 8.8 approach trail) miles, but I haven’t figured out how to edit this, and I will just press on and try and catch up on the posts first. 
After my breakfast in the privy, I broke down my camp, and got back on the trail. The mist was thick , walking in a cloud, but at some point the sun peeked out , and I sat on a rock in the sun for lunch and spread everything out to dry . 
At Gooch Mountain Shelter I ran into folks I hadn’t seen since Stover Creek, and happily set up for the night , once again to the sweet sound of strangers snoring .

Unfazed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607138,"Got up today in the cold rain, and as I was packing up, it became obvious that I would be one of the last to leave.  Most of the other hikers sleep in the shelters or tents that are a lot faster to pack up. One young man lingered, and said, “I will walk out with you”.  He has been suffering from knee pain, and stayed with me the whole day - I fed him Advil and he kept me good company, which I was so grateful for. The rain and the cold never broke, they got worse as the day went on, turning to sleet at higher elevations. I put on every piece of cold weather gear that I had, including my felted mittens. 
We passed Lance creek, ran into Elmer, who had left before we did. She was waiting in the cold to see if anyone was going to stop there, but no one was there, and it was not an inviting stop in the worsening weather, so we all went on to Woody Hole Shelter, by then starting to get chilled and wet. The turn off for the shelter is an additional .4 miles, which seemed endless at that point. 
The winds became gale force, the night alternating between sleet and pounding rain. It was so fierce that I could not contemplate setting up the tarp, and the great people there offered to make room for me in between them, loaning me a poncho to stop the cold wind coming through the cracks underneath. One woman loaned me the back pad from her pack as a cushion, and I added my own, put my under quilt down, and was so very happy to be among people.
No one slept. We put up plastic sheets to block the wind, that seriously ( as the woman in the next room is saying ) were hurricane force. Downright scary. Brutal cold.  The group all together is what made it  endurable. 
I am not a person who seeks out the company of others, enjoys parties, or social interactions. Hiking the A T might represent being alone with yourself and your thoughts, but in fact, it’s the people that make it possible. Great people who share what they have with each other and look out for each other . People who , in one’s everyday life, would not be one’s natural cohort.  I am so grateful for their company.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Unfazed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607143,"When I said it was brutally cold last night, I wasn’t kidding. Our little group left Woody Hole and went over and down Blood Mountain into Neel Gap. My jacket had gotten fairly soaked the day before, and as I was sitting up at daylight, discussing the mouse that ran over my face during the night, I realized that my jacket was still wet ! Yikes! Rookie mistake ! I stuffed it in my bag with me to dry it out a bit, and I must say, “hats off to Patagonia”, my nano puff is going through hell and working out.  I slept with every warm bit of clothing I had on - not nearly as warmly as I would have in the hammock, which is sooooo cozy, but last night was not a night to be under any trees. 
I kept moving, just to keep warm, and coming out finally onto the the rocky summit of Blood Mountain I experienced what I call a “peak moment” - one of those times when life slips you a sublime gift of beauty or pleasure when you aren’t looking for it . The sun, the 360 degree views, the rocky magnificence of it - no wonder the Cherokee people believed it to be the home of deities. I was languishing in my reverie as I picked my way down the sheer slabs of wet rock, when I realized that I hadn’t seen any white blazes in awhile... hmmm... I had just slid down a steep, wet rock face and had no appetite for going back to the top . I muscled my pack onto a rock so I could take it off and check Guthook , and out fell my titanium cup, bouncing down the mountain. Second rookie mistake of the day. I should have attached it with a carabiner.. 
I had to reroute back to the trail, but no way I was climbing back up what I had basically justslid down on my butt. I knew the trail was to the east, so I got off the rocks and cut through the woods until I hit the trail , and finally saw my next white blaze. 
Whew! I think this counts as my third rookie mistake- getting so entranced by my surroundings that I forget to look for the white blaze . 
Shortly afterwards my trail friends caught up with me. Turns out they had made the same mistake, they just realized it sooner than I did.  We all made it into Neel Gap, and spent the afternoon drying out, taking a shower and enjoying our 20 dollar bunkhouse.  This evening a woman stumbled in on the verge of hypothermia - she had just made it down Blood Mountain- soaked, freezing, deeply chilled and nauseous. She hiked so far in wet socks that she lost a toenail ! She said that last night and coming over Blood Mountain was worse than anything she had experienced on the Colorado Trail or PCT.  She can barely walk right now. 
I hope she recovers, she says she will stay here and rest for a day or two. Elmer, the other woman in our little group, has also had enough and is leaving the trail tomorrow.","Woody Hole Shelter

Unfazed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607201,"I throw grandma’s piano out of the Conestoga wagon.
I used to read about the days of the great wagon trains across the west, and think, “How could they throw out the family silver, the furniture, the china, the piano... why couldn’t they just tough it out ?” 
Now I understand. Had I a piano this morning, or a set of family silver, I would have gladly tossed it overboard. What I did have was half a jar of peanut butter, a bag of noodles, a pair of gloves that no longer deserved to live, an insert and windscreen for my stove , and three stale pitas . They all got left behind . It was going to be a hard day.
We woke up to sleet and ice, with the original plan of 11 miles to Low Gap Shelter. Elmer left the trail, got picked up by her family. The late arrival from yesterday was in pain, and took a zero today ( zero = no miles hiked). 
I got off first. Why? Because the sound of mice chomping away, punctuated by the scampering of their scheming little feet, kept me on edge all night , so I finally threw in the towel, put on my headlamp, and tried to get dressed in the dark. 
The weather never got better . I realize that this hardly comes as news to anyone else on the trail, but hey! Gimme a break! It went from sleet to more sleet to ice covered everything at the tops of climbs . Add to this the wind at the gaps that froze anything that hadn’t already been broken off and left in a debris field of eerie destruction, and then up the ante to thunder and lightning plus a frozen cloud of no visibility on the mountainsides. Awesome.
I was only able to take one photo because I couldn’t stop for fear of getting even more chilled. My fingers were getting numb, zippers no longer cooperating. Sadly, the photo doesn’t reflect the fact that everything was covered in ice - rattling, brittle.  The ice rain  eventually soaked me through and when the thunder and lightning joined in above Hogpen Gap, I realized that this was not going to get better before it got worse . 
Coming down into the highway through Hogpen Gap, everything was clouded in fog . I couldn’t see to cross the road, it was so foggy. At this point I knew I had to get indoors somewhere, and I didn’t care where .  There is a sort of a wayside at the gap, and I walked along it, planning to hitchhike in any direction, as long as I could get picked up. I saw a figure in the mist - turned out to be another hiker - he said he had been trying to get a ride for an hour but only 3 cars had passed ! Not a surprise. Visibility zero . Freezing mist and sleet .  Who in their right mind would be on the road ? BUT.... in just one minute a car came by on the other side of the road ! I waved. They turned around and pulled into the wayside. God bless them. I explained that I just needed a ride to any place with a motel, and they said they were going to Helen, Georgia and could give me a ride . The other hiked declined the offer - not sure what he had in mind - his phone wasn’t working, he said he was from the Czech Republic and didn’t know the area, and he didn’t seem prepared for the weather.... frankly, I think he was taken by surprise by the race of the people who picked me up - his problem.
Heaven smiled on me.  I climbed into a toasty , heated SUV with a family of 4, driven by a fireman from Atlanta, his chemistry teacher wife, and their two little girls.  Over the sound of Sponge Bob Square Pants playing on the seat back video screens, they said that they were off for a school break vacation (!) to Helen, Georgia, and off we crawled through the mist . We drove 20 miles and never passed another car on the road. 
I got a room, finally warmed up, and will probably take a zero here tomorrow. I found a shuttle back to Hogpen Gap for the day after tomorrow. The weather is still looking like a mess until then, when it at least should warm up a bit. For now I am ( to quote hikers from years past) safe, warm and dry, and eternally grateful to the family who picked up a stranger at Hogpen Gap.","Neel Gap

Unfazed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607222,"I watch the Chattahoochee River rise.
I thought I should take time out from watching the rain on my zero to thank everyone who has left such encouraging comments in my guest book. It means a lot, and it really lifts my spirits. 
Angie from Georgia - thanks for affirming my decision to get off for a day or so . Much of the country is experiencing this weather in one form or another, and here it is taking the form of rain, more rain, flash flooding, ice rime higher up, and on and on.  We all need a breather.
I have literally been watching the river rise all day here in Helen. I am thinking about moving to Hiawasee tomorrow. I hope to meet up with my trail friends there. If the weather allows, I can slack pack (have the shuttle take the bulk of my pack weight) there . If not, I can jump to Hiawasee and slack pack back here. 
I also wanted to answer Rich’s question about why I slept in the cold shelter at Woody Hole instead of in my hammock. 
Good question . 
First of all, I declare for now and forever that my tarp, hammock, and sleeping quilt set up is the coziest and most comfortable sleep I could have . I have  a Warbonnet Blackbird hammock, Palace tarp, Wooki under quilt, and a zero degree top quilt by Enlightened Equipment. I love this set up, and I look forward to using it as often as possible. 
However, when the winds are intense, the sleet is pelting down, your hands are wet and frozen the second you expose them, and you are already drenched from hiking all day in the freezing rain - and then the thunderstorms start - it’s just too much to set up if you can help it, or at least it was for me.  It’s a trick to keep everything dry while the tarp goes up - and that includes yourself . Even with all of my Dutch bling,  I couldn’t deal. That night it was torrential rain, the trees were straining, lots of debris, branches, etc. flying around, hail, lightning - you name it, we had it. 
At Hawk Mountain campsite I had set up as the rain was just starting and it was fierce all night, but my set up had no problem.  The difference at Woody Hole was that the storm was already gaining force when I got there and continued to  build all night. Tornado weather, and no one slept a wink.

Waiting out the weather for the past few days has left me with too much time to fill with doubts about this whole undertaking. I moved into Hiawasee, parked myself at every hiker hangout I could locate, and yet I failed to run into a single other hiker. 
This morning everything changed. A little voice in my head told me , “ go down to the lobby and get another cup of coffee.” 
I really had no desire for more coffee - shuttle was coming to pick me up, and I was packed and ready to go - one more move, this time to a well known hiker hostel .  Then the thought, “pay attention to the voice in your head .” 
So down to the lobby I went, and there they were ! I introduced myself, sat down, and discovered a wonderful group of experienced (PCT and multiple A T ) hikers , my age, men and women.  They started the same day I did, and have been waiting out the weather for the past several days as well. They knew just how I have been feeling - and reassured me immediately that staying put is the smart move right now. I can’t express what a difference meeting Zelda , Tarzan and Montana has made.  My spirits have lifted,  and I am looking forward to getting back on the trail Sunday, when the weather should improve.  
The lesson I learned from them is this: When they saw the weather forecast they made the decision to book themselves into a hotel and surrender to the weather for the next few days, rather than ( as I did) agonize over every lost day, rebook day by day, have to change hotels because they were full one day and not the next, and not be able to let go of the tension of constantly deciding and redeciding what to do .

Got picked up at Mull’s Inn, where once again I was the only resident (except for the stinkbug infestation and whatever critters were climbing inside the wall at night ). Still, being warm and dry was a plus - I could hear the rain pounding all night, and waited in the dark for sunrise and my shuttle ( two thumbs up for Joyce !!!) . She dropped me off at Dick’s Creek Gap, which means that with the bad weather I ended up skipping from Hogpen Gap to Dick’s Creek Gap. I didn’t want to backtrack because I wanted to stay in touch with a trail family, and thought that I’d be happier setting off with others .
As is turned out, I didn’t see anyone until 
the last 2 miles. 
Not easy. The wind was ferocious, especially once I started the climb out of Bly Gap. I was happy to run into a number of hikers that I haven’t seen since the first night out - all here in the shelter . It’s going to be a cold night, but I should be l ok in my hammock . 
Later : 
That night was indeed the coldest yet, and very very windy. My water was frozen in the morning, and at least one of the guys in the shelter had his Sawyer water filter freeze . I stored mine in between the hammock and under quilt - a good nighttime way to keep stuff dry and off the ground.  Zelda and Tarzan and their sweet dog were there - I think it was a hard night for everyone .","Dick’s Creek Gap

Packed up as quickly as my frozen fingers would allow, and followed my new trail family out . Four guys - mostly ex military - but people that I saw on my first day out. 
I hiked by myself , they are all faster than I am, but every now and then I changed places with Sleprock, a retired factory worker from Ohio. It’s nice to know that someone is behind you - almost all of the day is solitary, and often in the clouds and mist. 
Today was one of the only days without rain or howling winds. I ended up happily with my new family at Carter Gap shelter, and was able to cook my dinner over the fire, which is perfect for me and saves fuel. Still haven’t developed hiker hunger, but I am appreciating my homemade food more and more. 
I have made a few mistakes setting up my hammock - nothing major, just errors in judging how far apart and how big the trees should be - small trunks mean I can’t tighten the whoopie slings enough, and I am sure there is a fix for that .

Today I crossed over Albert Mountain, and made it to Rock Gap shelter. Again, hiking alone, but caught up to Sleprock just as the climb got brutal - more like rock climbing, the white blazes painted on the rocks, and for me It was the most difficult day ( physically) yet. But no way out but up and keep moving, so I tried to just check my fears at the door and followed Sleprock up the rocks. I admit that I had absolutely no inclination to climb the fire tower at the top.  
For the past 2 days the trail has snaked through big storm blow downs, some big trees blocking the trail .  I have been on my hands and knees, had to take the pack off to get through, hit my head on a tree trunk over the trail, and beat through the woods because there was no other way around . 
Mr. Rogers had a song , “I Like to be Told”, and the words to it included the phrase, “ I like to be told when it’s going to hurt.” This song ran through my head all day, and I still can’t decide how much I want to know beforehand about how hard a given day will be. On the one hand, fear saps your energy, and on the other, it might help you to be prepared- especially in terms of respect for the weather.  Some hikers love to announce how hard a climb will be the night before, revisit it in the morning, and then regale you with every scary tale they have ever heard about that section . 
I thought a lot today about how much I want to know ahead of time , and how to manage the fear and anxiety that comes with knowledge. If anyone has any tips about this, please let me know. There has to be a happy medium between horror stories and blissful ignorance.","Carter Gap Shelter

Unfazed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607513,"After a rainy night at Rock Gap shelter, we hiked out in two groups - timed to catch a shuttle to a hostel in Franklin, NC.  SlepRock and I left a little later, planning to meet the second shuttle run. I put on all of my rain gear, and hiked out to Winding Stair Gap where I waited for SlepRock. It didn’t take us as long as we had allowed, so we paced around, getting chilled - happy to see the shuttle drive up. Everyone in our little band seemed in good spirits - happy to shower and get their laundry done - some went into town, resupplied, etc. etc. The original plan had been to zero in Franklin the next day, so no one was in a rush. 
We all walked over to the Lazy Hiker Brewery that evening and sat outside by the fire. In a sort of a final burst of good energy, we even joined the Brewery’s trivia game and WON! That was our best moment - walking back to the hostel, the talk was of how we had “bonded “, how the next day’s plan was to sleep in, but NOT zero, go out to a big breakfast, and then shuttle back to Winding Stair Gap and hike to the closest shelter and see how we felt. This was a perfect plan for me, and it was the plan that was in place when I went to my room. 
Then, as if a strange wind blew through,  upending everything, it all changed during the night. One of the group announced that he was leaving. He felt hurt (and perhaps rightfully so) that the group had chosen to plow over the hiking plan that he had worked out based on his experience having hiked the trail before.   The owner of the hostel sent a message to me (that turned out to be an outright lie) that everyone had decided to zero tomorrow.. At the same time he told me that they WEREN’T leaving, the owner was making plans to take those same people out to an early breakfast so that they COULD leave!  Very strange. I texted the guys whose numbers I had, but never got a reply. At some point during the night I realized that the only way I could stick with the group was to get up at 5, pack and get ready, and then wait and see which of the 3 options was on for the day. Having to remain in a constant state of anxiety and readiness “just in case” was not what I wanted.  I realized that I had left too early, the weather has taken a huge toll on everyone that I’ve met - most of whom are now off the trail - and because it was so early, I virtually never met up with, or hiked with anyone else during the day.  Hiking alone day after day in the rain and sleet and waking up to more rain was just too draining for me. Sometime during the night at the hostel I decided to leave the trail for now. 
By the end of the next day, half of the group had split and gone home.  I rented a car and drove back home. Strangely, on my way out of North Carolina, I stopped at the NOC to pick up a resupply that was waiting for me there, and who did I see but the owner of the hostel who had lied to me about the group’s plans for the next day! AGAIN he passed on misinformation about a “message” from one of the group that I had just spoken to myself, so I knew enough to ignore it and just keep moving. So strange. 
I need to thank everyone who has been so positive and supportive and say that I am so grateful for all of your comments. I will definitely return to the trail, but for now I am regrouping, figuring out what lessons I have learned, and mostly just being grateful that I was able to have such warm support from family and friends both old and new.","Rock Gap Shelter

Unfazed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610998,"I am back in Franklin, N C - picking up where I left off . I had a difficult time here a few weeks ago , when the little bit of trail  family I was hiking with suddenly disintegrated over night .  At the same time, the weather was day after day of unrelenting rain, wind, sleet and ice storms . To top off the memories, I had the longest night of my life, alone in a storm at Hawk Mountain campground.  


It’s a fact that coming back has not been easy.  Anxiety, apprehension, and fear all jostling for mental real estate . When I decided to come back, I was tempted to skip ahead and  intersect Sleprock, the sole survivor of my trail friends, and someone who hiked at my speed. But I felt like I had unfinished business in Franklin, and I wanted to pick up where I left off and override the negative memories. 


After an insanely turbulent flight into Asheville, where, in the pilot’s own words, the storm was “ sitting right over the runway”, ( the entire trip began with a gate announcement in KC that we should get a drink and use the bathroom on the ground because the flight was going to be too “bumpy” to offer service) , I met my shuttle driver, who said “it’s raining too hard, I’ll pull the car around “ and proceeded to pull up in a stretch limo!! Certainly I never expected that ! I was expecting a van share with other riders . Must be the only car he has ! I was embarrassed to get in it, but hey! I had survived the flight, it was pouring rain, and it didn’t seem the time to hit him with a lecture on how I’d rather not have this use of the earth’s finite resources chalked up in my column. This hiking thing has a way of upending and /or suspending all “ normals”.


Traffic was at a near standstill for over an hour on the way to Franklin, but I had no rush to be anywhere, I watched Eastern Connecticut State baseball win a doubleheader on my phone, and by the time we got to my B and B the rain had stopped and I saw the sun! It was a brief sighting, and I have since met a lot of hikers who are here waiting for this storm system to move on. 
I learned a new word today. After checking in, I needed to get a new fuel canister and something to eat. My hosts at Franklin Terrace kindly gave me a ride in a downpour to the Rathskeller. Without missing a beat, the owner identified me as a thru-hiker, and offered to pick me up and bring me back to the trail on Easter morning! Such unhesitating generosity to a total stranger left me in tears.
The new word is “labile”.(A word, incidentally, that autocorrect will NOT allow you to type.) When I told my daughter, she said , “ you must be emotionally labile right now.”  I seems to be a term physicians use to mean “emotions on the surface” or “volatile”. Mighty Blue mentions in his podcasts how  his emotions are heightened by this experience, and I admire his honesty. It’s definitely true that thru-hiking reduces things to essentials. A small kindness can have great impact, and nothing seems like coincidence. I am still pondering what what an unexpected pickup by a stretch limo on my way back to the trail means .","Franklin, North Carolina

The bunkhouses are across the river, across the railroad tracks, and up a steep little hill - a bit of a hike if you are doing laundry and washing everything you own and wearing nothing but a rain skirt and an undershirt as you stroll nonchalantly by probably a couple of hundred people sunning themselves, kayaking, eating at the restaurant and bar ... At least that was my plan until I popped into the store to get change for the washing machine and asked the woman working there if they had loaner clothes. Some places do, but I knew that a big operation like this wouldn’t... Still, why not ask?And then, the busiest woman in the place - who was juggling checking in hikers, working the cash register , explaining the layout on maps, answering the phone and making reservations said , “I have some of mine in my car that I will loan you.”In disbelief that this was actually happening, I followed her out to employee parking as she explained that she is homeless and living out of her car. She has this high season job at the NOC that gives her a place for the season, but everything she owns is in that car . This generous angel started on evening wear, pulling out box after box and holding up a peach colored slinky dress with a gold ring neck that she wanted me to try. For a moment I almost took her up on it . Cracks were appearing in reality anyway , so why not see how far this would take me? Imagine strolling around the NOC in a slinky dress, gold rings clanging, as I juggled my back pack, hiking poles, and carried my hiking boots . That was an image almost too good to pass up .In the end, I talked her down from evening wear and she took out her collection of vintage rock concert tee shirts. I settled on a Led Zeppelin tee shirt and stretch pants . This was a woman with an intense and painful history ,and I listened to her story in a concentrated few minutes while we dug through cardboard boxes in the back of her car, and later when she helped me with a broken washing machine . (Heads up to anyone planning on doing laundry at the NOC , only 2 out of 5 machines are working!)When I went back to thank her and return her clothes she said, “pay it forward.”I have already had so many small acts of kindness and generosity this time around, but hers is truly special.","Wesser Bald Shelter

Unfazed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611405,"I speak in defense of snakesThe title of this entry will come as a shock to my family. I am well known for my fear of snakes , and I am hyper alert when I am in their territory- e.g, in tall grass, in the garden, the woodpile, turning over a rock, etc .So before this hike I read up on the snakes I could expect to encounter, and hoped that somehow I might be the exception and maybe I’d be the one person who didn’t run into the common black snake that loves to sun itself across the trail in the Appalachians.Well, that didn’t take long . Yesterday I was so busy looking for new wildflowers that I almost landed right on a black snake stretched alongside the trail. He was heading back into his/her hole before I could get a photo, but it was easily 4 feet long .Today, however, I was stopped at a spring on the side of a mountain, enjoying my lunch, refilling my water bottles, when a pair of hikers showed up in full flush of snake sighting. “ Man, did you see that snake - he must have been 4 feet long! “I offered my opinion that it was probably just a black snake, that they are common here, and famous for not moving , but harmless . Then he said , “ I hit it with a rock! It could be poisonous!”“What color was it?” He replied that he didn’t know . I wanted to ask him how he could know how long it was and have time to hit it with a rock and still have no idea what color it was. This is not a complicated question. It’s dark brown or black. Things degenerated after that . I had to say, “ well, sounds like a black snake, just think of them as friendly black snakes and it won’t be so bad next time.” But then he raised his voice and declared , “ they are all my enemies! That’s how I avoid being poisoned!”Sigh. “They are all my enemies.” Sorry to say that my resolve to accept all types of people on the trail is not going to stretch that far. Are all dogs your enemies? All people? Either of these is far more likely to attack you on the trail than a snake is.Since beginning this journey I have made friends with a woman who wears a confederate flag sewn on her jacket, with a young man who believes the earth is flat, with a group of former military guys who spent every night talking munitions, and I am sure that many of these people are on the opposite end of the political spectrum from me. But I just can’t make room for someone who looks at a snake in its natural habitat and declares it to be the enemy. I wanted to say, “we are the intruders here, this is their home, we are just passing through.” Instead I packed up and moved on.I would be perfectly happy if I never see another snake - poisonous or not - but I don’t want to live in a world where they no longer exist in their natural habitat.","NOC

Coming down into Stecoah Gap, The hillsides were a bank of flowers that I had never seen before, but that I knew had to be some sort of trillium. I knew that Stecoah had a parking lot and picnic tables, and (the most valuable attribute of all) a trash can , but I made a special wish that I would find someone with a wildflower guide .Naturally, in the way that the trail DOES provide, there was a woman sitting at the picnic table pouring over a bird book . She had just been out birdwatching and was busily updating her life list. I sat down and said, “what I really need is a wildflower book.” And of course she fetched me one from her car ! Wish granted. I found my yellow trillium ( Trillium luteum), and crossed the road back to the trail.People who pay attention to these things know that the brutal climb called Jacob’s Ladder begins shortly thereafter, but I was blissfully unaware of what was about to happen - a climb of 600 feet in just .6 miles. Many people have written about its difficulty, and I agree with each and every one of them. I survived, that’s all I can say.At the base of the climb, I was still in a state of wonder . I saw a flowering bush that was so beautiful I could only whisper “ thank you” , and simultaneously, hopping about on the other side of the trail were the orioles !It was like I was being whirled around in some sort of beauty vortex where “once in a lifetime” sightings were being thrown at me faster than I could absorb them.Just in case I had any lingering doubts about the trail providing, as I was staggering and dragging myself up Jacob’s Ladder, I met a couple staring intensely into the woods. I asked them what was happening, thinking maybe it was a bear or a snake in a tree, but they replied, “it’s just so beautiful.”Indeed it was. I mentioned my wildflower photo project, and, why should I be surprised to find that she was a botanist - of course she was - a legitimate real life professional botanist - and knew every name of every flower I had photographed. I can’t remember everything she told me, but the bush that made me whisper “thanks” is the Bubby Bush, or Carolina Allspice. Amazing flowers of deep deep burgundy.I will admit that I used to give a silent cynical groan when I heard someone say, “ the trail provides.” It struck me as a hollow cliche.

A 13 mile day from Ice Water Spring Shelter to Tri-Corner Knob Shelter . Magnificent views, in my opinion the best day in the Smokies. 
A few days ago I was trading places on the trail with a father and son out for an overnight hike. They were a picture perfect pair, like a Hallmark movie version of a naive, fresh faced father who was determined to give his son this important experience.  Around lunchtime, I came around a bend, and there they were: father with a big frying pan, trying to light his stove with matches that kept blowing out, and very happy to see me. “Join us for lunch! Just the person we need! Do you know how many ounces are in a cup?”Here is where the story takes a dark turn, because I naturally responded, “ think about it - a cup of lead would weigh more than a cup of water- right?

When they were young, and I wanted to make a point or reinforce a principle , they would say, “ is this going to be a “big L” or a “little L ” And by “L” they meant lecture .

2:  Our bikes aren’t broken.
3:  We have a place to sleep tonight .

I think the spot is listed as “road bed” on AWOL.

I think those Fritos helped save the day. I had to shove off before I got chilled, but the mood lifting effect of that trail magic in that most unlikely of spots at such a time is something I will never forget .... thank you.","Groundhog Creek Shelter

The climbs were hard enough, and there were some lovely sections of leaf litter soft walking, but the angle of the long long downhill into Hot Springs began to slow me down and by the time I got here I was hobbling along barely able to walk . 


Well, this is interesting... it’s my left foot that is swollen and sore AND my first blister, a small one, on my right heel. 
I staggered downtown to pick up my resupply and ate a great dinner, but on the way back uphill I must have looked like a drunkard as I swayed and zig zagged my way back . 


I need to rest it, that’s for sure. I will be looking for ice first thing in the morning.","Walnut Mountain Shelter

Unpacked my pack and spread everything out and dried and cleaned it. Advil. More ice. Gorged myself on electronic contact with family and friends. Skipped lunch because I didn’t want to walk downtown. Talked to a hiker and her husband who said that she cried on the long downhill yesterday. I told her that I would have cried, but there was no one to hear me. 


I decided to take a second day off to rest my foot. As it is, I can barely walk on it, so I really have no choice. The masseuse gave me some Epsom salts for it, and now it’s on ice again. 


Day two: ice and Advil and more rest . I will take off tomorrow morning, as my foot is improving. The Laughing Heart Lodge has been wonderful to me - supplied me with ice and Epsom salts and kindness.","Hot Springs

Unfazed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613112,"When I was growing up, my family lived farther away from our school than any other family. We were the first to be picked up when it was still dark, and the last to be dropped off. We spent hours every day riding the bus as it worked its way down every rural dirt road.  In the morning, I sat in the dark, waiting impatiently for it to be light enough to read, and in the afternoon, I read my way home, and marked the time with Jolly Ranchers.  Through painstaking scientific research I had determined that Jolly Ranchers lasted longer than any other candy.  At two cents apiece, a few Jolly Ranchers, carefully portioned out, would see me most of the way home and allow me to withdraw into my books with a satisfied sigh.


Even at the low low rate of two cents apiece, the money had to come from somewhere. That meant stealing it from my father’s dresser. Pennies and nickels only - anything larger seemed felonous. This also meant learning to ration - money AND candy.  


My school lunch inhaled, I would first run/walk to the public library, which I visited every day, and which to me, represented all things good and right. With 20 minutes left in lunch hour, I would dash to the Ben Franklin store, buy my Jolly Ranchers, and hot foot it back to school. 


Now, on the trail, I have returned to Jolly Ranchers as a technique for marking time. Cycling in the Alps I will often resort to hard candy as a way of “checking out” - when the climb is endless and it seems I am not progressing, I will play the game “let’s see how far I’ve come by the time I finish this candy...”


When I restarted my hike, I was standing in front of the candy shelf in Franklin. All I saw were lifesavers and caramels. None of these last long enough! About to give up, I heard a voice say, “there’s the Jolly Ranchers,” like a Bodhisattva who just dropped in to guide my way, another hiker popped up beside me and pointed them out. I ran into her on the street later and gave her a handful. It seemed the right thing to do.


Yesterday I had a long climb in the heat and humidity. I resorted to my Jolly Rancher technique. Brain checks out for the duration- no thoughts of how long, how hard, how slow.  Check back when the candy finishes. Works every time .  I have one Jolly Rancher left. I’ll let you know when I use it.","Hot Springs

Unfazed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613187,"This was a day that I will remember for all of its uncertainties. After a night of horrendous winds, the morning was still and humid, the kind of weather that precedes a storm and filled me with foreboding. I left Spring Mountain Shelter with the expectation of rain around noon, hoping that my foot would allow me to keep my weight on it. Three Advils did the trick . The rain held off, the temperature and humidity climbed, and I got to Little Laurel Shelter, my original goal, early in the day. 
The name of this shelter should be changed to Sad Laurel Shelter. Garbage, tin cans in the fire pit, a warped plywood floor, cigarette butts everywhere ... just a sad sight.The next shelter would have made for a 15 mile day, more than I thought my foot could stand, so I lingered a round the shelter, filled up on water, and waited for inspiration. I really didn’t want to stop so early in the day and then sit around waiting for the dementors to attack. 
Eventually Six Paws and Bones came through, and I decided to tag along with them, as Six Paws said he thought they would camp in Jones Meadow, and I like having Bones alongside at night. Bones is a huge black German Shepherd with paws  as big as a bear. He is training to be a human rescue dog, and Six Paws, his master, brought Bones with him from Germany. I can only imagine the red tape involved in that.  


We set off over the next steep climb of over 1,000 feet, dripping sweat, and then finally down toward Jones Meadow. Six Paws consulted Guthook and declared that he needed to go farther ( I think he is trying to make a resupply date for Bones’ dog food - but I could be wrong - bit of a language barrier there ) . Now I was in a dilemma - didn’t want to camp alone and wake up in the rain, and I had pushed my foot harder than I should have, and I also didn’t want to push to the next shelter.  



The decision was made for me when another hiker and his big dog arrived on the scene and Bones and the other dog decided that  it was time for a fight. Six Paws had to use all his strength to restrain him, all the while declaring that “I can’t stop here!” I was sitting next to him on a log and thought, “I’m about to be in the middle of a major dog fight!” So... I guess we can say that the trail provided once again and I got the inspiration I needed to move on by myself. I walked on to Jones Meadow, no one camping there, but I saw a road and decided to try and see about a shuttle to Hemlock Hollow! Wonder of wonders it all came together and I spent a dry night inside while the rain beat ( and is still beating) relentlessly on my roof.","Spring Mountain Shelter

Hello gentle reader. Today you will discover a harsh truth. I am not who I say I am. 


I am not a hiker. I am not a master food dehydrator and I am most definitely not an outdoor aficionado. 


I am an occasional knitter, an Infrequent biker, a cook, Baker, party planner, fur mommy, celebrity gossip loving, bad-ass surgeon. 


So you see now. I am not unfazed. 




But I am her daughter. (Some might say the favored one. The Golden child. Infant prodigy although please, in general I abhor such titles.). So you can call me by my trail name “compass”... although let’s be honest, I won’t use it since again, I’d rather take a nap on a beach then hike (cue my mother’s sighs of betrayal and dumbfounded ness “WHY GOD?! Why?”)


So why am I here? Trespassing into this hallowed iCloud?  Because for those of you who have lost track of time- too busy counting your blisters, jolly ranchers, and remaining poo-wipes ... today is Mother’s Day. 


And therefore today I just want to let my fearless, courageous, beautiful, fiery mother know that her demands for excellence, her unending desire to strive for perfection, and her perseverance through incredible challenges leave us all in awe of her. 


In the words of one who inspired her trail posts I will end with this mantra for the trail. 


“For our path in life...is stony and rugged now, and it rests with us to smooth it. We must fight our way onward. We must be brave. There are obstacles to be met, and we must meet, and crush them!”


We love you mom. So incredibly proud. Keep hiking.  Xxoo","

Two days lost sitting out the rain , but today I was off with the promise of clearing by mid afternoon. The trail was a mud fest, and my footprints were the only ones in the mud. It wasn’t until the afternoon that I saw another hiker. A few miles in I had a choice between “ exposed ridgeline trail “ and “bad weather trail “ , and I chose the ridgeline route because I had to believe that it was drier than the bad weather route, which was sitting in its own little lake. It required a bit of rock clamoring, and I knew I was on the ridgeline, but it was just solid whiteout on both sides, so once again I missed out on what must have been magnificent views.  Some of the rocks were challenging - and just before I hit the rocks one of my trekking poles broke. Half of it was left in the mud when I moved ahead - the cable must have snapped, so I pulled it out and rammed the two halves back together with a rock. It came apart again later, and I beat it back into submission, but it’s only temporary. I had service up on the ridge, so I texted my family and my son in law and daughter took charge of research and ordered a new pair that I will be able pick up in Erwin. 
The last half of the day was a good run mostly down hill to the shelter, and eventually a group that has been hiking together showed up. The rain stopped, but the day was overcast. Everyone is hoping to see the sun tomorrow.","Jones Meadow

I think it must have been in the 30’s - everyone was freezing this morning and I ran into Storm Chaser who said that he was almost hypothermic in his tent last night. Yikes! I tied my sweater over my head when I was in my sleeping bag and had to put on everything I had to keep warm. 
It never did warm up that much, and the sun just showed up briefly in the afternoon. Even the 1,000 foot climb around noon didn’t get things cooking . The ridges were windy, the woods cool. In many ways it felt like the Pacific Northwest - damp and chilly with flashes of sun in a lush green woods. 


I hiked a couple of miles past the shelter I had originally planned to stop at - it was too early in the day. Instead, I got picked up at Sam’s Gap to spend the night at Nature’s Inn.","Flint Mountain Shelter

Unfazed,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613573,"Today was my first time slack packing. I didn’t start out the day with a plan to slack pack,  but when I was leaving this morning, I ran into a group of guys who were leaving from Spivey Gap and hiking south - extra room in the shuttle- so why not ? I jumped in and hiked back to Sam’s Gap, 13.4 miles,up and over Bald Mountain, which for me was spectacular. 
I never got to see Max Patch or Clingman’s Dome, the weather both days was just solid white out and rain, so today was my first day up against the sky with a 360 degree view.It was magical up there, and even more so because I had no idea what was to come. I was just focused on moving along at a steady pace, keeping warm, enjoying my light pack, and then ... the heavens parted and I found myself on top of the world! 
I slowed down and stopped for lunch and then slowly wound my way along the bald. 
It wasn’t easy to get here, I had to work hard at it. This was worth it, and the phrase, “you have to put yourself in the way of beauty” kept running through my mind.
I like this quote, which I see is attributed to Cheryl Strayed(!) , but I usually think of it as applied to tiny, secret gifts of beauty, like a wildflower that takes my breath away, the lilting flute of a wood thrush, or a fuscia rhododendron that is suddenly ignited when the rain backs off and just for a single second the sun comes out - and then goes away. That’s it - one second - just long enough to inhale - and then back to grey. It has to be enough. 
But today Bald Mountain was big time knock you over the head with a frying pan beauty. Nothing subtle or secret. I guess that counts too.","Spivey Gap

Foot started to really hurt once the long descent down to Erwin began, and by the time I had about 2 miles to go I was limping along on my third dose of Advil and yelping every time I stepped on a root in the wrong place. 


Once again, the trail provided - as I was moaning and groaning over how I could make the last miles, a sudden bustle in the underbrush off to my right took my mind right off of my pain! A bear crashed through the bushes and took off as fast as it could go! I startled it, it startled me. My heart was thumping, but since the bear was running away from me I figured that there were no cubs in my path, so I just began to sing and rap my trekking poles together, “I’m here! You’re there! I’m just passing through!” And so I hobbled along, hoping that the dose of adrenaline would help with the pain (not for long). 


Finally got down to Uncle Johnny’s , ready to pick up my new trekking poles, only to find that yes, they had arrived , but they had put them out in their shop for sale !!! Hmmm... lucky for me no one had purchased them! At some point they realized that they hadn’t ordered them and put them back behind the counter, so I was able to retrieve them as well as my resupply. At the same time, I knew that I had another envelope to pick up, but the young man working the counter said that he was busy, couldn’t locate a record of it, and then handed me the book and said I could look for it myself .  


I was a bit stunned to see that their method for recording and storing the huge number of packages they get is entirely in order of receipt. In other words, with no help from the alphabet! Each package is numbered and that’s it . Teetering on the brink of delivering a “ Big L”, I wanted to hop over the counter and say, “let me show you how to make the alphabet work for you! You can use BOTH numbers and the alphabet! “ But once I found my package I just needed to sit down and be out of pain, so I called a shuttle and shoved off.","Spivey Gap
