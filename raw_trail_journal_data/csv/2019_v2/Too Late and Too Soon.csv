Too Late and Too Soon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606780,"The 320 miles from Pinkham Notch, New Hampshire, to Katahdin are between us and a completion of the AT. All the 800 miles of section hiking were repeated in 2010 on our attempt to through hike which ended in Pennsylvania that year. The following year ended in Franconia Notch, New Hampshire, and the third year at Pinkham notch. The AT itself will harrow you, but not finishing will plunder your peace even more in my case.
However, we needed time away from it to do other things like long distance bicycle trips. It happened that we found success on those trips and restored our craving for adventure.  The realization that we will probably be able to handle bicycle trips longer than the ability to backpack the AT gave birth to the idea of a through hike. We vacillated whether to just pick up where we left off or try another through hike.  
We will begin our hike a little differently this time by starting in Waynesboro, Va (Rockfish Gap). We were going to start in Maryland, but that meant the Shenandoah National Park facilities would still be closed when we got there.  The ability to carry less food due to the waysides is a nice feature of hiking the Shenandoah miles.  So the plan is to start at the southern end of the park and continue south to Springer mountain.  From Springer, we will rent a car to head back to where we started and head north.",,View Entry,"Jan 31, Thu",0
Too Late and Too Soon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606781,"The first attempt to thru hike entailed listening to the continuous humming of the food dehydrator for food preparation.  We wasted a lot of time, energy, and money because the chicken we dehydrated was like rocks to the point that another hiker didn’t even allow his hungry dog to have it for fear it would harm its gut. Some things like dehydrated spaghetti sauce worked out well, but it’s not worth it in our estimation. We’ll start out using Mountain House meals for dinners, and figure out something for breakfast and lunch.
We started before with a pump action water filter, switched to Aqua Mira after a few hundred miles to save weight, then switched to a gravity filter. We’re trying the Sawyer squeeze this time. We also have changed to the Big Agnes Copper Spur tent as our old Big Agnes Seedhouse  has done its duty. Our packs are the Deuters that we started with in 2010. They are banged up, but we haven’t been able to find anything as light that we like as much. If they fall apart, we’ll have to replace or have our old Mountain Smith packs from section hiking sent to us. 
The rest of the gear is a combination of old and new. Some things that are definitely new to our experience are carrying a recharging device and Guthooks app. We certainly don’t have the app figured out yet, but it sure seems like a great tool. 
Probably one of the most important aspects is to train, and we have been doing things differently this time. The past involved logging miles without regard to improving balance or strengthening our core and upper body. We started weight training in the fall and included yoga, piyo, and Tai Chi classes. The intention of these classes was focused on preparation for the trail, but we found out they were more than that.  Each of the instructors eclipsed our expectations, inspired a true interest, and imbued us with the recognition that the classes were more than a tool to enhance a backpacking trip. I guess we can think of Melanie, Laura, and Frank as our first trail angels of this hike.",,View Entry,"Feb 01, Fri",0
Too Late and Too Soon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606782,"Choosing to tackle something that feels safe and instilled with security is inherently not the description of an adventure. A choice based on one’s own volition carries the burden of coping with the outcome.  Therefore, an expected outcome ought to be part of the plan. The goal is a thru hike and the ability to adapt to “what is”.  
Before selecting this adventure, we needed to establish whether it came from inspiration or desperation. We compromised by agreeing to the desperation of needing the completion and the inspiration to make the hike more than a means to an end. 
So we will start our steps with the goal in mind, and the candor to be flexible to what the trail offers. To only dwell on the miles left diminishes the present glory that may be right in our face. One of my favorite quotes is “this day will never come again” by Thomas Merton.",,View Entry,"Feb 03, Sun",0
Too Late and Too Soon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606898,"A small amount of this, and a small amount of that equals large amount of weight. We always tried to be discretionary and prioritize, eventually achieving pack weight of about 30 pounds.
Weather is fickle and in charge, so judgement is key to safety and comfort. Filed away under “lessons learned” is the blunder made on our first thru hike attempt. We got through the Smokies and felt relief from the threat of cold weather. When we got to Hot Springs, we made a trip home for Too Soon’s mother’s 90th birthday party and to see our dog, Parker.
I got the bright idea that we could swap our sleeping bags for our lighter ones and also leave some other cold weather gear home. This seemed brilliant as we would reduce pack weight and the postage to send them home anyhow, surely very soon! 
Leaving Hot Springs in drizzling rain and chilly, it was nice to start climbing with a little less weight. It got colder and colder, and I started to wonder if I had made a judgement error. That was a miserable sleepless cold night followed by a few more, and taught me at least one lesson. The first thing Too Soon did when we got to Erwin was go the a dollar store and buy two fleece blankets to augment our light bags. They only had children’s, and Too Soon ended up with Cars, and I got Tinkerbell.  Of course the projected pack weight savings was now eliminated, but we were warm! As soon as we were certain of warmer weather, we cut the blankets in half.",,View Entry,"Feb 07, Thu",0

They lost their previous nest in the windstorm last week but are determined to not relocate. Watching them is beautiful as they work together using little bits of twigs, straw, and other available construction materials. When I brushed the dogs in previous years, they would gather the fur.
As the birds prepare a new house for the arrival of the family, I doubt if they ponder the potential dangers and struggles they may face this season. They sing and take flight to accomplish what needs done at this moment. 
I spoke about lessons learned in a previous entry, and I will add the joyful birds to that list. Instead of always worrying about the past and letting that influence the future, maybe the birds can sort it out with their example to be interested in the present.",,View Entry,"Feb 28, Thu",0

She called a cab, and we finally got going after 3. Christian, a runner, saw us trying to get a selfie by the sign. He stopped to talk and took our picture.The trail was great and we passed a few more people along the way. We passed an old stone chimney, then a very old graveyard with headstones so weathered they looked like grey teeth sticking out of the ground.We started descending to the trail to discover trail that hadn’t been maintained yet. We climbed over down trees and bushwhacked the rest of the way. A great shelter with picnic table and privy. The water source was the raging creek. It was very cold and struggled to keep warm enough, but the birds were singing this morning, sun filtering through the trees, and filled with gratitude to be able to do this.","Rockfish Gap

Too Late and Too Soon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608054,"We put our very cold hiking clothes on, ate a Mountain house egg breakfast, and coffee. Packed up and rock hopped across the swiftly running creek. It was a little tricky to find the trail due to blow downs and no blazes. Finally, Too Soon spotted a blaze, and we started climbing out.
One switchback after another and awesome views got us up the mountain. I saw a chubby grey squirrel playing on a log, but not much wildlife yet. The ground is brown and abundant snapped trees from a harsh ice storm. Although birds sang good morning to us, only soaring birds off the ledges seemed to be around.
We reached a trail junction, and I had better signal, so I did yesterday’s journal. As we left from there, I noticed Too Soon limping. He fell pretty hard yesterday buckling his right knee underneath him as his pack pushed him forward. 
He claimed it was OK, but we slowly kept going. We stopped for lunch on a nice rock beside a waterfall coming off a boulder. The water at first looked green, but as I gathered it, I realized it was picking up the color of the moss it traveled over. I filtered enough to get the day done.
We crossed magnificent rock ledges looking out at ski slopes on distant mountains. The day started to seem long, and we knew we needed to get back to town to get a knee brace and rest Too Soon’s knee.
John, an avid local hiker and friend of a lady we met on the trail yesterday, was hiking towards us towards the end of the day. He asked us if we were the couple who left Rockfish Gap yesterday and chuckled that news travels fast in this area. He was out for an afternoon hike but graciously offered to take us into town where he lives after he is done.
We sat at the trail head parking lot enjoying the rest and talking to a cyclist riding the Blue ridge parkway. Soon John was back and took us to a CVS to get a brace, then to a hotel. The trail provides goodness in many ways, but trail angels are the most profound blessings of all. Thank you John.","Paul Wolfe shelter

Too Late and Too Soon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608190,"John, our trail angel, picked us up and brought us back to the Dripping Rock trail head where we last left. Sunny skies and warm temperatures started today’s hike. 
Too Soon wore the knee brace and did much better today than the hiking the day after the fall. John told us the miles would be rocky, and they were. We were on a ridge line most of today’s hike. The birds were more active today with warmer temperatures, and their songs were far better than any headphones. The ground is still brown with old leaves, and not much spring yet.
We stopped at a beautiful spring underneath a big rock and filtered two liters to have with our Spam and tortillas. We each had a nutter butter cookie.
At Reids gap we decided not to push the knee any further and called Royal Oaks cabins. Chris picked us up, and we volunteered to clean the cabin for half price. It’s lovely here and Remi, the German Shepherd, is sweet.","Dripping rock trail head 
",Reid’s Gap,"Mar 15, Fri",4.90
Too Late and Too Soon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608224,"Kris dropped us off at Reid’s gap to slack pack over Three Ridges Mountain. We got an early start in 32 degrees and sun peeking through the trees. Muddy areas were frozen, and the treadway began really nice. 
I stopped on the climb to put a bandage on my big toe, and Feral, who had started at Springer in January, stopped to chat. He wants to be finished by June 1 so he can also hike the PCT. besides Feral, there were several hikers out today. A lot with their dogs, and one had two beautiful Australian Shepherds.
The trail turned to boulder fields off and on until the last two miles which couldn’t have been nicer. There were magnificent views since no leaves blocking the distant mountains and beautiful valley below. The houses looked like doll houses and the junction of the ravine behind them a sight to savor.
We stopped at a giant log and had lunch, then later stopped at Harpers Creek shelter to rest for 10 minutes. We had prearranged a pick up time with Kris, and time had been absorbed in the boulder areas so break time limited.
We crossed the suspension bridge at the Tye river, and Kris and Remi were waiting for us. They had only been there 5 minutes so all worked out.
I did yesterday’s journal on the trail when I found service, but Kris rebooted the system so I might get this posted tonight. I have very scanty cell service here.","Reid’s Gap

Too Late and Too Soon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608320,"Kris dropped us off at the Tye river, and we soon entered the Priest wilderness. We climbed the mountain for the next 4.8 miles to reach the summit at 4063 feet elevation. The treadway was really good except for minor sections near the top, and passed a beautiful waterfall that looked like sparkling emerald water cascading since it took on the colorful moss background. I was amused by it since it was Saint Patrick’s day. Abundant magnificent views without the blockade of foliage was a benefit of still winter conditions.
 We had full packs and though very cold outside, we had soaked clothing from sweat. About 1 mile from the summit, a group of Boy Scouts passed us as the were descending the mountain. 
We continued on to the shelter and debated whether to go further or stay put since the next shelter probably too far for us right now after that climb. We decided to stay and immediately stripped off wet clothing and put on camp clothes. We strewed our shirts out in the cold but sunny areas and even our puffies. We tried to keep comfortable enough with our rain jackets, but not able.
We put our sleeping pads and bags down and got in for awhile to get warm. After an hour or so we got out to filter water from the spring and cook dinner. We had to get back in the bags soon, and Patrick showed up. He set up a tent and waited on his friend who was going on a long section hike.","Tye River

Too Late and Too Soon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608388,"Another very cold night in the shelter even with putting the tent fly over our sleeping bags. No birds singing, but morning arrived. 
We started packing up gear, and I first got a leg cramp kneeling to roll up and stuff my Neoair sleeping pad. Then leaning over to stuff sleeping bag and pack, my back torqued and into spasms. I knew I had not hydrated enough yesterday then had gotten cold. I moved carefully until it loosened up a bit, then eased myself off the shelter platform. 
Our water tubing was frozen and water bags slushy so we got more spring water and filtered into empty bottles. After two bottles of water and a hot coffee, I knew I had to be able to hike out of there.
Patrick was heading back to Roanoke today after seeing his friend off to continue hiking. He had gotten to the shelter via an impassable by vehicle forest road that junctioned with the AT.
His vehicle was parked at the bottom of that road. He said he would drop us at a small town on his way home. We continued on the AT then found the road he indicated and started down it. It was a really nice hike passing many campsites and the spur trail to Crabtree falls. 
We finally found Patrick’s vehicle and sat on a log while we waited for him. He is a fun adventurous guy with many stories. He had warned us that the backseat of his car was missing since he drives part time for Uber, and Saturday night, a 25 year old girl had had an accident in his car. She had been Saint Patrick’s day partying. 
We got into town and cranked up the heat. I put Melaleuca on my back and stretched after a hot shower. It will be sore for awhile, but we’ll hike out Wednesday.
We got a subway and stayed warm the rest of the day.
Maybe we should have started in Georgia where warmer and less difficult, but we now have Humpback, Three Ridges, and the Priest done. We’ll keep hiking toward spring and finding amazing people along our way.","The Priest shelter

Too Late and Too Soon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608416,"My back still sore and touchy, but improved. With more attention to needs, will be out of trouble. We did our laundry, made some shuttle arrangements, and worked on logistics. The forest road put us near Montebello, so we’ll have about 16 miles from Fish Hatchery Rd to Rte 60 to make up later since shuttle will drop us at Rte 60. We have already hiked that area twice before, but it doesn’t matter if we can accomplish this thru hike.
With shuttle back to the trail arranged, we decided to take the Maury express to the Walmart in Lexington to buy Mylar emergency blankets to augment our sleeping system. The Express is 50 cents each way per person and runs on the hour. It was like taking a tour of the area as it makes numerous stops at all kinds of places. An Uber would have been more direct for sure, but also the cost of a shuttle back to the trail.","Buena Vista

Everything still brown and covered with dead leaves, but starts out fairly smooth and soon hiking through Brown Mountain Creek historic area. Following a creek with evidence of a past community with stone fireplaces and remnants of foundations, we soon were at the Brown Mountain Creek shelter. We stopped long enough to sign the shelter log. 
Miles passed and the Lynchburg reservoir became in view to our right. The trail skirted around it until we came to the suspension bridge. My heel was hot, and I wanted to get my boot off to check for a blister, so we decided to sit on the steps of the bridge and have lunch of our usual spam on tortillas, cookies, and m&m’s.
We started climbing Rice Mountain immediately after lunch. We called Oma close to the summit to let her know we were ahead of schedule.
About a mile and half before Punchbowl we were startled by the roar of fighter jets. They were so close, and the noise deafening. Oma told us later they come out to do mountain maneuvers from Virginia Beach.

The night before last I had a toothache, and I took an antibiotic that I had with me. After about an hour, it subsided somewhat. Hiked yesterday with mild toothache, but again last night, same scenario.
Called a local dentist this morning, but they had a full schedule, and only one dentist working as the partner away at a meeting. The staff said to give them time to listen to their answering machine for cancellations, and if they had any, she would work me in. I was using Too Soon’s phone at the time, but gave her my number as that’s the one usually used.
We took the bus to the pharmacy to look for clove oil and get a prescription my home dentist called in for me. The local dentist did call back, but on Too Soon’s phone that was being charged. There had been a cancellation, but by the time we called back, Too Late.

Too Late and Too Soon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608623,"Oma dropped us off at the Punchbowl overlook where we ended last, and we started climbing Punchbowl mountain then Bluff mountain in very cold windy conditions. The tread way was great, so for me, that’s the most important. We missed the trail soon past the Ottie Cline monument as we stayed on what seemed like an old road. We didn’t see any blazes for a little while, and Guthook said we were within 5 meters of the trail. Too Soon spotted a blaze, and we bushwhacked our way back to the trail.
The wind was so strong that as I lifted my trekking poles, it would blow them sideways. We put our heads down and kept pushing. I was so grateful that my tooth wasn’t throbbing, that weather was not an issue.
 I needed to take my antibiotic at noon, and we had split a Mountain house egg breakfast so needed to eat lunch. We kept looking for a more sheltered spot, but pretty hard to find. Finally, we just sat on a rock, ate a packet of tuna with a tortilla and a cookie, and quickly got going as too cold.
We called the hostel from 4 miles out to set a pickup time of 3 thinking pretty much all down from where we called. Soon past the Johns Hollow shelter, the creek was swollen and swift covering most of the rocks to cross. Too Soon, with long legs, made it, but I took off my boots, socks, and gaiters. I put them in a bag and threw them across, then waded it. Just quickly put socks and boots back on so we could try to make the pick up time. I put my gaiters in my pocket.
Donna had only been waiting about 15 minutes, and she stopped at the post office so we could pick up our resupply box I had mailed. We got to the hostel and were greeted by Chief and Marco. Marco is from Germany and entertaining. We were barely in the door, and he handed us a beer. They had been to the small market and stocked up. When I turned down a second one, he seemed a bit hurt. Lol.
We walked down to the little restaurant and had fettuccine Alfredo with chicken, but carried half of it back to have for breakfast.
This is a very nice hostel and reasonable price that included the shuttle and laundry. Chief and Marco are northbound and started near Pearisburg. Chief got hurt there last year and is trying to finish. They had some miserable cold nights.","Punchbowl Mountain overlook BRP

They left earlier than we did as we were only going about 7.5 today and needed to stop back at the post office to send stuff from support box forward.
We crossed the James River foot bridge and before long, came to Mat’s Creek shelter. There were people there still in their tent so we didn’t meet them. Again, I had to fiord the Creek that was really high. I hooked my camp shoes to my pack after submerging them so they would dry as we hiked.
We climbed pretty much the rest of the day.  The birds aren’t singing much yet, but we did see some little white flowers. We stopped at a stream for lunch then got the day done. My tooth does ok during the day, but aches at night. I’m taking the antibiotic faithfully and sure hoping for a good night tonight.

We worked our way to Petites Gap, then started climbing for miles. We stopped at a spring to filter more water and met Blake and Sampson, a beautiful white husky lab mix. I was trying to scoop water to put in our bag, but Blake had a pump filter and offered to filter for us. What great trail magic! Sampson was so happy just laying down to wait for Blake to continue the hike.
We later ran into Santori. He was sitting on a log eating his lunch and heading north. He gave us a heads up on a water source.
We finally got to Thunder Hill shelter and stopped to fix dinner so we could move on and not have it to do if we got there late. The water source at the shelter is reported to not be that good, but I filtered it, then we boiled it.
We headed for Cornelius Creek shelter after we ate, and soon came to the Guillotine and the FAA tower on Apple Orchard Mountain. We stopped for a quick break then headed for the shelter. We could smell the campfire for a long time before getting there. Reverse and Rev were there and were great company for the night. They attempted a flip flop thru hike last year, but had to leave the trail for family reasons. They are trying to keep working on getting it finished. 
It got dark soon after we got there, and I went with Too Soon to help hang the bear bag. I hadn’t paid attention, and lost sight of his light on the way back.

We first met Homer in 2006 when we were section hiking. He shuttles hikers and is well known in the hiking community.
Yesterday, he shuttled us to the dentist and back, and today, he shuttled us so we could slack pack. He knows this area and is a wonderful person.
So we started our hike today going north back towards Jennings Creek where we ended last. It was crisp, but sun filtering through the trees. The trail was awesome, and the miles went by quickly. Everything still brown, very little birds, but treadway forgiving and no big climbs.
We stopped at Cove mountain shelter for lunch, and I had to be careful about what I chewed. My jaw very sore but now on the mend.
Soon after leaving the shelter, we ran into Mema and Josh. We saw them the other day too. Mema is going to try a southbound thru this year and is trying to get some of the south done ahead of time. 
We were soon on our descent back to Jennings Creek and called for the shuttle to take us to our hotel. The shuttle driver was over an hour late, and explained that he couldn’t find any available vehicle. Too Soon rode in the back of the maintenance truck with an old mattress and an abundance of scattered tools. I rode up front after moving a multitude of various items, and we made it back.

We hiked up to the power lines with amazing views of the valley below. We could see Carvin Cove reservoir as we worked our way across the rocky ridge. It began to get warm, and I saw my first butterfly of the trip.
We ate lunch at Lamberts Meadow Campsite. It’s a lovely place with a creek running through, a picnic table, and a bear box. We soon passed the Lambert’s Meadow shelter that had several people.

Too Late and Too Soon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609265,"Homer dropped us off at Va 311, and we started hiking north to get to the Andy Layne trail that we took the day we hiked out of Daleville going south. It was cold and windy, but many people were hiking. We passed by Johns Spring shelter, but stopped to sign the shelter register at Catawba Mountain Shelter.
As we got closer to McAfee knob, lots of hikers were around. It was very windy and cold so no one was staying long at the magnificent view. We asked a couple of guys to take our photo, and we did the same for a mom and her son. We continued north towards Tinker Cliffs which is a gigantic rock formation with incredible views. We stopped at Campbell Shelter along the way for lunch and filter water. Many people showed up, and although great to be with, we had to get moving as very cold.
We met Mark along the way sitting on a log eating his lunch. He caught back up to us later, and we hiked on and off throughout the day. We finally got to Tinker Cliffs and walked across the mammoth cliff in awe of the views. 
Mark was finishing his long hike at the Andy Layne trail head and offered to take us to Daleville on his way home to Waynesboro, and was our trail angel today.","Va311, Catawba

Too Late and Too Soon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609388,"Last night Too Soon was studying the map and came up with a plan that would allow us to slack pack over Dragons Tooth. Homer agreed, so with lightening speed, I unpacked my pack and put in only raincoat, light, water filter, phone, and personal items. Yahoo! Another day of being spoiled by Homer’s knowledge of the area and ability to get us where we needed to begin the day.
Homer dropped us off at Va 620, Trout Creek. It was crisp out so started the climb out of the Creek with down vest and jacket. I took the coat off in a little while so it wouldn’t be wet from sweating, and would be warm to put on at the top. We got to the sign for the Pickle Branch Shelter, and I scrapped the notion of going down to it to sign the shelter log as sign said 1/2 mile. I wasn’t willing to add a mile to today’s hike.
The tread way was smooth with gentle switchbacks until we we reached the top. The rubble began, back we had magnificent views. We worked our way across the ridge to the sign for Dragons Tooth. We sat on a nice rock and ate lunch, then started down the very steep, rocky trail. It wasn’t too bad as many little spots to put your foot on to go backwards and have a rock to hold onto. Two sets of rebar were also drilled into the rocks that helped.
A few people passed me as I was so cautious and slow on the descent, and we later caught up to them as one had hurt her ankle and could barely move. She was trying to keep going, and I offered my poles to help her, but they had a set and four of them helping.
We reached Lost Spectacles Gap and took the Dragons Tooth blue blaze trail to the parking lot where Homer had just arrived.
It was a sunny, beautiful day to hike that stretch, and we are grateful for so many blessings. Now we have a 5.9 mile gap in trail miles from Va 311 to where we stopped. We have hiked it in the past, but like the 16 we skipped near Montebello, it will have to be made up if we manage to thru hike.
Thank you for messages of support and know how much appreciated!","VA 620, Trout Creek

We said goodbye to Homer who has been so much fun for a week. We will miss him. We started climbing out of Trout Creek on a very nice trail. Everything is still brown and many spots deep with dead leaves. There are a few spring flowers occasionally and fantastic views.
The packs felt so heavy today, and we took many breaks. A day hiker passed by as we were sitting by the trail. He was moving swiftly and probably climbs the mountain often. I saw the flag waving and realized we had reached the Audie Murphy memorial. We put our packs by a tree and went up to it. There’s a solar light on the flag, a huge granite memorial, and trinkets, did tags, and a rock cairn. 
We ate lunch there, and later, stopped for a few minutes at a bench that had been placed there to check for cell service. We hardly have any service in this area so I’ll probably have to post this entry sometime tomorrow or whenever able. We started to descend the mountain and near the bottom, ran into the Honeymoon hikers. A little bit later we met Two step, and Uncle Grandpa stopped at the shelter for water and moved on.
We found a really nice tent site, filtered water, and had a Mountain House dinner.I’m having back pain again, but taking Advil and hoping be better.","Trout Creek

Too Late and Too Soon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609592,"It took a long time to pack up camp as I was struggling with back pain and spasms. The road we had passed last night was the closest way out, but only a secondary road with local traffic and no cell service. The only way to go was forward. I drank two bottles of water and took more Advil.
We had a shorter climb, but rocky, then rock slabs. The rocks were dry and not slippery so not too bad. We got to the sign for the Sarver Hollow shelter and sat on a log for lunch. It was beautiful weather and some signs that spring was coming. We could smell smoke and could see it coming up the ridge. A helicopter flew over, and we wondered what was going on.
We started the descent and then onto farm land. We passed the Keffer oak which is the second oldest oak on the trail. We got to Va 42 and walked up to a house. We had no cell service.","Niday Shelter

Too Late and Too Soon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609723,"The pilgrimage of finding goodness began as soon as we left Rockfish Gap. First, the runner who stopped to take our photo, then Mary and her friend. The next day, John, who went above and beyond to be kind and a great trail angel when Too Soon’s knee was painful from the fall the day before. 
Next, Kris, from Royal Oaks, and his beautiful German Shepherd, Remi, brightened our journey. 
When I torqued my back at the Priest shelter, Patrick was our trail angel. From the back pain to the notorious tooth debacle, still trying to get miles, Oma became our next source of inspiration. Reaching the James River, we met Donna, the caretaker and shuttler for Stanimals hostel in Glasgow. Her attention to detail makes the hostel a great success, and her caring of people makes everyone better.
On our way to Cornelius Creek shelter after a good night in our new tent at Marble Springs campsite, we met Blake and his dog, Sampson. Blake offered to use his pump filter to fill our bottles after seeing me scooping water from the spring. He also loves the birds, and we tried to  recognize one who was really performing.
After spending the night at Cornelius Creek shelter, we got to Jennings Creek as it started to rain. Jada popped out of the woods right behind us and offered to let us sit in her car while she waited on her hiking partner, Temo. They took us where we wanted to go for the night.
By then, realization set in that the tooth required intervention as the antibiotic wasn’t fixing it. So the morning was tasked with finding a dentist. Dr. Burke called me back, worked me into his schedule, sorted out the problem, and gave me my options. He sacrificed his lunch time to do the extraction. Not only very skilled, but kind and gracious, making the patients in that community very fortunate.
Homer had taken us to the dentist, and for the next week would become an awesome friend and shuttler. As a former thru hiker, trail maintainer, and experienced resource of the AT, we had a great time with him. We also got to spend time with Therese, Homer’s wife. She has the same  credentials and attributes as Homer.
So with Homer’s help, we slackpacked the miles from Jennings Creek to Trout Creek. Post extraction of the tooth did not yield relief for some time, and sticking close to help was good.
Then we said goodbye to Homer and left Trout Creek with full packs. We climbed Brush mountain and were treated to wonderful tread way and magnificent views. The weather was perfect and should have been a wonderful day. However, my back ached all day and just felt odd. We got to the Niday shelter, and I went for water at the stream. I realized my back was tightening again and shooting pain with each bend I made. I got my sleeping bag and Neoair into the tent and I knew I was in trouble.
In 2014 I injured my back while cleaning windows. I backed into a banister, and it felt like someone whacked me with a ball bat. Exercise and all the other techniques got it back to good most of the time, but a wrong move now and then caused a recurrence of the problem. I thought I had diligently strengthened to increase the odds of carrying the pack and many miles were ok.
The night proved to be ridiculous. The only way out in the morning was to hydrate, Advil, and hike forward. We got to Va 42, walked up the road to a house as we had no cell service, and were greeted by Tonya. She let us use her phone to call Homer, stayed on her porch with us entertaining us with stories about the area and her family, and gave us water. She was inspiring with her happy genuine attitude.
Homer had a long drive to get us, but as usual, knew the right things to say. The next morning, Therese took us to get a rental and get home. The drive home was not from the direction we had dreamed of, but gratitude for all that we had encountered for 172 miles made things acceptable. 
The AT is a wonderful treasure, and although we haven’t finished it, I love the memories each trip yields. Thanks to everyone for everything.","Va 42
