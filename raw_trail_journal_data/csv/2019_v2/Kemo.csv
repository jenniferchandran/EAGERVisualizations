Kemo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606634,"I retired from the Army in 2012, almost 23 years and a couple of rotations in Iraq.  It was a bitter sweet end to a career but one that I knew was coming.  Ah, life in the ""civilian world"" was an adjustment and one that was not just hard on me but my lovely bride as well (look in a book that defines an Army spouse and you will see a picture of Ms. Molly).  I had talked about walking the AT after I retired but life has other plans.  I left one job in the Army to start another and begin my families new chapter in a new location, new home, new career.  I still dreamed of walking in the woods and started reading (great read of AWOL's journey) and researching what I would need.  I had hiked and canoed quite a bit in the Adirondack Mountains as a kid and enjoyed being in the woods...why one joins the Army...and continued to enjoy my time ""in the field"" while in the Army.  So one day prior to leaving for my folks place in Traveler's Rest SC, my lovely bride looks at me and says...you need to go on a walk and get your head straight.  What better way then to take a walk in the woods, doing something that I had always dreamed of doing.  So I planned to start at the beginning.  Start in the South and work my way North.  Now I thought I had the right equipment, old pack I had used in the past on a number of canoe trips, my trusty army boots, a new Hammock (new thing, lets give it a try).  a couple of liter bottles of water and food...off you go...you know how to walk in the woods...Walking up from the Arch to the top of the falls, steps...I am not walking up steps...started my walk at the top with the wife sending me off on my adventure (and turning around to drive back to Traveler's Rest to then return and pick me up in a few days...again, great army wife).  I had read the hike up to the southern terminus was no joke.  In July, hot, humid....another level of suck.  Hot day, drank a lot of water.  Stopped to make water at Black Gap.  Using a pump system, not great and discovered that you really want to be carefully with the water that you have filtered...started a second round of pumping.  The water at Black Gap is a long steep climb down and back, not fun in the afternoon heat of North GA.  I made the top of Springer around 1630.  Had thought about staying at the top but Bear signs around the shelter and the fact that there is no water, and the trail listed as being easier going north, I set out on my first miles on the AT!  Made an easy walk down to the vic of Stover Creek and made camp.  First time using a hiking kilt, brillant!  Hammock, great sleep.  Back, not so much.  The old girl needs to be retired (that and no hop strap, modification fixed that for tomorrow).  The heat is a concern, hydration is easy when you have easy access to water.  Need to make water at every chance.","Amicalola Falls State Park

Kemo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606635,"Day 2 on the trail started after a lovely night sleep.  Hammock and tarp system was great.  I think I have picked my sleep system for the trail.  Feet and legs feel great, just some chaffing from all the humidity...something that needs to be watched.  So modified the pack to have a belt/hip strap.  Makes a difference with the load on the back.  Hot day but the trail is lovely.  Met Ed from Chicago.  He is section hiking to Franklin.  Leaped frogged a number of times today, he is also headed to Justus Creek today.  Ed is using the time to get away from ""the noise of society"", agree it is nice to be in the woods and only have to be concerned with where the next foot is placed.  Stopped for Lunch at Hawk Mtn Shelter.  A survey crew from VT (a couple of Grad students doing impact assessments around the shelter).  Hawk MTN was the last place to make water till Justus creek, 7 miles away.  It was a hot afternoon.  The walk to Justus was not terrible, just hot!  Ran dry on water about 2 miles out.  One of those moments to ""go looking for water"" or gut check and walk the 2 miles to a known water source....yeah gut check is the right call.  Came into Justus around 1830.  Soaked feet, made water, set up hammock and made dinner with the crew that also set up in the tent sites.  Thought about not putting the tarp up to have a nice cool breeze over the hammock, glad I did as the sky opened up just as we were finishing dinner.  Rained thru the night.  Hammock was dry and the tarp system worked well.  Learned a good lesson today...water is important, need to get a bladder system that I can sip on while walking.  Walking to Woody Gap and coming off the trail.  Need to adjust equipment and how I walk the trail in the future.","vic Stover Creek Shelter

Kemo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606639,"Lovely morning at the creek.  Made water and looking at a short walk to Woody Gap.  Cutting walk short, too hot to be doing this and a need to upgrade on equipment.  The walk has been successful, I enjoy the time in the woods, time to reflect and think about what I need to focus on, time to just ""be"" in the woods and not worry about the outside world.  This will be my head adjustment, making me a better father and husband....and a great way to shed some pounds. Took my time getting up and packing out as its just a short walk today to Woody Gap.  Another hot day but got into Woody around 1330.  Nice spot in Woody to dry some things out.  Was going to have to stealth camp just up the trail (near the spring) as the wife could not pick me up until tomorrow (original day to come out).  Spent the afternoon drying things out and relaxing, planning the next section, something closer to home in VA.","Justus Creek

Walked til about 1800 and then stealth camped just off the trail, vic Mills Gap overlook.  Using my old Army ruck....remembered why we never did like using these old ones...punches to the kidney.  Set it up with a bladder and the sipping while I walk (change from last hike) is great.  no more stopping to water, just keep walking.  The trail is nice and rolling thru here as it parallels the Blue Ridge.  Hope to make up the lost time over the next two days.","Black Horse Gap

Kemo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606642,"Good sleep and up and moving early to finish the climb up Floyd. Warm day but plenty of water making opportunities along the way.  Lesson learned from the first section hike...make water whenever you can when it is hot.  Changed from a water pump system to the purification pills.  Not concerned about the taste and the time to wait (30 minutes) makes for a good break to check feet and have a quick snack, makes for keeping energy up later in the day.  Took lunch on the top of Apple Orchard Mtn, former Cold War radar site that had over 200 airmen assigned to it.  Radar site still there, so nice cut grass location to lay out items to dry, take in some views and enjoy a lunch.  Nice terrain feature on the north side of the mountain, The Guillotine.  The trail was pleasant if not hot heading down towards the James.  Thunder Hill shelter had bear warning signs posted so kept moving along.  Made it to Petites Gap road and the heat was a bit much.  Received some trail magic here from a weekend hiker leaving and gave me a bottle of water and a PowerAid drink, really enjoyed the cold drink and the electrolites from the PowerAid.  Only need to pop over Highcock Knob to Marble Springs......Highcock is a pup....no views and a goat trial on the north side, really.  something could be done to avoid this in the Jefferson NF here.  Just saying.  Came out of the woods winded like an old bear on a couple of kids out hiking for the weekend.  They were looking at a map like they were trying to figure out where the spring ways...I pointed off to the south of the site like an old man of the woods and said it was just down over there (like I had been there a thousands time). Took some time to relax and figure out where to hang my hammock. Boys came back and said I was right about the spring location.  Went to make water myself, problem with hiking late in summer, water flow.  Spring had water but took a bit to get enough for dinner and the next morning.  Only a short walk tomorrow to link up with family at the hiker's bridge over the James.  Wife wanted an early pick-up so I was going to have to get up early to arrive in time.  Feet were hurting after the last two days of hard walking.  Going to need to get some real hiking boots, the army boots are done. I had hoped to stay at Matt's Creek Shelter but that was not going to happen before it got too dark.","Stealth campsite on Floyd Mtn

Set up the Hammock and made some lunch, expected the family to arrive shortly.  Problem with the footbridge parking lot....radio dead zone/no cell service.  What I thought was going to be an 1100 pick up ended up being a 1400 pickup.  So I got a good nap in after lunch, not knowing I had a long wait ahead of me.  Kids enjoyed walking back across the bridge and back along the trail....planting the seed with the kids for future family hikes.  You have to get them young and often to teach a life long passion for the woods.","Marble Springs campsite

Kemo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606644,"This was a shake out hike to start the 2017 season.  Read that this loop is a nice ""day hike"".  Drove up the night before and slept in the Car at Reid's Gap, discovered after the fact that the Devil's Backbone Brewery was just down the hill, could have ""camped there"" and enjoyed a beer.  I understand that they have a camp policy for hikers coming thru that is nice.  Poured the night of the 5th, like cats and  dogs kind of pouring. Was woken up around 2300 when a couple arrived at the parking area and in the middle of the down pour got ready to hike in to the Maupin Field Shelter site, it was quite clear from the lady's comment's that she was not a camper, hiker, or really too keen on what they were about to do (hike into the woods in the dead of the night).  Off they went and thought nothing of it until about 20 minutes later when they returned and she was in a panic....seems she does not like spiders....freaked when she walked into the first web across the path (about where the trail enters the woods I assume)  Seems she was also scared of a mountain lion sneaking up from behind and getting her while she hiked which is why the ""boyfriend"" said she would walk behind her to keep her safe.  A phone call to a friend (I assume who they were linking up with) to confirm/just checking on mountain lions in the blue ridge....as the boyfriend ""thought"" right no mountain lions to worry about.  He would walk in front then to take care of the spiders.  She calmed down enough or was pressured enough to continue back up the path. Good for them that it soon stopped pouring rain.  I have never laughed so hard. 
I awoke the next morning, quick breakfast and day pack on, set off into the woods for a ""day hike"".  The three peaks trail is nice and there were some lovely views.  The Maupin Shelter site has a lot of tent sites around fire rings, given its easy access from the road off the Blueridge parkway.  Water source for the shelter is a fantastic stream behind it.  I headed up and around the peaks and back down the trail towards the Tye River bridge.  This downhill trail was brutal!  I felt sorry for folks heading up.  For my return trip I headed back up the trail to the Mau-Har Trail to loop back to the Maupin Shelter and then back to Reids Gap.  The Mau-Har was a lovely trail, scramble climb along a water fall, glad I was wearing a day pack.  Ate lunch at the bottom of the falls watching a marmot collect grasses for his den.  Interesting day, listening to the trees after the big storm from the night prior, some big trees had come down, and some were coming down off in the distance.  Glad I was not in the area, cracking sound was intense.  Return back to the car a sweaty mess, day hikers arriving made ""cleaning up"" a little tricky but one manages. A good tune-up walk for the year.","Reids Gap

Fell into a good sleep that night hangin in the hammock.  I am really glad I use the hammock system, easy to set up, no impact on the ground (does not leave a footprint when stealth camping), easy take down and makes for a good Chair!  This spot had a nice breeze which is always good to have after walking.","Reids Gap

The weather was suppose to get bad later so I set off to see what the trail would provide.  I met Handy at the Dripping Well Spring.  Handy, a previous thru hiker on the AT, was just doing his annual long walk over the summer.  He is from the Northeast and after school is out (he is a teacher) he goes on long walks. Fantastic person, great to talk to someone with his experience and one who likes sharing his lessons learned.  One of those moments where you go, ""I wish I could do this every summer for a couple of months too!""  I wished him well on his walk south.  I continued up the trail up Humpback.  It was a good day for walking, a little hot but its July!  After Humpback the trail was really nice going.  I was making good time and thought, comms are bad, I should walk all the way to Rockfish just to be safe, so I set my mind to a long days walking.  I had planned on staying at the Paul C Wolfe Shelter but continued on after making water (I always make water when I can).  Some interesting sites along the way of the old homes that use to be in these mountains before the road came.  I arrived in RockFish Gap early afternoon, got some water and a hotdog from the popcorn stand.  Spent some time trying to get a hold of the wife to see if she could make the pickup that afternoon and was told to hunker down, it was not going to happen and the family would see me in the morning, great.  Where to stealth camp in the Gap? I did not want to hitch down into town and there are no facilities in the Gap (use to be), so I found a nice place off the beaten path that also provided some shelter from the coming storm....and it was a good storm, my hammock system worked great, keeping me dry and my little campsite was well protected from the blowing storm.  Woke up later then usual the next morning (knowing I had time to wait).  Did a quick pack of everything and walk back to the area near the popcorn stand, laid things out to dry in the sun, hung the hammock to snooze in, got a hotdog and coke for breakfast and waited for the family.  Another lovely walk in the woods.(Phone had to be replaced, complete loss)","Rock Point Overlook

Came down into Tesnatee Gap to a wonderful Trail magic stop, hot tea, some snacks and a nice camp chair.  Another wonderful church group out helping the thru hikers with some goodies.  Enjoyed the break and was told of a nice camp spot past Low Gap that was nice if the shelter area was full.  Arrived at Low gap around 1600, I was smoked but Neil thought we could walk on to the spot we were told about, I new the trail was nice and level ahead so off we set....never found the spot, seems a blow had brought a tree down over the marker and you just needed to know exactly were it was to find the path to it...so we walked a bit further until light was starting to fade.  At least the last day was not going to be as long up to Blue MTN and down into Unicoi Gap.  Solo joined us at out stealth spot (it had a fire ring) just off the path.  She was working her way up to Ronoake VA to meet up with a friend.  She had spent the last year hiking around the world.  Needless to say the girl was a hiking machine.

Kemo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606768,"I got up before the light and was walking up to the Knob as day was breaking.  I figured I would have the view to myself for a bit, planned on having my breakfast there.  What a surprise, about 15 folks up on the Knob, some sitting and watching the sunrise others enjoying the view from various spots around the top, and some taking photos and video of the sunrise.  I dropped my pack and took in the view waiting for an opportunity to get as close to a solo picture as the crowd would allow.  Nice young lady taking some video of the site was kind of enough to take my picture.  She tried to crop out as much as possible the folks on the knob, she did a great job. I thanked her and it is one of my favorite pictures of my adventure on the trail so far.  Over my hot tea I found out from a couple that started the walk up from the parking lot at 4 in the morning they did not expect to see as many folks up here as well.  I did not know until I was near the parking lot that there are two trails...the AT, a bear of a trail, a good ankle knee buster, and the fire break trail (easy walking). Really, the last three miles of this walk were no joke, passed some folks that should not have been on the AT trail (needed to be on the fire break).  Funny thing, the night prior I had a dream of being boxed in at the parking lot an unable to move my car.....yes, I was boxed in.  Seems a lady had dialed 911 and said she was on the trail up to the knob but could not say were.  EMT and the local Rescue Squad had boxed in the parking lot with their vehicles and the Volunteers that responded.  No worries, I set up a camp chair in front of my truck and made a snack and hot tea, changed into some clean clothes after a quick hand towel bath.  Just enjoyed the afternoon and waited.  I wish I could have helped the rescue folks but they had to go up both trails to figure out where she was.  Eventually the nice volunteer that had boxed me in moved his truck and I was able to move out.  It was a lovely walk.","Pig Farm Camp site

Kemo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606771,"Ok, I did not plan on doing a 20 miler....fate would cause me to be an idiot.  SO I am up and moving early, great walk along the Creek here, NOBO hikers also enjoying the ""change in pace"" along the trail and many planning on getting off the trail and going into Buena Vista for pizza and resupply.  I assured them that the trail was nice all the way to the road and to enjoy the town.  They told me I had a long walk ahead of me, mostly up hill.  Yes, yes I did.  Passed the 800 mile mark on the trial..pretty cool, even if I was heading south and not even close to having 800 miles on my feet!  So having a full bladder of water I start up the trail from VA 607..up Bluff MTN.  it was a nice walk, just hot.  Knowing there is no water I was hoping to maybe spending the night around Little Rocky Row, however it was hot, and I was low water.  Not a good thing.  Now why the walk today turned into a 20 miler...the next water source was only a short 1.7 from my truck.  Hey I was walking to water, I might as well finish it.  Well the walk down the mountain was a bit painful, feet were not ready for the distance.  I spent a good amount of time soaking my feet in the stream just past Johns Hollow Shelter and making water.  Since it was a short walk, I was in no hurry to pull the feet out.  Made them nice an numb before drying them and putting the boots back on.  Dragged myself into the parking lot and dropped the gear.  Got my clean bag out of the truck and did a little cleaning in the James before heading home.  Found a soft ice cream stand in town on the way and stopped....yes I got the large Black Rasberry soft serve cone....it was glorious.","Brown MTN Creek Shelter

Kemo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625769,"My wonderful wife made getting some miles in this year a little easier.  The kids get out of school early in June and we arranged to spend the week near the park at a timeshare.  After the initial day at the water park the family dropped me off at Rockfish Gap to begin my walk thru the southern portion of the SNP.  Started off at 0830 and made good time after getting my backwoods tag from the check-in booth on the trail.  Warm day and I could feel that I had not prepped the legs.  I was in no hurry and knew to take it easy and enjoy the walk.  I made good time and was not pushing too hard.  A number of folks said that the trial was closed ahead (vic Wildcat Ridge) due to aggressive bear activity.  It seems a couple of the locals had learned how to get at beat bags hung by hikers.  Never a good to thing to hear, especially when you were looking at camping in the restricted zone.  After talking to the SNP front office I stepped out to shoot for Blackrock Hut, on the other side of the restricted zone.  It nearly killed me but I get in with enough daylight to hang the hammock and make dinner.  A bubble of thru hikers were in camp, the Hut was full with folks.  It was nice to see the ""family"" interact.  The ""dad"" of the group, Otter was an easy going fellow with a great ability to tell a story.  His girlfriend, Sunshine, was also a great story teller in her won and a lovely attitude.....no her name did not come from her shinning personality, but from the first two weeks on the trail when it rained on them straight....so Sunshine was born (Otter said those two weeks were the worst of his life). I was happy enough to enjoy there stories on the trail but hit the hammock early to get another god start in the morning.","Rockfish Gap

Kemo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625772,"So today was my last day on this section.  Up early and out before most around 0730. Another beautiful day on the trail, a little warm but not bad.  Again, made good time on the trail.  Phone did not have any service which I thought strange but figured I would get something near US 33....that did not happen and my battery life was being sucked away.  Well, I did not need it so turned it of to save it for later (my charger was dead).  So I continued to enjoy the hike, feet getting a little sore.  Trail magic at Skyline 66.7 parking area.  SOme guys up from the DC area....played the ""Do I know you from somewhere"" game, did not but we knew someone in common.   Ah the Army, no matter where you go someone is going to know of you or you are going to know the same people.  Great time talking with them and enjoying some Poweraid.  I made sure to tell them to wait around as a group of thru hikers was coming thru and they would enjoy them as well.  So Up and on, I think I have a about a mile to my end point....phone is almost dead and no signal, well I am near the time I told the family to pick me up so...yeah.  No family at the entrance....so instead of just waiting, hey its what 6 miles to Elkton from here....yes, I set off walking down US 33 towards Elkton....walking on the road is hard on the feet I will say.  I got 4 miles down the road before coming to a Motel, called collect to the wife from a pay phone (yes they still are a few around) but the wife did not answer (she did see it was a local number and got the kids into the car and headed out to get me....more to this).  So I start walking again when a gentleman pulls up and asks if the pass was closed?  I told him not on this side of the park.  He asked because his wife had called and said the pass was closed.  He then asked me if I needed a lift, I said sure, next an offer of a Miller Lite and off to the entrance to my timeshare I go.  Love the trail magic and kindness of strangers (it was a 15 mile shuttle).  So sitting on the curb of the 7-11, with a cold drink and snack, my phone decides to work, I get ahold of my wife, who is sitting at the entrance to the park.  I told her where I was and she laughed and said she would be right there.  Loved this trip.  Loved the folks on the trail.  Love my family for lending me to the trail every so often.","Pinefield Hut

You would think with the world shut down that it would have been a great time to hit the trail (it having been in March) but no, shutting down the trail and making folks get off in the Spring prevented me from heading out.....because looking for a job was sooo productive (no one is hiring!).  To top it all off a tree hit the house, going thru the roof and creating a sky light in my daughters bedroom (who was also in the room at the time the tree hit).  So yes, I am escaping, I need a reboot, and the wife is dropping me off and saying go away for two weeks!  Lovely family drops me off for a southern trip that I hope ends in Damascus, VA.  Three legs with three zero days planned.  A first for me as a long section hike!  Day was hot and humid, why I hike in July I do not know why, water is hard to find and its hot.  I had the shelter to myself.  Coyote walked up almost into the shelter early evening and let out a long call from the other side of the fire pit!  He was answered and off he trotted into the wood line.  Lovely first night!","VA42/Newport VA
