Blockin out the scenery, breakin my mind 
Don't this, don't do that, can't  ya read the sign?  

Cascade Falls Closed due to US Government Shut down.  Well damn I didn't even think about that.  Here we all stand pondering what to do. Park on the side of the road and disregard the sign and march our Happy New Year selves right on in. Go home. No way.  My mind races for the next closest option. We have such a good turnout for a hike we can't just go bust.  Bonnie's brought her Jeff,  Ole bum knee trucker boy.  Harry's in town too.  L-train is so happy to have some fellas along.  And one of our long lost little Dotson’s is back.  Sandra, Oh how we have missed you.

Wind rock at Mountain Lake. We could hike some of the AT, see this overlook, and get a few miles in.  Follow me.

Our quick reroute has us driving up Salt Pond Mountain.  The lake has gained some water table marks but is far from ever being what it once was. War Spur trail is just ahead....Larry makes an executive decision to pull in and call upon one of his most reliable ally. The Harry/Larry team confers, Wind Rock will have to wait, this shall be our hike.  

So just how far are we hiking now? Jeff asks with great concern.  Shorter than Martha's plan, Larry notes. Jeff is all in.  Lead on L-train this is YOUR route. 

The loop is a very easy hike. Sign reads 1.7. Don't forget the little side shoot to an overlook, that will add about .4 total out and back.  ""No no Larry says it's at least 3 miles, I hiked it on our honeymoon.  It's long"".  Sandra says I tell you what's long, Iron Mountain.  Now that's long, thought we'd never get up that.  The punches are beginning to hurt now....my name keeps coming up as the culprit to miss representing miles.  Martha miles...Jeff stops in his tracks...so just how long is this really?  

Laughter fills the air as our two packs, one of guys and one of gals, reminisce on down the trail. The overlook junction provides a place for another story telling time.  The AT can be accessed from this spot too. 1.6 miles and we can be following those white blazes to Wind Rock! Who's in? 

Kicked to the curb I follow back in line and we head for the overlook.  It's a small rock outcrop with a side view down the mountain.  In the summer rhododendrons bloom thick here.  Snacks and stories more.  

Our two packs rotate with us gals taking the lead back up to the loop.  Yes a little grade does the body good.  A little trail does the body good. Sandra confers and so it does for the mind. Having just lost her husband recently this first day of the New Year is her way of stepping into another stage of her life and I am so glad she did so with us today.  

Our little loop is coming to its end we can see our parked cars through the woods.  Say we could go for another round.....I have your round right here Bonnie says and it comes in a cooler.  That's right it is New Years.  Cheers, Cheers and Happy Year!","Mountain Lake Area

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606304,"There is something to
be said for taking the trail less traveled. 
Mom always said
“don’t get caught up in the crowd. You don’t have to do what everyone else
does.” I totally agree. We had Sawtooth Ridge all to ourselves yesterday.  
 McAfee’s parking lot
was filling fast when we arrived. Trying to guess how many cars would be
already there was the game driving up 311. 30 was the magic number and we all
under guessed. Sunny days will bring them out and yes they all where hiking to
the knob.

Harry invited two new
hikers to join us. Lawrence and Leia, a young couple from Bluefield with some
hiking experience under their belt. Lawrence has a military background and is
quite the outdoorsman with many hobbies both underground and above. Leia is
ready to get back into hiking and loves the outdoors as well.
Our hike today will
be 6 miles folks. One way with a ride coming at the end. Larry had his courier
work putting him in Roanoke this morning so he will come to our side parking
below Dragon’s Tooth and will walk in a piece to meet us. 
Wonder how long
that piece will be? HA

Shortly entering the
trail a sign is posted stating exactly 5.9 miles to Rt. 624. See it is craved
in wood, Martha Miles are correct, even under stated. How ya like that? 
Bonnie confirms it
is so. I’ve hiked his many times she reports and this is right, you can trust
me.

The ridge proves its
name with many ups and downs but most have been lessened with trail reroute
from the tip tops of the humps. We follow sight of the red roofs of the
Homeplace restaurant, a must go if you have not eaten there. We have other
plans for grubbing which will be at Mountain View Italian Kitchen. Yes Larry
planned this hike.

Toby’s Trail is now
official.  We come to its marker post. 
A side trail from
the AT down to an overflow parking area has been in the works since last year. 
Still a work in
progress this trail will also be connected to the Homeplace for foot travel
verses a hiker having to hitch from McAfee parking lot. This also might be a
good option for us some time too. 
Parking where the
foods at and walking in.  

An awesome sunny day
has me gambling that it will warm and be comfortable in shorts. 
I was sorta wishing
I put my long johns on at first but am managing to stay warm moving. The wind
still blows but not a swift as yesterday's gusts.  
If you look close at
that ridge to our right you'll see the tooth sticking up. Yes that is Dragons
Tooth.  We could hike on to it...8.2 miles one
way.  Bonnie tells of us hiking that trip
some time ago with my dad.  A training trip for us to be ready for
a 17 mile hike in the smokies.  We did on out and back, ran out of
water on the return, and were slap worn out at the end. 
What fun!  
We will be off our
ridge soon.  Once we start down we can take a break
in the open field.  Maybe Larry will have walked in about
that far and we can join up.  Harry calls out Larry Oh Larry where
are thou?   Fat chance he walks this far in. 
I point out the
direction we have yet to go. Only about 2 miles. 
He might make it in
a mile. Maybe he will be at the second bridge.
 We soak up some sun
snacking in the open field. Tall grass provides cushion from the possibility of
seating on wet ground.  I bet the tooth is busy today too. 
Awful glad we are
on this stretch. I text Larry to let him know our progress. Let's go find the
L-train.
 The bottom land
stands marshy.  We can see where the creek has gotten
up by the layer over grass from its heavy overflow. 
Glad this bridge is
still in tacked.  Muddy trail cuts throw this next field
section.  Wide open spaces so we can see our
ridge we just hiked from and the view off to see McAfee Knob. 
Catawba Valley, it
is grand.
 Coming up to that
second bridge I am guessing Larry should be close by but he will never hike
down to us.  My money is on his piece will take him
to the top of our last climb. The fellas stop to view the old mill remains. 
Hey I have contact
from Larry. He reports he is checking his altimeter. 
I got him a new
trail watch and he figuring out how to use it. 
Rattling off crazy
elevation numbers he says he has left us a marker. 
Ha bet that
elevation hasn't moved much big guy.
 One last climb. I
promise.  It really isn't that bad. 
A little more than
half way up the marker is seen.  Sticks lay in the trail in the shape of
the AT emblem. He even placed wickets beside the trail. He is wasting time so
not to hike Down too far.  Ha. I look up and his orange shirt
shows nicely in the woods.  Seating at the top. 
Told ya.
 Come on y'all I have
donuts waiting at the Van.  Can't beat a shuttle driver with
donuts.  
 Switchbacks lead us
over the last down grade to route 624. 
We've only seen 3
people today and one of those was just as we finished. 
Our little group
shared Sawtooth and its solitude. 
Now let's share
some Italian at the kitchen.","Rt. 311, McAfee Parking

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606654,"This U.S. Department
of Agriculture site is currently closed, due to the lapse in federal government
funding.  Guess they didn't get the memo the shut
down is over.  We will not be turned away today, let's
roll renegades!
We planned for such
since we hit this barricade a few weeks ago. 
Arriving early we
have a chance to park in the only pullover area on the narrow road. 
My guess others
will come and take their chances just parking on the shoulder. 
One other car is
already here.
Harry and Betty have
joined us along with their new doggie, Saber, on this birthday hike. Its
Bonnie's birthday and she picked this hike just for you Larry (and in case
trailer trucking Jeff could come too). ""Does this extra mile walk from the
car to the gate count against my trip?"" Larry inquires. This ain't no mile
Larry...its barely .2. 
We stop at the kiosk
and a notice states due to heavy rain and water current portions of the lower
trail are washed out and is closed advising hikers to take the upper trail
going and coming from the falls. 
""Wait Wo I
need full confirmation of this change. Harry says. Does this add miles to our
hike?""  You guys just pipe down and get to
hiking.  
Saber pulls her
master.  She is ready for her first hike at 6
months old.  A rescue dog with a great personality
she has fallen in good hands of these two. 
This will be
Betty's first hike to the falls too. 
Hiking up the fire
road isn't my preferred route as we will be missing a lot of the beauty of
walking along the creek but it does afford some nice views down on the waters
and will be warmer.  The sunshine is a game changer. 
It's a cold winter
morning and I'll take all this I can get.  
We have the trail to
ourselves so Saber is let free of her leash to run free. 
She listens well
and stays close between our two parties.  
Dripping water has
formed giant icicles hanging from the 'cave area'. 
The fellas
investigate while us girls make our way between frozen section of the trail.
Careful the leaves are hiding ice. This should be interesting coming down. 
We have our yak
trax but haven't put on our feet as these spots are few and manageable. I'm
betting the spray from the falls will have that whole rock wall area slick as
snot.
Hearing the roar of
rushing water we are close.  Snow dusts the trail and I can see a
few boot prints.  Look there Betty you can see the falls
from here.  A nice opening in the trees allows us
our first sighting.  It is running over about as thick and
wide as I've ever seen. Come on let's go down as take a closer look.
Light snow, rocks and
some iced leaves make for a tactful descent. 
It's ok guys just
take your time.  I come to the newest addition to the
trail. A very large flat rock step, a makeshift bridge over a run off stream
that forms during lots of rain.  
Water gushes from
all around the other rocks placed to funnel this in one direction. 
Slick slick. Damn
this is treacherous.  I test with my sticks. I could put yaks
on but then I could bust my ass too. 
It's just not worth
it.  
Harry turns comedian
and states we could take our shoes off a wade. You first. Oh back in the day
wouldn't have hesitated but an injury can be too great. Besides give a reason
for Betty to come back.  
So we double back to
the junction sign and discuss where all the conservancy trail leads. 
Remember that rock
ledge I pointed out on they way up? well this trail leads to it, Barney's Wall. 
You can also keep
hiking to the crest of Salt Pond Mountain and connect to Mountain Lake area. Oh
no you don't Lead dog. This is a 4 miles scheduled hike and no more. 
Maybe another day
this is a birthday hike and we must get our birthday girl out before dark.
The return brought in
many hikers. The road was packed. 
The Rangers better
get their gate open soon or there will be too many renegades to count. I do
hope each got their view of the falls and enjoyed their hike as much as we did.
 
Now let's eat. 
Happy birthday
Bonnie!","Road side parking

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607209,"With a day off for Presidents Day holiday why not spend it in the woods. I’ve been anxious to get back out. Rain, Wind more Rain has had me taking shelter too long. It’s lonewolfin time and no better place to hit the trail than the local stop at Pocahontas Road. New gravel has been dropped all the way down to the small parking pull off, nice. Thank you Mountain Valley Pipeline NOT! But hey they take care of their own. Don’t worry about what run off damage they are causing but by all means keep that dirt road up to heavy truck standards. A small sign posted says 10mph speed limit AND it’s right beside an AT marker post. Guess I better slow this foot travel down or I’ll get a ticket. I have parking to myself. I expected nothing else. Come on out sunshine your rays will be needed if this wind picks up more. Snow still remains after some falling weather these past few days. Always colder this way touching on the WVA line. Having notions of hiking on out the ridge to Symms Gap will depend on how I feel once at the top and if the weather holds. Chances of more rain forecasted. Glad I grabbed my rain jacket heading out the door. Sporting my leopard print fleece hat – Baum Proof Gear original- I’m set to climb. It’s all up from here so no need to even put on my extra layer just step out of the truck and hike. Fingers are cold but they’ll warm soon enough. I set a good steady pace. Feels so good to be back out. I’ve missed these white blazes. Breathing in the fresh morning air sets my mind to wondering. I’m back in Maine, grand views and those rocks...oh how much easier this is than those climbs… then with The Captain crossing the bridge into Harper’s Ferry…then I’m hiking over Roan Mountain hoarfrost gathered on every blade of grass…then the old AT that used to reach my same destination today… that 10 mile round trip hike that I’ve hiked more than a dozen times. I’m sure this newest path will be repeated nearly that many times soon enough. Reaching the forest road I notice a new blaze has been placed on a tree for better direction. More branches laid down at the next turn back into the woods so one doesn’t just keep walking the forest road and miss their turn. What sun I had is now gone as clouds draw in. Angels Rest stand tall to my left view and follows me as I draw closer to the ridge line. Since I travel by myself I can take whatever path my heart desires and I choose to take the old route of the AT up behind the shelter. It’s straight the heck up and was a blue blazed path for the water source. With this snow on it will be a good workout.
Stepping over the brush and undergrowth I take my time and make sure of footing. Leaving the trail and getting hurt wouldn’t be a good thing. At least it’s only a short distance. More ice now, all that rain we had yesterday must have froze at this elevation. Shards of ice lay on top of the crusted snow. It’s a trail of glass if only the sun had been shining it would have glistened like crystal. Woo Wee I’m atop. The wind greets me. Dark ominous clouds line the sky over the fields. Hummm no Symms Gap for me but maybe I’ll just walk on out to the radio tower area for a look around. Will give me another mile round trip and some more views. Walking around the front of the shelter I startle a couple of hikers still buried deep in their sleeping bags. It’s 10:30! One raises up as I say hey fellas. I don’t stop to chat. Too cold for me to hangout for long anyways as I’ve worked up a sweat and will chill quickly in this wind. A quick walk over the fields and views of Angels Rest and WVa are always grand. The walk to the tower was fun with the crunchy snow. I dare not tarry that front will catch me if I do. A quick about face and the race is on for the protection of the south side of the mountain. Those hikers never did rise as I returned by. Hope they are ok.  Voice are heard soon after I head off the ridge. Four fellas are on their way up and have stopped to access their options. They ask if I had views out and I reply just as you see here but a front is coming and you may be caught in it soon. Frozen flakes fall now. They liked my car tag HIKUPIT and notice my many patches on my pack. I do love patches. Happy trails fellas. Clipping on along my knees are feeling it going down. Surgery knee wants to tighten and cause hamstring cramps so I have to stop every so often for a quick stretch. They told me getting old sucks guess this is what they were talking about. But it ain’t stoppin this ol gal. Before long I’m back to the forest road. The front is upon me now. Pellets of frozen snow bounce off me and the trail. I bet those fellas are in the shelter taking cover up there. Wake up sleepy heads.
My hike is nearing its end only 10 minutes and I will reach the road. In fact I can see it once I rounded this last switch back. Another memory has been made.","Poco Rd

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607577,"When the sun shines you better take advantage. A window of warmth between two rain days, let’s go. And that we did. I planned a short little hike to stretch my legs and to gather any that might need a trail fix such as me. I picked Sandra up for a shuttle over to Bland and we hope others might join in at the trail head. Harry has confirmed he shall be coming in from Bluefield. 

Blue skies have me in shorts today with back up in my pack. Pushing spring I am. “I see I have overdressed” Sandra thinks but I assure her it is always colder on the other side of the mountain and I may have jumped the gun. And sure enough the skies cover quickly as we pass along the white fence rows of White Gate prison. High 40s become low 40s and 37 degrees when I park. 

A black VW bug pulls in, It’s Harry AND SABER! His little doggie is back for some more hiking fun. We have the area all to ourselves. And nice that the state has poured a fresh layer of gravel in the entry of the parking. That’s two for two on maintenance. 
 
Saber is quick to introduce herself to Sandra while I quickly get some long johns on before we start. When I turn around Sandra is bundled like Ralphie’s little brother on the Xmas Story. Ha and she even has the red gloves. It wasn’t quite that cold. Wasn’t even frost on the ground. 
 
Stepping into the woods I announce today is my 1 year anniversary of my knee surgery. Ha, How about that? And dismal was my second walkabout to test things out. Come on folks let keeping testing.
 
Water fills the trail. Foot prints sunk in the muck from the last hiker that passed this way. Checking the trail log some NOBOs have been by. Ugg I sure wouldn’t want to be lugging along over the last few weeks or months even. Rain Rain Rain. Wind Wind Wind.  
 
Which brings us to one of several blow downs. They are new as no distinct route has been made yet. We each pick our own best route. Saber leads Harry right into the thick. Easy girl.
  Up and around the bend Trent’s store spotted. Harry stopped in on his way in for some trail snacks.  Says the local fellas were in for a visit over their morning coffee.  They liked his vintage bug as well. Harry also has checked out the other area ‘hiker’stops. One in Crandon and another off 52 in Bland. 
 
Heading down toward the falls the small water runs offs are all full so rock hopping is necessary. The rhododendron tunnels make for very wet trail. Harry has to take a high route through the woods to keep his shoes from sucking off his feet. Have a dog on a leash makes this quite the task. 
 
Roaring waters, I wonder how full the falls will be? The cut off brings us all back together. Sandra is several layers down now after warming up. Sunlight begins to filter thru to find us. Lead me on….
 
Louder and Louder, water rushes by, our voices going up to be heard between us all. Saber runs free to get the first drink. Debris lies upon the rock ledges from previous water height. Still up our walking area is less but quite enjoyable. Look fisherman! When did they come in? Casting their lines toward the tumbling current we hope they pull one out for show. 
 
We gather on the rock ledge for a team photo from the top. I had pondered going around to the bottom section but so much debris I defer for another time. A quick snack over trail talk. We are cooling quick standing here so we better head on back. 
  Light skies lend to a lovely hike out. Trail stories and funny times from here and there.  Hard to believe this place has the name of Dismal. It’s quite the opposite as it was a dandy day. Just Dandy.","Rt. 606 Kimberling Creek

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607931,"Every step on the trail is a good step, a step in the Right direction, no matter how many times you rewalk it. The Rice Fields seems to have a draw. 
Sandra suggested it last week. Quote: it's not that hard and has a wonderful view. I'm read for the climb. Now she speaks quick without knowledge of its re-route due to the Mountain Valley Pipeline. Trail moved to the other side of the mountain lessens the mileage by half and provides a much easier trek with graded switchbacks. Bonnie was like you don't remember that old trail of 10 miles? We aren't doing 10 are we? Nope. Short and sweet. Just like you two!
We have two newbies joining today, a coworker of Anna's named Christy and her daughter Sarah. They are from Fort Chiswell and excited about hiking the AT. Jared is back too, ready to see a new section. Come on Larry we gonna be late. 
On the drive over we can see white ridge lines. Snow! still hanging on from last weeks flurry of weather. We shall take advantage of this forecasted 50-60 degree day with no rain and lots of sun. I can't wait.
Just 3 weeks ago I was hiking this by myself. Snow at the top and me racing the wind and rain. And now look I have a healthy number looking to see this section for the first time....so I better take it nice and slow so they will come back. Ha. 
Christy and Sarah jump in behind me while the boys gather up the middle and the girls sweep the rear. Sandra's little bell jingles to sound hear location and who knows maybe scare a bear. Head down she is always wanting to follow someone's boots and Bonnie is her lead today.
Chugging along our train winds up this sunny side of the mountain. Giving some trail history I inform them how the old trail used run and how volunteers helped move it to this location. And here is some of the trail I helped with. Sarah asks all the questions I remember asking when I was first introduced to the trail. Where does it start? How long is it? How do you know where to go? You can follow me today but see those white blazes? that's the way!
How far are we from the top? Not far. Come on fellas help me move this downed limb. I've been kicking lots of small limbs from the path. Some other blow downs will need sawing but this one might be able to moved. Step aside Lead dog this is mans work. Jared and Larry put their muscle and ingenuity to the test. Heave Ho, Twist, Timber. Minor maintenance complete. Be sure and tell Jim.
Here's the snow and oh by the way we could walk up this old cut, it comes in right behind the shelter. It's the old water source route. To the trail we stick and wind out to the edge of the woods. This entry to the field is more dramatic anyway. 
Blazed fence posts, wide open space, ridge meets sky, and we step in to it. High clouds rest scattered in the blue background. We stand one foot in West Va and one in Virginia. We are on the state line. It's beautiful every time. 
Winds are stirring but not enough to have us retreat to the shelter. Thank you sunshine, we seat for a bit and have some snacks. Say there's the cat bag. It's back with Sandra holding her array of lunch treats. Sharing what's in our food bags like grade schoolers trading up for that better item, we also devour our views. 
Y'all like it? Bonnie asks. You like hiking? Newbies vote yes. That's good cause we gotta hike out. 
Jared has calculated we have walked 2.6 miles. Perfect I will keep my reputation going for 'adding' more miles. What's a few more steps.
The fellas lead us out while I switch places for sweeper to visit with the short girls. Several others are hiking in too. This new path has now become the regular path. So glad I am sharing it with these friends now.","Pocohantas Road

Larry’s van turned to shuttle wagon starting with a quick trip to the Dublin Airport to retrieve Harry. He has flown in from Bluefield airfield catching the best bird’s eye view in quite some time. Blue skies!!!!

The Leprechaun Limousine filled to almost max capacity at the Christiansburg park-n-ride. All aboard!!! Chicago passengers please take your seats and put all luggage to the back.  Watch your step retired person. Please take this complementary tiara so everyone knows you are OFFICIALLY RETIRED! All aboard…Side car passengers take your green tokens and proceed as we leave this station.

Arriving at the McAfee parking the L-Train fits in one of the few spots left for prime parking. I’m sure the middle ground will clog soon and turn late arrivals away to the overflow down the road. 

Some introductions must be made as we have some new hikers to the mix. Alexis, another coworker of Anna’s, and we have the Chicago Brew Crew, Nancy and Carl, all are excited to hike this local favorite.

It’s GREEN out. If you failed to wear green here’s your green beads. Have No fear Lead dog’s here, no one’s getting pinched in this group. Next year we’ll have to get Alexis’s homemade shirts….”I’m not Irish but kiss me anyway”!

Crossing the road we hit the trail for the knob. Groups quickly forms and by the time we reach the kiosk and option to cut off on the fire road Larry has his sights set on taking the ‘easy’ route to the top. “Who’s with me?” Carl and Harry peel out of ranks for the old man route. Jared and TJ have already hiked clean out of sight down the AT shouting back they’ll see us at the ‘sign’.  Ok ladies you’re with me.

Taking the actual trail up is the preferred route of this bunch. Nancy came to hike the AT and that she intends to do. She can tell Carl all about it, while I’m sure Larry is giving his own guided tour.  

Bonnie and I have Nancy pinned between us telling her all about the trail and our love for it and how many times we’ve walked this path.  Anna gives Alexis her perspective too.  Already there is talk of where can we hike next. 

It's a cool morning but the sun  has us smiling and happy to be out.  I am surprised at the early birds that are already coming back from their summit trip.  Each eager to tell us what a grand view they had.  We even met a few couples who stayed at the shelter last night. Burr 20 degrees I bet. They are still bundled. 

Stopping at both shelters we show our newbies what is provided protection on the trail. Privy and a place to bunk. The Catawba Mountain shelter has a bear box to help hiker keep their food safe.  Please pack it out folks this is not a garbage disposal. 

TJ and Jared are waiting here for us.  I point to the ridge above and bet the old guys are somewhere up there.  Nancy says glad Carl's there than here, he might not have made it so good over these rocks and uneven ground.  He's a flatlander.

Working up a sweat we all drop a shirt with some down to shorts.  I was determined to wear mine.  Sun's out legs out. 

Reaching the junction with the fire road we all regroup.  Its official trail time to the top.  Let the climbing begin.  Graded trail with switchbacks help with the accent.  The young bucks are probably at the top by now with the young girls close behind.  Come on ladies let's march past these last big rocks and beat the men. 

Bonnie keeps Nancy posted on just how close we are. The stunted underbrush is a good sign you’re at the top.  See there's the sign.  Hootie Hoot.

Wide open, wow, this is wonderful.  Wew, now let's set down. She has worked hard to get here.  This is Catawba valley, and that ridge there is where the AT continues north.  Farther out you can see Tinker Cliffs, the white rock ledges can be seen from way over here and if you look way off to the distance that's Peaks of Otter.  The trail passes close by there.  

Come you guys get on up here we have much to share.  Carl is not liking these heights. This is as far as I go he says finding a place to rest away from the knob’s edge.  

McAfee is ours today.  Come all let’s gather for a group photo.  Happy St.Patty's Day and Hurray to Bonnie!!!Officially retired.  I hope our green be seen for miles. Speaking of miles how far have we hiked Jared?  He has the mileage tracker on his phone.  I had posted this trek was 7 miles but checked my memory last night with Awols trail guide which calculates this at 7.4 miles.  Oh no! Harry says the sign he read at the bottom saying 3.9 to McAfee.  Are we getting more of these shady Martha Miles?  Jared clocked 4 miles by way of actual blazes.  Uh...7? 7.4 that's close.....right? Wrong!!!!  You can't trust those signs, gadgets, just keep following me.

Taking our turn, its time to let the new arrivals have theirs.  So how shall we all return, fire road? Just how far is this road exactly?  We will never know as our tracking device is headed for the parking lot via the AT.  

Our gaggle in green begins back down.  More and more hikers come up. Say are you guys thru hiking? I have the eye for most that are, they have that look.  Wait I have something for you.  Fruit and fun.  Here have some grapes, this orange and Happy St Patty's Day.  These green beads will bring you magic.  Chief is happy to get is set I place around his neck.  His hiking friend from Germany, well was a bit leery of my approach and of my English.  County twang and German thang probably don't mix.  Abracadabra and ya ba dab a do.  Good luck trail friends.

More green magic was spread when I spot a little tike leading her family our way.  Here my dear you need some beads and your sissy too. Enjoy your hike.

Down the trail we are back to our decision point. Anna and Alexis waiting on the old folks at the fire road.  TJ and Jared have hiked on.  Road is the vote, it's all down no matter how you stack it.  

The steady pounding of long strides has the old knee talking to me.  Remnants of many past miles still paining.  Come on old woman, Larry says, I'm gonna beat you off this mountain.  

I have to say I was ready to see that fire gate at the bottom but it was along side the L-train not way behind. Haha.  But please don't make me run across this road. 

One by one our train of green arrives.  So conductor just how many miles was this hike? Lord who knows, the miles grew grew, way up to 9.5. I'd say ask Pinocchio but it's a leprechaun kinda day.","Rt. 311

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609308,"When the trail calls you must answer. Not only to hike but to help maintain. Our very own Slim Jim has asked for assistance with his section over near Gloseclose/Marion.  He has camped out last night after working one side of Glade Mountain. We shall meet him on the other side for instructions.


Cold wind parts the field by the Settlers Museum parking area. Quick get a wool hat on before it blows out of your hands. Wears my gloves, wears my phone, Bonnie has retired and lost her mind. This work crew is ready Jim, what’s the detail?

Safety first! Sign in please. As a volunteer we must heed to the ATC regulations and release them of any harm we might do to ourselves. Don’t run with scissors! Where’s the chainsaw I love to run a chainsaw! NOT…only certified sawyers allowed. Jim got his certificate last week but will save that heavy work for another time.  Handing out pruning nippers and loppers he will take care of the hand saw.  

Walking up the settler’s road we will connect to the AT blazes just past the old home place. Jim has visions of moving a small section of the trail from a powerline area to this location to provide a nicer walk for hikers and visitors. 

Reaching the AT Jim gives instruction to prune anything which impedes the path. Rhododendrons watch out cause here we come. Briars better beware. Limbs lay down the saws a comin to cut. 

Snip snip, the trail becomes littered with branches. Don’t cut those buds Sandra warns. Those will become wonderful flowers come summer. TJ and Jared clear the bigger blow downs.  Anna and Jim lop off wildly branches. Bonnie, Sandra and I sweep the trail clear of clipped debris.  This green tunnel will be the best section around. 

Working our way up the mountain we hardly notice we have been climbing. This is the way to do it Sandra says. You don’t get winded and I’m not even breaking a sweat. Larry should have come on this one Jared says. 

Chatfield Shelter will be our break spot. We’ll remain protected from the wind and have a dry place to set down for lunch. Jim, Ann and TJ painted the inside of this shelter last year and see some of their board work will need some more repairs on the next trip. The privy had some blow downs on top so the fellas cleared them off. One less task for when the shitter will be pumped come July.  Uhhh I don’t thing I wanna be around for that work detail.

We met a few hikers making their way to Maine and they thanked Jim for some Coca-Cola magic from yesterday. Be sure to eat at The Barn once you hit town. Buffet and home cooking!

Time to climb the Mighty Glade…the Mountain makes its own weather. Wind picks up with falling snow pellets. March Madness on the Mountain. Layers go on as we pick up the pace. Nothing really to maintain but our warmth. Open woods with switchbacks before we tuck back in to more rhodies. Snip Snip Snip. Look at that view. We catch the clouds part with rays of sun casting shadows along Big Walker Mountain. Jim has the vantage point in prime shape after he cut all the big growth down to really see out. A very nice etched wooden sign marks the spot. 

Shall we go on up to the summit? Hell yeah we gotta get in the full mileage. Jared what’s the count? 3.3 from this very spot. What? How far to the summit Jim? Half a mile one way. This trip supposed to be 6.6. The Glade, it makes its own miles too apparently. 

One last briar section to nip back and our major work will be complete. See there the top is marked with a location sign handmade by Jim. Big red lettering, Glade Mountain, Elev 4093 ft. You have to have a sign to mark the top!  

Our return was quick and self-rewarded. Just look at how nice this section is. Free and clear of debris. A volunteer trail crew must have just come through here.  Maintenance of the Mighty Glade is complete.","Settlers Muesem, Rt. 615

Lead dog,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609927,"Ah spring is in the air. Let’s stretch our legs out a bit more this time and pull off close to a ten mile hike. Its easy walking folks…trust me… wink wink!


Bonnie pulls in right on time 8:10 sharp and we’re off to meet Anna and TJ over at the dismal falls parking area, Kimberling Creek.  I love the drive down Rt. 42 toward Bland. Farm land glistens green between Walker Mountain and another.  White rail fence lines the correctional facility. If I ever had to go to prison this would be the place I’d hope to attend. Haha If you can’t get your mind right in this location your missin out. 


The kids are here waiting on us. We load up with them leaving my car here for us to hike back to. It’s only a 15 minute drive to our trail head.  See that ridge we’ll be along it most of the day. Rolling hills!

Anna has researched my journals to double check that this will be new trail for them. Bonnie is unsure not positive she has or hasn’t hike some or all of this. I think she has at some point but either way this will knock it out just the same. 

Stepping on the trail just a few yards in our first sign says 4 ¼ to Rt. 608. That’s accurate. And if you look to your left I’ve had a birthday party here before. What? Yep. Long ago the Dotson 2 provided me with cake and candle oh and a toast.  It was a cold February day. We hike from the 608 road to the point and back. Snow was falling and we were celebrating. 

Trotting down the trail we chatter on about other sections the kids need to hike to connect their dots. South to Damascus sounds like will be next. But first we must continue north today to Kimberling.

The trail winds in and out and around the edge of the mountain. Bonnie says it reminds her of Rock Castle Gorge but without the gorge. Lol. You guys going back there for a back to back again this year she asks? Oh I don’t know if I need to do all that again for a while I say.  TJ ‘s ready to head back for some fishin!

Before long we’ve come to Jenny Knob Shelter. It’s off the trail some so we don’t go down to check it out. Smoke from a camp fire looms, must be from a spot down close to the road. Lickskillet Holler. Sounds like a dinner should be here. A hostel does reside, their mark is panted on the road with an arrow for the direction. 

Let’s climb this next knoll and have lunch at the top, will be closer to the halfway point of the day and we won’t be climbing on a full stomach. I hate that feeling.

How far is the knoll? Rolling hills right Martha?!!  Bonnie tightens up her hat and gets to scratchin. 

Switchbacked and graded nicely this will be our only ‘real’ climb of the day. About half way up I send the kids on to the top to find us a nice place for lunch. Bonnie and I will be right on….if she don’t kick my ass first.

Cresting the top I remember having a lunch stop here on these very logs.  I hear the kids just up the way. Bonnie is a switchback or two behind me. Ah yes the powerlines, I had forgotten about them. Lunch is served.

Powerline!? Sticks in the air Bonnie shouts. Rolling Hills My Ass! My feet hurt. But I’ll make it, I’ll have to. Sandra would have made it too she says, cause she’d had to too. 

Just a few more miles left. It’s all downhill.  Warm humidity has us sweating but loving it. Beats the wind. Clouds come and go with patches of pure sunshine burning on my neck. Look for the fields Anna that will mean we are close to the finish. 

A long stretch of ridge line has us scattered a bit but we regroup periodically and take off again. Bonnie says there needs to be more white blazes. A good path but what if I got confused by another trail. There were some briars back there too, where’s our nippers?

Anna look for the big oak tree that’s a sign for the fields too. We can take a photo by one of the nice trail signs there. They disappear around the next bend. 

Snake Snake, Turkey Turkey. Animals let us know they are out here fluttering in the bushes and slithering across the trail. The big oak greets us at the field’s edge. Under growth is spring green. Blood root and violets. Oh what a nice camp spot. There’s the trail sign. A nice colorful metal AT plate stamped to a post. Smile its Spring!

Creek sounds come in ear shot the end is near. Chainsaws ring to the north. Maintenance is happening down toward Dismal. Cut it boys!  Crossing the suspension bridge Anna and TJ make sure to walk up and connect their blazes. Their section is complete and so is Bonnie’s.","Rt. 611 Crandon
