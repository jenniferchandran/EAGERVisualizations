Canary,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612130,"And so the 2019 AT Section Hike itinerary planning begins! I plan to hike for 21 days in July and anticipate being in the middle of the thru-hiker bubble. I will be starting in North Adams, MA and attempt to complete all of VT through Kinsman Notch, North Woodstock, NH (208.2 miles). I have purchased the AT Guide every other year since 2009. My 2019 Guide has just arrived and I've discovered that the entire trail is now no longer 2189.8 miles long but 2192.0 miles in length. The additional 2.2 miles have all been created south of my hike and thus I credit myself for an additional 2.2 miles that I did for free! LOL Let the Itinerary obsession commence!!!",,View Entry,"Jan 23, Wed",0

Canary,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614171,"Hitting the gym with my personal trainer for that all important exercise! Ironically, the personal trainer is located just feet from the Ice Age Trail. Working hard to run agility faster and climb bigger mountains!!! ⛰
UPDATE: Sadly, for the previous decade of AT Section Hikes, I have always practice hiked for 4-6 months prior to my Section Hike. Usually 3-4 times a week, always increasing the weight I carry and the length of our hikes. This year, I am 100% focused on improving my Agility game having gone 6 weeks of trialing in a row throughout March and April. Many trials are planned for May and June. Each Agility trial day typically sees me with 30,000 steps on my Fitbit so I come home exhausted with no time or ambition to do any hiking. Practice hikes have dropped to roughly one a week with only a 10 lb pack. With only 7 weeks remaining prior to this year's Section Hike I am growing worried. My only physical preparation has been with the Personal Trainer several times a week and multiple weekly agility training sessions & trials with two dogs. I NEED to loose 10 lbs and get out hiking!!! Too many goals, not enough time, and too much overtime at work! Voi! Voi!",,View Entry,"Apr 02, Tue",0
Canary,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614173,"In a desperate attempt to get ""some"" hiking in during one of my out-of-town agility trials, the dogs and I managed a hike at a local preserve. This preserve is amazingly tucked in between Interstate I-294 and I-55 in the heart of Chicago. You'd NEVER know the interstate system was so close.",,View Entry,"Apr 05, Fri",0

Canary,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614174,"I've had several requests for the link to my online journal for my Appalachian Trail Adventure. I've been on this adventure since 2009 but recommend reading the my journals in order of 2011, 2009, 2010, 2012-2019 to follow the trail from the Southern Terminus northbound (NoBo). Please note that not all of 2018 is loaded yet. It will be within the next week and I will let me know when it is fully available. I've had a lot of questions about hiking the trail with dogs. I have done hundreds of miles with dogs from 2011-2016. I no longer hike with dogs due to the dangers involved on the trail for the dogs.",,View Entry,"Apr 23, Tue",0
Canary,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614175,"I have finished uploading my 2018 AT Section Hike online journal. There are only 955 pictures! My 2019 itinerary planning is in full swing. 2018 is all of NJ, NY, CT, & MA. July of 2019 will be all of VT and some of NH.
5/21/2019 Update. Only about 1/3rd of my itinerary is complete, there has been no practice hiking in the past 3 weeks, and not one single piece of hiking gear has been pulled out of the hiking closet. My back is officially against the wall. If I am to pull this year's Section Hike off with only 7 weeks to go, I have to focus my goals on my hike. Putting Agility in 2nd place as one of my goals is going to be very, very hard.",,View Entry,"May 01, Wed",0
