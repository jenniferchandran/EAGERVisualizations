Treetrunk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608455,"Living in Australia makes for some added complexities with the logistics of my thru hike attempt.
I have the excitement and trepidation of travelling to a different culture.
There is the sense of regret and sadness of knowing that I will shortly leave my loved ones. There is the knowledge they will be so physically far away. The Pacific Ocean is a fairly wide ditch to jump over if I need to head home in a hurry.
And there is the need for a visa!
This is not as straightforward as I would have hoped but it is one of the challenges to be met.
Normal tourist travel for many visitors to the USA means a visa upon entry .. for 3 months maximum. 
3months for a thru hike is doable by some but not a realistic time for me. I’m figuring I’ll need right on 6months.
Once the 3 month visa limit was not too difficult to overcome... travellers could skip over to Canada or Mexico for a few days then return and get another 3 months. 
Alas those days are past!
Instead I must attend an interview at the US embassy or consulate, provide details of my trip, prove I am a bonafide traveller, pay a fee, and generally vouch for my authenticity. There are no guarantees but provided all goes well a 6month visa may be granted
It’s a sign of our times and the need to be secure.
For me that meant lengthy interstate travel to Sydney, overnight stay which turned into a week, and of course the “interview “
I was nervous, particularly as there was no guarantee I would get a visa.
On the day I arrived early and presented at the 10th floor of a large downtown Sydney Office. I joined a queue and went through a very thorough security screening. I removed my watch, my phone and all metal objects.
Then a guard whisked me up another 40 floors or so to the formal consulate.
As it turns out the interview was not as intimidating as I imagined it would be.
I was asked why I wanted to go to the USA for 6months. When I said I wanted to attempt the Appalachian Trail the officer seemed a tad incredulous that in my physical shape and vintage I would actually be contemplating such a venture.
“You mean the whole thing?” He said.
But I pleaded my honest intentions and that was it!
“Congratulations!” He said. “You’ve been granted a Visa to visit the United States!”
So that’s one task I have ticked off my list to get done.The drawing I did as I was walking along the entrance to Sydney Harbour.",,View Entry,"Mar 20, Wed",0
Treetrunk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608486,"I am not having a shakedown hike!
Not withstanding I totally agree with the benefits of taking a trail run. It’s a chance to try on the pack with all the equipment I will use; to test it out; to understand my expectations; to find my right combination of food requirements; and so to dial in what’s right for me.
The trouble is that it is so darned hot where I am in Australia right now, the Antipodean terrain and vegetation is unique and totally different from what I expect to find in Georgia!
We’ve not had decent rain in months now and forget snow or ice!
So I’ll be heading out with a new pack, new sleeping gear, new clothes, new shoes, new socks all of which I won’t wear or try out until I arrive at Amicalola Falls.
I do have memories of past back packing trips so have a pretty good idea of what I need, plus with all the advice and descriptions of gear on the internet I think I will be making some reasonable decisions.
But for this trip anyways a shakedown hike is not going to happen.
Silly maybe, but I figure if everything turns disastrous there will always be the outfitters at Neel’s Gap.
Hopefully I won’t be one of those ditching their shoes in the limbs of the tree there!

Treetrunk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609362,"It’s amazing how much I can get done (and not get done) the day before and even the hours before I have a deadline. When there is a month to go before crunch time I can be all “ho hum” thinking I’ll have plenty of time. Then the target date gets close and frantic activity emerges!


It was no different this time although I did make a conscientious effort to improve my innate ability to put off what could be done tomorrow.


Lists were assembled, reorganised, added to, rejected, completed and finally ticked off. It was such a flurry of activity.
My visa status meant that I was flagged for questioning a number of times upon entering the USA. But all up, the process went remarkably smoothly. In these times I support more security, safety checks and interviews... it may take a little longer to get in but that’s a restriction I’m happy to accommodate.


Once in Dallas I was met by an amazing friend John. I haven’t seen him in 28+ years and I think we both were thinking of what we looked like back then and not what we were now. We had heads of hairs then, not chrome domes, and in my case I was many kilos lighter! I walked straight past and it was only when I called out “ John, John” that we made contact and surveyed how we had patina-ed over the years.


I had a few days in Dallas to meet so many dear friends that I had not seen in so long. It was a chance to reconnect, remember and retell old tales with superb embellishments!


I have been so lucky to have met them all.


My next leg was a flight to Atlanta where I was met by another running buddy John where more great tales were regaled.


From there it’s on to Amicalola Falls!


My visa stamp provides a definitive time limit for my AT attempt. I have until September 27 to get my walk done. Here’s hoping I can meet the deadline with days to spare!","Australia

Treetrunk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609436,"I was nervous with anticipation to be on my way. 


And the time passed quickly. Before I knew my host John was driving me through the picturesque Northern Georgia farmscapes with all its classic timber barns and agricultural scenes.


My plan was to start at the AT registration which is actually 8 miles downhill from the official southern terminus of the trail at Springer Mountain. The folks there request that hikers start there rather than drive the dirt access road nearby and I was fine with that. 


What is an extra 8 miles when I already have 2190 to go?


At the AT registration centre I met with Bob who set me up with my formal through hiker red triangular disk - I’m # 1789 . Lots of hikers in front of me and more to follow no doubt. I think there must have been over 60 register yesterday but less numbers today.


I had my portrait at the arch then nothing more to do than put one foot in front of the other and be on my way. It was 12:46.


Weather was perfect-sunny, crisp and no forecast of rain for a few days yet.
From there it was up and up and up with a few downs thrown in to make it interesting.


I met my first fellow hiker 2 miles in half way up a steep rise. Backed against a tree was a huge pack with an equally huge bedroll and tarp strapped atop that, and then 15yards in front of that an equally large man who was panting and sweating profusely. I asked what’s up and he said he’d got half way up the rise then his legs gave way and he started going backwards. If it wasn’t for the tree he would have rolled back down the mountain!


We chatted for awhile. He was here “to loose 100lbs”. But after his out of control reversing down the hill he was having second thoughts of completing a thru hike! I gave what encouragement I could whilst quietly thinking that we hadn’t yet even made it to the official start!!


From there I pushed forward being passed my a number of fast fleet footed younger ones and being surprisingly able to pass a number myself.


My pack felt good, confidence was okay, but just before the summit my foot snagged a tree root and when I freed it up my leg went into spasms of cramp. It seemed every muscle group took a turn. I was in agony for a while there. Leg cramps are something I have a trouble with. I’m not sure if it’s not enough hydration, too much hydration or a combination of both. Anyways it is a sign to take a breather and relax so that’s what I did.


I made the summit at just past 5pm. The climb itself had taken 4 hours which I’m told is a reasonable pace.


I spent a whiles contemplating my adventure at the formal first white blaze of the AT .


Just below the summit is a hut and camping area and I headed for that. There were about 20 tents scattered in the scrub, 4 or so folks in the shelter and even a fellow Australian! Great comradeship. 


But I was tired so I headed to my tent as the sun was setting. I could feel my legs cramping up again. It was my body telling me I needed to rest so that’s what I had to do!","Amicalola Falls

Today’s weather was absolutely perfect for hiking. Crisp in the morning, then in the afternoon sunny but not too warm. And no rain.


I had had a tough night. My legs took it on turns to cramp and then when they decided to combine I’d had enough!! But with meditation they settled down and I slept soundly. I was tired for sure.
Packing up was a slow affair - I didn’t hit the trail until 9:40 and decided that I was content to take it slow. 


First stop was the Springer Mountain parking lot and there was trail magic! Banana cup cakes and they were scrumptious! As a double bonus some missionaries were even offering prayers for safe travel.


From the lot it was a very gentle downhill path to Stover Creek shelter. The way was a carpet of damp moss, leaves and gentle loan - perfect for strolling so my legs rejoiced!!


A fellow hiker stopped me to encourage a side trip to Long Falls. His recommendation did not disappoint so I made an extended stay by cooking a miso soup whilst enjoying the view.


From there it was an easy climb up to Hawke Mountain Shelter where I am camping tonight. There are about 15 tents scattered around, a great water source and friendly conversation about the fire pit. Life is sweet.","Springer Mountain

Treetrunk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609631,"Trail Magic, to me, is when an unexpected gift is offered along the trail. It can come in many forms. It can be a simple smile from a passerby; an unintended serendipitous provision or a more elaborate planned event. Today I had all of these.


My plan for the day was quite ambitious. I wanted to see if I could push out a 16mile day to the Lance Creek campgrounds.  There is a requirement that hikers wishing to camp beyond that would need a bear canister which I don’t have. Logistically then it would mean a reasonable following day to Neels Gap after which bear canisters are not required.


However I do not have my trail legs yet! My pace is easy and defiantly dawdling at times. The truth is I like to take in the sights and breathe in the mountain air!


Anyways I thought I’d get up early see how I felt and do the best I could!


I managed to get up and going out from Hawke Mountain just on early dawn. The sun was just beginning to rise as I crested the first ridge before the first serious climb for the day: Sassafras Mountain. Surprisingly I found that climb relatively easy so perhaps I must be building some walking legs now. The path down was smooth so I was on a roll!


At the next gap which is a saddle between two mountains I came across my first trail magic. The US Army Corp had graciously parked a mobile water trailer there so I was able to get a needed top up of fluids. It was unexpected and whilst I had “camelled up” (ie drunk lots and lots of water prior) I was starting to get thirsty.
The walking was easy but I could feel my legs beginning to tire. Just after Gooch Gap a very steep hill ( later I worked out it was called Black Mountain) loomed steeply in front and I was thinking “Oh no, I’ve got to go over that ... I’m too tired”
But the trail gods must have been kind today because the path contoured around the mountain to Woody Gap.There I was met with seriously organised Trail Magic. Indiana Jones and her friend Blue Sky completed their section thru hike in 2000 and since then have been giving back to the trail by providing trail magic for one week at this spot every year. They come a long way to do this and to me that’s an amazing commitment. Thank youThey had all sorts of food and for me that was Pizza and coke.
It was just what I needed and I ambled along to Lance Creek with a good amount of time to set up camp and enjoy the fading evening light.Indiana Jones told me that 50 hikers had come through that day but for most of my day I was hiking alone. When I did meet people they were always smiling and this was trail magic of a simple form which kept me hiking positively.","Hawke Mountain Shelter

Treetrunk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609763,"My plan for the day was to walk from Neel’s Gap to Low Gap Shelter. According to Guthooks (which I don’t entirely trust after yesterday’s adventure with the brambles ) this was 11.2miles with an Ascent of 2899ft and a Descent of 2968ft. In other words a hilly day.


The esprit de corps in the bunkhouse was laughter, exuberant and satisfied after completing what was the first milestone for many of the Appalachian Trail.I took advantage of the coffee and sandwich supply in the shop then headed out at a bit after 9:00am. It was foggy with some slight misty moisture and enchanting conditions to walk in.The day started with a 750ft climb out of Neel’s Gap and I took it easy. My legs felt good and I am in rush to race as that’s a recipe to get an injury.Coming down into Tesnatee Gap a trail runner coming the opposite way told me that I’d like the Trail Magic waiting for me. He wasn’t kidding.Bobby and Mitzi have been coming to this spot since 2014 to provide sustenance and fellowship for the thru hikers. Spread on several trestle tables with red checker table clothes were all sorts of beverages and foods including pulled pork, greens, slaw and the most amazing tasting brownies. In a semi circle were camp chairs to relax in. 


I certainly had a great time and my belly was full!Which was good because straight after that was a 500ft climb up Wildcat Mountain. Mitzi had a pickup truck loaded with backpacks and she offered to slack pack my gear up to Hogpen Gap thus avoiding the climb. At this stage I’m not ready to do that although it was tempting!


Descending from the climb intro Hogpen Gap was more Trail Magic - cold drinks! I felt so lucky.


From there, it was fairly gentle ups and downs all the way to Low Gap. I took my time and thoroughly enjoyed the easy day.","Neels Gap

Treetrunk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610068,"Hemp Juice


A couple of years back I was chatting to my daughter who told of a chemist who could legally supply the oil from the marijuana plant. It reportedly has some surprising medicinal effects including pain relief, reducing anxiety and depression, suppressing cancer symptoms, alleviating acne, minimising epilepsy, MS, and heart disease. The list goes on. No doubt there will be new medical studies that find all sorts of new discoveries some perhaps not so beneficial.


All of this was news to me. Initially I was quite skeptic although. I am a conservative at heart and I went to bed that night with very mixed emotions. But in the morning I did some research and learnt that Cannabidoil better known as CBD has no mind altering effects and indeed all sorts of medical professionals were quite enthusiastic about its therapeutic properties. So then I had quite a change of mind. 


I even then thought that there might be some ways to invest in this and went so far as to research small cap health care companies that were participating in the sector and might be worth investing in. My financial genius partner was most intrigued and was quick to actually buy shares of one. 


A week later the stock price doubled in value, then up it went again and again! It seems I was not the only one to be intrigued by the potentials of CBD and the value to be had in investing in its potential.


Of course at this point there is little connection between this tale and my Appalachian Trail through hike.


My plan for Day 6 was to hike from Low Gap Shelter to the Old Cheese Factory camping site. It had been a wet rainy night and the showers had sprayed mud all over my tent. Packing up was not fun. But once done I made good time along an easy gradient path to Blue Mountain then down to Unicoi Gap. The sun was doing its best to burn off the mist, it was tiring exercise and I was becoming famished and thirsty.


What joy to meet “Magic Mike” at the parking lot there. He was providing an array of donuts from a huge box and to top it off he even asked if I’d like to sample the refreshments in a chest filled with an assortment of beers on ice. What a trail angel!


Anyways they were local beers and he suggested an IPA. This is a beefed up version of a bitter beer and it sure tasted nice. I was thirsty and when I was offered another I could hardly refuse. Amazingly it tasted quite well with the lemon curd donut I had in the other hand.


I didn’t take too much notice of the beer variety at first but as I started to relax I cast a closer eye over the label. It was called “The Hempora” and was a Hemp Pale Ale, brewed presumably with hops infused with some form of CBD. It seems that the use of cannabidoil has expanded from medical products to the brewery!


Well I don’t remember too much of my climb up Rocky Mountain or my descent to Indian Grave Gap and then the climb back up to Old Cheese Factory campsite although it was very steep and strenuous.


Now in my opinion I reckon that there will need to be many more studies to prove  if cannabidoil actually does reduce anxiety, depression, acne,joint pain and it’s many other alleged benefits. However there is no doubt that many people do swear by the stuff.


As for its use in beer, well I did rest happy and content that night. It had been a good day.


As for the cannabidoil company we invested in? Well, like all good small cap stocks it rose quickly in price and then fell down again just as quick. But it is still showing a healthy profit!!","Low Gap Shelter

I hadn’t stayed in a shelter yet and didn’t have any plans to do so however the weather turned from wet to wetter and my plans changed.


My previous days campsite selection at Low Gap shelter had taught me an important lesson : avoid cleared earthen sites because when it rains they turn into muddy swamps that spray all sorts of mullock over the tent walls and ultimately all over everything when pack up time comes along.Thus I was very selective about where I pitched my tent at the old cheese factory site. My setting was comfy grass and moss. It worked a treat. When it rained during the night the moisture drained quickly away without mud splash back and my tent was as clean as can be. Of course everything was still sopping wet!
There is no actual trace of the old Cheese Factory ...I’m guessing it was an old diary farm that has now since long wasted away.
I made good time up the next mountain which was Tray then called in briefly to the shelter where I cooked breakfast.


More ups and downs followed and it was only a short way into this that it started to misty rain. I didn’t put my rain jacket on at first until it dawned on me that the rain was getting heavier and heavier. I was soaked thru when I finally did put it  on because did so be a wuss if I didn’t  I knew I’d get cold. From then on the downpour just increased and increased in intensity. The path became a stream and I wouldn’t have been surprised if the squirrels and other animals popped out and started to make enquires as to where Noah was.


My walking buddy for the day was “Montana Jesus” and we both mentally supported each other as we braved the tempest. I was quite surprised to arrive at Deep Gap Shelter to find only one other hiker. The weather showed no signs of abating and the easy decision was made to stay in the shelter. 


I had long since lost the bravery and gallantry required to face the elements. The shelter was a beauty with a closed in entry shielding the space from the rain and had an attic space that could take 6 bedrolls in a very very tight squeeze.


Over the next few hours more hikers trundled in, each looking more drained until we looked like a convention of disheveled drained rats. The shelter became full to overflowing. It works on a first come basis and folks were desperately looking for any way to get out of the torrent.


But with all the hard conditions, once in the shelter our comradeship was strong and spirits were high. 


I don’t know if I made too many friends during the night as my mattress made an incredibly loud and crinkly noise whenever I moved.   That aside I slept soundly dry and warm.My photo for the day is of a sign that says “Vista” There was definitely no vista to be had that day.","Old Cheese Factory Site

It’s a funny thing. Although I’m 63 and going on 64 I don’t feel old. I remember when I was a kid 64 seemed really really old. Paul McCartney and the Beatles even sang a song about that. 


When I get older losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a Valentine
Birthday greetings bottle of wine
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-fourThe words are so amusing because as the years go by the themes Increasingly seem to apply to me!Whilst getting older is an inevitable thing it’s not that bad ... in fact I’m having so much fun ...  especially on the trail. And honestly whilst I don’t feel like I’m 21 years old I do feel like I’m about 30. Interestingly over the last few days that’s the age group that seems to have predominated around me.


At the Deep Gap Shelter the first alarm went off at 5 to everyone’s annoyance. From there on folks were making all sorts of noises, grunts, snorts and rumbles as they got their packs in order and ready to hit the trail.


I somehow hit the middle of the bustle to leave and there was a general rush to get down the hill and towards civilisation at Hiawassee. Many characters in the group have started out way too fast or I’ll prepared and now all sorts of aches, pains, blisters and ailments are kicking in. 


I’m told that 60% don’t make it past here and the odds significantly decrease if you are less than 64! (Ooops 63)There was a round of relief when our wounded, hobbling caravan of drowned rats made it to Dicks Creek Gap and then just past that to the Top of Georgia Hostel. Once there a transformation took place.
We were all given hospital scrubs to wear and our clothes(?) were fumigated, and sent to the wash house. Then still clothed in our scrubs we hit the Mexican Restaurant in town. Yum!!


Well I disgraced myself yet again with “cerveza grande, muy frío”


Actually I said “beer on credit “ and the first waitress walked away.The food was great and the beer washed it down refreshingly.
That break made it really easy to teach the decision to stay on for another 24 hours. After all the ups and downs of the hills my muscles need a relax and a thorough rest.

The goal for today was to achieve a significant milestone in my through hike. I was to complete the first state of the AT: Georgia and pass into North Carolina.
The day started when I heard what I thought was someone’s digital alarm going off at 6:00am. It was a bird chirp sounding perfectly regular every 4 seconds. In reality it was actually a bird outside the open window singing in a digital manner.
I’m in a room with 3 occupied bunk beds and the sound was a signal for us all to start packing. We had to be ready for a shuttle that would take us back to the trailhead where we’d left off.


Top of Georgia Hostel, where I’m staying provided breakfast of coffee and cereal. The cereal was way to sweet for my taste so I had leftover salad that I’d saved from my trip to the salad bar in the grocery store yesterday. That filled me up which was a good thing because the day was going to be a very strenuous vertical challenge.

The call went out that our shuttle was about to leave. 9 plucky hikers, plus yours truly, piled in for the 5 minute ride back up the hill to Dicks Creek.
One hiker on board was “Music Man” who is doing the hike whilst being supported by “Magic Mike” who provides beer,donuts and pizza for him at every trailhead. He laughed about how more folks than him seem to get the beers! I did say thankyou to “Music Man” for the treats I’d had a couple of days back courtesy of his support system.


Once back at our start point for the day, Dicks Creek, our walking pecking order fell into a familiar pattern. The fast young ones sped on ahead, then there were the older regular walkers and then there was me, right at the back. Within 5 mins I was on my own and it was to be that way for most of the day.


Along the way I met fresh faces resting at the mountain springs that provide a water source and are a common meeting point. I also met others I hadn’t seen in 4-5 days. It seems we are all hiking at our own speed on the day but in the overall scheme of things we  are all at about the same pace.



The border is announced by a simple timber board nailed to a tree. It’s easy to miss but as I had seen pictures of it many times on YouTube I knew what to look for. Nearby is an iconic gnarled oak tree that I took the chance to sketch. What stories it could tell.
After the border I was in for a savage treat (?). Up until now the path did gentle switch backs. North Carolina had different ideas.It was straight up! Before too long I was at elevations higher than Blood Mountain which up until now had been our highest peak.


I ended my day around 5:30pm at Deep Gap Camping Area. I’d walked a little under 16 miles and was close to 5,000 feet of combined ascent. Tiring work.



There were pleasant camping sites near a stream and I found a leafy dry spot perfect for my tent. I spent a fair bit of time inspecting sites as I knew that tonight there was going to be a lot of rain and I wanted to stay dry.
Next chore was to hang my bear bag. Many of the tree limbs have the remnants of bear bag cords. Throwing a bear bag is not easy and mishaps are commonplace. That being done I settled in for the night. I was tired and it had been a long day.","Dicks Creek Gap

The rain started just before midnight and did not let up until noon. It was combined with thick fog so there was not too much to see. The day was pretty much a dogged determined effort to keep on walking despite the damp discomfort and freezing temperature brought on by a chilling wind. This may sound masochistic however after a while I even begin to enjoy.
Packing up was not enjoyable, but I am getting better at going most of my stuff into my backpack without it getting too wet. The conditions though are so very damp and it seems that the water gets into everything.


On days like this I wear shorts (which get wet through) a merino long sleeve t-shirt (which gets wet through) low socks and running shoes (which get wet through) and a Patagonia waterproof jacket (which is not waterproof and which also gets wet through) When I keep walking steadily I stay warm despite the wet.



The major climb for the day was Standing Indian Mountain. I took the side trail which goes to the actual summit and no surprises, there was nothing to see. Pride wise I was glad I had done it.I ended the day at Betty Creek Gap Campground and had the site to myself until in dribs and drabs most of the folks I had been seeing over the last few days turned up. In the end I would guess there was 25 or so. I think we all had the same plan. This is the nearest achievable site that is within a days walk from Franklin our next resupply town. We were all tired of the rain and want a little bit of town relief before we hit the trail again.","Deep Gap

One of the important things I do when setting up camp is to scope out where I can go during the night for the inevitable bathroom breaks ( of the minor kind). Imagine my surprise when I did get up at 2:30am and was about to let loose to realise that someone, in the middle of the night, had set up camp right on my target zone.! They had obviously come in after dark and things were really getting crowded at the campground.It makes it very hard to be quiet and discreet about these things.




The night did bring with it only one sprinkle of rain so packing up was so much easier in the morning. I was one of the first to leave but before long I was being past by a steady stream of hikers. We were all heading for our next important milestone being the first 100 mile marker. This happens just after the summit of Mt Albert which is another steep climb. It has a steel frame fire tower on it built in the 1950”s. Sadly due to vandalism the top platform is locked but it was a great view from the top landing.
The path down was gentle enough and I got going at quite a fast (for me anyway) pace down to Winding Stair Gap where there is easy road access to Franklin, my next resupply point. Along the way I ran into the owner of Baltimore Jacks Hiker Hostel. This was a lucky thing for me because I scored the last bunk bed. Things were getting really crowded in town because a major storm was brewing and folks were trying to get off trail away from the nasty weather.
At the trailhead I scored more trail magic : drinks and fruit. Then I was so very kindly driven in to town right to the hostel door. The southern hospitality truly is amazing.


That evening the local businesses had organised a party of sorts for the hikers at the local distillery. A great opportunity to see old faces and share tales of our travels so far.","Betty Creek Gap

There was a log jam of hikers in Franklin waiting for the weather to fine up. The wet weather had been very gloomy so today’s forecast of a sunny day was welcome news.
Ron Haven, the hostel owner ran a small bus to shuttle hikers to the trail head at Winding Stair Gap at 9am. He was a friendly man who welcomed anyone on the bus regardless of wether they stayed at his business or not. Come 8:30am all the seats on the bus were full and then with each passing minute more and more hikers squeezed aboard. I had 3 backpacks on my lap as the aisle became jammed full. Then when the bus did take off I questioned if it would make it up the hill. I wondered if we would all have to get out to push it up or at least help it get a run up!


At the trail head I was first to set off but shortly afterwards the young uns past me followed by a steady stream of others until I was the caboose of the walkers! It kind of stays that way until folks take a rest and I plod on forward.




The day started with a couple of stiff climbs. Along the way I came across my first “bald”. These are cleared hilltops possibly done for grazing and they have superb views of the surrounding mountains. The official trail goes past Siler Bald but I could not pass up the opportunity to take a side path up. At the top the wind was brisk and the view stunning.
The temperatures sure were cold. Many of the trees had icicles on the top branches. When the wind blew I was showered with a magical ice cascade.
Next ascent up was to Wayah Bald and there was trail magic. Jerry “Old Deaf One”, Mike, Cynthia and Nancy had driven up from Texas and provided all sorts of treats. I was so grateful for the Dr Pepper, Cheese, salami topped off with peanut cookies. Thankyou. 



The summit of the bald has a grand old stone fire tower. Originally it was much higher but the weather extremes cracked the stonework. But rather than pull down the whole thing the forest service reduced the size and rebuilt the roof to match its original design. It’s now a fine and very popular public observation pavilion.
It was starting to get late into the afternoon and many hikers were stopping off at the shelter nearby. 


I pushed on to Cold Spring Shelter which for me made for a long day of about 16 miles. I’m so glad I did because I was rewarded with a campsite on a ridge which had a super view of the sunset and an equally fine view of the sunrise. I was concerned that I might be exposed to high winds but the weather gods provided a calm night. 


Some section hikers had build a great fire which I took full advantage of because it was cold. Once the sun set the temperature really dropped so I headed to my tent  and snuggled into my warm sleeping quilt.


It had been a great day.","Winding Stair Gap

I’m finding the ascents and descents are getting longer and steeper and physically more taxing. I’m yet to get my hiker legs so I’m finding the trail quite hard. On the other hand the views when I do make it to the top of the mountain are stunning.
The standout today was Wesser Bald which had a disused steel framed fire tower on top. After a very stiff climb up it might have been easy to miss as it was off to one side. Often times I’m totally exhausted and my eyes are glued to the patch of trail only a couple of yards distant as I do my best to work out where to put my next weary footstep. 
But this time I caught sight of the structure out of the corner of my eye, so I took off my pack and wandered on over. It wasn’t a significantly high frame being only two stair flights up. At the top, to my amazement someone had left a couple of beach chairs. Definitely an invitation to kick back, laze and enjoy the view. 
And what a view it was. I had a clear sight down one of the narrow ridges which the path followed all the way to Nantahala Outdoor Centre, my destination for the night.

I spent an hour or so on the platform then set on down the trail. It was really quite tricky at times because the ridge was only a yard or so wide with the hillside steely dropping down on both sides. On and on it went. By the time I reached the bottom my legs were spent.
I take a fair bit of energy to save my knees so I’m often past by others. Yet to date I’ve not had any knee problems so maybe my strategy is paying off. 
My original plan was to continue on a couple of miles past the NOC but at the local general store they had a good deal on the hostel beds and the offer sounded too tempting. I was also looking forward to a hot cooked meal so the bunkhouse at NOC was my home for the night!","Cold Spring Shelter

A weird thing happened last night. 
When I was making my booking the shopkeeper suggested that they had a laundry and would I like to use it. I thought that this was a subtle hint as to my general clothes odour. Actually it was “on-selling” upon reflection. Anyways I grabbed $5 in quarters and headed to the laundry room with all my clothes other than a pair of running shoes and my spare fresh top. 
Putting them in the washing machine I headed over to the restaurant for a meal only I got distracted by some random hiker conversations. I returned to the washer and transferred the washed clothes to the dryer. Back at the restaurant more conversations followed and then when I placed my order I was told the kitchen was closed. 
Disaster! (Note to self: Order food first then start talking, and not the other way around!)
Anyways I was annoyed but then I went to the dryer only to find an empty dryer! My clothes were gone! 
Well I guess that news on top of the lack of food made me a tad upset. As it turned out later in the night my clothes turned up. There had been a mixup. 
But waking up in the morning I think I was more upset about getting upset in the first place if that makes sense. 
On the AT little hiccups (like loosing your way, or loosing your trekking poles or loosing your clothes) happen. And it’s best to not get upset but to go with the flow. 
Thinking about this I decided I’d slow down a bit and take up all the 10am checkout time I had. It gave me the chance to sort out my gear and get back into a hiking mindset. 
As it was the walk today was another really steep one and by my altimeter watch was over 4000ft with all my ups and downs. My campsite for the day was Locus Grove Campsite. I didn’t see any locus but it was a nice spot to camp.","NOC

In the bible (Genesis) the story of Jacob’s Ladder is of a dream Jacob has of angels climbing up and down from heaven. 
The major climb for today was called Jacobs ladder and although for me it didn’t lead to heaven there were angels! Just before the start of it one trail angel left me a breakfast bar then straight after that another angel drove up in his pickup and handed me a couple of bunches of bananas. Trail magic score! 
It was just what I needed and I flew up Jacobs Ladder.The forecast for the night was for heavy rain so I headed for Cable Gap Shelter. It’s half a day away from Fontana which is the start of the Smokies.

Treetrunk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611409,"Day 19 Snowstorm 
Today marked another major milestone for my walk being that I entered the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. It’s one of the most visited and iconic parks in the USA, being established in the 1930s by all sorts of private and public entities and then formally authorised by President Franklin Roosevelt in 1940. It’s history of course goes way back before then when it was the lands of the Native Americans. When white settlements came there was forced removal of tribes and the Smokies became a great place to hide. In fact some Cherokee still live in the vicinity. During the 1930s and the depression many out of work men were used to establish and build fire towers, trails, huts and the like and it is these facilities that I was to appreciate over the next few days. The weather was also to play a significant part of my walk. It had been showering on and off during my time in Fontana but then a major cold front moved in overnight. It reduced the temperature a bit where I was. However at the higher elevations the temperatures really dropped below freezing turning those showers into snow, some of it quite heavy at times. I wasn’t to really know this and coming from tropical hot sunny Australia had no idea what really was in store. I had already purchased 6-7days supplies of food from the Fontana Store ready for my time in the Smokies. The shuttle was due at 8:30am and I was ready to go with a very heavily laden pack. It didn’t actually show up until way past 9 and by that time there was a throng of hikers anxious to get going. The shuttle dropped me off back at my last exit point and I headed off skirting around the Franklin reservoir until I came to the dam wall. Here there was the “Fontana Hilton”, a very spacious 24 person 2 tier hiker shelter and lots more hikers. There were also about 6 or more pavilion shelters with all manner of Trail Magic goodies. I’d already eaten but couldn’t resist a donut and with my hiker hunger now kicking in, it was scrumptious.The first part of the walk was along a road. It was dead flat and my legs loved that. But then the path took off away from the road and uphill. My legs really didn’t appreciate that. I lodged my permit in the hiker box and I’d officially entered the Smokies!It was pretty much raining lightly all the time and I noticed that as I steeply climbed higher the droplets were starting to float down. It was snowing. At first there was no accumulation but getting over 4,000 feet it was sticking to the trees and as I got even higher there was more and more of it. I was having to brush it off my clothes but was warm and generally dry. My shoes though were a sodden mess as the trail had become a sloppy, slushy swamp of mud mixed with ice. Coming from Australia where I don’t usually experience this I was having fun!When I got to the first shelter it was full and hikers were having to pitch their tents in the snow. I thought about this for a second or less then decided to push on to the next shelter Russel Field. A good choice for although I got in late there was space for me and I got to sleep warm and dry. It had been another great day.","Fontana

This was a slog of a day. Lots of snow and at the higher elevations the tree branches were drooping down from the weight of the accumulation. Much of it was ice so I was constantly getting slapped in the face and having to clean it from my pack and clothes. The trail was a mess. Ice, mud, tree debris mixed together make for a slippery soup.But as it was such a new experience to me I was having a great fun time. I can’t say the same for most other hikers as I later heard all sorts of dramatic tales of hyperthermia, freezing cold and forced evacuations! Not for me.Late in the afternoon I arrived at Silers Bald Shelter. The front verandah floor was an iceberg laden swamp. Inside it wasn’t much better. Most other hikers had taken one look and had moved on. But not me. I was tired out. The top sleeping tier was dry.

When I emerged from my warm sleeping quilt cocoon and ventured past the verandah swamp there were a number of deer grazing on the grass outside the shelter. It was enchanting. In Australia I’m quite used to see kangaroo grazing outside my window at my tree farm in the Adelaide hills. Here I guess it was something similar, just different native animals.The weather for the day was much nicer. The cold front had moved on, the day was clear and sunny; in fact absolutely perfect for the vista from Clingmans Dome. The climb was mostly gentle up through pine forests which gave out the sweetest fresh smell. (Much different from my clothes and shoes which were starting to get that damp rancid odour!) The summit itself is topped with a spiral ramp leading to a concrete mushroom construction. There were lots of visitors and they were having a difficult time of it all. The snow had melted then refrozen so the ramp had become a dangerous skating slide. I saw quite a number of slip ups and slews. The views from the top were quite amazing and I really counted my blessings. Heading off down the mountain I came across Newfound Gap a major road crossing and a seriously crowded car park full of visitors to the mountains. Many hikers take off from here to visit Gatinlinburg for a resupply. I though still had 4 or more days of food so headed on back up (and up and up) to Icewater Spring Shelter. There were lots of hikers camped there as they were returning to the good weather.

I will remember this day of hiking for a long time. Nothing extraordinary happened. It was simply a peaceful, great day of relaxed walking. The weather was kind, there were some stunning vistas and most of all was the trail. It ran along ridgelines that were only 3or 4 feet wide and which would plunge steeply down for a thousand feet or more on both sides. Simply stunning. I totally soaked it up and ambled along as lazily and carefree as I could. I was one of the first ones out from the camping area but was one of the last to get in at the end of the day. Some hikers who I often see followed my example and I think we took turns to find the next viewpoint and then to take 15-20 minutes rest to soak it all in. The first major feature was Charlie’s Bunion: a series of rock outcrops protruding over the valley many thousands of feet below. I took the opportunity to climb up and do a pose for the camera! My end point was Tri Corner Knob Shelter. There was space inside so I set up my mattress on the sleeping platform. Outside under the verandah there was a long bench table for cooking, bench seat and very pleasant comraderie with all the hikers. A spring right nearby provided water. It was all a very effortless setup and an easy end to a great day.","Icewater Spring Shelter

The weather gods were kind again and it was another day to soak up the verdure. In the shade I took a spell to sketch a bit.My plan for the day was an ambitious 15 mile hike to Davenport Gap Shelter. I was looking forward to visiting there because it’s one of the last remaining shelters that is “caged”. A few years back the authorities decided to cage in the entrances to many shelters to prevent bears coming in and stealing the food of the hikers sleeping in there. It was a kind of zoo for humans. It was the animals turn to take a look on in. Trouble was the hikers thought that this was a great way to safely get close to the bears. So they fed them whilst they were safely on the other side of the cage.This only increased the dependence and appetite of the bears on human food. Not only that but some hikers got trapped in their cage because the bears wouldn’t let them come out! So then the cages were removed, bear cables installed so hikers would hang their food way out of the bears reach, and educational programs begun to better inform hikers about more appropriate ways to interact (ie keep away from) with bears. Davenport Gap is one of the last shelters to still have a cage and I was keen to see how it felt to sleep in a zoo cage. Along the way one of my fellow hikers was doing his best to persuade me to do otherwise. “If you walk on only another 3miles then you will get to Standing Bear Farm. Im going there because I can buy beer there!” Now the first two or three times he said this I was not interested. But it went on and he said it repeatedly to everyone we met. Pretty soon we were all getting thirsty so when I did get to Davenport Shelter at 3:15pm I thought to myself “Well it is only another 3 miles” Foolish me didn’t realise it was all very steeply uphill and that’s just to the turnoff. Add another half mile uphill again! Standing Bear Farm is an institution on the Appalachian Trail. It’s very wacky and quirky and as I was to find out run by a lot of folks who enjoyed alternative lifestyles. Their shop was full of outdated product and it was run on an honour system. Upon entry I was given a scrap of paper and I was to write on it everything I bought then settle the bill when I left. I took a quick look and then made a quick decision to avoid any food there. I then took a more detailed look and realised there was no beer. My colleague who was so desperate for a beer was devastated. It seems that if he wanted beer he had to find a taxi that would take him 20 miles away to the nearest liquor store!!!!! He was shell shocked. I was plain exhausted and in my delirium ordered a pizza which turns out was a frozen product placed in a rather dirty oven until it was burnt to a crisp. Frankly I didn’t care, I was so ravenous although after the second slice I was having second thoughts. My other friends were much more civilised and cooked up couscous filled with a variety of tinned product. At this point I was retiring to my tent when a ute (pick up truck) with New York plates pulled up and a gentleman alighted and placed two ice chests full of a selection of specialist Connecticut IPA beers. He told me he missed the Trail so much he, on a whim, drove 14 hours south to provide Trail Magic to hungry hikers. I couldn’t believe my luck. I asked if I could bring my friends over. First I went to the ones glumly cooking couscous. “Pssst ... do you want a beer?” Their eyes lit up. They were amazed I had found such a treasure trove. I went over to my colleague who had suggested coming here in the first place. He was having none of it. “ No, I’m not having a beer now!”, he exploded,” I wanted a beer when I got here, not later on. I’m going to bed!” Well we had a merry old time exploring the contents of the ice chests. And there was more. Our Trail Angel then asked would we like Lobster, Salmon or Crab. He had brought 24inch long fillets of freshly caught salmon, and a selection of other sorts of treasures from the sea. It was a gourmet feast. Unbelievable. All from an angel who missed seeing the AT hikers as they were yet to arrive in his state.","Tri Corner Knob Shelter

A relatively short day highlighted by seeing my first black bears in the wild! I deliberately took my time leaving Standing Bear Farm as I was quite enjoying the chaotic quirky atmosphere that oozed from all the characters that seemed to be drawn there. Also they had bottomless coffee and that was a bonus.When I did get going it was an uphill slog. I was on my own for the first part of the day and possibly because of that  I managed to quietly come across first a Mama Bear with her two cubs, then later a baby bear on its own on the trail. Now I don’t have the photographic evidence. The truth is when I came across the baby bear I had no idea where Mama was and I was madly clicking my sticks trying to scare it away! I didn’t want to come between Mother and child and then face the wrath of an angry parent. Next time though I’ll try to remember to also get my camera out!The trail climbs to the top of Snowbird Mountain where there is a curious spaceship themed FAA facility. “2speed” (from Quebec) and “Joe Cool” were there taking a rest.

Today I faced all sorts of weather extremes. I knew that it was going to be a rainy day so I got going early. The disappointing part was at Max Patch. Many hikers get to experience this bald with its 360 degree views in clear weather. On days like this it’s incredibly popular. But for me it was dense mist so I saw little and I was on my own! After that the weather deteriorated until I was caught in a freezing hailstorm. Soaked through I trudged on. It left the trail a slithery mess. My pace reduced to a shuffle as I did my best to avoid slipping on the greased path. But then the sun started to shine on through the clouds. I stopped just short of Hot Springs at Deer Park Mountain Shelter. I could have gone on but I was tired and figured I’d enjoy this trail town more when I was refreshed from a sleep. The campsites there were perfect with a carpet of cushioned pine needles. Plus nearby was a stream with a couple of logs ideally positioned so I could soak my feet and take a much needed scrub.","Max Patch Road

Hot Springs is a small country town where the Appalachian Trail goes down its Main Street. It makes for a perfect place to rest up, do a resupply and meet up with lots of fellow hikers. A bonus was that a hiker festival was planned for the weekend. Whilst lots of activities were planned those that know me well would know that the real attraction for me were the hiker feeds. They were plentiful! So I was up early at sunrise and headed off well rested from the day before. The town was only 3.1 mile away and that was mostly downhill. What a bonus!The first hostel I came across and the most popular was Laughing Heart. For $75 I got a 3 bed room that I shared with “Joe Cool” and “2speed”. First task was clothes washing, next a shave and shower then a large group of us headed to the local diner for comfort food. That done it was resupply time. Foolishly I bought too much food not fully appreciating I would have to haul it on out the next day. Sometimes my eyes and stomach rule over logic! Back at the hostel it was relax time until 6pm when tables laden with salads, cheese bakes, chilli, vegetarian dishes and fruits were set up on the lawns. A band started planning and it was a pinnacle gathering of the hiker community. I met up with folks I hadn’t seen for weeks and there was such a friendly atmosphere. One of the talking points was how so many hikers had passed through Standing Bear Farm then had got ill. I don’t know if the two are connected. Certainly none of our party had suffered but I think there are obviously stomach bugs lurking out there that are striking the unwary. I also got to speak with Jennifer Pharr-Davis who set the AT  speed record at under 50 days. I’m aiming at 3 times that rate but I sure respect the physical ability to daily walk the distances she did. The party lasted way into the night and at 10pm we were all totally exhausted. That’s so very beyond our bedtime schedule. It had been such a fun evening!","Deer Park Mountain Shelter

The plan for today was a lazy one. Pancake breakfast at the Smoky Mountains diner, recover from that feast, mooch and float around the hostel with an intention of organising my pack then leisurely stroll for 4 or 5 miles to a campsite along the trail. It would be a short walk. I had arranged to meet two hiking friends “Joe Cool” and “2speed” there. And because it was a short walk I’d even stored a celebratory bottle of red wine for the evening meal. It was a great plan. All started well. The breakfast was superb, I left feeling totally full. It was all I needed in a breakfast after days of hiking and a welcome change from my usual instant oats.I then frittered around the hostel, and at some point, feeling the first pangs of hiker withdrawal anxiety, I headed off to find the campsite 5 miles away. Hot Springs is a town that really embraces the Appalachian Trail spirit. There are AT logos emblazoned into the sidewalks and the citizens are so hiker friendly. Immediately out of town the trail crosses the French Broad River; which has plenty of rapids and a centre for kayaking sports. Lots of hikers seemed to be choosing to camp on the side of the riverbank which seemed a bit sketchy to me as the side of the riverbank included lots of mud, flood debris and general mess. Past all that it was a climb up to “Lovers Leap”. There are many same named sites around the world where the legend goes of a maiden who leaps down to the river below to join the spirit of her lover who had been put to death in unfortunate circumstances. It was quite a view of the river below although I figured in this case the maiden would have had to take an almighty leap to get anywhere near close to the river. Once past the viewpoint I was under the impression that the path levelled off a bit and was an easy stroll to the designated camp spot. I was sadly mistaken. Instead the track went up and up (this is the AT!) and instead of being 5 miles turned in to being over 8miles. My legs just can’t do climbs and I found it so hard. I was cursing every additional pound of food weight in my pack (especially the red wine). I was hauling out 6 days food and I was tiring fast by the time I reached the camp just below Rich Mountain. Once there I immediately poured a cup of wine, not bothering to wait for my friends. They did arrive sometime after but lucky them seemed to cruise up the mountain with ease. They did get to enjoy the red though!!!After supper we all climbed up to the viewing platform of an old fire tower on the summit. We were treated to a classic Appalachian mountains sunset with the peaks in all directions bathed in pastel shades of lilac, blue and peach.","Hot Springs

Awhiles back I had had a engaging conversation with a fellow hiker about our three brains. There’s the brain (some of us have) in our head called the cephalic brain, then there’s the cardiac brain (the heart), and the enteric brain (the gut). Each organ has complex neuro-networks and is able to store and process information, and each has the capacity for neuroplasticity. I may sound quite an expert in this, but in reality my son has been studying medical science specialising in the ways the brain works. He has been the source of any medical terms that occasionally pop out!Many ancient wisdom teachings talk about this and the importance of checking into one’s own innate intelligence, in particular following the wisdom of the heart and gut feelings. My colleague was using the through hike as a time to explore the balance between these brains. He suggested I do the same.After today, with hindsight, I perhaps should have followed his advice!The plan for my friends and I was an ambitious one: to hike 18 miles up and over a number of peaks. It would be our longest walking day yet!I got going well ... since we were at the top of a mountain that meant going down and I found that the easy part! However not long into the day I had this uneasy feeling “Go back to bed!” Now my heart brain was having none of that and wanted to keep going with my friends. Yet time and time again I heard this voice inside saying “Take a rest, take a rest!” At some point I stopped at a spring to get a drink of ice cold water fresh out of the mountain side. My friends past me by and I said I’d catch up that night when we camped. It must have been wishful thinking as my steps were getting slower and shorter. At the bottom of the mountain was a derelict masonry block structure with a neon light in the window saying “Open”. I stepped inside to a place back in time. It was “Mom’s Store” AKA “The State Line Grocery and Service Station” (located on the border with Tennessee). It was a thriving business in the 1950’s and Dwayne the owner continued to run it in memory of his Mom who had spent so many years of her life serving the local community. The fuel pumps were now gone and the grocery shelves bare but there were snacks, microwave sandwiches and drinks for sale. I sat by an old stove having a great chat with Dwayne who recalls Grandma Gatewood the first woman to through hike the AT, calling by in the 1960’s. He remembered when there would be only one or two through hikers a year. Then the 70’s came and for a time there were 40 a day! Then it died down, and now there has been a resurgence although he reckons numbers are down quite a lot this year. Our conversation included many of the characters he’d met. He left me with this classic line talking about egos and the trumped up opinions some folks have of themselves: “Some folks you meet ...you would like to buy ‘em for what they are worth and sell ‘em for what they thought they are worth!”
 I left feeling quite content after a rewarding time with a local character. But when I  stepped outside my body seized up! My knees were swollen and painful to bend. I thought “My goodness my hike is over ... I’ve damaged my joints ... maybe I’ve done a tendon or something.” Every step was a nightmare. I knew I couldn’t possibly make it the18 miles to the agreed campsite. Somehow I shuffled forward reaching the next shelter where I collapsed on the ground under a shady tree and slept for a couple of hours. Later I found a flat spot and put up my tent. I was done for the day.","Rich Mountain

During the night I made all sorts of plans and reconsiderations about what I should do. Should I quit? Should I stay? Should I move on? I took ibuprofen, an anti- inflammatory drug, something I usually avoid as the liver doesn’t like it. I bandaged my knees and I committed to going slow. The morning came and my joints were definitely objectionable to movement. But they could be persuaded! So I moved on forward. The trail was pretty and I came across some picture perfect meadows and balds. Tough but very enjoyable. My throat was sore and I started coughing and spluttering. I committed to staying well away from any other hikers. No one should get the kind of virus I have!

I wasn’t getting better. I wasn’t getting worse. I’m a cup half full kind of person so things are on the positive! I resolved that the next road I came to I’d call a shuttle to the nearest hiker hostel, get a room and see out this flu pestilence I’d succumbed to. Two or three coffees later and after I’d had my instant oatmeal breakfast I was on my way! A mile or so later I saw my goal in sight! A road! My pace quickened! Just 100 metres short though of my goal my pace was arrested by the sight of an A4 sized pink poster stapled to a tree trunk. “15 th anniversary Trail Angel feast at Sams Gap” All sorts of food goodies were promised. One of my three brains asked “ How can you go past that?” My initial plan to high tail it to a hostel was amended to making it to Sams Gap ... then to hightail it to a hostel! So onward I continued! I had not quite taken into consideration that Sams Gap was a mountain ascent and descent away and that it would take all my energy to get there. But the positive energy from having a goal pulled and pushed me forward. The trail magic closed at 3:00pm and at one stage on the wrong side of the steep mountain I began to wonder would I make it. But luck was with me and I stumbled into a parking Bay to the side of an interstate highway at 2:45pm. 10 gentlemen in their 70’s who were trail maintenance volunteers ran the trail surprise every May 1st. On arrival I was asked to head to the handwashing station then after that not to leave until I was not hungry. There was a grill with hamburgers, lots of sides and a mountain of brownies. I was in heaven. Eventually I was complete and as I was the last one in, the gentlemen then packed up their tables chairs and supplies into their pickup trucks and headed home. For me I just wandered over to the nearest tree and lay down in the shade for a 1 hour sleep. One of the trail volunteers had told me of a camping spot just a mile away with a good spring. I headed to that and setup camp feeling totally revived from my feeding splurge!","Spring at Mile 309.5

The positive energy from the Trail Magic feast from yesterday spilled over to the morning and I awoke anxious to get going. The day had a major climb up to Big Bald which is a very prominent cleared mountain top at 5,516’. I could see it from miles away and was excited to eventually reach it’s summit. It was a glorious sunny day and lots of hikers gathered at the top, threw off their packs and soaked in the 360degree views. I kept my distance because I was coughing still. But it gave me the chance to sketch Little Bald which was a short distance away. Back on the trail it was a relatively easy descent, to Spivey Gap where there was a picturesque campsite in a grassy meadow. But my legs felt strong so I climbed up the next ridge and from there the path continued it’s easy decent to No Business Knob Shelter. I’m no sure why that called it that; perhaps it’s because they had no business putting a shelter there in the first place because the water source was way back down the mountain. Not a good thing to learn that I had passed it by and would have to backtrack my steps if I wanted supper for the night. The weather app had predicted heavy rains for the day and though I had one slight shower all was clear. I counted my blessings and enjoyed another dry night in my tent.I was also quite pleased to have done a 17 mile day which by my standards is a darned long way!","Spring near Sams Gap

Just 6 miles away at the bottom of the river valley was the town of Erwin and my next resupply point. It’s a place where most hikers stop off for a while and have some R&R.When I awoke and got moving most of the folks who were staying in the shelter had gone. Many tents were also packed up. I think that there was a general restlessness that after 5 or more days of hiking people were ready for some real food and a chance to have a proper shower. The path was very easy and I made good time. The first house one runs into on the outskirts of Erwin is “Uncle Johnny’s” Hostel and almost everyone either calls in or stays the night. I made inquiries and secured a private room for $45 per night plus taxes. I was happy with that as I wanted to isolate myself given I was often coughing. There were many familiar faces and I caught up with characters I hadn’t seen in some time. Most bunkhouse beds were full. There were even many tents pitched on the lawns as that way it saves $’s but there are still the facilities.My first priority was straight to the showers for a major clean up, then the washing machine for all my clothes. Uncle Johnny’s has bikes of dubious shape and I took one down the road to a service station where I managed to buy lots of oranges - I figured the extra vitamin c could only help fight off whatever the flu type virus it was that I had.Then I simply rested the day away!","No Business Knob Shelter

I was in heaven because I did not need to hike for the day. And also because I was in a room where I could spread out my junk ( ie have a pack explosion) and not worry about invading other people’s space. During the day the hostel provides shuttles into town so that there are many options for resupply, eating or buying/replacing gear. Already some hikers have gone through a set of hiking shoes - it’s unbelievable how the trail rips to shreds packs and shoes. My major point of call was the post office as I wanted to send back to Australia clothes and gear I did not need. After 4 weeks of walking I’m very conscious of every gram of weight in my backpack and I will be ruthless to reduce it! That done I headed to Walmart and bought 5 days supplies of food. Walking out I’m so aware of how heavy my shopping bags are, and the conversation on the shuttle back general revolves around concerns of “Do you I think I’ve bought too much?... my food weighs a ton!!” or “ Have I bought enough?”That all done though I just spent lots of time lying on my bed doing nothing. Ahhh bliss!","Erwin

My zero day staying in a Room at Uncle Johnny’s had done wonders for my morale. I still had the end stages of a nasty chest infection but it was coming good. Judging from the splutters and coughs I heard around me I was not the only one suffering and I did hear tales of a number of hikers who had to leave for a week or more to overcome the effects. But I was anxious to get going again so I vacated the room at 10am, had a strong cup of coffee from the camp store then headed out on the trail. The weather has been very wet and rainy but I was told there might be a break after 12noon. I left with high hopes and for awhiles anyway the showers held off. Then they returned with vengeance. There was Curly Maple Gap Shelter at mile 5 so I called in to get some dry time and a lunch break - pepperoni, cucumber, bell pepper and sliced garlic on a bagel. You might ask why the sliced garlic? - at this stage I’m thinking even garlic might help get rid of the dreaded pestilence I have! The sodden path wound its way up to a bald called Beauty Spot. Much of the day I had been in cloud that reduced visibility to 100 yards or less. However on reaching the peak out popped the sun and for the briefest of moments I got to see the grassy top in all its glory. It was beautiful! But then the cloud closed in again.There is a piped spring and camping spot just over the other side so I headed to that as my home for the night. My evening supper was a salad kit I’d lugged up from Walmart, to which I added an avocado, cucumber, pepper and ... more sliced garlic.

Today I added another culinary ingredient to my arsenal of healthy foods to combat my dreaded malady. Stumbling along the path I spotted two fellow hikers looking at an fallen tree. I asked what was up and they said they had discovered some “Chicken of the Woods”. Not being a mycophagophobe; (ie I love mushrooms especially the ones I personally find in the wild) I was quite excited. This fungus, otherwise known as Laetiporus sulphureus is an unmistakable mushroom. It is a large growth; a brightly colored fungus, distinctively orange with tinges of red and yellow as shown in my photo. Usually it’s found on rotting trees, because that’s what it does - rot wood. In fact back a few hundred years it caused lots of damage to the wooden hulls of the British Naval Fleet! Anyways I’m told that Chicken of the Woods has a “succulent “ poultry flavour. I am not sure if I would go that far, but it does cook up quite well when stir fried with garlic, which is exactly what I did when I got into camp at the Clyde Smith Shelter. Note that I do happen to carry a small bottle of extra virgin olive oil (for occasions such as these) with me and though I don’t have a frying pan, my cooking pot is wide enough that it will do the trick!I tented for the night, however the shelter has a great bench for cooking. Pretty soon the “succulent “ odours from my culinary experiments were wafting all about and garnering all sorts of praise from my colleagues. It should be understood that hiker food is insipidly bland so any cooking out of the ordinary such as my little feast will cause quite a stir. As it turns out when the “Chicken of the Woods” was added to my normal dehydrated fare, it tasted absolutely delicious. I went off to bed with a tummy feeling brimful and content. As for the walking today? Much like most AT Days ... Up a big Mountain (Unaka Mountain 5180’) then down the other side with the promise of something similar the next day!","Beauty Spot

Today I spent the night in one of the iconic shelters on the Appalachian Trail: The Overmountain Shelter. Since first seeing photos of it from AT reports on the internet I’ve wanted to stay there. It’s appearance is so romantic: a typical heritage American southern state building lost in the back woods. The days hike took me over Roan High Knob which at 6285’ is one of the highest mountains to get over. It’s also one of the colder ones. But on my day the weather was just fine. It’s a long walk up and as usual I was passed by just about everyone! Starting early morning I made the peak at 12.30 and had my lunch (2 packets of apple cinnamon oatmeal cooked up in my drinking mug!!!) Then it was all the way down again! About half way it started to rain, but things cleared up just as I got to the shelter. There were lots of people there .. maybe 25 though I’m told that on the weekend there were 75! The recent history of the barn is that in the early 1980’s it was renovated by hiking clubs so that it would suit people staying overnight. The upper barn floor is used for sleeping, then the lower section has tables for eating as well as a raised platform which also can be used for sleeping. One thing the renovation did not alter were the wall gaps. It turns out the barn used to be used specifically to store tobacco. Hence all the wall slats and floor boards have half inch gaps between so the tobacco could dry out. Now all the gaps let in the chill air and the mice!!! It should be no surprise then that the hikers now all put their tents up inside the barn!!

Two big events today. Firstly It marks the “sort of” start of the reduction in the elevation and steepness of the trail (at least in the immediate term- although there are still a few more 5000 foot hills to come) and ... drum roll ... I past the 400 mile point!!!It was a great night sleeping in the barn and to my relief I did not have any mice trying set up a nest in my sleeping quilt whilst I was still using it. Per my usual day the birds start chirping and singing come dawn which is around 6:00. That’s my signal to pull the plug on my mattress that lets out a noisy “whoosh”, pack my bags in the early light and be on my way. I chatted to some section hikers just before I left and I asked how they slept. “Terrible” was their reply. They were not used to hiking. They had done a third of my distance yesterday and were in pain and distress. Although I really feel exhausted at the end of the day, hearing that others are also feeling that pain (sort of) helps put my feelings of being tired into perspective. Perhaps even though I don’t think or feel it, I am getting to build up some resilience.The day began with a climb (long) (for me anyway) up Little Hump Mountain followed a descent, then, by another climb of (yes.. you guessed it) Big Hump Mountain. I was quite puffed out at the top of that so I savoured the moment by a Garlic/Cheese/Garlic and Salami Bagel. Yum. Then it was down hill. This part I liked. I got to pass the 400 mile point celebrated with a clearing with a sign made out of sticks ( drumroll). See photo.I found a perfect campsite by the Elk River. Another grand day. PS I think the garlic is working at least to warn others to keep away from me! - I sat down at a table to make my supper. I left my food whilst I collected water. When I returned a fellow hiker was sitting opposite. I started cooking my food and suddenly he packed up his cooking gear. I asked if anything was wrong and he just said he was going to eat his dinner somewhere else!

They are still motivated, sometimes dangerously so! The goal now is mileage ... just how far can I go today???I’ve heard and met already folks who are doing astonishing mileages ... 20, 25, 30 , 35 miles ... well that is the talk at least. Maybe some are the trail retirees a week after their sub 12 hour epic ultra marathon??. It seems everyone around me were regularly doing 20 mile days. Meanwhile I seemed to be plodding along, then tiring out at 15 miles max.But today I deliberated and came to the hare-brained resolution that I would push my physical boundaries and attempt a 20 mile day! What foolishness. I have got to say there was a touch of logic to my choice of days. Firstly no big hills. Secondly most of it down hill. And fine weather was on my side. As it turns out luck was on my side and I achieved my goal. Possibly I was in a daze the whole way since I don’t remember much ... I was definitely in an otherwise focused mindset.I do remember seeing a dilapidated barn (see photo) which I figured must be an old tobacco barn given the gaps between the timbers.As the day wore on I regularly checked my phone GPS app, At long long last it said I’d done 20 miles and that was it. Luckily I was right beside a river, so it was pack off, and set up camp. Later that night I checked out the comments about a shelter just 0.2miles ahead. “ No f@@@ing way stay here.

Not only my skin and clothes, but just about everything I currently have or touch. There is only so much a swim in a river can do. Time for a major rest and wash!

It was a chance for a “Nero” (Nearly a Zero hiking day.) Between me and the hostel was a big hill to get over, this is the Appalachian Trail after all. I find that I’m easily able to achieve the first hill in the morning. It is after that that the irritating indisposition in my lungs kicks in and slows me down. But it was not the case for today, as it was a short distance so I fairly flew to the hostel. Once checked in I headed straight to the showers (see photo) which are a fairly inimitable design. Firstly they are outdoors, I think, because hiker showers need a lot of ventilation! The shower itself consists of a galvanized laundry tub hung overhead from a timber beam with a link chain. Hot and cold copper pipes lead into that, and when the industrial lever style taps are opened the tub fills with water and the shower is in operation. The drain below somehow overflows onto rocks below. Very unique. To top it off there is a humourful mural on one of the walls. Adding to the effect of it all are strip fairy lights. I took all the time in the world to scrub and scrub and left feeling so refreshed. Meanwhile I had all my clothes and bedding washed. Finally I ordered a much, much too large pizza, devoured that and for 5mins my tummy enjoyed being totally full. I felt I was a new human being.

The day was a rainy one and there was nothing to it but push on. The terrain was a bit easier in a way. The trail followed a ridge line so there were no long ascents or descents. Some folks even describe the route as flat. It was definitely not that to me as I am sure that the cumulative ascent and descent was just about the same as any other day. It just didn’t seem that way at the time. I was well and truly tired out by the end of the day. I am a very slow hiker. Starting at 7:30am I reached road junction TN91 at 7:15pm having done 20 miles. There is a hostel nearby called the Rabbit Hole (named after “Rabbit”, one of the owners!), and I called them. A shuttle car pulled up 10minutes later and I was asked if I was feeling hungry. I sure was though at the time I was so tired from walking that I didn’t know what I felt! Anyways upon arriving at the hostel there was a long timber bench around which were 10 or so hikers sitting in beach chairs. On the bench were 2 steaming pots loaded with spaghetti Bolognese. “Go for it!” I was instructed. At that point the hunger took over and I made quite an assault on the feast. Delicious!

A couple of weeks back I along with many hikers encountered “Sovereign” who clearly had mental issues. He had been detained by police but was released.

Days of doing this inevitably means being unable to properly wash clothes or air out hiking shoes. This in turn predictably leads to the aromatic calling card of hikers: “hiker stink”. It’s a nose-wrinkler combination of sweat, dirty laundry, rotting fruit and other unidentifiable aromas. The worst thing is that the actual hikers cant smell how bad they really are.Now of course, I take constant care of my hygiene. I’m sure I couldn’t possibly have such a tag. But I do know that the reverse is happening. I can actually smell the day hikers coming from 20 or 30 metres away at least. Everything smells so fresh!My theory is that hikers are exercising so hard that there are an array of toxins produced by burning all this energy and these toxins are not nice.One consequence of all this is that hikers gain a reputation when they come to town. Rooms are set aside for hikers as I’m told their stench can l linger for days after they have left. I have even heard of car owners offering hikers a ride only then regretting the decision as they felt the need to thoroughly fumigate the interior of their vehicle, to get rid of the smell!!Today I was to experience the upshot of some of this aromatic reputation that hikers that have. I had an appointment to have a tooth attended to by a dentist in a city near to the hiker town I was passing through. I had made an appointment a week or so ago so was anxious to get my mouth looked at. When I got to the surgery, the receptionist said that they were all ready for me. She then slid the glass window between her and me shut. Later I was lead to a room. The nurse said “We have a special room for you, … we usually don’t use this room! ” I was ushered inside and then for the next hour they fussed around. It seems the room had never been used before because half the equipment didn’t seem to work. At some point the nurse asked the head dentist “Couldn’t we put him in one of the regular rooms?” To which was the answer “Oh no, we can make this room work”. At some point the head dentist gave up on me and handballed my tooth to his junior partner. “He’s much better at this sort of thing!” I was told. Well after what seemed to be 2 hours of fidgeting about my tooth was done. I’m not sure how well. At my regular dentist I’m sure it would have taken no more than 30 minutes. I guess I will pay him a visit when I return to Australia just to check up on what was done. On leaving I did spot that the dentist practice specialized in artificial tooth crowns so perhaps my simple procedure was a bit out of the norm. But I do know that it’s unlikely that the room I was in will be used again until the next through hiker has a dental emergency!","Damascus

When I went to pay my bill and leave, I was told the account had already been settled. I was swept away with surprise. Truly amazing. It left me in such high spirits heading out on the trail again. The route today took me alongside “The Creeper Trail”. Back in the 1960’s Damascus went through a decline due to a number of industries closing. To transform the town, a push was made to improve the tourist potential. An old railway line which ran from the mountains with a gentle downhill gradient was converted to a bike path. It’s now very popular and along with the Appalachian trail this has really highlighted the outdoors theme of the community. At the end of the day I came across a magnificent trestle bridge made with huge lumber frames. I was so struck by its structure that I camped the night there to take the time to have a better look. Just after I had set up my tent, two young men waded across the adjacent river carrying an icechest. They were former through hikers and figured they would run into other hikers (me) and figured I would enjoy some refreshment. They were right about that.

The day started with another milestone: 500miles! The distances seem to becoming easier to fulfill! Shortly after that I entered the Grayson Highlands. This is an area which is a highlight for many hikers because it has many small wild ponies. They are stocked there to graze and maintain the grassy area and thus enhance the views. Back in the 1940’s a group of local ranchers bred small-statured horses that could survive life on the Appalachian Mountains with little to no human interference. In a bid to engineer the land around them, they bred a horse with a pony and the lineage resulted in the wild ponies that live here today. I was really looking to coming across them because I had heard of so many reports of how cute they were. But alas I made no sightings. There was though a lot of pony poo!!! The walking through the area was really special, and the gradients much easier than what I had been used to. Coming on down to a lower stream by a road I heard voices and saw a number of marquees. More Trail Magic, this time being organized by a worker from a New Hampshire Brewery. Needless to say he brought with him a large sampling of the product he makes! And this time the grill was in operation and I had a fair share of hamburgers! Speaking with a number of hikers they encouraged me to return to Damascus for the Trail Days. Originally I had decided to continue on, but hearing so many positive reports I decided that if I did manage to find a ride back then I would go. The next road junction was 10 miles distant so with a full belly I got going from the very pleasant marquees, and headed up to Hurricane Mountain Shelter. It was about half way to the road and thus I figured I could easily make it there in the morning. The shelter was relatively new and due to more reports of bears there was also a new bear box to store food.","Rhododendron Gap Campsite

I had made a decision that I would go to Trail Days if I could get a ride back to Damascus within 3 hours of arriving at the next road junction. As fate would have it I had a ride within 3 minutes!!! I put out my thumb, waved and smiled and sure enough the next car pulled over and drove me half way there! It didn’t take too much longer for another car to then pull over and take me the rest of the way. Upon arriving back in Damascus there were hikers everywhere. Trail Days is the ultimate celebration of the Appalachian Trail and a homecoming for hikers from many years past. It’s a showcase of hiking vendors, a huge music festival, gear repair stations, food, talent show, and a hiker parade. On arriving I was directed to Tent City where literally hundreds of hiker tents were set up. Meanwhile in the woods nearby were even more tents with all manner of camp setups from the whacky to the gentlemanly. After getting myself set up I wandered the town and pretty soon I was meeting and greeting all the faces I had met along the trail so far. Lots of fun.","Hurricane Mountain Shelter

Treetrunk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613897,"Day 47 The Parade
As I have explained previously, most hikers who come to Damascus arrive with a very unpleasant aromatic reputation. 
As Trail Days lasts for a number of days the hikers in conjunction with the community have come up with very novel solutions. 
The citizens donate all their unwanted clothes to a charity store that in turn sells articles of clothing to the hikers for $1 or $2. Hence pretty soon everyone is to be seen walking around in all sorts of 1980’s era fashion items, in totally unmatched styles and in weird and whacky combinations. Some folks even step it up a notch or two and go totally left field. The blokes wear ballroom gowns with appropriate makeup and the girls dress down equally ridiculously. The hikers are a rainbow of personalities so the combinations are quite random.
Meanwhile a number of the Baptist churches bring in specially equipped caravans. They are emblazoned in large formal letters “Disaster Relief Unit” and are used when floods, tornadoes or hikers hit town! These massive trailer trucks have banks of commercial grade washing machines in them. So the hikers regular clothes all get thoroughly washed. There are squads of volunteers manning the trailers and they have a very logistical situation well handled for the hundreds of filthy hikers involved. 
A highlight of the event comes in the afternoon when all the hikers mass at one end of town and parade down the Main Street. The townsfolk meanwhile are well stocked and prepared with all sorts of super soaker guns, ice chests filled with water  and showering devices figuring that what smells the baths and washing equipment didn’t get, their douches will! It turns into a hilarious soaking scrum. 
Everyone then heads back to Tent City to recoup. 
Another fun event are the vendor booths. All the major suppliers are there knowing that the AT is a significant testing point and marketing opportunity for their products. At the end of the afternoon they raffle off excess gear so there are lots and lots of give aways. I didn’t score anything but I happily joined the groups with hopeful anticipation. 
The day ended in the evening in the woods where various groups were roasting up pigs, spaghetti and other feasting foods. 
There was a drum circle and a memory service was held for the VET hiker who recently passed away on the trail. One saying was passed around “Take stock of the people you love, take care of the rest.” 
Once the ministrations were complete the drumming began and this went continuously until well past 1am.  Many people partied hard - there were lots of sore heads!","Damascus

The partying went well into the morning. Some time around 3am I heard a saddened wail from a tent nearby, “Help me, I have 60 cans of beer left to drink. Do you want some? Come help me drink them!”Now in my youth I’d have hopped right of my tent and joined in the fun! Indeed even now one of my three head/heart/gut brains was urging me to open the tent flaps and at least see who was at the instant party nearby. But the other two were having none of that and I dozed back to sleep. At 8 In the morning I arose and there was a group still going! But the general atmosphere of Tent City was of movement out of there. Folks were busy packing up and texting friends trying to find rides back to the trail to where they had left off. It had rained during the night so I took the time to dry my tent fly and air things out. Over at one of the Baptist Churches formal rides had been organised. A big yellow bus was heading north whilst smaller shuttle vans were heading south to a number of different destinations. I was thinking of joining the bus when a young man asked if I needed a ride. I did and so he said to me”Hop in my truck. We’ll get you where you want to go!” He did indeed have a monster truck and off we went winding through the mountain roads until I made it back to my trail head a couple of hours later. I waved goodbye then it was back to my hiking routine. There weren’t too many hours left in the day so I made to a campsite by a stream 7 miles away. It was good to be back walking.","Damascus

After the time spent at Trail Days I was anxious to get back to some longer distances of hiking. Checking out my AWOL guide ( a guide book that lists the mileages of key points of interest, shelters, hostels,cafes and so on) I spotted the “Red Barn” Restaurant 18 miles away.  It’s well known for great Hiker Food so I figured that if I walked fast, I’d make it by late afternoon, giving me time for dinner, then I could amble on a mile or two and make camp. My plan went so well up to getting to the Restaurant! First up I made it to the Partnership Shelter, which is a really fancy and relatively new two storey haven. There I made breakfast of apple cinnamon instant porridge washed down with Starbucks instant coffee. Whilst I was there a gentleman wandered up with a case of cokes for hikers so I had one of those as well. Next up was a historic one room school house that ran up until 75 years ago. There were 4 timber crates inside each with all sorts of Trail Magic goodies. Now as it was only two miles from the restaurant I held back on the treats figuring that I wanted to enjoy my meal. I sketched the building from the side. Anyways I made it to the restaurant with plenty of time, and high hopes of a great feed. After 18 miles of anticipation I sure was hungry!There was a large banner outside announcing “Now Open” ! But alas it was closed on Mondays and today was Monday. Oh goodness me. On the other side of the road was a Mexican restaurant but it too was closed! I was so annoyed but instead decided to channel the negativity into walking on a lot more! I ended up with my longest day so far and was really pleased about that! I even found some trail magic along the way.

The country I was in was the scene of the tragic events from a number of days ago. Naturally I took time to contemplate the perplexing and inconceivable twists that life takes. It is beautiful land and I took time to sketch a barn and concentrate on the allurement rather than the distressing. As chance would have it, I walked today with “Belch” and his partner who had become directly entangled with the events that night. They had been forced by the FBI to curtail their hike for some time so that they could provide statements and testimony to the Grand Jury. Today was their first time back on the trail and they were bravely getting straight back into it. I chatted with “Belch” heading up our next mountain. His favourite Australian was Steve Irwin, so our conversation was about all the dangerous “down under” animals that can kill you. His choice of conversation not mine! Who knows what “Belch” was thinking at the end of the climb as he listened to my mad and extremely fool hardy adventures in outback Australia and beyond. But before I knew it we were at the top of what was normally a very steep climb. There was a very picturesque view from the top of Burke’s Garden, a large crater like natural geological phenomenon. It was from a grassy field filled with poison ivy and ticks. I made what I thought was a very strategic decision to spend the night in Chestnut Knob Shelter a fine stone structure complete with a door to keep the bears and ticks out. It turned out to be a very smart move as I was later to learn from the many hikers who instead chose to sleep with the ticks and poison ivy. ( more about that later)","Crawfish Trail Campground

I made it today to Laurel Creek Campground with a large bunch of other hikers. One chap kindly made a fire and we all sat around chatting about the days escapades. We were interrupted by a curious snake encounter. Actually it’s not my first snake episode. Lately I’ve been seeing lots of snakes. As an Australian I am very cautious of the dangerous things. But in North America it seems things aren’t so deadly. In fact the only snake to watch out for is the Rattle snake. Actually I’m told I don’t even have to look out at all. It’s rattle is so loud I’ll hear it long before I see it. But as for the other snakes I see, they seem far more docile than what I’m used to. Generally when I come close to a serpent it’ll scurry off as quick as can be. Not so on the Appalachian Trail. Instead they seem to just lie there and wait to be trodden on! I’ve tried throwing a stick from a distance but that doesn’t seem to bother them. I’ve yet to pluck up the courage to move one with my walking pole. Instead I stomp my feet and make a major diversionary track off my intended path until I’m clear of the thing. An amazing experience was yesterday when I came across two 2.5m black snakes locked in an intense wrestling match. (See photo above) I’m told it’s a mating ritual and I was the unfortunate intruder to necessitate “coitus interuptus”. At first they were both too interested in their struggle to bother about me. But after a minute or so I guess my gazing put them off their embrace. Both snakes cocked up their heads and then slowly they started to unwind and make their way towards me. I retreated in panic and was saved by “Belch” (who is a reptile aficionado ) who as cool as can be reached out and grabbed the larger of the two by the belly and lifted it away. “Don’t do that! You’ll get yourself killed” I hissed in fright,  thinking of what would happen if he were to do that in Australia. It wasn’t the most appropriate thing to say in the circumstances but then again I am prone to quite easily perform foot in mouth at the most inopportune times. Once the bigger of the two snakes was out of the way the next serpent also headed my way and “Belch” once again came to the rescue. Thank goodness for that. Back to my fireside tale. Our relaxation was curtailed when suddenly out of the bushes came an eight foot black monster and sidled up to one side of the circle. None of us knew what to do and this time “Belch” was not with us. I think we all shot our eyes to our tents to check we had securely zipped up the openings. Some even hurriedly looked up Google on the phone to see what was the best way to scare the thing away. It was not perturbed at all. It cocked up its head, looked this way and that then headed over to a nearby tree. At this point all the birds started making an almighty racket. We didn’t know what was up at first. But the snake had a deadly plan in mind. It arched up its body so that it was now standing four foot tall, grabbed a slender branch above it then slithered up through the foliage. It had spotted a nest which was not obvious at all from our eyesight. It honed on in. We were all gobsmacked to see the demise of two hatchlings and three eggs. It happened so fast. At this point many of us retreated to our tents to firmly secure all openings whilst one  hiker stood guard reporting the next movement of the beast. Fortunately for us anyways it headed off to other trees well away. Wildlife experiences like this are one of the features of my walk on the Appalachian Trail and I’ll keep these  memories for a long time. Then from a nearby roadside came the call “Hey, there’s Trailmagic by the road” A hikers mum and dad had stopped by in their truck with bags and boxes of goodies. All thoughts of the snake were vanquished as all the hikers made a manic stampede to the food! Never get in the way of a famished hiker and nourishments! We all slept contentedly that night with just a slight concern of where that snake might be.","Chestnut Knob Shelter

I have loved squeezepoints as they happen around the world. Back in the 1970’s and 80’s (yes I’m showing my age) the top squeeze point on the overland trek fro Singapore to London was the Puddin Shop in Istanbul. They had a notice board up and on my way thru I checked up on all my new found mates as to where they were on the way through. Similar thing in the 90’s on the African route from London to Capetown. There was the Thorn Tree cafe in Nairobi, Kenya named after an old Acacia Tree where travellers used to tack notes back to friends they last saw half way up the Nile. Somehow the messages usually got through! Lonely Planet use that as the title on their blog page.Everyone knew of these squeezepoints and made a point of stopping by to see who is where! The Appalachian Trail is somewhat similar. Of course there are the message books in each Shelter although in these days of smartphones things have gone digital. However when there is “Food” close to the trail, particularly a grill selling comfort food it immediately becomes a focus point.  Today I came across one such establishment, Brushy Mountain Outpost. I was up early and was first one breaking camp. When I got to the restaurant I was first one there, but pretty soon there was a steady stream of hikers flocking in. As you can see by today’s photo. The food was greasy, calorie obese, and just what I needed!!!Fortunately for me the next section was downhill. I don’t know how I could have made it uphill on such a full belly. Once I did get to go up I had plenty of energy and finished up with 20 miles for the day. A local church at Lickskillet Hollow (what a great name) had a surplus old meeting house and it had been converted into a hiker hostel. It was an excellent spot to rest up and revive for the night.","Laurel Creek Campground

As I walk along the Appalachian Trail, I come across many scrawled messages of wisdom such as this one: “You are stars wrapped in skin The light you are seeking has always been within.” I think this encapsulates the sentiment of the hiking fraternity. One common reason to undertake the Appalachian Trail experience is to rediscover ourselves or to let the esprit of the trail create us. I meet many hikers who are using the trail to overcome addictions or veterans who are walking off the scars of battle. Earl Schaeffer the first hiker to complete a through hike did so to walk World War 2 out of his soul. Certainly there are many peaceful spots along the way that are welcoming for a time of meditation and reconnection with the quintessence of the land. Not long after I saw that star sign I came across another saying “No clothes allowed past this point.” Another symbolic action to unshackle society norms? I choose to ignore the directions of this message!Today took me along Dismal Creek. There was nothing Dismal about it at all, very peaceful and lots of flat trail. In true AT tradition though after this was a very very steep ascent followed by a treacherous rocky scramble. The bliss of the creek could only last for so long. I ended up doing 25 miles for the day, though it was getting on dusk at 8pm when I did halt for the day. I didn’t come up with any mind boggling messages to scrawl somewhere but I did feel so very satisfied with my days efforts.","Lickskillet Hollow

One of the reasons I pushed so hard yesterday and did the miles I did was because I’d been invited to join a group of hikers for a birthday celebration in Pearisburg. The birthday girl “Sasquatch “ had hired an old house with lots of bedrooms for us all to take time off in. I figured that as time is at a premium it’s best to get to town as early as possible and naturally, not get back on trail the next day until as late as possible, and that is what I did!! I awoke early and fortunately for me the trail was a long downhill from my camp. First place to visit once I got to Pearisburg was the All You Can Eat Chinese buffet. Hunger once quelled (very temporarily I can tell you) I was graciously picked up by the boyfriend of Sasquatch in his pickup truck. I got a passenger seat but there were also hikers plus all our backpacks in the rear! It was great as I was getting to meet up with lots I hadn’t seen in a whiles. Once at the house we all lazed about, drank beer and had a good old time. The house itself was huge and dedicated to the children of a large family who had tragically been killed by a gas cylinder explosion. Each room was pledged to one of the children. It was done in a very gracious respectful and meaningful way. But hikers being hikers, the banter later that night turned to ghosts and all things supernatural! Just as the conversation was getting a tad bit creepy, a massive storm erupted outside and then the power went out! Well... for some this meant the house was truly haunted. Needless to say some of us got to sleep, whilst others were more awake that night.","Campsite near Doc’s Knob Shelter

I knew I’d be seeing them all again in a few days! So I gained a ride in the pickup truck, collected groceries then it was a short 1 mile stroll back to the trailhead. Once again it was a steep climb up, dip down to a valley, then more up!! The day went by fast and before I knew it the sun was starting to set. I found a pleasant campsite and secured my tent for the night. Lucky I did because without warning a massive storm blew in and it belted down with rain.

It’s always a tricky manoeuvre to pack up a wet tent when it’s still raining. In the confined space I gently deflate the air mattress and blow up pillow, careful to not touch the sides. Slowly I get everything I can into my pack. Then it’s a manic dash: get the pack outside, hopefully by a tree that has a measure of shelter, then whip off the tent fly, cast that aside, then roll up the inner tent hopefully without getting it too wet. Inevitably there are splatters of mud, leaves and debris. Worse there’s always a sock or item of clothing that gets missed in the mayhem that either gets rolled up in the tent, or gets cast aside into the wet surroundings. Nothing beats putting on wet socks and oh yes they sure smell by the end of the day.Nothing is too neat. Perhaps the worse thing is that the wet tent now weighs so much with all the moisture. Much of the morning was a gentle misty gloom, then out came the sun and it got very humidly hot very quickly. I was sweating bullets. All was good. But then disaster struck in the kindest of ways. Early afternoon the nicest of Trail Angels had left an ice chest full of a selection of beers and sofas all on ice. What can a Treetrunk do when presented with such manna from heaven. Oh dear! I had an amber fluid, and then another. So far so good. Then the grief! I had to climb up a ridge and in true AT tradition it was steep, unforgiving and massive. Not long into the assent I asked myself:“Oh why did I have that second beer?” Then later “Oh why did I have that first beer?!!!” Well I did make it to the top, then down again and to a pleasant shelter where there was a fresh mountain spring with cool sweet water. Ahhh refreshment! I walked aways on, pitched my wet tent by a gurgling stream happy and content.I slept well.","Dickenson Gap Campsite

Once upon a time the Appalachia mountains had groves of massive white oak trees. Their canopy spread was huge. Then someone had the bright idea of chopping down one or two or more. Then disease came. Over time the groves were gone. I came across one of the last remaining large oak trees:The Keffer Oak. Sadly it didn’t look in great shape. There is a symbiotic relationship between trees and their canopies. Someone ( who probably had the same wisdom of that other someone who started cutting down the first Oaks) had thought it a great location for electricity transmission lines. They’d swathe cut all the vegetation beneath the wires so the Keffer Oak is deprived to one side of the adjoining canopy.

Today turned out to be much tougher than I expected. As usual it began with a steep climb. That I could handle. At a Knob was a memorial to Audie Murphy who I remember when I was a kid as a western movie star. These days he’s  more so remembered as the most decorated soldier from WW2. He had died near this spot in a plane crash. Now soldiers come from across the USA to place their old dog tags and leave a memorial flag. Whilst I was there I met up with a Vietnam Vet. He showed me a photo of when he was in Vietnam. Boy he was real fit, muscled and without doubt a mean fighting machine! We spoke of what the attitudes were towards soldiers back 50 years ago and how they were really reviled. These days if someone is wearing military insignia, without hesitation folks will go out of their way to say “Thank you for your service.” How times have changed. The trail dropped down from that point to a river where I had my lunch of instant porridge in my cup. ( My hiking ideas about what to eat, how and when have become very weird) Then there was another uphill all the way to the Dragon’s Tooth, a major scenic drawcard on the AT. Actually it’s a large slab of skywards facing rock monolith. To my way of thinking it wasn’t that big a deal. But my thinking was very much tempered by my exhaustion from all the twisted rocks and boulders on a ridge top I had to scramble over to get there. I was totally spent! Then it got worse. The climb down was steep and in places they had embedded steel ladder rungs in the rock faces; the climbs were so difficult. At this point a massive rain storm blew in, and on one rock I slipped and twisted my knee. “Ouch ouch ouch” Actually I loudly used much more colourfully descriptive choice words. Somehow I reached the bottom and I knew I could go no further. Luckily nearby was a convenience store selling pizza of dubious quality. I didn’t care! I ordered every topping they had. And once I had the pizza bliss: a van pulled up and I was asked if I wanted a ride to the Four Pines Hostel. By now the rain had started again and my mind was made up. Off to the Four Pines we went. It was run by an alternative hiker friendly man who had converted his large three bay home garage into a hostel. One bay was filled with bunks, another lounge chairs and the third had a washroom and dining tables. It was a fun atmosphere. I slept well.PS Today’s picture is of a classic barn I saw yesterday.

But by the time I’d clambered over far too many boulders to get to Mt Tinker I was wobbly and my pace had reduced to a feeble shuffle. Perhaps I did have a bit of energy left because just as I was going to admire the view from the top I heard the unmistakable clatter of a rattle snake. I jumped a foot in fright. Then I saw the thing. It was huge and coiled ready to strike. I backed off but the serpent was not afraid and headed for me.

The trail is enclosed in a tunnel of vegetation right until the moment it pops out onto a busy 4 lane highway. And right there was the Super8 motel. Lots of hikers were already there and to my luck “Smiley” a hiker I’d met a few days back asked if I wanted to share her room with one other hiker. It was on the couch but I was fine with that. I gladly agreed. Ahhh couch time. Plus a short visit to numerous eateries! I ran into so many hikers I had met along the way. I think we were all of the same opinion that the last few days had been way too brutal and some time off was called for. I did also get to meet up with hikers who had chosen to stay in the rock and poison ivy infested meadow back at Chestnut Knob Shelter. They were covered in calamine lotion. Seems the poison ivy was particularly reactive. Though first unnoticed, a couple of days later it produced nasty welts from the plant’s oils. Worse the oils transferred to sleeping bags and clothing so it went to all parts of the body. You can be sure I’m gaining an eagle eye to spot that pesky verdure!","Lamberts Meadow Campsite

The AT route decision makers had obviously listened to the flood of complaints (* see footnotes below) about the previous few days and had significantly improved the conditions of the walking path. 
The way out of Daleville was such a change! It was now a manicured Avenue! Smooth, mowed lawn edges, manicured fine clipped path definition. I was enjoying this. 
And to top it off, not long after this the one third sign. I was a third done!
Now the mathematician in me goes thru the obvious numbers ... the first third took 61 days ... the next two thirds should take 61+61=122 days or 183 Days overall. 
There is a slight problem here. 
My visa is only for 6 months meaning that the USA Department of Homeland Security might be on my case if my hike takes that long. 
There are two obvious options. 
Either Option A: I start walking faster 
or 
Option B: they make the Appalachian Trail a whole lot easier.
I’m planning on option B! 
I ended up doing 11miles for the day on top of a ridge at Wilson Creek Shelter (The Creek was way down the ridge!!) I so enjoyed not walking fast.

The day started with wonderful trail magic. Pretzel had driven from Durham NC and set up a large tarp and tables of fresh watermelon, bananas, oranges, yoghurt and drinks. It was an hour or so out from our camp at the shelter the night before so it was the perfect mid morning break. More trail magic followed a bit further on. From there on the trail levelled out for awhile. I asked myself “Could it be that the trail is getting easier???” Along the way my appetite seemed to disappear. Generally speaking, my foodstuff craving fluctuates wildly from non existence (5 minutes after trail magic) to intense hunger (15 minutes after trail magic). But today I really couldn’t handle another dehydrated packaged hiking food product for supper. To pass the time as I hiked along I asked myself what I’d like to eat for supper. Eventually I decided upon ice cream and a hamburger. Of course such a dinner is an impossibility but the mind yearns for strange things along the trail. As evening drew closer I dropped down into a valley where there was a swimming hole and campsite where I intended to stay. Just as I got to the dirt road which went by the campsite a minibus pulled up and a bunch of hikers appeared from the bushes and hopped on board. On a whim I thought “Why not join them?” So I did. Once aboard the bus I asked, ”Where is this bus going to?” There was general laughter as to why I would get on a random bus without knowing its intended destination. But then came the answer. “It’s going to the Middle Creek Campground where there’s ice cream and hamburgers!” “Surely this can’t be true?”, I thought to myself. But sure enough 5 minutes later we pulled up at a caravan/camper van/camping park and there was a camp store selling ice cream and hamburgers. Sometimes dreams do come true. I was so happy I stayed the night, had a shower and was provided with a grassy level space for my tent. I even had a picnic table.

The hamburger and ice cream must have been just what I needed as I was able to keep walking feeling full of energy.The day began with a stiff uphill (nothing new), and then another called Apple Orchard Mountain. I didn’t see any orchards but I guess there once were. This peak was much higher than the first and at first I felt most intimidated. But then the path zigged and zagged and the gradient became the most gentle I could have imagined. It probably took a great distance to get there but for once it wasn’t steep and my calf muscles were so relieved! Coming down, the trail did one of its quirky detours and this time it was to “The Guillotine”. See my sketch. It’s one of those fun features of the trail. This time a massive boulder hung precariously between two cliff faces. It’s held in place by a number of wedged rocks. I wouldn’t want to be underneath when one of these gave way. The original trail builders must have gone to great lengths to showcase the feature as there had obviously been a lot of effort in making random stone steps down to and up from it. I think that’s one of the things I like about this trail - the care and attention taken to highlight nature’s anomalousness. Camp that night was at Marble Spring, an open saddle with plenty of tenting space and just below that a clear cold spring with water gushing out.","Jennings Creek (Middle Creek Campground)

One thing which amazes me is the quality and extent of infrastructure that has been provided for the Appalachian Trail. A case in point is the foot bridge over the James River. See photo above. It would be over 300metres long - a massive structure all constructed just for the folks doing the Appalachian Trail.The bridge links up with a parking area for a busy highway and is an ideal place to hitch a ride to the nearby town of Glasgow for a food resupply. Once there I met a trail angel who asked if I wanted a turkey sandwich or other food treat. This sounded a much preferable activity than hitch hiking so I took a seat and spent the next half hour in conversation. She was a swimmer who had made an attempt on the English Channel. She trained in the James River and is soon off to Loch Ness in Scotland to see what swimming in that is like. I’d say darned cold! We had a grand time talking of our common aquatic interests, then a car pulled into the parking area and I had a ride to Glasgow! Perfect timing. Once there it was straight into “Scotty’s”, a Grill.   It was full of familiar hiking faces. A side room with lots of open windows was set aside for us! Must be our smell!So I had a hamburger and more conversation about the adventures of the trail. A trip then to the grocery store, a sort out of my backpack, and the disposal of all my accumulated trash to a rubbish bin. I was now ready to return to the trail. No sooner had I stood on the side of the road than a car pulled over and I was on my way back to the trail head. More perfect timing! Surprisingly I got a lot of good walking in that afternoon. Once again there were massive climbs, but the hamburgers seem to do the trick in keeping me going! Our stop for the night was at a spring and large pond at Punchbowl Shelter. 15 or so hikers were there already. Most were section hikers. The numbers of through hikers I meet now are steadily declining as I head north. A fire was going so we made and had dinner whilst enjoying the warmth from the flames. The conversation centred around Ottie Cline Powell, a young 4 year old lad who had died of exposure nearby. This happened many many years ago when there was a high population in the area. He had wandered over 7 miles away from school whilst collecting firewood for the classroom stove. So sad.The banter was that our camp was haunted! That night I awoke to hear noises in the brush but it was just deer. There was however a very haunting glow over the pond. It seems there was a gathering of thousands of fireflies and they gave off the most mysterious and marvellous luminosity.","Marble Spring Campsite

It sounds repetitive but the day was more ups and downs! I did hit 800 miles which was exciting. Then it started to rain. A tropical depression was centred just to the west and was drawing in lots of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. So it wasn’t cold, just drizzly tropical wetness. No need for a raincoat. No sooner would that be on than I would be drenched in sweat. There was a benefit to the rain : it gave my clothes a wash! Things had cleared by evening and I spent a very enjoyable time by a fire with three other campers at Hogpen Gap camping ground: a fine grassy meadow with a delightful gushing spring a ways down the hill.","Punchbowl Shelter

The day started much as yesterday: showers, hints of a significant deluge but nothing too serious. No need for a raincoat, with more wet clothes either from my perspiration or from cloudbursts.It was a day of history for me.The Appalachian Mountains used to be heavily populated during the 1800 and early 1900’s. You wouldn’t think it now given the thick vegetation and the steep valleys. It’s hard to believe anyone could forge out a reasonable living here but they did. Every now and again I would come across rock walls disappearing into the thick undergrowth often with no sensible reason as to why they are located where they are. Why build a wall half way up a steep mountain hillside at a random angle? It made no sense to me. And then I would come across old chimney stacks again in the most curious locations. What history they could tell. Today’s walk brought me across many such structures. Another reminder of the past was Spy Rock: a large rocky outcrop atop a hilltop Knob. It was once used during the civil war as it gave a strategic outlook over the far valleys below and potential troop movements. I took my time imagining what life must have been in those days past. Perhaps too much time, because I didn’t make camp until late dusk. Light was fading fast and by the time I had supper I was eating by lantern light.","Hog Camp Gap Campsite

Another rainy day. This time with more significant precipitation but not enough to get me truly wet. It was a rugged, testing climb up to Three Ridges. The cloud was thick so what was supposed to be spectacular views was instead swirling mist. I have a particularly inflexible right knee so the slick rock was a worry and I took my time carefully negotiating every step either up or down. One hiker past me that morning and he seemed to be flying ... oh what I’d give to have ninja legs! Coming down I came to Reed’s Gap and I saw dimly through gloomy haze a red marquee. Joy what joy! Trail Magic. What a spread! There was even a driver there offering to take hikers down the road to “Devils Backbone” brewery! Given the weather I think every hiker took up his offer and didn’t come back!! But not me! I pressed onwards through what was to be a very misty, view deprived day.One advantage of the rain was it brought out the newts. Australia has no native newts or salamanders so I don’t usually get to see these fascinating creatures that look like a lizard but are not. They can be quite toxic, enough even to kill an adult human. Some Native Americans even used the toxin to poison their enemies. Perhaps because all animals know the newts are poisonous, they seem fearless and don’t move at all fast when I get near. They move so weirdly. Even with their toxic poison, somehow, the newts and their young called efts swim in the rivers and springs without apparently affecting the water safety. At least I still feel fine! At days end I arrived at Paul Wolfe Shelter and once again it was late dusk. There were 3 other hikers there. All had left Reeds Gap before the offer of rides to the brewery! I set up my air mattress quietly in the lofty shelter and dozed gently off to sleep.","Harpers Creek Campground

All along the trail from about Damascus onwards I have heard hikers wax lyrical about the Ming Gardens Chinese Buffet in Waynesboro. Today was the day I got to splurge there!! First was a very easy hike to a trail head by a highway. I rang the owner of “Stanimals” Hiker Hostel in Waynesboro who came and picked me up. At the hostel (which is very very clean and tidy, I love it) I showered, washed my clothes and set up my bed. Then off to the restaurant. Stepping inside it was huge. Quickly ascertaining I was a hiker, the maître de escorted me to a separate air conditioned area. (Hiker smell proof) I was the only one there. But not for long! Soon hikers I hadn’t seen for a week or more started to flood in until we had a room full. Apparently they are a day or two back but the wet weather has been just way too much. So at the bottom of what was one steep slope too many they called a shuttle and headed into town. One hiker had a huge gash above his left eye - the slick rocks were taking their toll on everyone. The buffet lived up to our expectations. I think there were at least 10 different varieties of prawn and shrimps. There were even frogs legs! I finished it off with two servings of cherry cobbler. Oh what gluttony. I waddled back to the hostel oh so satisfied. 20 minutes later I was hungry again! I asked myself how this could be?

The weather forecast predicted a tropical depression would bring lots of rain to the region. 
For once the forecast was correct only there was even more rain than lots of rain. It was a deluge.
And there was no let up. It just kept coming down! 
But I wasn’t too bothered. I spent a lazy morning at Stanimals enjoying the luxury of a proper bed. Breakfast was provided: blueberry pancakes, sausages and egg omelettes. A solid filling meal. 
A shuttle dropped me back at the trail head. 
Other hikers scurried past me, obviously anxious to get to the next shelter 8 miles away before the weather really set in. By the time I made it there the shelter was full - no space for me. 
I decided to press on. Although I was soaked through I wasn’t cold. 
Eventually I saw what I thought was a suitable campsite. But just as I was putting up my tent the downpour really began. 
By the time I was finished there was a lake inside my tent! With all the nutrients on the tent floor from all my days of hiking I think fish began to breed! So I resolved to drain the swamp with whatever means I could. In this case I used my mini towel from my toiletry bag! 
Even after an hour or so of mopping  and wringing out my handkerchief sized sponge wipe there was still a fair sized muddy swamp to the bottom corner of the tent. Lucky I had pitched on a reasonable slope and with my thick air mattress I managed to keep above the sea!!!

Treetrunk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616235,"Day 70 Shenandoah National Park 
I am now in Shenandoah National Park and its very popular Blue Skyline Drive. 
It is kind of like a national park attraction for those folks who want the National Park experience without getting out of their car. Originally the Appalachian Trail stakes claim to the ridgeway which cuts a very long thin ribbon between the broad  Shenandoah River Valley on the west side, and the rolling hills of the Virginia Piedmont on the east. This makes for spectacular views on either side (when it’s not misty, rainy or inclement) 
In the 1930’s the automobile took over . A scenic highway was built over the top of the Appalachian Trail (meaning us hikers had to detour to one side or the other) with lots of wayside stops so drivers could pull over admire the view then drive on. Along with that came restaurants, facilities and so on. Trucks were banned and the speed limit on the highway was set much lower than normal to ensure that drivers took their time to fully take in the National Park experience. 
Some folks were a bit upset by this, particularly farmers whose land the park bisected because as trucks were banned they had no reasonable way to get their produce to market. I guess you can’t please everybody. 
Turns out this national park highway was a great success with the American driving public and the park remains one of the most popular of all American Parks. 
The good thing for me was that there were now easily accessible wayside restaurants and convenience stores every 20 miles or so making resupply and gluttony so much easier. My day included one such stop at Loft Mountain Store. 
It gave me a chance to get out of the rain for a while and dry off. Later the sun tried to come out to the point my shirt dried out. But nothing else ! I really was a sodden mess. 
At night I found a perfect stealth camp on a thick bed of leaves. They were comfy and when it did rain it all strained away. Another bonus too was that I finally managed to drain the cesspool in my tent floor. I slept well.","Stealth Camp near Sawmill Run

Treetrunk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616420,"Day 71 Trail AngelWhen the term Trail Angel is used around hikers it generally is taken to mean someone who provides trail magic ie food! Always a sure bet of delight to a hiker. Today I met a different kind of Trail Angel and one for whom I have the highest respect. He was one of the ones who looks after the trail. This work can take many forms, whether it’s repairing or building new steps and cut aways, digging out drainage lines, taking care of the privy ( surely one of the most unappealing yet necessary tasks), weed management..... The list goes on and on. There are about 20 different trail clubs who look after the path; each one assigned a section and then those sections may be divided into 2 or so miles and allotted to individual members or groups of members. Usually the work seems to get magically done and the ones who do it remain anonymous. But today though I did get to meet up with one worker. He was a criminal lawyer. Then 8 years ago he gave up this pursuit to take up two of his great loves: his motorcycle and the Appalachian Trail! It’s been the best 8 years of his life he told me. His task on the AT is to clear any fallen trees. The way it works is that he is a member of the Potomac AT Club which looks after the trail as it goes through the Shenandoah National Park. They have  Trail Runners who regularly walk(and sometimes run) the trail and report back any issues be they errant hikers, problem signage, fallen trees or whatever. In this case when there is a fallen tree the word goes out to the Tree Trail Angel. He then loads up his motorbike with whatever tools he thinks he needs, rides to the nearest trailhead, then hikes in with all his tools strapped to a backpack and takes care of whatever needs to be done. In the photo above you can see all his saws and axes strapped to his BMW bike. One complication is that much of the trail is designated “wilderness “. This federal nomenclature rules that mechanised equipment is prohibited. That is: no cars, no chainsaws or brushcutters, no generators and so on. Everything has to be done by hand. The saws that the Tree man had were very impressive and some were over one hundred years old. One was a two handled beast that with another trail worker could saw through logs over three feet in diameter. The teeth on it were super sharp and very long. The Tree man hated chainsaws with a passion “Too smelly and noisy”, he said. I spent a very informative half hour in conversation and learnt so much. I left in awe. For the rest of the day I kept on looking at his and the other Trail workers handiwork. I was so impressed. I ended up doing 19 miles for the day finding a secluded stealth camp to set up my tent.! I’m sure I’d have done so many less miles if it had not been for the maintenance angels efforts.","Stealth Camp at Ivy Creek

Today I had two highlights. First was an unashamedly simple porridge breakfast in my drinking mug at Pocasin Hut. I came across this shelter deep in the woods far from any development. It had a timber table on its stone porch that was crying out for someone to sit at and enjoy its service. The other was a far more elaborate luncheon in the dining rooms of the Big Meadows Lodge. My gastronomic fare included the fabled “Mile High Blackberry Icecream Pie” Those who know me will not be surprised... I do love my food especially the deserts! One feature of my walks through the Shenandoahs has been the rustic architecture. President Roosevelt dedicated the Park in 1936 and the buildings all date back to that time. They have such a romantic rural theme. Somehow the lonely cabin that I’ve drawn above is my favourite. It tells me of a time when folks escaped the busy-ness of urban life to find solitude, simplicity and peace in the wilderness and make reconnections which their inner soul. Today’s walk was a more sedate 15 miles, slowed down perhaps by the weight of that fabulous frozen treat. I was also conscious of the weather. Heavy rains were forecast for the evening and I didn’t want another swamp to develop in my tent. So I opted to join  12 others in the Rock Spring Hut, so named because there is indeed a spring nearby that emerges under a huge rock. We were all warm, cosy and dry - lucky thing because it poured down from 10 pm onwards.","Baldface Mountain Stealth Camp

Treetrunk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616467,"Day 73 BearThe park rangers have posted notices declaring all sorts of warnings about bears. They end with the following advice:“If a bear attacks always fight back”.
I have always thought that Black bears which are the bears I encounter on the trail are fairly safe. But I did check o google search and was surprised to learn that there have been 25 fatalities in last 20 years, although most of these have been in Alaska and Canada. Black bear attacks do seem to be on the rise as more folks spend increased time outdoors, and run-ins with bears inevitably become more frequent. Most interactions result in a quick parting of ways. I say my successful bear encounters so far have been when the bear hurriedly takes off. I’m told the statistics show that if a mauling does occur the chances of it turning fatal are relatively slim. But nevertheless there are 1.25 fatal attacks per year. Some interesting (????)statistics: the youngest person killed was a child of only five months of age; the oldest, a 93-year-old female. The average age is 41. The most deaths have occurred in British Columbia, Canada (6), with Quebec, Canada (3) and Alaska (3) tied for second most. Fourteen females have been killed and 11 males. All of this is fairly comforting because the Appalachian Trail doesn’t seem to rate! I heard an interesting tale today from a hiker I’ll call “Sepia Dacks” - I’m using a pseudonym here to protect the guilty! On dusk he headed into the bush to do a “Number 2” As hiker rules dictate he dug the appropriate 6inch hole and set about his intended business. 10 minutes into his exertions he heard a twig snap and through the gloom saw a monster bear approaching. Clapping his hands didn’t seem to bother the beast at which point panic set in! Hastily pulling up his dacks, he called for someone to urgently bring bear spray, a bazooka or something to help him out of this dilemma. Personally I’d have just waved my socks in the bear’s direction. The smell from these have been known to knock out a crazed bull elephant at 30 paces. But then again I was nowhere near.Then logic stepped in. He lifted a large boulder and cast it in the bear’s direction. The way bear psychology works is that bears lift rocks to find food such as bugs and worms. The bear figuring that this animal had lifted a boulder much bigger than it could meant that this was a much bigger bear than it was. Hence it took off. “Sepia Dacks” Then was able to return to his business albeit things were a little less strained.As I say, I’m fortunate in that all my bear encounters have been good ones so far.. the bear has run away. Hopefully on the trail that’s the way it’ll continue to be. My walk today was another good one. The torrential rains from last night had cleared. It was very cold and made for brisk walking.A highlight was meeting up with “The Beast” and “Sweet” (Caroline) who I last saw at Hot Springs (Day 26). They are a French Canadian couple who I really like and enjoy the company of. Funny how for a time they were days ahead of me but now somehow I’ve caught up. I did manage to walk 20 miles intermittently with them and finally camping at a stealth camp nearby. A long day but with the company very enjoyable! At night we were joined by two deer. And fortunately no bears!!","Rock Spring Hut

Today I left the Shenandoah National Park. The stand out feature for my time here has been the quality of the walking trails. Initially a project during the 1030’s depression to provide work for many underemployed men, their handicraft and skilled stonemasonry is still very evident from the many retaining walls, foundations and stone steps to be found often many miles into the wilderness. That they have survived the flooding and icing from severe winters shows just how well the work was planned out. All made for generally easy strolling. Another hallmark were the eateries with their trademark blackberry deserts . Oh yum. But then came the park boundary and it was like literally walking off a cliff! I asked myself, “Where did the trail go? ... Surely not down there?” But inexorably it did, down a twisted jumble of boulders. Gone were the graceful measured and graded steps. Oh boy did I have to be careful. It was such a rude shock. I made my way to the Tom Floyd Shelter perched on a steep slope with its skimpy campsites barely with enough room for a tent and precipitously sloped away. And oh dear the spring was just the location for those who enjoy vertiginous activities. Not to my liking at all especially at the end of a long day. That’s the AT ... just when I get used to a favourable trail condition along comes the opposite! Cunningly, I had brought with me a small cardboard container of wine purchased at the last wayside grocery store to go with my supper.

A few days back I spotted a B&B located just off the AT near Front Royal.Reviews talked about the enthusiasm that the owners Scott and Lisa Jenkins had for their historic home. I decided I just had to stay there. I’m so glad I did. Appropriately, perhaps, I was accommodated in “The Cabbin” which originally were the quarters for the slaves that looked after the expansive grounds and paddocks of the main mansion now called “Mountain Home”. It (the original mansion) was built in 1847, and is a three-story, three bay, brick Greek Revival style home.  There are lots of additions and outbuildings dating mainly to the 1860’s including of course the “Treetrunk “ (slave) quarters, a meat house, a chicken coop, a shed, and two automobile garages (well ...obviously they are not 1860’s!!!) It was a dilapidated ruin occupied by bikie/alternative lifestyle squatters when the current owners took over. But the walls are 3 layer brick with 7 course cross bonding ... it takes a hell of alot to make that fall over!!! Even Japanese 2 stroke motor mountain bike tracks through the front rooms were not enough to put a dent in its pride. Scott and Lisa set to work ( ie emptied their bank account) and wow wow wow I was in awe of what they have done. As a bonus I got to meet with a carpenter who has done some of the work and he lovingly showed me the original circular saw marks on a hidden door panel. Now that is the sign of a craftsman who loves his trade!! The Jenkins are super AT friendly and they have done a remarkable job of restoring the property. It’s now listed on the National Register Historic Places, testament to their unwavering love for restoration. My abode ... slave quarters ... “The Cabbin” is a small brick building that looks like a cottage now, but originally (and still) has logs in the walls.  It is set up with 4 twin beds upstairs ( where I stayed because it’s close to the bathroom!!!) and 2 full-sized futons downstairs, a shared bathroom at the head of the stairs, and a small kitchen on the first floor.  It is generally used by hikers ... well hey we had a lot of fun there !!! And Hiker Magic ... somehow my room was mostly paid for by a guest who took pity on the slaves (hikers) and ... and ... on top of that supper arrived in the form of two family sized pizzas. (Also paid for) Goodness me “Virginia is for Lovers” (that’s the Car Number Plate Logo) and I love Virginia!!
I could wax lyrical about my time there. All I could think about as I went to sleep was a picture of the chicken coop I needed to draw. (maybe originally a corn barn??) I hope I did it justice.
PS Did I mention that on my way to do my resupply in Front Royal I ran into “The Beast” and “Sweeeeet” (Caroline) again?(They are a lovely couple) at ... surprise surprise ... the Front Royal Brewery. Goodness me .. The brewers heard my accent and thereon provided me with extremely oversized sampler (ie free) cups of their wares... of course they needed the “Downunder” perspective. I was obligated to do so! After that, to top it off a thru Hiker from 2017 passed by. And dropped a very thick wad of cash on the table “Are you thru hikers... ?? ... Well buy yourselves some beer”

In the morning, breakfast of locally sourced produce was provided in the elegant dining room of Mountain Home and it powered me through a big mileage day.
 Given I’d had some shorter days I was anxious to do some longer distances. I walked alone and saw few other hikers. The day warmed up and it threatened to rain but never really did. It was extremely humid and my clothes were soaked. 
Just before sunset I made it to Rod Hollow Shelter where there were about 10 hikers some of whom stayed in the shelter. I was in my tent. It is a great setup there ... the shelter is double storey, there are lots of tent pads and sites, and there is even a covered picnic pavilion so that cooking is separate from the sleeping quarters.

Today’s challenge was the roller coaster: a series of very tightly spaced and steep ascents and descents over a 13 and half mile distance. The trouble with this roller coaster was that there was no trolley to jump aboard that with momentum would climb each successive crest. But the name implies fun and I was determined to enjoy myself. Ascents are my Achilles Heal, ( well so are descents too) but with a grin on my face and an early start I can at least give off the appearances that I am having fun. So my plan today was to cut the experience in half. It meant a short day distance wise but I never let pain get in the way of a good time! It was a good plan. Half way through my half way roller coaster I came across the magical number 1,000 (drumroll please) which is a pretty impressive distance to hike by my books. And I was also overtaken by “McDouble” and “Pacecar” another lovely couple I’ve met on the trail who also  started on the same day as me. They also have overtaken me at least 50 times meaning they get to sleep in and take a lot more zeroes than I do. At the bottom of each descent were very rocky screes which I’m guessing come from glacial debris from the previous ice age. The good part was that beneath the boulders came the sounds of tinkling waters so I always made sure I took to find a spring. There I collected my fill of ice cold, sweet acqua  to replenish my sweat strained aching body! By the time I reached my half way point I was well and truly done! Fortunately at this spot the Appalachian Trail planning committee had very fortuitously purchased a residence and then they had converted it into a hostel. Much on the land that the AT runs through is private property. Over the years this land has been purchased to ensure the trail is a continuous feature. At the roller coaster some land was bought that came with a home called “Bears Den”. It was built by a wealthy Washingtonian as his summer retreat. It was a dilapidated mess when purchased but volunteers over a period of years transformed it into the perfect relaxation spa for those smart hikers who chose to only do half the roller coaster in a day. I got there at 2:30 in the afternoon and after trying numerous combinations to get into the keypad locked hikers dorm I successfully found a bed and had a luxurious sleep. That night the hostel provided deep crust pizza and a pint of creamy blueberry icecream.

It was “All You Can Eat” pancakes. Oh how hikers love that AYCE phrase. 
There was a large heated plate griddle ready and all I needed to do was mix and beat up as much pancake mix as I wanted from an industrial sized sack, place it on the hot plate, load it up with blueberries from the fridge and then I was in gourmandising heaven. 
With such nutrition in my belly I absolutely flew through the remaining roller coaster. Those seemingly monster mountains were now mere minute mounds fit for an easy morning stroll. I had fun. 
With the roller coaster done the trail settled down somewhat and it was then generally downhill. I was heading towards Harpers Ferry but decided to camp just short of the town so that I could “Nero” the next day and really take in the sights.

Today was all about American History and in particular the civil war. I was a short distance from Harpers Ferry, a town that played a significant part in former times. My first stop for the day was at the Appalachian Trail Conservatory where I was photographed and given a “halfway” number. When I started I was #1789. At the psychological ”halfway” point I am now #736. I guessing that means that there’s quite a few who have dropped out as my pace is fairly average and I don’t think I’ve past over 1,000 hikers. Harpers Ferry is not the true halfway point, that’s another 70 miles further north. But by the time hikers get here it feels half way and it’s a good place to celebrate. My next stop was “Jefferson Rock” from where I sketched the above view. The landmark derives from Thomas Jefferson, (principal author of the Declaration of Independence) who stood here on October 25, 1783. He reportedly wrote:“The passage of the Patowmac through the Blue Ridge is perhaps one of the most stupendous scenes in Nature. You stand on a very high point of land. On your right comes up the Shenandoah, having ranged along the foot of the mountain a hundred miles to seek a vent.....This scene is worth a voyage across the Atlantic."" I note that he didn’t also add that it was worthy of a voyage across the Pacific. Maybe Australians shouldn’t be bothered with the view!!! Anyways I was impressed. Just below the Rock was the St John’s Church. During the Civil War some of the battles occurred quite close by and the vicar was really scared one or other of the opposing sides would blow up his church. To demonstrate his neutrality he flew the British Union Jack and his was one of the few that escaped without cannonball damage. Lucky he didn’t try the same trick during the earlier War of Independence! When I was a kid we used to sit around the campfire and sing “John Browns body lies a-moulds ring in the grave” I never really knew what the song was about or even if John Brown was a real person. As it turns out one of the next buildings I visited had a lot to do with John Brown. It was an old fire station, and before that it was part of the US Armory. Back in the 1850’s, John Brown was an outspoken critic of slavery and he decided that the only way to end it was with open armed rebellion. So in secret he gathered 19 men and in 1859 they took over the US Armoury in Harpers Ferry. He hoped that this would lead to a slave liberation movement. His plan didn’t quite work out as he intended and sadly not many people wanted to join the revolt. The US Government on hearing its armory had been taken over was not impressed so they sent in their top General ( Robert E. Lee) with a large contingent of men. John Brown was captured and later convicted of murder, inciting a slave revolt and treason. He was hung as a traitor. The government of the time thought  that would be the end of that.Or was it??? Turns out John Browns actions later were to become a rallying point that lead in part to the Civil War. Later the catchy tune was written as a marching song for the Northern Army to keep in step to as they headed off to battle. All that I learnt and much much more as I wandered through Harpers Ferry. I had a great time. That night I slept in a hostel that dated from the civil war times. Everything about the building was scaled down including the doorways. I’m guessing that in the civil war people were much shorter then and needed far less space!","4 mile campsite

Treetrunk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617422,"Day 80 Washington DC
32 years ago I visited Washington DC. At the time I had a brother-in-law who had a very senior position in the White House and actually become Chief of Staff under President Ronald Reagan. So I was lucky enough to have lunch there in the West Wing next to the Situation Room. In true “Treetrunk” style I indulged exorbitantly on fine Reagan Californium wines served by the smartly uniformed men of the US Navy. Washington is a short train ride away from Harpers Ferry and I figured it was time I paid the US capital another visit. Sadly my Brother-in-law is no longer there so I had to accept that my lunch might be in less extravagant. I was up early and at 5:50am aboard a commuter train to Union Station. Once there it’s a very short walk to the US Capitol Building. In this time of extremism it was so refreshing to be able to stroll around it’s grounds without hinderance. Sure there were lots of police around but it felt so good to be able to be so close to what is undoubtedly one of the centres of political power in the world. I think that the views and walks down the mall from the Capitol Building are some of the best in the world and I took all day to savour the experience, meandering to the Lincoln Memorial and then back. Along the way I stopped by Maya Ying Li’s extraordinary polished granite Vietnam Veterans Memorial. I remember visiting all those years back and being profoundly overwhelmed by the sight of all those names of Americans inscribed on the wall and the human sacrifice they had made. It had the same affect on me today. One of the memorial walls point to the Lincoln Memorial. I took time there to focus on Lincoln’s First and Second inaugural addresses that are inscribed on the side walls. They are a noble attempt to come to terms with the Civil War. I sat on the Memorials Plinth and drew the sight down the Mall back to the Capitol Building. The Washington Monument sure is tall! There are a couple of interesting trivia points about the It. Firstly, by Government Mandate no building in Washington can be higher than the monument so as I look around, all buildings are scaled so that the important structures really take prominence. The second piece of trivia is that the monument is topped by a 9 inch (25cm) solid aluminium pyramid weighing 100 ounces (2.8kilograms) The reason they chose aluminium was they wanted the most expensive and rare element they could find as it’s apex. At the time aluminium was by far the most expensive metal and was so rare it was generally only used for jewellery. In fact the small pyramid was considered so exclusive that it was exhibited at Tiffany’s for the public to admire before it was placed on top. Funny how the exclusive can become quite commonplace over time. Sadly I ran out of time to see all I wanted to see and soon I was back aboard the commuter train to Harpers Ferry. I was anxious to get back to the trail. Even though it was late afternoon I grabbed my backpack and headed off making camp 5 miles away on a ridge overlooking Harpers Ferry.","Harpers Ferry

Today’s walk took me along ridge lines that on occasions were interrupted by gaps. At each of these were reminders of the civil war for it was at these openings through the geographical barrier that the opposing sides met to do battle. I took time at each site to read up on what had taken place. It astounds me that the civil war had more Americans killed than WW2. So sad. Later I came across the original Washington Monument built in 1827 at Mt Vernon where the first president lived later in life. There were lots of interesting history facts to read up on. I thought this quote of his was appropriate: In politics as in philosophy, my tenets are few and simple. The leading one of which, and indeed that which embraces most others, is to be honest and just ourselves and to exact it from others, meddling as little as possible in their affairs where our own are not involved. If this maxim was generally adopted, wars would cease and our swords would soon be converted into reap hooks and our harvests be more peaceful, abundant, and happy. My path continued to follow the ridge although the overall height was decreasing. There were stunning views to be had over the adjoining valleys below. That night I made it to a memorial campground for a young man who passed away too soon. It was a lovely spot and a fine place to be remembered by.","Campsite near Ed Garvey Shelter

Treetrunk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617511,"Day 82 Mason Dixon Line
Back in 1750 there was a bit of a property dispute in the USA. One side said the state boundary went one way. The other side had another view. Depending on which side you took Philadelphia was in either Maryland or Pennsylvania!!! Folks were upset. In the end they resolved that the boundary would be set by taking the line of the latitude from the southern most house in Philadelphia and striking west. Above that was one state, below that the other. Sounded good but in reality the latitude is a curved line and at the time no one in America was actually  confident or skilled enough to do such a thing. So they brought in from England Charles Mason who was a renowned astronomer and knew exactly where North was, and Jeremiah Dixon who was able to use Mason’s info to exactly survey the boundary. Their line was marked by stones every mile and ""crownstones"" every 5 miles (8.0 km), using stone shipped from England. Today, while a number of the original stones are missing or buried, many are still visible, resting on public land and protected by iron cages. With their job complete Mason and Dixon sort of slipped out of folks vocabulary. But then along game the civil war and the Mason Dixon Line was often quoted as the separation between Free States to the North and Slave states to the South. It is still used today in that figurative sense, as a line that separates the North and South politically and socially. Fascinating history ..... all the more because today I got to cross over the Mason Dixon Line. It was kind of a sad farewell to say goodbye to the South. The people were so hospitable, courteous and welcoming. But forward I must travel and to the North I went! Just past the line I ran into a group of young people fast asleep in their tents. One of the rituals and challenges of the AT is the “four state challenge” and these hikers had just completed it and were fast asleep for the next three days recovering from it! The challenge requires the hiker to visit the four states of Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania following the Appalachian Trail and within 24 hours. It’s a 44mile distance. Well, in my youth I could have done it. Hey I could still do it. But if I did I’d miss out on getting my number at the “psychological “ half way point, Harpers Ferry, Washington and so on. But more importantly I’d need a week to recover! Anyways it’s the fun of the trail and great to see young people having a crack! The trail after that was sort of flat and I made good time to my campsite at Tumbling Run. Quite a sweet spot. I met back up with the French Canadian couple “The Beast” & ”Sweet” and we had recollections of our journey. I also met up with a couple of section hikers who had just started at the Mason Dixon Line. “Boy the trail was tough today ... very steep” I nodded in agreement silently remembering how I thought the trail had flattened out. Funny how my hiking strength has changed!","Pogo Memorial Campground

Treetrunk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617595,"Day 83 A Quick Resupply
One of the logistical headaches for me on the trail is the resupply. 
With luck I’ll plan it just right and be totally running out of food when I hit the resupply point. That’s always a test because at resupply time the food can become increasingly heavy and no one wants to carry food they don’t actually eat. 
My second concern is the location and quality of the resupply ... usually a large grocery store, but sometimes something smaller with less options at double the price. 
Then there’s the procedure of actually getting there. Sometimes it can be miles from the trail and I’m just not accustomed to hitch hiking. 
Well today was my resupply and I felt quite smug and pleased with myself because I was totally out of food (which is the way it should be a resupply). 
But My resupply point was a long way off trail and I would have to hitch. Oh dear. 
I came to a busy highway heading to Fayetteville Pen. It was on the down side of a hill and the vehicles were picking up momentum as they roared on by. Out of the trees the sun beat down on the tarmac. It was very hot. 
So I positioned myself, took a deep breath, ... stuck out my thumb ... and prayed! Cars and trucks raced down the hill I was on. I was having no luck at all. I waved and smiled at them all, gritting my teeth and whispering,
“Please, please take pity on the Treetrunk and give him a ride” 
Alas. They were not into telepathy! 
Just as I was about to start walking the miles and miles to the store a pickup truck with a canoe roared by.  Then salvation! It’s brake lights came on! I had a ride. 
I threw my pack in the back and soon we were barrelling down the highway. Not too long later the driver wrinkled his nose and asked if I wanted some fresh air as he powered down the windows. 
He was a builder and was using his Sunday morning to go kayaking in a nearby lake. As we pulled into the supermarket car park he said he’d drive me back to the trailhead after I’d finished shopping. 
“I just love your accent”, he said. 
Incredible and so warm with hospitality. 
I shopped as fast as I could and before I knew it I was back on the trail, carrying 3 plastic bags laden withresupply goodies! 
Finding a shady bench I sorted everything out, had lunch and even topped that of with some icecream! Sometimes resupply is as easy as that. 
My day went smoothly from then on and before too long it was late afternoon and I’d arrived at Birch Run Shelter. 
There were about 8 through hikers staying there and the talk around the shelter picnic table that evening was the half gallon icecream challenge. Tomorrow we would officially pass the half way mark. Soon after that was the Pine Grove General Store where all through hikers are expected to eat half a gallon of the icecream of their choice in as short a time as possible. We all went to bed that night trying to figure out what flavour to choose! 
P.S. My picture today is from a couple of days back. It’s of High St in Harpers Ferry. My hotel/hostel was at the top of this street. Really quaint place and worth a visit.","Tumbling Run Shelter

We were almost at the half way point and I was anxious to get going. When I got there, the actual marker was not that impressive at all. Some small pebbles delicately forming the 1/2 sign. The reality is that the position changes every year because the AT distance changes every year due to route adjustments, detours and possibly more accurate means of measurement. ( I’m sure some of the uphills are much longer and higher than they report) Some years folks had gone to great lengths to make elaborate signs to celebrate the half way point and I later past these. Next stop was the general store at Pine Grove which was in a State Park. The “Icecream Challenge “ is a popular tradition for AT hikers ... scoffing down half a gallon ... it’s an indication of just how (greedy) hungry hikers can get. I was with “The Beast” and “Sweet”. His strategy was to choose Neopolitan meaning he had three flavours to choose from and wouldn’t get tired of any one.  Her strategy was DNS (Do Not Start). My choose was “Cookies and Cream” figuring the cookies would provide better calories. They don’t make actual half gallon containers any more. Some marketing genius at the icecream factory figured they could reduce the container size without anyone noticing... but us hikers did so after finishing one container we are provided with an additional pint container to make up the difference! After round one “The Beast” was 3 minutes in front then at the finish he completed his half gallon in 32 minutes. I was a respectable 4 minutes 30 seconds behind. But to my credit I was still hungry so I then ordered a hungry hiker burger and French Fries. “The Beast” was content with a mere Cheese Burger! They have a hiker museum nearby which has one of the first signs from the top of Mt Katahdin, an original hiker shelter (I’ll never again complain about the standard of shelters in the Smoky Mountains) and lots of other memorabilia. After that I set off back on my hike. Half way up the next hill I felt really ill. No idea why. But as I hiked on things settled down until by evening I was hungry again. I camped on a ridge above a stream called Whisky Spring. I’m figuring long ago there must have been a secret still around here somewhere but sadly I couldn’t find it!","Birch Run Shelter

Treetrunk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617674,"Day 85 Boiling Springs and Open Farmland One of my fond memories from “The Coast to Coast Walk” in northern England that Mrs Treetrunk and I did several years ago was of pathways through open farm pastures. There were grand vistas of patchwork fields, farm buildings and row houses in the distances. The A.T. usually is not like that at all. It’s a green tunnel. But not today! The path broke free of the forest and we were in pastures, maintained by the AT to retain the rural farmland feel of the locality. So picturesque. I was crossing over a very very wide valley from ridges on one side to ridges 10 miles or so on the other. In the middle of that was the village of Boiling Springs. How delightful it was, set around a large pond formed to service small steel kilns from the 1800’s. The industry is now gone, but the kilns are still there. They are not big, almost like mini Mayan pyramids and sit peacefully in the woods. The other thing in the valley were a number of busy highways. I can’t get over how hectic they are, particularly coming from the Northern Territory where I can drive for 300 km and not pass a car!! Climbing up the other side I made my way to a secluded campsite. And just in time. When I was safely in my tent down came the rain! It poured for an hour then out came the stars!","Campsite near Alex Kennedy Shelter

A number of days back I slid on a rock and with that my shoe sole separated from the main body on one side. I now had several toes poking out so it was time to get a new pair! I was pretty pleased with the runners I had. ( Yes, I don’t have boots!) They’d lasted 700 miles. Most hikers I meet only seem to get 450 miles out of their boots or trail runners; the path is so tough on them. I’d never done a mail order in the USA but there’s always a first time. I knew I was to be coming in to the town of Duncannon and it had a hotel there called “The Doyle”. It accepted packages for hikers so I made an order for the same trail shoes I had before, and had the delivery address as The Doyle Hotel in Duncannon. Hopefully they would get there. Anyways today was the day I’d get to Duncannon and I was excited to get my new footwear as my exposed toes were not enjoying smashing up against the trail rocks. Coming down into the town it was a steep slope. A couple of young hikers I knew ran down the steep slope past me. “How do they do that?” I asked myself. If I tried that my hike would be over in a flash as I would stumble and do myself a major injury. I carefully plodded on, placing my trekking poles diligently on each stride, scrutinising where to place them, and guiding my exposed pinkies past every step. Once down the bottom I entered the Main Street of the town. Boarded up shopfronts, dilapidated facades and empty buildings told a tale similar across many small towns. 
I stepped with anticipation into the Doyle Hotel, it’s faded paintwork matching the general demeanour of the precinct. There was a pile of packages there but none for “Treetrunk “ Hmmm?I checked my emails and today there was one from the shoe company. “Order Cancelled” The lady behind the bar suggested I ring them up. I asked for a bit of coaching and put the phone on speaker. I nodded to the lady behind the bar and she placed a beer in my hand, then turned down the volume on the TV. When I got past the inevitable computer generated greeting and keypad punching I was told by the operator that the order was canceled because I had a foreign credit card from Australia. There were chuckles all around from everyone at the bar. The bar lady placed another beer in front of me. I pleaded with the operator that I was doing the AT and needed shoes now. Our conversation plodded on and the bar lady suggested I needed to be a “squeaky wheel because I was in America and the squeaky wheel gets the oil”4 or 5 minutes later the operator said if I placed the order anew on the internet she would intercept it and make sure the computerised system didn’t cancel it again. “Can you overnight the delivery?” I asked. “Oh sure, that’ll be a $25 charge, and that should get the shoes there by Monday at the latest” The bar erupted in laughter. See it was Wednesday and “overnight” obviously had a different meaning than what I normally understood it to mean. The lady placed another beer in front of me. So it was resolved that I redo the order, on the internet, then call the operator back and proceed from there. Ninety minutes and two failed orders later, I eventually had success, and the operator assured me she’d do her best to make sure overnight really meant overnight. Robert Burns wrote “The best laid schemes ‘o mice an’ men often go awry”, and I settled back contemplating “especially when computerised logarithms are involved”. That evening the local Lutheran Church put on a hiker feast. One of the ladies had a blueberry patch and her pie with homemade icecream was an absolute treat. I went to bed that night with a full tummy.","Campsite near Darlington Shelter

The hike today was in secluded isolated forest. I
t felt like we were a world away from civilisation. All I could hear to remind me of the outside world was the occasional jet aircraft flying overhead; or if I really listened the distant rumble and horn of a freight train a long long distance away. 
About mid morning the planes seemed to really pick up and they were a lot noisier and close by than what I’d expect. 
Suddenly there was a staccato explosion as if some giant beast had expelled a belly full of foul air after eating too many eggs and beans. It was really loud. 
I was sure that one of a plane’s engine had exploded particularly as the plane then seemed to make a high pitched wail as if it was in rapid descent. I thought oh dear is it going to drop on me? 
I was in dense forest so I couldn’t see any sky really and I had no idea where the plane was. I waited and waited for the inevitable plane crash, but nothing happened. 
Then another explosion and more wailing plane engines. What the heck is going on I asked myself. 
There is one man who would know ... “Polarbear” who is an Airforce aficionado. 
When I told him of what I heard he got most excited. 
“I’m so happy you heard that” he gleefully exclaimed, 
“That’s the A10 Warthog and the sound of a Gau-8 Avenger going off.” 
“We call that the Elephant F@rt and it’s the most lethal gun around” 
He then poetically waxed lyrically (Maybe he he misses Kamdesh) about its 30cm barrel, it’s gatling-gun operation, rounds that go off at twice the speed of sound and so forth. 
I’d never really heard of such a thing but if you are a weapons connoisseur you would know all about this beast. 
Apparently when it was first created they had to come up with a new plane design to handle the thing otherwise it would shake the aircraft to pieces and the soot and debris from the cannon made the plane windscreen opaque. 
“Polarbear” told us that we were near a military firing range and it was likely that these pilots were getting their last training before being deployed. Given there is rising tension in the Middle East right now it kind of explains the training they at doing. 
Which got me to thinking that whilst I’m in my hiking bubble there is an outside world out there and despite my best efforts sometimes it lets me know it’s still there. They say that it’s not reality that bites, rather our perception of reality that bites. 
With that in mind, next time I hear that sound I prefer to think of it as an Elephant F@rt and not the more lethal consequences that this gun can unleash! 
On that note, we had a very peaceful hike ending up in a sweet campsite by a playful stream that I got to wash my feet in. So relaxing after a long day.

I started off my morning by exploring the area around our campsite from last night. A plaque nearby explained that back in the 1800’s it was a village of over 1,000 people supporting a coal mine and steam engine repair/manufacturing. The mine turned out to be unproductive and the people all left. Soon the forest swallowed what was left. It was easy to miss at first but I found the old walls of a number of dwellings, a couple of old wells and walls now with massive trees growing through them. There must have been some floods because the ground level is now much higher. The fun part of the day was the next event. Apparently beavers had dammed the river and now the Appalachian Trail was under water. The trail organisers had arranged for a detour for those folks who didn’t want to get their feet wet. But for purists it was possible to take the authentic route. Given the option of either a genteel dry walk or a slog in the bog I naturally choose the latter. Who wouldn’t want to miss some fun playing in mud? We don’t have beavers in Australia. Our closest animal is the platypus but it does not dam rivers. So I was very interested to get up close to see what beavers do and also to see their “house”. The dam itself was quite large. Amazing the effort that must have gone into creating it. We waded through the slime... it was a bit smelly but we were smelly to begin with and at least this way our feet got a wash. I would guess that we had a 300 yard crossing and the water went up to our upper shin. Once that bit of excitement was done our day returned to its normal self of ridge walking. In the distance we could hear thunder getting closer. Soon a storm was upon us. I didn’t bother to get out my raincoat. It was so hot and sticky the raincoat would just increase perspiration.  Either way I’d get wet. The rain really pelted down for a while and despite getting soaked through, it felt wonderfully refreshing. Then the rain stopped and within a short while I could feel everything drying out. Coming to a saddle there was a camp with a fire going ... somehow they’d managed to do that despite the rain. We were beckoned over ... it was trail magic!!  3 guys had hauled up over 2 miles of rocky track ice chests full of drinks on ice, hot dogs to cook on the fire and lots of other junk food. Just what a hiker likes. We took our fill and thanked the boys so much for their generosity. We made our way to the next shelter where once again the rain poured down. I sat down at a table and an English gentleman said, “I know you!” Turns out he remembers having a beer with me 5 years ago at a pub in the middle of Yorkshire , England when I did Wainwright’s Coast to Coast walk there.

Treetrunk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618301,"Day 90 Stuff that has Worked
Today was a long day of walking with lots of trees to look at! When I’m not looking at the trees I think of other things.As I get further and further into this hike I think of the things that have worked, things that haven’t and how I can improve. The one thing I think most folks think about is how they can reduce the weight of their gear without compromising safety or comfort. It’s said that the elevation change of hiking the trail is the equivalent of climbing Mt Everest 16 times. After a while every pound of gear feels like 10 lbs and the quest is on to find ways to trim the excess. Of course there are always some hikers who are the ex army types and who lug a 100 lb monster to prove to someone how strong they are, but after a while even they come around. The pack I chose was a Hyperlyte Southwest 3400. I chose that after months of google research, chatting to hikers who had done the AT and so on.The pack is made with a miracle fabric called Dyneema also known as Cuben Fibre which is super light weight, is waterproof, and depending on its overall density is very hard wearing. The marketing blurb says that whilst Kevlar is considered 7 times stronger than steel, Dyneema is considered 15 times stronger. Needless to say ...  It’s bulletproof. The design of the pack is simple .. it’s basically a roll up sack with hip belt and arm straps attached ! Back when I was a youth, it used to be that packs were made from canvas or a synthetic equivalent. These are tough but they are much heavier and when it does rain on the trail which happens so very often they get wet and then they get super heavy. Some folks use a rain cover which of course never really works when you want it too and they also add weight. When I started I didn’t see too many people using my pack. They were a rarity. But now I’m half way it they have become very popular. One weird thing is my pack is white, although every day it seems to get more mud smudges . It has that patina of muddy swamp camouflage!. But the white colour is a good thing because at night I can see it, and I am always so pleased to look in my pack and clearly see where I’ve lost my wallet!! So that’s one thing that’s really worked for me on the trail. As I think of other things I’ll write them down!As for my day ... Well after looking at lots of trees it was fairly boring. Basically we entered a forest and kept walking for much of the day without seeing views or places to get an idea of how far or where we were going to or coming from. But at the end of the day we came to Stony Creek, which was full of stones and not much water. I did find a deeper pool and used that to soak my feet. My deep pool became a mud pool. So then I found a stony pool and rinsed off. Then bed!","501 Shelter

Today was a  resupply day and a short one. The trail continued its way through the forest as it did yesterday, then we came out on a viewpoint and I could see we were on a high ridge overlooking a deep valley below. Next thing we started a very steep descent and in very quick time we were in the town of Pt Clinton. I was told a couple of days ago to go see the Barber Shop . It was on the other side of town but we did and I’m so glad we did. Inside was the very welcoming 71 year old Frank Russo who said,”Come on in, have a coffee, charge your phone, take a seat, have a chat.” For 71 he is in great shape and I asked him what his secret was. “ Oh I like to play live rock and roll music on my electric guitar... it keeps me young!”, he said. Apparently he’s very good particularly doing Jimmy Hendrix rifts and his barber shop often has live gigs while he is doing haircuts and usually he joins in! The shop is incredibly popular and most folks of the neighbourhood seem to visit some time or other. Frank didn’t seem to care if I wanted a haircut or not ... it was all about the company and comradeship. He collects all kinds of memorabilia which he displays in the shop. Cassias Clay ( Muhammad Ali) used to train in a gym just up the road and he has his boxing gloves hanging up, plus all sorts of other stuff. I was fascinated by all that he had and the conversations going on with the customers. I ended up spending most of the day there. At some point a customer said he was going to Walmart located in a nearby town; I asked if I could get a ride as I need to resupply and he said yes. After Walmart I walked over to Cabela’s which is a 5 acre outdoors shop. Largest in the world apparently. Amazing inside but really it didn’t have much in the way of hiking resupply. But, what it did have was a free shuttle back to Pt Clinton so soon I was back at the Barbershop! That night I stayed in the Pt Clinton Pavillion which is a special covered area just for hikers.

A while back there was an ice age and there was a massive glacier that picked up the most jagged, pointed and sharp rocks imaginable, and transported them all to the northern section of the AT in Pennsylvania. The smoother rounded rocks it left them be. The glacier eventually melted and deposited all those rocks on the trail. Thereafter the area here is called Rocksylvania and is a devil to walk across. I was nervous about this so stayed for the morning at the Barber Shop. Much better conversations there than the swearing and cussing at the rocks that I knew would occur. Eventually I had to move on and it was a steep uphill. At some point the trail diverted almost deliberately to outcrops of scary gnarly boulders with limited handholds. At this point it started to mistily rain making the rock surface especially slippery. What a trial! There were a couple of outcrops very popular with the locals called “The Pulpit” and “The Pinnacle”. Great places to take a breather, admire the view and regain my composure! But then the trail designers took pity on us hikers and diverged away from the rocks to a smoother path. Trotting along this I met another hiker coming the opposite direction and he asked if I was a through hiker. On hearing that I was he produced from his pack an Indian Pale Ale! “Enjoy your meal tonight!” he said, “because tomorrow you have to do The Knife Edge” I made it to a grassy campsite by the shelter for the night and googled researched “The Knife Edge”. There are lots of them around the world on hiking trails, and all of them challenging to say the least.

I don’t know what was worse, navigating the Knife-edge or continually skewering my feet on the pointy rocks of the path. I’d had the night to think about the rocks and I resolved to go very slow and carefully. The most captivating were the huge slabs which moved when stepped on. There was one called the balance rock which I’m guessing would have to be over 15 tons that I could move with my hand as it pivoted on another. The knife-edge itself was a series of massive slabs on a 45 degree angle atop a ridge. These were not at even angles and were often separated by deep, wide fissures requiring a lot of courage to leap across or negotiate. Why the AT needed to go via this ridge is beyond me ... it would be far easier to gently contour around at a lower level. But the trail went that way and like the obstinate fool that I am, I followed the path. Some genius had painted white arrows up and down and around the boulders. I was mystified as to how anyone could actually follow the route they proposed but being the purist that I am, I made my best effort at keeping true to the path. My strategy was to take it easy and not think too much about the consequences should I slip. The reality is that a fall potentially would be spectacularly nasty. I must admit I let out a huge sigh of relief when I was over the worst of it. Of course later on I came across Baker Knob which was a re-run albeit with smaller hunks. That was it for me! Not too much further on was a shelter and so that was a good place to set up camp. I was done with rocks for the day and rested up ready to navigate more of the same tomorrow.","Eckville Shelter

A short time after I started the Appalachian Trail I ran into “2-Speed“ and for a time we hiked together. Then I slowed down and he and a number of other hikers soon were two days in front of me. But then they slowed down or I speeded up and the next thing I knew was that I was in front! That’s how the trail is sometimes! “2-Speed” had already done many sections of the trail dating back over a decade. This time he was going to do a complete through hike. But personal commitments came up and he had to get off the trail. So then he decided to return to finish those parts he had missed out on and at least thus complete a section hike. This week he finished that and to celebrate, he arranged to meet a group of us for triumphant refreshments. Today was the day. We had a merry old time in a park near the town of Palmerton. It was great fun. Next came the not so fun part of today. The walk out of Palmerton involved a massive steep climb. There were times I had to take my pack off and throw it up a ledge before I could attempt to get up the ledge unencumbered. The area was a Superfund site. For folks in Australia that means it was an environmental disaster zone. The government here has a fund to help restore sites which have been severely affected by toxicity of some kind, often from mining when the company has run out of funds before it has made good the land it has denuded. In this case there has been zinc mining for over 100 years and the site for a while was a lunar landscape plus there are a number of springs that are now noted as for emergency use only. ( I take this to mean that if you drink the water from the spring you will end up in the emergency ward of the local hospital) I understand that the team undertaking the restoration works have done a stellar job of revegetation. Still it was a roasting oven on the rocks. Now if I had read my guide I would have known that there were repeated warnings to not attempt this climb at midday because it’s so hot. But I was having too much fun meeting back up with “2-Speed” to read the guide  and so of course we set off at midday. Somehow I made it to the top. For a while then there was a smooth path. But not for too long. Eventually it was back to the rocks of Pennsylvania. I clambered on. I was supposed to meet up with the rest of the group aways ahead. But at 8pm I knew I’d run out of puff so I made camp in a clearing overlooking a valley below. It was a perfect spot because it was July 4th which apart from being Independence Day is also Firework Day. I had a grand view of all the numerous explosions and skyrockets going off. It was a fun and long day that ended with quite a bang!!","Bake Oven Knob Shelter

The rumbles from all the fireworks last night kept echoing until midnight and strangely put me to sleep, eventually! I had hopes that Pennsylvania would let up on the rocks but I was sadly disappointed. They increased in their intensity and duration. There would be times when the path smoothed out but not for long. It was a tough old day. Hot too, with limited water availability.It’s said that the only difference between stepping stones and rock obstacles is how you use them.

Pennsylvania was not going to let up on the rocks as I neared its boundary with New Jersey. And there was a special little rocky outcrop to contend with too first up: Wolf Rocks. More stacked boulder slabs on precarious angles and the AT would have us go along the upper edge. But I knew the drill: slow and steady, check each foot placement and don’t look down! I was glad it was over once I had done it and also very relieved that the copperhead and rattle snakes known to call this their home didn’t come out to say hello. Although they were there.The morning heated up quickly and the humidity was intense. It seemed the atmosphere was begging for the opportunity to explode with a thunderstorm but didn’t quite have the catalyst yet. The conditions made my mood so much more negative on the stony path. Then, just as I reached the outskirts of Delaware Water Gap, the town on the state border, the rains came down in a deluge. I scurried to Church of the Mountain where there is a hiker hostel. It quickly filled up with walkers seeking refuge. I grabbed a bunk, then a shower and waited out the storm. When it was done the hunger pangs set in so I headed into town with friends for a hamburger and beer, then apple pie and icecream at the Apple Pie Bakery then a resupply. We rested a bit then headed back to town to do our laundry. Just as we were finished drying our laundry an alarm went off on my smart phone.”Flood Alert” It was the emergency services warning of a heavy storm heading our way. Heading back to our hostel with our dry clothes, the heavy storm let loose so our dry laundry now became wet again. Then the local tornado siren went off indicating that a tornado had touched down in the immediate vicinity. Too much fun. We made it back to the hostel safely and dried out again!I slept well knowing there was a dry roof over my head!","Campsite near Spring

The Delaware River is the state border between Pennsylvania and New Jersey and there Is a busy long bridge connecting the two. I took off early and made a celebratory large leaping footstep when I reached the official marker sign. One more state down! Trucks roared by and the bigger ones made the bridge harmonically jump as if I were in a bouncing castle. Not a safe feeling at all so I hurried on to the next side. At first the path was paved and when I did reach the woods there was a Park employee waiting saying “Welcome to New Jersey!” Such a nice thing to do. He was just checking on all the visitors and smelling that I was a through hiker he knew I was pretty okay with the park, where to go, park etiquette and so on.The path itself ? Well I could swear that someone had taken a file to all the rocks and smoothed off the edges! I made quick time out of the river valley and back up into the higher lands. The rocks of Pennsylvania were as a consequence of glaciers and now for the first time I encountered one of their other creations: glacial lakes. Some were quite small, others dry depressions, and other picture perfect reflection mirrors. I took my time in contemplation.Then as I wandered down a ridge I heard the call: “Hiker Up!” It was a mob of past hikers called “Riff Raff” and they’d set up a trail magic pavilion with every booze drink imaginable, plus sandwiches, apple pie and every other junk food feast you could ask for. I was in heaven. Later (much later) I staggered up the next ridge to an old realestate development site that the Nation Parks had purchased. The levelled home sites made the perfect campsite for many tents. There were about 12 of us there. We all were so grateful for our midday feast and rejoicing that the Pennsylvania rocks were now a thing of the past.","Delaware Water Gap

Early morning there was the pitter patter on the tent fly, then the rain steadily increased in intensity and was still going strong at the dawn. The old cleared home sites that we were camped on had varying degrees of drainage. I was lucky: on my site the water ran off to one side. But for some others, their site had become a lake with their tent in the middle!!! Packing up in the rain is never much fun, especially as the wet tent adds extra weight to the backpack. I put my tent in a large outside pocket of my pack. It has drainage holes so in theory some of the water goes away. Our route today followed a ridge line and I was mesmerised by the rolling clouds that filled the valleys below. Every so often the ridge was punctured by a gap, through which usually was a busy arterial highway. We came to one of these that led to Dales supermarket in Branchville, a couple of miles away. Sadly for us we had no luck hitching a ride and it was a hot long walk in the afternoon sun. I think there must be something about “The Beast”’s French accent because he struck up a conversation and soon enough had an offer of a ride back to the trail head. It was a small car and we all squeezed in with our packs on our knees. I had my pack right up against my nose. Oh boy I did not realise how bad it stank! My pack was so rank!!! How the rest of me was?? Dear me. Goodness me that poor driver in the small vehicle. It must have been stinky even once we had left. They say the odour sticks around a long long time. That shows true generosity to have put up with us lot! We walked on another three miles to a shelter where we set up our tents and let them dry out. I had brought with me salmon and a pomegranate salad from the market. It was delicious and certainly helped me sleep well that night.

It’s at the end of a country lane, set in an idyllic open grassy pasture.

Nearby the “Secret” shelter was Howlers General Store, Unionville. It was a short 0.7 mile walk off trail in the fresh cool morning air.  I can say that in the late hot afternoon it would be a very long 0.7 mile!! Unionville struck me as a very typical americana peaceful village. It was still festooned with flags and red, white and blue ribbons from the 4th July. The general store had a comfortable porch that I kicked back on and enjoyed a breakfast sandwich. I stayed an hour but could have stayed so much longer. But the trail was calling! Much of the day was through swamplands and marshy nature reserves. These often had boardwalks so the walking was easy. Towards the end of the day we came across Heaven Hill Farm. I was ravenous and bought a blueberry pie plus a pint of berry icecream. I didn’t finish the pie and felt quite ill from such a full belly. Somehow we made it back on the trail, up the next ridge and onto our shelter for the night.","Jim Murray’s Secret Shelter

The big worry for most hikers is the tick. These tiny little monsters carry awful diseases which if contracted can end the through hike. At every trail head are warnings about Lyme Disease and what to look for. Trouble is the Deer ticks that carry the disease are tiny and so hard to spot. I did find one tick on me today but as far as I can tell it was not the one I need to worry about. I had gone into a disabled toilet and spotting a mirror I took off my shirt to do an inspection. There it was.. just out of reach of where I would normally feel on my back. Gosh they are cunning! But I got it!! Relaxing over breakfast at a picnic table outside I struck up a conversation with Al, a local resident. He was enthralled with my walk and he wanted to help out however he could. That afternoon he met me and another hiker at a trail head, presented us with an icey refreshing drink and then drove us to a supermarket for a resupply. So kind. Back on the trail it poured with rain and I cursed the Trail designers for they had us traverse a rocky ridge. Normally that’s okay but in the rain the rocks were treacherously slick.

The hospitality shown towards hikers continues to amaze me.The trail today explored rocks. Not the Pennsylvania sharp pointed ones, but truly massive ones. One such rocky outcrop was called the lemon squeezer and was not only a tight squeeze, but also a test of small cliff climbing. Somehow I made it through without getting too squashed!Arriving late in the day at my planned shelter there was no near water supply so I trudged on. I came to a spectacular old water tank that I drew as well as a newer one that had a water spigot. Only trouble was that it was behind a barbed wire topped chain mesh fence. So, I detoured to Lake Tiorati, a local state park, way down a hill, where I knew I could get water. It also had showers but alas these too were behind locked doors!! Frustrating. I traipsed back up the hill. It was late in the day and I was so tired.

The trail today led relatively close to New York City. By relatively close I mean 30 ish miles or so. It travels along ridges and from a couple of these I could see way off in the distance the New York skyline! Icould quite easily spot the Empire State Building as well as One World Trade Centre that replaced the twin towers. The humidity was high and so the view was not as clear as some days, but I still could make out the great city. I felt so excited to see it. The temperature also was quite warm and natural water sources few and far between. Fortunately folks took pity on the hikers and left water jugs at most trail crossings. In the afternoon I sure needed that. Late in the day, the trail dropped down to the lowest point on the Appalachian Trail, at 124ft, which is beside a bear cage in the Trailside Zoo! From there it crossed the Hudson River via a spectacular suspension bridge, and then a vicious climb back up the ridge at “Anthony’s Nose”. By now it was late in the day, but the hot sun was unrelenting.

Lots of weekend Harley Davidson bike riders were out in force and it was a popular place to take a break. From there we moved on a few more miles then took a break by a road junction where there was a running  brook. Every 5 minutes or so cars would drive past and most stopped to ask how we were going and if we needed anything. One lady even gave us a bag of cherries and bananas, so kind. It made us want to stay much longer, but the trail beckoned and we were on our way.

A fair day of Hot hiking up and down hills!Now, maybe l sound repetitive! It’s hot. Oh so hot. Somehow when I decided to do the Appalachian Trail, I thought it would be in an idyllic environment where I could hike and never sweat, never feel hot, never swelter, know mugginess or torridity. That dream was eroded today. The heat was never ending. Now my dream was to leave New York State and head to the North Pole. Perhaps then the weather would cool down. I closely monitored my AWOL guide that told me where I was on this long pathway. Maybe if I walked faster I’d escape the fieriness? I watched closely for every piece of shade. Problem was even in the shade I felt as if I were in a steamy furnace. Trudging down a hill I spotted a road. Sideways down that was a deli. Refreshments maybe? A mile or less I got there and I saw “Sweet” by the strip shops, only one of which was open: The Mountaintop Market Deli. ( Not on top of a mountain and not next to a market, rather neighbours to a Quarry/ Cement Plant) “Sweet” signalled to me to head out back. Wow there was a verdure oasis back there. There was an abundance of foliage surrounding a manicured lawned small pasture. Already there were 4 “Big Agnes” tents set up. I note “Big Agnes” because this is a brand many through hikers swear by. There were picnic tables and the deli provided the drinks. (Well we did have to buy them.)

The tranquility was broken but I slept through it. Funny how hiker exhaustion does that. Others however slept fitfully and moaned of the disturbance. I made myself some coffee in the morning and chatted with the group. Sadly this included a number who were ending their hikes due to injury, lack of motivation or plain bad luck. But they cheered us on as we headed off. The weather was cooler but not by much. The hills on the other hand were getting steeper! Another deli was a short 15 miles away and I had that as a goal. Alongside the way I stopped by Nuclear Lake, a very beautiful and picturesque place to pause by for a while. I was fascinated to learn how it got its name. Apparently it was named after a Plutonium Plant that blew up. It was a private research facility licensed by the government to experiment with bomb-grade uranium and plutonium. The lake was chosen for the operation because it was ""the largest convenient and available tract that was not crossed by public roads and could be adequately guarded for secret experiments.” But then in December 1972 there was an explosion that resulted in an unknown amount of radioactive plutonium dust dispersing throughout the structure and surrounding shoreline and woods. The blast blew out two windows in the experimental nuclear research lab, which was positioned alongside the lake. Those folks who were living nearby were not so happy about this so the plant was closed down and after some checks the government handed over the lake as a park saying all was safe. Despite those official assurances, the local residents were not so convinced so they did their own checks. They’d heard rumours of barrels being dumped in the lake in the middle of the night. Their report indicated that ""unusual objects"" were found to be in the lake. So then the government sent in scuba divers (presumably in radioactive proof suits) to go take a look. They didn't find any barrels, but they did find rocks, tree stumps, a sunken jeep and a sunken boat."" Sheepishly the jeeps owner came forward and admitted that the jeep found its way to the lake bottom when it was driven out on the frozen water in winter, the ice cracked and the vehicle fell in!!! So the area was deemed safe and is now part of the AT. Despite these assurances I decided not to fill my water bottle from it or anywhere near it. It was beautiful though and a number of Canadian Geese gently swam by. After A 15 minute break I moved on and next came across the Appalachian Trail Railway Station. I was surprised to learn there is even a functioning railway station named after the trail and true enough on weekend for $44 return I could get a ride to New York City. Trouble was it was not the weekend. From the station I did a 0.5 mile detour ( 0.8miles in reality) to Tony’s Deli. They had excellent sandwiches and air conditioning that did not work. But I was out of the afternoon heat at least. Later we ( a rag tail group of 5 hikers) were back on the trail and up another hill to a stealthcamp. In the open woods it was beautiful indeed as we watched the sun set over sandwiches made with care from Tony’s place.","Deli campground near NY Route 52

More hot weather! Over the past few weeks of walking I have developed a possibly unconventional idiloligical belief that if I kept on heading north from New York then the climate would get cooler. It was based on my theory that the closer I got to the North Pole then the cooler it would get. Today we were to reach the next state of Connecticut, ie north of New York ergo colder temperatures, so I made haste! Sadly when I got there, there was no dramatic temperature decrease! Actually it seemed to get warmer?? I reached the town of Bulls Bridge where there was a historic covered bridge over the river. Somehow the traffic engineers had so safety barriered it that it had lost its charm to me! But there was one joyous site. (sight) A through hiker had set up a pavilion with trail magic. I had to stop! It had an ice chest filled with ice and under that cold drinks. I don’t know why but I ended up staying much longer than I intended. All was fine. I met up with 4 slack packers who I have been racing with, plus of course “The Beast” & “Sweet”. However, when I got going about an hour or so later I realised I’d badly miss calculated my hiking plans. I had intended to camp at a shelter 6 miles away but the trail turned nasty. Rocks, boulders, cliffs and hot hot conditions. Every barrier imaginable was thrown in my way to slow me down. And to top it off an ex hurricane thunderstorm came hurtling in with torrential rains. Even then it was still hot! With the difficulty/sheer stupidity of the terrain I had no hope of getting to my goal destination.

It was a relatively easy walk following the Housatonic River valley with detours up and over mountains on either side. But the heat was brutal and I developed heat rash in every inconceivable place unimaginable. It hurt and my pace reduced from its steady slow to a pained hobble.

I watched sunrise there and the sight of the humidity clouds lazing in the valleys below was awesome. Then it was into Massachusetts!

I had to make a long run for it. The deer flies bite in and the only satisfaction is that they are slow to let go so a good hand wack disposed of that problem. But if I was too slow it left a really nasty bloody sore that potentially could get infected. When past the swamp I was faced with another steep hill but my legs had had enough! I did my best to climb up as high as I could then I found a flat spot and made camp for the night!","Brassie Brook Shelter

Treetrunk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619900,"Day 112 Cold Front I had grand plans to make miles today and rejoin my friends “The Beast” and “Sweet”. I was up early and made the first shelter before most of the hikers were even out of their tents. I stopped, boiled some water for a coffee and chatted to a hiker. “Rains coming”, he said. I hiked on and the skies threatened. At lunch I made the next shelter, ate some peanut butter spread on a tortilla with tuna, and then was about to head off. The sprinkles of rain started and I paused. “Maybe I’ll wait a couple of minutes,” I thought. Then the rain really started coming down. A steady stream of hikers arrived at the shelter. One told me a cold front was moving in. Meteorologically it was converting all the humidity I had been experiencing in the air over the past two weeks to precipitation. Then there was thunder, lightning. At this point I made a decision: no more hiking today!! On reflection one of the best decisions I’ve made all trek. From then on the rain intensified and intensified. The shelter was full and we all watched the heavens explode with a torrent. I was so glad I was under a firm roof. I had a platform for my mattress and went to bed early listening to the downpour outside. I was so glad I wasn’t in my tent! My drawing is of a corner detail from one of the hiker shelters. The Hut was built by a group of hiker mates in memory of one of their group who passed away. They went to a wood working class and learnt how to use old hand tools and the traditional craftsmanship of working with timber. They then built the hut in a garage, perfecting their techniques. When the hut was looking just as they wanted they disassembled it, hauled it up a mountain and reassembled it ready to help out hikers in need of shelter.","Stealth Camp uphill from Boardman Street

One of these is :“The Top Ten Shelters on the Trail” Top of the list for most blogs is “Upper Goose Pond Shelter”. It was on my mental note of places to stay and today I got to stay there. All night it had been raining torrentially and the morning arrived with no perceptible change. At least I had dry socks to put on even if that wouldn’t last for long. I was more concerned about the condition of the trail though as I had a steep descent first up. But as it turned out there were not too many rocks to slip up on and the path was generally grippy compacted soil. It was cushioned so going down hill was much easier. Towards mid morning the rain eased up and by the time I made it to Upper Goose Pond ( which to my mind is actually a large lake) my clothes started to dry out. At the shelter I met up with the two caretakers. It’s one of the few places on the trail that had these and they do a warm and caring job of welcoming everyone. There were about 20 staying the night most of who stayed in the upper floor in a bunkhouse. I chose to tent a little ways away on a tent platform. It was quiet and peaceful. In the bunk room “Yardsale “ a thru hiker I’d met several weeks ago had left me a note about my watercolours. He was a faster hiker than I, and he was about 4 days in front of me. It’s amazing how we all keep in contact! Lots of hikers see me water colouring. These days most folks are doing Volgs. Once upon a time watercolours were what most folks did on their adventures ( I’m referring here to the 1800’s!!). Anyways I really enjoy the way it helps me relax and that’s what I did most of the afternoon. The caretakers did also suggest I take a swim in the lake. (hmmm? I really smell that bad?) I did that and it was so refreshing. The water was incredibly clear and the fish occasionally nibbled at my feet. Also quite a relaxing sensation. The shelter is set up to avoid any soaps or detergents entering the catchment zone so they have set up washing stations with trapping systems to catch any chemicals, food stuffs or shampoos. I took the opportunity to have a shave and wash my clothes knowing it was all safe. The atmosphere at Upper Goose was so  sedative and I slept well that night.","Mt Wilcox South Shelters

Treetrunk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620016,"Day 114 Gordon Ramsay’s Hotel from Hell
I like living to a budget ( but please don’t tell my financial director that!). For this adventure I’m living on roughly US$280 a week or roughly $6500 for the whole thing. To my way of thinking it’s a generous budget for my trek, more than some hikers and less than others. It means I have to be a bit picky and choosy on where I stay, what I buy, the gear I use and even where or if I stay. Note that this budget doesn’t include the cost to get a visa into the USA ( for me over $1500 due to costs for an interstate interview, accommodation etc) or airfares from Australia to USA ( another$1500) or hiking gear ( $2500) Most of the time I’m really comfortable in my tent but there are times I really crave for a home cooked meal and clean linens. So I watch my budget. I pay for things either by my Australian credit card or if it’s minor I carry a small amount of cash. Every couple of days when there is internet I check my bank balance, especially after I have been in a major town. A few weeks back after staying in Delaware Water Gap I noted there was a double charge on my credit card from a supplier I did not recognise. Hmmmm?? what to do. Eventually I sought out my banks web page and followed the links to contact them. Of course I got a message back “http not recognised “ But I persisted and after numerous web searches sent off a message to the bank credit card officer. A few days later I got a response and after a bit of back and forth I was advised who the supplier was. It was a charge from many many weeks ago but curiously only now was being processed. It was suggested that I directly contact the supplier, a hotel owner, or alternatively my credit card could be canceled and Visa would take over. So I opted for the first option only I had no telephone number so I did a web search. The first hit I got was “ Gordon Ramsay Hotel from Hell”!!!This certainly intrigued me! At the time I was sitting on a log in the middle of a forest and about half way through reading Gordon’s experiences I fell off the log belly laughing! He totally encapsulated my impressions of a hotel owner I had met. His descriptions of the establishment??, the going ons in the back rooms, as well as the strategies of the supplier were unbelievable! Only, having met the hotel owner they were totally believable. Needless to say the culprit for all the troubles at the establishment were blamed on the hikers or the computer technology! Armed with this information I rang the supplier. The conversation lasted a long time! Well it took a whiles during which time the owner blamed the computer and other hikers ...  but then it was agreed I get a refund. She said “Well what must have happened was I double clicked the “Charge” icon.” ... “Now what I must do is double click the refund icon.” I said nothing but silently agreed “Yes” There was a long pregnant pause.  “Oh no no!” ”If I do that you will get a double refund.“ I said nothing. She asked that I call her immediately if I did not get a refund. Well I checked the next day and no refund. Or the next day. Or the next. No refund. I laughed to myself and dwelt on what my next response would be. My financial director suggested I contact Gordon Ramsay. I also asked myself how many hikers check their accounts for a supplier who inadvertently and totally by mistake “double clicks”. However, today I got a refund. Now the way Visa and foreign exchange works ( they deduct their fee both ways) there was a lot less refund but refund it was!!! Yippeee! Some days are diamonds. My supplier was one of the characters of the trail. On a totally different subject ... today I met a much loved character and true trail angel: “The Cookie Lady” For the last 30 years she has devotedly cooked a daily batch of cookies and whoever knocks on her door, she had some plus refreshments! I have heard so much of her and it was a moment I’ll treasure that I met her. Sadly she’s on in years and frail. But she loves to greet everyone on the trail and she is one of the ones who makes the AT the legend that it is. I enjoyed my cookie plus a sofa she has for sale. It energised me to hike on and I made it to the next shelter and a very pleasant night’s sleep.I should also add that at the Upper Goose Pond Cabin they also served up pancakes and coffee. It certainly was a gourmet day!","Upper Goose Pond Cabin

Only this time my shoe scraped against a sharp rock and sliced my shoe open. I had no idea at the time but last night as I was taking my shoes off I stuck three fingers through the hole. Now I understood why every time I stepped near a puddle of water my feet got wet. Well I was upset. I so wanted to get 700 miles out of my shoes and I was 300 miles short!!! Anyways this morning there was a nearby coffee shop and it was a superb opportunity to sit, rest and work out what I was going to do. I found out there was also an outfitter in the next town who would meet me out the trail head, take me to his store, fit me with new shoes and then I’d be on my way.

Our camp at the Mark Noepel Shelter was at the perfect location to climb Greylock Mountain which is the highest peak in Massachusetts at 3491feet. It was about halfway up, so in the morning I was up early and on my way. I got into a rhythm and before too long was at the top. There is a Lodge there dating from the 1930’s, and it serves breakfast. Although I’d already had a coffee and porridge back at camp I was ready for eggs toast and more coffee. They have a lovely dining room and I spent a long time there, just relaxing and enjoying the view. Pretty soon I was joined by many of my fellow hikers from the night before who are hiking together as a team ( apparently called “Team Odour” !!). We sat around a long table and had great conversations. Then it was time to go down the other side of the mountain. Pretty much a long 3,000 foot descent into the community of Williamstown. Once there I walked half mile off trail to a supermarket and loaded up on a resupply. It was by now a hot afternoon and like most resupply days the supply point is at the bottom of the hill and the next shelter all the way back up the hill. I had ambitious plans to go a long way but my pack was far too heavy and the temperature much too hot. So when I came to a “Pete’s” spring and a camping spot a shorter distance in I called it quits for the day. Finding a level spot for my tent was a challenge, and that soon became a dilemma for many hikers as we all seemed to make a similar decision to call our day short due to the conditions. My dinner for the night was a fresh salad and salmon. It was heavy to haul in, but a delicious meal. Best off, it meant my pack would be much lighter tomorrow as I climbed higher.","Mark Noepel Shelter

The climb out from camp turned from steep, to very steep, to rock scramble. I’m glad it had not been raining as the rocks would have been scarily slippery. Once at the top of the ridge things flattened out for a while and I came to the state border with Vermont. It’s affectionately called Vermud by walkers and it wasn’t too long before I knew why! Somehow the trail seemed to morph into a dark brown oozing swamp! Every other step was a challenge. Sometimes there were rocks to step on, and oftentimes there were not. The worse were those patches of mud which were disguised to look like a rock but were really a sunken surprise! Quite a few times my step descended into the slime, but fortunately not past my sock line!!!The state line is also the southern starting point of “The Long Trail” and for the next 100 miles of so, it and the AT share the same route. It’s a popular shorter hike so I was joined by many new hiker faces. We joking also noted that “The Long Trail“ is also the longest river in Vermont! There really was a lot of flowing water adding to the muddy conditions. Not too long after crossing the state line I also came across another highlight: the 1600 mile marker. It felt good to be gradually accumulating more distance. That night I made camp by a large beaver pond. There were lots of these I passed by today. Maybe they are responsible for all this mud??!!!","Sherman Brook Campsite

All night long it seemed that there was a light misty rain falling as I often heard what seemed to be raindrops falling on my tent fly. Curiously my fly was dry in the morning and I then realised that I’d chosen a tree to camp under that was being eaten out by caterpillars. The raindrops were really small pieces of leaf falling down!! Much of the day was spent in woods with no clear view of what was about me or even what was coming up. I find this frustrating at times, boring even, because even though I’m surrounded by beautiful trees and mossy boulders that evoke comparisons to “Lord of the Rings”-ish scenery, there comes a point when it starts to all look the same. Several sections today were designated wilderness areas so this did emphasise the remote nature. Then I came to the top of Glastenbury Mountain only as I say I was in a dense forest so didn’t really know I was on a mountain top.  There was an antique fire tower there dating from the 1920’s and I climbed on up and had a glorious view that in an instant told me where I came from and where I was going. It was a small tower, with a tiny deck at the top. I don’t think I’d be that comfortable standing up there on a windy day. But today was calm and I had a contemplative panorama before me. Coming down the mountain I had plenty of beaver ponds. It was certainly a damp environment and very beautiful too. Trouble is the beavers do tend to foul up the water supply so I had to be careful with my filtering. I arrived at my camp for the night, Story Spring Shelter, quite late in the day. Somehow the remoteness, and picturesque beaver ponds must have made me walk slow. It did have a super fresh, cold spring that was an envigorative elixir to enjoy with my supper.","Melville Nauheim Shelter

Today was a day I ran out of energy. It’s weird, there are some days I get exhausted and others I’m full of vitality.Maybe it’s a rhythm of life thing. Just as the world is vibration and nothing in nature is at absolute rest. It seems that everything is in a state of energy flows and in all flows there’s a rhythm to be found. And so it was that today I was zapped of energy and not brimming with it. I had a large “hill” to climb: Stratton Mountain at 3936 feet. It had a restored firetower on it with another glorious view. It was also the exact spot where Benton MacKaye conceived the idea of the Appalachian Trail. It’s also the spot where sitting in his tent in the rain in 1909, James P. Taylor conceived of the idea of The Long Trail that would run along the ridges of the spine of the Green Mountains all the way to Canada. A very special spot. I stood there for a whiles but no great ideas came to me. Maybe those energy flows were too far in the negative!! The trail was very smooth heading down, then it reached a plateau and went flat ( sort of) for a good whiles. Along the way I heard a grunt behind me. Turning I saw “The Beast” and “Sweet” again!!! So good to see them. They were off to a shelter another 6 miles away but sadly I had to advise I just did not have it in me to make it that far. Instead a couple of miles further on I turned off the trail and came to a charming shelter built in the 1950’s.

I decided on a shorter day today as I was still feeling a little tired. I packed up and was on my way quite early. At the next trailhead was a busy highway at the crest of a saddle between two ridges. Cars naturally slowed down and no sooner had I stuck out my thumb than a lady pulled up and took me into the town of Manchester about 4 miles away. She ran the local pizza restaurant and always stoped to help out hikers on her way to work. She dropped me off at “Up for Breakfast“ which is a very popular breakfast cafe and is upstairs!! I looked at the menu and instinctively I ordered steak and eggs. I had not had red meat in quite a while and perhaps my gut brain was making an executive order! I’ve got to say I felt so much better after that good feed! From there I went to the local supermarket for a resupply then I called the folks at the Green Mountain Home Hostel who drove on out and picked me up. To my great surprise they had an Australian flag flying outside!!! Inside the hostel was immaculate and had everything a tired hiker would want: comfortable bed, clean bath, spacious kitchen and a homely lounge room.

From there it was a significant climbing day up Bromley Mountain which must have been full of roots, rocks and mud because it was very easy to slip over. But I did not.

But I rested less, meandered less and tried my best to quicken my pace! Sure enough at the end of the day I came across a blue roofed pavilion with many many hikers boisterously chatting away. There were jugs of every refreshment conceivable! And I joined in the merry throng. What a great way to relax at the end of a strenuous hike. Just on dusk I moved on and in the falling light found a great stealth site not too far away.

Lots of gorgeous sights. It started off with Little Rock Pond, a picture perfect lake that was steaming slightly as the morning air was still a little crisp.

Everyone seemed to have a tale to tell!!! The path continued on through terrain that was not too steep coming to a couple of rock gardens that gnomes mysteriously had created. Every so often hikers would pass on by and add their creativity to the mix. Later there was a waterfall to take my lunch by. I eased on up to get some water and in an instant slipped on the damped rocks. I think that is about fall number six and like all tumbles on rocks it hurt a bit. But nothing broken, I just lay there a while figuring out where I had misstepped  and how I’d avoid doing the same thing next time. There was a bunch of hikers taking a rest there, tecalling the adventures from the night before. Then a slack-packer walker came past from the other direction declaring there was trail magic 8 miles forward. That seemed to be a signal for everyone to move on in haste! There was indeed trail magic at Clarendon Gorge, which is a popular swimming spot further on. Once again there was a party like atmosphere and it was the perfect location to enjoy a beer and soak in the sight of the water as it tumbled down a series of rapids. There were rocky deep swimming holes too, the afternoon temperature was warm and many were taking the opportunity for a much needed bath! I stayed awhiles and was tempted to camp as many did. But I knew the next day was going to be a strenuous climbing with many steep ascents. So I moved on to the next shelter at least.

Others called for an Uber. I just got to the road and stuck out my thumb. Just in time someone called out and said I was hiking the wrong way!!! So I crossed the road and almost immediately got a ride, which did not impress the group waiting for their Uber! The hostel was very clean and homely. That night we were invited to join in their religious meeting. Not many accepted the invitation probably fearing they would succumb and be captured by the “cult”’s mysterious ways. But I wasn’t so concerned.

I chatted for a short while to “Nightingale“ over coffee and oatmeal, packed up and then sauntered along the path. There were two mountains to climb: Smarts and Cube. Both steep and quite challenging for me. Towards the end of the day I found a stealth spot in a valley. It was hidden away amongst some pine trees and I slept well.","Trapper John Shelter

I ran into Snowman and Kilroy who I’d met months ago. I thought they were way in front but here they were and we had a great afternoon recalling and discussing our adventures. Tomorrow would be our first taste of “The Whites” There is a saying here : “When you reach The Whites there is only 20% of the distance left but it takes 80% of the total effort required” So we all rested up in anxious anticipation of what was to come. Snowman was going to take a slack pack to get over Moosilauke as he had heard the descent coming down the North way was very treacherous. The slack pack would take him the opposite direction so he would be climbing the difficult part which is so much easier than coming down. I made a playful challenge to him to see who would got to the summit first: him without a pack v me with my fully laden pack!!! It’ll be an interesting competition!That evening we all were shuttled to a nearby cafe where we purchased subs and red wine. Perfect!!,"Stealth Camp near NH 25A

Treetrunk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621452,"131 Entering the Whites I was keen to make an early start particularly as I had a challenge on with Snowman to see who could make it up to the top of Moosilauke. He would be coming from the opposite direction. During the night it rained heavily but fortunately as morning arrived it slowed. My tent was wet (and heavy) but not too bad.I headed up the slope and pretty soon it became very sleep. Up and up it went. After three hours though it flattened out, indeed it even became a sort of road! ( I learnt later it once was a road!!)Finally I arrived at the summit. No Snowman. I’d won the challenge!! There was a chilly breeze and the clouds were very low meaning I had virtually no view so I didn’t really stick around long. I didn’t realise that there was more than one trail and at first I took the wrong one. Fortunately I picked up that I was going the wrong way so I didn’t have too much of a climb back up. After 45 minutes or so I met Snowman plus a bunch of other hikers who were heading south. Their news was grim. I would be heading down a waterfall with treacherously slippery steps and high cliff descents. I didn’t like the sound of it at all!! However, Maine beckons! and I continued on hoping that it was mischievous hype. But, ... it wasn’t and for several hours I gingerly made my way down. Fortunately I slipped only once and that time it wasn’t too far a fall. What a sign of relief I had when I made it to the bottom. Of course then the trail went straight back up the next hill. I looked at my watch and on a fit of silliness kept on going. I figured the next campsite was not too far away. Trouble was, I hadn’t taken into consideration that this was “The Whites” On top of that it started to rain making the rocks, roots and boulders I had to get over, super slick. I had figured on getting into camp at 6.00 pm. As it turned out I arrived at 8:30. The sun had set and it was dark. I was so tired and so grateful when I got my tent up.I lay down and went to sleep.","Hikers Welcome Hostel Glencliff

We became great friends. They had a holiday house in Maine and suggested that if ever I was in the locality then to give them a call and we could get together. Well ... now I was nearby! It was an opportunity to break up my time in The Whites and get some R&R. So today I arranged with John to collect me at a trailhead and then I’d head off to the Atlantic and spend some time enjoying myself off the trail. The trailhead was relatively close by. I spent the first part of the morning helping the “Croo” at the hut clean up. My task was to sweep out the bunk rooms. I also got to have some breakfast. Then I took it very easy to get the rest of the way down the hill to a parking spot beside the interstate freeway. Right on schedule John arrived in his lowered BMW sports and before I knew it I was in Harpswell Maine overlooking a gorgeous scene of boats and the setting sun. And for the evening dinner it was surf and turf. Fresh Maine lobster, straight off the boat and super thick steak from their charcoal grill. I was in luxury. This was living the dream! My sketch today is the view from Lonesome Lake.

However the trail beckoned, and it was time to get back to the trail. At 5am John was up and we soon were on our way for the three hour drive to the trailhead that I’d left three days before. My legs were fresh and the initial climb seemed so easy. The trail went through thick forest up to Liberty Springs that was just below the ridge line. A series of hollowed logs carried an icy cold stream from deep in a rocky cliff. I filled my container and savoured the refreshing water. Soon I reached the Franconia Ridge which links a series of high peaks. At first it was still in the woods, but climbing higher I reached the tree line and the views exploded in front of me. They were awesome! Soon I reached the first peak, Little Haystack which also had a popular walking trail linking it to the road far down in the valley. Masses of day hikers were there and they all seemed to walk in clumps onwards towards the next peak: Mt Lincoln and then Mt Lafayette. At times it was quite crowded but my eyes were on the distant horizon; the views were just so spectacular! High on the shoulder of the last peak was Green Leaf mountain Lodge and the day hikers all seemed to turn off towards that. There was only the occasional rare through hiker or section hiker who continued onwards. Suddenly it seemed so lonely and quiet! I followed the ridge line in a gentle descending curve to a Pond and then it was another steep climb up to another high Peak: Mt Garfield. It had stunning views from a granite ledge which is this journal entry’s drawing. I spent quite a while there in quiet contemplation before descending down a ridge to the Garfield Ridge Campsite. It had a series of wooden platforms for tents and there were lots of folks there. There was a separate cooking area and I spent the remainder of the evening chatting with fellow hikers and discussing the amazing views that we had had this amazing day.","Franconia Notch

But I sure went slow!!! When I totalled up my ascent/descent (a feature on the app I use on my smart phone) I didn’t actually achieve a lot of climbing, but my legs certainly were tired at the end of the day. I was lucky enough to score leftover breakfast at one of the huts and then at Zealand Falls Hut was offered work for stay.

I didn’t mind at all as I’m an early riser and love the morning walking especially when it is so peaceful. As it turned out the first section was flat! Such a surprise after all the ups and downs I’ve recently had. The area was full of boggy swamps and lakes, quite picturesque. Then I was in for a huge surprise. Dropping down into Crawford Notch was trail magic. The Class of 2017 had a gathering and put on the most amazing spread of cooked breakfast. And I certainly enjoyed it. Hiker Hunger has set in and before I knew it I’d had three breakfast sandwiches of bacon egg and cheese. Plus two IPA. Then to top it off two coffees!!! Before me was a huge climb up to the Lakes of the Clouds Hut which is just below Mt Washington, the highest peak in these parts at 6,288ft. Thanking everyone I then headed up and up! There were great views half way up at the Webster Cliffs where the trail hugged a series of ledges that overlooked the valley below! Further up I reached Mizpah Spring Hut where I had a bowl of warming minestrone soup. I knew it would be late when I got there, but I pressed on now with swirling misty clouds around me. Visibility was very low but the path clear to follow. On these hills my pace is painfully slow at around 1 mile an hour. But I was delighted in the scenery. Somehow the foggy atmosphere made everything seem magical! Then just on dusk I rounded a corner and there appeared the Lakes of the Clouds Hut. There were lots of hikers there, many choosing to sleep in “The Dungeon “ a dank basement area. But for $10 I was given permission to sleep on the dining room floor after the guests had finished their supper! It was fine by me.

Treetrunk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621697,"Day 139 Mt Washington Mt Washington is the highest peak in New England and has the worst weather in America. This comes about through its location at the intersection of two weather systems ie the North Pole generated weather and the Atlantic generated weather.Back in April 2 1934 it was the centre of a huge storm that produced wind speeds of 231 mph which apparently is the highest recorded wind speed ever anywhere! Many other storms have also occurred with equally intense winds and low temperatures. The good news was that fine weather was forecast for today so I was in luck for my climb today. I started out early expecting a fine day. No luck! It was thick fog which was weird because during the night I could see the twinkling lights of settlements far below. The path was clear though so I headed out. First sign I came to said “Warning. ... turn go back now if the weather is bad.” Well the fog was bad but the indications were that it would lift. Sure enough by the time I made the summit things started to look clearer. I had my photo taken by the summit sign just to prove I’d been there then headed onwards towards my next destination Mt Madison. On paper it didn’t look too tricky but the reality was quite the opposite. It was totally exposed and a mass of sharp rocks of all shapes and sizes. Plus on top of that the trail either went steeply up or down. Great fun!! In my usual manner I went slowly and carefully, so sure enough soon I was quickly past by the throngs of other hikers, some already sporting gashed knees from taking mistaken liberty with the acrobatics the route required. It was like that for most of the day and though difficult I really did enjoy the change and challenge in the landscape. So much different from the “Green Tunnel” I was normally in. Then, towards late afternoon I reached the tree line and a very steep descent. I was now in the Gulf Wildeeness. There was a formal campsite at the base but I still had a couple of hours so I pressed on. The trail now contoured horizontally and I crossed lots of gushing streams. I’m guessing that all the rocks in the ranges above acted like a giant sponge and now at the base the water collected was flushing out in torrents. I was hoping to make it to a lodge further on but light was fading. So, I found a perfect campsite under some pine trees and got to bed just before it was totally dark. A great day.","Lakes of the Clouds Hut

Treetrunk,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621840,"Day 140 The Wildcats Up and down the trail, folks relay the next terror tale of what ridiculous climb or descent is coming up. It seems every evening the hiker conversations speak of new horror scrambling and clambering stories. I then wake in the middle of the night with apprehension, fear and trembling. Just how am I to get my tired aching legs and knees up and over or down these cliffs and boulders? Today’s feature was “The Wildcats” which were a series of 4,000ft peaks. I had no idea what was to come but as I was often told: “You have been warned” First though I had to make quick tracks to the Pickham Notch Visitor Centre down at the bottom of the Wildcats. I was still in the damp rocky root obstacle course of the Gulf Wilderness and made slow work of that. What a relief to eventually come to an old road and smooth walking! At the visitor centre was Joes Lodge and I was greeted with the advice(?): “Treetrunk, if you don’t eat breakfast here you are a fool” Well I think that just doing the Wildcats and the AT probably raised serious questions about my sanity, however just to prove to my hiking friends that I was not a fool I took up the $15 AYCE breakfast challenge!Wow what a feast. I gorged in total happiness. The food was great and as any AT hiker would appreciate, there was lots of it. That done it was to the Wildcats! First up was a boulder nightmare around an old glacial lake. Then the path took an ominous turn upwards! Sheer cliffs beckoned. Don’t look down. And so it went on for a couple of hours (at least for me!) Finally I reached a peak (called Wildcat E) then another (called D) and another! At this point I rounded a corner and ran into a finely dressed lady in clean smart shoes carrying a handbag. “Whaaaat?”, I thought. “There’s no way she could have carried that handbag up those cliffs and not mess up her shoes?”I rounded the next corner and there was a ski gondola depositing day visitors for a view!! Well clearly they were taking slack packing to a new level. I stopped had lunch, then completed Wildcats B and A. Way down below I saw the Carter Notch Hut. There’s a saying “What comes up, must come down” So down we went. Much to my relief with steps this time! It was by now late in the afternoon and I asked if I could get work for stay but the manager wasn’t interested in me. Before me and intimidatingly high up was Carter Dome, another daunting climb. Dangerous thunderstorms were now forecast and I really didn’t  look forward to another ascent. But I had little choice and off I went. Thunder rumbled in the distance but lucky for me that’s the closest I came to the storms. When I reached the summit I was gifted glorious views all around. The descent down was grimly back to crumbly, slippery cliff faces. But I made it to Zeta Pass where I recalled there was a spring. Sadly my new phone decided at this moment to reject the Guthook app which told me where I was on the trail. So I had no idea where my water source was. That’s the luck of new technology. I wandered a bit further in the fading light and set up camp.

I sat and contemplated all the energy I had taken to climb Mt Washington then past Mt Clay, Mt Jefferson, Mt Adams, Mt Madison and finally down the ridge line to Pinkham Notch. The route looked so clear even though now it was miles away.There were more mountains to climb today, but nothing as tough as the past few days. After that was a steep long descent to Rattle River named I’m assuming because all the pebbles rattled along as they were washed along by the gushing waters. At the bottom trailhead I met up with “Anchor” who calls himself an AT tourist as he picks and chooses which parts of the trail to walk and then does it “slack pack” or gets someone in a vehicle to carry his stuff from trailhead to trailhead. During the past weeks I’ve met him numerous times as he races past me. Somehow he takes half the time it takes me to do the same distance though I guess it helps not carrying a pack! Anyways he’d already finished the day, had cleaned up, gone into town to get supplies and was now waiting in a car for a friend. He very kindly gave me a package of nibbles to re- energize myself since I was so slow! Down the road was the Rattle River Hostel and I decided to stay the night. First rule was: Shoes off they stink! - they don’t come in the house. Next: Pack off, it stinks! - It doesn’t come in the house. Next: Clothes off they stink! - they don’t come in the house. They must be washed! Finally: You stink! - you don’t come into the house before you’ve had a wash! All of which was totally true and I agreed with. I had a lovely wash then wearing an eclectic mix of loner clothes I was shown my bed for the night which was very comfy! Not long later there was a call that the shuttle was ready and a group of 6 hikers including me were taken to the local Walmart for resupply. I’d calculated I’d need 5 days of food for the next section and I walked out with half a dozen bulging plastic carry bags. Back at the hostel I managed to discard most of the cardboard packaging and squeeze my supplies into my food bag ready for an early start tomorrow. It was so heavy though! I’d also bought a salad, chicken and red wine - a luxury dinner for tonight. The hostel was so warm and friendly and I was so happy to be staying the night.","Zeta Pass

Hundreds of thousands of years ago the cliffs above the riverbed had cracked off depositing huge jagged rocks the size of shipping containers. Now my task was to get through them. Well my strategy was simple enough: if you can’t go over it and you can’t go round it then go under it! And that’s what I did. I took off my pack, pushed that through the tiny passage ways under the boulders then crawled on through myself. It was a total workout in a jungle gym! Crazy thing was that under some of the boulders was ice and snow from the winters before!After about one and one half hours of this a tiny voice inside my head said: ”This ain’t fun anymore!” So I took my phone out and using the GPS app looked up where I was. Goodness me I wasn’t even half way through!!! Well I kept on going and after 3 hours 52 minutes I was out of there. Much to my annoyance one “young-un” later told me he did the boulder section in 35 minutes. How he did that I do not know. But I guess my knees and leg agility just ain’t what they used to be!!I took lunch and then it was time to tackle the Mahoosuc Arm, a near vertical ascent of over more than 1000 feet. If I wasn’t tired from the boulder scramble then I surely was once I’d reached the top. But what a sense of achievement I felt. Suddenly I knew I had completed the toughest sections of the AT!! And I was still in one piece. Maybe it had tried to eat me but I’d somehow avoided that fate! I had one more climb that day, up 4065ft “Old Speck” but somehow even though it was tough, I found it to be a breeze. That night I stealthed a ways down the other side. I had found a fresh mountain stream and beside it the perfect space to set up my tent out of view.

There was some fog about but it cleared to reveal wonderful vistas before me. Going down there was rope and ladders. Things were certainly getting serious!!! I took my time and didn’t get eaten! From there it was all the way down to a mountain road. I hurried along as I knew at 4:30 there’d be a shuttle to “Human Nature Hostel”. I’d heard much about this accommodation and didn’t want to miss out. With minutes to spare I was at the road before a huge suburban van arrived and with 3 other hikers was off towards the town of Andover. Once at the hostel, it was a similar experience as to my previous stay ... that is ... I and all my belongings “stink” ... so have a shower and leave everything outside before entering. The hostel is run by “Yukon” an ex Marine. I could tell by the way everything was spick and span and in its place. So very clean and spotless. The hostel was a huge three storey dome.

The Human Nature shuttle dropped me and a group of other hikers back at the trailhead at 8:30am which is kind of late for me. It meant I’d really have to move on to meet my planned mileage. 
The slack packers zoomed on past me making for the next trail head. They’d make it there by 1pm but at my pace 5pm is a more realistic time. 
Soon I was on my own. The woods were so peaceful and beautiful. I came across the picturesque Surplus Pond so I sat down and had an early morning tea. It’s places such as this that I just have to stop at and make time to soak in the atmosphere. 
Like every day there were a number of mountains to climb with tricky descents to negotiate. My pace really must be getting slow because when 5pm came I was still on the mountain. Then some hikers past me and said that if I hurried up there might still be Trail Magic left at the bottom of the hill. Well that certainly was an incentive! 
I really increased my pace but still that would be much slower than the younger ones! At the bottom the “Old Buzzard” Camp was just starting to be disassembled. He and several others had set up camp at Black Brook Campsite for the last two days handing out stew, hotdogs, chips and drinks to the passing hikers. I helped him pack up and lucky for me he scraped his large cooking pot out and there was stew for me too! 
I had originally planned to climb the next mountain and camp as I knew the next day had lots of big climbs and I wanted to make start into it. But my full belly from the stew, plus the fact I had a Pabst beer delayed those ambitions. I helped “Old Buzzard “ pull down his tent then I set up mine. I resolved the mountains can wait.

But often I was rather enclosed in the “green tunnel” and relied on my GPS with the Guthook App on my phone to establish my progress.

Two cups of coffee though had an effect and I was soon on my way. Today I got to see lots of lakes and ponds and fortunately the trail was relatively flat so I made good progress. First up was Long Pond ( yes, it was long!) and Sabbath Day Pond where I had intended to reach the previous day. I met up with some hikers who I’d walked with briefly yesterday. They’d made it to the ponds but late and agreed that yesterday was a tough walk. That made me feel better. Then came Little Swift River Pond where I stopped for a long morning tea. Very picturesque. I had another long break at South Pond. Coming to the Piazza Rock Lea-to I had to take an inspection of their privy called “Your Move”. Its a two seater for those folks who enjoy taking a bathroom break with a partner. They even have a cribbage board set up between the thrones for those who want a game in between doing their business!!! Well it’s not for me but I did check out the facilities and they were very clean and tidy. Steeply up from the Lean-to is Ethel Pond followed by another climb to Eddy Pond.
