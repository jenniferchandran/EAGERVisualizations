If you've been friends with me in real life or on social media for a while or if you're a random bystander who has gotten trapped into a 45 minute long conversation about brands of water filters, you'll already know that I'm planning a thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail starting in May of 2019. I didn't choose the thru-life, the thru-life chose me. 
Why hike the Appalachian Trail? Well, for starters, it's there and I've been feeling called to it since I was a kid and my family hiked the approach trail to Springer Mountain. My uncle was a Boy Scout leader and always talked about hiking it when he'd go on backpacking trips with his troop. He was killed in a car accident before he could see his dream through, so I also want to hike it for him. Also, my friends have traveled abroad and have had these great adventures while I went to work, completed my doctorate, and went to more work. As a military family, we've traveled, but it's never been a great adventure like some people talk about. It's always, like, ""Congratulations, you're going to Fort Jackson"" haha. I've never really wanted to travel that far in a plane for a great adventure when there are so many amazing places in America to explore, but for some reason, taking 6 months to walk 2200 miles through 14 states sounds like a solid plan to me, as far as adventures go. 
My bff, Kit, will be along for the journey and our long-suffering husbands will be our trail bosses, sending us mail drops and helping us with flip flop logistics. Thus far, we have all of our gear and are currently figuring out food choices, clothing combinations, and the like. I'm not a gear-head and am definitely not ultralight. My gear includes my trusty Big Agnes Fly Creek tent, Osprey Aura (65 L), my bear can, Jerry the Garcia, and an accordion foam pad that keeps my back in place while I sleep. Everyone seems to worry about weight, but I would like to err on the side of comfort, at least at first, and will probably shed some pounds once I better embrace my inner drifter and stop being able to smell myself. 
My gear is trusty and fairly well tested and if it wasn't for teaching for the next 3 months, I'd be on my way today. But, I really like my job and want to come back to it next spring. That's the beauty of being an adjunct this year, being able to say deuces for a semester with the intent to come back and hit the ground running. I'm glad part-time teaching was an option. 
For physical conditioning, I've been doing local hikes with my full pack, which has involved a lot of snowshoeing since I live in Northern NY. It's been great as additional resistance training and post-holing the rest of the time has helped me with stability and using my poles efficiently. I also do lots of squats, burpees, lunges, and pushups and have been conditioning to get back into the season for roller derby, although I will only be reffing a few home games this year for my league and not planning to travel to any Ontario games. This is a total bummer, as roller derby is my first love and the greatest sport of all time, but I am planning to pick it back up next season and officiate every game and practice that I can. I still have three months, but once I hit the two month mark, I'm going to ramp up training, hoping to do a multi-day hike over spring break and even to knock out a section of the trail in New Jersey and New York to keep ahead of the NOBO bubble this summer.  They'll definitely be outpacing us after walking 1000 miles, so we'll have to put a hitch in our giddyup a little in that case. 
If you haven't guessed by a May start, we'll be flip-flopping, northbound (nobo) from the ATC HQ in Harper's Ferry to Mt. Katahdin in Maine and then heading back through to Harper's Ferry sometime in September to do it all over again, just southbound instead. My current obsession has been making itineraries, which, as we know will really be dictated by weather, how well our knees hold up, illness, how long we can go without showers, and the resupply situation. Kit will be popping on and off trail to check on her farm business, and she's planning to fill in her miles in section hikes over the next few years to also become a 2,000 miler. This is also my goal, but my time on trail will be dictated by a summer off and a semester leave of absence, so I have about 7 months if I really want to stretch things out, 5 if I want to push it, and 6 if I want to have a good time, which I do or why else would I spend my savings for the sake of developing weird rashes?
So anyhow, I hope you'll follow Kit and I on our adventure.  I won't be talking at you so much in future posts when we get on trail and the outside world becomes a blur, but for now, I hope those of you prepping for a thru-hike the best. See you on trail!

Ten-Four ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610795,"Today, I began my thru-hike, starting at Mosey's Place in New Jersey. We dropped my car at High Point and she shuttled me to Sunrise Mountain. I don't often hike alone, but my hiking partner who I was going to start with had a family emergency and I decided to go anyhow. Sorry Mom. It was misty and cold and I only saw one other section hiker and four day hikers, all heading SoBo. I also saw two turkeys, two deer, and a noisy crow who followed me for a while to yell. I stopped at Mashpiacong Shelter a few miles in for lunch, signed the shelter registry, and crossed the road to climb up to a ridge. 
One thing I hadn't considered was how rocky that section of New Jersey is. The rocks completely cover the trail like little spikes. Jersey: Where even the rocks try to shank you.Every time I'd vow not to roll my ankle again, the trail had other ideas. I finally reached the turn off the the parking lot, but continued to follow the white blaze to High Point State Park Office where I would continue NoBo the following day. At the trail head, I met a couple named The Carpenters who told me about their RV tour and that they were so excited to meet an AT hiker. They asked if they could give me a trail blessing, which I was grateful for. So, there I was, praying with random strangers in the woods on Day 1. On the way back to Mosey's Place, I got some ice cream at Friendly's to celebrate, since it was where my grandma would always take me when I accomplished something big. I didn't get eaten by bears or stolen by the bad mens. On the contrary, I truly enjoyed hiking alone at my own pace. Day 1 was a success!","Sunrise Mountain
",High Point State Park,"Apr 11, Thu",8.90
Ten-Four ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610965,"Day 2 was quite the slog distancewise, but we made it and in good spirits! Met up with Haiku and by the time we left a car at 17a and shuttled back to High Point (my GPS took me the short way, which was a wild ride full of turns and potholes that made Haiku terribly carsick...she held it together. I would have ralphed), we got a chilly start at about a 10:30am from the state park office. I definitely packed too heavy and wore too many layers. We were both ripping off layers about 20 minutes in, after which, I never again took out my rain pants or fleece jacket. Note to self: lighten the load! I started thinking, do I really need this fleece? I have a puffy. Did I really need to bring rain pants and leggings and a base layer to sleep in? What a noob. I started rueing all my extra crap after about 10 miles and fantasizing about finding a post office along the trail where I could send all my extra stuff back haha. Experiential learning, folks. Girl Scouts are always prepared, but this shakedown hike was teaching me all the things in double time. 
Elevation was fairly consistent and a lot of the trail was boardwalk through swamps and bottomland areas of pastures, some road walking, and also a beautiful loop around the Walkill Nature Reserve where we saw ducks, geese, herons, and swans. It reminded me of Bryant's poem ""The The Waterfowl."" How many people get to walk through a marsh at dusk? We felt incredibly blessed for the opportunity. 
The rain held off and we made it to the base of Pochuck mountain at about 6pm to grab water from the abandoned ATC house. The only problem was that the house's faucet was winterized. Should have checked Guthook's...my bad. So, rather than attempt to dry camp, Haiku, being the hero that she is, elected to head back down to the road (about 1/4 mile) to a slow moving stream area we had just crossed. That's when we discovered that when you're really thirsty, you can trick yourself into drinking ""bogua,"" which is what we called the funky brown bog water that hangs out under boardwalks. It's not bad when you're thirsty,  it's double filtered and you add some added electrolyte powder. While my friends in the South were busy being obsessed with the Master's, we were drinking Bogua Arnold Palmers on trail. 
We got to the shelter with nobody around and I decided that was a good time to take a trail shower on the far side of the shelter. No sooner had I changed into sleep clothes, than one by one a troop of Boy Scouts filed in to camp for the night. Never assume you'll be sleeping alone at camp! With no tree cover yet, there was little place to hide from others. I inadvertantly mooned a scout leader while peeing in the early morning. Someone was in the privy and I thought I could go on the far side of the shelter, but forgot that the bear box was in plain view and that early risers would be picking up their food bags. Whoops! 
Besides the Scouts and their leaders, who had hiked in 2 miles and were planning to hike out to the road crossing just before the Stairway to Heaven the next day, our camp mates included two guys and their adorable dog, Luna, who stayed in the shelter with us. Luna became our trail mascot and we would meet up with her several times over the next two days, to the point where we'd look forward to seeing her again, but convince ourselves that the boys who were slackpacking would never be as slow as we were with full packs, and thus, we managed dog expectations. Then, just as we thought she was gone for good, they'd be resting on a ridge up ahead and our spirits would instantly rise. Luna! Thus, the term ""Dog Blazing,"" was born. Yeah, it's great to catch up to people, but it's magical to catch up to a sweet bubba dog after a hard day of hiking. This was my first night sleeping in a shelter (I have always tented), so I wasn't sure what to expect, but falling asleep with the drum of rain on the roof and the rhythmic snoring of fellow hikers was comforting and I slept like a rock. Something might have crawled across the foot of my bag at one point, but I was too tired to care and racked out. 
Day 2 was a success!","High Point State Park
",Pochuck Mountain Shelter,"Apr 12, Fri",14.10
Ten-Four ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610975,"On Day 3, we waited out the rain at Pochuck Mountain Shelter, which was supposed to end around 8am (on the dot!) and climbed the rest of Pochuck Mountain after breakfast. All morning, we hiked through pastures and through marshy boardwalk areas. There were beautiful sweeping views of the rolling hills and farmland. We ended up on this boardwalk over a beautiful marshy area full of red wing blackbirds and turtles. It was hiker heaven. The sun came out and we found a bench area to womanspread our gear and lounge around stinking up the place with our shoes off and eating lunch. All of these city looking ladies in their matching Lululemon outfits with their phones and lattes kept walking by and the looks they gave us were hilarious. Most tried to ignore the hiker trash they saw displayed before them. A few of them were really encouraging with ""you go girl"" type comments, but most conversations they picked up as they walked past went something like ""Oh, I could never do that. It looks so hard."" Well, it is, but ditch the rose gold and get out here, sister! haha I thought their perfume was going to knock us out. After we crossed this bridge that looked like The Twins river crossing from Game of Thrones, we once again met up with Luna the dog and her people and walked a single track boardwalk across farmland out to a road where we were tempted into the town vortex by a well placed sign advertising water and ice cream for hikers. Um, yes! So, we ended up having second lunch at Heaven Hill Farm and Garden Center, where Haiku and I traded our ""bogua"" (see previous post) for legit town water from the spigot out front and we bought stroopwaffles, ice cream, cookies, and I got an actual Arnold Palmer, which tasted like sweet victory (and which I'd immediately regret upon starting up the hot, sunny path to the Stairway to Heaven full of sugar water, caffeine, and curdling milk products). But, did you die though?The Stairway to Heaven was definitely an experience I'll remember. The rock steps weren't as much of a challenge as the constantly having to stop for day hiker and tourist traffic. Several more ladies expressed their admiration for our ability to carry such heavy packs. However, by the time we got up to the top, I was still regretting my too heavy pack and also the ice cream by this point. It just goes to show that just because you come to town, it doesn't mean you need to go hog wild on town food. The egregious consumption of ice cream was me being both tired and extra. A well timed Arnold Palmer and cookie alone will suffice from now on. Lesson learned. We found rocks to sit on at the top. Haiku put her legs up to try to reduce her swollen knee and I tried to trekking pole role out my calves...a multiple use item! As the sun started setting, we walked up a logging road past a wetland area with thousands of spring peeper frogs. The sound was deafening! It was beautiful and when we finally got to the shelter, again, later than we had originally envisioned, we had enough daylight to eat, talk with our sheltermates (once again, the boys, Luna the dog, and a thru-hiker from Germany who decided to tent), and though I was tired physically, my mind was wide awake, so I took notes for a bit until the mosquitoes got too bad in my head lamp light, and I burrowed into my bag for the night. Day 3: Success!","Pochuck Mountain Shelter
",WaWayanda Hilton ,"Apr 13, Sat",11.50
Ten-Four ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610983,"Day 4 was by far the hardest. We were sore from the 14.1 day and then all of the climbing the day before, so today, was when I officially hit ""The Blerch"" (the rotund winged entity from The Oatmeal who taunts Matthew Inman while he's attempting to run. Side note: Yukon first introduced me to The Blerch on our accidental 17ish mile day on the Foothills Trail when we discovered that anything over 14 miles were blerch miles of us just becoming zombies and forgetting we were walking). Had we have continued ahead in NY and not had to return to school, tomorrow would definitely been a nero day. So, why was it the hardest day yet? 
The. Rocks. No...the boulders. Y'all, anyone who tells you the rocks end in PA is a big ol liar. It was like giant had played marbles and decided to leave them out on top of the mountain for us to attempt to climb over, winning the ""not my job"" award on clean up. I had always heard that if you couldn't find the next blaze, look up, but I wasn't aware that scaling rock walls was even something I could do. Turns out, I can and it was actually a lot of fun once we got to the top and realized how much work we had done and we laughed nervously having not fallen to our deaths. 
Haiku, being the badass that she is, decided to lead the way and model a good route up each of the climbs. The key, I found, is don't think about it and just talk to the mountain. It appreciates the company. So, I was thanking rocks for helping me literally get a grip while I was talking to my limbs in some weird game of Twister. ""Arm, you grab here. This leg here. Thank you rock. Up we go..."" You know how Nik Wallenda prays and talks to himself the whole time he's walking over The Grand Canyon or wherever? Yeah, that was me with Haiku calling down ""huh?"" every once in a while until she realized I was talking my body into moving and the mountain into letting me live. The only semi-dicey point came after the wet rebar rung ladder when we got to a boulder that was at least 8 feet tall with a white blaze smack dab on the front of it and seemingly no hand or foot holds. This moment was why people form tramilies. Haiku found a foothold on the far side and scrambled up, I hoisted her pack and my pack and scrambled up. Our teamwork was amazing and I look forward to shakedown part 2 in a few weeks to complete Jersey. 
After having relatively little pain (soreness, but not pain) the entire trip, the last half mile, my ankle started bothering me with sharp stabbing pain right where my foot met up with it and Haiku's knee was giving her trouble. The last few miles were definitely blerch miles. 
Aleve wasn't doing its job anymore. We got to the car and rode with the windows down back to High Point to pick up my car. You can't really smell how much of a mastodon you have turned into while you're on trail, but trap that funk in a Honda and dang, son. I had a four hour drive back to NY that night and the smell kept me awake. I'm pretty sure Haiku is going to need to have her car detailed. I sprayed down my seat when I got home and still felt like I was driving a rolling sheep farm to work the next day. A notice to new shuttle drivers: I hope you have leather seats you can hose off from time to time. Otherwise, you're going to be driving the swamp ass express come mid summer. 
Shakedown Foot Notes..Ha, yes, Sith, foot-notes (not endorsing or reviewing anything): 
1. It doesn't matter so much the elevation gain/loss as much as the terrain. We thought 10.1 would be easier than 14.1 (well, Haiku knew the area better but I think she didn't want to scare me). AWOL's guide doesn't tell half the story. ""Ladder"" does not accurately describe the situation. If I made an AT guide book, it would be more like ""Rebar rungs placed haphazardly, probably wet, definitely not close enough to the top. Good luck morons!"" or ""Double filter this source or don't make any plans for 2-4 business days."" Perhaps fewer people would get in over their heads if they knew what was really up? 
2. Immediately upon coming home, I cut out 4.5 pounds of gear. Jerry Garcia (my bear can has been my Wilson, but I'll see him again on shorter hikes and car camps) has been shelved. I switched to a Lite AF bear bag kit and while I'm currently trying to figure out how to hang a bear bag, I'm hoping to be a pro by the time I get through PA. I also decided on bringing fleece hoodie over puffy due to washability and likelihood of funk trapping. Also, my puffy was like 200 dollars and I'm reluctant to bring fancy things on trail only to kill them with being damp and gross for months on end. I will switch back to my puffy probably before the Whites, ditch it through the Shenandoahs, and probably pick it up again around Mt. Rogers for the Smokies in the fall, but for the summer, I'm thinking an old 25 dollar fleece will do the job. 
I also decided against bringing so much first aid stuff, a pack towel (wash cloth is fine, bandannas are amazing), bringing my rain skirt instead of pants for summer, one pair of base layer leggings, ditching cold gear for the summer, and switching out from 15 degree to 35 degree bag with liner (I was way hot). Underwear and the one tee and one pair of shorts was right on, but definitely don't need 4 pairs of socks or a super thick pair of socks in the summer. Ankle length will work well, shorts and a tee for sleeping plus fleece hoodie if I really need it. I never used my knee brace or  peri squirt bottle, but might keep it around for poopmergencies, and honestly wish I could ditch my Garmin because Guthooks and AWOL's guide were sufficient. Guthooks was the better of the two for on trail, AWOL's seems to work better for pre-planning sections. Items such as my compass, backup lighter, whistle, neck knife, and gloves are one of those you don't need them until you do, things. I'm opting to keep them for now.
3. Absolute Gearoes on my trip were: X-mug (and all the coffee I could put in it), dry wipes (with a bit of water and Dr. Bronner's it's an instant trail shower. I would finish it up with some Anti-monkey butt powder and feel much fresher (though Haiku would probably beg to differ). I didn't bring any deodorant and felt like the slight botanical smell of the Picardin spray was an excellent trail cologne. Ok, just kidding. I about gagged myself while changing for the ride home. But honestly, four days of sweating into the same clothes...nothing is going to help that but a shower and some Tide. Having my clothing Insect-Shielded did seem to help, as others found ticks on themselves and I didn't find a one (or I am really bad at telling ticks from freckles). My pocket rocket and mug were key players as usual and I really liked being able to flip down my accordion pad and rack out. 
I used the piece of Tyvek I usually keep for my tent vestibule porch and put it under my sleeping pad, keeping it super clean. I am planning to move my pad from the bottom pack straps to my 50 L bag under the brain if I downsize. I tore up my pad quite a bit sliding butt first down rocks and would like it to last the whole trip if possible. Didn't get to use my tent, but no complaints from last year. My pack cover tore in two places from rock abuse, but tenacious tape is an amazing item. Pretty sure my pack cover will be made out of 95% tenacious tape by the end of the trip. My Altra Lone Peaks got beaten up, but hoping for at least 400 more miles on the treads. With taller socks, I cut out the gaiters and my ball cap helped keep the sun out of my face, the bugs out of my hair, and my rain jacket hood on my head. That was a win. 
4. I'm working on getting better at layering and not wanting to bring everything I might need for 6 months, thinking about the trip in 3-4 day increments. It's hard, but lugging over 30 pounds for 40 something miles straightened me out right quick. 
5. Glad I brought the Aquatabs to double filter my water. Two side pouch bottles and a Hydrapak with a Be Free filter worked better than my previous Sawyer Squeeze and 2 water bottles setup. I have no idea why I didn't realize previously that the side pouches on my pack had sideways holes for easier water bottle access, but Haiku's ""why don't you put your bottles in there?"" was hike changing. 
6. Food was spot on. I had a few electrolyte powders, an instant coffee, and two oatmeal packets left. The first thing to go was the M and Ms. The thing I reluctantly ate was the final protein bar. One can only have so many cookie dough flavored protein bars before questioning your life choices. 
Final shakedown note to self: Trail-me is not Town-me. Town me could eat mac and cheese and tuna packets every day because town me has a soft bed and fluffy dogs and Parks and Rec reruns. Trail life consists of being tired and sore, being too hot, too cold, wet, cold and wet, having to pee while being cold and wet, questioning whether or not your pooping will be on someone's vlog post, and your lungs and calves exploding while inhaling bugs for 15 hours a day. It is not the time to make bland food decisions. Also, just because you can eat a double quarter pounder with cheese and two pieces of gas station pizza for dinner, doesn't mean you're making a wise choice there, kid.","WaWayanda Hilton

Ten-Four ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611227,"It's beautiful outside, I want to be on the trail, and I have to grade papers. It's comforting to know that in a few weeks, I'll be attempting to complete New Jersey (well, MOC to Sunrise Mountain) and a week after that, I'll be on trail for the real deal. Currently, I'm nursing a sprained ankle which I did not sustain on trail. My dog Bettie, The Mommyslayer, took me out going down the back steps the day I came home from my last section hike. Thankfully, I don't think I tore anything and my chiropractor was able to do some ultrasound and help reduce swelling. I've been walking gingerly and staying off of it mostly. I even switched from reffing to being a non-skating official at this past weekend's roller derby bout because I didn't want to chance injuring it further. 
I'm just feeling kind of in limbo. I asked my husband if this is how people feel to some extent pre-deployment, where I want to get there before the momentum dies and all of the last minute things I am running around doing seem to be eating away at my patience. However, being both off skates and out of trail runners for the past week has allowed me to do a lot of things I hadn't done yet. I practiced setting up my tent in a sideways rainstorm, a wind storm, and as a fast pitch setup. I found stays on it I didn't know existed and took the time to read Big Agnes' actual tutorial on setting it up the correct way. I discovered there's a right and wrong side to the ground sheet. Who knew? I also practiced hanging my new bear bag, which I am currently still terrible at. I cut 5 pounds out of my pack including Jerry Garcia, switched to my summer weight bag, and got rid of my rain pants and am going with a fleece hoodie instead of a puffy jacket (mostly because the hoodie was 25 dollars and the jacket was 200. I don't want it to sit molding in my bag all summer and ruin it before I get to use it). I booked a room for me and Kit for our 4th day resupply and got my food and maildrops together for the first few weeks. I also wrote a lot and got a lot of grading done. So, it was a productive week. I just want to get out there! Going to start walking on the flat with K-tape for support this week to see how it goes. I need to get back out there!",,View Entry,"Apr 23, Tue",0
Ten-Four ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611733,"So, I talked a little bit about cutting weight in my pack last post. I'm down to about 20 pounds baseweight without buying anything new. In the past few days, I've gotten mail drops ready and reevaluated how many times I originally wanted to stop in town on my first leg. While 4 days is about my limit for going without a shower currently and 5 is about my limit on food carrying, I do plan to embrace the stink a bit more and bought more packs of Grunt Wipes, which were awesome for trail showers last time. I also plan to sleep in my tent more as it gets warmer, which is going to provide me with more privacy for trail showering and airing out. The funk intensifies in the heat. Also, I've been reading the Guthook comments about mosquitoes and am a little concerned about getting eaten alive if not properly screened in. Otherwise, I'll be the weirdo sleeping in their bug net, but better to wake up with Winona Ryder hair than be actual Beetlejuice as I get mauled to death by a swarm of the state bird. 
The Mommyslayer and our older dog have been enjoying lots of nap time when I normally take them on a big loop around the back pastures a few times a day or on the 7 mile trail nearby. Thursday, I attempted to do three loops around the shorter park paths with a friend from work and my ankle held up well, but was painful the next day at work. My chiropractor is going to do an all over assessment before I leave for the big hike and I'm hoping to get better news about my healed ankle by that point. Staying still is driving me nuts, though. I did work on hanging a bear bag, which I was going to do in the park on my test walk the other day until we realized that any decent trees were directly below parallel parked cars and there was just too much liability. 
Pretty soon, I'm heading back out to Jersey for an overnight with Haiku that will knock out all but the southernmost 12 miles of the state for me and will help her complete it. I'll finish up those 12 miles though, this summer and plan to complete MD, PA, and stop at the Mohican Outdoor Center overnight to shower, resupply, and wait for a shuttle back to 17a to pick back up with the New York section where our previous hike ended. I am slightly concerned that I'll find some awesome people to hike with on the trail and bond with them through PA just in time to bump myself a week ahead, but there's also a chance of NoBos hiking way more miles per day than I will be able and they'll eventually catch up further up in New England, especially for my 3 zero wedding weekend in Boston. I did some math and if I hike 10 miles/day on average, I will be somewhere in Massachusetts by the time of my cousin's wedding which I am super excited about. 
So, at this point, I'm just making a variety of gallon freezer size food bags per day and labeling them for mail drops which is how I plan to resupply (besides snacks and fresh food packouts) on the first leg of this trip along with some additional toiletries and first aid items. I'm trying to make this as easy on Claymore as possible, but there is like an 85% chance I'll get it all wrong my first few maildrops and I'll end up with way too much or too little food, time it wrong, etc. I'm going to try to send mail drops to hostels instead of post offices, especially places that have a weird schedule like DWG. 
I have begun ankle strengthening exercises, am back to squats and yoga, light walking, and a bit of exercise bike. I'm also banned by my doctor from roller skating until I'm done. He really wants me to be successful since I've like quit my job for the fall and stuff and unfortunately, he's right that I need to avoid injury. The Jersey rocks will be shanking my feet again in a few weeks. Post-hike,though, I will reemerge from the forest and get back on skates once again as Northern New York and Southern Ontario's most mediocre roller derby referee. Also, I haven't forgotten. Madge, I still owe you $5 CAD for that league patch. KRD will be on my pack in spirit.",,View Entry,"Apr 28, Sun",0
Ten-Four ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612621,"Since I've been home and preparing for my final shakedown hike, I decided to see how light I could go since we're only doing two days this time. 26 pounds! What did I cut out? 
I replaced Ultra Sil stuff sacks with Lite AF drawcord sacks
Bear can was replaced with bear bag. It really is LiteAF, but I added a Loksak for food and one for toiletries. Haiku says our shelter will have a bear box, but we might stealth camp to even out the days since 14 miles is at the high end of our one day range currently and our shuttle driver isn't bringing us back until later in the afternoon on day 2. 
I ditched winter weather gear (except puffy) -keeping a buff and currently gloves, but ditched rain mitts, rain pants, hat, under armour leggings, and balaclava -Going with one pair of Darn Tough OTC socks and one pair of Smartwool crew socks and rain skirt. Oh, and you know, like shorts and stuff. It's not June 21st. 
I went with my Nike fleece hoodie over a bulkier Columbia option. I like my Mountain Hardware fleece better, but it can't go in the dryer and has been 86'd due to logistics. 
Switched composition journal for tiny notebook since most notes will be on my phone
Went to summer weight sleeping bag (Kelty Trail Logic..not the warmest option, but the footbox zips open it mostly zips flat, got my liner back from Insect Shield, so that's a good addition)
Cut out a lot of extra first aid stuff and duplicates on toiletries..apparently the fears I pack involve a lot of home remedies, medications, and other hoodoo involving healing clay and pine tar salve. 
One thing I'm currently having an issue with is prepping food for mail drops. While I needed to keep a handle on my diet for excessive cathole digging reasons and know my body rejects Mountain House and gas station food, does anyone know what they're going to want to eat when it's been raining all day, their shins are killing them, they're shaky and hot, and the shelter is under mosquito attack 2 months down the line? 
Another development is that I'm seriously considering going stoveless on this next little two day, bringing some PB squeeze packets, dried fruit, uncured pepperoni and cheese, and flax tortillas and some bars for breakfast, tuna and cheese for lunch, and all of the green tea. It will be a good experiment for June and July in the Mid Atlantic and New England. I just don't think I can handle meatball marinara after a 14 miles in the sun. Change my mind, hiker hunger. 
Things left to do: 
Final shakedown hike, which will complete Jersey minus a few miles that I will need for being shuttled to NY 
Grade all the papers -finalize grades, put away work things until winter...so exciting except the no more paychecks part haha
Put together food/toiletry mail drops through Maine including cold weather gear for p/u in NH....I can prep for after the flip a bit, but leaving all boxes open for additions and subtractions. 
Get final assessment from my chiropractor who is interested in a before/after hike comparison 
Eat Home Deli pizza at least once more...this feels oddly like a deployment 
Pack my bags for Mimi's wedding, and the big bin labeled ""take to Maine"" ...I didn't realize how incredibly nerve wracking it would be to label things for a non-backpacker with limited free time to help me resupply who may or may not be at home for a month of my trip. I am not quite good at this organizing and shipping logistics thing, which is probably why I'm putting it off. I get too caffeinated and too into Fallout Boy and forget what I was doing. 
Hug my dogs fortyleven times, even the Mommyslayer. I will definitely be dog blazing on trail to get my fix of sweet puppers. 
Figure out if my HBO Go works. I will be watching the final episode of the final season on my phone from a hostel's questionable wi-fi, but it's better than not seeing it at all. Tyrion had better live. Maybe someone will rig up a projector on a piece of tyvek. 
Ok Jersey, time to finish your miles! Excited to see Haiku and prove to her that I don't always smell so bad, Ten-Four 

ps- I will post an update on the pack squeak after this next trip. I may have killed it by adjusting the frame to the smallest setting, which sits a lot better over my hips as well. That or I will have thrown it off a cliff. I really don't want to have to mail it back to Osprey just to get another squeaky pack.",,View Entry,"May 06, Mon",0

Since there are so few people staying this week with the rain, I got my own room next to Largo, a section hiker. I met up with Haiku in the morning after finding out the awful news in Virginia. It weighed on us all day and periods of quiet would be punctuated by speculation. The trail is a really safe place and when the trust and peace of the community is violated, it hurts all of us. 
As details started coming in and my phone started blowing up, we hiked to Catfish Fire Tower for lunch and walked past beaver dams and boggy areas, up and over Rattlesnake Mountain (didn’t see any snakes). 
We filtered water from a spring out of the rocks and then hiked to Brink Road Shelter, getting in with just enough time to pitch our tents, eat, and wade through the mud to the bear box. We slept well with a full campsite as it drizzled rain off and on, but couldn’t stop wondering how hiker friends were doing in Virginia while we still felt safe in New Jersey. Beautiful views, but a very sad and quiet day on trail.

The temperature dropped 15 degrees from the previous day and it was not the most ideal way to start the morning. 
Today we had to keep moving to keep warm enough to keep moving. Neither of us had an appropriate mid layer and early on, we were soaked and shivering. We made it to Culver’s Gap and nothing that was supposed to be open was. Gyp’s tavern was closed and we tried to thaw out on the floor of a bait and tackle shop. 
Around lunch time, we got into our sleeping bags at Gren Anderson Shelter trying to make tea to keep warm. Haiku was shivering and I’m pretty sure we were both borderline hypothermic, but had to keep moving to meet our shuttle. 
We got to Sunrise Mountain after a difficult climb and hunkered under a piece of Tyvek that I use for a front porch. The wind and rain pelted is and visibility was pretty low.

While I’m counting the NJ miles just the same, this was the start of a much longer journey. We stayed at the Quality Inn in Harper’s Ferry on Saturday night and had a last minute pack shakedown with a big bag to give back to my husband. Surprisingly, it was pretty empty and I ended up bringing everything from my final gear list. Unfortunately, I discovered too late that my pack is actually a size too large for my back and I would spend the next two weeks pulling at my straps constantly. 
We got breakfast at Rations cafe in the Bolivar section of Harper's Ferry and headed down to the ATC headquarters to pick up my thru hiker tag and get our pictures taken. That took longer than expected, but we finally said goodbye to Claymore and headed out around 10:30 am. 
Kit and I have an inside joke that comes from Aquateen Hunger Force and is from the episode where Meatwad gets lost and thinks he goes to the Super Bowl, but really he goes to a farm to pet chickens. We should have stayed on High Street and kept going straight down the road, but instead, we ended up at the college behind the ATC and wandered through residential streets for a while until we turned ourselves back around, found High Street, and headed across the bridge toward Weverton Cliffs. 
The hike up the cliffs was long but not particularly challenging besides it being so hot and humid (89) that day. People who smelled too good to be hiking kept telling us how awful the descent was and we kept fretting about when we would start this awful climb, but it never happened. Kit decided that all of her work on the “chair master” over the winter months had paid off. We made it to Ed Garvey shelter, but still had to get water. This involved the steepest, most hork inducing descent and climb back up the mountain. The spring was almost half a mile down! Once we lugged our close to 4 liters of water back up the cliff, we got back to the shelter and the nicest girl rolled in. It was her first day too and we stayed in the bottom of the shelter while three guys stayed upstairs. We had a terrible thunderstorm with hail followed by a super close helicopter flyover and then a coyote started howling quite close to the shelter. Welcome to sleeping in the woods!

On our way down from White Rock Cliff, we walked through a sandy thicker area where we ran into a family, the Wests, who were backtracking looking for their missing water filter. We ended up meeting them again at Dahlgren Backpacker’s Campground where we got hot showers (and felt spoiled) and ordered pizza and salads that was delivered to the South Mountain Inn.

We hung out there the rest of the afternoon and went to the AT Museum with a 74 year old section hiker named Nae Nae. 
I didn’t expect the museum to be so emotionally moving, but all of the exhibits about the AT founders, Grandma Gatewood, and Earl Schaefer made me so grateful for all of these people who built up the AT community and created and preserved the trail, that I found myself running to the hiker box, where of course, I found a package of tissues that said “Believe in Yourself.” 
I stayed at the Ironmaster’s Hostel with Nae Nae and Cherrie, a hiker from Denmark. The shower was heavenly and we got a mansion tour from the caretaker who also writes horror fiction.

The Westcapades and I started out together, but the kids kept wanting to stop and look at frogs, so they told me to go on ahead. Today was my first day of hiking with my new Deuter 50 + 10 pack, which I found much more compact and easier to carry than my bulkier Osprey pack had been. Terrain was super flat, but all the rain from the previous day's storms meant a ton of mud to mash through and 50 jillion mosquitoes, which swarmed us like pterodactyls. I had on sun sleeves and ended up with dozens of welts in the area between where my sleeves ended and where my short sleeves began. I'm definitely looking into a PFG fishing shirt with long sleeves for any of the boggier New England sections. Pretty soon, I met up with Young Gun who had previously been hiking with Chaunce and Easy, but said their pace was too fast for him, so he was ready to slow it down a bit and find some other hiking buddies. I hiked with him until Carlisle, where he got off trail to rent a car and head home for a zero day.

To be honest, I've never been particularly thrilled about the idea of hiking past Cove Mtn. Shelter due to its history. I grew up in Ohio with hiker parents who were also in law enforcement and I was pretty familiar with the story of what happened there in the 90's. However, I started out before everyone else, with Bounce catching up a bit later and we hiked through the area, which was peaceful and full of beautiful wildflowers. It wasn't at all the dark, sketchy place I had imagined. We checked out a view to the North over a powerline and hiked down to Hawk Rock, where Earl Schaffer's memoir, Walking with Spring, begins. Instead of turning right and heading back up the ridge, we accidentally stated down a series of oddly placed stone steps, which I found to be painful on my joints and difficult to navigate. We got to the bottom of the trail and found a tent set up in the parking lot. One of the local ATC volunteers told us that we hadn't hiked the actual 2019 trail and needed to go back up the steps and turn left if we were going to complete all of the miles, as we had hiked the historic AT instead. Bounce replied ""We were walking in Earl Schaffer's footsteps, which is good enough for me."" It was super hot, we were out of water, and there was no way, we were retracing steps up the mountain at that point. A local trail angel called The Ambassador, brought us to his car, filled our water bottles for us, and got us back on the actual trail to Duncannon. We ate lunch sitting outside of a gas station and then trekked into town, stopping at Kind of Outdoorsy, running into Trail Angel Mary and her tan van, and ended up at the Doyle where I had the best tasting cherry cider I'd ever drank, probably because it was cold and I was sweaty and gross. I picked up my resupply package and chatted with Vicky for a while before we ordered giant cheeseburgers and the others (The Wests, Bones on her zero day, and Snacks and Late Start) rolled in. We had reservations for the Red Carpet Inn and should have stayed at the Assembly of God hostel instead. The shuttle picked us up and because they didn't want to lose out on a customer due to no vacancy, Bones and I ended up with this really shitty room in a building next door to the actual hotel. It smelled like stale smoke, had cinderblock walls, and was generally worse than the Scottish Inn by far. We probably would have been better off sleeping at the Doyle. Nae Nae and Yvette were also zeroing and had one of the nicer rooms along with Snacks and Late Start. It poured all night and Bones and I booked a shuttle back to Duncannon at 8am for a soggy start out of town. The parking lot was knee deep in water, so I had to wade back from the laundry room with my clothes in a plastic bag over my head. It was pretty comical and shelters are cleaner and better maintained than some of these trail town motels.

I came up with the following: 1. Carrying four liters of water for additional 5 miles to avoid 600 steps downand then back up from a spring located halfway down the mountain2.

We broke camp early and spent the morning mostly ridge walking with little roller coaster hills in between. We crossed a few rocky spots, but mostly the trail was just mulched wood and gravel for some easy footing. We wound down the ridge to a Clarks Creek where we ran into Michelle Thomas from the AT Women's Group and some awesome trail magic. She had iced coffees, cookies, and other snacks and we sat in the parking lot for a good two hours resting and talking with other hikers who trickled in, including Bones and Solar. Bounce's friends, Marc and Christine arrived and brought us sub sandwiches, feeding everyone including Michelle who got trail magic at her own trail magic.

It was his last night before finishing all the miles, as he had started his thru hike the previous year at the 501 shelter and was now only 20 miles from the end. So, we celebrated with him with extra cookies from trail magic. Two Amish boys on rumspringa were hammocking nearby and the Westcapades rolled in after dark, night hiking after spending a day with friends. According to Guthook's app, the campsite is haunted by the ghost of a local brave after his family was killed and he scalped the white explorers and was then killed in retribution...or something. The only evidence we saw of this was that there was an old abandoned well that we almost fell into while hanging bear bags behind the camp and that this rogue deer kept waltzing through camp trying to eat our food. Nobody said it, but we were all thinking that the deer was the ghost, so of course I left this as a public comment in Guthook. The whole night the deer stomped around our tents and the Amish boys said it kept snorting at them and nosing at their hammocks. At one point, we were convinced a bear was crashing around camp. Bounce went out to investigate, but again, only saw the zombie ghost deer apparently drinking someone's pee near the woodline and attempting to eat my wet t shirt off of the clothesline.","Peters Mountain Shelter

He asked if he could give us a blessing and we said yes of course! So, we all prayed together by the side of the road and he put his hands on Bounce's knee and my aching foot and we immediately felt like weight had been lifted off of us. We passed several of the possible campsites we had mapped out and ended up stealth camping just past I-81 up a steep incline that became known as the longest .1 in history. The first tentsite was full of dead trees, which made us reluctant to camp there.

There's always the dilemma of leave no trace vs. getting up to your calves in sticky mud, but we mostly trudged right through, figuring we'd dry out before camp. We passed by a marker that noted the spot of Fort Dietrich-Snyder, an outpost during the French and Indian War, and walked past Black Swatara campsite, which I think is the site of an old coal mining settlement. 
Today, the rocks were so bad, I had to stop and lambswool/leukotape the bottoms of my feet in several places. My shoes are wearing out quicker than anticipated and I'm hoping they hold together until the PA/NJ border where I have a new pair waiting for me at the Mohican Outdoor Center. I'm going back and forth between bruised toes, a sore right achilles, the start of blisters where I've never had them before, and plantar fasciitis in my left foot. All the Aleve! 
We camped at a stealth site with Firefly, Sharktooth, and Turd Ferguson, as well as with two city slicker looking older men who didn't know how to set up their giant tents and who were fiddling with their gear like they had never seen it before. I wanted to be kind and help them out, but one of them said something about the trail not being safe and being worried that there might be a crazy veteran with PTSD at the campsite. He asked if any of us had PTSD, which everyone pretty much answered yes and then asked if any of us were veterans and said ""Oh great, now I have to be worried that you'll kill me in my sleep."" Really? I was too tired to argue with him, but as a military spouse and advocate for Hike for Mental Health, I stewed on that all night. How ignorant can someone be? He should feel lucky and much safer that the campsite is full of veterans who would totally defend him if need be. I'm thinking of ways I'm going to address this in the morning. I really just want to pee on his tent, though.","501 Shelter

Ten-Four ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616587,"Today, we got going early. I didn't realize it, but Bounce had stewed on what the old guy had said all night, too. He was the first to address it, and did so respectfully, something to the tune of ""Sir, what you said about veterans being crazy and PTSD causing people to be violent, that's not true."" To which I added ""It's total bullshit and added a spiel for Hike for Mental Health. The guy tried to backtrack, saying he had just been making a joke (because PTSD is so funny, right?) and his dad was a Vietnam Veteran. Well, then he really should bleeping know better! Anyhow, we tried to shake off that encounter and left camp to a cool, sunny breezy morning. Halfway to town, we ran into Pink Socks and we hiked with her the rest of the way. She needed a place to stay and I was happy to share my room if it meant we could afford an extra zero day to rest. My achilles was screaming by the final hill down into Port Clinton. We passed several neat looking places to tent before realizing they were behind Private Property signs. The final hill into Port Clinton proved to be extremely treacherous and we all half slid down the mountain. At one point, I lost traction and spun around 360 degrees while trying to remain upright. I have no idea how anyone hikes it when it rains! I was close to the bottom when my right trekking pole finally gave out. I had been having problems with the level locks allowing it to fold up on me and despite tightening down the screws, it finally had had enough. The hello kitty duct tape poles bit the dust. We got down to the train tracks and walked across the bridge into town, stopping at the Port Clinton Hotel where we grabbed burgers and beer. Bones and Solar were there on the porch and we ran into Next Level and his hiking buddy, who we had met while resting at the top of one of the final climbs. He's a Christian author and we ended up talking with him about his books. Once we ate, we called for the free shuttle to Cabela's and ended up walking around there. I got new trekking poles, sampled fudge, and saw a ton of clothes that I would have bought had I a place to keep them that didn't require carrying them around. It made me wonder how much crap we buy simply because we have the means to haul it home. If we were carrying everything on our backs and walking places would our consumerism tune change significantly? Bounce and the others went back to the Pavillion in Port Clinton and Pink Socks and I walked over to Wal-mart where I looked for nasal spray or something to address my snot situation. For the past few weeks, I had been growing progressively snottier and was starting to develop a croupy cough. I assured Pink Socks it was only allergies and I do have a death allergy to mountain laurel which is pretty much everywhere along the trail, but I also wondered if I had a latent sinus infection which had started plaguing me around Harper's Ferry and I had done my best to ignore it for at least 200 miles. I got some alka seltzer cold, some packets of tissues, and a spray bottle of saline in an effort to neti-pot the gunk out of my face. We carried our resupply groceries to an All You Can Eat (AYCE) buffet and ended up being too tired to do more than fill up on pierogies, mac and cheese, and pork fried rice. We limped back to the hotel and started laundry and breaking down our resupply stuff into our daily food bags, ending the night with several cups of hot tea and an Impractical Jokers marathon. I have never been so content watching garbage tv with my feet up. Taking a zero tomorrow to heal Pink Socks' feet and my aching ankle. We are both exhausted.","Stealth Camp Site

Ten-Four ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616589,"Today, Bounce and Bones headed out, but Pink Socks and I took a zero and did absolutely nothing, the highlight of which was a giant Cracker Barrel to-go order in which I consumed the Leaning Tower of Carbs. We watched tv, iced our feet, went back to Cabela's since there was a shuttle and then walked to the Russell Stover outlet for hot fudge sundaes. 
It's nice to be able to eat whatever we want while still losing weight, but I started thinking that I really should be adding more protein and fresh food (somehow) to my on-trail regimen. I put off ordering Ligaplex supplements from my chiropractor, and my note to self is that I need to eat/supplement to support my tendons and ligaments, especially in light of whatever is going on with my achilles. Even with a day off, it's really starting to get angry. I'm wondering if my zero drop shoes aren't the culprit or if it's Rocksylvania trying to do me in. Tomorrow, we are heading out around 9 for more miles, so hoping that another night with my leg propped up does the trick. Can't wait to get new shoes where I sent them at the MOC!","Port Clinton

Ten-Four ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619078,"I’m finally getting around to finishing my PA journal entries. Sorry! 

Today, we got a late start from the Microtel and shuttled back to Port Clinton. Then we hiked up out of Port Clinton which was a bit of a haul, but it was sunny and cool with a pleasant breeze. The light through the trees was beautiful. 

I hiked with Pink Socks to Pulpit Rock and we sat out in the sun eating lunch like two bums while day hikers looked at us with side eye. After hiking to The Pinnacle (and sporting some
Rattlesnakes), we headed to a stealth site and Snacks and Late Start caught up with us. It took us forever to find a tree to hang our bear bags, as there wasn’t one nearby with a suitable branch that wasn’t super close to our tents. Our main concern was a nosy deer that kept traipsing through camp looking longingly at our food bags as we ate dinner. 
It started to rain as we went to bed. I was exhausted, but my cough was much worse today and I sat up coughing half of the night. Really should get checked out at urgent care if this doesn’t go away soon.","Port Clinton

Ten-Four ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619571,"After cold rain all night, we packed up wet tents while it was still raining and I coughed and sneezed my way up Hawk Mountain, somehow missing the text that Pink Socks who was a bit behind me decided to stay at Eckville Shelter instead of continuing on to Allentown Shelter. 

So, about 5 miles into my hike where I periodically stood under pine trees for a few minutes to get some relief from the pouring rain and my lungs were burning and I had nothing dry left to blow my nose into, I finally conceded what a poor decision I had made in going out in the rain while sick. The slick rocks were hard to maintain balance on and when I finally made it up to Dan’d pulpit I was exhausted and there wasn’t even a view to make up for the hard day. 
I arrived at the shelter around 4:30 and found a space thankfully where I proceeded to cough and sound horrible to everyone around me who were all trying to not breathe in whatever crud I had. Around 7pm, the Westcapades made it in, having hiked 2 miles south of their drop off point to bring me some much needed cough medicine for which I was incredibly grateful. Everything I own on trail got drenched today and I definitely need to seek out an urgent care for some antibiotics or something when I get to the next town, which is two more days out.","Campsite before Eckville Shelter
