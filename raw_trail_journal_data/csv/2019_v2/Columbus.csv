September 20, 2018 - flew from NY to Flagstaff, AZ.  There are a total of six of us in our group.  Me, Fran, Ian, Melissa, Bill and Ben.
September 21, 2018 - Out the hotel door at 4AM for a 4 hour drive to the trail head at the North Rim.  Stopped for breakfast along the way.  Weather was perfect.  Sunny, blue skies and probably in the mid-50's.  Arrived at the trail head around 10:30AM and started hiking around 11AM.  Down, down, down into the canyon.

Columbus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605638,"Hello
family, friends and trail journal readers!  Welcome and thank you for
coming to my trail journal.  I hope you enjoy it and I look forward to your
comments and questions to this and all my future journal entries.  The
topic of this journal entry is: How did I come to the decision to hike the
Appalachian Trail (AT).  Most of the time people will start by asking me
""why am I hiking the AT?”.  That's a reasonable question and I'm
looking forward to telling you the answer to that in a future journal
entry.  But I think the appropriate place to begin is with an explanation
of how I came to the decision to do an AT thru hike.
I first
heard about the AT in early 2016.  I made my decision to thru hike the AT
a full year later in 2017.  In 2016 I was nearing the end of my triathlon
and marathon days.  After ten straight years of training and racing I was
feeling burned out.  As much as I loved hanging out with my triathlon
friends and all of the fun and camaraderie we shared on race days, the thrill
and motivation were gone.  Around that same time, I learned about the John
Muir Trail (JMT).  That's when I decided to trade in my wet-suit and
bicycle for trail runners and a back pack.
The JMT
is a world famous 210-mile bucket list hike through the Sierra Nevada mountains
of California.  The JMT was going to be my entry into long distance
hiking.  I began my transition with lots of research about the JMT and by
doing hikes on the Finger Lakes Trail in NY and the Black Forest trail in
PA.  Unfortunately, I was unsuccessful in my attempt at securing a permit
for the JMT and had to look for an alternative hike.  This led me to a new
goal of section hiking the AT.  
A
""thru hike"" of the Appalachian Trail is a continuous hike covering
the full 2,200 miles of the AT and is usually completed over a period of five
to six months.  A ""section hike"" of the AT means completing the
2,200 miles one section at a time, over multiple years.  In both cases you
cover the same distance but they are two completely different
experiences.  It was late 2016 and I was planning to do a section hike of
the AT in 2017 which would not require any changes or sacrifices relative to my
family and work situations.  However, that all changed in early 2017 when
I first said to myself ""I'm going to do a thru hike of the AT."" 
That decision happened over time, slowly, little by little after each
conversation with past thru hikers and current section hikers, after each book
about thru hiking the AT, after each hike with Custer and Steady State, and
after watching my new favorite movie of all time, ""The Secret Life of
Walter Mitty"".  It was a progression for me that started with first hearing about the AT and the concept of a thru hike.  At that time a thru hike was as much a reality for me as Mars.  But that concept became a dream and the dream became an obtainable reality.  It was a watershed moment and I knew there wasn't anyway I could turn back.  I was going to attempt a thru hike of the AT!   It would be weeks before
I said it out loud to anyone.  It would
be months before my wife was fully on board (thank you honey for your unwavering support of my crazy dreams over the past 28 years!  You're the best!).  And it would be another twelve months before I would get approval for a leave of absence from my job. All told, when I step foot on the AT in
March, 2019 it will have been a full two years in the making.

Columbus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605831,"Hello family, friends and trail journal readers!  Welcome back to my trail journal.  This trail journal post focuses on planning and preparations.  I hope you enjoy it and I look forward to more of your comments and questions…
Planning for my AT thru hike:
Mike Tyson the famous boxer once said “Everybody’s got a plan until they get punched in the mouth.” Well, the Appalachian Trail is famous for punching thru hikers in the mouth and sending them home.  With that in mind here’s my plan, before the punch in the mouth:

 March 10th – Arrive at Harpers Ferry, WV.  March 11th – Begin my SoBo (southbound) hike to Springer Mountain in Georgia.  Hopefully I will be joined by my hiking buddy, Custer for the first week or so of my hike.  My hiking mileage plan is noted below.   10 to 12 miles per day for first couple of weeks.
12 to 15 miles per day for the next couple of weeks.
15 to 20 miles per day after week four.
Resupply in local towns every three to five days. No mail drops
 May 17th – Return to NY to attend my son Alex’s college graduation on May 19th.
May 24th – Return to AT and continue SoBo hike to Georgia.
Mid/Late June – Reach Springer Mountain in Georgia.  Late June – Return to Harpers Ferry and begin my NoBo hike to Mt. Katahdin in Maine.
Late September – Reach the summit of Mt. Katahdin.  I will likely weigh 30 pounds less and smell like a sweaty old shoe that served as the primary residence of a family of skunks with personal hygiene issues.

 Preparing for my AT thru hike:
No matter how much preparation thru hikers do, 75% of them will not make it to Mt. Katahdin.  They will quit.  Injuries, illnesses, mental and physical fatigue, financial problems, work and family commitments will pull all but a few thru hikers from the trail.  With that in mind here’s a peek at what I’ve done to prepare:

 Hikes & Workouts - the best preparation for a thru hike is hiking and more hiking.
 110 mile hike of the Shenandoah Valley section of the AT (9 days)
The Grand Canyon Rim to Rim hike (4 days) Black Forest Trail in Pennsylvania (3 days)
Numerous day hikes and several multi-day hikes on the Finger Lakes Trail
At least three gym workouts per week for the last year, focusing on legs and core strength.
 Research - Books, Podcasts and YouTube Videos  AWOL on The Appalachian TrailBecoming Odyssa
Appalachian Trials
Appalachian Trail: A Road More or Less Traveled
Where’s the Next Shelter
A Walk in the Woods
Darwin on the trail (one of many You Tube videographers)
Backpacker Radio (>30 podcast episodes)
Returning to Katahdin Met and talked with several thru hikers and section hikers.  Shout out to thru hiker Rob “the bearded wonder” McIntosh who tutored me about the AT from day one, and to section hiker Todd “where are my car keys” Johnson for trying to teach me the finer points of land navigation.   Gear – On average, thru hikers will spend twelve hours a day hiking, eight hours sleeping and four hours in camp.  So when making decision about your gear choices keep that in mind and prioritize your budget and gear weight vs. comfort appropriately.  The “big three” of hiking gear are your backpack, tent and sleeping bag.  Here are my big three:  Backpack - Osprey Exos 58.
Tent - ZPacks AltaPlex
Sleeping Bag/Pad - Enlightened Revelation Quilt/NeoAir XTherm
 
Trial and error and learning from other hikers have played a big part in my final gear selection.  The base weight of my pack with all my gear is 18 pounds.  My total pack weight including food, water and consumables will average 26 pounds.  

 Work & Family Preparations
 My employer, Corning Incorporated, granted me a six month leave of absence.   By providing >1 year’s advance notice we were able to work out the necessary transition plans.  I am very grateful for this support by Corning. My family and friends are a big part of this adventure.  By sharing my plans and excitement with my wife, kids and friends they are all engaged and are already providing me their support that is so critical.  There’s a large map hanging in our home that my family will use to track my progress and this trail journal will be another important way for me to receive support from my family and friends.  I’m already looking forward to them meeting me at different points along the way.
 Mental Preparations
 I wrote down my “why’s” for hiking the AT and will look at that list when I’m having a tough day.
I must hike my own hike. Staying on the trail will require perseverance, staying positive and relying on my problem solving skills to overcome unexpected adversity.  This point cannot be overstated.I will be grateful for the trail that I’m given rather than being pissed off for not getting the trail that I expected.

Columbus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605982,"Hello and welcome back.  Today's journal entry will answer that question which folks tend to ask me the most.  Why am I thru hiking the AT?
If you're looking for a simple straight forward answer then I am sorry, prepare to be disappointed.  There are many reasons and at the same time there is no good reason to subject oneself to the challenges of an AT thru hike. 
My own reasons for hiking the AT continue to evolve.  At this moment, I want the adventure. Who among us doesn't want a little adventure now and again? Most of the people I talk with share this same feeling. I want the physical and mental challenges, the unknowns and frankly the risks that come with that adventure.  I want to live a more simple, slower, quieter, thoughtful life immersed in the sounds, smells and sights of the Appalachian mountains.  I want the confidence, self reliance, peacefulness and the change in perspective that can come from this adventure.  I want my children to really believe that dreams become realities and that its not only ok, but sometimes life's greatest joys are found by taking that road less traveled. I want to live outside the norm and beyond the busy world for awhile.  I want to wash away the effects of thirty years of florescent lights, gray walls and power point presentations and regain the creativity and passion for my work. And because starting out is so much better than ending up.  Not sure that last one will make sense to everyone but some of you can probably relate.  Those are some of my reasons at this time.  Ask me again in six months though...


Here are some quotes picked up from past AT thru hikers:

1."" If we were being paid to do this we would have quit by now.""
2. ""We're prisoners, and the keys are right in our hands."" (i.e. we're out here voluntarily and nobody is making us do this.)
3. ""Hiking the AT is “pointless.” What life is not “pointless”? Is it not pointless to work paycheck to paycheck just to conform? Hiking the AT before joining the workforce was an opportunity not taken. Doing it in retirement would be sensible; doing it at this time in my life is abnormal, and therein lay the appeal. I want to make my life less ordinary."" David Miller, AWOL on the Appalachian Trail.

Passed through Pine Grove Furnace State Park.  Had a nice lunch at a picnic table there not too far from the lake.  The AT Museum was closed unfortunately.  We ran into a group of about 10 very nice young men and women from the Naval Academy a little north of Tom's Run Shelter.  Also ran into three other day hikers.  So nice to see folks out enjoying the trail on days like this. Ran into alot of blow down south of Pine Grove Furnace.  Had to crawl and climb over several large downed trees.  All part of the adventure.  Had a nice hot dinner by the campfire and hung our damp socks and smelly shirts and pants to dry.  Looks a bit hiker trashy but that's cool with us.  Todd and I are both feeling pretty good at this point with nothing more than the expected aches.  Tonight will be another cold night.  Tomorrow will be our longest day at 13 miles.  Weather is supposed to be very good again, might even get into the 50's.  By the way, the shelters thus far in southern PA have been great.  Missing all of you back home.","James Frye Shelter

This past Monday was a big day full of firsts for me.  I hiked 23 miles that day.  That's my first 20+ day.  Legs felt great, weather was good, terrain was good and I was motivated  I completed the first 100 miles of my 2,200 mile trek and I completed my first state, Maryland. 
Tuesday was a non-hiking day for me.  That's called a ""taking a zero"" in trail lingo.  A recovery day was in order.  As was a laundry day and a cheeseburger and beer day. I spent the day in a great little trail town and was extremely fortunate and blessed to pick a hostel to stay at that two other experienced  hikers were at.  It is impossible for me to capture in words all of the knowledge generously shared over the next day and a half by these two hikers who have competed the AT numerous times.  
I left this trail town and the vortex (I'll explain the vortex in a future posting) and have made my way from West Virginia and into Virginia. WV is the second completed state for me.  Two down, twelve more states to go.
Today it is cold and raining hard.  I have enough food and water and so I'm hunkering down in a shelter on the trail today watching the weather reports and catching up on journaling and planning.

Columbus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608804,"Hello family, friends and trail journal readers.  Rather than go on about the usual stuff (e.g. miles hiked, the weather, etc.) I thought you might enjoy a different kind of update.  
Here's a snapshot of my morning routine on the trail.  When I'm staying at a shelter, basically a three walled lean-to, my morning routine goes something like this. 
 1. I wake up around 6am. I stay hunkered down in my warm 20 degree sleeping bag until about 7am when its time to face the cold reality that awaits me. 
 2. After that punch in the stomach that is a 30 degree morning in a shelter in March, I fire up my stove for some oatmeal and coffee or hot cocoa.   Coffee or cocoa are required in order to get me awake and my internal workings in motion. 
 3. I quickly put on my hiking clothes.  I have separate sleeping clothes so that I don't ever have to sleep in wet, cold clothes. I then pack while drinking my coffee. Sleeping pad deflated, rolled and stuffed into the pack first. Then the sleeping bag, then my clothes bag, ditty bag, food bag. Snacks distributed into various pockets for quick and easy access. 
 4. Clean, dry and pack my cup, spoon and stove. 
 5. If nearby, I'll go to a stream or spring and filter enough water for the day's hike. Sometimes I do this the night before.
 6. I brush my teeth, take my daily prescribed medicine, and make a quick stop at the privy for some paperwork. 
 7. I'll do a quick re-review of my trail guide to understand the day's hike: distance, terrain/elevation, location of water sources, landmarks, etc.  If I have cell coverage I will also double check the weather forecast. 
 8. I put on my backpack, do a quick recon of the shelter to make sure I'm not leaving anything behind and then hit the trail, hopefully by 8:30am and with a smile on my face. 
P.S. I'd like to give a shout out to Pop Tart who I ran into on the trail yesterday.  Thanks for brightening my day and best wishes on your PCT hike.P.P.S.  Thank you Marsha and Anna for a wonderful dinner at The Blue Wing Frog (bluewingfrog.com) in Front Royal, VA.  Great company and great food for hungry hikers.","

Virginia accounts for more miles of the AT than any other state, 554 miles. Luckily, VA includes some of the most scenic parts of the AT including Shenandoah National Park (SNP), my current location.
The other hiker in the pic with me is SpamMan.  SpamMan is the first northbound (NoBo) hiker I've met on the trail and he's way ahead of the other NoBo pack.  He started his hike in Georgia on January 7th. He made it through some pretty rough conditions in the Smokey Mountains and will be at Mt. Katahdin in Maine sometime in June. Good luck with your hike SpamMan.","

Nothing much to report today. I'm still in Virginia and will continue to be for several more weeks. 
Today I passed the 200 mile point of my hike, in 19 days.  Slightly ahead of schedule by two days. You may notice that the mileage counter in my trail journal is stuck at 106 miles.  That's because I don't post daily journal entries any longer.  
The attached pic was taken of me earlier today with the help of a family I met on the trail.  The mom was not familiar with the concept of a 2,200 mile AT thru hike and asked if I was going to be in the Guniess Book of World Records.  We all laughed.  I told her that the only book that this hike was in was my wife's book of crazy ideas. 
Tonight the weather is supposed to be a bit warmer.  Low 40's.  Very happy about that.
Dinner tonight was instant mashed potatoes with some bacon like pieces. What I couldn't finish I used as mortar to patch the holes in the nearby shelter. 
I'm in my tent now as I type this and am hoping for a clear night sky full of stars.  And no critters big or small!
I'd like to give a special shout out tonight to my daughter Meghan.  I miss her.  She's at college and is struggling with the flu and trying to keep up with all the things that come with being at college this time of the year.  Rest up sweetie. Better times are coming.  Love you to the moon and back...","

Enoch is an amazing man and I'm sure his wife is just as special.- Orange-Blaze and his dad, Wagon-Hammer are northbound AT thru hikers from Minnesota.  Together this father and son duo made it through pretty tough winter conditons in the Smokies and are a really special team. So easy going and so generous. In these first 3+ weeks I've started to get a sense of the AT trail community and it's all been very positive.

I'm still hiking through Virginia and still ahead of schedule.  My body is holding up ok with only the normal, minor issues to deal with (e.g. blisters, sore feet, some sore muscles and joints). It's interesting, at least to me that while my body and especially my legs are getting stronger every day, my body is also more fragile at the same time. One mis-step on the trail, poor decision or distracted moment will have immediate and potentially severe consequences.  That means that most of my time while hiking is focussed on the next step and the trail immediately in front of me.I've been on trail now for a full month.   By tomorrow I will have completed 400 miles of the AT and lost 17 pounds. I'm continuously updating my food plan to increase my calories but the reality of thru hiking is that I burn about 5,000 calories a day and am only able to carry and eat about 3,000 calories per day. 
The weather has been very accommodating lately with only a few days of hiking in the rain.  I was caught in a thunder and lightening storm earlier this week while hiking down a mountain.   That was a new experience that will stick with me for awhile.  
As many of you know I started my AT hike in PA and am hiking south to GA at which point I will return to PA and hike north to ME.  This is referred to as a flip flop hike.  As I hike south now I am encountering northbound hikers from GA with increasing frequency.  In my first three weeks I met one northbound hiker.  In the last week I've met more than twenty northbound hikers.  And within the next four weeks I will begin to run into the larger mass of northbound hikers (aka the bubble) from Georgia. These encounters have been fun and the comraderie amoung thru hikers is  strong.  Those moments in camp at night sharing stories and the brief conversations during the day while on the trail are a large part of what makes this adventure memorable.  
I met and am now hiking with another southbounder.  His trail name is Porqupine and he's from Georgia.  We have a lot in common and it's nice to have the company especially on the tougher days.  Porqupine took the attached picture of me having fun on the trail a few days ago.  Thanks again to all of you who continue to post in the Guest Book and who send me words of encouragement.  They really mean alot and help to stay connected to all of you during this time.","

Columbus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610373,"Hello family, friends and trail journal junkies.  Today was a good day.  Porqupine and I were on the trail at 6:30am and wrapped up our fourth 20 mile day at 3:30pm before heading to an all you can eat restaurant and then to a local hostel which is where I am now.  
This particular hostel is a donation based hostel as opposed the usual $30/night cost.  This hostel is a three car garage that's been kind of converted.  It has 14 bunkbeds, a makeshift kitchen and bath, three  couches,  a couple refrigerators, wall to wall workbenches and about two tons of tools. It's a wonderful place to get some needed rest and the owner is friendly and gracious. 
Tomorrow we're taking a zero day to rest and recover before our next push to Pearisburg, VA.  The attached photo was taken today at a popular overlook in Virginia called McAfee Knob (Blake, this one's for you man.).  That's me doing the Karate Kid pose.  Good night.","

Columbus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610829,"Hello and welcome back trail journal readers.  Thank you for visiting.  For the non-hikers that are following my progress I thought it might be interesting to explain how I navigate and find my way along this 2,189 mile trail through 14 states.For me, there are three tools in my trail navigation tool kit.  First and foremost are the 165,000 white blazes that are painted on trees, rocks, fences, old posts, on the road and even on the back of road signs.  A white blaze, like the one in the attached photo is a 6x4 inch rectangle. The Appalachian Trail is mostly maintained by local hiking clubs along the 14 states that the trail passes through. Volunteers from those clubs paint the white blazes along with maintaining the trail in their respective sections. I liked the way this particular blaze stood out against the backdrop of the farmer's pasture and the blue sky.  Secondly, in addition to the white blazes, because sometimes I simply can't find a white blaze, I rely on a paper guide book called AWOL's AT Guide and an app on my phone called Gut Hooks. These are the most popular tools used by thru hikers and they're packed with detailed information about everything a hiker needs to know about each mile of the trail.  Lastly, I can rely on basic land navigation skills and my fellow hikers for direction whenever necessary.  As I write that last sentence I know that my old hiking buddies will be laughing.  I was given the trail name of ""Columbus"" because my lack of navigation skills has sometimes lead me to the wrong destination. With all of those tools at my disposal I'm usually feeling pretty good about knowing where I'm at and where I'm going.","

Columbus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611684,"Hello and welcome back family, friends and trail journal junkies. What shall we talk about today? Here are a few random updates and thoughts from the trail. I hope you enjoy them.
One of the common sayings on the trail is ""it's about the smiles not the miles."" I think about it more and more the longer I'm on the trail.  It reminds me to stop and take breaks during the day.  Take my shoes off and soak my feet in a stream.  Make it a short day, stop hiking and just lay down in a field, enjoy a sunset or a sunrise.  Strange as it may sound it's not easy, or maybe it's more accurate to say it doesn't come naturally to me after so many years of living according to schedules, plans, objectives, etc.  Those are not bad things.  They are necessary in my every day life. But they are incongruent with trail life and the idea of smiles not miles.  It's both fun and challenging to me to find a balance of smiles and miles.  The attached selfie photo was taken the other day.  The older gentleman is Jim.  Jim is 70 years young and he spends his spare time as a trail angel, shuttling smelly hikers to and from the trail and a nearby town.  For Jim and those hikers he helps it all about the smiles. Thanks again Jim! For me it can't only be about the smiles though. If it were, then I could have skipped the AT and just taken the family on a cruise or to Disney World.  For me it's more about the adventure and the challenge of hiking the entire 2,189 miles and sumitting Mt. Katahdin. The terrain of the AT is as diverse as the people that hike it.  It is physically brutal and beautiful at the same time. It punishes the body and rewards the senses. I cannot and should not try to beat this trail.  We take what the trail gives us and are grateful for it.
Earlier today I passed the 600 mile mark.  That's 600 miles of the AT behind me already.  The past seven weeks have passed quickly and I feel like I've traveled far. But there's still such a long way to go.  I'll be leaving Virginia the day after tomorrow and crossing into Tennessee.  Finishing a state and crossing a state border is an emotional boost for thru hikers.  I've enjoyed hiking through Virginia, all 550 miles of it. I'm looking forward to hiking through Tennessee and experiencing all that it has to offer.","

Columbus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612435,"Hello and welcome back.  The topics of this journal update are geared toward friends and family.  
I'm typing this update as I sit in my tent on the evening of Saturday, May 4th.  It rained today, again.  But I was on the trail early, at 6:30am in an effort to get in 10 to 15 miles before it got bad.  Well, as unlikely as it sounds that plan actually worked.  I got in 12.6 miles and pulled off the trail around 2:30pm. A short day but a good day nonetheless. Just as I finished getting water from a stream and setting up my tent it started to pour.  It was a really nice feeling being dry and warm, and eating some snacks in my tent as it rained outside.  I'm stealth camping tonight which means I'm not at an official campsite.  Stealth camping is a common and accepted practice on most parts of the AT. 
Let's talk about wildlife on the AT.  Last Sunday I saw the famous wild ponies in the Grayson Highlands of Virginia.  These ponies come right up to hikers and lick them and their gear. See attached photo. Anything with a salty taste is fair game to these ponies and they're not shy.  Yesterday, for a very brief moment I saw a small black bear 20 yards from the trail as it ran away and down the hill.  And today I passed a small snake on the trail. White tail deer are a common sight as well.  In the Shenandoah's there isn't any hunting so those deer aren't afraid and they just stood near the trail not paying me much attention as I walked by.  Not exactly wildlife but on several occasions the trail has taken me through farmers' pastures with cows and the occasional bull. And at the Four Pines Hostel in Catawba,VA the place was surrounded by chickens and a large rooster that crowed at 5am.  Lastly, I've probably passed or met more than a dozen thru hikers hiking with their dogs.  That may sound strange but people will hike the entire AT with their dog, except in the Smokies where it's not allowed.  I recall seeing Airdale and Jack Russell terriers, a boxer, a husky, a bull terrier/mastiff mix, and believe it or not I've even seen a chihuahua and a Great Dane on the trail. 
New topic: ""Trail Days"".  Trail Days is a Woodstock-like weekend event for AT thru hikers that takes place every year in May, in the town of Damascus, VA.  It's not my cup of tea but it's a very popular tradition and from what I understand people have a lot of fun. Some thru hikers, mostly the 20-somethings, will hitchhike or take paid shuttles to get to Damascus from wherever they are on the trail.  I just left Damascus a few days ago.  It's a very pleasant little town.  Shout out to my new friends Laura and Ray who I had a wonderful time hanging out with in Damascus.   Looking forward to seeing you both in New Hampshire in a few months.
For anyone that is interested in my progress I am happy to report that I have completed more than 700 miles and am now in Tennessee. Virginia is complete. Yay! Well, it's almost hiker midnight (9pm).  Time for bed.","

Columbus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614883,"Hello and welcome back to Columbus' AT journal.  It's been nearly 3 weeks since my last post.  This is the first of several updates that will be posted today.  I hope you enjoy them...
I had a great home visit!  After two months on the trail it was time for a much needed home visit.  I hiked into Hot Springs, NC on Saturday, May 11th and caught a flight home from Asheville, NC the following morning.  I had pushed hard to get to Hot Springs because that was my pre-determined stopping point. I was home for 11 days and returned to the trail on Wednesday, May 22nd. Here are just a few of the highlights from my home visit.
We attended my son Alex's college graduation commencement ceremony and celebrated with our extended family in Syracuse.  So proud of Alex for all that he's accomplished and for the person he is.
I enjoyed some simple home pleasures that might not have seemed so special before I left. Like...
1. Cooking dinner in the kitchen with Marcia. A bottle of wine on the counter and our favorite music playing.
2. Moving my daughter Meghan and all of her stuff out of her college dorm.  
3. Playing euchre with Marcia and the kids.
4. Wearing a pair of jeans and a cotton t-shirt. 
5. Working in the yard on a Spring  morning.  Tackleing the honey-do list. 
6. Hanging out with friends over a beer at Carey's pub, sharing a pizza with friends at Atlas Pizza and meeting with the breakfast club at The Central. 
7. Indoor plumbing. ?
Unfortunately we also experienced a difficult family event during this time.  I mention it here because I was grateful to have been home with family and because I believe my remaining time on the trail will provide me with opportunities to understand it.
The attached picture is a family snapshot from Alex's graduation ceremony.  It's not really trail related but like we always say: hike your own hike and journal your own journal...",,View Entry,"May 29, Wed",0
Columbus,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614891,"Hello again and welcome.  This journal update includes a few of my recent thoughts while on the trail.  I hope you enjoy them.
1. Taking the road less traveled.  An AT thru hike is by most accounts a road less traveled kind of thing.  An out of the mainstream and unusual adventure that relatively few people will undertake.   Me, an employed 53 year old taking a six month leave of absence is also unusual and another road less traveled.  More than 90% of AT thru hikers are 20-somethings or retirees who are not employed full time.  And doing a flip-flop thru hike (i.e. hiking south from PA to GA and then north from PA to ME) is again unusual and another road less traveled. About 80% of thru hikers start in GA and hike north to ME.  So, in all of these ways I find myself outside the mainstream of the working world and outside the mainstream on the trail.  It's neither good nor bad, better nor worse. It's just where I'm at, it all feels right for me, and ""...it has made all the difference.""
2. A tourist in the mountains. When we've gone on family vacations to far away places or when I've been on international business trips we were never really part of those places. We're tourists scratching the surface of the local culture for a few days before we return home. And there's no way anyone could become part of those places in such a short time, unless they're Anthony Bourdain (much respect).  I say all of this because during the last two and a half months I've begun to feel less like a tourist in the mountains and on the trail.  I have a better sense of the trail culture and trail etiquette, and a very basic understanding and a much greater respect and appreciation of what life is like in these mountains and the small towns within.  I now see myself apart from the crowds of day hikers that fill the trail on any given Saturday who haven't had the opportunity to better understand and appreciate this wonderful place they are visiting. In short, I'm feeling less like a tourist on the trail and in these mountains.
3. Let go and submit.  I cannot beat this trail.  I can't race to Katahdin to meet a timeline that I set before stepping foot on the trail. I need to submit and let the trail dictate my pace.  I have failed to do this on several occasions. I have to continually remind myself of this and adjust my thinking or I will fail to reach Katahdin and I will likely miss the bigger picture and enjoyment of this adventure. In practical terms this means my daily hiking mileage will occasionally decrease below my 20 mile target.
Those are some recent thoughts that I wanted to share.  There are others, more family and personal in nature that I have reserved for my offline journal.  
The attached picture is from a spot near the top of Clingmans Dome in TN.  At 6,643 feet it's the highest point on the AT.  Not so high that an oxygen mask is needed, but a glass of bourbon would've been nice...

Today, Wednesday, May 29th Waldo is taking a zero day in Fontana Dam, NC.  I have completed 966 miles of the AT and I have another 165 miles to go to reach the southern terminus at Springer Mountain, GA.  I anticipate being there in roughly 10 days and then flying from Atlanta, GA back to Pennsylvania to begin my 1,059 mile hike north to Mt. Katahdin in Maine. 
I returned to Hot Springs, NC from my home visit late in the afternoon on May 22nd.  After a night at the Laughing Heart hostel in Hot Springs I hiked 20 miles to the summit of Max Patch.  This is a popular spot among hikers because it offers beautiful sunsets and sunrises.  The attached photo is of my tent with the sun setting in the background on Max Patch.
On Saturday, May 25th I began my hike through the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. 72 miles of the AT are in the Smoky Mountains.  By noon on Tuesday, May 28th I had completed the Smoky Mountains and entered the town of Fontana Dam, NC where I am now. 
Tomorrow I will head back to the trail.  My next stop will likely be the town of Franklin, TN which is roughly 55 miles (3 to 4 days) south of my current location.

Yesterday, on Thursday, June 13th, after three months and three days I completed the SoBo (southbound) portion of my flip flop hike from Carlisle, PA to the summit of Springer Mountain in Georgia.  I hit the trail that morning at 6am, in the dark, to make it to the summit by 2pm.  There was a light rain that morning but it ended after awhile and left behind a beautiful misty forest trail that was filled with streaks of sunlight coming through the trees and onto the trail ahead of me.  Even though I was tired and my leg hurt from an injury I felt great.  If there can be such a thing as a peaceful celebration or a calm excitement then that is what it was like.  I imagined the rustling noise of the wind blowing through the trees as the mountain applauding along that final stretch of trail.  I reached the summit of Springer Mountain at 1:30pm.  I bent down and put my hand on the plaque in the attached photo and I thanked God for keeping me and my family safe during these past months.
Today, Friday, June 14th I am flying home to Corning, NY before beginning my 1,061 mile NoBo (northbound) hike from Carlisle, PA to Mt. Katahdin in Maine.  I have been struggling with a leg injury for the last two weeks that has put me slightly behind schedule.
I want to give a special shout out to a fellow thru hiker, Mississippi Mule.  I had the great pleasure of meeting him and his lovely wife on the trail just 2 miles before the summit of Springer Mountain.  Mississippi Mule - you brightened my day and helped me to remember why we hike.  Thank you for sharing your story with me.  Bless you  and happy hiking!","
