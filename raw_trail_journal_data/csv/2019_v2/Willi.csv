Willi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618533,with only five and a half weeks to go I figure it's time to get things together. I just came from the post office to return my Osprey pack to the factory warranty work. They will pretty much fix anything that's wrong with your pack. My pack has two thousand miles on it so it was beginning to look rather rough. I also ordered awols guide in the southbound loose leaf form. I have used in Northbound guide to like southbound in the past it's rather confusing particularly when you are at close to the Midway point of the trail. Northbound mileages and southbound mileage is very similar. I am considering buying a your sack major XL to replace my food bag. I definitely don't want to carry a bear canister. That's about all the time I have for now catch you on the flip happy trails,,View Entry,"Jul 11, Thu",0
Willi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618708,I know the next few weeks are going to really fly by so I really need to zero in on taking care of details.Buy details I mean not only taking care of gear and food drops but also paying forward on a few bills. I had to go to the dentist the other day and found out I need a root canal. I'm also thinking about getting a new pair of glasses before I leave. Feel like I'm running out of time what that very well may be. I just don't want to have an issue while I'm on trail that would bring me back home before I'm finished. Nothing works better than making a list and checking them off one at a time. Anxious to get my three entries done on this Trail journals so I can become become efficient at navigating this website. So gots to run for now I have grass to cut. Catch you on the flip.,,View Entry,"Jul 13, Sat",0
Willi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619789,"3 weeks to go I've got a few new items that have come rolling in. One is my AWOL guide southbound loose leaf. I can carry just a few pages and put the rest in my resupply boxes. I know there are a lot of people out there using gut hook on their phones, I'm kind of an old-fashioned I guess and like the paper in hand. Something else that just arrived is my bear resistant food sack made by ursack. I know this bag is a little heavier than my old food bag from z-pack but this will give me some added protection when I hang my food bag. I will also use a liner in the bag that is odor-free apparently. There is some controversy out there about hanging bear bags but I have always been a stickler about hanging my food and I will continue to be that way. Especially on the southern half of the AT. This week I was also in contact with osprey. They had determined that could not repair my pack. So  according to the warranty they're going to give me a brand new pack no charge awesome warranty kudos to Osprey. The only problem is I've been wondering how heavy that pack is, I discovered that it's 4.54 lb. And I know that it is very very heavy when it is wet. So I will take the new pack no charge can't beat the price. But I've been offered from my brother whose Trail name is Third Half to try out his Ula pack which weighs about half that much. So with anticipation building and a list of to do things in front of me I will continue to prepare and keep you all posted on how things are going, so for now happy trails and I'll see you on the flip.",,View Entry,"Jul 26, Fri",0

So this morning I'm going to try to be first in line at the Bureau of Motor Vehicles get a title transferred. Yesterday morning I took a 5-mile hike with my full pack at Caesars Creek State Park. Trying to wake up my legs have also been riding a bicycle. yesterday afternoon I split wood and stack it underneath my back porch so I'll have wood when I get home in November. Today I'm going to go to Columbus and see my dear daughter Mary. It will be very good to see her before I leave. So tomorrow morning will be my last week in the golf league and I'm also going to see my my friend Bruce who is into bees. I have a very young swarm I'm trying to help along so they'll have a chance to make it through this coming winter.  I've decided also to make fore more resupply boxes.

So I've been working on my resupplies. I took some to my dear mother today who is 93 years old and is going to help ship my resupplies to different points along the trail, to days picture is of her,also I've been volunteering for my sister's nonprofit that is parking cars at the Western Southern tennis tournament out by Kings Island. And of course I've made a few last-minute gear changes. Instead of borrowing my brother's Ula backpack I purchased one of my own. Also I have purchased a gossamer umbrella lightweight for backpacking. So that pack wait I thought I would have under 30 lb is creeping up there. When I get everything put together I'll put it on the scale. I think I'll be under 30 I hope so.

Willi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621071,"it seems like there's always a couple more things to put in the pack. Like last minute stuff. So I'm trying to refrain. The only thing I can think of that's going to add any more weight will be the umbrella which is not arrived yet. It weighs 8 oz. Sound pretty delighted to be a 28 lb at this point. I know and that when I pack for cold weather in the end of September that my pack weight will creep up by 4 lb or so for now I'm happy. Happy pack way hope it makes for Happy Feet.

I had the same feeling this morning and I had back in high school when I said I would jump off the top of Foster's Bridge. So when I got to Foster's and I climbed up to the top of the bridge actually thought, did I really say I was going to do this. So here I am driving to Harpers Ferry West Virginia saying that I would hike 1025 miles to Springer Mountain Georgia tween now and November. Sounds a little daunting but one step at a time on Mountain at a time one day at a time one section of trail at a time. This first section I'm hiking for three weeks before I go to a wedding in Boston and then I will fly out the next day to London with my brother. So that point I will be off the trail for two weeks. In England I am going to visit my son and granddaughter and the rest of the family. Then I will be back to continue my journey to Springer Mountain.  So for now I meet my good friend Betty and Harpers she will get some of my resupplies and send me off on the trail tomorrow.

I was pay flurry of activity from the time I got up until the time we finally left ,I was very ready to go. Bob and I walked up the hill from Harpers Ferry with me past Loudon Heights to the Virginia West Virginia state line . It was about to miles up the hill. It was good to have him with me give me. Remind me of all the hikes that we've done together which is approximately 1500 miles. I felt pretty much like a newbie out here I have a new pack new shoes registered at the atc have the through hiker pack tag. It was real nice to be back out into the woods although the temperature was probably hovering somewhere around 90°. I just make sure to drink plenty of water and take a pretty easy on the first day. So I'm at the David lesser Memorial shelter which was about 9.3 mi from much. She is just starting to get dark and has a lot of rumbling in the distance rain Beyond the way so I will hunker down in my tent and write out tonight I'm certainly ready to lay down and go to sleep I saw for now catch on the flip.

   The definitely August the woods starting to dry out a little bit the creeks are definitely your running dry i was only able to get one liter of water tonight hopefully the next Creek is a better source he's little shallow puddles I don't really like drinking out of them. The woods you're very similar to at home with the exception of honeysuckle. Honeysuckle in Ohio seems to be taking over the woods not the case here. This morning I was walking along the trail was some tall grasses later on today the woods was pretty clear of under growth and brush. I wish I knew more about the woods. I am referring to treetop able to identify more birds able to identify more plants and berries and edible plants. I have a lot to learn.
  I have just finished dinner and a cup of coffee. I'm going to turn it in for now have a long day tomorrow. So that's it for now I'll catch you on the flip. WILLI

I started in the middle of the roller coaster a little bit late. Buy one I only had seven miles done. It was a very rough morning so I decided if I were to make it to the next shelter that I wanted to make I had 8 miles to go with one one thousand foot climb so I just kept going. Pacing myself seems to be a real trick. It's tough when the Mind makes a promise that the body can't fill. Old folks boogie boogie if you will. I really wasn't even hungry I was so tired and hot. I did finally cool off and I ate dinner and had my coffee. It was a good evening and there was one other hiker in the shelter with me. Hey northbounder. He was also a snorer earplugs would have done me well if I had put them in before 1 AM. That's about all for now I'll catch you on the flip tomorrow is another day.WILLI

Willi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621729,"I wish I had not slept so late because of the Heat. I need to get up before sunup be ready to go. Maybe even hiking with headlamp. And try to beat the Heat. So I did get my mileage in and arrived at Scott and Lisa's Mountain Home where they have a hiker hostel at 4:30. Scott brought me into town and drop me off at a brewery that had a hiker friendly locker room of sorts I was able to do my laundry and take a shower and eat a burger while the laundry was going all for free. Did I mention it was still hot today. I did stop at a shelter that had a solar shower. I walked right on in with all my clothes on thank you very much. So as I said I am in town waiting for my ride and I'm going to pick a few things up from the store it's already hiker midnight which means I should be sleeping if I want to get up early and beat the heat. Tomorrow I do enter the Shenandoah National Park. Which should be awesome. Looking ahead the next two days I think I'm hiking about 28 or 29 miles to meet Bob in the park. He has a cabin which is operated by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club. So maybe I will be slackpacking on Saturday and Sunday. Meaning I will not have to carry all my stuff. Much lighter pack.
    I slept like a rock last night at Scott and Lisa's in the cabbin, the hiker cabin at their B&B. I did have a resuppl box there that I sent last week so I spent some time before turning in getting my pack straightened out. My food bag weighs about 10 pounds now.

Had breakfast with the Scott and Lisa at 7. I guess it's a good omen to have a double yolk egg, at least that's the way I took it. Very nice folks. Scott gave me the hiking permit to go into Shenandoah National Park so I would have it already when I got to the registry. My hike today was a little more controlled, what I mean by that is I took a easier going uphill and let her roll going downhill. I did miss read my location on the trail guide at one point wondering why it took me forever to go up this half mile 300 ft rides, I just kept going and going and going and when I realized what happened I had gone 3.9 mi on 1100 left rides, guess I gotta pay a little closer attention. Anyway I'm at a beautiful sight tonight which is called gravel Springs Hut, it has one of the nicest Springs I've seen anywhere on the Appalachian Trail, I was able to sit and put my feet in the downstream end of this spring was wonderful. The log at the shelter goes on on about bear sightings so I am on the lookout, there is a real nice bear box which I should put all of my own thing that smells like food will go in the bear box pretty early tonight. I'd like to turn in early tonight so I can get up early tomorrow morning and get on down the trail to Thornton gap which is where I'm going to meet Bob actually I should have been getting up early all week due to the heat and start hiking at Sun up instead of 8 or 830 burning up in the middle of the afternoon so I'm going to have some coffee and snack probably turn in and get up early in the morning.

So I had changed gear about 3 different times. The best piece of gear by far that I have heard this is my gossemeer umbrella which attaches to my shoulder strap of my backpack. The next in line would be my new rain skirt, which I did say skirt rain skirt awesome peace of equipment. Bye the time I did run into Bob it was full out rain. little confusing down there at Thornton gap getting to the parking lot. He had rented a cabin from the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club which we have been finally found and I will post a picture of that with today's entry. We're staying here for two very comfortable nights. He brought plenty of good food much better than Trail food. Which included vegetable stir fry and shrimp, the hows that for trail food  ,so settled in here very comfortable for the night, having a very heavy thought that tomorrow will be a zero day, after 6 days of hiking a zero sounds like a good idea, so that's about it for now catch on the flip, Willi

I was very lazy today which is typical of a zero day. After yesterday is rain the skies cleared and it was absolutely beautiful. Took a ride to get a cell signal and took some pictures at some of the over views. After the heat last week temperature dropped about 20 degrees was wonderful. I took two naps today. Late in the afternoon we walk down to the wayside and had burgers and milkshakes what you're quite the treat at the wayside.

He is very patient cook, I'm not exactly known for my patience, so I tend to burn a few more pancakes than he does. I took care of some last minute details getting ready to pack up again and we needed to drive down to Thornton Gap where I left off the other day. I caught a cell signal on the way down there and make some calls. After not starting until 10:30 it was going to be tough to get many miles in. I did hike to Rock Spring Hut which was 13.9 miles. There were several hikers around some of which I knew we're going to be quite noisy in the shelter. So I was anxious to get there ahead of them and pick the camp site farthest from the shelter.

So eat snacks along the way and just kept up a good pace I had 10 miles in by 11:30. I was actually looking for a good place to eat lunch and get water, but the water situation was not working out so well. So as the day went on I was searching for water which was turned off at some of the picnic grounds. I was meeting up off and on with another hiker also southbound and he had more information than I did on is device and we track down some water down and old service road. We decided on a stealth campsite which is where I am right now in a cemetery and we have our food bags hung in a tree as there is a bear somewhat circling the cemetery. We'll see how that goes normally you use your hiking poles to make noise the scare away a bear but we both use our tracking polls for tent polls. So I found some old metal signs that we can use for noise makers when this bear comes back.

Any of you that are familiar with the trail at Fort ancient that goes from the bike trail up the hill to the overlook some know it as killer Hill . well the equivalent is about 23 times going up killer Hill with 25 30 lb on your back. For this guy was very strenuous, probably more than I should be doing this early in my hike. So we make our way to Loft Mountain campsite. The Appalachian Trail actually runs around perimeter of the campground add an extra mile or so.  some purest cannot miss a single white blaze so they do that entire perimeter Trail, we did about 3/4 of it before cutting up into the campground, we got setup, went down to the camp store buying junk food , snack food and  I had a hot shower very nice if you don't get that sweat off of you tend to stick to your sleeping bag so was very good. I'm not sure about tomorrow Lone Bear is planning another 20 so we can be in position to do a nero which is a short day into Waynesboro to hiker hostel called Stanimal's we'll see.

Very nice stealth campsite on top of a ridge with a little breeze. I did not have it in me to do another 20 miles today. The hills were very strenuous. So I set up here and dried out my tent, hung my bear rope.
   I know some of you are probably wondering what happened to me. Since my last post has been probably 3 or 4 days ago. I have to make notes and then when I get a signal or get to Wi-Fi I can dump my notes into trail journals. So battery power is also an issue. I carry a backup battery pack but may investigate getting a bigger one. Tomorrow I will be in town at a hiker hostel I will have electric I will have Wi-Fi I will be able to update my journal.

Being that it is a holiday weekend there were several other hikers out. So I took the opportunity to speak with several. Very interesting to find out where they're from and what trails their hiking. So I knew the climb of the day to be 3 Rdges Mountain. It did not look like that big of a climb on the guide but the final mile, same as yesterday's  hike was pretty intense.
    Definitely the highlight of the day was the fact that I was able to call Asbury Hall at Otterbien and have them give the phone to brother John. John would tell you that September 1st 1947 was the first day WPFB was on the air out of Middletown Ohio, but it also happens to be the day he was born. So happy birthday John, it was a streak of luck to be able to get ahold of you on Three Ridges Mountain. May you have many more.

I had idea of going  in to Buena Vista getting some supplies since I'm running low having a burger and some fries and Shake getting back to the trail I'm 1.8 miles below a 60 at Brown Mountain Creek shelter. I'll take an inventory of my food supplies and have figured out how I'm going to make it another day and a half on what I have. I should make it down to the James River to see Bob and I will have about zero left which is good, thats the way itshould be I guess.    I did go over a few balds in the heat of the full Sun , which gave me the opportunity to use my umbrella it did an awesome job keeping me cool. Balds are hilltop or Mountain tops that just have grasses, possibly going back if you hundred years to win livestock would graze  the mountain tops. There is some controversy about whether to leave them that way or not. Personally I kind of like them. They're very good to get 360 degree viewpoint.

Willi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622922,"I have been off trail for 1 week and I'm going to be off for one more week.  I was in Boston last weekend for my nieces wedding. Last Sunday I flew to London with my brother, so as of now I am in Sheffield England with my son Craig and Granddaughter Hannah. Tomorrow we are headed to London to meet up with brother and his daughter Caeli's family. Should be an awesome day, they have a new baby Edith. I will be here until Friday and then I should be back on trail by the weekend heading south from the James river. Sounds like a lot of logistics because it is, but enjoying the trip. Retirement is a pretty good deal, keep those packages rollin!

Willi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623454,"I will be getting back on the trail today after a wonderful two and a half weeks of travel. I've been to Boston for a wedding, saw lots of family and friends and I've been to England including Sheffield and London and all points in between to see more  Friends and family, it has been an awesome time.
       And so after lots of logistics, flying from London  on Friday, driving from New Hampshire to Virginia yesterday, Bob will be dropping me off at the trail this afternoon where I left off a little over two weeks ago, back to the James River.     I will be trying to keep my Daily Post on trailjournals.com at the link below. Trailjournal.com/willi2019     I am still hiking for the non-profit charity Hike For Mental Health which a donation can be made to them in my name on the trail journals website. If you click on the three bars to the right of my picture and go to ABOUT you can donate there. I appreciate any amount at any time. It's all for a good cause.
   A special shout-out to Chris Lewis about how my Daily Post will be coming through. I will be posting daily on trail journals but at times I will be 3 or 4 days behind. That is because I'm trying to conserve battery or I do not have a strong enough cell signal. Thanks to everyone who is following me along the way. I appreciate your support.

Willi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623606,"Yesterday afternoon turned into more of a walk than I had anticipated. A misscalculation reading the trail guide I didn't finish walking until 6:00. After all the travel time I wanted to stop earlier than that.
    I only met a few people on the trail today and everyone seem to want to talk about water supply. It is very scarce. All of the creeks are dried up so you have to be very careful about staying hydrated and caring enough water. My pack is already have enough with this full food bag which probably wait 8 or 9 pounds maybe 10 and now I'm trying to carry 6/8 lb of water. The best thing I can figure to do is when I do find water drink about 1 1/2 liters and fill my bottles and move on.
     The picture for the day is a large soccer ball. Ashley to Tower for the federal Aviation Administration. There's no telling what you might run into out here along the trail.
     So today I pulled up much earlier than yesterday. It's really hard to get the motor going when I stop early in the afternoon. Especially if I take a nap. So here I am in Cornelius Creek shelter, looks like I'll be here for the night

Willi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623607,"Today's picture is of the lemon squeezer. I know it's been like this for a long long long time but I still felt like running underneath it.
  I only did 11 point nine miles today and seem like 18. But what I need to realize apparently is that play maybe jet lag and I have been off the trail for two and a half weeks. So hopefully the legs will kick in a little bit as the week progresses.
     I don't have a whole lot to report today. The big news seems to be the Heat and the lack of water . Big issues when you trying to hike over mountains with 30 lb on your back. So that's all for now I'll catch you on the flip.

Willi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623608,"Headed out this morning at 7:30 headed for Bobblet's Gap shelter. They were supposed to be water here at this spring which was just barely a trickle so we had to dip into the spring you're a few liters of water. Today's picture is of the last few drops running out of the pipe.
    I'm starting to recognize some of these places. This shelter is where Bob and I stopped a few years back and there was only one tent pad which he had set his tent up. When he realize there was no other place for me to set up he packed it up and we went up on an old logging Road. I will always remember that he didn't do not even hesitate. I think we've learned a lot about each other out here.
    So it was under black horse gap for lunch. As it would have it was another beautiful day. That's about it for now I'll catch you on the flip.

  Today was the day of Reese Supply in Daleville. I knew it was about 8 miles into town and I was looking forward not only to my resupply but also stopping at Wendy's. I knew it was right next door and I had ideas of getting a baked potato in a double cheese and Frosty which I did. I also visited and talked with a fellow hiker names Salty who has hike from Maine. I was having some negative self talk going on in my brain which he talk to me through. In spite of the 9 lb food bag and thousand ft climb in the heat I had a very good afternoon hiking in to Lambert Meadow campsite. It's amazing how much difference you can feel with a different attitude. I am very grateful to be out here. Especially to all those posted of help me and all supporting me thank you very much. that's about it for now I'll catch you on the flip.

  Took it easy on the mileage today, wanted  to enjoy McAfee Knob. I would definitely be today's picture. Apparently is the most photograph spot on the entire Appalachian Trail. Rumor has it that Virginia Tech freshman as a requirement or to take this hike up to McAfee knob.
   I talked to the ridge runner today at Campbell shelter where I had lunch. His Trail name is mr natural which is exactly who he looked like. I think it was the Grateful Dead Europe 72 tour they had a picture of mr natural on it.
   I will put several extra photos of McAfee knob in the photo section.
    I'm trying a little experiment tonight to see if I can be a little more comfortable. Apparently my air mattress is a 3 season air mattress. Normally 3 season means spring summer fall. But with this air mattress it apparently is Fall winter spring. This thing has this been cooking me In the Heat ever since I've had it. So tonight it's no air mattress maybe a little hard on the bones but at least I won't lay their sweating and then have a cool breeze get me cold. I swear this air mattress was designed by NASA, it reflects your body heat back to you, for the highest R value of any backpacking air mattress. I'll let you know how it goes. That's about it for now so I'll catch you on the flip. WILLI

Willi,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623807,"Four Pines Hostel.        7.9YIKES! OUCH! NOT GOOD!        Well this morning I had kind of a tough time. About two miles and I turned my ankle pretty bad. Turning ankles and falling down on the Appalachian Trail actually is a pretty common event. But I knew this time I went pretty far over and from the swelling I think it shows. So I'm in here at four Pines hostel evaluating the situation. My car is in DC at Bob's and I probably should just figure out how to get there and drive back to Ohio. So I'm off Trail for now but it has been quite an adventure. I know I'm pulling up way short and definitely want to thank everybody that's been pulling for me especially those of you that have donated to hiking for mental health, a special shout-out to those of you that donated to this worthy cause.     I'm not sure when I'll be back on the trail, actually this could be a blessing in disguise and the fact that is so dry out here you never quite sure when you going to get your next water fill up. The heat can't last forever but we really need to get some rain out here, as in a lot of rain. A nice slow drizzle for about a week with suffice.     And so for now thanks again and I'll catch you on the flip. WILLI
