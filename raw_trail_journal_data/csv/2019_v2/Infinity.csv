I am much more in tune with my body and how to adjust my to accommodate the changes as arthritis affects the way I can hike.
I have all the gear I need since I backpack on a regular basis, so I just may fine tune what I do have.
I am looking forward to reading all the journals from this year!",,View Entry,"Apr 04, Wed",0
