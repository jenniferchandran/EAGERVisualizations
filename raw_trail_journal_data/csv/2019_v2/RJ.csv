RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610692,"Gear choice is finalized, I think.  I've been on the fence between taking Z pack's Solo or Big Agnes HV2.  Z pack's is lighter by a pound, so it's my final choice.  Big Agnes gives me more privacy and weather protection, but I just can't justify an entire pound.  Not at my age - 76!  Z pack's Solo is so easy and quick to put up.",,View Entry,"Apr 17, Wed",0
RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610693,"I'm carrying a new bear canister this year.  I got it at Gossamer Gear.  It's little! but should be ok.  I can carry 3 days of food in it, I think.  And if I take more, I'll hang it.  I'm bringing my old standbys - taco, peanut butter, candy, trail mix, and a lot of oatmeal.",,Georgia,"Apr 17, Wed",0
RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610694,"I'm looking forward to the train ride - not!  26 hours from Buffalo, New York to Gainesville, Georgia.  I've decided to spend my first night there in the lodge so that I'm fairly rested to start April 22. Don't know how far I'll get this year and I don't care.  My fate rests with my knees and how long they can hold out.",,View Entry,"Apr 17, Wed",0
RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611135,I'm all set to start today.  Arrived by train yesterday morning and stayed here at the lodge in Amicalola last night.  I wanted to start off with a good night's sleep and didn't think the train would be a good place to get one.  I was amazed at how full the train was!  The seats in the dining car were even sold out.Hope to go about 10 miles today.  The weather looks good.  Right now it's 44 degrees with a promise by the weatherman to reach 70.  The flowers are out! Perfect!,"Amicalola

Will probably aim for Justus Creek campsite tonight.","Stover Creek Shelter

RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611310,Tough going yesterday getting over two mountains.  I drank and drank water but still felt dehydrated.  It's warm - 80 degrees and the leaves on the trees aren't out yet.  Today is starting out much better.  Had a good night's sleep at Justus Creek (mile 14.3) and today's terrain doesn't look as challenging. Highest altitude is 3593'.  I've made it to Lance Creek ( mile 23.9) and am going to spend the night here. Easier day today!,"Justus Creek

RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611524,The rain stopped this morning so I have decided to continue on.  I was pretty tired last night and thought about staying here an extra day and continuing on tomorrow.  But a good night's sleep in a real bed in a private cabin at Blood Mountain Cabins has spurred me on.  Nice people and the food was good!  Supposed to be chilly today with winds up to 40 - 45 mph.  Looks like dinner might be flour tacos with pb and j if the wind prevents starting a fire. The weekend's weather looks great! Called home while sitting under a tree with 100's of shoes hanging above me.  They're from all the hikers who buy new shoes when they get to the outfitter store here.  Quite a tradition! I myself bought new socks there.  So far my feet aren't in great shape but not bad either.  Ready to start up today's first mountain - Levelland (3870')  Tonight's destination is Low Gap Shelter at mile 42.6.  ,"Neel Gap

RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611676,"Called from the top of Rocky Mountain for a shuttle into Hiawassee and am spending the night in a motel here.  I'll decide after hearing tomorrow's weather if I'll stay here tomorrow and rest up or continue on.  The town will be very quick on a Sunday so I'm tempted to continue, but I'll see.  The descent into Unicoi Gap was very rough.  From the top of Blue Mountain to Unicoi it's 1076' over 1.5 miles.  I'm beat!","Low Gap

RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611713,I've decided to hike today as I'm waiting for a diner to open for my breakfast.  Didn't get a good night's sleep - the right knee is letting me know it's there. Shuttle is picking me up in an hour and not sure if he'll take me back to the trail at Unicoi Gap (mile 52.3) or Dicks Creek Gap (mile 69).  The trail is a triangle in this area so I'll end up back here in Hiawassee Monday night hopefully. Probably will spend the night at Sassafras Gap or some place in between Unicoi and Deep Gaps. Weather is good and in the mornings I feel great.,"Hiawassee

Hot!  No shade today and temps had to be 80+ degrees.  Drank as much as I could all day.  I'm at the best campsite ever at the edge of a cliff of Trey Mountain (mile 58).  The woods are beautiful and  expect to see a memorable sunrise tomorrow morning.  Feel good, my knee isn't bothering me but it was very rough walking today.  Tomorrow will hike the 6 miles back to Hiawassee to complete the triangle of this part of the trail.  What a beautiful area!","Dicks Creek Gap

RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611855,"Back in Hiawassee at the motel at mile 69 after having hiked the Triangle.  In bad need of a shower and clean laundry.  I'm in a catch 22.  Can't take a shower until clothes are clean.  Can't do laundry because there are no quarters and ATM has no money.  Will figure something out after lunch.  Sunrise was beautiful this morning from Tray Mountain.  Been hiking 8 straight days and the last day and a half were rough.  I've thought about resting tomorrow but the last day for the free shuttle back to the trail is today.  Everything will look easier after lunch, I'm sure!","Tray Mountain

So happy with the new water filter I bought at REI!  Rested up yesterday afternoon and evening and so I'm ready to go on.  Currently at Buzzard Knob (mile 72.2) and hope to reach North Carolina (mile 77.9) later today.  ","Dicks Creek Gap

RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611991,Made it just inside the North Carolina border to mile 78!  The next climb is several hundred rugged feet so I'm staying here for the night.   Felt great after talking with a guy who said at his age of 65 that he found the going very tough.  I just said that I wished I was his age and he was amazed at my 76 years!  Today was very rugged.  It's one thing to climb here but it's another to do it with a backpack and 90 degree heat.  However today is supposed to be the hottest day.  Feel good and just going to chill until the morning.,"Hiawassee

Waiting with 5 other people for the 12:30 shuttle from Winding Stair Gap into Franklin.  UPS tells me my other pack is in Franklin, so it might even get to the Microtel before I do.  I'm so dirty that I don't know if I should even bother washing my pants or just pitch them!  Two nights in a bed and some R&R are going to feel so good.  All is good!","Rock Gap

RJ,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612422,"Today was decision day.  Started out at the Microtel with severe heartburn after too much coffee and breakfast.  Severe storms were predicted for this afternoon and evening and they were severe!  It rained like it just couldn't rain any harder.  The sciatica is really acting up and I just asked myself - why am I here???  So ... I rented a car and am on my way home.  Had a great time but the climbs were really rugged and my body is the oldest it's every been.  Should be back home by Monday as I'm going to take it slow and stop often.  Right now I'm in White Pine, Tennessee and am so looking forward to my usual diet of fruits, veggies, and organics when I get home.  The best thing that happened today was in the Engels supermarket in Franklin, NC.  Someone who works there came up and asked me if I was Harrison Ford.  When I told him no, he was really disappointed!","Microtel in Franklin, NC
