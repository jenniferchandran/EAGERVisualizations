Was asked the other day why I would subject myself to such misery? The only thing I could say is that one person's misery is another adventure. Will set out Sunday on a local 24 mile shakedown hike.

Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607008,"I left Sunday afternoon on a 12 mile shakedown hike carrying my anticipated full load of 39 pounds. I'm fortunate to live on the Mississippi River and utilize the miles of levee system to train on. Although I can't mimic elevation, I can utilize the grade for ascending and descending. It was 40 degrees the previous day, however this day turned out to be 70 degrees with a predicted low of 62 at night. I reached my destination at about dusk and pitched my tent between the levee and a stand of woods. I then set up my sleep system, unpacked my pack and cooked inside my tent because of the mosquitoes. It rained hard at night for about an hour with some wind and my Zpacks Duplex tent performed well. I made a list of things that needed tweaking and at this point, every experience is chalked up to training and preparation.
The following morning, I packed up and started the 12 mile trek home. All went well, but this hike drove home the magnitude of hiking the Appalachian Trail for months. I'll continue my training regimen while anxiously anticipating my start date.",,Local,"Feb 11, Mon",0

We completed a tour making final visits or dinner dates with the kids/grandchildren, and hosted a farewell party at home with a bonfire in the pasture. Rachael and I also took a trip to Florida to enjoy the sunshine and spend time together. The number of calls, text messages, emails and journal guestbook entries of well wishes have been truly heartwarming. Trust that although I may not respond, I will read each one!

Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608032,Hiked down a mile from the Amicalola Lodge to the visitor center where I participated in a thru hiker orientation and signed in as #800 for the year. Our packs were weighed and we were individually gauged as to our preparations for the hike. I was incredibly impressed in the manner and organization by the ridge runner conducting the presentation. Headed out and tented on Springer Mountain. It rained for the final 2 hours of 11 mile hike. I guess we got all of the 20% chance that evening.,"Amicalola Falls

The night was cold but the sky cleared and I could see the illumination of the moon through my tent. As I looked out of my tent flap, the stars seemed close enough to touch due to the elevation and the lack of any light pollution. It sounded as though I was tenting on the beach because the extreme wind sounded like waves crashing. I woke up to witness daybreak the packed up and headed out. Stopped along the trail and ate breakfast as well as lunch. Trekked hard and made it to Gooch Mountain at 4:45, completing 15.5 miles. The weather warmed up and it was pretty on the trail.

When I made it to the white blaze I glanced at my compass and then the time and noticed that it was Thursday, March 14th. I then walked the next two hours wondering where I lost a day. I counted the couple of nights I pitched my tent and ate supper then ultimately realized that when setting my watch to daylight savings time, then again to eastern time the calendar advanced also. I’ve studied hiker fatigue, but kept thinking, not already! I could tell I was the first hiker on the trail because of the spider webs. Anyway I covered 15.6 miles making it to Neal Gap. I hadn’t intended to trek that far, but was encouraged, while visiting with one of the ridge runners on the trail, due to a severe weather line moving through. Split a shuttle into Blairsville, GA where I’ll hold up at a small hotel.","Gooch Mountain

Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608101,"Spent last night and again tonight at the Seasons Inn Hotel. I would be disappointed to zero this early, but I had two incredible days of mileage that it took the sting out of it. Blairsville is a quaint little town with a population of about 700. A lot of hikers have gotten off of the trail to avoid the weather. I definitely came out on the plus last night with my $7.00 all you can eat pizza buffet dinner paired with a couple of salads. After breakfast this morning, I got my laundry done and headed out to the Chick-Fil-A for lunch. On the way back I stopped at the CVS for chapstick and use the ATM. The lady working the register at the CVS said, “we just love hiking season!” I then stopped at the Foodland grocery store to pickup some re-supply items because I intend to take advantage of the coming good days of weather. I also bought some strawberries and milk to go along with my breakfast in the morning. The elderly gentleman hanging out at the register at the Foodland said in his north Georgia accent, “You one of them hikers?” I replied yes sir. He said “don’t let one of them bears get you!” I smiled and said no sir, I’ll run really fast! :) I’ll continue my calorie stacking at dinner tonight in preparation for getting back out on the trail. I will split a shuttle out tomorrow morning at 7:00 to Neels Gap, along with another hiker, to resume this great adventure.

Shuttled back to Neels Gap this morning and started out at 8:00. It rained with heavy fog, before clearing out at about noon. That’s ok though as there’s a particular beauty of being in the woods when it’s raining. Hiked 18.8 miles today and tenting near the Blue Mountain shelter. Only saw 3 other hikers on the trail, but there are a few more at the shelter. The wind is howling on the mountain top and temperatures are predicted to get down to about 25 degrees. It was a great day and the weather is predicted to be good for the next several days. I’ll post more photos when I get a strong enough signal or make it into town. Life is good!","Neels Gap

Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608211,"Woke up this morning after a restless night with sub-freezing temperatures and a howling north wind. Even though I have a 20 degree bag, I had to get moving to warm up. I felt pretty good after a marathon day yesterday. I packed up my things inside my tent then put my pack outside while I took my tent down. When done, I struggled to put my boots on. They were obviously still wet from yesterday’s rain with water running down the trail like a stream when ascending and descending. I then went to the bathroom and lowered my food bag down from the tree on the way back to my gear. The whole time thinking, you wanted adventure, you got it! I headed out and it took about 30 minutes or so for my boots to thaw. I continued hiking well past when I would have normally stopped for breakfast because of the cold and I wanted to get out of the wind. At some point, I was out of energy and stopped near a small stream for breakfast. Shortly after a church group of 5 people happened by and asked if I was a through-hiker. They then gave me a couple of small oranges, probably the best I’ve ever had! I headed out again and was battling fatigue from elevations when coming out of Unicoi Gap, just 2.5 miles into my day. I could feel my energy level rising slightly and felt a little better. When just about finished with my morning prayers, and coming down into Indian Gap, I noticed a few cars and trucks. More importantly, there were a few tables set up with people scurrying around. Could it be? Yes! I had happened upon my first trail magic experience. I was the first one there and soon joined by other hikers coming down the mountain. We all enjoyed homemade vegetable soup, fresh fruit, hot chocolate, soft drinks and chips. What a blessing at a time when I seemed to need it the most. Many thanks to the Smith family and friends for their generosity. Every March they leave their homes in central Georgia and head to the AT to perform trail magic. As I sit in my tent near a shelter at Deep Gap, the Smith’s and their friends are the main topic of conversation. I ended the day with 15.5 miles and with good legs and luck, I’ll cross the Georgia/ North Carolina border tomorrow.","The Blue Mountain Shelter Area

Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608394,"Another cold night last night, getting down to 28 degrees. The wind did subside some. Set out at 5:30 and began my hike in the dark. I like the peacefulness of walking through the woods at night. The other plus is that you’re already on the trail for daybreak and sunrise. I’ve seen lots of squirrels and birds, but this morning saw a red fox on the trail. We both stopped and looked at each other before she trotted off. At about noon today, I crossed the Georgia border and entered North Carolina. Although there are 13 states remaining, this was a small and badly needed milestone. John, the guy I met a couple of days ago when completing the 18 mile day is tenting in the same site again. He’s an attorney who became unhappy with his job. He quit his job, sold his house and has plans to finish the AT in early July and then begin the PCT ( Pacific Crest Trail). He is using this time to take stock of his life and make a decision on his future. I know that sounds radical, but in our brief conversations I feel like he’s got a handle on it. I suspect he’ll remain in law, but change his practice. We hike well together, but unfortunately I’m an early riser and he like to sleep late. When nearing the end of my hike today, I caught a low hanging tree limb over my right eye. I only mention this because of swelling that may be noticeable in photos. Took time out near the stream while filtering water to soak my feet in the stream. I’ve developed some tendinitis on the inside of my left ankle that I’m trying to manage. The stream water is extremely cold, but I kept my feet in until they were numb. We’ll see how this goes.","Muskrat Creek

Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608396,"Left Muskrat Creek at 6:00 this morning after another 28 degree cold night with lots of wind. Watched as the almost full moon went down leaving the stars almost close enough to touch. A rabbit walked out on the trail and we walked together for about 100 feet or so. When I stopped for breakfast, the tubing on my water bladder was frozen. This requires me to drop my pack and go to a reserve bottle, and although not frozen, it always has ice in it. I sleep with the water bladder in my sleeping bag, so I know it freezes within the first couple of hours on the trail, especially at higher elevations. I visited with another hiker, Schuyler, a 33 year old guy from Northeastern Vermont. Together we agreed to a 21.2 day which would take us to Long Branch. Although grueling, the climbs were not extreme until we reached Betty Creek Gap where we then began to ascend 1000 feet in 2.5 miles. This requires you at times to put away your trekking poles and climb with your hands and feet to lower your center of mass to prevent from falling. We walked into Long Branch at about 4:30, accomplishing our goal and knowing that I left it all on the trail today. I am now at mile 102 northbound on the Appalachian Trail. I set up, cleaned up, ate and went to bed. Darkness settles at about 7:30. At 4470ft, it would be another cold night with temperatures in the low 20’s. Nights like this are really long.","

Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608434,"Packed up this morning and hit the trail at 6:00am for a seven mile hike to Winding Stairs Gap where the AT intersects US 64. There we would meet a county shuttle bus that would take us into the town of Franklin, NC. Upon arrival at 9:00, I was blessed with more trail magic. Ole Lone Chair, who hiked the AT back in 1996, was there with bananas and homemade cookies. Like other trail magic providers, the offer of money is borderline insulting, as they do this as a matter of good will and the love of hiking. They’re also a great resource for local information. When we arrived in Franklin, we checked into a hotel room. This is my opportunity to charge my phone as well as the Anker portable charger that I carry. It is about the size of a deck of cards and allows me to charge my phone 3-4 times. While keeping my phone on airplane mode, I’m able to use the Guthook GPS driven app for navigation and to take photos. I walked down the street to a diner to eat breakfast consisting of 2 eggs, 3 slices of bacon, 2 sausage patties, a large serving of hash browns, 2 slices of toast, 3 cups of coffee, and a large glass of orange juice. It was all great, and once again I sensed a true appreciation for the business hikers bring into town. Had to finish eating so I could do my laundry, get lunch, re-supply my food and then eat dinner. The bathroom, bed and amenities we’ve all become accustomed to mean so much. You haven’t really lived until you do what the bears do in 22 degrees with a 25mph north wind. Up early for pancakes then back to Winding Stairs Gap, heavy again with food, to resume this adventure. Many thanks also to my little Trail Angel Christine for helping with the posting of photos. Wi-Fi here is not what we’re accustomed to which makes it difficult. Thank you all for your interest, love and support.","Winding Stairs Gap

Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608642,"Got up this morning and caught the church van over to the First Baptist Church in Franklin, NC. There myself and other thru hikers were treated to a free breakfast of all you can eat pancakes, bacon, boiled eggs, fruit, coffee and orange juice. This is something the congregation does every morning during hiking season and it’s advertised throughout the town. There was no attempt to convert one over to their faith, but the associate pastor did speak briefly and it was very fitting, relating that the packs we carry through the mountains are small compared to the burden that Jesus carried. The fellowship was good and we were asked to sign a large 2019 thru hiker banner with our trail name. We were then brought back to our hotel where I loaded onto a county shuttle bus, headed back to Winding Stairs Gap to resume the adventure. At 9:30 I began to hike until 6:30 covering 19.4 miles where I will tent tonight at Tellico Gap at 3800ft which should provide a little relief from the cold. I really wanted to make another couple of miles to Wesser Bald, but simply ran out of gas. The elevation gains were tough today climbing to above 5000ft on multiple occasions. The views remain incredible.","Winding Stairs Gap

Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608643,"Left this morning at 5:20 and hiked for an hour before stopping at Wesser Bald. 
There I ate my first breakfast and stopped near John’s tent to roust him. I stayed there long enough to hear him grumble about me violating his civil rights and then I heard him open the valve on his air mattress. This is a sure sign that he would be moving soon as no one will lay on the cold ground for long. Schuyler and I then set out for the 6 mile downhill to the Nantahala Outdoor Center. It wasn’t long before John caught up to us. Once there, we ate breakfast, set individual mileage goals and secured our permits to thru hike the Smokies. At 11:00 we ate lunch then set out individually to hike our own hike. The sky was clear and blue, however about an hour before reaching Sasafrass Gap, heavy sleet began to fall. By the time I got to the Gap, it had subsided allowing time to set up for the night. Shortly after it began to snow, and it did on and off throughout the night. When I went to sleep, the woods around me were covered in white. Absolutely beautiful and cold! I finished the day with 15 miles.","Tellico Gap

Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608644,"Set out at about seven as the woods and trail were covered with about 2-3 inches of snow. Although it was slow going due to the snow and ice on the trail, the scenery was beautiful. Hiked for 15.4 miles and tenting at Cable Gap. I will attempt to be on the doorsteps of the southern boundary of the Smoky Mountains by mid day tomorrow.
 A question was funneled to me regarding my diet and what I eat when out on the trail. When I get packed up in the morning I hit the trail.  Normally at about 8:00 I’ll stop and eat a couple of protein bars. I’ll stop at about 10:00 and eat two pop tarts, or what used to resemble a pop tart. At about 12:30, I’ll stop again, this time taking my pack off and sit on a rock. For lunch I’ll normally eat peanut butter or tuna on a tortilla. I’ll have either corn chips or cheetos along with this. Depending on my mileage goal determines how long I take for lunch, but no longer than 25 minutes. The remainder of the day, I’ll eat a mix of cashews, peanuts and dark chocolate M&Ms, and a snickers bar. In the evening, after getting cleaned up and setting up my tent, I’ll eat my big meal. In the beginning, I had a few dehydrated meals, but I’ve since transitioned to instant mashed potatoes with bacon bits or ramen noodles that I’ll stir some instant potatoes into. I also carry a block of sharp cheddar cheese and will eat some with most evening meals. I finish up with a Little Debbie brownie. I’m sure this will change later, but sweet and salty are big cravings. I drink an average of 2 liters of water throughout the day and another liter with supper. 
This has been and continues to be an incredible experience, regardless of the weather conditions.","Sassafras Gap

About 6 times between then and 12:30 am my sleep pad and or sleeping bag slid down to the end of my tent. Apparently the ground was not as level as I thought it was when I set the tent up. Anyway, I was frustrated, packed up and hit the trail. Made it to Fontana Dam by daybreak and entered the Smoky Mountains at about 7:30am. At about 1:00, I  stopped at Mollies Ridge where I ate lunch and took a nap. After a 24.5 mile day, I’ll tent tonight at Spence Field. The Smokies permit requires you to stay in one of the shelters spaced out and located along the trail. There were 3 families camping at the shelter so I tented for the night. I’m now 6.2 miles into the Smoky Mountains. Although I’m much higher in elevation than anywhere before, the Smoky Mountains are fair with much more forgiving grades than in Georgia and NC before the park. I’m curious to see if this continues. I plan to hike hard again tomorrow in an attempt to get to Newfound Gap on Monday to avoid another weather system.","Cable Gap

Although tired from the previous 24 mile day, I opted to hike the 19 miles as rain was predicted for the following morning. I was able to reach Rocky Top by daybreak and took photos, but I’m certain it won’t replicate the beauty I’ve witnessed. Pressed on and made it to Silers Bald where I ate lunch and took a nap. I then began the long strenuous hike up to Clingsman Dome, elevation 6658 feet. Until now, the forest has been bare. When I reached the upper elevations, the wind whispered through the dark green needles of the plentiful frasier fur trees. The fragrance was wonderful and the snow from two days ago lined the trail and forest floor. The trail was treacherous on the way down as snow has melted and frozen leaving a layer of ice. I have fallen a total of three times since I’ve been on the trail, and two of the falls occurred today as a result of the ice. I finished the day and will tent tonight at Mount Collins. This will set me up for a five mile hike into Newfound Gap where I will meet my sister Sue. I can’t wait!

My sister Sue and I had previously planned to meet at Newfound Gap at noon where she would facilitate my trail needs of laundry, re-suppy and rest at a friends home on the outskirts of Gatlinburg. As I meandered through the woods with no particular hurry to cover the 4.9 miles to Newfound Gap daybreak occurred and then the sky began to darken again. It was evident that rain was imminent so I picked up the pace. I hiked the remaining mile under a light drizzle and opted to jump in on a shuttle that other hikers were taking into Gatlinburg. This would alleviate the need for Sue to drive the 45 minutes up the mountain to pick me up. We made it into Gatlinburg and I was just finishing up breakfast when she arrived at the restaurant. I introduced her to Crazy Horse, Hi-Ex and Aladdin and we set out. Laundry was done and I rested. Once I determined what I needed for my re-supply, we went shopping and out to eat again.

Later while laying in a real bed, I heard it raining on and off throughout the night. We awakened to more rain, tidied up the house and left for breakfast. Sue then dropped me off at the nearby “Lodge of Legends” hiker hostel on the outskirts of Gatlinburg where I had previously arranged for a nights stay. The by donation only hostel is run by a considerate couple in support of AT hikers. This will be my second 0 of the journey. I’ll share a large basement with 5 other thru hikers. The basement is equipped with a 100 gallon hot water heater to support long hot showers, a refrigerator, fireplace and anything a weary hiker might need. It continues to rain which reaffirms that I have made or lucked my way into another great decision. Sue surprised me and had lunch delivered at the hostel and now my only responsibility is to rest and keep the fireplace fed. I will remain here for the evening and eat my left over pizza.I will shuttle out back to Newfound Gap early tomorrow morning to continue moving north at the 207 mile on the AT with 1,985 miles remaining. This does not account for the 8 miles of approach trail to get to Springer Mountain, as well as the the two-tenths here and there to get water or reach and suitable campsite. As said on the trail, one foot in front of the other, one more mile and happy hiking. The weather is improving now and the rain has given way to a beautiful sunset over the Smokies.

Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609047,"Left the hostel this morning at 6:30 am with the shuttle driver and made it to Newfound Gap at about 7:00am. Started out on yet another icy trail in the Smoky Mountains, this time with a heavy pack with 6 days of food and a full load of water. About a half mile up when climbing out of Newfound Gap, a group of day hikers stepped off the trail to let me by. I offered if any of them would like to accompany me to Maine, but all I heard were groans. I later climbed up on top of Charlie’s Bunion to see the view and then pressed on. After a 15.7 mile day, I will camp at Tri-Corner Knob. I would love to go further, but it’s 8 miles to the next shelter area and that would be pushing it. Although the Smokies are pretty, I look forward to getting out due to the requirement to tent near the shelters. This either limits your mileage or stretches your endurance as you try to reach the next shelter. Anyway it’s good to be back on the trail after a zero. 
A question was asked about how I gather water. I use a Katahdin water filtration hand pump. I’ll use a spring or stream to pump water directly into my hydration bladder using a quick connect fitting. I simply snap the mouth piece off and connect the fill tube. It takes about 70 pumps to fill the 2 liter bladder. Through a lot of the Smokies I simply ate a lot of snow. Sure it had frasier fur tree needles in it, but I just wrote that off as fiber. Others on the trail more commonly use a Sawyer filter. With this version you fill a bag and force the water through the filter and into a bottle. Several people had to replace theirs after the extreme freezing temperatures due to micro-cracks within.","Newfound Gap

Each step had to be short and deliberate to prevent from falling. By noon I entered Davenport Gap which is the northern border of the Smoky Mountains. Although the Smokies were incredibly beautiful, I will not miss the sub-freezing temperatures and the miles of ice laden trails. At the Gap, there was a guy by the name of Tugboat who was granting trail magic by handing out soft drinks, chips and fruit. I dropped my pack and sat in one of the lawn chairs he had set out. We visited a while as I ate a couple of bags of chips, an orange and drank a can of sweet tea. Tugboat does tree monitoring for the national park service and when he comes out, he performs trail magic. Before leaving, I off loaded all of my trash, thanked him and pressed on. What Tugboat doesn’t know is that I would have been happy just sitting in that lawn chair for a while. By 1:30pm I made it just passed the Pigeon River bridge where I stopped to eat while letting my feet soak in the running stream. This was at elevation 1,372 feet and the temperature had warmed quite a bit from the sub-freezing temperatures where I spent the night at 5900 feet. Once finished, I pressed on an under I-40 near Davenport, NC and began to climb elevation again. I finished the day with 20.5 miles and will spend the night stealth camping near the intersection of two streams at an elevation of 2845 feet.

I have not used an alarm clock during this entire journey, but I guess that’s what happens when you go to bed at 7:30pm. Anyway I went about my morning routine of changing into my hiking clothes, loading my pack and breaking down my tent. I then walk over where I had hung my bear bag for the night. This is done by throwing a small sack, attached to a 50foot length of parachute cord over a tree branch preferably 15-20 feet high. A rock is used to weight the sack so that it’ll reach the limb and then slide down the other side. I then remove the sack and attach my bear bag which contains all of my food, any trash and toiletries such as toothpaste. Basically anything with scent. Before pulling the bag up, I also pass the cord through the carabiner. I then pull the bag all the way to the tree limb. Now I take a stick and place it in a slip knot as high as I can reach. When I lower the bag, the stick stops the cord at the carabiner. This allows the bag to hang high enough so a bear can’t reach it from the ground and low enough so a bear can’t reach it from the tree limb. This is referred to as the (PCT) Pacific Crest Trail method. Anyway, I tell you all that to say that after lowering my bag this morning, the end of the cord with the carabiner got stuck in the tree. There was no other solution but to climb the tree to recover my carabiner and cord. Trust that I’ll remember to take the carabiner off next time before I pull the cord down as climbing a tree in the dark is never in the plans after waking every morning sore and fatigued from the previous day. As I’ve done before, I kept telling myself, “You wanted adventure huh? Get you some more.”
Once I got my pack together and pockets loaded with breakfast and snacks I headed out. I began with a 40 minute climb on a grade similar to that of the Mississippi River levee back home. This would be the first of four similar climbs before 9:00am. As I watch the lights of the city of Davenport flicker in the distance, I couldn’t help but think that when Mr. Benton MacKaye, founder of the Appalachian Trail, planned the section between Davenport Pass and Hot Springs, NC he chuckled and said watch this. This section of trail has been some of the most strenuous of the 265 miles I’ve hiked. 
Today’s total distance was 21.9 miles which will set me up for a 9 mile trek into Hot Springs, NC. There I will resupply, clean up, do laundry and of course, eat.","Painter Branch

The Victorian style mansion and grounds date back to 1840, and was used as an interment camp for 2,700 German naval officers captured at the beginning of World War I. With all the history and antique furnishings, $25.00 a night will work just fine. My next order of business was to eat, of course.

I began this trek with a pair of boots that I had faithfully broken in with about 200+ miles. They became too small and I was lucky that Sue was in Louisiana at the time. When we met in Gatlinburg, she brought me my larger backup pair, size 10.5, which I had also broken in and planned to transition in to later down the trail. Although better, the problem persisted when on the punishing downhill sections. I purchased a size 11 Altra Lone Peak and put them through the paces on the rock incline and decline deck at the outfitter and couldn’t duplicate the pain, but of course nothing will mimic the trail. I sure hope this solves the problem as it’s the only issue I’ve had thus far.
I shared dinner tonight at the Smoky Mountain Cafe with a double, Triple Crown Hiker by the name of Thirsty Boots from Vermont. He is 66 years old, married for 43 years, retired at the age of 50 and has been hiking and biking on and off since. Thirsty Boots has completed the Appalachian Trail, the Pacific Crest Trail and the Continental Divide Trail each twice. He is hiking the AT for the third time. His answer to all of this is that he just likes walking. He’s a well rounded, polite, soft spoken guy and a book of knowledge when it comes to hiking. 
It was a beautiful, sunny day today in Hot Springs with a high temperature of 76 degrees. I will set out again tomorrow morning to continue my adventure. There is a 100% chance of rain after midnight which should break at about 9:00am. Temperatures will then get down in the low 20’s again. Adventure I tell you!
Thanks again to all who have taken the time and effort to leave a note on my guest book. You will never know how much this means and motivates me after a long day.","Big Rock Spring

I then walked north on Main Street and resumed my hike. The climb out of Hot Springs did not disappoint as with other towns and gaps. I continued on and at about 11:00 am, after crossing a road and a mile or so out of Tanyard Gap, there was an an eight pack of 8oz Pepsi colas sitting next to the trail. More trail magic and it amazes me to the extent that people go out of their way to help hikers. I drank one, crushed the can and carried it off in my trash bag.

Unlike other mornings, I noticed a lot of deer tracks on the trail. The transition to the trail runner shoes have made a remarkable difference in my feet. The only time I feel the toe joint pain is when I stump my toe or land awkwardly on a rock or root. These shoes have a zero drop, so unlike a running shoe the sole is flat. This takes some getting used to as my Achilles’ tendon feels like a banjo string. Other than this, I have no blisters, just sore, tired feet at the end of the day. I keep telling myself that I’m sure Jesus had issues when walking through the dessert, at least I could go to a local outfitter and get some advice.

Apparently the 2 inch vinyl covered mattress had little stuffing left in the mid section where your hip would rest. I tried to place my down jacket there to fill the void, but nothing seemed to help as I tossed and turned. I could have remedied this by using my air mattress, but it sounds like a Sunchip bag and would have been inconsiderate for the other 5 hostel guest. At 12:30am I gave up, got up, grabbed my sleeping bag and headed out to a hammock which was hanging outside on the porch. I slept there until 3:00am at which time I got cold from underneath. I put my down jacket underneath my bag, but it didn’t help. At 3:30 I gave up, got up and packed up. Headed out under a clear sky and it was 35 degrees in the mountains. I can’t describe the tranquility of the morning in writing with the stars shining brightly with a slight breeze. The morning was great accomplishing 8 miles before 8:00 am. I saw turkeys and grouse. With warmer temperatures, and the first one out, I was a spider busting machine. Later in the morning, I stopped in a thick large stand of fraiser fur trees on Unaka Mountain, laid my footprint down, ate a pop tart and took a quick nap. It was beautiful as I looked upward at the dark brown bark, deep green leaves against the deep blue sky. I finished the day with 24.5 miles and will sleep tonight at the Greasy Creek Friendly hostel to escape rainfall tonight. I will trek 5 miles tomorrow morning to meet my Louisiana friends at Hughes Gap. 
A question was asked about whether or not I listen to music on the trail. While some do, I do not. I like to keep my ears open to hear birds and other animals. I normally say my prayers in the morning, and sing out loud on and off throughout the day. A really can’t sing so I limit it to the shower, the tractor or the trail. My song selections vary widely, but I try to think of songs with references to the state I’m in. My other pastime is self reflection and to daydream, but I’ve got to be careful not to detour off the trail as other trails intersect the AT at various points. On several occasions I’ve walked for a while without seeing a white blaze which designates the AT. The last thing I want to do is burn leg energy trekking up the wrong trail.

It rained all night with the wind blowing. I woke up at 6:00am, got my things together and headed over to the main house to settle up with the elderly lady that runs the hostel. I paid $15.00 for the bunk and $9.00 for a large pizza and a couple of soft drinks. What a bargain and the weather made it that much more special. It was still raining when I headed out to meet my friends Allen Carpenter and Taylor Moss at Hughes Gap. I got there at 9:30 and stood at the county roadside. Stills raining and now that I stopped moving, I began to get cold while my mind began to wonder if I had given them the right location. We had originally talked about Carver Gap which was another 6 miles of hiking, but I was certain there was no miscommunication. I’ve worked with these guys for years and if they said they were coming, I knew they’d be there. Shortly after 10:00, they pulled up and man were they a sight for sore eyes. Taylor put my pack in the cargo area and we were off to go get breakfast. We then traveled to a cabin that Allen rented in the mountains. I determined what I needed for food resupply and they headed out, while I stayed back to do laundry and get some rest. They’ve made trips before as Allen enjoys photography and Taylor locates old woodworking tools to purchase and refurbish. Regardless of their side interest, they drove 15 hours, with me in their plans. Once back, they had all of my resupply items I needed. Later in the afternoon, Taylor started a fire in the fire pit and Allen cooked dinner. We had steaks, corn on the cob and mashed potatoes. We shared beer and enjoyed conversation around the fire pit. The visit was an incredible morale boost that will propel me to conquer Roan Mountain tomorrow morning.","Greasy Creek

Their visit was incredible and the effort to come out to see me truly moving. 
I hit the trail and summited Roan Mountain, elevation 6200 feet, at about 11:00, but was in a cloud bank so I was unable get any photos. There was still plenty of ice remaining at this elevation, but nothing compared to the Smokies. 
I pushed on and made it to Carvers Gap to find Ms. Pat granting trail magic. I ate three ham & swiss cheese sandwiches, a bag of Funyuns and a coke as we visited briefly. The only negative to happening upon trail magic is your food bag/pack don’t get lighter. That’s okay though. I’ll hump the weight as the magic breaks up the monotony of eating the same thing again and again. Plus the interaction lifts your spirits during the midday slump. 
I eventually made it to Hump Mountain and after a strenuous climb there were exceptional views. I originally planned to camp at Doll Flats, but pressed on another couple of miles and camped at Wilder Mine which is about 1000 feet lower in elevation. The significance of Doll Flats is over the last couple of weeks I’ve been hiking in and out North Carolina and Tennessee. Reaching Doll Flats means that I now bid North Carolina farewell and finish the day with 20.8 miles. 
I am tenting tonight near the Gambs family. Shortly after dinner, myself and another thru-hiker Giggles, were invited over for roasted marshmallows. The marshmallows and company were absolutely great as we visited around their campfire.

Some days are like that, but I really can’t put my finger on why. Couldn’t help but think of my friend’s visit yesterday as I snacked on and off on Allen’s homemade beef jerky he made for me. Sometimes during mid morning I passed mile 400 and that’s progress. At lunch, I set the footprint for my tent under a tree and took a nap. I really don’t know how long I slept, but had to pickup and get moving when a light drizzle began to fall. I crossed several streams and waterfalls today and their beauty never gets old. Regardless of my mileage goal or time of day I always take time at each as they’re all unique in their own way with a special character. Finished the day with 25.3 miles and will spend the night at a hostel about 15 miles outside of Hampton, TN. 
I had a conversation with another thru hiker today who also started on March 11th. We were comparing notes and strategies. He commented that I seemed to stay in hostels a lot. I explained to him that I have walked in the rain for about 12 hours since I started, and that I’m not opposed to it, in fact I don’t mind hiking in the rain, it’s the setting up on a rainy evening and breaking down on a rainy morning that gets challenging. For instance today I planned to trek 20 miles, however due to the rain, I hiked further and will sleep in a hostel near Dennis Cove. I went on to explain to him my thought process in that it’s not how much misery you sustain, it’s about maintaining morale while achieving the ultimate goal and getting to Mount Katahdin. The other advantage is that you don’t have to stop when the weather clears to dry out your tent. As I write this, it is raining tonight and I’m dry in the hostel. The other hiker I referenced is me.

The weather forecast remained consistent in that rain will begin at 1:00pm and it was correct. I have just eaten a pizza with a coke, then some leftover black beans and rice that was in the hostel refrigerator along with a large glass of whole milk. I followed this up with a pint of Blue Bell buttered pecan ice cream and a cup of coffee. 
I caught up on the phone with my wife and kids and later rode the shuttle into Hampton, TN for dinner.
As I prep to leave tomorrow morning there are no more butterflies caused by thinking that there is something I might need or have forgotten. I’m focused and ready to resume this great adventure. 
To answer Mick’s question as he plans for 2021, my original pack weight was 38 pounds and I’m down to about 33 pounds. At orientation, 36 was about average. This was mostly due to excessive food. Instead of 5-6 days, plan on 3-4 days. A quick resupply is easy especially early on, but you have to be disciplined. Never resupply when you’re hungry. Regarding the sleeping bag, I have an Enlightened Equipment 20 degree bag that doubles as a quilt. The nights in the Smokies were cold, but I had one 16 degree night after that. Tights, socks and a good puffy jacket will get you through. March 11th was my start date to avoid colder weather, but also to stay ahead of the crowd. Stay organized, by that I mean know where everything is and everything has a place. If you take something out put it back, if you unzip a pouch on your pack zip it back so nothing will fall out. When it’s cold, dark or raining there is no time to fumble around looking for things. When you commit to move in the morning, move!   Don’t underestimate the need to prepare mentally. There are other notes that I’m compiling that will help friends with their planning that I’ll post at the conclusion.

I was concerned about the number of donuts, but that’s all I could carry. 
It rained for the first 4 hours out of Shook Branch and the trail was foggy. Ben, from southern Georgia, was hiking with me today. He used to be referred to as The Bens when his son was hiking with him, but his son left the trail and went home about a week or so ago. Sometimes during late morning, we stopped to navigate and noticed two deer about 20 yards away. They were browsing and would occasionally look up to ensure we were not a threat. We continued on and at about noon the weather broke and eventually the sun came out.The sun cheers me up and I soon began to sing. Apparently the sun cheered the grouse up also because I could hear them throughout the mountain side as they make a sound similar to a base drum. I sang a song that Thirsty Boots recommended.

Crossed the Tennessee / Virginia line at mile 466.9 and this was a huge morale boost. There were times over the last couple of weeks when I noticed that my shadow was in the wrong place. Confirmed by my compass I’d often be hiking in a southerly direction. The last couple of days, the trail direction has been primarily north/northeast, thus contributing to the ultimate goal of getting to Maine. I’ve become trail wise in that if you’re wondering where the trail will lead next, just look for the next highest mountain and that’s where you’re headed. 
I made it to Damascus at noon covering the 18.7 miles. This gave me time to eat and then go to a local outfitter to change my water filtration system from the pump I’ve been using to a Sawyer system which will save some pack weight.

We had yo-yo’ed (passed each other again and again) a week or two ago but hadn’t really spoken, and now we’re at the same hostel. He was waiting for his wife to fly in and they were going to hike together for a bit. Ranger, a former Army Ranger, is an incredible guy with an even more incredible outlook on life. His life experiences are many for his age and his reason for hiking the AT is powerful.

Headed out at 7:30 with a stomach full of coffee, milk orange juice, blueberry waffles, scrambled eggs, tator tots and fruit. By 8:00 we completed our walk through town and entered the mountains. The AT runs through the middle of Main Street Damascus. Ben was with me and we began to climb hard and did for about three to four hours. For a minute I thought that we were back in Southern North Carolina, as there were no switchbacks, just straight up. I also read and heard that Virginia will be flatter, as I recalled with contempt. I was leading and stopped briefly to make some journal notes and Ben continued on telling me that he’s sure I’ll catch up to him soon. I finished and pressed on and realized later that I should have caught up to Ben by now. I continued on and ultimately realized that I was off the trail. I was on a trail, but not the AT. My first mistake was misreading fungus on a tree at a distance as an old faded white blaze marker, as this is how the AT is marked. The second indication was that I was off course was when I came upon horse dung on the trail and the third was mountain bike tracks, both of which are prohibited.  I stopped and confirmed through GPS that I made an error and began backtracking. I ultimately found where I made the wrong turn at a creek crossing. It is at these crossings that other trails often intersect. I determined that as with all stream crossings, I slowed down to concentrate when stepping from rock to rock so that I don’t break an ankle or fall into the stream. The error cost me a mile and a half round trip of walking, half of which was uphill. There is no one looking out for you and there are no excuses or timeouts on the AT. If you fall or error on your course, you have no one else to blame. You simply figure it out, fix it and press on, and I did. At about 1:00pm, and after a long strenuous climb with switchbacks, I rounded a curve and Ben was sitting on a log eating lunch. He barked and asked where I’ve been. I explained the error and he went on to tell me how concerned he was that something had happened. The whole time after correcting my error I kept telling myself “that’ll get your mind right.” This is an expression I used regularly in my former professional life and it certainly fit the situation. I stopped and made myself eat although I was extremely fatigued from the climb. We then pressed on. 


I ultimately recovered mentally and it was a beautiful warm and sunny day on the trail. Ben and I trekked 17.2 miles and are stealth camping near mile 488 northbound on the AT. The mile and a half route error is chalked up to adventure and experience and doesn’t count.

The trail crossed a cow pasture and as my light illuminated the grass barren path, something translucent on the trail caught my eye. I noticed that there were thousands of earthworms on the trail and as my light illuminated them, they would slither into a hole. It seemed like something you might see in a science fiction movie. I didn’t know earthworms could move so fast and it was fascinating to watch. I continued to climb and eventually began the ascend to Mount Rogers with visibility only about 15 feet due to rain, and the clouds, similar to driving with headlights in the fog. The rocky climb was tough, compounded by 50 degree temperatures on wet hands, and gale force winds. We remained in the clouds for most of the morning. Later in the morning and still on the way up, there were two wild ponies walking southbound at a steady pace. They approached, stopped and began to lick the salt off of my legs. I’ve read about this and although not surprised, experiencing it is another story. After a little while, I moved on. Once summiting and stepping rock to rock and climbing others, the trail orbited the crest and the descent began with a similarly rocky trail. I’d like to say I enjoyed Mount Rogers, but I didn’t. The rocks on the trail never let up and the bottom of my feet felt it.

The shelter accommodates five people on a first come first serve basis and I opted to sleep in the shelter with two other hikers. I was in the twilight stage of going to sleep when just prior to dusk another two hikers came in and the shelter was now at capacity. I’ve avoided sleeping in shelters to this point due to rodents, snoring and other hikers body odor, as I can barely stand my own. At about 10:30pm the skies opened and it began to pour with blinding lighting, loud thunder and strong wind. The rain continued for sometime, drowning out the snoring coming from the other end of the shelter and then later lightening to a drizzle on the metal roof. I laid there sleepless for over an hour once again counting my blessings that I had made another incredibly good decision. The night eventually passed and I awakened, packed up and hit the trail for about 4:30am. The trek was much easier than yesterday, but then again any terrain would have been better. By 9:15 I made it into Dickey Gap, covering 9.3 miles, where a guy by the name of Fresh Ground was granting trail magic. I was offered coffee and when I accepted, he replied Dunkin’s or Starbucks? I replied, surprise me. I had small grilled link sausages, hash browns, and banana pancakes with real maple syrup. I learned through conversation with other hikers that I was not the only victim of being sucked onto the wrong trail a couple of days ago. Since then however, I have become vigilant at paying attention, especially at creek crossings.
As I prepared to leave and walk down the road to the Baptist Church Hostel to seek a ride back to Damascus, I met an elderly couple who offered to bring me to Marion which was probably the quickest route to Damascus. I accepted and when they dropped me off, I was 12 miles from Damascus. I began to walk and was picked up shortly after by a guy going fishing in Damascus. These are hiker towns and it’s common for local residents to pickup hikers, just like trail magic.


When I arrived back in Damascus, I ate then walked the mile or so to the Mountain Laurel Bed & Breakfast then to the grocery store to pick up some essentials of beer, potato chips, baby carrots and cookie dough.

It was absolutely delicious along with fruit, coffee and juice. She said she understands the caloric needs of a hiker and did this especially for me. After breakfast we set out to attend mass in a neighboring town. I enjoyed mass, especially the beautiful music provided by the choir and pianist.

The signs were there as after the 25 miles on Tuesday, I made myself eat dinner and had been feeling weak. The effects became very real, and lasted throughout the night. My original plan was to hike out this morning, but just didn’t have it in me. Rachael brought me a light breakfast to the the room which I was able to manage, as well as an antibiotic she secured to address my original illness. I then slept on and off until about 11:00 and recording another zero. Rachael then brought me to a small hotel, a stones throw from the trail, where I had hiked to the day before, and headed for the airport for her return flight home. Hopefully I’ll get some strength back as this dual illness, combined with Rachael’s departure and multiple zeros has been a real physical and mental curve ball.","

I awakened at about 8:00am, took stock of how I felt and although not hungry, ate a couple of cinnamon rolls that Rachael left with me. I then got myself together mentally and physically and hit the trail. About halfway to my destination and crossing a large pasture, I glanced up to see two buzzards circling. Not feeling well, I wondered for a minute if they were waiting on me. 
I made the 10 miles across the mountain where I reserved a room at the Halfway Hostel for tonight and Friday night, as there is a severe weather threat on Friday. Depending on the weather and my health, I may stay Saturday also, but I’ll keep my options open. 
When I got to the hostel, the owners were away, but the house was open. I used the bathroom and although the sign said to make yourself at home, I spent a couple of hours in a hammock swing under a majestic old sycamore tree.

I had to remove my shoes and use my crocs to ford one of the streams.Other than an occasional cough, I’m feeling really good and strong.

The moon made it appear like daylight last night until early morning when it became cloudy. While hiking, daybreak occurred and the clouds gave way to a crystal clear sky. The birds were singing as the woodpeckers’ work sounded like jackhammers throughout the forest. The trail was considerably dryer today which helps tremendously. 
At about 11:00, I crossed Laurel Creek and stepped on to a gravel road which is VA 615. An elderly gentleman there offered me breakfast on behalf of the Good News Church. After confirming that I wouldn’t be off the trail long, I accepted and he shuttled me about a mile to the church basement where I ate scrambled eggs, an egg & sausage casserole, breakfast sausage, a biscuit, fruit, a cup of coffee and 3 glasses of chocolate milk. The congregation has been doing this for hikers for 18 years. I was happy to be treated once again, but more so to have my appetite back. Within 30 minutes, I was shuttled back and on the trail. Later at about 2:00pm, I cleared the woods and walked down a gravel road which would eventually take me to a crossing over US-52 and I-77. When I reached the base of the road there was the Brushy Mountain Outpost. I stopped there and ate a cheeseburger, fries and a soft drink.

The last time I did this was my recovery at the Quarter Way Hostel.
When laying in bed last night, my tent was illuminated by the moon and the wind was blowing pretty hard. The wind is different in the mountains as you’ll get a big gust then hear nothing for a while until the next big gust. Early on in the adventure I would try to camp at lower elevations to limit my exposure to wind and cold. Now that the temperatures have moderated, I like the upper elevations as they provide the best views, and I often get cell tower service which allows me to call home and journal. The only issue is you have to mule water up there because there are no water sources up high. This happened yesterday as I stooped down below for water, then had a 1.7 mile climb to the ridge. I stopped twice for breaks and when moving, called cadence to my half empty can of Pringle’s rattling in my pack.

After I left and began walking the roadside on the way back to the trail, it hit me that I should have gotten an ice cream cone. High in calories and no trash to deal with. Maybe next time. It took a little time to get out of town, but eventually made it back into the mountains. 
It was a warm day getting up to about 75 degrees and I took it easy as I’m nursing an ankle issue on my right foot. It’s actually just above the ankle, but below the shin. This started yesterday as I think I may have landed awkwardly when crossing a rock field.
I made a couple of mistakes today, which drove home the need to pay attention. The first was realizing that the vacuum packed sliced ham I bought, which was unrefrigerated in the grocery isle, actually requires cooking. I ate one the other day on a tortilla and it was good or I was super hungry, but today at lunch i noticed it had the texture of raw bacon. This prompted me to read the package more carefully. I’ll have to figure my lunches out for a few days now, eating cashews, honey buns and snickers bars. 
My second mistake was passing a water source thinking that another was just ahead. As a result, I hiked 5 miles on empty. All a learning experience. 
When I did reach the Pine Branch Swamp Stream I drank two liters before filling my water bladder. I took time there to soak my right ankle. I also placed snickers bar in the stream to un-melt it. The 30 or so minutes there was well worth it. 
I then trekked another mile and a half to the Pine Branch Swamp Shelter. I was sitting there contemplating my next move when the sky opened up and it began to rain. Decision made, I’ll sleep in the shelter tonight. It is expected to rain throughout the night and day tomorrow. 
I little later another hiker came in and then another. Space in the shelter was divided up and we were listening to Young Gun tell his story about happening upon 2 bear cubs. He said they were near a downed tree and he said they looked like little black guinea pigs when mama bear stood up behind the tree. He said she took off running away and ran for about 50 yards before turning around and charging directly at him. He said he didn’t run but backed up some. The bear stopped about 25 feet from him and he continued to walk backwards as mama bear rounded up her cubs and moved on. He said he kept looking over his shoulder the whole way down the mountain. 
By dusk, I had eaten dinner, brushed my teeth, said my prayers and was massaging my ankle when movement caught my eye. It was a rat that ran across the shelter floor. I was debating if to say something when Young Gun, laying in the loft yelled as a mouse ran down a rafter over his head. I made the decision then that I was packing up and moving out. Apparently I helped others make their decision too as everyone started doing the same. As I packed and it got darker, the shelter came alive with rodents scurrying around, apparently unaffected by human activity. One guy found a tent site near the shelter, while Riggs, Young Gun and I started hiking. The rain had stopped by now, however the trees were still dripping. While walking and leading the trio, I ducked under a large downed tree, as did Ruggs, but apparently Young Gun didn’t see it and ran into it. I walked back to him as he was thrashing in the mud yelling “what the hell was that?” I told him it was a damn tree and if he couldn’t hike with the old dogs he’d have to stay on the porch. Young Gun was still a little moved by his bear witnessing, and I would be too!
We hiked for about two and a half hours and at 10:00pm found a side trail. There we pitched our tents on the trail and bedded down for the night camping near mile 658.6., and logging 21.7 miles. Young Gun persisted that he tent between Ruggs and I for the night.","Woods Hole Hostel

I used this opportunity to pack up and move out, hitting the trail at 5:00. I hiked up the mountain for two miles to the next shelter where I downed my gear, used the privy and ate breakfast. There was only one person sleeping in this shelter and I used this time to catch up on my journal as I listened to a jake turkey gobble in the distance at first light. 
I soon moved on and the rain persisted until about 12:30pm making the trail slick and sloppy. This is when I refer to the AT as the Appalachian Creek. As you ascend, rain water is running downhill over the tops of your shoes and when descending it’s not much better. My ankle was still bothering me so I paced myself accordingly and was careful not to fall. I soon came to a Gap where I met Super Dave cooking hotdogs and providing chips and soft drinks. Super Dave, who is a retired attorney and hiked the trail in 2002, approached me and said, “you’ve got a decision to make.” He went on to explain that the residents of New Port where feeding hikers beef stew until 1:00pm and if I wanted to go, we’d have to leave now. After a promise that he would bring me back to the trail, I agreed and we left. Super Dave left his ice chest and portable grill near the trail head commenting that hikers are resourceful and they’ll figure it out and feed themselves. The beef stew over noodles was good along with buttered bread, a soft drink and a cup cake. We soon returned to the trail under sunny skies and I set out on the trail again. 
By 2:30 it began to rain again and this later turned to sleet in the upper elevations. The wind was gusting to 50-60 miles an hour and although videos never illustrate actual conditions, I’ll post one.

While hiking a few minutes later I saw a headlamp coming towards me. We approached each other, bumped knuckles as us thru hikers do and introduced ourselves. This was my first encounter with Ninja Mouse, and together we found the turn on the trail and continued northbound together. I immediately noticed that I liked mouse’s pace. I later learned through conversation that he’s 67 years old, lost his wife last November and is a retired farmer from southern Iowa. His wife Brenda, who sounds like a incredible woman, was his partner on the farm and best friend as she enjoyed all the things that Mouse did including hiking, kayaking and biking.
Ninja Mouse is a country boy, I liked him and we hiked all day together, stopping occasionally to eat or for water. The weather warmed up to about 55 degrees and there was not a cloud in the sky. We stopped briefly to pay our respects at the Audie Murphy memorial, which was erected on the site where a plane crash ended his life. Audie Murphy was from Texas and is the most most highly decorated World War II soldiers. We eventually made it to Dragon’s Tooth then hiked into Catawba, VA, logging 24.4 miles and crossing mile 700 on the AT. We downed our gear at the Four Pines Hostel and shuttled a mile or so down the road to the Home Place Restaurant. We immediately noticed that we were underdressed as we walked in to have our named placed on the waiting list to be seated. We didn’t take time to shower or change clothes as we were anxious to get there knowing that it would be crowded as this was the only restaurant in the small town. My AT Guide book called the Home Place the best restaurant on The AT and I wasn’t about to miss out on the opportunity. Ninja Mouse and I sat on the rockers on the front porch of this grand building and engaged the locals in conversation. We soon became a novelty as people began to ask us about our experiences on the trail. Shortly after 8:00pm we were called in and seated. The only choices to make were your drink selection and whether you wanted two or three meats. The vegetable were coming whether you wanted them or not. Soon there was a platter of fried chicken, a platter of roast beef, a platter of country ham, a bowl of mashed potatoes with gravy, a bowl of corn, a bowl of snap beans, a bowl of pinto beans and a basket of biscuits sitting on out table. This was an all you can eat experience and the only thing we had seconds on was the fried chicken and corn. For dessert we had peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream and all for 19 dollars and the experience lived up to our expectations. When finished, we summoned the hostel shuttle driver and made it to the little town grocery store before their 10:00 closing time.

I arrived at 9:15 and the Super 8 hotel clerk offered breakfast while she ensured a room was available for an early checkin. I shared a room with Ninja Mouse and soon we were fed, showered and I took time to post my journal entries as I haven’t had service for a while. 
I then walked to the local outfitter to replace my shoes. These are the trail runners that I purchased in Hot Springs, NC. My left shoe had a blowout a week ago. After 455 miles, the shoes had also gotten small causing me to lose my second toe toenail on each foot and pinching my heel at the end of a day’s hiking. I settled on a similar version of trail runner shoe with high-tops and a thicker sole to soften the impact of the rocks on my feet. I also purchased stove fuel, a thinner belt as my original heavier web belt began to cut into my waist, and a couple of cans of permethrin. Prior to setting out, I treated all of my clothes with permethrin by mixing a concentrate in a bucket, submerging my clothes, wringing them out and then line drying them. I then sprayed my pack, tent and any other gear in hopes to head off any ticks. Now that I’m a third of the way on this journey, I’ll use the pre-mixed spray on my pack, socks and clothing as ticks and lime disease remain a real concern. 
I then visited the grocery store for my food resupply and then to the Three Little Pigs Restraunt for lunch where they offered a free banana pudding dessert for hikers, complete with real vanilla wafers. 
Upon my return to the Super 8, which is a very nice hotel, I settled in with a beer, microwave popcorn, television for the first time in 5 weeks and a small garbage bag of ice on my ankle. I’m dealing with what is obviously a high ankle sprain. The swelling is down and it feels better, but I’ll have to make a decision on whether to take a zero and spend another night, or check out and start hiking again.

Soon the noise of traffic was replaced by birds singing and the quiet solitude of the forest. I’ve experienced this transition several times now and it always brings a sense of calm to me. I said my prayers and soon afterwards was running full throttle, but heavy. 
I only saw two other thru hikers on the trail today as the number of hikers has definitely thinned. There were a handful of day hikers, and they’re easy to pick out because they smell so good. 
While hiking today I contemplated a question a friend asked during a phone conversation recently. He asked if I was still having fun? Without hesitation, I answered no, I’ve never had fun. This is undoubtably the toughest thing I’ve ever done. With that said, I would not trade this incredible experience for anything.

It was another warm morning and the sky was clear. This is one of the reasons I enjoy camping at higher elevations. First there’s the bright display of stars and then I take time to focus beyond the first tier to the millions of stars beyond. I’ll then spot satellites as they track across the sky. At times like this, falling stars seem to fall on the very next ridge line. The weather was in the mid 80’s yesterday and today promises the same.
At 7:00, I dropped down and crossed Virginia 614. There was a gentleman sitting in a truck who introduced himself as an employee of the Middle Creek Campground. He offered me a ride to the campground store to get something to eat. I had already eaten my breakfast regimen of a honey bun, protein bar and a cereal bar, but this was a bonus. Of course the usual questions applied such as how far away is it and will you bring me back? The campground was a mile away and he said we’d return when I’m ready. With that, I thought long and hard for about 5 seconds, then climbed into the back of the truck. Upon arrival, the lady running the place offered me breakfast. I didn’t want to disappoint her so I obliged and opted for the breakfast platter with 2 eggs, bacon, hash browns, two slices of toast, coffee and juice. When she handed me the plate she said that this should help because I have a lot of climbing to do today. I knew this, but learned not to dwell on it. This was the best $8.00 I spent since the last time I ate and it’s amazing how it props up my mental attitude for the remainder of the day.

When ready to leave, I donned my pack and did a 360 looking to see where the trail continued. There were two other trails that merged at this location, so I was careful to ensure that I was on the AT. I found a white blaze and headed out. I hiked for about forty-five minutes when I met a couple referred to as Better Together. When arriving late yesterday evening on the saddle of Marble Springs to camp, they were finishing up their camp chores and going to bed. Needless to say, my jaw dropped as I realized I had gotten turned around and headed back in the direction in which I started. The Better Together couple were so sympathetic and remarked that the same thing had happened to them earlier on the trail. I was aggravated at myself as the hour and a half round trip error cost me about 3-4 miles. While hiking back to the overlook, I told the Better Together couple that I wish I had an 8x10 photo of their faces when they noticed it was me going the wrong way and a 20x40 photo of myself when I realized I was hiking the wrong way.

I’d like to extend thanks to David Breaud for his research guestbook post regarding the photo of the unnatural bend on the tree limbs and the belief that this was done by Native Americans as a way to mark trails. I waited to mention this because I’ve been looking for the other version which I’ve seen in North Carolina, but have not seen since. I didn’t take a photo, but these two trees appeared to have had their limbs bound together at an early stage and now the mature tree limbs look similar to a head of broccoli. There didn’t appear to be any trauma to either tree and they looked alike, appearing highly unnatural. The 20 or so trees with large limbs that form an elbow were all on the side of the mountain along the trail, however the trees that I described resembling broccoli were both along ridge lines. It’s just interesting, that’s all. 
Secondly to my physical therapist, Mark Siegel for his advice with my ankle injury. While in Daleville I started a ice/heat regime.

Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612775,"Hit the trail this morning at 4:30 and headed to Rockfish Gap where Ax and I shared a shuttle into Waynesboro, VA. I paid a $10.00 “day use fee” at a Stanimal’s Hostel which enabled me to shower, do my laundry and charge my phone and battery charger. Ax and I then grabbed a quick bite to eat at a local coffee shop and accomplished a resupply. I finished my laundry when I returned and then packed up and headed out, with a stop at the highly acclaimed Ming’s all you can eat Chinese Buffet. A local Trail Angel then brought me and Ax to a local outfitter before heading back out to the trail. I purchased a pair of lightweight gaiters to keep sticks, leaves and dirt out of my shoes. With over 138 miles on my new shoes they are well broken in and unlike my previous pair of trail runners, the soles have soul which helps tremendously on the rock fields.
Upon arrival at the trailhead, I registered for my back country permit and entered the Shenandoah National Park. I will camp tonight near the Calf Mountain shelter, 6.4 miles into the Shenandoah’s and logging 12.7 miles for the day. By hiking into town and coming back out and continuing to hike, I’ve accomplished what’s referred to as a hero on the trail, as opposed to a nero when you remain in town.","Pause Wolfe Shelter Area

Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612992,"Headed out at 5:00 this morning for my first full day of hiking in the Shenandoah’s. Ax and I agreed on the departure time as she wanted to hike early, but is a bit uncertain about things or bears in the dark. I enjoyed the company, so compromised to leave a little later.


Ax is a competent, intelligent and independent person and like others I’ve enjoyed hiking with, she has common sense. Her boyfriend is also hiking the trail, but left later and is weeks behind. 


At about 7:00, we happened upon two bear cubs and a mama bear. The cubs were a little skittish and ran off while mama bear watched us walk by at a distance of about 25 feet. 


We continued on and had a great day of hiking, logging 26.2 miles and camping near the Pinefield shelter. The Shenandoah’s are like the Smokies in that you’re required to sleep in a shelter or camp nearby to one. Our other option would have been to camp near a shelter after only hiking 13 miles.


As I lay my head down to sleep tonight I’m anxious to visit with a friend who is flying up to visit tomorrow.","Calf Mountain

Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613006,"It began raining at about 9:00pm last night and rained intermittently throughout the night making for restless sleep. I eventually broke camp and headed out with Ax at 5:00am. Although the rain had stopped, the trees were dripping and the fog was thick, limiting visibility to about 10 feet. I was both anxious and excited as a buddy from home, Tim Becnel was flying in to visit and support me. Ax’s parents were coming in from Pittsburgh, so she was also anxious. We had several climbs, but this nor the weather seemed to dampen our spirits. We stopped briefly a couple of times, but were focused and there would be no stopping for scenery as we remained socked in by fog until noon. 


At about 12:10 we reached our destination of the Lewis Campground with 19.9 miles for the day. I treated myself to a Coke & Fritos while waiting for Tim to arrive. I met Ax’s parents when they arrived, and then bidding farewell, wishing her all the best on her goal to reach Mount Katahdin. We are uncertain if we will see each other again, but like others I have hiked with, there is a bond there now and an appreciation for one another having pushed each other for the last few days. 


Upon Tim’s arrival, we headed out about 8 miles to an Air B&B that he rented. The place is incredibly comfortable. After settling in and cleaning up, we headed out to accomplish my resupply. I also had to get a replacement pair of crocs (my camp shoes) that I left behind in the fog this morning. After dinner, we returned to the place for “Rachael & Rachel” cookies for dessert and late evening conversation to catch up. 


It was another great day on the trail, capped with a friend’s unwavering support and company.","Pinefield Shelter Area

Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613120,"Tim dropped me off at the Lewis Campground shortly after 6:00 this morning and I headed out traveling light with plans to do a 21 mile day. The overcast day soon gave way to sunny skies and a light breeze. There were plenty of views, but they were mostly overlooking town and villages in the distance. I was feeling good and at about midday was able to get a phone signal and called an audible. I now would have Tim pick me up Thornton Gap instead of the Pinnacle picnic area. As always, Tim was amenable and agreed to the new location and time. 


Shortly after 3:00 pm I walked off of the mountain and into the gap where Tim was waiting finishing the day with 26.3 miles. Having walked in the rain for a while, I placed my pack in the back and when I sat in the passenger seat, Tim handed me a double whopper cheeseburger with fries and a coke. I asked him how he knew I like Burger King and his reply was everyone likes Burger King. That’s Tim, thoughtful and no stone left unturned. On the way back to the rental property, we stopped so I could pick up a can of beets, which I had been craving for a couple of weeks. 


Upon our return, I cleaned up, did laundry and sprayed my clothes, pack and tent again with permethrin. I did this back in Daleville, but was not impressed with the product. I have been seeing ticks in the woods and wanted to take every precaution. Tim prepared and cooked dinner. We had baked potatoes, Texas toast and of course my beets to go along with the 20oz. steaks he grilled. It was amazing!


I failed to mention in a previous journal entry about the other night at about 10:00pm while sleeping, a bird began to sing. This went from that’s kind of cool to I wish I had my sling shot. My sister-in-law Mary told me about the whip-poor-will, but this was my first experience. The bird would not shut up. Anyway my eastern whip-poor-will sang for the next several hours. Thank goodness for ear plugs. I’ve posted a short video with the audio in case you want to listen to it when you go to bed.","Lewis Campground

Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613207,"I woke up this morning and checked the weather radar and as a result just wasn’t feeling it. There was rain all around us and more building to the west. Tim and I left the rental property this morning so that we’d be at the McDonalds in Luray, VA at their opening time of 5:30. Apparently they operate on “island time” because there were people inside, but no indication that it would be soon. We then crossed the street where I got a cup of coffee and a microwaveable biscuit.


It rained most of the way back to the trail and it was now drizzling with a 100% chance of rain predicted for the day. Shortly after 6:00, we arrived back at Thornton Gap. I went into the restroom and on the way out, looked in the mirror and told myself to get it together, there’s a trail that needs walking. Besides being down about the rain, I was a little saddened to see Tim leave. We had a great visit and the last two days were simply incredible. I gave Tim a hug and thanked him for everything. His visit was timely and provided a huge mental boost. I then headed out onto the trail, stopping briefly to look back as he took a photo, while thinking it’s kind of ironic that he’s leaving exactly two months to the day I began this adventure.


Soon the drizzle stopped and the morning went well. At about 9:30, I approached and decided to go into the Elkwallow Wayside camp store for breakfast. This was another Duane vs. Tank decision and Tank won again. There are several waysides or pathways throughout the Shenandoah’s to access resorts or camp stores. These stores have an assortment of items and usually a short order grill. I ate a huge breakfast and had a couple of blackberry milkshakes along with some Rachael & Rachel cookies that I took with me. I’m a believer that everything happens for a reason, and I’m glad the McDonalds was not open. If it was, I would not have had my breakfast experience. When finished I pressed on as I had an ambitious distance goal. This would set me up for a zero on Sunday, while taking refuge from predicted heavy rain. 


At about 3:00pm, I stopped for lunch next to a creek, and yep, had cookies for dessert. A couple of hours later, I out-processed my back country Shenandoah National Park permit at the north park entrance kiosk. I entered the SNP on Tuesday, and now five days later was leaving the 103.2 miles of the AT that the park encompasses. 


I ended my day stopping at the Mountain Home, however there was no vacancy. The owners there shuttled me to the Front Royal Terrapin Station Hostel where I’ll spend the night. I plan to go into Front Royal tomorrow and rent a hotel room where I’ll be close to amenities. I have reached mile 971.8, and accomplished 28 miles of hiking for the day.","Thornton Gap

Later in the day, and after lunch, I called Rachael. She cooked at Dad’s house today where all of the kids gathered for Mother’s Day and to celebrate my Granddaughter Caroline’s first birthday. I then headed to the local outfitter to replace the tips on my Leki trekking poles and get a replacement small compass. My small button compass quit working after the 16 degree day some time ago. 

The rain continues here with predictions to continue until Tuesday. But then again, it was supposed to rain most of the day when Tim returned me to the trail on Saturday. I’m still finding encouraging and supportive remnants of his visit. Similar to a previous visit with two other friends, it’s hard to relate Tim and the word Angel in the same sentence, but that’s how I feel and what I did. I told him that he doesn’t comprehend the value of his visit and the mental boost it provided. Rachael asked him to fatten me up, and I’ll vouch that he did his very best.
With 50 miles or so to Harpers Ferry West Virginia, I plan to hike out in the morning and as always excited to see what I’ll experience and where the trail will take me.","

Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613507,"Got up at 5:00 this morning, brought my pack to the lobby, then headed across the street to the Dunkin Donuts and got 4 donuts, a pint of chocolate milk and a cup of coffee. I then went back to the hotel lobby and ate. When I finished, I “cameled up” by drinking an additional 20 ounces of water. I knew the weather would be bad today and wanted to reduce the need to stop. Remaining in town was not an option. I had earned and enjoyed the zero, but it was time to move on and I was focused. 



The shuttle driver arrived at 6:00 as discussed and Ruggs and I were off back to the trail. I noticed that Ruggs still had his breakfast on his lap, and when we pulled up to his drop off point, he said “man I haven’t eaten my breakfast.” Ruggs then got out of the car and the driver continued another 3 tenths of a mile to my drop off point. The trail runs parallel to VA 522 and I had stopped further down the day before. I got out, grabbed my gear, stretched and headed up the trail. Soon after starting, the rain started. I chuckled as I envisioned Ruggs standing there in the rain eating breakfast and drinking coffee. I thought to myself, not my circus, not my monkey. I shared this philosophy with him last night when he was talking about something that didn’t concern me. Simply put, if it’s not my business, I unplug mentally and physically from a particular situation. Life is simpler that way. Ruggs seems to be on his heels a lot and that’s his business, unless we’re going somewhere together. These are not disparaging comments about Ruggs, just an illustration of how different we all are and how difficult it can be to maintain a hiking partner.
Despite the never ending rain, my hike was going well. It remained a constant 50 degrees and the best rain gear available would not defeat this driving rain. As the day wore on, my hands began to get cold. At about 11:45, I detoured 3 tenths into a shelter to eat lunch. I contemplated cooking something, but I lost dexterity in my fingers and settled for a pepperoni on tortilla sandwich. Even with this, I had issues opening the zip-loc bag. 


After lunch I trudged on and the rainfall remained heavy. The rain water was flowing steadily down the trail. The rocks that I would normally use to hop from rock to rock when crossing a stream were covered by raging water. As a result, I just walked through the streams. There were also several low spots on trail that my feet would sink to my ankles in the mud.


At about 6:30pm, the rain stopped. Every tent site I found was either holding water or so sloppy I didn’t care to deal with it. I made the decision to hike to the Bear’s Den Hostel miles further up the trail. Shortly after, it began raining again and this reaffirmed my decision. When I arrived at the hostel at 8:30pm, I took my shoes off and did my best to wipe my legs down as they were covered in mud up to my knees. The one positive about my day long soaked feet is later that night I was able to pull off a couple of toenails that needed to go. 


My $30 dollar hostel stay included a bunk, shower, laundry, a large pizza, soft drink and a pint of ice cream. I showered, and started the laundry while my pizza was in the oven and eventually ate and called it a night.


My day included 14 hours of hiking totaling 33.2 miles and I crossed the 1000 mile mark. Partly because when it’s raining so much there’s no place to stop and take a break. The last several miles I entered what’s referred to as the roller coaster. This is a series of strenuous mountain climbs and steep descends over about 10 miles. As tough as it was it was positive mileage towards my ultimate goal. 


Many have reached out to me regarding the senseless act of violence that took place on the trail last week and I thank you. Although brutal and very sad, it’s a reminder that evil lurks in every corner of society. I believe that Tennessee did what they could on his initial arrest, but with a trail name of Sovereign and carrying a machete it’s pretty indicative of his mental state.","Front Royal

Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613509,"At about midnight last night I felt a sharp pain in my back. Apparently the end of a spring had poked through the sheets. I wrestled the mattress off of the rack and replaced it with the one off of the top bunk. I then threw the bad mattress on the top bunk. I can only imagine what my fellow hostel guest were thinking. I used this up time to place the laundry in the dryer so everything would be ready in the morning. 


At 4:00am and like clockwork I awakened. I packed up, headed upstairs and started the coffee. I then cooked and ate 6 pancakes to go with the coffee. For dessert I finished of my pint of ice cream. 


At about 5:30 I hit the blue blaze trail out of the hostel to the AT trail and started northbound. In 4.7 miles, I finished up the roller coaster. I continue to see lots of deer and they appear to be healthier now that spring has sprung. 



There was much anticipation for today. I eventually left Virginia and entered West Virginia. There is something referred to as the Virginia Blues because it’s holds the most mileage of any state on the Appalachian Trail at 556 miles. I originally entered Virginia on April 10th, and today I bid it farewell with a good mental outlook and good health.
Upon arrival at Harpers Ferry, WV, I walked to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy office and checked in as a northbound thru hiker. I originally started this trek as number 800 on March 11 and was photographed as number 183 coming through. Harpers Ferry is referred to as the spiritual halfway point as it’s the closest town to the actual halfway mark. 
While at the AT  office, a Trail Angel named Vicki, who introduced herself to me through my journal, met me there with Turkey Cubanelle chili, a large turkey sandwich and a drink. We visited, then walked the half mile or so that the AT encompasses in town. She dropped me off at the hostel, and encouraged me to keep on, stating “you’ve got this.”


I completed the day on an emotional high with 20.5 miles and sleeping tonight at the Mountain House hostel in Harpers Ferry. I completed a road test on the mattress and there are no spring issues to speak of here. In the morning I will hike out and after a few tenths of a mile introduce myself to the state of Maryland.","Bear’s Den Hostel

Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613577,"I hung around the hostel until 6:00 this morning to eat breakfast. I was short a lunch, so I asked the short order cook to make me a sandwich for the trail. When I finished eating, I headed out. 


As I walked down the street I looked down the hill and saw people buzzing around to catch the Maryland Area Regional Commuter (MARC) train into DC. They all moved about as they were each in their own individual bubble with no one appearing to acknowledge anyone else on the platform. I watched for a moment then moved on as it seemed to make me anxious. 


Soon after, I crossed the Potomac River leaving West Virginia and entering the State of Maryland. I rejoined the trail in the woods and not long after crossed underneath an interstate. The roar caused by traffic, which at one time I was quite used to, was deafening and I couldn’t wait to move further into the mountains. Soon the noise of the interstate was gone and all that remained was the sound of occasional jet coming into or leaving the DC airports. This too dissipated over time and I was back to the tranquillity of the forest with deer running about and birds singing. I thought to myself that I’ve only been out here for two months and this is how these things affected me. I wondered how I was going to re-acclimate  when I finished this adventure. The answer was, there’s plenty time before I have to figure that out. 

The weather was absolutely gorgeous today with a low of 40 and a high of about 60. I believe the heavy rains of a couple days ago made it that much more beautiful. The trail was still muddy in places, however this was no issue and I intended to make the most of my day.
I trekked across many civil war battle sites today and couldn’t help but think about the many lives lost on the battlefield. I stood on rock overlooks and envisioned kids as soldiers moving across the field of battle an much of the terrain remains as it was back then. I also trekked through Gathland State Park today, and later Dahlgren State Park where I took the opportunity to eat lunch. If timing had worked out they would have been great places to camp.


I completed the day with 26.1 miles and will be camping near mile 1051.6.","Harpers Ferry

Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613678,"Woke up this morning to rain pelting my tent. At about 4:15 it let up and I took the opportunity to pack up. I hit the trail with much anticipation as today promised to be another exciting day. The rain continued on and off until about 7:30 and was more a nuisance than anything. It would stop long enough for me to remove my rain jacket and kilts then start up again. 



The trail in Maryland was great with the exception of a few rock fields and boggy sections. The elevation ascends and descends were challenging but fair.
At 1120 eastern time, I crossed the Mason Dixon line and officially entered Pennsylvania, another high mileage state with 229 miles, and in comparison to Virginia, it’s not that intimidating. 


Pennsylvania is well known for the abundance of rocks. When in Harpers Ferry, I purchased a pair of super feet insoles. With a couple of days of use they appear to be helping with mitigating the rock exposure to my feet. I also purchased a pair of dirty girls. These are gaiters similar to the pair I got a couple hundred miles ago, but they kept sliding up the heel in the extreme mud. The dirty girls anchor to the heel with Velcro, and they have also performed well. 


When I reached PA 16, I began to walk the two miles into Waynesboro for my resupply. Although I attempted to hitch hike, no one picked me up and I had to walk the distance. In reality, I don’t know if I would pick myself up given my looks. While in town I ate then went to the Walmart to resupply. I had everything needed and was in the produce department when a gentleman circled me, then came back for another look. He asked if I was a thru hiker and I replied yes. I guess my pack and trekking poles in the basket, combined with my looks and body odor gave it away. After talking for a bit, he offered me a ride back to the trail. I waited by the door until he finished his shopping and then we were off. Turns out, Joe spent a lot of time in Louisiana as H&E was an equipment distributor for his former employer.  I was going to look for a place to shower and do laundry, but I wasn’t going to let my ride back to the trail get away from me. 


Once back on the trail I had a spring in my step after checking off another state and pressing on. Later in the afternoon, I detoured to the Chimney Rock Overlook. Unlike March and April, I am now walking in a forest that has found spring and the foliage is so dense there aren’t many views.


Eventually I made it to Snowy Mountain road and walked to the South Mountain Hotel. I read where they had a hiker shower at the bar. When I arrived, I drank a beer and went outside to shower while my hamburger was being cooked. The shower was a simple three sided cinder block construction with no roof, door or shower curtain. As good as it felt, I hurried because I was exposed. I then washed my shirt and a pair of underwear while showering. When I returned inside, my hamburger was ready and I had another beer. This was a celebration of entering Pennsylvania, accomplishing a resupply, getting a shower and doing my laundry all in the same day while achieving good mileage. A guy at the bar gave me a ride back to the trail and my clothes are hanging in the tree. If they aren’t dry by the morning, I’ll just hang them on the back of my pack.

Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613789,"I collected my laundry from the tree this morning and packed up. It was somewhat cooler than other recent mornings and the humidity was lower because my clothes were dry and I packed away a dry tent. 


I headed out at about 4:20, but although I was early I knew I had a couple of stops to make. One was for water and the other to get breakfast out of my bear bag as I had not preloaded it in my belt pouches as I normally do.


I haven’t been as hungry in the morning as I’ve changed my evening meal to a Knorr pasta or rice side. When it comes to a boil, I put a large pack of pink salmon in it, turn the heat off and stir it occasionally while it sits for about ten minutes. I’m sure it would taste better with the two tablespoons of margarine, but it’s filling and better than Ramen and instant potatoes. 



The trail was mixed today with a few boulders to climb over and slide down the other side, boggy areas, rocks embedded in the soil and protruding upward and smooth and lined with pine needles making it feel like carpet. I continue to trek the distance that trail terrain, weather and my body allows. It good to have my head, heart, lungs, and legs all working in unison again. I thank God for this daily through prayer and conversation.At about 1130, I stopped at mile 1096 to eat lunch. The significance of this mile marker is this is exactly the halfway mark for thru hikers headed to Maine from Georgia. There was no balloon drop or confetti, just me, my tuna on tortilla, my can of Pringle’s, bottle of water and Hershey bar. Oh, and a whole lot of peace and quiet. 


At about 3:00pm I trekked into the Pine Grove Furnace State Park. The Appalachian Trail Museum is close by so I visited. I then went to the park’s camp store where I charged my electronics and ate. This was the first time today that I saw another thru hiker. When finished I hiked out to the edge of the park, used the shower next to the swimming hole and moved on.

I began hiking and stopped just a few tenths up the trail to camel-up and fill my water bladder. I then ate while walking the trail. At daylight, I took a short experimental video clip while walking the trail. The trail conditions were good which allowed me to try this without the use of one of my trekking poles. It’s posted in the video section  


I trekked on and made it to the Green Mountain General Store where I had a second breakfast. While there I had service and received a message from Ben stating that he was closing in on me. I left the store and as I approached the trailhead, Ben stepped out onto the highway. Ben is the guy from South Georgia who I hiked with previously. We separated somewhere just north of Damascus, VA when I went back to meet Rachael during her visit back on April 13th. 


We hiked the day together while catching up to include an occasional laugh regarding things that have happened on the trail. We also counseled each other on the tough days we’ve had, such as the extreme rainy weather day that we all endured. 


After ascending this morning, the trail flattened out somewhat with a mix of rocks and roots. We later trekked through the little town of Boiling Springs, PA and then skirted farmland while walking through tunnels of aromatic honey suckle vines.


At about 6:00pm we reached our destination of Carlisle, PA where we are sharing a room. The day encompassed 26.8 miles.

It was 4:30 and I was preparing for another day of hiking. Although I may have dreaded the conditions, I have not once dreaded the task at hand. I chose to wait until 6:30 to eat breakfast before heading out. The shower and air conditioning was well worth my share of $30.00. Hikers are liked in these small towns as we contribute to the revenue stream.



The day’s trek was still, warm and humid, but there was a particular tranquility to the forest having rained last night. The trail was extremely rocky with a few substantial climbs, but it was a good day. Nothing on the trail seems to bother me anymore. It’s just another day of hiking towards the ultimate goal. I took another short video clip of the trail, but will not be able to video the true challenges because I use my trekking pole as the camera mount and I need both poles when ascending and descending.
Ben and I reached our goal and made it to Duncannon, PA at about 2:00 pm where the trail runs through the center of town. We’ll room at the Doyle Hotel. We ate a good meal and drank a couple of beers before checking into our room upstairs. I started the laundry and then we caught a ride into town to accomplish our resupply. 

The place is extremely old and I’m pretty sure Ben Cartwright and Little Joe of television program Bonanza roomed here when traveling on business. There is no air conditioning in the rooms and ordinarily that would matter, but as I watch the rain fall outside, it’s all okay.

We didn’t have many lodging options and with severe weather predicted it was a matter of necessity. The box fan in the window made a steady hum and it was so reminiscent of post hurricane conditions. I eventually dozed off and at about 10:00 the room was lit up by lightning. Sleeping on and off until the brunt of the storm hit at about 1:00am with really close lightning and thunder that seemed to shake the old three story building. Ben had to close the window to prevent the rain from coming through onto his bed. Shortly after, the town’s siren went off. Ben and I had a brief discussion and agreed that if it kept blowing then it’s probably a tornado warning and if it went off it’s probably to alert the town fire brigade. The siren wailed for about 20 seconds then went silent. The thunder remained into the early morning hours. I told Ben that although I planned to hike out at 4:30, I would wait and eat breakfast across the street at 6:00 then head out. I did this for a couple of reasons in that I wasn’t sure what affect the weather had on the trail and sleep was a key ingredient to a successful hiking day, and neither of us got much. Besides, breakfast always helps. 


I got up at 5:00 and began packing. It’s refreshing to dress in clean clothes. I then studied my AWOL AT guide to determine potential target points. Soon Ben and I were eating breakfast and I told him that we need to bust out of this town. He asked what was the hurry? I said if the town folks realized there were two able body men at the inn that didn’t respond to the town emergency they would run us out on a rail. I’d rather leave town on my own accord.:)


We walked the couple miles through town and crossed the Susquehanna River and soon entered the forest and began to ascend. My concerns were validated as there were several trees along the trail that had been blown down as a result of the storm. Each one had to be climbed through or detoured around which made for tedious and time consuming hiking. Later there were lots of rocks and occasional boulders to climb over. I would frequently drop my trekking poles on the other side of the boulders and retrieve them after reaching the other side. It was also extremely warm getting up to 78 degrees which exasperated the issue.


Soon Ben needed water so we exchanged good-byes as we are uncertain when or if we’ll meet again. He then detoured off the trail to a water source and I trekked on. 



The other issue with the heat is that it brought the snakes out. There were several harmless snakes that slithered across the trail in front of me and a couple others that just laid there. Now on high alert, I began pole vaulting with my trekking poles over vines or sticks that looked like snake, stick snakes.Despite all of the challenges, I finished the day with 29 miles and am tenting near Rausch Gap Shelter at mile 1178.","Duncannon, PA

I was leaving a little later this morning at 5:00 as I knew there was a detour ahead due to flooding caused by beavers. I was uncertain how well the detour was marked, but wanted it to be close to daybreak so I could navigate the trail. The 1.6 mile detour, not in my favor, took me down a fire service road and the straight up the mountain. Once again I was not bothered as it’s all in a day’s hike, along as I’m moving northbound. 


Later in the morning I crossed mile 1192. The significance of this is with the 2019 Appalachian Trail being 2192 miles, I am now one thousand miles from Mount Katahdin in Maine. There are minor variances in trail mileage from year to year due to controlled burns, erosion or other factors. 


I took another brief video of the rocks on the trail, but in all fairness this is not the only terrain I’m trekking. There are stretches of rock, boggy sections caused by ground springs and other sections that are similar to a driveway, except for the elevation changes. 


I completed the day trekking 28.1 miles and stealth camping near the Black Swatara Spring.","Rausch Gap

The morning was exceptionally beautiful with temperatures in the mid forties, a clear sky and moonlight shining through the tree canopy. The shadows cast down onto the forest floor and glistening on the flowing streams brought a sense of inner peace. Eventually the moonlight was replaced by daybreak as though the two were changing shifts.


Eventually the sun peaked through just as I was walking east and could feel the warmth on my face. The morning just kept getting better as a deer trotted ahead of me and then stopped just off of the trail in the fern covered forest, continuously looking back to ensure that I wasn’t a threat. 


I detoured into the small town of Port Clinton to visit the popular Frank’s Barbershop. When I walked in the owner which was cutting a customer’s hair, placed his clippers on the shelf and took a few steps towards me, shook my hand and introduced himself. He then offered me coffee and cookies as I waited my turn. This was an old fashioned style barbershop where the haircut is free, but the bull costs $8.00. The kind of place I experienced as a kid.There were all sorts of relics and memorabilia laying around, as well as a guitar that a fellow hiker picked up, sat on a stool and began to play and sing. As a matter of normal routine, I shaved my head and face for years prior and again before setting out on this journey, however the last time I sat in a barber chair was the early 1990’s. It was time though as my facial hair began to interfere with my eating habits. 


I then hiked the few miles over to the neighboring town of Hamburg and checked into the Microtel hotel. On the way down the mountain, I sent Ben a message as we had separated on Monday and we were going to split a room. Ben was now about 5 miles behind me.

I also surprised my Godfather Bebe’ Scioneaux with a phone call. He’s the one who gave me the nickname Tank when I was a kid and hearing it always brings back fond memories of him and my dad.

The sky was clear and the temperature was in the low 50’s with a slight breeze. 


Today’s trek was a difficult one as I move further into northern Pennsylvania. This makes for a very long and monotonous day as hiking across the rocks and boulders is slow going. It’s both physically and mentally demanding, requiring your full attention to each step and follow up steps to ensure foot placement and balance. There is no looking away, as doing so could result in an injury.

The trail was nice and soon this changed to more of the north Pennsylvania standard of rocks and boulders. I hate to sound like a broken record, but I’m looking forward to saying goodbye to Rocksylvania. Two of the more notable climbs and rock features I traversed today were Knife Edge and Bear Rocks. In addition to their difficulty, a fall would be catastrophic. I’m thankful that I’m not afraid of heights because that would add a whole mother dimension.


Ben and I leapfrogged each other earlier when I was eating and I passed him later while he was eating. He later caught up to me and told me that he was done and I concurred. It was hot now and adding to the challenge was carrying enough water to make it through a superfund site of appropriately twenty miles where collecting water is highly discouraged.


Ben found the place of John Stempa in the AWOL Guide. He runs a shuttle service and allows hikers to shower, sleep in his garage and will shuttle them into the small town of Kunkletown for dinner. The decision was made and soon we were picked up at a trailhead a half mile away. 


I intended to make the leap to the Delaware Water Gap without another town visit, but this was a matter of necessity which would allow me to hit the mental reset button. The soles on my shoes are torn and they needed attention so they wouldn’t come completely apart before I receive the new pair which I recently ordered. 


After a shower, we went to the Kunkletown Pub for dinner and then to the general store for ice cream. Soon after, we were shuttled back to the garage for the most important part, sleep.

I would have liked to leave earlier, but was at the mercy of the shuttle provider. When we did get to the trail it was nearly 8:00am. The weather was warm and humid making the rocks wet and slippery. By midday the sun had dried things up but it was still warm. 



The trail was more of the same. I did get to see my first rattlesnake. He was big with about 8-9 rattles, but not extremely big. As I approached, it was slithering under a boulder and I watched as the last 18 inches disappeared. I could see him coiled up from the other side of the boulder, but it was too difficult to get a photo. There’s no telling how many rattlesnakes I’ve walked over as they nestled under the boulders. The sighting did make me more concerned when I stepped blindly and my foot landed on the other side of large rocks.

I trekked the 6.1 miles into the town of Delaware Water Gap, which was still sleeping. While sitting on some outdoor furniture of a local business studying the layout of the town Ben walked up. We downed our gear at the Presbyterian Church of the Mountains Hostel, then headed to the local bakery for breakfast.


Upon my return, I took a shower and did my laundry outdoors in a bucket. I opted for this in lieu of a walk to the local hotel which permits hikers to use their coin laundry machine. 


After lunch, I hung my tent & footprint to dry. I also aired out my sleeping bag as it got damp due to condensation overnight. All required maintenance when sleeping in rain. I also sprayed my clothing again with permethrin because ticks are very active now.

Before long, I was crossing the Delaware River on I-80 and entering the state of New Jersey. Although there were rocks, the trail was different in that there was actually places between the rocks to place your foot while hiking.

Ben and I hiked 17.9 miles to the High Point State Park Headquarters in Port Jeeves, New York where we met the owner of the Mosley Place Hostel.

I enjoyed Ms. Mosey’s excellent breakfast and she dropped Ben and I off at the trail for 7:30. The time was agreed upon as we were in no hurry. The plan was to hike a short day as another round of thunderstorms was predicted for the afternoon.
The morning was warm and still, but I had a better mindset with a good breakfast, dryer shoes, and the promise of something other than trail food for lunch. Even the mud on the trail caused by yesterday and last night’s rain storms didn’t dampen my spirits. We hiked 8 miles and into the town of Unionville, NY where we enjoyed lunch at the general store. Afterwards, we trekked on another 5 miles to the Pochuck Mountain Shelter where we claimed a spot in the shelter. I’d rather not cut the day short or stay at a shelter, but just like my former professional life, I made the best decisions based on the information I have.
Ben and I were discussing how our sense of smell seemed to be more acute. We joked about enjoying the smell of a day hiker and how I liked them because they were very giving of their food as they always packed too much. Later while walking down the trail, I stopped and looked back at Ben and at the same time we said “do you smell that?” I said it smells like an orange and Ben said it smells like citronella. We trekked on and soon came upon a section hiker also headed northbound. We talked for a minute and then I leaned towards the gentleman. I openly said, it’s him, then explained to the gentleman what I was talking about. The hiker was wearing citronella oil as a bug deterrent.

Ben and I headed out from the shelter shortly before 5:00am this morning in anticipation of stopping for breakfast a couple of tenths off the trail from a highway crossing and 6 miles later. As we approached the Pochuck Valley Farms Market and Deli it was obvious they were closed, contrary to information provided in the AT Guide. If I were a child I would have thrown a temper tantrum. As an adult, I didn’t handle it much better as the anticipation started yesterday evening and built to a monumental letdown. Needless to say I sucked it up and pulled my usual breakfast consisting of protein bars and honey buns from my pack and hiked on. 



The air was dryer, but it was another warm day with mud to traverse on the trail as a result of all the rain last night. Similar to yesterday, we crossed large swampy areas with some having boardwalks over them. Others required you to hop from log to log or rock to rock, often getting my feet wet and muddy in the process.
Eventually we crossed mile 1367 and entered the state of New York, leaving New Jersey for the final time. At this time we hiked on top of boulders on the ridge line while frequently having to climb up or down between a sequence of boulders. 


Upon crossing NY 17 we walked a couple of tenths to the Bellvale Farms Creamery where Ben & I celebrated entering New York. I got a large strawberry milkshake and a cup of ice cream. While waiting, I had a root beer. When I finished, I went back in to get an ice cream cone for the trail. It was all really good and we hiked another 2 miles to a campsite.

Trekking was very different and difficult today as opposed to other days recently. Apparently we were hiking across mountain ridges. The sequence was actually quite simple in that you summit a ridge line then down into the valley then summit a ridge line. This was the all day and extremely strenuous, however never boring. Although there are rocks, it’s manageable and the terrain and views are beautiful. 
A main goal of today’s trek was to hike beyond the Fingerboard Shelter due to a problem bear. A day ago, the bear entered a tent during daylight in the afternoon and took a hiker’s pack. The bear then ripped the pack open and ran off with the food bag. No one anticipates this behavior during daylight hours and there are warnings posted.

As a result, Ben and I hiked 12.5 miles over a few mountain ridges to an intersection near Peekskill, NY. There Chuck Casabianca picked us up at about noon and brought us to his home in Putnam Valley. Chuck and his wife Karen opened their downstairs apartment for our use. After showering and starting a load of laundry, they fed us rice, sausage, steak, ham and salad. Afterwards they ferried us to the local Walmart to resupply.

I have been extremely careful about protecting the mattress from punctures, so I don’t believe that’s the issue. It’s a priority so I’ll have to figure it out. 


Once on the trail, Connecticut wasted no time in welcoming me. There were several 1000-1200 foot brutal ascends with punishing descents back down to 300 feet. I had gotten off trail and found my way back when I happened upon Ben who was just recovering from a similar mistake. We were hiking apart as he left later than I did this morning. We were both somewhat frustrated both by our mistakes as well as Connecticut’s strenuous welcome. 


We hiked for about four hours with either of us speaking a word, but that’s not uncommon especially during periods of heavy physical exertion. Ben apparently checked his phone and saw that he had a message from a former supervisor stating that she was traveling with her family and were in Kent, Connecticut. Long story short, a phone call was made and a few tenths later at the next road crossing we were met and given a large breakfast sandwich, a coke and a chocolate chip cookie. It was a gift that couldn’t have come at a better time. All I could think was that God provides, and today he provided an egg sandwich. Had I not gotten off the trail, I may have only seen Ben when eating lunch or not at all. Instances such as these support my belief that things happen for a reason.

Yesterday’s 27 miles set me up for the 7.8 mile trek into the town of Dalton, MA. I didn’t intend to hike 27 miles, but once again designated camping sites are either too close or too far apart. When stealth camping you take what you can find and that ranges from “perfect” to “it’ll work.” 


While hiking I began to reflect on a phone call with a friend while I was in Great Barrington. We were discussing the weather and I shared that although it was warm, the humidity was low and it was pleasant. He went on to say that he thought I would be walking since the weather was good. He’s got a point, but after a 4.5 day, high mileage hitch in the mountains, my body needs attention and rest. Regardless of the method, if any, I choose to use to clean up at night, the sweat and stench from strenuous ascends stays with me and becomes accumulative and somewhat unbearable. There’s also only a certain amount of punishment you can sustain, and bruised feet need time to heal. 


When I dropped down into Dalton, there was another hiker walking down the street. He shared that he was a flip-flopper and that he started in Harpers Ferry. Flip-flopper is a term used when starting somewhere on the trail, reaching Maine and then traveling back to trek the southern part. It seems anticlimactic to me as it would be hard to celebrate at Mount Katahdin knowing you still have 1000+ miles to complete, but to each his own. He began to walk with me and asked how long I’d been on the trail. I told him since Amicalola Falls on March 11th. We talked momentarily and he said “I guess I’ll see how far I can go.” That is something you’ll never here a thru-hiker say, especially at this stage of the journey as most are focused, disciplined and committed. You have to be to make it this far. I’ve seen several flip-floppers lately and they’re easy to pick out by either looks or demeanor. I see very few thru-hikers. At some point in our brief conversation he said that I looked weathered. Soon he veered off and was gone. I was a bit taken back and thought about it for a while, but I guess he may be right. My shoes are in bad shape with the sole on my right shoe coming apart. My hat is white from the salt of my sweat. Mud is slung onto the inside of my calves and poison ivy welts are visible on parts of my lower legs. Unlike mosquitos which drink from a straw, my upper arms have festered bites from flies that chew, along with some poison ivy on my arms also. My beard has become unkept again since my haircut back in Port Clinton and lastly, I’m as dark as I would be back home now from mowing grass, fishing or working on the farm. So I guess weathered may be appropriate. 


I made it to the Dalton Restaurant where I enjoyed a huge breakfast, complete with real maple syrup on my pancakes. Afterwards, I hiked over the mountain to the town of Cheshire where I’ll camp near a church field to prepare for a night of heavy rain and weather, as there are no hostels or hotels here. I hiked a total of 16.5 miles today.

Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616158,"Woke up this morning at 5:30. The rain began at about 7:30 last night and did not end until about 6:30 this morning. My tent performed well, but it was so humid that everything was damp and sticky. I laid there and studied my AT guide as I ate the Dunkin donuts that I bought last night. 


When the rain stopped, I packed up everything and placed it under an awning near the church. I then walked back to the Dunkin Donuts store to use the restroom and get a cup of coffee. The walk was about a mile each way, but without a pack it seems effortless. 


When I returned, the chapel was open and I went in to say my prayers prior to morning Mass. I attended Mass in remembrance of my brother in law, Eugene Leblanc Jr., who died a year ago tomorrow. Eugene was adventurous and I recalled the times we’d go duck hunting and camping. We had a lot in common and Eugene was the perfect brother in law. 


I left town at about 8:45 and with last night’s rain, the trail was wet and muddy. I did a lot of rock and root hopping trying to keep my feet dry. In several places water was running down the trail like a creek. The effort to stay dry didn’t last long and eventually my shoes were wet once again. Prior to noon, I summited Mount Greylock. At over 4100 feet, this is Massachusetts’ highest elevation, unfortunately the weather had not cleared yet and there was little to no view. About an hour later and on the descent, the clouds cleared and the sun emerged. That’s just how it goes sometimes.


Today marks 3 months or 93 days of this great adventure. Of the 93 days, I’ve hiked a total of 82 days. I’ve logged zeros on the remaining 11 days. My first day of 8.8 up the approach trail to Springer Mountain doesn’t count, just the 2 tenths I actually did on the trail that evening. Just like the tenths here or there to camp sites, to get water, miles walking into towns or miles walking in the wrong direction.:(


I’ve commanded this trek with an  aggressive pace and a common sense approach. With 591 miles remaining, I plan to push for another week or so which will provide a cushion in the event of sickness or injury. For logistical and personal reasons, I’m planning to reach Mount Katahdin by the end of July. This is the first time I’ve mentioned Mount Katahdin to myself or anyone else. It’s one of those “don’t look over there kind of things.” Over the last month and a half, I’ve been trekking through heavy foliage and the only views have been on ledges or over watches. This will afford me the option to not hike in the rain, zero when I want to, and the opportunity to take more time in the states of Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine where the views will improve, especially when hiking above the tree line.


This evening, I departed Massachusetts and entered the state of Vermont. Not long after, I crossed the 1600 mile mark after trekking a total of 21.5 miles today. I’ll tent tonight 2 miles into Vermont near the Seth Warner shelter.","Cheshire, MA

I finished my pop tart just as I made the turn to trek northbound on the AT. As I stopped and was tucking away my trash and calibrating my mind, an exuberant voice rang out with a loud good morning. Needless to say he scared the heck out of me as I was in my own world, rarely seeing anyone on the trail at that time of the morning. It was two southbound hikers finishing up the Long Trail which ends near the Massachusetts/Vermont border and they were happy. With only 11 miles to trek today I was not in a hurry, much less focused. 


Once again, the trail, in lower areas was extremely muddy and holding water. Hiking through the mud takes more energy than climbing elevations. Soon I had conquered the few mountain ridges, and was on my final descent towards Vermont 9 where I would head into the town of Bennington, Vermont. With no service, I studied my maps and just as I began to hike the 5 miles into town, a local resident pulled in and offered a ride. Once again, God was looking out after me and the trail provides. 


Once in town I ate then took a taxi to a house where I showered and completed my chores. Later, my two daughters, Geralyn and Christine arrived for a two day visit. I’m on top of the world as I’ve longed to see them for quite a while!

Afterwards, we returned back to the house they rented where we sat on the back deck until dark. The transition from dusk to dark is always beautiful, and was highlighted by a few fireflies flying about. There was never a lull in the conversation as there was so much to catch-up on in their lives and I was thirsty to hear it all.I made coffee this morning, and soon the girls were stirring. We had breakfast at a local diner and eventually did my resupply.  After lunch, the rainy weather broke, and I continued my quest against ticks with what should be my last application of permethrin on my pack and clothing. 



The girls and I then went out hiking. We did a short local trail in MA to a waterfall and then a brief section of the AT.Once back at the place, I was treated to a homemade chicken stew over rice, boiled corn, beets, and Louisiana tomatoes and cucumbers. For dessert, we had Christine’s famous chocolate chip & walnut cookies. Everything was so good, but nothing topped the company and lifted spirits that these two girls brought to my heart. With father’s Day approaching, it’s rewarding to have them with me for a couple of days. When raising them, I’ve tried to provide them with roots and wings. They’re both very independent women who remember their roots and exercise their wings frequently as they’ve learned to navigate the world, literally and figuratively.

At about noon, we departed and headed to the trailhead off of Vermont 9. When we pulled into the parking lot, I got out and as soon as I put my pack on it began to rain. I got back in the car and we sat for another 30 minutes or so. The rain stopped at about 2:00 and I headed out. The girls hiked with me for about 6 tenths to split rock where we hugged and said our goodbyes. This was not easy as our visit went by so quickly. I then continued my climb and they descended back to the parking lot and on to Albany, NY to return the rental car as they both had early flights in the morning. I believe that the short ascend gave them both an actual snapshot of the Appalachian Trail.While hiking the 10.1 miles, I couldn’t help but reflect on how incredible our visit was and how proud I am of my two girls. It was tough to see them hike down the mountain and back to the parking lot. Their visit brought me a sense of peace. I also got new shoes, an air mattress that doesn’t leak and my pants are now mended. Oh, and did I mention the wonderful evening meal they prepared?

It was cold last night and there was a stiff north wind. I climbed the tower and witnessed one of the most beautiful sunrises. I stayed up there as long as I could stand the 30-40 mph wind. My hands were freezing and I was concerned about climbing down if I got too cold.


With heavy spring rain and the late melting of heavy snow, the trail was boggy once again and hard to traverse. It took twice the effort to hike as I hopped from rock to rock or log to log and on some occasions, I thought there was a rock there, but there actually wasn’t. If there’s nothing there, I simply trudged through it as it’s more difficult to go around. 


When I reached the Stratton Pond Shelter I learned from the caretaker there about the weather changing with a near 100 percent chance of rain tonight and tomorrow. As a result I made the decision to trek further than planned and reach the Spruce Peak Shelter area. This would give me just 2.8 miles to reach Vermont 11 and hopefully catch a ride into Manchester Center, VT.


As I reached the shelter, the rain started. As a result, I opted to sleep in the shelter along with thru hikers Near Miss from Ireland and Devon Maid from England. This shelter actually had four walls and a door. There was also a group of 10 college students attending a backwoods training course to become leaders to expose youth to the wilderness. Some were going to be working stateside, while others were going to Switzerland and other European countries. They were most hospitable and even fed us.

Later the owner of the Green Mountain Hostel picked us up in town and transported us to the hostel where I’ll ride today’s weather out and hit the trail in the morning. 


It appears that the further north I trek the more difficult it is to get phone reception. This determines when I’m able to post my journal. The journal is laborious, especially after a 12-14 hour day of hiking, but it’s incredibly important to me. It will continue to be years from now as I recount the many memories and challenges of this great adventure. At times, I’ll wake up at night and have to find my phone as I’ve fallen asleep while journaling. While I try to maintain a positive reflection and document the interesting or magnificent events of the day, I must on occasion mention the hardships as a result of weather, falls and the absolute mental challenge and physical toll on my body. 


Once again, I would not trade this experience for the anything. I will lace up my shoes every morning to seek a new sunrise and the wonder of the day until I reach my ultimate goal, the summit of Mount Katahdin, Maine!For those of you who trek with me in spirit, thank you for your thoughts, prayers and well wishes.

As quite a contrast to yesterday, the weather was beautiful with clear skies and cooler temperatures. The mud on the trail remained the same, especially with the recent rains, however it’s amazing what a day’s break will do for your mental outlook and the ability to deal with it all. There were several climbs today including Bromley Mountain (3260), Peru Peak (3429) and Baker Peak (2642). The difference was that there was the reward of a view after each. Other than these it was more of trekking in a heavy canopy. 


While hiking during the early afternoon I heard loud squealing coming from the underbrush near the trail. As I approached, a grouse emerged and flew at me or as well as a grouse could fly. I had to duck to prevent from getting hit. When I did so, I fell backwards into the mud. I wasn’t sure if it was protecting it’s nest or just wanted to get to the other side of the trail and I was in her way. The grouse, which flew like a chicken, landed just on the other side of the trail from where I was now sitting in the mud and ran into the woods. I’ve heard lots of grouse when hiking through Virginia as they make a thumping sound as their wing beat against their breast, but have not seen one up close. As I stood up, I collected myself and was thankful that it wasn’t a bear or moose. At the time, I was daydreaming about seeing a moose as there was plenty of moose tracks and scat on the trail. 


Just prior to reaching my tenting location, Rali hiked up behind me and shouted “Tank”. I believe the last time I saw Rali was in Virginia. Ironically we both started our AT thru-hike on March 11th.

There are a number of flip-floppers on the trail, but I’m not seeing many thru-hikers as I’m considered to be early.

Although I did my resupply yesterday, I walked to the nearby store to buy a pot pie, quart of milk, and a box of cereal. The weather is predicted to deteriorate throughout the day and I wanted to stay off of my feet. I also bought super glue to mend my shoes as the skin is peeling in several places. The trail is tough on shoes and it’s hard to believe I’ve only been in this pair for 90 miles.


Later Rali and I had a planning session, studying mileage, terrain and elevations as we mapped out the next few days. If things go well, we’ll reach New Hampshire by Sunday. It’s our intentions to remain together through the tortuous/treacherous White Mountains. 



The weather reports were spot on as it began raining during the late morning hours and got progressively harder, with lightning and thunder as the day went on. It’s predicted to rain throughout the night and into the morning.Other than doing menial chores, I patched my air pillow and kept the promise to myself and stayed off of my feet. The afternoon nap was also refreshing. When I began my trek, I would stop pretty regularly and take a nap after lunch. With my drive to increase mileage, combined with the ever increasing threat of ticks, I quit napping. 


Others at the hostel continue to read and study about the trail on their town day and like hiking it’s their preference. I on the other hand prefer to plan then put it away and out of my mind. This provides me with a mental intermission from the trail.


After dinner and a beer later at the local brewery, I packed up for my departure tomorrow and settled in to enjoy another night in a real bed with a bathroom nearby. I suspect that the trail conditions will be challenging with all the rain and I’ll need the best mental attitude I can muster to have a positive and productive day.","

Well fed and hydrated, Rali and I caught the 8:15 Rutland Transportation bus back to the trailhead where the AT crosses US 4. Although wet and muddy in spots, the trail conditions were not as bad as anticipated. The streams and creeks were angry as they were carrying lots of fast moving water from yesterday and last nights rain, but this only required a little extra caution when crossing. It was evident that my body appreciated the rest as my stamina seemed to have improved. 


Today’s trek was unremarkable as the foliage is very thick preventing any scenery or views. In the morning I came upon Maine Junction. The Appalachian Trail and the Long Trail have been running together since I entered Vermont. Maine Junction is where the Long Trail splits from the AT and heads to Canada. Later in the evening, the sky cleared and we came upon a cabin with a wooden ladder leading to a lookout tower on the roof. The view was great in every direction as I’ve been starved for scenery. To the northeast I could see Mount Moosilauke at an elevation of 4800 feet. This is the first mountain I’ll encounter in the Whites of New Hampshire.

There is so much beauty in nature and it’s easily recognizable especially when detached from the buzz of society and any form of light pollution.


Later this morning when descending to cross Pomfret Road, there was a notice on a tree. Rali, still at a distance, asked me what the sign read? I told him that we’d be leaving the trail for a bit. The sign was welcoming hikers to the back porch of a nearby house for snacks. The home is owned by former AT thru-hikers Firefly and Loon. As we approached, Rali and I stumbled upon Ben. Together we enjoyed gigantic homemade ice cream cookie sandwiches, brownies, boiled eggs and soft drinks. The cost was nominal in comparison to the sheer gratification and It’s unanticipated opportunities such as this, when stumbled across, that really lift my spirits. The treats also energize me nutritionally for the next big climb. We sat on the porch for a few minutes catching up with Ben then trekked on. 


I was treated today to large areas of wildflowers along the trail when crossing pasture land. There were also several scenic views as we spent lots of time out of the forest and away from under the canopy. 


Since leaving Rutland, even with all of the recent rain, the trail conditions are quite improved from what I’ve experienced in southern Vermont. The elevation ascends are greater, but the actual walking path is better.

Soon I was in Hanover, NH and Rali, Ben and I found Lou’s Bakery. We were joined by Brown Eyed Girl, who is hiking north from Massachusetts. She originally was going to begin her hike at Mount Katahdin and travel south to Georgia, but due to heavy late season snowfall, Mount Katahdin did not open to hikers until June 15th. 


We bid farewell to Brown Eyed Girl and the trio headed to a residence where Ben’s friend is living while attending college and playing football at Dartmouth. We did all of our town chores there.

At about 9:00am, we set out and began our climb out of Hanover, NH. It was a still morning and although somewhat cool, it was going to get into the 80’s today. The mosquitoes, gnats and flies are becoming a real issue as their coordinated attacks come at times of heavy physical exertion. The gnats fly into and get stuck in my eyes while the flies bite and leave a wound. Mosquitoes do what mosquitoes do and aggravate the hell out of me. Repellent helps to some extent, but sweat diminishes it’s effectiveness.

The plan was to make it to the Hexacuba Shelter before the rain and take refuge there.
The biggest challenge was Smarts Mountain at an elevation of 3229 feet. The climb was challenging, but as always it’s better in the morning than the afternoon. I climbed the fire tower and the views were great, but I didn’t remain up there very long as I was wet with sweat and the cold wind was blowing hard.
As we neared the shelter area at about 11:00am and while getting water it began to rain. The 2 tenths climb to the shelter became a sprint.

For the last two nights I’ve been using a $5.00 pool raft that I bought during my last resupply because my two-time patched air mattress, with a two-day success record, was leaking again. I threw it away in Hanover as I was not going attempt another patch job. It’s somewhat frustrating as I’ve taken very good care of it to prevent punctures, but I guess it’s time had passed as the seams were failing. It lasted for over 3 months and was stained with grime and blood from my legs being scratched along the trail. For the last two nights I’ve been blowing my pool raft up, and similar to being at the beach with my kids when they were young, my lungs were not appreciative. When packing up in the morning I had to wake up earlier to deflate the raft so that I could pack it away. This morning I deflated the raft with my knife and the process was much quicker.


Yesterday’s rain left the trail muddy and slippery. The ascend and descend on Mount Cube was treacherous. Oftentimes I would wade through mud then trek across rocks that were wet and as highly polished as a new marble countertop. As difficult as this was, accomplishing this climb yesterday in a driving rain would have been that much more dangerous.


We continued on until reaching NH 25 where we hiked another 3 tenths to the Hikers Welcome Hostel outside of Glencliff, NH. There I received my mail package of my new air mattress, my rain pants and a warmer pullover. There were also a few of my eatable treats from home that warmed my heart.

I summited the 4800 foot Mount Moosilauke at about 10:00am. The views were spectacular, made more so by the weeks of hiking through a heavy canopy in the forest. I stood there on the summit for several minutes looking out over the vast wilderness as it seems to put things in proper perspective and reinforces just how small we are in this huge world. I eventually trekked on and remained above the tree-line for about a mile and a half as the frigid wind blew constantly. Eventually I descended and the view faded, only with the promise that more work will be rewarded with similar or more remarkable scenery.Although I would have preferred to hike a longer distance, there are intervals of safety and the ability to seek refuge from the weather and I didn’t want to overextend myself.

Trekking is different in the Whites as opposed to parts south as you’re often above the tree line and exposed. The weather is frequently unpredictable and can become severe without warning. With predictions of periodic rain and potential lightning and hail, taking a zero and sitting out today is the most prudent option. Additionally, if I did hike, there would be no view as the ceiling is extremely low. With time remaining to accomplish my August 1st summit date, there is no rush as the mileage remaining is very doable. The weather broke during early afternoon.

I quickly shedded my wet clothing, as the temperature was in the 50’s. Although I have rain gear, there’s not much hiking gear that’s impervious to this type of driving rain. Once changed, I set up my bedding and got inside my down sleeping bag to raise my body temperature and regain some dexterity in my fingers. 


The rain continued into the night, however the weather is forecasted to improve tomorrow. I finished the day with 10.3 miles and at mile 1829.2. The Whites are definitely living up to their reputation.","Mount Liberty Lodging, Lincoln, NH

Although it was good to be in the shelter and out of the rain, noises such as snoring and people moving about in their bedding make a lot of noise and earplugs will only help so much. 


I dressed in my wet clothing from the day before, with the exception of putting on dry socks, and packed up my pack. There were 10 people crammed in the shelter also taking refuge, so I’m as quiet as possible. I then ate part of my breakfast while waiting on RALI and Ben. Soon we were headed out and back on the trail and my once dry socks were now wet from my soaked shoes. 



The weather was overcast and once again we remained in the clouds leaving no chance for our packs to dry out. The Whites are challenging and today was no different. The heavy rains yesterday and last night made for slow ascends and descends as water flowed down the rocks that make up the trail.At about noon the clouds broke and filtered sunshine began to shine through the canopy. By then we had already summited Twin and Guyot Mountains as we hiked through heavy clouds.


We ended the day trekking 19.3 miles and are stealth camping at mile 1848.5 at an elevation of 3288 feet. I cooked and ate supper on an outcropping of rocks overlooking the mountain range. I also took the opportunity to hang clothing in the trees to dry and laid my shoes open on the warm rocks.

It wasn’t long before it started to drizzle slightly. This caused me quite a bit of concern because our ultimate goal was to summit Mt. Washington, and any weather could result in a very dangerous situation. 


Eventually the skies cleared and at about 10:30 we reached The Lakes of the Clouds Hut. There we at leftover breakfast food. There are several huts in the Whites which are owned and managed by the Appalachian Mountain Club. These are nice facilities and a stay, although costly, comes with breakfast and dinner. Most are booked, so the only way a thru-hiker could stay is to do what’s called a “work for stay.” This would entitle you to wash dishes or perform some other task in exchange for eating leftovers and sleeping on the dining room floor. I considered this, but the timing didn’t work out.


We then set out for the trek up to 6288 feet to the summit of Mt. Washington. It’s only clear up there approximately 40 days a year, and today wasn’t one of those days. We remained in the clouds and the wind blew 25-35mph, with gust to 50mph. The weather there can become very volatile without warning and the highest wind speeds recorded of 200mph have been there. Although disappointed about the lack of visibility, I was glad to put this mountain behind me.


We also summited Mt. Jackson, Mt. Pierce and Mt. Franklin while skirting several others including Mt. Eisenhower, Mt. Monroe, Mt. Clay, Mt. Jefferson and Mt. Madison. The weather remained partly cloudy and extremely windy which required me to compensate when stepping from rock to rock or boulder to boulder. Often times during the day, ascends or descends required rock scrambling. This is when you put away your trekking poles and climb using your hands and feet. This made for an incredibly slow moving and a long day. 


RALI, Ben and I ended our day trekking 19.4 miles and tenting at the Osgood Tent Site. There was no cooking tonight as I was just too tired both physically and mentally. Tonight’s meal is pepperoni on a tortilla and Pringle’s.","Stealth Site at Mile 1848.5

After a few climbs the trail began a rocky, but forgiving descent into Pinkham Notch. This completed our day with 4.7 miles  
Once there we went into a visitor center run by the Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) and ate a $13.00 all you can eat breakfast. The enjoyment of eating a real breakfast after being on the trail for three days is indescribable. 


We then waited around for, and tipped an AMC employee on a supply run to bring us into the town of Gorham, NH. There we spent the night at the Rattle River Lodge & Hostel. 


I was reflecting back on our trek across Mt. Washington and although disappointed that there was little visibility, I was thankful that it was in the rear view mirror. I was also thankful to have RALI and Ben because had it been worse, we could have spread out so that the last person remained near a cairn when the lead person found and approached another. This prevents wondering off trail and getting lost. When above tree-line, the trail is marked with vertical piles of rocks called cairns.","Osgood Campsite

Afterwards, RALI, Ben and I shuttled back to Pinkham Notch where we set out. Today we opted to slack pack, which means we still used our packs, but instead of the 30+ pounds, we had about 15lbs. This included water, food, snacks and some emergency gear. 


Our goal was to conquer the 4 peaks of Wildcat Mountain, Carter Mountain and Mount Moriah and make it back to the Rattle River Hostel where we would spend a second night. The trek was strenuous and difficult, complicated by 87 degree temperatures and little water on the trail. 


We successfully completed the 21.1 miles and ended our day at mile 1893.8. This means that I am now under the 300 mile mark. 


On our last 5 miles, we debated what to eat for dinner. The discussion ranged from ice cream, to ordering something to I’m tired and just going to bed. When we walked up the driveway to the hostel, the owner met us with a beer. “Han Slolo” another hiker informed us that they had just finished eating, but he would grill us each a few bratwurst and all the fixings were on the outdoor table. We all showered and the food was delicious along with another couple of beers. We each enjoyed a pint of ice cream for dessert. This was a blessing beyond belief, especially after a hard day of hiking. 


Hostels are run in a variety of ways and the Rattle River Hostel was one of my favorites. There are strict rules such as no one walks out of the intake room and into the house without showering first. This is where all the packs are hung as they are not allowed in the house and all hiking shoes remain outside. This helps to keep the house clean and all the hiking odors at bay. I’ve been at hostels before when people have walked in after days on the trail, and sat on the sofa. But like I’ve always said, common sense isn’t common anymore.","Pinkham Notch

At 6:30 RALI, Ben and I walked up the driveway and down the road where we accessed the trail. The weather was warm and still and it was going to be another hot day. 


While trekking along today, Ben spotted a moose in the forest some distance off of the trail. When he said moose, I heard it run off sounding like a horse. I was in a position with small pines and didn’t get to see it, but I hope to have another opportunity. 


By afternoon we had conquered Mt. Hayes, Cascade Mountain, Wocket Ledge,  and Mt. Success. At 5:00pm, we reached the Maine border, thus completing the 160.9 miles of AT trail I started in New Hampshire back on June 22. Maine is the final state of this journey with 282 miles. 



The gnats, mosquitoes and black flies are really bad throughout the day. It seems as though repellent either attracts them are makes them meaner. My arms and legs are welted from insect bites. When I reached the campsite, I hurriedly pitched my tent and took refuge inside. While getting my dinner together to go back out and cook and collect water, the black flies were swarming. Dinner was completed as expeditiously as possible and I returned to my tent. I took a brief video clip as their buzzing about was loud and distracting as I journal. For my friends back home who think we have a mosquito problem, I’ll take our dusk and dawn mosquitoes.

As a result of my restless night, I overslept and woke up at 4:45. We agreed to leave at 5:00 in an effort to beat a weather system. I was able to get packed up, but was on my heels having not eaten. We did leave at 5:00 and we had several challenges ahead.


With the complexity and challenges that lie ahead today, I hiked in honor and in remembrance of a former professional classmate, a friend, leader and later in our careers a managerial ally. Steve succumbed to complications with Leukemia recently and will be laid to rest on Monday. Steve was the epitome of a public servant and dedicated his life to helping others. I’m saddened that he did not get to enjoy retirement, but rather separated from the agency after his diagnosis.

The day began with Goose Eye Mountain. Soon after the 1 mile long, famous and extremely difficult Mahoosuc Notch. I had to climb over, under and around boulders the size of full-size vans or larger. Underneath were large crevices with seemingly no bottoms as well as massive ice patches. I accomplished this by stowing my trekking poles on my pack and scrambling on my hands, feet, knees and butt. The notch took over an hour to navigate. Right after came the Mahoosuc Arm. This is over a 1600 foot elevation ascend in 1.5 miles. As we began our descent, the thunderstorm began and we did our best to get down the mountain as quickly as possible.
We reached Grafton Notch at about 4:00pm. Soon our shuttle arrived and we’re in Andover, Maine. We intended to remain on the trail for another day, but underestimated the toll that the last couple of days would take on our bodies. 


I’ve studied the AT extensively and knew that southern Maine would be challenging. The complexity, difficulty and technical climbing experienced recently has exceeded my expectations.

Together we opted to take advantage of a slack packing opportunity to trek approximately 10 miles from Grafton Notch to East B Hill road. This would afford the ability to achieve mileage, but still recover from the previous days by carrying less weight, trekking a shorter distance and sleeping out of the elements.



The day went well as we set out at 8:00am, ascending from an elevation of 1500 to the peak of Baldpate at over 3800 feet. The weather was much improved with a low of 49 degrees, a high of 80 and a slight breeze. The view from Baldpate was great, overlooking the mountains I’ve traversed, those I’ll be introducing myself to in the coming days as well as the scenery and many ponds dotting the landscape.I’m now seeing a fair number of south-bounders (SOBOs) who have either summited Mount Katahdin or left from the Katahdin Stream campground and are now headed south to Georgia. Seeing these hikers seems unreal and brings back memories of my starting out back in Georgia. They all look fresh and unweathered in contrast to those of us who have been on the trail for months. The SOBOs tell us that they know we’re north-bounders (NOBOs) hiking thru because we look rough.

The last couple of days have allowed me achieve adequate mileage and to heal in preparation for higher mileage in the coming days. The goal is to conquer southern Maine and move north where the terrain will moderate some.


After lunch, I walked over to the post office and mailed home 3 pounds. This consisted of thermal underwear I carried for the trek through the Whites as well as some other items I no longer consider essential. Every little bit of weight reduction helps and 3 pounds at this stage of the game, especially when I embark on the 100 mile wilderness will be helpful. 


When showering this afternoon I found a tick on my hip. I pinched it off and a small amount of blood leaked out. This indicates that it actually attached itself and I must of missed it on my nightly tick checks. I carry doxycycline and took a dose in an attempt to head off Lyme disease. I’ll follow up with this medication regimen for a couple of more days as prescribed and keep my fingers crossed.

We shuttled out to the trailhead at South Arm Road and were trekking again for 6:20am. It was another cool morning. Soon we summited Old Blue Mountain and later Bemis Mountain both with elevations over 3500 feet. The day remained cool with a fairly brisk breeze which made a remarkable difference in managing the mosquitoes, gnats and flies.

Once again, it’s easy to differentiate between NOBOs and SOBOs. The SOBOs are buzzing about, Tigger like, while the very few NOBOs are more low keyed, out of site and taking every opportunity to rest.


I’ve grappled over the last couple of days over whether to replace my shoes. New Hampshire and Southern Maine have been rough on the soles and they’re heavier with all the shoe goo and super glue repairs. With that said, I visited the in-house gear shop. They don’t carry the Hoka brand, but I did try on a pair of Salomons and the difference was real. I hid them and walked back up the hill to the shoe rack to reassess my current pair of shoes. The tread on the soles was worn substantially and when I pressed my thumb into the sole tread I was surprised at how little resistance there was. I then did the math and realized that I had 500 hard miles on this pair, having gotten them in Bennington, VT when Geralyn and Christine visited. I’ve worn Salomons before and was pleased with their fit and performance so was comfortable with the decision, but still a little apprehensive about changing at this stage of the trek. Similar to other outfitters along the trail, the prices are fair and consistent with internet shopping as the owners are former thru hikers themselves.

We headed out at about 5:20 and it took a while to walk the 4 tenths up the blue blaze trail back to the AT. This was not due to the distance, but because of the rocky and boulder cluttered blue blaze trail. 

The weather was still and warm and it wasn’t long before I was as soaked with sweat as I was at the end of yesterday’s trek. By 8:00am a heavy rainfall hit. Although I could hear thunder in the distance there was no lightning close by. The raindrops were big and it wasn’t long before I was drenched to the core. This lasted for an hour or so, but once the rain ceased, the trees in the forest continued dripping for at least an hour longer. The positive aspect of being soaked is that I didn’t have to stop and put on my water shoes to ford the two rivers. I just kept walking.
The second volley of rain came at about noon and once again, it was heavy and lasted for about an hour. At 1:30pm we finally stopped for lunch. We all sat on individual rocks about 10 feet apart, thoroughly soaked and no one said anything. We only took about 10 minutes and set out again. By late afternoon, the skies had cleared and my spirits were lifted.
The trail was difficult today as we conquered the Chairbacks with several ascends and steep descents made more difficult by driving rain, slick rocks and roots as well as a lot of mud. Holding up at a shelter was not an option as the food I’m carrying will get me through this 100 mile wilderness in 5 days, with none to spare.
At about 5:00pm we reached the Sidney Tappan campsite where we are tenting tonight after hiking 18.6 miles. At dinner we talked about the challenges of the day and tomorrow’s goal. While eating, it became cloudy again and there were dark blue storm clouds once again in the northwest. I finished eating quickly, retrieved my socks, shoes and a few other things I had hanging in tree branches and made it into my tent as the rain started again. I had to close my rain flys as I had everything open, optimistic that we had dealt with the last of the rain for the day. Fortunately the rain only lasted for about 30 minutes or so. 


While in my tent, I went through my nightly ritual of putting things in order, then setting aside tomorrow’s lunch and snacks. I then pull out my AWOL guide to figure the mileage accomplishment for the day and look at the elevations for tomorrow. I attempted to journal, but was unable as my fingers were so waterlogged from being wet all day that my phone wouldn’t respond to touch, so I went to sleep. 


At 11:00pm I was awakened by what I thought was thunder, but was an airliner flying overhead. I went to the bathroom, then opened my tent flys as the air felt slightly cooler and to reduce condensation inside. I took time now to complete my journal for the day.","Cloud Pond

Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619810,"Posted July 27By 3:00am the remnants of the July 16th full moon was shining brightly through my tent. It was beautiful and regardless of what sort of day I’ve had, there is always something significant in nature that’ll happen which reminds me why I’m out here. 


I awakened at 4:30 and began packing up while eating my honey bun and protein bar. Normally I get dressed first, but was in no hurry to put on my wet clothes. At 5:15 we headed out. We immediately ascended up to Hay Mountain and then White Cap Mountain where the first view of Mt. Katahdin is possible. There was no chance of that this morning due to the clouds and fog. Approximately 6 miles later we climbed Little Boardman Mountain. At the summit, we ate lunch and I enjoyed my first of Maine’s wild blueberries. I was beginning to get concerned that I would complete this trek prior to the blueberries ripening. Upon our descent the trail began to level out. With the exception of a few rocky areas, bogs and a couple of streams to ford, the trail was flat and forgiving. 


The weather today was much improved with a low of 57 and a high temperature in the low 70’s. I pushed hard so that we could get to camp early enough to dry out our tents before setting up. RALI, Ben and I finished the day trekking 25 miles and tenting at the Antlers Campsite on a peninsula that extends out on a large pond.","Sidney Tappen Campsite

Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619853,"Posted July 28I woke up several times during the night as the loons on the pond were singing. The stars were out, but were subdued with some cloud cover. 


I awakened at 4:15 and packed up. This morning, as with many I didn’t need an alarm. Waking up at this time has become routine especially when going to sleep at 7:30pm. 


RALI, Ben and I headed out at 5:20 for what would be our last full day of trekking in the hundred mile wilderness. At about 8:00 it began to drizzle so I stopped and readied myself and equipment for rain. This consists of stowing my cellphone in a trusted zip-loc bag and putting my pack cover on my pack. I’m not sure of the worth of this as I’ve patched several small holes on my pack cover with duct tape and like my rain coat, it’s pretty much useless in a driving rain. 



The trail remained a challenge, not so much with elevation changes, but the rocks and roots are unforgiving on my feet. The scenery makes up for a lot of this as it’s beautiful and never seems to get old.
Eventually the threat of rain disappeared and I got my first view of Mount Katahdin. My emotions stirred as I have dreamt about this time for so long and it was actually happening. As Poet said, “At some point you’ll see Mt. Katahdin and the hardened heart, caused by 2000 miles of rocks and roots, will be shattered by emotion and the reality that my goal is within reach. Miles later I climbed Nesuntabunt Mountain and got my second look at Mount Katahdin. My dream is becoming a reality. 


Later this afternoon, RALI decided that he had enough for the day and stopped for the night at a shelter area. Ben and I continued as I’d rather trek longer today and less tomorrow. About 2 miles later we came upon a bull moose grazing in a shallow pond. I worked my way to the tree line and took several photos and a brief video. The animal was massive, wider than a horse, and his antlers were still in velvet. I watched for several minutes as the moose continued to graze in about 18 inches of water at about 25 yards away. This made my earlier siting of the cow moose at 100 yards seem so trivial. Once again the trail had provided another incredible experience, and although I captured on camera, seems to not do it fair justice. 


Ben and I finished the day trekking 25.5 miles and tenting at the Rainbow Spring Campsite At mile 2165.7.


While eating dinner tonight I joked that this will be the last time I eat chicken flavored anything. I stayed around after eating to visit with Aqua Man and Goat. Aqua Man and I began the trail on the same day and have hiked in and out of each other. The last time I saw him was in Virginia. We met again at a campsite on our first day of the 100 hundred mile wilderness and have camped nightly near each other since. Aqua Man finished his mechanical engineering degree and is hiking the trail before starting a job. He, like many others I’ve met on the AT, are great people and I’d hire him tomorrow to manage a company.


I went to bed thinking that this will be the last time I sleep in my tent on this journey. After seeing Mount Katahdin a couple of times, the feeling was so surreal. I drifted off to sleep wondering what the final day will be like.","Antlers Campsite

I was awakened last night by what I’ll describe as a loon festival. At about 11:00pm, the loons on the pond approximately 100 yards away began singing. I grabbed my phone and recorded an audio clip of the singing. Although loud, it was so peaceful and added to the serenity of it all. I stuck my head out of my tent, resting it on my inflatable pillow and looked up through the breaks in the tree canopy at the millions of stars overhead. It’s moments such as this that can’t be captured with a camera, but something you’ve got to experience first hand to truly appreciate. Within an hour, I drifted back to sleep as the two 25 mile days on rough terrain had taken it’s toll. 


I got up this morning, packed up and Ben I were on the trail for 5:15. The terrain on the trail had not changed, but our demeanor had as this was our last day in the hundred mile wilderness. We hiked on and after about 8 miles the trail became significantly more pleasant. The rocks and roots had become less prevalent and the trail was lined with pine needles making it spungy and easy on the feet. 


By 10:00 we crossed the Penobscot River on the Abol Bridge which offered another spectacular view of Mount Katahdin. The feeling of seeing this mountain getting closer is indescribable and continues to stir emotions. A short distance later we reached the Abol Campground covering 11.2 miles. We immediately went to the camp store and bought a coke and chips. We visited again with Goat and Aqua Man until the little restaurant opened at 11:00. While eating, we talked about the loons last night and once again about the incredible encounter with the bull moose. I was happy that Goat and Aqua Man also saw the bull moose. About an hour or so later, RALI joined us. Although he did not get to see the bull yesterday, he did encounter a cow  and a calf moose on the trail this morning at really close range.


RALI, Ben and I are sharing a small cabin, similar to a lawnmower shed in a backyard, at the Abol Campground tonight and will trek the 10 miles to Baxter State Park tomorrow.


We completed the 100 mile wilderness in four and a half days and I finished with a handful of cashews in a bag and a honey bun remaining in my food bag. My pack is the lightest it’s ever been.","Rainbow Spring

By 7:30 we were back on the trail and a few tenths later, I was crossing into Baxter State Park with the two guys I agreed to hike the Whites with back in New Hampshire. 


We hiked the 9.9 miles to the Katahdin Stream Campground where I did a recon for my return later. RALI, Ben an I then hitched a ride to Millinocket. For the first time on this journey, the first vehicle we encountered picked us up. We loaded up and all expressed our appreciation to the driver. When the lady learned that we left Georgia in March and hiked all the way to Maine she became extremely excited, telling us how honored she was to be in our company. She then asked me to tell her about the trek. I responded with a few stories, but ultimately told her that I had not yet had time to fully process or understand yet what I’ve accomplished.


We arrived in Millinocket where we checked into the Appalachian Trail Lodge. I’ll lay up here until joined by my two sons Jeffery and David as well as a very close friend David Staton. Although the wait will be difficult, the experience and memory of completing this journey and climbing Mount Katahdin with these men will be extremely memorable and forever in my heart.","Abol Bride Campground

Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619999,"Since arriving in Millinocket last Thursday, I used this time to rest, eat and relax. I remain in hiker mode, waking up early daily, going for long walks and enjoying my time in the morning at the local diner. I love old fashion diners as they have a certain personality of yesteryear when times were much more simple.


I spent a fair amount of time at the Millinocket library down the street where I am constructing the conclusion to my journal on one of the guest computers. It’s phenomenal how fast I can write using a full-size keyboard and a computer screen as opposed to my cellphone while sitting in my tent.


I also met by a friend, Mike Edes who is retired from the Maine State Police. He took me out to lunch and then to the grocery store to pick up a few things as eating out at restaurants gets old. It was great catching up with him.
Although I feel as though I have been in God's best Cathedral over the past several months, I attended Mass. It was good to formally re-connect with my faith. The priest and I had a long conversation about my experiences on the trail and I relayed the sense of peace that I've felt, as well as the self reflection along the way.


After discussions with other hikers, I was curious about the number of steps I've taken on this journey. As a result, I walked the Millinocket High School track to estimate my walking pace count. Of the four quarter mile laps, I derived an average pace count of 535 steps per quarter mile, times four equals 2140, times the 2192 mile length of the Appalachian Trail. Therefore, I estimate that I've taken 4,690,880 steps to complete this journey. This estimate is based on flatland walking on a paved surface, not climbing and sidestepping rocks and roots. This combined with the ""sideways mileage"" as I've referred to before, such as taking wrong turns on the trail, walking miles into town, walking to get water and ""in town walking"" to eat and resupply, I figure that I have taken over 5 million steps.
Tomorrow will be my last day alone here as my sons and friend will arrive during the afternoon. I will sharpen my mind and prepare for ""Game-Day"" and the culmination of this journey.","

I checked out at 10:00 and waited in the park until I could walk the 920 feet down the street and check in to a house that my sons rented for our stay together. 


I have not seen these two since I left back in March and I’m looking forward to the reunion as much as the actual climb of Mount Katahdin. I was also looking forward to seeing my ole friend David. 


David and I have worked together and around each other for a long time and he’s become a great friend and confidant, always telling me what I need to hear versus what I want to hear. In my opinion, the marquis of a true friend.


The boys and David arrived at about 23;30pm and the reunion was everything I dreamed it would be. We hugged and talked about for some time before heading out to the grocery store and then to dinner. We discussed our hike tomorrow to ensure everyone had what's needed physically and mentally to make the climb.


Afterwards we prepared our packs in anticipation for the early morning departure to Baxter State Park. I’m beyond excited and ready!","

Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620220,"We arrived at Baxter State Park for the 6:00am gate opening and drove the gravel road another several miles before reaching the Katahdin Stream Campground where we’d launch from. 



The weather was cooler than it had been, but the humidity was noticeably lower. The first mile or so of the trail was forgiving, however that soon changed as things became more difficult. Soon I stowed my trekking poles and began scrambling, using my hands and feet.
We eventually trekked the 5.2 extremely difficult mile trek to an elevation of 5267 feet and summited Mount Katahdin. The powder keg of emotions I’d been carrying, especially today, were hard to keep in check. I walked up to the Katahdin sign, grabbed it on both sides and place my head against the sign. The months of adversity, beautiful scenery and every other indescribable feeling now collided with reality. I had completed this incredible adventure. This journey that included 121 days of actual trekking on the trail was now over. 


As I embraced the sign, I heard my younger son David asking day hikers to step away so that my oldest son Jeffery could take photos. David explained that I was completing my thru-hike. A few people clapped and I eventually composed myself. I then climbed up on the sign frame and took the traditional photo of a successful thru-hiker while standing above the sign. 


Afterwards I hugged my sons and friend David, so excited and proud to spend this once in a lifetime experience of being with me for the completion of my journey. Their presence made the culmination of the journey that much more special and for that I'll be forever grateful. 


After eating lunch at the summit, we began the trek down. I went ahead of my sons and David because I needed to register as a thru-hiker with the park rangers. I attempted to when we set out, but the ranger station was vacant. Upon making it down the mountain, I registered as number the 180th thru-hiker to summit Mount Katahdin for the 2019 season. 


I will soon be home and begin the reintegration back to my life as I once knew it and with the people I love. 


In the coming day or days, I will post my conclusion on this trailjournals.com/tank2019 site. I’m uncertain if there will be conclusion tab or if the program will carry it in succession on my journal.","Katahdin Stream Campground

Tank,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620388,"When leaving home I debated whether to ask Rachael to accompany me to Amicalola Falls in Georgia for my departure or to just leave from home, saying our goodbyes there. I opted to travel alone, knowing that a clean emotional incision heals quicker and relieving her of the task of getting home. We embraced outside the Union Passenger Terminal in New Orleans at 5:00 on Sunday morning, March 10, 2019, and not long after, this great adventure began with a lurch of a locomotive as I sat in an Amtrak coach car seat. It now ends with the thrust of jet engines as the airplane taxis towards the runway in Bangor, Maine. Little did I realize that the adventure that I anticipated taking 6 months would end in four months and a few weeks, 121 days of actual trekking, with the realization and accomplishment of an unbelievable dream. A goal that only 15% - 20% of hikers who set out would realize. Though I've contributed to my journal faithfully, I will attempt to put it all into context within this written conclusion. Here goes:
Over the months of planning and acquiring necessary equipment, I pushed myself out of a comfort zone as I've done countless times before, but this was a giant leap. As I set out on the first day the feeling of independence and apprehension were both very real, however I remained confident in my physical and mental preparations, equipment acquisitions and planning. Although I carried everything on my back that I would need, I would soon learn that the mental toll of a trek of this enormity can not be overstated and that every decision would have consequences, good or bad. 

I trekked alone as my intentions were to have time for thought and self reflection. Self reflection about where I stood in life, things I wished to improve on or change within, and to take stock of the many blessings of health, marriage, family, grandchildren, friends and career success that I have enjoyed. When at campsites in the evening, and not stealth camping, I would often visit with other hikers for human interaction, tips for managing my hike and to gather new meal ideas. I've friended some incredible people along the way, some with diverse backgrounds, varying political views and religious beliefs, all proof that with a common thread of interest we can all co-exist. Some have chosen to hike with me, but during this time conversation was often limited due to physical exertion and individual focus. I've had a few favorite partners at times, but having a continuous hiking partner was difficult due many variables. Through all of the adversity of freezing temperatures, long arduous ascends and descends, scorching heat and vicious insects, I've remained confident and independent. I've managed this hike in mind and body with great care and thought, ever cognizant that a mistake or misstep could end it all. Although I've reminded myself that failure is not fatal, I knew that this would serve as little consolation should it become a reality due to injury or illness.
I have made a conscious effort to look over my shoulder, as the views are often better from another perspective. Along the way, I've taken every opportunity to trek out to overlooks, observe areas or monuments of cultural or historical value and learn while doing so. Whether standing on a mountain with treetops at my feet, wading through clouds or negotiating muddy bogs, the majestic value of this whole experience and my first hand encounter with nature can not be overstated. I've celebrated every mile, every climb, every state line crossed as well as every other little milestone that I could identify all in the motivational quest to accomplish my ultimate goal. For every tough mountain, I told myself that I'd never climb that one again. On the extremely cold nights or mornings or rainy days, I convinced myself that these conditions won't last.

I've also enjoyed the diverse character of small town USA as each has it's own ambiance. When retreating to a town seeking refuge from severe weather or to resupply and rest, I reveled at the opportunity to eat non-trail food, as well as shower and wash laundry, as being dirty and the constant foul stench of my body and clothing wore on me. One of the best feelings and my favorites was to wash my hands in warm soapy water. Often, I would stand at the lavatory for 5 minutes with warm water flowing over my hands, as it was a reprieve from the cold feeling of hand gel used on the trail.

Soon days became weeks and weeks became months as the forest transformed around me from winter to spring and eventually summer. A few days or a week ago seemed like an eternity as the miles and experiences are pushed from memory and places and occurrences begin to run together. The further north I trekked, people wanted to know and talk as they were intrigued by my efforts. I greeted them all with courtesy, taking a few minutes to answer questions or take a photograph with them, but at some point my pack became heavy, daylight becomes limited and I must go.
The trek has taken a toll on my body as my joints ache. My arches have flattened and my feet are now a whole size larger. With a daily caloric burn rate of 5000-7000 calories a day, I've done my best to eat as much and when ever I could, especially in town, however I've lost approximately 25 pounds. I've traversed a trail taking over 5 million steps, through 14 states, and 8 national forests, consisting of 2192 miles. I've learned that a thru-hiker trekking from Georgia to Maine will climb and descend a total of 91 miles. This is an elevation gain and loss equal to climbing Mount Everest almost 17 times. 
With my experience, I offer the following thoughts of reflection. In everyday life when we're attempting to justify a purchase or an idea to ourselves or loved ones we'll say ""hey, you only live once."" I'll challenge and counter this thought process by saying we only die once. I intend to live everyday while making the most of my life. We give our best to our families, workplace and all that we do, but are we giving the best to ourselves. I'm reminded of this lately as I've lost friends who have died, never enjoying a day of retirement or what they've worked for in their lives. We have one life to live and may we never say ""I wish I would have"" to something we wanted to do, accomplish or experience. Great things never come from comfort zones. Be your best everyday because the life you change may be your own.

I've prayed daily and often on this journey and God and I have had some really frank conversations, especially during times of severe weather. He'd often respond with beautiful scenery, a gentle breeze, sunshine, gale force winds, snow, sleet or thunderstorms with nearby lightning strikes. Regardless of conditions and sometimes fearful, I've never felt alone or closer to God. 

It's my appreciation that although the trek was always a formidable mental challenge, the first third of the journey was physical with strenuous, seemingly never ending ascends, descends and terrain changes. The second third was predominately mental and the final third was a deep spiritual experience. By spiritual, I'm actually referring to the human spirit while grasping a better understanding of myself through extraordinary experiences and adversity. The true peace and freedom that I've come to know and enjoy on this adventure can not be put into words. The scenery and the countless moments of self-reflection will forever be embedded in my heart and memory. I've come to realize that I may have needed this adventure more than I wanted it. For that I am forever grateful.

One of the most heartwarming experiences on this journey has been the overwhelming generosity and caring attitude of total strangers whom I've met along the way. I offer a special thanks to all of the trail angels who have borne the expense of visiting, feeding and lodging me all in an effort to move me along. Some are family, some are friends, and others are people whom I’ve met for the first time, while others remain absolutely anonymous, providing trail magic along the way. Although I thanked each of you personally from the bottom of my heart, you will never know the actual impact you've had on helping me physically and emotionally. To all who have followed along in spirit, I thank you for your well wishes, thoughts and prayers. Many have cited courage, inspiration and other flattering compliments regarding my accomplishments. For that I also thank you as your words were frequently inspirational. I don't see myself as doing anything special. I simply woke up everyday, stepping out of my tent, a shelter, a hostel or hotel room, embracing the wonder of a new day. Sequentially, I put in a hard days work, often hiking 10-16 hours a day, never fixating on an end goal, but focusing on the day at hand. 

Although each state possessed it's own challenges, special beauty, distinct personality and uniqueness, the Whites in New Hampshire have been some of the most difficult mountains. They've also provided a great sense of accomplishment, beauty and peace. Despite the distraction of the mosquitoes, gnats and flies, Maine has been the most beautiful with numerous ponds dotted about the landscape and majestic views. Although I've taken numerous photographs, simply carving a square out of a magnificent landscape seems to do an injustice to the incredible grandeur of it all. My encounters with wildlife along the entire trail have also been memorable. 
My Appalachian Trail journey has provided me with a great deal of enjoyment and personal satisfaction. In some aspects it has freed my soul in a sense and aided in my transition from my former professional life. While it's difficult to describe where this wilderness journey has taken me, I'm certain that I've become a better person. Nature and the trail have emphasized how insignificant we are as individuals on this earth and reinforced the importance of embracing the moment and investing in those we love. Perhaps in the coming weeks, I'll come to terms with understanding the enormity of my accomplishment, but for now I will hold my loved ones, pet my loyal dog Abigail, and relish in the comforts of home. 

Success is not final, failure is not fatal. It's the courage to continue that counts.
