Question Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606448,"The first time I ever heard of the Appalachian Trail was back in the 70's. I was working as a woodcarver at Silver Dollar City and we had just opened a ""sister"" woodcarving store in Gatlinburg, Tn. They had needed resupply for the Tennessee store and I volunteered to drive a truck load of product out. I don't recall the particular reason, but I stayed on a week or so, because one of the workers was out with carpal tunnel (or something). Being that close to the Smoky Mountains, I spent as much time exploring the area as I could and recall being on a dayhike with a friend, when we came across a trail designated as the ""Appalachian Trail"". I asked about it and was told it was this crazy trail that went from Georgia to Maine, and that you could walk the entire way. I remember wondering who has that kind of time (or money) to do something like that. And the seed was planted.",,View Entry,"Jan 16, Wed",0
Question Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606459,"The last trip to the Quetico/Boundary Waters canoeing was a few years ago. I was designated cook for the trip and really enjoyed planning and executing the menu. It was fun doing unconventional meals, that you might not expect on a wilderness outing. Things like chicken and dumplings, fried pies, chocolate cake, funnel cake, biscuits and gravy, and fresh cornbread to go with fried freshly caught walleye. Needless to say, this took planning. I thought about each meal, each set of ingredients, how to best pack/keep fresh, etc. All this preparation for the meals, however my personal items were a different story. Since I was no longer a newbie to the Quetico, I was comfortable that my ""personal list"" was pretty much down pat. Travel day came with everything packed and ready to go. I grabbed up my two packs (personal stuff and food pack - you get to take a lot more stuff on a canoe trip because most of the time its laying in the bottom of a boat and you aren't carrying it) and tossed them into the truck we were taking.So we get to Canada, begin unloading the truck, and I can't find my shoes. I wore flipflops in the truck as travel wear. Where were my shoes? Oh no! I had gone off and left them. So, with no other option, I opened my personal pack and pulled out the pair of moccasins that I had brought for camp wear. NOT appropriate footwear for portaging - but it was all I had. I made them work. For the entire trip, whether carrying a pack or shouldering a canoe on portages, they had to work.I learned my lesson well. Make a list. Check it twice. Granted, on a trip like the AT, you can easily replace/resupply. But I can't tell you how very frustrating it was, upon returning home from Canada, and see that terrific pair of Keens that had sat in the garage by the back door, the entire time, while I wore a floppy, wet pair of moccasins the entire trip. Oh well. All that said, and still the trip was delightful and I made lifetime memories with dear friends. The food was good, too.",,View Entry,"Jan 17, Thu",0
Question Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606894,"I have noticed,  there seem to be two distinct categories of response, when I mention my plan of hiking the Appalachian Trail (and the person I am talking with actually understands what is involved). 
One group replies that - its awesome, Sounds fun, exciting, and challenging. What a great life experience. This group quickly moves to asking logistics, such as ""How are you going to ...."" or ""What about ..."". And, always end with a version of - ""Wish you the best"" or ""I'm envious"". 
The other group reacts with more surprise, accompanied with, ""Are you crazy?"", ""Why would you do that?"", or ""That sounds horrible!"" followed up by ""What about bears?"", ""Aren't you worried about the crazy people (aka: mass murderers) you'll meet?"", or ""Are you taking a gun?""
So, when I sit down to write about why I'm attempting this hike, honestly - the people in the first group ""get it"", without any explanation. In fact, they want to go. They want to do it. Whereas, the second group, probably won't ever understand, with all the explaining in the world. It makes no sense to them. And won't. But I do have personal reasons for attempting something like this. I have always enjoyed being outdoors and walking in the woods. The trail offers lifetime views, memories, and opportunities for friends. Also, people often ""retreat"" for spiritual reasons - but I consider this the opposite - more of a spiritual ""advance"". A time of focused closeness with God.
I have VERY high expectations of payoff, else I would not sacrifice the very dear things, that I am. I will dearly miss my wife and family. Whether I am able to finish or not, I know it will be an experience of a lifetime.",,View Entry,"Feb 07, Thu",0
Question Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607096,"So my grandson has offered detailed advice for me which I am sharing for the benefit of any other thru hikers who might benefit. 1. Remember to collect rocks for me (I have promised to send a rock from each state, as I pass thru).2. Learn a lot.3. Have fun4. Make friends with people you see 5. Remember you can rub a rock and stick together real fast to make a fire6. Look for pineapples, berry bushes, and apple trees for food7. Make sure no one sees you when you potty8. Be safe-Look out for snakes, especially king cobras because they are poisonous - Be careful for bees, wasps, fire ants, and mosquitoes. They sting and bite.- Look out for robbers- Run fast from bears. They have big claws and might try to attack- If there is a storm go somewhere safe. Don’t use a tent, umbrella, or blanket because lightning can strike through - When climbing the mountain, make sure the rock you grab hold of is not twisty or looseAnd remember the people at home love you",,View Entry,"Feb 17, Sun",0
Question Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607606,"First off, sorry for the huge delay in updates. I had heard much of the South has poor service (AT&T) and it seems to be true. 
Today started beautiful. Caught a shuttle from Barefoot Hills to the visitor center. Weighed my pack (26#) and attended a brief Leave No Trace class before taking off. The Approach Trail is 8 miles long and meanders up and over an incredible water fall (that includes 600 steps up a wooden staircase). The remaining miles were challenging and towards the end of the day it started to rain. I reached the summit and went on an additional .2 miles to the Shelter. Having planned to tent as much as possible, I scouted out the tent sites. They were standing pools of water 3” to 4” deep. So, spent the night in the shelter. All in all a great day!","Amicalola Falls Visitor Center

Question Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607613,"Today was gorgeous. There are lots of places where the trail is just wide enough to walk with a very steep incline on one side and decline on the other. Towards end of the day was a long soaking cold rain. Pulled off at the tent sites rather than sheltering again. Once I got my tent up, wet clothes off and dry clothes on, felt pretty good. I think I was done hiking about 11:30. Fixed a hot meal and in my sleeping bag very early.","Springer Mountain Shelter

Question Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607892,"Today was absolutely beautiful. There were parts that meandered thru a very tall pine forest. Places where the trail had apparently been an old road bed covered in a bed of pine needles. Then, other sections that narrowed to a very tight path that twisted and turned and regularly crossed over streams, with a heavy canopy of rhododendron, whose leaves remained green throughout the winter. Absolutely gorgeous. Still heavy cover of fog, so no big views, however, the fog has this eerie beauty of its own.","Hawk Mountain Tentsites
",Gooch Mountain Shelter,"Feb 23, Sat",8.30
Question Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607893,"Today was sunny and warmer. Skies cleared and we had glorious views all around. The penalty for leaving this early is the cold, but without foliage on the trees, there are views in every direction. At the top of one of the mountains, alongside the trail a huge, flat outcropping of stone opened up with incredible open views of rolling mountains, layer after layer in the distance. I peeled my pack off, sat down to enjoy the beauty, had lunch and actually took a short nap in the sun. Got a bit of a sunburn. Lots and lots of day hikers out today. I'm sure some of it is because of the weather but also because this section has easy road access from a couple of points. We had a couple of wider stream crossings today that required a balancing act across a log. So an interesting feature of trail culture is that hikers take on ""Trail Names"". Often from events or sometimes from nicknames. I had taken on ""Question Mark"" as a trailname to start. It has quickly been shortened to ""Q"". Here are a few of the folks I've met. Mission, Lady Di, The Wandering Women, Sheika Sage, Sherpa, Weatherman, Hungry Man, Snow White, Riser, Brightside, Cowboy Up, Samaritan, Halo, Bluegrass and his wife Sunshine, Cedar, Flyboy. I'm leaving a lot out.Late today I came across a lady who goes by French Fry. She had taken a dive into one of the stream crossing by falling off of the log. In doing so, she had completely drenched most of her dry clothes that she would normally change into for the night. I felt very sorry for her.Pulled into the shelter about 2 pm and set up my tent. Weather turned much cooler with winds howling thru. About 3 am I lay there, going thru my packed items, trying to think if there was ANYTHING else I could put on to be warmer. It dawned on me that I had brought one of those little mylar space blankets (that I was sure was a waste of space and weight). So at 3 am I'm rustling around unfolding this thing that sounds like tin foil being rattled around. Hopefully not keeping the other tenters awake. That flimsy little blanket did the trick. It cut the wind and provided just the added warmth! Slept the rest of the night like a baby.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

Question Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607909,"One of the terms on the trail is ""taking a zero"". Obviously this is a day off in which you add no miles to your total. The next thing to this is ""a Nero"", in which you do ""Nearly Zero miles"". Today was a Nero for me. Only 3.6 miles into Neels Gap where they have an outfitter called Mountain Crossing. Upon arriving, I had a Red Baron frozen pizza. (Quite possibly the best pizza I have ever had in my entire life!) The hostels are basically bunk rooms with a shared shower. It seems quite a luxury after being on the trail. They have reduced prices which makes them very attractive to hikers. I did a small resupply to get me thru the next few days.From here, the trail actually goes under the roof of the outfitters, the only section of the trail that is under roof. This is also the home of the infamous tree that holds dozens of pairs of hiker shoes/boots where people have quit and tossed their boots into the limbs - literally ""hanging them up"".","Woods Hole Shelter

Question Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608927,"I am back dating lots of these entries because service was so sparse for so long.    I am pretty sure that when I arrived at this shelter, it was really full. Each evening upon arrival at my destination I have a routine. First, set up my tent and get my sleeping arrangement squared away. (Pad blown up, sleeping bag out of the compression bag so that it gains loft in order to keep you warm, pillow blown up). Then I get on warm clothes because it always seems to be colder when you stop moving. Next I gather water (there is nearly always a stream nearby, and filter it. Then dinner is cooked, I eat. Next you brush your teeth and then put everything that could be interesting or appetizing to a bear in your “bear bag”. If the campsite has bear hang cables, you can use those, or else you must hang the bag from a limb with “bear cable” that you bring in your pack. In Georgia the campsites had “bear boxes” (which was simply a large metal toolbox or gang ox that you place you bear bag in to prevent bear issues. This shelter had a beatbox. Upon waking the next morning and retrieving my bear bag, I found large holes in the side where mice had somehow gotten into the box and chewed holes in the side. Duct tape will fix anything!","

Question Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609865,"Okay, so I am going to apologize for my poor journaling habits and attempt to provide a single “catch-up” entry. Sorry for the length of the entry. 
It seems all of February was cold and wet, usually rainy. I had planned to avoid the shelters but found them to be a warmer alternative, so fairly often stayed in them. I also opted for earplugs, though I had previously decided that I would much more prefer to be able to hear and more aware of my surroundings. First night in the first shelter changed my mind on that! Snorers.
It was so exciting to get to the first state line. Georgia was over and North Carolina had arrived. Little did I know that we would immediately begin one of the hardest climbs so far! Yikes.
When we arrived at Albert Mountain we literally had to stow trekking poles and use your hands to ascend the climb. It was a cross between being really hard and the most fun spot so far.
I zeroed in Franklin for one day because the weather was so bitterly cold. I know hikers who reported 7 degrees. 
I also had the delight of zeroing for 3 days in Gatlinburg with my daughter, son-in-law, and grandson.
Leaving the Smokies I spent the night in a hostel called Standing Bear Farms. That night hikers continued to arrive who had hiked in snow and freezing rain. I was very glad to have dodged it.
Later, when hiking over Max Patch (which is a very well known “bald”) I was hiking in snow with wind gusts that literally knocked some hikers down! It was a beautiful hike in snow covered terrain for the remainder of the day. The morning of the day I arrived in Hot Springs, I had my first “trail magic”. A guy named “Just Dave” had set up at Lemon Gap (a road crossing where he knew hikers would be crossing) He was serving bacon and eggs, orange juice, coffee, and Reece’s Peanutbutter Cups! Yum.Then at lunch, when I should have pulled my pack off to fuel up again, but I didn’t want to stop, I scored a Gatorade and candy bar from another trail angel. Then, finally, as I hit the edge of town, here is a guy set up, giving away sodas and pizza! Couldn’t have asked for more!
I had hiked two big days (16 mi ea) so treated myself with a zero at Laughing Heart Hostel there in hot Springs. I spent a fair amount of time visiting with a terrific guy who runs a hiker ministry there in town.
Upon leaving Hot Springs, I hiked hard and fast to catch a friend I have made named Halo. He had a good friend meeting him to hike a few days. I finally caught them and stuck with them until Snuggles (Halo’s friend)had to get off trail. We had great fellowship. 
Since then , I have been hiking with Halo. Our paces are similar and he has become a dear friend. He also is a believer, and I won’t mention the denomination, but we attended Sunday evening service in Erwin. We agreed that neither of us had ever been “yelled at” that much in church! It was a good sermon, but a lot of yelling! We laughed about it later. 
I also have to mention a fellow who had sort of adopted us. His name is Jimmy. He has a YouTube channel (something like Jimmy interviews hikers). Super nice guy. He slack packed us multiple times. He does trail magic all the time. His wife hiked the trail a few years ago. (Slack packing is when someone brings your pack to you, allowing you to carry next to nothing.) Most of the hikers that Jimmy has interviewed have hiked with me at some point. 
I have one more thing I have to share. When at Lemon Gap (where Just Dave was doing trail magic) I got to meet the Malone family. It’s a mom and dad with four little girls who are doing the trail. (Ages 5, 7, 8, and 10) Their trail names (from youngest to oldest) are Baby Bunny, Wild Jay, Sparkle Machine, and Horse Power. Mom and dad are Sunshine and Papa Bear. They are absolutely adorable! Each of the girls are hiking to raise money for thrown charity. They are on Instagram as malonefamilyat .  


I promise to try and be more vigilant in updates to this journal so the next one won’t be so long.","

Question Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609968,"Today was a great day. Halo, Zipper, Texaco, and I slack packed Southbound from Tn 91 to Boots Off Hostel near Hampton, Tn. That puts us at mile 449, so that we should hike into Damascus Va tomorrow night. We did 21 miles which is a big day for me, but I feel really good. The picture is difficult to see, but it’s a chimney where a hermits cabin once stood. We were told that his body was found after he had been dead for some time. They buried him there and sealed up his fireplace with a tombstone which read “He lived alone, suffered alone, and died alone”. His dog was taken down the mountain but returned and died at his grave. Sad.We also ran into the Malone family again. They are just such a sweet family. The girls are darling and the mom and dad are as nice as can be. I think it was Sparkle Machine (second oldest) who has begun woodcarving. She showed us a manatee she had carved on one end and a spoon on the other end. It was pretty good, too.","Boots Off Hostel

So this is kind of an exciting couple of things. First, finishing another state (Tennessee) and then arriving in Damascus (which is an iconic trail town).

Question Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610481,"Yesterday and today I’m the Grayson Highlands putting us at mile 511. Very nearly 1/4 way thru. The Highlands are beautiful and make me think of what it’s like in Scotland (at least in my mind). The weather cooperated by being very rainy and foggy(also what I imagine Scotland to be like). Then, to top off the experience, there are wild Shetland ponies through out the park. We didn’t see many, but we did see some. The weather is turning nasty tonight, so am staying in a hostel. It’s a nice place and they offer cross-country skiing in the winter. I would love to come back some day. Tomorrow we plan on 16 miles and it’s supposed to get cold again. Hopefully I won’t miss all the stuff I mailed home in Damascus.","

Question Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610622,"So I am pretty sure this is going to become a big thing -and I started it. It’s called Tribal Scarring and is a sort of primal rite of passage for those completing one fourth of the AT. Some get tattoos, but this is more hard core. What you must do, is hike at a quick pace, pick out a particular stone on the trail, and dive into it head first, in order to obtain your tribal scar.There is a rumor floating around that I received this injury because I was actually trying to put my water bottle into my pack and fell and hit my head on a rock . . . But that’s not what happened! I participated in tribal Scarring in the honorable way. As a warrior. Tonight am camping with three great guys, Halo, RG59, and Stingray. We are all retired and hike similar speeds. We are at a beautiful old 1890’s homestead. About mile 537 or so. Plan to hike into Atkins, Va tomorrow. Weather was perfect today.

So we pulled off and will stay tonight and tomorrow night here in Bland Va. Plan to hike 15 tomorrow which puts us at mile 592 ish. Then catch worship service on Easter morning.The picture on this post was taken at Overmountain Shelter which is in North Carolina. There is a huge barn that was converted to a shelter. The evening was gorgeous. There were probably 20 tents set up in this beautiful green pasture out in front of the barn. It is located on this gap that was on the route used by the Overmountain Men, during the Revolutionary War. They crossed the mountain from Tennessee to join forces with Carolina militia to engage battle with Patrick Ferguson, in the decisive Battle of Kings Mountain. The British lost. A distant grandfather of mine (Adam Sherrill) and the distant grandfather (George Wilfong) of a good friend fought in this battle together. Though they were both from North Carolina and would not have used this route, I couldn’t help but feel a kindred spirit to those who had gone this way , to join my ancestors in battle.","

Yesterday was hot and most of the day was thru dead forests. Not that they hadn’t budded yet. They were just dead. For miles. I don’t know if it was something like the ash borer beetle back home, but something had killed a lot of trees. We still had occasional views from ledges. Once Halo told me we had a cliff coming up. He was bluffing. Views were pretty, though. Settled down for the evening about 3 miles from Pearisburg Va. Really nice spot called out as a water source. The picture posted is one that Doc took of me, Halo, RG, and Stingray. It’s at a spot called the Pearisburg Ledges (because it overlooks Pearisburg). Currently in Pearisburg. Took care of some tax stuff at the local library. Resupplied at Dollar General ( I hate resupply because your food bag is so heavy!). Tonight we are trying La Barranca, a local Mexican restaurant that has good reviews.So far I’ve seen deer, turkey, black snake, water snake, heard grouse and woodpeckers.

He’s been with me the entire time, but occasionally enjoys “hiding” from me. I’ve always been able to find him and reconnect. When I take a day and go into town, he stays on the trail and waits for me. I think he looks a lot like “Wilson” who was in the movie with Tom Hanks (called Castaway).

Shortly thereafter we came across thie really big timber rattler that’s in the picture. At least 4’ long.

There is a huge rock formation where you turn off to go to the shelter that looks like one of those Easter Island head.The priest shelter is funny because hikers use the shelter log as a confessional for all the wrongs they’ve committed on the trail. Very humorous!

Halo confessed that he should have hiked out an avocado seed, but buried it instead. I confessed that when he asked if it was me, would I pack it out. I told him I would. But I confessed that I was lying. 
It rain torrential amounts on us. Stingray said he began to be concerned when he saw animals filing by - two by two. Water splashed into my tent thru the netting and got everything pretty wet. Good news was yesterday afternoon I was able to hang a line and dry it out.
So we went from The Priest to hiking down Devils Backbone. Unfortunately, the devil got me. I fell really hard on my right shin. Hiked/limped remaining miles to Reed Gap where we caught a free shuttle to the Devils Backbone Brewery. They have really good food. I was fortunate to get a ride today to get it looked at.

Hiking on it yesterday and today, it’s nearly back to normal. We spent last night at a roadside picnic and camping area just off the Blueridge Parkway. The rain held off until wee hours of the morning. Rained on us all day (off and on). As we arrived at the trail junction for the sidetrail to humpback rocks, a young fellow hiked up. Asked if we were thru hikers. We said yes and he countered with “Want some donuts?” It took RG and I all of two seconds to spit out YES! He pulls off his pack and opens a variety pack of donuts. Just as RG and I select a donut, StingRay arrived. He offered him one, then Halo finishes the trail magic. As we all down a donut he explains that he thruhiked last year. Trail name is Duke. Then he offered us a ride into town, when we get there. We thanked him and went on our way. Throughout the day, for miles, we saw these stone walls, shown in the picture. Someone went to a lot of effort to build those. Almost seemed the closer we got to town, the steadier the rain got. When we finally arrived at Skyline Drive it was raining cats and dogs. We were looking for a shuttle to call, because it’s surprisingly cold the instant you stop hiking. Who immediately pulls up but . . . Duke! Talk about trail magic. He says get in. Four soaking wet hikers, muddy feet, with packs. And he’s as nice as can be. We pile in and are off to the Quality Inn. Spending the night here and zeroing tomorrow.

She looked like she was expecting soon. Just could have cared less that we were there. A little later, RG was in the lead and saw the rear end of a bear as it went galloping away down into the woods.

I asked about it and the lady told me it was from back during segregation and was the restaurant for black people. She said the food was so good, the white people wanted to eat there, but weren’t allowed to eat there. Got up early and hit the trail, doing about 17 miles. At one point, we heard noise on the hillside above us. Then saw a Bear loping along ahead of us. About 30 yards out it turned and crossed the trail, galloping off down the hill. It amazes me how an animal that large can go crashing down the mountain and not injure itself. This bear was probably a yearling. I would describe it as a teenager. Not that big but not a cub.",,View Entry,"May 17, Fri",0
Question Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614770,"We are at mile 1066. Just crossed into Pennsylvania. Back at Front Royal my folks sent an amazing trail magic drop box. They had no idea, but Halo had just mentioned earlier in the day that he was craving an apple. Apples were one of the many things found inside. Thx mom and dad! Everyone is enjoying your generosity! A few days ago we hit the 1000 mile mark. Shortly thereafter we crossed from Virginia to West Virginia. West Virginia as a very small piece of the trail at only 4 miles or so. Stopped by the ATC and had our pictures taken, where we were Very surprised by some very special trail magic. Halo’s neighborhood pitched in and had balloons, a couple of congratulations signs, a huge cake, and hiker resupply goody bags. Amazing. It was cool because it was so much more than we could use, so Halo became the very generous host, making sure each visitor got cake and shared some resupply. Everyone was very blessed. I bought new shoes. Hard to believe the ones I had hiked with had over 500 miles on them. Leaving Harpers Ferry ( which is a cool historic place) puts you in Maryland. I think there were something like 32ish miles in Maryland. We were excited to see the first Washington monument which is an old stone tower. They were currently renewing the mortar so it was fenced and covered in scaffold. On the way there we received some awesome trail magic from Joe and Karen. They fed us pulled pork, mac’n cheese, sodas, fruit salad, candy, on and on!
Tonight we stopped of at Pen Mar Park which is a very historic area. Back in its hay day before turn of the century they peaked at having over 20,000 visitors a day. Weather last night in the tents was pretty crazy with downpours of rain, close lightning and thunder, and hail. So at Pen Mar we threw our tents out in the sun to dry while we ordered pizza and had it delivered. After dinner we headed out to our tent sites for the night (about .8 miles up the trail) on the way we crossed the Mason–Dixon line. A guy in the park told me it was surveyed because of borderline disputes between Pennsylvania and Maryland. Tonight we settled in by a beautiful stream .",,View Entry,"May 28, Tue",0
Question Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615186,"Yesterday morning we started a little later. The early part of the hike was along a ridge line with outcropping huge boulders that we zigzagged around and thru and over. Pine forest with pine needle bedded trail. Incredibly beautiful. It then flattened out to a meandering black soil walkway thru huge growth, varied with stretches of densely arranged rocks from softball to basketball size, where you had to carefully choose each step.We stopped off for second breakfast at Caledonia Sate Park. It’s a gorgeous park. The pool was not yet open due to a filter system repair that was being made. However, We enjoyed ice cold sodas from the vending machine at the office. A short time later we stopped for lunch at Quarry Gap Shelter. Rates in the top five shelters! Two log open faced structures with a covered dog run between, housing a picnic table, then Two wooden tent platforms, Another small pavilion with picnic table, a beautiful swing, nice clean privy, planted and hanging flowers everywhere, and a sundial. Then we were fortunate enough to get to meet Jim, the guy who designed, built, and maintains it. Super nice fellow and what an honor. We missed seeing the two rattlesnakes reported my Southbounders but did catch trail magic at Milesburn Cabin. Then 1/4 mile further, got more trail magic from a group of guys that were just out camping and cooking hotdogs for hikers. Found ourselves at Birch Run shelter where we rented for the night at mile 1094. Weather was cool. Perfect for sleeping.",,View Entry,"Jun 01, Sat",0

We had planned to hike in, eat breakfast, resupply, and hike on. However instead, while eating breakfast, in walks Sunshine. She’s off trail for now with plantar facitis and slack packing her husband Bluegrass. It was so good to see her. She and Bluegrass were at the Laughing Heart I think, last time I saw them. So Sunshine took us to resupply, brought us to the basement of the Assembly of God parsonage where we repackaged our supplies and readied to leave.

Had second breakfast on a log. Lunched at the next shelter and relaxed for a while. Papa Smurf stopped in. Surprisingly, he left Springer Mountain the exact same day as RG and Stingray but they had never met. Then in walks Bluegrass! So good to see him!! He and his wife Sunshine are so lovable. He stayed for lunch as we hiked on. Got to our target location and there was a local day hiker already set up. The site had several tent spots - more than enough for all of us. However, he strung a clothesline across two of the tent sites, and spread out enough to take up the rest of the space. So, we hiked on. Found a decent spot just up the trail. Unfortunately there was no water. Stingray and I hiked .4 miles ahead to a source on the trail. All downhill. The source was a trickle. It took forever to fill one two liter bag and we needed two more. Up walks Bluegrass and offers a liter of water, because he’s meeting Sunshine shortly.

As we left the parking area to head up the trail, what is there in the path but three sodas, three Halo tangerines, and the kindest note from Sunshine and Bluegrass. I know it sounds silly, but an ice cold soda is SO good! Thx again guys.We hiked past several very old coal mines. Lunched at a place called Yellow Springs. It had been a settlement in 1850 of about 1000 people. Old foundations, coal excavation sites, and the well in the photo. Cool spot.When we got to our destination, once again we got early birded by local hikers out for the weekend. So we hiked on.

Over the top kindness!Jimmy and his wife “I Believe” caught up with us there, as did Halo’s wife. We slack packed some and got off at PA309. At this point it was my turn to take off for a bit. I went home for a few days and had a delightful time! The picture is in one of the tunnels on the Pennsylvania Turnpike.

Having gone home and getting back on the trail, I found myself hiking until I was tired, then hitting the sack instead of journaling. I have caught up with Halo, RG, and Stingray (about three nights back). It’s good to be reconnected. Last night we spent on top of Black Mountain with a great view of the New York cityscape. We saw fireworks from the smaller towns nearby.Then just before Bear Mountain, we encountered the best spread of trail magic I have seen. They had a fruit table. They were preparing hot dogs and fried eggs. They had salad, Chinese style noodles, meatballs, veggie eggrolls, ice cold sodas, and on and on! I ate three plates of watermelon and tomatoes! It was so good!We then hiked over Bear Mountain. Lots of visitors to the park. The trail actually goes right thru the zoo there. I think it’s the lowest elevation on the trail. We then crossed the Hudson River and hiked a few miles to a great deli. I had a bacon and tomato with avocado on grilled cheese. Best sandwich ever! I’m making those at home, now. Delicious.We finished out the day with about a mile walk to a place run by the Franciscans. They graciously allow thru hikers to tent on their ballfield, use the pavilion and picnic tables, portable toilets, and use their (cold) shower. Probably 15 hikers utilizing the facility. Very nice.","

Question Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618207,"So last night was interesting. We had pulled into a campsite for tenting. They had a pavilion, privy, Bear box, hand pump water source, and a deck. Very nice. It’s about dinner time and everyone is about their business of eating or preparing supper. About this time, we all hear a loud crack and a huge tree limb swings down, just missing a guys tent (Golden Walker). We all breathe a sigh, that it missed, then it swings back - just missing again! Yikes that was close. Then it gives away from the tree and drops onto its bushy branches. Then , tumbling down, comes the heavy limb end. It’s going down slow but looks like it’s going to flatten the tent! As it continues to drop, it sort of rolls, just missing.We were all a daze. Golden Walker just says something like, “Reminds me I need to pay my homeowners insurance “. Close one. Today was tough! I don’t know what the temperature got to, but it took it out of me. Even stopping multiple times, I was struggling. It’s amazing how wonderful it is to soak your feet in a cold stream for a while! We ended the day just short of Falls Village Ct. I think at mile 1491? Right now it’s drizzling away as we hunkered down in our tents. Earlier we had quite a lightning display.","

Crossed the border into Massachusetts a little while ago. We stopped at this gorgeous stream for lunch. Halo laughed at me when I said it was pretty enough to be a beer commercial. 
Surprising how delightful a lunch of grape drink mix, beef jerky, wheat thins, and Nutter Butter peanut butter sandwich cookies are! Some of it might be the ambiance?
We may get to Great Barrington today. Not sure. It’s cool to know we have hiked far enough North, that due West is Canada. A real sense of accomplishment.Sadly, we continue to hear of friends who are leaving the trail. Although, that’s not always bad for them, I just have hope that everyone who attempts the hike, would be able to succeed.

It was a “Nero” (nearly a zero) and very much needed. We stayed in the Shamrock Hotel. We resupplied and got a late start  out of town. We hadn’t planned a big day, but ultimately ended up hiking to the summit of Mt Greylock. It’s a really cool place. Fixed dinner up on top and watched the sunset. Gorgeous.

Regrettably we missed out on meeting up with Pilgrim and his family today. Tonight is beautiful, and today’s hike was wonderful. Just what I invisioned Vermont to look like.

Question Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619635,"Well, I’m overdue for this entry. I was fortunate enough to have family come out and join us for several days. We hiked Stratton Mountain and several other sections including Prospect Rock Overview. Absolutely beautiful. We finished up in Manchester Center, which is a really cool place. They were so gracious to take us to dinner at Cilantros. The street tacos with verde salsa were to die for! (Oh, the highlights of a thruhiker!) From there, we said goodby.
We hiked that day, then Halo’s wife surprised him there with a birthday cake , balloons, and the makings for a party. Everyone there enjoyed the vegetable tray and cheese tray. The cake was still being eaten when we left. We slack packed for two days (Halo calls it active recovery). The second day was rainy and miserable, but we were saved from the rain by a dear family we met and hiked with in Pennsylvania. It was Yalla’s dad. You just couldn’t find more gracious hospitality! He bought pizzas for us and brought us to his home, where RG and Stingray were staying! It was so heartwarming to see Stingray and RG again. I have come to love them as family. 
RG has now hiked with us two days. Last night we spent by this boulder lined stream with cascading water as the visual and audible backdrop for the best nights sleep ever! This morning as I looked at all the serenity and beauty around me, I was able to remember to thank the Lord. Thankfulness is something that’s so easy to forget to do, at least for me. I am blessed with so much more than I deserve.
 I forgot to mention that a couple of days ago, we were hiking thru a campground, and this lady yells “Halo” and comes running from this tent site. Turns out, it’s a lady we met back in Maryland on the trail. She and two of her sons plus a friend were camping with us the night it thundered and lightening and rained and hailed. They had a tent malfunction and we helped get it set back up. And here they are vacationing in Vermont and run into us. We had a great visit. Later, last night I wished I had thought to take a picture. Then today, at the end of our hike, Hopeful (that’s the mom) pulls into the lot and yells “Q”. She’s picking up the family at the trailhead. So we were able to get a family photo. I’m so happy we saw them one more time. Terrific family!

Question Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619809,"Today we woke in northern Vermont about 5 miles from New Hampshire. We made short work of it and soon found ourselves in Hanover, New Hampshire. As we neared the Dartmouth campus, a posted sign described an option of stopping by one of the cafeterias and a student would scan you in on their meal plan (to use up their meal credits). We weren’t too sure about it, but made our way to Robinson Hall. Nearly immediately, two young ladies spotted us and offered to scan us in. Once inside, we were treated like kings. They were serving breakfast at the time, and we commenced to partake of one of the best breakfasts we’ve had on trail. We ate and ate. They encouraged us to eat all we wanted. As we continued eating, we noticed the dining area thinned out for the gap between breakfast and lunch. Before we knew it, they were putting a spread on for lunch. I’m somewhat embarrassed to admit that we enjoyed lunch, also. Needless to say, I am very impressed with Ivy League dining! Thank you Dartmouth (and to the students who share their meal plan) for your kind hospitality!
We are sharing a hotel room amongst the three of us in White River Junction. 
I also picked up a pair of new shoes (these should last the remainder of the hike). Got some really nice New Balance Crag trail runners. Shout out to New Balance! These are great shoes.","

We did one overnight from their home, and are now doing a two night outing, then plan to slack pack three days straight. We are so thankful for their kind generosity!
Earlier yesterday we took a side trail to the site of a plane crash. It was sad, knowing lives were lost there. Also unbelievable that there were survivors. 
Our miles per day have really dialed back in these challenging terrains. The views here are stunning with ripe blueberries everywhere on the mountain tops.
I went down pretty hard today on my right knee with all my weight (plus the pack) right on a rock. For several hours I feared I might have injured it, but as the day passed, functionality returned. Yay! I have been so blessed with good health through out this adventure!It feels like we are in the home stretch with less than 300 miles to go.

Question Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622549,"Well, it’s been the journey and adventure of a lifetime! Yesterday marked the finish of a task I started over 6 months ago. It seemed a little surreal, approaching Katahdin. The mountain has a unique profile and looms magnificently alone in its home there in Baxter State Park in Maine. Much of it is above tree line. Multiple trails lead to the summit, however only the Hunt Trail is considered part of the AT. So that’s how we found our way up. I told Halo it’s much like in school, when you study each chapter, and have a chapter test. . . Like steep assents early on, rocks in Pennsylvania, mud in Vermont, roots in Maine, etc. Then this trail is like the final. You get tested on everything you’ve done. Steep assents. Water crossing. Roots. Rocks. Hand over hand rock scramble. It was fun. Upon reaching the top, RG, Halo, and I were the only thru hikers finishing their journey. There were probably 30 or so hikers at the summit. They were so kind to give us time to take our photos and sort of process the completion of our efforts. They graciously cheered for us upon arrival and continued to compliment each of us. We were truly treated like celebrities. It was very humbling and a bit embarrassing. I was a bit emotional, and my heart was very full. We came down a less challenging trail on the back side of the mountain. It was a long walk to the car, which allowed more time to process. In some ways it still hasn’t “sunk in”. Being finished. I couldn’t have had better comrades to have accompanied me on this trip. RG, Halo, and Stingray are men among men and inspired me regularly. I am honored to have walked alongside them.To any who have read my sparse entries, I offer genuine apology for the scarcity of words.

Surprisingly, I think that time will go very quickly.Additionally, I was very surprised that I now have the honor of helping a past thru-hiker, named ""Trip"" (Class of 2012), who is now a librarian and she has contacted me regarding a group of students who will research the trail by reading thru-hiker journals (if I got it correct).
