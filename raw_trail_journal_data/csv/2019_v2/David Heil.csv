David Heil,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609022,"Hey everybody. Welcome to my Trail Journal.  This will probably be my only post until I actually get on trail April 24th.  I'm not sure how much I'll actually be writing, but the plan is to at least keep everyone updated with my location, and be able to post pictures and videos.  
If I haven't seen you recently, I'll give you the basics. I'm starting April 24th at Springer Mountain Georgia and plan to hike 2,200 miles to Mount Katahdin Maine.  The trail crosses 14 states, and usually takes 4 to 6 months.  I will be sleeping in either my tent, or one of the shelters along the trail.  The shelters are spaced 5 to 15 miles apart.  They are primitive three sided wooden shelters with just enough protection from wind and rain.  I'll carry enough food to get me from one trail town to the next, where I'll resupply for the next stretch.  Typically, I'll have a resupply every 4 to 7 days.  I don't plan on mailing myself any drop boxes, but that could change.  And lastly, NO I'm not taking a gun.  Hiking the Appalachian trail is statistically a very safe venture.  Aside from the occasional black bear or rattlesnake sighting, I should be just fine.  Now lightning and ticks are a different story, but a gun wouldn't help much with those anyway.
To see a list of exactly what I'm taking...

I decided to return my Garmin satellite messenger.  It wasn't as reliable as advertised.  So, the best way to keep in touch is through my cellphone or email.  Keep in mind, I'll spend most of the day with very little cell service, so don't expect a timely response.  Usually I'll only check for service at a summit or on a ridge line.
Most of you know I did a ""shakedown"" hike a few weeks back.  I started at Standing Bear Farm and Hostel at mile marker 240 of the Appalachian Trail.  It's just outside the Smokey Mountains off I-40 in North Carolina.  I went north over Max Patch, then turned around and came back.  https://www.google.com/maps/pl...
Other than two 25 degree nights, everything went well.  I made a few tweaks to my gear list, but happy with everything overall.  Here's the pictures...Sorry I didn't get a picture of the bear.

That's it for now.  Hopefully I'll have a chance to post something from Neel Gap at mile 30.  It's my first resupply and hopefully my first shower.  Wish me Luck.
Dave
