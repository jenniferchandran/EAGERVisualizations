First day on the trail. Foggy, a sprinkle or two, 60s. Met lots of hikers on trail, ate late lunch at hawk shelter. Crowded, but folks in good spirits. I hiked on to Devils Kitchen camp site. Took advantage of decent weather and trail conditions and hike steadily today. Stopped about 5:30to set up tent and eat dinner. Around  8:15, rain, lightning and thunder started. Stunning light and sound show that seemed to be1 foot above my tent. It rained all night and shower til 11ish today.Many thanks to my brother Jim, Ann, Amy, Jeff, my brother Tim and four great dogs in NC. They fed me, got me to fuel canisters, took me on wonderful dog walks, told great stories and  drove me to Springer Mtn. Jim even hiked the first few miles with me. He drew the line at carrying the pack!","Springer Mountain

Showers to 11, then windy and partly cloudy the rest of the day. The trail damp, with occasional stretches of puddles from rain or little springs. The last 4 miles were up Blood Mtn and down very steep, rocky and wet trail. Made to Neil’s Gap and a gear shop and hostel called Mountain Crossing (google it if you want, the shoe tree is a hoot) stayed at the hostel. A church group graciously supplied “trail magic” barbecue pulled pork dinners and  fixens to all thru hikers. I repeatedly thanked them and professed a new found love for the great state of Georgia!","Devils Kitchen

The wind howled last night. The first hikers that stepped out of the hostel in the morning screamed and yelled, nobody wanted to follow them!
That said, after I warmed up, it was a good hiking day with more free food at a road crossing. Phenomenal food and hot coffee from Bob and Misty. I again professed my love of the people of Georgia! No leaves on the trees, so the views of surrounding mountains are great. With all the great food and descent trail conditions I was able to hike from noon to 6:30ish with no desire to stop. The shelter is on top and it was very cold. I wore everything I had, wrapped my feet with my windbreaker, hopped in the bag inside the tent and was warm all night. A guy named Turtle had a nice fire going and we had a great sunset.","
