Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555263,"Hi! I’m Opa, and I’ve been dreaming about thru-hiking the AT for quite a few years, and have been planning the hike in earnest for the past several years. I will be starting my hike in early Feb. 2018, shortly after I retire at the age of 66. I’ve done a fair amount of weekend backpacking and hiking in my home state of New York, primarily in the Adirondack Mountains – and have also completed some sections of the AT (primarily in New Hampshire and Maine), but have never tackled anything even remotely as ambitious as a 2,189-mile backpack! I don’t know how my body is going to hold out, but mentally I feel I’ll be able to deal with whatever the trail throws at me. Time will tell.
I am very fortunate to have the support of both my wife Kayanne, and my family. Kayanne initially wasn’t thrilled with the idea of me being away for 5-6 months, but a couple years ago she graciously gave me her blessing to pursue my AT adventure. Thank you Kayanne, I couldn’t possibly undertake an AT thru-hike, let alone have any chance of completing it, without your support. I am a luck guy! My family has also been very supportive. Several family members have even volunteered to join me along the way and complete a section hike to keep me company. I will miss my family a great deal while on-trail, so having them join me along the way will be a delight!
For family reasons I plan on being off-trail during the summer. My plan at present is to hike from early Feb. to early June starting at Springer Mt., then return to the trail (at the same location where I got off) in late-August to complete the trail and finish on Katahdin. My understanding of the criteria is that as long as I complete the entire AT in a single calendar year, then it counts as an official thru-hike. I am a goal oriented type of person, so it’s important for me to complete my hike in a manner that qualifies it as a thru-hike.
I plan on posting to Trail Journals as often as I can while on my hike. I am still a year away, but it will go quickly. In the meantime I will continue to plan for, and dream about, my hike.",,View Entry,"Feb 27, Mon",0

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557691,"I've accumulated some nice backpacking gear over the years, but there's a few items of new/replacement gear I need before undertaking my 2018 AT thru hike. Whenever I discuss a new piece of gear with Kayanne, I tell her ""....but Schatzie, this is essential gear, it may save my life....."" she just rolls her eyes and tries to ignore me. Anyway, I've decided to buy a new pack for the AT. I own an Osprey Aether, and don't get me wrong it's a great pack - just a little heavy, and a bigger pack than I need for the AT. I need to cut weight wherever I can. I've been researching packs, and have decided to go with a pack from Gossamer Gear, the Mariposa 60. I ordered it this weekend, can't wait. It has received great reviews, has all the features I want, and only weighs 33 oz.",,View Entry,"Mar 25, Sat",0
Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/561474,"I've been reading a fair number of books about the AT over the past couple of years, and have really enjoyed the varying accounts/stories. Some make you want to laugh, and some to cry - but they are all interesting, and I feel myself both enriched and better prepared when I eventually set out on my own AT thru-hike in 2018. My thanks to the various authors who have taken the time to share their experiences. I've read a few differing opinions as to whether or not you should ""advertise"" the fact that you'll be attempting a thru-hike. There's one school of thought that says you should not tell a lot of people, this way if you fail you won't feel quite as embarrased. The opposing school of thought says that you should tell everybody - family of course (Kayanne would really be ticked if I just suddenly disappeared for 6 months w/o telling her), but also relatives, friends, co-workers, casual acquaintances, the checkout clerk at the supermarket, etc. etc. The idea with telling ""everybody"" is that you will be less inclined to quit, on those days when you are really having a tough day and are tempted to cry uncle. Well, I've decided to align myself with the school of thought that says ""advertise"" - part of the problem being that I really enjoy hiking, I can talk your ear off about hiking, and I'm so excited about my upcoming AT thru-hike that I can't help myself and just blurt out to everybody I know that I'll be attempting a thru-hike in 2018. I guess I've really set myself up for embarrasment should I have to end my hike before Kathadin. I'll take my chances.",,View Entry,"Apr 24, Mon",0

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/576413,"My grandson Link and I were in the Adirondacks for a few days in mid-August. What a grand time we had, completing 2 day hikes and summiting 3 high peaks (Giant, Rocky Peak and Big Slide). We stayed right at the ADK Loj, they do a great job there. Link just turned 8, and has now summited a total of 7 of the 46 high peaks in the Dacks. Link was a real trooper on the trail, no complaing at all when the going was challenging. I am so proud of him!!!! No sooner had we completed our hikes, when we both started discussing next year's trip. It truly warms my heart to think that I'm helping instill a love of hiking in my grandson!",,View Entry,"Aug 29, Tue",0
Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/578281,"I cannot believe that in less than 5 months I'll be on the AT.  How 'bout that!  I remain committed to, and obsesive about, my pending adventure. I've read that before embarking, one should write down a list of one's reasons for wanting to complete an AT thru hike.  Well, here I go with my reasons.
Reason No. 1:  I want to prove to myself that I can meet this awesome challenge - both physically and mentally. A 2,190 mile backpack completed in a single calendar year is one heck of a challenge, and I've got something to prove!
Reason No. 2:  I want to complete the AT for my wonderful grandkids. Maybe someday, at a time in each of their lives when they are faced with their own challenge, they'll be inspired by their old Opa.  Maybe they'll say to themselves that Hey, if Opa can hike the AT, then I can overcome my challenge as well. Who knows, maybe they'll someday even be inspired to undertake their own AT thru hike - now wouldn't that be grand!
Reason No. 3: I am at a point in my life that a thru hike of the AT will provide a very nice transition in my life - from working full time, to being retired. I'll be able to ponder what to do with the rest of my remaining years on this earth - however long the good Lord decides to grant me. Heck, I'll probably be thinking such deep thoughts on my hike that I will have discovered the true meaning of life. Kayanne, you better be ready for me upon my return, because I'll be loaded to the hilt with all kinds of wild and crazy ideas for how you and I can spend our retirement!
Reason No.4: It is my understanding that there's just over 500 people 60 or older that have completed an AT thru hike. That's a relatively small number. I'd like to add my name to that list!
There you have it, my list of reasons for wanting to successfully complete an AT thru hike. I of course love to backpack, and the sense of adventure that will come with being on the trail. I also look forward to meeting new people, seeing new sights, and just being out in the woods away from the busyness of the world.  All true enough, but when the going gets tough, and the chips are down, I will come back to my 4 Reasons to remind myself why I need to keep going and finish. Can't wait to get started!",,View Entry,"Sep 23, Sat",0
Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/579267,"Needed a new pair of hiking boots. I debated a long time whether or not to go with/without GTX, I've worn both over the years. GTX certainly helps keep feet drier longer, although my experience is that if hiking in an all day rain and the trails are muddy and running with water, feet eventually get wet. GTX also takes a long time to dry out. Nevertheless I went with GTX mid height boots, my reason being that when starting out in Feb. I want the benefit of GTX.
Purchased this week a pair of Vasque Breeze III GTX at REI. Why is it that boots always feel more comfortable in a store setting??? Went for a short hike today and they didn't feel all that great. Oh well, I have plenty of time to break them in.",,View Entry,"Oct 08, Sun",0

I am getting more and more anxious/excited with each passing day - not only about the start of my AT journey, but also about my rapidly approaching retirement. My last official day of work will be 01/19/18. No longer going to the office, being involved with projects and interacting with others will be a big adjustment. Glad that I'll be on the trail hiking to keep me busy!
I gave a presentation last week to the Adirondack Mountain Club Genesee Valley Chapter on winter mountaineering. I've been a member of the Rochester Winter Mountaineering Society (RWMS) for about a dozen years, and have had the good fortune of leading their annual January Intro Trip the last 2 years. The presentation was well attended and there were many younger ADK members in attendance, which was encouraging. RWMS, like many organizations, is in need of younger members to fill in the ranks after old guys like me start thinking about taking it easy. RWMS is having its annual trip planning meeting for the 2018 winter season on 11/09. I plan on attending, we'll see where it goes.",,View Entry,"Oct 16, Mon",0
Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/580706,"Well I decided to weigh my Big Four today: pack (Gossamer Gear Mariposa 60), sleeping bag (Western Mountaineering Versalite with a Sea to Summit liner), tent (Six Moon Designs Lunar Solo with stakes and a ground cloth) and sleeping pad (Thermarest Neoair). I was very pleased with the result: 7.5 lbs. 
They say that you want to keep the weight of these 4 items under 10 lbs., so I think I’m in good shape. If I can keep my total pack weight under 30 lbs including water and 5 days worth of food, I’ll be ecstatic. 
My pack and sleeping bag are both recent purchases. I now own 3 backpacks and 4 sleeping bags (a very lightweight 45 degree synthetic, a 20 degree synthetic, a minus 20 degree down for my winter trips, and now this new 10 degree Western Mountaineering down for my AT through hike) but they each serve a purpose for the right kind of trip. My sleeping bag was a bit on the expensive side, but hey, this is a once in a lifetime trip for me so I figured it was worth it. Kayanne just kind of rolls her eyes whenever I pick up a new piece of gear, but she’s overall a good sport about it. I tell her “...Schatzie, this new piece of gear could save my life...” but I think I may have gone to the well a few times too often with that one!",,View Entry,"Nov 21, Tue",0

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582324,"The Appalachian Trail (AT) is a 2,190 mile long hiking trail that runs thru 14 states.  The termini are Springer Mt. in Georgia and Mt. Katahdin in Maine.  The trail has many ups/downs, some sections of which comprise steep climbs/descents, while other sections are gently rolling.  The elevation along the trail ranges from 124 to 6,625 ft.  In terms of elevation gain, here's an impressive statistic:  completing an AT thru hike is equivalent to climbing 29,035 ft. Mt. Everest 16 times from sea level.  The sections of the trail in New Hampshire and Maine are considered the most difficult.  Every year about 3,000 people attempt a thru-hike in a single calendar year, with about 1 in 4 successfully completing this undertaking.  Most people require 5-7 months to complete a thru-hike, and approx. 80% of thru-hikers are northbounders (NOBOs) that begin their hike at Springer Mt.  Thru-hikers come in all ages and from all walks of life.  More than half of all thru-hikers are in their 20s;  in total approximately 500 individuals age 60 and above have successfully completed a thru-hike.  In addition to thru-hikers, there are section hikers and day hikers that also use the trail.
The trail is marked by 2"" x 6"" white paint marks, or blazes, along its entire length.  There are 3-sided shelters (aka lean-tos up north) along the trail spaced on average 8 miles apart, but it is essential that one carry a tent (shelters can become full during peak season;  privacy;  off-trail camping as circumstances arise;  etc.).  Frequent road crossings provide ready access via. a short hike, hitchhiking, shuttle service, etc.  to resupply points, and it is seldom necessary to carry more than 5-6 days worth of food - the notable exception being the 100-mile wilderness in Maine.  Sources of water (springs, creeks, rivers, ponds, etc.) are frequent, except during periods of drought.  Water must be either treated  or filtered to minimize the risk of illness from water borne organisms such as Giardia Lamblia and Cryptosporidium that can lead to serious illness.  Most, but not all, hikers carry a stove so they can prepare a daily hot meal.  The average thru-hiker will burn 5,000 or so calories/day, and it is difficult to both carry sufficient food and consume that many daily calories.  Weight loss is a constant battle.
The AT was first conceived by US Forest Service employee Benton MacKaye in 1921.  Completed in 1937, the AT was the longest marked footpath at the time.  The first official thru-hike was completed by Earl Shaffer in 1948, although his accomplishment was met with much skepticism and disbelief.  In 1965 Shaffer completed a southbound thru-hike, becoming the first person to complete a thru-hike in both directions.  The AT is one of three trails that makeup the triple crown of long-distance trails, the other 2 being the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) and Continental Divide Trail (CDT).",,View Entry,"Jan 22, Mon",0
Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582361,"Now that I’m retired I’ve lost the ability to continue with one of my workout routines. Every weekday I’d spend 25 minutes going up/down stairs in the morning at my workplace (CityPlace) with a light pack, then twice a week after work 45 minutes in the stairtower with a full pack. I still jog every day, but bummer, the stairtower is where it was at.
Well, trying to be resourceful and not willing to pay gym membership for the few remaining weeks till the start of my AT hike, I’ve been looking for a place to resume some climbing.

I must admit, laying everything out it was an impressive display. Looking at everything, I wondered to myself “....how is all this stuff going to fit into my Gossamer Gear Mariposa 60 pack....and what is it going to weigh....”. 
Well, I managed to get everything into my pack with room to spare for food, but it came in at 21 lbs.  This does not include any food or water. Not bad considering I’m hitting the trail on 02/10 and will be carrying some winter specific gear (e.g.microspikes), some of which I’ll be able to send home after the Smokies. However, I know there’s a few items that I can do without so I’m going to re-evaluate, my goal being to have my base weight at no more than 20 lbs. 
Also my thanks to those of you that have signed my guest book and have offered me best wishes and support on my adventure, your comments are much appreciated. I was intending to respond to each of you individually via. email, but that may be problematic due to issues with the trailjournals website.

I keep going over my list of gear mentally trying to think if there’s anything I’ve forgotten, but I think I’m in good shape and have everything covered. No doubt when I’m on trail I’ll come to the realization that “...I should have brought this...I don’t need that...etc. etc....”, but that’s OK, it’s not like I’ll be that far away from civilization unable to make changes. Thankfully I’ll have my ace support team (aka Kayanne,) back home able to mail me something along the way. 
I have had a few little issues come up on the homefront since I retired 2 weeks ago. First my trusty 2003 Ford Explorer with 216,000 miles finally gave up the ghost (blown engine). I can’t complain, she served me well - guess the old gal decided to retire right along with me. Then I came down with the flu. Ugh. I was down with a fever for a couple days, but am recovering nicely thank you. I very seldom get sick, but better to get it over with now than on the trail. Finally my MP3 player that I listen to on my morning jogs also decided to call it quits. What do they say about things happening in 3’s, oh well, nothing that can’t be dealt with. These events did however remind me of that Rodney Dangerfield joke:  “...I went to get the mail and the mailbox door fell off...I went to get in the car and the door handle fell off...I went to go back in the house and the doorknob fell off.....Jeez, I’m afraid to go to the bathroom....”.",,View Entry,"Jan 31, Wed",0

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582788,"It is finally here, the long anticipated start of my AT adventure. I am feeling a lot of emotions right now, and I’m not even on the trail yet!  Not sure how I’m going to fare tomorrow when God willing I’m standing on the summit of Springer Mt. 
Yesterday I got myself a buzz cut and shaved off my beard. It’s probably been 30 years since I’ve been clean shaven. When I look at myself in the mirror post haircut/shave, I think to myself “...man, you are one ugly and scary looking dude...”. I’m thinking even the bears won’t come near me now, HaHa!
The first leg of my adventure starts with my Amtrak ride from Rochester, NY to Gainesville, GA. My good friend Bill Schweinfurth met me at the train station in Rochester to see me off bright and early at 5:30 AM, what a nice surprise that was!  I am on the train right now, doing a little reading/texting and watching the scenery go by enjoying the trip. Folks have been needling me a bit, telling me that the train ride might be the most dangerous part of my whole trip in view of the recent accidents that Amtrak has had. Whoa Nellie, we’ll see how she goes - but let me tell you, I had to transfer trains in Penn Station in NYC and that is one crazy place! It’ll be good to be hiking.
One thing I don’t have to worry about at least is things on the home-front. My wife Kayanne is in full support of my thru hike, and I know she will do a great job of managing things at home while I’m away. We also have a fantastic support network of family and friends who will jump in and assist her with whatever hiccups life throws her way while I’m gone. What a relief that is to me, I am grateful. Thank you Kayanne, family and friends!  They say that an AT thru hike is as much a mental challenge as it is a physical challenge, so knowing that things are in order at home is huge!  Mentally I feel ready.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582817,"Amtrak was about 2 hrs late, but shuttle driver Ron Brown was great and met me right as I got off the train. I was on the trail hiking at 10:30, starting at Amicalola Falls State Park. The approach trail is 8.8 miles to the summit. These miles obviously don’t count, hence my total trail journals mileage is only 0.2. I am spending the nite in Springer Mt. shelter as opposed to my tent in view of the weather. I want to try and keep my trail journals mileage accurate in terms of where I am at the end of every day. I’m an engineer, am kinda anal about accurate records. Sorry, it comes with the territory. 
Overall it was a good day to be hiking. It did rain all afternoon, but at least the rain was vertical and not sideways. The trail was wet and muddy, but it wasn’t a creek and my boots didn’t get sucked off my feet (which can happen on some of the trails back home in the Dacks). The rain also provided a good shakedown of my rain gear,all systems are go. Also the temps were very mild. Hiking in the rain brought to mind that song in My Fair Lady: “....the rain in Spain lies mainly on the plain....I think she’s got it...I think she’s got it...”. Like i say, a good day for hiking. 
At the shelter tonite there’s one other person (Greg) also attempting a thru hike.  I did pass 2 other NOBO thru hikers on the trail early on today coming up from Amicalola, but I haven’t seen them since. Hope they are doing OK. The approach trail itself is a very well maintained and easy to follow trail, no issues. The only real steep area was at the falls, and there are stairs for that stretch. 
Amicalola Falls was spectacular to see, but the rain and fog quickly rolled in after that so there weren’t any views. It is good to be on the trail in any event, looking forward to tomorrow. Many thanks to those of you that have left well wishes in my guest book, much appreciated - I read every entry, your support means a lot!","Amicalola Falls State Park

Of course bear in mind that not all NOBOs register, as many begin the trail at the parking lot 1 mile from the summit of Springer. Oh, i also signed the log book (which is inside a stainless steel box set into a big rock) at the summit of Springer, but the log book was pretty darn wet when I pulled it out.
Last nite I was glad to stay in the shelter because let me tell you it rained cats and dogs! The only bad thing about the shelters is the darn mice, I had one son of a gun pestering me all nite. It’s too bad that some of the cats that came down in the rain didn’t come into the shelter,they would have had a field day with the mice Ha Ha. Anyway at least it was a warm nite, but damp - nothing wants to dry. 
Another late start this AM because the heavy rain didn’t let up till 10. Once Greg and I were hiking the trail wasn’t in bad shape considering all the rain. At the Springer parking lot we hooked up with another guy, younger fella goes by the trail name Big Load (he is carrying a behemoth pack), so it was the 3 of us on the trail. Somewhere along the way Greg dropped behind, not sure where he is but he’s an experienced guy so we’re not worried about him. 
Heavy rain started in again about 3 and the radar didn’t look good (another flash flood warning is in effect till 7 AM tomorrow morning), so Big Load and I elected to stay at Hawk Mt. Shelter for the nite. Kinda a bummer because I am feeling good and could have easily hiked another 7 miles or so, but nobody likes hiking in a torrential downpour - we made the right call. Hoping to do a big mileage day tomorrow. I am happy to report that my gear is all working well, and I am safe, warm and dry for the nite.","Springer Mt. Shelter

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/582909,"Today was a long day but a great day. Big Load and I got a 6 AM start, with our headlamps on.  No rain for a change but misty/foggy all morning. The afternoon turned out to be sunny and comfortably cool, a perfect afternoon for hiking. Really able to pound out the miles, 19.4 today. Nothing steep, but lots of ups and downs. Total climbing elevation for the day according to Guthooks was  4,585 ft. I must say that the trail so far has been in great shape, very nicely maintained, and minimal muddy patches even with all the rain we’ve been having.  Thanks to all the trail crews and volunteers for your hard work!
Decided to sleep in the tent tonite as opposed to the shelter, if for no other reason than to avoid the mice. I also find a tent to be a tad warmer than a 3-sided shelter. I am the only one here right now, not sure where Big Load is - he may be along later as we agreed this would be the rendezvous point. 
I came across 4 day hikers, but no other hikers. At Gooch Gap I came across a group of perhaps 12 Army soldiers, talked to the Master Sergeant briefly and they are from Camp Merrill on mountaineering training exercises. Told him that last nite I heard some rat-a-tat-tat fire and what sounded like mortars while staying at Hawks Mt. shelter and he noded agreement  - said I might hear more of the same tonite.
I did do something stupid today and missed a trail turn at Justus Creek, ended up following an old abandoned trail for about a half mile before realizing my mistake. Round trip it cost us a mile. I had a conversation with myself afterwards, it went something like this:  “PAY ATTENTION DUMMY....THE AT IS 2,191 MILES LONG....THERE’S NO GREAT HONOR IN NEEDLESSLY MAKING IT LONGER!!!!”

I’m sure the views would be spectacular, if only we could see them. Mountains climbed today included Blood (4,457 ft), Levellland, Cowrock, Wildcat and Poor. Very few level areas on the trail so far, you are either going uphill or downhill.
Stopped at Mountain Crossings in Neels Gap today to pick up the maildrop that I had sent to myself (yummy, more food), and killed a couple of hours. Originally I was planning on spending the nite in their bunkhouse, but I arrived so early (11ish) that I didn’t want to burn the daylight just hanging out. I did take a shower, even though I wasn’t that stinky/dirty (HaHa) - it did feel good to be clean again. Of course then I proceeded to put back on my stinky/dirty hiking clothes, which somewhat neutralized the cleansing effects of the shower. While at Mountain Crossings I hammered down a couple of pepperoni Hot Pockets (mmm) and 3 twinkees to tide me over for a couple hours. 
 As far as meals are concerned, my routine is a cold breakfast (poptarts, granola, fruit jells, etc) snacks during the day (trail mix, peanut butter, sausage, cheese, chocolate, etc), and a hot dinner. I have an alcohol stove and normally make a freeze dried meal, perhaps supplemented with some tuna. I do miss fresh fruits, vegetables & salads, but will survive. I am not a fussy eater, in fact in my family I am referred to as the garbage can because I will eat (and enjoy)pretty much anything you put in front of me.

Shelter, either in the shelter or in tents. I have elected to sleep in my tent in view of tonite’s weather forecast (more rain naturally with wind gusts of 25 mph).  I arrived at the shelter at 2, so I at least had a chance to air dry my sleeping bag and tent before setting up. Lots of condensation in my tent the last two nites, the air is just loaded with moisture. Everybody is in the same boat. It rained again today off and on. No sooner did it stop raining and I’d take my rain gear off, that it would start again. Mother Nature is messing with me. 
One good thing is that there’s plenty of water around, creeks and streams are all flowing full. I purify my water with chlorine dioxide (Aqua Mira), you absolutely have to either treat or filter or you take a chance of getting something nasty like Giardia. 
The plan for tomorrow is a relatively easy 11 mile hike to Dick’s Creep Gap, I will be spending the nite at Top of Georgia hostel. They have showers and laundry thank God - my clothes are quite disgusting by now, and were in all out revolt when I put them on this morning.

I need to do a better job orienting my tent properly, so that the vestibule/door is downwind. The way the tent is designed there’s maybe a 10” gap between the bottom of the vestibule and the ground. I’m certain this is to improve ventilation, but in a driving rain moisture gets into the vestibule and thru the rain screen, leading to moisture issues inside the tent. Nothing major, more of a nuisance. 
I was on the trail hiking at 4:30 today. It was pretty foggy, but I had no trouble making out the well defined trail in my headlamp. It’s about 7 before there’s enough daylight to see w/o the headlamp. At least the days are progressively getting longer. I was at Dick’s Creep Gap by 9:45, and at Top of Georgia Hostel by 10. This is a planned stop, spending the nite here, showering, doing laundry. An 11 mile day is my ideal definition of a NERO. A ZERO is a day with no miles. A NERO is a day with only a few miles. 
Have met several NOBOs so far, all seem to be great folks. A NOBO is a thru hiker heading northbound from Springer to Katahdin. I am a NOBO. Not everybody has a trail name yet, but here’s a few of folks that I’ve encountered:  Jeep, Captain Blackbeard, Vagabond Jack, Reese, Weeds and Zin Master. 
Top of Georgia is a great hostel, very clean, friendly staff, good place to take a break. A triple crowner by the trail name of Sir Packs a Lot runs the place, and has a wealth of information. A triple crowner is someone that has thru hiked the AT, Pacific Crest Trail and Continental Divide Trail. Quite a feat to say the least! They really cater to thru hikers here, e. g. giving you hospital scrubs to wear while doing your laundry. Sir Packs a Lot says that 25% of thru hikers call it quits by the time they reach Dick’s Creek Gap, so the odds are starting to improve. 
Several of us caught a shuttle into Hiawassee, ate at an AYCE buffet called Daniel’s Steak House. $8. They lost money on us thru hikers. We are all now hoping that we don’t come down with Montezumas Revenge on the trail tomorrow, but I will be carrying extra TP just in case.","Tray Mt. Shelter

Big milestone today crossing the GA/NC state line. 1 state down, only 13 to go. Excepting the weather I thought the AT in GA was great. Well maintained, well signed/marked, no super steep sections (lots of switcbacks), privys and shelters in good shape. Sir Packs A Lot says Georgia is the 4th hardest state along the AT. Not sure what metrics he uses, but he knows more about the AT and hiking than I’ll ever know so who am I to question.
Saw a big old black snake laying on the trail today. Not sure what kind of snake it was, but I gave it a wide berth. Other than squirrels and birds I haven’t seen much other wildlife. I can hear coyotes howling at nite off in the distance. 
I am hiking right now with 3 great guys that I hooked up with on the trail. We have a good group going. Everybody hikes at their own pace during the day so we are scattered up and down along the trail, but have been rendezvousing the last 3 nites. We call ourselves the 4 horsemen. The guys have told me that my trail name needs to be modified, they’ve suggested Pusher Opa and Lightning Opa. Ha Ha. Probably because I’m always suggesting we go some extra miles. I told them I’m going to stick with just plain Opa. 
Thanks again to all those folks offering encouragement via your guest book entries, very much appreciated. And thanks also to my family, friends, former colleagues and coworkers, my hiking buds from   RWMS and ADK GVC, for your supporting comments and texts - this means a lot.

We were initially planning on staying at Long Branch Shelter but there were folks there,  then at Rock Gap Shelter but that was full and there weren’t any good spots to pitch tents, so we elected to move on and hike all the way to Winding Stair Gap. Called for the shuttle from Gooder Grove AT Hostel and will be spending 2 nites there in Franklin, NC.  A ZERO day is planned for tomorrow, Sunday, my body needs time to recover.    The hiking today was pleasant enough (one big climb up Mt. Albert (elev. 5250, our first 5,000 footer on the trail), but once again we had rain. I’ve been on the trail now 8 days when the approach trail is included, and it has rained every single day. Not necessarily all day, but rain nonetheless. One statistic I heard was that for an AT thru hike, statistically you should figure 3 non-rain days for every rainy day. By my math Mother Nature owes me 24 nice, rain free days. If you want to give them all to me when I’m in New England , I’m cool with that.  I received my fIrst trail magic today, some Pay Day candy bars that were left along the side of the trail at Rock Gap. Trail magic is when some kind individual, sometimes a former thru hiker, leaves or offers food/snacks/drinks for AT hikers. The Pay Day candy bars were much appreciated, thank you!
As I mentioned in an earlier post I am hiking right now with 3 other NOBOs, we all started on/about the same date and just so happened to meet up on the trail. We are all early risers, and like pushing the miles. There is Nite Train, a 47 year old ex-Marine and Army vet recently retired. Nite Train saw action in Desert Storm and 3 tours of duty in Afghanistan and was highly decorated. He strikes me as the kind of person you’d want in your foxhole. There is also Jeep, a 48 year old resident of North Carolina. Jeep is a much in demand automotive painting tech for the largest such company in the US. Jeep is very knowledgeable about hiking and gear, and is easy to talk to. Then we have Captain Blackbeard, at 25 the young buck in our group. The Captain hails from Ocean City, New Jersey and has done some interesting things. He captains a pirate ship for tourists, runs a parasailing boat, and takes folks on fishing charters. These are all great guys, we get along well, like getting an eatly start and hiking long miles, and we have dubbed ourselves the Four Horsemen.

Went to 9:00 AM Sunday Mass at the local Catholic church,St Francis of Assisi, about a 15 minute walk from Gooder Grove Hostel. Next up was a hearty breakfast at a diner called Huddles. I sat next to a nice elderly (elderly, just like me) couple at the counter, we got to talking, and when I got up to leave they wished me well and said they would pray for me and for success on my AT adventure. Total strangers mind you. Brought tears to my eyes.
Spent most of the rest of the day doing a little resupply shopping, chillin out and eating. Lots of eating. The hearth breakfast as I mentioned, a sub/chips for lunch, and al all you can eat (AYCE) Asian buffet for dinner. Trying to cram as many calories as I can into this body of mine to get ready for the trail again tomorrow.

It felt good to be on the trail again. Don’t get me wrong, yesterday’s Zero was a welcome respite as we had an opportunity to eat some real food and give our muscles a chance to recover, but a Zero day just doesn’t feel right. In the future each of my hiking buddies and I agreed that a Nero is the much preferred option. A few miles is much better than no miles. Zeros have a way of catching up with you - sooner or later you have to pay the piper. 
Today’s hike included a climb over two significant peaks, Siler Bald (5,216) and Wayah Bald (5,342). They call them balds because on the summits there is a large grassy area without any trees. Unfortunately there were no views to be had as both summits were socked in. There is a stone tower on the Wayah summit. What a dank and dreary tower interior, I wouldn’t want to have to spend the nite there. Other than the climb over these 2 peaks, I thought much of today’s hike was rather mellow. Lots of long stretches with gentle grades. 
Our hike today started out with a light rain, and as we gained some elevation we were once again in the clouds/mist with very little visibility. Things started to clear up as the day went on, and the afternoon was rather pleasant. We arrived at our targeted shelter/camping area around 4:15, and elected to spend the nite there as opposed to pushing on. My tenting spot is on a slight rise with a beautiful view to the southeast. It is so nice to arrive at camp a little early, get setup under fair skies, and have a nice relaxing hot meal while discussing the day’s hike with Night Train, Jeep and Captain Blackbeard (my hiking buddies) - and to discuss the gameplan for the next day (hint:  it includes hiking).

Today’s hike took us through the Nantahala Outdoor Center. They offer a variety of outdoor adventure activities such as kayaking, canoeing, zip lining. We got there at 10:45, had lunch at the restaurant, and ended up killing a couple hours as the guys were printing out their permits for the Great Smoky Mountain National Park which we will enter in 3 days. I printed my permit out at home the day before I left for my trip, figuring if it took me more than 30 days to get to the Smokies I was in trouble (permits are only good for 30 days to enter the park, and you cannot be in the park as a thru hiker for more than 8 days). 3,000 ft. climb out of the NOC, whew!

People (more specifically my 6 year old granddaughter Lucy) ask how the Smoky Mountains got their name. It comes from the blue mist that always seems to hover around the peaks and valleys.  When vapor is released from the area’s vegetation, the molecules in the vapor scatter the blue light. The Cherokee called this phenomenon blue smoke (in Cherokee of course).  At least the above is what Google tells me. 
We enjoyed a beautiful sunrise this morning at the Fontana Dam Shelter, before we headed over to Fontana Village. We will be spending the nite at Fontana Lodge, a very nice place. They have a hiker special that basically works out to $45/person for the nite. Night Train and I are sharing a room, Jeep and Capt. Blackbeard are in another room. Many shops etc. in the village are seasonal and are currently closed, but a restaurant and the laundromat are open - very important.
Took the opportunity to do some laundry, take a shower and pickup my maildrop from home (thanks Kayanne!).  And of course we ate here at the restaurant a late breakfast and then dinner. We also purchased a few odds and ends to complete our food bags as it will be approximately 5 more days till the next opportunity for a resupply. 
Well now that we are here, I have a confession to make (I did not want to say anything before in my post, because I didn’t want to interject any negativity/disappointment into my trail journal entries). I have plantar fasciitis, and 8 days into my hike my achilles on both feet had become so inflamed that I thought my hike was over. I was practically in tears (that picture of me soaking my feet in a creek with me smiling - well I was crying on the inside; reference my Day 8 entry/photo). I’ve been wearing orthotics for about 15 years, and haven’t had any serious outbreaks of inflamation since. For the life of me I couldn’t understand what was going on, until it hit me - it was my boot insoles. At the suggestion of the salesperson at the outfitter where I purchased my boots, I cut the insole that came with the boot to fit around my orthotics (i. e. in the boot I left that piece of the insole that fell under the ball/toes of my foot). I had never done this before mind you, but I broke from normal practice and did it for my thru hike - the rationale being that the cushioning under the ball of my foot would better enable me to withstand the rigors of the pounding my feet would get on the trail. This turned out to be a huge mistake. Anyway a couple miles down the trail from where I had soaked my feet I removed both insole remnants, and within 30 minutes I noticed that my inflammation was already beginning to subside in both feet. THIRTY MINUTES!  I went from being as low as could be emotionally, to a state of absolute euphoria. The other 3 horsemen, who pulled ahead of me while I was soaking my feet, couldn’t believe it when I arrived at camp right behind them beaming from ear to ear. My AT thru hike attempt had renewed life! Yes, I still have some inflammation in both achilles today on day 13, but my left foot is about 75% recovered and my right is about 50%. With each passing day the inflammation becomes less and less. YEAH!

We were dependent on a shuttle ride from the Fontana Lodge back to the shelter, so we didn’t get started hiking today till about 8:30. That’s OK, as this way we got to walk across Fontana Dam in daylight (with our customary 5:30 AM hiking start we’d of been crossing in the dark and missed the view). The dam is very impressive indeed, nice job TVA. We were also sure to drop our half of our Smoky Mountain thru hiking permits into the box. We now officially have 8 days max. to get thru the park. 
It was an absolutely beautiful day today, another warm day and lots of sunshine. We had a great 360 degree view from the fire tower on Shuckstack Mt. This is certainly beautiful country here in North Carolina. As far as the hiking today was concerned, the trail was great. Lots of switchbacks which means very gentle grades - great hiking. According to Guthook today’s climbing elevation was 5,600 ft., but it didn’t seem like it was that much with the gentle grades. 
Somewhere around milepost 174 we encountered the North Carolina/Tennessee state line, and will apparently be crossing back and forth between the two states for the next several days. They say that the AT is the state line along a stretch thru the Smokies, so as we are hiking one foot will be in NC and one foot will be in TN. 
There are two other AT thru hikers here at the shelter tonite (Buckeye and Zilla) and two weekend hikers. We also passed a SOBO on the trail today (Giggles), he is only about 170 miles from finishing. Congratulations Giggles! In general however we have not encountered many other hikers, which is not unexpected being we are well ahead of the hiker bubble. 
Today on the trail Nite Train saw some wild boar tracks. Mind you I am not a hunter to start with and wouldn’t know a wild boar track from a turkey track. I have read that wild boars roam these parts in packs. Anyway I asked the guys what I should do in the event there was a big old wild boar bull rushing me. Nite Train commented with a chuckle that I was probably done for unless I climbed a tree. HaHa. Capt. Blackbeard said that since I had a hard head I should head butt the charging boar. HaHa, real funny guys! The reason I am now known by the guys as having a hard head is because a couple nights ago, when getting up during the nite to take a leak, I smashed my head into a low beam in the shelter. I hit it so hard and it made such a noise, all the guys woke up. They had a good laugh over that one too. Happy to provide the entertainment guys.

The rain stopped by around 9, and we had a brief interlude around 1 where the skies cleared but that was short lived. 
Today wasn’t our highest mileage day so far, but it may have been our toughest. Approx. 6,000 ft. climbing elevation according to Guthook. We did summit Clingman’s Dome, at 6,658 ft. it is the tallest point on the AT. We walked up the tower, but there were absolutely no views to be had because of the cloud cover. Oh well, so geht’s leben. We did go over 200 miles today, which is also a milestone. We still have few miles ahead of us. About 1,991, but who’s counting. HaHa.
We are staying  again at a shelter tonite, Mt. Collins Shelter is at Elev. 5,958 ft, which is pretty high up. Staying in a shelter is a requirement of AT thru hikers here in the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. The only time we can pitch a tent is if the shelter is full, which this time of year is not the case. The shelters here are pretty nice, they are of stone construction with wooden sleeping platforms. Shelters so far all have a stone fireplace (we had a fire going the last two nites), and the open side of the shelter is covered with a tarp.  All the comforts of home!
We did see several day/weekend hikers out on the trail today, but hikers are few and far between. Also staying at the shelter tonite is Trunks (so named because he has massive legs like tree trunks), an Ohio State student attempting an AT thru hike just like us. Trunks is taking the spring semester off. He is very fit and really motors down the trail. 
Please note that I will be posting this report tomorrow (hopefully), a day after the fact, as my cell phone signal is very weak.

Now that we are 3 days into the Smokies, I think they are great. The trail and shelters are all in great shape, and the views (when there’s no mist/clouds), are awesome. Spectacular country. One area kind of interesting that I walked through was a fenced off area to keep the wild hogs out. The informational sign stated that this was to protect vegetation that apparently the hogs destroy. Speaking of hogs I keep thinking of bacon, ham, pulled pork....but I digress.

Tonite’s shelter is interesting in that the front face of the shelter is fenced off with chain link and a gate. This is to keep the bears out, so apparently we are spending the nite in an area with known bear activity. The black bears are harmless, they are simply interested in the food we hikers are carrying. Speaking of food, I was ravenously hungry tonite and ate two dinners. Hiker hunger has not yet kicked in, although I do find myself fantasizing about a nice hot roast beef sandwich and gravy now and then while hiking. I’m sure I’ve lost a little weight so far, which is good, but nothing drastic yet. 
I am safe, warm and dry tonite in the shelter - all is well and am looking forward to tomorrow.","Pecks Corner Shelter

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583452,"We had just an awesome bluebird day today, clear skies all day, little wind, and comfortably cool temps.  The good Lord was smiling on us today, a good day to be alive and to enjoy this beautiful country of ours. 
We said goodbye to GSMNP today, and the park was good to us. Well maintained trails, nice shelters and awesome views when we had clear skies. However, Mother Nature, a little more cooperation from you would have been appreciated. You definitely tested our mettle with all the rain you threw our way. Oh well, as the saying goes:  no rain, no pain, no Maine. 
I stopped at Standing Bear Farm hostel early this morning to pick up a mail drop that Kayanne sent me. Kayanne basically sends me what I request, but I’m not doing a very good job with my meal planning and ordering because I’m carrying way too much food. I don’t need to be carrying all that extra weight. Now that I have a meal routine established, I think I can improve and reduce the weight of my food bag. 
We had three separate trail magic locations today. One each on either side of I40 (soda, applesauce, cliff bars) and one at Brown Gap manned by Apple. Apple had chairs setup for us and provided cold drinks, chips, and candy bars. He lives in Cincinnati, and travels all the way down here to provide trail magic to thru hikers. What a guy. Thank you very much to all our trail angels, you can’t imagine what a boost it is to us thru hikers when we encounter these treats. 
Today we climbed Max Patch, a bald summit covered in a meadow. The views were spectacular in 360 degrees, we were all in awe. I lingered there for an hour, sat down and made my dinner right on the summit. I hated to leave, but it was getting late and we still needed to get to the shelter before nightfall. 
Seven of us total are at the shelter tonite; besides myself staying here are: Night Train, Captain Blackbeard, Jeep, Ghost, Big Load (whom I hiked with the first two days) and T5000 (formerly Trunks).  We have our own mini hiker bubble going, but we all get along great and like pounding down the miles. I’m sure we won’t all hang together all the way to Maine, but we’ll see how she goes for now. Tomorrow the plan is to hike into Hot Springs, NC. I should be arriving later in the afternoon, plan on spending two nights, with a zero day on Thursday. At $20/nite, shower included, you can’t beat the price. Am looking forward to some wholesome diner food, visiting the outfitter, Dollar General, post office, doing laundry, etc.
I am safe, warm and dry in the shelter tonite. Forecast calls for rain and colder temps tomorrow, but we are accustomed to those conditions and will deal with whatever comes our way. Goodnight all!","Davenport Gap Shelter

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583471,"On the trail again today hiking at 5:15 AM under headlamps. Someone asked in my guest book entry why we routinely start so early. Well for starters Night Train is a retired Master Sergeant and 4:30 AM rise and shines are in his system, HaHa. Truth be told all four of us Horsemen are early risers (before I retired my rise and shine was typically 5 AM). Also getting an early start helps to ensure that we’ll be at our agreed upon camping destination when there is still daylight. It is so much more pleasant getting into camp at the end of the day with some daylight left. I also find it rather enjoyable hiking in the early morning, occasionally hearing an owl with its “who who....who cooks for you”, and then watching the daylight ever so slowly make its appearance. Watching the sun break over the horizon is also special (when there’s no low cloud cover of course).
I am happy to report that my inflamed achilles are completely healed in both heels, Yippee! Thank you to everyone for your well wishes, your concern was much appreciated. Physically everything is working for me right now. Over the years I’ve had both knees operated on arthroscopicly (torn menisci and arthritis), but they are holding up well (thank you Dr. Daino). Downhills are of course hardest on the joints, but so far so good. 
As far as today’s hike was concerned, it was intermittent rain and low cloud cover just as forecast. No views, but I was still visually reliving in my mind the spectacular day we had yesterday and awesome views off of Max Patch. Night Train and I really hustled down the trail today, and we arrived at the Hostel at Laughing Heart Lodge at around 12:30. I think we were driven by our desire for a nice hot meal. We were both famished so we dropped our packs at the hostel and immediately made the short walk into town to the local diner. Soup, a steak sandwich with fries and cornbread, and a strawberry cobbler with ice cream were all delicious and hit the spot for me!  That was followed later in the day by a dinner of a large salad and half a pizza. I am now laying in my bunk at the hostel absolutely stuffed - I’d be hard pressed to even waddle down the trail right now, HaHa.  According to the scale here at the hostel I’ve lost about 10 pounds so far on my thru hike (but that was before dinner - I’m sure I gained some back).
Tomorrow we are taking a Zero day here in Hot Springs to give our bodies a chance to recover from our days in the Smokies, resupply, laundry, etc. For tonite I am safe, warm and dry (and also stuffed like a pig) in my bunk at the hostel.","Roaring Fork Shelter

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583507,"Took a Zero today here in Hot Springs, NC at Laughing Heart Lodge. As far as  a Zero is concerned today was a good day to take one as it rained most of the day. Lots of people here at the hostel with the same idea, including:  the Four Horsemen (Jeep, Night Train, Capt. Blackbeard, Opa), Ghost, T5000, Mainer, Capt. Black, Jersey, Big Load, Sour Patch, Youngblood, No Shoes, and Mary Heather. Laughing Heart is a very nice place with all the amenities that you would expect at a full service hostel (heat, bunks with mattresses and pillows, bathrooms/showers, laundry, kitchen available for use, DVD player with a selection of movies) but the place is quite full/busy. Please don’t get me wrong, all the folks staying here are very polite/pleasant, but it will be good to get back on the trail and hopefully separate from this hiker bubble that I’m in.
After pigging out on food yesterday I ate in moderation today, did not join those folks that went to the local diner for meals, but instead prepared my own meals here and ate at the hostel. Eggs/toast for breakfast, leftover pizza and an apple for lunch, and a freeze dried meal and fried bologna sandwich for dinner washed down by a milkshake. 
I did take a walk into town this AM and pickup my maildrop (thanks Kayanne), so I am all set with food  and will be carrying about a 7 day supply when we leave tomorrow. Still too much food as I will be able to resupply again in Erwin, TN in about 5 days, but I’m ok with that. While in town I also stopped at the local outfitter (Bluff Mountain Outfitters, they are excellent), where I bought a new stove yesterday (I am making the switch from alcohol to a compact propane stove) and got my AT Passport stamped by them. The AT Passport is a small book that one carries, which can be stamped by participating vendors. Kind of a neat way to document my stops along the trail. 
I also mailed home some gear that I don’t feel I’ll need anymore in an effort to lighten my pack, including:  my microspikes (I’ve jinxed us now, we will get a snowstorm for sure), my polypro bottoms base layer (I haven’t worn them yet, and never have a problem keeping my legs warm), my alcohol stove/accessories, and a second pair of liner gloves (Amy, those possum wool gloves you got for me work great; when it’s raining I can keep them dry by wearing my thin outer shell mitts - and even when wet, they keep my hands warm).
I also did my laundry, took another shower, and got in a nice snoozer that I desperately needed (I didn’t sleep very well last nite as the bunkhouse was stiflingly hot).  I also took the opportunity to upload my photos to the cloud as the WiFi connection is decent, make a few phone calls and respond to texts. I also had the opportunity to facetime with our son Eric and granddaughters Elena and Evelyn. The most challenging aspect of my hike is being away from family.  PS Grandkids:  I have been practicing the song, it goes like this:  head, shoulders, needles and bones....needles and bones. How am I doing?
I also took the opportunity to repair a hole in my pack that was apparently made by a mouse that fell into a water bottle pocket several nites ago and chewed its way out. I am very diligent about making sure that no food or scented toiletries (e,g. toothpaste) are left in my pack overnite, but apparently the little fella was exploring and dropped into my water bottle pouch with no way out. A little tenacious tape to the rescue. 
I am safe, warm and dry tonite in my bunk at the hostel, looking forward to getting back on the trail tomorrow.","Laughing Heart Hostel

I am fine, no worries, but it is difficult to type. Great day to hike today, as it was dry and the sun was shining. Some very light snow on the dead leaves at higher elevations this AM, and windy - but a day without rain is a good day. The forecast called for overnite lows in the 20s, so I filled my water bottles with hot water and have them shoved in the bottom of my sleeping bag so they don’t freeze. I also have a pee bottle with me, which I’ve joked to the guys is one of the best pieces of gear I own on a nite like tonite.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583577,"Cold start this morning, on the trail hiking at 4:45 AM with temps in the 20s. It didn’t take long for my water bottles to start icing up. The key is to have wide mouth bottles (I use gatorade bottles) and to keep them upside down in your pack - otherwise you will quickly end up with an ice plug in the neck of your bottle with no way to get the water out. Also when it’s cold like this in the mornings the best remedy is to break camp quickly, get moving, and keep moving. I wore all my layers (merino wool base layer, fleece, down sweater and rain jacket) and was fine, no issues. Several times during the course of the day I adjusted layers as conditions dictated, as it is so important from a moisture management standpoint not to overheat and start sweating. I’ve now experienced a full gamut of conditions (from raining/warm to cold/dry) and overall am very pleased with how my gear is performing. 
The cold temps notwithstanding, it was a beautiful day with clear skies and lots of sunshine. Lots of hoar frost on the trail today, visible well past noon. It was very windy this AM as well. Hiking on the leeward side of a hill/ridge, one felt warm; on the windward side the cold cut through you. The ability to properly layer up/down is key. 
I was on the summit of Big Butt Mt. with The Ghost, and we caught a great sunrise. I also experienced a variety of trail conditions today that included both rock scrambles (short sections up/down on Big Butt) and several areas of open meadows, in addition to the usual trail through the woods that is typical. All in all a good day, although I am tired tonite (although I won’t admit that to the young bucks that I’m hiking with). 42.4 miles and 11,600 ft. in climbing elevation over the past 2 days is tough for this 66 year old body to take - I am not as young as I used to be, HaHa. The plan for tomorrow is a 20 mile day, followed by a short 6 mile day into Erwin where several of us will take a Nero. 
To respond to a guest book entry asking why I switched from an alcohol stove to propane:  the alcohol stove was slow, and required a little bit of futzing. Watching others use their small lightweight propane stoves, I became a convert. They are fast, lightweight and so easy to use. I’ve cooked my dinners the last two nites on my new MSR propane stove, and am glad I made the switch. Even with the cold temps I’ve had no issues with heat output, and have not had to resort to placing the fuel canister in my sleeping bag with me to warm it up. 
Again thank you to all of you that are following along on trailjournals, I read every guest book entry and appreciate all of your comments, questions and words of encouragement. - it means a lot!!! And a special shout out to my good friend Bill Schweinfurth, who is keeping me motivated with regular “Go Opa” and “Good Luck Reinhard” photos that he is sending me via text messages. Thanks Bill!

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583631,"The day before I left Rochester for my hike I stopped in REI with the gift card in hand that was given to me at my retirement party (thanks all) and purchased a fleece buff. This is the first time I have ever used a buff, traditionally I’ve been a fleece hat kind of guy. There is actually an instructional YouTube video out showing all the different ways that a buff can be worn. After multiple viewings I finally felt comfortable enough taking the buff on the trail with me and not looking foolish when trying to put it on. I really like the buff, and wear it a lot when it’s a cold day. Anyway the guys really teased me about it when I first put it on, saying that I was wearing a Dew Rag, that I looked like one mean bad a_ _ hombre and that I was ready for Compton. Told them I was wearing a buff and not a Dew Rag, and that I didn’t know who/what/where about Compton. Compton they explained is Compton, California where basically folks with a free spirit lifestyle hang out partaking in generally illicit and illegal activities. I am a generally straight laced , conservative, law abiding individual - and I was pretty sure that my family would have me committed if I came home from the trail with Dew Rags in hand and instructed everyone to pack their bags because we’re all headed to Compton. I think it’s best if I continue to call my buff a buff, and not a Dew Rag.  
As far as today’s hike is concerned, it was a great day. Still cold this AM with temps in the 20s, but not as windy as yesterday. Clear skies and lots of sunshine affording awesome views. I hung out for awhile with Night Train on the summit of Big Bald Mt. enjoying 360 degree views from this expansive meadow covered summit. I also saw two white tailed deer scamper across the trail today, they were gone in a flash - no way could I get my camera out in time for a picture. The deer seemed very good size, larger than what I would typically see up north. 
After 3 consecutive long mileage days with lots of climbing elevation, my legs really felt it on the last climb of the day. I made it, but am looking forward to tomorrow’s Nero in Erwin, TN.

Uncle Johnny passed away quite suddenly 2 weeks ago. He purchased the hostel (it actually was just a private home) about 20 years ago and has been running it ever since along with his wife Charlotte.  From what I understand Uncle Johnny was well liked and respected by the hiking community and he will be missed. His wife Charlotte plans on continuing to run the hostel. We (the 4 horsemen) rented a 4 bed cabin for the night, divided between the 4 of us it was only slightly more than a bunk in the bunkhouse. Overall we enjoyed our Nobo day here. They cater to AT thru hikers and offer three round trip shuttle rides into town so that hikers can eat, shop, resupply, etc. They are also an outfitter and have resupply at reasonable prices - and sell full size Snickers bars for 40 cents if you can believe it. Friendly and helpful staff as well. Overall a good place to stay. 
I did the usual hiker routine of laundry, a shower, resupply shopping and eating. Lots of eating. Breakfast at Bojangles (sausage, biscuits and gravy, and a bacon with egg muffin), lunch at Pizza Plus (all you can eat pizza, salad and dessert for $8.49) and dinner at an a very nice Mexican restaurant (fajitas).  Once again I am quite stuffed, but I’m not feeling guilty about it as I know the extra calories will be quickly burned off.  Back on the trail bright and early tomorrow. 
The forecast calls for rain the next couple days followed by very cold temps (teens overnite at the higher elevations where we will be camping) and snow. I sure hope I didn’t send my microspikes home too early!
I continue to meet other hikers every day, both section hikers and thru hikers. Interesting characters. On the trail I’ve also crossed paths with several SOBOs (southbounders) who typically have started their hikes last summer. I’ve always offered my congratulations on their imminent achievement of completing a thru hike, and with one exception have found them to be very pleasant/happy individuals as one would expect. The individual that was the exception seemed to have a real burr under his saddle, so I just moved on. As far as I’m concerned the trail is no place for a sour attitude.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583779,"I forgot to mention that yesterday coming down the trail into Uncle Johnnys I came across an individual working hard with a pickaxe digging out a tree root from the trail. We chatted for awhile, his trail name is Itsy Bitsy Spider from when he thru hiked the AT in 1977. Itsy Bitsy is now 73 years old, and he has been maintaining the same 4 mile section of the AT for the past 22 years - and is still going strong. I thanked him immensely for his dedication and service all these years; without individuals like him the trail would not be nearly as nice as what it is. When hiking along I think to myself what a monumental undertaking it must have been to not only establish a route for the AT, but also to physically construct it. Most of the trail is very remote, and Im certain that when constructed over 70 years ago it took a lot of hard working individuals using only basic hand tools laboring tirelessly for many hours. The end result is a beautiful trail that has, and will continue to be, enjoyed by many individuals - be they thru hikers, section hikers, or just folks/families out for a leisurely hike on a Sunday afternoon. A job well done by Myron Avery and all the individuals that brought the AT to fruition!Todays hike started in the rain, and we had overcast for almost the entire day. A low ceiling meant we were hiking in the clouds once we gained some elevation, so unfortunately there were no views to be had. Night Train, Capt. Blackbeard and I left Uncle Johnnys and were hiking at 5:45 AM, and we arrived at our destination at 2:30 PM. Unfortunately Jeep did not leave with us, as he elected to remain at Uncle Johnnys for a day or two to see if his shin splints will heal up with some rest. Jeep has been dealing with shin splints for several days and has been bravely hiking through the pain, but they are not getting better. I know first hand from my high school track team days that shin splints can be very painful and downright debilitating. They are not fun. We all wished Jeep a speedy recovery, and are hopeful that we will see him again, and soon, on the AT. Jeep is a good guy, he was the hiking spirit for the Four Horsemen, and we will miss him dearly. The truth of the matter is that any one of us hiking the AT could come down with an injury/ailment at any time that could knock us off the trail. While hiking today I came across an evergreen tree next to the trail at roughly 5,000 ft. elevation that had been decorated with various ornaments, placards and misc. mementos. Stopping to take a closer look, the decorated tree was dedicated to Max Merrell (sp.) who passed away in 2016 at the age of 22.

Accumulations I’m estimating at 5-6”, with drifts up to a foot. Temperatures dropped steadily during the day as well. It was a difficult day, lots of climbing elevation and cold, windy, snowy. 
I also had my first two slips and falls of the hike today. Nothing serious, I bounced back. I should put my microspikes on. Oh yeah, I mailed them back home when I was in Hot Springs. Carried them around for a couple hundred miles, then when I needed them I don’t have them. Smart, real smart!!!

A very restless nite indeed. All if us at the shelter had trouble staying warm. Not sure exactly what the temps were at that elevation, it may have been in the single digits. 
We got a later start than normal, wanting to wait till we had daylight. We were concerned with our footing on the snow covered trail. The ice hidden under the snow can be very slippery. As it was I slipped and fell a couple more times today, but bounced back and all limbs/joints are still working as designed. 
I had put one of my water bottles in my sleeping bag overnite so I had some water to start, but we were relieved to find a flowing piped spring later that morning to fill up.   In view of the trail conditions Night Train and I took our time today. We arrived at US 19E at about 3:30. We had some long stretches of trail across exposed ridgelines today. Visibility was not the best with a low ceiling and blowing snow. With the wind howling as we struggled to stay erect, we felt like true winter mountaineers as we slowly and painstakingly made our way along the exposed ridges and balds step by step.
We are spending the nite at Mountain Harbor Hostel, a very nice place. My maildrop arrived, thank you Kayanne. There was also a bag of goodies that Jeep had left here for us, thank you Jeep for your thoughtfulness. I did the usual laundry and shower routine when I arrived, so I’ll be ready to hit the trail tomorrow after breakfast. At one point I was going to take a Zero here tomorrow, but the weather forecast has improved so we will try to get some miles in with a mid morning start. 
We met a couple of other hikers here: Soaring Eagle (a flip-flopper) and his friend Rain Man (a section hiker). A couple of very nice guys, they had a vehicle here and took a run into nearby Roan Mountain and picked up some pizzas for us. I naturally did stuff myself on the pizza. Speaking of food/eating, I did weigh myself here and I can’t believe it but I’ve lost 22 lbs in just 4 weeks! That is too much, I can’t afford to continue to lose weight at this rate. I lost my love handles and feel good, I don’t feel weak from weight loss and I’m certainly not gaunt. I was probably about 12-15 lbs. overweight when I started my hike , but not 22 lbs. I will have to try and start eating more I guess.
I gave Jeep a call tonite, and he sounded very upbeat. He went to see the doctor and had an MRI done, and apparently there’s nothing seriously wrong that a few days rest and some medications shouldn’t take care of. Jeep plans on resuming his hike on Saturday, which is great news. We are with you in spirit Jeep, wishing you the best. Who knows, you may very well catch us and one day come marching into our camp - that would be a most happy occasion indeed!

Clean, well appointed, plenty of heat in the cold weather (there’s a nice wood burning stove in the bunkhouse), and the Hills are very friendly and accommodating. Regarding their reputation as offering the best breakfast on the AT, it is no joke. The food was absolutely delicious, a nice variety, and even included several different homemade baked goods. We all ate to our hearts content, then packed up and headed out on the trail at about 10:15. No need for an early start, as we had a relatively modest 8 mile day ahead of us. Long range we are planning on being in Damascas in 5 days and will be taking a Nero there. 
As far as the weather is concerned it was a beautiful day. Comfortably cool (30s), not much wind and lots of sunshine. What a difference a day makes. The hike itself was through some very pleasant terrain with beautiful scenery. We hiked through a hilltop meadow where we enjoyed views of the surrounding mountains. Shortly thereafter we walked past a nicely maintained hillside cemetery, followed by a walk past a cascading waterfalls (Jones Falls). Next up was a walk along a meandering river (Elk River).   Also seeing how we had a short mileage day we (Night Train, Capt. Blackbeard and I) took time out to sit down along the trail and enjoy a leisurely lunch - which is not normal routine for me, usually it’s “snack ‘n go”. I told myself that I’ve got to force myself to eat more while on the trail,I can’t afford to be losing another 22 lbs. in the next four weeks like I did in the first four weeks. 
Joining the 3 of us at the shelter tonite is No Shoes, a young gal that worked most recently as a cook in NYC (Manhattan).  She is a strong hiker, and is hoping to complete her AT thru hike bu August. I am taking advantage of the dry weather and have decided to stay in my tent tonite. After dinner we were all sitting around a nice campfire just enjoying the fire and engaging in conversation. All around it has been a good day. Capt. Blackbeard is our campfire man, that is usually the first thing he does when he rolls into camp. Thank you Captain!!!!!
I also encountered today several slackpackers. Slackpacking is when you have a shuttle drive you ahead (or back) to a trail/road crossing, and then hike back to your original starting point - most often a hostel that is near the trail. The advantage of course is that you only need to carry a lightweight daypack (usually just food and water for the day, plus a minimal amount of gear/clothing), enabling you to cover more miles than you would if carrying a full pack. So far I have not done any slackpacking, nor do I intend to at this time.  My intention is to carry my full pack for the entire thru hike, we’ll see how it goes. However I will tell you that if it comes down to slackpacking vs. not completing my AT thru hike, I will bite the bullet and slackpack if necessary. Leaving the hostel this AM my pack was the heaviest it has been yet, primarily because of all the food I’m carrying.

Blackbeard and I) and The Ghost are the only ones here at the shelter so far tonite, but you never know who might yet come rolling in. The shelter is on top of a rocky knob. I tried to pitch my tent in one of the only two halfway large enough and level enough sites that are here by the shelter to no avail (too rocky for the stakes), so I’ll sleep in the shelter tonite, no big deal. 
Hiking this morning I came across a wooden bench right on the trail, that offered views back towards Roan Mt. where we were a couple days ago in the freezing cold, snow and wind. That is one tall mountain. We also walked past Laurel Falls, which is in a deep rocky gorge, and enjoyed the scenery. 
Folks may be wondering how we are able to follow the trail. Generally the trail is fairly evident as it has seen many footprints over the years, and it is also marked with 2” x 6” white paint marks on trees/rocks. These paint marks are called blazes (see photo), and the paint must be reflective as it stands out under a miners light beam pretty well at nite. The spacing of the blazes varies from as close as maybe 50’ to what seems like a quarter mile apart or more. I guess spacing depends on the terrain, and perhaps also on the judgement of the hiking club/individual that is responsible for maintaining a given section of the trail. When there are two blazes, one on top of the other, it means pay attention as you may be coming to a trail intersection, a side trail leading to a water source or shelter, or possibly a sharp change in trail direction. I have gotten myself off trail a couple times, but fortunately realized it quickly and got back on trail. Got a chance to call and facetime with some of my family today, always good to touch base with them as I miss them dearly.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/583952,"Daylight Savings Time is here. My Casio altimeter watch, which I like a lot, came with an instruction manual that was about an inch thick. I don’t have it with me on the trail of course, but before leaving for my trip I read certain sections (with a magnifying glass....why do the guys that produce these manuals always use microscopic type) that I thought might be relevant - including the section on resetting the time. I knew this day was coming and have been concerned for awhile about my ability to reset the time. I am pleased to report that after numerous attempts I finally succeeded. Yippee!
It rained off and on mist of the day, but temps were comfortably cool (30s) so overall not a bad day to be hiking. After all the rain we’ve had so far, I am now quite adept at quickly getting in/out of raingear. The highlight of today’s hike was walking along the shoreline of Watauga Lake and across the Watauga Dam, built by the TVA during the years 1942-1949.  
We met on the trail today a Flip-Flopper, trail name Sharkey, and had a pleasant conversation with him. He started his hike in January from PA heading south to Springer, he will then get transportation north to Katahdin and complete his thru hike by hiking back south to PA. I am eating more these days in an attempt to stem my weight loss, and the past two days even took the time to stop and fix myself a hot lunch. I really like the new propane stuff that I purchased in Hot Springs, and have a system down now so that fixing something hot is relatively quick and easy. 
I had someone post a guest book entry asking about water purification. I use chlorine dioxide (Aqua Mira) drops, parts A and B. They are simple to use and effective. Other folks use a filter, but I’ve never been a fan because they are prone to problems and require regular cleaning. I believe they are also susceptible to icing up when temps drop well below freezing. Several folks that I know have switched while on the trail this year from a filter to AquaMira drops. 
It is supposed to get cold again with some light snow. As long as it doesn’t get colder than the teens overnite, I should be fine. Tomorrow we are planning on a big day (22 miles), and hope to be in Damascas on Tues with a 10 mile Nero. 
My nephew Matt, a St. Bonaventure graduate, wanted to make sure that I reported in my journal that the Bonnies are in the NCAA basketball tournament. You gotta love March Madness. Go Bonnies! I also spoke by phone with my brother John who lives in Winston Salem NC, and it looks like John and his wife Debby will be rendezvousing with me in Roanoke, VA. The timing looks to be about the last weekend in March. I am really looking forward to seeing them! John asked me what he could bring, I told him cookies and baked goods, Ha Ha!

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584035,"This was a long and difficult day(and nite).  Stayed in my tent last nite and we had significant rain. Between the rain and cold temps I had a lot of condensation in my single wall tent, all my gear/clothing was pretty darn wet/damp. Anyway I packed up and was on the trail at 5 AM. I hiked alone for most of the day; Night Train caught me about 2 PM and we hiked together after that. 
It rained continuously for several hours after I broke camp, and on occasion the fog was so thick that I could hardly see my feet let alone the trail. About mid morning as the temps continued to drop it started snowing - not real heavy but fairly steadily for most of the day.  With the colder temps my wet pack started freezing up, it looked like a block of ice and straps became stiff and were difficult to adjust, water bottles started freezing, etc. I had no trouble keeping myself warm while hiking, but the minute I stopped for a few minutes for a snack, potty break, etc. I quickly became chilled. Best bet was to keep moving. 
The original plan was to hike 22.7 miles to Abingdon Gap shelter and spend the nite, but with the conditions being what they were Night Train and I elected to hike the additional 10 miles into Damascas and spend the nite at Woodchuck Hostel. A long day, 32.4 miles and 5,400 ft. of climbing elevation. Our first 30 mile day, yippee. We also today crossed over into VA. That makes 3 states down, only 11 more left, HaHa. We will be spending a Zero or two here at the hostel, getting dried out, resupplying, laundry, etc. The forecast calls for winter to hang on thru Wed. before temps moderate and return to normal.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584080,"Am taking a Zero here in Damascas at the Woodchuck Hostel. The hostel is full to capacity, there are a number of thru hikers staying here at least one, and possibly two, days including:  Night Train, Capt. Blackbeard, The Ghost, Chopsticks, T5000, Bobcat, Rain Man, Soaring Eagle, Mainer, Youngblood. The hostel owner Chuck (aka Woodchuck) is a nice guy and very accommodating. However when we first arrived late yesterday and walked in, chilled to the bone, we noticed that it wasn’t that warm in here. As a matter of fact it was downright cold in our bunkroom. No wonder, Chuck had the thermostat set at 59 degrees!  We quickly had to remedy that. 
On a sad note Night Train is being forced to discontinue his thru hike attempt. He has been battling various ailments in his feet and knees, to the point that every step is painful and he is concerned that he may develop a more serious debilitating injury. He naturally is disappointed, but under the circumstances we can all understand why he is leaving the trail and sympathize with him. Injuries can happen at any time to any one of us as a result of the relentless pounding our bodies have to absorb. Night Train today rented a car from Enterprise, and will be driving back to his home in Georgia tomorrow. We will all miss Night Train, he was a great hiking partner and is a really good guy. I wish him only the best. 
On a side note I mentioned in an earlier entry how much trouble I was having with my single wall tent with moisture/condensation. Night Train had a Nemo Hornet Elite, practically brand new as he liked sleeping in shelters. The Nemo is a lightweight double wall tent that I was actually considering buying from a local outfitter here in town, based on the reviews. Night Train and I agreed on a price for his tent, it was a win-win for both of us, and I am now the proud owner of a Nemo tent. I mailed my old single wall tent back home, along with a couple of other items that I neither used nor need. 
The day was spent drying out gear, laundry and walking around town. Damascas is a nice little town, but it is not yet full-blown hiker season so all the restaurants and several of the shops are closed. However with a short half-mile walk to a little shopping center outside of town there is a nice supermarket and all you can eat pizza place which I frequented for lunch. For dinner four of us went in together on groceries and fixed ourselves an awesome meal using the kitchen here at the hostel. Ribeye steaks, baked beans, baked potatoes and corn on the con. Everything was delicious. As far as my weight loss is concerned I had been eating more on the trail the past four days and am happy to report that when I got on the scale here at the hostel in Damascas it showed that I had gained back about 1 pound. I know that’s not much, but hey, it’s better than losing weight.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584175,"Weather is still an issue here along the AT in VA. Cold and snow.  I am more than happy/able to hike in it, but with temps dipping back down into the teens overnite I was not real keen on sleeping in it. I guess this old man is getting soft, HaHa. 
My original plan was to take another Zero here at Woodchuck Hostel in Damascas and wait for things to warm up just a bit on Thursday, but then I had a brainstorm (every once in awhile the lightbulb turns on in the old noggin). Instead  this AM I grabbed a ride with Night Train at 5:30 (he had a rental car and was headed back home) and he was nice enough to drop me off about 12 trail miles north of here at the Beartree Gap Trail where it intersects VA 58.  A short 1/4 mile hike on this trail brought me to the AT, and from there I then hiked back to the hostel (carrying my full pack, not a slackpack).  Tomorrow after breakfast Woodchuck will shuttle me back up to the same location (Beartree Gap), from where I will continue my northbound journey. The trail this AM was snow covered (4-5” at the higher elevations, with drifts of maybe 8-10”) and it was cold enough to start freezing water bottles. I was on the AT hiking at 6:30, and was back here at the hostel by noon. At least I got some miles in today, which was better than just sitting around all day. To be honest there’s not a lot to do here in Damascas, there aren’t any restaurants that are open and many of the shops are closed/vacant. I’d go to a bar tonite and order some chicken wings and a soda just to watch some March Madness, but there’s nothing open. 
Well the 4 Horsemen are no longer a foursome. Night Train is unfortunately off the trail, Jeep had to take some time off earlier but is back on the trail (he may catch me), and Capt. Blackbeard is ahead of me with the intention of hiking big miles (he has a work commitment and must be finished sometime in June). It was good while it lasted, I really enjoyed hiking with those guys. We plan on staying in touch, and hopefully we will be able to get together in the future. 
I today crossed paths with a local dayhiker, and he informed that up on Mt. Rogers they received 2 feet of snow. Oh boy, that’s where I’m headed tomorrow - we’ll see how she goes. At least I won’t be breaking trail, as I know that at least the following folks are ahead of me: Capt. Blackbeard, Bobcat, Sour Patch, Mainer, The Ghost and T5000. 
The hostel is not as full tonite, there are 7 of us here:  Mess, Youngblood and his Dad, Chopsticks, Jersey, Soaring Eagle and Opa.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584226,"I am back on the trail in earnest, having gotten a shuttle ride back to Beartree Gap Trail from hostel owner Chuck right after breakfast. I must say that my stay at Woodchuck Hostel was very pleasant, the owner is easy going and very accommodating. Thank you Chuck for making my stay at your hostel a pleasant one.
I am hiking alone, which is not atypical - even when the Four Horsemen were together we often hiked at our own pace and were scattered along the trail. However at the end of the day we would see each other at our agreed upon destination. There was comfort in that arrangement knowing that I would be with good friends for the evening. On the other hand I now have a bit more flexibility in that when arriving at a shelter/camping area I may decide to push on - especially with Daylight Savings Time and progressively longer days ahead of me. I do like arriving at my final selected camping spot with enough daylight left so that I am not setting up camp in the dark, but to stop hiking as early as 2 PM seems like such a waste of remaining daylight. We are burning daylight was my mantra. However I need to be cautious and not out-hike my body if that makes any sense. Regularly pushing out 20 to 25 miles, which I feel capable of at this point (depending on the terrain and trail conditions of course) may not be in my best interests in view of the weight loss I have experienced. Having lost 22 lbs. in the first 4 weeks of my hike, I’ve become very conscious of calories in vs. calories burned. 
Lots of deep snow today at the higher elevations. Kudos and thanks to the folks (Capt. Blackbeard, The Ghost and others that are ahead of me) that broke out the trail yesterday, it helped me tremendously. If we had this much snow on the trail in the Adirondacks,  by DEC regs we would be required to be in snowshoes. Of course nobody that I know hiking the AT is equipped with snowshoes here in the south, because Mother Nature......WE WERE NOT EXPECTING 2 FEET OF SNOW IN MID MARCH....!!  Enough already with the Nor’easters.
Thanks to the McCoy family of Glouster, Ohio for the very nice trail magic you left at the Elk Garden parking lot. I had a powerade and one of the goodie bags, they really hit the spot. 
I arrived at Thomas Knob Shelter around 5:30, and there waiting for me was a pony. A very friendly little guy, he followed me around as I looked for a spot to pitch my tent and then eventually wandered away when he realized I wasn’t going to feed him. After dropping my pack I then backtracked the 0.2 miles to the side trail for Mt. Rogers, and after another 0.5 miles up that trail I was on the summit of Mt. Rogers the highest mountain in VA at 5,729 ft. 
I am in my new tent as opposed to the shelter, as apparently a spotted skunk has taken up residence in the shelter. The odor was quite noticeable, and as I am fragrant enough after hiking all day I elected to tent it instead. There are 3 section hikers staying in the shelter, I wished them well. 
All in all it was a great day today. Generally clear skies and in the 30s. The sky was a deep dark blue, I don’t think I’ve ever seen such a blue sky. On occasion the wind would kick up and blow the snow from the trees making the forest look a little foreboding, it reminded me of Fangorn Forest as seen in the Lord of the Rings movies. 
It is very windy/gusty tonite here at elevation 5,413 ft. I pitched the tent in a somewhat sheltered spot amongst some pine trees, but the wind still makes the tent walls shake, rattle and roll. So far she is holding. My boots are completely soaked from trodding  around in deep wet snow, so undoubtedly I’ll be putting on frozen boots in the AM. Something to look forward to, I had the same situation that nite on Roan Mt. when temps dipped down into the single digits. The forecast for tonite is the 20s, which isn’t bad.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584316,"The new tent that I bought from Night Train performed beautifully last nite. No condensation, everything was dry, and it stood up to some pretty stiff wind gusts. So far I am very pleased with the tent. 
When I woke up this AM the little pony, Buddy, was back standing guard over me right next to my tent. I think he likes me. While taking down my tent I conveyed to him my views on domestic issues, foreign affairs, the economy and other high level matters. I told Buddy that if he agrees with my views, he should simply keep all four hooves firmly on the ground. It’s unanimous, Buddy agrees with me on every issue! I think I’d get his vote if I were running for office. 
This morning it was full on winter conditions from the shelter all the way through Grayson Highlands. Cold temps (my water bottles were slushies), snow that in spots was up to me knees when stepping in postholes from those ahead of me, and some icy patches (I slipped and fell on my keister only once - which was pretty good with those conditions).  And man, was it windy - it was hard to stay upright under some of the gusts. The Highlands are beautiful, but to be honest I was glad to have them behind me. It was slow going. I did see about 8 more ponies along the way and told them where Buddy was hanging out, but they didn’t seem interested in the least as they kept on munching whatever it was they were eating. 
In the afternoon, shortly past the Highlands, it was as if spring had sprung. Little/no snow on the trail, comfortable temps, and clear skies. I could make some miles given those conditions. All in all I am pleased with today’s hike and mileage, am camped tonite by myself in an unofficial camping spot very close to Dickey Gap and VA 650. 
I hiked alone all day, which was fine - that doesn’t bother me at all. I did cross paths with two young ladies headed southbound out for a weekend backpack with their dog. They had really huge packs, glad I wasn’t carrying them. I also crossed paths with Bobcat and his friend Brenda, and we chatted for a bit. 
I did pass the 500 mile mark today, yippee! I am thoroughly enjoying my AT thru hike so far and am looking forward to the next 1,691 miles.  
Thanks again to those of you that have posted entries in my guest book, I greatly appreciate your comments, words of encouragement, suggestions, etc. 
I am unable to post my journal entry tonite due to lack of a cell signal, so I will hopefully post tomorrow along with tomorrow’s entry. Note also that uploading pictures requires a stronger signal, which is sometimes hard to come by on the trail. I have a nice picture that I took yesterday of the pony standing by the shelter, but was unable to upload it. Again I will try to upload tomorrow and update yesterday’s journal entry with this picture. 
The hardest part about the hike so far is being away from my family. I dearly miss my wife Kayanne, the kids/grandkids, all of you - but know that you are always in my thoughts and in my heart as I am hiking on this wonderful trail called the AT.

Broke camp before the rain started and on the trail hiking by 5, arrived at VA 16 just after noon. Rain in the early morning, but after that the day turned out to be warm and sunny. Today’s trail is in very good shape, was nicely graded - no steep grades either up or down. Crossed paths with thru hikers La Copa and Achilles. 
When I arrived at the visitor center lo and behold there were Capt. Blackbeard, The Ghost, Mainer, Sour Patch and T5000. They gave me a rousing reception and we exchanged fist bumps all around. It was so nice to see these friends, they are all young and strong and were getting ready to pound out some miles after spending the nite in Marion. They are all nice kids (I can call them that being the senior that I am) and I wish them nothing but the best.  Also I very fortuitously was offered a ride into Marion by a very nice man, Bill, a chemical engineer with Eastman Chemical. He dropped me, Achilles and David off at the Travel Inn, our destination for today’s Nero. The usual for me:  picked up my maildrop (thanks Kayanne), shower, laundry, drying out gear and eating. This for me was followed by a little relaxing in front of the tube:  March Madness baby!
Also today I met at VA 601 a group of 5 folks getting ready to undertake some trail maintenance. We chatted for awhile, had some laughs (they said they could tell by my accent that “...you’re not from around these parts....”), and I thanked them for all their hard work. I forgot to ask them what organization they were with, but it is only through the efforts of folks like these that the AT is such a beautiful trail.  My thanks to all the volunteers!

Got to facetime with Eric and the girls this AM, always a good way to start the day.  Got picked up at 8 by Jim Sparks, who shuttled me back over to the AT at the Mt. Rogers visitor center. Jim is 72, and he and his wife have lived in the Marion area for over 40 years. A very nice guy, I much appreciated the lift. 
My pack I think is the heaviest it has been so far, no scale to weigh it but my guess is 33 lbs with food/water. I am carrying 6 days worth of food, could easily make it last for 8-9 days if I had to. I tried to organize my food bag a little better this time, having taken lessons from Night Train. He was very organized and had a ziplock bag of food for each day. I have my food organized differently, which is still an improvement as before I just tossed all my food in the bag.
It was an absolutely beautiful day today, sunny and very pleasant temps. There were a few small, isolated patches of snow still on the trail, but otherwise the trail was dry. I was in a tee shirt and shorts for the afternoon. The trail was once again in great shape, and no major climbs. Towards the end of the day the trail had a series of ups/downs one right after the other. Kind of like a roller coaster. No major hills, just one after the other. AT thru hikers affectionately refer to these as PUDs (pointless ups and downs). 
I hiked alone all day, just enjoying the trail. Had a nice leisurely lunch around 11:30, cooked myself up some Ramen and tuna. I also stopped at the 1894 Lindamood School, which was open so I could go in. An old fashioned 1 room schoolhouse just like you see on tv. Where the trail crossed under I81 I also stopped at a minimart and treated myself to a pint of Hershey’s butter pecan ice cream and a drink, enjoying them while sitting on the grass in the sunshine. Life is good. 
The only people I saw on the trail today were a couple with their adopted son, who is from China and has been here in the US now for 3 years. They were out for a Sunday afternoon walk on the trail. The boy, who looked to be maybe 9 or 10, wanted to know if he could ask me a question. Of course I said yes, and he asked me if I knew about Jesus. His question surprised me a bit, but I was able to answer affirmatively which seemed to satisfy him. 
I am camped here by myself in a camping spot near a stream. I even found a good tree from which to hang my bear bag. From what I understand bears go into a state of semi-hibernation here in this area for the winter, but around this time of year is when they start becoming active again. Hanging a good bear bag can be a challenge, as inevitably there never seems to be a good tree/branch near shelters and campsites. I hang my bag PCT style which presents more options in terms of a suitable tree, but nevertheless it can still be a challenge. 
I have no cell coverage tonite, so was unable to check in with Kayanne. I have Verizon which generally provides the best coverage along the AT, but lately cell service has been sporadic at best.

Most of the climbing was towards the end of the day, approximately 2,000 ft. up to Chestnut Knob Shelter, Elev. 4409. This is a fully enclosed shelter with a door on it, used to be a fire warden’s cabin that has been converted to a shelter. As of 7 pm I am the only one here. Great view to the north to Burke’s Garden, an 8 mile by 4 mile limestone sinkhole. Quite spectacular to see really. Tomorrow I will be hiking along the rim of this sinkhole for about 8 miles. I have not investigated the water, which is 0.2 miles from here. Comments on Guthook indicate there may not be much flow, but I’m OK with water. I filled all 3 of my water bottles at a spring on the climb up, I have plenty of water for tonite and tomorrow AM. 
The only person I encountered on the trail today was The Ghost, he was sitting in Knot Maul Shelter when I arrived there at about 11:30. Apparently he was carrying a container of permithrein (sp, an insect repellent) that leaked in his pack during the nite and got on some of his gear, so he was drying everything out. The rest of the gang that had also spent the nite at that shelter (Capt. Blackbeard, Mainer, Sour Patch & T500) had left in the AM. The Ghost got on the trail just a few minutes after I left that shelter, and he blew by me. It was his intent to catch the group by the end of the day, and as fast as he hikes he’ll probably do it.
On thing very curious happened this afternoon just as I was starting my climb up to Chestnut Knob. First I found a perfectly fine and unopened granola bar laying on the trail, then about 50’ later an unopened snack pack of crackers with peanut butter. I naturally picked them up and ate them later that afternoon, but I wonder....could these snacks be a sign of some kind, that someone is watching out for me and that I absolutely need to finish this AT thru hike????

That shelter sits on an exposed hill, no tree cover. Let me tell you, was I glad I was in the shelter and not outside in my tent. The shelter was nice and solid, new metal roof and no leaks that I could see. It sure was noisy though when those storms came through, but thanks to my earplugs I was able to get a decent nites sleep. 
Got a little bit of a later start (6:45 AM) than I would have liked for two reasons:  i) the fog/mist was so thick, I was mildly concerned with finding my way along the trail before daylight; and ii) it was raining very heavily at 6, and I could see from the radar that this heavy band of showers would soon be past me. It was worth waiting. As it was it turned out to be a dreary, miserable day. Thick mist and a cold intermittent rain. I am glad to be in a shelter again tonite. Once again I am the only one here. I saw not a single person all day today. Where is everybody?  I know there’s a group of 5 (Capt. Blackbeard et. al. ) about a day ahead of me, and there’s several folks behind me. Of course the really big hiker bubble started maybe 2 weeks ago and will continue thru mid April, but those folks that started in March are quite a ways behind. I really do miss the rest of the Four Horsemen right now.  Capt. Blackbeard is about a day ahead of me and is doing big miles.  Jeep is a few days behind me.  Night Train is back home getting ready to start PT on his knee.
All in all a pretty uneventful day, although I did carry a bag of wood shavings back to the moldering privy at Jenkins Shelter. That is the least I can do. 
I am not looking forward to putting on my cold wet boots and other wet items of clothing in the morning. Last forecast I saw was it is supposed to get cold overnite, oh well. The best remedy in the AM is to get dressed and pack up quickly, then get moving and keep moving.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584633,"I was by myself at the shelter last nite, which allowed me to spread out and hang stuff  in an effort to get my wet clothes dry. Woke up this AM to about 4” of snow and below freezing temps.  At first I started bemoaning the fact that it was winter, but it is what it is and the best thing to do is to embrace it. Sure, some of the clothes that I had to put on to start the day were still damp and had frozen overnite - but they will thaw out quickly and I will survive. Yes, my boots were frozen in the morning (I know enough at least to loosen the laces and widen the boots so I can get them on in the AM), but once I start hiking my feet will lose their chill. Those things aside, the trail in winter has its own beauty - best to just cope and enjoy it. Those of you that have read my early entries know that I do some winter backpacking in the Adirondacks, where deep snow and minus 20 degree temps are not uncommon. For those trips my gear is entirely different ( different clothes, warmer sleeping bag, insulated boots, snowshoes/crampons, etc.) and my pack is a lot heavier. I’d hate to be lugging around all that winter specific gear here on the AT, my body couldn’t handle carrying that heavy of a pack day after day. 
The one single biggest irritant that I have about the cold temps on the AT is having to get out of my sleeping bag 3 or 4 times during the course of a nite to pee. Of course when I’m with the younger bucks they all have a laugh over this frequent nightly urination. Laugh it up guys, your time will come some day, HaHa. I don’t know what is bringing on these frequent urges to pee, at home I had to get up typically only once during the nite. Maybe it is the crisp cool Appalachian Mt. air. In any event I’ll have to check with my doctor when I get home. It is a pain having to get out of that warm sleeping bag on a cold nite. I do use a pee bottle when the opportunity allows (e.g. in my tent), but even then I have to get out of my sleeping bag. I have not attempted the technique of using a pee bottle while tucked in my sleeping bag. A mishap would not be pleasant, if you know what I mean. 
I did cross paths with a flip-flopper today, Jelly Bean, who was headed south. He will complete his AT thru hike at the GA/NC state line. Congrats Jelly Bean, you are on the home stretch!
I am spending tonite at Woods Hole Hostel, and Neville the owner will shuttle me back in the AM to VA 606, today’s stopping point for me. I will then hike about 15 miles tomorrow back to Woods Hole, spending a second nite here. Woods Hole is a very nice hostel indeed, Neville is a great host and cook. The hostel is very tastefully decorated and furnished and has all the usual amenities. Apparently Woods Hole was recently voted the No. 1 hostel on the AT. As fate would have it the power has been knocked out by the winter storm that is passing through, but fortunately Woods Hole has an emergency generator so no big deal.

To make a long story short, last nite Scratch got his vehicle stuck in a ditch about 200 yds. from the hostel. Been there, done that, I can relate. It is no small wonder he slid off the road, Woods Hole is very remote on a long and curvy gravel road that is not plowed, and it was snow covered and icy yesterday. The first task of the day was to get him unstuck, which we thankfully accomplished in short order. Neville then shuttled me back to VA 606, where I continued my northbound hike. I did carry my full pack, thus I am so far at least sticking to my guns of avoiding a slackpack. 
Overall it was a pretty decent day today, still a fair amount of snow on the trail but the sun did come out in the afternoon and there were some views from on high of Wilburn Valley. The high up high I’m guessing was maybe 32 degrees, and the wind wasn’t bad. Again I did not see anyone on the trail today. 
One thing that I did have to contend with was the low hanging mountain laurel branches (see photo). Many sections of the AT here in the south are lined with these bushes and they form a canopy if you will over the trail (hence the reason that the AT is sometimes referred to as the green tunnel). Well with freezing rain of two days ago, followed by a fairly significant snowfall, the branches of these bushes were really bent down forming an obstruction that you couldn’t get around. Your choices were to plow through if able, or on occasion crawl under. 
I did manage to head butt quite severely one of the thicker branches, to the point that I was seeing stars. Ouch, that hurt, I niw have quite a lump on my noggin. I thought to myself if I knock myself out I might be laying on the ground in the snow for awhile. PAY ATTENTION DUMMY I told myself. If the other 3 horsemen would have been there to witness my head butting incident they would have been laughing it up pretty good. I can hear them now:  “...Hey Opa, when the branches are as thick as your arm don’t try to ram through...Hey Opa, you’ve already demonstrated that you are a hard headed German, no need for a further demonstration...Hey Opa, maybe you should start wearing a hard hat on the trail...”.  I do miss those guys!
When I arrived back at Woods Hole late this afternoon, lo and behold the gang was there taking a Nero:  Capt. Blackbeard, The Ghost, T5000, Sour Patch, Mainer. Also here is a flip flopper, Juice Box. Good to see all these young folks together, they are a good group and seem to get along very well. 
My plan for tomorrow is to do a Nero into Pearisburg, about 11 miles from here. I have a maildrop waiting for me there thanks to my loyal trail angel Kayanne back home!

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584788,"Left Woods Hole Hostel at 5:45 AM, hiked a half mile down the gravel road to the AT and was on the trail hiking at 6. It was chilly (water bottles started to ice up) until the sun came out, then it turned into a nice day. I arrived at the Narrows Rd. Parking area exactly at noon, and was shuttled over (I had previously called from Angel’s Rest up on the mountain) to the Angel’s Rest Hiker Haven hostel by Handy who manages the place. He showed me around when we arrived, it seems like a great hostel. Well organized, clean and all the hiker essentials (heat, bunks, showers, laundry, gathering room, kitchen facilities, etc.). Handy is an AT thru hiker, he knows what hikers need, and has been extremely helpful since I’ve been here. I like the place. 
As far as today’s hiking was concerned, at the lower elevations there wasn’t much snow. However I had spent much of the morning hiking along a wide ridge that was between 3,000 and 4,000 feet. Lots of snow up top, including some drifts that were up to my knees. I had to trailbreak much of the way along the ridge, postholing through the crusted over snow with every step. That really slowed me down, and it was tiring. In addition in some cases it was difficult to tell where the trail went, I had to rely on Guthook’s GPS a couple of times. Once again I didn’t see a soul on the trail. 
Another winter storm is being forecast for the area, with significant amounts up top. For tomorrow the forecast for up high is rain first, then sleet and freezing rain, then snow. Staying here at the hostel are thru hikers La Copa, Bolt and Tuna, nice guys and strong hikers that I had run into before. This AM they were heading north from I believe Rice Field Shelter. They said the conditions were the worst they had seen on the trail, with deep snow and drifts up to their waist. After about a mile they elected to call Handy for a shuttle back to the hostel, and will be taking a Zero tomorrow - and maybe longer depending on what the weather does. It sounds to me like they made a good call. We need a break from all this winter weather, and need some of the snow to melt. 
My plans for tomorrow were originally to have Handy shuttle me to a point near Rice Field Shelter and then hike back southbound approximately 20 miles to the hostel. We were going to leave early 5:15 AM with about a 20 minute drive to the trailhead so that I’d be able to hike the ridge line and beat the worst of the weather.  However after following the steadily worsening weather forecast (Urma) I’ve decided at the last minute to cancel and will be spending a Zero here tomorrow, maybe even on Sunday. 
This afternoon I walked to the nearby plaza to get something to eat and ran into Capt. Blackbeard, The Ghost, T5000 & Sour Patch. They, along with Mainer, hiked here later this AM from Woods Hole and all five of them are crammed into a single motel room to save some bucks. We ate together at an AYCE Chinese restaurant. They plan on taking a Zero tomorrow.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584841,"Today started out overcast when I got up, but it wasn’t snowing/raining. However by noon the snow started coming down at a pretty heavy rate; I’m certain that high up on the ridge/mountains that the snow started earlier and came down heavier. At first when I didn’t see any snow in the AM I was second guessing my decision to take a Zero, but as the day went on and the heavy snow started I think I made the right call. Nobody likes taking a Zero on top of a Nero, but sometimes we just have to relent and let Mother Nature have her way. 
Besides myself there are 8 other thru hikers holed up in Pearisburg riding out this storm:  Capt. Blackbeard, The Ghost, Sour Patch, T5000, Mainer, La Copa, Bolt & Tuna. We’re going to see what it looks like in the AM, but there’s a distinct possibility that some/all of us could be holed up here another day depending on what the weather does. We keep telling ourselves that sooner or later it has got to get better!
This AM I walked through the town, there wasn’t a whole lot to see/do. I had lunch at a local family restaurant, stopped at both Walmart and the local grocery store and picked up a few goodies that I brought back to the hostel for the guys. For dinner I  cooked up some freeze dried with tuna , as I had extra that just won’t fit in my food bag for the next leg. Peach pie from the grocery store is our dessert. 
This sitting around doing nothing is killing all of us thru hikers, and we may have a repeat tomorrow. It is what it is. Glad I have a phone, internet, books on my kindle, etc. I am currently reading “Fire and Fury” by Michael Wolf, an expose of the early days in the Trump White House. It’s an Ok read. 
I did get to Facetime with Eric, Amy and the grandkids today. Gosh I miss them!  Next weekend I will be rendezvousing with my brother John in Roanoke and spending some time with him. Looking forward to it immensely. Hopefully this snow will let up so that I can pound out some miles and get closer to Roanoke this week. John will pick me up wherever I am, but regardless I need to get closer just for my own schedule (and sanity). This sitting around is really getting old. I am avoiding the TV room as much as possible as the other hikers that are here are playing one movie after another, none of which I’ve ever heard of nor do I have any interest in watching.  Thank God for the smartphone. 
I did go online today and order two items for the trail that I’m having sent to John. One was a pair of waterproof socks. It seems that the waterproofing (GTX) in my Vasque boots is no longer working. In the snow/rain the boots wet out very quickly, and then of course they take forever to dry. Lately I’ve been using plastic bags over my feet/socks and that works OK, but folks that are using the waterproof socks like them so I am going to give them a try. The second item I ordered was a selfie stick for my phone to help with the picture taking. 
I am safe, warm and dry in the hostel tonite. Hoping for the best tomorrow AM in terms of the weather, but have pretty much resolved myself to the fact that I will be taking another Zero. Goodnite.","Angel’s Rest Hiker Haven Hostel

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/584906,"After looking outside and checking the radar, I decided to hit the trail today. The snow had stopped and the radar looked good. I expected to hit heavier snowcover up top, but I needed to get moving even if it was only for a few trail miles. 
After breakfast I hoofed it over the 1.7 miles to Holy Family Church to attend the 8:30 Mass. When I got there the parking lot was empty, the doors were locked and there was agentleman just finishing shoveling the sidewalk. He made a call and informed me that mass was canceled due to the weather. I could hardly believe what I was hearing. Pearisburg did receive some wet snow overnite and there were isolated power outages (including a brief outage at the hostel), but the roads were plowed on my walk over. The weather in my opinion certainly didn’t merit cancelling mass - on Palm Sunday no less. Oh well, I tried.  
The gentleman that had been shoveling gave me a ride back to the hostel, I made myself a sandwich for a quick and early lunch, packed up and headed out. I said my goodbyes to La Copa, Bolt and Tuna, as well as to Handy (the hostel manager). Overall I really enjoyed my two nite stay at Angel’s Rest Hiker Haven, and would recommend it. Handy is a great guy,  being a hiker he knows what we want in a hostel, and he made me feel very welcome. 
I had a 1.7 mile road walk from the hostel back to the trailhead at VA 100. I tried hitchhiking, but no luck. I was finally back on the trail. After about 3 miles the gang passed me (Capt. Blackbeard, The Ghost, Sour Patch, T5000 and Mainer). Trail breaking wasn’t too bad up to that point,  but the snow was steadily getting deeper as we gained elevation. I was more than happy to let the young gang take over trailbreaking duties. About 2:30 we reached Rice Field Shelter, 6.7 miles into the hike. The gang elected to stop there for the nite, but being there was still plenty of daylight left I elected to push on a couple more miles and stealth camp.  Let me tell you it was very slow going as at this point I was on the ridgeline and the snow was deep. Staying on trail was also a challenge, and several times I had to rely on the Guthook GPS feature to keep me on trail. I found a good spot to camp, setup camp quickly, made dinner and hung my bear bag. I am now in my sleeping bag for the nite. 
Tomorrow I’m not going to proceed with my customary early start in view of the deep snow and difficulties with staying on trail; rather I will wait for daylight before heading out. Aside from all the snow, it was a pleasant, sunny day today. I hope it continues. I didn’t pound out a lot of miles today, but am OK with that as it was slow going.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585058,"It was a chilly morning, took me about 20 minutes to thaw my boots out enough so that I could get them on. I got a later start than normal, not because I needed the sleep but because I wanted full daylight to follow the trail. The trail was unbroken and the snow was deep, so it was difficult to follow. White blazes were also pretty far apart in spots. It took me 3 hours to go 3 miles. Every step I took was a posthole; sometimes only a few inches deep, sometimes up to mid-calf. Very exhausting.  The snow had a crust on top as well that I punched thru, which made it even worse. The gang (Capt. Blackbeard, The Ghost, T5000, Sour Patch and Mainer) caught me somewhere around 11 and took over trailbreaking for me, which was a huge relief. Once we dropped down off the ridge to a lower elevation the snow depth got progressively less. The way the day started I figured I’d be doing well with an 8 mile day. It took all day, but I am pleased with the 14.5 miles. However my butt was dragging by the time I got to the shelter. There are 6 of us at the shelter tonite, me plus the gang. 
 I did manage to smash my head into a branch again. It happened at a stream where I was getting water, and this time I drew blood. The Capt. was there to witness it. I tell ya, if I was any clumsier they’d have to put me in a straightjacket.
In going forward tomorrow it appears that the trail is broken out with a few footsteps anyway, that is good news. Hopefully the warming trend that has been forecast will also pan out - it will be good to get rid of this snow so that we can all pound out some miles. Everyone kept telling me the “....once you hit Virginia it gets easy and you’ll really be able to rack up big daily miles...”. HaHa, I haven’t seen it yet!

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585135,"I am certainly glad that I wasn’t in my tent last nite, as it must have rained/sleeted overnite and froze judging by the coating of ice that was on the trees this morning. It would have been a real joy packing up my tent in that mess. I knew it got down below freezing overnite, as my boots were once again frozen when I went to put them on this AM. I did get rained on for the first hour of my hike, but then it stopped. It remained overcast all day till about 5 PM when the sun finally made an appearance. 
The trail itself wasn’t that bad. The snow was still deep in spots, but it had been broken out. I believe the tracks we were following were those made by AT thru hikers La Copa, Bolt and Tuna. The back roads must have finally been clear to the point where they were able to get a shuttle ride back to the trailhead from where they got off a couple days ago. Having a broken out trail certainly made things easier for those that followed. 
From my perspective, and taking into account the weather and trail conditions, Virginia has been the toughest state I’ve hiked in so far - and I’ve only covered about 200 miles in Virginia so far, with still over 300 to go. Those 300 miles could be a flatlander turkey walk, and I’d still say Virginia has been the toughest. Tougher than Georgia. Tougher than North Carolina. Tougher than Tennessee. And folks always say that once you hit Virginia you’ll really be able to pound out long miles. Ha!  I’m not buying it. The Virginia weather and deep snow put it over the top. Today I only did 14.6 miles, and in view of the trail conditions I’m very happy with 14.6 miles. 
Things did start to warm up this afternoon, so I am optimistic that trail conditions will quickly start to improve. It’s supposed to reach the 60s tomorrow, which will really help to knock down this snow. 
I passed by a flip-flop thru hiker headed southbound by the name of Crockett, and a section hiker that goes by Nameless. I was also passed by a gal that flew by me. She was not interested in conversation, as she seemed on a mission. I later found out that she was a former hiking record holder of some kind, and that she is in training. Tonite I’m in a shelter with section hiker Brant and his dog Garvey. Brant is hiking back yo Damascas, as he works for one of the outfitters in that town. The gang of young ‘ens went on ahead another 6 miles to the next shelter. Ah, to be young again, HaHa. 
Cell phone coverage is really spotty the past couple days. No service in the last couple shelters, meaning I’ll try to post this tomorrow from up on a ridge.

This morning, for the first time in several days, my boots weren’t frozen. Sure they were still soaked from the wet snow we hiked through most of yesterday, but I’ll take wet boots over frozen boots any day. 
Today’s hike took me past the Keffer Oak. With a trunk that’s 18’ in circumference, it is the second largest oak on the AT (the largest being in NY). Wow!  Today’s hike also took me past the Audie Murphy Monument. According to the plaque at the monument, Mr. Murphy was the most decorated soldier of World War II. I also passed by a sign on a ridge that read “Continental Divide”.  Rainwater on one side of the ridge ends up in the Gulf of Mexico, and on the other side in the Atlantic Ocean. There were also long sections of ridge hiking today along cliffs that afforded great views - reminded me of some of the trails that I’ve hiked in the northeast. I also enjoyed a nice leisurely hot lunch at Nidday Shelter.  All in all it was a great day of hiking. Temperatures got up into the 60s, which really knocked down the snow. For the most part the trail was clear of snow. In the afternoon I was in a tee shirt and shorts. It felt great!
I saw a few more people on the trail, a couple of section hikers and a dayhiker. Here tonite at Pickle Branch Shelter there are 3 section hikers camped out in tents, and the gang of 5 young ‘ens that I’ve been hanging with are staying in the shelter.

I went over the 700 mile mark today, which means I only have about 1,500 miles to go of enjoying the trail. Yikes, it’s going by fast. 
I hiked alone again today which I actually enjoy, very peaceful. The only people I saw on the trail were 3 or 4 dayhikers going south. I got to see a great sunrise today from the ridge, beautiful. Today’s hike also took me past Dragons Tooth, a huge stone monolith. I took lots of pictures but they don’t do it justice.

I took a quick shower and got into some clean clothes that John brought along for me, then back to the Homeplace for dinner with the guys.

We ran a few errands in the morning, first stop being at a local shoe repair shop (The Shoe Doctor) to see if he could do something with the frayed hipbelt on my pack. Rather than stitch it, he cauterized the frayed edge with a Bic lighter. Not only didn’t he charge me a dime, but when he heard that I was an AT thru hiker he handed me a couple bottles of water and wished me well!  Folks sure are friendly here in the south. Next stop was Walmart for some resupply items (I didn’t need much, what with all the food/snacks that John brought and that was sent me....thank you to all) then we headed to the historic downtown area of Roanoke. We walked around for awhile and stopped in a few shops. I stopped in Walkabout Outfitter to pick up some liner socks and a bottle of waterproofing spray for my boots in an effort to restore the waterproofing of the GTX. Next up was a stop in an ice cream shop, I had a large milkshake and John had a large cone. Next we had a lunch of fish and chips. Then back to the hotel for a snack, then a nap. 
Tonite for dinner John served me his homemade goulash with noodles, a tossed salad, and sourdough bread and butter. My family knows what a great cook John is, and true to form his goulash was most excellent. He dished me out a bowl that would’ve fed a family of four, but I did it justice. Sweets followed dinner (donuts and chocolates). At this rate I will be the only AT thru hiker to actually GAIN weight on the trail, HaHa.  
Tomorrow I’m going to take John up on his very kind offer to drive me back to the Catawba trailhead, from where I will hike approx. 20 miles to the trailhead in Daleville where John will pick me up and bring me back to the hotel.

I certainly hope that the unseasonably cold temps and significant snowfall are behind us. Mother Nature, a stretch of weather like we had today would be much appreciated. 
John dropped me off at the trailhead at 6 this AM, and I was on my way up to McAfee Knob. As I got closer to the summit there were many folks, many of whom were  young adults, that were on their way down. I am certain they had been on the summit early to catch the sunrise. When I reached the summit there were still several folks up there enjoying the fantastic view. Me and another thru hiker, whose name escapes me, were actually “interviewed” by one individual as she shot video. I stayed for several minutes, and of course had my picture taken while sitting with my legs dangling over the edge. It is my understanding that McAfee Knob is the most photographed spot on the entire AT. My next hiking view spot was Tinker Cliffs, a 0.5 mile cliff walk that afforded views back towards McAfee Knob.  Overall it was a beautiful trail today, lots of views and gentle grades. There was one spot were I heard what sounded like it could be a rattlesnake rattle, but then I looked up and saw it was coming from a high voltage electric line. As I got closer the rattle became louder, to the point that I was half expecting my hair to get curly - of course my hair is so short right now, there’s not enough there to get curly, HaHa. 
Two other thru hikers that I also encountered today were Tuna and Blue Haze. Tuna was at Angel’s Rest while I was there and had taken some time off the trail to spend with his sister. Blue Haze is a flip flopper. When I asked him about his trail name, one of the reasons is that he’s a LSU fan. He told me he’s been following my journal since day one, and said I should be called freight train the way I pound out the miles. Ha, he should have seen me struggling along through the snow drifts several days ago - my name then would more appropriately have been “broken down lumber wagon”.
I arrived at the Daleville trailhead at 3:30, and there was John waiting to greet me about a half mile into the trail.

From the outside it looks a little like Cinderella’s castle at Disney (which incidentally was modeled after Neuschwanstein castle in Bavaria, Germany). John then drove me to the trailhead in Daleville, and he drove back home to Winston-Salem, NC. What a great weekend I had spending time with my brother, he treated me royally and did his best to fatten me back up. He succeeded in having me gain a few pounds, of that I’m certain. We had a great time together. 
I do miss the family on a holiday like today. Kayanne and I normally have Easter dinner at her brothers where I enjoy visiting with her family. We did facetime, but it’s not the same. 
I started hiking today at 8:30 AM, and did not encounter any other thru hikers. However I did cross paths with a couple of section hikers and several weekend backpackers. For a couple miles I hiked with John, a section hiker from Kentucky. He is a teacher and is currently on a week break, and plans to hike the section from Catawba to the start of Shenandoah National Park. 
Today’s weather was pretty good:  comfortable temps, little wind and no rain. However it was cloudy. Nevertheless I will gladly take today’s weather, after enduring some of the other”junk” that we’ve had of late. 
The last 7 miles or so of today’s hike followed along the Blue Ridge Parkway, which the AT will closely follow for the next 100 miles. At one of the parking areas that the AT crosses thru I was the subject of interest for a family that had stopped to enjoy an overlook. The husband/father immigrated to the US  from China 20 years ago, is now a US citizen, and lives on Long Island. He shot video footage of me as I answered some of his basic questions about the AT and thru hiking. It was fun, I think I did OK, HaHa. Today’s hike also took me thru a cow pasture, and along the Blue Ridge Parkway I saw 6 white tailed deer. 
My initial goal for today was Bobletts Gap Shelter at mile 747.7. When I reached the side trail for the shelter it was only 5:30 with a couple hours of daylight left, so I decided to keep going and pound out a couple more miles. Tomorrow will be a long hard day with lots of climbing elevation, so going a couple extra miles today will help. I am trying to leave myself with only a 15 mile day on Tuesday into Glasgow, where I have my next maildrop coming from Kayanne.

I met a couple of section hikers on the trail today. Gentleman, a 63 year old retiree who is section hiking from Damascas to Katahdin (wow, talk about a long section). He is from the Toledo, OH area and is in great shape. Like me he is trying to average about 15 miles per day. 
I also met Alex, 30, who is a flip-flopper. He has been on the trail a total of 4 days, starting in Troutsville and heading north. Both Gentleman and Alex are in the shelter with me tonite. 
Today’s hike was rather uneventful, except for the Guillotine, an interesting rock formation that I passed through towards the end of the day. 6,500’ in climbing elevation today, which means I burned off a lot of calories. Since it was raining when I broke camp this AM I didn’t really eat much of anything, but at the first shelter that I came to (Cove Mountain Shelter) I fixed myself a hot meal of Ramen with tuna mixed in. It doesn’t sound that great, but trust me, on the trail even warmed up shoe leather would hit the spot. Well, maybe not shoe leather. 
I crossed the Blue Ridge Parkway once today, and I thought of my mother. She annually drove from Rochester down to Florida and back every year, snd she often went by way of the Blue Ridge Parkway. I think that route added a few miles to her drive, but she loved the scenery and would occasionally stop and go for a short hike.  It is quite possible that Mom walked a section(s) of the same AT that I am now hiking. Mom passed away in 2010, and I know she is looking down on me from above and helping to keep me safe!

This is a very nice hostel, neat, clean and all the amenities. The caretaker Donna showed me around and made me feel very welcome. I like getting into a hostel by early afternoon at the latest when taking a Nero, this leaves plenty of time for the associated tasks (shower, laundry, sort thru my maildrop, resupply shopping and of course eating).  
As far as my pace/schedule are concerned, I’m doing fine. My first leg goal was to be at Mt. Moosilauke by mid-June. To reach that goal I basically need to average 14.5 miles per day. I am currently 53 days into my hike and am at AT mile 786. This averages out to 14.8 mpd, and takes into account lower mileage in the beginning, Neros and Zeros. I guess I’m doing ok from a mileage standpoint.
Here at the hostel tonite are section hikers John and Gentleman, and a vacationing family of four. We’ve got plenty of room, we’re all very comfortable.
Once again I’d like to thank all of you that are following me on trailjournals.com, and for your continued interest and words of encouragement. Special thanks also to my wife and best friend Kayanne (I miss you dearly), and the rest of my family for your ongoing support. I miss you all. A special shout out to my good friend Bill Schweinfurth, who daily texts me “Go Opa” and “Good Luck Reinhard” pictures;  thanks Bill. The support and encouragement from all of you mean a lot.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585802,"Breakfast at 6 at Stanimal’s (thank you Donna for accomodating my request for an early breakfast), then Donna shuttled Gentleman  and I to the US 501 trailhead.  Lo and behold but Capt. Blackbeard and Mainer were just coming across the James River Bridge to greet us. Later that day we saw the rest of the Young Guns (T5000, Sour Patch and Ghost). It was good to see them all again, they are hanging together and doing well. 
The day started out with an intermittent light rain;  I must have put on and taken off my raingear maybe 5 or 6 times by 10.  It eventually cleared up but it was quite windy. The weather service had issued a wind advisory, predicting sustained winds of 25 to 45 mph with gusts over 50. Depending on which side of a mountain/ridge you were on, you either had a lot/little wind. I actually got hit in the leg with a dead branch that came flying down off a tree as I was hiking.  Really nice trail today, with some good views from on high of the James River Valley. 
There are 7 of us tonite in our 6-person shelter:  section hikers Rangeley and Gentleman, and thru hikers Wildfire, T5000, Capt. Blackbeard, Mainer and Opa. For safety reasons it is preferred not to setup a tent with this wind, don’t need to run the risk of a “widow maker” tree coming down on somebody’s tent. I arrived at the shelter at 3:30 with plenty of daylight left and ordinarily I would have pounded out a few more miles and stealth camped, but not under these windy conditions - better to stay put in the hard walled shelter. 
Speaking of wind, a couple of weeks back I met SOBO Juice Box at Woods Hole Shelter. She was in the Shenandoahs when a freak storm came thru with 70 mph winds.  She ran for her life two miles to a hard walled restroom with trees crashing down all around her. Two people were killed by this storm, one from a tree falling down on them and the other from hypothermia (combination of cold temps and windchill). A windstorm is not something to be taken lightly. 
A big Happy Birthday wish to Jacob, who is the son of our nephew Matthew and his wife Missy of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Jacob turns three today, Happy Birthday big guy!

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586040,"Left the shelter and was hiking at 5:40 AM. I knew this would be a long day, so I wanted to get an early start. I was awake anyway, no big deal. Again I tried to be very quiet when packing up in the AM so as not to disturb the 6 other hikers staying in the shelter, but it is hard not to make a little noise when packing up. 
It was a cold morning. My water bottles were not frozen when I got up, but after a couple hours they turned into slushies - so I knew it had to be below freezing. Lots if hoar frost on the trail as well. However it was a beautiful clear and sunny day, so I am happy with that. In the afternoon it even warmed up enough where I could peel a layer and hike in my shorts. 
6,700 ft. of climbing elevation today according to Guthook, I believe this is the most yet for me. Much of the climbing was in the AM, which is good for me. My legs are fresh then, and I can usually give it a pretty good go then. In the afternoon my legs are a bit tired, so the uphills become more of a challenge.
I did not meet any other thru hikers on the trail today. However there were several dayhikers out enjoying the sunshine while getting a few miles in. I also met Burger Feet, a LASHer (Long Ass Section Hiker). He started 2 days ago in Glasgow, and is headed to Port Clinton, PA. Here is here in the shelter tonite as well. He got his name because a year ago he was section hiking, but had the wring hiking shoes. He says his feet were a bloody mess, and he had to get off the trail. One if his sons is a Navy Seal, actually the youngest ever on the east coast. His son must be one tough dude to be able to survive the training that the Seals dish out!
Another relatively long day for me tomorrow, as I want to position myself for a lower mileage Nero into Waynesboro on Sat. where I have a maildrop waiting for me and will be spending the nite.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/585918,"The day started well enough. I got an early start, knowing I had a long day ahead of me if I wanted to get to Waynesboro by mid-day on Saturday. Then for some reason I apparently decided today would be my day for taking falls. I fell four times today, one of them hard. Nothing broken, but I have several aches and pains:  my forehead, right hand, left elbow and left knee all ache pretty good as I lay in my tent tonite. My left knee in particular is pretty sore, cut up and a bit swollen. I must have fallen on a rock pretty hard with the knee, as it put a tear in my rainpants - which have a pretty durable fabric. Tenacious tape to the rescue on my pants - but I don’t think the tape will do much for my knee. The funny thing is, I didn’t fall in any of the steeper sections of trail - it was always on a gradual slope. Go figure!
I also pulled a real bonehead move today by hiking the same section of trail 3 times. Nothing like making a long day needlessly longer. One of the peaks I summited today was 3,937 ft Three Ridges Mountain. On the way down I passed a Boy Scout troop out for an overnite backpack (some schools are on break right now). 0.8 miles down from the summit there is an overlook (Hanging Rock Overlook) that offers a spectacular view of the valley below. I stopped, had my picture taken by a dayhiker, and proceed on my way. About 20 minutes later after an uphill climb I came across what I thought was another Boy Scout troop. The conversation with one of the scout leaders went something like this (OPA’S LINES ARE IN CAPS):“....HI, ARE YOU PART OF THAT SAME SCOUT TROOP I PASSED EARLIER....sir, were you intending to come up to the summit twice today....WHADDYA MEAN COME UP TWICE....sir, which direction are you intending to thru hike the AT, northbound or southbound...I’M A NORTHBOUNDER, THAT’S WHY I’M HEADING NORTH...sir, you are headed south right now, you must have gotten turned around at the overlook...”.Nothing like setting a good example for the scouts, they must have all had a good laugh after I turned around and went back down (again). I tell ya, you can’t make this stuff up. 
Well, tomorrow is another day - I will try not to fall and will do my best to stay headed NORTHBOUND!!!

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586039,"I slept like a dead rock last nite. I was pretty sore when I crawled into my sleeping bag from all my falls yesterday so I decided to take a couple Tylenol PMs when going to bed. They worked!  In addition I didn’t have to get up once during the nite to go to the bathroom. Maybe the Tylenol PMs had something to do with it, I don’t know. But boy, when I did wake up I had to pee like a race horse. 
I woke up at 4:15, and was glad not to hear any rain. Great, I packed up my tent while it was dry (thank you Mother Nature) and had no sooner done so than it started to rain. It did not rain long, but later that morning we had sleet and then snow - but not enough to stick. Overhearing the local folks here in town they are all in a panic because of the snow. I just chuckle to myself, this little piddly snow is really nothing. 
The hike today down to town was pretty easy. Not much climbing and the trails were nicely graded (not a lot of rocks/roots to contend with). My left knee is still sore, but it’ll be fine. I made good time and was at Rockfish Gap by 10:30 where I called Adam, the owner of Stanimal’s 328 Hostel in Waynesboro. He was there within 10 minutes to pick me up. Of course while I was waiting I had to buy a bag of caramel corn from the roadside stand that was there, I couldn’t resist. Waynesboro itself, population I’m told of about 30,000, claims to be the largest town along the AT. I’m not sure about that, since Waynesboro is not actually ON the AT (it’s about 5 miles away)  
At the hostel there are about 10 of us here, including all of the Young Guns and several flip floppers and section hikers  I did not catch everyone’s name, but they included Clank, ROAM (stands for Retired and On A Mission), Fairy Floss and Dave. The hostel is great, has lots of space, is clean and has all the amenities. The owner Adam is a great guy, he even drove me to a Walmart so that I could get my glasses fixed! I was also able to walk to a nearby Catholic Church (St. John’s the Evangelist) for their Saturday 5 PM mass. 
For dinner tonite Sour Patch and Ghost fixed a big pot of pasta with meat sauce, bread and green beans. About 8 of us sat around the dining room table and broke bread together, which was nice. I was in charge of cleanup, I recruited a few of the guys and we got it done quickly. 
I got to facetime tonite with Eric and Evelyn, plus Kayanne and our good friends Rita and Beth. Ladies nite out!

There was snow on the trail in the AM, but it was gone by noon as it warmed up into the 40s. Sunshine all day. 
I entered the south end of Shenandoah National Park (SNP) today, and filled out the permit form which is attached to my pack. The shelter I am staying at, Blackrock Hut (they call shelters huts here in the SNP) is quite nice, a stone shelter, double decker, with a bear pole to hang our bear bags. A full shelter tonite, in addition to the 5 Young Guns and myself there are two SOBOs that are newlyweds (Spice and Shaker) that started in Massachusetts in the dead of winter. Ouch. As newlyweds no less.   They seem in great spirits, power to them! Also here at the shelter is Burger Feet, and a couple of folks that have hung their hammocks. A good group, folks are respectful of one another and there’s good humor/camraderie. Everyone is experiencing the same thing on the trail, so we can all relate to the various adventures/misadventures we are going through.  A pretty easy trail today, not a lot of rocks/roots and even though we had about 5,000 ft of climbing elevation the grades were gradual. I did manage to fall twice early on in today’s hike, as the rocks were icy and snow covered. I am fine, no injuries, they were soft landings. I am now up to 10 falls total, only one of which was a hard fall. yesterday’s easy rest day at the hostel did wonders for my aches/pains from the previous day’s falls, I felt great today. 
In response to the very nice trailjournals guest book entry from Julie (thank you), I have the following answers to the two questions you posed: 1. I am not familiar with the Conservation Trail, sorry. 2. PCT style means Pacific Crest Trail style. I would not do justice in describing, and would suggest you do a google search. There are several excellent youtube videos demonstrating this technique. The PCT method involves using a short stick (there are plenty of those around) and tying a clove hitch. This method does not require you to find that perfect horizontal branch about 15’ up - that looks so good in the illustrations, but can be difficult to find at a camping spot. With very few exceptions bear canisters are not required along the AT. As I recall there were some relatively short sections in Georgia requiring canisters. In addition I’d say about a third of the shelters along the trail so far have either steel bear boxes, cables or bear poles. Julie, you sound like an amazing person/athlete and I wish you the best. I am glad that the picture of Link proved to be inspirational. He has enjoyed his hikes with me in the Adirondacks, and I hope to get him up there this summer to climb a couple more high peaks. He is a tough kid and I think he has the makings of a real mountain man, if I can get him away long enough from his parents and two sisters, HaHa.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586252,"Hey Mother Nature, is that all you’ve got for the second week of April in Virginia?  Temps in the 20s overnite, a few inches of snow and totally overcast skies all day - that’s it?  It’s going to take a lot more than that to knock Opa and the 5 Young Guns off the trail. Come on Mother Nature, hit us with your best shot!
I should know better than to talk smack to Mother Nature, but my prior pleadings for better weather fell on deaf ears so I’m trying a different approach. 
As you can gather from the above, today was another winter day. It started snowing as soon as I hit the trail this AM at 5:15, and snowed all morning. Not heavy, but enough. And it was below freezing most of the day as my water bottles once again became slushies. It was also overcast all day, which meant zero views from the many fine outlooks in SNP that existed along the trail. Oh well, there’s always tomorrow. 
My original goal for today was Hightop Hut, but I got there at 3:45 with plenty of daylight left so I decided to hike on for a few more miles. I am stealth camped in an area not far from one of the many AT crossings of Skyline Drive. I will have another long day tomorrow, the goal being to have a short Nero into Luray on Wed. I did pass the 900 mile mark today, another milestone. 
I saw no other NOBOs on the trail, not even any of the Young Guns who usually blow by me on the uphills. I suspect they are staying at Hightop Hut. I did cross paths with one SOBO (Cougar) who started last year on Katahdin and is headed to Springer. I also crossed paths with several dayhikers, and a group of four doing a week long section hike. 
At AT mile 891 I wanted to stop in to the Loft Mountain Campground camp store for a hot chocolate and to use the bathroom, only to find out that it doesn’t open till May. Bummer. However a nice lady staying in an adjacent motel room with her friend saw me and said I could use their bathroom and give a charge to my phone. The ladies are former thru hikers, names Missing Kink and Pothole, and are active in ALDHA (I believe this stands for the Appalachian Long Distance Hikers Association). Thank you ladies for helping me out!
I also hiked thru areas that were hit by the 70 mph windstorm that hit a few weeks ago, as evidenced by the  blowdown that had been freshly cut to clear the trail. A big Thanks to parks crews and volunteers for promptly dealing with the cleanup so that the trail is clear!

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586333,"The day started out chilly with snow on the ground this AM, but it ultimately turned out to be a nice day. Clear skies with lots of sunshine (the sun felt so good), and by mid-afternoon the snow was pretty much gone. Early this morning, shortly after sunrise, I experienced clear skies above and clouds below me. Hiking above the clouds is always a special phenomenon that never ceases to amaze. 
The trail itself was spectacular, generally easy hiking with lots of overlooks with great views. SNP is a special place for sure. Nature’s beauty is the best beauty as far as I’m concerned, far surpassing anything that man has built. I took several pictures of course, but they don’t do it justice. 
I took advantage of the sunshine and tied my wet socks of yesterday (and which I’ve worn for several days) to my pack to dry them out. It worked, by the end of the day they were totally dry. At one point I did notice quite a stench and wondered what that could be, until I realized it was my socks. Phewee!  
The trail today passed near one camp store (Lewis Mt. Campground, the store was open) and one wayside (Big Meadows). I stopped at both, as they involved relatively short side trails of less than half a mile each. At the camp store I had a hot chocolate, breakfast sandwich (biscuit, egg and sausage), sticky bun and moon pie. At first I wasn’t going to stop at the wayside, but gall darn it I told myself I couldn’t go thru the entire SNP without having one of their famous blackberry milkshakes. Of course I couldn’t just order a milkshake. I also ordered a bowl of soup. And a cheeseburger. And french fries. I guess I got my calories in today. 
I saw only a few dayhikers out today, one trail maintainer and met Alex at the wayside who is doing a 9 day section hike. Pretty quiet day on the trail. The trail also passed by a couple of car camping sites. At one of these there’s a man standing there who yells to me “Hey Opa”. I did not recognize this person at all, so I asked him if I knew him. He said no, but said he knew I’d be coming down the trail as he spoke with Alex. HaHa, that was strange. The man’s trail name from previous hikes is Movin On, and he says he’s been following my daily trailjournal posts. Small world. 
I was saddened to learn today that Ghost would be getting off the trail at Harper’s Ferry. I talked to him briefly today, and he has his reasons. I enjoyed being around him whenever we were on the trail together. He is polite, has a good sense of humor, and interacted well with the group. He is also a very strong hiker. He will be missed.
The 5 young guns are staying at a shelter a couple miles back, but I elected to push on a couple more miles and stealth camp. The owner of the hostel that I’m staying at tomorrow is a substitute teacher, and is only able to shuttle me from the trailhead at either 11:30 or 4. I want to catch the 11:30 shuttle, which means I need to pound out 12 miles in the AM. I’ll get my usual early morning start somewhere around 5:15, so it shouldn’t be a problem. The forecast calls for another chilly nite (28 deg) here at elevation, with warmer temps during the day. Laying here in my sleeping bag typing this out, I can feel the temps dropping quickly

Nice views once again, I have certainly enjoyed my hike thru SNP!  I was on the summit of Mary’s  Rock, mile 941.2, by 10. Great views. From there I had cell service, and coordinated with Alison (owner of Arm’s Rest Hostel where I am spending the nite) for final details pertaining to shuttle service. She picked me up at 11:30 at US 11. Perfect timing. The usual at the hostel this afternoon:  shower, laundry, go thru my maildrop (thank you Kayanne), resupply shopping, etc. For dinner tonite I picked up a roasted chicken, some bread, mac salad and a tossed salad, and will eat here at the hostel. They have network TV here, so I will look forward to watching the news. Life is good. 
I did not see any other thru hikers today, but crossed paths with 5 dayhikers that were making the two mile climb up Mary’s Rock as I was coming down. 
When I started my hike I expected that spring might catch me sometime in Virginia. I don’t know if she’ll make it, as I’ve only got a few more days before I hit West Virginia. Mother Nature, you better hurry up. There is no foliage at all on the deciduous trees so far, nothing - especially at elevation. One benefit of not having any foliage is that it opens up the views. 
I also haven’t seen any bears yet, which is disappointing as I’ve heard they are numerous in SNP. There certainly are plenty of bear warning signs up. With the cold weather they are probably still curled up in their dens waiting for warmer temps. If I was a bear I guess I’d do the same, HaHa! I have seen plenty of other wildlife, including: white tailed deer (they seem almost tame in SNP), rabbits, many squirrels, chipmunks, and of course field mice. At nite I also very often hear the howls of coyotes and the hoot of owls. Lots of birds as well. I am no naturalist, but there is one species of bird that suddenly takes flight from its hiding spot just as I am next to it, often giving me a start. 
Also here at the hostel are late arrivals Capt. Blackbeard and Mainer. They said they are totally exhausted, and are taking a ZERO tomorrow. Also here a s father/daughter team of flipfloppers, Farmer and Butter. Interestingly enough they are from a small town in Western NY, along the west side of Cayuga Lake. We are practically neighbors!

How I ever managed to pound out over 24 miles today is beyond me. I got a late 7:30 start to my hike as I was tied to the shuttle ride to the trailhead (those of you following my journal know that anything after 6 is a late start for me), and I felt sluggish most of the day - probably because of all the food I’ve been eating. I encountered one other thru hiker today, Shoemaker, we had lunch together at the wayside. I also encountered many dayhikers, and one section hiker. As far as the weather is concerned, itvwas a beautiful day. Warm (70) and sunny much of the day. It felt great. 
Alison of Open Arms Hostel shuttled me back to the trailhead this AM, and I was back on the trail at 7:30 hiking. I did not see much of either Mainer or Capt. Blackbeard last nite after they arrived late, they both seemed pretty worn out. They said they were exhausted, and hoped they weren’t coming down with something. The relentless day after day exertion that comes with being on the trail can take its toll. There are also countless illnesses that one can contract while on the trail such as Giardia (from untreated water), Norovirus (from contact with mice), Lyme disease (from ticks) and others.
I got myself another blackberry milkshake for lunch at Elkwallow Wayside. And french fries. And a baloney sandwich that I packed with me. I’ve been a glutinous pig these past several days!
I am now out of the SNP. I really enjoyed my hike thru the park, the trail is well maintained and there are spectacular views from many outlooks. Kayanne, some day you and I will need to take a nice leisurely drive thru the park on Skyline Drive. I won’t make you camp and minimal hiking, HaHa, we’ll stay at motels. 
Here at the shelter tonite are Sour Patch, T5000 and Ghost. It’s always good to see them!  They have a short day planned for tomorrow as they will be picked up at a road junction by Sour Patch’s aunt, then spending a ZERO on Saturday. 
Someone asked me a few weeks ago if hiking the trail was more physical or mental. In my humble opinion, after hiking 900 plus miles so far (but still having a long way to go), I think it is more mental. Certainly there is a physical aspect as well, but if you’re not in good shape when starting out the trail will whip you into shape after a few weeks. The mental challenge however is there every day for the duration. Stuff Happens as they say, and you have to be prepared mentally to deal with the mishaps and adversity  that will come along. You will fall, and have to be prepared to pick yourself up and keep on movin. There will be times when you are cold, wet and feeling miserable, and again need to keep movin on. There will be times when a piece of gear fails or doesn’t perform as expected (eg waterproof boots that aren’t waterproof) and need to keep movin on. There will be times where you will really miss your family and loved ones, as well as the comfort of your home, but need to keep movin on. These and countless other mishaps/concerns/issues will test your mental toughness. Again this is just my opinion.

Some of the smaller bushes have leafed out, particularly at lower elevations and on the southern and western exposures. Buds are swollen on the larger trees, and I suspect that with another couple warm days that they will begin to leaf out. Several different varieties of flowers are also in bloom along the trail. Beautiful!
I drank a ton of water today with this heat. I never came close to running out, but I was filling a bottle(s) at every stream crossing. I am currently carrying 3 water bottles totaling 72 oz (two 20s and one 32), but have decided that at my next resupply in Harpers Ferry that I’m going to replace one of the 20s with a 32. Running out of water is not my idea of a good time. 
I saw Shoemaker on the trail again today. He started at Springer on 02/18, eight days after me, so he is moving faster than I am. He is here at the shelter tonite in his hammock. There are also two section hikers here staying in their tents. So far I am the only one actually sleeping in the shelter. 
Speaking of shelters, on the advice of my friend and former thru hiker Reverend Yukon Jack (aka Sh_traker - but that is another story) I gave a wide berth to the Manassas Gap Shelter.

Beef on Wick and Blackberry Shakes, that’s all the selection they would need. 
The infamous roller coaster was tough, but not as crazy tough as some folks would lead you to believe. Again staying hydrated and not running short on water was the bigger challenge. I did cross over into WV today. Four states down, ten to go. I also went past the 1,000 mile mark, Yippee!
I still say that VA was far and away the toughest state for me so far, primarily because of the harsh winter weather and significant snowdepths that I experienced in the southern half of the state. The northern half of VA, especially thru SNP, was very pleasant and had great trails/views.  Anyway, on to WV!
With the warmer temps the bugs are starting to come out. I’ve applied DEET the last two days and will continue to do so with the warmer weather. My single biggest concern on my thru hike  is with ticks and Lyme Disease. I have to be diligent about checking myself over at nite for ticks. The problem is that the little buggers can be as small as a pinhead. Hard to find. On top of that the literature says to especially check warm and moist areas on your body. Yea, right - like I am a contortionist. And I am not about to ask strangers to check my warm and moist places!
There were a ton of people out on the trail today, the vast majority of which were dayhikers enjoying the nice weather. A few section hikers as well out for a weekend backpack. I bet I crossed paths with at least 200 folks. I also passed a couple of boy scout troops out for a weekend backpack. I love to see that, the Boy Scouts are such a great organization - it’s good to see young people out enjoying the outdoors, a lot better than having them sit in front of a tv/computer/gameboy.

HF was apparently a much fought over area between the North and the South during the Civil War. A lot of history here. I am thinking of Night Train while here, as he is a war history buff and I know he was looking forward to spending some time here. Wish you were here buddy!
The “hostel” I am staying at is the Town’s Inn, a historic building. The hostel bunks at this facility had all been reserved as a block by a group staying here, but the owner put me in a private room for $5 more. I can’t complain about that. 
After checking in, showering and getting my laundry done- and taking a quick nap to catch up on my beauty sleep - I walked the half mile to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy headquarters building and signed in with them. I am NOBO no. 16 this year. 
From the ATC I hitched rides to the Walmart and back, where I did some resupply shopping. No problem getting rides, the first two folks I asked were glad to help and dropped me off door-to-door.  Wow! The maildrop that I sent to myself is at the local USPS office which is closed today (Sunday), so I had to wing it a bit. I am doing a better job gauging how much food to carry, as I arrived in HF with very little extra food in my bag. I will pick up my maildrop tomorrow at 8, reorganize and then get back on the trail. 
I enjoyed a rather low key day here in HF, got to make some calls/facetime with family, catch up on texts/emails, etc. After having temps in the 80s the past two days it has turned markedly colder here today with rain/thundershowers/winds approaching. Brrrr, I’m glad to be inside today. One day off the trail, and already I’m turning soft. HaHa. 
Again a big thank you to all those following along on my trailjournals posts, and continued thanks to those of you that have offered your kind comments, helpful suggestions and words of encouragement - they are all much appreciated. I am also so thankful to be able to make this hike. The good Lord has blessed me in so many ways, I’m a lucky man. 
I am safe, warm and dry in the hostel tonite - and eagerly looking forward to being back on the trail tomorrow. Goodnite.","David Lesser Memorial Shelter

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/586970,"I forgot to mention in yesterday’s entry how nice I was treated at the ATC Headquarters. There were two older gentlemen there, both former thru hikers, working as volunteers. They took my picture for placement in a notebook of all the thru hikers, and also spoke with me for awhile. They made me feel very welcome. The ATC also has on display a very large 3-D relief map of the entire trail. Very nice. 
I was glad to be out of the Town’s Inn. In spite of its advertisement as being a hostel, it is just not setup that way. For starters the entire bunkhouse, which is in the basement, was rented out to a family that was vacationing. They were not hikers. Doesn’t sound like a hostel to me. I was given a private room at a good rate, but there were no kitchen facilities, no common room, no tv. When there I was basically confined to my very small room. The owner is a bit persnickety as well. I had an issue with my maildrop and shuttle service to the post office this AM, that did not go well. The owner offered me a half-hearted apology for her rudeness, but getting my maildrop was a hassle. Anyway I got out of there shortly after 9, and was glad to be back on the trail. 
I am now finished with WV (5 states down, 9 to go) and am now in Maryland- which only has about 41 miles of the AT in it. So far the trail in MD seems well maintained to me, and the grades have not been steep. Easy hiking. It rained all morning, so the trail was often a stream. Not much you can do about that. This afternoon the rain stopped, and in a few hours the trail for the most part was fairly dry with only a few stretches of standing water. The drainage is good, many appropriately placed drainage bars, which is a testament to the fine work of the trail builders and maintenance staff. I also encountered a ridge runner today, the first one that I am aware of on my entire hike so far. A young man out checking on things, a member of the Potomac ATC. 
I stopped for lunch at the Ed Garvey shelter. What a nice shelter that is - a two story structure, and the second level has its own outside stairway, balcony and door. Very clean also. Tonite I’m camping at the Dahlgren Backpack Campground, a no fee state facility for use by backpackers only, complete with a restroom with running water and electricity. I have my very own level tent pad, with its own picnic table. There is also a bear pole here, and a trash can for garbage. It’s a real nice setup. 
Today I was also most pleasantly greeted by trail angel Vicki at Gathland State Park. She was there in her car, invited me and section hiker Fox to sit in her heated car, and enjoy some goodies and drinks that she had brought. She lives not far from Harpers Ferry, and is a hiker herself. On a cold, rainy and generally miserable day, this token of kindness was most appreciated. Thank you trail angel Vicki!
Besides section hiker Fox I also encountered today 3 flip-flop thru hikers:  Pim and Toby (their second day on the trail), and a young man whose name escapes me (his first day on the trail). All the best to you gentlemen as you embark on this great adventure - hope you have as much fun out here on the trail as I’ve had so far (but hopefully you’ll have less snow/cold, HaHa).

I tried drying out some wet socks again by hanging them off my pack again. Checked them about mid/morning and they were frozen. Freeze dried socks anyone?
I was on the trail at 6:15, and arrived here at the shelter about 4:15. The next shelter would have had me arriving right at nightfall, which I didn’t want to do. Maryland does not allow stealth camping, so I decided to call it an early day and stay tight here at Rock Raven. It is a brand new shelter, really nice. There are 8 of us here at the shelter. 
I came across quite a few more backpackers on the trail today, mostly section hikers, a couple of NOBOd like me, and several flipfloppers. Lots of flipfloppers start in the Harpers Ferry area about this time of year, some heading south and others north. Today I also met Flash and Footprint, they are NOBOs having started at Springer on 02/26 - which means they are really moving. Footprint is from the Czech Republic. I also met flipflopers Meg (from Canada) and Matt (from Australia), they have only been on the trail a couple days now. Also section hikers Achin, Trudger (from Rochester area) and Rock Dawg. Bangles and Johnny Walker are also here at the shelter. 
I stopped at Ensign Cowall Shelter, and was offered a slice of pizza by the threesome of Flash, Footprint and John Goodman. That pizza really hit the spot. 
A couple of difficult stream crossings towards the end of the day, requiring significant detours to get across.  The streams are high from all the rain yesterday. If it was warmer I would have considered wading across, but not today.

I crossed the Mason Dixon line early today, am now in Pennsylvania. That’s 6 states down, 8 to go. PA has a bit of a bad reputation amongst thru hikers because of the rattlesnakes and all the rocks on the trail - predominantly in the eastern part of the state. The state is sometimes not so affectionately referred to by hikers as Rocksylvania. I will defer judgement until I see for myself how the trail is. As far as today was concerned, the trail was great and I was able to pound out the miles. Admittedly I am only about 20 miles into the state, we’ll see how she goes. 
Like yesterday I again crossed paths with a number of hikers, either section hikers or flip floppers just starting out. I went by a group of four ladies, they are sisters, one of whom (Rainbow) is a flipflopper that started last week. The other sisters are along for a week to offer moral support. I also ran into Blue Stem who is completing his final 400 mile section, he has about a week to go. Congratulations Blue Stem. I also met Traveller, a flipflopper just starting out. He completed a thru hike in 2015 and is back for round 2. Traveller is from Stuttgart, Germany and we spoke briefly in German. I hadn’t uttered but two sentences and he immediately knew that I was from Bavaria. We had a few laughs over my Bavarian dialect and apparent mispronunciations, HaHa. 
Tonight I am at a tentsite along the trail. Also camping here is a young man from Philadelphia, Matt, just out for an overnighter before starting a new job on Monday. We spoke for awhile around a campfire, a nice guy. 
Looking ahead I hope to be in Duncannon at the Doyle by Saturday, for a rendezvous with three of my Rochester hiking buddies who were doing an AT section hike in Virginia this week.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587256,"It rained during the nite, but stopped before I broke camp. Laying in the tent at nite, listening to the sound of the rain hitting the tent, is in some ways I find to be very soothing. It rained most of the morning, and sections of the trail were a mess. There were very few drainage bars, so the trail was a stream/pond. Impossible to keep my feet dry, but hey, once they are soaking wet who cars- I can just wade through the water, the feet aren’t going to get any wetter. In the afternoon it started to clear, but it was cold - occasionally sleet would make an appearance. Fortunately the trail was pretty easy (not a lot of rocks/roots, and modest climbs) so I was able to pound out more miles than at first I thought I would. My mileage the past couple days has not aligned with the shelter spacing, so I’ve been camping at tentsites. Frankly when it’s cold I’d rather be in my tent anyways: I’m completely shielded from the wind, and the tent is warmer than a shelter. 
I saw very few hikers on the trail. The only thru hiker I encountered was southbound flipflopper Mini HaHa, who started her hike at Delaware Water Gap. 
I was disappointed to find that the Pine Grove Campground General Store, home of the half gallon challenge, was not yet open for the season. Let me tell you, I was ready. As my family will attest, you are looking at a man who loves his ice cream. I buy my ice cream in Super Scooper pails. I’ve been know to top a large bowl of ice cream with a couple of ice cream sandwiches as rabbit years. I’ve also gotten a large custard cone at Abbott’s, then gotten right back in line and ordered a second one. Ha, a half gallon would have been child’s play. In all honesty it’s probably a good thing they were closed, as I’d have polished off that half gallon and probably come down with a bout of scheisserei because my system wouldn’t have been used to the sudden infusion of ice cream. Don’t need any scheisserei on the trail. 
Remember I wrote in my entry of a week or so ago, when we had those two warm days in Virginia just before Harpers Ferry, that it looked like spring was here? Well it seems like I’ve outrun spring, because let me tell you there is nothing ready to leaf out here in PA. We need some warmer days Mother Nature!
I did pass the official halfway point today in terms of mileage. Slowly but surely I’m making my way north!
I am looking forward to seeing some of my family soon as I make my way across PA and on into NJ and NY. First my sister Heidi and her family, then a few days later our some Eric and his family, and then a few days after that our daughter Amy and her family.

I was on the trail at 5, and was in Boiling Springs shortly after 9. Spent some tome at the ATC Mid-Atlantic Regional Office, where I ran into Flash, Footprint and John Goodman. Around 10 my friends Eric, Max and Dan arrived. They had been doing some AT section hiking south of here for the past week and were on their way back to Rochester, so a rendezvous was convenient for all parties. Eric walked all of us over to the boiling spring after which the town was named (he has a mind like a steel trap), then we went out for breakfast. I ate heartily to no-one’s surprise (juice, eggs, pancakes, home fries, bacon, toast and a bagel with cream cheese). The four of us had a nice visit and enjoyed some laughs, we said our goodbyes, and I was back on the trail at 11:30.

Doyle opens at 11, no problem - I did my laundry at the local laundromat in the meantime. Everything went in the machine except a clean pair of underpants that I had, and my rain jacket. Glad they didn’t raid the place, HaHa. After laundry went back to the Doyle, picked up my maildrop, and figured out what I still needed for resupply. Not much. Picked up a few odds and ends at a nearby convenience mart. Back to the Doyle, and had lunch. The owners were so friendly/helpful. Lunch was a huge fish fry, it was delicious. 
Back on the trail hiking at 1. Long road walk out of Duncannon, including bridges over Junita and Susquehanna Rivers. 
Beautiful day today for hiking. Many dayhikers on the trail enjoying the weather. Here at the shelter tonite are two flipfloppers from South Africa, Metric and MooT. Nice folks, they’ve been on trail about 2 weeks having started from Harpers Ferry. Also here are about 6 members from a local hiking club out for an overnite backpack. They are all in tents. 
My sister Heidi and her husband Gary, who live in north Jersey, are headed to Rochester this weekend. They drive thru the Delaware Water Gap. I am hoping that I can be near there by then and hitch a round trip ride with them. We’ll see how it goes for me, I have many miles to cover and still need to deal with the PA rocks which will slow me down. It would sure be good to be home for the weekend and see Kayanne/family.

It was all I could do to drag my sorry butt up the last climb of the day and setup camp. I’m whupped tonite. Think I’ll sleep in tomorrow morning!
Weather wise it was a beautiful day today, couldn’t have asked for better. And so far the trails in PA have not been difficult. I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop! I encountered 3 northbound flipfloppers on the trail today:  Dory, Reverse and Rev. They started a couple weeks ago. Other than that I did not see any other thru hikers. There were several groups doing a weekend backpack, and quite a few folks doing a dayhike/walk on a nice Sunday afternoon. There were also a couple of horseback riders on the trail today, which is a no-no on the AT. I said something to them, but they kept right on going. 
I would like to give a shout out to Gossamer Gear. The  hipbelt on my backpack has started to fray; it’s not serious yet, but with time/wear could become an issue.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587787,"After being so exhausted yesterday, I slept in till 4:45;  on the trail at 5:30. The issue with sleeping in is that I go to bed so early (hiker midnite is somewhere between 8 & 9), that I’m awake early. Might as well be hiking as opposed to laying in the sleeping bag. It takes me typically about 45 minutes in the morning to break camp and be on the trail. I can basically pack everything up within the tent/vestibules, excepting of course the tent itself and my bear bag, which is especially convenient - especially if it’s raining. One advantage of being on the trail so early is that I get to see a lot of sunrises. The days are noticeably longer; today I was able to turn off my headlight right at 6!
It was another great hiking day weather wise. Mother Nature, another 60 or so days like today would be awesome, thank you very much! The trail was also easy hiking today;  of course there were some rocky sections, but no more than I’ve experienced in other states so far. I’m told the real rocky sections begin around Port Clinton, we’ll see. One thing that I did encounter today were sections where there were two parallel trails. Neither of these parallel trails were marked very well with blazes, so I couldn’t really tell if I was on the AT or not. The trails would repeatedly diverge and merge again.  Strange, first time I experienced this. 
I hiked for awhile with section hiker Levi, he is from NYC. I also encountered section hikers Moonshine and Tortuga, and crossed paths with flipfloppers Reverse and Rev. Yesterday they were headed northbound, today southbound. There were also a couple of dayhikers out on the trail, but otherwise the trail was quiet today. 
The plantar fasciitis in my right heel is starting to act up a bit. Not that bad right now, but I hope it doesn’t get much worse - the tendon is swollen and tender. It is fortuitous that I’ll be in Rochester this weekend, I’ll be stopping at The Good Feet Store for a new pair of orthotics. Two things typically happen with orthotics over time:  i) your foot size/dimesions will change;  and ii) the orthotics themselves will deform. I suspect that after 1,200 miles of pounding on the trail that a little of both has occurred. Time for a new pair. 
I am staying tonite at the Rock n Sole Hostel, time to recharge my energy a bit and take a shower. It has been 9 days since I last showered, and although I didn’t really stink that bad (HaHa) I thought a shower might be a good idea anyway. They have a nice setup here, and the folks that run the place are extremely friendly and accommodating. The $40 price also includes two homecooked meals (dinner and breakfast), and a resupply shuttle to Dollar General, what a great deal. I’ll be back on the trail tomorrow AM after breakfast.

Later than my normal early AM start, but that’s Ok, I was able to make it up on the tail end as it doesn’t get dark till 8. 
The trail was a typical walk in the woods, very few outlooks and rather uneventful. I only encountered two people on the trail the entire day, both flipfloppers:  Rev and Mariposa. I did see a wild turkey today, it scampered across the trail about 70 yards in front of me. All I could think of after seeing the turkey was Thanksgiving dinner at my in-laws the Maleskis - I could sure go for a plate full of turkey and fixins right about now, HaHa. 
The inflammation in my right heel continues to worsen, with every step being painful. Hopefully when I get my new orthotics on Saturday that will solve the problem. In the meantime I will just have to fight thru it.

Generally just a miserable day weather wise, oh well - it is to be expected after the two nice days we had. I must admit that when i woke up this morning at 4 and heard the rain coming down pretty hard on the shelter roof, I rolled back over and slept for another hour or so. Didn’t get on the trail till 6:15. Not a big crisis!
I encountered lots of the PA rocks today, big ones and little ones, round ones and pointy ones. Going thru these rocky sections of trail really slows the pace down, as you have to watch very carefully each and every foot placement or you run the risk of an ankle sprain/break or a face plant. As it was, and in spite of being very careful, I did take a very nasty fall today on a section with the big rocks. It happened around mid day, and some of the rocks were extremely slippery. Down I went, landing hard on my left forearm and hip. Knocked the wind right out of me, I just lay there for a few minutes to pull myself together. Nothing is broken, but my left hip is really sore. I believe a couple of Tylenol PMs are in order for tonite. You know, a couple of zero days in Rochester is just what this old boy needs. 
I encountered a few flipfloppers and section hikers today including GD, Broken Arrow and Disco. Disco is here at the campsite with me. 
I also passed a rather strange group of five young men hiking today. The individual in front was dressed in a brown frock, almost like a monk’s robe, and he was carrying a wooden staff. Ditto for the person in the back. The other three guys in between were all dressed in normal hiking attire. We exchanged hellos in passing, but they did not stop to engage in any conversation.

I really enjoyed today’s climb out of the Lehigh Gap. There was some exposure and a few spots requiring a scramble - enough to get the adrenaline flowing a bit. I enjoyed that, reminded me a little of some of the climbs in the Adirondacks and the Whites. Overall today the trail was a mixed bag:  some sections were a turkey walk, and others were a rock hop.

In any event I had an appointment this morning with my primary care physician, and he set me up to have a catheter installed at Strong.  I basically have an enlarged prostate, a condition that is not uncommon for men my age.  I will also be scheduled to see an urologist, who will further evaluate my condition and advise as to treatment options.  My doctor also re-examined my hernia, which I've had since last fall, and he advised that my hernia now needs to be surgically repaired once my prostate issue is resolved and before I have any notion of continuing on with my AT hike.  I tell ya, it's tough getting old!
It was a huge relief to have the catheter installed, you just can't imagine how good it felt to drain my bladder and no longer have to deal with the pain that went with going to the bathroom.  Ahhhhhhhhhhhh....!
These health issues are nothing serious that can't be dealt with, but it looks like the continuance of my AT thru hike attempt is going to be put on hold for awhile.  Another option for me is to complete the AT as a section hiker - if not this year, then perhaps next year.  Certainly I'm disappointed with this recent chain of events, but I remain enthusiastic and optimistic about completing the AT one way or another.  In one respect I consider myself very fortunate that the issue with my prostate manifested itself while I happened to be in Rochester for the weekend.  I can't imagine having to deal with the very painful urination issue while out on the trail.

I resumed my hike where I got off, PA 33 in Wind Gap, PA. 
These past two plus weeks I’ve been dealing with a host of medical issues, including:  an enlarged prostate that resulted in extreme pain when urinating; a hernia; a bladder infection; high fevers, headaches and an earache! I’ve been to see an urologist several times, and a surgeon with reference to my hernia. Also my general practitioner. I’ve had a catheter in me for 8 days, been in/out of hospital emergency rooms 3 times, and was most recently admitted to the hospital for a couple days when I spiked a fever as a result of the infection and my vitals were in sad shape (very low blood pressure and an elevated pulse). I was discharged from the hospital on Friday 05/11 and am still on an antibiotic for the infection. I am also scheduled for hernia surgery on 06/22.  It hasn’t been fun dealing with all of these medical issues - I’ve been a fairly healthy individual for all of my life, so being sick like I’ve been was all new to me. Ugh! 
I am happy to report that everything now seems to be under control (although I am something of a walking pharmacy), and the doctors have cleared me to resume my hike on the condition that if any of a number of symptoms make an appearance that I get off the trail promptly and seek medical help. I can work with that. Anyway here I am, back on the trail! In many respects I am so very thankful that these medical issues came to a head while I just so happened to be home in Rochester for a weekend, especially with respect to my issues with urinating. The pain was unbearable, I’m sure glad that I was off the trail at the time. The Good Lord was definitely watching out for me. And my wonderful wife Kayanne has been an angel, taking time off from work when needed, shuttling me around to doctors/hospitals, providing moral support, and providing excellent in-home care. Thank you Kayanne, you’re the best! My family and friends have also been a blessing, showing their concern and offering their support during these past couple weeks. I am very lucky.
While in Rochester I was also fitted with a new pair of orthotics, which hopefully will keep my plantar fasciitis in check. I also am doing the Bill Crowe toe crunches, and also have with me some special arch support socks that I will wear at nite in my sleeping bag. 
As I stated in an earlier entry, it’s tough getting old, HaHa. 
Those of you that have been following my trail journal entries from the beginning, including my early on preparatory posts, know that I have family obligations for the summer and will need to be off-trail from mid June (06/16 to be exact) until beginning of September.  I remain committed to completing an AT thru hike this year (God willing of course), and have a preliminary plan:  I will hike as many miles as I am able in these next 4.5 weeks, and see where that puts me. I hope to be somewhere near the VT/NH border by then, we’ll see how it goes. I expect that my daily mileage for the first week or so to be fairly low, as I’ve been generally sedentary these past 2.5 weeks. It’s going to take me a week or two to get my trail legs back under me. In any event once I re-resume my hike in September, and depending on how far north I’ve gotten by 06/16, I may elect to start at Katahdin and then hike south to my 06/16 jump-off point. That’s my preliminary plan anyway, we’ll see how she goes. As I know all too well, the best laid plans............!
As far as today’s hike is concerned, it’s been absolutely uplifting to my spirit to be back on the trail. I missed the trail terribly, it’s good to be reunited with you - AT, you are like an old friend! One thing for sure, in view of my recent setback I most certainly appreciate more not only what it takes to be an AT thru hiker, but also the trail itself. Every day on the trail from here on forward will be a day to be savored and a day to be thankful for. Thank you Good Lord for giving me this cherished opportunity to be on the Appalachian Trail!
It was 12:30 by the time I actually got on the trail, what with the drive and all - so I’m not displeased with my effort for today. My body aches a little, I’ll probably feel it more in the morning - but that is to be expected. The downhills were hard on my knees, but they will be fine once they have a few more miles under them. Fortunately the ups/downs were very modest today, a good hike for first day back. The PA rocks were still here - I was secretly hoping that they might miraculously disappear somehow, HaHa. 
It did rain  all day today which was a bummer, I got completely soaked head to foot, inside to outside. Oh well, I figureI am building up some future credits for good weather. I am spending the nite in the basement of a church here in Delaware Water Gap, the Church of the Mountain Hiker Center. I rolled in about 8.  Nothing fancy, but there’s a bunk where I can roll out my sleeping bag/pad, a bathroom, shower, sitting area and heat. Donation based. There’s only one other hiker here, a section hiker OspreyG, so there’s plenty of room to hang up clothes and stuff to dry out. I like the place, glad to be here in view of the rain. Also No Point arrived just now, a thru hiker.
I would like to thank all of you that have offered me your best wishes and prayers for a speedy recovery during these past couple weeks - it meant an awful lot to me, I am very humbled by all of the support you’ve shown me! I truly thank you!
I am safe, warm and dry in the Hiker Center - very glad to be back on the trail. Goodnite.","Wind Gap PA

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590815,"When I started my hike back on 02/10 at Amicalola Falls SP, I was in decent shape and could pound out big miles on day one and be ready to repeat the same the next day without any soreness. Well let me tell you, after being sedentary for 2.5 weeks I am like a marshmallow.  I expected that I’d be sore this AM after yesterday, and I was. Today was a struggle for me physically, and it was a very modest mileage and climbing elevation day. I expect that I’ll be sore for the next several days, until I get some semblance of trail legs back under me. It is what it is. Reminds me of what our high school track coach, Fr. McCarthy, used to tell us: “.....first we knock you down, then we build you up....”. The trail is definitely knocking me down right now. 
As far as my health is concerned, I feel great - all bodily systems are functioning as the Good Lord intended (thanks to the drugs I’m taking). I am very appreciative of my doctors that got me to this point, and gave me the green light to resume my hike:  Drs. Ryu, Chang & Garneau; and a special thanks to NP Maureen Kiernan at UR/Strong Urology for all her help. Health wise, I feel great!
Today’s hike started with an early morning light rain, which only lasted a couple hours. By this afternoon the sun actually came out. Today’s hike took me along Kittatinny Ridge, where there were some nice views to be had. The trail also skirted around Sunfish Pond, this looked like a great spot, very scenic. The trail itself here in New Jersey has been well graded, and the walking for the most part has been much easier than in PA. I hope today’s trail conditions are indicative of conditions for the balance of New Jersey.
I was so physically tired this afternoon that I was going to spend the nite at the Mohican Outdoor Center about 3 miles back. I rolled in there at about 14:30, only to find out that they had no electricity, no water, and no food. Hmmm, for $30 a nite for a bunk it didn’t sound like much of a deal, so I dug deep and hoofed it the additional 3 miles to the tentsite where I’m at. It’s a great spot, water is nearby and I’ve got this site all to myself so far. I’m glad I went the extra 3 miles. A couple of milestones today: i) I crossed from PA into NJ, which means 7 states down and 7 to go; and ii) I passed the 1,300 mile mark. Slowly but surely I’m getting there. 
I encountered one other thru hiker on the trail today, Kickback. I also ran into Turtle, a section hiker, whom I met way back in Franklin, NC at Gooder’s hostel. A nice guy, he is employed full time by the Boy Scouts. We chatted for awhile, he was headed south. I also came across three large groups of dayhikers out on the trail today. 
One big difference that I have noticed since I was last on the trail, besides the spring foliage of course,  is that the bugs are out. Which reminds me, I better check for ticks before I turn in.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/590932,"I did OK today. Still moving pretty slow, but the miles came a little easier today as compared to yesterday. In addition to banging out a few more miles, there was also a bit more climbing elevation. Nothing major mind you, but enough to get my legs working and my heart pumping. 47 miles over the past three days, I’m well satisfied with that all things considered. It certainly helped having the great trail conditions and relatively gentle grades that I’ve encountered in New Jersey so far - just what the doctor ordered. 
It was a beautiful day today, comfortable temps and mostly clear skies. I encountered one other thru hiker today, Doc Holiday, a flipflopper who was headed south. I also ran into NOBO Kickback, whom I met yesterday. Here with me at the shelter tonite are two section hikers, Miss Piggy and Kermit, who this year are on their last section to complete the AT. Congratulations!
I forgot to mention in my entries of the past couple days that there is a lot of fresh blowdown both on and alongside the trail, apparently the result of some severe thunderstorms that swept thru the area earlier in the week. I’m certain that it’s going to take trail crews awhile to clean up this mess. There have also been widespread power outages as a result. Power outages don’t really affect us hikers directly, but I do feel for those folks/businesses without power. 
T5000, I don’t know if you are still doing your “Bedtime Stories with Opa” readings, but if you are reading this entry I want you to know how proud I am of the Four Young Guns:  you, Capt. Blackbeard, Sour Patch and Mainer are all doing great. It’s my understanding you’re all up in Vermont, having banged out Connecticut’s 51 miles in less than 24 hrs. Wow, you guys rock - I’m with you in spirit and wish you all the best. Keep it up, and you’ll all be standing on Katahdin in no time!!! 
Tomorrow I’m targeting a 20 mile day, we’ll see how she goes. There is rain in the forecast which will slow me down, as I am very tentative on the wet rocks these days. I’ve had a few nasty slips/falls, and have lost confidence in the gripping power of my Merrill boots on wet rock. I’ve got a new pair of boots waiting for me at my son Eric’s place, whom I’ll be seeing next weekend.

I felt really good today physically and was able to pound out a few miles this AM pretty quickly to High Point State Park, but man I was pretty wet - and chilled - when I got there. Rain gear only works so long in a heavy continuous rain like we had today, water eventually finds a way in. There I go, sounding like a cry baby!

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591345,"Well, it looks like I'll be off the trail again for awhile as another injury surfaced. I am bummed!!!!  I have developed a bulbous inflammation in the area of the arch on my right foot. This came from out of the blue, as normally my plantar fasciitis manifests itself with an inflammation of the tendons in the heels of my feet. Although I felt a mild discomfort in my arch yesterday when I went for a walk at my sister’s, it didn't seem like a big deal. However today when I was about two miles into my hike, carrying my normal full pack, the pain became much worse. Every step I took with my right foot was very painful. No fun.  I was carrying some strong prescription pain killers with me and tried taking those, but they had no impact - the pain in my foot persisted.  I don't know if there's a problem with my new orthotics or what, but rather than risk a permanent debilitating injury I'm going to get off the trail again and have my feet checked out by my podiatrist. This is a most unexpected setback, but it is what it is. It seems like I'm snakebit lately, with one injury/illness after  another.  
Other than the problem with my foot, everything else was working great for me - both from a health and a fitness standpoint. I felt like my trail legs were back, and I was ready to pound out some serious miles. To say I’m disappointed is an understatement, but I just can’t hike with my foot the way it is. I was fortunate in that my son Eric and family live in nearby Westwood, NJ, so I called him and he came and picked me up in Vernon. 
I want to thank all of you that have been following along on trailjournals, and appreciate all of your supportive comments and words of encouragement. I haven’t given up hope yet for a successful thru hike, there’s still time. Regardless of what happens next, I’ve had a marvelous adventure so far on the AT. I’ve met some great people, have seen a part of this beautiful country of ours that I haven’t seen before, and have memories to last a lifetime!  I am most grateful for the opportunity I’ve had so far to hike the AT.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/591782,"As you may know from my prior trailjournal entry I got knocked off the trail recently, due to some pretty bad pain in my right foot. I am currently in Brooklyn visiting with my daughter. She has a friend that's an orthopedic surgeon here in Brooklyn who was kind enough to see me. They took X-rays of my foot, did an examination, etc. I have a non-displaced stress fracture in the fifth metatarsal. Ultimately I expect to be fitted with a boot when I see my own podiatrist back in Rochester next week to help support the foot during the healing process, which will take several weeks. During this time I can walk, but no hiking, jogging, etc. Well, at least I know what it is - it could be worse. Other than the issue with my foot I feel pretty darn good.Between my foot, my scheduled hernia surgery later in June, and my commitments for the summer, I expect that the earliest I’ll be back on the trail is early September.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/593216,"Hi!  I’m of course still off trail and am at my home in Rochester, NY, but thought I’d give an update on my condition/plans. 
I had my hernia surgery yesterday. Post-op the surgeon described the hernia as being “very large”, but he said that the surgery went well, no issues. I am now the proud owner of an incision that’s been stapled up and a new surgical mesh that’s been inplanted somewhere “in there” that will hold things in place. Gotta love modern medicine, thank you Dr. Chang. I’d hate to think about what my options would have been if I was around a couple hundred years ago. Anyway all is good from the surgery and I am resting comfortably at home. Dr’s orders are that I can walk in moderation, but no driving for 3-5 days, and no pushing/pulling or lifting anything heavier than 10 lbs. for 2 weeks. Also no strenuous exercising like hiking, jogging, biking, etc. for 4 weeks. Guess I’ll just live off the fat of the land for awhile, HaHa. 
As far as my right foot is concerned I went to see my podiatrist last week who took his own x-rays (as expected), and he basically concurred with the diagnosis I previously received from the orthopedic surgeon in Brooklyn (Amy and Danny’s friend who was kind enough to see me)- namely that I have a stress fracture in the fifth metatarsal. My podiatrist fitted me with a boot that I am supposed to wear “all the time”, the idea being that it will help with the healing process which is expected to take 3 weeks until the pain goes away completely and 6 weeks for a full recovery. I was told that if I overdo it in terms of activity, am a bad patient and don’t wear my boot when I am supposed to, that the recovery could take 3 months or more. Guess I better try and be a good patient. 
My podiatrist also took a mold of my feet, as I am having custom orthotics made to deal with my plantar fasciitis. Ka-ching goes the cash register, as the custom orthotics are not covered by insurance - which I find mildly irritating. Insurance would be on the hook to pay for very expensive surgery to cut out the bone spurs in both feet if I elected to go that route, but they won’t pay for orthotics which are much less expensive than surgery. Go figure!
As far as my enlarged prostate is concerned, that seems to be under control - again thanks to the miracle of modern medicine and drugs. I am able to urinate normally and without any pain. Thank God, I wouldn’t wish that ordeal on anyone let alone an AT hiker!
In spite of all these recent and unexpected health issues my spirits remain high and I am cautiously optimistic about my chances of completing an AT thru hike this year, God willing and the creeks don’t rise!  I have 833 miles left, from Vernon, NJ (mile 1358) to Mt. Katahdin (mile 2191). Since I have commitments for the summer I won’t be getting back on the trail till end-August/beg-September, which also gives me plenty of time to recover health-wise and work my way back into some semblance of decent shape before hitting the trail.  However this timetable means I likely won’t have enough time to pound out the 833 miles northbound prior to the typical mid-October closing of Katahdin. My thinking is that instead I’ll become a flipflopper, and resume my hike at Katahdin and head south to Vernon. That is the preliminary plan anyway, we’ll see how she goes.
I have a couple of other options that I am mulling over, but they are less likely. One way or another, and assuming my health holds up, I’d like to give it the old college try as they say and become an AT thru hiker this year. Hey, if it’s not meant to be it’s not meant to be:  I’m not going to jeopardize my long term health and do something stupid for the sake of completing an AT thru hike. However, I’m not going down without a fight. I guess that’s the hard-headed German in me, HaHa. 
Sorry for this somewhat lengthy update - hope I didn’t bore too many if you. Once again I’d like to sincerely thank all of you that have been following along on trailjournals, and  have been so supportive of me in my quest. I can’t begin to express how much your well wishes and encouragement have meant to me, thank you from the bottom of my heart!  Opa","

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601102,"Thought I’d give an update to those of you that had been following along on Trail Journals, and were wondering “Opa, what is going on with you????”  I am happy to report that the conditions with my health that forced me to get off the trail appear to have been addressed, and I plan on resuming my hike 08/30.  I fly up to Bangor, ME on 08/29, one week from today, will spend the nite at the AT Lodge in Millinocket, and start hiking again on 08/30.
I’ve been thinking about the trail every single day since I had to get off way back on May 21st, so I am raring to go! Instead of being a NOBO I will become a flipflopper as I resume my hike by starting at Katahdin and hiking south. My preference would have been to continue as a NOBO, but I was concerned that with my end of August restart I would simply run out of time and not make it to Katahdin by the time they close the mountain in mid-October. Even if I did make it to Katahdin by mid-October I’d be faced with having to deal with that ridiculous thru-hiker quota system that Baxter State Park has implemented. Admittedly if I am successful in completing my thru hike this year, finishing at Vernon, NJ will be somewhat anticlimactic (no offense to New Jersey) - but the main goal here is to actually COMPLETE a thru hike, irrespective of where I finish. 
As far as my health is concerned, I feel pretty darn good. My hernia surgery went well and the incision has healed nicely. The prescription medication I’m taking (Flowmax) to address the issue I was having with my enlarged prostate and urination difficulties seems to be the ticket:  ever since my Urologist put me on this drug I have been able to pee normally again, without any pain/discomfort. Thank God for modern medicine!  I also had new orthotics made this summer that will hopefully minimize the recurrence of any serious inflammation in my heels due to my plantar fasciitis (I will of course continue with my nightly ritual of toe crunches while on the trail). As far as the stress fracture in my right foot is concerned, on occasion I experience some mild discomfort but nothing major. My podiatrist indicated the pain/discomfort was not unexpected, and I may continue to experience some discomfort for up to a year. Bottom line is he gave me the green light to resume my hike, so I can live with the little bit of pain I’m experiencing. Man I tell ya, I’ve got more ailments than I can keep track of....it’s tough getting old. However my spirits are high, and barring any unforeseen developments I plan on giving it everything I’ve got to finish my thru hike. 
As far as my conditioning is concerned the stress fracture has limited my workouts this summer to primarily riding my bike so I’m not nearly in as good a shape as I was when I started my hike back on February 10th - but that’s OK. I expect I’ll have to take it easy for the first week or two on the trail until I get my trail legs back. 
Overall Kayanne and I have had a very busy and fun summer. We were fortunate to have many family and friends visit and spend time with us at our cottage on Conesus Lake, we really had a grand time! There is nothing better than getting together with family and friends! The big news for the summer was the birth of our sixth grandchild, Owen Ludwig Gsellmeier, on July 18th!  Kayanne and I are now truly blessed with six wonderful grandkids, two boys (the bookends) and four girls:  Link, Lucy, Elena, Evelyn, Charlotte and Owen. The Lord has been good to us in so many ways!
I plan on continuing to post daily entries in my trail journal, although I’m hearing that cell phone coverage in Maine is spotty at best - in which case I will post my entries a day or two after the fact whenever I am back in coverage. I’m so glad that I took the time to post journal entries for the first leg of my hike, as it really was a nice way to document my hike. I’ve also enjoyed very much reading the entries of other hikers that have similarly documented their own hikes, and have been living vicariously through them. I’m anxious to join you all again on the trail very soon!
At this time I’d like to give a heartfelt Thank You to family, friends, and trail journal followers, who have offered me your well wishes and been supportive of me during my recovery - I can’t begin to put into words how much this has meant to me. I am inspired!","

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601743,"After a rather lengthy hiatus from the trail I’m finally off on the second leg of my journey. I’ve been driving my very patient and understanding wife crazy with my incessant jabbering about the trail and my need to finish what I started. Thank you Kayanne for lending a receptive ear and offering your support, you’re the best!
If all goes according to plan (famous last words) this leg of my hike will take me from Mt. Katahdin, ME to Vernon, NJ. Having completed the leg from Springer Mt., GA to Vernon earlier this year, if I am able to complete this second leg this year I will indeed qualify as an AT thru hiker. But Opa, let’s not get ahead of ourselves - there are many footsteps that remain to be taken, and as I know firsthand there is much that can go wrong! I’ve got a lot of hiking ahead that will take me over some of the more difficult terrain that the trail has to offer, most notably in Maine and New Hampshire. Over the years I’ve section/day hiked a fair number of miles of the AT in these two states, so I know well some of the challenges that await. 
My trip today started with a flight from Rochester, NY to Bangor, ME, via. a connection in Philadelphia.  The flights were smooth, but as expected I was not able to carry-on my pack as my collapsible hiking poles are considered weapons. Oh well.  My pack arrived safely at the airport in Bangor, that’s what counts. On the flight from Philly to Bangor I was seated in a row immediately in front of two ladies that talked nonstop - and very loudly- for the entire flight. They never stopped to take a breath, so annoying. When disembarking the man in the seat across the aisle from me just looked at me, and we both just shook our heads. We should have asked the airline for a discount for enduring “cruel and unusual punishment”.
I arrived in Bangor at 14:00, and had 4.5 hrs. to kill until my Cyr bus left for Medway. Across the street from the airport there was a grocery store, where I did some final resupply shopping and then had a bite to eat at the local Wendy’s. Eventually I made my way to the bus station, which was just a short walk away, and caught the 18:30 bus to Medway. At Medway I was picked up by a shuttle that took me to the AT Lodge in Millinocket, arriving at 20:00. The shuttle was included in a $70 package provided by the AT Lodge that also included a one nite stay, breakfast in the AM, and then an AM shuttle to Katahdin Stream Campground in Baxter State Park where I will begin my hike. Not a bad deal at all. I stayed at the AT Lodge back in 2010 along with Art, one of my hiking buddies, on a trip where we climbed Baxter (Katahdin), Hamlin and North Brother. We both finished our Northeast 115 on that trip, so it was very memorable. The Lodge was pretty much as I remember it. 
I must admit to you that although I am extremely excited and anxious to get back on the trail, I do so with some trepidation. Will I have any health issues?  How will my body hold up - particularly my feet?  Will the plantar fasciitis rear its ugly head? Is the stress fracture in my foot healed enough, such that it will withstand the daily pounding that the trail will dish out?  I keep telling myself that I can’t dwell on these “What If’s”, that I’ve been a good patient and followed my doctors’ instructions during my recovery - now all I can do is put one foot in front of the other. What will be will be. I am just so thankful to have this opportunity to resume my hike!
I expect to encounter a fair number of NOBOs that I should cross paths with on the trail as I will be heading south, and look forward to hearing about their trail adventures/misadventures. I will be most happy for them as they near the end of their epic hike - way to go fellow hikers! Here at the AT Lodge I’ve met two southbound flipfloppers, Caveman and Truck, who will be heading out with me tomorrow AM on our climb up Katahdin.
I plan on doing daily trail journal entries to document my hike, although lack of cell coverage may delay posting of my entries for a day or two. I’ve also decided that in terms of the trail mileposts recorded in my entries I will work backwards from Katahdin (MP 2190.9) to Vernon, NJ (MP 1358.0).    It’s just easier this way, especially since I have the northbound versions of the two apps on my phone (Guthook and The AT Guide).  I’ve got 832.9 miles to go, but who’s counting....HaHa, I guess I am!
For those of you that are following along on my hike via. trailjournals.com, thank you for your interest - I’ll try not to bore you to tears.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601848,"I didn’t sleep much last nite at the AT Lodge.  My bunk was comfortable enough, it’s just that I was filled anticipation of being on the trail again.  I’m sure I’ll make up for it tonite, I expect to sleep very soundly. 
After a hearty breakfast at the AT Diner, four of us southbound flipfloppers (Caveman, Truck, Drizzy and Opa) got shuttled and  dropped off at Katahdin Stream Campground around 0730.  We checked in at the ranger station, and were very fortunate to get a campsite here at KSC that 3 of us are sharing tonite. My pack weighed in at 37lbs, whoa nellie, that’s the heaviest it has been. About half the weight is water and food (I’ve get enough to get me to Monson).
Once I started hiking, I was both elated and thankful to once again be back on the trail.  Thank you Kayanne for your never ending support of my endeavor - without you, I couldn’t be out here. 
My one and only previous climb up Katahdin was in 2010, when my buddy Art and I went up/down via the Hunt Trail (the AT). I debated about going up via a different route today (e.g. the Abol Trail), but ultimately decided to stick with the trail I knew from my previous climb. I know my friend and former AT thru hiker Rev. Yukon Jack will be disappointed that I didn’t broaden my horizons by trying a different trail, but hey, at least I’m hiking! The weather today was great, dry and not too warm, but unfortunately the summit was in the clouds when I got there so no views. There was some clearing on my way down (naturally, shortly after I left the summit), so I did enjoy some great views of the Maine wilderness. Lots of people on the trail today, taking advantage of the weather. 
I expected I’d have a tough go of it today as I’m not in as good a shape as I’d like to be - and I did struggle a bit. I hiked 10.4 miles today, but of course only 5.2 of those miles actually counted towards my trip mileage. It took me 4.25 hrs to go up, and 4 hrs coming down. The trail had a couple more rocks on it than from when I hiked it before, rock nos. 4,567,883 and 4,567,884, HaHa. By the way, on Katahdin  a rock has to be at least 12” or larger to be considered a “rock”, anything smaller is a pebble. 
Now that I’m back at the campsite just lounging around after dinner, the soreness is starting to set in. I think tonite I’ll pop a couple Tylenol PMs.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601934,"I woke up a little before 04:00, and decided to pack up and get hiking. I was on the trail at 4:35. An early morning for sure. Caveman and Truck were not stirring, so I assume they elected to sleep in a bit. Go figure! I was able to turn off my headlamp at 05:30.  I really enjoy being on the trail early in the morning - the forest has its own surreal qualities, and there’s a stillness in the air that in many respects is very calming. Of course being the first one down the trail brings with it the job of clearing out the spiderwebs!
Today was just a bluebird day for hiking. Clear blue skies, comfortable temps, and only a slight breeze. Hey Mother Nature, maybe you’re going to make up for all those cold/snowy days you threw at us down south in March and early April.  Another 50 or so days like today would be perfect!
Trail conditions today were pretty tame, with the stretch from KSC to Abol Bridge being fairly flat. According to Guthook today’s climbing elevation was a modest 1,800’, but let me tell you the trail kicked my butt -I was really dragging by the end of the day. Still recovering from yesterday I guess. My legs felt like wooden appendages when I dragged into camp - and it’s not like I was moving along at any kind of a pace. Took me 10:20 to hike today’s 17.8 miles. I know it’s only been two days since I’ve resumed my hike so I shouldn’t expect a lot, but I sure hope I get my trail legs back by the time I hit the southern Maine mountains. The heavy pack with all that food I’m lugging around doesn’t help. I suppose I could eat half my food tonite to lighten the load, HaHa, but I’d really regret that about 4 days from now.
I stopped at the little camp store at Abol Bridge, was hoping to get some kind of breakfast sandwich, but they didn’t have much. There was a nice view back to Katahdin from Rainbow Ledges, folks hiking Katahdin today will enjoy fantastic views. Lots if blueberries to enjoy up on the Ledges as well. 
I crossed paths with maybe around 20 NOBOs.  In passing we generally just exchange pleasantries (hi, how’s it going....have a great day), but I can tell that they are NOBOs nearing completion of their AT thru hike: they look lean & mean, are generally grungy looking, and have a determined look on their face. Congrats to all of you!  Once in awhile a more lengthy conversation is engaged, today I chatted for several minutes with a NOBO couple here from England!
I am camped tonite at a tentsite along the shore of Rainbow Lake. So far I am the only one here, it is a very picturesque setting.  Just sitting on a rock looking out on the lake as I type this journal entry. Best part is no mosquitos! Looking forward to a nice leisurely evening/dinner, before hitting the sack. We’ll do it again tomorrow. 
I expect to be safe, warm and dry in my tent tonite. Goodnite.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602127,"I’m starting to have my doubts about the “remoteness” of the 100 Mile Wilderness - that maybe it’s part of the Maine mystique put forth by their Dept. of Tourism. My suspicions were first raised a couple days ago by the shuttle driver from the AT Lodge, who commented on the ride to Baxter that the wilderness was not as remote as people thought. So today the trail takes me across two roads, on one of which there was a van full of people driving by. I waved, and they waved back. Heck, for all I know they were on tour, and I was one of the exhibits. I can just imagine what the tour guide was saying “....there’s one folks, an AT thru hiker....just look how forlorn and grundgy he looks....it’s OK to wave, but keep your windows closed....and for God’s sake hang onto your food!!!!!”. But I digress.  A little ways later down the trail I walk by a rowboat sitting right alongside the trail, with a placard affixed to it on which is written a persons name and phone no. Is this person trying to sell/rent his boat?  I don’t know, but apparently the individual has a marketing strategy of some kind. At my camping site tonite along the lake there’s another road, and folks have driven in to camp. How remote is that?  I’ve also learned that 10 miles south of here, at a spot where the AT crosses another road, there is trail magic where grills are setup and burgers/dogs/refreshments are available. Admittedly I am only about 25 miles into the 100 Mile Wilderness, so I’ll reserve final judgement until completed, but so far the “remoteness” aspect is escaping me. 
While hiking along today I heard some howling off in the distance that I mistook for coyotes. I was informed by a section hiker, a Maine resident,  that those were actually hound dogs I was hearing, that they are used by hunters in their pursuit of bear - that it is now bear season. This makes me mildly nervous as I have put on a few pounds while being largely sedentary this summer, so I sure hope some trigger happy hunter doesn’t mistake me for a small bear. I’m now really glad that I shaved off my beard. 
As I rolled into my camping spot tonite I was greeted by a thru hiker, and I could tell right away that he was having a bad day. His trail name is Cordial, turns out he’s a southbound flip flopper like me, and the poor guy had almost no food left. He has a food drop waiting for him about 20 miles down the trail, but that is a good days hike away. I gave him a large bag of trail mix and some power gels to tide him over, he was so appreciative and thanked me profusely before proceeding on down the trail. Hey,  that’s one way to lighten my food bag!
As far as the hiking was concerned, another great day weather wise. Nice view back towards Katahdin from the summit of Nesuntabunt Mt. I crossed paths with maybe 20 NOBOs, there is definitely a northbound bubble coming through.  I have a great private camping spot along the lake, first thing I did was go for a swim to get some of the stink off me - it felt so good. Awesome sunset tonite.
As expected my legs are very tired again tonite, but they’ll come around. Again no cell coverage from my camping spot, will see what I get when I’m up on a peak/ridgeline tomorrow.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602128,"Had a very pleasant nite last nite camped along the lake, but in the AM my fly was completely soaked both inside and outside. It did its job though, as my tent/gear were all dry. 
The trail here in Maine is really beautiful as it meanders through the woods and along small ponds and lakes. Overall the trail is very well maintained (thank you trail crews!), and today in particular it has been easy walking. It’s a good thing because for the first half of the day my legs just did not want to cooperate - but for some reason they felt rejuvenated in the afternoon. Go figure!  Honestly the only reason I managed 18.9 miles today is because there was minimal climbing. 
Haven’t seen a whole lot of wildlife so far, just chipmunks, red squirrels (they are much smaller than the grey squirrels we have back home), mice and toads. And of course various birds and the sound of woodpeckers. However I have seen bear scat and moose droppings on the trail, so you know they are out here. It was a warm day today, which brought the mosquitos out. Had to use some DEET, which proved effective. 
I benefitted from some trail magic today at Jo Mary road, it was great. Arrived there at around 14:30.  Baguette, a very pleasant grad student from U Maine, had chips, pastries and cold drinks available, along with some lawn chairs to take the load off. Baguette thru hiked the AT last year with her Mom, she was now giving back. What a treat, I was so grateful.  There were a couple of other thru hikers there, one of whom told me he never hangs a bear bag and always sleeps with his food in his tent because he says bears can’t smell your food. Well I thought, I’ve never heard that one before! Think I’ll continue to hang a bear bag every nite. I lingered for about 40 minutes, during which time maybe 4-5 cars/pickups drove by on Jo Mary road - further dispelling the “remoteness” mystique of the 100 Mile Wilderness. 
For tomorrow I’m planning a shorter day, in preparation for Tuesday’s first significant uphill since Katahdin:  peaks White Cap, Hay, West and Gulf Hagas. I’m happy to report that so far at least my feet are holding up. I am trying to hike a little “smarter” than I did on my first leg, by stepping carefully so that I avoid stepping directly on sharp/pointy rocks/roots as much as possible - especially with my right foot. It’s not always possible, but I’m trying to avoid a stress fracture reinjury. 
I’m in my tent here at the lean-to, my tentsite is right next to Cooper Brook. The gurgling sound of the brook is very soothing. Also here is northbound flip-flop-flipper Peekachou (sp.), we talked for awhile about our hikes. It’s always interesting to hear about the experiences of others.

One thing the trail has taught me is that each day is precious, a gift from God really, and a day is not to be taken for granted. I am also grateful for my dear wife and the love we share, my wonderful family, and my friends. I am blessed in so many ways!
I originally intended for today to be an easy low mileage day, but one thing led to another and by day’s end I’d gone 17.1 miles and climbed 4,600’ over four mountains:  Little Boardman, White Cap, Hay and West. I’m whupped tonite though, won’t have any trouble sleeping. 
On the summit of Little Boardman I crossed paths with NOBO Zipper, who asked me to pass along a message to Biz. Sure I said, no problem, expecting to see Biz shortly. Well I hiked along crossing paths with maybe a dozen hikers, asking each one “Are you Biz?” I felt a little foolish after awhile, but about 1.5 hrs. later I finally crossed paths with Biz and was able to deliver the message. Being an old guy my short term memory is not what it once was, I hope I didn’t goof anything up in the message!
Unsolicited by me I today received commentary from two different NOBOs on the condition of the trail back to Monson. One said the trail was easy walking for the most part;  the other said the trail was rough- lots of roots/rocks. I’ll reserve final judgement till I get to Monson, but based on what I encountered on today’s hike I’m inclined to agree with the later opinion. A fair amount of blowdown on the trail today as well, that the trail crews just haven’t had a chance to get to yet. 
My carrier is Verizon which is considered the best on the AT in terms of coverage, but the only place I’ve had any kind of signal in the last 3 days was today on the summit of White Cap - and even then it was intermittent. I quickly called Kayanne, checked text messages, and uploaded my trail journals of the past two days. No service tonite at my campsite, so this journal entry will hopefully get uploaded tomorrow. 
It was generally overcast most of today, but no rain. At one point I felt some drops and quickly covered my pack and threw on my rain jacket, but no sooner had I done that and the rain stopped. I can’t believe how great the weather has been these past five days, lovin’  it! I am really pounding down the water though, as it has been warm/humid and I’m sweating like a pig on the uphills. Water sources have been frequent and plentiful though, so no issues there.  Laying in my tent with the fly pulled back I can feel the temperatures starting to drop a bit, which will make for a comfortable nite. The nites have been so warm of late, that I’ve hardly had to use my sleeping bag - just the liner is all.

Maine is known for not putting bridges up to carry the trail across rivers, and I had my first ford in Maine today across the West Branch Pleasant River. There happened to be a couple there at the river just as I arrived, Maine residents out for a dayhike (yes, that’s right - dayhikers in the “remote” 100 Mile Wilderness). We chatted for awhile and they were nice enough to take my picture. The water only came up to just over my ankles, but I did have to watch my footing as the rocks were slippery. It’s my understanding in speaking with local Mainers that they are experiencing a drought its been so dry. I hope for their sake that the drought breaks - but selfishly not till after I’m out of the state. Or how about this, it can rain at nite as long as the days remain rain free. HaHa, if only it were that easy!
I also encountered a Ridge Runner today, I believe my first since Virginia. A nice gal, we chatted and she passed along some information about the trail headed south. I have about 25 miles left to Monson, barring any unforeseen calamities I should get there by Thursday. Am hoping to get there by early afternoon at the latest, so that I have enough time for the usual:  laundry, shower, resupply shopping, catching up on messages and eating.  Trail hunger hasn’t really kicked in for me yet, and as it stands I can certainly afford to lose a few pounds. All the weight I lost on my first leg I put back on over the summer - and then some!
I continue to cross paths with the northbound bubble. Even though there’s a number of NOBOs on the trail, I haven’t had any issues finding a spot to pitch my tent. There’s plenty of designated campsites/LTs, and it must be that hikers are scattered at locations up and down the trail so that no one site has ever been crowded. Here at tonite’s campsite there are two other hikers. I today also crossed paths on the trail with two flip-flop-flippers, a lady and her teenage granddaughter (Tadpole and Peanut).  How cool is that! I also crossed paths with two lady section hikers who were suffering from blisters. They asked if I had any duct tape, and I replied that I had something better: Luko Tape.  They were happy/grateful. My campsite tonite is near a pond, gave me a chance to get cleaned up a bit. 
As far as the trail is concerned, it kicked my butt again today - but I keep on plugging along like an old stubborn billy goat. Mountains climbed today included Gulf Hagas, Chairback and Columbus. There was a nice scramble up a rock slide on Chairback that was fun - I would have enjoyed it a bit more if I was in better shape. I was whupped at the end of a relatively short mileage day;  will give it heck again tomorrow!
Missing Kayanne and my family, that’s the hardest thing about being on the trail. To my Grandkids, have a happy first day back in school this week. Opa is thinking of you and all the family as I hike on down the trail.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602357,"A couple entries ago I mentioned how I received some unsolicited feedback from two hikers concerning trail conditions, one of whom said the trail back to Monson was relatively easy. Well let me tell you, I couldn’t disagree more. The 100 Mile Wilderness may not live up to its hype in terms of remoteness, but it has been one rugged trail. Lots of rocks, roots, and steep ups/downs with some scrambling involved. One thing for sure though, the Wilderness is certainly a beautiful part of the country. When viewed from the top of a peak/ridge, one can only marvel at the seemingly endless miles of untamed forest within which are nestled ponds and lakes. Beautiful!
Physically I felt pretty good today, but it’s just not possible for me at least to pound out big miles. The trail is such that you often need to watch each and every foot placement, or run the risk of a nasty fall. As a matter of fact last nite at my campsite there was a hiker there getting shuttled off the trail because he took a fall and injured his knee. I’m surprised there’s not more of those kinds of accidents, or worse. Better to just be slow and steady. 
Peaks climbed today included Third, Fourth and Barren. I had lunch on Barren Ledges, where I had great views. Another beautiful day, but warm and humid. I’ve got a little over 10 miles left  into Monson tomorrow, which is manageable and should enable me to get there at a decent hour. Can’t wait to take a shower, I think that I’m the dirtiest/smelliest that I’ve ever been in my life. I’ve now been back on the trail a full week on this second leg of my thru hike, and have hiked 105 miles (plus 5.2). Considering in how bad a shape I was in when starting this leg, I’m happy with that. 
I did take a side trail today of about .6 miles R/T at Cloud Pond to grab some water, as I was concerned that some of the smaller streams might be dried up. My fears were misplaced, as water continues to be in good supply. Better safe than sorry. 
Tonite here at the campsite are 3 folks from Australia, Stu, Mark and Bell. They all work for Virgin Airlines, Stu and Mark being pilots that fly 737s. They are section hiking the 100 MW, today being their first day on the trail. They are experienced hikers, having done a lot of hiking in their part of the world. They are nice folks, I really enjoyed chatting with them.

I can definitely tell that the days are getting shorter, each day the headlamps are needed for a few minutes later than the prior day.  Had a thundershower this AM for about an hour, but at least it waited till after I had broken camp. The rain actually helped cool things down a bit, and I think it knocked down the humidity. It was so muggy last nite and when I first got on the trail, cooler temps and less humid conditions were a relief. I didn’t pound out many miles today, and I am still struggling with my conditioning. I continue to be very slow on the uphills, but I keep telling myself that it’s OK not to be pounding out 20 mile days. If it takes me a week or two longer to finish this thing, there’s no harm done. The main thing is to keep plugging along. 
There were no peaks climbed today, but still there were enough ups/downs that according to Guthook the climbing elevation was still a respectable 2200’.  Today’s hike did include a ford of Big Wilson Stream. Water was just over my knees, with a swift current, and the rocks were very slippery. There was a rope strung across the stream which between that and my poles I was able to keep my balance. Rather than risk going across in my crocs, I tried something new and went across in my hiking boots. I of course took off my socks first and pulled my orthotics, and the boots helped with the footing. Since the boots are non-GTX, they dry out fairly quickly.  I no longer have a need for my crocs, as I couldn’t wear them around camp anyway because of the need to always have the orthotics in place. In Monson today I went to the local post office and mailed them home along with a couple other items of unnecessary gear - all in the interest of keeping my base pack weight as low as possible. 
I arrived at the ME 15 trailhead around 13:15, and got shuttled to Shaw’s Hiker Hostel in Monson. This is a really great hostel, owned/operated by a husband/wife (Poet and Kim) that are former thru hikers. Got laundry done, took a shower (it felt so good), picked up my maildrop, did my resupply shopping, and had dinner at the local barbecue place. I shaved using one of those cheap $1 disposable razors, man that was brutal. Ouch! I wasn’t able to get all my whiskers off, but it’ll have to be good enough. I also weighed myself, and according to the scale at Shaw’s I’ve lost 10 lbs. There’s no way that is correct. No doubt I’ve lost a few pounds, but not 10.

Today should have been an easy day for me, being that there were no major climbs and good trail conditions.  Nevertheless I struggled today on any uphills that had any kind of a grade. My legs just feel heavy, I can go maybe 200 paces and then I have to stop and rest. I can’t understand it, and find it frustrating. Are there side effects to the prescription I’m on? Have I not given myself enough time to get my trail legs under me?  Is it something else? These questions go thru my head as I plod along. I keep telling myself that I’ve got to find a way to get myself through the rest of Maine and the Whites - even if it means doing low mileage days, which I’m ok with. Once through the Whites things should hopefully get easier. 
Yesterday’s stay at Shaw’s was great, I highly recommend it. Breakfast this AM really hit the spot:  juice, eggs, bacon, homefries and blueberry pancakes!  Poet does a nice job, and he has an amazing ability to remember everyone by name. There must have been 25 people there yesterday, and he knew them all by name. After breakfast Poet shuttled 8 of us to the trailhead, and I was hiking by 8:30. I was the only southbounder, everyone else was headed north. 
I think there were 3 or 4 river crossings today, all of which would have been fords in a normal year.  As it has been so dry of late, only one crossing was a ford;  the others were a rock hop. I also met another Ridge Runner today, he is actually camped here tonite at the LT. There are probably about 8 or 9 hikers here at the LT tonite, but everyone is in tents/hammocks;  the LT itself is empty. This is a great campsite, right on the shores of Bald Mt. Pond. Beautiful, with the sound of loons off in the distance. 
I have noticed that in the past couple days the makeup of the forest has shifted from predominantly evergreens to a mix of evergreens and deciduous trees.

Today however was a much better, I guess my legs just needed a tongue lashing. Today’s climb took me over two peaks: Moxie Bald Mt. and Pleasant Pond Mt. Great views from both:  the southern Maine mountains where I’m headed and Katahdin to the north. I could have made it to 20 miles today if I had to, but a little thing called the Kennebec River blocked my forward progress. However I am well positioned to catch the 9 AM ferry tomorrow as I am staying at the Caratunk B&B Hiker Hostel, which is maybe 200 yds. from the ferry. This was kind of an unplanned stop, but hey, sometimes you just have to be a little spontaneous. 
There were no river fords today as water levels continue to remain low, rock hops got me across. However the Kennebec is a different story, and fording of that river is strongly discouraged. I have read that there have been some instances of folks being swept away and drowned, after having foolishly attempted a ford. It’s just not worth the risk. 
Weather wise it was another spectacular day. It started out cool, I could see my breath this morning when breaking camp, but the cooler temps were just fine for hiking. I started the day with my fleece on, but was in a tee shirt by mid-morning. 
This afternoon around 15:00 I was the recipient of trail magic complements of trail angel Pineapple, right near where the AT crosses  Boise Rd. Pineapple lives in Augusta, which apparently is almost 2 hours away. That takes commitment!  Pineapple fixed me a made to order quesadilla with all the fixins, it was delicious. I was so full from the plate of food she made me, that I didn’t want any dinner tonite. Thank you Pineapple for your thoughtfulness!
I did pass the 1,500 mile mark today, so I guess I’m making progress!  I expect my daily mileage totals to drop significantly once I hit the high peaks of southern Maine, but that’s OK.

I am not into antiques, but even an untrained observer like me can tell that the home is filled with some rare and unique items. I had a great breakfast here, setting me up for another great day on the trail. 
It was 37 deg. this AM at Caratunk, needed my fleece for sure. I also wore my Buff to start the day - oops, excuse me Four Horsemen, I meant my Dew Rag, HaHa. It was a short walk from the hostel to the Kennebec Ferry, which started service at 09:00. I got there early just enjoying the morning sunshine and admiring the view. There’s a sign up at the crossing, warning hikers not to cross as dam discharges can cause a sudden increase in river level by as much as 4 feet. Greg the operator arrived promptly at 09:00 and I was soon being ferried across in the canoe, which has a white blaze painted on the bottom. I was the only passenger, so I got to sit in front and help paddle. I tipped Greg a couple bucks and thanked him fir his service.

My left heel is starting to become inflamed, but so far it is not impeding my progress. As fate would also have it I sent my compression socks home, because wearing them at nite my right foot in the area of my stress fracture hurt like crazy. Kayanne is forwarding me my compression socks, so I will at least wear one sock on my left foot. In the meantime I can keep the inflammation in my left heel under control via anti-inflammatories. There’s always something, but I’ll keep plugging along. 
The weather forecast for tonite and tomorrow looks pretty lousy- heavy rain in the forecast. Instead of pitching my tent I elected to sleep in one of the two lean-tos tonite to stay out of the rain. There are several other hikers here with the same idea, a couple section hikers and three NOBOs. Tomorrow morning could be interesting- we are all talking about just staying put to ride out the rainstorm. 
I ran into NOBOs Buttercup and D.P. Roberts today, they are from Germany hiking the AT.  I recognized them by virtue of their accent, and had been following their train journal entries. We spoke in German briefly, but then they reverted to English when it became apparent that their English was better than my German, HaHa. Small world. 
I am safe, warm and dry in the lean-to tonite, looking to ride out this rainstorm. Goodnite!","Stealth Campsite 2022.6

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602748,"The rain came down pretty hard last nite, and the wind was blowing. The LTs (there are two of them here at Horns Pond) are pretty high up at Elev. 3200’. However the shelters are very well made with generous overhangs, so we all stayed nice and dry. Much better than being in a tent when conditions are like this. There were 5 of us staying in the shelter that I was in, but no one was stirring in the morning - everyone was staying put for awhile at least to ride out this rain. 
I finally got going around 09:30, the rain was just coming down lightly by then. However,I could not find my pack cover. Went thru all my gear, but it was nowhere to be found. I store this in the back carrying pouch of my pack, and all I can come up with is that somewhere along the way it fell out as I was rummaging thru gear. Ah well, I have noone to blame but myself, it’s not the end of the world. While I was still at the lean-to I jumped online with Amazon and ordered a replacement, it will be there in Rangeley which is my next scheduled stay/resupply destination. I tell ya, these modern little portable phone machines are really something - I’m able to order from Amazon while in the Maine wilderness. I’m an old guy as you know, and I can still remember back in the day where we had a black rotary phone on a party line.
I do like my Salomon X Ultra hiking boots, they seem to grip the wet rock pretty well. I still proceed cautiously however, especially on the downhills, as one slip and nasty fall on the rocks could be the end of my hike. One must also be cautious on the log bridges that span the boggy areas of the trail, as these can sometimes be very slick when wet. Yep, you guessed it - my feet went out from under me and into the bog I went. Came out of it uninjured, but a little muddier - and with a bent hiking pole. Oh well, what are you gonna do!  I had purchased a new pair of Dirty Girl gaiters back in Monson to replace my old torn pair, and they looked so shiny and new that other hikers probably thought here comes a rookie. Well, my little tumble into the bog solved that problem. I was able to bend my hiking pole back into some semblance of straightness, so the only real damage was to my ego. Overall I can’t complain about the rain. I’ve been on the trail 12 days now into my second leg, and have had only two partial days with rain. Mother Nature, I’m good with those percentages, thank you!
I decided to take an unplanned NERO in Stratton, in part to give my left heel a little relief with a short mileage day, and in part to get cleaned up and dry out my gear. Am staying in a bunk room at the Stratton Motel and Hostel. Stratton is a small town, but has everything I need within a short walk of the hostel. Laundromat, grocery store and a place to get pizza. Ahhhh, pizza!  Guess what I had for dinner!
My plantar fasciitis and the inflammation in my left heel remains a concern, but as long as it doesn’t get much worse it is tolerable. My spirits remain high and I am as determined as ever to finish this thing!

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602843,"Last nite at the Stratton Motel & Hostel I ended up with two roommates in my bunkroom (basically a motel room with two bunkbeds in it):  Giggles and FBomb. Couple of interesting trail names. I fixed myself some breakfast in the common area kitchen this AM, the shuttle driver was there promptly at 06:00 as promised, and I was on the trail hiking at 06:30.
Yesterday’s shorter mileage day and Nero were just what the doctor ordered;  my legs benefitted from the rest, and they really felt strong most of the day. Folks have always told me that it takes two weeks to get your trail legs back. Well today was my 14th day back on the trail, and I think my trail legs are finally back. Only 13.5 miles today, but lots of climbing:  5,300’. With the trail conditions being what they were today, with lots of rocks on the steeps, it’s just not possible for me to pound out big miles. I’m very cautious/slow on the steeper descents in particular;  better safe than sorry. I’m good with today’s mileage in any event, and am well positioned to get into Rangeley on Friday as planned. I could have gone a couple more miles today, but Guthook was showing the next campsite as being about 5 miles away - more than I wanted to take on at the end of the day. The Maine woods have been so thick of late, that banking on finding a suitable stealth campsite is a gamble. 
Today’s hike took me across the South Branch of the Carrabassett River, which was a rock hop and plank walk. Peaks climbed included North and South Crocker, and the trail skirted by the summits of Sugarloaf and Spaulding. I did not take the side trails to either of these two summits, as I’ve previously climbed both peaks;  better to save my energy this time around for the AT I thought. 
Weather wise it started out as a damp morning, but the sun started to peak through later in the day. North and South Crocker summits are both heavily forested, and I could really smell the sweet fragrance of the evergreens climbing these peaks. Am starting to see just a little more color in the foliage, but it’s still a long ways to go till we see peak fall colors. 
While I was in Stratton yesterday I fixed myself a couple of sandwiches to eat on the trail today:  spam and spreadable cheddar cheese on sour dough english muffins. Now that’s good eatin’ right there!  Dinner was my usual hot meal:  freeze dried of some kind with tuna mixed in. My belly is full tonite!
As far as my plantar fasciitis is concerned, I had no issues today. At nite I am doing toe crunches like crazy, and I think I have found the right formulae for when and how often to take Ibuprofen. I hate taking those pills, but if that’s what it takes to keep my heels from becoming inflamed while on this hike I will all too gladly pop a few of these pills. 
There are several other hikers here at the LT site tonite. They arrived after I had already retired to my tent for the evening so I didn’t get a chance to speak with them, but I assume they are all NOBOs headed to Katahdin. I am happy for them, they are nearing the end of their epic journey!

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602911,"I woke up early, figured I might as well be hiking. Hiked from 04:30 till 16:45.  12 hours on the trail, but I made it all the way to Rangeley - a day earlier than I planned actually. Now I’m whupped!  Staying at the Fieldstone Cottages and Hostel. Since I arrived late I’m relegated to a top bunk, oh well. Low ceilings, I sure hope I don’t sit up suddenly during the nite!  No laundry on site, but the owner was nice enough to drive 3 of us to the local laundromat 3 miles away.  Getting in late to a hostel is never easy/relaxing, as there are just too many things to do (shower, laundry, open maildrops and organize food, resupply shopping, grab something to eat, start planning for the next maildrop, etc. ). Fortunately my two maildrops from Kayanne were here, including my compression socks;  thank you Kayanne! Also my new pack rain cover from Amazon was here, replacing the cover that I lost somewhere. 
It was once again a beautiful day for a hike. The trail was a mix of mostly rough trail (rocks/roots) with some easy trail mixed in. Peaks climbed included Lone Mt, Saddleback Junior, The Horn and Saddleback. Over 2 miles of exposed ridgeline today from the Horn to Saddleback and beyond, offering beautiful views while climbing. 
Today’s hike brought back memories of a backpacking trip I led across the same peaks, but in the opposite direction (i.e. northbound) back in 2007. There were 8 of us on that trip, including my friend Eric Oogjen. Anyway on the exposed ridgeline we got caught in a thunderstorm with lightning coming down. I gathered the troops, all experienced hikers, we spaced ourselves out 50’ apart and hustled across to get off that ridge as quickly as possible. I brought up the rear, and Oogjen was in front of me. I was a nervous nellie of course, as I really didn’t want anyone to get hurt or worse (truth be told a fatality creates a lot of paperwork). All of a sudden, with lightning all around, Oogjen holds up his arms and points his metal hiking poles straight up into the sky like lightning rods. Oogjen, I yell, gall darn it, what in the heck are you doing? (my words at the time I’m sure contained some expletives, but I’m trying to keep these journal entries “G” rated).  “Oh, it’s Ok” he yells back to me, “I’m just checking to see if I’m still in the good graces of the Lord”.  You can’t make this stuff up. 
I fid manage to fall 3 times today, nos. 14, 15 & 16, but fortunately was not injured. The first fall was when I stepped on a slippery root, the second was on a slick piece of slab granite, and the third was when a small rock that I stepped on rolled over on me (came close to spraining my ankle, but fortunately no harm done). All 3 falls occurred on downhill sections. 
Am keeping a close eye on Hurricane Florence, to see where it tracks. My heart goes out to all those on the east coast that are in the hurricane’s path. So far at least the forecast for southern Maine continues to look good.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/602967,"I guess those falls I took yesterday did leave their mark, as I was pretty sore in a few spots and felt it during the nite. My right hip in particular is a bit tender, but not so bad that I can’t hike. I guess I don’t bounce as well as I used to!
In looking out longer term of a few days, I have the Mahoosuc Notch looming on the horizon at Mile 1916. I’ve never been through the Notch, and it is considered to be either the toughest or the most fun mile on the AT - all depends on your perspective. The Notch is 54 miles away as of this AM, and my preference is not to be hiking thru there in the rain. The latest forecast is showing decent weather thru Monday. If I can average 15 miles/day over the next 3 days, that would put me in decent position to hike thru the Notch around mid-day on Monday. I have a plan/goal, now we’ll see how my body holds up for the execution. Hopefully the weather will also cooperate. 
Four of us were shuttled back to the trailhead this AM by Seth, the owner’s son. The other 3 hikers were all slackpacking, two headed north and one south. I was on the trail hiking at 8;  again this is later than my normal start, but when staying at a hostel one is at the mercy of the shuttle schedule. Seth the shuttle driver is a high school senior, a nice kid, we chatted on the drive to the trailhead. His school is in Rangeley. Total enrollment in the school, grades K thru 12, is 180;  Seth’s senior class numbers 12. Talk about a small school!
I crossed paths with a northbound hiker who stopped me and asked if my name is Opa. Why yes I exclaimed, somewhat surprised. His name was Jamie, a Maine resident, and he has been following my trail journal. Jamie recognized me from my journal photos. We chatted briefly, and I thanked him for following my journal. Small world. 
I also crossed paths with many NOBOs, maybe 20 count, as the northbound bubble continues. These folks are all on the home stretch, they only have about 220 miles to finish, and should have no trouble reaching Katahdin before the rangers close the mountain. Congrats to all of them!
Another beautiful weather day, the forecast for the high was 80. Today’s hike was rather nondescript, no real views per say, although I did pass by two picturesque ponds. I stopped and had a leisurely lunch near one of them. The trail had many muddy stretches, it’s simply impossible to either keep your feet out of the mud or to make good time. I also remain very slow/tentative on the steeper downhills, especially so after yesterday’s 3 falls. I’m camped tonite near Bemis Stream, with the next camping spot/LT being about 4 miles away after a climb of 2,100’. Physically I felt OK and could have pushed on, but I would have arrived quite late - probably after nightfall. I don’t mind breaking camp in the morning when it’s dark, but prefer to set up camp in the evening when there’s still some daylight. I’ll give it heck tomorrow, starting first thing with that climb up Bemis Mt.

Another beautiful day today weather wise, but man I tell ya, this trail in southern Maine is TOUGH and it is kicking my butt!  The trail is rough and often steep, with lots of ascents/descents. Take today for instance, 15 miles with 4,500’ of climbing elevation and 5,000’ descending elevation. With the rough trail, the steep descents I think are more difficult and take more time than the ascents - at least for me anyway. I was hoping to pound out a couple more miles today, but man I was whupped when I reached this campsite. Another very tough day is in store for tomorrow starting with a very steep 2,000’ climb up Wyman Mt, the goal being to get thru the Mahoosuc Notch on Monday before the rains arrive. I’d like to get as far as Bald Mt LT tomorrow at 15.3 miles, but there’s over 6,000’ of climbing to get there. We’ll see how she goes. Longer term, once I get past the Notch, I was planning on reduced mileage days thru NH and the Whites. 10 mile days are more realistic thru those mountains. 
I did pass the 1,600 mile mark today, a milestone. Also from the summit of Old Blue Mt. I got a great view of Mt. Washington off in the distance. That is one big mountain!
The hardest part about being on the trail is that I miss Kayanne and my family. Love you guys, you are in my thoughts always and in my prayers at nite. Hope all is well with everyone. I feel out of touch, because cell phone coverage is very spotty here in Maine. Generally there’s no coverage at all at my nightly camping spots. 
Four Horsemen and Young Guns, I think of the great times we had hiking together - I miss you guys. I hike alone all day, so it’s kind of lonely out here. I do cross paths with NOBOs during the day, but it’s not the same. At nite I’m very often camped alone (like tonite), or with a few NOBOs that have been hiking together for awhile. In all honesty at nite I’m so tired from the day’s hike that all I’m interested in is eating dinner, typing up this journal, and hitting the sack.

Once again I am whupped tonite, but happy to have made it as far as I did. This at least puts me in a position to have a fighting chance to get down the Mahoosuc Arm, and possibly even through the Mahoosuc Notch, before the rain gets here tomorrow. Of course I first have a 3,000’ climb over Old Speck before I get to the Arm. The Arm is one of the steepest descents on the AT, dropping 1500’ in a mile - and I’ve been told it is down granite that has been worn smooth, so it will be slippery. I see a lot of crab-walking/butt-sliding in my future, and I’m sure it will take me a couple hours at least to get down it. Hope my britches hold out! I hit the trail early today, I think it was around 05:00, and expect to be doing the same tomorrow. 
Another great day weather wise. I believe the forecast called for a high of 81, so I sweat like a pig and really pound down the water to keep hydrated. 
The climb today over Baldpate east and west peaks was spectacular. Lots of open slab granite to walk across, and the views were fantastic. My knees were shot the last couple miles, so I really had to take my time on the descents. As it was I did have a fall coming down, nothing major - just got a cut on my knee and it’s a little sore. I’ll be fine. I believe that’s fall no. 16 for me so far on the AT, in case you’re counting. It seems like in the past two days that I’ve seen fewer NOBOs than before. Could it be that I’m starting to see the tail end of the northbound bubble?
At camp tonite I did make a little repair to my pack, there was a tear in one of the water bottle pouches. I knew I brought along a sewing needle for a reason.  I used dental floss for the thread. It’s not the prettiest looking repair job, but it’s functional. 
No cell service again tonite at camp (naturally), so I’m feeling out of touch with everybody. I did give a call to Kayanne when up on a ridge, at the very least we try to connect by phone once a day.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603175,"I had never been down the Mahoosuc Arm or through the Mahoosuc Notch before, but have heard how difficult those sections of the trail can be;  the Arm especially so for southbound hikers, because of its steepness. To be honest, I was quite fearful about tackling these two sections. Well my fears have been put to rest. 
There’s no question that the Arm is steep, but I found it to be no more steep than many other sections of the trail that I’ve been on - it’s just that the Arm is much longer, and you need to be in full concentration mode the whole time. I was very careful/slow coming down; took me 1:45 to make the 1,500’ descent, but more importantly I made it down  without any falls. 
The Notch was also a challenge. Imagine a deep ravine that over time has been filled with boulders. The boulders were the size of refrigerators, cars, and sometimes even as big as a small garage. Sometimes you have to work your way through very narrow passages, but most of the time you are scrambling up and over. In addition to my legs, my upper body got a workout. Hiking poles are useless, you need to be in scramble mode. I had to take my pack off no less than 5 times; sometimes so I could crawl through an opening, and sometimes to toss it up on a ledge to lighten the load so that I could get myself up. A fall in certain places could have very bad consequences. About halfway through I caught up to another SOBO (trail name Cold Brew) who seemed to be having a hard time of it, we hiked together the rest of the way through;  it’s good to be buddied up with someone through the Notch. Took me an even 2 hours to cover this one mile. Was it fun?  Yes, in a certain sense it was - but I’ve had enough fun for awhile and glad that both the Arm and Notch are behind me. 
The weather was beautiful once again today.  Mts climbed included Old Speck, Mahoosuc Arm & Falling Mill. Only 12 miles today, but that is plenty. I  setup my tent tonite on a wooden platform here at the shelter;  since my tent is not  fully freestanding I brought cup hooks along, and they worked like a charm. Night Train, if you are reading this journal, that Nemo Hornet Elite tent you sold me is fantastic - I couldn’t be happier with it!

I make it a point to always treat my water, but I have recently had a couple instances where I was careless. A few days ago I do recall mixing up water bottles, and not being certain which one had been treated. One bottle may have gotten a double dose of AquaMira, and the other no dose. Also you are supposed to let Parts A and B mix and sit for 5 minutes before adding to the water. 5 minutes can be an eternity when treating 3 bottles, I maybe gave it a minute. Stupid on my part. I started having a bout of mild diarrhea along with an upset stomach a few days ago and didn’t think anything of it, but last nite the proverbial “sh*t hit the fan” - literally. I was up about 6 times trotting to the privy, and when I woke this AM around 8 (very late for me) I was an exhausted wreck. At one point during the day I literally laid down right on the trail and took a 30 minute nap I was so exhausted. I didn’t eat anything all day, except for a cup of hot chicken broth tonite for dinner. Every step was a struggle. Not to mention that about every 20 minutes I had to go trotting into the woods. It’s a miracle that I made it through the day without soiling my drawers. 
I trudged on, making very slow progress, and thought my hike was over. Of course the trail had no sympathy, on a couple sections I thought I was back in the Mahoosuc Notch. I kept thinking of bail out options, how to get to a road, but nothing. On the last climb of the day up Mt. Success I felt so wasted that I was contemplating calling 911 for help. Lo and behold on that climb I ran into a couple of NOBOs, who turned out to be my salvation. I will refer to them using aliases, Hero and Heroine, as I’m not sure that what they did for me will meet with medical approval. 
Turns out that Hero is a nurse, and he asked me a lot of good questions pertaining to my condition. We both concluded that I had Giardia. He offered some good advice, and Heroine gave me some electrolyte pills.  Heroine also wanted to give me some pills she was carrying, Flagyl, which is a prescription drug used to treat Giardia - but I politely declined and trudged on. About 10 minutes later Hero came running up the trail after me with the Flagyl, and insisted I take them. He stated that in as little as 2 hours I may already see some relief. I thanked him most graciousy and immediately took the first pill. That was at 15:30, and tonite already I’m feeling slightly better. I was later so overwhelmed with the kindness and concern shown me by Hero and Heroine, that I want to do something for them. I have some ideas.

That Flagyl I was given and have been taking since yesterday seems to be working. Of course the only thing I’ve eaten in two days was a cup of chicken broth and half a Cliff Bar, so my digestive system has not gotten much of a workout. 
I started hiking this AM at 05:30, and made it to US 2 by 15:30. It’s a good thing I made it to Gorham today, as I may have run out of TP with another day on the trail in my condition. Things would have then gotten pretty ugly! Fortunately the last four miles of today’s hike were all downhill on an easy trail. I hitched a ride from the trailhead, and got dropped off in Gorham at their local Urgent Care Clinic - my first order of business being to see a doctor. No luck getting in to see a doctor at the UCC, the earliest available time was Friday (doesn’t sound like much of an UCC). I was however once again helped out by the kindness of others. A gentleman overheard me at the UCC, and his wife happened to be a doctor at the hospital in Berlin. He drove me to the hospital, where I was treated most royally by everyone. The doctor did an examination, ordered some lab tests which I will have done at the UCC tomorrow, gave me some dietary recommendations for the next several days, suggested I stay off the trail until I’m feeling better, wrote me a prescription for the Flagyl, and then was kind enough to drive me all the way back to Gorham and the hostel I am staying at (Libby House B&B and The Barn Hiker Hostel). The kindness of folks never ceases to amaze!
I am definitely taking a Zero here in Gorham tomorrow, my first since I got back on the trail on 08/30. I will be busy between getting to the UCC for the lab work, stopping at the local outfitters to replace a couple of clothing items that have worn out, picking up my prescription, and resupply shopping. There’s lots of restaurants to choose from in Gorham, and I am so hungry I could eat the butt end out of a bear, but unfortunately my dietary restrictions will limit what I can eat. They weighed me at the hospital, and I am down 22 lbs since  resuming my hike on 08/30. I think I lost half that weight in the last two days. 
Thank you to everyone that has offered me encouragement and get well wishes, they are much appreciated. Hopefully this latest issue with the Giardia is just a temporary setback that will be quickly overcome - but I do need to be feeling 100% before tackling the Whites.

Fortunately there is a transit bus here that runs on the main drag between Gorham and Berlin, very convenient and cheap:  $1 for an all-day pass (normal price is $2, but they are running a special this week). First stop was at the local urgent care center to get my lab work done. Next on the agenda was a stop at a local tailor to have a tear in my hiking pants repaired:  another great deal at $6. Then on to WalMart to pick up my prescription and do some resupply shopping. Lunch back at the hostel (there is a small kitchen area here), a stop at the local outfitter in the afternoon to pick up a couple items, a stop at the post office, followed by a stroll thru the local park where they were having their once-a-week public market. Finally dinner tonite back at the hostel watching the evening news, catching up on emails and texts, followed by making a few phone calls to family. In between the running around I also managed to make some repairs to my pack and boots (super glue and tenacious tape sure come in handy). Who says Zero days are just for lounging around????
I was at one point today thinking of getting back on the trail tomorrow, but other hikers here at the hostel have recommended that I rest up and recover a few more days - which is what the doctor also told me. They are right of course. Climbing these mountains is tough enough when one is in good health. 
As far as my diet is concerned, based on the recommendation of the doctor who saw me yesterday I’m kind of limited: breads, rice, soup, applesauce, bananas, yogurt are pretty much it. I need to avoid meats, fried foods, raw veggies and foods high in protein. To be truthful I really didn’t have much of an appetite today (can you blame me with that diet?), but I forced myself to eat more as I wanted to gauge how my GI system was processing food. I still have the diarrhea, but the frequency/urgency are somewhat less. However I continue to feel tired and have just an overall general lack of get-up-and-go. I will see how tomorrow goes, and reevaluate. In the meantime of course the weather has taken a turn for the worse:  i was told by another hiker that winds on Mt.

Good hygiene can be difficult/impossible on the trail at times, that’s of course why hikers are more susceptible to contracting this malady. I apparently had (am having) a pretty severe case of it as manifested by my very frequent daily episodes of diarrhea, but I am fortunately on the right antibiotic (flagyl) and need to take the full 10-day prescription. The prescription can be renewed if necessary. I also need to continue with the probiotics, which I started taking yesterday. And eat lots of yogurt - which I can of course get here while in town, but is not available on the trail, HaHa. The doctor also gave me the green light to start eating regular food again, yippee - I had a pizza for dinner, it was soooo good! We’ll see how the processing plant does with that. 
Although last nite was not a great nite for me here at the hostel in terms of bathroom visits, today things are a bit better. In any event I am very relieved by the diagnosis from the doctor, and am pleased to learn that I am on the correct antibiotic. It’s as if a huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders. OK Opa I say to myself, it is time to get off your butt and hit the trail again!!!!  My plan for tomorrow was to take advantage of the free shuttle to Pinkham Notch offered by the hostel, then hike back to Gorham. This two-day hike would take me over the Wildcats, Carters and Moriah, approximately 21 miles, with lots of climbs/descents. The weather forecast for tomorrow has unfortunately turned pretty ugly, with 70 mph wind gusts forecast for the higher elevations, and I’ve been told that the rangers are strongly recommending that people stay off the mountains. I’ve hiked (crawled) up a few mountains in my day in 50 mph gusts, and that is my limit - it is very difficult to stay upright in 50 mph winds. No way at 70 mph. Bottom line is I’m going to have to hole up here at the hostel for another day. Fortunately I’m comfortable here and the price is right at $22/nite, but I’m getting very concerned that I’m pushing up against the weather window of opportunity to get thru the Whites. Snow/ice could knock us all out of the box at any time - I saw 20s in the forecast for Washington for a couple days; I’m not alone in that regard, others holed up here at the hostel share the same concern pertaining to the weather window. We’ll just have to keep an eye on the weather and deal with it as best we can. Madison Hut is also closing for the season effective tomorrow, which presents another dilemma to deal with. 
Tonite I went to a Beatles concert at the town hall here in tiny Gorham. It was a bargain at $20, the band was great, brought back a lot of fond memories. I was a young teenager when the Beatles first broke onto the scene here in the US on the Ed Sullivan show on a Sunday nite. My dad couldn’t stand them, I think I remember him saying something along the lines of “....long haired hippies....terrible music....they’ll never amount to anything...”. Hmmmm, we know how that prediction turned out, HaHa!

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603474,"This AM at the hostel we listened to the weather updates to learn that the forecast was improving. Still windy on the higher summits, but the forecast called for winds to diminish as the day went on into the afternoon. Three of us decided to hitch to Pinkham Notch and hike south: Mason, Moneypenny and myself. We weren’t sure how far we were going to hike, whether we were going to bail at some point (there are side trails off the AT in this area that lead back to the road) or whether we were going to hike all the way to Madison Spring Hut. I had all my gear along, and enough food to last me 3 or 4 days, in case I decided to continue on to Crawford Notch. I left some food at the hostel, and told Paul the owner that if I wasn’t back tonite to set my bag of food aside and save it for me as I’d be back within about 3 days. After all, I still need to come back and hike the section of trail over the Wildcats, Carters and Moriah. 
The 3 of us had no trouble hitching a ride to Pinkham Notch, but it was 10:30 by the time we started hiking.  We got to the Osgood Tentsite around 13:00, where we stoped and had lunch. Mason for some reason started having a bad feeling about the hike, that some calamity was going to befall him, so he elected to head back to the road via. the Osgood Trail. Moneypenny and I elected to continue on, at that point we were pretty much committed to going all the way to Madison Springs Hut. I’m glad we did, as it was good to get this climb behind us. There were great views to be had over to Washington and across the valley to the Wildcats and Carters. Although it was windy on the summit of Madison (elev. 5366), at no time did I feel at risk of being knocked off my feet. It was chilly however, between the temps and the wind; not sure what the wind chill was, but I had to break out my dew rag and gloves. 
The rocky climb/descent over Madison made it slow going. I think I arrived at the hut around 17:00, today being the last day that Madison Hut is open for the season; they close right up, there is no caretaker service here off-season. Fortunately both Moneypenny and I were able to secure work for stays. My first job was to walk around the outside of the hut and a short ways along the trails, and pickup any scraps of trash that I came across. My second job was to scrub a window frame. My last job was to wash dishes. Pretty easy stuff. In exchange I got to eat all the food I wanted for dinner after the paying guests had eaten, and I got to sleep on the floor in the dining room after the guests retired for the evening. There is no heat here in the hut, but it is still warmer than outside. All in all it is great to be inside the hut. Had I not gotten the work for stay, I would have had to have taken a side trail down to a camping area - about a 2 mile round trip detour. Besides Moneypenny and myself, there are 2 other thru hikers here (NOBOs) that have secured work for stays. 
No cell signal here, so I am not able to contact Kayanne and let her know where I am; for all she knows I am still at the hostel in Gorham. No worries sweetheart, all is well. I will both contact Kayanne and post this message tomorrow from a summit, where I should have a signal.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603513,"On the trail at 6:30 today. It was cold, I think in the 20s, as the puddles on the trail were all frozen. Brought back some memories of my hike down south with the Four Horsemen and Young Guns when we had all that cold snowy weather in March and early April. Hey Night Train and Capt. Blackbeard, remember that bone chilling nite we spent at Roan High Knob Shelter? Brrrrrrr.....!
Overall it was an absolutely beautiful day to be hiking this section of trail today - spent much of today above tree line, and the views were spectacular. Peaks climbed included Washington (the big guy at 6288’) and Pierce, and the AT skirted the flanks of peaks Adams, Jefferson, Clay, Monroe, Franklin and Eisenhower. The trail was a rock hop from Madison Springs Hut to roughly Lake of the Clouds Hut (which is closed), and after that point it became easier. 4200’ of climbing and 3200’ of descent today. 11.8 miles doesn’t sound like a lot, but I am very happy with that mileage here in the Whites. I was pretty whupped when I arrived here at Mizpah  Spring Hut. 
The summit of Washington was very busy today, lots of folks who either drove up via the toll road that goes to the summit, or took the Cog Railway. I spent about an hour on the summit at the visitor center, it was good to sit down, relax and have something to eat (I bought a hot dog, slice of pizza, powerade and hot chocolate) - and of course I used the bathroom, very important in my condition (my GI system is trying to get better, but its got a ways to go before I am back to normal). I also read a plaque on the summit, and learned that Mt Washington at one time was owned by Dartmouth College. Who would have known? 
I had no cell phone coverage with Verizon inside the visitor center. Zilch. There were some other folks sitting at the table I was at, one of whom had coverage (ATT), and he was kind enough to let me use his phone to call Kayanne. Seeing how I had changed my original plans and not having heard from me, Kayanne was naturally concerned. I had also not been able to post my trailjournal entry up to that point - it was only after I descended a bit down from the Washington summit that my cell coverage kicked in. 
Arriving at Mizpah, lo and behold Mason was there. He is hiking this section northbound, and hiked up today from Crawford Notch. We both managed to secure work for stays, we were happy about that!  It’ll be another cold nite, so staying in the hut is convenient. No cell coverage here at the hut unfortunately. 
I am safe, warm and dry in the hut tonite. Goodnite!

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603521,"Last nite’s dinner was tossed salad, pasta with sauce, stew, corn, bread/butter and a baked dessert. Better than the freeze dried dinner I would have otherwise fixed for myself. The hut Croo as they are called were very nice to us - not demeaning in any way. As a work for stay, we get to eat around 19:30 after the regular guests have eaten - not a bad deal. After I ate, my assignment was to take steel wool to a baking pan and bring it down to bare metal. Took me maybe 20 minutes, then I was done. Easy. Lights out in the dining room was at 21:30, which is when we can roll out our bedrolls and hunker down for the nite. At 5:30 there’s typically some clatter in the kitchen, which is a signal to get packed up. I could have stayed for breakfast and eaten leftovers after the guests were finished, but I like to get going in the AM so breakfast is not an option. I was hiking at 6:20. It was another cool morning, but warmer than yesterday;  no ice in the puddles. 
I had a pretty easy hike planned for today, namely to get down to Crawford Notch and then get shuttled back to Gorham. The AT skirted Mt. Jackson and then went over Webster, then ran along Webster Cliffs for a steep descent down to the road. Up top especially, that section of descent was really steep - very slow going. I find that in my old age the knees are not as flexible as they once were and my sense of balance has gotten much worse than what it was - so I am very slow on the steep descents. Better slow and safe I say to myself. 
Knowing that I needed a shuttle ride from Crawford Notch back to Gorham, I started making some calls from Webster Cliffs where I had cell service; I’d been told by someone that there was no service in Crawford Notch. I finally hooked up with a shuttle driver and made the necessary arrangements, stating that I’d be in the Notch at 13:30 - leaving myself plenty of time to negotiate the steep descent. As it turned out I made much better time than I thought, and arrived at the Notch at 11:30 with 2 hours to kill. 
I kept myself busy:  cooked up some Ramen for lunch, worked on this journal, and started planning for my next mail drop.  My shuttle service (Trail Angels) was about 15 minutes late, but not a big deal. I was soon back at the Libby House hostel, my old bunk was waiting for me. Shower, laundry, resupply, and dinner at Subway - the usual drill. One nice thing about the Libby House is that it is located right at the edge of town, so many services are just a short walk away. 
The gameplan for tomorrow is to get shuttled back to Pinkham Notch, then hike 2 days back to Gorham. This hike will take me over the Wildcats, Carter and Moriah; I’ll camp along the way. The forecast is for rain the next couple of days, but I better get on with it if I’m going to finish this thing. 
One thing I did while here in Gorham was to paint myself a sign that reads “HIKER NEEDS RIDE”. I went to the local hardware store, picked up some enamel and a small brush, and painted this right on my tent groundcloth. Mason gave me this idea, he has a sign and has had much better luck hitching a ride using a sign vs. just sticking his thumb out. Figure I’ll give it a try.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603560,"In view of the terrible weather forecast (heavy rain and chilly) I have decided to ride out the day here at the hostel - I’m not interested in hiking over the Wildcats and Carters in those kinds of conditions. Am hoping to get out again tomorrow. There are several other hikers here at the hostel, both NOBOs and SOBOs, that are all doing the same thing - everyone decided to stay put for the day. The hostel is not heated(it is a converted barn after all), but it is at least dry, has a kitchen area, bathroom, etc. For $22 a nite, not a bad deal at all. The owner Paul is also a super nice guy, very accommodating.
Another day of rest for my GI tract is also not a bad idea. I continue to have my “episodes” with my bowels, quite annoying actually and it sometimes gets me feeling a little down in the dumps. My prescription of antibiotics still has about 5 days to run, I sure hope things stabilize soon. 
I had just a lazy day here in Gorham, as all my errands, resupply etc. had already been taken care of. Went to the local diner (Welshs) for breakfast, and eventually made my way over to the library. They have a nice reading room there with heat and some very comfortable chairs, I grabbed a book, and promptly nodded off. Noone disturbed me - the librarian probably thought I was just some poor homeless guy that needed a break from the world, HaHa. It did turn out to be just a nasty miserable day today: cold, rain and windy. I think all of us hikers that elected to stay off the trail today made a wise decision.
I did order myself a new pair of boots, they will be delivered to a hostel that I’ll be staying at in about a week from now at North Woodstock. I really liked the Salomon boots that I’ve been wearing since Katahdin, but the soles on both boots have started to delaminate from the boot. I’ve tried twice now making a repair with Gorilla Glue, but the problem persists - and I have visions of being on the trail somewhere and having the soles peel completely off. There is an obvious problem with the adhesive Salomon is using, as the problem is on both boots in the exact same location. I did contact Salomon about this, and they are honoring their warranty and sending me a pair of replacement boots. Thank you Salomon!

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603654,"The day started so promising today, I felt pretty good  - except for that incessant C Diff diarrhea which won't seem to go away and is a real annoyance while on the trail. I made it over the Wildcats, Carter Dome and Hight. 6 peaks down, not bad. Then all of a sudden at Zeta Pass I got very dizzy/lightheaded to the point that I thought I might faint. This happened to me once before since I've been on the meds for my C Diff, although not as severe. Anyway today I tried to regroup and regain my strength, and started up the trail towards the next peak, but there was just no way - I was a wreck. My hike was over, my body was trying to tell me something. Fortunately there was a 3.6 mile bailout trail at Zeta Pass that took me down to the road. I stumbled on down that trail, going ever so slowly so that I wouldn't fall (as it was I fell once), then hitched a ride back to the hostel. I have no regrets, I gave it my absolute best shot, but my thru hike attempt is over. I am very comfortable with my decision. I always told my family, and myself, that I wouldn’t do anything stupid and press on with my hike if that entailed compromising my health. The time has come to get off the trail. 
I am very grateful for the time I had on the trail: I met some great people, was the beneficiary of the kindness shown me by others, got to see parts of the country that I had not seen before, and had the time of my life. I have memories to last a lifetime. The good Lord watched over me for 1700 miles, I am grateful and thankful for the many blessings he has bestowed on me. 
Speaking of the kindness shown me by others, when I arrived back at the hostel the owner Paul informed me that my lodging had been paid for by a trail angel who wished to remain anonymous. Another example of a heartwarming gesture!  Thank you so very much trail angel, whomever you are!!!!
My sincere thanks to my family, friends and all of you that have supported me and been following along on my trail journal. Your kind words and support have meant a lot to me.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609915,"Hi! Thought I'd give folks an update on my condition (just in case anyone is remotely interested), and what my future plans are for completing the AT.That C. Diff that I came down with last September while in NH, and which ultimately knocked me off the trail, really did a number on me.  Between the C. Diff and the antibiotics I was on, it completely wiped out the biome in my GI tract.  I was a hurting puppy for quite awhile, and have been seeing a GI specialist back home in Rochester.  I am happy to report that I am on the mend, and although not yet 100% back to normal, I am close.  The doctor told me it could be a year before I am completely back to my old self!  I was on a rather restricted diet (low lactose, low fiber, low fat) for awhile, which was a real pain.  No fruits, no veggies, no salads, no dairy products, no fried food - it seemed like all foods that I love were off limits.  However of late my condition has improved considerably and I have been incorporating heretofore restricted foods back into my diet with no apparent ill effects.  Yea!  I've also been varying the probiotics that I'm taking, and have settled on a combination that seems to be working for me.  All good stuff.I haven't been brave enough to go on any weekend backpacks, but have taken a few modest day hikes.  I also participated in the Adirondack Mountain Club - Genesee Valley Chapter's (ADK-GVC) annual Loj trip in February, and managed to snowshoe to the top of Esther, Wright and Algonquin.  I also get out most days for a brisk 3-4 mile walk, which includes one modest hill, to try and stay in some semblance of shape.  Now that the weather is nice I plan on getting back on my bike as well.  As an aside I was also asked by ADK-GVC to give a presentation about my AT thru-hike attempt at the monthly meeting in February.  At first I was a little reluctant since I was unsuccessful in my thru-hike attempt, but they convinced me that I had a good story to tell so I agreed to give a presentation.  Although it was a lot of work putting together a presentation, I'm glad I went ahead with it - it was a lot of fun, and there seemed to be quite a bit of interest by membership in the AT.  Thanks also to my good friend Bill Schweinforth, who incorporated my photos into a PowerPoint file and gave me some ideas in terms of what to present.The AT is calling me, no question about that.  I reminisce every single day about my time on the trail last year, and am thoroughly enjoying following the adventures of others that are posting journals - thank you one and all! I have so many fond memories from my own hike - and admittedly a few that are not so fond - but that are all part of the experience.  I could sympathize with this year's group of NOBOs that ran into some bad weather (cold, snow, lots of rain), but hang in there guys/gals - it is now April and the worst of the weather should be behind you.As for myself, I have exactly 500 miles left to finish the AT, having completed 1,691 miles in 2018.  I have about 12 miles left between Zeta Pass and Gorham, NH, and then I have the 488 mile stretch from Crawford Notch, NH to Vernon, NJ. My plan is to get back on the trail on/about September 1st, starting in NH and then heading south to NJ. My wife Kayanne is being a good sport about this, she knows how committed I am to completing the AT, and will once again be my ""support crew"" back home.  Thank you Kayanne, you're the best!  If I'm able to finish the AT as planned (and as I well know that's a big ""If"" - so many things can go wrong), I won't qualify as a Thru Hiker since I wouldn't have completed all 2,191 miles within a 12 month period.  However I believe I would qualify as a 2,000 Miler as defined by the ATC.Thank you to all the individuals that have offered me words of encouragement while I was in recovery mode, it meant so very much.  I will post another entry as I get closer to the date when I resume my hike, and plan on continuing with daily journal entries once I'm officially back on the trail.  Goodbye for now!  Opa","

I have a doctor’s appointment on 09/03, and assuming I get the green light I will be off and hiking shortly thereafter. I am so very anxious to get back out on the AT.
For those of you that have followed along with my entries last year (thank you faithful followers), you know that in 2018 I completed 1,691 miles of the AT before contracting C. Diff which ultimately knocked me off the trail. I have exactly 500 miles remaining. As I well know there are many pitfalls along the way, so nothing is guaranteed, but I’m going to give it my absolute best shot to finish. My plan is to resume my hike in Gorham, NH and hike south. I will likely skip the 34.5 mile section from Zeta Pass to Crawford Notch, having already hiked that section in September 2018 as part of my thru-hike attempt. 
As far as my non-AT life is concerned I am very blessed. Kayanne retired last December, and all is going well for both of us.  Kayanne and I now count 6 wonderful grandchildren (Link, Lucy, Elena, Evelyn, Charlotte and Owen) all of whom we got to spend time with this summer at our home on Conesus Lake. Never a dull moment, lots of fun!!!! I also had the good fortune this summer to take our oldest Grandson Link (9 years old at the time) up to the Adirondacks where Link and  I hiked up Wright Peak. That’s high peak number 8 for Link. Watch out 46ers, only 38 more to go for Link! It used to be me up ahead of Link on a hike up a mountain saying “ ....come on Link, you can do it....”. Now the roles are reversed!!!! How did that happen????
On a more somber note, while hiking the AT I will be thinking of, and praying for, my cousin Rick who is battling cancer and has a tough road ahead of him. Rick, my hike down the AT is a piece of cake compared to the “hike” you are facing. Keep battling buddy, I am pulling for you every step of the way!","

Tonite we’re staying at The Barn Hiker Hostel in Gorham, which is where I spent several nites in September of 2018 when I was suffering from my bout with C. Diff.


Eric is driving me up, and as I sit here in the passenger seat I feel a host of emotions. Excitement for sure, but also some angst (will my health hold up?) and a touch of disappointment. Disappointment because I know my dream of becoming an official AT thru-hiker is pretty much over. Get over it I tell myself, if I’m able to complete the 500 miles that I’ve got left and become an official AT 2,000 Miler, that is still an accomplishment. Deep down I feel blessed for the opportunity to give it a go as they say!


My wife and best friend Kayanne will once again provide her behind the scenes support and send me maildrops along the way. Thank you Kayanne, you’re the best! I will miss you, but God willing and if all goes well I should be back home by mid/end of October. I’ll be back home before you know it! Kayanne as well as the rest of my wonderful family are in full support of the resumption of my hike and I know they will be with me in spirit every step of the way! I’ll be thinking of you all, and will be sure to regal you with tales of my adventures upon my return!


I also often think about the wonderful folks that I met and friends I made while hiking the AT in 2018. Of course I have many fond memories of the times spent with the other Four Horsemen: Night Train, Captain Blackbeard and Jeep. How I miss you guys, what a great time we had while together on the trail! Also the Young Guns: T5000, Sour Patch, The Ghost and Mainer! A great group of young folks, I was your senior by many years but you never made me feel like the “old man”. Some of the other “characters” that I met along the way included Soaring Eagle, Rain Man, Bobcat, La Copa, Bolt, Tuna, Juice Box to name a few. In addition to the great individuals I met, there were breathtaking views that never ceased to amaze. One never knows what the trail has in store around the next bend or over the next ridge. There were challenges to be sure along the trail and times where I struggled, but that is part of the experience and what makes the AT so special. The trail left its mark on me in 2018, no small wonder that I can’t wait to get back out there!


I am leaving on my hike with a heavy heart as my cousin Rick passed away last week after a bout with very aggressive and untreatable cancer. The service and burial were yesterday, very sad. Rick was a great guy who touched the lives of, and was loved by, many. My heart goes out to Rick’s family - I’ll be thinking of you all as I hike the trail, and know that you’ll be in my prayers.","

At higher elevations there was some frost on the boards across the bogs, it is September in the Whites after all. In any event it was great to be back on the trail hiking again! The views today were really great, looking over to the Presidentials.


Overall I hiked 17.1 miles (this included my hike up to Zeta Pass from Rt. 16), but of course my recorded mileage only reflects miles on the AT. Climbing elevation according to Guthook was 4,500 ft. Overall a pretty tough day for my first day back on the AT. Peaks climber included South Carter, Middle Carter, North Carter and Moriah. I am tired tonite I must admit - the smart move would be for me to take an easy day tomorrow.  I’ll see how I feel tomorrow. Eric dropped me off at the trailhead today at 0500 hrs, and I finished at 1500. 10 hrs on the trail.


Tomorrow Eric will drop me off at Crawford Notch, since I completed the section from Zeta Pass to Crawford Notch in September of 2018 as part of my thru hike attempt. I will head south from Crawford Notch.


I came across maybe 15 hikers today, some northbound and some southbound. All appeared to be dayhikers, except for one gal that was backpacking with a pretty big pack headed northbound. She was moving pretty slow, so I talked to her awhile. She was a LASHer (long ass section hiker), just like me, HaHa. She told me she was struggling staying warm at nite with the gear she had with the cold temps - which are only going to get colder- so I gave her a few pointers based on my experience. I hope she does ok, she seemed like a nice lady.


Now for the real kicker of my day: I lost my wallet on the trail. I didn’t discover this until near the end of my hike, where I reached into my back pocket which I noticed had torn. I had no idea where this happened - and I covered a fair amount of miles today. My heart sank. But the trail provides, and all is well that ends well. A northbound thru hiker found it on the steep section coming down off North Crocker Mt. Anyway this evening around 1930 I received a call from the Rattle River Hostel just up the road, a hiker staying there had turned in my wallet and they had tracked me down. A MIRACLE!!!!Eric drove me to the hostel to retrieve my wallet, and I sincerely thanked the hiker that found it. Everything was there, nothing missing, and I gave the hiker a nice finders fee even though he was reluctant to accept it. It is heartwarming to know there are still good people in this world. 



PS: One note regarding trail mileage and mileposts. I see that the trail length increased by 1 mile from 2018 to 2019.  Not sure where the extra mile was added, but in any event for my 2019 trail journal entries I’ll be using the 2019 mileposts as per Guthook and the 2019 addition in the A.T. Guide (aka Awol). Also even though I am headed southbound (starting tomorrow) I’ll be using northbound mileposts for consistency with my 2018 entries.

I didn’t get a great nite’s sleep at the hostel, woke up at 2 AM and couldn’t get back to sleep. I’m pretty sure all the commotion/anxiety yesterday associated with my first lost, then found, wallet didn’t help. I experienced the full gamut of emotions, from being down in the dumps as low as you could get to being sky high. Well that is now behind you Opa I tell myself, let’s get on with the business at hand - namely hiking the AT. First order of business is to complete the balance of the miles I need (500) to finish the AT and become a 2000 Miler. Secondly I have this pipedream of rehiking next year in 2020, prior to 09/12/2020, the 1,691 miles I already completed in 2018. Coupled with the 500 miles I hope to finish this fall, this plan would then qualify me as a thru-hiker. So technically I am now once again a thru- hiker. Of course the chances of my “plan” coming to fruition are somewhat remote. For starters my better half, God bless her, is not in favor. Hmmmm, I will have to work on that!
Getting back to today’s hike I was on the trail hiking at 0600, and finished today at 1600. Lousy weather, it starting raining at 0900 and continued unabated for the rest of the day. Kind of chilly and windy up top as well. Oh well, that is to be expected after the spectacular day we had yesterday. It was somewhat tough trail conditions today here in the Whites (of course), especially that last 0.8 mile section coming down off of South Twin Mountain. You really have to pay attention every second, watching every single foot placement. All is well , I made it, so stop your bellyaching Opa. 
I did manage to secure a work for stay at Galehead Hut, which is much appreciated on a damp, windy chilly nite. I guess they took sympathy on this old geezer. I am the only work for stay tonite, I would have thought there’d be a few others. My chore will be washing dishes after dinner, pretty easy. For that I get dinner (leftovers from the paying guests), and after 2130 I can roll out my bedroll on the dining room floor. A great deal really. 
Looking forward to tomorrow, the weather forecast is much improved. I will be on Franconia Ridge tomorrow, really looking forward to it.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623027,"Today was a really beautiful day, sunshine all day. It was windy coming up Lafayette, with just a nip in the air - I had to put on my fleece, buff and gloves - but once I broke the summit of Lafayette and was on the leeward side of the mountain the wind diminished. Franconia ridge is just a spectacular trail, words don’t do it justice. This was my third time on Franconia and it never ceases to amaze! Lots of dayhikers out today on a Sunday taking advantage of the great weather. 
On the summit of Lincoln I found a nice sheltered spot and sat down for a nice leisurely lunch: a Spam sandwich. This was the first cold Spam sandwich that I had since I was on the trail in September 2018, and it was all I could do to get it down. I guess the steady diet of Spam I had in 2018 ruined my taste for it. Kayanne, if I ever put Spam on my maildrop list just ignore it please. 
I decided to do a shorter mileage day today, as I was pretty whupped. Today’s peaks included Garfield, Lafayette, Lincoln and Little Haystack. That was plenty of climbing, I need to give my body a chance to recuperate. Tomorrow I’ll be going over the Kinsmans, should be another tough day. Garfield in particular was a bear going both up and down, lots of big rocks to negotiate on the steeps. Although the climb up Lafayette was longer it was a lot more fun, especially once I broke treeline. Being on an exposed ridge, as long as it’s not precarious, I find to be very exhilarating.
I did run into some weekend backpackers today who told me that yesterday they got caught in a storm on Franconia Ridge. They claim they had 60 to 80 mph winds along with a driving rain. That’s the White Mountains for you, the weather can change suddenly and get ugly in a hurry. For many years Mt. Washington held the record for the highest recorded wind speed on the planet, I believe it was over 230 mph!
I’m camping tonite at Liberty Springs Campsite. There is a caretaker here and the fee is $10, but I’m OK with that. I’ve got my own wooden platform here on which I can setup my tent, there’s a privy, a spring for water, and a bear box for my food bag. Life is good.
Hey Grandkids, if Mom and Dad are reading you this trail journal Opa says hello. I’m always thinking of you when I’m out on the trail. In a couple days I’ll be at a hostel and if there’s cell service maybe we can facetime. And a special shout out to granddaughter Evelyn, who turns 4 today. HAPPY BIRTHDAY SWEETHEART!
As I lay here in my tent tonite typing this journal I can here the wind blowing pretty good through the trees - I bet it’s really windy up top. It just started raining as well - at least it held off till I got my camp chores done. No cell coverage here at the campsite, which is pretty surprising since the campsite is pretty high up at elevation 3905. I’ll try to post this entry tomorrow if/once I’m back in cell coverage.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623081,"I got a great nite’s sleep last nite, I was really tired. Felt refreshed in the morning when I started out. I haven’t found my true hikers legs yet, so the trail here in the Whites pounds me pretty good. I made it over the top of both North and South Kinsman, and am stealth camped tonite near the summit of Mt. Wolf. I knew the Kinsmans would be tough, and they didn’t disappoint. Lots of rocks/boulders on the steep sections, which once again required me to be very careful and watch every foot placement - especially on the descents. It’s been tough to pound out big miles here in the Whites. I’ve been told that after Moosilauke, which is tomorrow’s objective, that the trail gets a bit easier. We’ll see. 
A few of the leaves are starting to turn color a bit; we’re a long ways away from peak color, which should catch me when I’m in Vermont. Looking forward to “hiking with the fall foliage”!
Not nearly as many hikers out today compared to yesterday, although I did cross paths with two NOBOs (a northbound thru hiker), one section hiker headed north, two SOBOs and maybe 3-4 dayhikers. Nobody was very talkative, everybody seemed in a hurry to get somewhere. The NOBOs especially will soon be running out of time if they want to make Katahdin before the rangers close the mountain. I wish them well and Godspeed. 
I was on the trail this AM at 0600, and stopped to make camp at 1630. I knew it would be more miles than I wanted to hike to get to the next shelter, so when I found a spot to stealth camp (few and far between here in the Whites) I stopped and made camp. It gets dark earlier now, and I really don’t want to be stumbling around in the dark trying to find a camping spot, hanging a bear bag, cooking, etc. As it was the spot I found is pretty tight quarters, just big enough for my tent, but it’s fine for the nite. 
This morning, about a mile out of Liberty Springs Campsite, I crossed paths with a northbound hiker who said she earlier passed a mother bear with four cubs on down the trail. I made haste and was quiet, but alas the bear/cubs were nowhere to be seen. Bummer! 
Man, the cell coverage up here in the southern Whites hasn’t been very good, and when I do have it ( usually up on a peak/ridge) the signal is too weak to upload photos to my trailjournals site. Perhaps when I am at Hikers Welcome hostel in Glencliff it will be better, will upload some photos then.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623109,"On the trail this morning at 0400. I went to bed too early last nite, so I in turn woke up very early and decided to get hiking. I was a little apprehensive at first starting out so early with my headlamp on because the trail is so rocky and footing at times can be precarious, but on high beam visibility was very good and it worked out fine. It was eerily quiet this morning, unlike down south there were no owls hooting, no coyotes howling. 
I was a little concerned with the climb up the north side of Moosilauke, having read/heard all the commentary about how steep it was. I thought the climb up was pretty straightforward, what with all the wooden steps that have been anchored to the rock. However I could see where coming down could be a bit more nerve racking. For me the descent down the south face was more of a challenge, and long - over 3,500 ft. of total descent. My knees let me know it, I can tell you that! Today was my second time up Moosilauke, and both tomes the summit was blanketed by a cloud/mist and there were no views to be had. On the way down, below the cloud, there were fortunately some nice views of the surrounding hillsides. Fall colors are really starting to show!
Overall the weather has been great since I resumed my hike, with the only exception being that one rainy day on my hike up to Galehead Hut. Mother Nature, please keep the good weather coming!
Tonite I’m staying at Hiker’s Welcome Hostel in Glenncliff, NH. Hiker’s Welcome is only 0.3 miles off the trail, so it’s an easy sidetrip. I arrived around 1430, did laundry and took a shower to get the stink off. There’s only two other hikers staying here, so lots of room. At 1700 I caught the shuttle to a nearby deli where I grabbed a philly steak sandwich, chips, cupcakes and a ginger ale - that hit the spot. My maildrop was here waiting for me at the hostel, so no need to do any resupply shopping.On s further note, I have resigned myself to the fact that I am a Section Hiker, be it a LASHer (long ass section hiker), and no longer a thru hiker. until such time and if/when I actually resume rehiking in 2020 the 1,691 miles that I hiked in 2018, I will henceforth introduce myself as a Section Hiker. I’m OK with that

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623161,"I had the bunkhouse at Hikers Welcome Hostel all to myself last nite. Slept like a dead rock, and really felt refreshed to start the day. There were a couple of other hikers staying in the main building, one of them a NOBO, but other than that the place was empty. In speaking with the caretaker Mumbles, a 2017  (2018?) thru hiker, they are seeing very few hikers of late and expect it will be quiet until they close on 10/01.
In checking the weather forecast here for Glenncliff (elevation 1,000) before heading out this AM there was a frost advisory for tonite, so I expect up top it will be a nippy nite tonite. However no rain in the forecast for the next 5 days, so that’s great. I’m carrying my 10 degree down sleeping bag, so unless it gets really cold I should be comfortable.
Weather wise today it was absolutely perfect: clear skies, comfortable temps, and only a slight breeze. Couldn’t ask for better! Had great views from the summits of both Mt. Cube and Smarts Mt. Made myself a nice hot lunch on Cube, with the Green Mts visible to the west and the Presidentials to the north. Arrived at my campsite on Smarts at 1730, quickly made camp and climbed the firetower to enjoy the sunset. Beautiful!
Easy hiking for the most part on the trails today. Lots of climbing, but at least the trails were easy hiking unlike the rock hop through the Whites. Was able to pound out 20 miles as a result, while still taking time to enjoy the views and have a leisurely lunch. I feel pretty good physically. My knees ache on the downhills, but that is normal. I am in particular please that my plantar fasciitis is in check so far, no issues. I nitely do 200 sets of the Bill Crowe toe crunches, wear compression socks at nite, and of course always wear my orthotics - even in my crocs when lounging around camp. 
With the chilly forecast for tonite, I broke out my old black buff, the same one I wore on the trail last year. Horsemen, if you’re reading this I thought of you guys when wearing the buff and you guys kidding me how I looked like one bad a _ _ hombre and that I belonged in Compton. You guys were the best, miss you out here!
I did cross paths today with maybe 8-10 or so northbound backpackers that appeared to be thru hikers. They were with one exception all in a hurry and not interested in making conversation, understandable in view of the date. The one fella that I engaged in conversation was a NOBO, trail name Rerun, younger good natured guy. He said he needed to average 105 miles per week to make it to Katahdin by 10/15, that seemed about right. He’s already been in touch with the Rangers at Baxter, and they advised that often they keep the mountain open to hikers till  11/01 - and if they get an early snow in October they sometimes are able to open the mountain back up after a few days. I really hope the NOBOs trickling through now make it and that the weather cooperates. 
Thanks to those of you that have offered your encouragement in my trail journals guest book, much appreciated.

On the trail at 0525, am definitely noticing the days getting shorter. A week ago I could turn my headlamp off at around 0600, today it was 0625. The first part of today’s hike was a moderately steep descent down off of Smarts on a rocky trail. I overdid it a bit yesterday in my frantic final push to catch the sunset on Smarts, and both my leg muscles and knees let me know it. I’m frankly surprised I managed almost 19 miles today. Tomorrow I hike thru Hanover, and I definitely plan on an easier day. 
It was another absolutely beautiful day today, the weather of late couldn’t be better. Mother Nature, I take back all my negative comments directed your way in the first couple months of my 2018 hike. Well, maybe not all. 
Before leaving on this leg of my hike I had cut myself pretty badly on my right shin about 4 weeks ago. No stitches were needed and it was healing nicely - up until today. In the early morning hours when hiking down I caught the pointed end of a branch you guessed it, right in the exact same spot on my right shin. It opened that wound up all over again, blood down my leg and into my socks and on my pants. I’ll be fine, but it just goes to show you that you can’t be too careful.
I was treated to some real New Hampshire hospitality tonite. About 1630, in the woods near Trescott Road, I was just getting ready to get off the trail and make camp in the woods when along comes a gentleman by the name of Matt that was out for a dayhike. We got to talking, and next thing you know he invited me to setup camp at his house which was just down the road. I was able to take a shower and do laundry. They offered me beer before dinner and ice cream after dinner, but I am a tea totler and still somewhat on the mend from my bout with C. Diff so I had to decline, but really how nice of them to offer. Matt and his wife Liz are a very nice couple indeed, very gracious, and tomorrow Matt will drop me back off at the trail. Once again the trail provides in ways that are uplifting to my spirit indeed!I just realized that I’ve got 100 miles finished on this leg. Less than 400 miles to go!

You are right of course, thanks for reminding me. 
After spending the nite comfortably in my tent in Matt and Liz’s backyard (you can’t beat a nice plush lawn as a cushion), Matt fixed me a mug of herbal tea and shuttled me over to the trailhead on Trescott Rd.  How nice was that! I was off and hiking at 0700.
I had a little over 4 miles of easy trail into Hanover, my first time there. Hanover is the home of Ivy League school Dartmouth College, and is also where famous author Bill Bryson (A Walk in the Woods) resides. Hanover struck me as a very pleasant, upscale town, which I guess is what you’d expect. The AT goes right thru the town center. I did my resupply shopping at the local grocery, and had a very hearty breakfast at Lou’s Restaurant: a crueler, large OJ, eggs, bacon, homefries and english muffin with jam. Yummy! I also went into the Dartmouth student union just to look around and give my phone a boost. I guess I killed about 2 hours in Hanover. 
From Hanover it was a road walk across the Connecticut River and on into Norwich, Vermont.  Maybe I had another mile or two road walk in Vermont before I was finally back into the woods. So far it’s been a beautiful trail here in Vermont with few rocks and moderate grades through very nice forests, both evergreen and deciduous. I can get used to this. Also saw a couple whitetail deer today. Weather wise another beautiful day. The only concern now is with water sources in view of the dry weather. So far it hasn’t been a problem, all of the sources listed as reliable in Guthook have had some flow; intermittent water sources are pretty much dried up. I’m carrying 3 water bottles totaling 84 oz., and I make it a point to top off whenever encountering a water source. 
Tonite I’m camped in the backyard of Linda and Randy, who live right near the White River bridge. They are AT trail angels, donation based, their home is right on the AT, and they are very accommodating and friendly. They have a porta-potty that’s available to hikers, a hose bib, picnic tables, large lawn area for tents, as well as a phone charging station. First thing they offered me when I arrived was a cold cream soda, my favorite! It’s now 1930 as I type this, and so far I’m the only one here. Only downside I see is that their property abuts a train track, my tent is setup maybe 75 feet from the tracks.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623342,"From what I have seen so far, Vermont really is a gorgeous state. The trail is a walkable path with generally moderate grades - vs. the steep rock/boulder scrambles in the Whites and in sections of Maine - and today there were several scenic views to be had of the surrounding hills. The fall colors continue to emerge, although I’m guessing this area of Vermont is still quite a few days from peak. Also saw several Monarch butterflies today; we don’t see many of those back home anymore. In any event I consider myself one extremely fortunate individual to be physically able to hike the trail and enjoy God’s beauty. I’m blessed in so many ways. 
I wasn’t really planning on hiking twenty miles today, especially the way I felt first thing this morning. Got on the trail at 0445, and the first thing out of the chute was an uphill. My legs felt like wooden stumps they were so deaden, and oh boy I thought, I better do a really short mileage day today.  In any event one thing led to another - err should. I say one step led to another - and next thing you know I was able to pound out some miles. I think my legs are getting the hang of this hikin’ thing. Not any really steep sections today, but a lot of ups and downs. Here in this part of Vermont the trail is heading generally west, which means its cutting across, as opposed to  along, the ridgelines. According to Guthook there were 6,300’ of climbing elevation today, which is a good day’s work. 
I also hiked today past a run of sap lines. Maple sugaring is of course a big thing here in Vermont. We have local maple syrup in western New York, but the Vermont syrup is the best!
I’m spending tonite in a private cabin called The Lookout that’s up on a ridgeline. The cabin owners very graciously allow hikers to spend the nite. The cabin doesn’t have any amenities like a privy or a nearby water source (so plan accordingly), but it does have a lookout platform on the roof accessible by a long ships ladder affording clear views of the surrounding mountains. Beautiful. It’s 1915 as I type this, and so far I’m the only one here. Not a lot of hikers out on the trail today which was surprising considering it was a Saturday with nice weather, albeit on the warm side. The forecast called for eighties, and I think we got there. I really had to pound down the water to stay hydrated, but so far no issues with the water sources.

They came in after dark, I was already turned in but not asleep. They are thru- hikers in various stages of completion, they seem like real nice kids. At least they are headed in the right direction: southbound. Anyone northbound trying to make Katahdin before they close the mountain has really got to be pushing the miles, with the hardest states coming up.
I started hiking at 0545, trying to be as quiet as I could when packing up so as not to wake the others. Admittedly my schedule, with the very early AM start, is not the norm. Instead of pushing on to Rutland, I stopped a couple miles short and am camped across the street from The Long Trail Inn. In so doing tomorrow I’ll only have a couple of miles to hike on the AT until it crosses Rt 4, where I’ll catch the shuttle bus to Rutland and take a NERO. My body can use the rest. One nice thing about being camped across the street is that I was able to have a nice hot dinner at the Inn: French Onion Soup and Irish Stew really hit the spot. They also have a separate tv room here, so I can catch a little NFL action before turning in for the nite. Another great day weather wise as well.
Yesterday a northbound section hiker was asking me which state, New Hampshire or Maine, is the toughest. It’s a difficult call, both are tough; Maine is longer, but New Hampshire has more steep sections, taller mountains, and tougher terrain. Both states have their own unique challenges, but in my opinion New Hampshire is the toughest with Maine a very close second.

The weather has been unusually warm in Vermont the past several days with highs around 80. Hey, I’m not complaining: it has been clear with no rain. I think back to the terrible weather I had last year when starting my hike at Springer Mt. in February. First lots of rain, then about 6 weeks of cold/snow. I’ll take 80 and clear any day.
Am taking a NERO today in Rutland. I packed up and left my campsite at around 0630 this morning, getting back on the AT via 0.5 miles on the Sherburne Trail, then from there 2.0 miles to Rt. 4. The AT took me past Maine Junction, where the AT joins the Long Trail (LT). From here south the AT and LT share the same path. Maine Junction is also where the AT changes heading from generally westerly to generally southerly. 
I made it to Rt. 4 around 0745, my intent being on catching the 0821 bus down into Rutland. Well when I got to Rt. 4 there was a section hiker there by the name of Bob, along with his very well behaved German Shepherd. Bob was in the process of hitchhiking, when along came a shuttle driver who offered to give the 3 of us (Bob, his dog and Opa) a ride into Rutland for $10 total. Good deal, Bob and I split the fare and I arrived at my destination (Yellow Deli Hostel) in short order. 
The YD hostel is run by a spiritual community, donation based, but the folks running it are not pushy about religion/spirituality at all - they are very friendly and helpful. My impression is that this is a very well run place, neat and clean, they know how to cater to hikers. I like it. There were a few other hikers here when I arrived, some AT section hikers, some LT hikers. They were in various stages of still checking out when I arrived, as I got here so early. 
Two of the folks that were here at the YD were Red Beard and Milkshake, who were at The Lookout with me two nites ago. At The Lookout I left behind my crocs when packing up, not realizing it until I was well down the trail several miles from The Lookout. No big deal I thought, they were not essential gear and were kinda a nuisance dangling from my pack. Well Milkshake and Red Beard noticed I left them behind, and carried them to the YD with the hopes of running into me. How thoughtful of them! Once again the trail provides. 
The YD also runs a cafe/restaurant, a very charming place if I do say so myself. I stopped in mid-afternoon enjoying a mug of herbal tea, listening to the “Norwegian Wood” style of music that was playing and people watching to pass the time. The YD was quite busy for a mid-afternoon on a Monday! I also walked around town just a bit and did some resupply shopping at a nearby Walmart (my maildrop was here at the YD so I didn’t need much), but otherwise I had myself a lazy day.
I have 90 miles to go till my next planned maildrop/resupply. Once again my foodbag heading out will be stuffed to the brim, I actually gave away some stuff to other hikers here at the hostel and put what I couldn’t give away in the hiker box. Pizza and wings for me for dinner! I’m looking forward to getting back on the trail tomorrow, although the weather forecast calls for rain (much needed).

Happy Dance, Raven and I caught the 0815 shuttle to the AT trailhead on Rt. 4, at $2 what a deal. We were hiking at 0845, the climb of the day was Killington. The AT skirts the summit, I did not take the short side trail to the top as it was raining by that point and I had several years ago hiked Killington via a different trail. Today it rained starting around mid morning, and lasted all day. I guess we were due for some rain after the nice run of good weather that we had. 
I rolled into the Clarendon Shelter at 1800, am sleeping in the shelter as opposed to pitching my tent in view of the rain. The shelter holds 8, and its a full house: a collection of LT hikers, some AT/LT section hikers, and one AT thru hiker (Kingfish).

I hadn’t gotten two words out of my mouth when he says he knows me. I’m drawing a total blank, but I tell him my trail name is Opa. All of a sudden he breaks into a big smile and he says “....ahhh....Opa from the Four Horsemen....”. He said he remembered seeing me on the YouTube videos that Capt. Blackbird posted. How about that for notoriety, and what a small word! You can’t make this stuff up.
My hike started today at 0630, I didn’t want to get packed up and on the trail any earlier as the shelter was full and my ruckus in packing up, no matter how quiet I tried to be, would have woken folks up. Deflating the air mattress is the noisiest activity, there’s just no easy way around it. I started the day wearing wet clothes, but fortunately it was a nice rain-free day so things dried out. Except my socks, they were still wet when I peeled them off tonite. And stink - peeling them off even made me want to plug my nose. I don’t remember them smelling so bad last year, must be part of the Opa aging process.
Lots of fresh leaves on the ground. There’s still a lot of green in the trees, so I expect this area may not yet be at peak color.
I crossed paths with quite a few northbound hikers today, and in chatting with several of them they are Long Trail thru or section hikers. The LT runs the length of Vt., from the MA border to Canada, and I believe it is around 270 miles long. The say the northern section, from Maine Junction to Canada, is quite difficult. I wish them well.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623535,"Was on the trail hiking at 04:45.  That’s just how it generally is when I’m left to my own devices on the trail: it’s lights out so early at nite (hiker midnite is usually 20:00 for me) that I’m generally wide awake by 04:00 if not earlier.
The day started out promising enough, relatively mild temps and no rain. My legs were lethargic after a relatively tough day yesterday. That’s the biggest difference I notice between last year and this year: I don’t bounce back as quickly as I used to. You’re just getting older Opa I tell myself, better get used to it.  Onward and upward I hiked. 
Not too far from the summit of Bromley Mt. (the ski resort), I crossed paths with a northbound hiker and in passing he says to me that he hopes the rain holds off. I knew there was rain in the forecast for later today, so I decided to see if I had cell service (I did) and see what the forecast/radar shows. The time was 11:45. Yowserrs, there was a pretty big line of heavy rain headed my way scheduled to get here before 13:00. I was 1.5 miles away from Bromley Shelter, with about a 250’ vertical climb still to go to get over the top of Bromley, then a 650’ descent to get to the shelter. Opa I said, you better muster every ounce of energy you’ve got in you and GET THE LEAD OUT. Fortunately the trail was not steep, so I was able to hike/jog at a pretty good clip. I don’t know how the heck I did it, but I got to the shelter at 12:10 and the rain arrived 10 minutes later. I patted myself on the back and said Opa, you’ve still got it when it counts. Ha!!! That was until I sat down and realized I felt like a truck ran over me! Now in addition to my bad kness that hurt with every downhill step, my plantar fasciitis that periodically flares up, a bad shoulder and a few other ailments, my hips - which heretofore never bothered me - are crying out in pain! Is there a doctor in the house? A mortician? 
Its been raining  steadily all afternoon, but the shelter is very nice, solid construction with a metal roof. I’m nice and dry, no issues there. First thing I did whenI got here was to cook a hot meal, followed by a nap. It’s now 19:15, and I’m still the inly one here. It rained all afternoon. I hope I feel better in the AM, or it could be a very long day! Tylenol PMsfor beddy bye tonite.
On an encouraging note I passed the 200 mile mark on this leg of my journey!

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623610,"Man, those Tylenol PM pills knocked me out - which is a good thing. I was asleep last nite by 20:00, woke up at 04:00 to go pee, then got right back in my sleeping bag and didn’t wake up till 07:00. Even though I was well rested, my body was very sore from yesterday’s sprint to Bromley shelter. Opa I said, don’t do that again - you’re not a spring chicken anymore. I didn’t pull/tear anything , but my muscles just ached. I had a fleeting thought of staying at the shelter for most of the day, but the trail isn’t going to hike itself. It was very slow going for me initially, but I finally gained my stride and was very pleased with the mileage I ended up. Arrived at my stealth campsite at 18:15, with just enough daylight to hang my bear bag and setup my camp. I ate a hot dinner at the piped spring near the summit of  Stratton around 17:00, so I wouldn’t have to deal with that at camp. I took care in hanging my bear bag, because reports are that there’s a couple of bears in the area. 
As far as my water situation is concerned, I feel very confident that I have plenty of iodine pills to get me to Bennington, where I have a maildrop waiting for me with AquaMira. What a rookie mistake that was by me, I really thought I had plenty of AquaMira to get me to Bennington on Sunday. Thanks again Kingfish with bailing me out with the iodine. I’ve been frugal with the use of iodine by boiling water whenever able, and as of tonite I have exactly 14 iodine pills left. That’s enough to treat 7 quarts of water , plus I have 2 full quarts of water in my pack tonite, so I’ve easily got enough water to get me to Bennington. Earlier today near the summit of Stratton there’s a piped spring with good flow. I know what Night Train would say if he were along, he’d tell me that I could safely drink the water right out of the spring - and he’d probably be right. Being the nervous nellie that I am, I boiled it anyway just to be safe.
The trails are really nice in Vermont, with gradual ascents/descents and generally not enough rocks/boulders to require  a lot of rock hoping. Vermont is known for its mud on the trail, but so far I haven’t found the mud to be a real problem. Of course keep in mind that my stomping ground is the Adirondacks, and Whoa Nellie let me tell you that we’ve got some trails that are so thick with mud, if you misstep you might be there awhile!
A special shout out to my friend Bill Schweinfurth, who has been doing his usual yeoman’s job of regaling me with daily “Go Opa” pictures from his travels. Thanks Bill, you’re the best!
I’m hoping to get to Bennington by sometime on Sunday. This AM I thought it might not be till Monday the way I felt, but I think Sunday may now be doable. Hopefully I’ll be able to facetime with my family when I’m there.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623622,"I woke up this morning at 04:30, and knew right away something was seriously wrong with my left knee. My knee was very swollen, and very discolored - lots of reddish/brownish splotches around the knee, and some of the discoloration had started to spread up my leg towards my groin.  My knee was also very painful to the touch, and was radiating heat. When I’m in my tent and deflate and roll up my air mattress I’m normally on my knees; well I could forget that maneuver this morning - there was absolutely no way that I could put any pressure on that knee.
I got packed up and started hiking (hobbling) at 05:30, hoping I could get to a road crossing soon. What else could I do? I knew I had to see a doctor. Well about 10 minutes into my hike I crossed paths with two other hikers with their headlamps on (normally I don’t see anyone on the trail that hour of the day) we stopped and chatted. I asked them how my knee looked to them, and their exact words were “Real Bad”. They told me I’d come to a gravel road with a parking lot in about 1.5 miles, and there were cars there. They said they were climbing Stratton and expected to be back in about 5 hours and if I was still there when they returned they’d give me a ride to a medical center. 
I continued on, and arrived at the parking lot in a little over an hour. Just as I emerged from the woods a former AT thru hiker Eileen was getting out of her car getting ready to start a hike. She told me she was not a doctor but worked at a medical facility, she looked at my knee, and then offered to drive me to the medical center in Bennington.  This was about a 25 mile drive I’m guessing, she dropped me off at the    Southwestern Vermont Medical Center Emergency Room. The kindness of Eileen was truly overwhelming! 
I was seen quickly by a doctor who asked a lot of questions, and upon examination said I had an obvious infection, could be either cellulitis, bursitis or some type of tick borne infection such as Lyme disease - although he felt Lyme was only a remote possibility. They put me on an IV with antibiotics and wrote me a prescription, and also drew blood which they will test for any tick borne infections. The doctor said it was a good thing I came in, as left untreated the infection could become very serious. He said I was off the trail for at least 5-7 days, and if my infection on Sunday worsens I am to go to a hospital emergency room. At the very least he wants me to see my primary care physician on Monday.
Although Kayanne wanted to make the drive (4.5 hrs. one way) and come get me, it made more sense for me to rent a car from Enterprise and drive home (it was my left knee after all that was infected, so I could drive).
It is now Saturday night, and I am resting comfortably in my easy chair. Of course I am very disappointed by this turn of events, but I am alive and kicking (well maybe not kicking right now), and will live to fight another day! Thanks to all of you that have been following along on my journal, more to follow.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623698,"My infected knee was not getting any better, so on Monday (yesterday) morning I saw my primary care physician and he sent me to the emergency room at Highland Hospital in Rochester. They did a thorough examination, more bloodwork, an ultrasound and xrays.  They believe that what happened is that I punctured my skin in a fall (not serious) that I had several days before my knee became swollen, as there is a scab there right on the kneecap. The area around my knee then became infected. That explains why I had some mild feverish chills in my sleeping bag on a couple of nights before the swelling appeared - I didn’t pay it much mind at the time. It may also explain why I felt totally wasted that day I made the mad dash to Bromley Shelter, and why I crashed/slept for about 12 hours right after - the doctor that is seeing me at Highland (Dr. Chan) felt that the infection had likely already started to set in at that point, it’s just that the swelling of the knee hadn’t started in earnest yet. 
In going forward I guess I need to do a better job in treating cuts: just brushing the dirt away from an open cut/wound, then wiping the blood away with my grungy bandana, followed by the utterance of a curse word or two, does not meet medical protocol.
Dr. Chan wants me to receive 5 total doses of the IV/antibiotic before I am discharged. I will get my 5th dose at 22:00 tonite, at which point Kayanne will take me home. Once discharged I will begin taking a 10-day prescription of antibiotics.  The good news in all of this is that the tests did not reveal any blood clots, and no apparent damage/infection to the knee interior.
Dr. Chan says I can safely resume my hike once the swelling of my knee has gone done - this might be as soon as a “couple” days, could be longer. He says I should use good common sense.  Hmmm, we all know how good my common sense has been of late.
Although I had previously told my family and several of my friends that I was likely done for 2019, the trail is calling me and I am rethinking that position. Kayanne is supportive of me having a final go at finishing this year; thanks Kayanne, you’ve been behind me all through this! I’ve got 277 miles left to finish, and from what I can see of the profiles through Massachusetts, Connecticut and New York the ups/downs are not nearly as pronounced as what they were in say Maine, New Hampshire or Vermont.
I will post another update once I see how things look. In the meantime thanks to all of you that have offered your positive feedback and support as I deal with this latest setback.","Stratton Arlington Road 1635.4

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623873,"I got discharged from Highland on Tuesday nite, my knee having responded very well to the IV/antibiotics that they had me on. I will continue with an oral prescription for 10 days, but in general my knee feels really good - much better than it felt exactly 1 week ago when I was seen at the Southwest Vermont Medical Center. The swelling is completely gone, and I’m able to walk with minimal discomfort. There is still a lot of discoloration of the area around the knee, but I expect that will take awhile to disappear. I apologize to my followers for all the drama (one health issue after another) associated with my hike - but trust me, it is not by choice!
Kayanne drove me up to Bennington, VT yesterday and we stayed at the Catamount motel, exactly1 week after my originally planned NERO in Bennington. This AM she dropped me off at the trailhead at 07:30, and from there headed back to Rochester. Thanks once again Kayanne, what would I do without you!!!???
I said to myself this AM that it is now time Opa for you to finally finish this thing you started in February 2018. 277 miles left: I’ve got to get to Vernon, NJ, mile 1358. Thank you so very much to my family, friends and well wishers that have been pulling for me - know that I’m going to give it my best shot! Kayanne’s birthday is 10/30, and I promised her I would be home by then.  Talk is cheap Opa, now you’ve got to deliver!
The trail welcomed me back with a cool (frost on the pumpkin this AM) but gorgeous day. In the week that I’ve been off the trail, the leaves have really turned color; beautiful. If they’re not at peak right now, they’ve got to be very close. Lots more leaves have fallen to the ground as well within the past week, the trail is now nicely carpeted. 
I came upon about a 12 person trail crew this AM, they were scattered a bit up and down the trail. They are from the Connecticut Hiking Club, and have been assigned a section of the trail within Massachusetts and Vermont. I of course thanked them for their service; without the hard work of dedicated individuals like these, who volunteer their time, there wouldn’t be an AT!
I got to my camping spot at around 5:30, glad to still have some daylight left to make camp. I don’t mind at all pitching my tent in the dark, that’s easy. Hanging the bear bag in the dark, however, is not my idea of a good time. Even in daylight, it can sometimes be a challenge finding a good spot for the bear bag. Overall I’m very satisfied with my mileage for the day; 16.8 miles after a 1 week hiatus from the trail, that works for me. It looks like it’s going to be a brisk evening, but I’ll be bundled up in my sleeping bag. Physically I feel really good, ready to give the trail another go tomorrow.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623918,"I had a visitor during the nite at my campsite, whatever it was it woke me right up.  I heard the rapid scurrying of feet around the outside of my tent, maybe it was a fox, just guessing. It definitely wasn’t a bear, I don’t believe they are that light afoot. I didn’t have any food/toiletries in my tent, that was all in my bear bag hanging quite a ways removed from my tent. In any event I turned on my light, yelled a few times, and eventually whatever it was went away. Nothing like a little company during the nite!
Got on the trail at 05:30, I rather enjoy that early morning time before daylight makes an appearance. There is definitely a sense of being alone at that hour, it is a very peaceful time - just me and my thoughts. I’m also not feeling any sense of urgency at that hour, I can just take my time and shuffle on down the trail at whatever pace suits me (unlike later in the day, where I might be pressing just a bit to make it to a shelter or camping spot).
Today was a rather uneventful day.  I hustled to make it to the shelter, arriving at 14:45. There was rain in the forecast for the afternoon, so I wanted to get to the shelter promptly and once there didn’t want to chance trying to pound out a few more miles at the end of the day. Today was overcast and windy all day, but not cold; I guess I’d characterize it as a “fallish kind of day”. Lots of leaves were being blown down by the wind.
I’ve only got about 3 miles left in VT before entering Massachusetts. In looking back on the 150 miles in VT, overall I thought the trail was really nice: the ups/downs were generally not overly steep, and for the most part the trail was easy walking. As far as the much talked about VT mud is concerned, I didn’t think it was that bad. I also caught VT with the fall colors on display, it made the scenic vistas all the more special. In any event, tomorrow it will be Goodbye VT, hello MA. The next 3 states for me are Massachusetts, Connecticut, and my home state of New York - and I haven’t hiked any of the AT in either of those states. Time to broaden my horizons.
Besides myself there is an AT section hiker staying at the shelter, he goes by Tortoise. He is hiking the section from North Adams, MA to Hanover, NH. Today was his first day out on the trail, he’s 71 years young - and I wish him well!

It wasn’t raining when I hit the trail at 05:40, but the rain started again at around 08:00 and went on for the rest of the day. I don’t know what it is with my rain gear these days, but I got soaked right through to the bone. Brrr....as it started getting chilly the higher up I went.
I didn’t see anyone else on the trail today. Of course once I hit the VT/MA line I lost whatever LT hikers there might have been on the trail. I crossed over into MA this AM, that makes 3 states left to go for me (make that 4 if you count the 8 miles I’ve got left in NJ).
Mt. Greylock is the highest peak in MA, and man it was a long uphill heading southbound. No views at all to be had, so I didn’t bother going up the tower. Well, I had a stroke of good fortune when I got to the summit, there is a lodge here (Bascom Lodge) and they have a hiker bunkroom. $35 for the nite, and that includes a shower. Being as wet and chilled as I was, it didn’t take me long to decide: I was spending the nite! This was an unplanned, but most fortuitous, stop. Better lucky than good I say. This leaves me with a longer hike tomorrow into Dalton, but I’m good with that.
So far I’m the only one in the bunkroom, I don’t expect there will be many more hikers here. The weather forecast is looking better for tomorrow.

Took me awhile to find the trail, and then stay on the trail at the road crossings where the trail jogged. Sometimes these road crossings are not marked with white blazes/signage as well as they could be. A couple times I had to turn on the GPS tracking feature in Guthook to find me way. I have found that Guthook is deadly accurate. Early this AM before daylight I did encounter a big, fat porcupine just moseying along the edge of the trail. He didn’t particularly care for either me or my headlamp, and in short order he ambled off into the brush. 
Last evening at Bascom Lodge a NOBO by the name of Calamity Jane, a younger gal, arrived after completing a 30 mile day. Way to go CJ! She recognized that Katahdin was not in the cards for this year, but was hoping to get through NH. Even that goal is pretty aggressive, as I suspect weather in the Whites could become pretty gnarly in a few weeks. I hope she’s safe!
Weather wise it turned out to be a pleasant day. I crossed paths with a couple of hikers, and also a large group of perhaps 20 that turned out to be high school students. I spoke with their leader, and the outing is part of a high school environmental conservation program that the students are enrolled in. They are on a 2 (or was it 3?) day backpack. Pretty awesome!

Fell asleep at 22:00, about two hours after my hiker midnite time of 20:00, and slept soundly straight thru till 05:00. Was out the door of the motel and officially hiking at 05:30, my usual time.
The trail today in MA was easy walking for the most part, and the climbs were very modest, making it easy to pound out some miles. I’m thankful for the miles, as it sets me up in good position to make Sheffield (mile 1522.8) by Friday where I have a maildrop waiting for me (thanks Kayanne) and will be making a planned stop there. 
Overall the trail here in MA has been easy hiking so far - and very well marked with white blazes, I believe the best I’ve seen so far. Although the trail is generally well defined, there are areas - especially at nite, through open forested areas covered with newly fallen leaves - where it is not so obvious. Thank you volunteers for your efforts in marking the trail.
I today hiked thru a couple of tree harvesting areas that were marked with informational signage. I could hear equipment operating nearby, but it was not close enough for me to see it. According to the signage there is an effort underway to get rid of the non-native Norway Spruce, thereby making room for native species.
I did cross over the Mass Pike, which I have driven on many times - always looking out for the AT pedestrian bridge when driving by. I also passed the “200 miles to go” mark for me - I’m getting there.
Most of the gear I’m carrying has been what I started with in February 2018 down at Springer Mt., and some of it is starting to show some wear and tear (just like Opa). Come on gear, let’s hold it together now for just a couple hundred more miles! I’m also on my third pair of boots, currently wearing Solomon boots which I really like - but the front rand on the right boot is starting to delaminate. I put some Gorilla glue in there to try and hold it together for a couple more weeks, I hope she holds.
I’m spending the night at the Upper Goose Pond Cabin, which is a fully enclosed 2-story cabin just 0.5 miles off the trail. The cabin is available for hikers to use, it has bunks on the 2nd floor, there are tent platforms, several privies, and a caretaker (very nice lady, goes by the name of Bambi) in residence. This was a perfect spot for me to stop at, as it was just starting to rain when I arrived. Bambi made a fire in the fiireplace, perfect; much better than either my tent or a shelter.

I woke up at 03:00 this AM, and laid there for awhile but couldn’t get back to sleep. No worries I said to myself, let’s get hiking. I was on the trail at 04:30. The Upper Goose Pond Cabin really was a nice place to stay at, as it so happened I was the only one there for the nite besides the caretaker Bambi. Bambi told me that during peak periods in the summer they could have as many as 50-60 people staying there between the bunkhouse, tent platforms, sleeping on the covered porch, in hammocks, etc. They will be closing for the season on 10/20. 
In general I’m seeing very few hikers on the trail these days. I think I saw maybe 3 hikers yesterday, and 3 today. I arrived at the shelter at 16:30, plenty of daylight still. No need to hang a bear bag, as there is a bear box here - as is the case for most of the shelters in MA. At least this bear box was relatively easy to open. Several nites ago I stayed at a shelter in MA, and the bear box  was not only bear proof, but also human proof. The clasp was tucked up underneath out of sight, and I really struggled to unlock that bear box. I wasn’t the only one having trouble unlocking that darn bear box! Tonite at the shelter there is one other person here, a backpacker by the name of Tim.
I wasn’t intending on pounding out 21 miles today, but between the early start and relatively easy trails it was not that difficult to make miles. This leaves me with a relatively modest 6.4 miles into Sheffield tomorrow, where I will be taking a Nero. Time to let the body recuperate a bit.

Fortunately there was a hiker friendly garden center nearby, where I could sit on a bench to wait for Jess Treat, who was picking me up and where I was spending the nite.
Tim, the other hiker staying at Tom Leonard Shelter last nite, got up shortly after me this morning and discovered he had a tick starting to embed itself on his chest of all places. He was able to pull it out, and told me he’s already had Lyme disease once several years ago and it caused him a lot of health issues. I know I’m in the heart of Lyme country right now, and contracting this tick borne illness is my single biggest concern. I’ve treated my clothing with Permethrin, will be wearing long pants, applying DEET, and checking myself daily for ticks. I am also carrying Doxycycline, which is the antibiotic for Lyme. The problem is that the little buggers are so small, one can be bitten and not even know it as there often is no telltale bullseye. They say that if you experience flu like symptoms for 2 days, there is a good chance that you have Lyme and need to start taking the Doxycycline. I guess there’s not much more I can do.
Here at Jess Treat’s I have my own room in her home, very comfortable accommodations indeed. There is one other hiker here, thru hiker Kingfish - who you may recall from a prior journal entry of mine he was the individual kind enough to give me some iodine pills when I ran out of AquaMira. Small world indeed, good to see you again Kingfish! Kingfish needs to get to Waynesboro, VA, about 600 miles away, to finish this thru hike. Godspeed Kingfish, you seem very well prepared and I’m confident you’ll make it.
Sheffield is a small community, but it did have a nice cafe where I had lunch. Later in the afternoon I grabbed a ride with Jess to a nearby supermarket near Great Barrington where I did my resupply, and I picked up some prepared food  (fried chicken, potato salad and a fresh baked roll) for dinner.  I also took a short nap in the afternoon - you can’t beat a mid-afternoon snoozer!
The weather forecast looks decent for the next several days, we’ll see how she holds (meteorologists have been known to get it wrong from time to time).

Included in my maildrop of yesterday I had Kayanne send me a hiking poncho that I owned which is large enough to fit over me and my pack. I had been a bit disappointed in the performance of my rain gear of late as both my jacket and pants seem to have lost some of their water repellency (I’ve been told that the use of DEET could be the culprit) so the poncho should be an improvement. I sent my rain pants home, but kept my rain jacket (which at least serves as a wind breaker) and pack cover. I will now have plenty of rain protection, especially for my pack: the poncho, pack cover, the water resistant pack itself, and my pack liner. On top of that my down sleeping bag is inside a water resistant compression sack, so unless I’m clumsy enough to fall into a pond and go completely under my sleeping bag at the very least should stay dry even in an all day heavy rain. My poncho is bright yellow, so at least I’ll stand out in a crowd when it’s raining, HaHa!
I crossed over into Connecticut today, another state (MA) down! Discounting the 2 miles that the trail  briefly crosses over into NY and back, looks like there’s about 50 miles of the AT in CT. The trail in MA was in great condition, with very little mud, not much blowdown, well marked and many miles of relatively easy hiking.It also looked to me like foliage was nearing peak in some areas as I was hiking thru MA. 
Anyway, onward now into CT - which everybody says is easy hiking - but it greeted me today with  a very steep and rocky climb up Bear Mt. Easy huh??? CT is also restrictive in that no stealth camping is allowed, which puts one at the mercy of the shelter and official campsite spacing. Today it didn’t impact me, as I was ready to stop when I reached Riga Shelter. I pitched my tent on a wooden tent platform, and there’s a privy and bear box here. The water source however is dry, but fortunately I topped off my water at a brook about 0.6 miles before the shelter so I’m all set. 
There were very many people on the trail today, mostly dayhikers but a few weekend backpackers. Folks were taking advantage of the beautiful day we had today, and enjoying the vistas and fall foliage. There were nice views to be had from The Ledges on Mt. Race and from Bear Mt.; not so much from Mt. Everett.
There’s a couple of weekend backpackers here staying in Riga Shelter, and they were telling me about a great restaurant in Salisbury, CT which I’ll be hiking thru tomorrow. I asked the guys if they had any garbage plates there, as I had a real hankerin’ for one. They just gave me a blank stare. I described a garbage plate to them: homefries, mac salad and baked beans on the bottom, topped with two cheeseburgers, then everything smothered in hot sauce. They were pretty sure that garbage plates weren’t on the menu. I still remember the time that my brother and I took our sons to Nick Tahous (home of the original garbage plate in Rochester) for garbage plates before an Amerks hockey game. You see Nick Tahous is not in the best neighborhood, and at the time it was frequented by cops and what appeared to be ladies of ill repute. My brother and I both caught grief from the wives for taking the boys there - but the boys loved the garbage plates!
I am safe, warm and dry in my tent tonite - thinking of the Grandkids (Link, Lucy, Elena, Evelyn, Charlie and Owen), and Brady and Jacob as well - and how it will soon be time to introduce the next generation to garbage plates. Goodnite!","Route7, Sheffield, MA 1522.8

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624162,"Man, I’m pretty beat tonite after pounding out some big miles. I hiked from 05:15 to 18:15. The trail today was a mix of easy hiking and some ups/downs with rocks. I had to chuckle to myself at a couple of stretches on the trail early this AM, where the rocks/cobbles had all been placed neatly off to one side off the edge of the trail so that the trail was a nice easy walking path. Had that been in either NH or ME, I’m certain trail crews would have been promptly dispatched with instructions to place the rocks/cobbles back in the trail where they belonged!
I didn’t see many hikers on the trail today, which was a bit surprising in that the weather was nice. Perhaps it was because there were a very limited number of viewpoints along the trail today, not many places from which to take in the fall colors.I was originally planning on getting to Cornwall Bridge for a maildrop/resupply in 3 days from Sheffield, with the third day being a Nero, but I managed to get here in 2 days. Am staying at the Hitching Post Motel. There’s not much here, it’s a small town, and by the time I arrived the local convenience store was closed. Fortunately the motel owner gave me a complimentary microwave pizza, otherwise I would have been relegated to eating freeze dried for dinner. Pizza, even of the microwave variety, was much better.
I know I shouldn’t be looking too far ahead, but I am starting to see that light at the end of the tunnel. Lately I’ve been telling myself “...Opa, you better keep pounding out big miles from here on in so you get to that finish line promptly, before either you break down, your gear wears out, or your boots disintegrate...”. There’s probably a flaw in that logic, but that’s my plan and I’m sticking with it. We’ll see how she goes.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624179,"Beautiful day today, even a bit on the warm side. I was surprised not to see more dayhikers out today on Columbus Day. I got a later start (07:30) than normal, as I was at the mercy of the motel shuttle. It didn’t hurt me though, as I still managed to get to the shelter with some daylight left. The shelter has the usual of a privy, plus there’s a bear box here AND a hand operated yard hydrant for water (but they still want you to treat).
With the exception of a brief 2 mile foray into NY, I was hiking all day in CT - only have about 3 miles to go till I’m officially in NY. The trail today was a mix of very easy flatlander turkey walk hiking (along the Housatonic River) and some steep and rocky ups/downs - and everything in between. It’s hard to believe that some folks are able to complete the CT challenge, which involves hiking all 50 miles in CT in a single day. Folks usually begin at the stroke of midnite when attempting this challenge. I believe that last year the Young Guns (Capt. Blackbeard, T5000, Sour Patch and Mainer) were successful. I don’t know how the heck they do it, the CT challenge is definitely out of my league.
I did leapfrog a couple times today with a father & teenage daughter, Alex and Claire, who are from CT and were out doing a 3 day backpack. Real nice folks, they were asking me a lot about my hike as they are contemplating embarking on an AT thru- hike in the future.
I did have two ticks land on me today, on my arms. Fortunately I felt them right away (now I know why the Good Lord gave me hair on my arms), and I was able to quickly brush them off. What a pain it is always having to worry about ticks! There’s a cold front moving in tonite, I hope that dampens the enthusiasm of the local tick population a bit.
Staying here at the shelter tonite is a 55 year old gentleman all the way from India, trail name KaKa (stands for Uncle). A very nice guy, he is attempting a thru hike but so far has hopscotched around a bit. He’s going to get off the trail for the winter, then resume his hike in March.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624195,"Hit the trail at 05:30, and officially crossed over into NY shortly thereafter. Also passed the “100 miles to go” mark, Yea! A nice day for hiking, brisk this am but it warmed up. Had another tick on me, but again I felt it and brushed it off right away. Also fell once, towards the end of the day when I was tired on a downhill section with rocks. Had my long pants on, so I only had a minor scrape to my knee (which I treated right away, I’ve learned my lesson). Other than that I’m fine.
I have 35 miles to go to Bear Mountain Bridge, 1404.4, where I have a room reserved for Thursday nite at a motel, and where I’ll be doing my final maildrop/resupply. I need to hold this date, which presents a bit of a challenge in view of the weather forecast and the shelter spacing. Rain is forecast for tomorrow afternoon, turning into a heavy rain overnite. I’d like to have a hard roof over my head tomorrow nite to ride out the rain. The problem is there’s a shelter in 9 miles, which would leave me a long 26 mile day on Thursday. The next shelter after that is another 32 miles (ie 41 miles from where I’m at tonite) - which is too far. There is a state park/campground that’s 14 miles away, which would leave me a manageable 21 miles on Thursday. The park doesn’t have cabins, but it has a nice hard walled restroom and hopefully a pavilion. Either of those would work to spend the nite. I plan on getting an early start in the morning and heading for the state park, with the intent of arriving there before the rain starts. Once this rain event is over, the forecast looks good for the next several days. In the meantime: C’mon NY, 32 miles between shelters is embarrassing - you can do better than that!
There’s one other person here at the shelter tonite, Tom, an AT section hiker. Plenty of good tentsites near the shelter, so I elected to pitch my tent.

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624224,"While hiking yesterday I crossed paths with a lady, trail name No Keys (she is an AT section hiker) out for an afternoon dayhike. We chatted for awhile, she seemed very pleasant, and then she told me that she and her husband live in the area and if I needed to get out of the weather on Wednesday I should contact her. I thanked her for that very kind offer, and we exchanged phone nos. I should mention that No Keys is a Marine veteran.
I got on the trail this AM at 05:00, wanting to pound out a few miles before the afternoon rain hit. I hadn’t quite decided where I was going to land, but kept monitoring the weather forecast. Heavy rain is expected for tonite with high winds: there is a flash flood warning for the area, and a high wind advisory. The forecast called for 1 - 2” overnite, with 3 - 4” in some areas. Not the kind of weather I wanted to be out in, so I texted No Keys to see if there was any way she might be able to pick me up at Dennytown Road. She said no problem, she picked me up at 15:30 just as the rain was starting, and took me back to her home where I am most comfortable. I met her husband Tom, plus her daughter and granddaughter who are visiting. I was made to feel most welcome. The kindness of others is truly overwhelming!
That leaves me with a very manageable 16 miles for tomorrow to get across  Bear Mountain Bridge at 1404.4, where I will be staying at a motel; this will be my final planned stop with a maildrop/resupply for my final push to Vernon, NJ at 1358.7.

I had a very nice stay at No Keys (Jenny) and Tom’s home, they treated me royally. I hope they are able to visit Kayanne and I at Conesus Lake, we’d love to have them!
I had some light rain this AM, nothing major. The heavy rain came down during the nite. It was windy overnite and today, there was some fresh blowdown on the trail. I heard that there were some isolated power outages. So glad I was not in my tent out in the woods last nite. 
I made decent time today, the trail had its usual dose of ups/downs, but no major climbs. I am staying at the Bear Mountain Bridge Motel, they picked me up from the traffic circle by Bear Mountain State Park at 14:45. Today’s hike took me across the Bear Mountain Bridge, a pretty impressive bridge with great views up/down the Hudson. The bridge represents the lowest elevation on the entire AT. Unfortunately I was not able to hike thru the zoo, as it was closed due to the high winds. Bummer, I was hoping go see the Black Bear exhibit so that I could say in good conscience that I actually saw a bear on my AT hike.
After checking in, getting laundry done, shower, etc., I did my resupply shopping (minimal) at the local gas station convenience mart. The hardest part about that excursion was getting across the very busy 4-lane highway! I also had dinner at a nearby BarBQ place: pulled pork, very tasty.
I now have 46 miles left, and am targeting finishing late morning Sunday at Vernon - that’s 2.5 days away. Normally I wouldn’t have any issue covering that mileage in those number of days, but I heard the next 35 miles in NY are fraught with slick lichen covered rocks. I’ve also heard that hikers often fall and get injured in this section. I’ll just have to be very careful and take my time, I’m so close the last thing I want to have to deal with is an injury!
My shuttle ride back to the trail picks me up tomorrow AM at 05:30, so at least I’ll get an early start. Weather forecast looks good.

The zoo was naturally closed at that hour, and my shuttle driver told me they’d likely be closed all day because of the winds. It was in fact windy today, but generally comfortable temps. I ended up putting my rain jacket on/off multiple times as a windbreaker. Generally off on the uphills, but on the rest of the time to break the wind. A fair amount of new blowdown on the trail today from the recent wind event.
The climb up Bear Mt. to start the day was a rock staircase, very easy climbing. I got to the summit and climbed the tower in time for the sunrise. The NYC skyline is visible from there. Link, Lucy and Charlie: I was waving to you in Brooklyn. Elena, Evelyn and Owen: I was waving to you guys in Westwood as well!
Today’s hike took me thru the Lemon Squeezer, a very narrow channel in the rock. The only way I could get thru was to take my pack off, and carry it sideways. A very tight fit. Other than that the trail was a mix of conditions, no slippery rocky sections (maybe tomorrow?). The trail also took me across the Palisades Parkway at grade, 2 lanes of traffic in each direction with a median. Traffic was surprisingly light, so it was easy to get across.
I got a big blister on one of my toes, I can’t believe it. The first one after over 2,100 miles, go figure. My sciatica also started acting up, but I stopped about 3 or 4 times during the day and did some stretches, which seemed to help. I tell ya, it’s a good thing I’m nearing the end of my hike, who knows what’ll break down next on this old quarter horse!
I was happy with today’s progress, as I am now in good position to finish Sunday AM. Kayanne is going to meet me at the Vernon trailhead, and I believe some other family members may be there as well. It will be an emotional finish for me!

Opa,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624304,"I started hiking at 04:30, knowing that I had a long and tough day. I wanted to get to Wawayanda Shelter, leaving myself a modest 5 miles to the finish line (Vernon, 1358.7) where Kayanne and some of my family were going to meet me. In addition my sister Heidi and her husband Gary were going to hike in and meet me on my hike out. I told everybody that I’d be coming out of the woods at 11:00. Only needing to hike 5 miles, I guess there’s no need for a 04:30 start tomorrow, HaHa.
Early on I did cross the NYS Thruway via an overpass. Kayanne and I have driven under this bridge many times when we travel downstate to visit the kids, and I always comment to Kayanne “look, it’s the AT....hallowed ground....”, and she just rolls her eyes. Now I’ll be able to say I’ve hiked the AT across this bridge.
I’ve heard from others that the trail in NY has some tough sections, and I concur. There were a couple of steep sections today that in my opinion were borderline dangerous. I did actually fall in one spot, but fortunately didn’t get hurt. It was on a steep downhill section, there was this small cliff that the only way I could get down was to sit on my but and jump. Of course the trail is covered in leaves, so I couldn’t quite tell what was underneath. Upon landing I slipped and rolled, but was fortunate not to hurt myself. Lots of ridge walking today as well on rock, which wasn’t bad except for a few gnarly sections. Fortunately it was dry today so the grip was good - but I imagine on a rainy day it could get a little hairy. There were nice views from up on the ridge, and although there’s still some nice color on the hillsides it appears that this area may be past peak.
I arrived at the shelter at 18:00, there were several weekend backpackers here already so I decided to pitch my tent. Am looking forward to tomorrow, it will be an emotional day for me.

I knew that other members of my family, who live many miles away, were also there in spirit.

I’m not sure I can find the right words to describe how I feel right now - there’s a host of emotions going through me ranging from happiness that I am finished with my hike, to sadness knowing that my hike is over. The fond memories that I have from my AT adventure will always be with me. I know when I was off the trail between 2018 and 2019, I thought about the trail every single day. The trail just has a way of getting into your soul, in a good way.
The trail was awesome: 2,191 miles covering 14 states, with some of the most spectacular scenery that I personally have had an opportunity to experience in this great country of ours - but make no mistake: while hiking the trail is an exhilarating experience, it is also a challenge. Anyone that finishes the AT, whether as a thru hiker or section hiker, has achieved something special and has a lot to be proud of. I am happy for each and every one of you - and I am certain you each will have your own lifetime of memories.
Hiking the entire AT, even though it took me 20 months spread out over 2 years, is without a doubt the hardest thing I’ve ever done. Hard physically, mentally and emotionally. I had my share of health issues and will admit that there were a couple of times that I thought I might not finish; I’m so glad I carried on to the end. Maybe someday when the going gets tough for one of my wonderful Grandchildren, whether it be at school, or at work, or whatever it may be, he/she will look back at old Opa’s perseverance on the AT and maybe that will help inspire them to persevere as well.
I am grateful to so many individuals that in their own way helped me along the way - starting with my wife and best friend Kayanne, who stood by me through thick and thin, and always offered her encouragement. Thank you Kayanne, you’re a special person and I’m grateful for all you do. Thank you to my family, who naturally were concerned about my safety but were always supportive and offered words of encouragement along the way - whether it was a quick text message, an email, a phone call or a brief FaceTime session. I am blessed to have such a wonderful family. Thank you to my friends, relatives, former colleagues, guest book responders and all those who also offered words of encouragement to me during my journey just when I needed them. Thank you to the great people I met along the way, some of whom have become my friends for life. Thank you to the total strangers who provided me with random acts of kindness along the way, you were there when I needed you and gave of yourself so freely - your kindness helped reaffirm my faith in humanity. Thank you to the countless volunteers who help maintain the trail, without whom there would not be an AT. And finally thank you to the good Lord, who watched over me and kept me safe.
