Whitetop,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614361,"Spent the morning getting everything packed up and then we did what all old hikers do just before a trip - we went to get a chiropractic adjustment!  Actually it wasn’t “we” - it was just me. I needed to get a little tune up to be sure I was ready. About 4.5 hours later, we were at the Hampton Inn in Franklin, NC. Janet found a great restaurant for us to try - Cafe Rel. We had shrimp and grits and Greek salad. It was fantastic!  Plan is to travel about 25 miles to the trail in the morning to meet a shuttle driver who will take us to the beginning of the trail at Springer Mountain, GA. Weather forecast looks good and dry. Looking forward to a good time on the trail. ",,View Entry,"May 23, Thu",0
Whitetop,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614613,"Got up early so we could meet a shuttle driver (like a taxi but just transport hikers) at Deep Gap parking area where we would leave the car. Met her at 8:00 for 2 hour trip south to Springer Mountain, the southern terminus of the Appalachian Trail. Got on the trail a little after 10:00. First half of the day was mostly downhill, but that changed and was a lot of uphill the second half of the day. Janet saw a Copperhead in first few hours on the trail. Then she wanted me to lead - haha. We were glad to get off our feet at the end of the day. Tented next to the shelter and slept well. There were about 5-6 groups at this location for the night. We got to know some of them pretty well.","Springer Mountain

Whitetop,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614615,"Got up around 6:30 and started breaking camp. We are not practiced enough to do it quickly yet but we are trying to get better. Started on trail around 8:00.  Several big climbs today. You can’t adequately prepare for these hills in Raleigh. Plan was to go to Ramrock Mountain and tent. Supposed to be room for 7-10 tents. Got there and not big enough for that many tents, and the sites were full. So we continued on not knowing where we would camp. We found a spot about a mile further down the trail and took it. A trail friend we met came by later with the same problem, and we invited him to share our spot. Turned out to be a recent early retiree from Wilson, NC. He didn’t talk much - didn’t even get his name - but we called him “Wilson”. We made plans to meet the shuttle driver at Neels Gap tomorrow. This is trail mile 31.3. We got a hotel reservation for that night to get showers, etc. We slept well and were fresh for the next day on the trail.","Hawk Mountain Shelter

Whitetop,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614618,"Got up around 6:30 AM for long day of hiking but with an end Point at a hotel. Woohoo!  We were on the trail by 7:45 so little better than previous days. Goal is to get to Neels Gap and spend a night in a hotel to shower and rest well. Today had LOTS of climbing. We were worn out after the day. One climb was up Blood Mountain which is the tallest peak on the AT in GA. It was a tough day for us but we did it. Saw a black snake on the trail this morning. Janet walked right by it about 18 inches away. I saw it move so it caught my attention. We have met several hikers who are on about the same plan as us so has been good to get to know them a little. OH, FL, TN, NC all represented - especially FL. We have about 38 miles to do in the next 3 days, so we are continuing to look at that to see if we can get that done. We have another room reserved then and we can’t cancel. So, we gotta get it done. We had a 15 mile day in there, but we are having second thoughts on that distance in a day. Tonight when we got to the hotel the first thing we did after getting our boots off was to order a pizza from the Dominoes across the street. It was fantastic!  Then we got the showers, sent some texts, talked to our sons on the phone, and got ready for bed. We will be picked up tomorrow at 7:15 for the short trip back to the trail. Can’t wait - haha.","Campsite beside trail - mile 19.8

Whitetop,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614718,"After a great night off the trail in a hotel, we were ready to get back at it. Well, that might be overstating it a little.  We had an ok breakfast at the hotel and met the shuttle driver at 7:15 for short trip back to the trail. Got started hiking about 8:00. Our plan was to do 10.9 miles today, but we have a 15 mile day coming up that we were not sure we wanted to try to do. So we wanted to do extra today if feeling good. Right away we were climbing and were up and down all day. However, it was flatter today than previous days, so extra miles were possible. In the very first hour, we heard noises from our left, and it was s pretty big bear cub coming down the tree making lots of noise and sending bark all over. He was about 50 yards from us. He ran away like shot out of a cannon. Was neat to see him. We actually made 13.4 miles today - our best yet. Got a good campsite on top of a mountain. Nobody else here so nice and quiet except for nature sounds - some of which can be scary in the middle of an otherwise quiet night. Still thinking about it, but tomorrow looks like another 13-ish miles.  Can't wait haha...","Neels Gap

Whitetop,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614939,"We started out around 8:00. Mornings have been nice - and then the work begins haha. Plan today was to reach Tray Mountain Shelter - 13.5 trail miles away!  We did a lot of miles yesterday so had confidence this was doable. The climbs in this section were very tough - much tougher than previous days primarily because they were longer and more of them.  We got to our destination around 7:10 PM. Long, tough day but we made it!  Hardest day yet!  Got a good tent site beside the Shelter, and then 2 other groups showed up. One was a youth group from Athens, GA, and the other was a family from Monroe, NC. Enjoyed talking to them all. You meet a lot of people on the trail, and all have been nice. This shelter is on top of the mountain and known to be windy. It sounded like a hurricane all night. Probably was in low 60’s - we were glad to be in the tent all closed up. The water source at this shelter is about a quarter mile descent to a spring. So, I had to trek down to get water and then back up carrying that water - not exactly room service, but we needed the water as we were bone dry by then.  While I was away, Janet had one of the youth stop by to chat.  He was probably 15 years old, and he did not want to be there. He had a bad ankle from a childhood injury, and it was difficult for him.  He apparently did not want to come on the trip, but sounded like his parents might have made him.  The youth pastor told me this was an annual trip for the youth in his church.  There were only about 10 of them on the trip.  Maybe this is a ""right of passage"" for the youth in the church.  Felt bad for this kid and hope he was able to finish ok.","Campsite at mile 44.7

Whitetop,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614941,"Got to hiking at 7:45 AM. Getting better at breaking camp, but could be faster. Didn’t really rush since we were only doing 11 miles today. After the last 2 days, that sounded easy. It wasn’t. Actually, nothing is easy on this trail. All sections have some flat trail, but they also have lots of ups and downs. Speaking of downs, today was the first day either of us had any pain that was getting in the way of progress. My right knee started hurting a lot on the downhill sections. I was fine on flat or uphill sections. I brought a patella strap (small brace for knee - which I brought for my other knee in which I’ve had tendinitis). So, I put that on and it helped some but was still painful. I hope a night of rest and some ibuprofen will help it be better tomorrow.   Janet has had some bursitis in her hip and has been going to physical therapy for it. Her hip is holding up just fine. Today’s climbs were as difficult as others we’ve had so it was another work day. We made arrangements to meet a shuttle at 4:30 to take us to Hiawassee for a night at Lake Chatuge Lodge. We got there around 4:05 and she got there early - 4:15. Lodge is a great place above the lake and has a BBQ joint next door. Yes!!  Had a great meal and sucked down about a gallon of sweet tea each. We are now within 16 miles of the car and our finish. We are debating whether to go for it tomorrow and stop in a hotel on way home. Or, we’ll split that mileage into 2 days. We are close - but not there yet.","Tray Mountain Shelter

Whitetop,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615095,"We met the shuttle driver at 6:30 AM for the short ride over to the trail.  We had requested 7:15 to give us some time to eat breakfast (which started at 6:30), but they could not accommodate us unless we went earlier.  Turned out the breakfast was ready early enough that we could eat and meet the shuttle on time.  This was a blessing to start earlier, though, because we decided that we would try to finish today - all 15.8 miles of it!  This would be the most miles we have done, but we have our trail legs now and plan to go for it.  If we have to stop short of that, that's ok.  That was the plan anyway.  We got started hiking at 7:00, and it was nice and cool like most mornings.  This section had a lot of ups and downs with some tough climbs along the way.  Generally, the trail was going up most of the day.  About 5 miles into our day, my right knee started hurting again.  Earlier it had given some pain on descents but otherwise was fine.  Now it was starting to hurt all the time - and was significant enough that I took ibuprofen a few times to try to take the edge off the pain.  The meds helped enough that I could keep going.  Well, actually you don't have much choice but to keep going because you are out in the middle of nowhere and the only way out is to walk out.  So, that's what I did, even if it was painful.  I'm sure I was a sight.  Had to adjust my walking a bit to avoid pain, and I was hoping I would not make something else hurt because of my funny walking.  Along the way, we stopped to get water at a spring, and we ran into two ladies from Orlando one of which was an Alabama fan.  Yes, I had my Clemson hat on, and she noticed.  She congratulated Clemson for the championship and said some nice things about us.  Her husband played on an Alabama championship team in the 70's.  We laughed that it could be dangerous wearing a Clemson hat through North Georgia with all the Georgia Bulldog fans around.  This section had a lot of maintenance going on.  There are a lot of boulders and rocks and timbers on the trail and I think they are mostly there to keep the trail from washing away when it rains.  It has to be terribly difficult work to move those rocks and timbers around with just manpower.  I think these folks are volunteers.  They do a good job.  Well, we persevered through a long day and arrived at the car at 5:55 PM, just short of 11 hours to finish the 15.8 miles.  We were so glad to be finished!  We were craving something other than water to drink - like a Powerade.  We decided it was early enough that we could drive home.  Janet was feeling good and wanted to drive, so off we went.  It was a long ride home, and we stopped along the way for some Powerades and some food.  We got home after 1 AM with me only being called on to drive less than 30 minutes from home.  Turned out the adventure was doable after all - we had our doubts at different times during the week.  Very thankful to be done.  As for how we held up, Janet has a few blisters on her feet and some bruises from the backpack.  I have the bad knee (still hurts but not as bad - got it checked out so I know what's going on and it appears to be something exercises can fix), and I have lots of insect bites that Janet didn't get for some reason.  We both sprayed, but she must have done it better.  Until next time...","Dicks Creek Gap
