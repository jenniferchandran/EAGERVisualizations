I flew from Key West, Florida to Lynchburg, Virginia with the intent of doing a short section hike on the Appalachian Trail. This would be a shake down hike to get off of the flat, sea level trail I was regularly hiking down here in the Florida Keys.  It would be a chance to use my gear and see what is working and what could be changed or improved. I have an old friend who lives near Lynchburg, Virginia. Charlie and I go back more than thirty years, having met when I first settled in California in the early 1980s and now, he was waiting for me when my flight arrived in Lynchburg at around 11:40pm. After a stop at a Walmart and a stop for something to eat it was close to 1 am when we arrived at Charlie’s house. It had been about six years since I last saw Charlie so we broke out a bottle of brandy and got talking until almost 4am.  Needless to say, I got up rather late and by the time Charlie got me to a trail head out near the Daleville/Troutville area it was late in the afternoon.
March 9, 2019. Bad Tent Site.
It was around 4pm when we pulled into a parking area just off the road. I got my pack on, took my trekking poles, and started in at trail mile 731.1 while thinking, “I can’t believe I am actually here, on the trail”. I didn’t have to go far before I saw my first White Blaze. It felt like a special moment. I had not been on the trail very long when it began to get dark so I pulled out my headlamp thinking that I had not really planned to do night hiking on my first day out, and then it started snowing. The trail was mostly uphill and I soon realized that all of my hiking on the flat ‘Overseas Highway Trail’ down in the Florida Keys had not prepared me for this. Later, the snow turned to rain and eventually I spotted what I thought was a good tent site, so I decided to make camp.
While getting my camp set up, I saw another headlamp coming up the trail. As he got closer I called out, saying “I thought I was the only fool out here tonight!”  He laughed saying, “Nope!”  He had started at the same place I had but didn’t get on the trail until 6pm and told me there was a shelter another mile or two up.  I thought about it for a second and decided I was almost done setting up so I would camp here.

Unfortunately, the site was on sloped ground and made for an uncomfortable night as my sleeping bag kept sliding to the end of the tent, which eventually pulled the tent slightly downhill and off of its plastic ground cloth.  It had rained all night. I had my tent set up under a tarp with my backpack outside the tent door but during the night a heavy gust of wind took half the tarp down which left the backpack exposed to the rain, as well as the tents footprint, which now collected water and funneled it under the tent so that by morning, I was wet, all of my gear was wet, the temperature was in the thirties and my finger tips were so cold it was hard to untie cords and get things packed properly.  Thankfully, one of the things I had bought at Walmart was a package of twenty hand warmers.  This added more than a pound to my pack weight but these little hand warmers were worth it.  Each morning I used two of them, shaking them, vigorously, to activate them. After a few minutes they begin producing a decent amount of heat and I found the best way for me to use them was to put them in the pockets of my down jacket. When ever my fingers got too cold I would just put my hands in the pockets and grab hold of the packs.  When I put my jacket in my back pack I would move the hand warmer packs to my pants pockets and found that hours later they were still producing heat.

As I was packing up my gear, the hiker from last night came down the trail and told me he had stayed at the shelter with two other guys but the wind was blowing the rain into the shelter so it had been a rough night.  He continued down the trail and I finished packing then decided I should make myself a cup of coffee.  While having my coffee, the other two hikers from the shelter came down the trail and we talked for a bit before they continued on down the hill. I got my pack on and headed up the hill arriving at the Fullhardt Knob shelter about 11am.  By then I was above the fog, the sun was shining, the wind had died down and the temperature was up. Although I had not hiked very far, I decided to stay at this shelter for the rest of the day and spend the night there.  I ran a rope between some trees and unpacked my gear, hanging some of it on the rope and spreading some things over the picnic table. During the afternoon a couple of different people stopped up at the shelter, mainly to use the privy, but one day hiker left me a whole roll of toilet paper, which was generous of him and made me wonder how many rolls he was carrying in his pack?  By about 4pm all of my gear was dry so I made my bed and started thinking about making dinner and coffee.  No more hikers came in and that night, I had the shelter to myself.

The following morning as I was having my oatmeal and coffee I noticed the shelter not only had rain gutters at the edges of the roof but the front gutter was connected to the back gutter with a length of downspout and the gutters were protected with screens over them. This made me curious so I walked around the back of the shelter and saw that the back gutter was piped into a cistern and a little ways down the hill from the shelter was a sign so I walked down and saw a small section of concrete wall set into the hillside with a faucet.  The sign said that all water used from this cistern should be treated.  I filled my dirty water bag and filtered enough water to fill both of my canteens and then treated it with the Aqua Mira solution. Whoever does the trail maintenance for this part of the trail deserves some recognition for this set up. I think more trail organizations should consider similar water collection systems for shelters that are not located near a convenient water source.

Maj.D.Saster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612806,"March 11.  Wilson Creek Shelter.

After packing up my gear and having breakfast, I was ready to get back on the trail. It was 6.2 miles to the next shelter which does not sound like much but I knew it was going to be a full day for me.  Down in the Florida Keys I could do 10.5 miles with a seventeen pound pack in about four and half hours, but that was on a flat, paved path which is used by walkers and bicycle riders alike.  The path runs along side the new Oversea Highway and passes over many bridges which were part of the old Overseas Highway and there are usually people fishing from the bridges.  Now I was in the mountains carrying at least double my normal pack weight and sometimes it seemed as though it was always uphill so my progress was slow and my daily mileage reduced.

I had not gone far when a hiker came up behind me.  He was a thru-hiker, having started at Springer Mountain in Georgia and went by the trail name, Villain.  He asked me if I had run into a couple of other thru-hikers named Feral and Zorro but I had not, though as the day progressed, I would encounter both of them.  I had not expected to run into thru-hikers this far North in the month of March but apparently, all three of them had started early and had done some hiking together off and on along the way. They obviously had gained their trail legs as they were making good time whereas I was slowly plodding along, making my way up the trail with frequent stops to catch my breath, let my heart rate slow down and drink some water from my canteen as these uphill switchbacks were really presenting a trial for me.

About midday, two more hikers caught up with me and we stopped for a short trail social.  This was Willie and Mule.  Willie was a regular section hiker and had brought his friend Mule along on this hike.  After talking for a bit they moved on and at first I thought I might be able to keep up with them but they gradually left me behind.  Oh well, I wasn’t out here to compete with anyone. I was out here to enjoy my hike and get some trail time at my own pace. 
This day would be a series of uphill switchbacks that took me up and over a series of ridges followed by steep downhill switchbacks into ravines where there were streams.  When I reached one of these streams I ran into Willie and Mule again. They had stopped to filter water and refill their bottles.  I decided to do the same as one of my canteens was almost empty so I stayed and replenished my water supply as they moved on.

It was getting late in the afternoon when I reached the last of three stream crossings and there was a sign saying, “SHELTER  0.7 MILES”.
  I thought to myself, no problem, I used to walk 0.9 miles from my place in New Hampshire to the Country Store just to sit on the porch and have a cup of coffee but this was seven tenths of steep, uphill and as it got towards evening, I started to wonder if I could make it.  At one point I just sat on the side of the trail and lay back with my pack on thinking I just didn't have the energy to continue, while at the same time telling myself I can't stay where I am so I have no choice, I needed to keep moving. As I wondered how much further that shelter was, I picked up the unmistakable smell of a wood fire and thought to myself, “I must be close to the shelter and I’d bet Willie and Mule are there!”
  
I picked myself up and after a few more yards, came to a bend in the trail and there was a sign with an arrow pointing to the left that said, SHELTER. Reaching the sign, I looked to the left and there was Willie and Mule sitting at a picnic table with a camp fire going.
As I came up the path to Wilson Creek Shelter, they turned and looked at me saying, “Hey… you made it!  How did you like that last 0.7 miles?”“Yes!” I said, “I made it! And that last 0.7 miles almost did me in. I was not sure if I was going to make it until I smelled your campfire.”
They later confided that they didn't think I would make it to the shelter as they had seen what looked like a good tent site at the last stream crossing and thought I might camp there.  I had seen that tent site but I was determined to make it to the shelter, so I was happy to prove them wrong.

I got out my food bag and started making my dinner and a cup of coffee.  Another young hiker, whose name I don’t recall, came up the trail and stopped to have dinner but he didn’t stay as he wanted to do some night hiking to get a few more miles done.  By this time I had figured out that I had way more weight in food than I needed so I gave him a bunch of food items, which he was happy to take.  As it got dark, Willie decided it was time to crawl into his hammock while Mule and I set up our beds at opposite ends of the shelter.
The next morning, Willie and Mule had breakfast and packed up their gear.  Before they left they walked down the hill to the creek to filter a supply of water.  Someone had left a couple of gallon jugs of water at the shelter, which were now empty, so they took one with them and filtered enough water to refill it and brought it back to the picnic table.  They left soon after that.

I took my time packing up my gear and decided to make an extra cup of coffee before getting back on the trail.  Before leaving, I tore a blank page from the shelter log book and wrote a note that I put under the water jug on the table to let other hikers know that this water has been filtered from the nearby creek and then I got on my way.

Maj.D.Saster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612828,"March 12.  Bedford.

Heading out from Wilson Creek Shelter I was enjoying the trail. The uphill hiking was still taking a toll on me but I would stop whenever I felt the need to take a rest and drink some water. I had an open pack of M&M peanuts in a pocket and would munch on a couple from time to time and then, after a few minutes, I'd continued on.

My cell phone battery was down to less than 10% and the two rechargeable power packs I'd brought along were both pretty dead too. Both of them were over ten years old and now I was thinking that I should have just bought something newer and better before starting this trip. On the other hand, this was exactly why I was on this trip, to find out what’s working and what isn’t!  As I’m hiking along and thinking about this I heard a sound that got my attention and saw a car go by.  There was a road just over a low rise from the trail and I then saw I was coming up to some kind of fire road with a gate across it. This was Black Horse Gap.  The car I’d seen was on the Blue Ridge Parkway. I walked over to the parkway and as I was standing there another vehicle went past and the people in the car waved.  Walking back to the gate there was a sign where the trail continued up into the woods that said it was 4.9 miles to the next shelter.  Looking at my watch and seeing what time it was I had some doubts as to whether I could make the next shelter before dark and thought I may want to keep an eye out for a tent site, or I could plan on doing some night hiking. I decided to go back to the parkway where I used a stick to prop my backpack up on the side of the road and hung out for a while as the occasional vehicle went by. I was thinking that there might be a town not too far away and if I could get a ride in I might be able to recharge my phone and get a hot meal. Just about the time I was debating if I should keep hanging out there or just get back on the trail, a car slowed down and stopped and the guy asked if I needed a ride. I told him that depended on what the closest town was. He said there was a lodge a few miles down and they would probably have everything I needed, a room, a restaurant and a store so I got in with my gear and we headed down the mountain.

His name was Charlie and he was from the town of Bedford.  We got to the lodge but they were closed and remodeling the rooms. It was going to be a while before they were ready to open for the season. Charlie mentioned there were motels in Bedford so I said “OK, let’s go.”  It did not take us long to reach Bedford and he stopped at the Days Inn.  Charlie came in while I was registering, he told them I was a trail hiker, adding that he had some errands to run in the morning but he might have time to pick me up and run me back up to the trail to which I told him that if he was willing to do that, I’d put gas in his car so he gave me his phone number and said to call him in the morning.

Charlie left and I went to my room, dropped my gear and flopped into a chair.  There was a menu for a nearby pizza place that would deliver and there was a gas station / store just down the street so I called for a food delivery and then walked to the store and got a six pack of beer.  Shortly after I returned to the room my food arrived.  I turned on the TV and after scanning the channels I found an old western movie, (I like westerns). After eating, I went and took a long, hot shower and then crawled into bed.

The next morning, I called Charlie and asked if ten o’clock would be convenient and he said he was thinking that he could come right now if I wanted to stop at the local Walmart so I packed up all my gear and was ready when he rolled up in front of my room.  I checked out and we went to the Walmart where I bought a new, Anker 20,000 mah power pack and some food. I also bought two gallons of spring water. Once in the car I plugged the new power pack in to start charging it.
On the way back to the trail we stopped at a small store run by a lady who Charlie seemed to know. She was cooking up some Salmon cakes so we had her make us a couple of sandwiches with them. I picked up the tab for the sandwiches and we got on our way.  Charlie drove me back to the Black Horse Gap road and parked the car, leaving the engine running to continue charging the new battery while we sat by the trail and ate our sandwiches. After we finished eating, we sat and talked for a while. Charlie seemed pretty familiar with the local trails and told me what I would be encountering and where the next shelter was. As Charlie got ready to take off I thanked him for all his help and gave him some money for gas. 
I set the two gallon jugs of water on a large flat rock next to the trail for any hikers that might come along.  I’d charged my phone while I was in the motel room and set it to airplane mode to conserve the battery.  My new power pack was about fifty percent charged and I was ready to move on. 
As nice as it was to spend a night in town, it was good to be back up on the trail.  It was getting on into the late afternoon when I finally came to a sign for Bobblets Gap Shelter that pointed off the side of the trail. I looked down where it was and thought, “Really?”.  There was a series of at least four switchbacks down a steep ravine and all I could think about was the hike back up in the morning.  Someone must have had a mean sense of humor to put this shelter where it was, but it was also where the creek was so I suppose it is what it is.
I got down to the shelter and knew that being at the bottom of this deep ravine means that once the sun sets it is going to get dark fast down here so I got my bed set up in the shelter.  I was thinking about food and debating as to whether or not I wanted to gather up wood to make a fire when I heard voices and looking up at the switchbacks I saw two women coming down.  Must be my lucky night!

My new shelter partners introduced themselves as Rabbit and Turtle, from Connecticut and like me, they were out here doing a section hike but whereas I was hiking North, they were heading South. I told them I was Maj.D.Saster and they said, “Hey, Willie and Mule said we might run into you!”
  
Suddenly, I felt mildly famous!  We all had dinner and I asked if anyone wanted coffee.  Turtle said she was making tea but Rabbit perked up and asked, “You have coffee?  Major, I’m in love with you!”
  
At that moment I was wishing it was true but I’m also old enough to be her grandfather.  With the coffee and tea made and the dinner dishes cleaned up, we sat at the picnic table and played a game of Yahzee as it got dark. After that, we were all ready for bed.

In the morning, we had our breakfasts and I treated Rabbit to another cup of coffee. After the girls left and headed back up to the trail, I packed my gear and made one more coffee for myself. I drank almost a whole quart of water and then filtered enough to refill the canteen and treated it. I wanted to be well hydrated and have a full water supply before I made that trek back up to the trail. My next stop would be Cove Mountain Shelter.

Maj.D.Saster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612832,"March 14.  Cove Mountain Shelter

Upon reaching the trail after ascending the switchbacks from Bobblets Gap Shelter, I reflected on Rabbit and Turtle heading South and wondered if they would stop at Wilson Creek Shelter, and if they did, will they read my entry in the shelter log book.  I’d been writing a paragraph or two in the log books at each shelter I’d stayed in and always took time to read back to see who had been there before me and what they had written.  In one shelter I found entries from Villain, Feral and Zorro so there is a feeling of connection where you can say, “Hey, I met those guys!”

Turning North, I headed up the trail and got my hiking day going.  As usual, there was a lot of uphill so my progress was slow but that didn’t matter to me as I knew I would reach the next shelter. I would go as much as I could and then rest for a few minutes and drink some water whenever I felt the need or if I came to a convenient place to sit without removing my pack.

Having come to just such a spot I was sitting there when I saw a woman coming down the trail towards me. Her trail name was Puddles and she was finishing a section she needed to do to complete a thru-hike.  She tells me she is from New Hampshire and I tell her, “Me Too!”, explaining that I moved to Key West a few years ago when I got a job opportunity that was too good to turn down.  She also mentioned that she had spent the night in a shelter with Willie and Mule so it is nice to know they are still on the move somewhere up ahead of me.

Puddles continued on her way. At least she had gravity working with her. I got off my butt and kept moving up the trail until I finally hit a section of downhill switchbacks that brought me to a road crossing. On the other side of the road there were some steps up into the woods from the road level. Next to that was a small trickle of water coming out of the woods and over the embankment. My Guthooks app said there were some tent sites a little ways in and that the Cove Mountain Shelter was 2.4 miles ahead.  I knew there was no water at Cove Mountain so like earlier in the morning, when I was preparing to depart Bobblets Gap, I decided to hydrate myself before leaving this water source. I took off my pack and drank all of the water in my one quart canteen and then filtered and treated a refill from the small stream flowing out of the woods. I figured I could make the 2.4 miles on the water I’d consumed and get to the shelter with a full water supply of three quarts to take care of my dinner and breakfast and then get me to the next water source tomorrow morning.

Along that last 2.4 miles, I reached an area of trail where I had a wide open view looking out into a valley with a ridge of mountains out to my left and I just had to stop and shoot some video. I also knew that somewhere out there was my next shelter, probably less than a mile away. As I continued along the trail I soon spotted the shelter ahead of me and when I got there I dropped my pack and looked around.  Cove Mountain was a typical three sided shelter with a picnic table.  There were two fire pits here and not far away was what looked like a new privy.  Not bad!

On the way here I had stopped while I was up on a ridge and switched my phone from airplane mode and received a bunch of text messages.  One was from my old friend Charlie, in Lynchburg.  He mentioned that the weather report showed thunderstorms coming my way and expected to hit between one and six PM the following day.  My Guthooks App showed a campground just a few miles ahead and I figured I could make it there by noon.  People had written good things about the campground in the shelter log books so I thought it might be worth staying there for a night. Grab a hot shower and some food and then get back on the trail in the morning.

No other hikers came along that night so I had Cove Mountain Shelter to myself. I sat with an after dinner cup of coffee while reading the shelter log and then wrote my own entries. I did not bother to build a fire and when it got dark, crawled into my sleeping bag and had a good nights sleep.

Maj.D.Saster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612948,"March 15 and 16.  Middle Creek Campground
 After my usual breakfast and coffee I left Cove Mountain Shelter with the intent of stopping at the Middle Creek campground.  The trail over the next couple of miles was mix of level, easy hiking with some uphill and downhill thrown in. Along the way I’d crossed a couple of small streams but there was no need to refill my water supply as I knew I had enough to get me to the campground.
By midday the trail was trending downhill and upon reaching a bend where there was a small stream, I stopped and took a short break. While I was sitting there another hiker came down the trail and stopped to refill his water bottle. His trail name was Twice and I think he was from Germany, his accent being heavy enough so that I had trouble understanding most of what he said. When I told him my name he mentioned that I was the one that left the note with the jug of water at Wilson Creek Shelter.  It was nice to hear that it proved to be of use to someone.  I told him to have a good hike and got on my way.

Eventually, the trail brought me down to a road near a river. There was a bridge to the right which crossed over Jennings Creek and the campground was in that direction so I started across the bridge but as I did so, I felt the first drops of rain.  Looking at my watch I saw it was almost one o’clock in the afternoon and I thought, “Wow, this rain is right on schedule.”
Those first drops quickly became a shower and as I reached the other side of the bridge I saw the trail entrance to continue North so I stopped there and sat on the embankment, under a tree as it rained.  The rain let up after about five minutes and then Twice came walking over. There was a sign that said the campground was about a thousand feet up the road and Twice said he was going there to get some food.  As he was leaving I saw him pull out a pack of cigarettes and light one up. I could not help but think how strange it seemed to me for a hiker to smoke cigarettes.  Hiking and cigarettes just did not seem to go together.

I finally got my pack on again and started up the road, which ran along the river. Parts of this river looked deep and the water flow look very strong. Back at the bridge there was a parking lot with several trucks in it and people down by the river fishing. Up ahead of me a few yards, there was a guy putting some fishing gear into a jeep and as I passed him we exchanged greetings. He asked if I was hiking the Appalachian Trail and I told him just a section hike for eleven days but right now I wanted to get to the campground up the road for some food and a hot shower.  He offered to give me a ride so I put my gear in the back of the Jeep and hopped in. We passed Twice on the way but unfortunately, there really was no more room in the Jeep to pick him up.  We arrived at the campground and talked about hiking for a bit and then he took off.
Middle Creek Campground is family owned and they are really nice people. They were not actually open but preparing to open for the season and everyone was busy working. Susan offered to rent me a cabin anyway and said she would have the kitchen open soon if I was hungry.  I took my gear to the cabin.  The first thing I did was plug in my phone, the power pack and the rechargeable inflator for my air mattress. After a little while I walked up to the campground store and Susan made me a Bacon Cheeseburger with fries that was outstanding!

Later on I went over to the Bathroom/Shower building and took a long, hot shower and then brought my laundry up to the micro Laundromat and washed my clothes.  Around dinnertime I went back to the store and ordered a couple of grilled cheese and tomato sandwiches with fries.  While I was talking to Susan, I said, “No offence intended, but as a former middle school custodian, your bathrooms really leave a lot to be desired.”

She said she had not checked them but they were all working to get ready to open for the season, and it was possible they had not been cleaned since the end of last season, adding that a lot of hunters come through there during the winter so the toilets probably get some off season use.

The following morning, when I went up to the store for breakfast, Susan said that besides the main bathroom and shower building, there were also Men’s and Women’s bathrooms and showers behind the store and that if I was willing to do the cleanup, she would trade me the rent on the cabin.  I agreed and she gave me the key to the store room and said to take a golf cart. 
I gave all of the bathrooms and showers a good cleaning and mopping had everything sanitized and shining but it took me until four o’clock that afternoon before I was finished so I stayed another night in the cabin. The following morning I packed my gear and went to the store to settle my tab but when I asked what I owed her, Susan said, “Just give me ten dollars.”  “Really?” I asked.  She said “Hey, We have a lot of work to get done before we open on April first and you cleaned my bathrooms. I appreciate that.”
One of her sons gave me a ride down to the trail head and I started hiking up the hill.  I knew the next shelter was only three and half miles away, but I had to go over and then down a two thousand foot mountain to get there.

Maj.D.Saster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613023,"March 17.  Bryant Ridge Shelter.
The trail from Jennings Creek started out as more uphill hiking but I was actually starting to get used to this.  When I started out eight days ago, I had to stop frequently to catch my breath and let my heart rate slow down but now I was going for much longer stretches between breaks.  I was slow, but definitely gaining stamina.  Too bad I only had eleven days up here as I do believe that if I had a few months then the gains and improvement would be significant, but that will have to wait another year or so.  
Overall, it was a fairly uneventful hiking day. Once I’d made it over the top there was a good stretch of relatively level trail that made hiking easy and I found myself thinking how staying in the campground for two nights  had been nice but it felt really good to be back in woods. After four years in the Florida Keys, I had not realized how much I missed this kind of environment.  I began hitting the downhill part of the mountain.  I think going down is actually more difficult than going up but eventually the trail leveled out and ran along side a creek until I reached the Bryant Ridge Shelter which sits up on a point of land where two creeks come together. Well, at least there was plenty of water!

Up till now, all of the shelters had been basic three sided structures but Bryant Ridge Shelter was a carpenter’s work of art. It had spacious platforms that could sleep a lot of folks and even a large upstairs loft with windows.  I liked this place!

When I first arrived there were swarms of bugs that acted like they had been waiting for me so I set about gathering up some dead wood, of which there was plenty laying around and soon got a nice fire going. It wasn’t a real smoky fire but put out just enough to clear away the bugs. I continued to collect dead wood from around the area and built up a decent wood pile near the fire pit and then set about getting my bed set up inside the shelter. After that I fixed myself some dinner and my customary cup of coffee.

Sitting there watching the fire I decided I’d best use what daylight I had left to make some repairs on my backpack. One of the shoulder strap pads had popped a seam and one end of the chest strap that goes across between the shoulder straps had come loose. It didn’t take long for me to sew up the seam and then stitch the chest strap onto the shoulder strap.  I decided to put some stitching into the other end of the chest strap as a precaution against that side coming apart.

With my chores done I put some more wood on the fire and stayed up after dark, later than I had on any night since starting this journey. I kept half expecting other hikers to show up but once again, I had the shelter to myself.  At least tonight, I had a good woodpile and a fire so I could sit and watch “Hikers TV”.

It was eight o’clock and I was starting to feel tired, also the temperature was dropping so I let the fire die down to coals and called it a night.

It was only 4.9 miles from Bryant Ridge Shelter to Cornelius Creek Shelter, but like the day before, I had to go over a mountain to get here, except this one was thirty-five hundred feet.  It was a strenuous if not quiet day of hiking as I did not see another hiker along the trail and I was starting to feel a little introspective about what I had learned from this hike.  I knew tonight would be my last night on the trail and sometime tomorrow Charlie would drive up from Lynchburg to extract me.  Technically, I could spend another night on the trail but Charlie was an old friend from years back and sad to say, my circle of old friends was getting smaller over the last couple of years so I was looking forward to having a couple of days to hang out at Charlie’s house before flying back to Key West.

Since it was not a long distance from Bryant Creek Shelter to Cornelius Creek Shelter I took my time hiking, taking breaks and sitting for a while, having a bite out of a Snickers bar or checking my phone and exchanging text messages with friends and family.  My tax guy in Vermont called me and I said he had good timing.  When he asked why, I told him it was because I happened to have my phone active and was sitting on top of a mountain ridge on the Appalachian Trail in Virginia, at a spot where I had a fair signal. He thought that was just the coolest thing!

I reached Cornelius Creek Shelter around four o’clock in the afternoon.  Someone had left a fair pile of fire wood but I walked around gathering up some more so that I would have enough to enjoy a fire as long as I felt like staying up. I had assumed I would be here by myself and also I had received a weather update from Charlie saying that tonight would be clear but the temperature was expected to drop into the twenties.

I got my bed set up in the shelter and sat at the picnic table where I had my dinner.  After cleaning up I made a cup of coffee and was putting some more wood on the fire when I heard voices and realized I was about to have company!

Three hikers came up the short approach path to the shelter and the first thing they said was, “Oh… thank god you have a fire going!”

I cannot remember the names of these gentlemen but two were a little younger than me and one was older.  We were all over sixty so I called us the ‘Over 60 Club’.  Like me, they were doing a section hike and all somewhat out of shape but they all seemed to have great attitudes.  They all set up tents near the edge of the clearing around the shelter and then made their dinners and since I had all this unexpected company, I made up an extra cup of coffee for myself and we kept putting wood on the fire.

One of the guys asked me how I liked that last stretch of trail coming up the mountain to this shelter and I told him the up hill climbs had been a tough enough and I was glad when the trail leveled off for a while but then I came to that last few hundred feet of elevation and saw that the trail just continued straight on up the mountain as though the people who blazed the original trail got tired of making switchbacks and said, “The hell with it, lets just go straight up!”  That was tough.
We all sat around talking for a while but the temperature was dropping and everyone soon decided it was bedtime.

The guys had left their water bottles and filters outside so in the morning, everything was frozen into solid blocks of ice.

My dirty water bag was hanging outside and that was frozen too but I had my canteens in my sleeping bag so I had water in the morning.  One of the guys went to the creek and filled his cook pot. After heating it up, he was dipping his water filter into it to try and thaw it out so I told him the filter is no good now. If you let those filters freeze up you need to replace them.  They all looked like, “uh-oh”

It took a while before the Sun came up over the surrounding ridge but once it did, I placed a large, one gallon zip lock baggie over my frozen dirty water bag to serve as a small green house, now that we had direct sunlight. I was surprised at how fast that sold block of ice melted.  The greenhouse baggie idea worked better than I expected!

I stoked the fire back up from some coals that were still in the pit and they got their gear all packed up and headed back onto the trail.  A little while later, I packed all my gear and started out to do my final miles.  I had planned on going through The Guillotine today but a few miles up the trail I came to a gravel road and a sign pointing to the right that said, BLUE RIDGE PARKWAY, 0.3 MILES so I called Charlie and told him I will be on the Parkway in a matter of minutes and he said he would start on his way.  The road brought me up to a scenic overlook called Sunset Field. When I got there I dropped my pack and relaxed in the sun for about an hour until Charlie rolled in with his truck. With my gear in the back, we were on our way to Charlie’s house and by early evening I’d had a hot shower and shave, my laundry was in the washer, we had steak for dinner and I was kicked back with a glass of whiskey. Though I didn’t get to go through The Guillotine, I was already making plans to come back and do this again next year.

Maj.D.Saster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613061,"What did I get from this experience?
Because of my past experience with airlines, I shipped all of my gear up to Charlie’s place via UPS a week before I flew to Virginia and shipped it back to myself before returning to Key West.  I took nothing on the plane except my carry-on pack.
Once I had my gear back at home I was able to go through it and weigh a lot of items that were last minute add-ons as well as items that got added in after I arrived in Virginia, such as the package of twenty hand warmers, which came to one and a half pounds.  It would be easy to say this was just extra weight but considering the winter temperatures I was dealing with, I think the hand warmers were as important as my fleece lined thermal underwear, which I only used at night. The hand warmers were also a decreasing weight as I used two of them each morning and back at Bobblets Gap Shelter I had given two of them to Rabbit when her hands were cold in the morning.

After my first night on the trail I was thinking I should get rid of the inflatable sleeping pad and go to a foam pad but once I was using my inflatable pad on a flat, level surface, such as the floor of a shelter then I had no problem with it so I changed my mind and decided to stay with my inflatable.
I have since figured out that on my first day on the trail, my pack weight was a bit over forty pounds, including food and water. I need to get that down as close as I can to thirty.

In addition to my wool cap, which I slept in at night, I had three other hats, which I didn’t really need.
-Squadron hat from work, which I was wearing when Charlie drove me to the trail. If I had thought about it I would have left it at the house.

-Winter Army cap which I wore on most hiking days. Comfortable and keeps my head warm, also has fold down ear covers if needed. I like these hats and have been wearing them for years.  When my old one was literally falling apart I found a new one on EBay.

-Hat with sun shade on back to protect my neck from getting sunburned. I often wear this hat for hiking in the Keys as I can give it a spray of Deep Woods Off and it keeps the bugs away from my neck but bugs were not an issue in March so I could have left this at home.
-Wool cap, which I got mainly for sleeping in.
 The winter army hat and my wool cap would have been sufficient for this trip. 
I have a pair of fleece lined, soft leather gloves that I not only wore for hiking but for sleeping as well. I also had a pair of insulated ski gloves, which I never used. Next time I will leave them home.
I had three pairs of Darn Tough, Merino Wool hiking socks and three pairs of Injinji, sock liners, the kind with the toes, one pair of each on my feet and two in the pack. I know some hikers say two is enough, wear one pair wash the others but I think I will stick to my three.
My hiking shirt is a Columbia PFG, (Performance Fishing Gear).  This is a great shirt, and every bit as comfortable as my REI convertible hiking pants. Both articles are fast drying and so light weight it’s almost like not wearing them at all.
I have an insulated vest which I bought years ago in New Hampshire. I've not used it since moving to Key West but on the day of my flight to Virginia I stuffed it into my carry-on bag, knowing I was flying up to winter conditions so I thought it might be good to have something to wear when I get there. It was not intended to be part of my hiking gear but I was wearing it when Charlie drove me to the trail and I put my pack on over it so it ended up going with me. When I got home I weighed it and found it is 1.5 pounds but as it turned out, it was an extremely useful article of hiking clothing and I wore it a lot.
When I started my hike, my food bag weighed eight pounds, (1.2 lbs of that is my cooking kit). During my first couple of days on the trail I realized I was packing too much weight in food. I was not as hungry as I thought I would be and actually gave some food away. When I met Willie and Mule, Willie said that he has been coming up here to hike for a long time and packing too much food is the most common mistake he sees people make.  Middle Creek Campground had a good selection of Mountain House brand dehydrated meals, which I had read about, so I bought one to give it a try.  It was a little pricey but it was two servings that only weighed 4.6 ounces so it provided me with dinner for two nights. I’ve since been on the Mountain House website and found that one can order directly from them at lower prices. The dinner I bought was good and it made me realize that I could make a significant reduction in weight by making use of dehydrated food.
Also, I have two canteens, a one quart which I use as my working water supply while I am hiking and a two quart size on the back of my pack, which is useful when coming into a shelter where you know before hand that there is no water, but there tends to be a lot of water sources along the AT, at least in March on the section I was hiking, so I realized that most of the time, I could leave the large canteen empty and that would drop four pounds right there.
Once I had my gear at home again I started checking the individual weight of each item that was in my pack, and have determined that by eliminating a few redundant items, making use of more dehydrated foods and by carrying less water, I can reduce my total pack weight by a little over nine pounds.  That gets me to within a few ounces of thirty pounds.  Also, I am taking into consideration that due to the time of year and winter temperatures I need my winter gear, but once the weather breaks and it gets warmer, my thermals and other winter gear can be shipped home, at which point I should see my total pack weight drop below thirty pounds.
My backpack itself does not seem to be up to the job. The fact that I had to get out my sewing kit twice to make repairs during an eleven day hike leaves me with little confidence that this pack would hold up for the one hundred and eighty days or more of a thru-hike.  Next time I make a weekend trip up to the mainland I will be hitting the outdoor supply stores to look at backpacks.
Replacing my power packs with a new Anker Powercore, 20,000mAh battery worked well for me and could keep my on the trail for days without the need for a recharge. I have been impressed by how many times I can recharge my phone from it.
I shot a bunch of videos using my iPhone 8+ and posted them to my YouTube channel, (Maj.D.Saster Hikes).  They are all about three minutes or less, mainly because I was afraid of running out of memory but after I got home I was checking my phone settings and found that in spite of all the videos and photos in my phone, I still have 240 gigabytes available.  Now that I know this, I'll keep it in mind for next time, rather than keep the videos down to three minutes or less I can plan on doing ten to fifteen minutes at a time.
I have had some feedback from folks who said their favorite videos were the ones where I am just hiking and talking while filming the trail ahead so I will focus more on that approach.  I am the same way when I watch other people’s videos. I prefer to see more of the trail and less selfie. Too many hikers put their camera on a selfie stick and then just film themselves hiking and babbling away at the camera while the only trail we get to see is what is receding behind them. I am not going to watch a two thousand mile selfie so I tend to stop following folks who film that way.

I think that come next year, when I do this again, I will be prepared to stay on the trail longer and make more miles.

",What I got from my Section Hike,"May 10, Fri",0
Maj.D.Saster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623938,"In 1979 I loaded my backpack, took my dog and left Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  Originally, my intent was to go to Arizona. In the 1970s, there was a huge construction boom going on there and because I was working as a roofer and framer, I wanted to go someplace where I could work year-round as opposed to taking any old job to get through the winter.
I picked up a couple of weeks of roofing work in a little city called Brush, Colorado and upon leaving there, we headed north instead of south, traveling up through Wyoming and into Montana, taking some time to visit the Custer battlefield, which was a place I’d always wanted to see.  We passed through Great Falls and then went on through Helena stopping in a camp ground at the top of McDonald’s Pass, on the Continental Divide, outside of Helena. After a couple of weeks in the campground we moved on to Missoula where we stayed and camped down by a river for a few days. From there we traveled across Idaho and into Washington where we picked up some work at a Perkin’s restaurant, just off of I-80 in a little town called Ritzville, which is west of Spokane.
Later we reunited with old friends from my home town who were living in Seattle. While there I picked up some work with a housepainter. After leaving Seattle, we traveled down the west coast through Oregon and into California, where I stayed with more hometown friends who were living in the San Francisco - Oakland Bay Area. I stayed there though the holidays and had been picking up temporary jobs through a work center at a local college until after the new year when I left and continued down the coast until I arrived near Santa Cruz, California. We got dropped off in Capitola Village, by Monterey Bay and ended up living in the area for the next twenty-five years.
My dog passed from old age in 1986 and I often thought about the adventure of our five and half month journey across the country, telling myself I needed to do something like that again. Whenever I’d go out into my garage, I would see my old backpack hanging on the wall and feel bad that I’d never used it again.
In the 1990s I started reading articles about the Pacific Crest Trail and entertained the idea of visiting the PCT for a few days to do some hiking and camping but there never seemed to be time for it. Over the years I drifted in and out of several relationships and eventually got married to the woman I thought I would be with for the rest of my life. Sadly, that ended in divorce. After that I left the west coast and returned to New England and after several years of struggling to get by, I got an opportunity for a new job in Key West, Florida.
I kind of got the “bum’s rush” to get down there to start the new job so I took almost everything I owned and put it into storage, in New Hampshire. With this new job, I soon saw that I could have an opportunity to retire and knew that I would eventually have to go back to New Hampshire to clear out that storage unit. One night, after watching a National Geographic documentary about the Appalachian Trail, I began to think about returning to New England by hiking the trail after I retired.
Here in the lower Florida Keys, there is a path for hiking or bicycle riding that runs alongside the Overseas Highway and I began getting up early, (before sunrise) to hike it. Hiking early in the morning was my way of avoiding the oppressive heat of the Keys, though I found making evening hikes when I got home from work was also good for me.
I accumulated the gear I was going to need and in March of 2019 I flew up to Lynchburg, Virginia where an old friend picked me up at the airport. The next day, he drove me to a trail head where I got on the Appalachian Trail for eleven days. The experience gained from that trip led to me making a number of equipment changes.
Part of my desire to thru-hike the trail is nostalgia, based on the cross-country journey that I made with my dog forty years ago and knowing how much that journey changed my life, not just physically, but mentally too.  Another part is knowing that I am now sixty-seven years old and struggling to keep my weight under control, but I know that when I am on the trail, it will change my physical condition, just like it did back in 1979 and by the time I reach Maine, I will be back to my ‘High-school’ weight and feel more physically fit than I have in years. It will force important changes that will benefit me at a critical time in my older years.
It is now October of 2019 with 15 months until my planned retirement and I am more determined than ever to do the entire trail in 2021.

Maj.D.Saster,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/631867,"It is the final weeks of 2020 and I have had to modify my plans.  I had originally planned to retire at the end of this year but things don’t always work out the way we think they will.  First, this danged virus, pandemic thing throws everyone’s plans all catawampus and then, due to an upward change in my income, I had to consider that it might be financially worth it to stay on my current job for a few months longer than I had originally intended.

I had also speculated that next year, there would not only be the class of thru-hikers who had been preparing for a 2021 hike during the last couple of years but there might also be a significant number of hikers who had been forced to cut their 2020 thru-hikes short, due to the Covid-19 virus. If that happens, then 2021 might be a very busy year on the AT.

Finally, in considering some of my retirement plans, I had been thinking about my motorcycle. I have a 2017 Kawasaki Vulcan 900 that I really like, but a cruiser would not be my first choice to use for long distance travel. I wanted to keep the cruiser for tooling around town but decided I also needed a touring bike for cross-country travel, and after looking around, I found a used, low mileage 2013 Goldwing F6B at a price I could not turn down. Soon after purchasing this bike, I realized it would take me until the end of next year to pay it off, so I guess I am committed to working here through December of 2021 as I do not want to go into my retirement with those pesky monthly payments hanging over me.

Perhaps it is for the better since, with luck, there might be a viable Covid-19 vaccine by then and not only that, but if I hike the AT in 2022, then that means I will have my seventieth birthday somewhere along the trail. How cool is that?
