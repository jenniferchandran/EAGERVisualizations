Hiking With Hum
Ten Years of Brothers Ho & Hum Hiking Together
 
Introduction
 
My brother Hum (Bob Ash, trail name “Hum”) and I (Jerry Ash, trail name “Ho”) identify ourselves on the trail as “Geezer Hikers Ho & Hum”, because we are just that: geezers and quite Ho-Hum.  Over the 10-year period of hiking together my geezerly age goes from 67 to 77 and Hum’s from 69 to 79.  Here I present our 10 annual hiking journals, from 2009 to 2019, first on Vermont’s Long Trail (LT) and then on the Appalachian Trail (AT).   Our daring and challenging exploits, especially for geezers, represent a grand total of over 1000 miles of hiking or 100 miles every year, over four million steps or 400,000 steps every year, and over 220 thousand feet of climbing or two Mt. Everest’s every year.
 
This is a story of brotherly banter, sharing, bonding, and boisterous guffawing that broke the silence of the trails we hiked.  A major focal point is on my lovable brother Hum, whose unique personality, gigantic laugh, wonderful sense of humor, and boundless eccentricities provide ample fodder for me to illustrate these traits with little vignettes arising from our hiking.  Hum sometimes retaliates, but as the author I have more control and take unfair advantage of my opportunity to make lite of my brother Hum.
 
Few brothers have done what we did and created such a lasting bond.  We went from backpacking novices to seasoned experts.  We handled a huge number of daily problems, climbed never ending mountains, and survived countless rain storms.  We are thankful to the people who built the AT and many shelters we slept in, to “AWOL” for writing the excellent guidebook we always used, and for having GPS to find remote parking lots and trailheads.
 
A second focal point is on savoring the company of diverse, interesting, and friendly people we meet along the way.  We will never forget the vivid interactions with the whole gang of fellow hikers for their priceless individuality.  Hum especially enjoys meeting other hikers on the trail and engaging in his abundant and very entertaining storytelling.  It is the best part of hiking according to Hum and I mostly agree with him on that except for my golden opportunity to engage in major brotherly kidding.
 
We meet so many interesting hikers with unique trail names and a story to go with every one of them. We share stories of Windtalker, Mom, Downhill, Laser Legs, Zhivago, Funk, Cool Shoes, Zephyr, Runner, Bleemus, Canadian Geese, Ottawa Lou, PoiBoy, Black Eagle, Nips & Shoop, and so many others we tell about.  Windtalker, for example, is an accomplished musician who plays his Native American Flute each night at sunset, making sounds that are like heaven in the wilderness - haunting music, mountains, stars, and all that silence.  Nips & Shoop are young sisters who write in one shelter journal that “[we] like to parade around with [our] shirt off, [and] ‘roam the forests’ in the altogether!  No one was around so we discarded our human forms and allowed our true woodland goddess spirits to roam the forests and waterfalls for some time.  Man it feels good to be naked.”  Cool Shoes is a very outgoing, middle age black woman, with an infectious and explosive laugh that rivals Hum’s trademark explosive laugh.  She tells a story about meeting up with Warren Doyle, an AT legend who has hiked the AT 10 times or more, and speaks of him a little irreverently.  She says that when he saw her on the trail he just looked strangely at her, as if, she interprets, “he had never seen a lone black woman hiking the AT”, she says with her trademark booming laugh.
 
A final focal point is on the learning drawn from the trail.  In the silences there is lots of time to think and reflect and for the mind to wander all over the place, somewhat like prayer, of loved ones, life’s blessings, the better person I want to be, and unbounded thanks for the love in my life. These thoughts are time-shared and intermingled with the constant mental gyrations of planning next steps, and together they are like parallel paths --spiritual and physical paths – being traced out together through the wilderness.  I do much thinking about a book I am writing about questions such as “who am I” and along the way I have a powerful spiritual experience where I encounter “KE-GOD” and understand how KE-GOD talks to me through the “Sea-of-Glory”.  Hum does much thinking about the clever new services he invents, which not only benefit us but many other hikers we meet on the trail and all of humanity for that matter.
 
Highly personal events enter this saga.  On February 4, 2015 Hum’s wife Pat dies tragically after suffering a terrible accident.  And then on May 3, 2019 my son Stephen succumbs in only three short months to an extremely aggressive brain cancer.  Hiking together helps us both face the terrible tragic loss and immense never-ending pain with mutual loving support.
 
Of course I already knew that Hum has a unique personality, a huge guffaw for a laugh, and so much else over the 60+ years of our being brothers.  But I learn a lot of new things about my brother that I did not already know.  Like how great he is at navigation, how completely he thinks things through before deciding anything, how completely honest he is with himself and others, and how Hum’s storytelling is one of his strengths.  I learn from hearing countless Humberto stories that there is a certain “Humberto style”.  Hum usually knows what he is talking about but sometimes he does not: in those cases he resorts to “Humberto pronouncements” to fill in the gaps. 
 
I learn about the highly prized “Humberto Services” that he demonstrates so proudly and skillfully on our hikes:
 
Humberto’s ETA service: Humberto declares well in advance the exact time that we will arrive at our destination.  This is always accurate to within plus or minus one microsecond.  No one knows how Hum does it.Humberto’s warning service: Humberto warns other hikers we meet of all the hazards they will encounter in the next few miles on the trail: impassable mud pit ahead; dense fog ahead with zero visibility; very aggressive white-faced hornets ahead; 3000’ straight-up climb ahead; impassable downed tree ahead; and other perhaps near-fatal hazards.  One pair of hikers who we encountered several times and received several Humberto warnings finally said “you always give us bad news!”Humberto’s charm service: Upon meeting a young, pretty hiker who is hiking alone, Humberto turns on the maximum charm, demonstrating how debonair Humberto is and how handsome Humberto is and what a wonderful conversationalist Humberto is.  This usually delays our hike at least 30 minutes and perhaps more than one hour.Humberto’s wisdom service: If Humberto hears any question, any question at all, or some problem needing a solution, Humberto immediately provides a complete and 100% correct answer.  Sometimes Hum shares his vast knowledge unprompted on virtually any topic, at length, leaving out no details or important facts.  After such valuable learnings, one can only say as brother Ray often does “Humberto has spoken, so be it!”  No one knows where Hum obtained this seemingly infinite store of knowledge, but luckily Humberto is willing to freely and generously share his knowledge with me and all the other hikers we meet.
 
Quite seriously, Hum’s knowledge and wisdom, sense of humor, good nature, and booming laugh are joys to behold.  I have treasured these joys my whole life.  My brother is kind, honest, friendly, and joking.  Much like our father, Hum is a “generous cheapskate” in that he is extremely careful and conservative with spending his money but when he does spend his money the sky is the limit.  That’s my wonderful brother Hum.
 
Our hikes together have been one of the most memorable and exciting and rewarding parts of my life, all thanks to my Big Brother Hum.  Our final hike together -- 13.4 miles over very rugged North Carolina terrain with 3500’ of mountains to climb -- encapsulates the whole of our 10-year journey together.  We both felt triumphant at that final hiking achievement and in fact became a metaphor for our whole time hiking together.
  I am glad to celebrate these wonderful years of Ho & Hum together and pray that in the years to come we will continue to share the love, laughter, and brotherly-uniqueness that we have so enjoyed.  ",,View Entry,"Sep 10, Tue",0

My brother Hum (Bob Ash, trail name “Hum”) and I (Jerry Ash, trail name “Ho”) identify ourselves on the trail as “Geezer Hikers Ho & Hum”, because we are just that: geezers and quite Ho-Hum.  Over the 10-year period of hiking together my geezerly age goes from 67 to 77 and Hum’s from 69 to 79.  Here I present our 10 annual hiking journals, from 2009 to 2019, first on Vermont’s Long Trail (LT) and then on the Appalachian Trail (AT).   Our daring and challenging exploits, especially for geezers, represent a grand total of over 1000 miles of hiking or 100 miles every year, over four million steps or 400,000 steps every year, and over 220 thousand feet of climbing or two Mt.

Few brothers have done what we did and created such a lasting bond.  We went from backpacking novices to seasoned experts.  We handled a huge number of daily problems, climbed never ending mountains, and survived countless rain storms.  We are thankful to the people who built the AT and many shelters we slept in, to “AWOL” for writing the excellent guidebook we always used, and for having GPS to find remote parking lots and trailheads.

 

A second focal point is on savoring the company of diverse, interesting, and friendly people we meet along the way.  We will never forget the vivid interactions with the whole gang of fellow hikers for their priceless individuality.  Hum especially enjoys meeting other hikers on the trail and engaging in his abundant and very entertaining storytelling.  It is the best part of hiking according to Hum and I mostly agree with him on that except for my golden opportunity to engage in major brotherly kidding.

 

We meet so many interesting hikers with unique trail names and a story to go with every one of them. We share stories of Windtalker, Mom, Downhill, Laser Legs, Zhivago, Funk, Cool Shoes, Zephyr, Runner, Bleemus, Canadian Geese, Ottawa Lou, PoiBoy, Black Eagle, Nips & Shoop, and so many others we tell about.  Windtalker, for example, is an accomplished musician who plays his Native American Flute each night at sunset, making sounds that are like heaven in the wilderness - haunting music, mountains, stars, and all that silence.  Nips & Shoop are young sisters who write in one shelter journal that “[we] like to parade around with [our] shirt off, [and] ‘roam the forests’ in the altogether!  No one was around so we discarded our human forms and allowed our true woodland goddess spirits to roam the forests and waterfalls for some time.  Man it feels good to be naked.”  Cool Shoes is a very outgoing, middle age black woman, with an infectious and explosive laugh that rivals Hum’s trademark explosive laugh.  She tells a story about meeting up with Warren Doyle, an AT legend who has hiked the AT 10 times or more, and speaks of him a little irreverently.  She says that when he saw her on the trail he just looked strangely at her, as if, she interprets, “he had never seen a lone black woman hiking the AT”, she says with her trademark booming laugh.

 

A final focal point is on the learning drawn from the trail.  In the silences there is lots of time to think and reflect and for the mind to wander all over the place, somewhat like prayer, of loved ones, life’s blessings, the better person I want to be, and unbounded thanks for the love in my life. These thoughts are time-shared and intermingled with the constant mental gyrations of planning next steps, and together they are like parallel paths --spiritual and physical paths – being traced out together through the wilderness.  I do much thinking about a book I am writing about questions such as “who am I” and along the way I have a powerful spiritual experience where I encounter “KE-GOD” and understand how KE-GOD talks to me through the “Sea-of-Glory”.  Hum does much thinking about the clever new services he invents, which not only benefit us but many other hikers we meet on the trail and all of humanity for that matter.

 

Highly personal events enter this saga.  On February 4, 2015 Hum’s wife Pat dies tragically after suffering a terrible accident.  And then on May 3, 2019 my son Stephen succumbs in only three short months to an extremely aggressive brain cancer.  Hiking together helps us both face the terrible tragic loss and immense never-ending pain with mutual loving support.

 

Of course I already knew that Hum has a unique personality, a huge guffaw for a laugh, and so much else over the 60+ years of our being brothers.  But I learn a lot of new things about my brother that I did not already know.  Like how great he is at navigation, how completely he thinks things through before deciding anything, how completely honest he is with himself and others, and how Hum’s storytelling is one of his strengths.  I learn from hearing countless Humberto stories that there is a certain “Humberto style”.  Hum usually knows what he is talking about but sometimes he does not: in those cases he resorts to “Humberto pronouncements” to fill in the gaps.  
 

I learn about the highly prized “Humberto Services” that he demonstrates so proudly and skillfully on our hikes:

 

Humberto’s ETA service: Humberto declares well in advance the exact time that we will arrive at our destination.  This is always accurate to within plus or minus one microsecond.  No one knows how Hum does it.
Humberto’s warning service: Humberto warns other hikers we meet of all the hazards they will encounter in the next few miles on the trail: impassable mud pit ahead; dense fog ahead with zero visibility; very aggressive white-faced hornets ahead; 3000’ straight-up climb ahead; impassable downed tree ahead; and other perhaps near-fatal hazards.  One pair of hikers who we encountered several times and received several Humberto warnings finally said “you always give us bad news!”
Humberto’s charm service: Upon meeting a young, pretty hiker who is hiking alone, Humberto turns on the maximum charm, demonstrating how debonair Humberto is and how handsome Humberto is and what a wonderful conversationalist Humberto is.  This usually delays our hike at least 30 minutes and perhaps more than one hour.
Humberto’s wisdom service: If Humberto hears any question, any question at all, or some problem needing a solution, Humberto immediately provides a complete and 100% correct answer.  Sometimes Hum shares his vast knowledge unprompted on virtually any topic, at length, leaving out no details or important facts.  After such valuable learnings, one can only say as brother Ray often does “Humberto has spoken, so be it!”  No one knows where Hum obtained this seemingly infinite store of knowledge, but luckily Humberto is willing to freely and generously share his knowledge with me and all the other hikers we meet.

 

Quite seriously, Hum’s knowledge and wisdom, sense of humor, good nature, and booming laugh are joys to behold.  I have treasured these joys my whole life.  My brother is kind, honest, friendly, and joking.  Much like our father, Hum is a “generous cheapskate” in that he is extremely careful and conservative with spending his money but when he does spend his money the sky is the limit.  That’s my wonderful brother Hum.

 

Our hikes together have been one of the most memorable and exciting and rewarding parts of my life, all thanks to my Big Brother Hum.  Our final hike together -- 13.4 miles over very rugged North Carolina terrain with 3500’ of mountains to climb -- encapsulates the whole of our 10-year journey together.  We both felt triumphant at that final hiking achievement and in fact became a metaphor for our whole time hiking together.

 
I am glad to celebrate these wonderful years of Ho & Hum together and pray that in the years to come we will continue to share the love, laughter, and brotherly-uniqueness that we have so enjoyed.  ","Stecoah Gap/NC 143

My brother Hum (Bob Ash, trail name “Hum”) and I (Jerry Ash, trail name “Ho”) identify ourselves as “Geezer Hikers Ho & Hum”, because we are just that: geezers and quite Ho-Hum. Over the 10-year period of hiking together my geezerly age goes from 67 to 77 and Hum’s from 69 to 79. Here I present 10 annual hiking journals, from 2009 to 2019, of our Section Hikes on both the AT and Vermont’s Long Trail (LT). This compendium of hiking journals is entitled “Hiking With Hum -- Ten Years of Brothers Ho & Hum Hiking Together” and is found at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KB5...xQivsJrfm/view.

Summary statistics for the 10 years of hiking:

Total Miles: 1043.2 miles + 4.4 road walks

Total Elevation Gain/Loss: 220,808’/261,579 + 0’/200’ road walks

Total Steps: 4,147,527 + 10,084 (road walks)

 

This compendium of hiking journals entitled “Hiking With Hum” tells the story of how two brothers, hiking together for 10 years, so enjoy their time together spent in endless conversations on an endless range of topics with very wise philosophic musings.  It tells about our brotherly debates and disagreements, our exchange of brotherly banter and small insults, and our attaining endless rewards derived from our positive mutual reinforcement, combined wisdom, and laughter arising from our wonderful sense of humor (of course).  It highlights the benefits derived from spectacular Humberto services and ingenious solutions, not to mention Hum’s answers to the most challenging and hardest problems known to man, are beyond priceless.  
 

Over the 10-year period Hum and I both age through our 70’s and eighth decade, and we both suffer incalculable losses and grief.  Hum lost his wife Pat in 2015 and I lost my son Stephen in 2019.  Hiking together and the brotherly love we shared somehow provides us both with some solace from these tragedies.

 

During the 10-year period both Ho and Hum make major life changes.  Hum finally sells his house in Timonium, MD and moves into a Senior Living Facility nearby in Towson, MD.  Hum has several close friends who already live in the same facility, so that helps ease the transition.  Lynsie and I move from North Clarendon, VT, to a smaller house in Palm Coast, FL, set beautifully on a lake in a large conservation area.

 

It has taken several more years than I hoped to complete the 2018 and 2019 journals and then this compendium Hiking With Hum.  Three to four years more in fact.  This is because I became very distracted, especially after 2017, by writing my book IAM 70 GOING ON ∞ published in April 2021.  I start to write that book in 2012 on the occasion of my 70th birthday, which is just a bare two years into the 10 years of Ho & Hum’s hiking exploits.  As I have noted in two of the journals, both in 2018 and again in 2019, I have a major spiritual encounter on the trail related to gaining insight into the essence of the book.  
 

A major focus of Hiking With Hum is on a truly unique character, my brother Hum.  He has endured years of my verbal abuse, my making fun of his unique ways and idiosyncrasies, and my made-up major kidding, which attempts to be humorous but otherwise might be subject to a libel suit (just kidding).

 

My letter to Hum on his 80th birthday contains many anecdotes taken from Hiking With Hum and  also contains many anecdotes not already mentioned in Hiking With Hum that give a further glimpse into Hum’s unique character:

 

May 10, 2020

Dear Big Brother Hum,

 

On this, the auspicious occasion of your 80th birthday, we wish to reflect on some good memories of our lives together.  

 

Early memories of my older brother Hum include your frequent and zealous counting of your money in your piggy bank.  It seemed that accumulating a fortune was an early Humberto ambition.  It also portends a lifetime of Humberto-level thriftiness (calling you a miser would be too harsh). 

 

I also recall your sitting for long periods of time in our Glen Rock living room, just thinking and thinking and otherwise doing nothing at all.  I believe that Dad used to comment on that behavior from time to time.  I remember that you told me not long ago that you still like to do that.  I do too.

 

I recall us both being awaked very early every morning by our brother Mon’s organ playing.  I especially remember kidding about one song that he played for which we invented the title “Oh hamburger! Oh hamburger!”  At least that’s what the music sounded like to us.

 

I well recall our virtuoso piano playing and especially our “Wooden Soldiers” duet that was a triumphal sensation at our teacher Mr. Koster’s annual recital held at the Woman’s Club in Ridgewood, NJ.  Neither one of us could remember who played that dramatic piano run down the keyboard portraying the falling down of the Wooden Soldiers.  Later on, you zealously took up playing the saxophone.  You played a memorable solo for Dad’s 75th birthday show (and as I said in introducing your saxophone solo, “Heaven help us”).

 

Vivid memories of summers in Awosting flood in: hare & hounds, bike hikes, the mine-hole, slap-tag, the Inn, excursions up the creek in our little rowboat.  I also recall that in those early games of slap-tag that I first heard the names “Rapid Robert” and “Roberto Humberto”, which were directed your way by your fellow slap-tag players.  Especially memorable from Awosting were the hours and hours we spent learning and playing tennis together.  You developed more talent than me and later became, according to brother Mon, “Arthur Humberto Ashe”, tennis superstar.  This culminated in your playing for the World Champion Tennis Player title (or something like that) in Palm Springs, CA, and I think you said you won.

 

We were both entrepreneurs at an early age and for many years sold Christmas cards together door to door throughout all of Glen Rock, every day after school and on weekends.  We covered a tremendous amount of ground and made some money, but the fortune you craved was not quite achieved in that enterprise.  Customers sometimes asked us to suggest clever ways that their printed signature on the card could be a humorous play on their name.  I recall that one time you suggested to Mrs. Bosco, who lived on Pinelynn Rd. across from Tom Montgomery, that they could sign their card “The Boscos and All Their Little Beverages”.  We didn’t make that sale.

 

You were phenomenally dedicated to scouting, for 38 years as I recall, as Scoutmaster, Assistant Scout Master, Committee Member and Chairman.  I fondly recall how we three Ash brothers all served many years in the Boy Scouts and in Troop 16.  Camping trips to Camp Yaw Paw in the Ramapo Mountains will forever be in our memory, not to mention your stint one year in the Yaw Paw Summer Camp, where on occasion you took part in the hunt for those dastardly and very elusive snipes.

 

Many times on our backpacking hiking adventures we encountered a shared interest in the Boy Scouts with other hikers we meet along the way.  This inevitably leads to Hum and the hiker-we-meet sharing your many stories and love of scouting.  Here is an excerpt from our August 2009 journal of our first backpacking hike on the Long Trail over Mt. Mansfield, Camel’s Hump, and other majestic sites:

 

“Before long a troop of 5 boy scouts in their early teens and 2 adults arrive (the leader, also the scout Committee Chair, and the father of one of the boys).  They’ve come from Hump Brook Tenting Area this morning and are on their way to Birch Glen Camp tonight.  The leader arrives a little after the others, soaking wet, almost as if he’d been swimming somewhere – we could not figure out why he is so wet.  Their arrival puts Hum in hog heaven, because he just loves to talk about scouting and we do that for more than an hour.  These are really nice folks from the south of Boston, and we enjoy an interesting, wide-ranging conversation.  Hum relates his long experience as scoutmaster and philosophy on being a good scout leader.  We hear that this is the second time these boys have hiked over Camels Hump and that they are now training to go to Philmont Scout Camp in New Mexico next summer.”

 

Here is another encounter we had on our Pennsylvania AT hike in 2012, with a less loquacious hiker:

 

“Laser Legs is a former scoutmaster and still active in scouts.  A fact such as this is usually the start of a lengthy conversation between Hum and another hiker with a common interest on the subject of scouting.  Hum has been a scoutmaster for many years, and because he obviously loves scouting he loves to talk about scouting.  Unfortunately, in this case, Laser Legs shows no interest in Hum’s scouting experience, he is very happy about talking more about himself, but that seems to be the limit of his interest.”

 

Finally, here is one other -- more rewarding -- discussion on our AT hike over the Grayson Highlands, VA, in 2015:

 

“We learn that Jonathan just graduated from the University of Central Florida with a BS in Mechanical Engineering.  He has already landed a job at a medical supply company, where he’ll start when he returns from the hike.  We also learn that Jonathan achieved the rank of Eagle Scout, which is a good entry into an extended discussion about scouting, since Hum is a long-time scoutmaster and is still deeply involved in scouting in his hometown back in Maryland, and Benny is also active on the scouting board in his home town.  They are by themselves in the shelter, which is probably fortunate since they have their stuff strewn all over the inside of the shelter and all over the ground outside the shelter.”

 

My longtime childhood best friend, Jimmy Sinkway, died at 75 in 2018, and this is a part of what I wrote on Jimmy’s memorial book:

 

“We [Jimmy Sinkway and I] were in the Boy Scouts together in Troop 16 in Glen Rock, where we were members of the Beaver Patrol.  My brother Bob was the patrol leader who tried, with limited success, to maintain proper decorum.  We enjoyed overnight hikes together to Camp Yaw Paw in the Ramapo Mountains.”

 

How true that was; Sinkway was always a challenge to decorum, to say the least, but nevertheless was kept in control by strict Humberto discipline.

 

There were the many years of your Navy service and all the memories to go with it.

 

There were your hilarious stories of your interview with Admiral Hyman Rickover, when he tried to throw you off balance by seating you on a crocked chair, having a beautiful woman walk by to distract your attention, and accusing you of wasting your father’s money by getting a poor grade in a course at the University of South Carolina.  I later sent you an extremely funny video portraying Rickover’s life and some very funny reenactments of his ridiculous interviews.  You shined through that interview and you (and Jimmy Carter) got the job in Rickover’s “Nuclear Navy”.

 

I recall a visit to the nuclear aircraft carrier, USS Enterprise, docked in New York Harbor as I recall.  Dad particularly was in hog-heaven that day recalling his own years in the US Navy.  We were all especially proud of Ensign Humberto that day.

 

You showed up at the last minute at Lynsie’s and my July 10, 1965 wedding, having just been granted a last-minute leave by the Navy.  What a joy that surprise was because we did not expect you would be able to make it to our wedding at all, and we had already set our minds to that unhappy expectation.

 

Lynsie and I visited you and Pat once in Oakland, CA, when the Big E was anchored there briefly.  I think it was in 1966 and you had just been reassigned to the ammunition ship Shasta for a tour of duty off the coast of South Vietnam.  We had a rousing night out at the “Gold Streets” bar in downtown San Francisco, which included a long line of us and many other revelers doing the “bunny hop” around the bar and outside on the streets.  I also recall Hum dumping a bowl of popcorn on his head and then using the bowl as a kind of crown.

 

We shared family vacations over many years, such as at Road’s-End Cottage on Lake St. Catherine, VT, at Blackwater Falls, WV, in the middle of winter nonetheless, and many other glorious places.  I recall you coordinated a couple of family reunions to Tygart Lake State Park in WV.

 

In October 1993, we all gathered in West Long Branch NJ for the wedding of Debbie and Bill.  At the glorious reception held at the beautiful Berkeley Carteret Hotel in Asbury Park, all the cousins serenaded all the adults with many of their happiest songs.  Of course, one inescapable memory of the event is my strange disappearance the morning after the wedding.  Extensive searching I think led by you produced no body, but fortunately, and with great embarrassment, I awoke in a vacant room in time to join the rest of the family at the Johnny & Hange’s hotdog feast.

 

In the summer of 1999 we all gathered in Idaho/Wyoming for Lisa and Scott’s wedding.  We recall the spectacular wedding ceremony held in a Teton meadow with the towering Grand Teton Mountains serving as a backdrop, the most spectacular wedding cathedral imaginable.  I recall we all hiked up to “Mary’s Nipple” in Grand Targhee and along the way Ray buzzed us on his glider ride.  Prior to the wedding, we all met in Yellowstone National Park, where I recall sharing the spectacular view of “Artist’s Point” with you and Pat.

 

In 2003, the family gathered once again, in northern Virginia, for the wedding of Katy and Tim.  At the Marriott Georgetown reception, with a spectacular view of Washington DC, the 4-bro’s gave a beautiful, memorable, and creative rendition of “K-K-K-Katy”.

 

In 2005, we enjoyed a family reunion at the wedding of Drew and Shannon in beautiful Hungry Mother State Park in Virginia.  Once again, the 4-bro’s gave a second rousing musical rendition, this time of “D-D-D-Drew”, and the cousins inspired us with their “House of the Rising Sun”.  

 

Along the way we also had many other memorable 3/4-bro’s reunions, several at your Pocono Pine’s townhouse and the last one being a 4-bro’s reunion here in Palm Coast, FL seven years ago.  We had a great guffawing time and between beers we found time to visit St. Augustine’s beautiful Flagler College (the former Ponce de Leon Hotel) and the Castillo de San Marcos, Washington Gardens State Park, and Daytona Beach, where we drove on the beach and swam.  Such reunions are always filled with fun and laughter and guffaws and pontificating and just being us.

 

Then there is our 10 years of hiking and backpacking together on the Vermont Long Trail and the Appalachian Trail.  What a fabulous set of adventures these have been!  As I count it we have hiked upwards of 1000 miles together.  Fortunately many of these adventures have been documented in our journal, The Adventures of Ho & Hum, and hopefully they will all be documented eventually.

 

I have cited a few excerpts from the journal above, but there is one more that is perhaps my favorite story related to Hum’s exploits on the trail, from our August 2009 journal of our first backpacking hike on the Long Trail over Mt. Mansfield:

 

“Not too far below Taft Lodge, Hum slips and falls on one of the uncountable steep slippery rock ledges, and lands sprawled directly across the ledge pretty much blocking the LT at that point.  He is unhurt but extremely tired and professes that he just wants to “rest for a bit” before getting back up.  Coincidentally at the very same time a large number of day hikers (10 or more) are making their way down the mountain and come upon Hum sprawled out across the trail, in their way, blocking their path.  Each one of them asks in turn and in a very concerned voice “are you SURE that you’re all right?”  So now there is a large audience gathered waiting for Hum to get up and prove that indeed he is all right.  Finally, one young woman says “we’d all feel much better if you’d get up”.  So tired Hum reluctantly picks himself up off the trail, whereupon another young man in the audience quips “look at all those footprints on your back”.  Everyone has a good chuckle over Hum’s supposed trampling by day hikers.”

 

At times on our hikes I could overhear you telling other hikers about my exploits at Bell Labs and in Vietnam and other stories.  Thank you Hum for showering me with well-deserved, highly accurate praise.

 

And of course there are the highly prized “Humberto Services” that you demonstrate so proudly and skillfully on our hikes:

 

Humberto’s ETA service: Humberto declares well in advance the exact time that we will arrive at our destination.  This is always accurate to within plus or minus one microsecond.  No one knows how Hum does it.
Humberto’s warning service: Humberto warns other hikers we meet of all the hazards they will encounter in the next few miles on the trail: impassable mud pit ahead; dense fog ahead with zero visibility; very aggressive white-faced hornets ahead; 3000’ straight-up climb ahead; and other perhaps near-fatal hazards.  One pair of hikers who we encountered several times and received several Humberto warnings finally said “you always give us bad news!”
Humberto’s charm service: Upon meeting a young, pretty hiker who is hiking alone, Humberto turns on the maximum charm, demonstrating how debonair Humberto is and how handsome Humberto is and what a wonderful conversationalist Humberto is.  This usually delays our hike at least 30 minutes and perhaps more than one hour.
Humberto’s wisdom service: If Humberto hears any question, any question at all, or some problem needing a solution, Humberto immediately provides a complete and 100% correct answer.  Sometimes Hum shares his vast knowledge unprompted on virtually any topic, at length, leaving out no details or important facts.  After such valuable learnings, one can only say as brother Ray often does “Humberto has spoken, so be it!”  No one knows where Hum obtained this seemingly infinite store of knowledge, but luckily Humberto is willing to freely and generously share his knowledge with me and all the other hikers we meet.

 

Just kidding (mostly).  These hikes have been one of the most memorable and exciting and rewarding parts of my life, all thanks to my Big Brother Hum.  Quite seriously, your knowledge and wisdom, sense of humor, good nature, and booming laugh are joys to behold.  I have treasured these joys my whole life.

 

Fine memories, all of these :-)  We’re glad to celebrate these wonderful years of your life, and we pray that in the years to come we will continue to share the love, laughter, and Humberto-uniqueness that we have now enjoyed for 80 years.  

 

As I said in the “Memories” production for Dad’s 75th birthday, “the best thought we have tonight is of all the happy times we have ahead of us”.  This is still so true.

 

We’re sorry that your celebration had to be postponed, but we will certainly be thinking of you and wishing you a joyful celebration, particularly on this very big Happy Birthday.

 

We love you Dear Brother, Congratulations, & Best Wishes,

Jerry & Lynsie

 

 

This letter gives a further glimpse into Hum’s unique character and many other anecdotes of two brothers’ lives together.  I hope to turn this compendium Hiking With Hum into a book someday.  It would not be a “how to” work about the technicalities of back packing and hiking, although there is some valuable information about that topic.  Rather, it would tell the many priceless stories about my brother Hum, the wonderful characters we meet along the way, and the deep learnings we take from the trail.  All these are life lessons taken from our 10 spectacular years of hiking together.

 

My final word encapsulates the spirit of this whole wonderful story: 
Humberto has spoken.  So be it.",,View Entry,"Jan 23, Mon",0
