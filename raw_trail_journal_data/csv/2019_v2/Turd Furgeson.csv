Turd Furgeson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632490,"Welcome to my blog, I am Turd Furgeson and I am a AT Thru Hiker. I began my journey on 11 JAN before I officially retired from the Army and then got back on trail 22 MAR for the duration of the trip. I wanted to get out early and test out some of my gear so there will be a break in hiking in February. 
I met up with 3D and we got to the top of Springer at about 230 pm. We knew we were going to have to probably hike a little in the dark so we put on our headlamps and started the first 4 miles downhill. Everything was pretty uneventful, however we did reach Hawk Mountain Shelter after hiking about an hour in the dark. Fortunately everyone was still awake. I was surprised to see about 5 other hikers already in camp.","Springer Mountain

Turd Furgeson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632491,"Sorry folks, no photos today but it was kind of fun walking through Cooper Gap. This gap often has a water buffalo set up for the Army Ranger students that are training in Mountain Phase. I remember this area quite well and had a lot of memories of the open field near the cemetery. We decided that since it was really cold and the playoffs we should hitch into town and watch football.","Hawk Mountain Shelter

Turd Furgeson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632492,"Today we hiked a little over 14 miles because 3D had to go back to Tennessee. Since we were getting in a little late and there was another ice storm and football again, I decided to stay at the Blood Mountain Cabin. I can tell you that starting this early you will see very few people. I was happy to get in to Neels Gap knowing I only had a couple more days of hiking before I have to head back to North Carolina for my VA appointments.","Gooch Gap

Turd Furgeson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632499,It was another really cold day today. I dont really remember much about it other than I was excited to check out the Enota Mountain Retreat. It was a new hostel and they were awesome to pick me up. I pretty much lumbered my way down the trail the entire day by myself. 3D left the day prior. I soon realized that hiking in January is a pretty lonely place lol. Im glad I was in good spirits. I seen no other hikers that entire day. What I did see was a really cool stealth spot halfway up from Tesenate Gap that I  stayed at a couple years ago. It sits on the edge of a huge boulder and there is a spot for two small tents. I was also pretty excited as the Chiefs won that previous night in the playoffs.,"Neel Gap

Turd Furgeson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632502,"I left the hostel after a great stay and shuttled back to the trail. Its funny looking back on this week but I did a lot of staying in town. In all fairness it was extremely cold. I should have slack packed now that i think about it. It was icing pretty much the entire day so I didnt really get hot at all. I decided that I was going to push a big day so that I could get to the Top of Georgia Hostel. I was pretty excited about it because I  stayed there before and had a great experience. I had a lot of climbs this day, I remember being able to see blue mountain shelter off the side of the trail with nobody there. It looked so dreary through the bare limbs on the scattered trees. I always thought the dead leaves on the ground with the bareness of the trees always made the views pretty. I imagined squirrels rustling through the leaves while I hiked reminding me of my childhood.I finally reached Dicks Creek Gap and started walking down the road. I ran into a girl that was working at the hostel and she told me they were open. I wont get into the whole story but it was an awful experience and I would not recommend this place until it has a new owner. I do believe they closed it down and were trying to find new buyers. This is a great location if they get it running again.I was able to get a shower, laundry and a bunk but there was no heat.","Enota Mountain Retreat

Turd Furgeson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632503,"Today was going to be a big day and I was coming to the end of my trip until i got to come back out when I retire on the 22 March. I left the hostel and walked back up the highway to start heading north again. It was about a .5 mile roadwalk. I got to the trailhead and started climbing. It was about 5 miles to Plumborchard Gap Shelter, I planned on sitting there for lunch then heading for a few more miles to my goal, the NC/GA Border crossing.
I dont remember the climb up As Knob being that tough but for whatever reason, that day it was. I had done this hike a few times so I was familiar with approximately where the sign was. Another cool thing about this day was going past the gnarly tree. I always thought it was cool and enjoyed hanging out there for a few more minutes.
As the day went on it got colder and wetter. I decided to pull into Muskrat Creek Shelter for the night and figure out my best way to get to Hiawassee.  I decided to stay at the shelter and glad i did because an hour later Wrong Way showed up. It was the last time i seen him but i followed his travels the rest of the way the Mt K.
At the shelter I made a quick dinner, ate, and checked my options. I decided to hike in the morning to Chunky Gal Trail and then take it to the HWY. This seemed like a great idea at the time.","Dicks Creek Gap

Turd Furgeson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632504,"I only hike 1 mile on the AT but about 5 on the chunky gal trail. The reason i had to go down the Chunky Gal Trail was because all of the forest service roads were closed. So I walked through some really tough trail. There were many blowdowns and now that I think about it, the govt was shut down and crews werent allowed to work this week. The ice storm did a number on the trees and there was a lot of ducking and climbing. I finally got off trail knowing I had a  couple months to dial in my gear and get back out for the rest of the adventure.","Muskrat Creek Shelter

Turd Furgeson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632485,"Today I left Fort Bragg in a rental  car and drove to Franklin to get back on the trail. I am hiker 12, I know that sounds weird. I started around January 12, I still have to go back and figure out which day it was. I was getting the itch to  get out on trail before I started my VA appointments so I took off in the blistering cold weather for a week to check out the gear I would eventually use on this day. I met up with D3 who I hiked with in our fat guys in the woods group. Many of us are thru hikers, well, they were at this point. I was still hoping to be fortunate and lucky enough to make it all the way. D3 hike to Neels Gap with me. I wasn't in much of a hurry as the Chiefs were playing in the playoffs and I wanted to watch football so much of the weekend was spent in hostels. This was good as it was a good break from the freezing weather.

Anyway, the first day  back on trail was pretty uneventful. I walked into the woods around 3 or 4 pm and went as far as I could before it got dark. I wanted to stay near Beech Gap because I remember it being a nice flat spot with plenty of tent sites from my previous hikes. It was also just a few hours from where chunky gal meets up  with the AT. That night I met Catch Up and Rabbit on the trail. They were a father and son duo who I would hike with until we reached Fontana Dam.","Chunky Gal Trailhead

Turd Furgeson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632486,"I woke up my first morning  thinking that  I would do just the amount of miles that I felt comfortable with. I remember my first time on the trail, it was in itself a failure, but my philosophy is fail forward. I tried hiking the AT in 2016 for a week. I felt confident I  could easily walk 20 mile days, I was in the Army after all. It was a painful lesson that I was not about to replicate. I was able to cover 15 miles that day and stayed at another familiar location, Rock Gap Shelter. The cool thing about Rock Gap Shelter is toward the bottom of the hill just down from the Shelter there is a flat place to set up about four tents. The other good thing about Rock Gap is that it has always provided a good amount of trail magic, which was the case today. I was able to grab a cold beer and warm food at the end of my first day. I stayed by myself this night. I remember the moon being really bright and I noticed the fabric in my tent causing me some concern because it looked like it was spreading apart. For the next 120 miles I worried about rain. It almost seems so trivial looking back on it now. What a great first day.","Beech Gap

Turd Furgeson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632487,"Today was a planned short day. I knew when I got back on the trail it would be an easy hitch into Franklin and I really wanted to stay at Baltimore Jacks and eat at the Lazy Hiker. The real reason was so I could meet some hikers in town and maybe see who would be cool to hike with. I also wanted to put a patch on the tent to make sure it didn't leak, it did give me some peace of mind. Town was ok, but I didn't know anyone yet and the food wasn't as good as I remembered. I seen Catch Up and Rabbit at one of the outfitters and I did meet a few people that were really nice. Oh,  I think this is the place where I got a pancake breakfast at the church. The cool thing about it was they let you send a little card to your family to let them know you  made it the first 100 miles. Actually, I would not hit that until the next day when I got up Albert Mountain. 
I was able to get some resupply though and the next morning I headed back out into what would be a horrible rain storm.","Rock Gap Shelter
",Winding Stair Gap,"Mar 24, Sun",3.60
Turd Furgeson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632488,"I left for the trailhead early in the  morning after a great breakfast at he church. The day was pretty overcast for much of the day and I could tell it was going to rain. I just had no idea how much. My first couple miles took me up Siler Bald. There were a couple things about this place that I will never forget. Its really a neat place and if I ended my hike there I would have watched the sun go down. Its the first time you really get to the top of a mountain and there is a huge bald at the top. I kept thinking this would be a great place to go sled riding. Also, I have a great picture of Sherpa, Lucky Dog, Lumberjack and myself there from a previous hike. Also, I remember meeting another hiker from one of the wounded veterans groups that was hiking with his dog. I was pretty excited to see him and his pup until he started talking. He had the most negative attitude of anyone I met on trail, unfortunately I would continue to hike around him off and on until Duncannan, PA. 

I got over the bald and hiked a little further to Wayah Bald Tower. It started to rain and you could really see it coming in the distance. I decided to stop for the day because the next shelter was a mile down trail and there was a rather large bubble of people staying there. It turned out to be a great decision. I slept in the bathroom in the parking lot with Catch Up and Rabbit. I would not advise sleeping at the bottom of the tower though on a rainy night. It collected about an inch of rain on the inside and many people got wet through the night. I was also glad I stopped early because the shelter was full and all tent sites were taken. Many hikers had to pitch tents on uneven slopes and their gear was drying out all day. 


It seemed I got lucky and my previous experiences on trail helped keep me dry. Also, I definitely earned the title of hiker trash sleeping in that privy.","Winding Stair Gap
",Wayah Bald Tower,"Mar 25, Mon",10.10
Turd Furgeson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632489,"Today was a great day and I stayed dry. I didn't know how lucky I was until I walked up to the tower and seen everyone soaked inside. Most of them were from the warrior foundation and most of them were really cool folks. I talked to a guy that was a Field Artillery Officer who was in Afghanistan at the same time as me. I continued down trail toward the shelter and it looked like a gear bomb exploded. Everyone was trying to dry all of their stuff. Again, feeling thankful I slept in the shitter for a lack of better terms. 
I decided I was going to walk my longest day to date so that I could get to the NOC. I had a bunkhouse that I reserved and offered it up to some of the other hikers. Catch Up and Rabbit stayed. I also met Biscuits and another guy that was later named Jukebox. I hiked around Biscuits until he went back to England and Jukebox until somewhere in Virginia I think. Biscuits was in and out of the groups I was around and Jukebox was hiking with Amy and think Honeybuns. We all stayed at the bunkhouse excited to be at Fontana Dam and entering the smokies in a few days.
The one thing that sticks out for me is hiking up wesser bald. For some reason it was a difficult climb for me and I didn't remember it being that difficult the first time I had hiked it.","Wayah Bald Tower

Turd Furgeson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632506,"We got a pretty good night sleep and I decided to just get hiking. I knew I had a long uphill hike for 8 miles and wanted to get to Stecoah Gap so I could eat at the Stecoah Gap Diner. I ate there once before really wanted to visit. The first time i ate there the owner had already closed but stayed open for us. He also came and picked us up in his truck, we loaded up and off we went. It was a great diner and the food was amazing. 
Once I got to the top of Cheoah Bald I ate lunch and layed out in the sun. It felt pretty good up there and two other hikers joined me. I dont remember both of them but i do remember one. He was a bit of trouble and it was very uncomfortable being around him. I am not intimidated easily but he certainly gave me some bad vibes. I would hike around him for the next 100 miles and then he disappeared from everyone on the trail. I think he had named himself Rambo but changed his name because the informal internet (Trail Journals) were piling up with his name in them.","NOC

Turd Furgeson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632507,"I got up this morning after a great breakfast and caught my ride to the trailhead. I immediately started up the mountain and it was a really nice day with lots of sun. I made it to Cable Gap Shelter and had my usual lunch at a shelter if i could. Typically because I could get water close by. I have started getting good at keeping the water weight to a minimum. And its nice to stretch out on the shelter floor instead of the cold ground. The day was uneventful but had a really good finish line. I would be staying at the Fontana ""Hilton"" right on the lake. Its really just a shelter that has a shower house and water with power cable chargers. I stayed the night with Catch Up and Rabbit and a guy named Sun who only spoke Chinese. I got in early enough that I could watch the sun go down on the lake, but had a problem with the resupply. I didnt get in until late and the general store had already closed. I was a little worried about food because I wanted to get to Newfound Gap to resupply in Gatlinburg. I was able to scrounge up some stuff from a hiker box that would hold me over until i got the the halfway point through the Smokies.","Stecoah Gap

Turd Furgeson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632508,"Today I start the newest challenge so far, the Great Smokey Mountains. I woke up with the sun coming up over the lake and packed up my stuff in the shelter. There were alot of early moving folks so I didnt feel too bad about the noise. I made my down the roadwalk toward the damn. I decided to stop at the dam for a quick minute to look at the spillway. I didnt take a picture of it since i had been here before. I wish that i would have. Anyway, I made my way across the dam for about a mile and then i encountered the permit box. I deposited my entry into the box and continued up the path toward Shuckstack Tower. I didnt go up it because it was pretty rickety and i knew there were plenty more ahead. Plus it was an additional .3 or so up the mountain, no thanks.
I ate a quick lunch at Mollies Ridge Shelter and continued to Russell Field Shelter just a few miles down the road. I kind of wanted to go to the Spence Field Shelter just three miles down trail but i decided to get a good spot in the shelter. I ate my usual mashed potatoes for dinner and went to sleep.","Fontana Hilton

Turd Furgeson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632510,"I was somewhat excited about today because I was going to go over two of my favorite spots in the  southern smokies today. I woke up about 330 am and could not go back to sleep so I started packing up my things in the shelter and made my way outside. It was very dark except the clouds were thick in the middle but thin on the edges which allowed the moonlight to sneak through the thin layers. It was a beautiful pattern of shapes denoted by rays of light. I didnt want to waste any time so I put my pack on and set out with no breakfast.At the time I  figured I would be night hiking more often. I knew that it was going to be a full moon and decided that this would be the best way to indoctrinate. It was really pretty walking because the trees had changed to the alpine type trees. Many had been knocked over by storms but it was so neat seeing the shapes of these tall trees through my headlamp. I did eat a little snack and started to see the sun pop up over the horizon. Rocky Top and Thunderhead Mountains were just ahead.When I hiked with the fat guys in the woods group we spent some time up on top. The conditions were actually about the same, windy and overcast. I liked these to spots because the views were really nice and there was a good spot to sit on top of Rocky Top. And there is a great tunnel of Rhododendron at the top.The weather was coming in and I needed to get to Double Spring Gap Shelter. It would be my coldest night on the trail. I made it to the shelter and there were already two girls that were freshman in college already there. I remember because the gear they were using was borrowed from the university loaner program that signs out camping equipment and canoes. They were definitely not prepared and they suffered throughout the night. I let them borrow a sitting pad to use as a barrier for their sleeping bag.The temps dropped well into the teens that night and i decided to get moving early in the morning since i was shivering more than sleeping anyway.","Russel Field Shelter
",Double Spring Gap Shelter,"Mar 30, Sat",16.40
Turd Furgeson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632515,"Today is a big day in many ways. First, I get to climb the highest point on the AT, Clingmans Dome. I also get to cross into another state, Tennessee. There were so many great things about this day I  almost would forget that I officially crossed the 200 mile mark and I knew i was doing a nero so I could do a zero tomorrow in Gatlinburg. 
Getting to the top of Clingmans was a bit of a chore. The snow/ice was still coming down pretty hard and I definitely needed to get into town. As I climbed to the top I was on the exposed side of the mountain and the winds and ice were blowing in sideways. When there where gaps between the pines I would run so that i could hurry through the wind. I neared the top and Clingmans was visible through the fog and snow.
When I reached the Dome there was not a person in sight. The roads had been closed going up to the top and I would not be able to get a signal until I reached the clearing. When I got to the top I called Renee at Lodge of Legends. She has set up her basement as a hostel and is donation based. (Top 5 Experience on entire trail) Renee let me know that they were getting ready to close the road to Newfound and I  needed to hurry or else I would have to stay in the bathrooms at Newfound Gap. I was kind of expecting that to be my backup plan anyway. The bathrooms are warm and have water.
I trekked the short distance as fast as I  could but not before I almost forgot my 200 mile pic. I had to make my own since I may have been one of the few still out. I was relieved as I climbed the gently incline up through the woods and I could see some of the cars still in the lot. I made my way to some other hikers who received a bag of brownies from their mom. They gave me an entire ziplock bag full of them and I started to devour them as I waited for Renee. 
The most impactful thing happened to me in the next few minutes that I would not realize until much later. I would meet my first trail family and one of those unlucky people would summit with me nearly 2000 miles later. After I ate several  of the brownies I encountered a group of about four Hikers, Jeff, Sharktooth, Turtle and Pup, and Coyote. I walked up to them and asked if they would like the brownies. Coyote accepted them and I marveled at them going back out into the storm. I noticed Turtle was wearing really heavy, waterproof boots. I was shocked at how fast that dude could hike in those. Turtle and pup were some of the fastest hikers I met on trail. 
Renee showed up just after the group took off and I didnt really figure I would ever see them again. Luckily for me I would catch them in Hot Springs, NC at just the right time. In the meantime, I  have my first official zero of the trip tomorrow.","Double Spring Gap Shelter

Turd Furgeson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632516,"My zero was pretty uneventful. Gatlinburg definitely lived up to the Beverly Hillbillys meet Hollywood stereotype. Seriously, it was something else, but I hung out with a couple of hikers from Ashville that day. They only hiked a few miles near me because they were getting off trail for a week and then coming back. They eventually summitted later on with a few other people I hiked with. 
I went into Gatlinburg and bought a couple coffee mugs for the kids and had them shipped home. I also picked up some different a couple new items and some mountain house meals. I had not eaten one yet and wanted to see what all  the rage was, i picked biscuits and gravy. That is one of my favorites and could always be counted on as a pick me up.OK, so I got to rave about Legends real quick. Renee is one of the nicest hostel owners and here family is great. If you can get in, you should stay. The bingbag beds are great, she has awesome resupply options and the shuttle stop into town is right next to her house.","

Turd Furgeson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632517,"I was a little nervous starting out today because the ice and snow was still covering the trail and I decided to put on my microspikes. I'm glad I did because even wearing them I fell down a few times. I was also nervous because for the first time on this trip I would not be on familiar trail. I had hike the first 200 miles of the AT several times before but this was new except for a stretch in Hot Springs.
I got out on trail pretty early and we snapped some pictures prior to taking off and I made my way towards Charlies Bunion. I was moving much better than the others because of my micros. I heard that one of the hikers with a dog fell down and broke her leg. I felt bad, but I was still hiking by myself at that time and she was hiking with another lady about her age. 
I made it to Charlies Bunion after about two hours and set my camera timer and snapped a quick picture. I continued on my way in hopes of a big day. I never really liked hiking in the Smokies because the weather is so unpredictable. I was pushing for 16 miles to get to the shelter, and early enough to get a fire going.  The weather was expected to clear, which it did, and I got some amazing views in the North Smokies. The best part was it was my last night in the park in high elevations. I was looking forward to hiking out just past the park and camping in my tent, out of the cold.
It was an uneventful night at the shelter,  honestly I dont remember but maybe one other person, Street Jesus, staying there. The guy was a bit of a strange dude but he was nice enough. He offered me some weed but I kindly refused and after a couple of days I dont think I  seen him again. The best part was my coldest days were behind me...for the most part.","Newfound Gap

Turd Furgeson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632519,"I woke up this morning and seen the sun was shining and I would soon be leaving the Smokey Mountain Park. I took my time going down the trail but not really stopping for anything. The views were pretty amazing and I think by far better in the north part of the park than in the south. I have such a bias against the Smokies that I just bypassed Mt Cammerer tower. Its kind of a long hike, .6 and I wasnt really feeling it by adding a total of 1.2 miles to an already 16 mile day. One day maybe ill go back and check it out. I had about 6 miles to go and the trail just kind of meandered gently down into Davenport Gap Shelter. As I approached the shelter that was located a few hundred feet below me, I could here a couple of hikers talking at the picnic table. Its funny how you can hear so far away when there aren't leaves on the trees. I didnt stop at the shelter because the only thought on my mind was shoving the other paper permit into the backcountry permit box, signifying I  had departed the park.Freedom at last, I didnt have to stay in shelters anymore and could use my tent. In the park you have to reserve your shelters and not camp in your tent. Also, I was coming up on Max Patch, a spot I heard so much about. I walked about a mile further and found a tent spot next to a flowing creek. It was a great spot because there were plenty of trees to hang my bear bag from and water was flowing so I could wash up a little bit too. Ghost showed up soon after I set up my tent. I had met Ghost at Rock Gap in GA at the trail magic. He set up his tent and we talked for a while. He was a nice guy but after the next morning he was off and I dont think I seen him again.","Tri Corner Knob Shelter

Turd Furgeson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632520,"Today was a really rough day for some reason and I am not sure why. The morning started off great, I packed up my tent and ate. The temperatures were mild and for the first time it felt good in the morning. I made it to the road and was greeted by some trail magic. There wasn't a lot there but I felt a little obligated to sit with the guy for a bit while I ate an apple and had some coffee. I got moving after some conversation, which probably seemed forced but the guy just didnt seem interested in talking anyway. I popped over Rich Mountain and toward Standing Bear Farm. This is about when my mood completely changed. It is funny how fast something can completely change your attitude. It takes serious mental toughness to get up every morning and put on wet clothes in cold temperatures and walk. I think the weight loss was starting to become a factor. I was pretty heavy when I started and I had already lost about 20 pounds in my first few weeks. Snowbird Peak sits at the top of the mountain. It is a 2000 ft climb over 3 miles. I didnt think it would be that bad but it broke me. I remember getting near the top and taking a picture of a blaze on the post because I thought it may be the last bald that I walk by. I decided to keep walking toward Max Patch and maybe getting off trail at Max Patch Road. I had called ahead to Elmers Sunnybank Inn and they told me they had an open room and could come get me. I decided I would walk there, get my mind right, take a shower and decide what to do. I finally made it to the road and I seen a car parked at the top. There were two previous thru hikers doing trail magic at Max Patch Road. I will never forget them because they probably saved my hike. They cooked me a ham and bacon sandwich and the more I ate the more my mood improved. I called Elmers and was picked up about 40 minutes later. I got to the Hostel and took care of all my chores and decided to get a bite to eat. I went to bed early that night thinking I would give it one more day or two.

He let me know that he wanted to come out for the weekend and I needed a few shorter days to kind of process yesterday. I decided to take my time getting out of town that day and get back up to Max Patch road. This would give me some time on top of Max Patch and then I could get to Walnut Mountain Shelter where 3D could walk about a mile to me. Then we would be able to walk about 14 miles back to Hot Springs together and stay at Laughing Heart Hostel before he got a shuttle back to his car.The hiking was really pretty easy today because we started kind of at the top. I walked up Max Patch with relative ease and met a hiker at the top eating lunch. His name was Moonshine and I would see him as well throughout North Carolina and a little of Virginia.  Max Patch was really nice but it was pretty windy so I decided to move on to the shelter.3D coming out was amazing trail magic and really put my hike back into the positive. We both ate dinner and set up in the shelter. Another hiker named Ranger showed up a little while later and the conversation was pretty chill. Ranger was graduating dentistry school in New York and was hiking the AT before starting his new job. Ranger was one of the coolest dudes I knew on trail and was fortunate enough to spend some time hiking around each other through Tennessee all the way to Pennsylvania. I woke up around 10 PM when another hiker wanted to squeeze into the shelter. It wasnt a problem to squeeze him in however, this guy comes in at 10 and wakes us all up to give us earplugs. I dont have a problem with snoring but wow. This guy was the loudest and he was kind of rude waking everyone up instead of just setting up his tent. A little after 11 I remember Ranger packing his stuff and going outside. I finally couldnt take it anymore. I moved my footprint under the picnic table and just slept out in the open under the table.  It was my first experience cowboy camping and i loved it.

After getting snore bombed throughout the night and moving out underneath the  picnic table, I for whatever reason had an amazing moment. I was just laying out under the cloud covered sky with the stars intermittently sparkling through. Then the skies cleared and the darkness gave way to the moonlight. It wasn't terribly cold either so I got up and made a cup of coffee in the dark. It was a great morning as I watched the black skies turn into purple and pink hues. Then the sun came out and I remember the warmth on my face and the steam from the coffee rising in the air. It was at that moment that I made my decision. I would hike on, and by the end of the day the trail would provide.
I walked with 3D for about 13 miles that day. It was funny that 3D told me that I was hiking pretty fast. Up until this point I kind of felt like I was one of the slower hikers and just trying to keep up with those around me. I then started to wonder if everyone else felt the same way as me and we were killing ourselves for no reason. 
We passed a cemetery along the way and I snapped a picture but I didn't want to waste any time. I started my way down the mountain and could see some of the small farm houses just outside of Hot Springs. I noticed some movement to my right on the bank of the hill and a five foot blacksnake caught my eye. It was the first one I would see but certainly not the last. 
I got down to the hostel with 3D and we got our bunks at the Laughing Heart Hostel and then walked down to the diner in town. We got to the back entrance and seated outside was Turtle and Pup, Sharktooth, Spoons, Coyote, Snap and a couple other hikers. We were invited to sit with them and we had a great time. I reminded them that I was the guy they met in the smokies with the brownies. I was excited that I met some other hikers to chill with a little. This was a pretty big group and there were about two other trail families hanging out in Hot Springs.
We all hung out for a while but needed to get back to the hostel. It was going to be an early day the next day and rain was forecasted. I was going to need to get to a shelter if I could by dark.","Walnut Mountain Shelter

Turd Furgeson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632545,"Before I leave Hot Springs I have to say that this was the town that peaked my interest into hiking the trail. I cant remember if it was 2012 but i came to Hot Springs with my wife to stay in a cabin. We decided to drive into Hot Springs for the tubs, but also to walk on the nature trails. Notice I didnt say AT because I didnt know it was even a thing at the time. That trip we shopped at the outfitter and I got some books on the AT and then we hiked about 10 miles that week going north from Hot Springs. It was my life changing moment that drew me to the trail. I walked through town and crossed the bridge after saying good bye to 3D. I made my way along the river and up to lovers leap. This was the section I remember from the first time i ever stepped foot on the trail and was a pretty special moment for me. I continued along the trail to the dammed pond. This was where I met Free for the first time. He has hiked the trail a few times and was kind of a mystery to a lot of people. He was sitting on a log eating lunch next to the pond. I felt like it was a nice spot so I decided to get a snack for a few minutes as well. I was walking alone that day and would camp by myself that night. I passed a couple shelters but decided I would camp near a side trail, I have no idea why I picked this spot. I dont remember it having water or anything special about it. The good thing is I was in good spirits and around other hikers that I enjoyed being around.","Hot Springs, NC

Turd Furgeson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632546,"I got up in the morning and had a quick breakfast. The outlook for the day wasnt too good. I packed up and started trekking on down the trail. It was a pretty good morning and I had a pretty good climb ahead of me today. It was going to be a long day with Firescald Mountain at the end of the day. I hiked the first 10 miles before I started the ascent. The weather had held for most of the day but the temps were dropping and it was starting to get cold. I was surprised to see a bad weather bypass about halfway up  the mountain. I am so glad that i didnt take the bypass, looking back it would have kind of been silly after what I would have to face in New England. I got to the summit and I was really taken aback by the view. I didnt spend too much time at the top because the clouds really started to come in and I could see the rain off in the distance. I did take the time to read the plaque at the top.I scurried down the mountain and remember passing the other side of the bypass and again thankful I didnt miss out on the view. I continued down trail for about a mile when I noticed the 300 mile mark made out of rocks. I almost missed it because they were sort of blended in well with the ground. I kept walking and cam upon licklog gap when the rain started coming down in buckets. I looked at guthooks to see how far it would be to the next shelter or if I should just set up in the rain. I decided to make it to the shelter and see if there was room inside. Coming down the ridge was really pretty with the fog and dead limbs and bare trees. It was almost intimidating walking through the trees. I seen a tent ahead but realized someone had enough of the rain. It was not the shelter so i pressed on. I finally arrived at the shelter and not surprisingly it was full.Luckily for me the rains parted as soon as I made it to the shelter and since it was full, I quickly set up my tent. Also, lucky for me, I caught up with Turtle and the gang from the diner. They had crammed into the shelter even sleeping on the stone fireplace. I also seen Sun again, I had not seen him since Fontana Hilton. This was about to become my trail family and one of them would eventually summit with me. But all of that will  have to wait until later. I hung out with everyone that night before it started raining again. It was a great time and despite the rain, everyone was in good spirits. I would also find out this night to have 100 percent faith in my zpacks duplex. I had fixed the seam back in Franklin and hadnt used it in the rain yet. Tonight was my baptism by fire, or in this case rain moment. The tent held up wonderfully and I gained a ton of confidence this day.","Little Paint Creek Trail

Turd Furgeson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632550,"Last night was definitely a cold and wet night, but I stayed dry. I was so happy that I  pitched my tent when I did because that shelter was full. I cant believe it to this day but there were at least 10 hikers in the shelter that only sleeps six. The best part about that night though was that I would gain a ton of confidence in that single wall tent. Out of all my gear, I do believe the duplex tent was my favorite piece of gear. Of the hikers that I am pretty positive were in the shelter were: Turtle and pup, Sharktooth, Spoons, T-Bone, B-Tone, Sun, Tiffany, Kid and another older hiker. 
Something funny happened in the middle of the night. I started seeing red lights flashing through my tent and a little bit of commotion. I brushed it off after i told them to quit shining it into my tent. Turns out, Tiffany and Kid decided to leave in the middle of the night and hike. I dont think everyone in the shelter was happy with them. 
I woke up in the morning and hiked a bit with Turtle and Pup. Turtle was a pretty good dude and I enjoyed talking with him. He was closer in age to me and he could keep a conversation going. We hiked about 10 miles that morning and we pulled into Devils Fork Gap. At the bottom of the hill we met up with Aspen, Rocket, Nash and PYT. Parked in the lot was a pop up tent and lots of food. There was a thru hiker from a previous year giving out trail magic. It was quite the spread and everyone was excited. It also gave us the perfect opportunity to dry out our gear. I spread mine out on some of the scrub trees to let it dry while I ate. 
I finished eating and decided to get on the trail. Everyone was kind of packing up and getting underway. I started moving and hiked on and off with everyone throughout the day. I went another 10 miles or so partly because I wanted to keep up with everyone. I liked bantering back and forth with Spoons and it seemed like Sharktooth could really set a pace. Of course Turtle and pup were just anomalies. I never seen someone be able to keep moving. Turtle had some serious strong legs and pup was about 11 I think. It was a joy to be hiking around others. 
We kept hiking almost until dark so we pitched our tents near a small stream about a mile north of sams gap. I camped that night up on the hill  above Turtle and Pup, Spoons, Sharktooth, PYT, Rocket, Aspen and Nash.","Uncle Johnnys Shelter

Turd Furgeson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632701,"Today was an awesome day. We climbed up the rest of the way of the first mountain and reached some amazing farmland views and balds. Oh yeah, and deer, plenty of them running about half a mile away. I hung out with the gang throughout the day and for the first time caught a little time by myself on top of Big Bald. I sat up top in the sun and at a little snack. It was really great, for the first time I kind of felt at peace. Im not really sure what it was but, that feeling of the sun on my face and looking out across the mountains I knew I would never be owned to a job again. I was free to live my life as I chose. 
Honestly, I dont remember much about this day. For these next few days, they really seem like a blur. I will say that I did find a gummy bear on trail this day. I was so hungry and it looked really sweet so I ate it. And then I got really paranoid about it being an edible. Like I said, things just became kind of hazy I guess.
Im pretty sure this day I slept in my tent and we were in a pretty big bubble. This was the day I met conductor and we sat around the camp fire for a while. It was a pretty nice time and it was definitely different than just hanging out by myself. Just what the doctor ordered.","Old overgrown forest road

Turd Furgeson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632710,"Today was a relatively easy hike into Uncle Johnny's Hostel. When I woke up in the morning, I was not sure if I wanted to stay at the hostel or continue on. One thing was for sure, I needed a new sleeping mattress. 
I noticed when I woke up that my air mattress was flat for the second time in a row. The first night I just thought maybe I did not screw the cap on tight. The next day I would find the slow leak in the seam. It was early in my hike and I really was not good at repairing my gear yet. I was going to try to but did not want to end up on the trail without a pad, so I bought a new one. I will make this note, hostels are not cheap options for purchasing gear.

I walked the six miles down the gentle slope coming of the ridge. For most of the day it was just a bunch of small ups and downs through the forest. The trees were finally starting to get some foliage. The green tunnel was just days upon us at this point. 
Luckily, I was able to reach the Hostel and caught a hitch into town. The first thing we hit up was a McDonalds.  We ate for a bit and everyone needed to resupply. I do not think I needed much because I bought some meals at the hostel that I wanted to try from Mountain House. I remember needing to go to CVS and it caused me to split from Turtle, Sharktooth and Spoons. 
I walked a long way in town all the way to where the van was going to pick everyone up at a pizza place. I made my way toward the pizza place. Would not you know it, there was a Dollar General right next door. Sometimes you waste your time a little.

We got back to the Hostel and everyone except Spoons decided to get back on the trail. I stayed at the hostel that night in a single cabin and Spoons waited for his phone to charge, then he headed out into the night. I really was not sure if I was going to continue hiking with the group. They seemed so much faster than me and were doing pretty big miles. I did not really feel I was as strong a hiker as them, so I left it to fate.","No Business Knob Shelter

Turd Furgeson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632711,"As all things that are the trail, the group decided that they were going to get into Uncle Johnnys Hostel yesterday and then use the shuttle to get into town and resupply and immediately get back on trail. I was having some aches and pains so I had decided to stay at the hostel that night and book it out the next morning. With some luck, maybe I would catch everyone the next couple days. To be honest, they all seemed so fast and I was struggling to keep up. I kind of decided to let fate answer the call.Spoons had left out late the night before after he charged his phone. I was glad he stayed for a little longer. I always enjoyed Jeffs (Spoons), company. The next morning I packed out and set out for the trail. It didnt take very long for me to catch up with the group. Surprisingly, they had only done a mile into the trail and decided to just camp out. Spoons was probably just as surprised the night before. I ended up hiking with them throughout the day and we all had a really good day. The sun was shining and it was just really nice out.We hiked about 12 miles and I reached the top of Beauty Spot, man it was something special. When I reached the top Snap was at the top taking pictures. Snap is a pretty cool dude that was from Georgia I believe. I failed to mention Snap previously because him and Coyote had kind of floated around between two groups. I got to say that this bald was just, well, beautiful.We hiked about 8 more miles and there was not that much to really see for the rest of the day. We ended up setting up on an old forest road that was no longer a road. I remember in the middle of the night two hikers hiking down the trail with their lights shining in our tents. I swear it was Tiffany and the Kid. I slept really well that night and it was the first night that it was comfortable temperatures. One funny thing did happen that night. I believe Spoons hammock split apart. I'm going to have to get in touch with him for the rest of that story. (I did) Jeff slept on the ground with an improvised tarp tent.

Turd Furgeson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/632979,"Wow, today was no easy day. A couple of things happened today. I sprained my ankle so severely that it swelled up the size of a grapefruit. The group was with me when it happened and I think it was Sharktooth and Spoons that seen it roll and disappear under my ankle. I broke this ankle a couple years prior to this and I kept fracturing it every now and again. The amazing thing is that it was during a 23 mile day. Im not sure how I made it, but maybe we should go through the events of the day. Me, Turtle and Pup were talking pretty much throughout the day. The first thing we passed was the Greasy Creek Friendly. It was kind of funny because we got there and nobody was there. The only thing I really wanted to do was use their privy but we hung out a while to see what resupply options they had. Pup was also kind of chilling out, since they had water there, it was a good spot. We kept on moving after a while, and started up towards Roan Mountain. After a few miles down and some pretty easy sailing we made it to the Cloudland Hotel Site. You know you have made it there because you come to a fireplace with the chimney still intact. Its funny that I remember this day because it was pretty dreary, very wet and cold. We get up to this point on the mountain and we met another hiker that had all of his clothes and equipment color coordinated. In all honesty and no offense, but it was hideous.We finally get to the top of Roan Mountain and meet up with Airbud, Gummy Bear, and a few other hikers. As we are sitting in the shelter the conversation turns to another hiker that was kind of a difficult person to be around. Anyway some of the folks in my group started changing his trail name to something even less flattering than my own lol. Anyway, what we didn't know was this guy was actually in the loft of the shelter. He had closed the door in the floor so nobody could go up there and sleep when he was in there. Yeah, dont be that guy or gal. Anyway, I think he thought it was me because I didnt back down to his condescending comments one day.We finished eating lunch and made  our way down the mountain. I was leap frogging back and forth with Gummy Bear for the rest of the day. I got down the mountain to Carvers Gap and came out to the  open pastures and balds. It was such a nice warm feeling being out of the rain, and the sun came out that I decided to lay out in the grass and catch some warmth on my face. I went over Round, Jane and Grassy Ridge Balds. Coming down the mountain I managed to roll my ankle to  the point I feared I may need to go see a doctor. I managed to walk down past Stan Murray Shelter and get to Overmountain Shelter. I decided I would get there, take some pain meds and see what happened with my ankle. I laid out my spot in the loft of the Barn. Surprisingly my mood was pretty good aside from the pain. I hung out with the gang while we watched it rain throughout the rest of the evening. I was feeling pretty confident by bedtime I could wrap it up and walk, besides, Station 19E was only about 9 miles away. I would have to at least get there.","Side of some mountain road

As a whole we were all trying to start doing 20 mile days. That was the plan for today, mother nature had something in store for us that did not align with our plans.I remember packing up everything in the morning and it looked pretty miserable. I peeked out the loft and snapped a quick pick from the top, climbed down the ladder and ate a little breakfast on the table down below. Airbud and Gummy Bear were down there and I was kind of trying to hobble my way out of camp. The ankle did not hurt and I walked up the slope towards little hump and hump balds. The weather had turned for complete garbage. The winds brought in the low creeping grey and black clouds. As the clouds came in darker the winds picked up. I can say that the winds were probably as bad as what I experienced in Iraq. We got to the top, I cant even tell you which one but the winds were easily 50 to 60 knots sustained. A few of us were knocked off our feet from the gusts walking on the sloppy trail. I remember a girl trying to coax her dog to keep walking. Eventually she picked the pup up and carried it. I did not see her again.Once we bounced our way down the mountain we came upon Dolly Sods. This is where the sign for NOBOs who are leaving North Carolina for good. Myself, Spoons and Sharktooth reluctantly snapped a couple quick photos in the rain and moved on.I talked to Spoons and Sharktooth and we figured it best to find a hostel. Turtle and Pup were ahead of us and decided to go to one of the other hostels. We ended up going to the Station at 19E. Of course, someone had donated us a beer, we got a bunk and washed and dried our clothes out and watched game of thrones for a while.Oh boy,  you will never guess who showed up that night...The Snorlax. He ended up of course, hiking in late and he had reserved a bunk. Unfortunately his bunk was under Sharktooths, of course he offered everyone earplugs, of course nobody slept.We woke up the next morning, ate some breakfast and things began to look better.

After yesterdays adventure I was really hoping for some good weather. Besides, we just passed one of the highest peaks on trail in Roan Mountain and warmer days had to be on the horizon.We got up and had a quick breakfast, hung around outside the hostel for a while and waited for our shuttle back to the trail. We had to do some climbing starting out but it wasn't too much of a climb. My ankle was feeling much better and the sun had came out. It was still a little chilly, I noticed I was still wearing gortex gloves just to keep the dampness off my hands as I would move through overgrown brush. We walked through a lot of meadows and then found our way sweeping around a rather large cemetery. It was the first large one that I recalled seeing. There were going to be a lot of waterfalls to see through this section and Jones and Laural Falls would be seen today and tomorrow. As we approached Jones Falls we walked upon the 400 mile sign. It was strange to think that it was so hard walking the first four hundred miles. It seemed like after that we could whip off 100 miles rather quickly. We snapped some pictures and the three of us continued down the path. We took a great photo on the side of a mountain that had a wood bench. Moonshine, Airbud, Gummy Bear, Sharktooth and Spoons were moving right along and we hiked for another 10 or so miles down the path.We ended up meeting Redneck (Germany), Up Dawg, Sandwich Child (Kentucky). We followed them for a while but really didnt talk too much that day. I have been to Germany a few times and spent a pretty good amount of time traveling Europe. I hate to put anyone in a certain catagory, but Redneck was definitely a young German male who seemed to embrace the club persona. This was just my take and I really enjoyed being around him. He was definitely a really funny guy. I nearly busted out laughing once when he told me I had a sexy belly. I didnt know at the time if i should be flattered or uncomfortable. After all, I had lost about twenty pounds by now. We slept on the saddle tent site and Cowboy, Up Dawg and Sandwich Child set up a 100 yards away from me, Sharktooth, Spoons and Moonshine.

We had more waterfalls today, we were walking into a hostel and there was a beach at the lake. What more could you ask for...how about warmer weather. In all the hiking was relatively easy today. We hiked downhill for much of the day and we only had one major climb before we got to the hostel. After a couple hours we made it to Laurel Falls. I remember Spoons saying that he enjoyed this section so much that he wanted to bring his girlfriend back when he was finished. He mentioned that he was keeping a list of his favorite spots he wanted to share with her. The waterfall was pretty, not all that tall, but impressive because of its width and power. The swimming hole would have been perfect if it was maybe May, but the running river was just a bit too cold. We took a snack and then headed up and over the mountain.It was a long 3 mile downhill slope into the hostel in Hampton TN. We got there just in time to set up a spot, go to the beach, and catch the shuttle to the gas station for some food. We decided at the hostel just to set up on one tent pad because if we all squeezed in it would be cheaper. We found a spot and since we were cowboy camping all three of us fit on the same spot.We cleaned up a little then walked down to the lake. Redneck, Up Dawg and Sandwich Child arrived shortly later. I think we were the only clowns to jump in the water that day, it was definitely cold. We really didnt stay long at the beach, really we just wanted to get some snacks and hang out. The hostel was good and I would recommend it to anyone. As always the drivers can be a little ""animated"" but overall a good experience and the camp store was well stocked.Did I mention I was cowboy camping? It was the first time on trail I deliberately set up without my tent and I immediately fell in love with it.

Me and Sharktooth never seemed to have a problem getting up early but Spoons liked to take his time. Leaving early had its benefits because if there was something cool to do like swim, there wasn't a huge trade-off with miles. Looking back I dont know that Sharktooth was an early person, but I think she bought into my reasoning. Today was a pretty uneventful day. In fact, this was one of those days that didn't really pop out of my mind except for the dam. You start off walking around the dam toward the old shelter site. I don't even think Guthooks has it in its data anymore. The shelter was always closed because of bears. A local told me the bear was a problem because fisherman would clean their fish close to where the shelter was located. We climbed the hill up to the top of the dam and found some surveyors working. We stopped to talk with them for a few minutes and then careened up the hill.The rest of the day was just walking through what seemed like the same trees for miles until finally we came to TN 91. It was neat because we were late in the day the trail opened up to cow pastures. At the top of the pasture was a nice sized barn with the AT symbol on the side. The farmer had also cut the grass right in front of it as to say we could sleep there. In front of the barn was a cow water tank. I was not worried to filter water out of it and it made a great water source. With the barn right behind us and nice weather I wanted to camp out in front of the barn and everyone was happy to stop for the day. Tomorrow we would be a great day!","Boots Off Hostel

We woke up early were ready for a big 22 mile day. The hiking wasn't going to be hard but it would be a long day and weather was about to turn for the worse. 
Oh, I almost forgot. So with all the monotony of hiking there are little landmarks or waypoints that become important during a thru hike. Of course the some of  the biggest are reaching town, hitting 100 mile increments or getting your first 20, 25 or 30 mile day. One of the benchmarks was going to take place in about 18 miles and that was hitting the TN/VA border crossing! That's right folks, we are getting out of our 3rd state and Starting Virginia today!
We hiked throughout the day with many small ups and downs. Our pace was getting pretty good but we were so excited to get to VA. Spoons and Sharktooth were ahead of me and they made it to the sign first. When I arrived they were already playing the final countdown, so of course I had to dance across the state line.
We took a few pics together to document our accomplishment, which at the time may be only amazing to us lol. We still had three or four miles to go to get into Damascus and I had a surprise arriving the next morning. Sarah and the kids were going to meet me for the Easter weekend.
So that second thing that happened when we came down the 3 miles of mountain into the the trail town of Damascus. I had never been here so I had no idea  what to expect. We came out of the woods to find someone's backyard and a street. You should have seen the looks on our face. There were no blazes to be found, oh wait, yeah there is. So we looked for trees with blazes, looked on the ground for them on the pavement, nothing. Then we looked to our left and across the way was the arches entering Damascus. We kind of got a laugh about that. So with making it to Damascus I reached my benchmark, a new map on my Guthooks app. I would no be leaving Standing Bear to Damascus and following the Southern VA Map! I know, you're thinking big accomplishment. I learned a couple good things in the military, tactical patience and small victories!
We walked through town and Trail Town USA is a really cool town. We got to the old Mill Hotel and ate some food and went up to the room. Since I was staying there for the weekend and Sarah and the kids wouldn't be there until tomorrow, Spoons and Sharktooth crashed with me in the room until my family came, then they went to a hostel where Gummy Bear and Airbud were staying at.
They say if you make it to Damascus you can probably make it all the way. I would have to say this is pretty accurate. Out of our group only one person made it to Damascus that didn't go all the way. I wasn't out of the woods yet, but I was getting there.","Open Pastures with Barn

The kids had a great time and unfortunately with all the rain in the forecast we didn't get to go out and explore like we wanted too. I think if I go back with the kids I will definitely check out the Creeper Trail. Sundog Outfitters, on the outside of town has bikes that you can rent. They will take you to the top of the Creeper Trail and you coast all the way down on your bikes. It takes from 1-3 hours depending how much you stop. The trail is really nice and follows the river so there are plenty of neat spots to check out along the way.I will say this about Damascus, the food in town is great, especially on the north end of town as you are walking out. I strongly suggest getting some to go food on the way out of town, at least a subway and ice cream.","

We got up that morning and Sarah and the kids went down to the restaurant and we got breakfast real quick. She wanted to get on the road back to Fort Bragg, and honestly, we were never one for long good-byes. We both had deployed to other countries so many times it just was the way we did things. This time it was harder for me though. My son was walking around and just starting to get his 2 yr old personality. My daughter was missing me quite a bit. She had hiked with me out of Grafton Notch in Maine the year prior so she couldn't understand why she couldn't go. After seeing Coyote and Snap at the restaurant we made our way down to Sundog Outfitters. Before we went into the outfitters I remembered there was a subway nearby so I decided to pack out a sandwich and then hit the store. We went in and I debated on a different long sleeve shirt made by Outdoor Research. It was a little pricey and the last thing I probably needed was more gear. I am glad Sarah was with me because she talked me into going with the lightweight long sleeve shirt and she took my middleweight home with her. That shirt is one of my all time favorite hiking shirts. Sharktooth and Spoons left the hostel they were staying at and met up with me. I said my so longs to the family and the three of us trekked our way out of town. When leaving Damascus you pretty much follow the creeper trail which was the bike trail that I talked about  a couple days ago. It also crosses the Highway several times. The entire day I considered that I could just walk right back down the creeper trail and have Sarah come back to get me. I hiked most of the day without saying too much, this is very atypical of me because I am a huge social butterfly by nature.We walked for the 15 or so miles and honestly, it really was a nice hike. We had to cross our first major stream that didn't have a bridge. We were forced to take off our shoes because the water was up past our knees because of all the heavy rain. We decided that we were going to kind of take it easy so we got to the Lost Mountain Shelter and stayed put for the evening. Staying at the shelter was a really good time. Up Dawg, Redneck, Sandwich Child and Free were all staying there. Later on in the day a few more hikers showed up and pitched their tents. A few actually stayed in the shelter that night. I decided to put up the tent because there were so many good spots. I remember this evening really well because as we were all eating dinner the sun was going down. The mountain we would climb the next morning became the color of fire. It was really amazing because the next morning when the sun came up the mountain looked like any other mountain. Seeing that mountain was definitely one of the first ""gifts"" that the trail provided me with. I never seen anything like it, or maybe it was the first moment I took the time to actually slow my life down and notice the beauty of the world.Something actually pretty funny happened that night. We were all going to bed down and some of the others were being kind of loud having a great time. It was only about 730 and we still had a little bit to go before hiker midnight. Apparently someone in their tent didnt appreciate our good time and yelled out of their tent for us to shut up in a not so quiet tone. We all wondered if it was Free, but Free was a really cool dude and wouldn't act that way. Looking back I think it may have been another guy that was there that didnt have a very good reputation on the trail. It didnt matter, we laughed it off because we were about to be in pony country in the Grayson Highlands.","Damascus

Turd Furgeson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633120,"Wow, its amazing how one day can change your entire outlook. Yesterday I was ready to go home, but I kept telling myself, hike then sleep, then make the decision. I woke up feeling great and today was going to be awesome. The entire day was full of motivation, we were hitting 500 miles, ponies and Fat Man Squeeze.We started off the day our usual way. It is pretty much wash, rinse and repeat everyday. That is the hardest part of the mental game. Waking up and deflating the air mattress was always the hardest thing to do. What made it worse was it always seemed like the air mattress was mocking me as the air hissed out of the release valve and I would feel the lumpy ground beneath me. That was enough for me to get up and eat breakfast every morning.I always ate breakfast in the morning and 90 percent of the time it was ramen noodles with a breakfast bar and coffee. I loved the ramen because it was like instant warmth in the morning and I love soups. It also has a high amount of salt which I always felt help keep me hydrated. I don't know, its kind of like the Army telling me all I ever needed was Motrin and water, it's just the way I am wired now.We got moving and quickly got up the mountain. I walked alot with Sharktooth during the day, I think Spoons was probably having phone issues or something and said he would catch up. We didn't get too far ahead because we kind of thought we would stay in a hostel and watch the Stars and Blues play in the playoffs. Spoons was a Stars fan and I grew up on the Blues. Oh, Sharktooth was a Bruins fan which would make for some tense times in the coming couple weeks lol. We got to Buzzard Rock and it was really cool being on the fire red mountain from the previous day. We went about another four miles and ate luch at the Elk Garden, VA 600. There is a parking lot with a privy there. We thought it would be a great place to dump trash because it had a hardened bathroom/privy. We ate lunch and was disappointed to see the privy full of trash. Apparently the locals use this place to party and don't take their trash with them. We were getting close to the Grayson Highlands and the ponies were just up the hill. When we did our zero I brought my kids up to see the ponies. They were very friendly and we had a great time. Im probably going to say something unpopular but I did not like the ponies. When we made it to Thomas Knob Shelter there were about 4 ponies up there. We set our stuff down so we could take pictures. That is when my experience changed. One of those dumb ponies picked up my trekking pole in his mouth and took off with it. I had to chase that pony around the shelter to get it back. It makes a funny story but I was in no mood to do side miles to get back my trekking poles lol. Staying at the shelter would have been great, but they were closing the shelter due to an aggressive bear. It didn't matter we had a more important goal, 500!Everyone was pumped and I would be lying if I said we weren't singing the Proclaimers the entire way. It was pretty cool because we got to the marker and took several pics. Someone had made a small marker and we thought that was it until we went up a little further. In the middle of the meadow someone had made a really good marker so we used it and deleted all the other photos and did the whole routine again.I tried to keep the motivation up by randomly yelling fat man squeeze over the next mile which I'm sure was a little annoying. We made it through the rock crevice and made our way to  Massie Gap. We called the shuttle and they picked us up by the privies. The Grayson Highlands General Store provided us with a room with laundry and we ate so much good food there. It was a really good experience. We had a few beers with Happy and D20 who we had met earlier, then went in to watch the game. Me and Spoons were pretty disappointed when the game wasn't televised after we thought it would be.","Lost Mountain Shelter

Turd Furgeson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633122,"I took no pictures today. That should tell you something about todays hike. We got back out on trail and it seemed like we leapfrogged with Happy and D20 all day. It was kind of weird because we would stop for a second and they would just end up passing us, then we would pass them. It was kind of wet from the recent rains still and the clouds were a bit overcast. It almost made walking through the rest of the Highlands look like something out of an Edgar Allen Poe book. 
We crossed quite a few streams throughout the day but nothing really stood out. We were just making our way without really making any plans. I almost want to apologize for not saying anything great about today, but sometimes the trail is like that I guess.","Massie Gap

Turd Furgeson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633124,"I have been worried about my shoes lately because I have a huge hole in the front left shoe. I have done what I can to tape it up but they have had it. I woke up this morning knowing we would be going into Marion, all I would have to do is get there before they fell apart. 
I can say that this day may have been our fastest paced day on the trail. Our plan was to get to Partnership Shelter and check it out, maybe get some pizza delivered. When we seen that the Mt Rogers HQ was actually a museum with snacks and it was right next to the shelter, we changed our minds. For some reason that day I was just in a really up tempo mood. I remember looking at my watch and realizing that we were actually hiking about 3.2 miles per hour. It seemed like the miles were getting easier and at this point I wasn't worried about the condition of my shoes. We reached the shelter and hung out briefly to check out all of its amenities. This shelter had a shower and a phone to call for pizza. We went to the Rec HQ and waited for them to open while we soaked up some sun and rested our feet.
We went in the shelter and bought some snacks and then hung out outside and waited for a shuttle that would take us into town. The shuttle arrived and we loaded up and went to Walmart. We were pretty hungry so I went in and before resupplying I went to the deli and bought a bunch of fruit. I was always craving citrus and fruits on Trail, slushies would become my trademark. I took my fruit outside in front of the automatic doors and just started devouring the fruit. This is kind of one of the definitions of Hiker Trash that I had started to embrace. Sharktooth came out and I shared some of the melon and then went in to resupply. 
While inside I met Pony Keg for the only time. I will never forget him because he was wearing a blue onesie with green martians on it. He was incredibly pleasant and such a nice guy. Unfortunately  I never seen him after that, but we did take up his mantra of yelling from the mountain tops from time to time. After I resupplied I went to the shoe store and made one of the dumbest decisions on trail. I bought a pair of waterproof Merrill boots because they were really the only hiking shoe I could find. I would find out tomorrow that they were more uncomfortable to hike in than having your toenails pulled out. 
After I got finished at the shoe store we decided to eat and Sharktooth had never been to Sonic. Me and Spoons walked over with Sharky and we sat down on the picnic tables and engorged ourselves on shakes and burgers. We finished eating and headed back over to Walmart to catch the shuttle back to the trail. We still  had a few miles to go on the day and it was really a great day to be hiking. We were really setting ourselves up for a nice gentle downhill for the first part of the morning.","Tentsite near Raccoon Creek Campground

Turd Furgeson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633127,"Before I start todays journal I would like to thank anyone that is reading this journal. What started off as something for others to read has turned into something way more internal for me. This experience of writing has triggered so many good memories that I had forgotten about. I am very thankful that I have came back two years later to write about my experience. Another thing I would like to pass on is this, dont take so many pictures of the horizon. I mean take the pictures, but take pictures of the people on trail. Looking back, I have tons of pics of mountains that many just look the same. It will be the people that you are around that will make the memories. I got this advice from another thru hiker, ""Lumberjack"" class 2003. I wish I would have gotten it before my thru on the AT, but I will definitely carry it forward when I do the PCT.
This morning we had really set ourselves up for a nice gently up with a long 3 miles or so down into a really cool place on trail. The VA 615 Settlers Museum sits next to an old school. If you go inside their should be boxes full of Trail Magic. The school is really neat and has some fun reading on the inside. We sat on the front porch for quite a while with Aspen, Rocket, PYT, Nash, Buscuits, and Free. 
After a while we decided to take off and found ourselves walking through many meadows and cow fields. It kind of funny to walk through a pasture of cows again. I have not done that in many years. No matter the gap in years, my memory reminded me to look for the bull. We continued on pretty excited for what lay ahead. We still had some gentle rolling hills but at around lunchtime we made it to US11 where the Barn Restaurant is. We had a really good lunch and there was a lot of hikers in there so we all kind of mingled around each other.
We finished up and walked down the highway and jumped back on trail. We did a lot more hiking that day and the stretch of terrain was getting a little steeper. We passed a cemetery and finally made it to VA RTE 42. There is a pavilion there and I really wanted to camp there but I guess it is owned by a church and they dont allow hikers to sleep around it. Turned out to be a good place because we were about to get wet. We decided to hike up a bit into the wood line and actually found a good place to set up next to a creek. I was pretty happy with the set up until I noticed that I failed to see the poison ivy on the ground. After I walked down to get some water I realized what I had done. I guess time will tell if I get it since I am pretty allergic to it. About an hour later Free showed up and we all chatted for a while. He was a pretty cool dude and I was glad we had the chance to talk. He had hiked the trail a couple times, i think he roughnecked and worked fishing boats for a while. You meet quite a few people like this that work then hike, maybe work at a hostel for a while then hike again. This would be the last time we seen Free.","campsite just past USFS 86, Glade Mtn Road

Turd Furgeson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633168,"Man we got wet last night. The tents kept us dry but none of my clothes dried out last night, my tent was soaked on the outside and it just keeps raining. We talked from inside our tents and decided to maybe go back to the pavilion to try and dry some of our things out and contemplate our next move. We thought about just sleeping under the shelter and zeroing there but there was a hostel just up the road. We didn't want to stay in a hostel but the weather was supposed to be just awful and with everything soaked we decided why not. 
After we packed up our gear after we went to the pavilion to dry our stuff we waited for the weather to break a little. It finally did and we booked it up the state road to the Bear Garden Hostel. This was a pretty good place and they had nice comfortable furniture in the bunkhouse. We were able to take a shower and dry all our stuff out. It was a great time hanging out and just relaxing. The rain didn't pick up again until later so who knows, it might not have been too bad out there. My mind often drifted that day wondering how Free was doing in the rain.
Happy and D20 showed up a little later and we all just hung out with a couple section hikers. Overall it was a great experience.","

Turd Furgeson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633169,"We woke up in the Hostel refreshed and ready to go. I knew we had a pretty good climb coming out of the gap and after checking Guthooks, we had quite a few ups and downs today. The climbs weren't too steep but they were going to be long. 
We followed the river for a little bit and than began the climb. The first shelter of the day was only a short distance so we wouldn't be eating lunch at this one. The one we were looking to eat at was the Chestnut Knob Shelter. It was on a significant mountain top with a hardened structure shelter at the top. I was glad we were shooting for this one because we would put ourselves there around lunchtime and the unofficial rule was to try to get 10 before noon and everything after that is gravy. The knob was right around 10 miles away.
We continued up the switchbacks up and down several times until we hit the long ascent up to the shelter. On the way to the shelter we were making our way up a nice little climb and I noticed a Fairy Village in the middle of nowhere. This was the second time this had happened to me. Some people complain about the Leave No Trace principles and people setting up villages along the trail or making rock gardens. Me personally, I enjoyed seeing them. As I walked those hundreds of miles I enjoyed seeing things that break up the monotony. I always found them to be enchanting. We continued along and passed several streams with big bridges so we were able to camel up before starting. There was also a pond almost prior to getting to the top so water would not be an issue for making lunch. The pond was really kind of peaceful. You come out of the woods to a bald that seems to keep going to the heavens. While looking up it was as if the perfect blue sky was going to swallow up the darkening green shades of grass that lay ahead in the sun.
I passed the pond and made my way to the top. It was really great getting to the top because I got to see some people that I hadn't seen in a while. When we finally reached the shelter Snap was already sitting at the top and then Ranger, who I met at the shelter in NC with the snorelax, reached the top. It was such a great reunion to see everyone. We started to eat lunch after reading the shelter journal to see who and when hikers had passed by. While making lunch Up Dawg, Sandwich Child and Redneck showed up. 
The rest of the day was relatively easy. We started down the long winding road (get it, song reference) to the bottom for another 10 miles where we reached Jenkins Shelter. I don't remember if anyone camped with us here this night but VA always seemed to have section hikers everywhere, and boy scouts lol.","Bear Garden Hostel

Turd Furgeson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633240,"Oh man did I tell  you my feet are killing me? The shoes I got in Marion are horrible, my feet have swelled up in them and I am getting blisters. This is something new to me as I have never had blisters on my feet before. I joined the Army in 1997 and did 23 years in those old leather boots and never got blisters. That is how bad these boots fit me. I learned a valuable lesson this week, go to Walmart and get some cheap sneakers until you can get to an outfitter. Don't waste money on boots that you are uncomfortable with. The picture kind of says it all here with my camp shoes on.
I was really struggling to walk and today would end up being almost 16 miles. I think Sharktooth and Spoons are taking pity on me with my jacked up boots. Enough about the complaining, today is going to be a fun day, even through the pain. Following the golden rule of 10 before noon is going to work out perfect again for us today. In exactly 10 miles we will be walking around Bland and the Dairy Queen and gas station. I have passed through this offramp on the interstate several times. I never thought it would hold so many good memories.
We hiked the ten miles and walked along the road to the DQ. There was a Hotel across the street, I'm not going to lie, it was looking pretty good with my feet the way they were. It was just too early in the day and we were coming up on some bigger towns where I could get to an outfitter. Remember when I said I was starting to crave slushies? Well, this is where the two slushy at the gas stations started happening. To this day two years later I still get the Cherry Slushy as a side to my blizzards lol.
Ranger showed up a little while later we kind of waited around with him. We were all kind of discussing the probability of catching a hitch back to the trail. Before we finished, Ranger went over to a guy and asked for a ride. At first he didn't seem too thrilled about the idea. After some persuading, Ranger waved us over. The gentleman, who looked like a mountain man all his life motioned to the 9mm pistol on his hip. He told us he was to old to fight us and if we tried to mug him he would just shoot us first. I thought that was fair so we accepted his terms and caught a ride back to the trail. 
We walked for another 5 miles in pretty good spirits. We made it to a tentsite after a pretty easy day of hiking aside from my feet. I always kind of remembered southern VA as a little more gentle with the rolling hills and ridges. Things were going to be getting a little more difficult for the next couple hundred miles but 600 miles and Pearisburg was on our horizon.","Jenkins Shelter

Turd Furgeson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/633333,"This stretch of Virginia has been pretty rough not because of the trail but because of these shoes. In fact, the terrain was going to be pretty easy aside from one or two 1000 ft climbs but they would be pretty mild. I know I am sitting here complaining a lot but boy do they hurt. 
We broke camp like we always do pretty early. Today was going to be a really good day aside from the pain in my feet, oh, and I was holding out to see the dentist in Pearisburg. My bridge had become dislodged and I would need to have it glued back in. It was funny because it was so loose that I started sleeping without it because I feared I may swallow it in my sleep.
We walked for just over an hour when we hit our first milestone of the day, the 600 mile marker. Again we took several pics and went on our way. It's funny the things you will see on trail. As we were hiking up our first major incline of the day, someone had put a sign on a tree that no Jet Ski's were allowed. It is funny the things we walk past in regular life and not give a second look. Here we are in the middle of the woods taking pictures with a No Jet Ski sign that would probably not get that second look back in our non-trailer trash lives.
The morning was passing us by and with the relatively easy hiking we were going to make it to Trent's Grocery. We made it to VA 606 when we came out of the woods to the highway at the bottom of the hill. We were going to have to do about a half mile sideways miles (Unofficial additional miles) to get to Trent's. We followed the HWY around the long curve toward a mill. The logs were lined up along the road and a truck was about to pull in to the mill. The road followed a creek and I wondered how easy it would be to just get a raft and just float our way back to the trail after we ate.We finally got to Trent's and there were a few locals inside. We went in and checked out the grocery. I am not sure if Sharktooth expected to see a gas/deli/gun/autoshop all in one. We ordered some food and took a bench next to a couple of the locals. They were very friendly and we chatted them up until we were finished. With full bellies we walked the 8 remaining miles to the Wapiti Shelter. The rest of the day was pretty uneventful. The good thing about the rest of the day was the many water sources along the way. We would not have to camel any water today.","tentsite

Once we got to the top of the ridge it was going to be some pretty smooth sailing. We were going to be heading into Pearisburg which was fantastic. We were moving pretty good despite my feet but just before lunch we made it to Doc's Knob Shelter. We decided to check it out and my feet needed a break anyway.
When we got to the shelter we noticed a really nice deck on it. I dont remember if we ate there but we did come up on another hiker that we had seen a few times before. We lounged around on the chairs and benches in the sun. It was starting to warm up more and the sun always felt really good on the balds and ledges. 
We continued on towards town. We got to the Pearis ledges and met a hiker named Flatlander. He was sitting on top with his dogs. When we walked up they weren't leashed and they seemed very aggressive. I was kind of upset that he only replied they were friendly, when clearly they were upset. We moved on down the trail until we got to Angels Rest. The ledge overlooked the the small town and it was pretty cool to walk into a town instead of getting a shuttle. We would get to know Flatlander and his GSP pretty well over the next couple weeks. He turned out to be a pretty good guy.
On the way down the mountain we made note of our priorities. First would definitely be getting slushies and ice cream at the DQ that we would walk past. Next, we would need to find a place to stay. Luckily for us, that was on the corner of the street next to the DQ. It really is funny the places you will sleep in just to get a hot shower and laundry. Once we got laundry done we would meet up with some of the other hikers that just made it into town. They were staying at a hotel just down the street. The last two things that needed to happen would be getting food resupply, and getting to a dentist. Oh yeah, did I mention new shoes, Im sure I did.Another good reason to stay in Pearisburg was because the Blues were still playing the Stars and both Spoons and I wanted to watch the game. We got everything taken care of that we needed to take care of and decided to check out the Mexican Buffet across the street. When we got there we met up with Snap, PYT, Aspen, Nash, Rosie and Chipper. It was really great conversation and just a really good time. The food was great by the way. After we went to the buffet we went to the market and did a quick resupply. It was kind of weird because the place was so empty.","Wapiti Shelter

I went with spoons to the rental car place and picked it up as soon as they opened. We drove back to the hotel and I have to admit, it felt weird driving. We all three drove the 30 minutes to Blacksburg right past Virginia Tech and into a shopping center. I went to the shoe store first thing and settled down to a pair of Salomon's. I also got a watch because I was tired of getting out my phone to see what time it was. It actually turned out to be a great purchase because the hands on it were very well illuminated at night.We finished up at the outfitter and headed over to the steakhouse. We decided to eat a final nice meal with Spoons since he would be departing us soon to go back to Texas for a wedding. We finished up and headed back to the hotel. Yesterday I had set up my dentist appointment but they wouldn't be able to get me in until tomorrow. That was part of the reason for the zero and to get shoes for me and set up Spoons travel plans. We had the rest of the day to do nothing, so I thought.After walking around in the Salomon's, I wanted to change out the speed laces in them with a more comfortable pair. What I didn't know was those shoes are specifically designed to only use their own speed laces. I would spend the next couple hours going back and paying for replacement laces. That was not fun.","

There were so many wonderful trail angels out there, I am so grateful for helping us, however, I didn't do well getting the names or photos of these folks. I hope to change that on future hikes. Which leads me to our morning. Sharktooth was going to get an early start and hike alone for the morning so Spoons said he would come with me to the dentist and return the rental car.
We coordinated with Sharktooth when we would probably catch up and then drove to the dentist. When I got there the dentist took me back and started talking to me about the trail. He was really nice and was definitely a country guy. He cleaned everything up and cemented the bridge back in and we talked for a few minutes more about hunting. When I got up I asked him if I could just pay cash up front. He told me not to worry about it, the glue was cheap and it was his way of helping a thru hiker. He did my dental work for free. Remember when we talked about ""spiritual gifts"" on trail, this was definitely one of those moments.
Me and Spoons took the car back to the rental car place and the employee then kindly drove us to the trailhead. Me and Spoons walked along the highway and across the bridge leaving town. We meandered our way under the overpass and across the highway and up the mountain. I remember this distinctively because the trail was really taking us for a loop. 
We started up the mountain and as luck would happen, it started raining. We hiked all the way to the top in the rain, then just as we got to the open bald next to Rice Field Shelter. When we walked over to  the shelter, Sharktooth was hanging out, waiting out storm. We hung out for a little while, snapped some photos and talked about some folks on the trail.
We were reading in the trail journal that one of the hikers had gotten drunk and hiked up the mountain, became belligerent, and started urinating in the shelter. As I said before, word quickly spreads through the hiker community. With the use of guthooks, trail logs and FB/Inst, word gets around.","Pearisburg
