Day 2 (24.7 miles) - 3.8 miles north of PGFSP to PA Route 11. 
I pushed a bit too hard for the first time out. I felt fine on day one and completed the 23.3 miles several hours before nightfall. Near the end of day two my legs and feet were getting tired/sore and I had blisters on the lower part of both heels. Here again I finished a big mileage day several hours before nightfall.

GaitKeeper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614013,"Started out with the intention of covering 56 miles in 3 days. It did not work out exactly that way. 
Day 1 (22 miles) - Started my trek at 0600 when my awesome wife dropped me off at the intersection of PA 944 and the AT. It is an approximate 1.8 mile hike to the top of the mountain where the AT intersects the northern terminus of the Tuscarora Trail. Stealth camped near the Warner Loop trail spur a couple of miles north of Flat Rock Vista. This day totally beat the heck out of my feet as at least half of the days miles were rock scrambling. 
Day 2 (13.5 miles) - Stormed a bit overnight but my oversized hex rainfly kept my hammock and I dry and comfortable. A nearby whippoorwill decided that it was going to do it’s best to see that I did not get a good nights sleep. It succeeded! I am considering including a set of ear plugs with my gear. My feet were really sore and had started to blister on the balls of both feet during yesterday’s rock scrambling so I knew this may cause me to terminate my trip early. About 5 miles into my day I met up with my wife and sister at the intersection of Route 233 near Colonel Denning State Park. They intended to do a few mile out-n-back hike with me as I continued southward. The climb up from 233 turned out to be a bit more than they had bargained for so we bid farewell as they headed back to the car. I continued on for another 7.5 miles until I decided that the blisters on my feet had gotten painful enough that it would be wise to call it quits. I contacted my wife and she picked me up where the trail intersects with Cowpens Road.
I am a bit frustrated and disappointed in myself and am going to have to figure out how to prevent these blisters from happening during my AT SoBo hike.",,View Entry,"May 18, Sat",0
GaitKeeper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614750,"Started out with the intention of covering the next 44 miles of the Tuscarora Trail in 3 days, picking up from where I left off on Shakedown Hike 2. Just like Shakedown Hike 2 it did not work out quite that way. 
Day 1 (7 miles) - My wife dropped me off at Cowpens Road at 3:00 in the afternoon and decided to hike the first couple of miles with me which I really appreciated. We shared the trail for about 2 miles until she turned around to return to the car as I continued on the additional 5 miles to my destination of Fowler Hollow Shelter which is where I planned to spend the night. Arriving in Fowler Hollow I found that there had recently been a very high velocity wind occurrence because there were dozens of trees of all sizes uprooted and blocking the trail in many places. Two of the fallen trees barely missed the Shelter. Anyone who had been in this area when this occurred would have certainly feared for their lives. Fortunately for me it was a calm evening and I took advantage of the Shelter. No need to hang my hammock tonight. 
Day 2 (18 miles) - Up an on the trail at daylight and had to continue to deal with uprooted trees blocking the trail for quite some time. Made progress frustratingly slow. As I climbed up out of the hollow and left the devastation behind I soon came upon my next challenge. Unlike the AT the Tuscarora is not maintained nearly as well so I spent a large portion of the rest of the day busting through waist high grass, weeds and poison ivy. This also made progress frustratingly slow and very dangerous as there were lots of rocks hidden amongst the grass which were impossible to see. Did I mention the ticks? Needless to say, I made it to my goal for the day but decided that I had had enough of the Tuscarora Trail and cut my plans short once again. Future shakedowns will be done on the AT.
For those that may not be familiar with the Tuscarora Trail, it is a 252 mile trail whose southern terminus is a junction with the Appalachian Trail located in Shenandoah National Park and whose northern terminus rejoins the Appalachian Trail at the top of Blue Mountain near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. I happen to live midway between the TT and the AT in the Cumberland Valley of south/central PA.",,View Entry,"May 24, Fri",0
GaitKeeper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616153,"This shakedown hike was the one I have been waiting for. All totaled I covered just shy of 80 miles in 3 1/2 days. My body did not complain (too much), the weather was perfect (for the most part), my gear selections are working out well and I had the opportunity to meet and talk with a lot of like-minded individuals.
Day 1 (06/07/19, 11.2 miles) - My wife and I drove to the AT Conservancy Headquarters in Harpers Ferry, WV which is where this shakedown begins. We arrived there around 3:30 PM. My wife joined me for the first 20 minutes of the hike along the blue blaze trail that leads from the AT Headquarters to the AT itself and then NOBO into the touristy section of town. At this point my wife headed back to the car as I headed across the Potomac River on an old steel bridge and onto the C&O Canal Towpath. Several hours later another section hiker that I had met and I decided to call it a day at Crampton Gap Shelter. It was getting dark when we arrived so I decided to sleep in the shelter rather than hanging my hammock. All in all it was a very good first day!
Day 2 (06/08/19, 20.7 miles) - I was packed up and left the shelter at by 6:20 AM. It was another beautiful day and I stopped and had lunch while gazing at the beautiful westward view from atop the Annapolis Rocks overlook. I called it a day at 3:30 PM when I reached the Ensign Cowell Shelter. I had plenty of daylight left today to hang my hammock and socialize. Another great day on the trail. 
Day 3 (06/09/19, 24.7 miles) - Got up a bit earlier this morning and was back on the trail at 5:30 AM. I stopped at Deer Lick Shelter for lunch and had good conversation with two NOBO’s who had also stopped there to take in some calories. One of them had planned to spend the night there and have family pick her up the following morning for a week off the trail. I continued on and arrived at Rocky Mountain Shelter at 5:00 PM. Like yesterday I had plenty of daylight left to hang my hammock and socialize. It was quite windy later in the evening and I was concerned about falling branches/trees. Some rain fell during the night. Legs were a bit tired by the end of the day and had some minor blistering going on. Still another great day. 
Day 4 (06/10/19, 22.7 miles) - Back on the trail at 5:30 AM again this morning. It was eerily dark and drizzly and I had to use my headlamp for the first half hour or so. My feet got wet very quickly and I was concerned as to how they were going to handle it. I stopped at Tom’s Run Shelter for lunch and had a great conversation with two sisters that were camping at nearby Pine Grove Furnace and had decided to go on a day hike. My hat is off to them for braving the not-so-pleasant weather to be in the great outdoors. I then continued on to my final destination, the General Store at Pine Grove Furnace State Park, arriving there around 3:30 PM. My wife was unable to pick me up until 6:40 so I killed the time by sucking down a delicious cheeseburger and fries, boy was that good, and socializing with several NOBO’s and section hikers that were staying at the Ironmaster’s Mansion, right next door to the store, that evening. 
Conclusion: I gained a significant amount of confidence as a result of this section/shakedown hike. I have my gear pretty well nailed down and am fairly confident that I can manage the physical demands of day-after-day big miles on foot in the mountains. What I am not so confident about is my ability to handle the absence of my wife and family. During my shakedowns I was pretty much able to speak to my wife morning, noon and night every day. During my SOBO that is much less likely to happen, especially for the first month or so. Ouch!!",,View Entry,"Jun 07, Fri",0
GaitKeeper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616558,"There is a tremendous amount of preparation that must occur before beginning a journey such as this. My circumstances are most likely somewhat unique in that I needed to secure a day parking pass at Katahdin Stream Campground prior to heading to Maine for the start of my SoBo. Let me explain...
I am very excited that my wife, daughter and sister will be joining me for the drive from our home to Millinocket, Maine. I have reservations for two nights at the AT Lodge there, arriving Sunday evening July 30th and checking out early Tuesday morning July 2nd. Providing all goes well the four of us plan to drive our POV (Privately Owned Vehicle) into Baxter and park at the Katahdin Stream parking area early in the morning of July 1st with the intention of climbing to the summit of Mt. Katahdin and touching the sign that signifies the northern terminus of the AT. My SoBo thru-hike will begin at that point! My wife and sister doubt that their hiking fitness levels will get them to the top so they plan to hike as far up the mountain as they comfortably can and then returning to the campground. My daughter on the other hand is a young 24 year old who has been preparing herself to join me to the top. What an awesome experience that will be! On the morning of July 2nd my family will head back home and I will get a shuttle ride from the AT Lodge into the park to resume my journey southbound on the AT from Katahdin Stream Campground.
So, as you can see it was very critical for me to secure that parking pass because our plans were totally reliant on it. I had been really on edge about this for a couple of months because parking is very limited at the campground and as an out-of-state resident I could not attempt to secure a parking pass until within two weeks of my arrival date of July 1st, which was June 17th. In addition I was Informed by Baxter State Park personnel that July 1st is usually one of their busiest days because of that day being ""Canadian Day"". Undeterred I stayed up until after midnight when the date turned to the 17th to make sure that I had the best chance of getting that pass. I was successful and that was a big load off of my mind!

Even if I did I seriously doubt that I would use it because after all, what fun is there in knowing the outcome of events before they occur. Isn’t that mystery or uncertainty of what is going to happen in the future what makes our lives so interesting and really compels us to chase our curiosities?


What the heck is he talking about you might ask! Well, I am still trying to justify packing up my stuff and leaving my loved ones for a four+ month walk in the woods just to satisfy one of those curiosities. I suppose as the big day closes in I am feeling an increasingly strong sense of guilt and selfishness. I can only hope that most folks do not feel that way about me. Still, the show must go on!


I have received tons of positive encouragement, offers of support and well wishes and would like to thank everyone so much, especially my wife who is obviously the most impacted by my absence. She is my rock and has always supported me 100% even though I know that she must have conflicting feelings about all of this.

Stopped by Bennington, Vermont to see where the AT crosses highway 9 as a dry run in case my wife can meet up with me at approximately the 1/4 way point of the AT a few weeks into my journey. Had a wonderful travel day and shacked up at the Hampton Inn in Concord, NH for the night. But not before eating a great meal at Beefside Restaurant in Concord.

We arrived at the AT Lodge and checked in with the owner (Ole Man) at 12:30. I was excited that we had a lot of daylight left to explore the area.


After eating a bite at the Appalachian Trail Cafe we did some snack shopping at the local grocery store. We figured that we might need a few calories to help us summit Mt. Katahdin tomorrow. 


With plenty of time still left in the day I suggested that we take a drive to get a preview view of Mt. Katahdin from the bridge that spans over the West Branch of the Penebscot River (Abol Bridge) at Abol Bridge Campground. Abol Bridge is approximately 15 trail miles from the summit of Mt. Katahdin. The AT actually crosses over this bridge. The summit of the mountain is obscured by clouds in the photo. This is the mountain that we plan to climb tomorrow and as we were staring at it we were all thinking the same thing, “We’re going to climb that!”. Of course we have to, or at least I do because the northern most point of the AT is at the top. That is where my SoBo (Southbound) thru-hike officially begins. After enjoying the great view of Mt. Katahdin and checking out the supplies and gear that are available inside the store at Abol Bridge Campground we headed back to the lodge to get rested up for the big day that is ahead of us tomorrow. I sure hope that we can muster up the energy to get to the top.

Actually it was one of my life’s most very special moments since my wife, daughter and sister joined me. Oh my gosh am I going to miss them as they head back to PA tomorrow morning and I get shuttled back into Katahdin Stream Campground to continue my SoBo thru-hike from there. This is going to be harder than the summit!
This has gotten real and to be quite honest it scares the s**t out of me. These first few days are going to be very difficult and I am going to miss my wife, family and friends dearly.

Said some real hard goodbyes to my wife, daughter and sister this morning just before climbing into Ole Man’s van for the shuttle back to Katahdin Stream Campground in Baxter State Park. We hit the road at 6:30 AM sharp and my pack and I were headed south from the campground by 7:30.



The day went fairly smoothly. I covered the 10 miles to Abol Bridge by 11:30. This is where SoBo’s (Southbound Hikers) enter the infamous “100 Mile Wilderness” which is a remote stretch of the trail that offers no opportunities for resupply. As luck would have it the “Wilderness” decided to quickly initiate me with my first weather event of the journey. It was fairly short lived but I got pounded on with heavy rain and hail. Well, at least that is out of the way :-)
Also oddly came across a backpack and some other assorted hiking items laying right along the trail in the middle of nowhere with no owner in sight. I, and a couple of other SoBo’s that had caught up to me as I stood there pondering what to do, scanned the area and shouted out many times but got no response. A couple of NoBo’s eventually happened to pass by and they agreed to advise the folks at Abol Bridge, which was just a couple of miles north of where we were, of the situation. I certainly hope whoever’s gear it was is OK. 


Decided to call it a day at 4:30. I took a very refreshing bird bath on the shore of a beautiful pond, as Maine calls them, to get some of the crud and Deet off of my skin. Couldn’t wait to get my hammock hung and supper in my belly in order to crawl into my shelter to escape these relentless Maine mosquitoes. There are millions, no, billions of them :-)

Today went reasonably well although I was pretty spent by the time I arrived at the lean-to. I am definitely going to have to cut back on the miles for a while until I establish some stronger trail legs. The harder hiking is yet to come. It certainly helps that I have been seeing some of the most beautiful scenery that I have ever seen. 


I did not see nearly as many other hikers today as I did yesterday. I’ve been told that the NoBo bubble is still a few weeks south of where I am so I suppose it will eventually pick up for a while. I have found that it is really good to see another human being once in a while. I had hiked about 4 hours this morning without seeing a sole and it makes me feel as if I had veered off course or something. Of course the white blazes don’t lie, although at times they are hard to see/find.

I met several hikers today but the one that stands out is a 68 year old with the trail name Pilgrim. He hails from Lebanon, PA. Heck of a nice guy and very informative. He is doing a flip-flop hike. He started northbound from Harper’s Ferry and will be hiking to Mt. Katahdin, then travel to Springer Mountain and hike northbound to Harper’s Ferry.

Today was by far the toughest day I have had so far. You may have guessed that based on today’s mileage. The relatively flat miles that I hiked the first few days have now been replaced by lots of climbing and descending. White Cap Mountain and the three shorter but still significant climbs after that pretty much wiped me out so I called it a day at 1:30 in the afternoon to give my old body a chance to recover. I didn’t help that it neared 90 degrees today either. I doubt that I will be seeing any more 20+ mile days for quite a while.

GaitKeeper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618361,"Today was another tough day with several significant climbs and descents. If you are familiar with the elevation profile of the AT up here you know what I mean. And in Maine they don’t seem to believe in switchbacks. Most climbs and descents are pretty much straight up and straight down with lots of rocks and roots to add to the pleasure. I am totally surprised that my quadriceps haven’t started screaming at me yet. The weather has been unusually warm and that magnifies the challenge, at least for me because I have never performed well in the heat. Based on the forecast I suppose I better get used to it. I have also been having a tough time consuming enough calories. The combination of heat and exertion cause food to loose it’s appeal, although I try to force myself to eat as much as possible. I know that I am still left with a significant calorie deficiency every day. 


Enough of the negative stuff! All-in-all I am still enjoying the experience. If it were easy everyone would do it. I met a really nice guy who’s trail name is “Big Peach”, he’s from Georgia, today. He is also a SoBo and it turns out that we actually summited Mt. Katahdin on the same day. I was ahead of him for the first four days when the terrain was more manageable and he passed me today. Could have something to do with him being half my age and twice as tall. Unfortunately I doubt that I will see him again. 


I set up camp early again today with lots of daylight left in which I could have covered more miles. My wise wife insisted that I refrain from pushing myself too hard for the first week or so. I really don’t think I had enough left in the tank to summit another mountain anyway. 


Today I elected to take a .2 mile blue blaze side trail over to West Chairback Pond to spend the night. It appears that I may have the place to myself.

We broke camp at Wilson Valley Lean-to and headed south around 0700, which is quite late for me but I decided to hang with some other folks who prefer not to get up so early, and covered the first 7.4 miles by noon.

I’m so sorry to tell all of my family, friends and everyone else that have given me so much love, support and encouragement that I have made a decision to discontinue my trek southward on the AT. I made this decision not so much as a result of it being incredibly challenging, both physically and mentally, but more as a result of how detached I felt from those that I love and cherish at home.
The eight days that I spent on the trail were an incredible experience unlike any other outdoor adventure that I’ve had the opportunity to pursue and I do not regret one second of it. Well, maybe the one time I fell on my a**. My most cherished day on the trail by far was undoubtedly day one when my wife, daughter and sister joined me in summiting Mt. Katahdin via the Hunt Trail. Not an easy task. I am so grateful and proud of them. The remaining seven days went by very quickly but I simply felt that I had been away from home long enough.
I had the opportunity to meet many other hikers during my relatively short journey and I must say that I am fascinated at how friendly and supportive they all are of each other. Heck, I even gave my contact information to several of the folks that I got to know the best and insisted that they give me a yell when they get in my wife and I’s area a couple of months from now. I insisted that I could shuttle them to resupply or even provide them with a shower and place to sleep. I know from experience how valuable support like that can be during such a journey.
My hiking days are far from over but it is very unlikely that I will ever attempt a full thru-hike, especially of this magnitude, again. There will definitely be plenty of day hikes and possibly a multi-day section hike thrown in here and there.

It had become quickly obvious to me on my attempt to do a full thru-hike that I was just not wired to be able to spend so much time away from home.  In the weeks that have passed since my departure from the trail I have found myself frequently thinking about my time spent there and how much I enjoyed the experience. I would sometimes even awaken at night thinking of the trail and have a difficult time going back to sleep because my mind would be racing, thinking about my earlier experience and also the prospects of getting back out there again. Then an opportunity arose!


A few weeks ago my wife, daughter, son-in-law and I were invited by my sister-in-law to join them on a family weekend trip to New York City. Having not been to NYC in quite some time my first thought was “heck yes”, and my second thought was “that’s almost halfway to Monson, Maine”. So after getting a green light from my awesome wife I decided to take advantage of the head start in getting to Monson and charged ahead in preparing myself and my gear for another little adventure in the woods beginning where I left off and continuing southbound. 


So I am writing this journal entry from our private room at Shaw’s Hiker Hostel in Monson, Maine with my wife lying by my side. Tomorrow morning my wife will be driving me about 4 miles west of Monson to where the AT crosses ME 15. We will part ways there, me headed south on the AT with my primary goal of hiking approximately 180 miles to Gorham, New Hampshire (completing the state of Maine) and my wife turning around and heading back home, about 10 hours away. If that isn’t love I don’t know what is!

My first day back on the trail turned out to be a few miles longer than I had planned because I was determined to get to a point where I could contact my wife. After dropping me off just west of Monson where the AT crosses ME15 this morning she reversed direction and started the long drive back to PA. I worried about her all day and wanted to know that she made it home OK. The extra miles paid off because I was able to talk to her from the summit of Moxie Bald Mountain. The extra miles made for some pretty tired legs so hopefully my legs will be ready to go in the morning.


About midway through the day’s hike I caught up with a couple with trail names Babbles and Banjo. It quickly became evident as to how Babbles got her name. She directs so much of her energy to her vocal chords that I’m surprised she has enough left to power her legs. That wasn’t nice, forget  that I said that. Of course Banjo was just the opposite. He rarely spoke a word and when he did it was very difficult to hear him. I hiked with them for a couple of hours but most likely will not see them again as they continued on a tenth of a mile or two past the shelter I stopped at because there was no tent areas available at the shelter. They confessed that they like to sleep in in the mornings and and as everyone who knows me will agree, I like to get up and out early. 


With the extra miles I put in today I’m hopeful that I can get to the town of Caratunk tomorrow rather than my planned day of Wednesday. Maybe even get a good shower and a hot meal or two.

They had 1 room available but it had two single beds and one of them was already occupied by a female. I used their land phone to call a place quite a ways up the road called “The Sterling Inn”. It was a much larger establishment and they had a private room available. A few minutes later I was picked up and shuttled to The Sterling Inn. This place is really nice. I got a bite to eat, washed my clothes and socialized a bit. Around 5:00 a few of us got a shuttle and went to a place called “Three Rivers”. We were told that they had a really nice all-you-can-eat taco bar on Tuesday nights. It was worth the trip. 


Tomorrow I plan to continue my trek southbound but it will be a late start. Just a couple of hundred yards south of where I got off of the trail this morning is a river called “Kennebeck”. The only way to get to the other side is via a ferry service. The ferry is basically just a canoe. The service is not available until 9:00 AM. 


I have been told that cell service gets even worse as you go south so I may not be able to update my journal until I get to Stratton which will be several days from now.

Even with the late start I was able to meet my mileage goal for the day. There were only three significant climbs today and they were all under 1,000 feet of climbing. That is going to change tomorrow when I hit the Bigelow Mountains. From here on out the mountains get much taller. My legs are hurting just thinking about it!


No high alpine type views today but there were several waterfalls and lots of other beautiful scenery. 


I am happy to report that I have only seen one mosquito, the one that bit me today in a boggy area, so far on this hike. Back in July they were terrible. 


I am also happy to report that my feet are holding up really well, so far. 


I think that one of the best pieces of advice that I have heard many times is “Hike your own hike”. I mention this because of an experience I had on Monday, my first day on the trail. I was hiking along at my usual pace when this guy comes blasting by me. Naturally I picked up my own pace to match his just to see how long I could keep up with him. I came to my senses and went back to my normal pace when the guy blasted across a wide stream and soaked both of his feet. I had no desire to intentionally get my feet wet so I took the time to put my water shoes on and then cross the stream. 


Time to turn out the lights and get some sleep. Rain is pattering on my rainfly so maybe that will help me sleep well tonight.

Today’s hike came close to starting out with a big mistake. I was just about to head out of my campsite when I decided to take a look around to ensure that I wasn’t forgetting anything. Good thing I did. It was still fairly dark and as I shone my headlamp around I saw that my hammock straps were still strapped to the trees. That would have really sucked. 


My legs took a beating today with two  climbs each in the 2,000 foot range, above tree line, and a couple in the 400-600 foot range. My legs felt like jelly by the end of the day. Don’t let the 12.8 miles fool ya, it was hard! Most thru-hikers have told me that it takes several hundred miles to get good strong trail legs. Based on that I still won’t have them when I reach my exit point in Gorham, New Hampshire, assuming I make it there. The breathtaking scenery makes it all worthwhile. 


While hiking today I met a NoBo hiker who looked very familiar. Turns out that her trail name is Karma and we figured out that we had met on the AT back in June when she was passing through PA and I was out on one of my shakedown hikes. How cool.


Heading in to my second trail town tomorrow. Looking forward to a little rest.

I woke up before my 5:00 AM alarm this morning and decided to pack up and dawn my headlamp for a pre-dawn start. What I thought would be an easy 5 mile hike, mostly downhill, into Stratton turned into a challenging descent of about 2,000 feet over very technical terrain. I am very surprised that my quads and joints aren’t crying in agony by now but they seem perfectly fine, so far. 


Today would be considered what thru-hikers call a “Nero” which is an abbreviation for “Near Zero”. I did a few miles this morning but fell way short of a full day of hiking. 


My day in Stratton has been spent pigging out on a big breakfast at the Flagstaff General Store, getting a good hot shower, washing all of my clothing (the hostel provides loaner clothes so you can wash everything), going to Fotters Market across the street for food resupply, devouring an amazingly good 8 ounce wolf burger at the White Wolf Inn next door with a few really super nice north bounders (Frodo, Manifest and Sir Mead), updating my journal, chatting with many other hikers and communicating with my loved ones. All-in-all a pretty darn good day. 


I plan to buy breakfast as early as possible tomorrow morning and then get shuttled about 5 miles back to the trail head. From there I immediately have a 3,000 foot climb to the top of North Crocker Mountain. My next town stop will be Rangeley which is about 32 rough and tough miles to the south.

Got on the trail a bit late this morning, at least for me, because my shuttle driver opted to stay out late last night partying and singing karaoke at a local bar. I cut him some slack because he is a really nice guy. Besides, I still made it to my designated shelter with plenty of time to spare before nightfall.


I’m not going to get overly optimistic and assume I am getting my hiker legs already but my legs did feel considerably stronger today. I did a total of about 5,200 feet of elevation gain today over three pretty big mountains. Technical, steep Maine mountains. I’m thinking it may have had something to do with the two 470 calorie Krispy Kreme glazed cinnamon swirl cakes and a couple of chugs of Papa Smurfs Bull energy drink I consumed just before being dropped off at the trailhead that made the difference:-)


It is particularly chilly at the shelter this evening, most likely because it is at 3,122 feet elevation. Lucky for me I have my down vest and for sleeping I have a toasty 20 degree Western Mountaineering sleeping bag. 


BTW - I have decent cell service this evening because from what I have been told there is a Verizon cell tower on Sugarloaf Mountain which I passed earlier today.

Did lots of climbing again today. Collectively around 4,300 feet including Poplar Ridge Mountain, Saddleback Junior, The Horn and Saddleback. My legs weren’t working as well for me today and I’ve come to the conclusion that it is because I did not have any Krispy Kreme pastries or Red Bull for breakfast :-) I did somehow manage to squeeze in an extra 6.2 miles more than originally planned. The benefit of the extra mileage is that I only have 1.8 miles remaining to get to ME Route 4 tomorrow morning rather than 8 miles had I stopped at my original target. 


Having done 104 miles so far I suppose that I have surpassed the halfway point with only 80 miles to go to get to Gorham, NH. It may take me just as long or longer to do those remaining 80 miles because many NoBo’s have told me that the terrain gets even tougher in southern Maine. Oh boy, I can’t wait!


My evening meal was especially tasty this evening. A local family is staying in the lean-to tonight and they invited me to join them for dinner. Spaghetti with homemade spaghetti sauce. Best trail magic I’ve had so far by far. 



The town of Rangeley is 9 miles from the trailhead so once I get to the ME Route 4 tomorrow morning I will have to get a ride into town somehow so that I can find a place to spend the night. I need to resupply and rest my weary body a bit before continuing south on the AT. I’m confident that it will all work out.

The sound of rain on my rainfly woke me up around 3:00 this morning. My first thought was “If it is still raining at 5:00, my usual wake up time, I might just stay in my hammock a while longer. After all, today is going to be a Nero day anyway”.
Turned out that is was still raining at 5:00 AM so I stayed snuggled in my hammock until about 6:15. At that point I was getting antsy and wanted to get on the trail so I packed up, said goodbye to my trail angel friends in the shelter and headed towards ME Route 4, rain still falling at a fairly heavy rate. 


After reaching Route 4 I headed west in the direction of Rangeley with the intention of checking out a place called “Hiker Hut” about 1/4 mile up the road to see if they had any suggestions as to how I could get to Rangeley, about another 8 3/4 miles down the road. They do offer a shuttle service but said that it would be a couple of hours until they could take me to town and suggested that I try hitchhiking. So back out to the road I went, in the rain, to attempt my first in my lifetime shot at hitching a ride. Traffic going in the Rangeley direction was scarce, only 3 vehicles in the first 15 minutes when all of the sudden a car that was going in the opposite direction that I wanted to go pulled across the road and stopped beside me. Two guys were in the car, one of which is well known and legendary, according to the other guy, thru-hiker by the name of Hawk, and they asked me if I needed a ride into town. I immediately thought, OMG if this isn’t trail magic I don’t know what is! So I threw my wetness into their car and off to town we went. They even offered me a good cold coke. A few minutes later we pulled into a place that I had suggested called Fieldstone Cottages to see if they had any vacancies. My luck  continued to flow as they had a perfect little cottage for me to immediately occupy. As it turned out Hawk checked out from wherever he was and got a cottage there too. I will never forget the day those guys went well out of their way to help out a fellow hiker!


I got settled into my new temporary home, hung my hammock in an “under construction” cottage to dry and took a well needed shower. I then walked to a store down the road called Ecopelagicon that had some basic outdoor gear because I needed a new canister of fuel and a Sawyer water filter. A bit later the owner of Fieldstone Cottages was nice enough to drop me off at the local IGA and I resupplied with enough food to get me through to Andover which will be my next town stop about 37 miles down the trail. I also grabbed some goodies to eat this evening rather than taking the time to go out to eat.

Hawk an I got shuttled to the trailhead and continued our southbound hikes at 7:15 AM. The first hour was dry and then some unexpected rain started which lasted a couple of hours. Needless to say I got quite wet. I was smart enough to put my pack cover over my pack but not smart enough to put my rain jacket on. Later in the morning it cleared off and I air dried as I hiked. It wasn’t very cold today so the rain was actually a bit refreshing. I did not keep up with Hawk very long because he has already done a NoBo this year and is now doing a SoBo, this is called a YoYo, so his legs are much stronger and he moves faster. 


I felt a bit energetic today so I extended my day’s mileage by about four miles beyond what I had planned. Four miles may not sound like a lot but it equates into about two hours of hiking in this terrain, sometimes more. Rain is forecast for tomorrow too, oh boy! 


Bemis Mountain Second Peak was the only significant mountain climb today. Unfortunately that was near the end of the day when my legs were already tired. Tomorrow I have several big climbs.

It was tough getting out of my sleeping bag this morning because the weather was really crappy and was forecast to get increasingly worse through the day. I drug myself out anyway and ate some breakfast, packed up and began to slog, I mean hike, my way over 8.7 miles worth of slippery rocks and tree roots, often times on very steep terrain. When I reached a paved road that leads into Andover, South Arm, I had a decision to make. Continue on the additional 4 miles to my destination lean-to or go into town 10 miles earlier than planned to sit out the rain for the night. My decision was made when a pickup truck pulled over at a parking area right at the trailhead. Turns out that the driver was the owner of a place in Andover called “The Cabin” that caters to hikers and she was going to wait there to pick up a hiker that had not reached the road yet. This seemed too good to pass up so I confirmed that she had a vacancy in her hostel and jumped in her truck.


After a brief stop at a general store in Andover to get some supplies she drove us to “The Cabin” just outside of town. The Cabin offers an optional home cooked dinner and breakfast and of course I opted for both. Dinner was at 6:00 so in the meantime I took a nice hot shower, washed all of my clothes and prepped all my gear and supplies for getting back on the trail tomorrow morning. Hopefully the weather will have cleared by then. After a 7:00 breakfast tomorrow morning we will be shuttled back to the trailhead to continue our journeys. 



This may be my last hot shower and home cooked meal before reaching my destination of Gorham, New Hampshire 51.5 miles down the trail.
Just finished an amazingly good homemade meal which included tossed salad, spaghetti with meatballs, garlic bread, corn on the cob and ice cream with a brownie for dessert. It was so good!

After indulging in a delicious hot breakfast at “The Cabin” this morning  I was dropped off at the trailhead and started my hiking day at 8:20 AM. With the late start I was still able to crank out some pretty descent mileage for the day and it helped that the rocks and roots had dried out a bit since yesterday’s rain. There were three major climbs for a total of about 4,800 feet and lots of smaller ones. I have no clue as to how many total feet I ascended today. The trail is never flat and you’re constantly going up or down. My legs still scream at me and continuously remind me that they do not appreciate what I am asking them to do. Toughen up buttercup!


I have been seeing fewer hikers the last couple of days. Especially today. I can only assume that most of the NoBo bubble has already passed this point. Baxter State Park closes on October 15th so any NoBo’s that do not get there by then may not be able to summit Mt. Katahdin to officially finish their hike at the summit. 


I now have only 36.9 miles to go to get to my final destination of Gorham, New Hampshire. Doesn’t seem like much but I have been warned by many NoBo’s that the trail gets much tougher going south from here. Notoriously challenging places like Mahoosuc Notch stand in my way. It is a one mile long boulder field that takes hours to cross. My goal is to try to average 10 miles per day which would get me to Gorham on Monday. We’ll see how it goes.

I got a reasonably early start today because even though my goal for the day was only ten miles I knew that I had a couple of big climbs and the miles are getting tougher.

Tomorrow I will be crossing the infamous “Mahoosuc Notch” which is known as the most difficult mile on the AT. It’s a one mile long boulder field that takes a couple of hours to navigate. 


My stay at Speck Pond Shelter was unique in that I did a “Work for stay” to avoid having to pay the ten dollar fee to camp here. Most shelters do not charge a fee but this one is an exception. It is a really elaborate shelter and even has a caretaker. So I spent an hour helping the caretaker, Tigger, with composting human waste from the privy. It really wasn’t as gross as you might think. Tigger also invited me to join him in eating two freshly caught trout that a fly fisherman had given him earlier in the day. The trout were caught in the lake right in front of the shelter.

Today was the first time on this section hike that I actually got a bit chilly while hiking, particularly my hands. It rained fairly heavily a good portion of the day.

Ultimately the rain did not prevent me from reaching my goal of 10 miles for the day. Actually I was able to surpass that goal by 7 miles for a total of 17. And guess what, that got me to my final destination of Gorham, NH today instead of tomorrow. It helped considerably that the trail got much less technical the last few miles. So my “Section Hike 2” has come to an end. I do not have a clue at this point as to when I might do a “Section Hike 3”.

GaitKeeper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623660,"Section Hike 2 ended on September 9th with a pleasant and non-eventful drive home from the wonderful Rattle River Hostel in Gorham, New Hampshire. Initially I was concerned about securing a one way car rental from the local Enterprise, the only car rental business in town, because my attempts to reserve a car online the night before failed miserably. The website consistently told me that one way rentals were not available to anywhere near my home town. Undeterred, the following morning I got a shuttle from the hostel to Enterprise and fortunately for me the employee there was able to pull some strings and secure me a one way rental. Whew...


So, over the past few weeks my mind has repeatedly wandered to the trail. I have worked pretty hard getting homeowner to-do list things completed since I returned home from Gorham and have decided, with my wonderful wife’s consent of course, that I am going to add a Section Hike 3 to 2019. Autumn is my favorite time of the year and what a better way to enjoy it than to take a nice long walk on the AT. 



The plan - Although I had initially planned to always resume my AT hike from where I had left off the time before I have decided that delving into the White Mountains of New Hampshire at this time of the year presents too much of a risk. Instead, I have decided to jump about 600 trail miles south to Delaware Water Gap (the NJ/PA border) and continue southbound from there with the intention of hiking the Gorham, NH to Delaware Water Gap section at a later time. My wife and I will be driving to and spending the night at Delaware Water Gap on Tuesday, October 1st. The following day my wife will be joining me, weather permitting, for the first mile or two of my SoBo hike, possibly summiting Mt. Minsi with me. At that point she will return to the car and I will continue my trek southward. The initial separation from her never gets easier!As for my goal for this section hike, well, let’s just say that ideally I would like to complete all 230 miles of PA or however many miles I can cover in two weeks or less so we’ll just see how it plays out.

My wife and I made it to Delaware Water Gap safely. We left home around 10:45 AM and stopped in Hamburg for some lunch. While there just for curiosity’s sake we decided to drive East on Route 61 for only 1.2 miles to where the AT crosses Blue Mountain Road. Just so happened that there was a SoBo thru-hiker there that was looking to get a ride to the local Walmart so we offered him a ride. Felt really good to help him out even though it was only a bit over a mile! After arriving in Delaware Water Gap we scoped out the area where the AT skirts the edge of town and made our plans for hitting the trail tomorrow morning. After that we decided to check in to the Clarion Inn which is just up the road from where the AT skirts town. For supper we drove about 10 minutes to nearby Stroudsburg and ended up eating at Friendly’s. We are now back at the Clarion and plan to relax the rest of the evening and preserve our energy for climbing Mt. Minsi tomorrow morning.

6:00 AM to 1:30 PM


Bake Oven Knob Shelter 940.2 to Eckville Shelter 957.6


I made some pretty decent mileage today considering that I cut the day considerably short. The trail was a good mix of fast pace service trail and  quite a few rock scrambles thrown in to make certain that you don’t forget that you’re in Pennsylvania. The weather was much cooler, quite breezy and more importantly dry. 


So why did I stop at 1:30 you might ask! Two reasons really. One - Stopping where I did leaves a good 14.5 mile hike to get to Hamburg tomorrow where I plan to spend the night and resupply. I already have my reservation at the Microtel Inn. Two - The last few days have left me a bit tired so I could use a little extra downtime and I had a few blisters on my feet to tend to. I am content with 17.4 miles for the day!


I did not see any other hikers at all today. I’m thinking that may not be the case tomorrow and Sunday as folks get out in the mountain to enjoy the cool autumn weather and foliage. 


I did see a few more whitetail today. That’s always a welcome bonus. No big rack bucks like the one I saw yesterday though. 


My wife informed me earlier today that she is going to Alexandria, VA tomorrow to visit our daughter and son-in-law. Oh the things I miss when I’m out walking in the woods. Kelsey/Taylor, if you read this I want to say that I love and miss you guys and hopefully I will get to see you soon!

5:30 AM to 11:30 AM


Eckville Shelter 957.6 to PA 61 - Hamburg, PA 972.1


Good news first- Although relatively short, for me anyway, today was a picture perfect day for hiking in PA. I got a really early start and was gazing out over The Pinnacle just as the sun rose, 5.4 miles from where I started the day. Shortly after that was Pulpit Rock. What a beautiful, cool, breezy day it was and unlike yesterday I was not feeling alone out there. Lots of day hikers and I took the time to chat with many of them. 



The not so good news - I must get a set of earplugs! Either that or avoid shelters if anyone else is spending the night there. Why am I carrying that darn hammock anyway! I can laugh about it now but last night had me reeling in frustration. Four other hikers shared the Eckville Shelter with me last night and wouldn’t you know it one of them was a world class snorer. I am a light sleeper and simply cannot go to sleep under those conditions. For two hours I tried to ignore it and even stuffed TP in my ears but that offered little to no help. So, what does a desperate person do - Well I grabbed my sleeping pad and bag and figured I’d go outside and sleep on the porch of the caretakers house which is right near the shelter. Well that did not work out so well either because the caretaker was watching TV with the volume at full blast. I could hear the TV like I was sitting right beside it. Again, I tried to ignore it but just couldn’t. So what does a super desperate person do - Well I grabbed my sleeping pad and bag and figured I’d try my luck across the street at the tenting area of course. By this time it is around 1:00 AM. I’m happy to say that I did manage to get a few hours of sleep under the stars. I’m thankful for that but now I have to dry out my sleeping bag because of all of the dew that touched down on it during those few hours. Enough about that.
I’m staying at the Microtel Inn tonight in Hamburg and have made arrangements for a retired gentleman to pick me up and shuttle me to the trailhead at 6:00 AM. The weather man is predicting possible rain over the next couple of days so we’ll see how that pans out. 


Oh, I did have another fairly close encounter with a spike whitetail today. 


Clothes are washed, body is washed, resupply at Walmart is done and I am ready for a GOOD nights sleep and then a few more days on the trail.

PA 61 - Hamburg, PA 972.1 to 501 Shelter 996.5


Good news - Steve, my early morning shuttle driver, was prompt at picking me up at the Microtel and I was on the trail by 6:10. He was a very nice gentleman and even led me through the town of Port Clinton in his vehicle until the point where the trail goes into the woods. It seemed really unusual. It’s as though he thought I might not find my way without his help. I gave him a nice tip for getting up so early on a Sunday morning so maybe he thought that he owed me special treatment. 


Not so good news - It rained pretty much all day and not only did it spoil any views that were out there but my feet were pretty trashed by the time I made it to the shelter. Blistered feet take some of the fun out of the process. It’s supposed to rain again tomorrow so I’m not sure what I’m going to do. I suppose I will just wrap my feet up as best as I can and get back out there. Maybe I will just back off on the mileage tomorrow. It’s supposed to clear up for a few days beginning Tuesday. 


I saw another whitetail today. Just a large doe.

501 Shelter 996.5 to Rausch Gap Shelter 1,014.0


Aside from hostels and hotels I got the best rest last night at the 501 Shelter that I’ve gotten any other time while on the trail. A guy, whose name I won’t mention here, and I were the only ones that spent the night there and aside from him having to use the ‘F’ word at least once in every sentence he was a really nice/interesting guy. He claims to have been a Navy Seal and had a lot of stories to share. I’m not sure whether I believe his story about fighting off a black bear by punching it in the nose though. I suppose it’s possible. 


I would have liked to have gotten higher mileage in today but I’ll be happy with what I got considering the circumstances. My feet have not improved and although I made it to the shelter before the worst of the rain it drizzled and rained lightly all day. Needless to say my feet were soaked all day again. 


A couple of miles before reaching the shelter today I came across a sign that said “Water Crossing, Beaver Dam Ahead”. There was an alternate dry route available but I wanted to see the beaver dam and my feet were already soaked anyway so I pressed on following the white AT blazes. When I arrived at the dam I was amazed. Although I did not see any beavers the dam itself was incredibly long and had flooded a really large area. The trail paralleled the bottom of the dam on the left side but there must have been a second dam farther down to the left of the trail because I had to wade through water that was nearly knee deep in places. I hope that I did not interrupt the beaver family. I get the impression that most folks take the detour. 


Hopefully we have some dry weather coming our way. I’m ready for a break from the rain!


Sorry this journey entry is late. I had zero cell service at the Rausch Gap Shelter.

Rausch Gap Shelter 1,014.0 to Peter’s Mountain Shelter 1,032.0


Today was a picture perfect day for a walk in the mountains. The leaves are turning a bit and it is nice and cool. Unfortunately for me I am still dealing with blistered feet which takes a bit of enjoyment out of the experience. Hopefully with some dryer weather upon us now things will improve. 


I only have about 10 miles to go tomorrow to get to Duncannon, PA but if my feet allow I might just pass on through with my target being Cove Mountain Shelter.


Getting to Duncannon is a pretty neat milestone for me because I am already very familiar with the AT from Duncannon south to PenMar at the PA-MD border. I live in the area and have spent quite a bit of time hiking and running the trail on that section.




The shelter that I am staying in tonight is really neat and has a loft for sleeping upstairs. I have chosen the loft and a couple of lady section hikers took up residence on the lower level.
That’s about it for today.

Another picture perfect day for a walk in the mountains and by some miracle my feet felt much better so I was much more comfortable. My feet actually felt the worst during the 2.2 mile walk on the bridge over the Susquehanna and the sidewalks through Duncannon. 


I was originally going to stay in Duncannon tonight but decided to push on because my wife is going to meet me in Boiling Springs, PA tomorrow and we will be getting a hotel room somewhere in that area. Oh yeah! I did indulge in a delicious meat packed Western Cheese Steak sub at Zeiderelli’s Pizza while in town though.



The photo above is the highlight of my trip so far. I just could not believe how close that buck left me get to him. He couldn’t have been any more than 30 feet away from me.

A very special day! My wife met me in Boiling Springs today as planned and it was so good to see her. We drove to Carlisle and had lunch at Arby’s, resupplied with trail food at the local Walmart, checked in at the Sleep Inn (washed my stinky clothing in the guest laundry room) and had a wonderful dinner at the Cracker Barrel. My wife and I both love Cracker Barrel’s home style food.


My wife does not have to work tomorrow either so rather than hitting the trail at the crack of dawn we’re planning to sleep in a bit and indulge in the hotel supplied breakfast. At some point later in the morning she’ll drop me off at the ATC Office in Boiling Springs and I will resume by southbound hike. With the late start I will most likely do another relatively short mileage day of 12 miles, stopping at the James Fry Shelter for the night. That suits me well because my feet are still trying to heal. 


Time to relax and enjoy my comfy king size bed.

After sleeping in a bit and indulging in the hotels hot breakfast my wife took me back to the ATC in Boiling Springs and I resumed my trek south. Considering the relatively late start I was happy to get 19 miles in today. I did not have a specific destination in mind when I started the day but ultimately decided to stay at the Ironmasters Mansion Hostel in Pine Grove Furnace State Park. I had been to the park many times before and had been inside the Mansion but had never stayed overnight there. Really nice. 



The weather was picture perfect again today and hopefully it stays that way through Sunday when my Section Hike 3 will come to an end. The PA-MD border is 38 miles away and I should be able to cover that in two days.
I would like to thank my wife for sacrificing her time to meet me at Boiling Springs. She’s the best!

I slept in a bit again this morning and indulged in a good hot breakfast provided by the IronMaster’s Mansion before hitting the trail. Hot breakfast two days in a row, wow. 


I had plenty of company in the mountain today as there were lots of weekend day hikers on the trail. Nice to see all those folks enjoying our great outdoors. The Quarry Gap Shelter is no exception. There are quite a few folks here including a group of about twenty scouts and their leaders. Fortunately the scouts utilize the tenting areas and not the shelter.


Only 20.5 miles left to reach the PA-MD border (Mason Dixon Line) and at that point my Section Hike 3 will come to an end. I should be able to knock that out tomorrow so I expect to be sleeping in my own bed tomorrow night! My feet will certainly be happy for the break although they have not been given me as much grief lately.

Quarry Gap Shelters 1,105.1 to PA-MD Border 1,125.6


It was a beautiful day in the woods again today but to be quite honest I was primarily focused on getting to the MD border, going home and giving my feet a break for a while. 


Pennsylvania is notorious for its rocky trail and as a result it is frequently referred to as one of the most challenging states that the AT runs through (there are 14 of them). Definitely not as challenging as Maine and New Hampshire though with their much larger mountains and yes, lots of rock scrambling. 


So I have now completed two of the tougher states, Maine and Pennsylvania, and almost 1/4 of the total length of the AT (2,192 miles). It is unlikely that I will be doing any more section hikes this year considering that it is getting pretty late in the year and getting quite cold at night. I hope to do one or more section hikes next year as well but it’s too soon to say with any certainty as to the when’s and where’s. 


I would like to say thank you to everyone who has been following along on my adventures and a very special thank you to my wonderful, understanding wife who not only puts up with my occasional absences but does everything she can to help make it a better experience for me. Also a special thank you to my mother for picking me up at the PA-MD border and getting me home.
