She’s been on 5 day trips so I hope she still likes it after the second 5 days and so on.",,View Entry,"Mar 22, Fri",0
LitelyTread,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608976,"I’ve read many times that you should ‘hike your own hike’ especially when it comes to long thru-hikes.  Well, we are good at doing our own thing and this hike will be no different.  Our plan involves a ‘soft start’ in which we will do 4 section hikes within driving distance of our house in the mid-atlantic, thus unassisted and with 3-4 day breaks in the middle.  Then, on or around May 1st we will hit it full time!

The Plan:

Week of March 24th – Pine Grove Furnace State Park, PA to Pen Mar, PA – 3 days, two nights

Week of March 31st – Pen Mar, PA to Harpers Ferry, WV – All of MD basically, 3 days, two nights

Week of April 14th – Harpers Ferry, WV to Front Royal, VA

Week of April 24th – Front Royal, VA to Waynesboro, VA – All of Shenandoah, 6 days, 5 nights

We start tomorrow!!",,View Entry,"Mar 27, Wed",0

This time of year and this section of the trail there is not a lot to see.  The rhododendron tunnel was the prettiest part.  There was plenty of flowing water so Mocha had plenty of water.","Pine Grove Furnace Center
