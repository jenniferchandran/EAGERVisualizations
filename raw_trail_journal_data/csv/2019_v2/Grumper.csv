Tonight I am staying in my tent near Maupin Field Shelter.  It wasn't an easy day of walking but I got 19.3 miles in.  I made a big mistake yesterday, I listened to a 23 year old kid.  He told me the rain was ending and there would not be anymore through the night.  I strung a line and hung up all of my wet clothes to dry and laid down to take a nap.  I woke up to the pitter patter of rain on my tent.  Too late everything was wet and if I went outside in my dry clothes would get wet also.  So in the morning I had 1 inch of water in my shoes and all of my clothes were wet.  it rained all of today's morning as well.  Well that is how it goes.  Today was the first I had some misgivings about what I am doing.  I don't know if its because of the miles I have been doing recently or the rain but I just sort of felt like giving up.  My legs were sore and everything I had or was wet and then I ran into Trail magic.  I sat there maybe 20 minutes eating ad drinking soda and eating fruit, candy and brownies.  the hills I had to climb were easy after that rest and all of the sugar I consumed.  I feel much better about the hike now and really looking forward to tomorrow.  i should be in Waynesboro and you know what that means--shower, food, and a bed.  Well that will be all for today.
(The photo I used for today is one of the ways hikers secure their food from bears.  Some locations have these poles where a hooked pole is left for hikers to put their food out of the reach of bears.  If bear poles are not available, sometimes there are bear lockers, or hikers need to hang their bag in a tree at least 12 feet off the ground and 6 foot from the trunk.)","Seeley-Woodworth Shelter +

The second reason I did not go to Fingerboard Shelter is that there has been a bear terrorizing that shelter.  It has stolen food hung in trees and broken into tents in that area.  I am happy where I am.  Well something to look forward to tomorrow.  Jinny is coming up and we are going to stay at the Bear Mountain Lodge.  I will be in a real bed, get a real shower, do laundry, and some real food.  Can not wait.  The rain today was steady rain that lasted all morning.  I had my phone turned off most of the day because of the rain, so not many pictures.

Greylock.  Not sure where he was planning on stopping tonight-Vermont AKA Vermud was just shy of 14 miles from where he stayed last night.  So did he do those miles or not???)Today was a nice day of walking.  I finished climbing Mount Greylock then it was mostly all down hill.  Two big milestones today.  I passed the 1,600 mile mark and I completed Massachusetts.  I am now in Vermont.  I am not really impressed with this state so far.  Lots of mud and mosquitoes.  There are a lot of large boulders that are balanced and just sitting there.  I am talking large boulders here like 20-25 feet in diameter.  I don't know why they are here but I passed 4-5 of them in the 1.3 miles I have been in Vermont.  The walking tomorrow does not look too bad.  I start with a nice climb, but then its mostly down hill until the end which is a big up hill over a 2,000 foot climb.  I am really getting excited now only two more states to go.  I really think I am going to make this.  Of course the last two states are the toughest.  Well that is all for today.  Shelter is starting to fill up and rain is in the forecast for tonight and tomorrow AM,","Muskrat Creek SHelter

Today was a short day of walking into Manchester.  I got lucky and got picked up fairly soon while hitch hiking from the trail to the hotel.  It is about a 5 mile walk.  Once I got here, I took a shower and it was off to town, which is is another 2 miles.  I did not get picked up for this part of the trip.  While I was in town I went to Price Chopper, a grocery store, McDonald's, back to Price Chopper, and then Ben & Jerry's.  While at McDonald's, I had a Big Mac, Quarter Pounder, with 3 large sodas and no ice, my usual when I go to McDonald's.  Today was mostly all down hill day with a few small up hills thrown in just to  keep you awake.  The mud is trying to dry up a little but its still quite messy.  maybe if we don't get any more rain in the next 5 months it will dry up HAHAHAHAH!  Tomorrows walk looks a little tougher with several large uphills but that is all part of the walk.  It really does seem strange laying around in a bed at 3 o'clock watching TV.  That is all for today.  There is one other thing I wanted to mention, which I forgot about.  It is now 11 at m=night and it just came to mind.  While walking today I saw moose tracks in the mud. Very fresh tracks too.  The hoof of a moose is quite large about the size of my hand with two prominent hooves.  Just the size of them meant they were moose.  It walked down the trail maybe 200 yards then went off to ado whatever moose do.  i was really excited to see them.  Now I just have to see the moose that made them.","Campsite at 1644.3

Well we stayed at Mizpah and it was one of the worst nights I have spent in a lg time.  it was like a bunch of unsupervised adults with a lot of liquor and no brains talking through most of the night. The staff told them several times to be quiet but it didn't matter.  The food was very good and there was plenty of it.  I guess that is what most weekends are like tough at these places.  We climbed Mt Washington in some pretty brutal conditions.  When we got to the top they have a weather station there.  There was a steady wind with 70 mph gusts to 75 and rain.  Not a fun combination.  The walk up there was quite rocky and all above the tree line so no protection from the wind.  We all made it and no one got hurt. It taught us a little respect for the old mountain though.  We did have hot dogs and pizza on top which was nice.  We have been stopping at all the huts we pass.  We have been getting free food-left overs from breakfast that they have been giving out to hikers-which is very nice.  We spent the night at the Perch shelter.  It was a long walk off the trail and all down hill, but it was the closest thing.  It was a small shelter, the 4 of us filled it up but I did set up my tent inside the shelter=no bugs.  The grandsons did quite well walking.  it wasn't easy walking either.  I was struggling to keep up especially with my leg.  Well I have to get to sleep.  That is all for today.","Mizpah Hut

Adams it was mostly all down hill walking.  With about 5 miles to go and starting to get late, dinner at 5, the kids took off to get there on time.  They were waiting for us when we got there.  The last several miles was on an old road and easy to walk on except for my leg.  That type of walking really hurts it because you have to stretch it out and I can not.  When I got to the lodge and took a shower, I noticed that my entire left left was swollen from my upper thigh down to my ankle.  It is still swollen the next day.  Fortunately I did not re-injure that leg two days in a row now.  I will be able to walk a little slower now that I am all m=by myself again with no time frame to meet anyone.  Well tomorrow they all go home and leave me alone.  I will miss them but I am down to about 300 to go so a few more weeks.  That is all for today.","The Perch

I have eaten very little of my own food this past week, but there is only one more hut.  I still have not seen a moose.  There was one in the Ethan Pond for about 45 minutes bit I didn't see it.  I have seen moose tracks and droppings but that is all.  Tomorrow I start the Wildcat Mtns.

Today was a zero day.  We stayed in the hotel in Gorham.  I did go to the hospital today to have them look at my swollen feet.  it seems like my left foot was swollen first and then slowly it spread to my right foot.  My left foot is affected from mid thigh down to the foot and the right foot seems to be just the foot and calf area.  They think it was from the pulled groin muscle I had in  my left leg and from the over use of my right leg, compensating for my left leg.  If it doesn't show any improvement by tomorrow, they want me back for some additional testing.  They did do some blood work, which came back as normal or very close to normal.  They told me to get a cream to apply to my pulled muscle which is supposed to make it feel better.  So I have been applying that, elevating my legs and trying not to walk very much.  It does get quite boring just laying around the hotel room all the time, but what else can I do?  Drink wine.Temps going into the 90's tomorrow.  Glad I am not walking.  It seems like all I did today was eat.  I guess you may as well eat while you can.  New update tomorrow.","Top Notch Inn

Grumper had some reception as he was sitting on a tree at the top of a mountain this morning, so he called.   Told me a few things he left out of his journal entries.   While climbing through Mahoosuc Notch his backpack slipped and hit his head causing his head to get stuck between the rocks!  He told me, a's he was chuckling,  that it took him quite awhile to get his head unstuck!  He also shared that when he stayed at the Little Red Hen, their property buts up against the firehouse,  the town had a battle of the band's.  The battle ended sometime around 11, which is WAY past hiker midnight.   The guy he hitched with from the trail to the Red Hen was a hunter and was talking of going to bait his hunting spot for the bear hunt.  He uses dunkin donuts that are 1 year old. Says they never get moldy!  His goal for today is to hike up Saddleback Mountain ski resort. He took the final antibiotics today and said he falls great,  hasn't felt this good in a real long time.  His arms,  legs,  feet,  everything is wonderful.   He is happy he went to the hospital.  Hoping I get his complete entries in the next day or so.
Tonight I stayed in Rangeley at the Hiker Hut which is 0.2 miles from the trail.  It is really quite a primitive place with no electric, running water, WiFi, or any other modern convenience.  They do have cold beer and Gator-aid if you want.  The shower I took was with stream water that he heats some how and brown soap like my grandmother always used.  But I am clean and getting a little buzz on.  So some more about yesterday.  The lake was great with a nice sand beach and clean clear water.  Last night was the first time I head Loons calling.  It was really quite beautiful.  The hut and camp site were quite a mess.  There were two large groups there. One was about 15 boys, teens, and a group of 20 girls maybe a little older.  But there was not a camp site to be found.  There was constant walking from campsites to the privy which goes right in front of the shelter.  So at night all these kids with head lamps came walking past and they had to look into the shelter.  Today's walk wasn't too bad.  I did the 9.4 miles before 11 and was in town, 9 miles away by 11:30.  I had a large pizza and two 16 ounce bottles of soda.  Tomorrow I start the Saddleback Mountain.  Which will be all up hill all morning.  There are calling for rain which will make it a little more interesting.  If I can get up and over Saddleback and the Horn tomorrow I will be very happy.    My next resupply is 30 miles away in Stratton.  I have enough supplies for that but it is nice getting into town.  I am going to take a quick nap and maybe go into town again.  I am not sure yet.  That is all for today.  (When I spoke to Grumper he told me that tale of his hitch back to the Hostel.  He was picked up by a man who was driving and his wife as a passenger-he was 87 and the wife was 93ish.  He told me that they stopped, he couldn't not take the ride they offered.  So off he went.  My dad told them the place was coming up, the guy said ok.  My dad then said take the next right-guy said ok.  Dad yelled stop there is it!  guy kept going and slammed on the brakes! it was quite comical the way he told me today)","Sabbath Day Pond Lean-To

He told me he had to talk himself into going in and that he was praying for his life to continue.  He has to cross this river on a narrow plank that was under water.  The water he was walking in was white water, because of the rocks and logs it was going over, and it was almost to his knees, rushing and pushing on him.  I asked him if there was a rope that was strung across the river for him to hold onto, but there was not, it was jut him and his balance.  He made it across and is hoping there are no more like that.  Now I wonder if he will do a little Wiggelo on top of Bigelow Mountain???","Crocker Cirque Campsite

Grumper,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621077,"Day 148Tonight I stayed at a stealth campsite at mile 2050.5.  It was really a very nice site in front of a huge rock, see pictures.  Today was a fun day of walking.  Last night I stayed at Pierce Pond Shelter.  Three tenths of a mile from there is a beautiful place.  Since the first river ferry starts at 9, I got to the breakfast place at 6:30.  It starts serving at 7, but there was coffee at 6:30.  I had 12 pancakes stuffed with apples, blueberries, raspberries, two eggs, and three sausage pieces=$9!  you can not beat that!  I left there at 7:30 and had three miles to the Kennebec river ferry.  Which is a canoe.  I made it to the river at 8:45 in time for the first crossing.  Timing is everything and today it all worked out great.  I got some nice mountain views from the top of Pleasant Pond Mountain, see pictures. The rest of the day was all in the green tunnel.  Tomorrow there is one bit mountain, 1,500 feet up then all down hill from there.  It is 20 miles to Monson, my next town visit and resupply.  Looking forward to it.  That is all for today.  it is 5 and time for bed.  (the Kennebec River is a river that is not able to be forded and has no bridges, it is 400 feet across and the current runs swiftly; there is a dam up stream that gets released regularly and the canoe crossing is difficult when that occurs.  Because of this the Maine Appalachian Trail Organization hires a canoe operator to cross the hikers from the end of May till mid Oct only during certain hours-if hikers wish to cross at other times previous arrangements need to be made and there is a $50 fee. My dad spoke to my mom the evening after his canoe ride and told her this story.  The canoe holds 3 people at a time-2 hikers and the captain.  One of the hikers gets to sit in the middle and enjoys the ride, while the other hiker must sit at the back of the canoe and help steer it.  So, Grumper signs his paperwork, dons his life vest, and they get the packs in the canoe-he then informs the captain that the last time he was in a canoe he and his wife tipped over within 5 minutes-very true the entire canoe trip was a series of them in and out of the canoe. SO, the captain decides well then you will sit in the middle and the other hiker will be in the back.  So Grumper got to enjoy his river crossing!  I am told he has pictures of this crossing, but they have not been sent to me yet)","Pierce Pond Shelter

Tonight I am staying at the Lakeshore Lodging and Pub in Monson, Maine.  I got a nice private room, see pictures and everything is very close.  I had a sandwich at a local deli and it was great along with a whole pie.  I am just waiting for the UPS truck to see if they brought my resupply box.  Walking today way fairly easy.  I got an early start and covered the 9.4 miles and was checked into the lodge by 9:30!  I only had one river to ford and the water came up to my mid calf which was not too bad.  That was the second river I had to ford, there will be a few tomorrow though.  Last evening I picked a baggie of blueberries and out them in my oatmeal this morning.  It was really pretty good.  I would do it again if I have the time to  pick that many berries. They are really small.  The wilderness is not too bad at the start.  There are a lot of small hills and one big mountain that I have to climb, but it doesn't look to serious until the end.  I still can not believe I am talking about the end.  It has been a fun and exciting trip that is almost over.  There is no cell service through the wilderness, so you will have to wait.  All for now.  (So when I was looking for an alternative place for Grumper to stay-he is not crazy about staying in hostels-I found out that there is only one other place in Monson that has lodging.  It just so happens to be on top of a pub.  Because i had not read anything about this place on my Facebook groups, I put out a post looking for information.  One responder told me that he could only tell me that when checking in, they give complimentary weed!  I was also told that their fried fiddleheads are really wonderful-turns out a fiddlehead is a fern. Aside from the very limited service in the 100 mile wilderness, Grumper's phone can text and call-however we can hear him, but he can not hear us.  Grumper is not a huge text person, so information regarding his final summit is tough going.  He also shared with me that he stepped onto a scale he said he was almost down to Roger's wrestling weight and he is currently 148 down from 175-180!)","Horeshoe Canyon Shelter

Tonight I am staying in the Chairback Gap Shelter.  I wanted to walk further today, but the rain made walking slow.  It makes everything slippery and swells the streams so crossing them is much harder.  I got a nice early start this morning, 5:45, but the rain started around 7 and lasted all morning and early afternoon.  I was able to get a few pictures but the phone was put away most of the day.  I was glad to see the 2100 mile marker.  I am really getting close now.  Today seemed like I was walking up all day.  I know that is not true but the ups seemed to hurt a lot more and last so  much longer.  There should be only one more day of mountains in the wilderness then it will be all flat.  I did see a beaver today, see pictures.  It hung around a while then I left.  I still have not seen Mount Katahdin yet.  I probably could have seen it today, but I couldn't see more than 50 feet with the rain and fog.  I have been walking north and the nights are getting much colder.  Glad for the 10 degree sleeping bag.  I really think I need to pick up the pace here and get there as soon as I can.  All for today.","Long Pond Stream Lean To

I woke up this morning to the sound of cracking lightning and booming thunder with the pitter patter of rain drops on the shelter roof.  Actually it was a lot more than pitter patter, it was a torrential downpour!  I was going to get an early start but just rolled over and stayed in my sleeping bag.  It finally let up a little at 6, so I ate breakfast and packed.  Started walking at 6:30 in on and off hard rain.  It rained pretty much the whole day either hard rain or the drizzle kind but still wet.  You know how much I like rain.  Wet rocks, roots, leaves and now really swollen rivers.  What use to be a dry crossing was mid calf, what was mid calf wads knee deep over very slippery rocks.  I am staying tonight at the Sidney Tappan Campsite in my tent.  I have not been making very good distances with the rain.  I hope that ends soon.  Tomorrow I will be over all of the big mountains then it will be flat walking right to Katahdin.  I could really use some easy walking.  No pictures today.  It was really  mostly wet all day.  That will be all for today.  Hope for better weather tomorrow.","Chairback Gap Shelter

Today I walked from Abol Bridge Campground to the Birches Campground and was here by 12.  I had a nice breakfast at Abol and started walking at 7:45.  When I got to the Birches, I had to check in with the Ranger who was not here yet and we had to wait about one hour for him.  The campground is about one half mile away from the ranger station so after checkin with the ranger I started walking tot he campground, and yes it started raining (we were driving during this rain storm and let me tell you it was hard, driving rain that I could barely see out of my windshield with the wipers on full blast!)  By the time it took me to get here it was really raining hard, so I just went to a shelter and I am calling it home for the night.  The forecast for tomorrow is really good.  I just have to make it through the night.  I still can not believe that it will all be over tomorrow.  i will be an official thru hiker of the Appaliachian Trail!  I just hope that the family knows where I am and how to get here.  The Ranger said they should be here by 6 am before the park closes unless they have a day use pass .  I am going to trust Lisa and assume that she got one and everything will be ok then.  Mount Katahdin tomorrow, just 5.3 miles away.  I really am looking forward to it.  I can not believe it the last day and my pen runs out of ink!  I do have a replacement cartridge though.  I am sort of sad it will be over, but I will be home with running water, showers, a bed, and food plus all the people.  Well I want to get to the ranger station early so that will be all for tonight. 
  (so now the rest of the story!  We (my mom, sister, and my 2 boys left home at 5:30 and drove for 11 hours to get to Millinocket.  We checked into the Cabin at Big Moose Inn got settled and the boys stayed behind with their 2 dogs while the girls went in search of our start point in the morning.  Well, 8 miles to the park ranger station, pay $15 to enter, then another 8 miles to the Katahdin Stream Campground on a dirt road with speed limit of 10-one hour later we arrived.  We drive up to field and see some people sitting on the lawn.  Trish gets out and asks the people ""Are you thru hikers?""  of course they respond ""Yes"".  She then explains that we are looking for our father, she doesn't get to finish and they say ""OH Grumper!  He is in the shelter sleeping""  The guy goes by the name of ""Maine"" started telling us a story of Grumper in the Mahoosuc Notch.  At this point my mom and I are parking the truck and walking over to them.  ""Maine"" tells us that Grumper is in the shelter sleeping and walks us over to the ranger station to help get us in in the morning (all the day passes were sold out ahead of time).  We are told that if we get here by 6:30 we can wait and at 7 they release the unclaimed parking spots.  So, we leave to find Grumper.  As we turn around, ""Maine's"" son ""Destroyer"" is there and we get introduced to him.  He is a very excited 8 year old who walked the entire trail.  We head for the the truck and ""Destroyer"" runs off.  We end up giving ""Maine"" a ride in the bed of the truck-yes this is an acceptable way to travel here in Maine-to the Birches.  as we are driving, who do we see walking, but Grumper!  ""Destroyer"" ran to wake him up for us!  So we give Grumper the option of staying in the shelter or staying in the cabin with us on a real bed, with real food, flushing toilets, etc.  He jumps at the offer and starts to pack up.  Off we go on the 1 hour 16 mile ride back to the cabin.  We get there and proceed to go to dinner.  While at dinner, Grumper explains that this is his 3rd dinner of the night!!!  He made his first, then about 4 pm ""Maine's"" father brought in hamburgers from McDonalds for the thru hikers at camp-Grumper was sleeping and was going to miss it, but ""Destroyer"" felt bad, grabbed a burger and ran it all the way to Grumper so he could have one.  Grumper got out of bed, to eat it and to thank the people for sharing, who also brought blueberry cobbler--yummy it was I am told.  After Grumper's 3rd dinner with us at the Cabin, we all went to bed anther early physically demanding day was ahead of all of us.
The story that ""Maine"" told us was while his family -wife, 2 daughters, and son-were climbing through the Mahoosuc Notch they came upon this hiker who was going pretty slow, all bloody, and old.  He was torn between slowing down to help him and moving on with his family.  ""Maine"" ended up moving on, but before he did he was able to help Grumper.  While they were finding their way, he heard something fall and Grumper mumble something, ""Maine"" turns to see what happened.  Turns out that Grumper's water bottle fell down a crack and he couldn't get it.  ""Maine"" came over with one of his kids, held them upside down so they could reach the bottle.  While they were celebrating the completion of the hardest mile on the AT, they see Grumper exit all bloody and smiles exclaiming ""That was the BEST PART!!"")","Abol Bridge Campground

I summited Mount Katahdin and I am staying in a cabin with my wife, Jinny, two daughters, Lisa and Tricia, and two of my grandsons, Jake and Roger.  What a relief it is knowing that I don;t have to sleep on the ground and get up and walk tomorrow.  As challenging and beautiful the trail was five months is along time to be away from everyone sleeping on the ground.  Ok lets start at the beginning of August 23.  FIrst off my two daughters and two grandsons were going to summit withme.  The Baxter State Park doesn't open its gates till 6am so we had to get up at 4:30 have a quick breakfast pack and started the 30  minute drive to Baxter.  Now you need an entrance permit to drive in and we did not have one, but at 7am you can purchase one if there is any room left.  So we waited till 7 and when we were applying for the pass they found out that we had the 2 dogs in the truck. You are not allowed to take dogs into the park so the five of us got out and started walking the eight miles to Katahdin Streams and start the climb.  Fortunately, a truck came by and picked us up (it was the first experience they boys had at hitch hiking ever!), but he was only going to Abol Campground, which is 3.2 miles from where we needed to start. (We climbed into the bed of the truck, which is another first for the boys riding in the bed of a pickup truck for miles).Once we arrived at Abol we climbed out said our thank you for the ride and began our walk again.  We did have to walk the entire 3.2 miles to Katahdin Stream.  One we got there we rested up a little while then started the climb.  The Ranger told us that the bridge over the stream had washed out and there was a reroute around the stream.  We took the real route and rock hoped over the stream, not too bad but then the real climbing began.  The two boys and me did OK the 2 daughters were struggling a little bit and it took us 2 hours to cover 1.5 miles.  At that pace it would be too long to summit so the boys and me started going on.  Mount Katahdin was by tar the most difficult climb of the entire trip, but also one of the most beautiful climbs (I wonder if it had to do with the the fact that you could not have asked for a better weather day.  Clear skies as far as you could see, a nice breeze and cool temps)I have done r=during the entire trip.  Climbing up house sized boulders, using re-bar rungs they drilled into the rock, and squeezing between two rocks one foot apart were just some of the more difficult parts of the accent.  We were a little time restricted because of the late start we got but I needed to summit today.  Well the three of us continued on and finally reached the top by 12:45.  My what a feeling that was seeing the sign get closer and closer, then there it was.  I just can not put into words how I felt just all of the different feelings all at the same time.  The views from the top were really stunning.  It was an absolutely beautiful day, a little windy, but the visibility was unlimited.  We stayed at the top for maybe 20 minutes just looking around then started down.  We went up and down the Hunt trail.  Coming down was much easier and only 3.5 hours.  When we got back to Katahdin Stream there was my wife and 2 daughters waiting for us.  Everyone did make it down safely (well almost, my children tell the story of how Grumper did summer saults after taking the picture at the sign down the mountain)  During the 2,189.2 mile trip, I had a lot of time to think and reflect on life.  The 5 months and 5 days it took for the walk I saw many beautiful sights but I am glad it is over.  I am glad I did it and there is no place like home.","The Birches/Big Moose Inn Cabin
