Joe Mehan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617111,I am busy making preparations for the adventure. Putting together supply boxes and meals is taking up most of my time now. I will do more gear shakeouts this week.I'm not sure how often I will post entries from the trail. I haven't tried it from my cell phone yet.(trail name to come),,View Entry,"Jun 23, Sun",0
Joe Mehan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617751,it's 4AM and we're on our way to the airport. Should get to the lodge around 8 tonight. We climb Mountain Katahdin in the morning. ,,View Entry,"Jul 01, Mon",0
Joe Mehan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617792,we had a close call. We walked from the  airport to pick up the bus. About 150 feet from the station which we couldn't see Parker looked it up on a map and it showed it back a mile + the other way. In spite of the directions I had gotten from different people I googled it and sure enough the maps agreed.  So we walked it only to find an empty office. Now we have 15 minutes no where near enough time. We start hitching hiking. No luck and we're down to 5 minutes and flag down a city bus. Fortunately it was empty and after explaining the situation the lady took us there. It was a little past her normal stop. We made the bus with no time to spare. This bus only runs once a day and other options to get to northern Maine at 6:30 at night are to say the least limited and I'm sure expensive. Hopefully no excitement tomorrow on the climb. I don't expect any cell service for a while. ,,View Entry,"Jul 01, Mon",0
Joe Mehan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618205,"It was a very eventful week. I summited Katahdin experiencing thunderstorms with heavy rain, hail, thunder and lightning. The second day was uneventful but the 3rd was different. There was record heat and in the woods 100% humidity. We met rangers in a float plane looking for a heat stroke person but didn't know the location we continued hiking and a couple miles on found the man. I stayed with him and the others with him and Parker ran back to get the rangers they took off before he got there but we were able to flag them down and the guy was evacuated. We hiked on. Parker had been drinking well but at some point fell behind or started behind. He was tired and wanted to rest and told me he would catch up. I reached camp ground and he hadn't caught up so I filled a water bottle as I had just run out and I ran back to find him. It was about a half mile and to my horror he was too weak to walk and was dry heaving. I put up his tent and got him in. I knew one of the guys at the camp site had an emergency beacon so I ran back there and got the message out. I dumped much of my gear and hustled back. It was too close to dark and they couldn't send out a plane. It was a miserable night with him dry heaving and generally feeling terrible. A rescue team reached us around 3 or 4. The EMT had fluid but misplaced the IV start kits. We got Parker down to the lake and a boat from a lodge a couple of miles away picked us up and brought us back there where the plane picked him up and transported him to a hospital. I caught another trip(it was only a 3 seater). We spent a few hours in the ER. Thankfully all his labs were okay but he needed 6 or 7 liters before he was able to urinate. We stayed in that town yesterday and got a shuttle to  Monson where we will spend tonight. Parker's throat is so sore he still can't eat much. After a lot of consideration he doesn't feel up to continuing and wants to go and visit our family in NY. I  made arrangements to get him there. I will continue with the hike tomorrow. I decided against going back and restarting the 100 mile wilderness due primarily to time concerns. ","

Joe Mehan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619227,"It's been a while since I placed an entry. Today I am in Rangeley, Me. Unfortunately I wasn't paying attention and didn't notice that I was arriving on Saturday and wasn't early enough to get to the post office so I will stay until Monday. I have been slowed by pain in my right heel. It's strange sometimes on the plantar and sometimes the Achilles area. The views are stunning. Two mountain summits were obscured by fog like low clouds. I hiked with a trio from a club in Pa. for a few days but have been mostly solo. I chat with other hikers but mostly briefly.  I added a pic of sunrise over Mt Katahdin and one from Avery peak. ","

Joe Mehan,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620340,"I composed an entry on Weds while waiting for my flight a Logan airport during a severe thunderstorm flight delay but I must not have clicked enter. It may be in the ether but I can't find it. So, I will start again. On Monday I finished Maine and crossed the border into New Hampshire. I sense of relief and accomplishment mixed with apprehension over the coming section in the White Mountains - described as the most beautiful but difficult section. I completed Mahousic Notch the day before (acknowledged as the most difficult mile) so I wasn't too worried.Just a few hours later I encountered an Outward Bound youth group coming up the trail. The leader said that they had a large group so I should go by. Normally I would wait but I was in hurry to get to Gentian pond. I went ahead and their group didn't stop. I went out onto a boulder to get around a girl. It had the normal rough granite surface so it didn't look like a problem. As I took my first step my right foot slipped but my left stayed planted and my leg buckled accompanied by a pop and pain. I fell in a heap knowing what had happened immediately. I was lightheaded but didn't pass out. I got to a sitting position and took stock of the situation. The only other injury was an abrasion on my right ring finger. There was a telling deep depression above my knee cap and at the time I  couldn't lift it at all. The group wanted to help but the descent was so steep and rocky they couldn't do much. I had one of the group leaders take my pack down to the bottom where there was a stream. I found that I could lock my leg and it was stable so I started down to finish my descent off Mount Success if you can believe the irony in that. It took me a couple hours to cover the third of a mile to the stream. I met a NOBO(north bounder) named Jim and he was extremely concerned and he had cell service and contacted the ATC who contacted the Fish and Wildlife service who contacted me and had me call 911 to get a GPS fix. I told them that I didn't need an emergency rescue but that I couldn't hike the 12 miles to the nearest trailhead. We agreed that I would camp at the stream and they would come and assist me the next morning. 3 hikers that I had camped with and hiked with over the last couple of weeks were behind me and caught up and helped me find a site to camp. It was getting near dark and it was another mile and a half to Gentian pond so I sent them on. I collected water, set up my hammock, fixed dinner and settled in. As long as my leg was straight I wasn't too uncomfortable. I slept pretty well. In the morning I separated out a few things like snacks, my water filter, medications and clothes to take with me and packed everything else in my pack which I left. I was to hike about 3/4 mile and meet the rangers who would come in on a side trail on ATV's. It took a few hours but I got to the rendezvous site the same time that they did. They could only get the ATV to within a mile. I told them that I didn't want to bushwack that I would certainly trip and injure myself more. Plan B was to go on to Gentian pond and go off on an established side trail where they could get the ATV within about a quarter mile. So I set off again with the two Fish and Wildlife guys. As before I had to do it on my own. They were spotting me on the more difficult sections but really couldn't have caught me if I fallen. We met the third rescuer at the pond and I hiked with him to his ATV. We rode out to his truck and then into Gorham. I stayed a the hostel and made made bus and plane reservations for the next day. The trip went very smoothly except for the weather delay and I got back to Co weds night. I have had my medical evaluation confirming that I will need a surgical repair of my quadriceps tendon next week. The question of will I go back next year will remain unanswerable for some time. I'm not driven to do it and I wouldn't feel like a failure if I didn't do it. If I feel the need to hike I think that I could just as easily start any other trail. Time will tell but first there is recovery and rehab.","
