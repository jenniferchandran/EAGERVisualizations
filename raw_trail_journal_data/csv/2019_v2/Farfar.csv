Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612702,"It’s 2019 and I’m back on the trail continuing my AT section hike. Yesterday I flew into Knoxville to stay with Ruthie Darling and her husband Mike Capps. Last year I had done the same and Ruthie and another college chum, Ellen Todd, had driven me to Standing Bear Hostel to start my thru hike attempt. Standing Bear marks the northern boundary of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. This afternoon Ruthie and Mike dropped me off at Fontana Dam which marks the southern boundary. I walked from the NC 28 road crossing 1.2 miles to this shelter known as the Fontana Hilton. So named for its bathrooms with running water and spacious sleeping decks. 
I’m hiking without my hammock or a tent because as a section hiker I’m required to have reservations at each shelter where I’m planning to stay. I’m not allowed to set up a tent or hammock. The bad news is that I don’t like sleeping in shelters. The good news is that I’ve shed a bunch of weight from my pack, now weighing in at 26 lbs with 7 days of food. I’m worrying about showing up at a shelter with no room and having to ask a thru hiker to leave to make room for me. A hiker suggested I might be doing a thru hiker a favor by allowing her or him to set up their tent. The rule throughout the Smokies is that thru hikers must stay in a shelter unless there’s no room. And like me, many prefer sleeping in their tents or hammocks. 
The plan for this year is to hike the Smokies now and in September hike the two sections remaining in Virginia. Then I’ll have just New Hampshire and Maine left. Of course they’re the two most difficult states. 
I had such a good time with Ruthie and Mike. I must get Joan down to Knoxville to meet them. We’re all retired now so that should be doable. 
The weather forecast looks good for the next few days. Tomorrow’s hike is 11.8 miles which doesn’t sound bad. But it’s all uphill.","Rt 28 road crossing at Fontana Dam

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612704,"I slept OK in the shelter last night. In theory got eight hours but I woke often including four outings to pee. My plan was to rise at 5:00 and be hiking by 6:30 which is exactly what happened despite not setting an alarm. Of course I was the only one up that early which meant being as quiet as a shelter mouse. Another reason I prefer not sleeping in a shelter. 
Though I had but 12 miles to hike today, I wanted the early start knowing I had a mostly uphill day and didn’t know what to expect regarding terrain. And I wanted to get a spot in the shelter. Well it turned out that while it was mostly uphill, the climbs were gradual and the trail was some of the nicest I’ve experienced. Hence I got to this shelter at 12:15. I might have hiked on after eating lunch but with the shelter reservation system for section hikers like me, I had to remain here. I can’t complain however because it’s better to take it slow starting out on a backpacking trip. Especially at my advanced age. 
Lunch was a tasty tuna sub made for me yesterday at Whole Foods in Knoxville. I actually had two sandwiches made. One was for last night’s dinner which I gave away to hungry hungry hikers having just downed a cheeseburger and fries in Fontana Village with Ruthie and Mike. I still have half the tuna sub which I’ll eat for dinner. 
The weather today is absolutely perfect which is making hanging out at the shelter a pleasant experience. 
It’s nice to see all the wildflowers. Violets, trillium, buttercups, irises, and my favorite little bluets to name a few. New to me are spring beauties, another small flower that reminds me of the Canada violet only white. Bluets must be seen in person as photographs don’t do them justice. 
Little bluets line my path
Four pedals of perfect blue 
With a yellow center
Standing in bunches
On dainty stems
Quivering in the breeze
Vying for my attention.","Fontana Dam Shelter

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612705,"Continuing yesterday’s entry, hikers kept arriving and I met some nice people. Two from Germany, Windy and Flower Man, two from England. One woman who arrived at 7:00 had started the day same place as me. She’d started at 7:00 in the morning while I’d started at 6:30. I arrived at 12:15. Just goes to show you how hiking styles vary. 
Today I got up at 5:30, made coffee and ate Golden Grahams with water and two little creamers. On the trail shortly before 7:00. The weather again was perfect, the trail easy and soft underfoot so I was making good miles. I stopped six miles in at Spence Field Shelter where I got water, ate some snacks and called Joan. Feeling good, I estimated my arrival at tonight’s shelter at 12:30.
Then the steep ups and downs began and never really stopped. Two standouts were a very long and rocky descent and a nasty steep uphill just before the shelter. I pulled in at 2:15 exhausted and moving kinda slow. Almost two hours later than I had estimated. Still, getting in so early in the day means time to relax, rest, chat with other hikers and have an early dinner. Tonight’s repast is curry chicken and rice. It’s one of the many dehydrated meals I’d prepared for my thru hike attempt last year. Dehydrated and vacuum sealed, they should still be good. 
While eating dinner I took note of a cook pot I had pulled out of my pack. It was wrapped in a Reflexit cozy. I had yet to use it on this trip. I’ve been using a smaller pot, also with a cozy. I then realized I had packed it by mistake. I guess the cozy had me thinking it was part of my current kit. But it isn’t. I had replaced it with the smaller pot shortly before last year’s hike. Dumb. My punishment is that I’m carrying that extra weight for nothing. And while I’m on the topic, I discovered that I’m carrying my old brown hiking pants’s zip-off legs. I purchased new pants in Knoxville. My old pants mysteriously got a bit too tight. I need to take more care with packing. 
Tomorrow’s hike is a 13 miler. I’ll be staying at the shelter just beyond Clingman’s Dome which happens to be the highest point on the AT. Pretty cool, but it means a major sustained uphill to get there. I’d better start early.","Mollie’s Ridge Shelter

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612706,"Last night brought strong cold winds. I got to experience them each time I got up to pee. Another guy about my age and I agreed to get up at 5:00 and get going at 6:00 in order to make the climb and the 13 miles. We had a pact that whoever woke at 5:00 would wake the other. I woke at 5:13, sprang out of “bed”, and gently jiggled his shoulder which elicited a jolt of surprise. I hit the trail after breakfast at 6:23, he sometime later. I haven’t seen him today and it’s now 7:00. 
The hike up to Clingmans Dome was not too bad. Considering the elevation gain of 1800 feet, it was relatively easy. Not many really steep climbs. I ended up hiking with Billy, a section hiker from Maryland. I enjoy the occasional opportunity to hike with someone. We kept a conversation going up the climb to the Dome and then on to tonight’s shelter. He manages ten Red Lobster restaurants and it was interesting hearing about his job. 
Clingman’s Dome has a cement spiral walkway up to an observation deck with 360 degree views of the Smokies. After that we walked down to the visitor center drawn by rumors of ice cream. It was a long fairly steep road walk. We ended up with bottled water, substandard trail mix and a chocolate bar. No ice cream. The walk back wasn’t fun at all, given the meager rewards. Four miles later at 3:00 we arrived at the shelter. An AT Ridge Runner is here making sure section hikers have reservations. Looks like another full shelter tonight. 
Tomorrow’s hike is just 8 miles. Let’s see what time I get up and out. If I do my usual early start, I’ll be at the shelter before noon. Kind of weird, but that’s my itinerary. 
Forecast calls for potential rain. We’ll see.","Derrick Knob Shelter

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612707,"I woke today at 5:30 after at least eight hours of sleep. Only got up once to pee. Since I had to pee and was wide awake, I started my morning chores. I was hiking at 7:00 and back to the AT at 7:07. I love early morning hiking. I’m strong, energetic, no aches or pains, and the light in the forest is magical. Made more so by the moss covering all the many downed trees. 
I arrived at Newfound Gap at 9:00. The road there takes you into Gatlinburg TN, 15 miles to the west. Many hikers take a day there to rest and resupply. I called Joan and waited for Billy to arrive. We hiked together to my shelter where he went on to the next. I will miss him. 
It’s pretty funny arriving at my day’s destination at 10:55 in the morning. But like I’ve said, I’m in no rush to finish the Smokies and hiking on an itinerary forces me to stay. I changed clothes and hung up my wet sweaty ones, got water, ate nuts and a mini meat stick. Two couples around my age stopped by. One of them, Faye and David Nova from Roanoke VA, were particularly interesting to chat with. He’d thru hiked the AT southbound back in 1981 and has also thru hiked the PCT. He plans to section hike the CDT. Recently they took six months to travel and visit many of the national parks. They offered to help me out in September when I hike in Virginia. There’s a train from New York to Roanoke where they’d meet me, put me up for the night, and get me to the trail in Daleville where I stopped last year. I’m thinking I may just take them up on that. 
Icewater Spring is a really nice shelter with a great view of the mountains and a spring just 75 easy yards up the trail delivering, you guessed it, ice water. Lots of younger hikers here too who often crack me up with their banter. 
Tomorrow’s hike is 12.6.","Mt Collins Shelter

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612708,"The young hikers at the shelter last night began to get on my nerves when they kept yacking it up till after 9:00. Then one of them who slept inches from me in the shelter started right up with loud snoring that went on non stop. His snoring kept me awake till after midnight. I felt around for my ice pick so I could stab my eye to distract me from the incessant noise. 
But I did finally get to sleep and honestly it’s partly my fault. I had taken a brief nap during my leisurely afternoon so I wasn’t as fatigued as I might have been when it came to beddy-bye. I got up just once to pee but by 5:15 I needed to go again, so it was another early morning. 
The fog was pretty thick when I took off just before 7:00, but by the time I got to Charlie’s Bunion, a well-known vista site on the AT a mile up the trail, the sun was poking through and the views were beautiful. 
Again I felt strong today and perhaps hiking better than I ever have. Not as strong on the climbs as I’d become last year on my thru hike attempt, but faster on level and downhill trail. And pretty much pain free. I’m inclined to attribute this to the stretching and body alignment exercises Joan and I have been doing every day since the beginning of the year. Thanks to our friend Cindy for putting us in touch with the book “Pain Free”.  I’m also using my poles less and less. Mostly just to power me up the hills and to steady me on the steeper descents. I hike faster when I carry the poles at my sides at their fulcrum point, arms swinging naturally. My gait feels more natural and I walk more upright. I think it also improves my balance. 
I arrived here at today’s shelter at 12:45, just before the rain started.  I’d been squirted off and on throughout the hike and so now my hiking clothes are fairly soaked. Not to mention smelly after five days of use. Unless it dries up a bit this afternoon, I’ll be putting on cold wet clothes in the morning. 
Tomorrow is my shortest day on this hike at 7.7 miles. It would be embarrassing to pull in for the day while people are still enjoying their breakfast.","Icewater Spring Shelter

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612709,"Up at 6:15, out at 7:40, arrived at my day’s destination at 11:00. I’ll have to call this a nero. It was either that or hike on another 10.7 to Standing Bear Hostel, arriving a day early. Two problems with that. It would mean 18 miles of mostly downhill which might have caused my shins to flare up and since my flight home out of Knoxville isn’t till Monday, I’d have to take a zero at Standing Bear, which doesn’t have the best reputation on the trail. So here I am. 
Flower Man was here having lunch when I arrived. He’s from Germany. We got to talking about how nice the Smokies are and how we’re perplexed as to why so many thru hikers complain about them. I guess it’s the regulations in place here and nowhere else on the AT. K-Town also arrived for lunch. I’ve enjoyed talking with this Korean hiker. I hung out with him yesterday afternoon. 
Like last night’s shelter, this one also has a water source right close by. This is somewhat of a rarity. And every water source in the Smokies is a piped spring. Nice. That means you don’t have to scoop up pooled water that’s got leaves and water bugs floating about. 
There’s one species of bird, the junco, that’s been accompanying me all throughout my hike. At the shelters they seem to be pretty relaxed around hikers, foraging around for what?  Pop Tart crumbs?  Quite a few robins as well. 
Now it’s after 1:00 and a bunch of hikers are here stopping for lunch. They were all at last night’s shelter. Either they left much later than I or I’ve become a much faster hiker. I like to think the latter. K-Town was impressed that I made it as quickly as I did because he left just after me and arrived nearly a half hour later. And these are thru hikers. 
Early afternoon came the hard rain. And it went on for a few hours. Then came the soaking wet hikers. Lots of them. I’m really not used to hiking in the thru hiker bubble. They’re good people, just too many of them. The shelter is filled to beyond capacity. There’s limited cook and eat space so I cooked and ate at 4:30. The rain stopped around 4:00 and the sun came out. Three gentlemen weekenders arrived and I got talking with them. I took them up on their offer of bourbon. It was called Larceny and it was super smooth. 
This place will be a zoo tomorrow morning so I’ll try and slip out early for my 10.7 to Standing Bear.","Tri-Corner Knob Shelter

Farfar,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612710,"It rained most of the night. I was the first one up this morning and there was a short respite from the rain while I breakfasted and packed up. On the trail at 6:45. Soon the rain started again and has kept up all day, pretty heavy for a couple of hours. Aside from an easy but long climb up Camerere Mountain, it was a long, long downhill to Davenport Gap Shelter where I stopped for a snack. 
I had a thought during the rain. Why spend the night at the hostel if perhaps Mike could pick me up this afternoon?  This way I could avoid staying overnight, could really clean up at Mike’s, and enjoy time with him. It also makes tomorrow easier. We’ll just need to get me to the Knoxville airport. I can’t get my phone to work in the rain. When my fingers and the waterproof case are wet the phone doesn’t recognize my finger taps. So when I got to a rock overhang, I ducked in, removed the phone from its case and called Mike. Eventually we connected and he’s able to make the switch. He’ll be here around 3:00. 
Towards the end of the hike I passed under I-40 where some lovely people had set up an elaborate table of trail magic. They made me a PBJ sandwich and offered me the run of the table. I gulped down an orange soda, grabbed a candy bar and moved on. It was a bit confusing to me finding the hostel, but as fortune had it, down walked K-Town who was just returning from there. Good thing, as I was about to head in the wrong direction. The trail provides. 
My thoughts on the Smokies. So far it’s been the most beautiful section of the AT. Of course I haven’t done New Hampshire or Maine.  The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is a long wide chunk of land tilting to the northeast in western NC with the AT running 71 miles through its center, offering countless views of the mountains. Views rarely show any indication of civilization. You don’t hear roads and highways. There are almost no steep ups or downs. The footbed is often soft and fairly rock free. There are no boulder scrambles. Though the AT has a long climb getting in and a long descent getting out, neither require undo effort. Hiking the Smokies in late April/early May offers a wide variety of wildflowers along the trail. Though I saw a few deer, many other hikers reported seeing bears and wild pigs, an invasive species here. Shelters were large in good repair, having been recently enlarged with added porch overhangs. Many had fireplaces inside. Water sources were piped springs. Weather was mostly perfect until the last two days when the rain started. Even so I only hiked through continuous heavy rain on my last day. To anyone interested in giving backpacking a try and who was not particularly interested in tenting, I’d recommend the AT through the Smokies, though I might suggest starting later in May to avoid such a large northbound thru hiker crowd. 
Final thoughts on this hike. It was really good to be back on the trail. It does my soul good.  Though I’d been apprehensive about staying in the shelters, it turned out to be not so bad. I used my Exped Downmat sleeping pad which was quite comfortable. It has a built-in inflator pump. No huffing and puffing required. My Katabatic down quit kept me warm. I chose not to use my ear buds while hiking which I’m glad for. This was in part because I was concerned about battery power over seven days and also that my days were short. This gave me even more time to get lost in my own thoughts. As I’ve mentioned, my body, legs and feet gave me no aches or pains. This could have been due to my shorter days, but it was more than that. I really think I was in better physical shape this year than last and that my body was in better alignment due to the daily stretching exercises Joan and I have been doing. While I appreciated the shorter days with their accompanying benefits:  getting my choice of shelter spots and having the opportunity to relax and enjoy being out in the woods, I could have easily chopped a day off this trip and still enjoyed a relaxed experience. 
I look forward to my Virginia hike in September.","Cosby Knob Shelter
