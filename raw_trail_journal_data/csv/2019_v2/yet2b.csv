yet2b,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521460,"[I originally set a start date of 2020 - but have decided that was too far into the future. I have accelerated my debt retirement schedule and have also decided to forgo the purchase of a new car which now allows me to start the AT one year earlier. The car decision was kinda hard (I am a car guy) as I will be keeping my 2008 MX-5 for 11 years. I have never had a car that long in my entire life.===>] Hiking the Appalachian Trail, now that is a thought that has been in my mind for more than a few years. However to borrow from T. S. Eliot, “Between the idea and the reality - Between the motion and the act - Falls the shadow” and therefore I must ask myself is this really a possibility or perhaps just a pipe dream. The answer to this question will sure to be revealed across time. As it turns out, my ‘outdoor’ credentials are relatively strong. I began camping early on what with some family camping trips followed by Church Camp and then the Boy Scouts. I have been lucky enough to backpack/camp in a variety of different states: PA, NY, KY, IN, TN, CO, UT, AZ, ME, FL, GA, NC, and SC. My wife and I lived in Gunnison Colorado (as well as the Boulder/Longmont area) for a time and were actively involved with hiking/backpacking/cross country skiing. I have also had the chance to backpack/camp in Canada, England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, Ireland, Belgium, Netherlands, Austria, and Switzerland. I have had the opportunity to winter camp on a variety of occasions, cross country skiing (and snow shoeing) into the Colorado backcountry as well a time or two in the scouts and one occasion in February 1977 with a psychologist friend in the Joyce Kilmer Memorial Forest in NC. I lived for a time just outside of Robbinsville, NC - just a few miles from the trailhead.   I have hiked up a fair number of mountains (e.g.) Uncompahgre Peak in Colorado elevation 14,308 ft; Schynige Platte in Switzerland elevation 6,811ft; Spence Field in Cades Cove Elevation 5,044 ft), Sassafras Mountain elevation 3,554ft on the Foothills trail (highest point in SC). My wife and I had the pleasure of backpacking to the bottom of the Grand Canyon and back out in two days (one night). Descending elevation change from rim to river is 4,860 ft, along a 6.3 mile trail and ascending elevation change is 4,460 ft from river to rim along a 7.8 mile trail. [Upon reflection - I used the word pleasure to describe the experience of hiking the Grand Canyon; that may not be an entirely accurate descriptor. It was actually one of the toughest things I have ever done (especially hiking out). We were not entirely prepared for the experience in that we were car camping at the time and the opportunity just presented itself (a couple backed out at the last minute & and we snapped up their trail pass). We ended up hiking with full packs camping at the bottom of the canyon (this was well before lightweight camping gear - circ. 1979. I never thought to ask (kinda dumb) but for some reason I didn't think there would be drinking water at the bottom so I carried down a gallon of water (8.3 lbs). Since it was only an overnight pass we had to hike out the next day and I hadn't really recovered from the hike down. Toward the end of the hike out I trying to figure out the cost of helicopter rescue (my ego - and wallet - wouldn't allow for that option). Nevertheless it was one of my all-time favorite adventures - short as it was.] The majority of my backpacking trips were two to three day affairs, though a good friend and I once camped on an island off the coast of Maine for a week and on another occasion spent a week camping on a small island in middle of a lake in Canada, somewhere above Quebec (though i've forgotten its name - CRS). I also managed to convince my wife that we should spend our honeymoon backpacking through Europe (a ten week trip). On paper this all sounds good. I’m almost impressed. Thing is…...these outings all took place more than thirty-two (+) years ago!!! My focus on the outdoors screeched to a halt once my wife and I began having children. [I am certain that this scenario rings a bell of most of the ‘oldsters’ who decide to take on the Appalachian Trail] What with raising three sons and growing a psychology practice, there was little room left over for hiking and camping. This was especially true when my sons became interested in soccer. At one point in time all three of my sons competed in ‘Classic’ soccer (aka travel soccer) which for more than a few years dictated how our weekends were spent, but I digress. With the exception of an occasional cub scout campout, a trip to Cades Cove in the Smoky Mountains, or camping in the infield at Road Atlanta I have not backpacked since 1983 (a weekend trip to Shining Rock Wilderness Area in NC). During the child rearing years the desire to hike the Appalachian trail was a flame that had almost flickered out. At the present point in time, February 2016, my sons are now all grown (ages: 30, 27, 25). Over the past few years I have gotten back into the “outdoors” and have been fairly involved with kayaking. In fact I even built a strip wood kayak and use it frequently (it helps to live on a lake) - often kayaking 3-4 hours at a time. Last fall (September and October) I decided to take my kayak on two four day solo camping trips, kayaking to a primitive campground on a relatively large lake located in SC (Jocassee - 7,500 acres). These two trips were simply awesome and reawakened my interest in camping - despite the fact that it nearly rained 24/7 on the first outing. The timing of these trips was most excellent (Thursday to Sunday) and I had the entire primitive campsite to myself for most of the time I spent at Jocassee. These two trips reignited my thoughts of hiking the AT. Not long after the second of these two outings, I casually mentioned that I was pondering a thru hike of the AT to one of my former clients. A week or so later he dropped by my office giving me a copy of The A.T. Guide Northbound 2016. It was all down hill from there. For Christmas I received a copy of The Appalachian Trials: A Psychological and Emotional Guide To Thru-Hike the Appalachian from my wife (I think she was trying to scare me) as well as a copy of Bill Bryson’s A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail. The final straw that broke the camel’s back was a large 36x24 framed map of the AT given to me by one of my sons. Now I can’t stop thinking about it.
So here we are. I just turned 64 earlier this month and cannot, for a variety of reasons, begin my AT journey until 2019 which will make me 67 when I climb Springer Mountain. Not exactly over the hill, but not exactly a ‘spring chicken’. I am confident in my camping skills but age has now intervened and while healthy and reasonably active through the years, I fully acknowledge that I am not in physical shape (at the moment) to tackle the AT. I am quite stubborn though and I have more than ample time to prepare myself from a physical standpoint. Beginning in January I have been walking everyday anywhere from 3 to seven miles depending on the available time. I will continue to walk on a daily basis increasing the mileage as time permits. I will across time, begin again to do some hiking in the mountains and as I build my endurance and strength I will begin to take some shorter backpacking trips gradually increasing the duration and difficulty the the hikes. Prior to taking on the the AT I plan to hike the Foothills trail in SC (76 miles) on at least one occasion, perhaps two, in order to test my resolve as well as my equipment choices. I will across time give some updates as to my progress. I wonder how many people begin a trail journal such as this and end up never stepping onto the trail? Here's to hoping that I will not fall into that particular category and can turn the idea into reality. Stay tuned if you would like. I will across time give some updates as to my progress.

yet2b,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/535995,"Well here I am a few months after my first posting. I have done fairly well with my preparation, as it relates to walking: 88.6 miles in January, 103 miles in February, 132.5 miles in March,111.7 in April, and 93.1 May. While these number are not particularly impressive, keep in mind they occurred while maintaining a full time psychology practice while keeping alive my kayaking and boating interests. Altogether I have walked some 528.9 miles (1,198.915 steps) or approximately 1/4 of the A.T. My mindset has not changed and I remain committed to thru-hiking the A.T. and have informed most of my friends who, by and large, have been supportive. My wife is supportive though she wonders what she will keep herself occupied for some six months. I recently did (another - 3rd time altogether) a four day solo kayaking trip to Lake Jocassee (SC) to a primitive campsite and had the chance to practice my rain avoidance skills as it rained for two out the four day trip. I used a tarp for my Lawson Hammock for the first time. I had purchased a lightweight Apex Camping Shelter (tarp) for the trip but it did not arrive in time, so I used an old plastic (blue) tarp. For the A.T. I will be using a cuban fiber tarp. I also had the chance to practice my fire starting skills with my Bio-lite woodburner. The Biolite is too heavy for the A.T. but I am kinda sold on using a wood burner stove (though I reserve the right to change my mind). I am going to try to post some pictures with this entry (one of the kayak trip along with some photos documenting my efforts at walking). Check back later if you would like.

This is the first of many day hikes that I plan to take. Paris Mountain State Park is only a stone's throw from my home (34 minutes). My daily walking seemed to pay off and I experienced no particular difficulty with the 6.7 mile hike ( didn't weigh my day pack but I loaded it with some nonessentials (including my dslr that weighs a ton).

I continue to walk nearly every day and have included the statistics for the year. I will post a few pictures with this journal entry (assuming I remember how).

Once again I recognize that my mileage is far from impressive, however I am still working full time and enjoying other pursuits as well. I just returned from a four day kayak camping trip to Lake Jocassee (SC) to a primitive campsite (4th trip). I am fairly comfortable now with setting up my Hammock and for the first time used a decent supplemental tarp (though it was bone dry for this trip - I am not usually that lucky). I will post a handful of the pictures from the trip. I will be doing another four day trip at the very beginning of November.

I have continued my efforts at walking and for the most part have been relatively consistent, though I did find it difficult once the time change went into effect, what with the daylight hours shortened. I tried as best I could to walk more on the weekends. I am somewhat disappointed that I did not get out to hike some of the local trails as I had planned. I blame it on the fact that I live on a lake and enjoy kayaking as much as hiking. I resolve to do better in 2017. I will post a screen shot of my hiking miles for the year. I did another four day solo kayaking trip to Lake Jocassee in November (5th time) and, once again had the primitive campground largely to myself (since I went mid week). I did some walking around, though there are no really trails. I am growing very comfortable with setting up my Lawson Hammock and will be using it (albeit in a lightened form) for my A.T. thru hike. I will post a picture or two from the Jocassee trip. I am excited about Christmas, as Santa will be bringing me a Gossamer Gear Mariposa 60 UL pack. I will be reviewing in the gear portion of the blog. I will be retiring my Moab Ventilator shoes after a year of use and am looking forward to starting the year with a new pair of La Sportiva low cut shoes. Once again I will provide some feedback on these later down the road. At the urging of my wife I finally got around to having a physical. I have not felt the need to have one for the past few years (well actually I have not had one for twenty years or so). Turns out that all of my blood work was well within normal limits and my doc was impressed that I am taking no prescription medications. He ""signed off"" on my desire to hike the A.T. If I could leave today I would, but alas I must twiddle my thumbs for two more years. Stay tuned to see if my resolve strengthens or weakens. T-minus 779 days and counting, down.

yet2b,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553273,"Grrrrr. For those of you who have been following along, remember the MX 5 that I decided to keep so that I could start the AT sooner than later. Well this past Wednesday night I was motoring home on the interstate - actually I was returning home from an REI ""So you want to hike the Appalachian Trail"" workshop when my oil pressure gauge dropped to 0 as if a magnet had grabbed hold of it. ""What the heck"" I said to myself -- actually the verbiage was a tad more colorful. I figured that it had to be an electronic glitch and I began to study the water temperature gauge thinking that if there was a problem that the temperature would rise. I motored on for a tad longer with nothing happening and I was thinking 'all is good', that is until noticed the smell of oil and began seeing some smoke. I pulled off the interstate to the shoulder and called for a tow truck. Kinda scary having those eighteen wheeler whiz by while waiting for big Tom (Tom's Wrecker Service). Upon having it flat bedded to the Mazda dealership it was discovered that the plug on the oil pan had blown out. I had had the oil changed at a Quickie Lube (not its real name) in late November. It would appear that they did not tighten the plug correctly. Price of a new engine from Mazda ----->    + $ 8000.00. Not sure how this is going to alter my plans for hiking the AT in 2019. I will be of course having a word of prayer with the folks at Quicki Lube.     =========> 02/21/17 Well here is the update. I could write several pages but I'll keep it brief. Somewhat amazingly, the lube shop assumed responsibility for the engine failure and wrote a check for nearly 9K to replace the motor. Funny thing, it is nigh impossible to find a new engine or even remanufactured engine for a 2008 Miata (I had two dealerships and two private Japanese Specialist shops looking). After some five weeks without a car and no solid prospects of ever finding one I reached a tipping point and threw in the towel, though I can't complain as I pulled the trigger on a 2017 MX 5 RF. I have decided to not let this situation affect my start date so I remain committed to February 2019.=====04/30/17  So I had my MX5 RF for less than one month (less than 1,000) mile when the Greenville area was treated to a wonderful hail storm.  That new car now has over $ 7,000.00  of damage. I have never had such bad luck with cars. [BTW my wife's car also had over $ 7,000 worth of damage].  The earliest appointment date at the body shop (06/12/17).  I'll stop venting now.  ====> 11/18/17  Well I finally got my car back, though the body shop had it for seven weeks or so.  I was thoroughly impressed with their work.  A few weeks after I got my car back I had to take it to the Mazada shop for some minor work (wind noise).  I sat in the customer waiting room for several hours and was getting somewhat miffed as they initially said it might only take an hour or so.  Finally one of the services advisers wandered back informing me that two mechanics just left to take my car for a test drive and that I should be ready to go shortly.  Not but five minutes later the head service manager walked sheepishly into the customer waiting room to inform me that there had been an ""incident"" with my car (i.e. it had been involved in an accident and that the police were investigating the matter).  A vehicle had ""blown"" by my car with the two mechanics, swerved in front of them and ran smack into a tractor trailer truck at which time car parts were flying everywhere.  He did not have any info as to what if any damage had been done to my car.  This particular service manager had been with me through the entire ordeal described above.  My reaction, I just started laughing.  It was just far too ironic that I would get my car back only to have it involved in an accident. Some 30 minutes later, I happened to see my car motor back into the dealership.  Turns out that I (as well as the two mechanics in my car) lucked out, as there were only a couple of minor scratches as (from the mechanics descriptions) it could have been so much worse.  I am once again dealing with insurance carriers to get the scratches taken care of.  No complaints I'm happy that the mechanics weren't injured and that my car is intact.

yet2b,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555097,"Well I experienced my first trail magic this afternoon (well kinda sorta) even though I will not start the AT for 716 days. I have been walking the road near my house for the past fourteen months doing some long term preparations for my 2019 run at the AT. One of my neighbors (Minnie) stopped me and asked it I ate sweets. I informed her that I was on a Seafood Diet, if I see food I eat it- especially sweets. She told me to stop by later and she would give me a couple slices of her ""Do Nothing Cake"". After eating a slice, I am told, you will want to ""Do Nothing"". It sure worked for me though I am glad that I got my walk (5.1 miles) finished before eating her cake. I continue to walk as often as I can. I have a couple of short backpacking trips planned in the relative near future and hope to hike the length of the Foothills trail in SC/NC (76 miles) later this year.

yet2b,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558361,"First backpacking trip in 34 years. I don’t expect anyone to be impressed as this outing was just a chance to test out some of my gear upgrades. The trip to North Lake @ Paris Mountain State Park (Greenville, SC) was only a short one night outing +3 mile in and +3 mile out. It is not an especially difficult trail (the park rates 3 different sections of the trail as a 9, 7, 6 => on a scale of 0-10). This was my first outing with my Mariposa 60 backpack by Gossamer gear. It is light years ahead of my former pack (purchased in 1977) Lowes Expedition made of of rather stout, but heavy Cordua. The Mariposa 60 weighs under 2 lbs. My pack weight for this outing was at thirty pounds with food and 4 liters of water. I will be shooting for a (winter) pack weight of 28 lbs including consumables for the AT. The Mariposa was stuffed quite full, primarily because most of my gear is +30 years old. My 0 degree sleeping bag was bought through REI in 1977, down on top and synthetic on the bottom. It took up half of my pack as it is not so compressible. The pack was quite comfortable on the trail and handled the 30 lbs with ease. I used my new ultralight tree straps for my hammock that weigh on 2.3 oz versus my tree hugger straps that weigh over 1 lbs. I also used my La Sportiva Synthesis hiking shoes for the first time with a pack. The La Sportiva shoes are quite comfortable. I have logged some three hundred mile in them this year. No blisters. I will be posting some pictures from this outing. I am still walking most days averaging about a 100 mile a month. I am still planning to hike the Foothills Trail (border of NC/SC) this fall.

Most every part of my body was aching when I finally hobbled into the campground. From what I understand aches and pains such as this (for an oldster at least) is fairly common on the AT.  I wondered how I was going to sleep, but a couple of Advil PM and I slept like a baby in my Lawson hammock.  I am absolutely convinced that I would not have survived the night had I slept in a tent on the ground.  I got up the next day and felt reasonably okay but decided to cut the weight of my pack in half.  I was dragging though and nursing a blister and only managed to only hike ten miles.  It was another hot and muggy day.  I knew that a rain storm was on the way so I battened down the hatches and weathered a fairly torrential rain storm that seemed to last much of the night.  I decided to do some reading while listening to the rain, a Stephen King novel. The story is about a nine year old girl lost in the woods (actually on the AT) ...and some ""thing"" is tracking her. It didn't help that a strong wind blew over a large tree while I was reading.   I was going to hike the next day but it was still raining (and I have yet to purchase rain gear) so I returned home. So what did I learn.  I am not quite ready for my Foothills hike this fall (76 mile over five days).  I will need to walk more with a pack.  Also, a 32 pound pack is too heavy for me at this point.  Other than my pack (Mariposa 60 - by Gossamer Gear) as well as a few other odds and ends I have not yet purchased much in the way of lightweight gear.  I will trying to rectify that over the summer.  I ordered some carbon fiber tubing to replace the steel spreader bars for my Lawson hammock.  I am also changing out the heavy paracord with ASR Tactical Technora Ultra Composite Survival Cord/Rope.  It is half the weight and size of the rigging that was on the hammock (rated at 450 lbs) which will help.  I also have on order a Primus OmniLite Ti Stove (multi-fuel) and much lighter than my  BioLite woodturner (which I hate to give up).  I will trying uploading some pictures from the outing.  Looks like I have much more work to do before my Foothills Trail trip this Fall (and the AT in 2019).  All of a sudden it does not seem so far away.",,Katahdin (eventually),"May 21, Sun",0

I was able to test my new gear in difficult circumstances and was quite happy with my choices (e.g. top quilt/bottom quilt, trekking poles, Steripen, lightweight pack etc).  All in all I believe the hike gave me a fair representation of what a long distance thru hike might feel like.  The fact that the weather was less than pleasant while not appreciated at the time, probably gave me a better idea of what true thru hiking can be like (embrace the suck).  Many lessons were learned.  If interested, check out my Foothills Trail blog.",,Table Rock State Park,"Nov 18, Sat",0

My base weight ended up being just a tad over 16 lbs which is a pound or so more than I hope to have at the start of my hike in GA (early February) and with consumables (for this short trip I was at 24 lbs).   I had a number of items in my pack that will not make the final cut so I am sure that I can get my base weight under 15 lbs with total weight of no more than 25 lbs. for the AT.   I have family who (literally) live just off the trail in Daleville, VA and I will be jettisoning much of my cold weather gear there.  For this quick trip I hiked a tad over 13 mile on day one and 7.5 miles on day two.  I look forward to some longer trips over the next year to continue to fine tune my gear choices.

In November I went for an 80 mile thru-hike of the Foothills Trail (7.5 days) without problems -rained heavily for 4 of the days.  In December and January I noticed that the jacket was beginning to fail.  In late January I walked in a mild to moderate rain for some five miles and when I got home I was soaked.  I was wearing a competitor's rain pants and my legs were bone dry.   Marmot customer service worked with me offering a $200.00 voucher to purchase any of their other products (I was impressed with how easy they were to work with).  I replaced it with a Marmot Phoenix Jacket (EVODry).  It performed admirably in my walk today, the first that I have had the chance to use it in rain.  It did seem to wet out at the bottom of the sleeves but elsewhere all remained dry.  I also had the chance for the first time (ever) to try some waterproof socks (Randy Sun).   My Salomon Men's XA Pro 3D are mesh trail runners and wet out rather easily.  I could feel my feet squishing around in my Salomon's but the waterproof socks kept me perfectly dry and my feet were not wet from sweat either (though it was a relatively cool 67º).  I doubt I would ever wear these socks on a warm day, but I am sure they will be appreciated when walking in rain at 32.5º next February and March.

I have backpacked and camped in some rather wet weather and for the most part have been able to “embrace the suck” without it breaking my resolve. I have not had the chance  (this year) to experience any colder temperatures as the weather has not been cooperative (I have seen some temperatures in the upper 20’s), but am hoping to have at least one outing in January with colder temperatures.  Theoretically I should be able to be relatively comfortable in single digits - time will tell.  The weather reports for 2019 are predicting a colder and wetter year here in the Southeast.  I have, across the time that I have been preparing, become quite familiar with  all of my gear and I only have a few minor odds and ends to purchase (e.g Superfeet insoles, iPhone wallet).    All things considered time has passed rather quickly across the past three years.  I have been fairly consistent in my training regime and my stamina has increased where steep inclines are not quite as challenging as they once were.  I think riding my wife’s recumbent bike in the mornings has helping.  I plan to begin doing some upper body conditioning across these final forty-one days, as well as working on some stretching exercises.  At this juncture there is not much more that I will be able to accomplish as it relates to physical preparation.  I have some Internet acquaintances who are soon to start the AT (e.g. Subman will be starting tomorrow -  best of luck), so I will be vicariously enjoying their efforts until my upcoming departure date (02/11/19).  To those taking the time to read my journal, thanks for following along.  It looks like [“Between the idea and the reality - Between the motion and the act - Falls the shadow”] that I have been able to to turn the idea of hiking the AT into reality.  I think I mentioned some three years ago that I am a stubborn fellow.  Now we will get to see if my preparations along with my stubbornness will translate to making it all the way to Katahdin.  As I am fond of saying, “time will tell”.",,Katahdin....eventually,"Dec 31, Mon",0

So I parked my car at the campsite, donned my pack and hike up and around North Lake, getting back to the campsite around 4:00.  Sure enough there was a ranger eyeing me as I walk through the campsite.  She parked her truck and sauntered over to my campsite.  Evidently they have folks that come in an sleep in there cars, which is prohibited.  My car had sat at the campsite all day, with no camping gear visible.  She had just been talking  with the ranger station about my car (though she said she didn’t think I’d be sleeping in my car - two seater MX 5).  Turns out she was very pleasant  and was a hiker herself (trail name ‘Snow’).  She was very curious about my training and my upcoming attempt at a through hike.   We talked for a half hour or so.  I had an hour or so of day light and went about setting up my hammock, made dinner and all of a sudden it was dark.  Given that the temperatures were dropping I climbed into my hammock at about 7:00 or so.  Nighttime temperature dropped to 32 degrees (I was hoping for a cold night).  I was quite comfortable, even a little warm.

On Thursday I saw the last of my clients and spent the rest of that day and Friday  working on paperwork to close out and transfer my case load. Saying farewell to all of my clients was a little more challenging than I thought.  Some that I thought would be emotional were not and some that I thought would never show the emotion, did.   It is Monday morning and it is quite odd to realize I don’t have to go in to work today, that my practice is essential on pause (for six months).   I still have a few things to take care of an will probably cruise in to the office for an hour or so.  I then have a variety of things to attend to around the house (e.g. Dr. Flush is coming tomorrow - to clean out the septic tank).
I received a package in the mail on Thursday +$200.00 of freeze dried food (Mountain House and Greenbelly).  There are two sections of the AT that are relatively long where resupplying can be difficult. Hiking through the Smoky Mountain National Park takes about seven days and hiking through the 100 mile wilderness in Maine takes about ten days.  I will be sending myself supplies for both of those sections of the trail.  Some hikers mail provisions to themselves the entire time they are on the trail, which to me seems like a logistic nightmare.  I have been on a ‘time clock’ of sorts my whole professional career and plan to be as spontaneous as I can on this journey and not have to worry about being at a certain place at a certain time.   By the way as I was looking at all the supplies I started to wonder how well it would keep, given that I would not be mailing the Maine package until August.  I shouldn’t have worried, as the package indicated that it was good until 2048 (OMG what am I eating).  Well I have rambled long enough.  T-14 days.","

The following comments are meant for some of my friends and family who may not be so familiar with the Appalachian Trail (A.T.).  The A.T. is a narrow footpath that is some 2,189 miles (or if you prefer, 5 million steps) in length stretching from Amicalola Falls State Park in Georgia to a mountain top in Maine (Katahdin).   It is actually the longest “hiking only” trail in the entire world.  It passes through a veritable bevy of states: 1. Georgia 2. North Carolina 3. Tennessee 4. Virginia 5. West Virginia 6. Maryland 7. Pennsylvania 8. New Jersey 9. New York 10. Connecticut 11. Massachusetts 12. Vermont 13. New Hampshire  and finally, 14. Maine.  Since its inception (1937) only about 15,000 people have successfully thru-hiked the entire trail.  Some four thousand people attempt a thru hike each year, but only twenty-five percent actually complete.  Many drop out within the first fifty miles. About 750 people in their 60s have completed thru-hikes, but only about 50 people age 70 and above have completed thru-hikes. Two people in their 80s have completed a thru-hike; the oldest was 82.  One fellow last year was 89 but he ended up not finishing. No one actually thru-hiked the trail until 1948.  The typical time frame to hike the trail ranges from about four to seven months.  I will be shooting for six, due to taking about one day a week off to regroup / recuperate / resupply. A fellow last year managed to complete the trail in 45 days, 12 hours and 15 minutes.  The A.T. is not a flat footpath.  Thru-hikers gain and lose some 464,464 ft in their trek, it has been said that it is like climbing and descending Mt Everest sixteen times.  Hikers must consume about 5,000 to 6,000 a day to stave off weight loss.  Double bacon cheeseburgers, extra large fries, and large milkshakes - here I come.  Even so it is not uncommon to lose 20-50 lbs, depending  one’s starting weight.  I have three pair of hiking shoes ‘locked and loaded’ and more than likely will require a fourth pair before I finish.
Well this will likely be my last preparation trail entry, as come Monday I will be taking off from Amicalola Falls State Park.  With respect to the aforementioned question - Am I ready?   Stay tuned, the answer to that question will be revealed across the coming six months.",,Soon to arrive at Amicalola Falls State Park,"Feb 06, Wed",0
yet2b,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607054,"Day 1 Monday 02/11/19. 8.8 miles on the approach trail, but only .2 miles on The AT.  Well the journey has begun. I said goodbye to Kathy at the Amicalola Falls ranger station and began the long walk to the top of the falls (a.k.a. the approach trail).  As I was beginning the 600 steps to the top of the falls someone had written on the stairs with a sharpie “far too many steps turn around now“. Quite surprisingly I didn’t find the steps all that difficult, perhaps all my training in the mountains might’ve paid off. I stopped at the Hiker Inn and had a cup of coffee and some peach cobbler, which was delicious by the way. While there, one of the volunteers at the Inn told me about her extended section hike on the Appalachian Trail which took some 12 years to complete. Her hike her name was Early Riser.  I left the Inn and hiked for an hour or so and ran into a woman who also told me she was a section hiker and had completed the entire Appalachian Trail, although it took her 12 years. I told her I was a very perceptive person and I said I suspect your hiking partner was a woman named Early Riser. She (Icy) just looked at me and wondered how I knew that. I smiled and told her that I just ran into her hiking partner back at the Inn.  It was just kind of odd and at the same time pretty cool to have run into both of them. I didn’t see any thru hikers today but I did run into many day hikers and some section hikers. My hiker registration number is 101, which I rather like. I guess in the greater scheme of things it doesn’t really matter. Day one is over with no falls, one slip and one stumble but all in all a fairly uneventful day.  When  I started it was 42° and it end around 50°. The entire day was spent hiking in the mist and fog with no sunshine whatsoever. I crawled into my Hammock about 6:30 and within about five minutes it began raining. All in all I’m pretty happy with the first day out on the trail. It does look like tomorrow however is going to be a rather wet one.

Well, day two is now in the books and a very inauspicious one if I must say so (whopping) 2.8mile. Last night was a bit of a booger. The tarp connectors on the ridgeline of my tarp were not staying tight and therefore my tarp sagged against the windsock of my hammock. As a result the windsock rubbed against my hammock and consequentially my  under quilt absorbed some of the moisture. It was necessary for me to go outside in the driving rain on a couple occasions to readjust it.  Finally I solved the problem. Unfortunately much of my gear was fairly “moist“ come morning. In the morning i packed up my gear and ambled down to where Shannon and Anne sheltered for the night. They were good Catholic girls and shared some of their bourbon with me in part to celebrate my 67th birthday (yesterday). We chatted for a while and I repacked my gear and did not really leave the shelter until 10:30 or so. I walked for a couple of hours until the rain began. About that point, somewhere around 1:30 I decided to take a break at the Stover Creek shelter so as to wait out the rain. Unfortunately the rain never stopped so I decided to stay. Most of the day was spent relaxing, drying out my gear and taking a snooze or two. I was disappointed by the short mileage gained today but decided that discretion was the better part of valor given the heavy rain.  I will now have relatively dry gear and can begin an early start in the morning.","

Making the decision to hunker down yesterday because of the prodigious amounts of rain in the end, did make sense. It was 32° in the morning when I woke up and almost everything that I had, had dried out overnight. Even though it was rather chilly in the morning it was nice to see sunshine for the first time, though it never exactly warmed up all day. There was a strong breeze through most of the day which while pretty,  was somewhat chilly. Just as it was turning dark last night a fellow thru hiker (Steven) arrived at the shelter (Stover Creek) from Hungary. He did not speak a great deal of English although we chatted a little bit. My wife has always found it rather frustrating that I can fall asleep in moments and then begin snoring. I was quite surprised as Steven from Hungary was able to fall asleep almost instantly and yes, began snoring.  Ear plugs didn’t shut out the sound, nor music by Mark Knopler.  I told that story to my wife over the phone and she just laughed vigorously.  I hiked a little bit further today the distance between the Stover Creek shelter and Devils Kichen (a campsite not far from Gooch Mountain shelter). There is a mountain stream nearby which lulled me to sleep. I did meet an interesting fellow today who has done the Triple Crown (AT, CDT, and the PCT). I asked him if he had a trail name and he said “nope“ and I thought that was rather odd given all the hiking that he's done. Turns out his trail name is actually ""Nope"".  He was out section hiking and is intent on making it to Damascus, Virginia for “Trail Days"".","Stover Creek Shelter

I slept well last night although it was a bit chilly probably down to the lower 30s, my water was frozen in the morning. I hit the trail about 9 o’clock in the morning a little later than I’d hoped to, but breaking camp with freezing temperatures slows the process down a tad. There was nothing particularly difficult about today’s mileage with the exception that all day long one is climbing up one mountain, down that mountain and then up the next times three or four. I decided to set up camp early today and stopped at about 3:30 or so in the afternoon when I discovered a stealth camping site on the side of a mountain that had both a view and cell service. I was able to make some dinner and drink some hot chocolate. I had the chance to talk to my three sons as well as my wife to wish her a happy Valentine’s Day.  Not too much else to report.  I do have my hammock angled so that I will see the sun rise in the morning.  Looks like my wife (Kathy) will be taking over the editing of my journal and posting it to the Internet.","

yet2b,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607074,"Day five February 15, 2019. Friday. The stealth campsite that I chose last night served me well. I had hoped for a most spectacular sunrise as I was sitting on top of a mountain but alas that was not in the cards. When I woke in the morning the mountain was covered in heavy fog/mist. I managed to get a reasonably early start and was on the trail by 8 o’clock. The entire day was walking in the mist which was eerie at times. I did meet up with a fellow thru hiker, “Redline” who recently retired from the fire department somewhere in Virginia. Our hiking styles were relatively compatible and we walked together most of the afternoon. I managed to arrive at Neils Gap a few minutes before ""Redline"" and was able to spend some time at the iconic mountain crossings. The store was loaded with camping gear and some food supplies. The girl behind the counter was very polite and helpful. Interestingly they were without power which made it a little bit difficult to see what products they had. As I was leaving the power came back on...naturally.  I had asked the girl at the  desk if they sold beer and she just laughed.  Another patron in the store must have heard my request and offered me a beer.  She went out to the car and brought back a Coors Light.  She and her friend were nurses and dream of hiking the AT one day.  Thanks guys...my first trail magic. Redline and I decided to share a cabin (Blood Mountain Cabins). It is a surprisingly comfortable place and certainly beats the rainy weather outside.  I picked up a frozen pizza and some Cokes, but oh my how good that beer tasted with the pizza.  I have my wet gear strung out on the top floor of the cabin.  I took a long hot shower and am relaxing in my silk liner covered over with my top quilt.  It is wonderful to be warm, full, and relaxed.  As a part of the cost of the cabin (a reasonable $72.00 split two ways) they will wash your clothes.  What a deal!  They serve breakfast as well!!  A cool place for any thru hiker.","Stealth Campsite

""Redline"" and I slept in until about 7 o’clock in the morning. We sorted through our gear and prepared our laundry to take up to the main building/office. We had a simple breakfast (five dollars) and waited for our laundry to be finished. What with waiting on the laundry and resupplying at the mountain crossings store I did not really hit the trail until about noon. The day started with sunshine but with my first ascent up a small mountain I was greeted once again to the mist. ""Redline"" got an earlier start than I did and I never did catch up to him. Along the way I encountered a group of Scouts, troop 129. There were six young man along with four adults. I hiked along with the troop leaders for a while and we bantered some as we walked.  I broke away from them to take the time to enjoy a mountain view.  Finally I was on top of a mountain and there was no fog.  While there I ran into a group of young ladies (from Michigan) who were intent on doing some head stands on the side of the mountain. I offered to take a picture of their athletic efforts.  They told me of yet another beautiful vista just up the trail.  While there I got to talking with some locals ( a man and his wife (he was originally from New York and she from Ohio).  He turned me on to a most excellent stealth campsite, some 300 yards off the trail. The view was just amazing!  There were a few folks already there and we chatted for awhile.  Juan was originally from Mexico City and Luz mentioned she was from Peru.  They hung out until sunset and I am now nestled in the cocoon of my hammock enjoying the twinkling of the distant city lights.  I have camped a fair amount through the years but I have to say this view is one of the best I have ever encountered.  Today has been my most favorite day of my little walk-in-the-woods.  Oh yeah, I had my first fall today, slipping on some wet rocks.  No real damage done, other than a bruised ego.

yet2b,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607141,"02/17/19. Sunday. Day seven. Cowrock Mountain to the Low Gap shelter 6.4 mile ( still in GA). While I am very aware of this factor, given that I am a psychologist, weather has an immense impact on one’s attitude and mood. The weather yesterday was simply amazing and the views from the top the mountain were simply fantastic. In the morning however I woke up to an extremely foggy environment which resulted in rather wet gear (backpack, wind sock, hammock, and even to a certain extent my down quilts. Most of the day was spent walking the top mountain ridges in cold wind-driven drizzle. It wasn’t the most fun that I’ve ever had in my life, but I managed to hang in there and arrived at the Low Gap shelter relatively early in the day, about 1 o’clock. My mood was not nearly as bright as it was the day before. There were already several people at the shelter who were attempting to escape the rain and wind. Everyone had already climbed into their sleeping bags and were attempting to stay warm. As afternoon passed other hikers arrived and by the time that the sun set there were six of us lined up at our sleeping bags in a relatively small shelter. Not long after the sun set the rain seemed to increase in intensity and when a father and son duo arrived we made room for them. So in the end there were eight people crammed into a small shelter. We were essentially shoulder to shoulder lined up across the shelter. (mango, two tents, lunatic, three-mile, Tim, myself(yet to be), and the father and son from Atlanta. A trail angel of sorts left an unopened bottle of Royal Crown whiskey in the shelter.  Tim, a relatively young fellow in his early 20s drank about half the bottle. I did take a shot of it myself, though I’m not fond of whiskey. Tim brought along a small guitar and serenaded the eight of us for a period of time. I did have an achievement of sorts as for the first time I utilized a “pee bottle” in the middle of the night with no undue consequences. I was actually proud of myself as I did not have to leave the shelter to do so. Unfortunately about the time that I settled back into my sleeping bags my body gave me a rather direct signal that I needed to now to go to the privy. It is extremely unusual for me to need to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night but my body did not seem to be giving me the option to wait. Normally a trip to the privy is not a big deal, however trying to quietly leave a shelter packed with people without tripping or stepping on folks was a bit of a challenge. This happened at about 3:30 in the morning by the way. Once again I was pleased with myself that I did not seemingly disturb anyone with my exit. However, I never really did take notice where the privy was located when I had first arrived at the shelter.  So you can only imagine me standing outside the shelter in the rain trying to figure out where the heck the privy was located. I walked around the shelter a time or two when my headlamp happened to light up what appeared to be a path. I then saw the sign for the privy and went about my business. I then had to climb back into the shelter without tripping or falling into people.  Sleeping in a shelter with 8 people is not my idea of a good time though I guess it beats the alternative (setting up my hammock in the rain).","Cowrock Mountain

Too Tents as well as the father and son duo wound up at the Blue Mountain shelter as well.  Two Tents and I will be taking a day off the trail in Helen, Georgia tomorrow, in part because I need a day and in part because the weather forecast looks rather dismal (cold, rainy, with possible ice).  The father and son duo will be leaving the trail tomorrow and offered to give us a ride into town.

It was good that I did as the father and son duo (& Two Tents) were stirring from a short winters nap.  They were packed and ready to go as I was just finishing up (they had slept in the shelter (with Applesauce and Porkchop (who were said to be noisy sleepers).

Returned to the hotel and I fell asleep for several hours.  Later in the day we had a couple of sandwiches from Betty’s Country Store.  An excellent place to resupply.  Unfortunately on the way to Betty’s my Antigravity Ultra lightweight rain jacket began to fail (ie. wet out).  It was only a five minute walk in light rain and I was soaked.  I have a call into Antigravity and we will find out how responsive their customer service is.  Walking in the rain in temperatures in the lower 30’s is a potential disaster waiting to happen; well within the range where hypothermia could occur.","Blue Mountain Shelter

My first zero day, no miles hiked.  Two Tents and I spent the day relaxing, resupplying, and eating. I had a strong hankering for German food (Helen has a very strong Barvian theme to the town). We walked around to three different German restaurants but alas, they were all closed. Dang it. We are going to try our hands (well actually our thumbs) at hitchhiking tomorrow to get back to Unicoi Gap. We will then hike to the top of Tray mountain to the Tray mountain shelter (just under 6 miles), and the next day we will hopefully make it some 11 miles to the Top of the Mountain Hostel & Hiking Center.
On a positive note I did have the chance to talk with the folks at Antigravity Gear.  I initially spoke with a polite young man named Caleb (also my middle son’s name) and then eventually with one of his colleagues, Colleen. They were extremely apologetic and helpful as it relates to the problem I experienced with their rain jacket. They are going to stand behind their product and will have a new one mailed to me 16 miles down the line (Top of the Mountain Hostel and Hiking center).
Two Tents and I had an interesting discussion last night.  Somewhere along the way I mentioned having graduated from Lycoming College, as did my: father, mother, sister, brother-in-law, niece, as well as my wife.

Today was a first of sorts in that many many years have passed since I last hitchhiked. We were lucky beyond all belief. I doubt that we had our thumbs outstretched for more than about 90 seconds when a fellow in a large crew cab stopped and picked us up. He mistakenly took us to the wrong gap, however he was kind enough to travel significantly out of his way to bring us to Unicoi Gap. Dillon, the owner of the truck has a crew and works on the cell towers across the region. He and his crew run the lines and install satellite dishes at the top of the towers. He showed us some of the paraphernalia that he must wear to work at such heights. The harness system alone wheighs some 50 pounds.  
I believe this was my longest day yet, in terms of miles traveled. Two Tents and I originally had planned to hike to Tray Mountain shelter. However we arrived there at about 1 o’clock in the afternoon and decided to push on. We ended up hiking to a designated campsite much further along than we had planned. We arrived at the campsite about 5:30 and went about the business of setting up our respective shelters. I was low on water and walked about a mile one-way to fill up my water bottles. I was quite low on energy at this point.  I ate some summer sausage with a tortilla, drank some water and crawled into my hammock. Not long after doing so, it began raining.

Day 12 now ranks as my least favorite day of my hike. On the ""Suck-o-meter"", I am rating this day as a 4 (on a scale of 0-10). I'd like to rate it much much higher but I suspect the possible range of “suck” is probably much broader than I can imagine at this particular juncture. While I did sleep well last night (despite listening to the incessant rain....all night) I remained warm and dry in the cocoon of my hammock. Everything else however was quite soaked (tarp, back pack, hat etc.). So I packed up in the rain and my pack felt significantly heavier due to everything being soaked. Given that my rain jacket failed I had purchased a poncho that I used today. Well that added to the suck factor as my forearms were exposed to the rain all day. And, rain it did. The trail at times seemed more like a stream than a footpath. At many many points through the day there were + 2 inches of rain on the trail (giant puddles if you will). Where there were no puddles there was mud and if no mud there were soggy leaves that were slippery than (fill in the blank). Dick’s Creek is close to Top of the Ga Hostel which is where Two Tents and I are staying tonight. My new rain jacket was waiting for me, looks to be made of a different material. No cabins were available (actually none available until March), so I am in the bunk house. Not great but better than setting up my wet hammock. Ate a pizza, got my laundry done and took a shower.

Top of Ga/Dicks Creek to Muskrat Creek shelter ... 11.8 miles--A personal best for me.  My hiking partner, Two Tents took me aside this morning and informed me that he was through, his body was giving him various messages to stop...bummer.  So I took the 8:00 shuttle to Dicks Creek - chatted a little with “Urgent Cathole”, but in no time he pulled away from me.  Most of the morning was spent walking in a light drizzle with a relatively strong wind, making for rather cold hands. Later in the day I crossed over into North Carolina (one down, only 13 to go).  Later the drizzle stopped but the sun never burned through the fog.  Later in the day i caught up to “Wait a Minute” a nurse from the Raleigh/Durham area.  We both wound up in the shelter together, as there was talk of a storm coming through tonight.  FYI, the Ga mountains ought not to be taken lightly.  I was totally out of gas by the time we reached the shelter.  I’d rather be in my hammock than in the shelter but the thought of packing up wet gear tipped the scale toward the shelter.  Sleeping on my sleeping pad (ie. thin-designed for a hammock) is no fun.  I will be remedying that when I get into Franklin, NC.  - 3 days out.

Stayed in the shelter last night and I am glad that I did as there was a wicked storm with buckets of rain and high winds. Scooter and Broccolis Rob braved the elements by sleeping in their tents and according to their report, stayed dry. I was on the trail by 9 o’clock. Wait A Minute had left the campsite before me though I eventually caught up with her, and later passed her. It was nice to see the sun and the blue sky, though it never really warmed up due to the wind. I climbed the tallest mountain yet on this journey, Standing Indian at 5, 470 feet and interestingly I felt quite strong on this climb and credited the improvement to the fact that I walked slowly and ate breakfast, had snacks, and hydrated. Along the way I ran into a number of different thru hikers: Mad Dash and T (the brothers) B (Brandon), as well as Scooter an Broccoli Rob. Tonight is going to be a cold one, probably in the low twenties with steady winds.  I’m in my Hammock tonight with 10 degree top quilt and bottom quilts, sleeping pad, reflectix, down socks/pants/jacket/hoodie, merino wool balaclava, insulated vest, smart wool socks, and possum wool gloves.  Sure hope I stay warm.  Wait A Minute, Scooter, and Broccoli Rob are also in the same campsite.

I almost didn’t recognize that glowing globe in the blue sky. It is considerably more enjoyable to see the various mountain vistas as opposed to walking for hours at a time in fog and clouds not to mention drizzle/rain. I’m probably jinxing myself but I’ve had no blisters and no outstanding aches and pains. My stamina seems to be slowly increasing. While I am not exactly running up the mountains, I seem to be able to climb without my heart exploding. I am stealth camping this evening by myself. The designated campsite where I was going to stay was quite small and occupied by Scooter and Broccoli Rob. Wait A Minute was a half hour or so behind me and she likely stayed in the designated campsite. I quickly set up my hammock and tarp, ate some Mountainhouse beef stroganoff and drank a cup of coffee. I had the chance to talk with my wife and two of my sons and all in all it was a good day and good evening. I will be headed for Winding Stair Gap first thing tomorrow morning and have about 11.8 miles to travel. I will then be taking a zero in Franklin, North Carolina. There is a reputable outfitter in Franklin and I hope to pick up a lightweight sleeping pad for those nights that I must sleep in a shelter.

Total miles for the day 11.8.  The sun was once again shining brightly, and for the first time in my journey I actually felt the warmth of its rays. Was on the trail just a tad before 9 o’clock. Had the most excellent sleep last night and while it was cold it wasn’t quite as chilly as the night before. I do like my P-Jar (don’t ask). The climb up the NOBO side of Mount Albert was, for an old fart like me, relatively challenging. At the same time it was pretty cool. It was too steep at times to use trekking poles, so they had to be stowed in the backpack. At points it required hand over hand climbing and took maximum effort. Not for the faint of heart.  I am not sure that a fall would end your life, but it it wouldn’t be pretty if it occurred. At the top of the toughest climb, someone constructed a small stone seat. I was happy to see it and sat for a time enjoying the view. The view from a top of Mt Albert was amazing, and the view from the fire tower is almost indescribable.  This was a most excellent day.  I have to admit that was tiring but it felt good to push myself.  I decided to give hitchhiking another go.  The second vehicle that passed me stopped and it was the owner of Baltimore Jack’s Hostel, a fellow that I chatted with on the Internet a few weeks back.  How odd.  After a cheesesteak sub, fries, a raspberry tart, and a couple of dark beers I returned to my room at the hostel and immediately fell asleep.

I always thought that a zero day would equate to that of rest and relaxation. What with doing laundry, food supply, gear replacement, and eating - a day goes by rather quickly. Walking back to the bakery where I ate breakfast to get a chocolate eclair took up some time as well. The server there was originally from Greenville South Carolina and had kids about the same age as mine and attended the same high school as they did. She knew the names of some of my middle son, Caleb's friends. Once again another case of “six degrees of separation. The local outfitter here in Franklin (Outdoor 76) has a relatively impressive stock of backpacking/camping gear. I was able to find a Klymit sleeping pad which will allow me to actually sleep when forced into a shelter.  (Thanks for the recommendation made by a fellow thru-hiker (Lance aka “lunatic). My current pad from Gossamer Gear was just too thin to comfort my old bones.  The outfitter did not have the 3/4 pad that I wanted but they knocked 40% off the price of the full length version.  Thanks guys.  I was chatting with the owner of Baltimore Jack, Ron Haven, (as well fellow thru-hiker, Solace) and they shared a variety of stories about Baltimore Jack. He was an icon of sorts on the AT (though he passed in 2016).  Wish I had had the chance to meet him.  Will be headed back to the trail @ 8:00 in the morning.","Franklin NC

My intent today was to make it to the Wesser Bald Shelter but mother nature had other plans. It rained all last night, sometimes rather heavy. In the morning it started again and then slacked off.  I started walking at around 9 o’clock in the morning and by 10 o’clock I was once again in the midst of the fog and mist. The rain then started again, not much more than a steady drizzle and most of the day was spent walking through the clouds. Unfortunately my rain jacket let me down once again.  I ended up being soaked to bone and was forced to stop at a shelter way too early, about 11:30am.  (Luckily there was one).  Given the rain and failed jacket I spent the rest of the day cocooned in the shelter. It was in the upper 30’s to lower 40’s and it took an hour or so for me to warm up. I did meet some interesting folks though: “T-Rex”, (a French Canadian), a very affable fellow, “Sower” an ex con who found God while prison and was anxious to spread the word, and Kenny a young man from Greer, SC.  He was very familiar with the Taylors area where my office is located.  Small world.  Will be calling Antigravity tomorrow about the failed rain jacket.","Wayah Shelter

No rain, blue sky, and sunshine--what a wonderful combination. I am hoping for many more days like this. It was the first day since I began my journey that I actually was warm while hiking.  I was originally going to walk 11.5 miles today to get to the Nantahalla Outdoor Center (NOC) but about halfway there I changed my mind and decided to look for a stealth camping site as the weather was so beautiful. Unfortunately I was not successful in finding a stealth campsite and I had to walk the distance to the Rufus Morgan Shelter. I met a couple today from the Atlanta area who were day hiking (Kimberly and Mark). This was the first time they were able to get out to do something together in 10 years.  Their son was with the scouts camping.  We chatted a bit  and it reminded me of the days of how intense parenting can be. I also ran into some thru hikers: Numb Numb, Lucky, and Katmundu.  I also had a first today, as I had the chance to actually pass someone on the trail. It appears that I am one of the slower hikers.  I also saw my first bloom (flower) today as well as a butterfly.  Spring is around the corner.  Tried to call Antigravity Gear today, only to discover that they are closed on Saturdays.

Turns out I did well with the climb. I felt great, other than the cold.  The Sassafras shelter seemed rather uninviting given its location (down a ravine).  If the sun were to come out I doubt it would shine there.  I hiked once again in the clouds and fog all day, never did see the sun.  About two miles into the hike the trees and shrubbery was covered with rime frost.  Quite beautiful. It was cold though.  My hands never warmed up until about 4:00. I was wearing fleece mittens and my pogies (water proof cover over mittens).  I got into camp and set up my hammock as quickly as I could.  Ate some dinner, the only meal I had. The restaurant at the NOC didn’t open until 11:00 and it was too cold through the day to stop and eat. I crawled into my cocoon, called my wife and summarily fell asleep. By the way, this was the first day of my journey that I did not run into another soul the entire day.  About 9:00pm or so I was awakened by the sound of a wolf or cyottee.  It was quite close and scared the heck out of me.  Since I was awake I decided to write this journal entry.  Oh yea, I forgot to mention yesterday when registering for the motel room that the clerk, a young lady asked for my zip code.

Let’s just say that last night was cold, very cold, with a temperature of 14° plus or minus this morning when I awoke. I made it through the night and was more less comfortable. Breaking camp however at that temperature was challenging. I would complete one task (retrieving my food bag) and then spend several minutes just trying to rewarm my hands. Brrrrrrrr. My water was frozen as well as my P-Jar. When I attempted to use my tracking poles, they were frozen into the ground. When I yanked them hard they did come out of the ground, with clumps of mud/dirt attached to the tips. It took a couple of miles of walking for my feet to warm up. My hands were quite cold even though I was wearing possum down gloves. When my hands finally did warm up my fingers actually hurt. I happened to look at the weather report just before breaking camp, to learn that there was a winter advisory for this region of NC. Temperatures Tues night/Wed morning were predicted to once again fall into the lower teens.  In addition, there was a wind advisory in the forecast as well, with predicted wind chills dropping down to -10 degrees (or lower depending on the elevation).  Given that discretion is the better part of valor, I decided to come off the trail and am in Robbinsville NC (thanks to a fellow thru hiker and his wife who offered to take me into town).  Funny thing about being in Robbinsville, many years ago (early 1980’s) I was the director of the local mental health center.  Nothing much looked the same.

I made it to the shelter at about 1:30 in the afternoon, hung my hammock in the sun, climbed in and promptly fell asleep.

I have to admit feeling good about having made it through the Smokies.  There were more than a few challenges with respect to this section of the trail (I.e. cold temperatures, rather soggy weather, shelter life, as well as more than a few mountains to ascend and descend.  To anyone (of my age) who is considering a thru hike and wonders what the Smokies are like; find the nearest mountain near you (@ least 3,000 to 5,000ft) and practice climbing to the top and then descending and repeating that for 5-7 hours a day for 5-8 days.  This is what you will be facing.  I didn’t break any land speed records but was able to accomplish it with a slow and steady pace (for the inclines).  I am at the Standing Bear Farm (hostel) to night.  It is a funky place with some colorful characters. I am in a small creekside cabin, with French doors and am watching a nearly full moon.  I think hiker hunger may have set in.  For lunch I had a couple of cheeseburgers, a tin of Pringle’s and a couple beers.  For dinner two very large bbq pork sandwiches, chips, and a couple more beers (for $12- what a deal).  It is now 10:20pm and I am hungry.    Broccoli Rob (a fellow who I have hiked some with, before the Smokies) is staying here.  I am on the fence about whether to make tomorrow a zero or a nero.","Davenport Shelter

I have an idea for a reality TV show (though I actually dislike such mind numbing offerings). However, a show based on an AT hostel like Standing Bear would involve a cast of colorful characters and could focus on the trials and tribulations of thru hikers. Remember you saw this idea here first. Staying at Standing Bear was a trip. The climb out of Standing Bear was, well a bear. Starting out at 1500 feet and climbing to 4250 feet in 5 miles. I do believe my stamina is slowly improving across time as the climb seemed ‘slightly’ easier.  I left the hostel at about 10:30, ran into Broccoli Rob eating  a snack.  I ran into him again (he is a much stronger (and younger) hiker at a stealth campsite at about 3:00.  It was and is a cold day.

TN.   Stealth campsite near mile 241.5 to Roaring Fork Shelter @ mile 257.  Total miles for the day 10.2.   Oh my did the temperatures drop last night.   It was 24 degrees when I woke up. Breaking camp in such temperatures is a chore, as finger dexterity is diminished.  I eventually ambled out of my quilts at about 8:00am, though there was no apparent increase in temperatures.  Broccoli Rob bolted out of camp before me and we had loose plans of meeting further down the line.  It was too cold (for me) to fire up my stove (mistake # 1), so I scarfed down some trail mix and ate an energy bar.   While quite cold, there was blue sky and sunshine.  The temperatures never climbed out of the 40’s.  I wore my possum down gloves most of the day. Most of the morning was spent climbing various hills and mountains.    Here’s the thing, all the gains I seem to have been making with respect to stamina were ‘missing in action’. I seemed to struggle with nearly every ascent.  I just wasn’t feeling it today.  As I was pondering this phenomenon, it dawned me that I did not eat much for dinner last night as it was too cold and there was not much daylight left when I awoke from my 4 hour nap.     My calorie intake for those two meals was well under what I should have eaten (thru hikers burn some 5,000 to 6,000 calories a day).  I tried to make up for the deficit with multiple snacks and a lunch through the day.  It wasn’t until about 2:00pm that I began to have more energy.  It also helped that most of the afternoon was spent walking downhill.  Max Patch (a Bald with a 360 degree view of the mountains) was quite awesome.  I was running low on water later in the day and decided to fill my containers before reaching my destination.  The water was taken from a small fast moving creek about 2 - 2/12 feet wide and some 3 inches deep. I filled my first container without a hitch and likewise was successful with my second one.  Then I noticed that the containers were not quite full, so I decided to fill my ‘dirty water container’ one more time (mistake # 2).  This time however my feet slipped on the wet moss covered rocks and I found myself in a bit of a precarious situation. My right hand was on one side of the creek with my left one on the other side.  My feet/legs were in the same position.  My nose/face was a scant 5 inches from the creek.  One more slip of my feet and I would be taking a dip in some very cold water (there were some ice cycles dangling from some of the nearby rocks).  I used to be fairly athletic (former high school wrestler with a little gymnastics background).  In the past I would have easily remedied this predicament.  Lady Luck was with me as I struggled to rectify the situation and managed to spin around with only my feet getting wet.  I was less than a quarter mile from the campsite.  I set up my hammock, fired up my stove and made a Ramen bomb (Ramen noodles with chunks of summer sausage added).  I also made some coffee.  While chatting with some of the folks at the shelter I had another six degrees of separation moment.  One of the fellows brought along his guitar (and his son brought a mandolin).  One thing led to another and turns out he was a musician from Charleston SC (Jefferson Coker Band) and knew of my sons (Zach who was the guitarist for Danielle Howell for more than a few years - and Caleb who was the guitarist for the now defunct band, Old You). Such a small world.  Broccoli Rob is camped nearby as are some other folks.  There are also a handful of folks in the shelter.  Me thinks the “bubble” is beginning to catch up to me.  I am tucked away comfortably in my quilts.  My feet have finally warmed up from the creek immersion.  I need to finish this entry so I can get my hands warm as they are quite chilled.  At 8:40pm it is well past hiker midnight.  All things considered it was a good day.","stealth campsite near mile 241.5

A decent meal last night (relatively speaking) followed by a hot breakfast (I had to force myself to fire up my stove as the temperatures dipped into the lower 30’s - my water was iced over). I started hiking late (9:30am) and decided to push myself today hiking until about 6:30pm.  I was hoping I could reach the Deer Park Shelter as it would mean a short sprint into Hot Springs tomorrow - only 3.2 miles. I plan to do a Nero, stay the night and hike out the next day (also Nero).  My stamina returned today and this was probably the strongest I’ve felt, especially climbing, one peak @ 4,300 and one at 4,700.  I am growing a little more confident that the bigger miles will come, given: better weather, earlier starts and longer days. I have also figured out that my normal hiking speed is fairly slow, so I pushed myself today to walk at a faster pace.  By days end, my legs felt a tad heavy and my feet felt a bit beaten up, given all the roots and rocks.  My stamina was great though...probably my strongest hiking day yet. The blue sky, sunshine and cool temperatures helped.  I did not see another hiker on the trail today (neither NOBO or SOBO).  There was one fellow at the shelter.  He owns an outfitter store in Asheville (called Take a Hike).  He was curious about my hammock. He thru hiked the AT in 1991 and mentioned something about the PCT, though I am unclear as to wether he thru hiked it or not.  I saw some mountain wild flowers that had bloomed, Spring is around the corner. A few weeks back someone asked to include some pictures of my hammock set up:  Warbonnet Blackbird, Enlightened Equipment 10 degree top and bottom quilts, Warbonnet wind sock, and Hammock Gear cuben fiber tarp (with doors), stored in a mesh snake.","Roaring Fork Shelter

Later on in the day there were climbs to 2,600 and then 3,600 feet.  There was abundant blue sky and sunshine, but because of the high winds I can’t say I was ever warm.  This was an excellent day of hiking for me what with the beautiful weather, scenery, and increased stamina/energy.  I did get a little frustrated at days end, setting up my hammock and rain fly.  The high winds made the process rather challenging. Hopefully I won’t get blown off the mountain tonight.  I ran into Turtle Thump late in the day and Toe ended up camping in the same general area as me.  I am tucked away in my quilts as the temperature is predicted to drop to 18 degrees with wind chill at 11 degrees.  This will be the coldest night yet.  I plan to sleep in until the sun warms up my hammock, so no early start tomorrow.","Laughing Heart Hostel

I was starting to kick myself for not camping near the shelter I passed a mile or so back.  I then turned the corner, the wind died down and I found a perfect stealth campsite just off the trail and it was sunny.  I quickly set up camp, made dinner, chatted with Kathy and am tucked safely in my warm quilts, though my hands are quite cold as I make this journal entry.  Looks like I will have some snow pictures come tomorrow.","just beyond Spring Mountain shelter

I was lucky that it was downhill but descents are sometimes as challenging as ascents, which was the case this time around.  The descent was fairly steep and was both rock and root infested.  I arrived at my destination at about 6:00 and was beat.  I still had a half mile walk down a country road.  At about the halfway mark a local in a pickup truck offered me a ride which I gratefully accepted. I am at the Black Bear Resort and it has been perfect for me.  I was able to secure the last private little cabin.  I have been able to shower, do my laundry, and purchase food and drink.  They also have a small but decent resupply store.  I was able to chat with my wife and Jeff on the resort's landline (no cellphone signal or internet). I would recommend this place to any hiker.  That’s about it for now.  My friend Jeff will be picking me up tomorrow and we will hike together for 2-3 days.  All is good.","unofficial campsite near mile 404.8

I enjoyed hiking with Jeff and our hiking styles were similar. We had the choice of camping at a designed campsite or hike a tad further and camp at the Boots Off Hostel.  It is an okay place but not exactly the best environment for hammocks.  The staff was friendly and brought us a couple of beers.  It was taco night as well with free tacos and live music (Jefferson of the Jefferson Coker band.  Not exactly a wilderness experience, but it does represent one aspect of trail life.  Jeff will be hiking with me for the next couple of days and then I will have +|- two days and I will be in Damascus, Virginia.  This trip remains a most excellent adventure.  I was convinced that it was going to be a clear night so I did not deploy my rain tarp.  Naturally 10 minutes after I climbed into my hammock it began to drizzle.  I deployed the tarp in less than five minutes.  Of course it then stopped drizzling.  Hey Ray H.  Glad you got the bug to do some backpacking.  I really like Jones Gap.  Your note made me smile.","Dennis Come Road @ mile 420.0

At one point in the conversation he mentioned being from St Simon Island. My middle son (Caleb) has played in a couple of bands with a friend who is from there as well and I casually asked him if he knew John Pope.  Rhythm seemed flabbergasted that I came up with the name of a person he knew.  Rhythm as you might guess is a musician as well. (Six degrees of separation...yet again).    The days hiking started fairly easy with some gentle to moderate ascents and descents.  The waterfall at Comer’s Creek was beautiful and I filled my two water jugs with cold mountain water.  The afternoon was more challenging what with some lengthy climbs and some long sections of my favorite, Rocks and Roots. Along the way I ran into a rather large black snake. I poked at him a couple of times so I could secure a menacing photograph of him.  All of a sudden I heard the sound typically made by a rattlesnake.    I knew that it was not one but it made me freeze.  Upon further investigation (continued poking) I discovered that the snake was vibrating his tail in the leaves in such a way that it sounded like a rattlesnake.  Perhaps a more experienced outdoorsman might laugh at my story, noting that such actions by a black snake are quite common.  What I want to know is how on earth did a blacksnake figure that out (i.e. that vibrating his tail could mimic a rattler).  ....So I’m thinking he must have some rattlesnake friends...maybe it went something like this.  -> Blacksnake to his rattlesnake friend. “Dude I have a question for you.  Why is it that the humans never seem to mess with you? Rattlesnake: “Man, that’s easy; when I see one I shake the rattle on the end of my tail and they stop dead in their tracks...it’s a hysterically funny thing to watch.  You should try it.”  Blacksnake: “Dang, why didn’t I think of that...hey...I don’t have a rattle on my tail.""  Rattlesnake: “were you in some kind of accident?”  Blacksnake: “No I guess I never had one.""  Rattlesnake: “Well just try vibrating the tip of your tail in the leaves, maybe it will sound like my rattle.""  The other night my wife asked me what I think about while hiking the trail.  As you can be seen in the above vignette...an idle mind can take you to some strange places.

My first and second steps (on large rocks) were near perfect.  I then had to step onto a large tree limb that someone had thrown into the water.  My first step on the tree limb was strong and balanced.  I then moved (gingerly) my other foot to the limb.  All was good until I shifted my weight to that foot causing the limb to submerge (as well as my foot). I quickly stepped to the next available rock (rather than fall), but unfortunately that rock was below the surface of the water.  I managed to soak both of my feet in the stream.  The first that I have done so in + 500 miles. Not long after that I managed to soak both feet in what was an easy crossing.  I then came to a relative wide crossing but the available rock stepping stones were challengingly far apart.  Rather risk falling in, I said the heck with it, rolled up my pants and just walked through the water (the water was just a little higher than ankle  height and quite cold.  Not long after the crossings I was treated to some trail magic (chili and a toasted cheese sandwich).  The rest of the afternoon was spent walking in and out of rain showers.  The trail was quite wet/muddy/slick.  I slipped on a variety of occasions but managed to remain upright.  The trail eventually crossed RT 11 (Lee Hwy).  I stopped to eat a cheeseburger at the Barn restaurant (under new management...not sure of its new name).  I was rather wet and had gone through two sets of socks.  It was still rainy when I spied the Relax Inn.  I simply couldn’t muster up the determination to hike on and then set up camp in the rain.  So here I am safe/warm/dry in a motel that is well past it’s prime (but what can you expect for a whopping $45.00).  I was able to wash and dry my muddy/wet clothes and will (hopefully) have an early start to the day (Easter Sunday).  Here’s hoping for a warm sunny day.","Mnt Rogers National Recreation Headquarters @ mile 534.2

Thing is, I couldn’t get my feet into my shoes. Remember my comments from yesterday about drying out all of my gear.  Well, I placed my shoes next to the heater in the motel room.  While the motel is clearly past it prime, I must say the heating elements work exceedingly well.  In fact the heater ended up fusing the plastic inserts of the eyelets to the shoe laces rendering my relatively new shoes unusable.  My options were limited.  Kathy kindly offered to drive back to Virginia (a + 3 hour drive) but I just couldn’t let her do that given she had just got back home yesterday from our stay in Marion.  Luckily I found s fellow at the motel who shuttled me to the Walmart in Marion.  I was hoping for a better selection of shoes, but eventually ran across a pair of Ozark Trail Men’s Hikers for $24.95 on sale..............for a whopping $9.00.  The shuttle cost more than the shoes.  Any predictions on how long they might last?  After 8.5 miles in them today I believe they are at least one or two steps above your basic household slipper.  Since I was already well off my plan for starting early, I waited until the “Barn” restaurant opened for their Sunday Buffet @ 11:00.  After eating more than I should have I donned my backpack and braved the surprisingly chilly weather.  It took several miles before I warmed up. The sun began to break through later in the day and for a couple of hours it was quite pleasant.  For such a late start, I am satisfied with my mileage.  While the shoes were reasonably functional, I am concerned that I may end up bruising my feet or twisting an ankle, so Kathy will be mailing out a new pair of trail runners a couple of days further up the trail (Bland).  It is nearly 8:30 at this point and the temperature has dropped significantly.  It is 48 degrees with a wind chill of about 42.  It will be dropping into the middle 30’s tonight (camped at the top of a small mountain 3,447 feet).

Stealth campsite at mile 554.2 to an unofficial campsite at mile 563.8.   9.6 miles for the day.  It was a tad chilly when I crawled out of my hammock this morning what with the temperature at about 40 and the wind blowing as I was camped atop a small mountain.  Once the sun burned through the clouds the day was beautiful (blue sky, sunshine, and minimal clouds).  As I climbed down the mountain I was treated to an absolutely gorgeous little valley where Spring had indubitably sprung (simply breathtakingly beautiful).  My intent today was to hike to the Chestnut Knob shelter for a + 15 mile day.  However, come mid day I began receiving rather direct communication from my feet and ankles (and to a certain extent lower legs) to ‘cease and desist’.  The lack of cushioning and support from my bathroom slippers (ie hiker shoes) was taking its toll.  Even on gradual downhill sections I had slowed to a crawl where normally I am relatively ‘speedy’.  At about 4:00 (I had been hiking since 9:00), I crossed over a footbridge and spied a campsite beside a fast moving stream. The setting was too irresistible to pass up.  I met some folks who camped nearby, who started in mid February (Sunshine, her husband-Bluegrass and their friend Pappa Bear-age 62).  Bluegrsss started on his 29th birthday. Nice people.  Despite my sore feet and ankles it was an exceptional day.  I’m hesitant to say it but I think the last of the cold weather is now behind me (sure hope I don’t regret saying that).","Stealth campsite @ mile 554.2

This is old man verbiage please skip if you’re a young whipper snapper.  I regained the trust and friendship with my feet today.  My new pair of hiking shoes was waiting for me at the motel (thank you Kathy).  While at the Dollar Store I picked up some Epson Salts, pumice stone, lotion, and gel insoles for my shoes.  I soaked me feet in warm water (with the epson salts) and went about rubbing out 75 days of calloused feet/toes) and applied lotion to my feet.  I will repeat this tomorrow.  All and all this was a great day both on and off the trail.  Boy I like being able to say that phrase.","unofficial campsite @ mile 584.8

A long hard day for me...but at the same time...a good one...felt good to push myself.  If my feet hadn’t been hurting (and I had been motivated to do so...I think I could have had a 20 mile day.  As I was getting ready to end this entry (@ 8:33pm I just saw a hiker pass by the campsite...in the dark...hiking by the light of his headlamp ——>that is not something that I would be interested in doing.","mile 591.7

In the morning there were some gorgeous views.  I did run into a couple of sketchy fellows on horseback today (which is prohibited on the AT).  They apologized a couple of times for being on “my” trail.  They then implied that they were law enforcement (undercover) hunting for a fellow who was on the “run”.  They indicated that he was a pedophile.  I almost asked them if I could see their identification but decided that would probably not have been a smart thing to do.  Their whole story sounded fishy to me.  Another great day on the AT.,"unofficial campsite @ mile 607.8

I am sure glad that I no longer have the fear (respect yes) that I once had.  I am camped tonight near a shelter with a local Boy Scout troop.  Their hooting and a hollering brought back some fond memories.  Upon arriving at the shelter I went about the business of setting up camp, making dinner, getting water, and hanging my bear bag.  I kid you not, within a minute of crawling into my hammock it began raining (actually pretty hard) and has yet to stop.  Interestingly the Boy Scout troop leader, who I chatted with on the trail just stopped by with some trail magic (several energy bars and a Mountain House Chicken & Dumpling with Vegetables).  Not sure that you would remember, but I just recently had that particular meal for the first time and thought that it was the cat’s meow.  Another tough, but great day on the AT.","Laurel Creek Shelter @ mile 674.8

I have fallen on a couple occasions and some of my clothes are mud encrusted.  With the wet weather the odor of my worn clothes (packed in a stuff sack) will take your breath away.  I accidentally got my nose near my hiking shoes today and almost passed out from the pungent smell.  I am so looking forward to washing my clothes and taking a very long hot shower.  If you are ever out hiking on the AT it is incredibly easy to identify a thru hiker not only by his appearance but also by his fragrance.","Niday Shelter @ mile 687.2

It gave me some ideas for the fire pit that I would like to build at Lake Cooley.  I was able to purchase a pair of Superfeet (insoles) for which my feet are grateful.  Looks like a great deal of rain for tomorrow.  Not sure what I am going to do but I may end up taking my first backcountry Zero to wait out the rainstorm that is forecast for tomorrow/Sunday.***We would not hear about the stabbing death of a fellow hiker in the early morning hours on this date until a couple days later, but the Washington Post had a front page article on the incident on 5/18/19.  His name was Ronnie Sanchez and was only looking for peace after dealing with depression and PTSD from three tours of duty in Iraq and 16 yrs in the army.  He was 43.  A female hiker was also at the campsite, (trail name ""Toque"") and witnessed the attack and was also stabbed trying to run away from the attacker.  After playing dead she found the strength to walk six miles to safety.  Two other campers ran in the opposite direction and will no doubt carry this traumatic incident with them for life.***","mile 729.7 (Fincastle/Daleville)

From the time I started hiking until about 2:00, I was wearing my merino balaclava, had my rain jacket hoodie over my head as well as my hat (along with shirt, shorts, socks).

A half hour later I found a banana that someone had dropped.  I forgot to mention yesterday that a trail angel left several gallon jugs of water by the trail (on a relatively long section where water is scarce).  Other than it being cold it was a great hiking day.  I felt strong on the ascents, did fine on the descents, and my feet were happy with their new insoles.  There were some great views today as well.  At this moment in time, I am comfortable in my cocoon and am aware that my eyelids are quite heavy.  Oh yeah, I forgot to mention (to the fellow who recommended Skittles).  I’m not ready to give up chocolate for Skittles, but I guess they will satisfy my sweet tooth (sorry Crawford Dentistry) for the time being.  A second 'oh yeah', there is a babbling brook 10 feet from my hammock, oh such a soothing sound.","Bobblet's Gap Shelter @ mile 748.2

Towards the latter part of the afternoon I was climbing a steep portion of the trail that was exposed to the sun.  All of a sudden my brain seemed to shut down and I started to topple, not exactly something that you want to happen where I was hiking.  My guardian angel managed to place a tree branch by my side, which I somehow instinctively grabbed.   I immediately drank more water took a break and lucky for me the trail headed back into the cooler woods and began descending.  An hour later I was staring at a little critter while walking and managed to fall to my butt.  I heard an “are you okay from behind me” and it was a young couple from Asheville that I met earlier in the day.  I gave a thumbs up and replied that I simply needed a break so I sat down, though given the look on their faces they didn’t seem to believe me.  The young whippersnapper helped to my feet.  I did pass the 800 mile mark today.  I listened carefully for the sound of fanfare but heard none.  Kathy my dear, I will be more careful in the heat.  Water sources were scarce today so I could not use my FrogTogg bandanna or soak my hat.

During the night there were some coyotes howling, a rather unsettling sound.  I had a bit of a late start today (7:30).  The first 2/3 of the trail (known as the roller coaster aka PUDs, pointless ups and downs) was fairly torturous.   There are a series of steep ascents and descents, with very little in the way of flat ground.  The final third was much flatter.  I got soaked in the afternoon my a thunderstorm.  I saw more hikers on the trail today than usual. Most were day hikers with their clean clothes, styled hair, and perfume and cologne.  Oh what they must think about Thru hikers.  At one point today my body commanded me to sit down and feed it.  Half of me was actually sitting on the trail.  I got all kinds of looks from the day hikers ranging from amusement to mothers who were holding their children close to them.  Ran into a couple with two German Shepherds, one of the dogs was jet black.  Also ran into a couple on one of the overlooks (he was originally from CA and she from NewYork.  My campsite is nearby the Blackburn Trail Center. I hiked down to the center and was treated with a plate of spaghetti and a cream soda, this was after already having eaten one of my freeze dried meals.","unofficial campsite on Buzzard Hill @ mile 1000.5

Had trail magic three times today.  Two day hikers at Woverton Cliffs gave out some teabags to myself and some other hikers.  Later in the day I met a young couple from Kentucky “Up Dog” & “Sandwich Child”. A neat couple who later invited me to join in with some trail magic at Gathland State Park.  The “Real Deal” had stopped at a Panera Bread Company and bought a large salad and a sandwich which we shared.  She had drinks, tangerines, a mixed fruit cup and fresh made brownies.  The experience ranks as one of the best on the trail magic that I have encountered. She seemed to be totally enjoying the role of a trail angel.  It was hard to leave the company of: the Real Deal, Up Dog, Sandwich Child, Red Neck, and Garfield - luckily I only had another 1/2 mile to go. Also, the Encourager and HopSing dropped by and gave out some powdered energy drink additives (can’t think of the formal name).  Interestingly, I forgot to take my meloxicam this morning and my foot didn’t seem to bother me. When I finally climbed into my hammock I noticed that my feet were not as puffy/swollen as they had been.  It was a good day.","Harper's Ferry @ mile 1024.5

I did run into some newbies, one fellow who just started his NOBO trek to Maine having just left Harper’s Ferry.  He mentioned in passing that he had hoped to leave from Katahdin but noted that Baxter State Park would not open until June 15 (too late for him).  I also ran into two lads from Texas who also just left from Harper’s Ferry, shooting for Vermont (in a 30-day timeframe).","Crampton Gap Shelter @ mile 1035.9

There were some rocks and boulders to deal with later in the day.  My feet were acting up again.  I think the soaking of my feet in hot water and epson salts actually worsened the swelling/tenderness, probably should have iced it instead.  Later in the day I was pushing to get to the park before the ranger station closed which I guessed might be 6:00.  Turns out it is closed on Sundays.  They have an honor system kiosk for payment (not cheap).  I found the park to be less hiker friendly than I had hoped.  As a hammocker I didn't want to pay for a site only to find out it had no trees, so I had to hike a mile to the campground, choose a site, and then hoof it back to the kiosk to make a payment and then hike back to the campsite.  That was far too complicated after an already long day.

At one point I lost my footing which caused me to scrape open the nice patch of poison ivy on my arm.  The climbing only lasted 5-10 minutes and then I was on top of a ridge that had somewhat of a view (nothing to write home about).  Fifty feet later the trail intersected with that nice grassy road bed.  I could have done without that climbing exercise.  Oh well, I  guess that’s the nature of the trail.","Mile 1305.9 (Mohican Outdoor Center)

An elderly woman pulls into the parking lot and walked slowly and awkwardly (with use of a cane) to the store. I made the comment that “slow and steady wins the race“ and then referenced my slow but steady hike of the Appalachian Trail. We talked for a while and it turns out she has hiked portions of the trail. I sheepishly asked her if she might be willing to carry me to the motel. She says “why not“.

I was expecting the trail today to be relatively easy, and planned to hike sixteen miles. Jiminy Cricket was I wrong.  There were rocks-a-plenty most of the day with some fairly difficult bouldering for an oldster like me.  It rained some in the early afternoon and again in the late afternoon which made navigating the rocks and boulders rather challenging.  I slipped and fell (luckily nothing dire) but I decided to ‘slide’ off trail and stealth camp rather than risk a more serious tumble.  So here I am 50 feet or so off the ridge of Bellvale Mountain with Greenwood Lake down below. Some sort of shindig is going on at the lake.  There is (I think) a DJ who is playing rather loud thumping music and seems to be singing/yelling along (surely it can’t be a live band...if so they are rather horrible).  Hopefully they will end early.  I forgot to mention that I attempted to use my debit card at the local market last night.  My purchase was declined due to insufficient funds.  Kathy and I did some research later that night and there were some bogus charges.  It seems my card had been ‘skimmed’.

Pretty cool experience. Was lucky to have some trail magic today.  I stopped at a trailhead.  Someone had left a cooler there.  There was ice but no drinks.  I decided to take a break to eat a snack and while doing so the trail angel reappeared and restocked the cooler with drinks.  Mid day I was treated to trail magic provided by Mother Nature (Blueberries and Chicken of the Woods).  With respect to the latter it was the first time I have ever eaten wild mushrooms.  I was a little hesitant but took the risk.  It really does taste like chicken.  Several hours have passed since then and I have not upchucked nor have I had any hallucinations.  Late in the day I heard that Mario (a former thru hiker) was doing trail magic but I was also told he had already started packing up.  Since I was nearly a mile from the trailhead when I received the information, I was sure I had missed it. When I got to the trailhead he and his wife were still loading up the car.  I scored two containers of Gator Aid which I immediately consumed, two filled oatmeal cookies, a couple of energy bars, two bottles of water, one can of Genesee beer, and a new foot print for my hammock.  That put some pep in me step for the final 1.5 miles, .4 of which (the tail end) was a steep climb.  All in all this was a much more enjoyable day in comparison to the past couple of days.  I snagged a room at the Bear Mountain Motel in Fort Montgomery and will arrive there tomorrow morning.

I was on the trail by a little after 7 o’clock this morning but I first filled my water bottles from a little stream that was barely flowing. There were several frogs leaping around in the middle of the stream (the water tasted kind of froggy), oh well. The hike today was not a walk in the park. It was quite hot and humid. The trail also passed through a couple of large open farm fields. Oh my it was so hot. I also crossed a set of train tracks today where you can pick up the train to New York City. As it happens, a train passed by while I was standing there. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen a train travel that fast. Interestingly I passed over into the state of Connecticut today. One of my journal readers, B Mac has offered to drive up from New York  help me with my resupply and bring along some money that I had wired to him.

The climbs today were fairly steep and so were some of the descents - especially Caleb's Peak (also the name of my middle son--just the Caleb part).  It was in fact wickedly steep.  My hiking partner (Death March Dan) slipped on some leafy matter and fell.  He was quite lucky to only have a few scratches and bruises as well as a stoved finger. We made it to the shelter camping area by about 5 o’clock. It was a long day to be sure, but I felt strong. I ran into an interesting fellow at the shelter, who happed to be reading a book titled Alchemy, which focused in on various Jungian concepts such as archetypes. I guessed that he might be a psychologist (many of which are odd people ?) but he was not.  I then guessed a history buff and then professor.  Turns out he was an attorney.  We had a series of discussions on various topics (e.g.  freedom of speech, grand children, family dynamics as well as AT type matters such as gear choices).  ""Wish we had more time to talk, Jonathan.""  Looking forward to a Nero tomorrow in Cornwall Bridge Connecticut.

The walk from the shelter was first quite flat following the Housatonic River, but eventually went up the side of a mountain.  It was not crazy difficult but it was much steeper than expected.  We did make good time.  We had planned to hitchhike into town but the road was too narrow so we walked a mile or so into Cornwall.  We ate breakfast at the local deli and then checked into The Amselhaus, a small 200 year old apartment that is available to hikers at a reasonable cost.  The owner, Robin is a sweet woman who went out of her way to make us feel welcome.  The Loesche’s (Patty and Richard) arrived at about noon and we chatted for a bit and then walked across the street to the deli for lunch.  Later in the day they drove us 30 minutes up the road to: a brewery, grocery store (for resupply) and an Italian restaurant. Their assistance was greatly appreciated. Dan and I were peppered with questions about the AT which we were happy to answer.   It is just about midnight and I have almost completed my ‘chores’ and it is OMG well past hiker’s midnight."," Mile 1476.1 (Stewart Hollow Brook Shelter)

Even so, what with all the morning chores and eating breakfast I (along with Dan) did not hit the trail until 6:30 am.  This was the most challenging day I have experienced in awhile. There were four mountains that we ascended and descended in just the first half of the day (Bear Mnt-and it was a ‘Bear’, Mnt Race-and I assure you there was no racing, Mnt Everest-well actually Mnt Everett-but it felt like Everest, and Mnt Bushnell-and I can assure you I was bushed by that point in time.  I was impressed with the entrance into Massachusetts.  For almost a mile the trail paralleled Sawmill Brook through the Sages Ravine, it was simply majestic.  Massachusetts has some swamp land that we crossed and the mosquitoes were ravenous. I have never been so voraciously attacked.  We crossed a couple of open fields.  Water was a problem today as there just were not many water sources and we were drinking more than usual.  Many thanks to the trail angel who set out an iced Igloo water cooler and several gallons of water.  Once again I was down to my last gulp when this occurred.  With the heat and humidity we picked a poor day to push ourselves.  We hiked until 5:00 or so and then hitchhiked into town.  At that hour of the day my weather app indicated that it was 91 degrees with a heat index of 99.  The bank in town indicated that the temperature was 96.  It was dang hot.  A young fellow from Guatemala kindly brought us to town.  We are camping free behind the Berkshire South Regional Community Center.  For $7.00 and $1.00 for a towel we were able to take a shower.  We ate dinner across the road at a Mediterranean restaurant.","Mile 1506 (Brassie Brook Shelter)

My feet stayed dry through most of the rain but it is nigh impossible to keep your feet dry when the trail is one giant mud puddle.  When I finally got to camp and took my shoes off, my feet were quite waterlogged and quite white from all the moisture.  The only saving grace for the day was the cooler weather (temps in the middle 60’s). The trail had little to offer today in terms of stimulation so Dan and I touched on a wide variety of topics:  karma,  child rearing, the concept that ‘nobody does nothing...for nothing...’, and technology.  Dan is a stronger hiker than I am but he seems to tolerate my slower pace as we have the same goal, reaching Katahdin by September.  The weather is slated to improve across the next few days, including a welcomed cooling trend.  The temperatures are predicted to drop into the fifties tonight.  I have already donned my down:  booties, pants, and puffy jacket.","Mile 1552.1 (MA Rt 20 to Lee Massachusetts)

Quite spectacular really.  The young girl was just setting up so she wasn’t quite ready for hikers.  I did eat a small bag of chips as well as a day old doughnut (I’m not proud and could/would eat most anything).  I had a rather hard fall today, slipped on a wet rock on a steep descent.  I landed on my left forearm and wowzer did that hurt.  I was certain that I did some damage, but as it turns out not even a scratch...not even a bruise.  I’ve been lucky in that regard. Luck continued to shine down on us as hitchhiking into town was quick and easy.  Rode in the back of a pickup piloted by two self proclaimed ‘gypsy’ construction workers who were very curious about thru-hiking the AT. The motel was right in the midst of everything we needed which made resupplying an easy task.  Later in the day I had a pleasant talk with my wife and then checked in with two old friends (figuratively speaking of course).  Hey there Dave and Gail.  It made me smile to chat with you guys.","Mile 1682.6 (Minerva Hinchey Shelter)

The rest of the day was a fairly tedious series of ascents and descents.  At midday I arrived at the Lookout, a private cabin on the top of a mountain with a long wooden ladder ascending to its roof where there was a ‘lookout’.  The view was simply spectacular and I was able to FaceTime with Kathy as she was kayaking on our lake.  I ran into Dan as I was arriving, he had already eaten lunch and had taken in the view.  He was eager to carry on.  I ate lunch with ‘Derby’ a young fellow (social worker) from Rhode Island, with a self proclaimed voracious appetite.  Later in the day I caught up with Dan at the Edge Farm Store.  I made a ham sandwich, drank a Coke, and ate a package of cookies.  I then bought a pint of ice cream and an apple pastry and carried out a bottle of Gatorade.  I am camped in Dan’s backyard next to a small stream (named the Gulf Stream).

We skirted past Dartmouth College, traveling down a busy Main Street chock-full of students as well as various shops/restaurants.  Finding the bus stop was a bit of a challenge as there was no signage.

It was most excellent to spend some time with him, though it was all too short.  Later in the day Dan and I spent some time talking about the White Mountains and how we plan to approach this most difficult section of the trail.  I must admit to having some apprehension about the challenges that lie before us.","Mile 1749.8 (Comfort Inn - White River Junction.l)

The last climb of the day, Moose Mountain, was a different story.   It was longer and steeper and the humidity had increased by then.  There was however a beautiful view from the top.  At that point there was only .7 mile to the campsite. Since we arrived early there was ample time to set up camp, cook dinner (Mountain House - Beef Stroganoff), hang the bear bag, and crawl into my cocoon. One of the items my son delivered was my top quilt which I had sent back home a couple of months back.  I figured it would be helpful to have it in the White Mountains and in Maine (10* is probably overkill but one can never underestimate the importance of restorative sleep).  Crawling under my top quilt is oh so comfy.  Oh I almost forgot, we ran across a porcupine on the trail today.  He just ambled along the trail just in front of us for some 5-10 minutes.  The last time I saw a porcupine dates back to the late 1970’s when our dogs (Arlo and Tanya) decided to get too close to one while we were backpacking.  Kathy and I had a heck of a time trying to de-quill them.","Mile 1749.8 (Comfort Inn - White River Junction)

It was a cool morning and I started hiking in my puffy, balaclava, and fleecy gloves.  Got a good start on the day and for a change there was a relatively long descent down the backside of Smart’s Mnt.  One can’t get too excited about a long descent because inevitably it will be matched by an equal or more often than not greater climb.  True to form, the climb up Mnt Cube was relatively steep with some scrambling of boulders toward the end of the climb. The views from the first summit were exceptional and I was excited to push on to the North peak of the mountain. And what a view it was, at least for the first four and a half minutes.  We could see impending rain pushing across the valley below and sure enough it started to rain.  We gingerly began our descent (walking on wet rocks requires intense focus to avoid a slip and fall).  The temperature dropped and I was chilled for awhile.  The rain seemed to stop about 20 minutes or so into the descent.  Along the way we ran into a mother with three children all under the age of ten and a 3 month old infant in a front sling.  They did not have rain gear and did not look like hikers.  I mentioned the rain and the fact that the rocks were quite slippery, though she seemed unfazed by my comments and trudged up the trail.  Amazing, and not in a good way.  I am a relatively seasoned hiker and would never have thought about hiking a trail like this in such weather conditions with kids of that age.  Dan and I were treated with trail magic at the trailhead on NH 25A.  I ate far more than I should have: hamburger, hot dog, watermelon, home made cookies, homemade doughnuts, and two Cokes.  I also snagged another hot dog and homemade cinnamon bread for the road.  The purveyors of the trail magic were Colleen and Dave originally from Jamestown, NY but now living in New Hampshire.  I am fairly sure that Dave is an actor traveling incognito (the role of Mark Usher - House of Cards, played by Campbell Scott).  Implausible deniability.  I asked Dave if he and Colleen had ever watched House of Cards.  Dave said he had never heard of it.  Yeah right.  Take a look at this link to see what I mean.  https://houseofcards.fandom.co...Anyhow thanks for the incredible trail magic, 'Campbell' and Colleen.   Oh yeah,  one other thing to mention.  I had originally thought that I would complete the trail on day 180.  Looks like I did not do so well with my prediction as I have a little over 400 miles to go.  Live and learn.  Sorry my dear...I’ll be home soon."," Mile 1773.1 (Smart’s Mnt Tenting)

There was a bit of trail magic at one of the road crossings.  There were three guys who were preparing lunch for a group of young hikers who were doing Mount Moosilauke.  They were kind enough to make Dan and I a thick sandwich.

Dan and I hit the trail at 7:00 on the nose.  The beginning of the hike was fairly nondescript, though some twenty minutes into the day the climb began and I have to tell you, it was a climb. The day started at 1330 ft and the summit was st 4802 ft, the tallest climb in quite sometime.  Did I mention that it was a steep climb.  Oh my it was steep.  The thing is, I felt great.  Granted, I was taking ‘micro’ steps as a means to keep my heart and respiration rates in check.  It worked.  I also believe that the short hike yesterday, my afternoon siesta, a good nights sleep, two lunches, one dinner and a Mountain House Breakfast Skillet contributed to my bright spirit and elevated energy level. The views from the top of the mountain were simply extraordinary.  The climb down the other side was long, steep and quite rocky.  Nearly (somewhat of an exaggeration-but not by much) each step was from rock to rock or boulder to boulder.  The hike down the mountain required incredible focus in order to avoid a slip and fall.  While tedious at times it was also fun at times.  In general my spirts and stamina were as good as it gets for an old fart like me.  I faired much better than I expected, given the eight hours that it took to complete this section of the trail.  John from Inn32 picked us up at the Beaver Brook trailhead. Once in town I scurried off to the PO to pick up my new pair of (Oboz offers two free replacement shoes to thru/hikers) shoes but someone at the factory botched the mailing instructions and they had not arrived.  Customer service was apologetic but said the shoes would not arrive for four more days.  Unbelievable.  I decided to buy a  pair of shoes locally.  It was 4:00.  I did some research and found an outfitter in Lincoln, (Lahouts Country Clothing, Ski & Snowboard Shop)  but they close at 5:30.  So I had to arrange transportation and luckily was able to do so.  Jaydine a store employee was fantastic and helped me with buying a new pair of Solomon (xo pro 3d), the same shoes I started out with.  I can’t get too angry with Oboz as it is a free pair of shoes so I guess I’ll have them shipped to my home in South Carolina. All things considered, the shoe ordeal was relatively painless but it certainly messed with my resupply routine.  Didn’t get to sleep until after 11:00pm, well after hiker midnight.  On with the White Mountains tomorrow.  Dan and I have a preliminary (flexible) plan of attack.","Mile 1794.2 (Jeffers Brook Shelter)

When I wasn’t climbing over the above challenges I was tiptoeing around mud bogs (ankle deep or in some cases deeper).  Keep in mind this was during a fairly steep descent, where I would walk for more than about ten feet until the next challenge arose. It took intense concentration to avoid a slip and fall. So, the afternoon was quite tedious.  Dan and I had hoped to hike further on this day but we both simply ran out of steam.","Mile 1802.6 (Kinsman Notch/Beaver Brook Trail/NH 112)

The ascents and descents were some of the steepest yet.  On a dozen or so occasions I had to toss my trekking poles up to the next level and pull myself along using whatever might be available (edge of a rock, crevice, root, tree etc.  The rewards for doing so were absolutely breathtaking (in more ways than one).  I would rate today’s views as being some of the best I have seen in this six month journey.  We stopped in at one of the AMC (Appalachian Mountain Club) huts - Lonesome Lake. We had a bowl of soup and a pastry.  The hut can accommodate some 48 hikers though they are surprisingly quite expensive.  Dan and I are camped in a stealth spot up off the trail but probably short of the 200 ft rule.  We are shooting for another 10 mile day tomorrow but will be climbing four different mountain peaks:  Little Haystack Mountain (4,780 ft), Mount Lincoln (5,089), Mount Lafayette (5,260) and Mount Garfield 4,500).  The total ascent for the day will be 4,725 ft with the total descent being 2,713 ft.  I am certain that it is going to be a day to remember."," Mile 1810.1 (Eliza Brook Shelter)

Dan said he never heard a scream.  I will probably have more ‘moosemares’ when I get to Maine.  It’s been a good day, but a long one.  We didn’t really have much time to relax, what with all of the resupply/laundry chores.  The tentative plan is to take our time (Sunday/Monday) to get to the base of Mount Washington and summit on Tuesday when the weather is expected to be decent.  We will then have another couple of hiking days and will resupply in Gorman before moving on to finish up the “Presidentials”.  We are oh so close but oh so far from the border of Maine.  I have been told that the Presidentials are even more majestic than the Whites...and even more challenging (Oh great).  My wife made the observation recently that almost every step of the way on this journey there is a new and even more difficult challenge.  I am not sure I would disagree with her.  It does however create a certain amount of angst as to what the final chapter of this journey might hold.  BTW there is a rather strong thunderstorm going on at the moment.  I am thankful to be safe, warm and dry for the night.","Mile 1837.8 (Stealth Campsite at Zeacliff)

We had exhausted all other options other than hitchhiking - which would have been a difficult endeavor. Sorry Zach, Caleb, and Nick for the following. My only option for breakfast was to eat a roast beef submarine sandwich (I packed out an Italian submarine sandwich to eat for lunch on the trail).  I forgot to mention that I had a pork sundae for dinner last night- layer of cornbread, layer of baked beans, layer of pulled pork, layer of coleslaw, layer of pickles cooked and served in an iron skillet.  Back to the hike.  It looked like rain early on but as the day progressed the weather improved.  The morning hours of walking were relatively easy, largely flat,other than stretches of rocks and boulders.  Because of the terrain we made much better time than we predicted.  We reached our intended destination (Ethan Pond Shelter) by 12:30. After eating lunch there we decided to push on to the intersection of US Route 302.  We were hoping for some trail magic and evidently there was some but we arrived too late. A fellow hiker did pass along a can of beer to me that had been gifted to him.  There was some stealth camping near the road, though given that it is a state park the rangers are said to patrol the area.  Once again, the decision was made to push on.  The AT guides made mention of a stealth campsite about two miles down the trail.  Well ‘down the trail’ is not a good characterization of the topography of this particular portion of the trail.  The trail actually headed up Mt Webster (3,910 feet).  Our destination was Webster Cliffs, 1.5 miles from the top.  We found the stealth campsite along with two other hikers.  More important than the campsite was the view from the cliffs.  Simply, utterly beautiful.  The picture in this post was from the Cliffs.  The extra miles hiked today opened up a couple nice options for tomorrow, setting us up for summiting Mt Washington on Tuesday.  Stay tuned.  I’m thinking that hiking the Presidentials is going to be incredible.","Mile 1839.1 (Zealand Falls Trail - junction)

While in the Lakes of the Clouds hut tonight, a fellow approached me asking if I happened to be Yet2b.  Turns out he has been reading my journal.  'Thanks for following along and taking the time to say hello'. We have about a mile and a half and we will reach the Mount Washington summit at about 9:00 tomorrow morning.  We are ahead of our hiking plans for this section of the trail.  I am sleeping on the floor of the dinning room tonight.  It was a long and fruitful day.","Mile 1848.5 (stealth campsite next to Webster Cliffs)

Blue sky and visibility of 90 miles.  Who could ask for anything more. We had some snacks at the visitor center and then began the descent down the mountain. While there were more than a few rocks while ascending the mountain they were overlooked (so to speak) what with the excitement of summiting.  During the descent the rocks became much more tedious. In fact the rest of the day was spent climbing up and down a rock infested trail.  While the views were once again stupendous, appreciating them was difficult what with the need to be focused on foot placement.  At any moment there was a high probability of a fall or twisted ankle.  When I was walking through Pennsylvania I often wondered where all the rocks came from.  I now have the answer, they were taken from New Hampshire.  Upon reaching the Madison Springs Hut we had a bowl of soup and bread.  Two of the young staff sat down beside me and we chatted for a long time.  I was surprised that they only made minimum wage.  The staff are also responsible for resupplying the hut with provisions (once a week...I think...as well as carting out trash).  Their backpacks were said to carry between 75-100 lbs.    We left the hut and descended down a long (.7 mile) and quite steep path to the Valley Way Campsite.  Of course the trail was exceedingly rocky.  I was so tired I only snacked for dinner.  I talked briefly with my wife, Kathy and then started writing a journal entry and fell asleep.  I woke back up at 11pm or so and completed my note.  Oh what a beautiful and very long day.","Mile 1857.7.

At about noon or so we were still nearly five miles from our destination.  While it never rained hard, it was enough to make the rock surfaces quite slick.  Luckily the last couple miles of the trail were relatively easy.  The lodge is quite nice.  Dan and I are in a four bed bunk room, but as of 8:00 pm no one else has been put in the room with us.  We have had a gear explosion in the room and it is quite smelly.  Not sure I would want to stay in the same room with two thru hikers.  The room rate, essentially $100.00 includes a buffet dinner and breakfast.  Dinner was quite good.  There was a small shop so we did a basic short term supply.  After breakfast tomorrow we will be hiking up and over Wildcat Peak (elevation 4050).  Word is that the first mile or so is nearly vertical rock.  It has been raining all afternoon and will continue to do so until 10:00, so unfortunately those vertical rocks are going to be slick.   The current plan is to lessen the daily miles for the next three 1/2 days - in part because of the upcoming challenges and in part because of the camping options.  The next resupply will be four days out (Rattle River Lodge & Hostel).","Mile 1864.8 (Madison Spring Hut & Valley Way Campsite)

To be sure, it did not disappoint.  It was clearly the most challenging climb thus far.  The fact that the rocks were still wet from last nights rain increased the level of difficulty.  There were a few instances where the climbing was nearly vertical.  It required hand over hand climbing and was as close to ‘mountain climbing’ as I hope to experience.  On occasion today the climb required maximum effort on my part (i.e. physical & mental). It took some four hours to reach Wildcat Peak.  The good news was that I found the challenge to be ‘almost’ intoxicating, especially when the effort was rewarded with incredible views. There were some five different sections where there were breathtaking vistas.  When we arrived at the top of the first peak there was a ski area with an operational gondola bringing people to the summit.  As we walked out of the woods we seemingly startled a family.  They asked where we came from to which we replied, in unison, “Georgia”.   The look on their faces was priceless.  They were so intrigued by our adventure that they took a picture of us with their two children. BTW the kids seemed more than a little reticent to ‘Stand So Close’ to two old smelly hikers. The remainder of the day was spent descending the altitude earned from the morning’s climb.  I had another fairly hard fall today while walking across a wet and slippery ‘boardwalk’ while climbing down the backside of the mountain.   The good news (quite amazing really) is that I landed squarely on my backpack-with no damage done.  It took eight hours to hike from Pinkham Notch to the Carter Notch (AMC) Hut, where I feasted on a bowl of potato soup and cornbread.  This particular hut is the last one we will encounter and is the smallest and most remote of the AMC huts.  Even so they had 20 people registered for the hut tonight and 30 people tomorrow night.  Tomorrow is going to be a rather full day, with more than a few climbs [Carter Dome-4,832 ==> Mount Hight-4,653 ===> South Carter Mountain-4,430 ===> Middle Carter Mountain- 4,610 ===> North Carter Mountain-4,530].  Should be an interesting day.  Once again, the intended mileage is low and the days hike will end at the Imp Campsite some 6.8 miles down the trail.","Mile 1872.6 (Pinkham Notch - Joe Dodge Lodge - associated with the AMC)

The climbs today, collectively speaking, while hard were not extreme.  However, the descent down North Carter was OMG so steep.  On several occasions it was necessary to slide on my butt to descend to the next level.  It was a challenge that I was not expecting.  Once I was at the Imp Campsite I was (literally) struck by the extent of the wind.  The temperatures seemed to have dropped.  By the time I set up camp, I was freezing.  I was wearing my down jacket, rain jacket (with its hood), wool balaclava and I was still uncomfortably cold.  I ate as quickly as I could and crawled into my hammock and 10 degree quilts and I couldn’t shake the chill.  I was not terribly far from shivering.  Amazingly it took well over an hour for me to feel warm...and then I promptly fell asleep.  Later i had a brief chat with my wife and one of my sons and it is now 10:00pm and I am writing today’s entry.  BTW there was an amazing view site on the descent from North Carter and I was able to see some of Maine’s Mountains.  Such an incredible view.  Can’t believe that I am almost knocking on Maine’s door (or that in a few days it will be September).  How did that happen?!?!","Mile 1878.5 (a stealth site near Carter Notch Hut)

Breakfast (waffles) were being served at the hostel at 6:00.  Chatted with a fellow hiker who was more than a little perturbed.  Turns out some motorcycle riders arrived at the hostel late (11:00pm or so...well past hiker midnight) and made quite the commotion settling in to the bunkhouse.  Sure glad I was in my hammock.  Today’s hiking was simply delightful.  Once again we were graced with cool temperatures (the day started out at 48*), blue sky, and abundant sunshine.  Saw a couple snakes today as well as quite a bit of moose droppings (but no moose sightings as yet). The trail provided a generous mix of challenging ascents and descents, boggy conditions, board walks, mountain vistas, and at times even a relatively flat path.  The best part was that none of the conditions described above were long lasting.  In other words the trail was constantly changing through the day.  Turns out it was one of my favorite days.  I will admit that toward the end of the day (9 1/2 hours of hiking) that I was tired.  Today’s mileage was a little more than we have been doing lately, what with the White Mountains and the Presidentials.  The plan for tomorrow (Monday) involves a much shorter day as we are being strategic about what lies ahead.  Here is what Guthook has to say about Tuesday’s challenge:  “For 0.8 miles, the Appalachian Trail (following the Mahoosuc Trail) winds its way through a deranged jumble of boulders at the bottom of this deep cleft between Fulling Mill Mountain and Mahoosuc Mountain. Expect your hiking pace to be slowed drastically here, since the trail is almost as much rock climbing and boulder-hopping as hiking in this section. Due to the sheer cliffs above, and lack of sunlight, you may often find snow and ice beneath the rocks even into the late parts of the summer. Be careful, and enjoy!”.  Kind of excited about this.  Oh yeah, I passed the 1,900 mile mark today which means that I have less than 300 miles left on this epic journey [287 miles to be exact].  I’m not sure what to think about that statement.  It is exciting to think that it is coming to a close and getting back home (as I miss my wife) but at the same time I can’t quite imagine the journey being over.  I guess my psychological reaction to it all is “yet2b” determined.  Now where have I heard that phrase before?  Stay tuned.","Mile 1893.7 (junction if US 2 and the AT - Rattle River Lodge & Hostel- Gorham)

At times having one’s trekking poles was a liability as both hands were needed.  I managed to drop one if my poles in a crevice and had to remove my pack to reach down with my feet to retrieve it.  I then slung my pack on my back and instantaneously my water bottle dropped in the same dang crevice never to be seen again.  I only have two battle scars, the first being a ‘road rash’ type injury (minor but annoying) where my knee slid down the side of a boulder.  I also managed to mangle my right thumb (also minor but more than a little painful) slamming it in between my two trekking poles as I was sliding down a boulder.  I took a long lunch (45 minutes or so) after the Notch (even used my hammock chair).  The rest of the day until 4:00 or so was spent climbing up Mahoosuc Arm.  I took it very very slowly as it was quite steep and at times a little scary.  All in all it was a good day, tiring to be sure but quite nice to know that an old fart like me could survive the Notch and the Arm with only minor battle scars.  I am snug as a bug in my hammock and without a doubt I shall sleep well tonight.","Mile 1915.1 (Full Goose Shelter)

I began walking in my wool balaclava, rain jacket and floppy hat, and I was still cold.  I couldn’t seem to regulate my body temperature.  At the moment (6:18pm) I’m in my hammock and 10 degree quilts and have not yet warmed up.  Climbing off of Moody was steep at times and I slipped and fell once.  The climb up Old Blue was steep and long.  There were a couple of sections where it was necessary to rely on the rebars that had been attached to the bedrock.  The climb took two and a half hours.  The walk down the backside was steep as well.  I slipped and fell rather hard, but once again my trusty backpack saved the day.  Much of the day was spent navigating through rocks, roots, and mud bogs.  It never warmed up as it was overcast most of the day and began to drizzle briefly later in the day.  I was not in the best of moods.  The weather (while not as cold) reminded me of what I experienced back in February.  I sure hope we have many warm days to come.  Anyhow I was in my grumpy mood when I crested Bemis Mnt. Thing is I caught a glimpse of what is yet to come (multiple lakes and beautiful mountains).  While the view did not neutralize my grumpy mood, it did provide some hope that Maine will offer some incredible experiences.  I did eventually warm up in my comfortable cocoon   Thank God for goose down.","Mile 1943.9 (stealth campsite)

As you probably noticed, I was not in the best of moods yesterday.  Weather and terrain have such an impact on one’s mood.  While it was cold when I first woke up this morning (I could see my breath), the sun finally reappeared.  Ahhh blue sky and sunshine, certainly elevate one’s mood. The morning hours involved some steep ascents and descents, but they were short in duration.  There were those dang roots though.  However the afternoon’s terrain was relatively smooth. Finally it felt like I was hiking again as opposed to being involved with some demented quest to scale every possible mountain that exists.  There were some nice views along the way.  I saw my first moose today, well kind of sorta.  Actually I saw a collection of bones that appeared to come from a moose.  I did hear my first Loon today.  They have such a haunting call.  No falls today, though while crossing one of those pesky Maine Boggs (on a log), the darn log rolled resulting in my right foot taking a nosedive (er...toe dive) into the deep mud.  The campsite that I am at tonight had a couple of canoes, so I was able to enjoy some paddling on the pond.  I prefer kayaking, but it was awfully nice to be out on the water.  I  decided to have a campfire tonight.  Turns out denatured alcohol is one hell of a flammable substance.  Deathmarch Dan, George (young female thru hiker) and I chatted for awhile around the fire.  I deftly managed to fall off my log seat landing squarely on my back.  It was more than a little embarrassing to be helped to my feet by a twenty something female.  Oh well.  Dark Sky is calling for rain early tomorrow morning, just in time for the start of our hike.  Dan and I will be staying tomorrow night with an old (figuratively speaking of course) college (Lycoming) “suite mate”  of my wife.  I have not seen Pam since 1974.  It is amazing that she offered to house two old smelly thru-hikers.","Mile 1953.9 (Bemis Mountain Lean-to)

Pam and Dick made a feast for Dan and I: chicken, sweet corn, new potatoes, zucchini, as well as some pickles and cherry tomatoes.  Homemade cherry pie with a healthy scoop of ice cream.  Oh my.  I mention eating all that food because I must.  I stepped on their digital scale in the bathroom; turns out that I have dropped some 30 lbs. since my journey began.  Back on the trail first thing tomorrow morning.","Mile 1966.8 (Little Swift River Pond - Official Campsite)

Pam dropped Dan and I off at the trailhead a little after eight.  It didn’t take long for it to start drizzling and for most of the morning it was either drizzle or light rain.  [I forgot to mention that it pretty much rained all day yesterday].  Trail conditions today were rather miserable.  The mud puddles were bigger and the bogs boggier. Water was often traveling down the trail much like a stream.  While it did eventually stop raining, the wet conditions never abated.  It was the wettest my feet have been in quite some time.  At one point I was walking in ankle deep (fairly cold) water.  Much of the day was dodging: boulders/rocks, roots, mud puddles, bogs.  There was very little hiking, just dodging.  It was also another day of climbing mountains:  Saddleback Mountain (elevation 4120), The Horn (elevation 4141), and Saddleback Junior (elevation 3655).  So in addition to dodging there was a great deal of time spent ascending and descending.  All in all, a rather tiring day.  There were however some outstanding vistas.  Dark Sky is calling for more rain tomorrow.","Mile 1971.6 (ME 4 - to Phillips, Maine)

I can’t say that I had a happy day.  The rain while not heavy, was relentless at least until about 11:30am or so.  As you might guess given my statements across the past couple of days, the trail was a bloody mess, mud puddles, boggy bogs, with wet moss covered rocks and roots waiting to ply their treachery on anyone not paying attention.  Staying hyper focused is exhausting in itself apart from the demands of thru hiking. I did slide to my butt on a couple occasions, no damage done - though I don’t have as much padding there as I once did.  I had to ford a stream today.  Rock hopping was out of the question as everything was quite slick and the risk of falling in too great. So I simply waded across water that went to the top of my calves.  That crossing was fairly early on in the hike so I had wet squishy feet most of the day. Given the weather there was not much to see, which all served to dampen (pun intended) my mood. There are a slew of folks staying in the shelter tonight (is supposed to stop raining about 9:00) and I am camped nearby, strung up in my hammock.

It was quite cold this morning (lower 40’s/upper 30’s) and it took some mental resolve to climb out of my warm cocoon. As usual there was a steep climb to start the day (Spaulding Mountain elevation 4,010) though the trail at least bypassed the summit.  The climb down the backside was quite steep and there were a few “I don’t really want to do this"" moments. In particular (during the steepest portion of the descent) the trail took a hard turn to the left and then dropped down about eight feet.  The trekking poles were a liability and were tossed down to the next level.  So I had to reach around the outside of a boulder with my right hand to find a hand hold (in order to support my weight) and then with my left hand find a place to grab hold of (for maneuverability) and swing out and down to the level below.  Once the “swinging” motion was in play there was no turning back.  Failing to execute this maneuver perfectly would certainly result in ruining one’s day (if not one’s entire journey).  While this is probably child’s play in rock climbing 101, I never had that course. That was as close to mountain scrambling that I hope to experience.  Having said all of that, once my feet hit the ground I have to admit there was a smile (of relief) on my face.  The descent was about an hour and a half long and was a tiring ordeal.  The day ended early (1:30 or so) as Dan and I were just so fatigued (walking in the rain yesterday and the climb up and down Spaulding Mountain today).  We also have two + 4,000 mountains to climb tomorrow morning so we wanted to build in some time for recuperation.  Once I was set up at the campsite, I took a wonderful two hour siesta.

Slept well last night, no moosemares even with all the moose droppings that we have been encountering.  I’ve been thinking about many of my recent posts and I’m starting to sound like an evening news meteorologist.  “Good evening, tonight’s trail report is being brought to you by Little Debbie’s Honey Buns, breakfast of champions.  We seem to be in somewhat of a stagnant pattern with respect to trail conditions.  The probability of steep morning climbs and steep afternoon descents is quite high.  There may be some brief periods of minimal elevation gains or loss, but once again the duration will be rather short.  The rock count and root counts are quite elevated and not expected to drop anytime soon. Given these factors, those of you with knee pain or tired muscles may want to stay indoors or perhaps consider alternate paths. We do believe that this particular trail pattern will continue for at least the next couple weeks.  Conditions are expected to improve some thirty miles into the Hundred Mile Wilderness.  We are however keeping a close eye on an emerging elevation disturbance at about mile 2192. The last named disturbance began with the letter J (Mnt Jefferson) so this one will begin with the letter K.  The European and American path predictions are quite homogeneous and the likelihood of a direct encounter (category 4) is therefore quite imminent.  We will keep you apprised of this disturbance as the miles count down.”  On a more serious note, all of this mountain climbing has exacted a toll on my overall energy level (as well as that of my hiking partner).  Our (faulty) expectations were that after the White Mountains and the Presidential's  the trail would “mellow out”, so to speak.  The Southern portion of Maine is no joke and has been more challenging than expected.  Our daily mileage has been considerably lower than anticipated.  At the end of each day there has been little to no gas left in the tank.  We are looking forward to a break in trail conditions as predicted above.  At the trailhead on ME Route 27 we experienced trail magic from a former thru hiker, Hobo.  We lucked out hitchhiking into town.  A mother and grown son were headed in the opposite direction and (at the request of the son) turned around to offer us a ride into town.  By the way, they shared some blueberry muffins.  Hobo offered to take us back to the trailhead in the morning.  We are staying at the White Wolf Inn and restaurant.  Ran into “Recon”. He is still struggling with the after effects of Lyme’s disease.  Oh yeah, we passed the 2,000 mile marker today.","Mile 1996.5 (Crocker Cirque Campsite)

I slept pretty good last night, hanging in the shelter.  We got a reasonably good start to the day, on the trail by 7:00.  It was foggy/misty and quite cold.   As I was leaving the campsite today I ran into a father and his young son, camped by the trail (Dakota and Merrick-age 6).  I mentioned in passing that I raised three sons and that the experience “was a trip”.  Dakota then informed me that Merrick is the eldest of his four boys.  Oh my.  I noted that it was cold this morning and that I need to pick up some hand warmers.  He smiled,  turned around and rummaged through his pack and produced a handful of them.  The generosity of total strangers on this trip has been quite amazing. As I was about to carry on, his young son exclaimed that he was ready to go hiking.  I wish I had such enthusiasm on a damp and cold day such as this.  I hiked most of the morning and part of the afternoon wearing my wool balaclava and gloves. The cold was exacerbated by the wind and the elevation.  Yesterday’s trail report turned out to be accurate as today was yet another day of ascending and descending mountains:  North Horn (elevation 3,810 ft), West Peak of Bigelow Mountain (elevation 4,145 ft), Bigelow Mountain Avery Peak (elevation 4,088 ft), and Little Bigelow Mountain (3,025 ft).  The views from Avery peak were extraordinary.  I am extremely pleased to report that there are no more 4,000 ft mountains to climb between here and Katahdin.  About 100 miles from my current location lies Whitecap Mountain, (elevation 3,644) the only peak with elevation in the 100 mile wilderness.  I felt good today with the first three climbs, my mood was bright (despite the cold) and I seemed to have plenty of energy.  I think the fact that we have been having some lower mileage days allowed my body to recouperate.  I will admit though that I was fairly tired across the last couple of miles. It is hard to believe that I am so close to hiking the final stretch of this journey, the 100 mile wilderness.","Mile 2008.9 (Horns Pond Lean-to)

It was cold again this morning though it was not as damp, which is a good thing. The hiking goal for today was set rather low (7.5) as Southern Maine has been kicking (my/our) butts.  Turns out that goal was reached by noon, so we pushed on to this great stealth site just beside the lake.  This was one of those rare days that did not involve a major climb.  I am so thankful for that. There were two smaller climbs, one at 1,500 ft and one at 2,000 ft. Easy peasy.  The rest of the day was spent actually hiking on a trail as opposed to mountain climbing.  Even so, the trail was littered with Maine’s rocks and roots. After eating dinner tonight I walked over to the lake to watch the reflection of the sunset on the water.  So soothing.  So quiet.  Because we got in extra miles today, tomorrow’s mileage is lower. So a later start is on tap.  If it is a clear day I will use that time to watch the sunrise.  If it is cloudy, I will sleep in.  I’m not sure which option I would prefer.  Katahdin is 161.4 miles away.

It was dang cold by the way.  I decided to bring along my top quilt to cover myself, a wickedly brilliant idea if I must say so myself.  The night sky was awash in stars.  I was hoping to see the Milky Way, but even at this early hour the sun’s rays were beginning to light up the horizon and therefore erasing some of the fainter lit stars.  It was so peacefully quiet.  I sat there for an hour watching the sun’s rays illuminate the clouds.  While not the most spectacular sunrise (remember, I live on a lake and one of my favorite activities is to kayak out into the middle of Lake Cooley to watch the sunrise...I’ve witnessed some truly spectacular sunrises) it was and will nevertheless be a memorable one.  As the sun began to warm the air, clouds of steam/mist began to rise obscuring the sunrise.  At that point I returned to my cocoon for a half hour or so, to warm back up.   Today’s hike did not begin until 8:01.  Once again the trail was, for the most part, a pleasant walk through a piney forest.  Oh so pleasant, with no appreciable ascents or descents.  The intended goal today was Pierce Pond Lean to.  Thing is, I arrived there at 10:45.  Dan and ate lunch there but decided to check out the sporting camp, just a short distance from the lean to.  There is supposed to be a storm coming in tonight - so we elected to stay dry and comfortable. For $40.00 (each) we had a cabin (no electricity/lard lamps and wood stove), coffee, cookie, shower, and pancake (12 with blueberries, strawberries, apples, confectionary sugar), sausage and eggs breakfast. Not a bad deal.  The camp is very rustic but oh so cool.  Not sure it could ever happen but I’d love to bring the family here at some point in the future (Bodtorf FamJam 2022 ?).  The owner, Tim, has been running the place now for some 35 years.  He appears happier than a clam doing so.  I was sitting in the dinning room looking out the window at the forest below, when he asked if I would mnd if he played the keyboard.  I was treated to an hour's worth of his music, Quite impressive and enjoyable.  I’ve not had any cell service now for a couple of days, but I was able to call my wife from the camp’s (staticky) radio phone. My wife’s phone went to voice mail, so I left a detailed msg.  She immediately called back (not having listened to the msg).  Me thinks she was worried that something was wrong, what with a phone call from an unknown phone number in Maine.   Today was my eldest son’s birthday, and sadly it was the first time that I haven’t been able to wish him a happy birthday (given my remote location).  Tomorrow we will be hiking the short distance (about five miles or so) to the Kennebec River, where we will take the iconic canoe ferry to the opposite bank and then walk a short distance into Caratunk where we will be staying at Caratunk House.  We will resupply and pick up some packages from home before the three/four day hike to Monson, the last stop before entering the 100 Mile Wilderness.  The relatively decent weather combined with the relatively easy trail has lifted my spirits.  I am oh so excited to experience the 100 mile wilderness.","Mile 2030.6 (stealth campsite beside Carry Pond)

Discretion being the better part of valor, we marched on.  The extra 2.6 miles took just about every ounce of energy that I had.  We arrived at our destination at about 6:00 and went about the business of setting up camp as well as making and eating dinner.  I ended up having to deploy my tarp by the light of my headlamp.  There is no doubt in my mind that I will sleep well tonight.  I forgot to mention, I am camped beside a babbling brook.  That sound is so soothing that I am quite certain to fall..............zzzzzzz","Mile 2040.8 (Caratunk House)

Hiking through such terrain, at least for me, is quite a fatiguing ordeal.  I was content to end this day at just under ten miles.  I am camped at a stealth site next to a stream.  The sound of the stream will once again lull me to sleep. Unfortunately, first thing in the morning I will have to ford this body of water (West Branch of the Piscataquis River).  Dan and I have scouted out what appears to be a safe crossing site, but there is no way to cross it other than to get one’s feet wet.  I will be taking my socks off, pulling the insoles out of my shoes, and then crossing in my shoes.  Time will tell whether this was a good idea.  I ran into a South Bound hiker today named “Truck Stop”.  He has been on the trail for one week and hopes to finish in January.  He is from Texas.  I am not sure that he realizes what he is in for.  The Huts in the Whites will be closed as well as many of the hostels.  It will be a cold and lonely trek for him.

A young female hiker, who just completed the 100 mile wilderness offered us a ride into town.  Shaw’s Hostel seems to be a decent place though it is quite busy here.  Monson is a quaint Maine small town. There is one “sit down” restaurant and I enjoy an order of pot roast.  We will take a Zero tomorrow and a Nero on Monday after picking up our packages from home.  I talked with my wife today in SC where the temperatures are in the low 90’s.","Mile 2065.4 (Stealth Campsite near West Branch of the Piscataquis River)

Given the the late start (10:00 - had to pick up two packages at the Post Office) combined with my ridiculous pack weight, today’s mileage was quite low.  I do appreciate however having my fleece pull-over, new Oboze shoes, and (yet to be used) neoprene socks. In the greater scheme of things, today’s hike (into the Hundred Mile Wilderness) was uneventful and relatively easy.  It is just that my pack was too dang heavy.  Hopefully, eating down lunch, dinner, and breakfast tomorrow morning will lighten my load some.  Looks like the availability of water sources is good for tomorrow, so I will also be able to go light on water.  As we were crossing a dirt road today there were some day hikers, and one of them exclaimed “hey...what’s your name...I think I know you...”.  Turns out he has been following my journey on ‘trail journals’.  That has happened on a handful of occasions across the time I have been on the trail...quite amazing.  Unfortunately I forgot to ask his name.  At about 4 miles into the hike tomorrow is the Little Wilson Stream, which will have to be crossed.  I ran into a hiker today who said it was deep enough to wet the bottom of his shorts (he was 6’2”), so it should be interesting.  Hopefully we can make up some miles tomorrow as we will be shooting for the Long Pond Stream lean-to, some 12 miles down the trail.  It was somewhat surreal to enter the Hundred Mile Wilderness today.  There was nothing about the day that was all that exciting.  Here’s to hoping that this trek through the wilderness will be as impressive as I have imagined.","Mile 2074.2 (Lake Hebron parking lot, just outside of Monson)

On a relative basis the climbs and descents were not that bad, in fact I ‘almost’ enjoyed them.  The views from Whitecap Mountain were incredible.  Whitecap is the highest peak in the region of the Hundred Mile Wilderness.  This was also the first day that we were able to see Katahdin.  It is a beast of a mountain.  The latter part of the day was largely downhill.  It should have been easy but the rocks and roots made it difficult to develop a rhythm.  There were some flatter sections towards the end of the day, but by then my various body systems were beginning to rebel. All in all it was a good hiking day what with cooler temperatures along with blue sky and sunshine.  It was however (and remains) rather windy.  I haven’t bothered to mention that I’ve had a sore throat across the past couple of days.  Dan mentioned today that he has had one also.  A few minutes ago he wondered if he has a cold coming on.  Just as he was saying those words I was having the same thought.  After crawling into my hammock my nose is all stuffed up and I can’t breathe through my nose.  Dang it all.  Dan and I have decided to stay at the Whitehouse Landing, one of few vestiges of civilization in the 100 Mile Wilderness.  We are about two and a half days out from the Whitehouse Landing.  The only way to get across the lake is by boat.  The owner will be picking us up at 11:30 that day.  Dan and I have been doing some calculations and have a tentative summit date of Friday the 27th (+/-) one or two days.","Mile 2113.4 (stealth campsite)

It rained fairly hard and steady last night, so our decision to take a Nero was a most excellent one.  It also gave us some additional time to get over our colds. Breakfast was great this morning: eggs, bacon, biscuits, and all you can eat blueberry pancakes.  As we were eating breakfast the rain returned and was fairly heavy.  Rather than return to the trailhead in pouring rain (@ 8:30), we elected to hang out on the front porch until the owner’s (Bill) wife Linda could  run us to the dock.  By 11:30 the rain lessened and it was only a slight drizzle.  Riding in an open boat in a slight drizzle was surprisingly chilly.  The rain continued on and off for the first couple of hours of the hike.  All this rain though did make for a rather wet trail (ie. lots of puddles, swollen creek crossings, and at times the trail itself was a stream). I was proud of my water avoidance skills, as I successfully navigated more than a few puddles, streams, and bogs, with one exception.  I was probably 100 yards from my destination and there was a small creek crossing.  Wouldn’t you know it, one foot slipped off a rock and I spun around to keep from falling and wound up with two wet feet. What a way to end the day.  Despite those factors it was a decent hiking day.  It feels as if I am on the mend as it relates to my cold.  My energy was back.  I am once again sleeping in a shelter.  I have my hammock strung from the rafters.  At 7:00 (it is quite dark) and thusfar it is just us two in a six person shelter.  They are calling for rain again tonight and I just wasn’t in the mood to deal with wet gear.  I am having trouble getting my mind around the next statement.  Assuming that all goes well with our hiking and weather conditions, I will only be sleeping in the woods on two more occasions.  Tomorrow we hope to be stealth camping at mile 2168 (Rainbow Lake), ""Thanks Michael Neiman"".  Thursday we will be staying at the Abol Campground.  On Friday we will hike the 10 miles into Baxter State Park and camp at the Birches Campground-our last night of camping.  Saturday we will summit.  We hope to catch the 4:30 shuttle to Millinocket and will be staying at the AT Lodge (Hostel) .

It was during that thru hike that they met the other couple.  When we attempted to follow them back to their car (where the food was located) they stated “no...sit, you’ve already walked far enough"".  So they carried it from their car, back to the shelter.

They passed along: a couple of beers, fresh fruit and vegetables, cookies, brownies, candy bars, Gatorade, bags of chips.  I am tucked away in my hammock, outside the Birches Lean-to.  I had tried to hammock inside the shelter, but the eye-hook pulled loose from the wall, sending me to the shelter floor.  Luckily (because of the design of the shelter) I was only 3 inches from the ground.  No harm done.

I set my alarm this morning for 3:30 am and by about 4:00 am (in the dark) I had packed up my hammock and gear.  As I would be slack packing to the Katahdin summit, I had to separate essential gear for the day’s hike from non essential gear that would be dropped off at the rangers station.  I made a hot breakfast (also in the dark) and then Dan and I headed off to the rangers station to drop off our gear. Given the elevated water levels we decided to take the prescribed reroute that eventually met up with the Hunt trail which leads to the  summit of Katahdin.  We hit the trail at 5:30 am.  The climb up to Katahdin is no joking matter. For two old farts like Dan and I, it required maximum effort on our part to navigate certain challenging sections.   I freely admit to having some anxiety about some of the required maneuvers. It didn’t help that the forecast called for rain and at times there was some slight drizzle. The wind was very strong as well, gusting to some 20-40 mph at times. During the climb I was thinking, “please let this be over” and “don’t do anything silly to hurt yourself “.  All things considered, it was a decent day for a summit, not too cold and not too hot. I felt much better on the descent and found myself enjoying the climb down.  All total it took some 8 1/2 hours to make the climb up and down the mountain.  I am now in Millinocket, staying at the AT Lodge.  It feels good to be in a real bed. It is hard to wrap my mind around the fact that my journey has come to an end.  It has been an epic adventure that took so much longer than I expected and it certainly pushed me to the limits in so many ways.  As I mentioned once before, sometime before the end of the year I will write an epilogue and attempt to explore the lessons learned and how those lessons may impact my life.  Stay tuned.","Mile 2186.8 (Birches Lean to)

yet2b,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623818,"Mini Epilogue. I am back home now and have been so for a few days. The journey back to ‘civilization’ was an interesting one. Along the way (on the bus ride to the airport) a young fellow overheard me talking about my journey and walked back the aisle of the bus and sat in the seat across from me. I couldn't help but notice his unusual garb - dark color suit and pants devoid of buttons. He sported a long beard. I recognized him as an Amish man. He was a thirty-two year old man. He and his wife had come (from Ohio) to Maine to visit family (BTW at 32 he has seven children). He was very curious about my journey and noted that he too one day would like to hike the trail. He peppered me with questions about the experience. I told the fellow that there are a variety references that would be of value to him, though quite interestingly he noted that he cannot read. When he was through, I too had so many questions to ask him about the Amish. He was surprisingly talkative, willing to respond to any question I asked. It is not often that such an opportunity exists, as the Amish are not known for being particularly open with the ‘English’. It was a most interesting and valued interaction for me. I also wanted to note that flying into Laguardia airport (NYC) and navigating the terminal was nearly overwhelming to me having spent the last 7 1/2 months in the woods. I am not sure that I have ever seen so many people wandering around at the same time (well maybe once - back in the 70’s when I attended a large concert at Watkins Glen (600,000 people). I almost ran back into the woods. It is quite ironic that up arriving home that my wife informed me that the pipe bringing water to our house failed and it would not be repaired for several days. So I am enjoying the comforts of being back home, minus running water. In some respects it was like being back on the trail. It feels good to be back home. I wasn’t sure how our bed would feel after spending 7 1/2 months in my hammock. Surprisingly (to me…as I love my hammock), the bed is quite comfortable. As I noted previously, come the end of the year I will take the time to craft a more indepth epilogue to my trek. Check back if you like. 
This is just a (not so) brief note to thank all of the folks who have either assisted me directly or indirectly in my recent thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail. I guess family comes to mind first. I could not have accomplished this journey without the assistance and support of my wife, Kathleen. For some three years before I stepped on the trail, Kathy patiently accepted my obsessive focus on preparing for this epic hike which included: countless hours on the computer reading about the AT, countless hours spent researching camping/hiking gear, daily walks on our dead end street as well as numerous day-hikes and backpacking trips. All of these activities diminished the time we could spend together (kayaking, pontooning, enjoying one another’s company). Kathy was also instrumental in keeping my trail journal up-to-date. In addition she: assumed full responsibility for household (and office) matters, traveled to meet on a couple of occasions, mailed supply packages (food/gear), kept my debit account solvent, and provided encouragement in our nearly daily phone contacts. This journey could not have taken place without her love and support. Thanks to my three sons for their belief that their old man could actually accomplish such a feat. Zach, thanks for your willingness to meet me in Vermont to bring along some replacement gear and your efforts at assisting Death March Dan and I with respect to ‘resupply’. Thanks to my sons, Caleb and Nick (and Zach) for your interest and encouragement which was evident in our occasional phone conversations across the past few months. To my sister Gloria (and husband Rick) thank you for hosting a tired, smelly, and hobbled hiker. You will never know how much your assistance meant to me (amazing food, conversation, trip to the podiatrist). I can’t imagine what would have taken place if you hadn’t helped me with my poison ivy immersion. To my sister Beverly, thanks for the incredible lunch and concomitant conversation. To my nephew John and his wife, thanks to you guys for taking me into your lovely home and assisting me. It was a respite that I needed. Many thanks to Erin and her husband for graciously opening up your home to a tired hiker. Much respect for an old (figuratively speaking) friend from high school, Steven Biggs and his wife for hosting a hungry hiker and assisting me in resupply. Your obvious interest in my journey was appreciated as well as your involvement in putting together a ‘mini’ cedar cliff reunion. Many thanks to Kathy Hakes, Sue Clemmer, Tim McFadden, and Keith Sultzbaugh for taking time to meet me at Dukes Bar & Grill in Wormleysburg. Such a good time. Many many thanks to my wife’s college suite-mate, Pam Matthews and her husband for hosting two smelly, old, and beleaguered hikers. Your generosity was greatly appreciated. Special thanks to Jerry 
Bresee (Lycoming) who travel to Harpers Ferry and took me out for a most excellent dinner with wonderful conversation. Most of my readers are well aware of the term “trail angel” individuals (sometimes former hikers, sometimes not) who out of the goodness of their hearts (expecting nothing in return) provide assistance (i.e. shuttle rides, food, housing, beverages) to hikers. I am humbled by the generosity of the countless trail angels that I encountered on my journey. Simple acts (e.g. the + 80 year old retired school teacher who offered me a ride, the elderly hiker who gave me a candy bar, the young folks who drug a cooler full of beverage and a grill to the top of a mountain making hamburgers and hot dogs for thru- hikers (simply amazing), to folks that left caches of water (sometimes Gatoraid) by the side of the trail, to folks who set up grills along the side of a road crossing making everything from breakfasts to grilling burgers. Many times these acts would occur when one’s mood and endurance would be at an all time low. As I often said such encounters would put ‘pep in my step”. In particular I like to thank the Loesche’s (Patty and Richard) who traveled from New York state to Connecticut carrying with them $300.00 that my wife had wired to them (when my debit card had been ‘skimmed’). I did not know this couple (other than meeting briefly with Richard, at a roadside ice cream establishment back in New York. They also assisted my hiking partner and me in resupplying. Their kindness helped to renew my faith in mankind. I am also very appreciative of the many people to followed my journal at http://www.trailjournals.com/journal/20017, especially those who took the time to make comments. Likewise were a host of folks who tracked my progress on Facebook and offered words of encouragement and advice. You will never know how much the comments (Trail Journals and Facebook) meant to me during my hike. I wish I had had (in real time) had the time, energy, and battery life to respond to everyone’s feedback. Please know that your words were and are very special to me. ===> I do need to mention the name of my hiking partner, Death March Dan (this name was given to him by his family because their hikes were often so long/difficult and he simply would march on...there is a grain of truth to their decision to name him this). While Dan may never see this comment, I believe that he was instrumental in helping me accomplish the gaol of making it to Katahdin before October rolled around. Thank you Dan for encouraging and at the same time pushing me.
