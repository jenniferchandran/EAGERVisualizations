TBA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607032,"In 5 weeks and 1 day, I board a plane to Atlanta. Seems like the perfect time to completely rethink my food resupply plan. When I began thinking seriously about this hike a year ago, I began with an ambitious (and ill-advised) plan to dehydrate all my food ahead of time. Why? Because I'm nuts. I realized quickly that not only would I have to run my tiny 5-tray Nabisco nearly constantly for about 4 months to achieve this, but that there is a ton of trial and error involved in food dehydration. In my month and a half of experimenting I made a lot of weird stuff, including but not limited to: dried bananas that became so gummy when you chewed them they were like an industrial strength adhesive, zucchini chips that were less chip and more like a slightly zucchini-tasting piece of paper, and a cup of dried cherry tomatoes that, while delicious, took nearly a day to finish drying. All in all, the most important lesson I learned was what works for a week or two in the woods might not translate well to months. I changed my plan fairly quickly. Instead of prepping everything beforehand, I would buy most things on the trail and my mom (AKA Houston) would send me a few boxes along the way that included hard-to-find things at less than ideal resupply points. I was happy with this...until I say today that Harmony House was having a sale on all their samplers. And that's how I ended up with about 35 cups of various dehydrated vegetables. Hey, for $65, who can blame me? I can. I can blame me.  I had been worried about how I was going to get veggies out on the trail, so I'm calling this a blessing in disguise. My incredible boyfriend offered to help me sort everything into meals, which I have an inkling he'll regret as soon as he sees the almost disturbingly large pile of Ziplocs and boxes. So, if anyone has favorite trail meals that could benefit from an addition of roughage, I'm all ears! ",,View Entry,"Feb 13, Wed",0
TBA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607181,"What better way to celebrate Valentine's Day weekend than driving 8 hours round-trip to spend a night camping? My boyfriend and I left DC at around 9 a.m. with the goal of completing the Virginia Triple Crown over the long weekend. He would probably be the first to tell you that I can be overly optimistic when it comes to weather prediction, and I had spent the week repeating that it wouldn't be below 35F in Roanoke and we would be fiiiiine. Thankfully, he didn't listen to me and brought approximately 7 layers (including 2 down coats) which was 100% the right call. 
After a long drive that involved a stop at Aldi's for olive oil and the subsequent discovery of their $2.50 wine, we parked at the McAfee Knob trailhead. Our itinerary dictated a 10-mile hike Saturday to Tinker Cliffs, a 16-mile slog over North Mountain on Sunday, and another 10-miler from Dragon's Tooth on Monday. I was excited. I was ready. I was a little worried my sleeping pad would leak. The hike up to the Knob was gorgeous. Catawba Valley opened up in front of us and we kept pausing to talk pictures. It was just over 40 degrees and sunny, and all my optimism seemed to be paying off. 
We came to Campbell Shelter just after 4:30, with another 5 miles left to go before reaching Tinker Cliffs. Because we had a late start and the drive took longer than expected, we decided to call it a day and planned on hitching from the Dragon's Tooth parking lot to cut the last 7 miles off our hike. The temperature started to rapidly drop as we set up camp and by the time we were eating dinner, I was shivering violently. 1st lesson learned: bring a fleece in addition to base layer, puffy, and rain jacket. 2nd lesson: don't try to emulsify parmesan on a camp stove. It turns into glue. Delicious glue, but you still don't want to be the kid eating paste.
Sleeping brought its own challenges. Normally, I am a very warm sleeper, so I wasn't concerned with my set-up. My Feathered Friends Egret bag held up wonderfully during the night, but my sleeping pad did, in fact, leak. I have a Nemo Tensor which I cut at home to fit. I am under 5' tall, and just did not need a 76"" sleeping pad. Unfortunately, I didn't perfectly seal the edge, so it slowly leaks over the course of the night. As soon as it bottomed out, I woke up because the temperature in my bag went down substantially. I'll be fixing this by resealing the edge much more carefully and going over the whole thing with a touch of super glue. 
We woke up to hail and freezing rain. Given the issues from the previous night, I reluctantly agreed that the best thing to do was bail. If I had been alone, I probably would have continued out of stubbornness, and this is one of many reasons I am grateful my boyfriend agreed to hike with me. 
McAfee Knob coated in low-lying clouds and icicles was just as breathtaking as the bluebird skies of the day before. While I wish that the weather had held up, I was grateful I got to see two completely different personalities of the trail. If anything, the entire trip made me more excited to get out there. While I have significant backpacking experience, testing new gear always requires some guesswork and trial and error. At the end of the day, I consider this last overnight a success because of what I learned and how well my spirits held up. See you in 4 weeks and 2 days, Amicalola!",,View Entry,"Feb 19, Tue",0
TBA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607995,"My final day of work is this Friday. It has been a bittersweet week, with emotions ranging from anticipation and excitement to very real sadness at leaving. This has been my first ""real"" job, and part of me wishes I was staying. During and after college, I interned at a lot of different places but never felt like a true member of the team. People were kind, and usually decent, but I was always transient and therefore not quite worth getting to know. This job has been entirely different. I know the work I do is valuable, but beyond that I feel like the people I work with consider me valuable. I will miss this place, this work, but most of all the people. If any of you are reading this, thank you. It has been an absolute pleasure. In lighter news (literally), I finally decided to switch out my behemoth of a pot. I have been using an MSR Windburner for a few years, and I am head over heels in love with it. Stable, reliable, makes a mean soup, but unfortunately nearly a pound. It's great for long weekends or even 4/5 day hikes, but for my thru I bit the bullet and bought an MSR Pocket Rocket and Toaks pot (thank you REI dividend, very cool). This will lighten up my pack enough to allow me to bring a camera gifted to me by my boyfriend and remain at the same baseweight. I'll shoot about two rolls of film a week and send them back to him to get developed. I'm really happy he'll be involved like this, and I think he is too. 8 days until I fly to Atlanta. Big dreams, big emotions, bigger hopes that it doesn't rain on my first day. ",,View Entry,"Mar 13, Wed",0
TBA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608587,"I was way too nervous and excited to sleep last night, but thankfully I had to be at the airport by 6:30 for my flight so I didn’t have to restlessly toss and turn for long. My mom is joining me for my first night on the trail, so we left for Georgia together. 
I decided this morning to put my pack into a duffel bag for added security, but the bag I chose is approximately 40 years old and the handle came completely off when I tried to lift. Cut to me, slinging this whole mess over my shoulder and walking through the surprisingly crowded airport. I cannot emphasize enough how ridiculous I looked. 
The flight was uneventful, as was the subsequent drive to an REI to grab a fuel canister and a lighter. These aren’t allowed on planes, so I needed to pick them up on the way to Springer. Trusting Google Maps, I drove while my mom slept until the turn off for the road to the Springer Mountain parking lot. Calling this 10 mile stretch of ruts and potholes a road is actually generous. It took nearly an hour to make it to the parking lot, and I was just thrilled I managed not to do some serious damage to the car. 
Seeing my first white blaze at the top was exhilarating, and I am excited to be back tomorrow. My mom and I got a shuttle from Springer to Amicalola, and I chatted with our driver, Ron. He was extremely knowledgeable and asked questions about my gear and plans. They were all Ron-approved, which makes me feel more prepared. 
I registered at the Amicalola Falls visitor center (hiker 1300!) and after the iconic arch picture, we were on our way! The stairs were not even close to as bad as I was expecting, which has maybe granted me a false sense of confidence. It was an absolutely gorgeous day, bright blue skies and just a hint of crispness. Winter isn’t ready to let go just yet. 
I’m staying at the Amicalola Lodge tonight, which is just lovely. After hitting up the BBQ buffet and organizing my gear for the approach trail tomorrow, I am ready for my last night in a bed. 
Just wanted to say thank you to the folks signing my guest log, I will be reading all your comments! Happy trails!",,View Entry,"Mar 21, Thu",0

The sunrise was pastel and beautiful, the day was bright and blue and just a little cold, and the hiking was rolling and interesting. I really enjoyed the approach trail and the snippets of mountains through the trees. 
My mom and I climbed up to Springer Mountain and took a few photos and sat for a minute. I could not stop smiling. We made our way to the Springer Mountain shelter, as she is headed back to Maryland tomorrow. I’m really going to miss her, she makes me laugh and feel more confident. She’s planning on joining me in Virginia, which is something to look forward to! 
The shelter is much sturdier than I was expecting. I’m used to the lean-tos of the Adirondacks, which are completely open on one side and allow space for maybe half a dozen hikers. Here tonight are myself and my mom, Specter (so named by me for the incredible, rock embedded stick he is carrying), Wolf, Kris, Polar Bear, Katie, Tara and Jonathon.
We spoke for a while with a trail runner for the Georgia ATC, as well as Bedhead, a class of 2018 SOBO hiker. It was great to get some insight into what lies ahead. 
Bedhead also packed in a few dozen beers, which I believe constitutes my first trail magic. Never knew PBR could taste this good. 
It’s 9:15 p.m. and I am ready for sleep. Hiker midnight, indeed.","Amicalola Lodge

TBA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608715,"Last night was cold! It was strange sleeping in a shelter with so many people (most of my hiking had been fairly solitary) and I didn’t get much sleep. I think I’ll probably stick to tenting for the most part, unless it’s pouring buckets. I like the privacy of my little tent. 
My mom and I woke up at around 7:00, and after a quick breakfast watching the sunrise, we headed to the Springer Mountain parking lot. Saying goodbye was hard, but I was excited to be off. The morning was, once again, exquisite. I don’t know how I got lucky enough to have this weather, but I’m not going to question it. I know the rain is coming soon enough. 
The first few miles of the day were low-grade downhill, and flew by. I saw Three Forks, which was lovely and almost jungle-y, and I took a detour to see the Lost Creek Falls. I had an early lunch there, and took a few photos. I’m starting to get the hang of the camera Simon gave me. 
The rest of the way to Hawk Mountain was quick, and I arrived around noon. Because I was there so early, and I felt so good, I decided to press on. I quickly regretted my decision. After the gentle grades of the morning, the afternoon absolutely kicked my butt. A series of quick peaks led to Sassafras Mountain which, at that point in the day, had my legs complaining pretty loudly. 
The old adage “the trail provides” proved true today, however. At the end of the incredibly steep descent, a past thru hiker had set up trail magic with burgers and hot dogs and cold sodas. I’d never had a root beer that good. 
After speaking with her and a few other hikers for a bit, I pressed on to Justus Creek. This was the only water source since just after Hawk Mountain, so I know I needed to get there (I had seriously depleted my stores). A quick tent set up and a change of clothes later, I’m feeling much more myself and look forward to tomorrow. 
Hopefully, I’ve learned my lesson, but I’m pretty sure I’m too stubborn for that. Time for some dinner and maybe a fire! I know I’ll sleep well tonight!","Springer Mountain Shelter

TBA,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608757,"Today was the first day with views! I woke up around 7:30 and was on the trail by 8:30. While this is late for me, I broke trail for the first few miles, as evidenced by the number of spider webs clinging to my legs. I got to Gooch Gap (about 2.5 miles) just as a group was clearing up a huge breakfast trail magic. While I was sorry to have missed it, I got an apple and was on my way. On the climb up Ramrock Mountain, I ran into a fellow named Irish who suggested “Sweet Young Thing” as a trail name. I declined. Near the summit, Matches caught up to me and we hiked together for most of the late morning and early afternoon. He is heavily involved in the environmentalist community in New Hampshire, which is near and dear to my heart. I am headed to law school in the fall with an interest in environmental law, so speaking with him was really interesting.At Suches Gap, a 2017 thru-hiker was giving out orange sodas, so I stopped and ate lunch there. My PB&J technique was met with interest and approval. I emptied a jar of peanut butter and a jar of jam into two ziplocks, cut a small hole in one corner of each, squeeze out whatever amount I want, and then reseal the bags with the smallest size binder clip I could find. So far, it’s been fantastic. The hike up Big Cedar Mountain after lunch was tough but quick, and the views were exceptional. My picture for today was taken at the summit. I knew that Lance Creek was going to fill up quickly because of the predicted rainstorm tomorrow, so I hustled to the campsite. I started feeling a little homesick, but Kris, Tara, Jonathon, and Katie showed up a little after I arrived and I felt much better. We’ve all made a pact to wake up at 6:00 to break camp and make the hike to Neel Gap because of the thunderstorm predicted for tomorrow. I am not looking forward to going down Blood Mountain in the wet. Something tells me I’ll end up leaving a little of my own blood on the trail. Looking forward to resupply, a pizza, and picking up a few things at Mountain Crossings tomorrow!","Justus Creek
