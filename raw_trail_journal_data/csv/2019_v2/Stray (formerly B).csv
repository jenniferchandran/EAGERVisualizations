Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605609,"Been living a pretty chaotic life up to this point, working a wilderness program in VA every other month where I am out in the woods for 22 days at a time. In between shifts, I come back to NC to deliver sandwiches on a bike for Jimmy John's and stealth camp, or occasionally house sit.
Decided recently to settle down for the first time in 8 months, doubled up on my job and actually started paying rent. The place I was living at was as close to home as I guess it will ever get, but life was getting overwhelming for people in the house, and I was asked to leave.
But whenever doors shut, it's because opportunities open, and Jimmy John's just happened to be closed til Tuesday. So I jumped on the trail (MST) to process my life and how I fit in it, along with trying bits of gear I picked up for the AT. 
I packed up my Granite Gear Virga 2, and dropped my bike at my storage unit, and took the local bus as close as I could to the MST. Had to hike on the side of the road for a mile or so, but it felt so good to get in cadence.
There were people driving past and whatnot, so I didn't let my emotional guard down til I was in the woods.
So here I am processing all this, got that self talk going on, trying to defeat me. This is my life, don't even try to settle down, because I will never be able to. Nobody really loves anybody, and especially not me.
Blah blah blah. Poor me talk, you know? It happens.  It was already getting dark when I started hiking and the night with a full moon (which makes me crazy anyway?), and the light pollution, made walking in the woods dreamlike. By this time I embraced the fact that I was just terribly sad, and stopped being hard on myself, and began to listen for guidance. I'd been talking to God the whole time. I hadn't ate all day so I also decided to fast. One of the best ways to boost spiritual perspective.
After an hour or so I found a cozy spot near the creek and set up my hammock. As soon as I got the fly up it started raining on me. God is good.",,MST between Bent Creek and Folk Arts Center,"Nov 23, Fri",5
Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605610,"I slept for like 12-13 hours last night. I feel really hollow today.
Sitting under the interstate in a field in the sun, drying gear and being encouraged. I can't help but wish I was already on the AT.
Hiking today there were times I was really in the moment, others when I was just ruminating on this and that. Had a long talk with a guy named Mel Skyles, who was doing solo volunteer work on the MST, and he shared some of his AT thru-hike experiences with me. His love for the trails actually developed from that hike. Told me to volunteer if I ever had the time, and I plan to.
Some gear things I have been thinking about. Trekking poles? Maybe for the cold section? If I get my pack light like it is now, they almost feel useless. I don't use them to pitch a tent. Arc'teryx beta pants and jacket overkill? I love the jacket. Makes a great VBL for added warmth, but I hardly use the pants, even in the rain. Maybe for the Smokies and snow? Gotta get insoles. These Astrals have been so many miles over this year I've had them.  My shoes need a new soul. I think the fasting is making me loopy. Backpack strap pocket to put a water bottle in the front, easy access? Should I even bring a GoPro? 
All down items need drybags! I'm gonna cut three panels off my zlite right now to try out the difference.",,MST Rattlesnake Lodge,"Nov 24, Sat",15
Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605611,"Starting to detox pretty good, muscles aren't bouncing back as fast. Yoga feels really good, life feels really good. So quiet. Mountain water has everything I need, it's so nourishing. I'm so hungry I can taste the metals and soil bacteria in the water. Leaving rattlesnake I began seeing alot of people coming from Craggy Wilderness Area. It's Sunday, and it's beautiful. I forget how beautiful this part of the hike is. Tons of elevation gain, and my nerves are trembling on low voltage, and my heart is pumping battery acid, but it feels so purifying. Once you crest the top there are several overlooks that are pretty spectacular.
The sign says 3.7 miles to the tower, I'm already shot, but I'm fixated on the exploration. 
There are so many people on this trail. I realized later that most people only go as far as Hawks Bill Rock and then turn around.
I kept going, and I saw the signs of traffic became non existent. The leaves we're in perfect order and we're not shuffled around at all. I started having the suspicion that there was no tower, even though it was on the map. Eventually I passed by a circa '68 Ford truck half buried in the bank and after another glance at the map, realized I was on Appalachian Rd. I also passed an old spring box.
Around every corner and at the top of every hill I became less and less certain there was anything anywhere. Just when I was about to give up hope and started seeing animal and bear poop everywhere I came around the bend to where the tower used to be.
I'm so tired at this point my muscles we're locking up just sitting around. Good 360° view, but had to go to ground.",,MST Little Snowball Fire Tower,"Nov 25, Sun",15
Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605878,"Got an email saying my direct link was good to go, so I dropped by to visit this journal.I haven't been hiking but I ran three miles today averaging 7.5 minutes miles which felt good. Mainly letting out some frustration. Been selling my stuff off still, and dealing with people is just nerve wracking.Woke up to my bike stolen, so I went about the steps to recover it and sure enough someone tried to pawn it at the local bike shop and they gave me a call. The person had taken off my luggage rack and bike pump to make it look different I guess but I got the bike back. I stayed in good spirits despite everything. Actually ended up being one of the best days in awhile. Helped a friend move some furniture, went to a meeting, and saw a friend from the past who is trying to get his life together which lifted my spirits a lot. My first guest log entry was from someone called 12 step, and that person just stated that my journal was like a train wreck. I understand that there is the possibility that I might not make my journey. I understand that I will be better off pushing my date back. I will make a lot of mistakes. I've made more mistakes than I care to admit. This is just a goal. I like to have long term goals, and some of them seem impossible. But I'd rather work a job everyday towards a goal, than to be mindlessly rambling through motions.The last unbelievable goal I had was kayaking the Green River Narrows race in Saluda, NC. That was last year's goal. It's a race through class V whitewater, check it out! I wasn't able to drive or train for that as well as I would have liked, but thanks to my friends and family I raced and completed it. The Appalachian Trail will be very much the same. I feel unprepared... there are things that I can't prepare for, but with faith and help of others I can do anything.I realize that people like that, that attack others are just trying to make themselves feel better. Read this journal for whatever reason you have, but I think it's essential to lift people up rather than use other people to lift us up.Might be a bit before I check back in, just really focused on getting everything ready. There are so many loose ends to tie up before embarking on this thing!",,View Entry,"Dec 13, Thu",0
Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605958,"Got a last few items coming and should be able to get a pack weight together. Signed up with ATC today. Wish I knew who the other person was that was signed up for February 19th. 
Gonna have a winter set up, which will be heavier, then switching to spring summer gear. Thinking after Smokies. Gonna try waterproof socks with my shoes because I hate boots. Plus every pound on the feet is five on the back. Got Chainsen microspikes, and looking forward to trying them out. 
Also just got my 20° Enlightened Equipment Enigma, looking for a cold snap to test it's limits, also to see how it does in my hammock. I know I'll like the sewn footbox better than the Revelation drawstring closure.
I think my next entry will be my winter base weight. Until then.",,View Entry,"Dec 18, Tue",0
Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606008,"Pretty much my last week to dial in my pack so it's 3am and I just got to a stopping point on figuring out my winter set up.
I just want to say that I love tyvek. Especially since it's free. My friend has a huge roll of it and I just cut a huge piece down to size. It's about an ounce heavier than my last piece that I used for a long time. I made it a bit wider so my gear will fit better with me when I make my canoe/bathtub.
I downsized my phone to an iPhone 6s, and even with the LifeProof case is about an ounce lighter than zmax pro, and way smaller.
Anyway, I cut weight in alot of places, but have a very warm, safe setup in my opinion.  Still some things put together, my bear bag kit, and get my GoPro from a friend tomorrow.
Anyway, it's a really good feeling being a little more ready to roll. Here's my winter set up if you wanna check it out!

I am glad I chose Trailjournals as my documentation site for this journey. I got rid of my Instagram about six months ago, I never used it anyway. I told myself when I downsized all my stuff I would get rid of Facebook. That time has come. What I like about this site, is people come here just for journaling, or to read journals. None of the other social media mess.
Had a pretty cool experience the other day. Was walking down the main street here in town, amazed at all the trash as usual, when I saw an unopened pack of moleskin leaning up against a sign. I picked it up and laughed out loud. I wasn't really gonna mess with KT tape or anything. But the sign read WATCH YOUR STEP. It was a missing piece of my gear after all.
God is very subtle sometimes, and I'm grateful to be aware enough to notice.
Also have this 1.5mm Spectra cord for a bear hang and whatever else. Got my shorter Apple charger. Now to be present as possible. This upcoming year is going to be quite the year and looking forward to it.",,View Entry,"Dec 31, Mon",0
Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606571,"Everything is getting real.
Basically to sum it up, my current situation is I was surprised with a stay at the lodge on the 17th of February. So I will definitely be in Georgia before four o’clock on Sunday. From there I will say goodbye to my family and hike to Springer, probably after buffet breakfast. That will be Monday. Tuesday February 19th I will officially be stepping foot towards Maine. 
I have Skyped with a farm that participates with World Wide Organization of Organic Farmers, and will be processing the trip there should I summit Katahdin. The farm is just outside Gorham, Maine. 
Other than that I have no idea what’s going to happen, and need to let my life flow. Been doing a lot of yoga and reading John Muir’s Travels in Alaska. Canceled all my memberships and now will be paying a phone bill and dental insurance.
I feel kind of like the cops in Lethal Weapon that start wearing a bullet proof vest before retirement, I’d hate for anything to happen so close to date.",,View Entry,"Jan 24, Thu",0
Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606702,"Three more sundays and I’ll be in Georgia. 
I may have three more days left of work left before I’m completely off schedule at work. I’m looking forward to moving out of the shelter here and spending time in Hendersonville with my family and I’ll also be able to try out gear. I have a brand new Enigma that I haven’t even used. Nothing makes me more anxious than winging it with gear that I am not familiar with!
I was recently wrecked by a stomach bug, and then a cold. If I had been on trail I wonder what it would have been like? I was freezing and too weak to move. 
I wore my basic hiking setup to work today because I thought it was going to be colder than it was, it got to high thirties with wind and I was toasty, and that’s without my puffy so I’m pretty confident in my layering. 
Been going through the awol guide again and highlighting potential resupplies and points of interest. Definitely going to get a mail drop at Fontana Dam. 
One bad thing I found out is my phone dies pretty fast when it starts to get cold so journaling on here may be difficult. I included my potential weight for my summer setup in my gear. I’m really looking forward to seeing what I keep and what I add by the end.",,View Entry,"Jan 29, Tue",0
Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606827,"Two Sundays til GA!
Where I’m staying right now is cheapest in all of Asheville, only ten dollars a day. Downtown so it’s easy to get to work (I don’t drive), and able to save as much money as possible. Only downfalls are living with a bunch of other people and curfew and limited storage.
This weekend I got to visit my mom and stepdad, and they weren’t really surprised to find me sleeping outside the next morning. First night got down to 20 degrees and I was just fine. Granted no wind or precipitation.
I sleep so well outside, the last winter I actually lived in a house but slept in a hammock in the carport except around New Years when it was sub zero. Still had the heat at like 62 because it dries me out when trying to heat up to higher numbers.
Got another burst of good weather and unfortunately some of the plants are showing buds. Breaking in my second set of shoes while hiking around Bent Creek. There is a azalea garden where they have signs showing what all the local trees and plants’ names are. All my life I’ve gotten rhododendrons and mountain laurel mixed up. Now I won’t forget. Mountain laurel has smaller leaves and is called by spoonwood and calico bush, but I find it’s latin name beautiful. Kalmia Latifolia. And the rhododendron or great rhododendron and rosebay rhododendron goes by Rhododendron Maximum. Obviously it has the big leaves and is larger. Also the leaves of this tree set in a creek just right creates a wonderful spout for filling up water bottles. Which is convenient since they are often found close by water.I’m having a get together Saturday of people that wanna hang out before I leave, and it’s really warming to see so many people say they’ll be there. Also appreciate all the guest signatures as well! I appreciate feedback that’s constructive.",,View Entry,"Feb 03, Sun",0
Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606924,"Final week of any last prep.There are a few things to consider when making a resupply box, especially balling on a budget. 1. Is it worth the postage?  Flat rate boxes are 15-20$; also, unless it's a post office, some places charge a small holding fee. So most times it's cheaper to find a way to a local store and make due with what they have. 2. Will I even be craving the food I send myself months later?! This stuff is all appealing now but after a extensive hike I always start to crave weird things. 3. Timing. Post office hours are limited so will I be willing to wait for it to open if I miss hours? I may be on a roll and not needing to re-up quite yet and the hike into town is a waste of time.My exceptions.1.1  Local store enabled me to save so much money on quality and mostly organic food, that postage is no problem. 1.2 farther up north, and places like before 100 miles of wilderness prices are high, and supplies are limited. 1.3 Places like Fontana Dam (entrance to Smokies) it's a bit harder to resupply.2.1 quality organic food (just some slightly out of date) enough said.3.1 send packages to hostels, who charge sometimes, but don't have strict hours. They usually appreciate a heads up.The weeks are flying by. I've had so many great experiences, and the wholesome network of people in my life have been so supportive, I can leave with knowledge of the solid foundation here at home.The only set back so far was taxes, I didn't account for the taxes I would owe doing wilderness therapy. I'll know for next time. I'm leaving Asheville today, and will spend my last week in Hendersonville, visiting my family, testing gear, and organizing for possible circumstances. Can't believe this journey is finally here after prepping for ten months!",,View Entry,"Feb 10, Sun",0
Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607062,"Excellent forecast for Georgia this coming week. Rain, showers, rain, and thunderstorms. At least there will be showers.Reading others having started and getting stoked reading their journals. Got two food boxes that can be sent at any time ready. In the picture I added some tie outs to enable me to use my ground tarp for other things, like a bivy, and vapor barrier under quilt. Easy to hang to dry as well or use it for additional coverage.I slept outside in my summer quilt for the first time and the pad straps worked, definitely will use a liner to avoid drafts for when I switch hips, which I do every three hours or so. Otherwise not much has changed, God has encouraged me through unbelievable circumstances and through trials and people. Once I get on the trail I will try to write as much as possible. Used iPhone 6s so the battery is iffy. Takes forever to charge and when it hits 12% that means it’s dead. Cold weather makes it die incredibly fast as well. So this may be interesting. Anyway basically times up because nephews are coming up this weekend and the shipping off on Sunday!

I don’t like calling it that because the trail is a kind of real world all it’s own.Weighed my pack, which was a whopping 36 pounds. I added 24oz of salami, a book (A Severe Mercy), pill bottle of glutamine powder, also one of my water bottles was full, but my Anker power bank I left on the charger.

I’m not sure how to make a direct link for Instagram but my username is spangeforchange.I forgot some of my added weight. I picked up an actual journal and pen because I love documenting that way and I can write down trees and other wildlife I can further research when I make it to a library. I’m obsessed with Latin names because I think they are specific and usually beautiful. Also makes the thing really stick out, like magnolias for instance. Magnolia Grandiflora. So much more fitting. I’m dropping my book after scanning through it it’s very informative but I didn’t want the distraction from self-reflection, at least at the beginning.God made this day clear, when it was previously supposed to be raining. I will rejoice and be glad in it.",,View Entry,"Feb 18, Mon",0
Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607150,"I’m so glad I hiked the arches up the falls. Partly because it’s a beautiful falls, but I loved that my mom and stepdad joined me up to the fourth tier. Mom told me to be present in all my steps or something to that nature, and both said I love you and and I felt it. I was overwhelmed by love and really had a joyful cry the rest of the way up the steps.
The GoPro is turning out to be a good asset. I love the backpack but may have to pad the hip belt somehow. Water is bountiful with all the rain, and after meeting with halo for a mile or so spent the rest of my hike solo in joyful reflection.
The woods are very dormant except for holly (ilex opaca), white pine (pinus strobus), and very seldom hemlock or (tsuga canadensis) bursting forth with their greens  in the midst of grey. There is the constant hollow whooshing of the wind as it’s always restlessly combing the treetops, and the air smells of soil and ice. There are remnants here and there of a past fire poking up through the leaves and the mountains are varying shades of very pretty blues as they stretch off in the horizon. 
Me and nick now “legs” arrived and started a fire as everyone piled in at their own times. I finally settled for sleeping in the shelter an ironically it’s a super moon which was the same as my first entry.
I kept my electronics in my foot box as o hit the sack at 1800 and am pleased with a 94% battery this far in writing. It’s 2235 and the thought crossed my mind to hike because I’m wide awake but I’ll try to go back to sleep.","Amicalola arches
",Springer shelter,"Feb 18, Mon",0.20
Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607240,"I really enjoyed this day. Started off the morning with hail, which is a sign of a storm brewing. The rain is carried into the stratosphere by an unstable atmosphere over and over freezing and freezing again til it’s too heavy to stay anymore. Also it takes longer to make you wet which I like. I am absolutely satisfied with my rain gear and setup. For those fretting about footwear like I did, throw on a pair of darn tough socks and sneakers and get hiking! They to warm up fast. It’s really tough to put them on in the morning though.Long creek is a beautiful section of trail and crosses the Benton McKaye (is that spelled right?) Trail many times. It’s blazed the same as the AT so take caution at intersections. The creek can be heard chuckling from a distance and there are two big unnamed falls before Lin creek falls. Durable path to bottom of false one, and durable path to top of false two, which is actually my favorite. Then there is a sign that someone etched 170 steps into that points the way to long creek falls, and it was a very accurate amount.A lot of poplar and oak very well built growing at healthy distances from each other. I imagine this area was cross-cut sustainably in the past. Saturated logs are ripe for the birds to pick through for food and leave big piles of mulch behind. I love how nature destroys itself by providing for others.Lightning struck as I left hawk shelter and there was no other shelter for 7 miles so I had to commit. The flashes were followed by thunder after a slow seven seconds in which I started to think I was seeing things. Counting thunder is not actually a way to rationalize if you are safe. One strike can be ten miles away and the storm itself be right on top of you. In my head I thought gooch shelter would be empty but I actually claimed the last available bed in the shelter. Some things I learned on arrival to camp is to fill water, use the bathroom, and eat and stow bear bags in bear box before switching to dry gear. It’s so hard putting that stuff back on when I could hardly move!","Springer shelter
",Gooch shelter ,"Feb 19, Tue",15.50
Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607241,"Trail magic coming out of gooch gap. Fresh Ground was just starting up. I just warmed my thumbs over the fire and was good to go again. I cold soak my breakfast at night. It’s granola, oatmeal, chocolate peanut butter, hemp oil, cod liver oil, and a mystery protein powder that has all kinds of stuff including desiccated coconut and chia seeds. I’ve never been hungry in the morning but I’m always grateful I ate. One downside to cold soaking is the drop in core temperature so I put on wet socks gloves and rain gear, then eat cold breakfast and cold water, and drape my bag over me and do tiny leg lifts and let my body shake to warm up. When I’m warm, then I boogie. My internal furnace is pumping and I stay warm!
A lot of people quitting or just not enjoying themselves. Some due to gear, but mostly due to attitude. I absolutely love the challenge. One thing that helps me hike distance is to really involve my hips. I have tight hips and If I don’t use them my knees take all the impact. So I start swinging my hips like a runway model, throw in a little flair with my trekking poles, and basically I’m dancing at that point. Hard to be in a bad mood when dancing. Also I don’t have the “real world” plugged into my ear holes. So I embrace the pitter patter of rain, the occasional bird, and creeks bursting forth from the rocks, making the purest white noise aside from the ocean or wind.
As far as gear, people tend to pack their fears. And that means going too light as well. My 0 degree bag and rain gear are heavy and worth it. Most of the people getting off trail are wet and cold. Also Be Bold, Start Cold! In forty degree rain I have a thin base layer beneath my rain gear. As I hike I get just to the warm mark but never sweat. Sweat is as bad as rain. On some of these climbs I start to feel sweat and I slow down or open the pit zips early.
Sadly all the views today are just a window of grey. Birds are flying only a foot or so off the ground which is another indication of foul weather.

The flashes of lightning were way off in the distance and couldn’t even be heard anymore. The fog was so thick I could only use infrared at lowest setting, so basically walking by moonlight which I was not lacking. The only part I started to get a little fearful was as I got closer to the summit of blood mountain in which the rocks got bigger and mountain laurel thicker, I imagined the creatures did too. When I came upon the stone structure I utilized having service for the first time and a flash rain came through. By the very beginning of daylight I began my descent to neel’s gap. I’m extremely grateful to have chose the shoes I did because in some places it was so steep and wet on sheer granite, a fall could be devastating. But these shoes made me feel as confident as a lizard. Walking down the creek of a trail, I noticed more vines and a red tailed hawk.Neel’s gap was still a ghost town as I passed through and headed up one of many ascents this day. Fortunately the grey curtain was pulled aside and I had lunch with a great view and had my rain jacket off more than on.When I saw low gap shelter I knew i was staying there. It was in a hot pocket by a stream. I set my stuff down and went to wash the dirt out of my clothes and pores.

Blue mountain shelter was my midpoint of reference and I missed it so I thought tray mountain was blue mountain. My internal gps is all kinds of messed up. So when I left tray mountain for tray mountain (hang with my severe confusion) I was very frustrated that the terrain did not match up with my guide. I was climbing mountains when it said downhill. Eventually self doubt creeped in and I actually thought I was hiking the wrong way it got so bad. I prayed to God and I’m not kidding, peace came over me, even if I was backtracking it did not matter. Then I came across deep gap shelter and was bewildered! I laughed and laughed. The kind of laugh that was meant to be tears coming out a better way.Stranger yet I had a dream and was visiting a friend and then they kept having more and more company over and all the chatter and problems became overwhelming and I was pushed to the street by the incoming horde of people. My friend asked me what’s wrong and I said I just wished I was on the trail and woke up in the shelter to the creek and rain, and the noises human bears make when they hibernate ten hours; happy to be out of that mad house. Beauty section. I love the strips of green mossy sections like a scar down the mountainside where a creek is bringing life to the steady orange the oak (Quercus alba) trees leave as a thick home for the critters after fall. Creeks are gushing and creating tiny waterfalls down the mountain side. One after another. I haven’t carried water in days. There’s water running down the trail in many places.Special thanks to all volunteers and ATC for all you’re hard work. There are many fresh cut trees that would have been very hard to route around.

Add one from yesterday thanks Randy for a free and heartfelt lift back to Dicks Creek. Hope you tackle the Georgia section!
Hello North Carolina! It’s reply—“welcome, enjoy the climb, my first shelter sign says SHEETER, 90% of my winter blow downs are still there, oh and you have to hang your food while staying in me!”
Bly gap was tough, but first great view in several days. Standing Indian takes the prize. As you near it’s crown, birch trees dominate the area, some of its young still with fall leaves as if God hasn’t quite pulled the trigger on winter yet. The mountain itself is unmistakable as you round the corner, it stands chief, and I’m glad for the switchbacks that enable you to grind up it. At the summit you come into a small clearing of grass kept golf worthy by the local lawn mowers, or Wild Field Munchers which is the Australian name for deer. The view consists of deep deep valleys and other sleepy mountains with many wrinkles and folds. In the distance is Hiawassee and it’s lake.
When I think of Standing Indian I think of John Muir. He tells a tale of how the pastor he traveled with would use a story of an Indian chief to help the Indians relate to why Jesus did what he did. There were two warring tribes and one chief stood up and said he was sick of all the fighting and wanted a truce. The other chief would only agree if there was a sacrifice of six or so men to make the damage even. (Very important in Indian culture) so the chief replied “what about me? I’m worth that many and more to you. They agreed and he stood there as he was shot down for his men. That’s what I thought of.
The rest of the hike was navigating blow downs. Greeting other hikers. Found two others at the shelter that hike similarly and share same values. We ate dinner, I led a sloppy but enjoyable yoga class, we hung out first bear hang together (old school method) and looked at stars and planned our day tomorrow which looks like 15 miles with a drop in Franklin for their resupply.","Plum orchard shelter

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607387,"It’s crazy what the processing brain comes up with when sleeping or walking. Woke up to doesn’t remind me by audioslave. Had to look up the band because I didn’t know. I’m also remembering things I’ve forgotten, as if I’m peeling away the onion that is my barriers to self. Sometimes happy memories, and some are terrible. I got in one of these zones first thing in my walk and I started remembering the terrible. I just became aware of it and told that hurt person inside me that the war was over and I was ok, everything is ok. After a joyful crying spell I was sponged of the darkness and the day was brought into full glory. I was fully present nothing holding me back from being elated, I was ok with being vulnerable to happiness which I know is fleeting.
The trail was hard and cold, and definitely made a difference on my feet. There was frost spiking out of the ground like fur everywhere I looked. I absolutely love starting out early in the morning. The eastern sun is hitting the dead Rhododendron tunnels causing cool shadows.
As you come to Albert Mountain there’s no mistaking it because there is a fire tower jutting from the tree line. I was not bold enough for this hike and shed clothes twice, one of those times being the climb to the tower. It’s walking straight up rocks, and I found that tiny steps win over knee high ones.
At the tower I attained signal for a brief period as I watched my battery life fall a percent every five seconds. Luckily I’m perfectly content without my phone for days at a time.
After a full 15 mile day, we landed in winding stair gap, where we scored a ride with a day hiker to Franklin. Asa, or mad dash, needed a new pair of shoes bad. The toe box was becoming completely separated. The shoe guy made me real self conscious about my choice of shoe because it’s not the norm. He did guess that I was an avid kayaker. Then I got some hot sauce,and bacon bits to put in my half full jar of mayo, two apples, an avocado, and some garlic and a lb of extra sharp white cheddar. 
Back at winding stair we had a mile hike in the dark to our campsite. We had a feast where I melted the cheese on my tortilla with a stick and added all things weird to it. Bear hang was not successful at first because everyone had heavier bags and my line broke when bags were 20 feet up in the air. My bear bag split and I had to repair it but their stuff was fine.

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607389,"Well. Hiking is like a relationship, find a way to love all it has to give, good and bad. 
This morning I was challenged with getting our bear bags down, because I didn’t want to wake the others. I set off around 0730 which is later than usual. After wayah gap it was a steady incline that went on and on. Really straight lines too, so you could constantly be reminded of how far you have left. Then you round the corner and you got another stretch!
I forgot about siler bald. I almost didn’t go up it because .2 miles off trail and steep. I didn’t know when I’d have another chance so I took it and glad I did. I guess it’s a sneak peek of what max patch and such will look like. 360 views that go on and on in this crisp morning air. I started with sun salutation and did yoga.
Another beautiful area is the stone tower of wayah bald. Looking north from there you just have to assume Clingmans Dome is there, it is so far away. Looking back at Albert Mountain is encouraging though.
I opened up my bear bags to have lunch and it was as though a bomb went off. My avocado was squished, the top busted off my hot sauce and mayo, (which was just swollen pieces of bacon at this point) and protein powder was everywhere. I did a lot of consolidation and eating because I wanted to take advantage of the trash cans which are rare.
After that I was hiking and all of a sudden there was a Hansel and Gretel line of m&ms. I realized later that they were probably used to bait a deer, but I ate them, and eagerly hiked to find every next prize. The things I do for Leave No Trace.
I was more tired than usual today and the last part of the hike was long. I heard a few birds chime out a few notes and go back to sleep. The young birches grew in armies through this area all hanging on to their leaves, which made pretty sounds as the wind sifted through. The black birch is Betula Lenta and if you peel the bark of its spring growth you will find it taste like spearmint. Some people say root beer. 
Currently I’m 100 yards north of the shelter on a rock with a beautiful view. There are campsites up here and my hammock is hung again. I slept GOOD last night. My comrades have hung back because new shoes can be hard to do miles in. I’m up here with Maddie and billy goat is at the shelter talking to himself or on the phone very loudly. Gonna strike up a small fire and I’m not even doing dinner since my lunch was so big. 
Two or three days I’ll be at the Fontana Hilton. It’s a shelter but it has a shower and wi fi. I may take a break there and get caught up loading and describing my photos on Instagram.","Moore’s creek camp
",Cold spring shelter ,"Feb 26, Tue",15
Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607422,"As soon as I used my water to put the fire out last night and lay down it started to rain. It was a pretty steady drizzle all night. The ridge was exposed to wind so my thermarest xlite just didn’t quite cut it. I grabbed my section of zlite and stuffed it under my xlite to create a wall to put my back against which is where the cold spots were forming because the down was being pressed between my back and hammock, losing loft, thus insulative properties. Afterward I slept soundly. 
This morning was a challenge packing under my rain fly. What’s nice is the hammock provides a good place to sit. 
I realized two things that were missing from my diet yesterday. Coffee and turmeric. Turmeric has anti inflammatory properties and the active ingredient curcumin is more readily available when eaten with pepper. It really lubricates the joints, but you have to get past the taste, and it tends to stain teeth. My breakfast was the aforementioned and protein powder. Yes mixed together. With hemp and cod liver oil. It’s better than it sounds. I drink coffee after to rinse my cup.
On the trail, Maddie and I continue conversation that began at the fire. At first she kept a distance and after about an hour seemed to drop her guard and came to warm herself. We talk about nutrition and plants. Today on the trail, we reminisce on the big grey curtain that has surrounded us once again. 
The trail is still beautiful. John Muir constantly uses the word noble. It fits as well. After we passed wesser bald tower the fog finally lifted and woodpeckers and other birds could be heard rejoicing. The scenery was much the same at first but after a while the fire damage was the worst yet. Black bulbs was all that was left of rhododendrons, and there was only a thin carpet of leaves. Most trees had scorching, and a lot were dead. It reminds me of badlands from Lion King. There is a lot of ridge walking and to the left and right are great descents. As the trail headed down to meet US 19&74 the path is steep and a slip could be catastrophic. In some places a fall wouldn’t even allow for a timely rescue. Needless to say we both took our time and watched out for one another. There are many trees to overcome in this area as well.
Leaving the charred areas to the parts that were untouched is obvious, because the thick bed of years’ worth of leaves has a strong musky aroma. As you get even lower it switches from oaks to pine, and I decided I loved both the aromas they produced. One new species I saw on the ridge was butterfly bushes. Mandi says the scientific name is budlia. I only recognize it because my mom has great big ones in her driveway. It looks really out of place up there, I imagine it would have never grown had the trees not burned up.
At Nantahala Outdoor Center we printed off our backwoods permits to enter the smokies. I was also approached by the gear rep about my Astrals, except this guy was not skeptical, he was excited and curious. He wanted to take my picture to send to Astral because he knows the owner and thinks he’d be stoked I’m doing the trail in their non hike shoe. 
All these years I came to NOC, I never noticed the bridge was part of the AT. We crossed it and walked down the tracks to an island off property (suggested by employees) and set up camp early. Maddie’s heel blisters are the size of my pinky. Plus, I liked the idea of getting in the water, and I did, along with cleaning a few articles of clothing. I’m really trying to go at Godspeed, which is as life allows. Not of my own volition.","Cold spring shelter

It has been a nice drizzle though, and only really rained up in the cloud that sat on Cheoah Bald. Basically today was the mirror of yesterday’s descent to the Nantahala. However, fire doesn’t seem to have broached the river to this side. Also, after Cheoah Bald, the trail is very overgrown and there are parts where you have to press through the blowdowns and foliage. Water sources are sparse, but the trail did provide a half a jar of peanut butter. Also found a very worn five dollar bill and two worn singles on the rocks surrounding campsite. Called Craig coming out of the gap to try out my first hostel so far. I am far from disappointed. Lodging is twenty per person, and it is nice and organized. Arrived at a tiny cabin with bunk beds. There is everything needed and wanted. Wi fi, tv, towels, clean clothes, fridge, microwave, hot shower, and even linens and extra pillows and blankets. Very professional. Dropping off laundry, we are greeted with a ferociously friendly pair of dogs. There are actually three, but the golden is shy. My favorite is the lab and she is vibrant and fun-loving. There is a cat peering on from the safety of the stairwell. I’m really glad that this was my first hostel experience. Craig says “not as hostile as some!” And laughs. So we talked how it should be a haven instead. I’ll be really ready for the negative degrees in the smokies next week. Hopefully we can make it to the Fontana Hilton tomorrow.

Definitely regretted eating half a stick of cookie dough, and three quarters of a box of chocolate Frosted Flakes. The trail was lacking water sources except the one from above, and that was no big deal. The ground however was saturated, and footing was treacherous. There were times I skid for a yard before I found grip, and came the closest to completely falling yet. Reiterate on the haven experience, I forgot to say it was cabin in the woods. There was fresh coffee and the slow start was heathy for morale. I still could not help but be relieved when I hit the woods.A stand alone holly tree reminded me how little green was in this area. The trees were almost all completely deciduous. Cat briar, common green briar or smilax rotundifolia really grew well here and made the most presence as greenery.There were different whites of fogs throughout the day. Some was milky and low, some grey and wet and all encompassing. A lot of times it was like walking through sleepy hollow.Jacobs ladder was the most strenuous part of the trail today, and from stecoah gap it’s pretty immediate. It’s basically what the AT would look like all the time if there was never switchbacks. I first noticed the smell of the lake, and then I heard the frogs. Then I could finally see it. I was close at last.I was waiting for Maddie when a man in a black truck waved on his way going by. I was just standing there eating peanut butter but I knew for some reason he would be providing magic. He did, copious amounts of it. I just needed to pick up a package from Fontana Lodge, but Maddie needed resupply and the general store was not open yet. He drove me to the lodge and took both of us 20 miles to robinsville. Maddie decided to give her body a little more time to heal and stayed, and I had a wonderful time talking to Butter on the way back. Thruhiker south bound 2015, he could not say it enough, the experience of the trail was irreplaceable and his hope for us is that we experience the same. His pale blue eyes and ear to ear grin reminds me of someone but I could not put my finger on it. We laughed about stocks and corporate tax cuts and the trickle down theory being horse doo. Ultimately we laughed at capitalism and greed, kindred spirits knowing full well that pursuit of happiness is really so simple. One does not need a ton of money to be rich, and Butter was rich, and you could see it beaming from his face and his eagerness to share dividends of that wealth! He offered to drive me to the shelter, skipping or saving a mile of the trail for later or in the morning. I just couldn’t skip it, and he understood completely and we laughed at that too. He was the second person that evening that was really hard to say bye to.Miracles are everywhere. God is mysterious and downright obvious. I had my mom send a package to Fontana. She apologized because she sent it to the lodge on accident instead of the PO. Turns out, I would have had to wait until Monday had she done it the other way. What a blessing.There is so much more to say but I just want to end with this. I have fear for the trail and the onslaught of people trying to traverse it. Today marks the beginning of the bubble. It’s the ignorant people I am concerned about or those who don’t actually love the woods and want to party. I’ll go more depth into Leave No Trace, but I leave you with this thought. Learn the principles of LNT. Practice them. Not just in the woods, but at home, at work. Make them a lifestyle. You’ll be surprised at how the world will respect you back.

The sleeping bag goes on the bottom and then two bear bags above which allows me to put most of the weight on my hips. All other clothes and such gets packed in the front spaces with my diddy bag with certain day items that aren’t waterproof. All waterproof items hang out on the exterior. Rain clothes are secured to the sides when not raining, and my rain fly, zlite, and xlite is rolled up in my tyvek and secured to the top providing additional water protection from the top of my pack. Everything lives in a contractor bag inside and I do not use a pack liner.Today I think I was pushing my original weight again of around 36 pounds but don’t tell Granite Gear I said that. My packs not really meant for more than 30 for warranty reasons.Fontana Hilton to Fontana dam and even to the smokies trailhead is road walking which is unnatural. The dam is quite incredible, and makes the concrete walk worth it. My great grandfather Roy Corn helped build it, which is a fun fact. Smokies was, well, smoky. The usual pale fog, but not wet. The climb to mollies ridge is not for faint of heart, especially after the Exterior Decorator recently pruned his mountain top gardens. I saw fresh boar tracks, old human tracks, and unsettling dog tracks. Normally that wouldn’t bother me but pets aren’t allowed in National Forests, so it’s either someone breaking the rules, wild dog, or Kevin Costner dancing with wolves again.After awhile I finally broke through the clouds and the old men of the mountains were covered in their wooly blanket. Despite the grind to higher elevations the sun being on my body made the chill nonexistent. I missed the fire tower, but I was very thoughtful today and did not notice as much as usual and the miles flew by. Nutritional Yeast makes my pee look like I’m dehydrated but I know better. It’s just packed with vitamins and I expel what my body doesn’t use.I met a ridge runner today, and the first thing he said is “hi I’m David though I’ll probably never see you again!” I said you never know, I may be a ridge runner too someday. Then, we find out he lives in Asheville as well, small world. Mollies ridge to Spence shelter is actually open to horseback which is one of the few, if not the only part of the AT that allows riders. When I showed at the shelter it’s inhabitants were hunters drinking and listening to the ball game. Their only criteria for me to stay is that I not be a Kentucky fan. They already cut up a ton of wood and lit the fire just now. The nice things about the smokies shelters is the have fireplaces.

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607663,"So it was coyotes. The sound is wild. They were celebrating or frustrated, hard to tell. Rough night. Hunters drank deep into the night and their bottles. It wasn’t the loud talk that caused me to take my bed outside, it was the smoke from the fire. Only 75 percent of the smoke was going out the chimney the rest was coming inside. Then when I was outside the coyotes sounded. I was sound of mind until my nose just started gushing blood all over the place. I finally got it to stop, and was debating going in or not when I fell asleep. Then one of the good ol boys woke me up and was like “hey B, you can come on in and get warm, the fires down and smoke is pretty much gone too.”Regardless I slept lousy. I had a bad dream. I was a coyote, then I was a human pretending to be a coyote to protect the sheep. I did the best coyote call, and waited and a sheep went by then a coyote, and I swung my hatchet to kill it and it landed in what turned out to be my brothers cat. I felt full of remorse and he disowned me, and I begged him to understand that people were more important than things. I was trying to shake him, as if to wake him up to the idea. Then he was surrounded by people who sided with him, I was at fault and all alone and woke up. It was four o’clock and I was irritable and knowing myself I usually have my hardest days when I wake from dreams like that. So I got hiking. I made it to the top of rocky top and had a 360 degree view, and waited for the sun to rise. The sunrise was a complete opposite of what was occurring behind me. It was beautiful and short lived, as soon as it rose the ugliness came from behind and covered the sun for the rest of the day. The rest of the trail I was processing how I felt and kept trying to blame the hunters, but I knew the things I tried to resent them for, were actually things I resented about myself, mostly the drunkenness. My latest piece of gear proved its worth in forty degree rain. Got the thick, textured gloves like the kind you would deep clean the bathroom with. Put those over my liners and had toasty hands. Took a short day because I was mentally and physically exhausted.

I made sure to put all my clothes in my bag to put on in the morning but forgot my wet shoes and socks. They were bricks of ice. I put my socks in my bag and slowly put them on as they thawed, over my bread bagged dry smartwool socks. My shoes I had to cook over my stove. My bear bags were icy when I pulled them off the cables. I got packed quickly without breakfast and got warmed up by hiking. Walking out the shelter was incredible, everything was white. I said beautiful out loud more than 100 times. As I got closer to Clingmans Dome I kept getting sneak peeks of what the smokies had to offer. When I summited I was blown away. (Almost literally I had to stand behind the pillar.) The world was all white with white peaks poking up from white clouds.I wanted to shout for joy and exclamation. For a second I was worried about breaking composure (what will people think?) and I said screw that! I howled with no reservations and started laughing crying in freedom and glory. I was ever great full to God for his masterpiece that is me and the world. For the courage an strength that helped me endure to this moment. I prayed for everyone on and off the trail. I stayed until I started to get cold and came down glowing. In nature I’m always in my element. I’m a bear when eating and sleeping, a wolf when I’m solo, and I’m an otter in the water. When I’m not here I’m just another animal in the zoo.The climb down from Clingman was treacherous, it was as if the creeks flowing from the heavy rain froze in one second. I could almost see where the last raindrops were still splashing. I was good in footing as long as I hit powder or rock, I wish I used my microspikes but had a lot of fun picking my way down. It descends into Indian Gap and Newfound Gap. The latter had heated bathrooms and trash cans. All but three got off here to spend the cold in Gatlinburg. I made my way to pecks corner shelter. Here’s where my blunder happened. Passing icy springs I just glanced at the sign, it said shelter was .02 to my right. I assumed that’s all it was. Unbeknownst to me the AT took a right there as well, and in my wonder at the beauty and watching the trail for ice I did not know I had left the AT and started on The Boulevard Trail to Mt. Leconte. About three miles in the trail pulls a 180 which I thought was odd, and noticed I also did not see white blazes. I realized I was off trail and decided to go to Leconte Lodge because I had heard about it and knew a shelter was nearby there. When I arrived it was a ghost town. So I got water and made a huge meal and hung bear bags and got ready for bed. (Wet shoes and socks in my pack liner in my sleeping bag) At sunset I heard someone howling much like me as Clingman and was relieved to know I wasn’t completely alone. Later two people came up to see if anyone had come up like I did. They asked about my gear and told me it was going to be 0-7 degrees and if it got too bad to come stay in the loft.Sleeping is tricky but as soon as I think I won’t be warm I fall asleep and wake up toasty every hour or so to switch hips.

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607673,"I tried to get up and packed to make it in time for sunrise but it’s impossible in the cold. I had to use my feet to get bear bags down and the cables put back where they were. In seven degrees metal is to be treated like a searing hot iron and basically does the same damage to flesh. Metal literally zaps the heat. A really insignificant thing that is backwards to what people think is heat transfers to cold. The cables weren’t making my hands cold, my hands were trying to heat the cables. In doing so my hands lose heat, not gain cold. Stupid really but I like it.
The best way to safely warm is to stick hands in pants or armpits. This is the combo I do getting ready in the morning. Ten seconds of touching gear, three minutes in my pants. Screw being bold, I put on every piece of gear I own IN my sleeping bag, it’s hard work and creates even more heat. 
When I packed, Kemp from last night came to show me a good place to look at the sunrise. Turns out he was the one hollering at the sunset and appreciates nature the way I do. He says he was blessed to come up two weeks early to watch the place before season starts. His job for these two weeks is to take pictures every morning and post temps. Pretty sweet gig. I haven’t done research but he says the trees surrounding us are yellow and red spruce. They smell amazing.
He offers me to come down to the cabin and get some coffee. He is a generous host with what little he has to offer. I was able to give up some trash and make coffee, tea, oatmeal, and tang. I was able to get a message out to let mom know I was off trail and where to start looking should I go MIA. Funny all the working wood’s people I run into are from Asheville including Kemp. The world can not be shown in a picture from up there. Kemp called it the Sea of Clouds. It’s what the world would look like flooded, and Kemp pointed out Cold Mountains’ head and shoulders in the distance. 
I said goodbye to everyone and made my trip down the Boulevard. Should I ever actually pay to stay at Leconte, this would be the path I take up. There are portions with sheer drops on one side with cables to hold onto. There are also portions that are like a knifes edge with drops on both. There was fog on the way up and none on the way down and it was exhilarating. Doubly glad I let someone know where I was because many areas a misstep on the ice would be fatal.
When I got back on the AT I was glad but exhausted and the last few miles to tri corner long. My knees were starting to send signals that I was going too hard and needed to take a break soon. Thinking of zeroing at standing bear hostel. 
When I arrived at the shelter, someone had a severe stomach problem and was lifted out by helicopter and left all their food for us. I resupplied my oatmeal and protein bars. There were two day hikers that saw the extraction happen and when we heard the blades again, they said they hoped they wouldn’t actually send the copter back for the backpack that was left behind because it was cold when it was around.
They did. And it was cold. We all stood on the tarp that made the fourth wall of the shelter to keep our gear from shifting around the shelter. Never experienced anything like it. A guy from the army dropped in and the copter left, he’s just like “how ya doing?!” He sent the copter to make circles for thirty minutes to simulate him working on a patient on ground. (They made a pretend situation out of getting the backpack just to practice) He asked us all kinds of questions like where we were headed and whatnot just to make conversation, and told us if we needed anything give them a call. He was having a blast, and I told him I hoped I never had to but was glad that the service was free if I did. That’s right. Free. Till the hospital, that’s where you go broke.
Made a huge meal and then set my bed up in a tyvek burrito because it was supposed to reach negative ten degrees with wind chill. I slept fine. Took awhile to get my feet warm. I found that I could put my two panels of zlite that I use as my backpack frame in between me and my liner of wet shoes and socks for added warmth.

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607678,"This morning I was worried about my knees and did gentle stretches to warm up. Getting ready was ridiculous and I somehow ate breakfast but I’m sure it would have been funny as an outsider looking in. I also took a morning dump, and I only bring this up to make anybody respect their cold toilet seat. This throne was literally covered in frost an wind was shooting up the hole. Picture that. Nuff said, may all your poops be forever harmonious.
Anyway hiking today was gentle and easy. I was able to wear all my gear for a good portion of the morning which makes me feel lighter when it’s not on my back. I was sad to be exiting the smokies and did not rush the experience. There were diamonds all over the tips of the branches and even sections where the ice acted as chimes in the wind. The eastern side of the mountains were generally clear and other sides were as though it had just snowed, completely white and 3-4 inches deep. Snow in these temps does not melt or slush, it just evaporates. I found that by regulating my temperature and never sweating, my water consumption does not change. I was unfortunately carrying half a liter of ice at all times because I forgot to dump it out last night or sleep with it. 
Yesterday and today I started to use my Chainsen Light XL microspikes. Man they are incredible. Idiot said he was gonna ask how much for them, and if I said 200 he said he’d give me three. It’s only in a crazy torrential rain followed by arctic blast that they are necessary. He had vitamin I (ibuprofen) which I needed, but was really longing for his microspikes at home. The only thing to earn his name that I can tell was leaving them there, otherwise he’s an exceptional hiker. I love his Foster can stove, it’s only downfall is it’s hard to find after a helicopter comes through. Back to the microspikes, I think of my stepdad when it comes to tools for the job, and microspikes are THE tool. I was walking down clear sheets of ice where my brain was like no! Don’t do that! With loud crunching sounds they would BITE hard and not budge. Now there isn’t a surface my Astrals can’t overcome.
I was shooting for standing bear hostel and was really surprised to find Fresh Ground’s Leapfrog Cafe posted up at the pigeon river. I should be on his Facebook page. I was the sole person he fed, and I hope Idiot is ok because he had full intentions of making it to standing bear as well. The last shelter of the smokies was inviting, still covered in snow tucked in the foothills of Mt. Cammerer, so hopefully he stayed there.
Fresh Ground is known for following certain parts of the bubble up north. He makes breakfast, dinner, has candy and Debby Cakes, Fresh fruits, and of course takes pride in his fresh ground coffee. Very good too, I hope I can sleep tonight.
My meal; two sloppy (I mean sloppy) joes on butter toasted buns with fresh cut onions and tons of mustard. The joe sauce is thick with hamburger meat and really hits the spot. Before and after that I had two servings of chicken noodle soup that was made with added pan cooked chicken and extra pepper. After that I had two more sloppy joes with all the fixings, this time on buttered bread. I followed this up with a roll of fruit life savers, a banana, a fudge round, four Oreos, an apple, half a king butter finger, and then followed up an hour later with three grilled cheese sanswitches cut in half. I had one cup of black tea and could not resist a cup of his famous coffee. I dried my shoes and socks over his wood stove and then we sat around and chatted waiting on Idiot to show. A man called Bloodhound came with two bloodhounds and butterfingers and firewood. He did a small interview with me for his site (the trek?) I can’t remember. 
Smokies will be forever in my soul and all the lessons I learned about myself through God will hopefully stay forever. My journal is finally caught up and there is so much more that only I could feel and see that will never be described in anyway. Now with the lingering coffee buzz, I’ll update Instagram with videos and pictures while I get ready for breakfast and coffee. (I’m staying with Fresh Ground on his lot with Joker.

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607805,"It’s 5am and Fresh Ground is stoking a new fire in his homemade heater. 
“Want some coffee?” Ugh, powerful stuff, has he slept? Have I? Hair of the dog, why not. Good coffee too, after drinking bustello instant, or eating it with my oatmeal. Breakfast in the cold is like just throw it all together turmeric, protein powder, stir some water in it and try to eat it before it freezes, or it freezes you.
I got all wrapped in a tyvek burrito last night because the last few nights had been brutal. Dropping so much elevation makes a huge difference, and it was overkill. It was warm! (Relatively)
Then the magic words, did I want some banana pancakes... followed by it’s gonna be more banana than pancake because they are about to go bad. I’m drooling. I crave potassium in all it’s forms, bananas, avocado, even potato chips. It’s a mystery what goes on behind that lid on his stove because food appears in quantities that are impossible at speeds that are inhuman. I’m inhaling pancakes and he’s already asking if I want roasted potatoes with cheese and ketchup. I can’t keep up. We had a talk about struggling with wanting to hold on to things, and save them for special occasions. In his walk and mine we are being showed that we actually gain what we have and more by giving it away.
We said our farewells and I had some climbing to do. Slowly throughout the day I pieced more and more of Jack Johnson’s Banana Pancakes together from memory. I love a lot of his music because it is chill and carefree and much better stuck in my head than Modest Mouse’ Little Hotel or Red Hot Chilli Peppers’ Road Trippin’.
There are streams with waterfalls and cascades that I have been longing to hear again since the silence of the smokies. They all come trickling down to fill the “dirty bird”, local name for the pigeon river. A decade ago it used to be terrible to pass through this area because the stench of the paper mill was so strong. It’s cleaned up a lot since then, but it’s still common to hear dirty bird among kayakers. 
Atop Snowbird Mountain was my first clear view of what foot travel really looks like. Looking back I saw Mt. Crammerer which is distinctive in its inverted talon-like peak. Looking forward I can see Max Patch still covered in snow ten miles (foot travel) in the distance. I finished off my road banana pancakes and an orange and headed on.
Today was the most elevation gain and loss so far. There are many Deep Gaps on the trail but this one earns its name. All the elevation gained from I40 is slowly lost completely and you arrive here, only to gain it all back again and more a second time. The switchbacks are frustrating because you constantly go north and south, so as a crow flies Max Patch is probably only two miles away. It’s about the journey not the destination right?
I figured I’d be offered beer a lot more than this and I was surprised that I made it this far before someone offered to buy me a drink in Hot Springs. I thank God that the thought isn’t even entertaining. I used drugs and alcohol to avoid getting low, and the magic happens when you learn to be present (and sober) at the low points, because when you are elevated from that point it’s the highest you’ll ever be, and the longest lasting high too! The most encouraging word is God never gives me anything I can’t handle and always creates a way to “endure”.
Max Patch is filthy muddy with some of the blackest, richest soil I’ve ever seen. I wish it occurred to me that microspikes are good for more than snow, as I’ll soon find out the next day (AnininA), because I felt bad for walking on the grass next to the trail, which may soon get destroyed as well.
If I thought Snowbird was fun look at foot travel, looking at the Smokies was awe inspiring from here. No way I did this by myself, and from here it is obvious why the smokies are Great! Towering in the distance with the snow on the shady sides of the folds of the blanket of conifers and azaleas and rhododendron. 
Max Patch had lost all it’s snow, and I was relieved to find my home for the night was shrouded in white and bittersweet in the fact that I was sleeping alone.","Pigeon river bridge

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607808,"I slept around 14 hours from 1800 to 0800!Eating breakfast a funny thought occurred to me. Sometimes I can be really disconnected from my body. I mean... I feed it, I clean it occasionally, I even try to stretch it now and again. Apparently it needs sleep too?! So needy. Can I not drag this frame along on continuous 15+mile days and it be resilient?! I guess tomorrow it’s finally time for a pampered zero day.I dabbled really hard with dissociatives at the end of high school and through my mid twenties. Some of it still lingers and I’m still in my infancy at learning how to communicate with others and express myself. The people closest to me know when I’m smiling or happy and telling a joke. Other people probably find me awkward because my face never lets slip any signs of what’s going on, which is frustrating because I’m usually like “How can they not see that I’m angry?! Etc” The other half is projection and I make way too many assumptions. In all honesty I never realize my impact on people and I may never will. I am well aware that this is just a frame I reside in. This may be strange to some, but my ultimate goal is to buy some land, get a burial permit, and appoint close and willing friends to bury this frame in the most natural way. The billions of tons of concrete and embalming fluid we pump into the earth, rendering acres upon acres of land unusable is unacceptable. I hope people reading this start thinking more about how they want to die, because that is the beginning of knowing how you want to live. I hope my nutritious corpse feeds the ground. Maybe even a tree that continues to bear fruit long after I’m gone.Sorry for the side trip, when you take the distraction of the world away it’s really fun to ride the rides an unbridled brain goes on! I love my daydreams. I go miles sometimes living a dream while in a dream. Back to current reality, after Walnut Mountain the trail is two inches deep in clay-leaf compost swelled by the slow melting of snow. AS SLICK AS ICE. Each slip creates unnecessary destruction! What can possibly be done? I think what I like so much about hiking is it’s always presented problems for me to solve. This is where I thought to try out the spikes again. Magic. It’s like walking on a sunny dried out trail! My knees have been taking a beating from watching my step and now I’m free to walk normal saving time and ligaments.AnininA.... I can’t begin to understand how that is said unless it’s sung, but these are my thoughts and thanks for asking. Godspeed on your 2020 hike and the trail and all ridge runners thank you for considering an early start. As with everything in the world there is the mass opinion of people... and the whole other realm is... what do you FEEL? Or better, what do YOU feel? Nobody knows you better than you! On another note Maury (a ridge runner) and Kemp (LeConte Lodge) say there is always some sort of nasty weather late February early March in the smokies even if it’s not realized 3000 feet below. Plus it’s fun to be the envy of people that try to get by with less weight. Even with all my safety equipment my base weight is 17-18 pounds! To see what I’ve seen again, I would take on another ten. Hike Your Own Hike. Plus Chainsen Lights are like 7 oz? A lot lighter than the burden of a critical injury. Thanks for sharing the flowers in the toilet. That was a funny image to reflect on.I have solved the dog print in the smokies mystery. I knew it was an oddly big print. It belongs to a veterans chocolate lab. Well behaved too. Finally caught up to him near my home for the night. I didn’t think anything about it until he said WE had to skip the last 30 miles of the smokies due to weather. I also got to hang with a group that got together from Church and of the crowd I talked to Dwayne and David the most. It was fun being asked questions about thru hiking that I had myself, and was able to answer now from experience. We only keep what we give away. Dwayne and I shared our thoughts on the healing properties of nature, and ultimately God. I hope I have all this info right but he is music and sports director for church and orchestrates outings that help bring people closer to God, though he humbly won’t take credit. He also is teaching a class called Finding Yourself on the AT for a college course, and brings the values of nature, reflection, and community together. We had a great fire in the rain and I had yet another flying dream, which happen almost every night now. Unfortunately a police officer stopped me from jumping all over town and told me to wake up. Also, looks like it’s going to be a nero mile day tomorrow since I stayed here. (Near-zero) something like 3.1 which is fine with me. Nobody wakes when I do anyway, why not be on the trail?","Roaring fork shelter

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607836,"I tried to be as quiet as possible packing up this morning, and thought I successfully did it. As I was leaving everyone whispered goodbye and it was unexpected.
The hike started from dark to light and the sunrise peaked as Hot Springs came into view. As the trail ended I was wondering how I was going to find the hostel without reception and saw it to my left.
Bunk was twenty and laundry was five. I got a shower and my feet were laced in black streaks and dirt in and around my nails that I’m not sure will ever come out. I clipped all nails for the first time in... a long time. I can tell when my life becomes less stressful because my nails grow out. When at other home I’m constantly biting them off. I really have a hard time being around people. 
My friends Rob, and the Johns made the drive from Asheville and we ate at the local restaurant. I tried to convince the Johns to try fried chicken livers because I love them so much. I crave the iron. Then my meal consisted of 20oz of hamburger meat smothered in onions and mushrooms with fried okra and pickled beets. I wasn’t even that hungry. I love these guys so much, and there’s so many more I wish could be here. I guess I don’t struggle with all people, these people accept me knowing where I come from.
It was hard to say goodbye, and I hope to run into friends before Virginia. Then I see my mom and stepdad in Damascus, and that will be the last of the visitors from home that I know of. If anyone has tried to call or text I only have WiFi.
Back at the hostel the crowd bubble that I passed in smokies has caught up and the hostel is full. It is great to meet my yoga brothers again, but the other needs shoes this time and I can’t be around this crowd. It’s not the people, just the noise and the weed and the beer. It’s hot in here and I can’t imagine it being quiet any time soon. I may cook all my eggs and put them in a zip so I can sneak out tomorrow and push 20 miles. The brothers may join but I’m not worried that we won’t see each other again. Everyone is surprised I’m not farther ahead but I’m not traveling fast. Just steady. I like being solo because it’s easier to meet people and explore. 
Anyway there’s two fire towers tomorrow and I have to convince myself that I shouldn’t go camp in the one eight miles away now. This is just me complaining about my first world problems, maybe I’m in a bad mood. It’s the air. I don’t know. Definitely going to sleep, I can’t wait to breathe pine needles again, and hear the wind and streams.","Deer Park Mountain Shelter 
",Laughing heart hostel,"Mar 09, Sat",3.20
Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607867,"Several things alleviated my anxiety last night. 1. Recognizing that 25,000 calories of fried food, ice cream, and coffee can put one on edge. 2. Bouncing thoughts and feelings off of Asa, one of the brothers, made me realize I was having a control issue and just let go. 3. Cracked a window and was able to listen to rain and wind, which turned out to be a pretty heavy storm.
I had a slow start. Packs back up to 35 lbs or so. Walked the AT which runs right through town and there are AT plaques embedded in the sidewalk. Made it to Bluff Mountain Outfitters to wait on Asa and T to ge there to get their shoes. I just bought aquaseal to fix mine when I take another zero. I’m determined to make them last to Damascus. While sitting there talking to the employees about kayaking, a guy came in asking if there was any prayer requests. I said yep, pray for me and everyone on the trail. He said he would and also if I wanted to go to church to wait outside in ten.
I was thinking of a church that played a big part in saving my soul. A special shout out to The Vineyard on Big Pine Key. I was at one of my lowest points living on a sinking boat in between Little Torch and Big Pine and walking back one day from the library they yelled at me in the parking lot to get some food. I actually looked behind me for the person the must be talking to but no one was there. I stammered that I was in no shape for church, cut off dickies, white muscle shirt, and my hair was naturally starting to dreadlock from the saltwater, but in no fashion whatsoever. They said they didn’t care and took me in and nobody flinched. They really were just glad they could help. When the music started the shame and guilt I’d been hiding from myself really reared it’s ugly head, but at the same time I got cold an goosebumps everywhere because I felt the Holy Spirit so hard I was wracked with a spell of crying that left me relieved for the first time in a long time. That was my first experience realizing that I needed to let God help. Of course I took the reigns many times after that and still try to, but it’s progress not perfection.
That being said when someone walks randomly in my life and opens the door to church, I take it as a sign and opportunity. 
Got in the car with the pastor, assistant pastor (Roy), and Charles Manson. Haha for real. That’s how he introduced himself, and he was playing a guitar. We talked about bad experiences with the heat from Rocky’s Chicken Shack, and of course hiking. 
It was a small service, the kind I like, and it was powerful. I got the chills many times and my Spirit Tank was just being filled back up. It was about Daniel and the lions den. Being fearless for God. The pastor is well articulated and makes many good references to help understand what’s going on in the chapters exactly. 
Arriving back it town spiritually rejuvenated, I hang out with Fresh Ground and said goodbye to Queen of Thrones (she slept in the heated bathroom at the gap for Gatlinburg), for she was going back on shift for wilderness therapy.
Then I hit the trail! The sweet glorious trail! Suns out too! The trail traces the river going upriver and I saw Kayakers Ledge from way up in the mountain. I never knew the trail was right above and I have kayaked this section many times! Also, there are some great views of Hot Springs from the switchbacks heading up. Before I left the river I soaked my feet in the river and ate some leftovers. I walked real slow today and finally arrived at the tower which is basically the coolest of all treehouses. Four great people to hike with to Erwin Tennessee, 70 miles from here. I see the smokies waaaay back there in the background, the babiest of baby blues.","Laughing heart hostel

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607970,"For some reason I thought mice couldn’t or wouldn’t climb up a metal fire tower. Sure enough at 0200 I awakened to a loud munching noise. I was still sleepy and in denial, thinking it was just the wind on my tyvek. But I heard it again and raised up and saw Phils second or third cousin jumping out of my bear bag. I’m so lazy I set it on the windowsill and oddly enough it worked to my knowledge.I couldn’t sleep very well til about 0400, not because of the mouse, just because. When I fell back asleep however it was deep. Still got up before dark and grabbed my stuff up and finished packing at the base of the tower as to not disturb anyone.I love hiking to warm up and watching the many stages of sunrise through the trees. I walk slow in the early light, to give my body a chance to warm up, and avoid tripping.The other nice thing about getting up early is the trail magic. Ran into Fresh Ground his last time before helping the Appalachian family down south. There is a group of six, parents and four daughters doing the trail. Imagine that.The trail went up after that and eventually followed a ridge. There was a sign saying no climbing routes from January to August because of peregrines. Trucks and hunting dogs could be heard nearby.This part of the trail was bountiful in springs. Some parts rode along a shelf of rock that several springs would bubble up every couple of feet. Also there is a large variety of mushrooms growing everywhere. The black ones on dead birch are Chaga but not sure of the rest. There are several in plaques set off from the trail stating in memory of so and so.Today was supposed to be nice but it is overcast with a slow drizzle off and on. There is a fork in the trail and one side is bad weather trail, the other exposed ridge trail. I went on the latter, and it was very pretty. Ferns growing on the sides of very strategically placed rocks that formed steps along the walls of sandstone. Looked like something from a jungle. Later you walk up on the exposed ridge, it’s really rocky with views on both sides. This goes on for 1.5 miles, picking way through rocks and walking up steps.After that section it was not long before we arrived at the cabin where I set my hammock up for a third time. Also got a good fire going and this was going to be my last night with Idiot before he leaves tomorrow for Asheville airport.I’ll see if I can’t send you the full videos in your email Idiot, but my instagram is spangeforchange for those who don’t know.

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607988,"The nest of a hammock really does the trick.
These are the kind of thoughts I wake up to. I knew i was doing big miles today and never wake up reluctant.
After losing my headlamp on the trail, I was able to get my sunrise start started. There were many random fields today and the path was the best yet. It was mostly clear of debris and gently rolling, enabling a very quick pace but able to still look around at everything. 
Shiners wife JuJu produced the trail magic today and I almost missed her, but was insanely right on time. I was heading across the road when she pulled up and hollered “you want me to make you a sandwich, are you hungry?” She is having a lot of fun helping hikers and slack packing her husband. Slack packing is where someone shuttles you or your pack in a way that you only carry necessities for a period of the trail.
I’m glad I ate because after that gap, Devils Fork, was a a hard 15 more miles. Water is nonexistent for long stretches and today was the most water I drank. Almost two liters. What I realized I was lacking was salt. 
Sam’s gap was pretty and there was a granite plaque that a bunch of volunteers placed off trail. To them, this was the stretch that God revealed his glory. This area has a lot of clay and young tulip poplar. I always notice when they are around because their dead bark strips are the best fire starter. 
Just when I think I’ve gone really far Bald Mountains head came into view when I came out into a field. It looked so far away! I tried to predict how the trail was going to be routed to get there and it was nothing like I imagined. I am glad they did it in a way that it was a gradual incline for the next five miles, because I was too tired for any more straight up. 
I thought about quitting for the day early many times, but as I neared the crest I was kissed by the wind that cooled my sweat and made me smile with gratitude and accomplishment. 
I had already started soaking dinner a couple hours before and I sat down to eat, then cooked another meal. I stayed right in that spot and put out my bed and went to sleep. Idiot was right, the stars are really nice here, after the moon sets. I can see Erwin and it’s blaze of lights down below.","Jerry’s cabin

When I woke up I felt like I was much older. I got up to use the bathroom and hurt in a lot of new places. I already made my mind up that I wasn’t going to stay in Erwin so I had a short day. I laid back down and the brothers were concerned. They had never seen me sleep in before. To be honest I woke up and saw that sunrise was going to be beautiful so I waited for that, then I just waited after they left for the right moment to rise. The wind was still gently caressing and it felt nice to be really present in not moving. I was grateful for the easy morning and it was very meditative. Eventually it came time to rattle the cage of bones by getting up. Definitely some stretching this morning.
On trail the balds have the prettiest red grasses which are actually bushes I have yet to define. The crew that keeps the area left some educational material on why they keep the bald cut back and it’s for raptors and other migratory birds.
I was soon greeted by “foo man” and Amanda and the coolest dog so far, Sandy, who is obsessed with fetch much like barnabas, my homedog golden. Sandy is a very red Australian Shepherd and I thought it was because she had a little bird dog in her. She is very vocal, and makes a lot of noise when you love on her. 
I ambled on down the trail to find a guy greet me mistaking me for Asa. He caught me off guard by saying “you don’t look like you’re that in to it today” I told him I was tired and tried to figure why that unnerved me. I realized I didn’t know how I felt about myself yet, and worse yet, this guy never knew me before but he was right. I was kind of foul. People like me have a thing to keep in check. HALT hungry angry lonely tired. The more of those I meet, the more I should prepare for irrational behavior like getting angry at perspective comments. I was hungry, thirsty, always a worldly lonely, now peeved, and very tired. Red light.
I started doing self care, I walked really slow, got to some water, ate, drank, realized why I was peeved which was my defects as usual. Even later as I entered Spivey gap, I followed and listened to its beautiful creek, I felt wind and sunshine, and gave thanks. I put my feet in the ice cold water till they hurt in an oddly numb way. After all these things which took half the day I had corrected the slump rather than falling into it.
I got to no business knob and ate a ton, was greeted by sandy and co again, set up my tarp and crashed at 1400.","Bald mountain summit

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608144,"A long nights sleep can do wonders for the body. I felt at least just five years older, which is definitely a step up. Wind is still buffeting the tarp since last night steady but the temperature has risen. I absolutely love getting ready in my space away from the shelter I can take my time and be thorough in the dark to avoid the mental checklist walking the trail. At least more of it. My trekking poles get left the most. Three times so far. I only get about 100 yards before I’m wondering why walking is so weird.
Mostly gentle climbs getting out of the shelter area. And then a slow switchback descent to town. I was wondering why the trail crew was raking the leaves off the banks many miles back and now I think I get why. Moss is growing in all shapes and sizes and colors along these banks in a manicured four foot high kind of way. Several views open up, first to a great length of the Nolichucky River, then more of the river and the town of Erwin. A local who let me hitch a ride back to the trail said everything was mostly Indian except Erwin... and it was supposed to be Ervin.
I saw uncle johnnys hostel but kept going. I just didn’t want to stay in a hostel. Laughing heart was enough for awhile. I did however decide to start walking into town, and the road was closed to people repairing the road over the railroad tracks so there was no traffic to hitch the two miles or so. It was beautiful. You can hear the river and without the cover of the trees it felt like spring. Some older man had fired up the tractor for the first time in forever because it was misfiring, but eventually he was traveling down the other side of the tracks. He had what looked like an old school kayaking helmet on and gave me a big wave, smiling from ear to ear.
I walked about a hundred feet past the salon when I just felt like I needed to go in and get a haircut. She asked “you want to shampoo it first?” But it wasn’t a question because she was using Jedi mind tricks by slightly shaking her head up and down as she asked. So I got it all; shampoo, with the gentle massage, and a cut and convo. We talked about everything from antibiotics to food from Stone Ridge Tavern. An excellent place to eat in Asheville. Then she only wanted ten for it all. I gave her twenty and she called her husband to give me a ride to town. He asked questions mainly wanting to know how much it cost. That is a common question. I said a pampered experience could see 12k, and a spartan experience would be around 2$ a mile or 2.2k.
He dropped me off all you can eat pizza which had just started and I was the first one there. The pizzas weren’t out yet so I made a heaping salad. I love it when salad bars have eggs busted up. I spent two hours eating and writing and planning and eating. Then as I was finishing up, joker, billy goat, and a third came in. They were taking another zero because Fresh Ground was going to show tomorrow. I originally went to town for instant coffee and buffet, and left with an apple(always), quart bags, instant coffee (of course) five fully cooked brats, a huge thing of honey roasted peanuts, five packs of ramen(only because I don’t see chili flavor that often), a bag of robins eggs (my Easter weak spot), and spice drops which is basically 10oz of sugar for a dollar. Best bang for the buck on the shelf. I was so happy this morning that my pack was finally lighter. Oh well.
It’s weird to hitch in a spot where people aren’t going you’re way so I walked back around to the road that was gonna take me back to the trail and the Ervin guy honked didn’t even have to ask. Locals are saying storm at midnight. Asked what roan mountain would look like Monday or Tuesday and she believed snow. Nobody ever really knows but I hope she’s right. I’d love to use this winter gear one last time and get epic shots of roan.
The hike leaving town is beautiful and climbs to a view of the river and back down, then follows many creeks with ominous blowdowns and slim bridges. I took an ice bath and cleaned my feet thoroughly as they need the most love. My other leg muscles felt new again after I started hiking to warm back up. The trip was short, once again because I was in no rush. Widow makers are trees that are top heavy or more liable to blow down due to age. They are everywhere, and two behind the shelter do not give me comfort in the locals said it would be windy. Could be interesting!","No business knob shelter

One of the good things of going out into the unknown is the shelters tend to be empty. I was able to string my hammock in the top part of the shelter. The storm was just soothing wind and rain, not the least threatening. Jamming down the trail listening to the wind and catching the last glimpses of Erwin. 
I was absolutely surprised to see a truck parked with an umbrella up obviously ready to do magic. It was only me and billy goat on the trail today I think, everyone thought it was going to be raining all day. As I approached he said just that. “You want some magic?”
This guy had the setup. Chairs, hot drinks, cold drinks, fresh apples and oranges, and home baked brownies and banana bread that were creamy with moisture and dense in flavor. His coffee was black and strong and when I added cream which I usually don’t do, it hardly changed color.
I asked him why he did what he did, affinity for the trail from being a hiker or...? He finished my sentence with just caring for fellow children of god. He is reserved and chooses his words, and points in which he adds to the conversation. He got billy goat a little tongue tied by directly asking if he was a Christian, but didn’t pursue the matter any farther as if just getting him to think about it was the purpose. His name is Brother Tom, a grateful survivor or cancer, and a rescuer of his boxer Moses, who was cast away for his imperfections and developed parvovirus and defeat it with the love of Tom. 
Fully loaded on street legal drugs caffeine and sugar I hit the trail. They weren’t magic brownies but my spirits were lifted so that I was high as a kite. The sun even made an appearance shortly after.
A couple of red grassy balds and a rare water source later, the beginning of Unaka Mountain begins. In stages I can’t think it can get more beautiful and then all of a sudden, I become aware I’m on sacred ground. The earth is spongy with moss and roots and the woods become hollow with a stillness between canopy and floor of the beautiful fragrant red spruce. Tips of the trees litter the floor and the scent is fresh. Somehow I realized I was at the peak and was called to sit in a certain spot and meditate. I was led to imagine the forces of wind to be angels coming through this area like blood in the heart. Shedding the stresses of the world and getting filled by the pulmonary veins that grew out of the ground, only to go and do more battle. I waited for one of the balls of wind to pass by me and I sent my thanks to the angel I saw before in the past. He was robed in translucent color and armored towering high above me. Decked in armor made for battle not beauty. I heard millions of people praying for people in general or in my condition. Then I woke up. 
Then when I knew meditation was over I stepped out of the sacred space, saying of all the trail I was going back there to visit. It was powerful. I kept looking back at that peak as I walked away in longing. The spruce faded into rhododendron and then they into deciduous trees and I began to wonder if it ever happened. Maybe they were magic brownies. I passed two girls on spring break and told them they were close to the top and my favorite part of the trail so far. Hope they enjoy it like I did. Finally got around to the shelter that was my first possible destination. I left billy there because I was just in a mood to amble on. Blue skies and the wind (spirit, angels) going wherever it may. 
Tomorrow will be my day in the only section that I stayed at a shelter on the AT before starting this trip. Went with a friend to over mountain shelter and I plan to do so again today. I have been thinking of her all day and we rarely talk because she resides in Hawaii now but I’m not kidding. I was starting this entry and she texted me asking how the trek was and to send her a picture. Blew my mind. 
So here I am at clyde smith shelter, successful pct hang after a fire and brats grilled on a stick. I am alone for the first time since roaring fork and I have to say I’m pretty lonely. But I’m pretty excited because I think my friend rob is gonna meet me at 19east to go play disc golf in roan mountain Sunday. I think what made me lonely is I was hoping for someone to share the bratwurst with, so someone else knew how incredible they were. Forgot I even had them. I guess I’ll savor the memory myself. Got a 17 mile day tomorrow but the shelter has the most scenic toilet of the trail so I’m pretty stoked.","Curley gap shelter

Was fine for the first stretch while warming up but as I started climbing roan mountain it just kept getting colder and with more wind. By the time I gave up it was hard to undo the buckles to get my clothes out.The ascension is beautiful the transition of trees is always really great to walk through, and I’m elated when amongst the conifers. Stone steps have been worked into the trail in many places and after years have settled and grown to look archaic. The path weaves it’s own course and all cardinal directions are walked in order to navigate the ridges. As I started nearing 6000 feet it felt like being back in the smokies with icicles and frosted trees, a path of ice in some areas, and air so cold I had to put all my layers on and tuck my poles under the pits so I could keep my hands warm.In house gap, which is a place of an old hotel, there is a clearing and parking lot off trail. I was hoping to unload my trash and other trash I had picked up but bathrooms and even trash cans were locked. I did score a can of spam that an animal had tried to get into but with no success. Wasn’t a wasted side journey.Had to make a stop at roan shelter because it’s the highest shelter on the AT, and boasts four walls. I had an idea what that meant but was surprised to find it actually had a door. It also had an attic and that is where I had spam ramen. I felt like a guy post apocalypse all alone just scavenging and finding shelter whenever possible. As I was coming down from the shelter I was just watching my step and enjoy the sun and wind when I heard someone screaming bloody murder. I think I originally thought someone slipped on the ice and broke something but as I rounded the corner a young person was struggling, and whipping around as if there was a swarm of bees. Both my party and his got to him at the same time, but the older man asked what was wrong. Turns out he just really had to pee and was stuck in his jacket, which is a serious emergency I guess for his age. The man asked me if my heart was racing too and we laughed at how scared we were!I kept reflecting back on that and kept laughing to vent off the stress that accumulated so sharply. I also made my mind up that when I drop all my winter gear I’m carrying my every day carry, which is my medkit that I carry in the front country, which can handle more serious scenarios than my current ultralight setup. I’m a wilderness first responder, I’d hate to have the training and not the basic supplies. Also better to have it and not need it than the other way around. The only thing I’ll leave at home that I usually carry with me everywhere I go is my opioid overdose reversal kit. Soon I was in Carver’s gap. So I was saying before I had done this section before with my friend Joy. We had great views on all the balds, and I accidentally went up to grassy bald(good accident), but all fog as soon as we dropped down to stay at the shelter and the next day to 19E. It is as beautiful as always and the wind is painfully numbing my cheeks, but every dog owner is taking advantage of the day. On my way up I saw ten or more dogs, and wondered if it was a planned event.I used my microspikes one last time in the muds that are common around balds, and hope I won’t miss them when I drop them. I passed a huge group of scouts that hiked all the way to the shelter only to decide it was just on the no fun side of cold, and were hiking back up. Over mountain shelter was a great experience except it was crowded and there was whiskey and tequila and way too much fire smoke. Basically Spence shelter all over again. Note to self, if it’s easy to hike to and party at, go farther in or hammock way away. People drinking and people in general really don’t get the concept of necessary voice volume in the wilderness. You’d think nascar was in the background. Most people would rather be heard than listen anyway.","clyde smith shelter

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608302,"Having not had set an alarm I woke up every hour on the dot from 0300 to 0600. I had to be up early to meet Rob at 1030. I read some food and ate some food, surprised at how warm it was comparatively.
I had carried a branch of spruce branch from roan mountain in my chest strap savoring the smell. This morning it found it’s new home at the privy. I warmed up real easy by trying to summit before sunrise but I did not make it in time. This section I remember real well because joy forgot her journal and I ran back to get it from the shelter. Like I said, the rest was shrouded in mystery and fog. My profile picture for trailjournals was actually taken by joy in this section. It was fall of 2017 I believe and it was just us and the mice.
Thinking about joy and the mice, I started daydreaming about Phil. My friend up at LeConte shelter. I started thinking and wondering how he got up there, and the fantasy that played out was he started at over mountain shelter.  Basically he’s a John Galt from Atlas Shrugged and he went to a remote place to start a new world. Now he’s almost ready to have the other brilliant minds come join him, all driven by their own forces, and ultimately for his Dagny of mice as well.
That led me to start thinking of the other provocative books I read and about socialism and brave new world and the screens telling us when to stretch. But I won’t go into what I think about it all, just that it is fascinating that George Orwell, Ayn Rand, and Aldous Huxley among others imagined things we see unfolding today that didn’t present themselves as strongly many years ago. 
The rest of the trail went by fast at a speed of about three miles an hour. Met Rob just a little late, and Tarzan, who left Springer on the 27th of February was waiting with him. Rob is winging the trail magic thing, but is a natural. He had a box of assorted doughnuts and me and Tarzan crushed them. Then we road into the small town dropped Tarzan off and we got subway. I ate my sub before we got to the frisbee golf course. The course is simple but fun because it has easy and hard tee boxes. The first hole was 394 ft long, and that’s how many miles I’ve hiked so far. He won the hard round and we tied the easy round because he missed some pretty easy shots. It’s the ten foot puts that are psychological. There was local dogs running around playing together and doing dog things, and basically every sign warned play at your own risk. Even an abandoned shack across the street had something similar spray painted on it. Then we drove around until we landed at a bbq joint and met back up with Tarzan. I got the boss burger which was easily a pound of meat with two slabs of ham and cheese and all the fixings. Also had a 36 oz shake I regretted.
It really sucked to say goodbye but it will be funny if his trip to narrows Virginia lines up when I’m going through pearisburg. 
On the trail I struggled through the insulin roller coaster of crazy fatigue spells but eventually leveled out and found my groove. Shortly after busting 400 mile mark is Jones falls which is a really tall cascade in the middle of seemingly nowhere. At this time the sun is setting and I hiked a mile further to the river where frogs and crickets sing their tune. I hung the bag again after finishing leftovers at the hangsite. I’ve slept alone many times but not being in a shelter is a little more intimidating. No tarp, moon is almost full. Hanging right on the river, no wind, great cool temps.","Over mountain shelter

I got my food down and ate and left my site spotless, I was never there.This area the trail is just weaving through the spider web of old logging roads. Areas primarily of poplar and oak with the occasional spatter of green from a rare hemlock. Otherwise it’s a lot of rhododendron. A lot of rhododendron usually means a healthy water table, and I crossed many a creek and saw various sized falls. On my guide there was something called hardcore cascades, and it wasn’t what I imagined being a kayaker, but definitely cool, especially when I learned trail crew routed the water to make it. The trail is gentle and the miles were pleasant with only occasional wood pecker and other birds going about their day. I often wonder what a person, who needs music, and other technological stimulation, would do if they were stuck in my head on a day like this. For me the silence is almost as welcome as the noise of rushing waters. There’s never enough silence.As I neared Dennis cove I was trying to imagine what bob peoples was like. He operates kincora hostel, and I’ve heard stories about him. He didn’t allow partying and he was active in the trail maintenance community. He suggests a five dollar donation, but I only had three and some change so I decided I was just going to meet him. When I arrived I was impressed by the amount of ivy starting to cover the cabin. A sign on the front tells me to go around back and make myself at home. Upon entering lo and behold, Billy Goat. Another person as well who I will call Many Names. He suggested I make a heaping pork sandwich and I told him my financial concerns. He said that was fine I could do work if I was really worried about it but bob wouldn’t be. So it was left up to me and billy to polish off a crockpot of pork which I did happily. Can never get enough meat. Then I took a shower which was kind of chilly because the bathroom wasn’t very warm, but that made for a rustic experience. Later bob showed back up and we all chatted but I mainly listened. There was talk about foreign trails and bobs times in the Air Force. Billy Goat blows my mind with his knowledge of everything it seems. He is not only good with events but even time periods and specific dates.I got unnaturally tired and when it was time to sleep I was so tired it was hard to.","Elk river

Bob lays out cat food for eight cats and several raccoons every day. They eat together without problems. I’ve never seen the coons but before I went to bed the dishes were full and now they’re not. Apparently they are huge, fat and happy coons.I was organizing my bag, getting ready for an early departure when many names came in with stuff to make breakfast and asked if we wanted any. Eggs! Finally. I crave them all the time. Cholesterol is so good for me. Seriously. I need tons of it.So eggs and ham later, we are loaded with leftover ham and boiled eggs. Bob comes in with his coffee and we have yet another sober and involved conversation which I’ll hang around for. He talks about how iron was mined here for Johnson city, how him and 146 men built mountaineer shelter by hauling the logs on shoulder a mile and a half. He got the local school involved with rebuilding cherry gap shelter, and is providing possibilities for handicap people to do trail maintenance.Finally closer to ten it is time to go, the latest I started anywhere except amicalola. I go slow. Shortly is laurel falls. It’s impressive but now the trail has its own new side to it. I actually pay attention to the steps that were put in place or the rock that was chiseled on for three whole days to grant passage next to the river and the trail itself lasts three whole steps. Pretty incredible stuff. Soon watauga lake is visible and the first thing you come upon is a beach. I had lunch and then laid on the picnic table and dozed in the sun for an hour. I ran into a wilderness ranger and he said bears have been spotted in the smokies. I said snakes will be out soon too. There is a shelter on the lake that will be dismantled because a hunter was leaving dog food there to attract bears to kill. Can’t fix stupid.For a split second I could see and hear watauga river. But mostly it was a day of walking around the lake. There is smoke moving into the area, and gunshots coming out of the smoke far away. Not sure what that means. I’m almost out of food which is good because I’m thinking of doing 33 miles tomorrow to make a meeting in Damascus. So better sleep. Good to be caught up.","Kincora

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608488,"WHAT A DAY!
I ran out of all the sugary stuff from town the night before last, and one sign I’m detoxing from sugar is I sleep really hard and I am sluggish in the morning as well. I made up my mind to wake up early to make the push for Damascus but I could have went back to sleep so easily! Normally I’m always ready to go. So I asked God what he thought and all I heard was read your bible. So there’s thirty one proverbs for every day of the month and I have been reading them every morning as a way to start the day. It said don’t love sleep and not to be lazy so I got the message. I got up ate the rest of my protein powder, (all I had for dinner as well) and left an hour twenty before sunrise.
They call it the Tennessee Turnpike once you get to Vandaventer shelter. It’s basically all ridge walking to Damascus with only three 500ft+ climbs. In the dark however it’s not smooth sailing. I stumbled on rocks, left the trail at a point, branches everywhere, and trail was slanted in many places. This is all with bright moonlight as well. Eventually the sun gave a twilight and the trail opened up despite blow downs. I reached iron mountain shelter and calculated my speed and it wasn’t very impressive. Luckily after this shelter is where it truly opens up, and a good pace is established. I had to do ten hours of 3mph hiking to make it with time to spare, roughly two hours.
One cool thing about getting up super early is I saw six deer before sunrise. I’m not sure who startled who but if it weren’t for the glowing white tails, I would have been nervous about what was in the woods with me. I can’t find the notes I made but I like how they have virginianus in they’re Latin name. Odocoileus Virginianus. A few hours after sunrise I saw six more and got good footage of three young that didn’t seem frightened out of ignorance. They were curious as well. I booked it to ice springs shelter and ate my last ramen and exchanged a few words with a south bounder started December in Pennsylvania. Made good time till I was a mile away from Abington Gap Shelter. The forest service was doing a “prescribed” burn. I’ve heard of controlled but that’s what they call it now I guess. The smoke was too thick so I had to wait. They gave me a bottle of water which is good because I didn’t see a source from before there to the end. They used the AT as one boundary and the road as the other, and they burn back from up top first, then light up at the road. If they started at the road it would burn too fast even with the optimal weather we were having. They use three parts diesel and one part gas as accelerant and their canister is really cool because the tips stay lit while they splash fire everywhere.
Finally I got the ok for an escort to take me through. It was a series of starts and stops as the smoke would become thick with a gentle breeze. We moved when it let up. The firemen don’t use respiratory equipment, and their packs are 35 pounds or so. That includes medical kit, a gallon of water, and batteries as the bulk of weight. They didn’t seem to mind all my questions. The smoke last night was them but not the gunfire. They asked me questions to. Mostly about my start date or where I came from. I’m finally in a region where some people don’t know Asheville.
When I finally got through I had approximately three hours to make the last ten miles. Luckily it was more gradual descent than anything and I made it to the Virginia border around five something. 3.5 miles later I was actually in Damascus! 
I made my way to souls harbor church another half mile away and waited for the chair person to show. Another guy showed up for his first time and we had a great talk before the meeting. We helped set up and a dozen people showed and it was so so good to be with other alcoholics! I will be hanging around till Saturday and I got connected and will be going to a meet in Abington tomorrow. Friday my mom and stepdad are making the trip up to see me Friday through Saturday so I will be with them till they depart, looking forward to that. 
I am exhausted but so content. The pavilion is a structure in a park set aside by the ATC as a shelter of sorts while in town. Tomorrow I check out woodchuck hostel, which was suggested by bob peoples. Sure enough they say no drugs or drinking in their advertising and everything I need for cleaning, laundry, resupply, will be 30$.","Vandersomething shelter

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608585,"I woke very sore and this morning was normal, it was 0500 and I knew i was getting up because usually I can’t sleep. It was also awkward sleeping in the middle of a park because it kind of reminded me of old days and I kept thinking police were gonna swing by to see if I was a drunk. I slept rough because both my hips were toast because I really make sure to use them heavy when going downhill or my knees take all the impact. That’s actually how I learned that I had tight hips. I finished a long day of thru hiking the Art Loeb with a friend but our last day was long like 12 miles or so. A lot of it downhill and my pack was easily 45 pounds. Old school equipment. Anyway the next day I was crippled and could not walk down the steps from my room. After research I found I had runners knee and it was from me walking in a very aggressive forward all thigh manner which does not let the knees rotate properly. Long story short I was introduced to hip opening exercises and yoga and I have to always consciously walk correctly using hips and glutes or my knees wear out fast. I slowly got up and stretched my fascia and calves in down dog and slowly stood up crossing my fingers that no serious damage would present itself. My feet were toast and muscles rocks but everything felt as it should! A good kind of wrecked! I limped and hobbled down the road letting everything break loose and loved walking through the sleeping town. It’s always fun walking in the road when nobody is on it.
I realized real quickly that everything on the map was closer than most maps in my awol guide. The hostel was a three minute walk from the pavilion and I didn’t want to go in too early so I decided to go to the grocery store that would open soon at 0600. A guy offered me a lift and I took it and he’s like “seriously man... where you headed? I’m going to Bristol so you can go anywhere along the way” I laughed and told him I actually did just wanna go to the grocery and would be staying in Damascus but that was pretty nice of him to offer.
I came into Damascus running on empty. I had no food and didn’t want to be awkward by eating ALL the cookies at the meeting like I was starved, and I was. I went to sleep on an empty stomach, but I should never shop on an empty stomach. I got six apples, six oranges, vegetables, a dozen eggs, half gallon of almond milk and chocolate rice cereal (which is basically warm ice cream) a pound of sausage five ramen a twelve pack of seltzer water and two jalapeños. It didn’t even fit in my pack. I walked back and checked in but nobody was up so I made myself at home. I put groceries up, took a shower, and started laundry before people really started coming around. I had three bowls of cereal, a hostess cupcake, an orange, two and a half waffles with whip cream and butter, hash potatoes and ketchup a glass of oj, a boiled egg, a dozen cooked eggs the pound of sausage and an onion bell pepper and tomato before I was finally satisfied. 
Rheda is the owner and we had an awesome talk today. We had to figure out how to drain the sink together but got into great conversations about sobriety, future plans, and eventually soulcraft. I’ll touch base on soulcraft before my trip is through. 
Then I took a small coma after eating half a 1.75 qt thing of edys ice cream and awoke to a friend from the meeting last night inviting me to a social and meeting combined 45 minutes away in Marion. Rheda was happy to take me and more deep conversation ensued.
At the social we played Pictionary and I got to know my friend and his sister a lot better. Then a big book study after that. We read “physicist, heal thyself” on page 301-309. Great discussion after. It’s so cool that no matter where you are a person can just get plugged into the program and it’s the same format wherever! Really encouraging and will come to visit!
Then went to my friends house where we ate a home cooked meal and got attended by four dogs at all times. It’s really hard making such good friends in such short times but I’d rather love and miss them than never love at all.","Pavilion

I still got up early today, there was a group of section hikers going to shuttle to the end of Grayson highlands and walk back that needed to get ready. They were packed kind of heavy so they hooked me up with some extra food. When they left I lazed about and got to know a guy named lunatic a lot better. He also hooked up the food because he got a drop box he didn’t need. He was heading back tomorrow to ultimately go home to his snow covered cabin in the woods of Maine. I also talk a lot with sun down? For some reason I question my memory there. But he got a new pair of shoes, and got him to share some experiences on the trail. Me and slow poke talked about 1984, Animal Farm, and other books because she had those on the table. Ironic because I mentioned them in a previous post. I bought Animal Farm off her because it’s a compact version and I started it long ago but remember nothing about it. I talked to T on the porch in the sun and up walked Jamin and Uncle Grandpa. Jamin has a great miserable story of brutal weather from nowhere on the ridge coming into Damascus. I went to Food City with Uncle Grandpa and talked with him about many things.I bring all these up because I spend a lot of time alone, but it’s really important for me to invest time in the relationships around me when they are around. It’s very intimate and often I’m smiling and laughing. These are things I never experience in front of the television or on the phone. It’s so gratifying and I’m so grateful for the people that I meet everywhere and I’m glad for all the time to reflect on what loneliness feels like and just how valuable people are.My mom and stepdad showed up and big hugs all around. I told everyone a hasty goodbye because I have faith I will see them again but with my family who knows? We got in the truck and basically was asked if the trail is what I thought it would be. I said it’s unbelievable. When impossible spiritual things reveal themselves I’m not even as surprised because I’m becoming aware of how powerful God is. I touched on stories of the trail where I have been tested and failed, only to learn and grow from that failure. We checked into the hotel and went to eat right after, but I was made aware our hotel had a hot tub and had that to look forward to!At dinner my stepdad surprised me by looking me in the eye and just telling me how excited he was to see me. He said they were both really looking forward to it. It means a lot when someone is vulnerable and honest like that. Our food took forever to come out but we talked the whole time about work and life. When we got back we went straight to the tub which was hot and unoccupied and we continued that talk and more, or just soaked in the water. My ligaments were celebrating. I stayed in long enough to get my heart rate up, but cut it short so I could soak one more time in the morning. Such a nourishing part of my journey in so many ways.","Woodchuck Hostel

Actually, I rarely went to any town because I needed to. Usually ended up going for the experience and buffets are hard to pass up. Now with 9-10 pounds of food and a total weight of about 22 lbs, I should make it really far before I have to get off trail again.Speaking of the trail, I’m pretty excited that it is now spring and perhaps I can really start learning trees and flowers and animals’ names. I found a laminated section of trees and realized that there is the flaky birch which is yellow and the smooth birch is black. That confused me in Standing Indian because there was both but I assumed the peeling ones were just more weather worn or something. Also there is the rhododendron Catawba that blooms pink where the Maximum blooms white. Among many other things. I have  been really curious to figure out what the small pale blue birds are that join me for 100 ft sections of the trail before making Star Wars’ laser chirps when taking off. When they fly I catch a glimpse of white under tips. Told my family I planned on hitting one more meeting before taking off so they decided to hang out another night since I wasn’t getting back on trail right away. Today we checked out some of the history of Abington. We saw a cemetery of Sinking Springs, and learned the history of the Over Mountain Men and Victory Trail. I crossed it on the AT near Over Mountain Shelter. Basically it’s a trail men took to bring the battle to the loyalist that stretches from here to Kings Mountain SC. It is considered to be the turning point of the revolution that had been dragging on for five years at this point.Now my backpack is packed with its new gear and I’m being really lazy. I make the trail sound incredible because it is, but it is also really taxing. Emotionally, physically, spiritually, and most of all mentally. So I’m just eating and doing nothing because soon I will be eating and occupied in all areas of my being.

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608767,"I don’t think I have ever thought hotel beds were comfortable until now. Plus a thirty minute soak in a hot tub before bed helps the process. We had the AC on with heavy fluffy blankets. After some of the snoring I’ve encountered on the trail I don’t even notice my stepdads low rumble. Long story short I have been living like a king. 
After the continental breakfast we sadly mosey out of the hotel. I’m doing my mental checklist wondering if I left something somewhere. I’ve been reading up on the latest treatment for snakebites and was talking to them about it when we appeared in Damascus as if we had teleported. To be honest the whole experience went by in a flash. Three zeros!
We take pictures by the caboose and exchange last bit of conversation. It’s bittersweet. I watch them as they disappear onto their journey and I begin mine again. I stop by mojo coffee because I said I would before I left. Then after about half a mile of the Virginia Creeper I crossed the road once again to be in the woods.
It takes a long time for reality to set in for me. I can’t help but be blocked from my emotions even when trying to be open and vulnerable. It’s a long practiced defense mechanism. A subconscious one. One thing I did feel though was satisfied. I looked back on the last days and could not find any wasted time. I made the most of every precious second by being fully immersed and involved with the people I was around. I had intimate conversation with everyone. I don’t think I had ever talked with my mom on a deeper meaningful level before that, except one time when she visited me in Asheville and I asked her about my uncle Kevin over some Mexican food.
Anyway on the trail again. The sun is out and there is a layer of sweat on my lower back where the backpack rides. There is a very good breeze and a crunch to my steps as I head through the dry leaves and needles. For this part of the trail the Creeper is more appealing because it rides right next to the river and crosses it on many bridges. Unfortunately I did the AT, which is deeper in the woods parallel to the Creeper but the beautiful green river is blocked by trees. Soon the trail leaves the Creeper and switchbacks up to the shelter that I’m at. 
I am taking a short day because I have new shoes and they are making me sore and causing discomfort in weird places. I hope it’s just an adjustment period. I had a long talk with a girl named hobble and her dad, now set up to sleep, not sure how I feel about my new bag and using pad straps and the big sock of a bag liner. It’s only difficult in a hammock. Plus I built a routine with my other gear and don’t like change too much but it’s a process.

I had only half my tarp up so that I could see the stars but could cover quickly should it rain. It was a peaceful rain free night in the back country. One cool thing about mountain house breakfast is I can just add water and it’s still pretty good. Biscuits are better still crunchy anyway. The most potent light weight seasoning is raw garlic and I add it to everything. It’s good for the blood.Hobble and her dad were taking an easy day so we said our farewells. The knot that kept appearing in my calf was gone and the short day was a good idea. Time to try and break the shoes in and not my feet. Unfortunately logistically, Saunders shelter is a bad place to stay if going to another shelter after. Lost mountain is 6 miles away and Thomas knob 18 so no sweet spot for new shoes.Normally hiking has been symmetrical when leaving towns. For Damascus it’s not so. It’s a lot of elevation gain, each mountain bigger than the last. Whitetop mountain is deceiving, from afar it looks like many of the mountains of the AT, but as you climb it, the top is elusive, and climbing into the clouds is yet another disorienting factor. Finally at the top and the trees give way to an expansive bald, and this will be my last good visible landscape all the way through Grayson Highlands. When searching for water I try to find only the most choice of sources, and along this Bald I found what I call The Fountain of Youth. A sign points the way fifty feet to my right. It’s your basic spring but what is so spectacular about this one is where the water touches the ground is deep, lush, vibrant mosses and grasses sprouting forth from the sea of yellow hay and red grasses. I actually poured out what I gathered earlier and filled up anew and drank deeply. It had a very alkaline feel to it and was ice cold. I made sure to carry some all the way to the shelter. After a while the climb to mount Rogers is just as long as whitetop but more rocky. The fog is thick and rain steady so I was just trying to be mindful and present when I was startled by the ponies. I hadn’t expected to see them till Grayson Highlands. Before I could get my camera out they ambushed me and started investigation with their noses. I thought they were going to be unhappy with me because I had nothing to offer, and wouldn’t if I could. I did have something to offer however as they started licking my legs in unison. Apparently the salt off my skin was a delicacy. The younger one would get frustrated and try to bite off a chunk of salt and I kept having to tell it that it hurt and kind of push it away so it knew it hurt me. Upon leaving I had to basically push through them like they were paparazzi. I was surprised they didn’t follow, but they were probably heading to lower ground since the weather was turning foul.At the shelter who do I see? Yep. Billy Goat. Somehow I knew I would, even with the extended Damascus visit. Just can’t shake him. The shelter is cool like roan shelter in the fact that it has a loft. All four through hikers claimed it (mad dash and T are back) and I got to experience my quilt out of the hammock. I’m growing to love it.

I remembered that happened in the middle of the night and even though I felt fine in the morning I drank every hour to make sure I got rehydration. I only caught a glimpse of a pony as I left the shelter. Unfortunately with all I heard of the Grayson Highlands I would have to come back to see it another time. It was not raining but it was a deep fog. That made it fun in its own way because there was many trail and road intersections and staying on trail or finding the white blaze was occasionally a challenge. I did figure out that the red grasses were actually birch trees and they used to be kept at bay by fire until the ponies were introduced keep the balds clear. They are a rugged animal designed to survive the harsh winters and are sometimes rounded up to check health and sell off to keep population under control. There is a place in the highlands called The Scales and it’s an area at 4600 ft where cattle drivers would weigh their stock. They were crafty to set it up high because by the time they drive them the rest of the way off the mountain they lose a lot of weight and therefore money. The push for trimpi shelter was rough, not in an elevation way. The terrain was constantly going through rocky areas with sketchy footing and required more stamina which waned fast. I was spent when I reached the shelter and got water ate, hung my food and read some book but was OUT at nine.","Thomas knob

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609101,"Woke up at 0400 and couldn’t sleep. Hasn’t happened since before Blood Mountain. So... I started hiking in the dark. It is intimidating, but when you’re a carnivore AND a hiker, even bears see you as top of the food chain. I guess I should say omnivore. Vegetables are crucial because they are alkaline and meat is acidic, therefore keeping a happy PH balance in the stomach when mixed together.The trail is deathly quiet and for a long time of easy hiking only my rustling clothes make noise, along with the trickling streams. People are always confused when they catch up to me because I leave so early. I get up early to see more of the hike, not less. As I cross a bridge this morning there is a sign educating on stream life. I stop to read it through the frost on the fiberglass. It tells me that Virginia rivers are comprised of free stone (round movable) and sand stone (stationary stair-stepping). Brook trout are native to Appalachian Mountains whereas rainbow are from out west and brown are from Europe. All thrive and are indications of healthy water.Eventually the big red sun rears it’s warm head and I can turn my headlamp off and pick up the pace.The bus to Marion makes special trips to the visitors center if you call. The next bus is at 1100 so I have two hours to nerd out on all the information they provide. I ended up buying a book that will help me identify trees, and was amazed at how many oaks there were!In town I finally get some Chinese food, and hit ingles for a resupply. There is 13oz andouille sausage on discount for 1.69 so I get all four. The weight doesn’t register until later. That plus four apples and some more dry dinners made for a heavy pack. Worth it.The bus was able to get me back to trailhead as well and I started off in the woods. Taking my time because I had already hiked 10 miles that morning. The big break in the middle of the day made the next miles easy if not for the rocks. Also it had been awhile since the trail shot straight up the mountain instead of switch backs. I appreciate the challenge. I remember one thought that randomly came to me and it’s not my own. God gives me all the tools I need, even with failure due to lack of a tool. Because that failure IS the next tool.Chatfield Shelter is right next to the creek and I struggle to find a good bear hang. I get a good one in the end, and go about cooking sausage and roasting garlic hoping someone shows up to share with. Apparently whenever I cook on the fire I will end up solo. I eat half the sausage and apples and settle in for the night.","Trimpi Shelter

And I have been having trouble getting stones in my shoes because I don’t wear pants. So I improvised some gaiters out of ingles bags for now. Virginia is a lot of ridge walking so far, and it’s nice because of the breeze. Today is a lot of fields and farmland with woods in between. Large clear blue green creeks creating snake like paths. Did I say snake? ‘Tis the season. I saw a chipmunk out surveying his log, so surely a snake will soon be surveying that log as well. Sure enough a journal entry from the 23rd states a snake sighting. I was guessing April 3rd for some reason.Halfway through the day I do my usual stop wherever that be, and today it was with a good view from the woods out into farmland. I heard some rustling and sure enough four tiny deer grazing at the bottom by the creek. I watch them for awhile and they have funny mannerisms when they think they are alone. Randomly jumping and running around. Much like myself I guess.I do my evening routine and finally admit to myself that I dislike the spectra cord I use for bear hang. It bundles up too easy. Other gear that I have found useless is an odor proof bag, and deuce of spades. Odor proof bags are just someone cunning enough to sell you an overpriced zip lock. Deuce of spades is just silly. I tried to use it twice and it wouldn’t cut tiny roots and is flimsy. My hummingbird tentstake digs a much better hole.

Last night I polished off the meat and stayed up till around ten. The trail is easy and I’m grateful for the rock free trails. The beginning follows a creek and out of the bank falls a sleepy bumblebee trying to find his wings.
I realize I don’t keep a positive attitude on perfect days as well. I’m accustomed to chaos and can’t help to be a little weirded out about everything being just fine. At least I’m aware of that about myself, I used to sabotage the good things I had going so I could feel normal again. Now I just accept that it’s okay to be happy. 
The Star Wars bird is a black crested chickadee. I also have made many more blunders trying to identify things via internet. No yellow birches, they have hairy leaves, I mistook paper birches for those. It’s so nice to have the materials in hand to look at.
Halfway there is a pond with some refreshing spring water and I meet Co-op. I forget about people reading my journal entries and knowing who I am, but he’s the second hiker to know me from this site. Later on I see him a last time at chestnut knob which is another thing I was misinformed about. Like roan mountain it has four walls and a door and it’s NICE. Wish I was staying there. Someone wrote on the wall “The Journey is not to find but accept yourself”. Finally something mature and enlightening. Normally it’s like “smoke weed” or something else useless. So thank you Atlas I think. 
I wasn’t going to have a fire but the male mosquito was out in force. So I created a smoldering fire for the smoke to eat in peace. I ate three meals to drop weight and prepare for a possible long day. I have the whole shelter to myself for the third night and firelight yoga was just what I needed.","Knot maul Shelter

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609249,"Today as usual, I’m confused why the day before was so hard. It’s just insanity and now I’m clear. Got on the trail as soon as it was visible and was light in pack and heart.Today pace is easy and I have my book out and realized at this elevation there are two pines. White and yellow. Also, analyzing oak leaves on the ground and finding there’s a wide array. But I couldn’t put leaf to tree that way. When there was a dead oak that had fallen in my path it was great that it still had leaves on it. I look forward to new growth because that will provide definite identification. Even with stopping and looking at trees I do ten miles in four hours. I am looking at a tree when I hear a turkey proudly calling out from the next ridge, and I fail to sneak up to get a look on the thick bed of baked-dry leaves. I hear him clamoring off in the distance and all is quiet again. A songbird gives a small thanks for the silencing of the opera singer.Coming down the trail I run into section hikers. In the last four days they make the fifth and sixth person I’ve seen. One of them is from Vermont and hopes to see me up there but I forget to get his name. I get so caught up in the conversation itself and forget the important things. I haven’t looked at a weather forecast since amicalola and it’s pretty cool how accurate one can be from just paying attention. Male mosquitoes are most annoying before rain and the temperature changes are hard to miss. I can see how these sections could be boring and give the “blues” but I find more and more to be excited about. I think of the phrase “not seeing the forest for the trees” and it’s funny to me. Since I have been investing in my relationship to the woods, I really see the forest because of trees. Once I get pretty comfortable identifying trees it will be something else, there is so much! There is life everywhere. Dandelions are busting forth in groups and are the primary food sources for bees waking up. I am struggling with my will to go to church but it’s not panning out under my power. It’s frustrating, one would think god would give me the strength to pull two 33 mile days for a good cause. Well I prayed about it.At the halfway point today there is a place open not on my awol guide. It’s called brushy mountain outpost and a good place for short order food and temporary resupply. I got their burger and it was a basic cheeseburger with a lb of fried baloney on it. Also got the Cajun fries. What I didn’t realize is that when leaving I was loaded up on salty food and water would be nonexistent for the next 15 miles. I mixed the rehydration tablets in the liter I did have. In my opinion things like Gatorade just make one thirstier. After the first three miles I drank everything I had. After five I was concerned. At ten I deeply considered hiking down the side to find some. At this point my mouth is so dry I have slowed down and breathing through my nose. I started losing willpower and becoming a little distracted. This section also lacks landmarks (and water sources) to determine how far I have gone. All in all I   admit I made a mistake and was really spoiled by the rain, and was ignorant to Virginia ridges. I hear it gets worse on up. I remember a point where I was so frustrated and just realized my attitude shifting to negative and upon admitting my mistake to myself smiled and laughed knowing god would provide. Unfortunately I have been way more dehydrated in the past, and was nowhere near my limit. Not that that’s okay.When I finally make it to the shelter I grab my bottles and wearily stumble and mumble like a man from the desert down the blue blazed switchbacks to the water source. My awol said it’s reliable. But when I can see where the creek will be I can’t hear it and think “surely it’s not dried up?!” It was. I started to get a little sad from fatigue and failure and just gave up in a good way. I say, god... please in the name of Jesus make water come forth from these rocks that I may quench my thirst. I am filled with hope and feel I should walk up the creek bed. There is a tiny puddle and a mere dripping off some leaves I stick my water bottle under and wait for a good gulp to accumulate. That gave me the strength to build a delivery system from the available water and with some time drank half a liter and acquired one and a half more. Upon returning the guys pointed out another blue blaze and closer, and more available water source on the other side. I was grateful for the whole experience though. I didn’t realize but I am already amber from the sun and have distinct tan lines from trekking pole straps. No wonder I’m so thirsty, the moisture was being sucked out in the summer like weather. Walking too far without proper hydration killed the possibility of distance today, and therefore church. Then Underdog called the hostel nearby to let them know he was coming in in the morning and I found out the guy who runs it was taking hikers to church at 915!

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609283,"Was only gonna hitch a ride to church and my day just blossomed. After a very short walk (with many water sources on this side of the mountain) we hit a paved road and hung a right. I’m following the lead of Magic Mike and Underdog. Underdog knew the way because he stayed last year, otherwise there is no advertising on the trail like all the other hostels. It’s pretty country except someone is throwing beer cans out the window on their drives through. I assume it’s the same person because they are all the same brand.Lickskillet hostel is an old church converted into a living space. Everything is orderly and well equipped with food and drinks, books, couches, tv, a pool table, you name it. I go to take a shower and it’s very surprising to find a tankless water system in a small shack. I’ve never used water on demand and I love it. It is able to operate on the propane tanks you grill with and apparently gets two weeks of 15+ people taking showers per tank.When I get back I meet Mango. I always build people up in my head by voice and things I already know and am always surprised at the actual person. He is built strong and has a big smile which takes his eyebrows with it. He’s cooking sausage and eggs and prepares the table for us. It’s very homey and it’s really great to sit at the table and get to know people over a meal like old times. There is three section hikers with us, two have been hiking Appalachia from Costa Rica for three years and this may be their last.Eventually those two, magic mike and I pile into Mangos car to go to Legacy church in Wythfield VA. Like most churches there is music to begin with and following that is the sermon. Today I am re educated on the armor of god. More of apostle Paul’s work. In early recovery the armor of god was very important to me because it’s used in spiritual warfare and is all symbolic. To don these things is to have a change of heart and lifestyle and then a foundation of truth and courage can be used against that self talk which tries to dismantle our growth through faith. All are significant and crucial and operates as a whole. Every pastor puts the armor with different metaphors for the same thing, basically we are set aside not of this world and through the word are established in love and righteous and have all been given a measure of faith even if we don’t feel those things. That’s normal because none of those things come from us but god. On the way back the couple treats us to subway and we pick up stuff for dinner and I’m invited. At that point everybody is such good friends I’m locked in for the evening.I forgot to mention our other member, Mister, that is Mongos dog. He’s very stoic and polite, doesn’t beg but yogis (asking without asking) a back rub. After the long game of trust building I break his shell and get him fighting with me or playing tug of war and he gets so out of character zipping around having a good ol’ time. I love dogs, god I love them.I also find a book I hope to carry with me by Mitch Albom, author of Tuesday’s with Morrie, and this one is Have a Little Faith. So far he has me very interested and I’m fond of his journalism style writing, from reading Tuesday’s with Morrie. They are very similar, very captivating, to the point. He lets you inside the spoken and not spoken parts of his thoughts.I’m also educating myself on Latin pronunciation and have been spelling things right but absolutely butchering the word when spoken.To sum everything up I’m glad I didn’t speed up to make life happen, I was slowed down. Noted. It’s like Ferris Beuller said, “life happens fast, if you don’t stop to take a look around every once in awhile, you’ll miss it”","Jenny knob Shelter

I was thinking later how dogs show unconditional love and the word dog is a reflection of god... coincidence?Started out today feeling great making great time. All of a sudden when heading downhill my calf locked up on me. I tried to walk it off but it just got tighter. So I sat down and got my book out hoping it would pass if I waited a bit. Magic Mike gave me his number as he passed in case things got out of control. I’m glad he knew I wasn’t trying to fool anyone. Later I got up to pee and I was no better so I took some vitamins and started to walk for a water source to hydrate even more. As I was walking the other leg started to get tight, I exclaimed that this couldn’t be happening. I ate a ton of sugar last night and this morning and had been drinking coffee so it was a water and nutrition problem. My liver never has been back to 100% since all the abuse anyway and when I eat too much sugar I have had horrible cramps before but the calves were a new one.I got to the point where I was hardly able to go anywhere at all both legs were tight and getting tighter. It was painful. I finally made it to water but not before I had a mental breakdown. It was a very humbling experience not being perfect and in control. I can’t just eat what I want anymore and I really need to take better care of myself. I really think I have some crazy notion that I’m so powerful and basically invincible when I don’t check my ego. This brought me to my knees. I admitted how weak I was and I needed spiritual help (eating sugar and coffee is a drug and coping mechanism for issues not dealt with, for me). I apologized for the many times this trip I forced my life in a certain direction. All the times I lost focus and loved the power of control. I’m nothing. I’m human, and no better than anyone and I cried a very good cry letting go of the stronghold being tough had on me. I limped around slowly until I guess the vitamins and water finally started having effect. I was no longer locked up but very very sore. Travel the rest of the day was bearable.I had contacted a friend that visited Asheville for a meeting that was from Virginia and we had roughly planned on meeting in pearisburg around 6. I ended up being able to meet with him ten miles before that instead. We drove all the way to Blacksburg VA to set up a meeting. It’s so cool going to meetings all over the place. Afterwards me and my friend and a third go watch Artic, a movie about a man surviving in the harsh climate and getting rescued.

Or maybe I just couldn’t put off the sausage and eggs any longer...It’s fun crashing with someone on paleo/keto diet, because it’s not weird to them to eat a breakfast of only meat. We crushed all but three pieces of sausage and six eggs. We talked about the unconditional care that people had given us in the past even when we were at our worst and talked about how crazy people can be sometimes to think someone like me or him would ever change. However once we got clean, it was those memories of those people that really helped us stay on track. Also talked about how people do that especially to this day as well. We were riding around in both his bosses cars in the time we hung out, without him around. We took the truck back to the trailhead. It was good to actually follow up on my saying if I was ever up this way I would hit him up. We may try to meet up again near Catawba which is actually close to Blacksburg.Back on the trail it is a short walk before I meet Wow. He has a trail journal as well under Monarch and Wow. He is from Australia originally from England. He did search and rescue for many years and was really pleasant to talk to. When we first met he goes oh... so you’re B... and I’m thinking “what does he mean by that?” but the answer surprised me. He told me he had been given a message. He said Brother Tom said he wishes you well and will be praying for you, gosh I hope that’s accurate. Brother Tom! For some reason he felt the inspired to relay a message that would encourage me 300 miles away. Unbelievable. It worked. Absolutely warmed my soul. I hope to travel with Wow some more. I thought I was behind the brothers after a Nero at lickskillet and whatnot but I saw them as I neared the town. That’s good news I hope to see their journey through. There was also Mouse, but she was going about 4.5mph downhill to make pizza buffet on time.Soon I would be meeting up with a referral of my friend that met me in hot springs and roan mountain. It’s his roommates’ parents in Wolf Creek VA. I have no idea they look like or what to expect but I trust Rob. When I meet Joe the first thing I notice is he has a built van that you can travel in. Then I meet him. Everything goes well and conversation easy. I say bye to the brothers and my journey into the unknown hospitality begins again. Well. They have dogs, and live in a van to go do photography. I think we’ll get along. The dogs are Doug and Lava and they are Ridgebacks. Lava is still kind of new and weird with company but me and Doug get along well. They have 50 acres of foothill property and great views of the ridge parallel to the one I came in on. I get a shower, laundry, hamburger, two hot dogs, and fries for dinner then we hang out and watch a cool veterinarian program on the tube and talk about all things. The last time we let the dogs out before bed, we found deer grazing in the front yard. It’s very nice here and yet another fun experience.

One was how my dad was a drunk (to my knowledge he still is) but I cared for him (which I try to convince myself I don’t) and told him to quit his shenanigans or it would kill him (and it very well could)
I have to remind myself there is no one that can’t be changed. Other than the stressful parts, the sleep was deep and replenishing. Mr Shrader asked me what I wanted for breakfast and I actually replied meat. So he was a little more specific by asking eggs? Bacon? Yes. That and French pressed coffee and the good mornings from everyone except Lava. She still wanted me to know that she was unsure about me by being vocal. She was starting to warm up to me by trying to get to her heart through her stomach. I know that works for me.
Then soon enough it was time to go. I got a group photo with everyone but the photographer Mrs Shrader and I know Doug wasn’t looking at the camera because he was toying with my hand hoping to play. But Lava actually stood with us without seeming to worry about me as much anymore. We were almost friends.
Resupply at Walmart is always a challenge because they have everything. I remembered that I wanted to start eating better so I didn’t get any sweets. I got some bone broth and turmeric and ramen and hotdogs and 40oz of PBR (short for peanut butter, late April fools ma) an apple and two green bananas. Oh I got garlic potatoes and tuna as well. So still some processed some starchy but it’s not pop tarts and cookie dough so progress.
The only thing the whole visit was gonna cost me was a photo. This was a very cheap price for all the hospitality they shared. After a picture at the trailhead I was back on the trail. First stop was pearisburg cemetery where I found the grave stones of two one year olds from early 1900s and people born early 1800s except pearis himself he was later 1700s.
The trail back to the ridge was gentle and sloping. My right knee has a bit of pain in it so I take it slow. I said I thought snakes would be out April 3rd so I was looking pretty hard for one. Go figure that when I was daydreaming I would actually see one. It was a good sized garter snake basking in the rocks in the middle of the trail. He let me take a picture and didn’t really try to run anymore as I passed. I think he knew I would respect him. 
When I came up on rice field I couldn’t get over how cool it is and how it really brought out the beauty of the day. So as I ate lunch and looked at the rest of the day I slowly made up my mind to do less. Go against my normal drive. It was twelve miles to the next shelter and reliable water source and I would be walking in rain all weekend so... I’m gonna soak up sunshine and probably finish Have a Little Faith. I’ll probably sleep right here in this field overlooking the whole state of West Virginia it seems. Seeing minimal instability in the atmosphere. Staying put feels right.","Narrows road

However I have decreased my sugar intake and I have symptoms of detox. Hard stressed dreams, and I’ve gnawed a pretty good hole in my lip that I’m trying to mindfully let heal. Yesterday I basked in the sun and actually got burned and finished three quarters of Mitch’s book which is incredible. Between the sunburn and my lip I am reminded that healing is a painful process. I’m grateful to now be aware that it’s ok to hurt, to be present with it, identify it for what it is, and just let it be. My friend Matt brought that to my attention... the difference between let it go and let it be. I’ve come to the conclusion that letting be is more successful because sometimes our ego can trick us about letting stuff go. In reality we can build a wall and convince ourselves it doesn’t exist, whereas letting be, we acknowledge and accept it and ultimately move on.Shortly on the trail I am tested on this wonderful beautiful day. I’ve been picking up trash after three people, they are named by the trash they leave behind. Stinger, jolly rancher, and now snickers. After the second snickers wrapper I use a lot of energy finding a way to not have a resentment, rather waste a lot having one. A resentment is where you swallow poison and hope the other person gets sick. First piece I tell myself it fell out of bag or pocket, second piece is harder. Finally I just remind myself that not everyone is working on themselves and there are self centered people that are ignorant to the whole concept of other people existing. I also become grateful for the opportunity to be humbled. As easy for them to throw the trash down I can pick it up, providing the possibility for someone to experience what I can’t unfortunately, a wild, trash free, scenic trail. Me providing for someone else helps me to let it be. I’d hate to miss the journey because I’m stuck on how angry I am with someone who has no idea.There is a lot of integrity in Leave No Trace. I could cut switchbacks and put my trash in compost buckets but I don’t because I hold myself accountable. It’s finally hot enough to get in the water! I love cold soaking because it sucks to make myself do, but I always feel brand new after. This particular time it was double cold and even slightly painful due to sunburn. When I arrive at the shelter I do my usual routine and settle in solo for the night. I finish the final portion of my book and this is my favorite section.“I knew depression was real, and in many cases required medical attention. I also know we overused the word. Much of what we call ‘depression’ was really dissatisfaction, a result of setting the bar impossibly high or expected treasures that we aren’t willing to work for” -Mitch Albom.That quote doesn’t do the book justice there is nuggets of insight and wisdom throughout.

Can I?It’s still warm early on and I started off too bold. By the time I layered up I never did quite warm back up and my hands stayed numb. Preparation makes all the difference in dangerous weather. A chilly rain is more dangerous than most weather because of the slow fade into hypothermia. I kept an eye on the signs though. Like uncontrollable shakes, never had those but shivered some. Mostly just had to keep moving. Trying to decide if I want to pick up rain pants. Definitely need gaiters.I ran into a flip flopping hiker named Trigger. He’s trying to hike to an event with his wife in savanna GA but says he’s not on schedule at the moment and keeps getting held back. It will work out regardless. Unfortunately many things are concealed in the fog but I couldn’t miss the biggest oak in Virginia. The keffer oak is massive and I kept having to back up to get a picture of it. It would probably take three to four people to be able to connect around it’s trunk.Shortly after this my stomach dropped a bit because I saw a snickers. But then I realized it wasn’t trash, it was a whole bar. Snickers has a genuine hole in something! Glad I did not get resentful and this was payday for practicing spiritual principles. I finally made it to Niday and it was still early but the next shelter would have put me at 28 miles, so I decided to stay. The cold made my knees feel more sore than usual. There was a high school group here and we ended up getting acquainted. I helped them hang their food and we dried gear over the fire. Later we played a card game called ‘president’ and I don’t remember having so much genuine fun with a group since working as a wilderness guide doing these things. Luckily they had tents and I got another spoiled night of having most the shelter to myself except thier gear and a section hiker that came in late.

I got up and ate breakfast of plain oatmeal and peanut butter, and am getting hungry enough to enjoy it. After that comes coffee and then my mixture of turmeric. I’ve been trying to soak the pepper in the turmeric a little bit longer before drinking it. I was packed and ready to go before the others but everyone was up at least and I thanked them for their fun and games. It’s a group of friends that hike every spring break since freshman year. They have a strong group.The trail early on is excellent. It’s paved flat with pine needles and slowly switching up the mountain makes for a good warmup and easy elevation gain. Or at least easy now. I reflect on how much I hike and overlook how I think about it. “Oh that’s only eight more miles” Wait. What?? In the backside of the mountain I was having one of my many conversations with myself and I practically walked into two young deer. When they startled me I was ten feet away. Cute little guys. I see deer about every day now when I leave early enough. The way they jump through the woods is as if they have to yield to a gravity not of this world. So graceful and quiet for something running away.Naturally I started paying more attention. I saw birds and a lizard. The lizard was a trigger to start looking for snakes. I probably have already walked past a few but never saw any. Sometimes certain sticks scare me in their resemblance.Right after pickle shelter which was my halfway point the trail eventually started to get rocky and less maintained. A local man was excited to see a thru hiker because he plans to hike upon retiring. He warned me about the crowd At Dragons Tooth, which is why he was hiking up the less traveled side. It was pretty crowded. From there to the shelter tonight I have probably seen more people than the rest of the trail put together. When looking out at the view, I think once more that Virginia Looks like it was covered in water in the past, not glaciers. I don’t know why I think that. I am pretty low on food and was going to resupply at Catawba grocery but I went to the wrong road to go there without a car. I was pretty bummed because I was drooling about all the things I could get. I was pretty hungry, I even caught myself speculating about how much meat a bear would provide.Had hiked the last little bit with a few people in front and got talking with one of them. They explained their plans to triple crown which is dragons tooth, mcafee knob, and a ridge I forgot. Doing the AT I will see them all regardless. In the parking lot one of the guys offers me pizza and accept. I love how nobody eats the peppers or garlic sauce. I do. We all hike to the shelter and I’m amazed at how many people are there. It’s a school and they all have tents. I get like four more slices of pizza offered and cooked them a bit over the fire. Heaven. I talked at the fire with students and teachers and now in the shelter with three thru hikers and a lovely golden retriever.","Niday Shelter

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609861,"This morning I had a good laugh. It was still dark and a group was hiking up to Mac Uh Fee knob, but had no idea what the shelter was. They were coming around to investigate and josh, one of the teachers let out a sound like a bobcat from his tent, and sent them running. I was able to score some pizza for breakfast along with the last of my oatmeal and peanut butter. Said goodbye to everyone, I plan on sending those boys a card at some point, I love what that school has going on. They will be hiking the whole Allegheny Trail in the near future. Nine boys hiking 330 miles.On my way out I ran into ridge runners. They ask me questions, but I ask them more. One was full time and he needed a bachelors degree and one was working the McAfee section for the seven month season, and said he was lucky to get his foot in the door. I asked what the job description was for the day and he replied “talking to day hikers and try to educate people on Leave No Trace, but if we can just draw the line at having them stay on trail, I’m happy”The rest of my triple crown experience was hidden in the mist. Tinker cliffs was starting to clear out. I did have a pretty special experience with a family coming down from McAfee. The family: mom-Extra, dad- Mule, son- Crabby Apple. It was the sons first hike and he was having a great experience and was hoping to meet a thru hiker. So I got to answer his and moms questions and then they gave me some food they had left which was greatly needed.Today was a day of dogs. Golden in the shelter, mutt, chocolate lab, Australian Shepard/poodle, Australian Shepard, two pit bull rescues, and another chocolate lab. As I neared daleville I got excited seeing day hikers, because the last ten mile stretch was insanely long.In town I called the hotel and they could do a single for 60 dollars and something else for ten dollars more. So I was gonna think about it. Then I walked to Kroger and resupplied. My dinner was decent mix of healthy unhealthy. I saw a tray of sticky buns covered in pecans and had to have it. With cottage cheese. That was dinner, and those two together were magic. Resupply was muesli, raisins, 12 ramen, potatoes of all flavors and tuna of the same. Then the biggie was I picked up 64 oz of peanut butter this time around. Kroger doesn’t have the cheap 40s like Walmart. All in all it was an even 34$ with donation to breast cancer awareness. When I was out downsizing all the boxes and bags and eating my sticky buns and cottage cheese, sundown showed up. We talked for awhile and I watched his stuff while he grabbed ice cream. He said he was going to the next shelter and that made my mind. It was hard as heck to crawl up the mountain for five more miles with a full pack in a drizzle, but now that I’m in the shelter I wouldn’t have it any other way. The town lights are spread out below, and the fresh air is so nice. Supposed to storm which should be soothing to listen to from the safety of the shelter.","John springs shelter

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609952,"This morning I had to invest some time in stretching and getting ready. The balls of my feet were sore and my fascia were tight. My knees had a raw feel and I definitely injured my left knee in the past because it’s always threatening to give me trouble. I found that doing leg exercises from the back is excellent. It’s a no pressure way to get the kinks out and a stomach exercise. Also I have a satisfactory pop in both my knees eventually which I always take as a good thing. Then I moved on to some more dynamic exercises and eventually got to a point where I felt somewhat normal again. This 64oz tub of peanut butter is pretty outrageous. Now that I’m fed and content again I have rational food brain, and this is a lot of peanut butter. If I played my cards right I believe I could go 100 miles on this alone. Oh well, it’s my small baby to carry now. I have to put it in the middle of my food bag so it sits right in my pack.Hiking today is peaceful to begin with. The storm never came. It became pretty hot actually. I took it slow and took a break after 6 miles and a guy named Superhero41 came up and joined me for lunch (we were at a shelter) after talking about this and that he offered me snickers bars. I told him I picked up one of his snickers possibly, he immediately told me he doesn’t litter. I told him that I meant a whole snickers, at the keffer oak. He said he took a picture there and it was possible. I ended up hiking with him and sundown all the way to a shelter. Swapping stories. On the way to the shelter the skies finally opened up and gave us a belated storm with the works. Fat, cold droplets and lightning bolts. We weren’t in it long before finding haven in the shelter with two other section hikers. I had cold soaked my dinner and ate and took a nap. When I got up the now named Tapeworm Brothers, Mad Dash and T had arrived. Haven’t seen them since pearisburg. Now foods up and it’s raining again, hopefully it will be that soothing sleep machine I was hoping for last night.","Fullhardt knob

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610038,"I love all the extra daylight. Can get on trail at 0800 and leisurely do twenty miles. This morning the main plan was to get to the ten mile mark that boasted a swimming hole. I hear it a lot but maybe today will be the elusive 70 degrees and sunny. On my way I passed a section hiker  named Cobweb that gave me the low down on everything north. Hiking today was great. It brought back memories of Georgia, or would have... had I seen any sunshine in Georgia. The aqueducts were full and water was flowing down the seams in the mountain sides. Also the terrain was up and down, about half and half Jacobs ladder style climbing and switchbacks. Otherwise following the parkway like this just reminds me of the Mountain to Sea Trail. Many sections you are following alongside the road.When I finally got to the water hole I ate an early lunch and went about agitating my socks and wringing them till the water ran clear...ish. A fisherman came up to talk, and once he realized I was going Georgia to Maine said it must be nice not having to work. I laughed and said “oh, it’s work”. Before, during, and I expect after. After may be the hardest work. Trying to live in a world that runs on a different engine than food, water, shelter, companionship. There’s all the unnecessary stimulation. Distraction. That’s in the future and I will cross that bridge then. After cleaning I laid all my clothes out and laid out myself because it was overcast sunny so not good enough to get in. After about two hours the sun came out in force for a window of about an hour and a half. I took a swim and even the Brothers got in the water. Then we dried out in the sun and looked at our day. We decided we had time to get a shuttle to the campground nearby that did short order food and milkshakes. I broke down and got a milkshake. Riding in the back of a truck was fun there and back and then we hit the trail again. There are some steep climbs in this part and some really pretty pine forests. There are a dozen thick trees that have been cut out of the path, so recently they still smell fresh. We reach Bryant shelter which is the most epic shelter yet, but the brothers are pushing for Glasgow tomorrow and I want to go with them so I left them and hiked to this shelter. It gets most the climbing out of the way and there is apple orchard falls 1.1 mile off trail that is apparently a two hundred foot waterfall so I gotta drop pack and see that. All in all we should arrive around the same time because they are fast. I’m using my hammock for the first time in forever, it’s so comfy. The wind is blowing and the stars are bright.Kemo, thanks for your concern and voicing it. I’ve considered all the things you had to say and I worry about the same things. But I guess I’m not descriptive enough sometimes, for McAfee I just said it was hidden in mist, but the reality was that there was nothing to see all day that day. Even the day hikers that went up at 0430 were coming back disappointed. Grayson Highlands was a fog too, you win some you lose some. I even ate a really early lunch (the trail magic food) to try and give tinker a chance to clear out. That being said if I am blessed with good weather through the priest then I will stop and take it in.","Bobblets Gap Shelter

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610151,"Just having made my last entry, I was lying in the hammock staring at the stars when I heard footfalls in the woods. I couldn’t tell if it was coming from my left or right, then with a jolt I realized it was directly behind. And closing in. I listened for a bit to try and guess the creature. It had an awkward gait, and not too heavy. Not a squirrel. Those actually sound like Bigfoot walking in the woods. I assumed it was a deer, but was mentally prepared for my first whatever encounter. It was the tiniest deer yet. I think I made it temporarily blind because I spotlighted it and it pretty much stayed where it was but was looking for a new route. I kind of miss my section of zlite that u used to supplement my xlite with in the hammock because I sleep in a ball in the hammock mostly and fall off my insulation in places. On the trail I  went to an overlook and then to apple orchard falls. 177 man made steps and 700ft down you are brought to a 200ft waterfall. Well worth the trip. On the jog back up, me and mad dash got in the water.The rest of the trail was beautiful with many views of the James or walking along creeks. Buds are blooming and blueberry bushes getting leaves as well.  Down next to the James the beavers had chopped trees down. Flowers of all kinds and many creeks draining into the river. The James river bridge is the longest footbridge only of the AT. I tried to hitch a ride to Glasgow and had no luck so I went to the shelter. Which was nice because a overnighter named Chris hooked me up with hotdogs and chips and bacon and m&ms in the morning.","Cornelius creek shelter

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610243,"Like I said, this morning would start off with bacon on a stick. Excellent breakfast along with the usual peanut butter. I say thanks to Chris and head up the mountain. It’s switchbacks which I have come to love. The craggy terrain and Virginia pine, along with the heat makes me always on the outlook for snakes. Everyday I see a new flower or greenery, and now the trees are budding except the oaks. The eastern redbuds stand out as well as the service berries, with the purple and white. As I crest Little Rocky Row, I can see all the way back to the soccer ball looking FAA tower on thunder ridge. I can see the route that I took down the mountain to the James river bridge. Big Rocky Row had a good view but was limited to straight ahead. On top of bluff mountain I took a long break and all the people from town showed up, and billy Goat is back as well. So we all took off down the mountain and had lunch off a road with a trash can and I was able to polish off the peanut butter and get rid of that weight. After I left there it was a good solo experience with a lot of down but easy travel. Brown mountain creek was a town where freed slaves established themselves and you can still see remnants of their small town. I was really tired so I did my chores including ice bath and yoga then laid down early like 1800 and didn’t have any trouble falling asleep.","Johns hollow shelter

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610247,"Woke up right at midnight, wide awake. I laid there for thirty minutes but my heart was pounding. No idea why. I knew it was supposed to rain so I decided to take off. It was about 0100 when I left and the moon had just set. For awhile I follow the river then it turns up a hill that eventually leads to the road for buena vista. After that is the beginning of the trek to the top of Bald Knob. It is switchbacked, but steep and steady. I saw two deer and a rodent of some sort. After I crested the wind picked up, and fog rolled in. The next two peaks were not difficult but with opaque fog and complete darkness it was hard to even see the ground at my feet. There is a section where you’re in a field so some was guesswork. Then if I wasn’t stressed enough as it was I started to feel dizzy and bonked on energy. So I sat in the dark and  ate raw ramen til I felt better. I admitted to myself that I was scared which helped too. I couldn’t hear or see anything, was worried I was off trail. I was wasting tons of energy lifting my feet higher than normal to avoid tripping. Soon as I got back on a single track in the woods I was relieved. Shortly I found a small outcropping of rock perfectly positioned against the wind and mist and I hunkered down there. Was even able to hang my bear bag off a lip of the granite ceiling. I slept there til about 0730 and laid there for another hour listening to the rain, glad for my hideout. After that I knew it was time to go. The last stretch to the shelter was very foggy and quiet and wet, but I could see the trail.It’s nice to have my miles done by 1130 and I’m anticipating another visit from my ma and stepdad.

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610431,"This morning I was in no rush but I could not sleep in. The rain had finally cleared out and the section hikers were getting ready to leave. One of them gave me a Clif bar for breakfast, because I had unintentionally yogi’d for food last night. Billy told me I could use a rock he found to hang my food and I said I had no food to hang. Many hours later dinner was started and I could smell the mountain house gourmet meals. When I arrived at the shelter I ate a ton of potatoes and ramen to polish off my food, but by 1700 or so I was hungry again. After bonking out on Cole Mountain (Cold Mountain to locals) I realize starchy foods just don’t sustain me like proteins. Anyway I was just laying there and one of the section hikers asked “you said you don’t have ANY food?” I said no and told him about my big meal earlier but he just summed it up to “are you hungry?” I couldn’t help but say I’m pretty hungry, especially with the smells. He gave me a bar and so did the other two. I was so grateful. Hikers give magic too.It was a short hike to Spy Rock Rd. Luckily I had service enough to tell my family not to come up that road because it was rocky and there was no good room for turning around. Later I was even more relieved when I saw the whole rd was gated off as a private community. So if anyone gets off trail to go to Montebello, be prepared to walk the mile down to Fish Hatchery Rd. My family set their clocks wrong the night before so they accidentally set out an hour early. And as soon as I reached the gate (I was early, going to dry gear in the sun), they were pulling up. Absolutely perfect timing. The rest of the day was the same.The hotel wasn’t ready yet so we went downtown Lexington to Walkabout Outfitters where a girl named Jess gave excellent service helping me pick out gaiters and a lighter jacket. I still don’t know how I feel about it, only shaved five ounces. I dropped my base weight to 9 lbs or better, creating a little challenge. Lighter means more uncomfortable. There are a few other changes I want to make like getting a mens xlite short.Then we ate Chinese buffet and went to check in at the hotel. We watched The Ugly Truth which is a fun romcom. And relaxed with a shower and me doing endless organizing. Eventually it was dinner time and we went to Macados followed by small resupply from Walmart, and the on to the drive in theaters. We all hunkered in the tailgate of truck on my xlite and got a double feature of How to Train Your Dragon 2 followed by The Upside. The latter was an excellent adventure of a criminal ((Kevin Hart) and an extremely wealthy person crippled from the neck down (Bryan Cranston) who learn valuable lessons from each other. At first I wasn’t sure if they thought I was serious about going to the movies, but as the stars came out and the features played we all had a great time. Nostalgia for them, time off my feet for me.By the time we got back there wasn’t much talk and everyone was in bed fast. I was so tired I couldn’t sleep at first which happens occasionally but as I broached the realm of subconscious I was unconscious and dreaming hard.","Seeley-woodworth Shelter

I was able to get down to the buffet before it was too packed. Hotels are great with all you can use coffee, breakfast, and toilet paper. After breakfast I ran a hot bath, mostly for my feet. I haven’t ran a bath in years. It’s just not efficient. My feet bones have definitely been separating and my feet have been getting bigger. They are perpetually sore and it concerns me that hiking makes it feel better... Then I went down to breakfast again with my family and had a bit more food.I finally settled on the food that I would take with me, leaving a considerable amount still to resupply at a further date. I am so glad I did not send myself that box. I packed it before I left for the trail not knowing what I needed. It weighed like 13 lbs. I got some sprouted dehydrated lentils I made myself, nutritious yeast, couscous, date bars, almond butter, knorr rice sides, and ramen. I accidentally left a bag of vitamins and lost a second spoon to the hotel world. I have a sea to summit spork but that is an annoying piece of equipment. I don’t know who finds that useful. Pure spoons do everything.On the way back to spy road I got a little car sick, and was sad that I had to say goodbye. So at the last little bit when I was getting frustrated trying to make a rain skirt, I hope my stepdad didn’t take offense. We were rushed to say goodbye because each party was worrying about the others’ safety which is so sweet and wholesome. I know now that they made it home safe and I’m literally hunkered in a shelter with my rain fly up and my feet in a sleeping bag covered with a trash bag because the weather is so erratic. Section hikers are here with me. My chores have become so standard that it’s nice to be lazy and warm knowing the bear rope is hung and water retrieved. I really love the magic that my family provided, and it’s crazy how it happens when it’s needed most. Had a long conversation with God on the way to the shelter and even sung some authentic songs of gratitude. My new goal is to make the 2000 meeting on Main Street waynesboro Tuesday.

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610586,"I got up before dark to try and catch the sunrise, but the overlook was south of the summit and faced north, and farther down I could not get a clear view. It was a pretty sunrise regardless and I know in the future that the east-facing view is halfway down the descent from the priest. the farmland and low lying land has the green of new growth, and the mountains are spattered with it. The winds of spring are not so delicate and some of the new growth is being stripped from the trees. Just nature pruning itself. 
The views are excellent, but I had more fun today crossing the many engorged water sources. Waterfalls cascading endlessly down the mountains, and with its constant noise and the erratic noise of the wind, there is a seeming endless noise of natural power at every turn. 
I must say. I am so glad I made an investment in gaiters, even though my upcycled drybag that i cut into temporary gaiters worked great. Not having to worry about pebbles and sticks finding their way in my shoes saves so much time and energy. Today was the first day without hiking poles and I am indifferent so far. It takes me forever to decide whether I like something or not. Like my rain jacket. Its excellent, allows for ease of motion, and works well so far. My only complaint is the zipper needs remodeled. It gets stuck really easy as you zip up. The lighter pack is incredible though. The other thing I like about not having poles is I can touch things in the environment. I can grab trees, scramble on rocks, and use my hands while hiking. It also enables me to clear branches occasionally from the trail with ease.
At lunch I ate all my almond butter with a stick, and I look forward to getting a spoon in Waynesboro. Today was a weird day mileage wise because Maupin shelter made for too short a day and Paul shelter was too long. I could have camped in between but the wind is brutal and it is cold, and my bag is still a little damp from the storm so I pushed. The last eight miles were brutal, and this section of the trail has all others beat in terms of rocks. I would take tons of elevation gain/loss over a rocky trail, so naturally I'm not looking forward to the trail I keep hearing about farther north. One great thing about making alot of miles is I have a meeting at eight in the evening and only five miles to hike into town. So I can do tons of self care. 
My favorite overlook today was not even one of the big guys, Priest, Three ridges, or Humpback. It was a random overlook before Humpback and it had a rock that was literally a drop off behind it and a broad view of mountains and low land. The wind hitting me gave me a thrill that it could blow me right off the side and I had to step back some. There was also a shelter right on the creek that I wish I had stayed at. It was so pretty and in a peaceful part of the mountain. Now if I ever see so and so Creek Shelter I will make arrangements to stay there.
Upon arrival to camp I was so dead I ate a handful of legumes and hung my bear bag and fell asleep as soon as I was able to get warm.","Priest shelter

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610635,"Whew! I knew that seemed like too many miles! I added in today’s mileage on yesterday’s but it’s fixed now. Felt like 35 miles! Anyway...When I woke up this morning my feet hurt more than usual. I never mentioned it yesterday but my calves had tried to lock on me ever so slightly in the beginning of my walk, but I just ate nutritional yeast and walked it off. Not nearly as bad as last time but they did become a little sore and a little tight. Eventually I’m going to have to come to terms that I can’t eat sugar anymore. I did some stretching from my sleeping bag before getting up, including the toes and rubbing each foot with the other. Well, when I initially was walking around getting the bear bag down and such I thought I was gonna be fine. Upon hiking however, the top of my foot would have dull general or sharp direct pain depending on my step. The only thing that made it feel better was to stay as flat as possible. I walked the five miles into the gap to hitch a ride to waynesboro, failed at hitching like usual (need a female hiking partner, or I think even two people is less intimidating than one) and called about midway down the list of people offering free rides. Tom came in a red Chevy car and gave me the history of some of the buildings and showed me the points of interest. He dropped me off the library because the first thing I wanted to accomplish was to get a book. After that I went to the YMCA and got my camping permit to do free camping at a town pavilion. I went there and met Doormat, who I had been in a shelter with like 800 miles ago at Low Gap. I recognized him by his bear bag which was made from an animal feed bag. We talked and I sunbathed and read Mitch Albom’s For One More Day. Yes, another one of his. I’m hooked, he’s an incredible writer. It’s like binging on a favorite Netflix show. While I’m doing this I’m pounding seltzer water like an alcoholic. Oh I forgot to mention I made a trip to buffet and Kroger’s but stayed away from the sweets. I did eat fruit.Eventually it was 1800 and I stashed my pack at the YMCA and walked to Walmart to get a spoon before the meeting. They were the grocery only kind and I ended up getting a 16$ resupply I didn’t really need, and a disposable spoon. I was at the meeting an hour from then and ate salt and vinegar potato chips and garlic pickle spears til the chair showed. I helped her set the meeting up and it was small and intimate like they are in smaller towns. I hated those kinds of meetings at first, but grew to love them later because you’re basically forced to share or sit in silence for an hour. During all my walking without a pack my foot problem did not lessen so I finally looked it up. I’m thinking I have extensor tendinitis which can come from overly tight calves, uneven surfaces, and overuse. The only thing that didn’t apply was tight shoes. So I should have been putting my foot in the creek all day but like an invincible idiot I thought it would just go away for no reason.Basically I have three days I can stay here, I have been invited to the eight o’clock tomorrow, so if it’s something that will need time I got it. I can use an ace bandage, ice, and nsaids to help progress. If I do hike it will probably only be a shelter at a time til I’m confident it’s okay. Who knows, I just know that I’m in a critical position of needing to make crucial choices that will have long term results like completing the trail or not.","Paul Wolfe Shelter

I said goodbye to doormat and hung out for a while after he left. Eventually I got the hankering for a real cup of coffee. I hit up the French Press and for three bucks I got my Vargo Bot 700 filled twice with some quality joe. I read, I looked up things I thought about. My mom called me and asked who Mitch was, as in Mitch Albom. I had to explain to her why the most recent book made me even more grateful we have a rekindled and growing relationship after not talking to her for almost three years. The main character goes on a heavy bender and tries to kill himself and in the process of a near death experience gets to spend a whole day with is mom, where he learns about the last decade of her life that he never really saw her, but she forgives him and he learns the true power of unconditional love. Awesome stuff. Now I’m reading a book about Africa politics and a journalist trying to get the scoop of what’s really going on because social media tends to warp reality for people of each country. I’m growing to like it, it’s different. Same author as Schindler’s List. Then of course Billy Goat walks in. I give him a hug at this point. Cause, he’s practically the only person I’ve been with basically the whole time besides the brothers. We talk about altitude sickness and other random stuff then head to raid Kroger’s for lunch. I’ve been bargain shopping as always and found more bars marked half off. The next many hours are boring lazing in the sun, napping, reading, soaking my foot, stretching, and talking with Billy. Eventually we go eat buffet which I tell myself is the last time. It’s nice to have a meal with someone for a change and Billy really opens up and we have real talk. Dudes got layers and I like him. I leave him to hit a meeting and we read from one of the stories in the book and discuss a newcomers dilemma of early recovery which makes me grateful. Now I’m just going to read til I sleep and hopefully my foot feels better tomorrow. Today was hit or miss. Sometimes I’d have quick debilitating sharp pains and sometimes I could walk a hundred yards or more before I felt a twinge. One thing is for certain, it is so much better being homeless on purpose, out here getting Hispanic brown in the sun. It feels like many days in the past but it’s a choice and that makes all the difference. I got a call from one of the therapists from my summer job in Virginia and caught up. We are going to try to hike together at some point. My friend Rob hit me up with all kinds of news, and all these things have just been encouraging.

I’m able to say I’m proud of myself and able to receive it from others as well. A lot of hurdles and struggles to get to this point. 860 miles on the trail doesn’t hold a candle to the journey of the last few years, learning to forgive and love myself into a new way of life. My journey hiking is just a constant celebration of doing something that I couldn’t have in bondage. In other news Waynesboro has been a great experience. The meetings are a little different than in Asheville because they are smaller, and they rarely start on time. But in that way I’m also very comfortable because the people are relaxed and able to laugh alot. It’s easy for us to be solution oriented and tonight was my last meeting of six that I spent with them. It’s hard to say goodbye. I can’t wait to get this journey started again, and today I had no pain in my foot,  which gives me hope.","

Very slow and careful, feeling for any signs of discomfort. I only had the mildest of twinges that happened very rarely. However I still have problems with my calves tightening up. I did self care as far as the foot but my diet was pretty awful. A lot of Oreos and milk and cereal. So I’m going to make a commitment to eating better again and see if I can follow through this time.I’m actually surprised I did the miles I did today because it felt much shorter. I swear it’s easier mentally to go farther at a slow pace. I crossed Skyline Drive a few times and thought to myself that it would be an epic road bike ride with it being blocked off to traffic due to an ice storm awhile back. I had two little climbs of little and big calf mountain and now I’m at the shelter very early at 1600.

I crashed hard last night and woke up thinking it was morning at 2230 because I slept well and the moonlight was bright. I ended up just going back to sleep for rounds two through ten of intense dreams. My tarp was moist on the side that I was facing from my hammock. That was also the side not facing the morning sun so my breath may be irrelevant. Everyone but billy and a couple had already left. The lady is a smoker and continues to do so out here. Those people are kind of rare.The trail today was mostly flat and hardly ever made me tired with its slight elevation gains and losses. Great terrain because I want to continue to be cautious with my feet. I found that stepping at an angle is the only thing that irritates it. The beautiful spot on the trail today was Blackrock. It is rock made from the floor of Iapetus Ocean, which was way before Appalachia. Now what used to be a cliff is a talus slope, or river of rock, that eventually continue to break down over years and ultimately become a forested mountain like the surroundings.Even with creeping down the trail I made it to Blackrock Hut (shelter) really early. I knew that all the day hikers from last night would be going there so I decided to head on down trail. Skyline Drive being closed is just sweet because there are hardly any people and zero cars. Here at the campground the bathrooms are open and running water and trash cans. I’m gonna read til a little closer to dark and then throw a hang and a hammock and call it a night. I thanked god many times today. For Jesus and for allowing me to hike again.","Calf mountain shelter

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611143,"Today was a good day. I got a good amount of rest and made a point to be really mindful my entire day. I started off with meditation in the hammock (debatably napping) followed by a gruel of oatmeal and bone broth protein powder to break my fast. It was not tasty at all. Then I did yoga on the picnic tables before setting off. I’ve been bad about setting time aside for that. The small things in how I begin my day set the tone for the rest of it. There was a certain flow to everything. I went slow but got far. Better yet I enjoyed a heck of a lot more of it too. 
Just as I was thinking that this was the easiest trail I’ve walked so far there was a never ending series of blow downs. Now I see why they closed it off, that must have been one nasty ice storm. After the Wayside at Loft Mountain, Skyline Drive was open. So I saw many day and section hikers but it wasn’t overwhelming like Dragons Tooth. I don’t blame them, it’s absolutely beautiful out. There is a pretty steady breeze and wildflowers litter the sides of the trail. Even through a terribly burnt section, green growth was sprouting out of the remains. 
I’m elated that my foot feels fine. I was worried that a severe problem would reveal itself after hiking again. I just make extra sure not to step on uneven ground from side to side. Up and down doesn’t present any threats.
I saw deer yesterday and today and bear poop everywhere. No bear yet though. I’m really digging the hammock set up lately even with rain. It’s very comfortable and great for reading. 
So I’ve been setting intentions behind eating now. I set aside something I call “meal times”. One in the morning, midday, and evening. This, on top of actually setting a limit on the amount is causing me to get hungry in between meals and grateful for my food. Used to, I never got hungry because I ate constantly. Now just to keep it up. It takes forever to start a good habit. 
The brothers are about 40 miles ahead of me so I may not see them any time soon, but I’m just gonna be present and steady and see what life presents. Now to get off the screen and into a book.","Dundo campground

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611288,"Today was powerful. Started out with intent with meditation and yoga. I find that helps keep me from getting goal oriented and burned out.
Upon hiking today I really examined the side of me that gets complacent. “Just the same old beautiful trail” Or “oh look, the usual expansive view”. I am able to catch those thoughts and not let my mind go down that path. Instead I remind myself that rain exists and sunshine is pretty sweet just by itself. Or anything to change my perspective and make me grateful and content again. The woods are my wife and we have moved out of the honeymoon stage. Now it’s just love based on shared experiences. 
I met and talked with many people today. The longest conversation was with chad from Ohio. The way he talked about the hiking out west makes me look forward to it. Also the whites of New Hampshire. 
There are two side trails that I wish were the AT. One is called Rock Scramble but is along a ridge that you look at from below when white blazing. The other is Lewis Falls which is a hundred or so foot waterfall. Both side trails link back up on the AT later down the trail and are the same distance to my knowledge. Lewis Falls view puts the AT view to shame. 
I’m beginning to think my shoes are shot. After about 15 miles my feet ache. When I reach Front Royal they will have 500 miles on them which is a shame because the rest of the shoe is in great shape.
At the shelter I finally meet Russia and Denali her boxer that I have heard stories about. My friend sundown is a day ahead of me and trying to be in Front Royal by Thursday so no way I’m catching up. Maybe he’ll zero there Friday.","Highrock hut

Rock springs shelter has most the camping designated for revegetation however, so I slept in the shelter. Plus I was tarred. That’s southern for tired.Stayed up later than usual because a friend busted out tiny dice and we created a Yahtzee game. I won twice in such a crazy way. The dice were just in my favor. Denali snores and growls in his sleep but it didn’t bother me. His farts were bearable too... I may have been out here to long.Today the hike was PERFECT. Overcast and chilly only if you stop. Air conditioning while hiking. A constant firm breeze. I had all these great ambitions like usual, even toyed with the thought of setting a record for myself if the body permitted, but I ran into Rusha again going to a building. What’s that I asked. “Skyland they have food and coffee wanna join?” I thought about how that would mess up ‘the plan’ and immediately knew that the plan was ego run riot and a waste of my life so I agreed. I’ll come get coffee. “They also have breakfast buffet” magic words. The buffet was insane. Also sharing a meal is always a great experience, we chatted on with Denali looking in patiently.The next parts of the trail were beautiful overcast overlooks, but one section was what tinker cliffs would have been could I have seen anything. Denali bounced between being a leader and right in the middle of us. I told Rusha my concerns of not getting my mail drop on time, and she showed me an itinerary that proved I had nothing to worry about. With hiking way less miles. So we called to get picked up by open arms hostel, and Alison has good ethic and was prompt. Her house is clean and she is structured upon receiving guests into her home. Smelly stuff stays outside. Except laundry. We got clean and Alison did laundry and we got food and met other people and then watched the last episode of season seven game of thrones, followed by the two newest episodes of eight.

Sometimes I talk with Rusha, sometimes she listens to her book. Sometimes no book and no talk. The constant jingle of Denali’s collar is white noise unto itself, and makes me happy to know he’s there. Lately the trail has been mostly flat and I can look around without fear of tripping. The birch and maple trees have beautiful young leaves in them, but overall the forest is still bare. The forest floor however is bursting with green and grass and things I haven’t taken the time yet to learn about. Halfway through our day we show up at elk wallow wayside and get some short order food. Chili cheese fries for me and fries for Rusha. Any food mentioned is always tasted by Denali. Except the blackberry milkshake which is renowned but I wasn’t amazed. When throwing away my trash I found a ton of food in the trash can. There was ramen and trail mix and cereal mix, and one thing of spam. My theory is someone had just cleaned out the hiker box because there was only fuel left in there. I asked the other day hikers if they wanted any while smiling and laughing because most people are grossed out by dumpster diving. In a first world country we waste perfectly good food and it’s a shame.Rusha takes a nap and I see Wounded Bear, a friend from India that I saw my first day in Shenandoah. I invited him to our table and he ordered food and we caught up. He bought us some bananas and we also had a hiker come give us all oranges. We got back on the trail and me and wounded bear talked about where he was from and all sorts of things. He was very interested in my reasoning behind through hiking. Also asked me why I had certain gear preferences.When we got to the shelter we knew it was going to be crowded because it was early and there was already so many of us. Finally saw a ridge runner and she stayed the night after making rounds checking on the privy and other parts of the area. She was pretty cool and hiked the pct and AT. Later she showed us what ramps were and had also found some morel mushrooms somewhere but could not tell us.Wrapping up it starts to rain and me and Scrubs watch the rain put the fire out, which actually took a really long time.

Rusha and I got up a bit early and left before the rest to try and get some dry hiking in. It was foggy and misty and wounded bear came with us as well. Early on in the hike we spotted the jackpot of ramps or leeks. They are a two bladed green plant that is delicious and tastes like onions or garlic. They covered both sides of the trail so I figured we would see more later on, but we didn’t.We had some look out spots but we had the grey curtain of fog. After we breached Compton peak a wind came and suddenly the trail cleared out. Eventually even the sun came out. Me and Denali started a game where we play tug of war while hiking and did this for a mile or so. He even got to the point he would pick out a favorite stick.Today Rusha had to get her Jeep and move it to the hostel so me and wounded bear talked as we hiked the trail out. He is originally from India but does computer service or IT for a large global company in Chicago. He hiked the whole Shenandoah but never hit a hostel so I invited him to come with me to check it out. When we got there it was a historic building made into a beautiful bed and breakfast and where the hikers stayed was the old slaves quarters. He was fascinated by the hikers box and took some ramen and dehydrated vegetables mixture to try at home. We eventually made our way to the main house to meet the hosts and saw them and scrubs and her mom and dad. This is where scrubs and wounded bear leave the trail, and I learned from scrubs family her actual name. Victoria or Tori. I just called her scrubs because she wears them as bed clothes at the shelters. All six of us go and get Mexican and it’s just a wonderful period of community. Wounded bear is the first to leave us as his dad has showed up to pick him up.Later that night we continue the visit with Tori’s mom and dad Harriet and Patrick on the porch as a spring cold front blows through. They drink scotch and Harriet and I drink ginger turmeric tea that she brought. It’s strange being around responsible drinkers because I keep waiting for someone to be the first to get sloppy and it never happens. They hardly even drink and the bottle is put away with liquor still in it. Blows my mind. Eventually everyone makes their way off to bed and me and scrubs talk and watch the weather a bit longer. She is genuinely sad to leave the trail after only 100 miles and I realize she has a affinity for nature much like me. We know there is more conversation and goodbyes to be had in the morning so we go our separate ways for the night.When I get to the cabbin it’s quiet and I crawl into a cold bed that has an ac unit right above it which causes me to tank.","Gravel springs hut

Looks like I’ll be bouncing my box again. That is when you have something mailed, you can have them send it to a post office farther north if you don’t quite need it yet. It’s pretty easy to do, I was able to do it over the phone.After packing up and arranging shuttle we said goodbye to scrubs and took pictures. The weather was PERFECT when we got on trail. It was cool like the overcast days but the sun was out. The sky was sky blue and the wind was turning leaves over all day. Today the trail was flanked with white and pink trilliums all day. Apart from that I noticed that the oak leaves had come out, apparently overnight. So at least at this altitude a green canopy is forming. Today was a day of dogs and We passed a dozen dogs. A lot of people were out on a day like this. There were two shelters that were immaculate, the first had a rain barrel for showers and a horseshoe pit. The privy had two bottles of hand sanitizer and the eating area was even sheltered. The other nice shelter is the one we are at now and it is  stained and new with railroad ties for backpack holders.

Unfortunately people have carved things into the smooth skin of the birches on the trail. Redbud blossoms and young poplar leaves litter the trail.The sun is spotty and we begin the “roller coaster”. Honestly it’s just another section of the AT and a little over hyped. Beautiful however with many streams and springs.Today I crossed the 1000 mile mark and was encouraged. Something about being close to halfway makes the trail feel more accomplishable. It’s been so nice going at a steady pace and taking breaks. It’s only been a short while but I have now hung with Rusha and Denali more days consecutively than anyone on the trail so far and the rapport and friendship will be missed. I’ve learned a lot of values that I wouldn’t have being solo. I’m teaching her names of plants and ways to start fires which helps me retain that knowledge better. Denali plays so hard on the trail he is crashed out in his bag. Rusha got some gear wet so I built a nice fire and we are enjoying it. It is so different arriving at a shelter early and having down time but I like it. To the person with two years, absolutely fantastic.

So we (Rusha & Denali) decided to drop by bears den hostel. The place is a fortress with huge stone walls surrounding the stone building. I was finally able to talk to someone about visiting the hiker box. The bunks downstairs were neat and everything was orderly, it would have been a fine place to stay. I was able to score a lunch, dinner, and breakfast to last me to Harpers Ferry. Some of the people going in to stay hooked us up with bananas as well. Throughout today there are many rock views that look way out, and all the views are of mostly flat land.

There is a  small tree producing pink honey suckle style flowers that I need to research the name of. There’s always so much to look up I forget some things. We finished the roller coaster and left Virginia for the first time. I’m looking forward to leaving it for good.Virginia has been my favorite and hardest state so far if the smokies were not part of the trail. I said I would not get the blues because I loved the woods so much. After my experience coming into and leaving waynesboro, I have to acknowledge how hard I was really taking it. I feel like it was a crucible or something. But Virginia is my favorite for the weather and the people. I have a friend that just hiked through four states in one day, which is appealing but I probably need to work out new shoes before I do anything crazy.

The hammock was excellent, I was a little concerned not putting the fly up, but I woke around midnight and the clouds had left the stars to shine. After that I slept soundly. I think the xlite mattress crinkling can sound like rain and causes me to wake up if I’m worried. Early morning Denali comes to say hey with his whole body convulsing in joy. He’s very perceptive and realizes the hammock is not to dive in. It’s hard to not wake up in a good mood when he’s the first thing you encounter.Thanks for the May Apple insight. The majority of the hike is covered in them. This is a really rocky section of the trail and me and Rusha agree to be tired of the rocks after the first miles of it. (Also no coffee) But before we know it Harpers Ferry is within our sight as we cross the Shenandoah.ATC headquarters was a great experience. Dottie “.com” showed us the ropes by taking our pictures and showing us how to document ourselves into the picture book. My number was 68 so I’m happy. Keurig coffee was 50 cent and we each had two cups. There were free danish and muffins and later a woman brought pepperoni cheese stuffed rolls that were to die for. She represents A Step in Time Bakery. I signed up to be a member of Appalachian Trail Club and sent a prominent member of AA a postcard like he wished I would. Before I left I told him of my tax concerns and he found me work to do around his house to help curb the dent the IRS put in my plans. Rusha bought me a gift of Darn Tough socks that have more padding than the running version I bought in Lexington. Very grateful. Sundown was the one to do four state challenge and he got a shuttle back to Rusha’s car to bring it to us and zero at the hotel. It’s great seeing one of my old group. We toured Harpers Ferry but we were full on food but checked out outfitters. They had shoes on discount but nothing in my size. They didn’t even sell Astrals. I love Astrals but I think I got my hopes up with them to be sponsored but that’s not really realistic and they never even returned my message when I reached out. Also when you see Altras on every foot on the trail that says something. I finally got on 6pm discount shoe site and bought some altras for 70$ and sent them to Doyle Hotel in Duncannon. My feet should hang in there till then. Got a fair amount of resupply, I’ve gone back on carrying a ton all the time because less is more, and easier to ration. (Just don’t forget a day) should have plenty to make it 124 miles to my shoes.I bought a rotisserie chicken for dinner and ate the whole thing. It might be harder that I thought to keep chickens around sustainably later on... then we went out to eat and played pool. Rusha’s last night in town and she’s happy. Back at the hotel we watched season three of game of thrones which is my worldly weak spot. I read the books so I get to be a nerd.

I then thought that maybe I could actually make it through Maryland to catch up to sundown so I accepted. I knew my shoes were shot but with no weight it shouldn’t be a problem right? Wrong.The beginning started out fine. After a small breakfast with coffee at a diner I hit the trail with the mere basics. Like five of the ten essentials. Crossing the Potomac into Maryland is beautiful and I took a picture of the fence with a couple of dozen locks attached to it. Eventually there will be a wall of locks. Then it is flat gravel path for a long time. I got a sweet picture of the train engine crossing a creek, when originally I was just trying to take a picture of the creek by itself. Shortly after I found that same train blocking the trail for a minute. Like usual the climb out of town was a mirror of the descent into it like usual. We are the ones to draw lines and make borders but Appalachia is Appalachia. Them rocks though... if only the mountain was a couple of thousand years older...Anyway no real feet problems at all. The extra cushion on the darn tough seems to help a lot. At the ten mile mark I started to feel discomfort in my shin. I thought it was just getting sore from lifting my toes to avoid rocks. Later I would find the discomfort increase and realized I had shin splints for the first time in my life. Naturally they come from running and being a novice or competitive, and the other main reason, (I wasn’t running so it didn’t apply), was shoes. Shoes lose 30-40% of effective use after 500 miles. So the lesson is it doesn’t matter how much weight I take off, without proper equipment it doesn’t matter. Rusha later picked my shoes up as I was replacing the insoles and folded them in half and said it shouldn’t be that easy. My shoes were useless. I have been so ignorant on all these things so time to educate myself on feet a little more. One thing I know for certain is I’m going to have two more pairs of shoes AT LEAST lined up for the rest of the trip. I had no idea. I can’t be getting any more injuries and they keep stacking the farther I go on this pair. Hopefully the insoles will get me to Duncannon, but most of all I hope these shin splints don’t take forever to heal. Rusha and I watched a movie on how to use kt tape on my situation and I plan on going slow, again. Everything in this world is backwards. Being frugal with shoes has become expensive. I also want to say I got my spirit crushed. I know with the right shoes I could have easily slacked Maryland, and I was looking forward to being caught up with T and Sundown. It was the hardest thing not to push through the ache in order to obtain my goal, and I’m glad I knew better even though it broke my heart to admit defeat.Tomorrow is another day and I hope to make any progress.","Harpers Ferry ATC

We ate breakfast and hit the road. First stop was dropping sundown at the Pennsylvania line. Then we crossed over into Maryland to take me to the trail. Rusha found Astrals on Amazon (I didn’t even think to look there) so I’ll be picking up shoes in smithsburg MD. I’ll figure out what to do with the ones in Duncannon when I get there. I also finally got my mail drop that was missing in Harpers Ferry recovered and sent to Duncannon. I was able to let the Doyle Hotel know that my package was arriving well before me. They said not to worry about it. The theme of the day. Rusha and Denali give good hugs, and she was blowing the horn down the road as she left.
Well, I have to say. I hiked 13 miles on 12$ insoles and did not have any abnormal pain. Pretty impressive. Granted I took it real slow and stretched at Washington monument park and napped at a shelter 5 miles in. On the last stretch I met up with Devin who I talked with some when I was aching slack packing. Tomorrow we go into town together while I wait for package. He’s from Utah and has been to zero states on the Appalachian trail. I find that cool, and I encourage him to do the other half of his flip flop to experience the south because he’s debating not doing it. 
I miss everyone so much, and now I’m pretty sure that’s why I’ve been solo for so long. To avoid making friends. After being injured and experiencing community on the trail I just want it.

From there we went to Smithsburg Market and I got coffee and he got a grape soda. He charged his battery bank and I read off and on. When the time came to hit the PO it was an easy transaction. The hard part was throwing my old shoes away. It would cost 10.50$ to send them home, and they asked me why send them home, do they not fit? I laughed and said they were worn out and they looked at me weird. They were one of many gifts I received before leaving Asheville from my friends Peter and Jessie. The shoes were with me 585 miles of trail. It was just hard. I did have them thrown out because now I have a new pair to wear out and I can fret over whether or not to make these my gardening shoes when I’m done.Back at the market we got lunch. Devin got a sub and I got chicken straight out of the fryer. They actually notified me when they pulled it and it was hot and juicy.After a short stop at dollar general for new Velcro on my shoes for the gaiters, we were walking the road again. It was noon and the air was sticky. A lady saw us walking past her house and gave us a ride to the trail. She had actually lived in Asheville in ‘96 so it was cool to talk about how it’s changed. On trail Devin had some foot pain and slowed down. I told him to take care of himself and about some of my mistakes so he hung back and had a shorter day. Maryland is full of hunters and guns are constantly being fired in the surrounding area. There was a stretch of trail where I could see six white blazes in 100ft. Way over marked. Maybe it’s so you don’t get lost and shot. On the way out of Maryland the rocks grow out of the ground. There’s so many rocks that the trail is blazed by trees but people take many paths. There is no one good route. I’m grateful a million times I did not slack all this.Crossing the tracks into Pennsylvania was pretty special for me. It was a goal that I failed to achieve the fast way, and it had to be earned. I thought about celebrating and going and watching a three hour movie in waynesboro but decided against it due to timing and incoming storms. There was the first roadside trail magic since...... gosh I don’t know. Devils fork? It was a cooler with some candy and cheese, and trash bags to deposit trash. Spring water held the lid down.

I knew it was supposed to rain in the evening so the earlier the better. I laid there for a bit and stretched and finished the last chapter of To Asmara and didn’t know if I was disappointed or not. It was a good story, but the climax happened at the end and the conclusion seemed sloppy and short. It was kind of beautiful though, the main characters wife left him because he loved his position better than his marriage, in fact, he was made aware how inferior he was in the matters of love when his colleague Henry was caught being a spy and leaving transponders on mountain tops for the enemy in the off chance they may release his love from prison. Darcy the main character did however fall in love with a rebel that was unlovable because she was tortured to a point where she was basically incapable of ever being on anybody’s level again. At the very end she jumps into a burning truck to try and save it and so does he, but she is blown out by a bomb and he is never recovered. I guess it was his last attempt to show love that wouldn’t be reciprocated? Like I said I’m ambivalent.Keeping a slow pace I’m enjoying the early morning start. It’s not quite humid yet. I read some of Appalachian Trials and love the idea, but it’s about coping with the mental challenges and one of the coping mechanisms he keeps referring to are drugs and alcohol. Take what I can use and leave the rest.On my way into a picnic area I saw a pipe labeled “drinking water year round”. Normally it’s warning you to boil. I like positive signs. Right before you leave VA for the first time there is a parking lot with a sign “parking ok”. I wonder how different the world would look if signs said what was ok, or what was acceptable, instead of what isn’t. About the same time I started talking to the chief of PA trail maintenance. He told me to expect it being muddy. Later on I would run into him again and he was grateful to know about downed trees and we talked about ramps, because the lookalike Lilly of the valley was ten feet away.I arrived at quarry shelter just before 1400 and met “Innkeeper”, the man Jim that designed and helped build and maintain the shelter. He does so every Friday. It’s beautiful and as we talked a chipmunk ran around along with a cardinal. The place was immaculate with flowers and groomed landscapes. We talked for an hour and half before he made his way home before the storm and for his granddaughters 18th birthday. The only thing about the shelter is the two living quarters are small so I decided to give up my spot. The next 7.5 miles of trail were smooth and easy and I arrived at the next shelter at 1800. I ran into a shelter full of flip floppers which seems to be the norm for awhile. It rained the last thirty minutes of walking and continued through the night.","Deer lick Shelters

Then I did the half gallon challenge and set an intention that it was going to be my last ice cream for awhile. My old buddies are somewhere a day ahead because they did the challenge yesterday. I was blessed to see Bob Peoples from kincora hostel again. He’s now in the AT list of fame.

This morning I said bye and I knew i was going long. Most the group wanted burgers and beer along the trail so still looking for my family. There was a breakfast joint two miles down the trail but I passed it up. As you near boiling springs the trail busts out into expansive farmland which is a great scene. Soybeans just starting to sprout in this field, wheat in that one, and looks like it was corn last year. Some are just dormant with wild onions growing randomly in them. There is mud everywhere. All day. In boiling springs you pass by an ATC headquarters and I used their water to wash my shoes off. They were muddy as soon as I left.Boiling springs is beautiful! You come into the town by an old stone forge and then the trail goes up a creek with fly fishermen at every bank enjoying the sunshine. That water comes out of a pond that has fowl everywhere. Ducks and a huge swan. There were trees of all kinds. Some of the trees leaning over the river and by the pond were massive and old. I got two hot dogs from the gas station and then headed out. I forgot to mention that I passed the original midpoint of the trail on midpoint knob. Once you come down from that the trail flatlines until just before the shelter. I saw a fox today. It was brief. But I found his paw prints and was surprised by the size of them. They were more like cat prints. I also saw a hundred squirrels and a bunny. Did I mention mud? Yeah wet shoes all day. Totally worth it. Pennsylvania is beautiful.","James fry shelter

He’s been traveling solo since Harpers as in not with his brother and he’s had some personal hurdles to climb! He looks great and I gave him a tight hug. B and T! Anyway, we got caught up and I drilled him with questions. How’s life been the last many miles?? We were so involved in conversation we missed our turn and came into a neighborhood with no blazes and ran into two other hikers that explained where we went wrong. T didn’t want to miss that mile of trail so I backtracked with him. I was late to the post office by one minute so they were shut down for the hour from 1100 to 1200. So I went back to get my shoes from the Doyle Hotel. I knew I was getting a room. My feet have been covered in mud for two days and in between my toes they were just starting to itch. Which is damn good considering how long they have been wet. My clothes were getting sturdy from sweat, but ultimately I dreamed of clean socks. There are loner clothes and I was able to wash everything. The showers are piping hot and I took it lukewarm like usual. The beds are surprisingly queen sized and split for two we were charged 18.55$ apiece. That includes a shuttle to the local store. We split laundry costs as well. I played all the songs stuck in my head for the last three days, one for each day and then listened to music while organizing gear. Starting from day before yesterday to today, Sheryl Crow if it makes you happy, Kavinsky nightcall, Israel Nash rain plans. Random I know, trust me... waking up with Sheryl crow when I haven’t heard that song in years is just insane.The trail was rocky and I stubbed my toes a dozen times and I got frustrated. Especially after a particular stretch of three times in a row. I started getting resentful and the solution was to remind myself that the trail is not perfect and I’m not perfect either. After that it was an enjoyable hike. At the store I pulled my usual shenanigans like a pregnant male and bought a ton of meat and and a bag of shredded cabbage and carrot. By meat I mean a whole chicken, lb of smoked bologna, 8 oz of maple ham, and 14 oz smoked sausage.

The post office has a hiker box that the community donates to and its overflowing with protein bars and such. I used flat rate so I sent some north with my shoes. I may hike with a couple from Instagram on Sunday. Then I will be meeting up with the Maddie that I hiked with in the beginning Monday. The only thing is I gotta knock out 100 miles in four days. So far so good, even with a bit of a late start.
Leaving Duncannon I walked for a while through a neighborhood. I’m so surprised there’s not more hostels. Then I crossed a big river (Juniata), followed by an even bigger river (Susquehanna). It’s moments like that when I’m walking across a pretty big bridge looking out at a massive joining of two rivers (much like Harpers Ferry) that I realize I’m not in NC anymore. 
The climb up the ridge was the best in awhile in elevation gain. The terrain was pretty ideal too, a reasonable amount of rocks. That wasn’t so in some areas. The water table is really full and water is proving to be accessible in most stretches. There may be some 10 miles of ridge here and there where it’s not. I hiked with a guy Logan til the first shelter. He had a good pace, but I still thought T would catch up. After he left I ran into Leif and Deb. They were the couple that showed T and me where we had missed the trail coming into town. Other than that it was a long day solo. I actually sent my Astrals to Maddie so I could try out Altras until I met up with her. There seems to be slightly less padding in the heel but they are pretty spectacular. I’ll eval more later on.
Posting up in a small clearing with my hammock. I built a small fire for bugs and then a person came over with a stick offering and joined me for awhile. He talked in a way that I questioned sometimes if he was just thinking out loud because I couldn’t hear sometimes but he kept going with no response from me (eating). Now everyone is in bed and the fire is a bed of coals. When I came back from getting water a deer was walking through and could care less about me. In the trail register people mentioned that a lot. I think I’m too tired for my book but just wanted to say that it’s pretty excellent. I’m glad I pushed through the little bit where he drank too much in Hiawassee. There’s info that is from research, his own experience, and others experiences. Some chapters like Virginia blues are too late to matter, but now I’m reading about the Whites.

It was slightly chilly so I just packed all the way up and got hiking. I find out later that that area is haunted. I was wondering why people mentioned “deer but no ghosts” in the log. Today was a grey day. There were some good views but I didn’t even slow down because there was nothing to see. I’ve been playing leap frog with recon, bob, and squatch. Today was the most technical short stretches of rock so far. Small boulder fields shortly after the abandoned power line. It’s funny because I had just thought how amazing the terrain had been. I hear others were of the same mentality when they hit the rocks as well. I don’t even think we are to the rocks of Pennsylvania yet. The first thing I ever heard about it was from idiot in the smokies. He said the trail crew goes out at night and sharpens the rocks.The shelter was a push, but it’s worth it. Running water, four walls with a door, and a trash can.

I never really listened to that particular song by them often. Regardless I played it while doing yoga outside in the foggy morning because it’s the only way to keep from repeating the fragments I do know over and over during a hike, usually in an attempt to piece it together. I’ve always found this band beautiful in a very unique way. I fought my normal drive to get going right away and ended up striking up more deep conversations with squatch while he got ready. He’s gotten really involved in meditation and is on a different path than he was originally. We continued talking about all things. Death, mindfulness, integration, meditation, soulcraft, and so on. We grabbed lunch at a pond that was beautiful and had a rope swing. I got in. He considered doing the rope swing till he put his feet in then just left it at that. So invigorating. He shared some leftover Stromboli with me, and then I had to get hiking to warm up. About an hour later he decided to stop and meditate and I left him to it. The rain fell in very random spurts along with the sunshine. When the sun hit my back in force I was reminded how powerful it is. Any closer and the earth could just burn up. The trail smoothed out a bit surrounded by mountain laurel and weaved north like a snake. Eagles nest shelter said .3 off trail but they usually aren’t accurate. This one is. Part of the reason I decided to stay. The other part was a friendly group of women had a fire going and had eaten their fill of the assortment of food they hiked in and were attempting to put the weight on me. They succeeded. I had cheese, olives, s’mores, crackers, and other finger foods. The only thing was I had to answer many questions in return. Then I showed squatch the process and knots I use to hang bear bags and learned how to do a clove hitch in the process. I still choose to use an overhand slip for everything though.Some questions are just hard. I don’t know what my favorite part and least favorite part of the trail has been. It’s all very much the same. Sometimes as mentioned in my guest book, my worst days are my best. And vice versa. Today though, was a good day.

Last night it actually rained pretty good and me and all my stuff is perfectly fine. Had there been any wind that may not be so. I slept deep.To assuage the squirrel I made my way out of bed and started packing. Everyone was still asleep and I said a silent goodbye and left. There was only one climb on the way to Port Clinton. I was warned about the descent and when I got to it, I thought “this isn’t so bad”. Shortly after it was STEEP. Basically felt like a controlled slide down. Made my knees ache. Sometimes I miss my poles.Also heard word that I had to check out the barber. So that was the plan. On my way I ran into Beth and asked if she wanted to join. AWOL advertises coffee and cookies but the place offers so much more. After we dropped packs we were told to make ourselves at home. There was a hiker box and many comfortable chairs. I had coffee and cookies and the 71 year old man asked us questions about where we were from etc. He was in great shape and you would never guess he was as old as he was. After awhile we finally said our goodbyes and headed back to the trail. The next 15 miles went by reasonably well because I was distracted from the rocks with conversation. It was also a beautiful day and there were people and dogs everywhere. My two favorite dogs was the one in Port Clinton that stood at his “beware of dog” sign begging to be loved. The other was a golden named duke that dove into a mud pit and swam around for a bit before grabbing up a massive stick and running back to his owners with it. Probably the highlight of the day. Luckily the last four miles or so was basically on the road because 20 miles of rocks feels like 30 miles flat. This shelter is pretty epic with a flushable toilet and solar shower.

It was hard to get up. Getting on trail I got my shoes wet as soon as possible. Just get that part over with. The ice cold water ended up feeling good on my sore feet. There was a steady climb up to the hawk sanctuary trail and I made my first mistake of the trip. I took layers off too soon. After that was flat, rocky, or both and didn’t really move enough to stay warm. Second mistake was thinking I’d be fine till the first shelter if I kept moving, which was true, at a cost. Beth and I leapfrogged each other but basically arrived at the shelter at the same time. I immediately layered up, which was hard because my hands were useless. Then I started core exercises and ate a bar. Then I put my jacket back on and did some more exercises. I like controlled mountain climbers because it gets most muscle groups. Beth committed to staying which was wise of her. The next part of the trail had many perils.For six miles I thought I was rock free. It was just road walking with puddles surrounded by ferns and lily of the valley. Then the trail swings up to bear rocks and knifes edge and I do not trust my shoes (altras) in any way like I trust Astrals on wet rock. They are deadly and useless compared to them. I have to slide down most surfaces and at this point the wind and rain has gently battered me into a state of general numbness where my tendons in my arms feel tight as guitar strings. It is uncomfortable to make any fast movements like bracing for a fall. So despite the cold I slowed down to a safe speed which was like 15 yards a minute. If that. When the path cleared up (normal ankle twisting terrain) I was grateful. And coming into bake knob saw some good flat road again and got my hopes up. Bake knob however is a nasty little rock pile too and I actually fell this time. When I looked at my hand that raked across the rocks I half expected flesh to be missing, but I was fine. When I saw the shelter I was glad to get out of the rain. Arthur was already there and we shared stories of how BRUTAL that section of trail was.I was offered evac for a nero on Monday and so I asked if that was possible today or tomorrow morning. It was possible today. So I said bye to Arthur and pushed the last 2.4 miles to the gap which was oddly easy when dreaming of a warm shower and bed.

That night a section hiker did all the things. He snored, occasionally stopped breathing, talked, and according to T, screamed in his sleep. Now I see why his hiking parter set up a hammock in the rain. Didn’t bother me. I was so exhausted I struggled to do my chores. I was so tired I struggled to sleep. I laid there and meditated. I didn’t hear any screaming so I must have slept hard.This morning I recommitted myself to God’s will and just tried to be present.

Turns out it’s my favorite stretch of Pennsylvania. Some of it was actually climbing up a rock wall and very thrilling. With the sun and wind it was just incredible. Great views of the land and river. Once on the ridge the trail was too good to be true. Nice and flat with a view to the west. After a paved road it all changed. Ankle twisting rocks and rock piles, back with a vengeance. Basically all the way to the shelter.T almost had a trail name for me.

The bakery was a great place for coffee and the breakfast sandwiches were worth the money. T, Mission (nobo), and I got dragged into a game of “jackpot” with kids where one person throws a football into a crowd while yelling what you get when you catch it. The kids would yell things like Bugatti and owning the patriots. But when mission was jackpoter he yelled practical realistic things like 30 pack of toilet paper or 100$ Amazon card. It was fun and funny.Today the sky was blue and I wanted to swim so bad I finally got on trail to leave Pennsylvania. Halfway over the Delaware river there was a small plaque that let us know we had another state to blame for rocks. I wondered if it was deep enough to jump of the bridge and if people did.There was a ton of people out today and as we approached the kittatinny trailhead the person blocking off the street said he was at max occupancy and said since we hiked in, we were welcome to the “Dunnfield Rodeo” where the best people watching was to happen. Not ten feet in the park I got to use my medkit on a little girl that scraped her knee. Little band aid or a big band aid? “Big!” Oh yeah? Because it’s a big booboo? Uh huh!

Then we lazed about in the sun til we were basically dry and took off.We passed one of the seven wonders of NJ, which was sunfish pond. A glacial pond, that was so acidic that only a few hardy species of fish could live in it. Then came the kittatinny ridge and was almost a 360 degree view.

They are like a broken record and it never ends. It got quiet around 0400. When I awoke this morning I had missed sunrise and I did not care I was so tired. It was nice to lay around in the hammock. Even as I was done packing I had left my hammock out to climb back in and rest while happy trees and T did their thing. Today was hot. Just in a situational kind of way. I know it will get much hotter. I almost walked away from going to see Buttermilk Falls, the highest waterfall in NJ. I just couldn’t bring myself to skip it so I stashed my pack and jogged down the two mile trail. It was beautiful, the trail to it and the waterfall itself. It is surprising to find out that people can just drive to the bottom. I thought I was going somewhere exotic. For me, it still was. There was a pool just big enough to sit all the way down in, at the top of the 100 plus footer. After running back up the trail I caught up to T who started later. We hiked and talked and agreed that today is just a hard day. My additional side trek, no real sleep, and the heat made me want to stop at the shelter we took a late lunch at. But it was still early and there was standing water all around this shelter and it was buggy. The next shelter was six miles away so we pushed. New Jersey is just beautiful. We come up to many clearings and the trail is very navigable and smooth mostly. We came to another fire tower and it was nice because the steady breeze up there wicked the sweat and heat off of us. I found Squatch! It’s serendipitous, he skipped a section leaving from Delaware Water Gap to go back and do it with a friend in June. The shelter is full, so I decided to set my hammock up extra strong, securing the stakes with boulders.  Squatch had the storm in real time on his phone and it said potential hail and 60 mph winds. They asked me if I wanted to wait it out in the shelter, I just got in my hammock and said I would ride it out. It was thrilling. I’ve watched storms like these from the safety of a porch bit it’s so intimate being connected. When the trees move I move. The tarp is perfect and even in the bigger gales does not loosen up or touch me from bending in. My bag liner is now on the outside with my bag and everything in it. It’s mostly over now but there for a second lightning was hitting so close it was percussive. There are sirens in the distance and there is a group of seniors on the hill I hope everyone is ok.

That’s hammocking though, it’s an adults way of climbing back in the womb.We meandered around a lot again this morning. It’s really hard to use up enough time to hike 12 miles and not be at the shelter shortly after noon. Someone came south and was just plain abrasive. He told T “you Americans are so novelist(I think that’s the word he used), we can look out at a view and say wow, what a beautiful view. But you guys look out at the view and say, something is missing, and you have to put a flag on it.” Honestly we really never even said anything, he just kinda started talking that way. When we didn’t really reply, he then asked if we were up late last night partying or something. (Me and T are the only sober people that I’ve met besides T’s brother) Then went straight into boasting of being in love with the dawn. He was mental. IF I was to be equally judgmental without any knowledge of that person, my diagnosis would be he is full of himself. Later I got to thinking how he just threw us into his box in his head labeled “American”. I guess that’s just a little taste of what it’s like to be Muslim or something else. Where someone is different so we make these grand judgements based off what we feed our brains with. We got good sun for hiking, this stretch is sketchy for water, and we got a little out of the sky. Just enough to wish I never took the time to put a rain jacket on. There was a garter snake and orange salamanders everywhere. I’ve noticed that Elm and Striped Maple are pretty common in these areas.At the High Point ranger station we were given a free pepsi when signing the logbook. The water out of the fountain was not fit to drink. I hope that’s not what city water in Jersey tastes like, pure sulfur. I poured it out and got some from the creeks by the shelter.

It’s thirty minutes and each section is five minutes. Each stage you wish the person to be well and happy. First myself, then someone I care about, then a neutral person, then someone I’m at odds with, then all of us together, the last five is to pay attention to the body as you let go of all efforts. It was hard, mainly to stay focused. Then squatch said he wished his enemy to have padding under his feet as he hiked, and I just wished him to be well and happy. Apparently you can get creative with compassion and I’m still young at showing it, or imagining it. He assured me that it was ok, and that’s why it’s cultivating compassion and not expressing it.I hit the trail and had all my layers on but my puffy and it was perfect for awhile. The terrain was easy except the muddy sections which proved to be impossible to navigate and keep clean. Finally the road with the “secret cabin” appeared and I went to investigate. It is a cabin with a chessboard floor of large black and white squares of tile. Other than that a small table with the logbook. I put my GoPro on the charger and started sunbathing. It’s the good kind of day for that because the wind is cold and the sun hot. Everyone else (T and Squatch the Weather Man) showed up and did their own things. I hung out from 1000 to 1300. In the meantime Jake the miniature donkey showed up and loved attention. He also spent a long time rubbing the goo away from his eyeball on the crook of my arm. Soon after the cabin owner Jim Murray came and said hi. Cool to put a face to the place.We all left for unionville together, and first stop was the post office for Scrubs’ family package. I knew it was going to be a surprise but it was epic. Tons of cured deli meats and trail mix. Power bars, and meal bars that are 1200+ calories per package, dried fruit, slim Jim’s, can oysters (one of her dads contributions), even baggies for dividing stuff up in new packaging. Many things I’m forgetting like peanut butter filled pretzels but the timing was perfect. There is a full resupply general store but it can be expensive to stock up that way. Squatch took off to the next shelter and t and I hung around a bit longer to get a little more charge on our bricks. I went in and got a bag of sauerkraut and when I came out a local pastor was inviting us into his home. We accepted and got showers and did laundry, afterwards we were treated to a meal of big juicy burgers and hand cut sweet potato fries, followed by gingerbread cookies. In return we helped carry a hutch to the garage and took a razor blade to the stairs and windows to clean up paint and where carpets were recently removed. Bonzai and Priscilla are our hosts and Maple is the seven month old rolling around smiling at everyone.After much community and conversation we are all in our parts of the house. Luckily hikers bedtime is the same as babies and I’m sure waking up will be the same. T was concerned with dropping a few items to lighten his pack and was having a hard time accepting the instant realization of what certain things provide. He is in better moods now and I totally understand his struggle and we talked and laughed about how nothing really matters.","High Point shelter

I had a double sausage double egg cheese bagel this morning that was out of this world. Then I left unionville and went to the first view and was able to see high point tower way off in the distance. Then I crossed a creek and stopped and submerged myself for a long time, from WOWs post it was JMT style, clothes and all. Beautiful boardwalk, easy hiking except stairway to heaven which was still easy. My pack is heavy with my mail drop but I got used to it quickly. After that I hiked to the shelter and somehow beat squatch so I set up camp and hung out with Blackbeard, Brick, Apple, Welcome, and Committee. When squatch showed up he wanted to check out the drive in theater so I packed up camp and we hiked to the road. We hitched a ride in less than ten minutes by two different people. Ours was a Jersey teacher. She said she trusted us, if she can handle Jersey school kids she can handle hikers. Upon arrival we had no idea if they provide camping but it was free along with free admission with radios! Great day!!","Unionville

We decided to do a short day today to do a twenty miler to the shelter that you can apparently see the New York skyline. Since we had time we went to shop rite and ate and resupplied anything anybody was lacking. Then I went to the post office and mailed my xlite home and my Patagonia torrentshell back to the outfitter I bought it from. I am not impressed with it. It wet through in the tiny drizzle we had yesterday and the zippers get stuck all the time. The trail is wonderful. I ran into legs who I hadn’t seen since day one and talked a long time with him and oats, a girl also from Asheville. Other than that the trail kept busting out of the trees onto boulders overlooking the landscape. Someone had tied an American flag to a dead tree and lifted it up like a flagpole at mt prospect. Maybe that’s what the Judge Mental Foreigner was babbling on about.Me and T talked a lot about the movies and other things as we hiked. Shortly after prospect a thirty minute lightning storm flashed its way by us. Many places we were exposed on the ridges but just pushed through. A terrified infant deer was bleating and trying to find mom. As we walked by the little guy took off pretty well considering how awkward it still walked. Should be ok. Mom is usually always nearby.Here at wildcat it’s getting pretty crowded. The shelter is hosting the tramily of nightro, cheerleader, fireball, turkish, and sleeves. It’s me and T and Squatch. Sometimes I desire to push ahead and get out of the bubble. Fresh ground is not far behind with a big bubble. I’ll at least try and wait for squatch to get off trail.

I’m falling back in love with the trail. Ah, love. Somebody desecrated the trail for “love” today. Someone spray painted the first peak of the morning in big letters PROM? Then painted hearts all around it and all over the rocks going down the other side. Even had fake rose petals thrown about the trail leading up to the rock. I also picked up the wrapping of a champagne bottle. I just fantasized that she was a hiking fanatic and when she saw how he trashed the trail, she said no and he drank the bottle of champagne alone. Other than that the hike was flawless. Nature in its finest. A lot of up and downs with the good kind of rocks. A lot of climbing them. Lunch was taken at a beautiful lake but the weather wasn’t fit to get in. Too windy and overcast. A few hours later squatch and I did sit in a creek for awhile. I know that if the weather was different I may have a whole other take on this section of the trail, but it really is fantastic. There was a part called the lemon squeezer and it was a slot in between two rocks that I had to hold my pack next to me and shimmy through.My buddy sundown hit me up and said he’s getting off trail which means he got accepted to the school he wanted. I’m happy for him. I’m gonna wait around tomorrow to give him a chance to catch up so I can say bye. Other than that it is memorial weekend and there are people everywhere.

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614532,"There’s no shelter log at Brian’s Shelter. There is however copious amounts of trash left behind by Frozen’s followers. At least this time it said “for frozen and other hikers”, some say “for frozen only”. I didn’t know bears could read. Hmm... Anyway this is my LNT rant for the week. If you go into the woods for any reason, even just for the practice of supporting a hiker, FOLLOW LEAVE NO TRACE PRINCIPLES. Use a bear box, or support your hiker in a more direct manner, aka the Post Office. But most of all, communication with the hiker to make sure he wants to carry out the trash left over from your gift. It’s a real problem! Trash is rendering shelters inhabitable because bears come back for more and get less and less scared till they have to be put down. Fingerboard Shelter is currently having this problem. Someone’s tent was slashed and their food stolen the day before. In the shelter log there were many accounts of the bear pulling on the hang and nothing could scare it away. Well now to put my entry in because I want to remember this day and obviously I’m not looking to get famous or make friends, unless you also hate to see trash everywhere.The hikes today were beautiful, there were two smaller mountains before bear mountain that had nearly nobody on them. Once I got to bear mountain it was obvious it was a tourist area. The steps in the beginning were very well done and created a neat durable path to the summit. At one overlook there was a bench dedicated to a ranger and I sat there for awhile taking everything in. A 2018 thru hiker gave me some fruit and showed me his completion certificate. He was super passionate about it with his choppy English. His name was little house on paper but he kept saying little horse. So I just said little horse from then on and he never corrected me. One of the coolest things was seeing the New York City Skyline on the horizon. The towers were pretty visible and they were about fifty miles in the distance. Coming down from bear mountain was a process, there were people and dogs everywhere. The ranger said it was 1800 steps, a bit of an exaggeration but it was a lot. At the bottom was the biggest picnic party I have ever seen. It was definitely the melting pot of America. There was every kind of human imaginable.This is where T and B wait for sundown. He basically hiked in two days what we did in a week. He’s a monster. Before we say goodbye we went through the animal zoo and across Bear bridge. In the zoo we saw two foxes, a bobcat, many snakes fish and frogs. The bears and coyotes were put up but saw the turkey vultures, hawks, and a huge bald eagle. At the end I saw my first ever beaver up close. The eagle was my first too. Bear bridge was the biggest bridge I ever walked across and Hudson also the biggest river I walked across I think. So goodbye sundown and Godspeed. The rest of the hike was good with me and T taking a decent pace. We stopped at the Appalachian market and got a meal apiece and some sweets. Now we are at the spiritual center and I’m about to read and go to bed but some of the people that are residing at the center are bringing wood and about to have a fire. Could be as many as forty people the guard said. I’m glad my hammock is pretty far away. Tomorrow I’m going to fahrenstock beach and it’s supposed to be HOT. Can’t wait.","Brian Shelter

I did wake up to the pouring rain which was good because my gear was not situated very well for it. When I awoke again I heard Fresh Grounds voice. Had not seen him since hot springs and he was cooking up banana pancakes for everyone. Today I may have said goodbye to squatch for the rest of his trip. Maybe not, we’ll see. His feet had a rough day yesterday and he decided to zero out in the ball field. My hike was powerful. I was thinking of the many small resentments I have been holding lately. Towards prom dude, judgmental foreigner, people leaving trash on the trail, myself etc. What’s really going on is I’m hurting and I’m looking for something to focus on. None of these things actually impact me. But I let them, because then I can justify being angry. So I dig deep today. In my dreams I have rode the astral projections into myself and came upon the vaults that I have locked things in. Things I don’t even remember but I don’t want to face. Today I opened the vault of the room that contains love, and I realized it’s still trashed to this day. There is blood and tears everywhere and nothing is of value anymore with the charred bits of interior that used to represent something. I reflected on what that room looked like in the past before I absolutely dismantled it. I don’t even know anymore. I gave my all to a girl long ago, and have never been able to bring myself to do it again for anyone really.I still cried and allowed the bitterness and hatred to surface so that I could let it go. I imagined cleaning that room while acknowledging the things I remember doing to sabotage it. Then I imagined how god would decorate that room and let him, and instantly thought of the tears he kept in vials and the painting of me finding him three and a half years ago in a lightning storm with my fists clenched and spirit broken. The fresh painting right  from his workshop of me today on my hands and knees, giving up all the spiritual baggage from that room. Then I walked. I was light. I got under a waterfall and let the water wash away what was left, and let the joy fill the space that was left. Nothing else matters. But it all does. Life is beautiful and I’m way too hard on myself. I’m not perfect. Amen","Greymoor ball field

It’s great to go against my nature and watch people motivated and goal oriented shuffling past, while my needs are being met with doing less. The mileage has become like money in the bank account, slowly dwindling. Pushing only makes it slip by faster. When I summit I don’t want any regrets, and lately listening to the flow of the world has really paid off. Today we head to a land of no destination once again, both of us are becoming more struck with freedom of spirit than feelings of accomplishment.

Once we were on trail a helicopter flew overhead and for some reason Space Oddity popped into my head. I really hope I can attend some classes at Mountain Scout Survival School. It’s only called survival to help people find it on the web. It’s really a life skills school. Edible and medicinal plants, permaculture, tracking, fire building, soulcraft, etc.Once again T and I called a short day, mainly because we stopped and allowed ourselves to get cold.

I only have about three quarters of a ridge rest for a mat now so I’m not used to it and woke up a bunch to switch hips. One good thing about waking up a bunch is I dream harder. Before bed I had a solo meditation when the storm came through. It was loud and the ground rumbled with the thunder, and was encased in a river of water. As it finally ebbed I laid down.Upon awakening I got my stuff together and did my morning reading. Putting on the wet shirt was not as bad as it seemed. I had fun hiking and was thinking about Shane and his teaching of being aware. I heard all the animal sounds and was more present than usual. I ran into a group of kids led by a wilderness group. There was a line of snot on the ground and apparently to a kid that is “unicorn blood”. Definitely a Harry Potter fan.The train crossing is the most dangerous part of the AT. Shortly after walking across, it felt like I heard the horn and then it was whizzing past. Crazy fast. I saw a sign that it went to New York and T and I had been talking about going. I was looking at schedules when I saw a cardboard sign that said free stay in New York. I called them and they said they were available whenever so I talked it over with T and we got a taxi to Pawling to get on the train to grand central. Then we took a purple 7 and a green G bus and arrived near the house.Hosted by 2018 thru hikers Rumi and Steady we get a shower and they bought pizza for dinner. We are the first people that called since they put the sign up three days ago. There is a lot of catching up on favorite hostels, and if certain things are the same and favorite stretches, the usual hiker talk. There is an upper story here that has a beautiful view of the city. Weather depending we will try to see some cool stuff but even if it rains there’s art and museums. The train and subway was a sad experience because everyone is so focused. Nobody talked and were glued to their devices or running along. It was very hectic using the subway so many things going on. We got out of the subway and it was a hiker heaven.

I cooked eggs with crab meat and jalapeños, and had French pressed coffee. Looking up meetings in Brooklyn I was pleased to find there was even more than Asheville. So I just picked a 0900 meeting that was a mile away and walked to it. It was outstanding! There were a lot of us packed in that tiny room! The meeting structure was streamlined with opportunities for service and fellowship after. People were very solution oriented and supportive of each other. We talked about the use of therapy (still haven’t myself) and the other part was about rationalizing and coming up with excuses, in general.Afterward everyone who wanted to, walked to Trix, a cafe a few blocks away to get coffee or whatever and talk some more. Through the process a guy asked me if I wanted to go to the gym, so I did. I did some exercises that didn’t involve legs and sat in the sauna for thirty minutes. By that time T had come out and walked to meet me and we explored New York. Mostly Manhattan and Chinatown. When we returned to home base we cooked and ate dinner with our hosts and talked for hours about so many things.

Small world! Got a taxi back to the trail and I hiked pretty straight through to the campsite. Along the way I met the chief of the Schaghticoke named Hawk. When I got to camp I realized that I had lost my sunglasses but knew they were by the cat hole I dug three miles back. I tried to call T but he had already gone past it and was mostly right behind me. Instead, I employed the help of a local. He said he goes by E so he’s cool. We had to hike to his truck but he showed me a place to cliff jump tomorrow and Bull bridge. He also dealt with my struggles of finding the spot where I lost my glasses. By the time we finally got back to the trailhead I had probably ran an additional three miles. I said goodbye and started to hike back in.The thought crossed my mind to swim, or get in the water at least. It’s 2200 at this point and dark, and the idea seemed outrageous. All alone in the middle of the woods, miles from home, climbing in the black waters of the Housatonic? YOLO. When I climbed in, I turned off my headlamp and looked around. The moon wasn’t quite up ye but some stars were out. The female fireflies were all over as blue little glow lights here and there.

Instead I decided to tackle the ridge before it got too hot. Hiking today was solo much like the old days. I need time to recharge every now and then. T will be getting off trail to spend time with his sister and picking up a package. Today I mostly thought about the future. I’ve been looking into free state tuition at Warren Wilson. They have many degrees in things I would like to pursue, like outdoor leadership. I don’t like the idea of being tied down for four years, but it would be awesome to be educated on paper. Opportunities would open up as well. Plus the more things I accomplish in sobriety with the help of God only builds God up.Sobriety has been challenging and I keep thinking how grateful I am for Brooklyn meetings. It reminds me I’m not alone when everyone on the trail is smoking weed or drinking beer. Weed also has been trying to present itself as appealing, mainly because alcohol can’t, and addiction finds the weak spots. The meeting reminded me that anything I crave is just because there is a part of myself that I do not want to sit with. Weed is just another escape. I just thought I’d mention these things because I haven’t really talked about it lately. As far as the trail it’s beautiful. Connecticut has some well maintained trails. They also provide bear boxes, (they say do not leave trail magic in them), wells for water, nice privies. Even the separate campsites have these things. Connecticut is basically Virginia’s roller coaster but I’d say it’s better. The bugs are coming out in force, but I guess that’s the compromise of swimming. I passed Kent, a popular town, to swim in Macedonia Brook and lay out on the bridge. Down south everything was a stream.

I got the cheeseburger omelette and it was fantastic. We hung around a few hours and then decided to hit the next shelter 3.3 away and .5 off trail. When we got to the blue blaze we hiked in a bit and the trail dropped off the side of the mountain and we were hit with a swarm of skeeters. So we bailed on that idea and decided to push for this shelter. Right outside Salisbury it got dark on us an there came a cold rain. We climbed the mountain and it let up right before the summit so we had a great view at lions head. The best view of CT, hands down. Then we went into the darkness of the trees again for the last stretch to shelter. We were hoping it wouldn’t be full, and it was actually empty besides a porcupine, the first I’ve ever seen.

He layered up and went pee and fell back asleep faster than me. Peeing is an easy way to warm up in the cold, it’s just hard to get out of the bag sometimes. The body consumes energy to keep pee at a sterile temperature. So when when it’s gone it can use that energy on keeping a person warm. Ticks have gained a new level of respect from me.

A hummingbird came in to investigate the shelter poking his face in a colorful American flag hanging on the wall looking for sugar.We remembered our goal today and begrudgingly got going. We went over bear mountain, the highest one in CT. After that we dipped into sages ravine. It was still early and chilly so we skipped the swimming holes but there were waterfalls everywhere! After that welcome to Massachusetts, get ready for climbs! It is becoming physically challenging again! At the top of race mountain there was .6 miles of cliff walking with great views and big ravens. Then Everett mountain was a half mile climb up a rock face and the descent of every one of these mountains were just as difficult. I was very concerned about our deadline to make dinner by five. Almost to the bottom of the mountain we ran into Moosetracks and Lucky, 2017 hikers giving out the magic. They had fruit, instant coffee, soda, water, cookies, candy, and all the fixings for a club sandwich. They were so generous and said they were grateful for us. It really brightened up a hard stretch of trail. The time we spent with them killed the possibility of catching the 1630 bus so we stuck our thumbs out. It worked out even better because we got a ride from Suzie and she showed us the layout of town and still got us to the community center just in time for dinner. Since we pushed hard today we saved our sauna and pool experience for tomorrow morning.

The thought of a sauna got me going though! It was the nice kind, set at a dangerous temperature with a bucket of water and ladle to splash water on the rocks. I couldn’t handle more than twenty to thirty minutes of it. After alternating between that and the pool I was sponged of my energy. Then I laid down in the field and caught some rays till the clouds rolled in and messed it all up. Good thing though because I wouldn’t have left. Today we pulled the first five miles of in a very unmotivated pace. Somehow at the shelter we convinced ourselves to do another five. Oh yeah, it’s because we want to get to upper goose pond cabin and doing five more today brings tomorrow down to about 16 miles. We must be between two bubbles because we have had good luck with shelter space. We also were blessed with a free ride back to trail because we were the first to call from the center for a ride. There is a bird feeding her babies in the loft of the shelter.

Totally fine, because morning is basically the only time to hike in cool weather anymore.The trail was erratic today with some admirable ascents and descents. Otherwise it was a smooth trail rolling it’s way through the sometimes thick underbrush. Not too long ago the woods were dead and grey. Really awesome to watch the foliage spring to life. There were some sections through the marsh with a very skeptic boardwalk that shook or sagged as I went across it. Otherwise the only challenge was getting through before mosquitos took samples of my life source.I was a little sad that the sun wasn’t shining bright and hot when I arrived at the cabin but the water was refreshing nonetheless.

He hadn’t drank any water really or eaten anything, and he was running a temp of 101! His pulse was bounding and respiratory rate high. This apparently had started Monday and he was “on the mends”, so we got emergency contact info and convinced him to drink more water, which he said made him feel better. I didn’t get a second set of vitals because he’s actually a doctor and was really just being nice letting me ask him a billion questions.

One is definitely in the dogwood family because it’s got bracts with flowers in the center and looks identical. I also talked to Bump, Ollie, and Pipas for a bit. We said bye because they were getting a ride to Bumps car since he’s local and doing a resupply and slacking up to Greylock.

I didn’t need anything because my mom hooked me up with four pounds of protein bars. Give or take. I’m set for awhile.
After all that I got dropped off at Tom’s. I’m the only hiker here so we sat on the porch and talked till dark and he let me hang my hammock up on the porch. He made me a killer small mocha ice cream with whipped cream and a strawberry and chocolate drizzle. In the morning he’s hosting a picnic for the local teachers and like 70 kids by eleven so I’ll be long gone, but not before coffee and pastries.
He described the trail ahead and I can’t wait. Greylock is the beginning of beautiful scenery and also trail towns and resupply points get farther apart and everything becomes more wild. I am so stoked! Oh yeah. Two really tiny cubs were running up a tree on the way into town. Didn’t see momma anywhere.","Upper Goose Pond Cabin

Eventually happy trees rolled in and joined the breakfast. We talked for awhile and I charged the other electronics. Soon the house would be swarmed with teachers and kids so we left and walked into town. After a very tiny resupply we hit the trail. At first it was mainly road walking as we left dalton. Then it was easyish hiking mostly because happy trees, Kansas and I make a good group. In Cheshire Kansas picked a package up at the post office and we hung out in the shade of a church for a bit before climbing Greylock. The quick stop at dollar general was nice and I got some gum, mostly to help with biting my lip. I refuse to give up coffee but struggle with anxiety, mostly lately.I’m excited to summit Greylock tomorrow. Logistically the trail gets harder from here on out. However it also gets more rugged and beautiful as well.","Toms place, Dalton

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615957,"Very deep sleep. Too deep! I was all over the place until I became lucid, and then I was hit with a heavy load of sleep paralysis. I was in my hammock as a golden monster of a bear started down from the ridge to me. Looking back I wish I faced the fear, instead I was terrified of my helplessness in the face of what I saw as impending doom. I finally was able to speak, to force a scream out, but it wasn’t until after a bit of hysterics that I woke up enough to worry I had woke everyone with my screaming. That’s when I realized I had woke up in a different dream in my hammock. There was no bear but I was still mostly heavy and the threat of falling back into stage three was looming. I focused on waking up completely and finally groggily woke completely up, and struggled not to fall back into stage two. I sat there and ran a few tests that I was indeed awake, and I became very aware of how clear a night it was. The wind was wishing and the moon is but a sliver and isn’t even out. I wished I wasn’t under the trees and could see more. Finally I felt the heavy feeling pass and thought it safe to attempt sleep again. In the past when I faced the fear the dream would open up and I would break through and fly or create. I’ve been scared of something lately and the trail is bringing it to surface.The hike was excellent the weather pristine. We (Happy Trees, CC Jones((Kansas)), and me), summited Mt. Greylock, the highest peak in MA. At the top was a tower, much like a lighthouse that you could climb. Then it was a gradual descent down to the valley where we slack packed for half a mile, and then got a ride to Chinese. The half mile was to be able to claim we hiked the whole trail even though it was a neighborhood. After all you can eat somehow the other two still wanted to hit up the grocery store way in the other direction and we got a ride from a local for that as well. The last part of MA was unreal with a beautiful stretch of river. I went in the river and it was ice cold like snow melt off. After we crossed the VT border it was a lot of mud and creek bed walking. Also it’s the beginning of the Long Trail. Arriving at camp there was a very non LNT bonfire blazing and it was crowded but everyone was mature and quiet.

The trail is the most overgrown I have seen it yet. Intermittently we would pop out in great marshes turned pond by crafty beavers with beautiful dams.There was a lot of water and we stopped for lunch by a stream and took hippie baths or just got in. There was a lot of climbing and descent which is becoming the new norm. The shelters are crowded in general now I assume, but next week should be nice with the rain.

They are always present now, but when they start coming in small armies they are trying to get a last stretch of feeding in.The terrain is much like the smokies, but at much lower elevation. The shelter has a bear box and I think they do on out. There was a tower on the mountain before Stratton and it went up above the trees. The first 360 degree views in awhile and one could see Greylock to the south and Stratton to the north. Been hiking primarily with Kansas (now CC Jones, I like Casey Jones) because happy trees got itchy feet and took off. It’s really hard not to give into that urge but CC wanted to do 2 17 mile days and I like that. Perfect happy medium.Saw a beaver house in a pond today, it was huge. Still hoping to see a beaver in the nature.Was going to add something about trash and people leaving some in the tower and bear boxes, but I’m getting burned out beating a dead horse. So hard to not get resentful at people too lazy and self centered to carry out trash. I’ll be their caretaker until hopefully life wakes them up and they learn to take care of themselves.Got to the shelter just before the storm hit and I love being cozy in the hammock when the first drops fall. Boy did it rain, all night. A really great feature about my tarp is I staked it out but found out it was too loose later. However, I can adjust the strings closest to the tarp while staying under it. Great find! I’m loving 1984 better than the first time because I didn’t really retain information back when I read it the first time.

I even waited on him for an hour before walking over to check where he had tented to find him gone.With waiting so long before getting started I was hoping Stratton mountain tower would be clear. It wasn’t, but when the trail did clear it was spectacular, except for all the mud. Since getting in Vermont the Long Trail should be the long creek bed or mud pit. And guess who loves mud and sun? Mosquitoes. Some sections are brutal. The most beautiful view today was prospect rock (yet another prospect something) and it’s great to see huge mountains instead of a long ridge.

I never know where he is apparently. While we wait on the others I talk with Scott and drink coke and eat cinnamon twists. Then we all load up (me, CC, and Jetpack) and ride into town. Stopped first at a diner so we wouldn’t resupply hungry. I got a really messy double hamburger and sweet potato fries. Scott is getting into hiking and is asking for our gear preferences and trying to prepare himself for a thru by section in the future. Later we hit the store and outfitter, and we get introduced to the hostel owner.Then CC and I go to bill Wilson’s gravesite followed by the roadhouse where he was born. We were outside taking pictures when a volunteer with 29 years offered to give us a tour even though it was closed for the day. The place feeds people on recovery retreats and hosts meetings nowadays. It was a real treat to stand where it all began.The hostel is organized and there was town clothes to wash all my clothes for the first time in forever. Mostly my socks.

The kitchen was stocked with breakfast items and coffee and everybody cooked a little.   One person scrambled eggs, another made pancakes, and I mixed up milk and cereal. Hitting the trail it was a climb to the top of a ski slope, and just as we made the summit wind and rain stormed through. Naturally we jumped in the warming hut and took a little siesta, reading books and napping til it died down a bit. Once we left we had used up a good chunk of the day and did not hike much further before settling at the first shelter. Had I known we were going to be charged five dollars to stay there I would have definitely went the 4.5 to the next shelter but the caretaker didn’t show up til dusk.

I was in my hammock listening real hard to get more evidence to justify shining a light. I heard it again and so I looked but nothing was there. The noise was real though and it was getting closer. It sounded like it was only twenty feet away and I started to worry, but then movement finally caught my attention. This.... thing, was creeping down the tree like a spider down a web. It finally came completely into view. A porcupine. A big one. After the descent he just kind of ambled on in the other direction.
I’ve been waking up around 0220 every morning without fail. I think that’s when the woods tend to fall completely silent and it shifts over to the night crew. The quiet is what wakes me up.

The mosquitoes were relentless this morning so I had an early start. I considered doing a ton of miles as always but when I got to the suspension bridge over a clear creek and tons of big white rocks and sunshine, all ambition left me. I was already eight miles into my day and I hung out there from ten to two. I would soak or swim in the rapids and alternate reading and laying in the sun. I finished 1984, and it was definitely much more enjoyable than last time. 

At some point we were notified that there was magic at the road and we got subway and soda. It was the guys’ first set up and it was much needed.
Climbing out on full stomachs was not fun but we made the journey. There was a side vista about three miles from the shelter where I was reunited with billy goat from the old days.

Getting ready under a tarp with a hammock is nice because the hammock acts as a seat and there’s tons of headroom. I do wish sometimes I had the walls for the skeeters though.From the start it was an ascent up killington mountain, and I did not go see the peak, too grey and wet. Another time. The rain acts as an air conditioner and the effort seemed diminutive. I saw many signs of moose scat, and still no moose. I never in my whole life thought a moose could be aggressive. I thought they were docile.Coming out onto Route four we made a small trek up the road to an inn that was a free zone for the bus. On the bus I touched base with my mom, and never once thought about Father’s Day till I was in the grocery store and it came over the intercom. I had some awesome times with god on the trail asking for blessings on the water I drink and praying that the waters bless everyone else. So yeah, happy Father’s Day God!One of my biggest battles in sobriety was getting over the idea that my earthly father had anything to do with me, how I was to perceive myself, what I’m capable of etc. When I let go of my desire to add up, or be loved by him, I was free to be my own person. Before then I never completed one single thing in my life. High school gave me a diploma because that was to make sure I’d leave and never come back. Now, with the love of myself,(not the self centered alcoholic love), but healthy unconditional love that is granted to me by grace and mercy that I only obtained from a relationship with God, I have completed things in my life. I’ve made transitions, I’ve overcome obstacles, learned things that I’m passionate about and pursue them. I embrace the suck, and revel in the successes.Oh and yes, I’m a very, very flawed individual. I’m judgemental, resentful, stingy, self centered, yada yada. What’s different about me now is I accept those as learned behavior, and I slowly prune my soul of these things with failure as the teacher, when I’m not too hard on myself (I never learn that way), and slowly my reactive self is becoming a better person.  Or so I hope, I never know where I am at. Every new tier I reach just becomes the new norm so I always feel the same, but other people have given great feedback. Constructive, good and bad.I saw Rocket Man tonight and I must say I got the chills and even emotional at parts. Very well done. It starts with Elton John walking into a meeting in his stage suit. I had no idea he was in recovery as of today with 28 years, and his life was just incredible. The part that touched me the most is he is terrified of the boy version of himself waiting for a hug from dad, and at the end he basically works his ninth step and the last person to pop up is the boy... “where’s my hug?”The older Elton John gets up and gives his younger self the hug he always wanted. From himself! So powerful! That was a turning point for me. There’s even a point when his best friend is like “when did you give up? How do you expect to be loved by anyone if you can’t love yourself?”Also, I was very timid about staying at the yellow deli hostel because I’ve heard all kinds of reviews. From it’s a cult to a backpack got stolen, and the other end, that everyone is nice and a must stop. My personal take is, we were warmly accepted, these people run on principle of love, and I’m grateful for everything they do. It’s very clean and organized, the shower is great and there is coffee and linens and laundry.I realize this is not my normal entry. Sorry for not being very thorough the last while. 1. I’ve actually been hiking with people, building fantastic relationships and I forget to set aside time for phone stuff. 2. I can cover everything but my hands in the woods and the no see ums tear me up when I’m on the phone. 3. Writers block, the trail is glorious and beautiful, it’s muddy, it’s fun, it sucks, it’s life.

I was told I could help the baker in the morning. I got up at 0515 and went downstairs. There was a worker standing outside and he led me in. Yellow Deli is open 24 hours from Sunday night to Saturday morning or something like that. I began talking to David (pronounced Dah-veed) about the 12 tribes a little more in depth.First thing, one gives up everything to join. Everything. House, car, money, land, everything. I asked him what he does when he wanted to watch a movie money wise and he replied that they didn’t really watch movies. Apparently they spend all their time trying to grow closer to people rather than being separated by the many things that separate people today. Then Emmet finally showed up and instead of baking I helped make hiker breakfast. I helped him and his two sons and they called him Abba or father. They were brilliant and he trusted them with adult tasks and in return they were very adult like. They waited their turn to speak and asked well thought out questions, and listened raptly. One of them was scrambling the eggs and the youngest was washing dishes. I’d say their ages were 5 and 6. Then it was my role to serve the hikers, which gave me great pleasure. But at a certain point emmet told me to eat myself and at one point one of the sons said “here B!” while bringing me a pancake.I got in contact with Morning Glory Farm, which is the farm I will be working at right after I summit. They are going to let me come there on my way up as well, to shower, laundry and meal, but most importantly meet everybody and see the farm! I’m doing the farm afterwords for two reasons. One, as a step down process in re establish myself into non-trail life. Two, because I hope to have a homestead of my own one day.The trail passed right by thundering falls, Vermont’s highest waterfall. It wasn’t so impressive in height as width. Shortly after a short walk down a boardwalk I came to the toughest hill  I’ve done, possibly all trip. It was only 1000 ft but it was steep and continuous. Much like Jacobs ladder leaving stecoah gap.The shelters once again are awkward in placement and it was a 10 or 22 mile day so we hunkered down at the first one.Some things I forgot to mention. There are leeches in the ponds up here! I thought that was like an African thing. CC said “look there’s a leech” and seeing a salamander I laughed at him. Then I saw the unmistakable wiggling of a swimming leech. The other thing, in Vermont there is no sales tax on food. Prepared food and restaurant food and alcohol is steep @9&10% but just packaged food is not. Awesome for a hiker.","Yellow deli hostel, Rutland

Elevation wise it’s usually spiking up and down. Same as my heart. It feels really good to get a good heartbeat going, with the endorphins and such going, sweat trickling. Sometimes I wish I had a heavier pack. Mine is designed for distance but I have been intentionally staying with CC because we get along very well. He’s a probation officer and it’s funny how the trail strips people of titles. He sure as heck doesn’t make me think he’s a probation officer out here. So doing short days with a light pack has not been challenging but going against my drive has been rewarding. Well, yesterday if we had pushed to the lookout it would have been better because it’s an enclosed cabin with a view. But today we came to Dan’s barn, and I weed whacked a lot of the area and CC moved big dirty boulders into a tractor bucket, then we both got together and moved a pile of firewood from one place to another. With about three hours of continuous labor under our belt we finally called it a day. I jumped in the creek to wash the grass off. Dan was very grateful for our help, said it was “prayers answered”. He let us pick out two large pizzas and ordered them and gave us the keys to his big diesel truck and we cruised into Woodstock to pick the pizzas up and grab stuff to make breakfast with the crisp 100$ bill he gave us. He really needs help getting the place in order so me and CC are going to zero out tomorrow and help him work on the farm. Then we have the option of slack packing 14 miles to another WFS or all the way to Hanover, where people will host us for free. At this moment we are considering both. I feel like once I hit the whites, these opportunities will not be as obtainable. I’ve also done the math. I could finish as late as early August and still do all the things I have available after. So just enjoy the ride! Apparently the next place has a host that likes to take hikers to a forty foot bridge to jump off. Weather permitting, but I hope I get to regardless. CC is camping by the stream and I’m in the barn that is definitely leaning hard. It’s strangely cozy though and free of mosquito.

The terrain was like the Virginia roller coaster wishes it could be. Tons of steep hills with very little switch backs. The best part is, when we hit the white river, there is a forty foot bridge that you can jump into the clear teal blue water from. The bridge has two white markers that if you jump between them it is safe. I dislike going off something without another dummy to go first. So I was the dummy. Me and CC filmed each other jumping.

I stopped at the post office because I had shoes from my buddy josh that went to Astrals and got me a great deal on my next pair of shoes, and food from Marian, a person I have come to know through emails and support on here. First the shoes, I got the same shoes to finish the hike as the ones I started with.

I’m not sure if it went down that way but I love them!The food. I can’t say how many times I walk by snack pack pudding and think how that sounds good but never buy it. Same with twizzlers.

Should get me to the whites. Maybe even through them if I play it right.The trail (it’s road walking from Elm St., Norwich, to downtown Hanover) was, well... road walking. Plenty of magic from mailboxes with caramel and tootsie pop to coolers with fruit and chocolate. I’m a little self conscious when hiking in my frog togg rain poncho without a backpack rummaging through coolers. I feel like I’m a scavenger and not a hiker. I keep expecting someone to come out and be like “shoo!, this is for hikers you crazy smelly bum!” (Just thoughts, none of this is actually realistic. Most people who put out magic do so on the principle that if you need it take it) Mainly just speculation on how I feel that I’m perceived.If I was self conscious then, imagine walking around Dartmouth Campus. I can’t even imagine being of the demographic of someone to attend a college of the Ivy League. I hung out at Dirt Cowboy Cafe till CC showed up and then we roamed around waiting on the host to get back to us. While we were waiting CC got mistaken for destitute and someone gave him twenty bucks. I told him that was the sign that it’s time for a haircut. Either that or we fly a sign and try to make some money.He got a haircut. As I waited I heard back from our host and then there was a bolt of lightning and loud clap, followed by a severe dumping of water. Just in running twenty paces to get in the car we were soaked! Then rob took us to the co-op and we got beef and broccoli. I got kombucha.

The exposure is like roan highlands times ten. It was actually pretty chilly. 
What I did not expect is that it only gets better. As I descended the other side I was walking down a waterfall almost the entire time. It was 3000 feet of continuous cascades. Out of this world. 
Crossing kinsman notch and heading up the other side, the last few days took their toll. I began to be very tired. The terrain is getting the hardest I’ve seen it yet with rock scrambling and bogs, with trees overgrown in some areas. The mountains have multiple false summits where I started to be in disbelief. “It can’t possibly still be going up?!” The twenty mile days are over for awhile.","Jefferson Shelter

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617306,This part of the trail does not cease to amaze. The kinsmen Mountains were traversed in good weather. There was a beautiful pond on the way up the north kinsman. When I cleared the trees I could see the storm blowing in. I continued on and crossed Franconia notch and under the interstate before it started to rain. I was told to wait and do Franconia ridge on a good day if I could but they want money to stay at the shelters in the whites so my best option was to try for work for stay at the hut. Turns out I had a blast coming over that ridge. It was blowing so hard there was times I had to squat just to steady myself. The side trail to the hut said 1.1 miles bit felt like so much more. When I arrived work for stay is available but they told me to relax. I can work later. I have a tiny amount of signal and am finally warm and falling asleep on my feet.,"Eliza Shelter

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617452,"The hut was a good experience. Turns out, greenleaf doesn’t see many hikers because it’s 1000ft down and more than a mile off trail. I was so grateful for it. The crew was awesome to get to know and we helped them clean and then ate and ate. The food they cook is spectacular and if it’s not eaten it has to be hiked out, so the crew is actually thanking us in the end for being human dumpsters. After everything was done hikers took their place on the dining room floor to sleep. In the morning the storm had moved out and there was just a little bit of mist flagging on LaFayette Mountain. I stuck around to do work for breakfast, my favorite meal. I got a huge bowl of eggs and oatmeal with maple syrup. The hike out was beautiful and it was great to see the mountain and Franconia Ridge for the first time.After dropping out of the tree line there was a stretch and then Garfield mountain. Basically there has just been so much reward for the hiking, views and waterfalls. The Zeacliff hut is actually sustainable by using the waterfall next to it as hydroelectric source of energy. Zeacliff hut allowed me and Moonshine to WFS.

I was on trail at 0630. Ethan pond is a relatively flat trail but the trees are growing into the trail and wet with dew. I was soaked in the first mile. Luckily the first seven miles to Crawford Notch were pretty easy to crush. On the other side is straight up the mountain and goes up and up and up, and then up some more. There was a half mile traverse that was just a section of great views and steady elevation gain. When I made it to the top of Eisenhower most the climbing was over. The wind constantly blows and the views are expansive. Breathtaking. I can finally see Washington mountain.

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617644,"Finally a computer and a keyboard! When I awoke in the dungeon, I could have slept another four hours easy. The dungeon is the emergency shelter in the bottom of Lake in the Clouds Hut. It is still damp but it is cold and quiet, just the way I like it. Today has a chance of bad weather so I want to get to Mt. Washington as soon as possible. My feet hardly ever work first thing in the morning and I have to be really gentle until they are warmed up. Sometimes I feel legitimately broken. I decide to skip working for breakfast and get ready to get on trail. I say goodbye to Mac, the crew leader, and the Crew, and begin the summit of Mt. Washington.Mt. Washington was the first proposed northern terminus of the AT before Katahdin, and has the highest recorded winds. The weather itself is unpredictable and its actually quite difficult to summit on a perfect day. The climb to the top was steady and strenuous, not unlike everything prior. The big change is it got windy and chilly on the climb. Looking out at where I came from and where I am going is beautiful. In all honesty however, Washington is marred in every way by giant man made structures. There are towers, a huge concrete viewing platform with a building underneath equipped with concessions. There is the Top House, I don't even know what its purpose is, everything was closed. There is both a concrete road and huge parking lot to the top, and even a train, which of everything I think is the most original and acceptable. As a through hiker none of that matters, because it was still epic. There is also Katahdin, still with it's wild and protected summit.After that the trail makes it's way through the other peaks, but not over many of them unfortunately. Honestly, of all the presidents, my favorite was Madison. Its a lonely mountain with a tough ascent and descent, which gives it the feel of being even higher than Washington, with its steep sides. The way down is what me and moonshine have deemed the longest descent on the trail. Don't even care if its not true, but it sure felt that way getting to Pinkham Notch.Pinkham Notch put us at 15 miles for the day, and Moonshine and I were dragging hard. I was already cramping some and was worried I'd seize up on the trail and get stuck somewhere. I attempted it anyway. I was going to at least try and make it to the gondola on top of the wildcat range, another 2000 feet up. This is where I ran into Dan. He is the second person to ask if I was on trailjournals. Later on his trail magic enabled me to finish the hike. The hut food is good, and nutritious, but I swear they do not put salt in anything. I was thinking about this and I considered not having enough salt to be the reason for cramping so I ate the beef jerky and drank some tannin filled spring water. For whatever reason, I felt like my muscles had just enough left. When I got to the gondola the black flies were swarming so I decided to make the push for the hut. Also there was a chance of lightning and no real water source up there.By the time I rolled into Carter Notch it was way past dinner and I imagined it would be filled up. Luckily there was only one other hiker and I was able to do work for stay. On tomorrows entry I'll talk a lot more about the Hut system. but I am tired. Looking forward to a zero. I dont even have the strength to get caught up on entries, and I want to include all the details while I have access to a keyboard.","Lake in the Clouds Hut

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617734,"All the huts have a culture that has been passed down for a long time. One of the crew members is responsible for getting up and beginning breakfast. This particular hut the cook woke up her crew members by reading a poem. The people staying are woken up for breakfast with a song. When everyone gathers there is family style feeding and it reminds me a lot of camp. Part of the way through breakfast there is a funny skit acted out to encourage people to be prepared, leave no trace, and tip the crew members. There is also a ridge weather report (usually what is expected for Washington) read aloud. Then people scatter and gradually pack up and leave as the crew cleans up. The leftovers are gathered up and I am invited to eat with the crew. This is what happens at dinner as well. After food I get a chore or two. I’ve done a wide array of tasks from cleaning and consolidating the fridge, cleaning the stove and eyes, washing dishes, sweeping and tying cardboard up for recycling. It costs a normal patron 120$ to stay at a hut and I’m always so grateful to be able to for a bit of work. EV (eevee) the hut manager told me I should work a season. There are some seasons like winter where there is only one person to run the cabin. I think that would be really wonderful. Something to think about.As always it’s hard to say goodbye to my new friends (including moonshine) and take off for the day. The climb to the Dome of Carter is a cinch with a bit of sleep and a lot of food. A small kid stopped me and asked me why I wear handkerchiefs around my shoes. I laughed and explained the purpose of gaiters to him. Then I finished my summit and the summit of Mt. Hight and Moriah. Moriah was the best mountain to climb because it was just long stretches of sheer exposed granite. On the other hand in rain or snow it would be terrifying. This is my last chance to make arrangements with Morning Glory Farm, which is the farm I will work on after I summit katahdin. They also said they could pull me off trail in Gorham on my way through to get me fresh for the final round. I was going to camp at rattlesnake shelter which is the first free shelter since entering the whites. Instead we were able to work out extraction this afternoon so that I could have a full zero. Which is good, because some guys had a big fire going and a fifth of liquor they were gonna drink at the shelter, and the mosquitoes were more brutal than usual. They were climbing onto me even at a fast walk and I must have killed a hundred of them. The only bit of solace I got was when I jumped into rattlesnake river with its big crystal clear pools and took a preliminary bath. Also my knees and feet were beyond aching from the descent and days of abuse.The other place I found relief from the bugs was the parking lot on US 2. I was not there for five minutes when Christine showed up to take me to the farm. It was great to meet in person and she came bearing gifts of fresh picked strawberries from the field. She had promised me a home cooked meal but it was their kids night to cook and they chose to do takeout instead. She hoped that was ok and I said it was perfectly fine. So there is Eric and Christine and their kids Sophie and Elliot and two woofers on site. Including two woofers, as in dogs. WWOOF is worldwide organization of organic farmers, and it’s exactly that. It’s worldwide and for 40$ a year you gain access to all the farmers everywhere and can ask them if you can work on their farm. When you do, you are then called a woofer. The other two woofers are Bernie (sanders, in my head), and Dublin. Dublin instigates the woofing and Bernie follows. Today is easy. I basically just had to eat and get to know everyone.

There are two cows, with one pregnant, four goats, two sheep, a couple dozen laying hens, a bunch of meat birds, and baby meat birds. The pens for chickens and cows are  rotated around the pasture to give them fresh pasture to graze. After that we have breakfast together and go on the optional Bernie walk. Then the work day starts. The last two days has been trimming apples. Each tree is trying to make a thousand, when we would like a hundred apples. Around noon is lunch, and then the rest of the day is open, so very laid back. I’m enjoying the rest and the peace, while waiting on a package. Tonight I will prep a lot of morning chores so that they are easy in the morning because I will be doing a slack pack from Grafton Notch to US 2, which is 31 miles. It goes through a tough twenty miles of things like mahoosic notch, and old speck, the first being said is the hardest mile of the trail.  The last ten is a decent wind down being south bound.

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617988,"I DID IT!I hiked for 15 hours basically straight. Eric dropped me off this morning at Grafton Notch and I started hiking SOBO for the first time. My day started with old speck and it’s tower which was off trail but easy and worth it. The tower is steel and what’s unique about it is that it has a ladder instead of stairs which is pretty intimidating. The view was noble, with the mountains still lying in the morning haze. As I hiked away from old speck I could see it multiple times always getting farther away. First was before the mahoosic arm, which was a pretty steep descent. Then after the mahoosic notch on the top of a mountain before goose eye, and all three summits of goose eye. The climb over those peaks was strenuous but beautiful. I basically bonked out a bit after the gooses. After going over mount success (in my head “success I’m halfwayish!”) I ran into some people that pointed the way to a crashed plane. I’ve yet to do the research but there was definitely a passenger plane, or what was left of it, in the woods. I found one whole wing, some pieces of engine, and was able to go inside the passenger section and the toilet was still there. Probably the highlight of my hike. The mental game of doing so many miles over tough terrain was strong. One of the hardest parts was knowing that bailout wasn’t easy. So I kept a gradual pace from the beginning and am glad I did because I was running on fumes towards the end. I saw some people that I was hiking with in the whites. Finally got a message from T and CC jones. They are in the whites but CCJones is pretty close. However with the slacking I’m technically in Maine now.

Some things I forgot to mention. I met a double triple crowner named voyager. I don’t know who he is but others made it seem like he’s pretty famous. Double triple crowner means he’s done all three long trails twice.
Also I saw a moose on my slack pack.
Today I say bye for three weeks give or take, and it’s hard to do. Elliot offered a ride in on his way to work and I’m glad he did or I definitely would have zeroed again.
I think I’ve learned all I need to from this hike, now all that’s left is the follow through. It’s good to know that I’m choosing to finish rather than needing to finish. I think a big misconception is that something magical happens on top of katahdin and lives are changed forever. The only thing that should change for me is that it’s just one more thing to add to the list, that with gods help, I saw through to the end in sobriety. The rest of the changes are always happening and ongoing.  There is nothing exterior of myself that is going to fix me. No food or hike or companion is going to fill the hole in my spirit. And definitely no drink. But when I’m quiet enough and I sit and listen to the wind, and open up to the energy everywhere, I realize there is no hole.
Anyway. I loved the climb up bald pates. At one point I was in between what I climbed up and had yet to climb and felt like I was on a cliff. After that I was unusually tired and the bugs are out in a force like I’ve never seen before. Actually when I got to camp I had no good way of protecting myself from them without creating a sauna in my sleeping bag, which I did anyway. The buzzing was loud and didn’t abate until 1330. Never fully went away all night. 
Oh yeah, and I got attacked by a grouse. It came at me hard, feathers fluffed making it look the size of a chicken. At first I ran two steps out of being startled. It kept running so instinctively I switched from flight to fight and kicked it. It half jumped half connected with my foot and decided to try to lure me away instead. I was curious at what it was guarding but it started hissing when I’d go the other way. It policed me until it felt I was far enough away and then watched me walk on. I apologized for kicking it and said that I was scared and it made some noise but I have no idea what the answer was. So yeah, watch out for angry birds I guess!","Grafton Notch

The miles were easy but they were hard mentally. Unfortunately I forgot most of what happened two days ago but I saw a moose, a big one this time. I also got attacked by another bird and just harassed by the third. The second one started charging me and I just planted my feet and raised my hands and bellowed “HEY! I KNOW WHAT YOUR DOING, STOP IT!” As effective as a kick. Before I got to bemis mountain it got dark with clouds and there was thunder. I was concerned but I went over anyway.

I miss my hammock. When I left I explored “the caves” which is really a jumble of rocks but they are huge and tricky to find the way through. More like what I thought mahoosic notch was gonna be like. After that I needed to explore the privy which was interesting because it had two toilets. No wall or anything.

He used fuck in at least every other word no matter the subject, and the tone was rotten. Presented in a way that didn’t even leave room to help.So I pushed on.

There was a fifth of fireball whiskey in the hut last night. But the hitch was the most interesting. I stuck my thumb out and waved and a truck pulled over to pick me up. The passenger was drinking a beer and toasted and the truck smelled of weed which seems pretty common anymore. They said they could give me a lift as far as Eustice, and I said I just needed to go to Stratton. Neither of us knew what the other was talking about, turns out they are basically the same thing. They offered me weed and whiskey and I told them about doing the whole hike in sobriety. They were cool about it. We almost passed the post office and instead of turning around and going back we just slid into the parking lot tires squealing a bit. The passenger was having a blast and when I knew we didn’t hit anything or flip I thought it was fun too. We said bye and I went inside to mail my hammock home.

I said thanks for the ride, and he actually said “thanks for not killing me” because he originally picked me up as a plain hitchhiker.

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619110,"Today I beat my slacking mileage. There is no way to get in and out of the wilderness so we had to pay 15$ a person to get in on a private logging road, and would have had to do so again if we didn’t hike out of the zone. So we did. There were beautiful views of katahdin and many ponds and mosquitoes. We played hiking games while hiking to keep our minds off our feet and the last ten miles were still very difficult.It was all fun though, and tomorrow is an easy day, and then we summit. There is a few of us that are going up on Saturday, and I’m looking forward to it.","Mary jo rd

There is world class kayaking up here! I could live here! ATVs and kayaking, infinite hiking, and so much more. Plus I’d like to get tired of snow... couldn’t imagine that. We followed the river and saw waterfall after waterfall including miniature niagra falls.We made it to the ranger station and registered to hike into Baxter the next day. It’s becoming more real at this point.","Abol bridge

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619216,"I woke up this morning and was not stoked. Honestly I have constantly developed a barrier at the ultimate points in my life. Probably something to do with PTSD. I think I subconsciously protect myself until it actually becomes real. That developed from my drinking days when I would find myself on the other side of a special moment in my life... but having sabotaged it with drinking. I used to not think I was worth good things in life. I was extremely pessimistic and would think life would eventually take the good things away anyway... so I would destroy them in advance so that I could stay in control. I have since learned to love and forgive myself and allow good things into my life.
Starting on the trail and seeing the beautiful crystal clear water of katahdin stream I started allowing myself to get excited. By the time I broke tree line I was finally stoked about being where I was. The weather was PERFECT. The surroundings were EPIC. I really underestimated the power of climbing this mountain. The wind was pushing on us a bit, making it more exciting. 
We took our time climbing up and KO did great with her fractured arm. The hunts trail is a bunch of boulder climbing and peaks out a mile or so before the actual summit which was kind of surprising.
To be honest I was very unaware of how I actually felt upon summit. It’s really hard to believe. I feel like I could wake up from a dream and still be in the rocks of Pennsylvania. Which would be a nightmare. But... as I walked towards Knifes Edge, I started accepting that I was finished. Still not sure how I feel because it’s still unbelievable. It’ll sink in in the next days.
So in my opinion the Pamola Peak looks taller and cooler than the katahdin summit. Absolutely 100% though, I’m so glad I was able to hike out Knifes Edge. As with many rumors with the AT, it was not nearly as intense as people claimed but intense nonetheless. The only things that matched the rumors was Pennsylvania rocks and Wilderness mosquitoes.
I am so glad for the adventure, but I’m definitely ready to take what I learned and apply it to the rest of my life. I’m absolutely ready for life after the trail. Definitely looking forward to exploring. I have met so many people, and heard of so many awesome places, and won’t even need to go overseas. But will try and do that too. The other long trails are in my future. One thing I miss is being incorporated in my sobriety network, which was such a supportive group of family and friends which are also family. I’m so grateful for everyone that met me and helped me. I realize my entries were not always amazing, maybe sometimes offensive, but it was important to me to be genuine for when I go back and read my entries in the future. If I helped somehow I give any credit to God. 
Shortly I will be going back to the farm to be at peace and process this journey. We are expecting a baby calf in August and I am looking forward to watching the apples and tomatoes grow. I will do that for a month before going to work and be with family til a beach trip to Topsail Island NC. Near the end of September I’ll have initiated the process of getting my license back and started to get myself reincorporated back into Asheville. All these are subject to change as the trail has shown me. Make a plan, but be able to stay present and willing to change.
Bless you all.

Stray (formerly B),https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619283,"Today I said a long goodbye to IT, KO, and Flip as we drove to Bangor. We had a great last feast of hibachi grill and then they checked into the hotel. I got to spend about thirty minutes with them there before finally actually saying goodbye.
Then Christine picked me up to take me to Morning Glory Farm where I caught up with everyone and had dinner. Later I was helping Eric bring the cows in when we realized that Lily the cow had had her baby very recently. It was something I wanted to be here for and she wasn’t due til the fifth of August so I feel very blessed. Even though the trail is over, life is only beginning.",,View Entry,"Jul 21, Sun",0
