Bad Habit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614231,"My trail name is Bad Habit and, like every other hiker, I have a few screws loose.  When things get me down or when my job gets to be too much, I start looking at maps.  Then all hell breaks loose.  
  
I’m 47 years old and I live in Delaware.  Earlier this year, I tried to hike a section of the Appalachian Trail from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to Harper’s Ferry, West Virginia (106 trail miles).   On my third day hiking south of Harrisburg, my boots tore apart in the rocks and I had to turn around.  Eventually, my left foot turned into something resembling a bloody hamburger patty.  Eventually, I realized that my failure had more to do with poor preparation than a lack of willpower or ability.  I vowed to return.  
Now, I’ve planned a new hike in the Spring of 2019.  I haven’t set a date or chosen the exact route yet, but I want to spend at least a week or two on the Appalachian Trail in the Mid-Atlantic.  Read along with me and see if I can make it this time or if I end up failing again.

Bad Habit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614232,"I’ve been working out a couple of times a week at the gym and I took a hiking class at an REI store to improve my chances of reaching my goal this time.  The instructor showed us the equipment that he used when he did a thru hike.  He also showed us how much food to carry, where to resupply, how to plan zero days, and how much a backpack should weigh.   I was rammy last hike, which led me to make poor decisions. This time, I’m going to start out on a slower pace and try to enjoy myself, which will hopefully increase my chances of success.  Hope I can stay motivated to work out over the holidays!",,View Entry,"Dec 04, Tue",0
Bad Habit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614233,"I didn’t get to work out over the holidays.  Now that I’m back, though, my legs feel great!  I bought a new down sleeping bag, a lighter stove and lightweight raingear.  The weather in the spring is all over the place and I want to be prepared for both the heat and the cold.  I’ve studied the logistics of getting to and from the Appalachian Trail between West Virginia and the Hudson River.  Doesn’t look like finding water or buying food as I go will be a problem.  I’m planning on leaving in late April/early May depending on my work schedule.   Not sure if I want to start from Harper’s Ferry and hike north or start from the Hudson River or the Delaware Water Gap and hike south.  All three plans have advantages and disadvantages.  Regardless, it will be game on later this spring.  Can’t wait!!!",,View Entry,"Feb 19, Tue",0

My pack felt heavier than I wanted it to, so I committed to reevaluate everything before I left.  My eleventh hour to-do-list included updating the weather app on my phone, spraying my clothes with Permetherin (a long lasting insect repellant), driving to the post office to stop my mail, and learning how to use the Guthooks app properly.

Bad Habit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614240,"Today was absolutely the most incredible day of my life.  I proposed to my fiancé Deirdre.  She is a strong and special woman who is a very hard worker, a great mother to her children, and is stunningly gorgeous.  How did I get so lucky?  I have no idea.  At least she said yes!!!  As hikers, we all tend to forget how much stress we put on our loved ones.  Deirdre has been amazing and has supported me every step of the way.  She makes me feel strong.  This hike would not have been possible without her.    

Things are starting to get real.  On the first day of the hike, the train wouldn’t get to Harper’s Ferry until 5:15 pm, so I have about two and a half hours to hike over six miles to the first shelter.  Not a big deal, but I’ve never night hiked before.  I’ve started thinking about all the problems that crept into the hike last year: trail washouts, heat, a bad plan, and a backpack that was way too heavy and contained the wrong equipment.  I picked up my backpack and it felt lighter than it did when I packed it.  Was it light enough or was I just pumped up on adrenaline?  No way to know for sure until I start.  Here it goes!",,View Entry,"Apr 21, Sun",0
Bad Habit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614242,"At 10:30 am, I walked out my front door and the trip was underway!  My first destination was the transit hub on Main Street in Newark, Delaware, a couple of miles from my house.  I tried to get there quickly, which made the walk seem much longer than it really was.  I need to cut that out.  I also remembered how many non-trail miles that I would be walking.  Today’s total is 6.8 trail miles, but I walked much farther than that.  I caught the bus and switched to an Amtrak train in Wilmington, DE that took me to Washington, DC.  I ate a meal in Union Station in Washington and switched trains again. The train to Harper’s Ferry was like a throwback to the 1920s.   I boarded and went through a series of tight corridors with no windows and up a set of steps that turned three corners before finding my seat.   
  
Finally, I arrived in Harper’s Ferry.  All I could think about was making the shelter before dark.   The weather was perfect and it felt great to be outside.   My hike started in the center of the historic town.  Then, the trail crossed an old railroad bridge that passed over the rocky rapids of the Shenandoah and Potomac Rivers.  Next, the trail follows a towpath along the Potomac River for about 3 miles next to the ruins from a Civil War Era canal.  Then came the hard part: the first climb. 
  
The trail turns north from the towpath and climbs up a mountain.  The elevation change from the river to the ridgeline over the Weaverton Cliffs is about 1100’.  At first, I became winded and my legs were burning.  After a quick break, I caught my breath and started back up the hill.  My legs feel so much better than last year!  I made it to the top in no time at all.  I was stoked.  
  
The walk along the ridgeline was pleasant and easy.  Beautiful valleys stretched out on either side of the mountain.  I arrived at the shelter at about 7:30, in the daylight, well before dark.  All of that worrying for nothing!  I met a guy from Kansas with a fluffy beard who was fun to talk to.  He was going to sleep in the shelter with another guy.  I’ve never actually slept in a shelter before.  Usually, I just pitch a tent.  This shelter, however, was unique.  It had an upstairs area that was enclosed.  No one was up there, so I figured this was as good a time as any to give it a try.  Hung my bear bag on the pole and climbed into my sleeping bag.   To my chagrin, I discovered that my air mattress had a leak and wouldn’t stay inflated; had to sleep directly on the hard floor.  UGH!  I heard howling sounds in the distance and dug in for the night.  All in all, today was a great start to the hike.","Harper's Ferry, West Virginia

Bad Habit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614245,"It rained overnight and I was happy to be in the dry shelter.  Today’s plan was to hike 8 miles to Rocky Run Shelters and see how I felt.  If things went well, I wanted to push on an additional three miles to a tenting area.  Nice easy pace.  
  
The trail started on the ridgeline and then wound down a hill, emerging in the middle of a civil war battlefield with ruins, a monument and a covered picnic area.  Took a short break to eat and climbed a steep hill coming out of the park.  Then, the trail passed through lush, green woods.  I arrived at Rocky Run Shelter early in the early afternoon and decided to keep going. The terrain was easy, but I finally started to feel a little bit tired.  The last two miles seemed to last forever.  
  
I arrived at the Dahlgren Backpacker Campground at around 2:30 in the afternoon.  There was a rectangular tan brick building with a bathroom, showers and electric outlets for charging phones.  Luxury!  I pulled out my phone and looked at the weather forecast.  Storms were coming.  

The guy from Kansas passed through the camp before I set up my tent.  He told me that there was a very nice restaurant about a mile away, but I didn’t go.  He went to the road to make a call and didn’t come back.  Another guy came into camp right behind Kansas.  He was quiet and did some yoga after he set up his tent.  I only spoke to him for a minute.  He had a foreign accent, but I couldn’t place it.  I pitched my tent, hung my bear bag, and covered my backpack to protect it from the rain that was coming.  These mundane things would be afterthoughts back home.  Out here, they captured my complete attention.   I crawled into my tent well before hiker’s midnight (dusk).   It felt really good to lie in my tent and rest.","Ed Garvey Shelter
",Dahlgren Backpack Campground,"Apr 25, Thu",10.80
Bad Habit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614246,"I got a few good hours of sleep, which was a bonus.  It rained hard around 1:00 am, but the camp was surprisingly dry in the morning.   A third hiker had arrived and pitched a tent sometime overnight and I didn’t hear him.  I drained my phone battery looking at the radar overnight and had to recharge it before I left.  This observation would lead me to a bad decision later in the day. 
  
The morning was cold and foggy despite a steady wind.  I climbed up a steep hill and emerged in Washington Monument State Park.  There actually was a Washington Monument at the top of the hill!  I passed a few day hikers that smelled fragrant.  After a few days in the woods, they stick out like sore thumbs.  The Washington Monument was closed due to a lightning strike and a fire.  I kept pushing up the hill and reached a nice, flat ridgeline.  Then, I reached the footbridge along I-70.  I had seen this bridge when I was a kid and had always wanted to cross it.  Now I have! 
  
After the bridge, I stopped at Pine Knob Shelter to eat lunch.  I met a 70 year old guy whose trail name was Chili.  He was in great shape.  The foreign guy came in behind me.  We all sat and ate together.  The foreign guy’s name was Richard.  He was French and from Montreal.  He also started in Harper’s Ferry and was going to hike for three months.  He and Chili hit it off.  Chili was a guitarist who liked obscure French Jazz music.  A young couple showed up and they were talkative as well.  Richard, Chili and I left the shelter at about the same time.  Chili charged ahead very quickly while Richard and I leapfrogged each the rest of the day.  
  
After the shelter, the trail continued along a ridgeline and was relatively flat for a long time, with beautiful vistas overlooking the valley through the thick fog.  The trail descended a hill and arrived at the Pogo Memorial Campground, where I took a wrong turn in the rocks and went down a steep hill.  I could have stayed at the Campground and rode out the thunderstorms that I knew were coming, but I didn’t look at the radar because I was afraid to drain the battery.   If I had done so, I would have seen that there were really strong storms bearing down on the mountain.  
Then, after two and a half days of relatively easy hiking, things started to get hard.  First, the rocks appeared.  There were fields of them that lasted for miles.  Knee-high rocks that pushed me from side to side as I tried to crawl over or through them.  My pace slowed to a crawl.  Then, the heavens opened up.  Driving rain tore out of the sky and made each rock into a slippery landmine.  The storm brought lightning and I was high up along a ridgeline, so I had to keep moving to get to lower ground.  Going down the steep hill on the wet, jagged rocks started killing my knees.   Finally, I reached the shelter.  By this time, I was completely exhausted and the temperature began to plunge.  The wind picked up and howled.  Luckily, my raingear kept me dry.  There were seven other people piled into the shelter.  I was too tired and sore to pitch my tent, so I took a spot on top of one of the bunks and dug in for a long, cold windy night.","Dahlgren Backpack Campground

Bad Habit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614248,"Sleeping on the hard plywood floor of the shelter without an air mattress didn’t make for a good night of rest.  I had to roll over about every twenty minutes to keep the pressure off my knees or back, depending on my position.  Luckily, my new sleeping bag kept me warm despite the strong wind and temperatures that dipped to near freezing.  
  
Today was sunny and cold with a stiff, sustained wind.  The trail continued to be rocky and tough to navigate.  I got off course a couple of times and had to backtrack.  I told Richard that I would see him soon, but I got ahead of him and never saw him again.  The trail came to a very steep downhill section that went into a hollow with a large creek at the bottom.  Then, it climbed up a steep, rocky cliff.  This was the most difficult climb of the trip for me to date.  When I got to the top of the cliff, the trail leveled out into a nice ridgeline walk.  Phew!  I dodged some more rocks and ended up taking a break at Raven Rock Shelter to eat lunch.  I expected company, but no one else showed. 
  
The cold wind howled all day.  It was too warm to wear my jacket, but too cold without it.  The rocks just kept piling up and my knees hurt badly.  Finally, I reached a Vista called “High Rocks” at the top of the ridge.  The view was stunning and I was only three miles from the Pennsylvania boarder.  Unfortunately, the way down to Penn Mar was a steep decline through a very thick rock field.  I really struggled down that hill.  The Guthooks app claimed that there was a snack bar at the park, so I kept motivated by thinking about hot dogs.  
  
Eventually, I emerged from the rocks in Penn Mar Park.  The snack bar was closed.  DOH!  No worries, time to head into town for a much needed resupply and a hotel room.  I crossed the Mason-Dixon Line and entered Pennsylvania.  That’s when things started to fall apart.  I couldn’t find a ride to town from Uber or Lyft and I drained my phone’s batteries.   I looked at the map.  It was five miles to the hotel where I wanted to stay.  I had to walk; no choice.  All these miles were off the trail and go unrecorded, which hurts mentally.  I had a sinking feeling in my stomach that I was making a bad decision, but I started walking.  Finally, I reached town and used my last energy to walk to the hotel.
  
Unfortunately, there was a wedding at the hotel and there were no rooms available.  I was devastated.  There was no way I was walking back to the trail tonight.  I didn’t have it in me.  The lady behind the counter gave me the name of a shuttle driver  who gave people rides to and from the trail.  I called him and he said that he had to make several runs and that I should call him back in about two hours.  
  
I walked down to Applebee’s and ate a big meal.  Then, I resupplied at WalMart.  I found a camping mat to replace my air mattress.  I was happy about having something softer than the ground to sleep on, but carrying the mat turned out to be very difficult.  I had to tie it to the bottom of my pack.  It kept swinging and coming loose.  
  
At this point, I desperately needed to recharge my phone and went back to the hotel.  A new lady was behind the counter.  She let me charge my phone and I called the driver back, but he had turned his phone off.  I was starting to get nervous.  Then, the lady gave me the name of another guy who gave rides to and from the trail named Dennis.  Dennis answered the phone and said that he would be by in about two hours.  Ok, that was good.  Dennis called back early and said to come meet him at the WalMart.  
Dennis was a great guy.  He had been hauling hikers around for decades and told me some great stories.  I explained my situation to him and he told me about another hotel located four miles away in Waynesboro.  Hooray!!! He took me to the hotel and said that he would be back in the morning to pick me up and take me back to the trail.  Thank you Dennis, you really saved me.","Ensign Cowall Shelter 
","Waynsboro, PA","Apr 27, Sat",9.80
Bad Habit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614251,"I slept like a baby. My alarm went off without incident and I packed up and headed down to meet Dennis.  A guy that I didn’t recognize was waiting for me.  He told me to hop into the car, which I did.  I asked him who he was picking up and he said that he didn’t know, someone had called him and asked for a ride.  I realized that this must have been the other drive that I talked to yesterday and that he was here to pick up someone else.  I told him that I was the wrong guy.  He was a really friendly guy like Dennis.  When I got out, I saw that my sleeping bag had fallen out of my pack when I climbed into the car.  If I had gone to the trail with him, I would have lost my sleeping bag.  Yikes!
Dennis showed up and said that he was picking up two other people from the hotel as well.  Two other middle aged guys arrived to share the ride.  They knew all the hiking terminology and talked at length about their equipment.  They ignored Dennis, but Dennis talked about the history of the town and showed us very old houses from the early Nineteenth Century that were still standing.  He was a really interesting guy.  
  
When we got back to Pen Mar, it was raining and cold.  Dennis dropped us off and the two other guys parted ways, one heading north, the other south.  When the northbound guy and I started up the trail, two State Cops approached us.  They explained that a child had gone missing and asked us who we were, where were going, what we had seen, etc.  It was really creepy.  I passed through a nice tent site and started a steep, wet climb.  Climbs that start first thing in the morning are very tough for me.  Today, however, I felt good and powered through it fairly quickly.  
  
After my tough day in the rocks yesterday, I planned to hike a short 8 mile day to Tumbling Run Shelters and rest my knees.  Once I reached Tumbling Run, I would be entering a twenty mile stretch of trail that was familiar to me from previous weekend hikes.  That section was fairly rock free, but there were two huge hills to climb.  I was dreading the first hill; it always kicked my behind.  
  
The morning went well.  After eating and sleeping, I felt unexpectedly strong.  Also, the lure of crossing into familiar territory really lifted my spirits.  Then, I figured out how to properly tie off my sleeping pad to the bottom of my backpack.  Problem solved!  Walking in southern PA was definitely much easier than walking in Northern Maryland.  I crossed a fast moving and swollen creek.  On my old maps, there was a shelter here called Antietam Shelter, but it didn’t show up on the Guthhooks app.  I saw that there was a shelter set up on an island in the creek.  No wonder it wasn’t on the app, I wouldn’t feel safe sleeping there!  
  
After the creek, it stopped raining, but the trail was really wet and muddy.  At this point, I started feeling so good that I decided to change my plans.  I would not take an easy day; I would push on to the next shelter, even though that would mean hiking about 15 miles.    
  
Time to climb the hill after Tumbling Run Shelter.  It hid deviously in the tree line, concealing its true height and contained several false tops.  An hour later, I reached the top, a vista called Buzzard Point.  My nemesis was behind me.  Phew!  After that, the trail traveled along a ridgeline for about six miles, followed by a small climb up to Rocky Mountain.  I made it to the shelter at about 5:00 feeling great.   
  
While I rested at the shelter, the temperature took a nosedive.  I couldn’t get warm sitting at the picnic table.  Two guys from Maine came into camp. They were very interesting people and shared stories about living in Boston and about exploring caves.  Night time was very cold, but all of the extra clothes that I packed and my sleeping bag kept me warm enough.  Caledonia State Park was right down the hill three miles ahead.  I felt really good about my progress and looked forward to using the amenities at the park in the morning.","Waynsboro, PA
",Rocky Mountain Shelter,"Apr 28, Sun",14.80
Bad Habit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614252,"I didn’t sleep much, mostly from trying to stay wrapped up and warm.  I thought about taking a short day and resting in Caledonia State Park, but I got stubborn.  I just set my mind on making it to the Birch Run Shelter, 13 miles ahead.  
  
The three mile hike to the park lasted forever and I wasn’t in a very good mood.  When I walked into the park office, the heat was on inside the building and I realized how cold it really was outside.  I used the indoor restroom, charged my phone and filled up my water bottles at the water fountain.  A couple walked in and talked to me about what I was doing.  The lady was really interested and asked a lot of questions.  After my phone was charged I headed out to tackle another big climb that would take me to the highest elevation point along my planned route.  
  
The hill was very steep as I expected, but it went on a lot longer than I remembered.  Luckily, I had the chance to stop and eat lunch at the Quarry Gap Shelters.  This place is the absolute Mecca of shelters.  It sits right next to a trickling stream in the middle of a rhododendron forest.  There is a picket fence, flowers, a checkers set, several tables, a really nice fire pit with a cooking gate, and even garden gnomes for decoration.  Hats off to the caretaker, this shelter is simply amazing.  
  
After Quarry Gap, the trail passed through quite a bit of varied terrain.  There were evergreen forests that were so dense they blocked out the daylight, thick bush, dirt roads, and all kinds of intersecting side trails.  Two guys on dirt bikes with expensive video equipment attached to their bikes passed though.  Then, I stumbled upon another hiker who was moving about the same pace as I was.  We kept passing each other just like I had done with Richard.  This guy and I didn’t say much to each other.  
  
By the middle of the day, I hit the wall.  I took longer and more frequent breaks while the quiet guy and I kept leapfrogging each other.  My knees were starting to ache again and I felt drained.  The last three miles seemed like a different day all to themselves.  The terrain was easy, but I was barely up to the challenge.  By the time I got to camp, I was totally spent.
  
The campsite at Birch Run Shelter was full of people.  Eight hikers were already in the shelter when I arrived and there were about eight tents as well.  I couldn’t get any phone service down in the valley and neither could anyone else.  I met a guy named Dillon who had brought a guitar with him.  He had worked construction for a year to save up for this hike.  There was also a guy who met two other ladies on the trail.  They had decided to hike together for a few days.  He was an equipment enthusiast and had a pack filled with super lightweight, interesting devices.    
  
I grabbed one of the spots on the upper level of the shelter before more people showed up and sat down to eat.  I was very hungry and felt bad.  Dillon wanted to make a fire.  I told him that I would help thinking that I would feel better after I ate.  I didn’t feel better and I couldn’t move.  I was actually concerned by how depleted I felt.  Two more thru hikers showed up.  One of them lost his spoon so he was trying to carve a new one out of wood.  One of the ladies talked with him about going to carving class.   
The campsite was full of interesting people, and I wanted to hang out for a while, but I was too tired.  I didn’t even spend much time planning the next day.  I just climbed into my sleeping bag and laid there.  I fell asleep before dusk while most of the others were socializing around Dillon’s campfire.","Rocky Mountain Shelter
",Birch Run Shelter,"Apr 29, Mon",13
Bad Habit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614254,"This morning felt much warmer and my energy came back.  Today was shaping up to be a good day.  I ate breakfast and filled up my water bottles from the babbling brook that ran along the edge of camp.  The plan was to hike about 10 miles to Pine Grove Furnace State Park and then camp three miles past that at a tent site.  The General Store in the park offers the Thru Hiker Ice Cream Challenge.  Traditionally, many thru hikers eat a whole half gallon of ice cream in one sitting.  The ice cream wasn’t for me, but I did need supplies from the store.  
  
The trail started out following a rocky creek bed that meandered down a hill.  I passed the equipment enthusiast and the two women that he was hiking with.  The women were laughing loudly and having a lot of fun.  The quiet guy passed me again and we talked for the first time.  He was a good guy.  A bit later, I found a small sign that marked the halfway point of the entire Appalachian Trail!   I had heard that the original sign burned down in a forest fire.  It didn’t look like there was a fire here, but about a quarter of a mile later, the aftermath of the fire became apparent.  There were burned trees everywhere.  Even though the fire was a couple of years ago, the area still smelled like ash.  The day was going great.  I was making good progress and anxious to tackle the large descent into the park.  Then, disaster struck.
  
Each step suddenly became incredibly painful.  My right knee felt as though someone had stuck a knife in it.  I had to hold my leg out perfectly straight just to walk.  Eventually, I was reduced to taking three or four steps and then stopping.  I had been dealing with knee pain for a couple of days, but this was something different.  Luckily, I reached Tom’s Run Shelter pretty quickly.  Time to take a break and assess the situation.  
  
The equipment enthusiast and his posse and the quiet guy arrived at about the same time.  We all ate a snack together.  The girls chatted and I just listened.  When everyone left, I stayed behind.  I had to make a decision.  I considered just staying here at the shelter for the night or I could push on down to the park and stay there.  I also started to consider that I might have to come off the trail.  The park was four grueling miles away.  I decided to make myself get there and then figure out what to do next.  
  
When I stood up and put on my pack, I felt a little bit better and started to walk.  Then the pain hit me like a ton of bricks.  I knew right there that I was done.  It was bitterly disappointing.  I was about eight miles from the spot where I had to stop last year coming from the other direction.  My anger built.  I knew that I had done this to myself by failing to rest properly. Then, my mood changed and my anger passed.  This thing happened and there was nothing that I could do about it now.  This hike had been amazing.  I enjoyed every minute of it, both the good parts and the bad parts.  I felt at ease and far from beaten.  
  
The last four miles were a rocky, muddy, downhill section that never seemed to end.  About two miles into it, I found a second monument that claimed to be the exact center of the Appalachian Trail.  I was confused.  I would have to figure out what this meant later.  Finally, I reached the far edge of the park and there were a number of very nice cabins along the trail.  Then, I found the General Store.  There were a lot of people sitting in front of the store eating lunch that I didn’t recognize.  I dropped my pack and made a straight line for the front door, my vision clouded by hallucinations of a chili cheese dog.  When I reached the door, I saw the bad news.  The store was still closed for the season.  !@#$!
  
Now came the next problem: getting to the train station in Harrisburg.  I tried to open Uber on my phone.  There was no service at all.  Now what?  I walked off the porch and across the little road and found a spot where there was service.  Awesome.  I called for an Uber car.  There were none available.  Then I tried Lyft.  That didn’t work at all.  I decided to try Uber one more time before I officially panicked.  It worked.  A driver was on the way to come get me.
  
I sat down on the well manicured grass across from the Ironmasters Mansion, the General Store, and the Appalachian Trail Museum.  My hike was over; I was on my way home.  Before I could fully process what that meant, the quiet guy came up to talk to me.  I told him that I was hurt.  He told me that he was a thru hiker, which surprised me.  Most thru hikers walk much faster than he did.  He had an incredible story.  He had started in Georgia in February, but had gotten sick.  He came off the trail and was diagnosed with bronchitis.  He went back home and rested for two weeks, then he went back to resume his hike.  He instantly realized that he couldn’t go on and had to come back home again.  Then, his doctor told him that he had pneumonia.  He chuckled at how expensive the preparation and all the traveling had been.  Now, two months later, he had gone to Harpers Ferry to start again and try to do the north half of the trail.  This guy just didn’t know the meaning of the word “quit”.  He told me to go home and rest for a while and then come back.  I felt inspired by him and wished him luck.  I hope he makes it to Maine this year, he definitely deserves to.  
  
The Uber driver showed up and we were off to Harrisburg.  I told her about the police at Penn Mar and she told me that they had found the little girl who was missing.  Even more bizarrely, she told me that she was pretty sure that a lady with whom she was facebook friends was the mother of the guy who had abducted the girl.  She was disturbed by this because she thought that the woman’s family was going to be ostracized.  What a story!
  
The Uber driver left me in the train station and I began to retrace the steps that I had taken last year when I came off the trail due to an injury.  It felt surreal to be doing it again.  I caught an Amtrak train to Philadelphia, ate a cheese steak, and then caught a commuter train to Newark, Delaware.  The last two miles that I walked from the train station to my house were slow and pleasant.  My hike was over.","Birch Run Shelter

Bad Habit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614255,"After I returned home, I couldn’t stop thinking about the trail.  My knee still hurts pretty badly, but I’m hoping that it’s just a sprain.  I’ll see how that goes over the next couple of days.  I looked into the center-point markers of the Appalachian Trail.  Apparently, the first marker that I encountered was the official center of the trail for 2018.  The length of the trail changes each year and someone recalculates the location of its center and moves the smaller monument to that point.  The larger monument stays in the same place as a more permanent memorial.  Pretty cool. 
  
Last year, when I got home, I felt like a failure.  This year, I feel very differently.  This hike has been an overwhelmingly positive experience, despite my injury.   If I had enough time off work to let my knee rest, I would head right back out there and keep going.  I want to thank my fiancée Deirdre.  She supported me every step of the way and is the best thing that has ever happened to me.  Without her, I could not have done any of this.
  
Good luck to everyone who has read this.  May your hikes be filled with adventure.
Until next time...
