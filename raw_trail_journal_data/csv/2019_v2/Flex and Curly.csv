Flex and Curly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617926,"It’s hard to believe, but 10 months have passed since Curly and  I left the trail!  Hiking 1863.7 miles from Springer to Madison Springs Hut, it was extremely difficult to make that decision to get off trail, and over these past ten months, we have missed the trail deeply.So here we are, preparing to pick up where we left off almost a year ago. While we won’t be able to finish this year, the plan is to get in about 70 miles  and maybe wrap it up next year.  We are excited to tackle this part of the trail, and are certainly approaching it with a different mindset from a year ago.  With 327 miles remaining in this hike, I personally have been humbled by this trail and look forward to the adventures it will give us this summer!",,View Entry,"Jul 02, Tue",0
Flex and Curly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618002,"Folks who hike this trail, no matter section or thru, all pretty much agree that the trail gets into your blood.  It really becomes a part of your life pre and post trail.  We definitely went through withdrawal afterwards and resolved to get back on trail in the summer of 2019.


In April, we hiked the trail with our great friends the Cosby’s from Beauty Spot to Carvers Gap, taking us over Roan Mountain. That definitely reminded us of all that we were missing. We also went to Trail Days in Damascus in May and walked the parade with the class of 2018.  Most of the folks that we enjoyed the trail with last year showed up and it was one big hiker reunion.


Now we are back in New England and following our annual family reunion on the 4th in Wells, Maine, we  are going to drop our vehicle at Grafton Notch and cousin Alyssa will transport us down to Gorham for a bright and early start on the 5th.  Today is simply about enjoying family and the beauty of Maine’s coastline. Bring on the “chowdah”!",,View Entry,"Jul 03, Wed",0
Flex and Curly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618036,"What a day!  Spent most of the day with Curly’s extended family in Wells, Maine celebrating our nations independence. Awesome food,  great family, and a beautiful day made for a memorable 4th!


We got on the road about 3pm headed to Grafton Notch, about a 2 hour drive.  Maine has some of the most beautiful scenery in the country, and we took all backroads for an amazing slice of Americana.  We parked our truck at the trailhead parking lot, and with Old Speck in the background, headed west towards Gorham, NH.   Stopped at Rattle River Hostel and dropped our resupply package there in advance of our Sunday arrival.  Then on to the hotel and a late dinner.  


We are in bed now and ready for a great nights rest. Tomorrow we head up valley view trail to Madison Spring Hut and head north on the AT.  Can’t wait to get this party started!!",,View Entry,"Jul 04, Thu",0
Flex and Curly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618159,"3.1 miles from Madison Spring Hut to Osgood Tentsite


Today was not the best first day back ever. Matter of fact, for me (Flex), it was probably one of the most discouraging, physically painful days I’ve ever had on the trail. It definitely was not how I envisioned the beginning of our hike going.


span class=""Apple-converted-space""> No rain, plenty of sunshine and an early start time of 715am.  We parked at the Valley Way trailhead, which is where we got off last year.  The distance to the Hut was 3.8 miles. All I can say is that neither of us remember the trail being as difficult as it was! Possibly the fact that it was all up...gaining elevation over boulders and rocks were just as hard as I remembered them.  The humidity shot up and we were sweating like crazy, couldn’t drink enough water. It took us almost 4 hours to hike less than 4 miles, and those miles don’t even count!


We got to the Hut and took a long break and then REALLY began the hike. The half mile to the top of Madison was challenging but beautiful. We had gorgeous 360 views and the wind kept things fairly cool.  The next 2.5 miles were all down and a completely different story. I don’t know if I used up all the gas in my tank on the way up, but I started making a lot of mistakes.  I tweaked my left knee, hyperextended my left elbow and then fell on the same elbow about an hour later. Matter of fact, I fell down 4 times today which never happened last year.


Our original plan was to hike and additional 2.5 miles to a stealth site but it was 330pm when we got to Osgood Tentsite, so we decided after 8 plus hours of hiking and not even 7 miles hiked to just go with it and call it a day.  I’m hoping tomorrow is better, although it’s supposed to thunderstorm all day and the dreaded Wildcats are looming. Depending on how I feel we might have to shift to a plan B!","Madison Spring Hut

Flex and Curly,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618171,"5 miles from Osgood Tent Site to Pinkham Notch Visitor Center


So the short story version is that Curly and I have decided to cut short our section hike for this year.  If you want the long version, read on...


We woke up to intermittent rain and sore muscles.  Already several miles behind schedule due to yesterday’s misadventures.  With a very sore right elbow and a bun left knee, we set out at 7am for the five mile hike to Pinkham Notch. Fortunately, the rain stayed away and the trail was much more favorable for hiking. Unfortunately, I (Flex) can’t go down on that left leg without severe pain. We continued on through the morning, enjoying the incredible beauty of the White Mountains.


It took us almost 4 hours on easy terrain to hike 5 miles, we both knew it would’ve safest and most enjoyable to suspend the hike for this time and go home and see the doctor.


Couple of lessons learned on this outing.  First, one year away from the trail and on year older is very humbling.  As much as I love this trail and want to complete it,  Curly and I need to do it in very small pieces over a longer period of time. I want to knock it out but that just ain’t going to happen.  The other lesson about being a year older is that the body really and truly is aging. I hate to admit that I can’t do what I used to do cause my body won’t cooperate!


In the end, we didn’t get the miles we hoped to, but still had a great time!","Osgood Tent Site
