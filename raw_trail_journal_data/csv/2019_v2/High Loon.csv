High Loon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616113,"I got another early start today, after a delicious breakfast of cold leftover pizza.  I walked through the streets of Duncannon then crossed both the Juniata and Susquehanna Rivers.  These rivers are awesome.  Pennsylvania sure is a beautiful place.
It makes sense that after a river crossing the trail would head uphill, and that's exactly what happened.  But Peter's Mountain is an elongated mountain that is not terribly high.  So the climb up was modest, and once you reach the ridge you stay there for miles and miles.  There are many gorgeous views from overlooks on both the north and south sides of the mountain.  There are lots of side trails crossing the AT, and why not?  It's a fine place for a hike.
I leapfrogged Okie and Raider quite a few times today, wished Tripod well as he jetted off ahead, and am now camped solo at a most congenial spot at mm 1163.7.  All is well.","Duncannon, PA

But that memory isn't accurate.  I think that in 2014 my feet were so banged up by the time I reached this section that I wasn't successful at enjoying it because I was in pain all the time.  I've spoken with a few NOBO thru-hikers during the last few days, and almost all of them are cranky and out of sorts.  The other hikers I've met are having a blast.  I think that banged-up feet thing might be the difference.
The mud was a bit tedious today, to be sure, and the rocks did hurt even my non-banged-up feet a bit, but you know what?  This is a really great stretch of trail.  Pennsylvania is flat out gorgeous!  I have never, ever, seen so many ferns!! They go on and on and on, seemingly forever.  And the blooming mountain laurel is just out of this world.  I'm a big fan of this place, rocks, mud and all.
It really makes a difference, not being in constant pain.  I'm so glad I got to come back and hike this stretch of trail again.  It's more fun this time.  Thru-hiking is a great thing -- but so is section hiking.","Pine Grove, PA

So then I headed back to the trail in Port Clinton via the same route I took into Hamburg yesterday -- the Schuylkill River Trail.  This is a gem of a multi-use rail-to-trail.  For fans of the board game Monopoly (and who isn't??), the actual Pennsylvania Railroad once ran along here.  And the Reading Railroad ran nearby.  Wish I could time travel for a day back to the heyday of those railroads.  
As for today's hike, I walked past Pulpit Rock, the Pinnacle and Dan's Pulpit, all of which afforded magnificent views of the farm valleys below.  Then I crossed paths with a six foot rattlesnake -- not a monster but certainly big enough to get your undivided attention.  I met three other hikers whom I hope to get to know in the coming days -- Wing It, Sweetwater and The Colonel.  I spent an hour or so walking with Wing It -- a 20-year-old engineering student at Mizzou.  Really nice guy.  It was a good day.","Hamburg, via Port Clinton

Without rain, there would have been great views from multiple spots, but it was socked in so I only took one picture all day, at Knife's Edge.  As the name implies, this is a cool and fairly dangerous spot consisting of an elongated boulder field where you painstakingly make your way over, around and through the rocks.  It would be a lousy place to lose your footing.
I ran into Okie and Raider, whom I hadn't seen since soon after leaving Duncannon.  It was good to see them again.  I met Hiker Greg, and spent a good hour talking with him at a water stop.  I hope to see him again.  I'm camped solo at a spot which turns out to be directly under the approach path of a nearby airport.  Didn't see that coming!  But at the moment the rain has stopped, the birds are singing, and the sky has brightened a bit.  So, all is well.","Campsite mm 1238.6

I noticed the rain had stopped, so back to the trail I went.  But before I made it halfway back, the rain returned.  I walked the rest of the day in a steady rain.  Then I set up my tent in the rain.  It's stopped again, but the forecast calls for two more days of rain.
Crash Davis was right:  Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, and sometimes it rains.  I saw two turtles -- not terrapins, but turtles -- right on the trail today.  Ain't no way that's gonna happen on a sunny day.

I deposited my pack and poles and headed to the Gap Diner for lunch.  That place is an oasis.  I ordered fajitas which came with soup, a salad, and pudding.  Pudding?  Brilliant!!  I think every meal should come with pudding.
It didn't rain as much as in the past several days, and once I got back to the motel I was able to get my gear dried out, my laundry done, and my body clean.  All of which represents a colossal improvement over the recent past.  Plus, there was pudding!  I'm now watching baseball on television.  Aaahhh.","Campsite mm 1270.4

Last night I decided that I would flip back to Carlisle and head SOBO to Bland, VA.  After my 2014 thru hike I have strung together section hikes from Springer Mountain to Bland.  So hiking from Carlisle to Bland will tidy things up a bit, toward the eventual goal of completing the trail for a second time.
Joyce of Carlin's Shuttles in Pine Grove shuttled me from Delaware Water Gap back to Carlisle in time to catch the last several innings of Michigan's second victory over Texas Tech in the College World Series.  Michigan now advances to the finals, so next week I'll have to manage my time well in order to catch some more college baseball on television.  Go Blue!

Today's trail also went directly through the picturesque town of Boiling Springs, which has a gorgeous duck pond and a rich iron works history.  There's a blast furnace there which dates back to 1762.  How cool is that?
Near the end of today's hike I stopped off at the Green Mountain General Store for a burger and fries.  This place is great, and it's very close to the trail.  Now I'm camped right next to Tagg Run, a beautiful little gurgling brook.  Today was wonderful.","Carlisle, PA

Indeed, I would have stayed longer but I am committed to making it to Waynesboro, PA by tomorrow evening in order to watch a baseball game on television.  So I needed to keep moving.  Well, after a delicious burger and fries at the Pine Grove Furnace General Store, of course.
Today's section of trail was pleasant and congenial.  It's beginning to get progressively hilly again, after a long flat stretch through the Cumberland Valley.  But the hills are still modest and so the huffing and puffing were not too bad.  Today was another bluebird day, spectacular weather for hiking.  And so, it is good.","James Fry Shelter

But within a couple of hours it was over 90°, and I was really wilting.  I staggered on all afternoon, making remarkably little progress.  Maryland is a great place to take a hike, but perhaps not so much on this day.  Finally I called it a day at 6:30 pm, having hiked only 12.4 miles.  It was a fairly miserable day,  by any measure.
So it figures that on such a day my Wolverines would lose the national championship in college baseball to Vanderbilt.  Congratulations to Vandy.  The better team won.  But I'm proud of Michigan.  They showed up and played their best.  You did good, guys.  Damn good.","Waynesboro, PA

The afternoon was again sweltering and my pace dropped to agonizingly slow.  I aimed for the Crampton Gap Shelter, but I stopped 1.3 miles short when I was overtaken by a thunderstorm.  I quickly pitched my tent and called it a day.  The storm was loud and dumped a bunch of rain, but it moved out in due course and it's now a fine evening.  I'm in my tent listening to the delightfully happy songbirds nearby tempered by the distant drone of traffic and several incessantly barking dogs.  And so, it is good.","Ensign Cowall Shelter

The morning started with a pleasant ridge walk to Weverton Cliffs, a wonderful spot with great views overlooking the Potomac River.  Then there was a fairly steep descent down to the river, where the trail joined the old C & O Canal Towpath for what is essentially a three mile roadwalk into Harpers Ferry.  Much of that distance has little shade, and it was quite the scorcher today.
I had no plan to stop in Harpers Ferry, but the heat along the towpath had sapped my strength so I opted for lunch at the Coach House Bar and Grill.  It was terrific.  It just kept getting hotter and hotter, though, so from there I succumbed to the temptation to bail into a motel.  I'm not at all happy with my sudden inability to hike a full day, but the air conditioning sure did feel fantastic!  I took a wonderfully cool shower then napped away the afternoon.

Once it climbed up out of Harpers Ferry -- which was definitely a respectable climb -- today's trail was a mostly congenial ridge walk with occasional views on both sides.  That all changed, however, when I got to the so-called ""Roller Coaster"" -- a sophomorically designed series of needless ups and downs which apparently satisfies someone's sense of machismo.  In my judgment, this is bush league stuff and does not belong on a renowned national treasure like the AT.
At Snickers Gap I briefly diverted into a lovely little blues joint for a cheeseburger and onion rings.  They were outstanding.  I'm now camped a bit south of Snickers Gap, with the only negative being the significant amount of traffic noise emanating up from VA 7.  I really can't blame all these people for wanting to live 'round here; however, I am looking forward to being farther away from the DC area.","Harpers Ferry, WV.

Shenandoah NP is a bit of an incongruous place to be on a long distance hike.  There are frequently services available along the trail such as little diners called waysides, fancier restaurants, and camp stores -- but none of them are designed with hikers in mind.  They exist for motoring tourists.  They are here because Skyline Drive is here.
Some have, from a hiker's perspective, odd operating hours.  I stopped by Elkwallow Wayside at just after 7:00 this morning hoping for breakfast, but it did not open until 9:00 am.  Then I stopped by Skyland Resort at just after 4:00 pm hoping for dinner, but the dining room did not open until 5:30.  There was, however, an operating snack bar where I bought a pre-fab sandwich and a Pepsi. 
I am grateful that these services exist so close to the trail here, but I am really hoping that my timing works out a bit better the rest of the way.  There are over 100 miles of the AT in Shenandoah NP, so it's still a long way until my next stop in a town.","Campsite SOBO mm 1238.9

High Loon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620764,"Today was obviously a national-holiday-weekend kind of day here in Shenandoah NP.  Countless, countless Harley-Davidson motorcycles were cruising on Skyline Drive, every day-hiker was accompanied by at least one high-end dog, and I had to eat Spam for dinner.
I was already aware that Skyline Drive parallels the AT for the entire length of Shenandoah NP.  (Indeed, the trail was shoved aside to make way for the road.)  But there's something about the presence of hundreds and hundreds of Harleys that brings home just how close the road really is to the trail.  It's waaayyy close!
I confess I'm really not sure what it is about a national holiday weekend that irresistibly screams out to folks:  ""Let's all take our fashionable pooches for a stroll on the Appalachian National Scenic Trail"", but the phenomenon exists.  And -- so long as they stay out of my drinking water sources and don't crap on the trail too much -- I say let it be.  Just another curiosity about our culture that makes me smile and shake my head.
As for the Spam, well, the hordes of national park visitors on this national holiday weekend ate up everything else.  I arrived at the camp store to find the cupboard almost bare, stripped of anything resembling decent, nutritious food.  So I bought some Spam, and then I ate it.  First time for everything, you know.  Last time for that, I assure you!","Campsite SOBO mm 1296.2

High Loon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620843,"Today was a fairly short day out of Shenandoah NP and into Waynesboro, VA.  Front Royal was awhile ago, so I've really been looking forward to getting back into a town.  I sensed that my personal hygiene could, perhaps, stand a bit of a touch-up.  Plus, every hiker -- me included -- is crazy about Ming Garden, perhaps the world's finest AYCE Chinese buffet.
Therefore I did my best to hustle down to Rockfish Gap.  Once there, I called trail angel Mr. Gizmo, who arrived very shortly thereafter to ferry me to a motel.  I have to hand it to Waynesboro -- it really does have the best trail angel network anywhere.  My hat is off to these wonderful people.  Nice work, folks!
I cleaned up in lightning fashion then made a beeline for Ming Garden.  All memories of that agonizing Spam dinner quickly vaporized.  This place is a shrimp lover's paradise!  If there is a better Chinese buffet somewhere, I'd sure love to go there. 
So, that will end this phase of this hike.  Nancy -- yep, that Nancy -- will arrive tomorrow to lasso me and return me to the Hike Inn.  Where, I have absolutely zero doubt, I will again become extremely well acquainted with my paint brush!  I'll be back on trail just as soon as I can think up something.  Until then, as always, when you're in Fontana Dam please stop in and say hi to Nancy and me.","Campsite SOBO mm 1315.5

High Loon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620848,"Aaahhh.  Nancy -- yep, that Nancy -- granted me a temporary reprieve from my paintbrush so I'm back at it, now heading NOBO from Bland, VA to Waynesboro, VA.  If I make it to Waynesboro, I will have completed section hikes of the AT from Springer Mountain to Delaware Water Gap, in addition to my 2014 thru-hike.
This morning Nancy ferried me to the Brushy Mountain Outpost, where I ended my NOBO section hike last August.  I struggled uphill for a good bit, but mercifully the trail leveled off and I was treated to a relatively flat ridge walk for the rest of the day.  I have such respect for section hikers -- always having to redevelop their trail legs every time out.  It's a very tough thing to do.
I'm camped at a wonderful spot along the ridge.  There's a threat of storms, but it's otherwise just about perfect out here.  Life, far far away from my paintbrush, sure is good.","Bland, VA

High Loon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620850,"I was awakened last night by some seriously high winds, followed by a bit of ridiculously loud lightning and thunder.  Fortunately, it all blew through very quickly, and there was no rain.  I felt pretty vulnerable up on the ridge, but I really like ridge top camping this time of year. 
After seeing absolutely zero other hikers yesterday, it was very nice to run into several today.  I met a couple of guys, and then a solo trail runner, who were doing a loop near Dismal Falls.  Then, when I stopped to get water at Doc's Knob Shelter, I met NOBO hiker Jaws.  He started at Amicalola Falls SP in June.  He's going to continue hiking north until he's overtaken by cold weather.  We had a two-hour conversation, and I sure hope to see him again soon.
I'm again camped up on the ridge, and tonight there is no threat of bad weather.  In fact, it's just about perfect outside.  I'm bushed and I'm gonna sleep well.","Campsite mm 607.8

High Loon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620941,"Ugh.  Today was tough.  I left Pearisburg carrying five days of food -- enough to make it to Daleville, VA -- and three liters of water.  Oh, what a big heavy pack.  Ho, ho, ho!  And, naturally, there was a significant climb heading out of town and back upon the ridge.  Ah, well.  The ridge was long, hot and dry, so I am glad I brought that extra water.  And I'm now down to four days of food, so that issue will work itself out soon.
I saw no hikers today but I did see a cute little roly-poly bear cub.  As soon as it heard me it turned tail and scampered away deep into the woods as fast and clumsily as it could go.  No sign of momma or any siblings. 
Once again I'm camped high up on the ridge.  This run of pleasant weather has been so enjoyable.  Alas, the forecast for tomorrow calls for evening storms, so my string of ridge top campsites might have to come to an end.  But not before I get to see some meteors tonight!","Pearisburg, VA

High Loon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621142,"Today was a rainy day.  I got packed up in dry weather, but the rain started about a half hour later.  For awhile there was a lot of thunder and lightning, and then there was a good solid downpour.  It rained on and off all day, mostly on.  But, it was fairly cool, at least.
Because of the weather I stopped at three shelters, something I very rarely do.  I ducked into Pine Swamp Branch Shelter and Bailey Gap Shelter, and I'm now at War Spur Shelter for the night.  While at Bailey Gap Shelter I met SOBO Flip-Flopper Skinny Kid, and we had a good talk waiting for the rain to let up.  He passed 1500 miles yesterday.  Awesome!
All my gear stayed dry, which is wonderful, but I hiked all day with wet feet and I know there will be blisters coming.  This is one of the occupational hazards of section hiking -- your feet get citified and soft in between section hikes.  It just kinda goes with the territory.","Campsite mm 652.3

This is all part of the deal, I know.  I'm so fortunate to get to be out here doing this.  I'm not sure why I fought with the trail today.  But it happened. 
Once again I'm camped up on the ridge where it is waterless but otherwise oh so pleasant.  I'm about three miles trail south of Dragon's Tooth, the first of tomorrow's three outstanding geological features.  Gonna be one fine day, tomorrow is.","Campsite mm 684.6
