Firecracker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/521035,"This dream began over 40+ years ago. Instead of saying ""someday"" it looks like this will finally happen. It won't be a dream anymore. 2019 is still a ways away but there is a lot of planning to do. Preparing will take that long. Retirement will help provide funding and allow for multiple months of living on the trail. It feels weird that it will finally happen though. Have been saying ""someday"" for so long that it became always tomorrow or the next day. Just feels weird. To top it off my nephew has said he is willing to make the walk also. Wow. Wanting to spend up to 6 months with him will be a real treat. So now the waiting begins. Waiting to retire, waiting to accumulate the neeeded gear, waiting,waiting,waiting. To me this is the hardest part. One day at a time....","

Firecracker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/549124,Today marks estimate of 642 days until retirement date of 6/23/16. Can it get here any faster? With trail date estimate of March 2019 haven't even started those calculations yet. Have most of my gear already. Of the big 3 Tent and Sleeping Bag are certain and all set. Have purchased an inexpensive pack and will start testing this very soon. Hoping to start doing some basic shakedown hikes in late October. Maybe on Finger Lakes trail but will wait to see. So anxious to get this party started. The wait is maddening... Hoping the days continue to pass quickly... Pictures of equipment coming one of these days,"Georgia to Maine

Firecracker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/555270,"The elevation gain and loss of hiking the entire Appalachian Trail is the equivalent of climbing Mount Everest 16 times.   Lots of ups and downs.       Twenty percent of thru hikers will drop out in the first thirty miles. Damn I hope one of them WILL NOT be me. It is approx 2180 miles longSouthern terminus is at Springer Mtn, GA where I mostly likely be starting fromNorthern Terminus is at Katahdin in Baxter State Park, ME where I hope to finishG The trail travels through 14 states, 6 National Parks and 8 National ForestsTraditions on the AT:  Carry a stone from Start to finish.
