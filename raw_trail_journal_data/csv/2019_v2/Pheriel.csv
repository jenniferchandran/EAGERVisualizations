Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606151,"2018 was meant to be a flip flop thru hike that started in Daleville, VA.  A few injuries from a variety of falls (20 falls to be exact!) took me off trail a couple times with fall #19 south of Manchester, VT essentially ending my season.  I did another 9 miles closer to home a few weeks later but the previous injuries proved too much.  So now instead of being a thru hiker I've graciously accepted the title of section hiker for 2019. The goal now will be to get back into pre-trail shape with 3.5 months to go until my start date.  Be safe.

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606152,"With all my equipment from 2018 still mostly intact I took an inventory and decided to visit REI for a couple adjustments.  I've been using the REI Flash as my air mattress and really liked it.....when it stayed inflated.  Hopefully I'm not going to be living the definition of insanity but I utilized REI's great return policy and swapped it out for another REI Flash.  I'll be inflating and testing it out in the basement for a few nights just to be sure the integrity is there.  From experience I can tell you my carpeted floor is much softer than the floor of a shelter.  The other replacement was my silk sleeping bag liner.  Too many wash/dry cycles on high heat made it a bit brittle resulting in a small rip that grew over time.  So the equipment is ready but the body is not.  The treadmill and elliptical will be my ""friends"" moving forward along with some day hikes and a few over-night excursions.  I'm blessed to live in western North Carolina where the trails are plentiful.  Be safe.

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606153,"Wet roots, wet rocks and mud, oh my!  These were the main culprits during the 2018 season that led to my sudden horizontal trail experiences.  I've giving a bunch of thought to how I reduce the falls in 2019 and the main thing I came up with...slow down!  I'm retired so time is on my side, I'm now a section hiker so I'm not looking to set any land speed records and with my 2018 experiences hopefully I'm wiser.  Hopefully.  Going NOBO out of the Hot Springs, NC area in mid-April translates into most of the snowfall being behind me so I'll be able to better see where I'm stepping. Like 2018 I'll also be going shorter miles the first couple weeks until the trail legs are earned so maybe I'll be a little less tired at days end.  I know falls are a part of the experience but I'm hoping to have a little less of that particular kind of experience in 2019.  Time will tell.  Be safe.

Treadmills, ellipticals and various local day hikes will do as preparations for now. We have an abundance of trails to hike in western NC and I’ve planned some extended weekend hikes as I get closer to my “due” date. The various injuries that took me off the trail last year after 900 miles are either completely or nearly healed. As a section hiker this year I’m looking forward to a different approach to my trail strategy as there’s now not the intensity to complete the trail in a season.

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611112,"This was was my shakedown hike prior to the start of the 2019 season that took place about 3 weeks ago. I was fortunate to have my friend, Train Wreck, with me again this year. The shuttle let us off and we headed south. Immediately I felt like a salmon swimming up stream as we encountered about 15 NOBOs in the first 45 minutes! But our weather was great and the hiking superb so we pushed on with a hello and what’s your trail name from the rest of the hikers we met. Our first night we camped in the large clearings around Shelton Graves. It was a perfect night with no visits from unwanted apparitions and we woke to an incredible orange and yellow sunrise. We weren’t sure how far we’d get on this second day but we were feeling pretty good. We continued to meet an interesting mix of NOBOs trekking north towards Katahdin. There was one that stood out. As the young man was approaching we could see something strange strapped to the back of his pack. It was an inflatable doll!  Didn’t want to really ask many questions as I tried to shutdown my imagination. My guess it was mostly for shock factor. Hopefully. As we continued to click off miles we determined the end of the day would put us 16 miles down trail and near Hemlock Hollow Hostel so we called for a reservation and a 6pm pickup. The place and people working there were awesome and I highly recommend this place. After a great night of clean sleep we were back on trail the next morning with 14 miles of trail until Hot Springs. Another near perfect day with many thru/day hiker encounters and we rolled into town by about 4pm. Took showers at Laughing Heart Hostel and were soon heading back to Hickory.Today, my beautiful and understanding wife is driving me to Bland, VA where I’ll start hiking north to Daleville which is where I started my Flip-Flop attempt last year. Now as a Lasher(long ass section hiker) I’ll be leap frogging up and down the trail to complete my unfinished sections. Without sounding antisocial I picked Bland in an attempt to get ahead of the mass of hikers I met a few weeks ago. After Daleville I’ll head back to Sam’s Gap where I’ll hopefully be behind the hiker bubble. Be safe.","Devil’s Fork Gap

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611167,"We left Hickory this morning heading for my true 2019 restart and got to Bland about 10am. After taking some time for a few pictures and to say goodbye to Susan I was heading northbound. As with last year my plan was to only go 8-10 miles a day for the first 10 days or so but with the way the shelters were situated I ended up doing 12 miles. Bubba is feeling it with my feet and legs yelling at me! Can’t really blame them. The terrain wasn’t too bad with only a couple 1200’ climbs but the sore feet is about the distance. All that’s after the fact because the rest of the day was perfect. Not a cloud in the sky, a light cool breeze blowing out of the northwest and a temperature about 70 degrees. A perfect 10! I saw a limited number of other hikers until I got to the shelter then they started filing in. Probably 12 in all and mostly young guns doing large miles. One twenty-something did a 34 mile day in roughly the time it took me to do a 12. Impressive....show off! Jealous as I am of having the ability to hike that far in a day I’d have to say my spirit is willing but my body is weak!
It was mostly ridge hiking which means plenty of sunshine because of no tree canopy and cool breezes. I did see a large deer today that was momentarily startled but quickly stopped. I had a great view of this amazing creature that makes going up and down these hills look effortless. A simply beautiful animal. The sun has now gone below the western ridge and the temperature is cooling quickly. As I’m writing this I hear a turkey in the valley below calling out for his “harem”. I also hear the young human “turkeys” sitting around their tents telling embellished tales about the days events. It’s a coed group so I guess it’s to be expected. Anyway, the sun is fading and hiker midnight is approaching so the camp will soon be silent except for the mice scurrying around the shelter. As long as one doesn’t run across my face....This is truly a beautiful place in the creation. Got to say that God did good in this neck of the woods.
Last thing. Thank you Susan for letting me do this two years in a row. I love you more than you can know. Everybody sleep well and be safe.","US 52 North of Bland,VA

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611397,"Last night the group of young guns were true to hiker midnight and were quickly quiet as last light faded behind the ridge to our west. I got a later start this morning with the intention of doing 8-10 miles then stealth camp somewhere near a water source. As the day went along there was a variety of terrain along higher elevation ridge lines where the hardwoods are just starting to sprout green buds then descending to a gap bringing a mix of blue, yellow and white wildflowers complemented by wild dogwoods in full bloom. Later in the day the famed green rhododendron tunnels of Virginia were prevalent adding shade and cooler temps. The trail through this section was paralleling Dismal Creek so the ground was intermittently wet and muddy requiring me to do the AT shuffle from one side of the trail to the other to keep my shoes dry. Never was a good dancer. Emerging from the tunnels and for about 3 miles was a flat pine forest of trees standing 40-50’ high. Likely second or third generation trees but they also provided shade. The trail had a slight elevation as it was heading up the narrow valley toward the base of a high ridge and the Dismal Creek headwaters. Again, quite a variety of terrain.
For me, the ego was again speaking louder than the wisdom gained from last years hike so my day ended at 15 miles. My dogs are barking loud this evening. At the shelter tonight is a woman named Pushing 60 and Jolly Rancher who are sleeping in their tents with Six Wheel and me in the shelter. A little older group so we had some good conversation and were also a little quieter than the younglings the night before. As the sun has set its a little darker now and we can already hear our vermin shelter mates running around and planning their nightly attack. Hoping for a great night of sleep but that’s really in their grubby little claws now.
It was a great day but I’m looking forward to tomorrow which will be only about 8 miles as I’ll be staying at Woods Hole Hostel. This one came to me as a “must do” recommendations from a couple of my thru hiker friends from last year. Looking forward to the shorter day with the extra rest for my aching body. Did I mention that the Wapiti Shelter was the the site of a double murder in 1981? Be safe.","Jenny Knob Shelter

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611596,"Until about 11pm a mouse was in full frontal attack mode on my backpack which was hanging from a nail sticking out of a log beam. I finally had enough and got out of my sleeping bag to put the pack on the picnic table. The mouse won the battle but I won the war...at least at this shelter. It was finally peacefulish except Six Wheel was gently sawing some logs but I was still able to nod off for the night.
It was another beautiful clear, calm and cool day as each of us left out after breakfast at various times. Knowing I was only going 8 miles I took my time ascending out of the Dismal Creek valley. After the climb out I was back on a ridge making good time when I heard footsteps behind me. It was the first of the young guns who had already done 7 miles of hiking that morning. The rest of his tramily was close behind so I found a comfortable rock(sort of), pulled out a Snickers bar and took a break as the parade passed me by. It wasn’t long as they followed the trail around a curve and disappeared. Impressive. I soon followed but never saw the 7 of them again. The last 1.5 miles was over rocky terrain which is not exactly my favorite. It slowed me down some but...I didn’t fall! This makes 73 miles this year without a fall which I believe is a new personal best for me! Bet I just jinxed it...
By about 2pm I was walking over a creek and into the entrance of Woods Hole. I was greeted with the welcoming bark of their two dogs sounding the alarm. On the right was a gorgeous old 1880’s log cabin, in front of me was a log cabin bunk house and down to my left was a small barn with one of those forever views across a lush field with cows, goats and pigs behind it. Looking across the field were distant green hills that disappeared into the horizon. The smell of smoke from burning logs was strong in the air. I knew then why this place had been recommended to me. It was absolutely beautiful! The inside was warm, cozy and invitingly decorated with period furniture pieces that had to make everyone who enter feel at home.
It was a relaxing afternoon and evening of making new friends (Sweet D, D Terminator and Choo-Choi) while sitting in the porch rocking chairs or porch swing talking about hiking and family while snacking on fresh baked bread and homemade cheddar cheese. Between the experience, accommodations, the food and the people who work there this place was a near perfect 10! Think I’ll get some good sleep tonight! Be safe.","Wapiti Shelter

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611712,"With bad weather coming tomorrow I decided to head to Angel’s Rest Hostel today then take a zero tomorrow.The new friends I made at the hostel offered to slack pack me to Pearisburg since they were also staying at Angel’s Rest and I gladly accepted. Instead of carrying a 28 pound pack it was now going be about 6 pounds. After an incredible breakfast I was on my way at 9am. There was a gradual ascent getting back to the ridge but then it flattened out and the miles started clicking by. There wasn’t anything remarkable about the hike(other than being able to slack pack) until I stopped for lunch at Pearis Ledges. The Legdes look out to the east and are about 1100’ above the New River Valley floor. It was a cloudless day with a steady, cool breeze and as I sat there I felt like I had the valley all to myself. The colors in front of me were incredible with the dark, emerald greens of new crops that were growing at the bottom of the valley. Ascending the valley walls were the pink and whites of various trees that had blossomed out followed by the pastel, variegated greens of new leaves budding from their hardwood hosts. The ridges were still brown as the trees at the top were just experiencing spring as their branches blended into the blue sky Their opportunity for color would be here in the coming days. A masterpiece that could only we painted by our Creator! It was a peaceful feeling and even my tuna burrito with a tube of Arby’s Horesy Sauce on it tasted better than usual(just kidding).
After about 45 minutes I had to move on and after a long, steep descent into Pearisburg I got to the hostel about 3:30. unpacked, showered, put clothes in the washer and went for a resupply. When dinner rolled around Sweet D, D Terminator, Choo-Choo and I went to an Italian restaurant for dinner. Only one of us ordered Italian with the other three getting a....cheeseburger and fries! So it’s not just me!
Hoping for a good night of rest and a relaxing day tomorrow. Be safe.","Woods Hole Hostel

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611827,"The bad weather came in as expected with periods of sideways rain and strong, gusting winds. There are some that will call me a weenie but I’d rather be in a hostel or hotel when there’s rough weather than a tent or shelter. Guess I’m not the only one because the hostel and the all the hotels in town were full of hikers. So it’s a day of rest and relaxation, reorganizing your pack, washing clothes and resupplying when you can. The other hikers in my part of the hostel where Sweet D, D Terminator, Choo-Choo, First Light and Pushing 60 who I’d met the second night on the trail.  It was a good group which made for a fun and enjoyable experience. The highlight was the amazing breakfast of egg casserole and blueberry pancakes that D Terminator led the charge on making for the group. She and her husband(Sweet D) are giving people with big hearts. It’s been a pleasure spending the last several days with them and their friend, Choo-Choo.
Tomorrow it’s back to the trail. With my free time I’ve scoped out a plan that with reasonable days of 10-11 miles should  get me to Daleville by next Saturday. The weathers suppose to be warm and rain free through Wednesday so that will help. Be safe.","Angel’s Rest Hostel

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611830,"It was a cool morning with the wind still blowing hard but the sun was out and we were all ready to hit the trail. Sweet D swung by Hardees so I could pick up a couple sausage biscuits(hard to find them up on the trail) then shuttled First Light and I to our drop off. I said goodbye to my new friends hoping that we’d see each other up the trail. I also said goodbye to First Light because although  she’s only 4’ 11” tall she’s been clocking 15-20 mile days. It didn’t take long and she was out of sight! It was a steep descent into the New River Valley a couple days before but the climb out today was more gradual. A fully loaded pack with 4 days of food still made for sweaty, 1900’ climb back to the top of today’s ridge. Near the bottom of the climb we passed an old chemical production plant that’s still in operation. Further up we past the company’s  landfill which according to my notes was a Superfund site. Explains why the recommendations near there is “Don’t drink this water”. Green is a good color for leaves but not for me! 
During the course of the day many thru hikers with earned trail legs past by and I caught others at resting spots on a rock or at watering holes. The water sources are always important but on today’s hike there was an 11 mile section with no water so at the last spot everyone was loading up. For those of us not seeing another source until the tomorrow it meant carrying enough to get through until mid-morning tomorrow. I ended up with almost 9 pounds of water to carry! As the day went on the ground became rockier and I was thankful that the strong winds had dried the rocks. After last years experience with wet rocks I’m still having flashbacks! Had lunch sitting on a log with Fancy Pants. He and I ended up hiking together the rest of the afternoon but when we got to about 11 miles out I knew it was time to stop. The only problem was there were no camping sites due to the terrain and an abundance of rocks. At about 13-14 miles I found a spot but Fancy Pants hiked on. As I sat there at the camp resting a strong gust of wind blew and I heard a loud creaking sound. Looking up there was a large deadfall tree that was leaning against another tree directly above where my tent would have to be pitched. On the trail we call these Widow Makers! So I reluctantly got up and hiked on. Finally, at Dickinson Gap there was space for 4-5 tents and that was home for the night after 15 miles.
With my combined 2018 and 2019 mileage today I hit a big milestone..1000 miles!! Still not halfway but thankful to be out here pursuing the dream! Thanks to my family and friends for your prayers and support. Be safe.","Angel’s Rest Hostel

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611962,"After a “delicious” dinner of Knorr Butter flavored noodles(which I burned) I was in the tent by 7:15pm. The sleeping bag was cozy and warm as I worked on my past due trail journal. Didn’t get to sleep until after dark but woke up about 11:30pm with the sound of light rain hitting the tent. I have no idea how much it rained because that soothing sound put me right back to sleep. Slept well but woke up this morning feeling “off” physically. Yesterday had been my best day hiking since I’d come back on trail but this morning, even with just getting out of the tent it was different. After packing up and heading to the trail it didn’t matter if it was downhill, uphill or being on flat ground I felt like only 80%. Don’t know what it was but when I got to Pine Swamp Branch Shelter for lunch I stayed a hour to eat but mostly rest.
Shortly after lunch I got my first trail magic of the trip when a grandfather and two of his grandchildren offered me a cold cola(we were close to a parking lot). That seemed to give me a boost and a few minutes later I ran into Sweet D and Choo-Choo who were slack packing SOBO. Had a 10 minute conversation with them and hiked on then ran into D Terminator. We hiked a short distance together then I left her at a road crossing where Sweet D was picking her up. Running into them helped my psyche so I pushed on for my planned stop for the night about 4-5 miles away at Wind Rock. The key word here is planned! About a quarter mile later I tripped over one of those now all too familiar roots one had my first fall of the trip...and it was a good one!! The landing wasn’t graceful with my knee coming down hard on a rock and simultaneously my chest and chin smacking hard into a log laying on the side of the trail. My chin actually came down on a 4-5” broken branch sticking up from the log busting open the left side of my chin then sliding down and scraping my neck. After I collected myself and was wiping blood with my “do” rag another hiker came by and said it looked like it needed a stitch or two. I picked myself up and quickly hobbled back to the road to see if I could catch my friends. D Terminator is a nurse so I wanted her to evacuate it but they were already gone.
The only option with no cell reception was to stick out the thumb and start the long limp back to Pearisburg (about 20 miles) and to the hostel where I knew they were staying. By the absolute grace of God the third vehicle picked me up. And get this, he lived about a half mile from the hostel!! Luck? I don’t think so.
To make a longer story shorter D Terminator said no stitches, she cleaned it up, gave me ibuprofen for the pain(chin, chest, scrapes and knee) then some ice for the knee. Can’t say enough about the kindness that she, her husband and their friend have in their hearts. Three very generous and giving people.
So I’m back at Angel’s Rest Hostel to recuperate and I’ll take a zero tomorrow. The trail isn’t going anywhere so it’ll be there when my knee says it’s ready to go...hopefully by Tuesday. My life lessons from this experience are: (1)if you’re going to fall it’s best to not land on your face and (2) ain’t God good!! Be safer than me.","Dickinson Gap

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611964,"I decided to go out with my friends today and zero in the woods while they hiked. But as long as I was by the trail it was a great opportunity to do a little trail magic. I borrowed a cooler from the hostel and we went by Wally World on the way out of town this morning to pick up some drinks and snacks. So as they disappeared into the woods I set up shop out of the back of their SUV. Business was a little slow so it gave me some time to walk up and down the gravel road to evaluate my knee. My conclusion is that  at this point I’m on injured reserved. 
There weren’t many hikers but those that did come by were grateful. When you’re hiking through the middle of no where, you’re tired, hot and sweaty then you come up on cold drinks, junkie snacks and fresh fruit, it’ll put a dang smile on your face! So mission accomplished!! When we were done the remainder of the snacks went back to the hostel where they were consumed by the hikers staying there. We’re a hungry bunch!
According to Sweet D there’s an ancient AT rule established at the dawn of hiking that says for every hour of trail magic you do you get credited an actual trail mile to apply where needed. It’s questionable but then, to quote Forrest Gump, I don’t know about that...","Angel’s Rest Hostel

So Susan will pick me up tomorrow and I’ll be back in Hickory tomorrow night. As with last year it’s not what I expected or want but I also don’t heal like I used to.

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614735,"Left Hickory and made it to Four Pines Hostel about noon. At about 2pm the shuttle driver got me back to the crossing at VA635 where I came off trail after my fall and injury from a few weeks back. This time I picked up my feet when I got to the fall spot and missed the root that took me down. With a little PTFD (post traumatic fall disorder) I was able to pass the spot and cross the creek to start an uphill climb. After 3 weeks of resting and little activity the 1600’ climb up the hill was a butt kicker. Whatever beginnings of trail legs I had previously gained was long gone. Along the climb a white oak tree had fallen across the trail and a section had been cut out so hikers could pass through. I could see a bunch of tree rings so took a breath break and counted...180 rings!!! That means the acorn became an oak tree in about 1840. So this tree was able to dodge the loggers that cleared these hills about 90 years ago which is amazing! Through this section the trail also had about 1.5 miles of rocks to hike over giving me flashbacks of last year going through Pennsylvania only this time I stayed vertical! Made it to Wind Rock which had beautiful views of the valley to the west in the afternoon sun. The trail made its way into Mountain Lake Wilderness giving me a real feeling of being remote and alone because it is and I was! Got to my camp spot about 6:15pm after a short 7 miles and went through my routine. Was in my tent 2 hours later and faded off. About 9:45pm I don’t know if it was the flash or the thunder but I was suddenly wide awake. Hard to believe that something as fragile as a tent could make me feel secure but it did even though a large branch from any overhanging tree could break off crush me making me coyote fodder. Interesting what can make us feel safe and secure. It was an isolated storm so was short lived but the rain and the leaf drip mesmerized me back to sleepiness. It was a good, uneventful (meaning I didn’t fall) first day back and I’m looking forward to tomorrow’s hike. Be safe.","VA 635-Stony Creek Road

Pheriel,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614954,"The first of these days followed a night of sleep that came in fits and starts. But the wind blew keeping it cool and I awoke with the sounds of the forest greeting the new day. It was a clear, blue sky day and as I was quietly eating my breakfast a doe wandered within 15 yards of me also quietly eating breakfast. Being in a designated wilderness area it seems the fear of humans wasn’t part of her psyche.  Beautiful creature!! I broke camp and started on my 10-12 mile day. The terrain was a slew of little up and downs but not too bad expect the 1700’ climb to Kelly Knob. It was a hotter day and by the time it was over I’d completed 13 miles. I was a bit gamey so spent a little more time getting the grime off me at the creek before I got in my sleeping bag. Fixed dinner and was in the tent by 7:15pm. Bubba and his dogs were tired and ready for a deep sleep. Proverbs says the sleep of a laborer is sweet and I believe that applies to hikers going up and down hills all day in the hot sun. The white noise sound of the creek 25 yards away should help ease me into dreamland.
The combination of being tire, a cool breeze and the creek sound worked together giving me a good night. But this morning the air was still and it felt heavy with humidity. Soon after leaving camp I passed by the Keefer Oak with a diameter of 18’ and estimated to be over 300 years old. I was in awe with its size and longevity and I laid my hands on it thanking God for the tree and creatures that have benefited from its existence through the centuries. This tree started life before we were even a country! Amazing!! Today’s hike took me out of the lowland and back to the ridges. There were several areas of slab rock which required scrambling of which I am definitely not a fan. Thankfully they were dry so the lichen wasn’t slippery and once again I was able to stay vertical. Had some great views overlooking beautiful valleys to the east and west. Near midday I came to a sign on a tree saying I was at the Eastern Continental Divide. I couldn’t help myself and left an equal distribution of my DNA on both the Atlantic and Gulf sides! It’s all downhill from there!! After lunch on the Atlantic side I pushed on and made it to my intended camp site at 4pm. Should have been satisfied with an 11.5 mile day but thought I had one more 1500’ climb left so up the trail I went. There wasn’t a water source on top so I had to camel up and was carrying over 8 pounds of water up the hill. The 2.8 mile hike took me 3 exhausting hours and I was dehydrated as I ended my 14.5 mile day. Tonight I’m camping next to the spur trail leading to the Audie Murphy Monument. I’ll pay my respects in the morning but for now it’s lights out. Hopefully I’ll sleep well tonight.

The location at the top of Brush Mountain is where the plane he was in crashed ending the life of one of the most decorated heroes of WWII. Over the years visitors have left trinkets and mementos to show their respects. With a US flag flying over the spot in a steady when it was quite moving.
The terrain as I started was mostly downhill for the first several miles ending at Trout Creek. And like any good watershed once you get to the water the next direction is up! So for the next 5 or so miles it was uphill. Virginia has what’s called the AT Triple Crown of peaks with the first one NOBO being Dragons Tooth which is where I was at the top of this mountain. It’s a rock formation that I guess someone along the way decided looked like a dragons tooth. I’m not sure anyone has ever seen a dragons tooth but let’s use our imagination! I rested at the top in the cool breeze thoroughly soaked from sweat. The trail down for the first 300 yards was a steep, rocky faced descent to the point that someone had installed metal rings for hand support in a couple sections. No hiking poles required just hands and feet. After creating the mountain to wind was not to be found and the further down the hill I went the more the temperature went up. Despite drinking what I thought was enough water by the time I got to the road at the bottom I was wasted. Tired, soaked, weak and a lack of appetite told me I needed to get some fluids. About a 10 minute road walk to the right was the hostel but to the left was a small store which is where I went. In about 20 minutes I sucked down 3 cans of V8 and 3 bottles of chocolate milk(both cravings). I believe I was a bit dehydrated. My car was at the hostel so after a brief rest there I decided to drive into Daleville and spend the night at a hotel. Feeling the way I did I didn’t want to hassle with cats, chickens and a room full of snorers at the hostel. My appetite was still elusive but my thirst was not. Along the way I drank two 36 ounces glasses of soda and after 5 hours And 140 ounces of fluid was able to use the bathroom. No doubt I was dehydrated.","Audie Murphy Monument
