Back for another section hike with Jenny “Turtle Stone” Kelly.  Her husband, Tim, drove us to Caledonia State Park in Pa. where we spent the night in their camping trailer before setting off today from Harpers Ferry, West Virginia.  After crossing The Potomac River the first  3.5 miles of trail followed the C&O bike path, so was very easy. After turning up into the mountains it was typical AT trekking.  The last hour before arriving at the shelter it rained HARD. It came up so fast we couldn’t get the rain gear on fast enough.  All was drenched. Shared the very nice Ed Garvey Shelter with  Jackie(Pivot) and her son Joey (Roo) from Michigan. Also with Smoosh and Squish from Maryland and 2 ladies from West Virginia. Had lots of fun with these folks. This first entry starts with total mileage from all of my past years section hikes including a 2.4 mile correction for changes in the years over the AT. Today’s actual mileage was 6","Harpers Ferry/ Potomac River

Avoided rain today but the trail was a rocky river mess.  We trekked through historical Gathland State Park. Stopped for the view at White Rock Cliffs. Most of the people from the previous night were with us again, plus Lobster, Sam, 2 girls (one with her dog Boone). Started raining hard again at 9pm and didn’t stop for for 17 hours.  More mud and minnie lakes.","Ed Garvey Shelter

Reluctantly started out in the heavy rains. Happy Mothers Day! My socks still weren’t dry from the first day, but didn’t really matter.  Got to slackpack for 3 miles starting at Washington Monument State Park where Tim picked up our packs and transported them to I70 for pick up.  What a nice 3 miles!  The rain stopped finally so we could set up our tents at Pogo Memorial Campsite. Nice change of pace from the shelters.  Rain is lightly falling again as I write this. Past camper’s midnight (8pm) going to sleep....I hope!","Rocky Run Shelter

Packed up tents and gear in the rain and got a bit of a late start. Luckily got to slackpack a few miles thanks to Tim. Rained all day creating some interesting hiking. Besides the mud and streaming water on most of the trail we hiked up a waterfall created by the weather and big rock terrain. Had to cross a raging creek scooting across a log with the help of Ginger and Mono, 2 trail angels that were put in our path today.  Little Antietam Creek was the next crossing and was not so little. We had to detour that one due to the danger.  It was uphill to our shelter and the rain finally stopped.","

Said our farewells to the couple from Maine that spent the night at the shelter with us and headed out on to less muddy trails. Travelled over a few areas of big rocks and made our way to High Rocks where we finally got to see a panoramic view.  We met up with Tim and Pete (who brought our RV to PA. yesterday). Shared a nice break with them, dropped our backpacks, and slackpacked the last 3 miles of the day. Three tenths of a mile past the park we crossed a RR track then the Mason-Dixon Line. We were done with the state of Maryland and now in Pennsylvania. Had some easy trail , some big rocks, beautiful forest, and a walk over a bridge on the Falls Creek.  The guys picked us up at PA 16 to spend the night in our RVs. It felt great to have a shower, dry out my gear and sleep in a real bed!","Raven Rock Shelter

Started back at PA16 and after changing our plan 3 times we ended up doing more miles, but all slackpack. Thanks to Tim for being so flexible and accomodating. We were fortunate to have great weather and easy trail for most of the day which is why we altered the plan. The only challenge was the 900’/ 1.3 mile climb up to Chimney Rocks. We stopped there for a bit and also enjoyed breaks at Deer Lick Shelters and Old Forge Picnic Area. Our final plan was to not stay in a shelter for the night but to come off the trail at Swamp Rd. where our sherpas, Tim and Pete, were waiting to drive us back to their campgrounds for the night.","PA 16

Saw more Lady Slipper flowers, this time with little white moths atop. Rained only 2 minutes....just because it’s the mountains.  Temps mild and perfect for hiking.  Ran into Pivotal at Caledonia and got caught up on the last few days apart.","Swamp Rd.

Crazy Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613832,"Eighth day of hiking for this section.  We got to slackpack AGAIN.  It was mostly easy trail with a few ups, but not bad.  We had heard so much about Pa. and all of the rocks so have been surprised so far about the easy paths. BUT we know that won’t last. Just when will it change? Stopped at Quarry Gap Shelter and it was sooo nice. Very well maintained and decorated with flowers etc. I’d recommend it for future hikers. Milesburn Cabin was another great spot to stop right on a creek, but no camping. We hiked through some interesting dark, pine forests and along side of a “mowed”area where heavy machinery had wiped out all but the larger trees. I’m guessing some sort of conservation project. Birch Run Shelter was also a nice stop with a creek.  Made great time today with easy paths and super weather.","Caledonia State Park

Crazy Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613939,"Started out early to avoid the afternoon heat, humidity, and potential thunderstorms. Pete and Tim hiked out the first .4 mile with me and Jenny to the 2019 AT Midpoint (1,096 miles), where we had a minnie celebration for this milestone! Jenny sang and blew bubbled and the guys took pics and videos.  It’s hard to believe I’ve hiked that many miles. 
Lots of mud around the Toms Run Shelter area and for most of the miles to the Pine Grove Furnace St. Park. We met our sherpas there to celebrate the midway point again with ice cream. After checking out the AT Museum we drove back to our campground.","Shippensburg Rd.

Crazy Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614031,"Skipped ahead a section today to have a shorter hike due to high heat and humidity. We’ll pick up the longer skipped section tomorrow when cooler. The AWOL guide made the day look easier than I experienced. We had several steep climbs. The 2 rock mazes though were not too lengthy or difficult. They were fun and interesting.  Stopped by Alec Kennedy Shelter and the monument at the original AT midpoint. Since the trail length occasionally  changes so does the midpoint. We took a suggested detour around a low, mucky area then hiked into farm fields where we somehow missed a turn. We bushwhacked to a RR track that we knew would eventually lead us back to the trail. We met the guys at the park with the old, iron furnace. We walked on past the the ATC Mid-Atlantic Regional Office then to a great lunch at Cafe101 before going back to our campground. Ran into Pivotal again in Boiling Springs.","Sheet Iron Roof Rd.

Crazy Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614126,"Hiked south today on this previously skipped section so we could end up at Pine Grove Furnace St. Park for a late lunch with our sherpas. It was a sunny cool day for a relatively easy hike. We really had not seen too many thru hikers since we started our section hike on May 10th, but today saw 18.  It helped that we were moving south as they were all hiking north.  We stopped at James Fry Shelter for a quick break,  but otherwise had an uneventful hike. We did speak with Mammoth, a thru hiker that had just finished his 1/2 gallon ice cream challenge at the Pine Grove General Store and also with Magician who was just starting his. It’s tradition for thru hikers to eat an entire 1/2 gallon of ice cream at this store to celebrate having hiked half of the AT.  Thank goodness I’m a section hiker... no brain freeze for me!","Sheet Iron Roof Rd.

Crazy Legs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614243,"A glorious last day on the AT for this 105 mile  section hike.  Saw some familiar faces in Boiling Springs before heading north.  Counting Pa 174 where we started and US 11 where we finished we crossed 10 roads in 8 miles.  We enjoyed the very easy hiking through mostly flat trail in woods and farmland.  Went up and over 2 stiles, crossed a few foot bridges, saw an old family cemetery, and crossed a RR track just after a train passed. We especially loved the “TRIP HAZARD AHEAD” sign along the trail. WOW! So glad we were warned. Wouldn’t want to trip on anything out there!","PA 174/ ATC Mid-Atlantic Regional Office
