Clingman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/597193,"Well, just got home from a 2 day visit to Mountain Crossings where I attended one of their hiker classes. Kudos to the entire staff of MC, Jason, Leigh, Bill and Jamie. The class started Friday night at 6:00 after the store closed for the day. The manager, Jason, led the very informative class, with great participation from the 8 attendees. Went until after 10 when we decided to call it a night. Slept in the hostel with a total of 14, a full house. A little warm last night but after all, it is summer. Any attendees with gear received a personal one on one pack shakedown the following morning. I highly recommend this for any new comers to the trail. A special thanks to Leigh who helped me. She has the AT and PCT under her belt with in CDT in her sights. All of the staff are accomplished thru hikers and have a wealth of knowledge as well as a complete store with anything a hiker could possibly need. Most AT thru hikers pass through MC at the beginning of a NOBO hike but since I'm flip flopping, I wanted to get their input up front, as I won't see them until the end of my hike next year.   Now, nothing left to do but practice, practice, practice.",,View Entry,"Jul 14, Sat",0
Clingman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/599631,9Got in almost 6 miles today hiking the Smokemont Loop trail in the Smokies. Good trail for training. Goes up from the start about 1400 ft in 2 miles. Have to admit I was sucking a little wind at times. Second half is all downhill. Trail was in great shape and I had it too myself. Did not see so much as one creature of wildlife. Just me and the trees.,,View Entry,"Aug 07, Tue",5.90
Clingman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601240,"Well, Got in a 10.4 mile hike in the Smokies today. Chasteen Creek is a great prep trail. Has an elevation change of over 2600 ft in 4 miles. It is pretty much straight up going out with limited switchback. Also, very rocky!!!!!  Really beautiful though with lots of water. When I reached Hughes Ridge at the summit, I spooked a huge owl. Must have had a wing span of six ft. Also, tons of Elk out today on 441, just out of Cherokee. Just got a new pair of Altra Lone Peak 4.0 in the mail,when I got home. Can't wait to try them out. Think my wife and I will take the iron horse for a ride tomorrow. Going to be a beautiful day.

Clingman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611691,"After a seven hour drive yesterday thru torrid rain, and I mean cats and dogs, we arrived at the Harpers Ferry Hostel in one piece.  Got acquainted with the surroundings, had dinner at a local Italian restaurant (the largest calzone that I have ever seen) and came back to turn in early.
Got up this morning around seven and had a great breakfast that was offered at the hostel.  Everyone pitched in cooking and washing dishes but the food was free and tasty. Went across the river, back into Harpers Ferry and spent the day with our fellow hikers. First stopped by the AT Conservancy Headquarters and picked up my pack tag and recorded all my information so that I can be found or identified should Yogi eat me or something. Attended 4 workshops and visited the historical district. My first time here so the history of John Booth, Stonewall Jackson, etc. was very fascinating.  The architecture and old buildings are really something.  The Italian food was so good last night that we ate there again tonight. Went a little more sensible tonight with a tasty steak and cheese salad. This was after attending a kick off party that was in our honor, the class of 2019 Flip Floppers.  Got a group photo taken  with all my fellow celebs. Turning in now but going back to town tomorrow for a pancake breakfast that is for the first wave of hikers taking off tomorrow. Will attend a few more workshops tomorrow.  One is about food and nutrition so I am looking forward to it.  Getting antsy and ready to start my adventure on Monday.Until later....

Clingman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611807,"The calm before the storm.  The night before. Gentlemen, start your engines. Last chance to turn back.  NOT A CHANCE.  Enjoyed one last day in Harpers Ferry before starting the trail tomorrow. This morning, had a killer pancake breakfast with cakes, sausage, fruit salad, coffee and orange juice that was provided by a local Methodist church.  Then had a send off for the hikers leaving today. About 12 brave souls took off in a cloud of dust (or should I say rain drops). Looks to be about 38 when we launch in the morning. Attended some more workshops at the Flip Flop festival.  One was all about dehydrating food (got some great recipes) and another about foot care (have to take care of the vessels that are going to make 5 million steps and take me 2192 miles). Had a great lunch at the Cannonball deli (beef burrito bowl). Hung out and talked  with other hikers at the AT Conservancy for the rest of the afternoon.  Met a young fellow (well, they are all younger than me) who started at Springer in January and was carrying a pack that weighed between 70 and 80 pounds. You had to see it to believe it. Kudos to the staff of the AT Conservancy for putting on the FF festival.  It was organized and very informative.  They really care about each and every hiker and want us to be successful, no matter what your goal may be.  Cap and I ended up walking 9 miles today between walking in town and the stroll back and forth from the hostel. Woody, Cap and I took advantage of the washer and dryer at the hostel so everything is clean for now. Won't last long. Well, that's it for now.  Send your prayers my way and I'll keep you posted.

They had another send off for today's flip floppers but our hostel was 2 miles from town and then we would have had to come right back by the hostel so we decided to forego the ceremonial departure. What a gorgeous day for hiking. Temps in the 50's and sun shining. A few miles up the trail we came to Weverton Cliffs. Beautiful views of the Potomac River (pictures in my photos).  6 miles later, we came upon Gathland State Park. The empty tomb of Gath is here (story in one of the pictures) and some neat ruins. We forged on to our first camp at Crampton shelter. Got there early so beat everyone to the best tent sites. Had a tortilla wrap for lunch, spam and tuna. Know that Mrs Clingman is saying ""please say you didn't"".  Lots of hikers flowed in throughout the afternoon. Becoming good friends with ""snail mail"" and ""totem"", I couple of old farts like us.  Cooked some Knorr rice for dinner. Its almost 8 and I'm in my tent, under my warm quilt. Feels great to be resting. The trail was full of rocks. Just preparing us for what lies ahead in PA.

We took our time leaving camp and got on the trail at 8:30. Did not overdo it and knocked out the miles to our destination. Talked with lots of section hikers and some flip floppers. The trail was really rocky!!! Not suppose to get bad until PA but it was rough. Think I've said that before but did I tell you it is rocky? Got to Dahlgren park at around 2:30. What a nice spot that was created by Maryland park services and it is just for backpackers. Porcelain toliets that flush, hot and cold showers, super tent pads, bear bag poles and a grill and picnic table at every tent site.
Really sounds like we're roughing it huh? Hey, have to enjoy it while we can. There will be tougher days ahead but for now, the temps are wonderful, the sun shines and the company is great. Couldn't ask for anything else. Until later...

Clingman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612191,"No signal last night so just now uploading yesterday's hike. What more can be said when you spend another day on the AT except thank you Lord! It is truly hard to believe as I walk along seeing nature, sites of true Americana, meeting the people and camping in a tent every night. And this is just day 3. I truly am blessed. Left Dahlgren camp this morning after a little mishap last night with a tent malfunction (user induced) where rain poured in. Spent some time mopping up and slept on a wet bag liner and then listened to a steady wind all night. But a lesson learned and all is well. After a mile or so we came to the Washington Monument (picture in photos) but could not go in due to repairs being made. A truly remarkable story where the townspeople wanted to honor one, if not the greatest man to ever lead this nation, 28 years after his death. They used stone that was laying around the site and erected the structure in 2 days. Yes, you heard me right. When we left there I spotted a doe crossing our path. Our first deer sighting. As we crawled along, a couple nobos flew by us. Resident Daddy leading and Farmer came along shortly chasing him. These guys are the ones with trail legs and are doing 30 mile days. Just a pipe dream for us right now but we're fine with that. We crossed over interstate 70 on a bridge and the cars below were waving and honking. Stopped at Pine Knob shelter and had lunch. Some more spam on a tortilla and some trail mix. I was really hungry. Then we had an arduious climb for what seemed an eternity, straight up platform after platform divided by logs and such that you could not get a rhythm. Finally came to our camp for the night at Annapolis Rocks (see photo).  Might get a little rain tonight and tomorrow but what's a little liquid sunshine? Had a great dinner of Idahoan potatoes with bacon bits. Looking forward to tomorrow.

I'm fed and in bed usually by 8 pm. So I have time on my hands before falling asleep. A light rain last night but nothing bad so I woke to a beautiful sunrise. Woody was up and out of camp by 6:30. He had some shoe problems so he was having his wife send him another pair to Waynesboro. Has to be there by noon on Saturday to pick them up so he did an 11 miler today. He'll catch back up with us on Sunday. Cap and I got out of camp at 8 am and headed north. We hit some of the rockiest trail yet. There were long stretches where my feet never hit the ground (see photo)  Cap needed to resupply so when we got to Hwy 17, we headed to the town of Smithburg. I put out my thumb and we got our first trail magic hitch. A nice young lady picked us up and took us the 2 miles into town. Hikers never like to walk senseless miles that don't count towards our trail miles so a ride is always greatly appreciated. We went to a nice Dollar General and loaded up. Problem was, we should have eaten before shopping. There was nothing that didn't look edible and we bought way too much. You should have seen Cap trying to get everything in his bear bag. There was a great deli next door and we ordered up. I had a delious meatloaf sandwich and a large sweet tea. Yummy. Cap had some fried chicken and slaw. Sat outside on a picnic table and got rid of all the unnecessary packaging on all our food items. When we were done, I asked a man in a pickup with his son if he would mind taking us back to the trail head. He said sure if we didn't mind riding in the bed with a bunch of sod dirt on the floor. Hey, you never turn down a ride. He was ex military and really nice. His son wanted to come ""camping"" with us. Camp was a short distance away and we set up our tents. Had a great dinner of Idahoan potatoes dolled up with 2 Baby Bel cheeses and some Hickory Nut Gap pepporoni that I brought from home.

Clingman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612337,"Happy Friday!!!  Someone felt the need to deplete their entire supply of ammo last night, about 100 yards from our camp, but thankfully they quit when it got dark. Cap and I were on the trail at 8 and set out for the Raven Rock shelter. A tranquil hike for a few miles through nice woods and a lush field was a great way to start the day. (see photos). Met Nitro who was finishing the second leg of the entire trail. He had walked the first half last year after graduating from UCF. Next year he starts med school in Miami. You just never know who you'll meet on the trail. We crossed a beautiful river and started a really tough climb up to Raven Rock. Haven't got my true trail legs yet but it's getting easier. We got to the shelter at 11:30 and decided it was way too early to call it a day so we made the decision to hike on to PenMar park and go into the town of Waynesboro to meet up with Woody. Called a shuttle service and got a ride to the Days Inn. They have a special rate for hikers so we got our own rooms. Really great to have a bed and a shower. One thing you miss on the trail is veggies so we ate at Waynes Burgers and I had a big Greek salad and a double cheeseburger. Cap and I then walked to a nearby laundry mat and washed all our clothes. A real treat to have clean duds. Another reason for going to town is that it is really storming tonight so it's nice to not be in a tent. Well, that's it for today. Just caught the second half of Forest Gump and thought ""I just felt like hiking""

Clingman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612418,"The stay at the Days Inn was pleasant. The management liked hikers and made our stay enjoyable. They lost money on us with all the hot showers we took. My bed was very comfortable but I'll been having trouble sleeping ever since I've been on the trail. Hope that will past soon. Just an old man set in his ways and slow to adapt to change. Had a couple of hard boiled eggs, bowl of raisin bran, glass of Apple juice and 2 cups of coffee at the hotel. Woody called our shuttle driver, another Roger, and he came in about 15 minutes. A retiree that has a good thing going giving rides to hikers. He stopped by Walmart and let me run in to pick up some Great Grains and some Nido milk. Was getting low on breakfasts. We hit the trail at 10:15 out of Pen Mar. A tenth of a mile later, we crossed the state line into Pennsylvania. One behind us. Had the easiest hike so far. Mostly flat or slightly down hill. Ran across some trail magic at a road crossing. Not much left in a cooler but did get some water. Met No Name and TaDa who are heading north like us. Cap, Woody and I walked at our own pace today so we separated and walked our own hike. We always have a plan as to where we will meet later on. I walked a ways today with Jupiter. She is a young lady from Knoxville. Hot and muggy today with the chance of rain at any time. We arrived at the Tumbling Run shelter and got set up before any liquid fell. A great new shelter with nice tent pads. The club that built it has a sense of humor as they placed a door bell outside the privy door and a light switch inside that had up for solar and down for lunar. All a joke of course. Ate light tonight. Some nuts, trail mix and a Cliff bar. In my tent now at 6:30 and the bottom has opened up. High and dry though. Love my Zpacks duplex tent. Tomorrow we are shooting for 10 miles to Caledonia state park. Thanks to all who are following me. Your support means everything to me. God bless and talk to you tomorrow.

It started early last night and dumped inches on us. The shelter's grounds were underwater. Woody took off early this morning. Cap left around 8 and I got out out at 9:30. Didn't sleep again so was moving slow getting going. Did not take many pictures today as my phone was packed away to stay dry. The trail was a river for most of the time. Tried for a few minutes to not step in huge puddles but that ended soon. Slogging through water all day. Had some massive rocks formations to negotiate and had to extra careful with the wet conditions. Had our biggest day of 10 trail miles (always walk more off trail). We're going to camp at Caledonia State Park but when we got there it was really wet (see photo of creek running through park) and the folks there were not to thrilled with AT hikers. Woody had gone to a nearby hostel so Cap and I joined him. He had the beat. Staying at the Trail of Hope Ministries Hostel. In a bed again with a hot shower and clothes washed. All for $26 that included a shuttle ride from the park. We ate at a great mom and pop restaurant called Timbers (see photo) which in well known among the hiker community. I had a cheeseburger and a sausage and Swiss cheese omlet with home fries. Very tasty. Back at the hostel and hoping to get some sleep. Sure beats setting a tent up in the rain and being wet.

They are a husband and wife team walking to raise money for MS.  We left the hostel at 7:30 and walked along Hwy 30 back to pick up the trail at Calendonia park. As always, a very steep climb to begin. Any time you come into civilization, you have to climb back out of it. Hit a few doozies today but for the most part we hiked along the ridge tops. Took my first fall today. Trying to keep from marching through a big mud bog, my feet hit a slick spot and down I went. Managed to land on my pack so nothing hurt but my pride. I looked like a turtle on his back. We found a big clearing where power lines go through and took an extended break (see photo).  Got our wet tents out and let them dry. I was in the lead and startled a huge doe to my left. All a saw was about a 2 foot flag, straight up and heading away. Came across the Milesburn cabin on a beautiful stream. It can be rented by the public (see photo). We cameled up (meaning drank about a liter of water) and filled our bottles. Got to our destination about 2 pm.

Probably about 14 of us here tonight including Chop, Treadmill, Early Bird and Lightfoot. Still trying to decide what we will do tomorrow. A famous place to stay, Ironmasters mansion hostel, is what we had planned on but turns out they are closed on Tuesdays so we will adjust our itinerary.

Had 10 miles to go so started pushing. The trail was very diverse today from dry high ground to very wet lowlands. At one point that was literally a creek running down the trail from all the rain. Footing was treacherous so it was a tiring day with having to think about each step. Stopped and had lunch at Tom's Run shelter. Today we passed the halfway point for North bounders which means little to us. Our half way will be about 70 miles south of Mt Katadin. Made it into Pine Grove Furnace state park. It is where the AT museum is located. A real nice fellow was on duty and was a wealth of knowledge. Cool to see all the history documented in pictures and a lot of the old hiker gear was on display. Even had Grandma Gatrwood's keds on display. For those of you who don't know, she thru hiked the AT in 1955 at the age of 67 and did it twice after that, wearing ked sneakers. She was the first woman to complete the thru hike. This park is also home to the general store where they hold the ice cream challenge. If you eat a gallon of ice cream, you are rewarded with a wooden spoon. One, we don't have that hiker hunger yet and even if I did, my system wouldn't be right for a week. No takers in our group. They do have the greatest burgers on the trail as Cap and I can attest (see photo).  Stayed at the park and it was a really good deal. Tent site, showers and bathrooms for $13. All facities were super clean. We even  got the senior discount, sad to say. Hung our bear bags. The ranger said there is a mama and 2 cubs ransacking the dumpsters at night. Got my first blisters, one on each foot. Have to remember to wash my socks out daily when they get wet and muddy. Well tomorrow's another day. As always, I fell like the most blessed man on earth.

Were planning to stay in a shelter but after looking at it, we decided to forge ahead to Deer Run, just another 4.3. Got there at 4 and checked in at general store (see photo). Chop had called ahead and reserved a cabin. Was told it could sleep 8 and had a kitchen. Well the girl at the store checking us in had her light on but nobody was home. The cabin slept 3 with no kitchen. She later said she had never been in the cabin herself. Ya think?

Had some big ups and downs before we got to the Rock Maze. It was literally a rock scramble and I felt like a rat looking for a piece of cheese. Even though it is marked, there were times when I did not know which way to go. I attached a link that will give you  somewhat of an idea what it entailed. 
https://youtu.be/2849ifbTlz4  Anyway, it was loads of fun! Did more ups and downs and then, low and behold, the forest opened up to miles and miles of farm land (see photos). Pretty muddy but easy walking. The trail then led us into the town of Boiling Boiling Springs. Waited at the AT Mid Atlantic Regional office. Here my tramily moved on (I'll catch up with them later)and I was picked up by a friend, Terry Turney, that I met on a trail back in Oct in NC. He told me if i ever hiked the trail, call him and he would let me stay with him. This man is a saint. I have washed my clothes, had a hot shower, and then he took me to a local restaurant (Nick's 114 cafe) where I had a huge chef salad (yes dear, I'm eating my veggies) and some potato skins. Staying here tonight in a comfy bed. He's generous enough to also let me take my first zero day tomorrow (no miles) and let me heal my blisters. He is also going to take me to Walmart to get a few things and spend tomorrow night. He will then take me back to the trail on Saturday. The world needs more people like Terry. Kindness like this to a thru hiker is priceless. Well, I'm now alone from my original group. Woody had some unexpected things come up back home that he had to take care of. He drove back today. He hated to leave and I enjoyed hiking with him. And Cap is going home to try and rest his pulled Achilles tendon. He just had an unfortunate injury that was not expected. He was keeping up but we both agreed that it was not worth causing permanent damage if he continued at this point. If he can get feeling better, he is going to come back and join me. I will miss him and wish him a speedy recovery. Well, that's it for now. I couldn't be more relaxed. Praise the Lord for all he has done for me so far. Oh, by the way, I passed my first 100 mile mark. Yee Haw!!!

Clingman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613123,"Took my first zero today and it was much needed. Amazing how the body can recoup in a short time period. Got a great nights sleep and look for another tonight. Terry took me breakfast at a mom and pop diner, let me shop at Wal-Mart and Giant foods and we ate dinner again at Nicks 114. Had another salad and a killer Sheppards pie made with real roast beef instead of hamburger. Again, I can't thank Terry enough for his hospitality and generosity. We had some great conversations and formed what I think will be a lasting friendship and he is a true Patriot. He even helped me doctor my blister by applying New Skin to it. Need I say more?  My tramily also took a zero so we are going to meet up at the trailhead in the morning to continue our quest. Until later...

The tramily showed up about 15 minutes later and we set out. After just one day off, the pack felt extra heavy. The trail weaved in and out of wooded areas and rolling fields. The views all day looked like something out of a Norman Rockwell picture book. Green pastures, stalks of last year's corn, new crops ready to reach skyward, silos in groups of five, tractors plowing the hard earth, barns of all shapes and sizes, cows chewing their cuds in lush grass and wildflowers blooming everywhere. We did our biggest day so far at 14.3 miles but most was very level with just a few ups and downs. Now I did say ""most"" because the last mile was straight up with no switchbacks. Really tough. Got to the shelter at 3 pm and the shelter was packed. Am trying my first night in a shelter for 2 reasons. One, the weather is turning horrible and rain is all that is forecast for tomorrow and days beyond. Two, a boy Scout troop is taking all the available tent sites. Not looking to get any sleep tonight. Headed to Duncannon tomorrow which is around 10 something away but will be tough sledding due to the rain. I want to wish my beautiful bride a very happy birthday (did before this is posted). Hope you had a wonderful day. Well, at least I will be dry in the shelter tonight.

Clingman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613373,"Welcome to my world. My first night  in a shelter was surprising pleasant. I slept like a baby and got one of the best nights sleep yet. We were cramed in like sardines, sleeping on the floor and Treadmill said I was kicking her all night. I am a thrasher when I sleep. Well, the rain started in the night and was falling in the morning and did not quit all day. No Service had stayed with us and was the first to leave. Everyone else was slow to get up so I left by myself soon after. This rainy day was far worse than the previous one I hiked in. The wind howled, the rain, hard and steady, the trail flooded and demanding, severe ups and downs and of course, rocks. Oh, and the temps were in the upper 40's. Here's where the story turns dark. The previous day, my feet had done well. I had wrapped them in walmart bags to keep the mud and grime off them. I knew they would get damp from sweat but that would happen anyway, with or without. I knew that the pain was there but not in a way that was requiring my constant thoughts. I really felt pretty good. But today, no bags would work. They were shredded in no time due to the constant friction of my feet sliding on rocks. At about the 5 mile mark of a 10 mile day, my feet were killing me. I was constantly walking in ankle deep water and I could tell that something was terribly wrong. It felt like I had a grapefruit under each foot. I could barely walk and was was crying out with each step. I thought about calling for a rescue but that seemed too dramatic. So, I just prayed. The last half mile into Duncannon was straight down hill on big rocks, some step like and others just loose. I finally came to a road and could not believe I had made it down. Not meaning to be melodramatic but it was the Good Lord that got me off that mountain. There really is no way other way to explain it because I could barely hobble on flat land much less attack the down hill that I just came from. Now my good friend Terry told me that if me or any of my friends needed anything in the coming days, he was close enough to lend a hand. So guess who I called. He came and picked me up and took me back to his house. I immediately took a warm shower and laid down. All of a sudden, I started shaking violently and couldn't stop. He went next door to see if his neighbors, Chris and Christen, were home. Chris is paramedic and Christen is a nurse in the ER. She took one look at my feet and said I needed to go to the hospital. She could tell that they were infected and needed attention. So off we went to the ER. They took xrays and did blood work. Gave me an IV for hydration and morphine for my pain. It is like trench foot and can happen over night. They determined that the infection had not spread so they sent me home with 2 different antibiotics and told me to stay off my feet for a couple of weeks. No problem because I can barely walk. 
So here I lie in a bed at Terry's. I am welcome to stay as long as needed but going to see if I can feel good enough in a couple of days to rent a car to get home. I know that Terry is probably hoping that I loose his number if I ever travel this way again. But seriously, I don't know what I would have done without him. He gave up half his day and missed an important dinner with his daughter on Mother's Day to take care of me. You can't tell me that God is not at work here. But most of all I lie here devastated and broken hearted. This is something that I've wanted all my life. I never dreamed this would happen. I always thought that if something did happen, it would be a fall or a knee, not my feet. I don't understand how others don't suffer the same fate. Most of us are wearing the same shoes and there's no way to keep your feet dry. I'm just going to have to find a way to toughen mine up. I'm not giving up. If I can get well, I plan to either return and continue on the northern route or maybe go down to Springer and hike north. Mainly, I want to thank everyone for your prayers and support. It meant the world to me. Hopefully I will be able to continue the story soon.

Clingman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615047,"Thought that I would give an update for anyone that might be interested. My right foot is not healing as quickly as I had hoped. Dead skin is peeling off but the whole ball of the foot is tender to the touch. I can walk with no problem but if anything sharp or pointed hits it, I see stars. So here's the new plan. The logistics are just a little too involved to make this a thru hike this year, so I am going to test out my new socks, insoles and shoes in the very near future and continue to hike the Smokies to stay in shape.  I am then going to return to Harper's Ferry, week one or two of August and complete the hike to Springer as originally planned. I will then return to Duncannon next spring and finish the trail to Katadin. Did not see this as as a 2 year endeavor when I started out but hey, I am going to see this through.

The sunset was spectacular but boy, was it chilly. 48 degrees with a stiff wind. At least being locals, we knew how to dress. Felt bad for the tourists up there in flip flops and shorts.  Ran into my good friend, Johnny, from bible study and we got to catch up. The feet have healed, I have new shoes, new insoles and new socks, so hopefully I'm good to go. Here's the plan. Having my sweet wife take me to Fontana Dam on Tuesday morning. Going from there to Springer. The trail will be much drier than in PA, which should also help the feet. She will then pick me up and we are going to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary in mid July. Going to Charleston SC for some sight seeing and time on the beach. Then, renting a car and heading back to Harpers Ferry around the first of August and hiking back south to Fontana Dam. Hope to meet up with Rabbit, Greyhound and Treadmill when they flop. This will complete the southern half. Wanted to finish the thru hike but will have to settle for a 2 year venture. Will go back next April and try to complete the walk to Katadin.

Clingman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616991,"Man, does it feel great to back on the trail. Left from Fontana Dam at 10:10 am after being dropped off by Mrs Clingman. Starting off with a 6.6 mile day. Planned some short first days and boy was that a good idea. I have basically done nothing for 5 weeks except lay around the house and take care of my feet and oh, does it show. I have lost everything I had gained in PA. The trail is pretty much straight up (see photo) leaving Fontana so there was a lot of puffing and panting along with frequent stops on the way. Pasted a trail crew and thanked them for their service. They do a remarkable job along all of the trail (see photo). Then when I reached the summit, the skies opened up and rained on me till i reached the shelter a couple of hours later. After the ordeal with my feet, I'm a little paranoid about hiking in wet shoes. I have a couple of mild hotspots but hopefully they won't get any worse. The shelter was empty when I arrived but shortly 3 young ladies came in. They were down from Chicago to attend a music festival in Tennessee and then came over for a 2 day hike. They are going back to Fontana tomorrow and heading home. It was nice to have a little company on a rainy night. The shelter has no bear cables and very few limbs to hang a bag so I'm glad I have an Ursack. Well, that's about it for now. This will be posted late due to no signal.

Clingman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616997,"Second day without a signal, so eventually there will be a few to read. Well, made it 2 days. A lot of puffing and panting still going on. Rained all night and was pouring at 8 am. So, knowing that I had just 6 miles to cover (yeah just) I rolled back over. The Chicago girls never stirred because they were going 6 back to Fontana also. It was the latest I've ever gotten up when camping but when it's raining and you're warm and dry in a shelter, it's easy to not move till 10 am. Took my time and left at 11:50. Lisa helped me get my poncho on and off I went into the rain. My feet were soaked in no time and here's where I have to give a shout out to my hiking buddy, Cap. He uses and suggested Wrightsocks. I bought 4 pair and the last 2 days have been soakers for the feet. I do have some hot spots but keeping my fingers crossed. 
I was having some flashbacks today. I had to traverse many difficult rock formations. Thought I was back in PA. Didn't help that they were nice and wet and slick. I took a pretty good fall but went down on my pack. Luckily nothing hurt but my pride. Had only the view of Fontana Lake today. Got to Brown Fork gap shelter at 4 pm and was shocked that I had it to myself. As I was leaving Cable Gap shelter this morning, ran into 6 nobos that were at my shelter the night before and they said it was packed.  I'm typing this at 7:30 pm and still no one else has showed, so lucky me (see photos). I fixed a tuna wrap when I arrived and cooked some Chicken Alfredo later on. It was tasty. Another purchase that I am thrilled with is my Ursack bear bag. Eliminates the need to find a limb (which there are none) to hang a bag (see photo) I just tie mine around a tree (see photo).  Well I'm fat, dumb and happy again. Think I'll turn in.

So was about to doze off around 1am when a super cell decided to blow thru. I have not seen it rain like that in years. I bet it was falling 3 inches an hour. Along with lightning, thunder and at least 50 mph winds. The shelter had a metal roof so you couldn't hear yourself think. Had to get up and move everything deep into the shelter. Then after sheer exhaustion was set in about 4 am and I was getting use to the rain, I heard a noise that sat me straight up. I thought that the roof had caved in. This morning I woke to find a fallen tree right next to the shelter. Lucky it didn't fall on me. Got away at 8:45 for a nine miler. This turned out to be more than I needed to bite off. Topped of at an elevation of 5360 ft (see photo).  But it's not like you can just order up a weeks worth of 2000 - 3000 days. For all the rocks in PA, you didn't have the long, long climbs that you find here. Its fun to be out again but kind of boring as far as only one view (see photo) and no wildlife. You are in the green tunnel. Did see one nice flame azalea (see photo). Plus it rained steady after about 11am. The trail is also really overgrown. Lots of thorn vines everywhere. I don't normally hike as much this time of year around here so I was a little shocked. Met some nice hikers on the trail and chatted with quite a few of them at length. Got to my shelter around 4 pm. Only one other section hiker at home. JW is from Dallas and is going to Fontana Dam. He is a school teacher and he was blowing my mind with stories about today's youth. Had a spam wrap and some black beans and rice. Hopefully the rains stay away. The shelter was a double decker and I met some girls on the trail that had stayed there the night before. They said the mice were plentiful. I put a protein bar wrapper on the top and they knocked it around. Never saw any down below. I am concerned about my feet though. After 3 days of walking in the rain, it's taking its toll. I might not have let that virgin skin from my last episode toughen up enough. Well, we'll see what tomorrow brings. Until later...

JW and I had our breakfast, packed our gear and said our goodbyes. He was headed to Stecoah Gap to try and hitch a ride into Robbinsville. He had Sprint, so no signal anywhere.  I knew I had just seven miles and that it was mostly downhill so I was in no real hurry. Not many views or much interesting. Passed a memorial that had been erected in memory of Wade Sutton (see photo). He was a firefighter who list his life nearby while fighting a wildfire years before. Now I had heard over the years about the climb out of NOC for nobos and how it ranks right up there with one of the toughest. As my day progressed, I was thanking the Lord over and over again for helping me tackle this section while heading south. If you are north bound, you literally climb for 5 miles straight up. There are switchbacks but man, it would be brutal. It was hard enough going downhill. It took a toll on my feet. It was the first day that I was not hiking in the rain but the damage was done. I had called Mrs Clingman to meet me at NOC to bring me some dry socks. By the time she arrived, I evaluated the situation and realized that I needed to get my feet tougher. My heart said push on but my head said stop. It's nothing like b4 and I just want to make sure it did not have a chance to get that way. I want to still be able to head to Harper's in August. I talked with Rabbit and Greyhound and they are still moving along. They are in Connecticut and doing well. Sure wish I was with them. I learned another thing this trip. During my walk up north, I wore long pants and long sleeve shirts and was quite comfortable. These past few days I decided to hike in shorts and short sleeves. Man, did I pay a price (see photos).  My legs and arms got torn up. And this was not bugs or poison ivy. Just different foliage that did not agree with me. Oh well, back to the pants and sleeves.

Mrs Clingman and I drove to Harpers Ferry yesterday and we stayed at the Clarion Inn. It was super close to where I needed to start my southbound hike. Got on the trail at about 8:30 am. Just so happened to pick one of the hottest days of the summer to hike (97) and could have stood to get an earlier start but it was what it was. Mrs Clingman dropped me off and headed back home. Couldn't do this without her. I did not realize that there was the mile long wilderness trail, out of the town to the crossing of the Shenandoah River. Hadn't gone a quarter of a mile and saw 3 deer. Pretty neat. After just a mile I was drenched in sweat. Man, it was a hot one. One good climb to start but wasn't bad after that. Saw more deer. They are feasting on acorns. Met a really nice young man from Bolivia. He is over for a few weeks on a missionary visa. I met him right after I took one of the worst falls that I have ever taken while hiking. Got my feet tangled up somehow and did a header into a bed of rocks. A sharp edged rock hit directly on my right knee cap and I immediately had a hematoma the size of golf ball protruding out of my leg. My elbow took it hard also and I was bleeding up a storm. That's when Teo (from Bolivia) came up on me. I emptied my pack and got to a strip of KT tape to try and wrap my knee up. I was so wet that nothing would stick. Wasn't a whole lot I could do but keep walking. Amazingly, it did not hurt (much).  Tomorrow will probably be a different story. Starting to think that someone wants me off the trail but not giving in yet. Will forge ahead. May have to take a zero. We'll see. Teo was so concerned about me getting to where I needed to go that he went back from where he had just come from, to hike with me. He was great company and I learned a lot about a country that I knew little of. As we walked, I met some other hikers who gave me a number to a shuttle driver who I would call to take me to Bear Feet Retreat.

It is run by the Potomac AT Club and used to house club members when they are working on the trail. They also conduct seminars and training for the club. But, they also accommodate hikers with a cabin that has 2 bunk beds and a number of nice tent pads for camping. I'm sitting on a huge screen porch with a fan blowing on me. Not bad huh? Also a water spigot next to the big house so no having to hike to a stream and filter water. All of this and it's free. They do ask for donations, which I was more than  happy to make.  I'm just enjoying the place to myself for now. Dave had to go to Dullis and pick up his wife at the airport.

I went ahead and bid him adu because I knew that I would likely never see him again. He started at Katadin on June 22 and has covered 1200 miles. And he uses no treking poles. Ahh to be young and fearless. Jumped out for the last 10 miles of the Coaster. 
I had been hiking for a couple of hours when it seemed like I was running into a lot of day hikers. Then it dawned on me that today was Saturday. All the city folk come to the woods to unwind. Lots of dogs too. Even ran into a tour group of about 15 people with a guide. I have stop and answer a lot of questions for them. Most were from India and were enthralled with meeting a long distance hiker. I later found the area where they had parked and walked in. I take my hat off to them. It wasn't the easiest of hikes and they weren't dress for the occasion, if you know what I mean. 
Later I had to cross another parking area and when I did, a little yipping ankle biter came at me with everything he had. Love dogs not on a leash. I was using my treking poles to keep him at bay when the little girl came running for the dog. Then she took a header on the gravel road and proceeded to wail. The father is then tending to her and screaming at the dog to come. Quite the fiasco. I just kept walking and the dog finally turned around. 
Finished the Coaster and in doing so passed the 1000 mile mark to Springer Mt. Gosh, it's just around the corner, right?  Got to my shelter (see photos) around 3:15. Felt good for my first 10 miler.

Clingman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621771,"Dots (young lady that camped at the shelter) and I got going around 8:15. When we hiked back to the trail, we said our goodbyes and she went north and I headed south. Now I enjoy the solitude but when you are the only one on the trail, you eat a LOT of spider webs. Stopped at the next shelter 4.7 miles away and got water. A really nice, cold spring. I then ran into the only three people I would see on trail today. At least they had cleared the webs to the parking lot at the bottom of the mountain. Then out of no where, I scared a big ol bear who was feeding in some heavy cover next to the trail. He tore off like his ass was on fire and sounded like a late freight tearing through the brush. I saw his back but he went about 30 yards where I couldn't see him. Scared the nunu out of me too. Crossed some tracks (see photo).  Then had the biggest climb yet. Wasn't but about 1000 ft but it happened in a half mile. Some rough sections (see photo). When I got to the top there was a great meadow crossing and a bench in the middle of nowhere, so I took a break (see photos). Got to my destination in 5.5 hrs and covered 10.1 miles. Starting to feel stronger. The shelter was as nicer or nicer than the last one. Great chairs in front, a shower and even horseshoes (see photos). Later a flip flopper came in (Lady Dundee).  She summited Katadin a week ago and is headed south. Won't see her after tomorrow. Another couple of southbounders came in and we'll probably see a lot of each other. I had run into them a few times but we never got the chance to talk. Carol (no trail name) and Wiseman. Taking a nero tomorrow (hiking just 5 miles to a hostel)  They will shuttle me into Front Royal to re-supply. I'm out of food. Can do my laundry there at the hostel also. Well another day has passed and I still feel so blessed. Oh yeah, passed 200 miles today. Little milestones. They all count.

Clingman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621827,"God has blessed me with another wonderful day. Got on the trail early at 7:30. Only 4.9 miles to Mountain Home. Took an unexpected detour though. The trail was not blazed for a left turn and the trail continued straight also. Well, my head was down and I continued straight. Came to a gravel road and realized I had not seen a blaze in a while. Had to double back and find where I had missed it. Added a half mile to my day. Made it to Mountain Home hostel (see photo). Wiseman and Caboose (Carol got her trail name) came later and they had made the same detour I did. A great hostel run by Scott and Lisa. Got a shower and they did our laundry. Then they took us to town. Front Royal has been named an official trail town and it is a neat place. Scott dropped us off and we chowed down Front Royal Brewery. Had a nice salad and a French dip. Hit and ATM and then walked to Martin's (their version of Ingles)(see photo) to re-supply. Now I have a full food bag and a lovely 10 pounds to lug around again. Will need it though as we enter the Shenandoah National Park tomorrow. We called Scott and he came and picked us up. We have a full hiker cabin tonight with 2 ladies and 4 guys. All of us South bound. Fruit Loop, Anhaga, Wiseman, Mojo, Caboose and Clingman make up the crew. A good group of hikers. Will have a 13 mile day to reach the first camping area. Some areas are having bear concerns so we will have to be diligent in hanging our bags. We have filled out our permits needed to camp and we'll drop them off at a kiosk as we enter the park. Looking forward to the 112 miles of the Shenandoah's. They serve us breakfast in the morning and we have our choice of items. I put my order in for French Toast. Well, lights out and hopeful I can sleep because we have a full day tomorrow.

I managed to stay up right and not fall.  I am thankful that my feet are doing really well. I am thankful for meeting Wiseman and Caboose. They are truly experienced hikers and I'm learning a lot from them. And I'm thankful for completing the biggest day yet, and it was a doozy. Before we left Mountain Home they served us a gormet breakfast. Nothing less than if you were a guest at their B&B (see photo). Got going at 7:40. Had a monster up hill climb first thing. One of 2 real biggies with some smaller ones mixed in. Still lots of sucking a lot of wind. We stopped at around noon for water and by then there wasn't a dry stitch on me. Even my socks were soaked from sweat. God gave me the good sense to take the time to empty my pack and put on a dry pair. Caboose and Wiseman went ahead. Then at 1:15 the sky's opened up. It poured for 2 hours solid. There go the dry socks. Walking in major water. I came to a road crossing and my partners had waited on me. They immediately asked if I had run into the snakes. I said no and they proceeded to tell me about an experience that I would have probably had a heart attack had it been me. When they left me earlier, the sun was still shining. First they walked right up on a huge timber rattlesnake (see photo). It was coiled and ready to strike. Wiseman is a better man than me. Used his treking pole to flip the coil a couple of times to clear the path. Then 10 later, a big copperhead was laying across the path in front of them (see photo).  They made to toss rocks at it to move it. I don't mind telling you, I am really afraid of poisonous snakes so I don't know what I would have done, had it been me. When the rain stopped we came across a spectular view of Shenandoah Valley below (see photo). Made our way to the shelter (call them huts in the park) at 3:40. 13 miles in 8 hours was not bad considering all we went through. Anhaga came in later and we met a real nice sobo named Buzz so 5 of us at the shelter. Just thankful to be safe, dry and warm under my quilt. A very tough but rewarding day. The Shenandoahs are truly beautiful and this is just day one.

Had the biggest climb of the day right out of the gate. 1160 feet. About half way up I had a really neat bear experience. There was one walking along the trail ahead of me. He didn't see me as he rounded a corner. He was about 50 yds in front of me. When I got to the corner He was about to go around another corner and he turned around and stared at me and kept walking, not bothered in the least. This went on one more time and then he hit a long straight away. I was just getting ready to take a picture when he decided he did not like being tailgated and walked to the right up into the woods. Very cool and he was a beautiful creature. Just wish I could have got a picture. The day was filled with awesome views. Stopped in at Skyland lodge. Tons of people getting a jump on Labor day. It was more upscale but I went inside to get my water bottles refilled at the snack bar because the spigot outside was out of order. The patrons inside gave me a wide berth but the gentleman at the snack bar couldn't have been nicer. Got to the shelter at 5 pm after 15,3 miles. Not a soul was there. My tramily left before me this morning and I hadn't seen them. I went ahead and set up in the shelter. Went to the spring and cleaned up and washed out some clothes. Around 6, here comes the crew. They had taken a break at a picnic area earlier in the day and I must had gotten by them. They thought I got off trail so they were happy to see me. We all ate together and going to bed early.

Chance to get the old bones working. We all met on the trail and hiked into Big Meadow lodge and resturant (see photo). Had a meatloaf sandwich and a tossed salad. The sandwich was not that good. They have converted to using a kiosk for looking at the menu with pictures of the food items.  It's like a hamburger ad where they make them look like the biggest and most tasty burger ever. Anyway, we ate and hiked out to our shelter. Lots of people on the trails, being the holiday weekend. Not too many at the shelter tonight. About nine of us.

Did 9.5 miles in exactly 4 hours. Waited for Ahaga at Hwy 33. Taking a nero today. Ahaga was meeting his brother in law and going to his house for the night. He was nice enough to let me ride along and drop me at a Holiday Inn Express in Ruckersville Va. Couldn't check in until 3 so Jim (Ahaga's brother in law) treated us to lunch which was so kind. The food wasn't bad but the waitress was one of those where she was home but no lights on. Gave us a few chuckles. Got to check in around 2. First I took a much needed shower. Then did my laundry. Next went across the parking lot to Dunkin Donuts. Ordered a sausage, egg and cheese crosant and a breakfast burrito bowl. Mighty tasty. Called Mrs Clingman and we got to have a nice lengthy talk, which is rare. As always my thanks to her for allowing me to be out here. She's busy at work and getting ready for the US Nationals Arabian horse show. Made a few other call to friends Alan, Robert and John. Then I decided to take another shower, just because I could.

Everyone left before me this morning and I saw the bear across a gully as he fell out of a tree and walked off. I was a little puney this morning. Couldn't possibly have been the ham and cheese sub, Combo pepperoni pretzels, string cheese stick, can of sardines, a soy chocolate milk and washed it down with a Gatorade that I had for lunch yesterday at the Loft Mountain camp store. Naw, it had to be something else. So I was about an hour behind but managed to catch up later on in the day. I spooked another 2 year old bear and he ran down acrosd Skyline dr. A car was coming but they could stop. They got out with cameras but that bear was long gone. Wiseman came across a big rattler that was still barely moving. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time as a widow maker (big limb falling from a tree) landed on him and got his head and vertebra. He cut the rattles off and counted 13. Anhaga had a run in with a copperhead also. I pray to the good Lord everyday to keep me away from them. So far he has blessed me. Have I mentioned that a don't like snakes?  Had to take a detour off the trail as they had it re-routed around around work on a section of powerlines in the picture above.

Clingman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622606,"What an interesting day. First let me thank my Lord, my God for the ability to have tackled my longest day yet with relative ease. I mean, it was brutal but there's no way I could have done this 3 weeks ago. Really starting to hit my stride. I was first out of camp at 6:45. Just had a pleasant hike to the Humpback rocks, 5.7 miles away. Up but lots of switchbacks. The Humpback rocks were a .2 mile side trail but well worth it (see photos).  The views were incredible. Quite crowded, as there is a parking access nearby and it was Saturday. Always forget about it being the weekend until I see more hikers on the trail. After that, I'm walking along and a bear runs across the trail in front if me. I stop and he slows to a walk. I manage to get a photo (see black object in the middle of pic). Not the greatest pic but did get a shot. Here's where it gets cool. I walk another, say 500 yards and I come across a pipe spring. Water is scarce so I drop my pack on the side of the trail, get my water bag, filter and bottle out and proceed to filter water. As I'm filling a bottle, I look up and here is that same bear, right in front of me not 25 ft away. He has to know I'm there but he is slowly walking up the mountain. There is no way I could get back to my pack to retrieve my camera so I just gently said ""what are you doing big guy"". He stopped, looked at me and kind if cocked his head. I'll swear I thought he was going to come get a drink of water. He wasn't afraid of me and he just turned and continued on. I would never expect to ever get that close again unless I was at a zoo. Then I come to a nice lookout and I stop. As I'm enjoying the view, I catch movement and see a face lean out from behind a rock. A girl waves at me and I wave back with a puzzled look on my face. I turn around to lean my poles on a tree and there's another girl standing stealth in the woods. She waves. So I have to ask, what the hell is going on. She says there is about to be a wedding proposal made by a couple on their way up and they are there to capture the moment on film. I wish them the best and keep moving. Hit a span of about 2 miles with nothing but rocks. Tough sledding. Finished the day with a severe up but made it to camp. Have the shelter to myself again. Had a hearty meal and am comfy under my quilt. The big challenge tomorrow is a huge mountain called the Priest and appropriately we climb it on Sunday. It is a straight up elevation change of 3000 ft. I turned my ankle pretty good today but I think it will be ok. Praying so anyway.

Clingman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622684,"Had a good night at Maupin Field Shelter. Got up and was first out at about 7. Had a pretty big climb out of the gate, up about 1100 ft. to an elevation of 3800 ft. It is called the Three Ridges Wilderness (see photo). The problem came in coming down the other side. It was straight down for 2000 ft and mostly all rock. It was the most treacherous downhill I have ever done. Twice I had to drop my poles and grip the cliff of rock to get down. My ankle was not better and swelling the whole time. I finally made it to Harper's Creek shelter to resupply water. Anhaga joined me followed by Wiseman, Mojo and Caboose. I was feeling pretty drained and beat up. We had lunch and continued down another 1200 ft. Came to a long expansion bridge across the Tye river (see photo). We crossed a road and found the best trail magic. A thru hiker from last year, Crafte, drove all the way from Gainesville, FL with his daughter, Christie, and set up a buffet. They had a grill cooking ribs, hamburgers and hot dogs, fruit, candy bars, cookies, sodas, water and beer (see photo). Plus folding chairs to sit on. Not bad before having to ascend Priest Mt. But it was not to be for me. I felt super blessed to have gotten this far considering what I had endured to this point. But everything finally caught up with me. My ankle had become really swollen and the beating I had taken from my 4 previous falls, a pinched nerve in my neck from always having to have my eyes glued on where I was putting my feet on the rocks and a sciatic nerve pain down my right leg from a previously torn groin, finally took its toll. Egads, I sound pathetic! And the word was that we were still looking at climbing 3000 ft straight up and that it was as rough as what we had just come down. My heart and mind said go but my body said whoa. I thought about pitching my tent nearby and trying the climb in the morning. I bid farewell to my tramily as they decided to make the climb up Priest. I sat with Crafte for awhile and then decided to take them up on their offer to take me back to Waynesboro. Two main reasons was that I was in the middle of nowhere with no phone signal and I was going to be alone, as I would never catch up to my friends. Now I don't mind being alone but given the terrain and my leg giving out at times, I couldn't risk getting injured with no one around. So I took the ride back to Stanimals and got my same room from 3 nights ago. Ate at the same Italian restaurant. Came back and iced my ankle which was purple by now. I rented a car this morning and drove home. Not what I was intending but I have to take care of my body. Sucks to be old. Not giving up my dream but will just have to be satisfied with doing sections at a time. I want to thank Anhaga (Bill), Wiseman (Mike), Caboose (Carol) and Mojo (Beth) for their companionship, encouragement and friendship. I learned a lot from them and we had a lot of fun together. I still hope to  meet up with one or all of them and continue hiking when they get closer down to me in NC. I wish them safe and happy trails as they continue. Thanks to anyone who has been following me and I have had a blast hiking 347 miles so far this year on the AT. I WILL log some more miles this year. Nothing I have is irreparable. Just had a little bad luck. So, stay tuned.
