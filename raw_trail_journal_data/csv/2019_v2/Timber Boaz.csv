Literally one foot in front of the other in the slowest and lowest back woods hurdle competition you've ever seen.
But ive arrived victoriously and have eaten a Kings meal of couscous olive oil and protein nibs with a peanut brittle bar for dessert. Now time to elevate my feet and let Dr j Vernon McGee and the Holy Spirit sing me a lullaby. Starting my hike at the start of The Book.

Easier to concentrate on another's apparent sin than to face my pride of life and look at my own souls condition. Seeking first my own salvation, then and only then offer exhortation and encouragementJust plant good seed, watch it grow in due time and leave separating the wheat from the tares to the Lord at harvest time. Otherwise I may do damage to the wheat growing near the one I see is a tares by it's fruits.The root and the fruit it produces must match to create good fruit. If it does not produce good fruit it shall be hewn down and cast into the fire. But nowhere does it say I'm the only one to do it. That task thankfully belongs to the only righteous Judge, my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.Also reminded me to continually submit to the Holy Spirit and meekness is a byproduct.

Quite a jackhammer to the knees going down all those slopes. With my Bible mp3 down temporary I've been reflecting on the 3 books I covered this week.

Those views are only worth something if it had a cost be it physical, fiscal, spiritual, emotional. All mountains have an access fee. The path of Service and growth or as the patriarchs and myself often choose the path of much striving, blood sweat and tears before asking God why he led me here. Only to be chastened by Him with, I didn't tell you to go here or there and you certainly didn't ask until things got hot?Abraham fled to Egypt not trusting God for provisionJacob stole the birth right and blessings God had already promised himJacob not liking the tables being turned re:birth order with dealing with Uncle LabanMoses thinking he would waltz right in to free his people with his Egyptian intellect.

But accurate... and Oh so applicableWhen I am set in a valley, will I serve those I find or who find me or will I bail on cue when things get uncertain or downright uncomfortable.

Lepars were cut off from society once deemed unclean. No physical interaction or touch from anyone. Such a physical, emotional and psychological stigma to be cast out. But Jesus touched many in his earthly ministry and said be clean and your sins are forgiven.Sin cuts us off from God. Puts a distance between us that only Christ can mediate.

Clothe yourselves, all of you, with humility toward one another, for ""God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.""  6 Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you,  7 casting all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you.  8 Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.  9 Resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same kinds of suffering are being experienced by your brotherhood throughout the world.  10 And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you.  11 To him be the dominion forever and ever.
