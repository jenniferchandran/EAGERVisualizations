Achin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609529,"Well, the time is at hand, finally!  Will be starting off this adventure tonight with my son Andrew driving me to the AMTRAK station in Columbia, SC.  Will spend the night there, leaving at 4am Friday to Washington DC and connecting on to Harpers Ferry WV.  Spending Friday night at Teahorse Hostel there.  On Saturday morning have a shuttle scheduled to drive me to Pen-Mar Park on the MD/PA border to begin my northbound hike.  

 

Everything is planned, packed and ready to go.  Months of training are complete.  And it has been significant.  In 2019 I have hiked almost 400 miles both locally and some in the upstate and VA with more hills. At first it was just walking in nearby Hitchcock Woods.  The last 250 or so was with increasingly heavier backpacks(up to about 38 pounds).  Also took numerous aerobic classes (i.e. Body Combat), weight training and Pickle ball. I am in the best shape I’ve been, easily, verses all my other AT hikes.  In fact I am starting out 54 pounds lighter than my first AT hike in March, 2014.  

 

The picture today is Wendy and I.  Between us we have lost an amazing 107 pounds in the last 9-10 months.  She has been and continues to be an excellent partner in this journey.  I would not have maintained such a healthy eating effort without her.  Have never in my previous life maintained a continual healthy diet coupled with the exercise regimen.

 

Bottom line, I am cautiously optimistic for this being my best hiking effort ever.  I feel great and am eager to get going.  At the same time, I know how difficult it can be on the trail – both physically and mentally.  Not to mention that one mis-step or some other event could bring it to and end in an instant.

 

Please keep on following my journal….and leave a message once and awhile.  They are so nice to get after long days of ups and downs.",,View Entry,"Apr 04, Thu",0
Achin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609672,"Last day before the hike.  And it was quite a long one.  Left Aiken around 8pm.  Andrew left me at the AMTRAK station at 10:15.  There I sat on hard metal seats until my train left at 4:10am.  Arrived a little late in Washington; but easily made connection with next train to Harpers Ferry.  Arrived here about 5:15pm, 30 minute walk (uphill, of course) to Teahorse Hostel, met and had dinner with Marco, and now last minute repacking from travel mode to hiking mode.  Marco is here on a 6 month visa from Germany and doing sections of the AT.
So, tomorrow the latest segment of my multi-year AT experience continues.  Stay tuned for all the tidbits from the trail!
As a separate note, got a message from a hiker friend from 2014, Kokopelli.  She is battling cancer-wish her a speedy recovery.",,View Entry,"Apr 05, Fri",0

Off to a good start, weight loss & tons of training must be the ticket.  Hiked 15.2 miles today and still had some gas in the tank.  That is good because it was another .2 miles off trail to the shelter and at least that much further to it’s water supply.
It was nice hiking conditions of low 40’s to start and up to probably low 60’ later and no rain.  Started off wearing 2 shirts, long pants and a buff.  Later down to one shirt, shorts and no buff.  
Within 10 minutes of my 8:30 start, I crossed off Maryland as another state completed.  Of course at the same point I left “Dixie” and entered “Yankee Land” by crossing the Mason/Dixon line.  Funny, neither the trail, nor the people seemed any different.
Very unusual day in that I passed 3 shelters before stopping at the 4th.  Never seen them so close together.  Stopped at the first 2 for quick water/snack break.  Had lunch at the 3rd and of course set up camp at the fourth.  In tent a little ways away from the dual shelters which are full of Boy Scouts/leaders.  I did have dinner with them.
I am very happy about today’s results.  It is encouraging and I am hopeful I’ll continue to feel so well.  Certainly do not expect all days will be as high a mileage and/or relatively easy.  Nutrition, sleep, weather, trail conditions, etc are all factors. But, so far, so good.
Probably saw about 30 other hikers today none of which were long distance folks.","Teahorse Hostel, Harpers Ferry

A 2nd good day on the AT.  Sleeping much better this year with my new Nemo air mattress.  Inflated to a thickness of about 3” vs my old .5” thick closed cell foam mattress.  It has to make a difference in my performance.
Did an even 13 miles today, not bad at all for so early in a hike.  Saw about 30 hikers again.  All except one were week-end folks.  Am at a shelter tonight with “Man Scout” who is attempting a flip flop thru hike having started at Harpers Ferry.  I know there are several others in the area that I have not run into yet.
Hiked from 8am to 4:30 on a partly clouding, warm day.  In late morning took off my over shirt and rolled up my pants legs.  Believe it got up to about 70 degrees.
This section of the AT in maintained by the Potomac Trail club.  The trail is in good shape, it is marked very well and it contains the best shelters I’ve seen on all of the AT so far.  Both days at lunch I’ve met guys responsible for their shelter who were checking up on them which apparently they do frequently.
I did have one moment of alarm today.  Came upon a sign saying “ trail closed ahead due to storm damage” at Caledonia State Park. I stood there for a few moments trying to decide what to do.  Luckily a jogger happened to appear and he quickly told me the way around and back to the AT (about 10 minutes later).
Tomorrow planning on only a 9.8 mile day, going into a hostel.  
As I lay in my tent it has started raining. It was not suppose to start until overnight some time. My tent is only about 20 feet from a little bubbling creek.  Hope the rain is light(as predicted) so the waters do not rise.","Rock Mountain Shelter, PA

Significant milestone achieved today - passed the halfway point of the entire AT at mile 1096.0.  Took from 3/2014 until 4/2019 to achieve it.  Wonder if I’ll get the 2nd half done sooner?  Perhaps I can avoid another year off for heart surgery.
An easier day today for logistics reasons.  Was finished hiking about 1 pm. There is a 15 mile stretch coming up where there are no shelters and no camping is allowed.  I believe it is so due to the land being owned privately, probably farmers.  Anyway, setting up to get close to where that starts in 2 days and not a long one day.  Also considering food resupply and water sources.
Staying in a hostel tonight within the Pine Grove Furnace SP.  It is a large 2 story building called the “Ironmasters Mansion”.    For $38 you get a room, dinner, breakfast and laundry.  Started hiking at 7am and got here a little after noon.  Hostel does not open until 5pm....so killing time.  Will set up my tent to dry after last nights rain.  As of 7pm I am the only one here on this big old building.  It once housed the family and their servants that ran the Pine Grove Furnace.

A planned easy day of only 11.2 miles.  There have been many previous hikes(if not all) that I would never say that.  Over all my previous AT hikes I have averaged about 8.8 miles per day.  If I excluded zero days, it would probably be an average of about 9.5 to 10 per days hiking.  So to say 11.2 is easy, just makes my day and reflects how my weight loss and training seem to be worth it.
Started out at 7am in temps in the low 50’s.  By mid-day it reached the low 70’s.  Knowing I had 7.5 miles done before noon a long leisurely lunch break sounded great. Just 300 yards off the trail is Green Mountain Store/Deli. Stayed there several hours.  I enjoyed a Cobb Salad, Cheeseburger, Bai Coconut Fusion drink and the biggest 1 scoop of ice cream I’ve ever seen.  Highly recommend this place to all hikers.
When meeting people on the trail the conversation always comes around to where did you start and how far are you going.  My standard response this time is:  it is open ended; but, there are any one of three reasons to end my hike.   1-my body tells me it’s time.   2-my brain/spirit says it is time.   3-I reach the end of the ATObviously based on my previous experience, one of the first two is most likely, much more likely.  Time will tell.  Of course there are other possibilities such as emergencies at home, etc. But people seem to enjoy my 3 part answer.
Now that week-end is over, only saw about 6 people on the trail today.  One was a sound bound flip flopper.  The rest were locals out for day hikes.
Today was the first time I’ve had to hang a bear bag this trip.  First three nights were:  a bear box available, a bear cable available and a hostel stay.  I kind of pride myself on bear bag hanging.  But, tonight was a disaster!  Took somewhere about 20 attempts.  If someone was around with a video camera, I could be a YouTube star.

Another quick & easy day of 7.7 miles going into the town of Boiling Springs, PA.  Hiked from 7:30 until noon starting at about 37degrees. Glad for the cooler weather.  There were 2 rock scrambles that were actually kind of fun.  I don’t usually say that.  Had to sit and slide down once and another time throw my hiking poles up to free my hands to get hand holds to climb up rocks.
Saw a group of about 15 seniors on the trail today.  The last one in line(probably the tour group leader) says to me “I met you last Sunday on the trail”. Her and husband were out on a day hike.  Then she says “Guess your body or spirit have not told you to go home yet” in reference to my 3 reasons for going home that I described yesterday.  Neat!  
Today’s pic is an example of how the AT sometimes looks.  Came down from the mountains today into the farm rich Cumberland Valley.  Walked in thin strips of land between farm fields for close to 2 miles getting into town.
In town met and talked to a son who brought his 66 year old father into town to celebrate his birthday.  Talked quite awhile answering questions about the AT.  Even gave them a page of my ATGuide book(for a section already done) that they were interested in.  I ended up lunching at the same Deli as them and they left before me.  As I was leaving the waitress came to me and handed me a $20 bill.  Said a man asked her to give it to me.  Can’t be certain; but, suspect it was those guys.  Another trail magic, neat.
For my cousin Mary, yes I hang bear bags from tree limbs.  I use a method called the “PCT Method” which you can look up on YouTube.  Need to find a branch about 20’ up that sticks out at least 8’.  Last night there were tons of trees around my campsite; but, I had a hard time finding a good branch.  AND, when I had finished eating and putting it back up the branch broke falling down near me.  So, had to go through the ordeal again.
Been killing time this afternoon in this lovely little town.  Took an inventory of my food bag and determined where my next resupply place will be( 2 days away in Duncannon).  Turns out I do not need to buy anything.  Someday I may learn not to carry around extra weight on my back.
Soon off to the Backpackers Campground just out of town.  Will leave early tomorrow for a longer day with higher mileage.","Unnamed campsite, PA

A good day today.  The easiest 14.7 mile hike.  About the first 13 were flat, not very rocky trails.  Either through or along side of farm fields/pastures.  Felt like I was on a practice hike back in Aiken.  Then the last hour or so were uphill and rocky.  But still not bad.
The weather was back to my liking with a 41 degree start and a high in the 50’s.  
Tonight’s shelter (I’m tenting) is on top of a high ridge, can see down into the valley where I’ll be heading tomorrow and ending up in the town of Dunncannon, PA.  I got here at 2pm and was the only one here for over an hour.  Then people kept coming until now there are 3 tenters, 2 in hammocks and 4 in the shelter.  Rather surprising the crowd here considering only seeing a few people all day on the trail.  None of tonight’s crew are going north further than tomorrow, most going south on short hikes.
One pasture I hiked through had a herd of cows.  One was only a few feet from the trail.  As I approached, she(thankfully it was a she) backed up just a few steps and we just eyed each other as I proceeded.  Went over several stiles at the edges of pastures.
The picture today should come with a caption “WTH, after literally thousands, if not tens of thousands of tripping hazards, they finally warn us”.
I timed my start this morning.  Had an alarm set for 6am.  Actually set out at 7:04am.  Not bad for all the necessary tasks of a primitive camping routine.
So into town tomorrow.  Have to determine my next resupply opportunity after that and plan what I’ll need to buy.  Will be my first clothes washing this trip...and they need it after the few warm, sweaty days earlier.  Achin out for now.","Backpackers Campsite, Boiling Springs, PA

An update from last night, a few late arrivals got the total up to 11 hikers & a dog.  Strange since the 3 previous evenings I was alone at a hostel and 2 lonely campsites in the woods.
Just outside of the town of Duncannon, PA tonight.  Need to launder my clothes for the first time, do a food resupply, get a shower, etc.  
Started hiking at 7am and arrived in town at 1pm after a 11.3 mile day.  Started out in the low 40’s and only got up to mid-50’s (very much to my liking). There was rain in the forecast; but fortunately, it did not begin until I was safely at The Doyle Hotel having a burger and a cold one.  The Doyle is a famous stop on the AT.  It was once a grand old hotel operated by Anheiser Busch.  Now it is a great place for food and drink; but, a horrible place to stay.  Concerns about safety, being a fire trap, roof leaking, being dirty and so on cause most hikers to go elsewhere for lodging.  I am at a Red Carpet Inn, not a highly rated place by any means.  But it got me a shower, ability to get my clothes washed and a ride from and back to downtown.  The AT runs through town here.
It was fun with a small crowd at the shelter last night.  It was a varied group with lots of typical campfire discussions.
There was a 6.2 mile section today that was quite rocky.  Not big ones needing hand hold climbing or sitting down and sliding.  Just tons of smaller ones to of varying shapes and sizes that demanded careful attention to where each step was placed.  Numerous times I stopped and gently reminded myself “slow and safe”.  In the AT world PA is known as “Rocksylvania”.  Unfortunately the worst is yet to come.
I scored a woman’s petite pair of sweat pants before leaving the Doyle from a hiker box.  Must have been a hefty petite woman that left them there.  Waist fits me fine but there more than a little short.  They allowed me(along with a pullover that I haven’t worn yet) to not get arrested as I did laundry of all my other clothes.  For those of you who are not aware many establishments that cater to hikers have a “hiker box”.  Hikers drop unwanted clothes, food or equipment in and other hikers are able to rummage through and take anything they want.
P.S.  As much as I like the look, I’ll be leaving the sweat pants here when I leave tomorrow.","Darlington Shelter, PA

Another dry, fun, hard productive day on the AT.  Hiked from 8:20am until about 4pm and did 11.0 miles.
Woke up before 5:00 and could not get back to sleep even in a motel bed.  Had pop tarts, planned my day, watched tv until my motel shuttle driver at 7:30.  He dropped me off at Duncannon’s only supermarket for resupply.  They had a deli so had a 2nd breakfast of ham & cheese on a Hawaiian bun while taking my new food supplies out of boxes to put into my food bag.
Was a significant climb out of Duncannon after crossing the Susquehanna River.  Took about 2 hours even though I did well at it(much better at the uphills vs previous years).  Hiked on top of a ridge line the rest of the day.  Some places were quite rocky with occasional nice smooth places.
Upon getting to the shelter there were 4 guys there already.  One was Marco I met in Harpers Ferry the night before my hike start.  The other 3 were PA folks out for just a 2 day hike(only 3 miles in from a trailhead parking area).  We all had lots of fun kidding around and swapping stories.  I did not get into my tent until 8:30 (way past my normal hiker mid/night) as the time passed so quickly.  Got to see a sunset for the first in a long time.  The only bad thing was that the water source(a piped spring) was way down there.  A sign says the path contained 300 stone steps...and I believe it did. 
Tomorrow looks like it will be my first day this trip to hike on the rain.  Supposed to start at 8am and last all day.  And it is 18 miles to the next shelter. May be a fun day.
Today’s pic is I believe to be 3 vultures sitting in a tree I walked by.  I could just hear them saying “hope he falls and we get to eat him”. Being up on the ridge line I saw birds all day riding the air currents around.","Red Carpet Inn, Duncannon,PA

Two milestones today:•Went over 100 miles for this hike.•A new high single mile day of 18.0 miles (a few times over the years I’d done 17+).
It is very unusual for shelters to be as far apart as they were today.  Knowing I was expecting a big day my alarm was set for 5:45.  Got all chores done and was hiking at 6:30.  The forecast was for rain most of the day.  So far this hike I avoided it; but, not today.
Had a climb of 1,000 feet this morning that was done in foggy conditions.  At the 9 mile point I put on my backpack rain-cover to assure all my belongings would stay dry.  Shortly afterwards a misty, drizzly day unfolded and continued throughout.  I never did put on my rain jacket as it was a warm day and if I did I’d be totally soaked with sweat anyway.  Surprisingly my shirt remained relatively dry from body heat.  My shoes and socks were a different matter and are quite wet.  After arriving at the shelter it has rained off and on so they will not be dry by morning.
The trail which was rocky most of the day soon had the element of frequent puddles.  At first they could be avoided; but ultimately, they became too frequent and sizable.
On the trail today met a couple (Bob & Cathy) from NC that probably will be seeing occasionally.  They are hiking northbound and have 2 vehicles.  They park one at their destination  and drive the other to where they’ll start hiking.  One is a small RV that they sleep in.  
It is only Marco(from Germany) and myself at the shelter.  We are planning to go into town tomorrow for chores, food and to share a motel room.
For the first time I do not have signal strong enough to upload this post or even check on tomorrow’s weather.
Today’s pic is the water source at this shelter.  A piped spring about 12 right in front of the shelter.  You can see the volume of water coming out of the white tube and falling into the trough.","Peters Mtn Shelter, PA

Consider today a “NERO”, in hiking terms meaning near a zero mileage day.  Only 6.1 miles done - just enough to get into town.
Had a strong thunderstorm over night as Marco and I lay safe and dry in the shelter.  Coupled with the rains from yesterday the creeks were fast, furious and swollen.  Shortly after leaving the shelter we came to the above signs.  Marco wanted to take the beaver dam route.  I resisted as I have somewhat a fear of crossing flowing waters.  So we parted ways.  Shortly afterwards I began having concerns about how well the alternative route may be marked.  Turns out it was well marked, mostly dry and easily reunited with the AT.
Later before I met up with Marco again I came across a stream crossing that was much to fast moving, wide and seemingly deep for my comfort.  It was within sight of a paved road bridge that the stream went under. Harking back to a similar experience last year, I bushwhacked along the stream until I found a way up to the road, walked the road back to where the AT crossed and was dry/safe.  (Remember that Rockdawg69?). Eventually I caught up to Marco and found he walked through an area about a foot deep with water for about a hundred yards at the beaver dam site. Glad I took my route.
We had big lunches at Burger King and will probably hit Wendy’s for dinner.  Have laundry in process as I write this.  Soon will plan next food resupply town and plan grocery buy for this afternoon.  This is a small town and probably gets most of its business (motels & fast food) from I-81 traffic and near by Fort Indian Town Gap army base.
Overnight was warm.  Started hiking in shorts and a short sleeve in comfort.  The AT crossed a PA highway about 2.5 miles from town.  Tried hitch hiking and thankfully got a ride within 10 minutes.  As we were dropped off in town and made our motel selection is was significantly cooler and very windy - quite chilly.","Rauschenberg Gap Shelter, PA

Before today’s info, something I forgot 2 days ago.  On the 18 mile day(last Sunday) it was the first shelter this hike without a bear box, bear pole or a bear bag pulley system.  Between rain showers I looked around for tree branches suitable for a bear bag hang.  Could not find any.  So for only one of a handful of times on all my AT nights, my food bag was within easy reach for Mr or Mrs Bear if they showed up.  Obviously I would have mentioned it sooner had a problem occurred.
As for today my 11.4 miles was done by 1:30pm after starting at 7:30.  Had breakfast at the motel, hitch hiked(only 5 minutes to obtain) the 2+ miles to the trailhead and was on my way.  Shortly thereafter I missed a trail turn as it went under I-81.  Lost about 30 minutes by the time I realized I hadn’t seen any white blazes and back tracked.
I had notes from my buddy Paul Bunions’ journal that today’s hike had the first of PA’s rock scrambles.  It did have 2 but they were not that bad verses the plethora of smaller rocks on the trail.  Just to even things out, there were several long sections of nice flat, smooth trail.  And unlike the past 2 days the trail was almost totally dry.
Was planning to stop at a shelter about 7 miles in for lunch.  But, somehow I missed seeing the sign for the side trail.  Thought it was taking a long time to get to it when a highway crossing appeared that was several miles beyond it.  A nice surprise.
Tonight’s shelter is one of the classics on the AT.  A totally enclosed building with 12 wooden bunks, a 10’ wide octagon sunroof,picnic table inside, comfortable chairs to sit in AND pizza can be ordered and delivered here since it is close to a highway.  Also due to that fact there is an on-site caretaker to help out and assure non hikers are not using it as a party place.
So far it is just Marco and I here.  Two high mileage north-bounders did pass me today and are going past this shelter.  Also saw Bob&Cathy from NC again today.
I was curious today while hiking how far it is to my home state of NJ.  Ironically when I looked it up it is exactly 100 miles from here.  Then it is another 64 miles to the nearest AT point to my hometown of Newfoundland, NJ.
Today’s pic is a glimpse of the inside of this fabulous shelter.  On the far wall in the lower bunk is my air mattress(yellow), sleeping bag(blue/green), various other items on the top bunk and my backpack hanging from the string.  In all shelters are the strings hanging from the ceiling with an inverted plastic bottle top or tin can.  This is to prevent mice from climbing down the string and getting into your pack.  It does not always work and hikers are smart to leave all zippers open to prevent the critters from chewing through.","Days Inn, Lickdale,PA

Another good day on the AT.  A cooler and overcast day that was good hiking weather.  Started out at 6:40 and completed 15.1 miles at 3:30.  Not much elevation changes today that should lead to quick hiking.  But the ongoing plethora of rocky trails make  a slower cautionary pace necessary.
Were a couple of nice views of wide valleys and beyond.  Basically we were on a top of a ridge line all day.
Had a slice of leftover pizza for breakfast along with my standard Carnation Instant Breakfast mixed with water.
Hiked with Marco a lot today.  We are joined tonight by 3 other north bounders we passed on the trail during the day.  A man from PA and 2 woman from England.
Today’s picture is showing how I have a small water bottle handy on the front of my backpack.  This is the first year for this.  I was always frustrated that whenever I wanted a drink I’d have to take my backpack off to get one of my 2 water bottles out from pockets in the sides. Then of course replace them, put the pack back on and adjust all the belts/straps again.  Time consuming, frustrating and a momentum breaker.  I have seen other hikers with bottles on the front but never investigated how they did it.  Shortly before this hike Wendy and I were discussing it.  She searched YouTube and found a guy who made his own device that would solve the problem.  I went online with REI found what I needed for about $5.  To make sure I get it on time I paid about $30 in total to have it shipped in 2 days.  The next day I got my backpack out to determine exactly where and how I’d make the attachment.  OMG, there was a built in strap already there that was made for what I wanted. Got a small size Gatorade and it tested out perfectly and has been a working out perfectly on this hike.  What a DUMMY I was to not have been using it all these years.  It is just one of the reasons I can get more miles per day this year than all others.  Makes me wonder what all those other straps are for on my backpack.","501 Shelter, PA

A going into town day- always good!Started at 6:40 this morning and arrived in Port Clinton, PA about 12:30- another NERO of 9.0 miles. Had lunch in the Port Clinton Hotel after not being able to locate Marco who was ahead of me.  Then visited The Port Clinton Barber Shop.  Did not need or get a haircut.  But my AT Guide book said it was a very hiker friendly place.  And so it was.  As I walked in the owner stopped cutting a mans hair and gave me a short tour of free snacks, the restroom, lounge area and asked me sign their hiker book.  As I was led to believe someone there offered to drive me to Hamburg, PA about 2 miles away and a much larger town. And there I met up with Marco again.  Tomorrow we part ways as he is hiking on and I am taking my first zero day.
Both of my hiking poles now have the metal tip broken off.  Guess that is due to the rocky trail of late.  And I need one to hold up my tent at the opening.  Last night I borrowed one of Marco’s.
Here in Hamburg is the worlds largest Cabelas store.  Walked over this afternoon and checked it out, fantastic. They did not handle the brand of poles I have and upon looking at mine further discovered that one is now worn down more than just the metal tip.  Came back to the motel and compared new hiking poles on REI’s website.  So tomorrow is back to Cabelas for new hiking sticks and some other miscellaneous items.
Today’s trail was a combination of some nice trail, many sections of rocky trail, a few rock fields and lastly very steep near 1,000 foot drop into town.  But all in all, not that bad.  
Treated Marco to dinner at Cracker Barrel as our last day together ends.  He had never had one of my favorites (at least in my over-weight days) of  Chicken Fried Steak with white gravy.  A big hit for that heavy eating/drinking German. Will miss his company.
Today’s picture is a typical trail of late.  Really have to watch where your are stepping.  And that is not yet what rock fields look like where you seldom touch ground, stepping from one large rock to the next.  “Rocksylvania” for sure!","Eagles Nest shelter, PA

My first ZERO of this hike (i.e. no miles hiked).
Said goodbye to Marco Hollmuller this morning. He is young(27 years less than me) and eager to get many miles done before his return to Germany.  We were together at Cabela’s yesterday and I overheard him say to a salesperson “yes, me and my father over there” and pointing to me.  We laughed over that several times later in the day.
By 10am today I had all my in town chores done which included walking visits to Walmart and my 2nd trip to Cabelas.  Besides food I acquired new hiking poles and shoes laces.  One holiday item was a solid chocolate bunny to have today as an early Easter treat.  Didn’t think I’d have a bunny in the woods, especially a chocolate one.
Watching the Weather Channel this morning it looks to be a fortunate decision to lay low today.  This afternoon and overnight have a high percentage of lots of rain, high winds and potential flooding.  Still rain projected in the days ahead but more of the light rain variety.  Either way more muddy trail are sure to be ahead.
I really want to express “SINCERE THANKS” to those of you who have left messages on my trail journal.  On long days of hiking it is so nice to hear from you to brighten up my day.  FYI, I get an automatic Email with the message on my phone(as soon as I take it off of “airplane mode”) to Dave battery life.
Pretty sure the 2 woman hikers from England are here in the same motel.  Marco saw them last night in his evening  bar visit.  Hoped to see them today to have dinner together and see if they had plans for a ride back to the trail tomorrow.  But never saw them all day and of course the desk clerk couldn’t tell me what room they were in.  So, dinner all alone, so sad.
Late update, after my dinner I met one of the 2 English ladies in the lobby.  Ended up sitting and talking with them as they at dinner.  Fun discussions.

Started hiking today at 6:15am knowing the weather was an issue, had to do nearly 15 miles, had an almost 1,000 foot elevation gain early and who knows how rocky it will be.
It was drizzling as I tried to hitchhike back to Port Clinton.  No so lucky today as I ended up walking all the way to the trail.  Until about 1:30 it remained foggy and misty with occasional light showers.  Then the sun came out turning into a nice afternoon.  Hopefully my clothes will dry as I have them hanging out on a clothesline.
There is a young, hippie looking guy at the hostel who I see is packing a revolver in a holster and also has a hatchet with him, strange.
Being wet and rainy, I never sat down today until reaching the hostel at about 3pm.  Took a few short stand up breaks with the pack off consuming trail mix and water with Propel added.
There were 2 noted vista’s today(with quite rocky ascents) being Pulpit Rock and the Pinnacle. However, all I saw was a cloud at each.
My cousin Mary from AZ asked a few questions.  Do I hike with 2 poles?  All the time?  Use them for protection or carry?Yes, I always hike with 2 poles although in easy terrain I sometimes carry them with the tips up to avoid having to constantly lift and place down with each step.  Could use them for protection from small animals; but never had a need to yet.  And no I do not carry any weapon except my 1.5” pocket knife.
Today’s pic is the shelter tonight.  It’s unusual in that is right on a public road and on the property of a residence - who is the caretaker of the shelter.  It is small with only 6 bunks.  Unfortunately being the 4th to arrive I have an upper bunk.  Another quirk is that there is a flush toilet in the privy.","Microtel Inn Hamburg,PA

Happy Easter to everyone from the woods of PA.  
A tale of 2 different days today.  Was planning on a 17 mile day today.  After the first half full of rocks( both consistently on the trail and several significant rock scrambles) and a significant elevation climb, I cut back my expectations.  Then suddenly the trail turned into several quite long sections of smooth much less rocky terrain.  But my mind was made up for a shorter day especially since coming up soon is a place called “Knifes Edge” that my buddy Paul Bunion said he stowed his hiking poles to use hand holds going through.  Did not want to hit that when being tired.
Staying at a camping area with a good water source.  Two guys from PA who were at the same shelter last night plus 2 new ones I met this afternoon are here as well.  Glad I was the first one here at 3pm because good tent sites are sparse.....too rocky. Also nice to have chores done and watch others doing there’s.
Met another German hiker today, real nice guy named Captain.  He went on the the shelter I was planning on reaching.

Started out first out of camp this morning at 6:40am.  Never saw the other 4 guys until 2 of them arrived at the hostel.  I’m not the slowest old fart anymore.  It was a cool(probably upper 40’s) and remained nice the rest of the day.  Completed hiking at 2:10pm.
The highlight of the day was a place called the “knifes edge”.  The picture above does not do it justice.  It was a long, treacherous rock scramble with large flat stones upright at angles. A place where you had to carefully pick foot placements and sometimes hand holds with significant step up’s and downs.  As I told Wendy on the phone today, I used to dread such sections but now find them exhilarating and a challenge.  A new attitude.
There were numerous other rock scrambles during the day.  And as is now common in “Rocksylvania” , rocks very frequently on the trail with occasional nice stretches .  Makes for slow going and tiresome due to the required attention to detail.
Wendy is going to cringe that I post this, but here goes.  For those of you my age that remember the existence of pay toilets in gas stations and stores, you’ll probably remember the jingle “here I sit broken hearted, paid my dime & only farted”.  Based upon my experience today I’ve got a new one.  “Here I squat full of woe, dug my cat hole and couldn’t go”.
First snake sighting today.  Was not a copperhead or rattler.  So was a harmless one.
I’ve showered, completed a minimal food resupply and will be going out to dinner with Eric and Jay the 2 other hikers here. 
Tomorrow may be a long day.  A well know steep and rocky assent (meant for mountain goats, not hikers) out of here and over 15 miles to the next shelter.  And sparse water sources.","New Tripoli Campsite

Wow!  What a day!
15.6 miles does not sound impressive.  But if you could have experienced them you might change your mind.  Had breakfast at Bert’s (same place that runs the hostel).  The waitress (Tracey) that opened the place at 7am is also the shuttle driver.  She got us to the trail head at 8:30.  Right out of the box is a seriously steep climb of about 1,000 feet.  Numerous places required using hand grips on rocks and leg strength to boost yourself up to the next rock level.  I found it very intense and at the same time exhilarating.  Was quite proud of myself in maintaining concentration and a good attitude of seeing it as a challenge. There were several other rock scrambles that were similar today but not as intense.
It was a warm day today.  Would have liked to start out much earlier to avoid some of the heat.  Besides the exertion of the climbs and quite rocky trails often, a lack of water sources was a concern.  I started out with my max of about 2.5 liters not sure if it would be enough.  Fortunately there was an unplanned source that was sure nice to allow proper hydration until reaching the shelter.  All day long I added Propel to my water and ate Gaterade chews to maintain electrolytes.  I have to be careful because I perspire so much.
The mountain climbed early today was on the boundary a SuperFund site for toxic levels of Zinc sludge.  Read about it last night.  Over the course of 70 years (ended about 1930) they dumped over an area 2.5 miles long, 50 feet high and 50 to 100 feet wide.  Hikers are cautioned not to drink water from that area.","Bert’s Hostel, Palmerton PA

A little bit shorter day today at 13.7 miles; but, still physically and mentally taxing.  I think today had the least amount of smooth, non-rocky sections of any day thus far.  There was one incline of about 600 feet at mid-morning that was a snap.  However most of the day was a rock strewn mess.  That makes the day a long one with having to be so careful all the time.  There was one rock scramble called “Wolf Rocks” that I enjoyed stepping/jumping between big rocks high on a ledge.  Just like on the big climb yesterday, the AT has an alternate bad weather side trail that goes around the area.  Glad I did not take the easy option either time.  But, I can sure understand how dangerous they would be in wet weather.  I am surprised myself how I am enjoying them.
In the AT Guide I and most hikers use for trail info says the shelter here has a faucet that is turned off in the winter.  Much to my surprise it is not turned on even though I consider it well past winter.  I arrived with very little water counting on the faucet.  There was a southbound hiker here when I arrived.  He told me that near the shelter there was a communications tower crew that gave him 3 bottles of water.  I went over and they also gave me 3 bottles.  When the southbounder left I asked him to alert the 2 hikers behind me so they could fill up at a spring about a mile back. Then I called the Appalachian Trail Headquarters in Harpers Ferry to make sure they knew of the problem for the benefit of future hikers coming through.
The 2 hikers behind me are Pilgrim and Mosey(both fromPA) who I’ve been seeing for several recent nights.  Since I was ahead of them I decided to play a little trick on them.  At a remote road crossing I left the 2 M&M’s (in photo) in a place where they couldn’t miss them.  When they get here I’ll tell them it was a gift for friends.  Awhile later I also left a single M&M that they’d be sure to see.  I’ll tell them that was s test of the friendship between them.
A few comments from yesterday that I missed mentioning in my journal.  At the shelter last night we were talking about the big, dangerous climb out of Palmerton.The general consensus was that if you fell you would be like the ball in a pin/ball machine bouncing around all over the place.  
Also forgot to mention going over the 200 mile mark for this hike.
Also the last 2 days I’ve averaged only about 1.6 mph.  Walking on smooth non-steep inclines I can count on between 2 to 3 mph.  These conditions are not conducive to short days and/or big miles.","Leroy Smith Shelter, PA

Another NERO getting into the town of Delaware Water Gap, PA about 10:20 am.  Staying at The Church of the Mountain Center. It is like a hiker hostel run by a local church that only asks for a suggested donation of $3 per night.  A free shower, several good eating places, a nice place to sleep and the trail goes right through town.  However food resupply is limited to gas station convenience store junk food.
Pilgrim & Mosey are with me again.  We’ll do dinner together tonight.  They are a fun  duo who are staying another day here since their families are coming in for a visit.  We may very well see each other again as we’re all headed north.
Early tomorrow I’ll enter my home state of NJ.  Then it will be about 6 days to reach the nearest point to my home town and a day or two off the trail.
The last week or so PA has been like a lion with millions of rocks.  The last day it went out like a lamb with an easy trail down into town.  
Since I have time to kill today, a 20 day recap.  I am pleasantly happy with my results thus far.  I’m averaging over eleven miles a day (verses 8.8 on all my other hikes) without exhaustion experienced on previous hikes.  Uphills are no longer dreaded.  The difficult rock scrambles have been challenging and actually fun.  Am having fun meeting other hikers and in several cases having multiple day interactions.  All is well-including my body and mind.
To what is this attributed?  Well, being more than 50 pounds lighter and physically stronger has to be the biggest factor.  However there are a few others.  Using an inflatable mattress in allowing me to sleep much better.  Also I am eating more and healthier when in towns(less burgers and pizza, more salads, etc).
Again thanks to all who are leaving messages on my journal.  Love your questions, comments and encouragement.

The great state of NJ did not throw out the welcome mat for one of it’s native sons.  Started out at 6:40am and at 7:02 crossed the state line over the Delaware River from PA into NJ.  It was a long, but gradual climb out of the gap back up to the mountain ridge level.  At 9am just as I approached Sunfish Pond(a 41 acre, glacially created lake), it started to rain.  Soon thunder made its arrival as well as occasional strong winds driving the rain.  The thunder stopped soon; but, the wind and rain continued on and off until I stopped hiking at 12:40.
The rocky conditions did not suddenly cease at the state line.  Even though there were no big rock scrambles, the trail was still often strewn with copious quantities of rocks.  This made hiking harder in that it was not safe to step on any angled wet rocks and risk slipping.  So, it was slow and steady going.
It got a little chilly wearing shorts, tee shirt and rain jacket.  Had to keep moving to avoid getting cold.  I stopped a little short of today’s goal when reaching the Mohican Outdoor Center, a woodland resort type place.  Scored a private cabin for the price of a bunk in the bunk house.  They didn’t say why and I didn’t ask.  So now I’m in dry clothes, had some hot Roman noodles and an comfy in my sleeping bag.

A big day!!!  My previous biggest AT mileage day was 18.0 miles back on 4/14.  That was significantly eclipsed by a whopping 20.6 miles today.  And it wasn’t all that bad, although I was glad when the turn off sign for the shelter appeared.
Started hiking the AT at 6:30am after a half mile from last nights cabin back to the trail.  Got to this shelter at 5:30pm.  It was a cool start and remained cool most of the day( no shorts today).  That was especially true when very strong gusty winds were coming up the ridge lines.  
Some nice panoramic vistas today.  From one I could see the tall monument at High Point State Park which was about 30 miles away.  I will reach that at the end of tomorrow’s hike.
The picture is a nice flowering bush right on the trail.  Trees are just starting to bud out at the higher elevations.  Looking forward to the natural sun screen of leaves when temps start rising.  Speaking of temps, going to be in the 30’s tonight and thankfully the winds are suppose to die down.  And calling for rain tomorrow, yikes!

A relatively easy day today.  Did 11.3 miles in rainy conditions.  Believe it was about 39 degrees ay 7:30am when I started out.  It never rained hard, mostly a drizzle off and on all day.  Only drawback was being enough rain to not be able to step on many rocks(due to potential slip hazards).  There were some rock scrambles but not up to PA standards.
For the first time this trip wore gloves for awhile until it warmed up a bit.  And never took the rain jacket off all day.
Passed two young guys going south to get to their car leaving a knee injured friend resting at a shelter.  Later at the shelter found their friend sleeping.  He awoke while I was snacking/watering up.  Talked for a bit making sure he was okay and moved on.
I’m staying at a hostel that picks you up at High Point State Park, NJ. The hostel called “Mosey’s Place” is actually in Port Jervis, NY.  Very good hostel run by a mature single woman.  Clean clothes, showered, food resupplied and a dinner run accomplished.  I remember this area from my youth as having dark black soil and a large onion growing area.  Understand onions are no longer a big crop here and much is being converted to growing hemp.

One day closer to my home town which I’ll reach tomorrow.  But as for today it was a good hiking day, cool and sunny.  Did 14.1 miles of mostly nice trails.  There were several long stretches today over marshy area where you walked on boards.
Early in the day the trail led near the 220 foot tall High Point Monument which was built from 1928 thru 1930.  It sits on a site with an elevation of 1803 foot. That is todays picture.
At the shelter tonight there are 5 people, all inside.  That’s due to the expectation of heavy rains over night.  Two of them are a man my age and his adult daughter both from NJ.  I caught up to them on the trail this morning and we went into Unionville, NY for lunch at a great deli.  The other couple are probably about 30ish from NYC.  All are nice.
Had a brand new experience this afternoon called “turtleing”.  It was near the end of the day and  going uphill.  I saw another couple coming down.  So I sat on a fallen tree at trails edge to let them by.  Just as they arrived I slipped over backwards.  So I’m lying on my back with pack on, legs sticking up in the air over the tree trunk. Could not get up..like  a turtle turned over on it’s back.  The man helped pull me back up.  How embarrassing is that?","Mosey’s Place Hostel, Port Jervis,NY

Made it to my home town 12 miles off the AT.  My cousin Buster and wife Julie picked me up from Waywayanda State Park about 3:30.  On the way to their home was like a trip down memory lane.  At first nothing looked familiar.  As we got closer I recognized more and more.  Places and things that brought back memories long forgotten.  It has been almost 50 years since I lived here. Only a few short visits since then.
Today’s hike took longer than I expected.  Near the end was a nearly 1,000 foot, quite rocky climb, called “the stairway to heaven”.  Called that I guess because of the big climb and that near the end are a series of large stone stepping stones. Ran into a couple of guys I met days ago at Mohican Outdoor Center that were coming down it.  My question to them was, “does this thing really go all way to heaven?”.
Earlier in the day was the Jersey boardwalk ( not the one most people think of).  It is in the picture and is nearly a mile long over swampy grounds.  Occasionally it widens to allow rest/ passing opportunities.  There were many other sections today with the common 2 board wide wooden passes over wet areas.

Finally back on the trail.  Forgot to mention yesterday that at the shelter last night were: Wolf(Germany), Stripes and  Levi - all new meets.
Those 3 plus 5 others are here tonight.  Including Pilgrim, Mosey and Captain that I’ve met previously.  Also here is Lightfoot (from Michigan) who I was expecting to run into after knowing about him from Trail Journals before I left home.  Also Popeye from Va.
Today’s 11.6 miles was definitely not easy.  When the AT Guide indicates caution that this area is more difficult than the elevation profile indicates, you know to expect the worst.  There were 3 areas where there were bad weather alternative routes.  I, of course, choose the official AT routes even though the rock climbs were wet from it being a misty day.  It was a challenging day to say the least.  Many times used hand holds on rocks to make to up and down.  Did slip on a large, sloping rock causing a laceration on one elbow.  It is OK, just a little blood. Was up high many times but clouding misty conditions did not allow any vista’s.  So other than self-satisfaction, no rewards for such hard work.
One bright spot today was Belleville Creamery.  Large hot fudge sundae. Yum!

It was not the best of days....but in the end was interesting.
Hiked for 11 hours today and it was tough, quite tough.  At first I thought NY had turned easy with nice smooth trails. Then it showed it’s vengeance again with numerous tough rock climbs.  Unfortunately they were wet and slippery causing a couple of falls.  No injuries other than more scrapes on legs and arms.  There was one section I deemed impossible in the wet conditions and took an alternate blue blazed option which itself was no picnic.
One notable feature is a rock formation called “The Lemon Squeezer”.  It is a very tilted, narrow slit between rock walls.  Was impossible to make it through with a pack on. So I went through once to deposit my hiking poles up there. Then came back down and pushed my pack ahead of me and later carried it above my head to make it through.  The picture is someone else coming down while I waited my turn.
Late afternoon I reached my targeted shelter.  As I was going down the side trail to it, I SAW MY FIRST BLACK BEAR from about 35 yards away.  Saw it had something in its mouth.  I made it down to the shelter and found it had just stolen food from a Boy Scouts pack.  There was a group of about 30 scouts and leaders planning on spending the night.  The leaders came over to me and said the bear had been hanging around the shelter and they were leaving.  Leaving me alone, I decided to move on too.  On the side trail back to the AT I saw the bear again.  It just sat there and watched me and appeared to be eating something.  We both kept an eye on each other until I got out of there.
So now I’m stealth camping a little over a mile away.  Made sure all food and wrappers are out of my tent and that my bear bag hang is a good one.  
Six of the 8 from last night went into town tonight.  And Pilgrim and Mosey are camping somewhere ahead of me,
After my 2nd fall today(which damaged one of my new hiking poles), I had my first thoughts of “why am I doing this?”  As the sun finally came out to dry most of the slippery rock and the bear incident, I’m feeling better.","Wildcat Shelter? NY

Rained through the night as I was snug on my tent with no one else near by.  It adds to the morning routine to get ready, pack up and stow the tent in the rain...thankfully a light rain.  The rain/mist persisted all day so I was a cold, soaked puppy carrying excess weight due to wet gear.  
The shelter I’m at has a view of the NYC skyline.  However all that can be seen today is clouds.  Maybe it will be clear by morning as the rain is supposed to stop overnight.  Today’s pic is that view.
Another day of having to hike carefully.  Added to the lately normal wet, slippery rocks were lots of puddles where the trail should be.  I am a dirty and smelly mess right now and my shoes are soaked.
The trail crossed the Palisades Parkway today. I walked the .8 mile round trip to a Visitors Center in the median.  Spent some time there charging my phone, having a snack, etc.

A good mood inducing day today.  Weather was nice, trails/rocks were dryer and had good food twice.
Did leave the shelter with plenty of wet, heavy items including shoes, tent, clothes and food bag.  The shoes dried out during the day as did the clothes I was wearing.  Items inside my bag did not.
There was a big climb up the south side of Bear Mountain.  Trail maintainers did a tremendous job in placing hundreds of stone steps rather than the rock scrambles. A reward at the top was a great(although quite expensive) lunch at The Bear Mountain Inn.  Then the trail went down the north side of the mountain.  Again with hundreds of even easier stone steps on a smooth gravel walkway.  It fed right into the zoo at Bear Mountain. There in was my 2nd bear sighting within a few days (only this one was in a cage).  
Just before my stopping point for tonight was a 24 hour deli/store.  Had a pint of Cherrie Garcia ice cream there and a good hoggie sandwich to go.  While there saw the 2 girls from France I met the night of the bear sighting who also had the same experience and moved on to tent as I did.
Staying tonight in a camping area owned by the Graymoor Spiritual Center, an order of Friars.  Has a tenting area in a ballfield, a pavilion with power to recharge phones, a water faucet and porta-potties. Two guys and two college age girls from France here too.  One of the guys built a fire which I used to dry out clothes.  My tent dried on its own after being set up.  However no shower and dry but smelly clothes still need attention somewhere soon.

A kind of ho-hum day today.  Nothing really special about the hike.  No great views.  Weather was nice and did meet a few nice people on the trail...including Bob & Cathy again from NC.  It was slow hiking again due to mostly rocky trail. I was hoping to do 19 miles to a shelter; but, not enough time to make it considering the conditions.
Never saw the people from last nights camp except for the southbound short section hiker.  I caught up to him about 20 minutes into my hike.  He had no idea he was going the wrong way.
As I type this I’m laying in my tent with a rainstorm going on.  It is relaxing hearing the rain drops and wind and I can feel the lowering temperatures.  Bad thing is as I saw the storm clouds moving in there was only time to grab a protein bar out of my bear bag before hoisting it up and rushing under cover.
I was concerned about my tent and worried about it all day.  This morning when trying to get out, the zipper was stuck and took me awhile to get it open.  Tonight it seems to be working just fine again.
Forgot to mention yesterday that I went over the 1400 mile mark of the AT.  At present I’m only 33 miles from entering CT.

A good day on the AT.  Both the trail conditions and weather were nice.  Least rocky day in some time.
I made a real blunder however. Had my mind set on a deli for lunch only a half mile off trail.  Looking forward to it so much that I got off at a road before the correct one.  After walking for well over a half mile I asked a local how to get to the deli.  He said take that road over there....and it’s about a mile or so.  WHAT?  Then I got my ATGuide out and realized what I’d done. Then used my phone and called up a map to make sure.  Went ahead and continued on the wrong roads to the deli.  Lightfoot & Popeye who were sitting outside at the deli say “why are you coming from that direction, find a short cut?”  My reply “yes, some short cut that was.”  
After getting my food and sitting outside eating a car pulls in the parking lot.  The 2 French girls get out of it.  They had camped not far from where I was last night.  But this morning they went south instead of north for quite awhile before realizing it.  They then got a Uber to bring them up to about where they should have been by midday.
At this shelter tonight are a man from Long Island, NY and two older women from N.H.  One woman in the shelter and the rest of us tenting.
The problem I mentioned yesterday with my tent zipper that I thought was resolved is not. And now it is a much bigger concern.  When you pull the zipper handle it flows smoothly; but, the two pieces of mesh fabric do NOT attach together.  So now there is a big open gap through which any insects can get through.  The bugs are not bad yet.  I guess I’ll see how it works out the next few days.

It was a beautiful day for hiking.  Had 10.9 miles done by “noonish” when I pulled off the trail to get to a motel for a zero day tomorrow.  Trail surface was the nicest, smooth path I can remember having in quite awhile.  Coupled with a near empty food bag I felt like I was flying.
I’m in a fly by night type motel in Wingate,NY.  There was a parking trailhead at US22 just past the AT Rail Depot (shown in picture).  As I arrived a car was just pulling in to park.  I simply walked over to it and asked the driver if he would be interested in giving a hiker a ride to town.  I offered to pay he; but, he graciously offered a ride of about 4 miles.  A nice young man was on his lunch break and we had a nice conversion during the short ride.  Great Trail Magic!
From the AT Rail Depot you can ride to NYC for $22. Really do not know how the train knows to stop.  Since I was not interested, did not check it out.
It has been 8 days since my clothes or body have been cleaned.  Was about time for both.  This motel has a washing machine; but, not a dryer.  My clothes are hanging on a clothes line out back.  It is a cloudy day so I was concerned. But there is also a good breeze that is helping out.  Ultimately most items dried.  The wool socks and shirt were still damp.  They are now draped over lamps inside my room.
On my zero tomorrow I’ll walk about a mile or more to a grocery store.  Otherwise probably hole up and rest.","Morgan Steward Shelter, NY

By 9:30 this morning had all my walking chores done.  That included a 1.5 hour walk to a gas station convenience store, a very small grocery and the same deli I visited last night.  Acquired an adequate amount of 4-5 days of hiking foods plus deli salad/sandwich and drinks for lunch & dinner tonight.  Wanted to get this done before today’s/tonights projected rains.  Even bought a NY Times to pass some of today’s time.  My next resupply will be in Salisbury, CT.
On my walk I saw a pair of hiking shoes tossed over a power line above the road(today’s pic). I guess it was the end of the line for some hiker.  Speaking of which I am starting to consider the end of my hike.   Currently thinking of finishing off NY, CT and Massachusetts and going home.  In that plan, I could visit my 2014 hiking buddy Paul Bunion who lives in MA and think could make travel arrangements home from there.  Could change my mind as the miles pass by, just current feeling.
When at home I join a small group of former co-workers from BAE Systems about once a month for lunch on Friday’s. I suggested via Email that they call me today since I was holed up in a motel room.  Had a fun call with Eddie, Cindy, Martin and Bargie today.  Glad they called and always fun to get caught up and hear their voices again.
I am about 4 miles from the AT at this motel.  Was unsure if I’d have to walk to it in the morning.  Hitch hiking is illegal in NY state.  Talked the motel manager into driving me over in the morning.
Been kind of a long day sitting around motel room.  However I may have solved my tent zipper issue.  There was a video on the TarpTent web site explaining what to do.  With the help of a borrowed pair of pliers and lip balm on the zipper teeth the fix was done.  Will see how it works in the woods soon.  For now a relief of mind.","Dutches Motor Lodge, Wingate, NY

Two milestones today: 0.  Went over the 400 mile mark for this years hike. 0. Went past the 2/3 mile mark of the entire AT which is 1461 miles.Weather was perfect today.  Cool temps reaching only in the low 60’s with a slight breeze and the deepest blue sky.  The deep blue sky showing through the budding green trees was quite picturesque.
With the first part of the days trail near perfect, I was flying.  Before noon(after 4.5 hours) I had already booked 10 miles.  Then the trail again turned rocky and ran into a nearly 1,000 elevation gain.  So the last 8 miles took about 6 hours.  Oh well, still had a big day.....and you have to take what the trail gives you.
At the shelter tonight are Wolf and Stripes who I’ve met before.  Also 2 young men out for a few days and way up on a nearby hill are about a dozen seemingly college age guys and gals.  I and all others except Wolf are tenting.  The shelter just had a new metal roof installed earlier today.
My tent zipper is working perfectly.  Sure am glad I saw the video about how to fix it.
Met a young couple at a scenic vista today.  In the conversion I mentioned being from Aiken.  The guy went to USCA and graduated from there. Was familiar with Hitchcock Woods.  Small world.
Suppose to start raining over night and well into tomorrow.  Several additional days also indicate rain likely.  Hopefully it will be if the light, low accumulation variety.

An IMPRESSIVE day of hiking..... 0.3 miles(i.e. about 10 minutes).
Rained most of the night.  Not a hard rain; but a steady one.  After a big day yesterday and being cold and rainy it was hard to pull myself out of my cozy sleeping bag.  This was especially reinforced by looking at the forecast of 3 days of rain and a projected low tonight of 38 degrees.  First plan was to hike in the rain 7 miles to the next shelter.
When I finally got moving and stowed all except my soaked tent in my backpack I carried it over to under the canopy of the shelter.  Then went to the metal bear box and retrieved my food bag.  After awhile got up the gumption to go out in the rain and take down/stow my tent.  The next few moments changed my day.  Was eating breakfast in the shelter along with Wolf(from Germany).  He mentioned he had a reservation in Salisbury(about 30 miles ahead) and the owner also did shuttles.  We hatched a plan to move his reservation up to today, me joining him and get a shuttle ride there.  A quick call and we were to be picked up in about 30 minutes.  We rushed to complete getting ready and get to the road crossing quickly.  Although we ended up waiting for an additional half hour in the rain, we eventually arrived safely, albeit cold and wet.
Now afternoon and we are showered,clothes in the dryer, and laying in our bunks under covers to stay warm.  Vanessa(the homeowner/hostel owner) has invited us to join her and her family in a Mother’s Day spaghetti dinner this evening.  We will gladly partake.  When I say hostel, it is really a bunk room in her home with access to bath and kitchen.
Wolf is going to stay here 5 nights and then get a shuttle to the Hartford airport for his previously planned flight home.  I am playing it by ear.  My timing of getting a ride back to our road crossing pick up point will depend on the weather forecast and it does not look good.
Now evening and another hiker showed up from Maine.  He took an upstairs room to himself.  We all gouged on pasta with meatballs and sausage, salad, bread and dessert cake.

In addition to Wolf and I, 3 others showed up this afternoon that we had camped with previously.  The are Lightfoot, Popeye and Captain.

Left the hostel at 6am and reached the trailhead and started hiking at 7am.  The forecast was for showers beginning mid-afternoon.  But they held off until about 6pm, so I had a dry day all day. And will stay dry over night by not tenting.
Of the 5 hikers in the hostel last night, I was the only one that hiked today.  Wolf is just relaxing until his flight home to Germany on Friday.  Lightfoot, Captain and Popeye decided to zero  due to the expectation of rain coupled with a difficult rocky section laying in wait for them. I too will be facing that in a few days.
Sharing the shelter tonight with a young man named Liam.  He is a brand new ATC Trail Runner for the CT trail.  In his position he interacts with hikers to teach “Leave no trace” principles, report on problems with the trail/shelters, etc.
Energy levels were good today after 2 days of rest.  And the hiking was not to bad leading to a good number of miles, 17.  It was cool(to my liking) and overcast all day.

Something I forgot to mention yesterday.  The 17.0 mile day did not include about a 3/4 mile detour.  There was a high water road route around Guinea Creek that was swollen from recent rains that most(and certainly me) considered too dangerous to ford.
Today was a wonderful day for hiking.  Cool as in the 40/50 degree range, partly sunny skies and no rain.  The trail was much more enjoyable with far fewer rocks and pretty forest land scenery.
Walked on several miles of flat, smooth trail along the Housatonic River.  It is an impressive sized river, although I know it is significantly above normal levels due to lots of recent rains.  At Falls Village, CT is an huge multilevel waterfall that was amazing to witness. See today’s picture.

Achin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613618,"All good things come to an end! Today’s picture is the end of the trail for me.  Where the trail goes on a short section of Route 44 going into Salisbury,CT it makes a right turn.  I did not make that turn, instead walked straight into Salisbury.  Today’s picture depicts that.  Below the Salisbury sign you can see the double white AT blazes on the telephone pole.  The upper one indicating a right turn.
I’ve felt for a long time that I would not(possibly could not) complete the whole AT.  The going gets much tougher going north especially in NH and Maine.  Although handling the tough rock climbs and steep, rocky descents in recent states, I have no real desire to challenge the ones on steroids coming ahead.  Also to this point I have never had to ford a stream doing more than just getting my feet wet.  The fact that challenging deeper fords are coming up quite frankly strikes fear in me.  Crossing moving water is not my thing.  I’ve endured numerous falls in rocky areas on this hike and feel very fortunate to have escaped with only minor scrapes and bruises.
There is a saying on the trail to never quit on a bad day.  I have done this in the past and later regretted it. Not this time.  I’ve had two consecutive good, enjoyable and high mileage days with good weather.  
So, I am going home.  Not directly.  My long time friend (Jeff, aka Paul Bunion) from the first night on Springer Mountain, GA is driving down from Worchester, Massachusetts.  He’ll pick me up this afternoon.  Will probably spent a day or two with him and his wife Deb.  Then I’ll be departing for home most likely on AMTRAK.
Did a lot of thinking while hiking the last few days.  My main objectives for this hike were threefold.  
 0. To prove to myself that after some serious health issues in recent years, that I could still handle the physical exertion levels required of a long distance hike.  I was quite happy with performance of a much leaner and stronger body. DONE 0. To reach my home town of Newfoundland, NJ.  And while there visit my parents graves, visit the few remaining relatives there and just reminisce.  DONE 0. To reach Massachusetts and visit Jeff who I met the first night of 3/19/14 on Springer Mountain, GA.  We have not seen each other since 4/27/14 when we hiked together for several weeks covering GA, NC and part of TN.  Yesterday I came to the conclusion that I do not have to complete MA to see Jeff.  His drive to get me is no farther here than to the end point of MA.  At this point I am just 6.6 miles from entering MA.  So, I consider this goal done too.
So, in conclusion I definitely feel that this hike has met my objectives and been enjoyable.  As always the trail has provided challenges, rewards, new friendships, fantastic views and new experiences.  I will always think back on this and other hikes with so many fantastic memories.  And of course, none of it would have been possible without the agreement and support of my 48 year long wife Wendy.  She is a keeper!  Maybe a cruise for our 50th.

A good first day.  Started out at 7:20am and arrived at this shelter at about 3:30pm.  Was bundled up well to start out in 35 degree temps. Did not take long to shed my buff and unbutton my outer shirt.  Was quite a nice day actually with mild temps, light breeze and partly cloudy.
Had not been hiking for more than 10 minutes when I saw the first pair of deer.  A few minutes later saw a good sized buck....all at close range.  Then nothing but squirrels and birds thereafter.
Probably have seen about 80 people today, about 12 of which are in or around the shelter tonight.  Not unusual for a lot of day hikers on week-end days here.  I’m in the shelter since there is a high chance of rain overnight and into the morning.  Four of the people I saw were trail maintainers on a break.  Thanked them for their service and we talked for probably 20 minutes.  Another person of note was a young female Park Ranger from the Pittsburg area who graduated from Slippery Rock College.  She was impressed I knew of it.
The woods are still mostly filled with green leaves.  There are small amounts of yellow/gold appearing. But nothing spectacular yet.  One puzzle is today’s picture.  Looked down on the trail and saw this beautiful red leaf.  Looked all around and did not see any trees it came from.  Strange!
For tomorrow:  A little warmer starting temperature; but, rain.  Miles will be slightly less. And the opportunity to have a warm meal at Elkwallow Wayside(a little store/cafe run by the park service).
Thought on this tripI I’ll give a glimpse into my food choices daily.  Today breakfast was at the Mountain Home Cabbin consisting of scrambled eggs with ham, fruit toast an OJ.  Lunch(in the woods)was a packet of Spam with Triscuts, some potato chips, some trail mix and an almond snickers bar.

Not the best of days for hiking.  There was no signal available at the shelter but we knew there was a strong front moving through sometime today.  The one thing all seemed to agree on hearing was that it not arrive until 10am or later.
Of the 4 people at the shelter, Quill and another had short walks to their vehicles- no problem for them. Another girl((Woods) decided to spend all day at the shelter-no problem for her.  But as for me I had miles to make and a schedule to keep.  So I started out at about 9:00 all rain gear in use and hoping for the best. Was fine for about two hours and then light rain started- not bad.  At about 11:30 I made it to Big Meadows Wayside.  About the last 15 minutes was driving rain, strong gusts and significantly cooler.  I had trouble seeing the big sign on Skyland Drive at it’s entrance site.
Spent 2 hours at the Wayside having lunch, charging phone, comparing trail knowledge with 2 young female hikers and deciding whether to go on or not today.  There was no signal at the Wayside to check on weather conditions.  Could have got a room at the Big Meadows Lodge and tried for a 20 plus day tomorrow or hike on.  Ultimately I decided I’m a good enough hiker to do this.  So I packed up, put on all rain gear and took off. As the 2 girl hikers told me the trail was nice going to this shelter; however, it did pour rain for about half an hour.  Then tapered off and ultimately stopped before reaching my destination at about 4:45pm.
Have been itching to get in my tent for the first time this trip.  However the available sites were lousy.  So, I am in the shelter again with a girl from Washington DC and 2 guys in hammocks near by.

Was scant opportunities for picture taking today.  Today’s picture is a typical water source at shelters.  A pipe buried to an underground water source and empting into a pool.  Sometimes there is a good strong, constant flow to fillip your bottle in seconds.  It has been a dry summer so the flow is much less now.  At tonights shelter there is barely a flow at all- just a pool seeping up out of the ground.

It was a gorgeous hiking day. Temperatures from 40ish at start to low 60’s for a high.  Sunny, blue skies and light breezes.  Could not ask for better.
Started out a little after 8, waiting as long as I could put off switching from my warm sleeping long johns to cold and clamy hiking garb.  I was only .75 miles from Lewis Campgrounds and had to wait for them to open at 9am.  Was worth it as 2 hours later I was clean from a luxurious hot shower and wearing clean and dry clothing.  Talk about being in heaven.
Took lots of pictures today as leaves have begun turning and they were bathed in sunlight.  Unfortunately this web sight only allows 1 picture per daily entry.  The one I choose today is from a lookout on Hightop Mountain(elev 3530’) that shows over a wide panoramic view leaves are mostly still green.
Only saw 5 multi day hikers today.  And about a dozen day hikers.  It is nearly 7pm as I write this and I am alone at this shelter.
Not really hiking until about 11am it took longer than I planned to get here.  Unfortunately right near the end was the biggest climb of about 1200 feet.  I personally like to get the big climbs out of the way early. But, you have to go where the trail leads.
The area I’m in now is know to be dry, especially this year.  I’ve checked the piped spring at this shelter and there is absolutely no water coming out of the pipe.  There is a small pool still there that I can probably use a cup to dip a liter bottle full in the morning.  I am good for tonight and breakfast with what I carried in today.  For any new readers, I treat all my water found in the wild using a Steripen.  It is battery powered and uses ultraviolet light to kill any harmful organisms.

It was a planned short mileage day to reach the next shelter (would have been over 20 miles to skip over it and catch the next one).  So I did not rush getting started; nor, did I push hard to get here.  Just a nice slow pace stopping often to just take in the beauty/forest sounds or snap a picture.  From shelter to shelter was 8:30 to 1:30.  Even took a side trail to a park ranger station for water supply and my lunch break.
Changing leaves although still mostly yellow are becoming more frequent.  And seeing small amounts of red and orange mixed in.  Still the prevailing color is plain old green.
Saw about 8 other hikers today.  I think 3 were multi-day persons.  Two guys who I met several days ago, I saw twice today.  After seeing them the first time, they reached one of their cars,  drove further south and hiked north again to their other vehicle.
Have been concerned about water availability; but, seems like it is going to work out fine.  Yesterday I filled a bottle from a boxed spring that was stagnant( had little frogs in it too) and this morning from a piped spring with no flow but a shallow standing pool below it.  If necessary I would have used either after treating it.  However I ended up dumping them out when I was able to fill all 3 of my bottles at the ranger station out of a pump.  Better safe than sorry.  Midday tomorrow I’ll make it to Loft Mountain Wayside where I can again fill all 3 bottles.  And the two remaining shelters after that are suppose to have flowing springs(although slow flows).
I had only been here about 10 minutes relaxing when a pickup truck drives up on an fire road.  It was a park ranger and his assistant/intern.  Just making a routine stop to clean the privy and check on the status of everything.  We had a nice long talk.  Later 3 more hikers showed up, all long distance, experienced ones. One from Austria(35 year old) who has hiked all over the world amassing 12,000 miles.  Another completed the entire AT earlier this year.

Another nice day for hiking-cool, slight breeze and partially overcast.  Got started at 8am and by 10:30 was at Loft Mountain Wayside having breakfast.  About an hour later was at Loft Mountain campstore doing a small resupply and another snack.  
Probably saw about 10 serious hikers today.  Three of them were thru-hikers having started in Maine on their way to Georgia.  Saw about 20 others day hikers today.
Today’s miles were respectable; but, seemed relatively easy.  Even with the stops and multiple discussions with other hikers and tourists I made it here by 5pm.  Only two people here and they are friends who are primarily care doctors, both about my age.  We’ve had quite interesting discussions over a wide range of issues.

Last big day of my southbound hike.  Only 7.7 miles into Waynesboro and a hostel tomorrow.  Today was overcast all day with just a few minutes of drizzle.  Temps ranged from mid 40’s to lower 60’s.  Actually a good day for hiking and I felt pumped.  Like an energizer bunny.
There are 6 of us at the shelter tonight.  The same 2 doctors as last night and others.  Probably saw about 20 others.
You know I’ve been concerned about water sources on the later part of this hike.  Today was the closest call.  Had plenty of water for this day; but little left for tomorrow.  When I got to this shelters piped spring I had 2 bottles to fill. The pipe was literally just dripping with an occasional little spurt.  It took 16 minutes to fill my 2 bottles.  Had to sit on the ground and hold the bottles under the drips and move them quickly to catch the occasional spurt that would have overshot to bottle opening.
Need to tell you how smart I am and the new plan I‘ve come up with.  Just wait a minute!!!   If I was really that smart I would have come up with it to start with.  Anyway, instead of taking 9 more days to hike back to my car in Front Royal over the same path I just did (and also covered in 2016), I’ll get a ride back up there.  And then use the extra days to drive down Skyland Drive within the park and do day hikes to scenic attractions that are not on the AT.  And can spend nights in various campgrounds.  And probably get home a few days sooner.  BRILLIANT.
Suppose to start raining about 9pm and into tomorrow afternoon.  So my last hiking day will be a wet one.  Oh well, there is a hostel waiting for me to once again get clean and dry.  And daughter Tracey and family are meeting me for dinner in Waynesboro.","Blackrock Shelter

Forecasted overnight rain was suppose to start around 9pm.  Got up to pee at mid-night and it had not started.  Generated hope that it would all miss us.  Oh but it did not!  Lots of rain overnight.  Pre-hike radar check looked like a strong band of showers coming that would not last long and then clearing.  That is exactly how it played out.  Unfortunately I was hiking when the strong band hit and it was intense for awhile.  So, I got soaked including shoes and socks from sloshing through the small rivers that are usually trail.
This section of trail was quite a bit rockier than SNP had been.  Had to be careful on wet, slippery rocks.  Made it through just fine and exited the woods into the edges of Waynesboro about 11:15am into sunny skies. Had a hot dog and fries at a roadside stand while waiting for shuttle driver from the hostel.
So my southbound part of this hike is over.  Feel like I did quite well.  Averaged 12.5 miles per day.  That is better than any of my other hikes.  Except for 3 (out of 9) days being rainy it was an enjoyable experience.  Paths are sweet for the most part, met many nice people as I usually do and got to spend lots of time on my own out in splendid nature.  
Tonight my daughter Tracey, husband Jason and grandkids Jack and Kate are driving over to take me out to dinner.  They live about 40 minutes away from here.
Also want to thank those who left messages on my journal: Tracey, Kokopelli, cousin Mary, George from Pickleball and RockDawg. Always good out in the woods to hear from family and friends.
Plans are still being made.  I do expect to get back to my car in Front Royal tomorrow staying at the hostel that is holding it tomorrow night.  Then begin a few days drive down Skyline Drive in SNP taking day hikes to interesting places.  So stay tuned for future posts.,

Achin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624474,"Fall Hike Day 10Today started out early.  Up at 5, caught shuttle ride at 6 and arrived at hostel in Front Royal at 8am.   After a quick visit with hostel personnel , took off to drive down Skyland Drive.  Stopped in the SNP Visitors Center to get data on hikes.  There are 10 listed hikes within SNP that go to waterfalls.  Due to it being a very dry season only 2 of them have flowing water.  So I hiked to all active waterfalls today.  They were Whiteoak Canyon (4.6 mile hike) and Dark Hallow(1.4 miles).  Both were impressive at 90 &70 feet tall even with small flows of water going over them.  Sure was nice to be carrying a bottle of water vs a 30+ pound backpack.  Both falls had lots of tourists visiting them.  To get to them I traveled just about half way down Skyland Drive(50 miles)  which I retraced back up to Front Royal to the hostel. But not before a big lunch at Skyland Resort.  Was really full from Broccoli soup, Turkey Pot Pie, Cole Slaw and a huge serving of Blackberry Ice Cream Pie(how was I to know it was meant for sharing?)
Spent this evening investigating more day hikes.  Have a few identified for tomorrow.  Will probably tent in a campground tomorrow night or possibly rent a small cabin since Wednesday is a possible rainout day.  At this point just planning day to day until I decide to go home.

Left Mountain Home B&B,hostel after breakfast this morning.  A nice morning starting out.  I had a few planned short hikes to explore while driving southward in SNP.  First one was about 30 miles down the road.  On the way to it, I was thoroughly enhanced with the quality of vivid autumn trees.  Yesterday and today were right at peak season and purely lovely to behold.  I had talked with the hostel owners at breakfast about how much better the viewing is while driving down Skyland Drive vs hiking in the woods.  We all agreed about that.  First of all you cover about 30 miles per hour in the car and the sun has the clearing along the road to filter sunlight down along the way.  While hiking you are below the leaf canopies seeing mostly the shaded undersides of the leaves.  And you only cover 2 to 3 miles per hour.
Anyway after about half an hour of beautiful scenic driving, suddenly ran into a fog bank.  For about half an hour after that was lucky to see taillights in front of you- no less any trees.  Then suddenly again it was bright and sunny.  Stayed that way the rest of the day.  
Did about a 2.6 mile round trip up to Mary’s Rock.  Fantastic panoramic views with fog banks in low lying valleys.  A good portion of the walk was on the AT with the final quarter mile or so on an uphill side trail.  In 2016 and again this year I passed by that side trail on days I was pushing for AT miles.  So glad I went back to it today.
The 2nd hike was also about 2 miles round trip, little more of a climb.  It was up to Hawksbill Summit.  Again lots of people.  At the top was a day use pavilion and a observation deck.  It was several hours later; but, still were some fog banks in lower areas.
Decided not to do the slow going bottom third of Skyland Drive(max speed limit of 35mph).  Got out of the park and made it to Lynchburg, VA for the night in a motel.  So after getting cleaned up I convert from a hiker back to a normal civilian.  Why Lynchburg?  That’s a discussion for tomorrow’s journal.  That’s what’s known as a teaser.
Today’s picture is just after driving out of the foggy conditions at the one and only tunnel on Skyland Drive.  The 2 guys in vests were from the Virginia Tourism Dept.  probably taking pictures and videos for promotional purposes.","Mountain Home Cabbin

No hiking today, continued on my trek home.  But first, all morning was spent in Lynchburg, VA.  I’m on a mission of goodwill for a fellow hiker.  As you may recall in my last shelter stay before getting to Waynesboro, I shared a shelter for a 2nd night with two doctors.  I saw them a again during that day on the trail before they reached their cars to head home.  Apparently unknown to all of us at that time, the one from Lynchburg accidentally left his watch in the shelter.  
I became aware of this later at the hostel when another hiker(the last one to depart that morning) found the watch on the floor of the shelter.  From where it was located I am surmising it was the Lynchburg doctors.  Not knowing his last name at all...and not sure of his first name, I am still attempting to locate him as it seems to be an expensive watch.  I am now in possession of it, hopefully on only a temporary basis.
All I know for sure is that he is a Primary Care physician in Lynchburg.  And of course his approximate age and physical characteristics.  So I’ve done lots of google searches, review of web sites and review of doctors photo’s that I could find.  No matches found there.  So this morning I drove to the administration offices of the largest physician association in the area.  They were not helpful at all and showed little interest in helping.  Next I went to the one large hospital in the city.  Started at their Human Resources Dept hoping to review a book/file of primary care doctors pictures associated with the hospital.  No such luck; although they were genuinely interested in helping.  They referred me to the Security Force back at the hospital it self.  There I also found helpful people.  A computer resource did a query and found 800+ doctors associated with the hospital.  Too many to review.  So, they suggested I give them my contact info and they would send a broadcast message to all those doctors asking if any had lost a watch in SNP recently.  If they get a hit, they will put us in touch with each other.
Separately, I emailed the maker of the watch since I found what appears to be a serial number it.  Another possibility of finding the owner.  On their site they encourage new owners to register their purchase.
Not thinking I could do anything else here other than make random, needle in a hay stack cold calls,I left town this afternoon.  Drove part way home in rainy conditions.  Decided not to go all the way tonight.  So in another motel in Rockingham, NC. Did not make good time due to taking non-interstate highways.  
Will make it home sometime tomorrow.  Will be doing one more journal entry as a recap after I get home.","

Made it home about 10am on the final leg of my adventure.  I am pleased with my fall hiking experience.  Was strong and energetic in putting in a little over 100 miles on the AT through out the length of the Shenandoah National Park.  I averaged slightly more than 12 miles per hiking day.
Other than 3 days when it rained, it was very nice hiking weather and saw some of the best scenery possible.  As always on my hikes, met many quite nice people sharing the woods with me...and even ran into an old hiking friend(Quill).  
As always Wendy was supportive of me having my time away from home and keeping everything on the up and up here.  
It is good to be home again and I am eager to get back into the normal routines once again.
Nothing new today on finding the owner of the found watch.  Will give it a little time and possibly try making a few more contacts.
So, I sign out for this year and share one last photo of cherished fall scenery from SNP.
