Kibs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610828,"Yesterday, my hiker bud Herb,and I decided to make a dash for Waynesboro, 25 miles south of us.With nasty weather approaching and running out of food, we really didn’t have a choice but to find the nearest town. Now, reaching Waynesboro, we will re-supply and wait out the approaching storms. Plan to head back out Sat AM. Several other hikers are hunkering down with us at Stanimals Hostel. A pretty bustling place this morning. With the smell of huge pancakes on the griddle and lots of coffee, we will awake to face another day !!","

Kibs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612067,"Well, I totally get Virginia state slogan. Virginia is for lovers and truly an incredible land of scenic wonder!! We just finished hiking thru one of the most beautiful and unbelievable sections; Shenandoah Valley. Every turn, crest of mountain, or mountaintop vista would just totally blow you away. This area has to be one of the most beautiful sections on the entire trail. While Hiking through the month of April, flowers of every color imaginable are bursting out in the race to capture as much light before the lush green canopy of leaves begins to emerge. The trail has literally transformed itself from winters death to an amazing outcropping of rich, vivid colors in just a matter of days. The new canopy of leaves is a welcome sight for hikers on the AT. Temperatures rose to over 80 degrees with one hiker reporting a near bout with heatstroke!","
","Troutville, Va","May 01, Wed",10
Kibs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613074,"So not to confuse anyone, I left the trail in Troutville,Va last week and did a “leapfrog” whereby taking an Amtrak train south to the traditional Southern start point at Springer Mountain, Ga. The move will help divert away from the large group of northbound hikers I was about to encounter. Thus avoiding overcrowded campsites, the dreaded, and highly contagious, Norovirus! The leapfrog will also help avoid the intense Georgia heat. From Springer, I will hike back north to Troutville, Va then another Amtrak ride to get back to Bennington, Vt to finish the northeast states and eventually summit Mt Katahdin mid to late August!
So now, I’ve hiked north to Franklin, NC. I’m off the trail again to avoid another large storm headed here tonight & to dry out and do laundry. I plan to leave tomorrow back to the trail-Cheers!!","

Kibs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614881,"Well, I made it through the Smokey Mountains. Was a bit gnarly with many steep accents and high temperatures! It was tough hiking but made it through in 10 days. Was less than 10 feet from a from a mama Bear and her cub eating berries. They were not as impressed with me and pretty much ignored me. By the time I got my camera, they were out of range? Made it to the summit of Max Patch mountain just south of Hot Springs. It was the beginning of Memorial Day weekend. The weather was glorious and I camped out for the evening. There was a wedding taking place during a spectacular sunset. Many other people from the wedding also camped here with a sky full of constellations that was totally awesome!!! The next day, hiking towards Hot Springs I videotaped a three foot black snake sunning himself in the trail! Hopefully, I will find out how to compress the file so I can show everyone. He was a beauty!! Last, but not least, I videotaped one of the most beautiful of waterfalls that I’ve seen while hiking this year!
I am now in Hot Springs, and waiting to meet my lovely bride, Donna in Asheville tomorrow. I plan to hitchhike the 50 miles east of here early tomorrow. What an experience this hike has become! I hope to inspire others to seek out their adventures and coexist with nature. I’m really grateful to be able to experience this hike and the profound impact it has already made on me.","

Kibs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615176,"Donna flew in Thursday night  in to Asheville. I hitch hiked here earlier in the morning from the Trailhead at Hot Springs. Only took 20 minutes to get a ride with one of the working class on his way to Asheville! We have enjoyed our stay here. It is foreign to Me having clean beds, not having to protect my food from Bears, running water out of a faucet you don’t have to filter or boil!! Asheville has plenty of things to do and tons of microbreweries!!  Today we are planning a microbrew tour that are all within MSD (minimal staggering distance)?
The locals are very friendly and the eateries outstanding!! We are having a blast. Although, being off the trail has been nice, it tends to make you “soft” Thank goodness the temperatures are cooling a little so I will hitch a ride back to Hot Springs next Tues to resume my NOBO trek to lovers leap and destinations northward.","

Kibs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616436,"Well, it was a matter of time before getting totally mauled by the Appalachian weather!! Last Monday I arrived in Erwin, Tennessee looking like a drowned rat! We experienced monsoon like rain that held up for 4 days straight. I ended up with multiple equipment failures including cell phone, leaking tent, wet sleeping bag, and a prosthetic arm in locked position. Things are finally back to normal today and need to make tracks if I plan to summit Mt Katahdin this summer!! Thank you everyone for your continued support!!Adios, kibs","

Kibs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617139,"My daily mileage has dropped somewhat in the last 3 weeks due to a variety of circumstances. Bad weather seems to be the biggest problem. Along with temps in the upper 50’s lower 60’s we had torrential rain that made hiking much more treacherous not to mention the toll it took on my gear!Leaking tent made everything miserable. With wet clothing and sleeping bag, you are at risk of hypothermia without warm dry clothing. On top of that, rain ruined my cell phone and without a cell,I had no navigation app!Through all the “suck” I still remain focused.","

Kibs,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618531,"My hiking buddy, Mike Bell and I reached an old Fire Wardens cabin to dry out our gear after getting caught in a heavy down pour. I normally hang up my prosthetic arm along with all my other wet gear to dry out. I was amused when a couple hours later, another hiker shows up. He quickly notices my arm missing and asks me - “Do you wear a special pack when you hike?” I replied no, I use nothing special when I hike other than a helmet to protect my head!  Interesting to me, Most people I encounter while on the trail first notice the helmet and ask why I wear it-not noticing my prosthesis.","My hiking buddy, Mike Bell and I reached an old Fire Wardens cabin to dry out our gear after getting caught in a heavy down pour.
