Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606212,"I rarely make formal resolutions at the start of a new year. 2019 is an exception of sorts. This idea to hike all of the Appalachian Trail has been an aspiration of mine for many years, but this is the first year I have resolved to tackle it. And it is the first time I've made my plan public to family and friends. Beginning in March I will section it, probably in 100 mile chunks (+/-) over the next few years. So there it is.. a resolution written down at the crack of this new year. NOBO in March. First section starts at Springer. I took this photo a couple of months ago on a hike about an hour south of the trail. Springer looks like a blue wave on the horizon. Excitement and trepidation in equal measures. Gearing up!",,Sawnee Mountain,"Jan 04, Fri",5
Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606261,"In October we spent a week in Acadia National Park. What a spectacle of crayola box color--yes, the maple leaves and birches but also technicolor mushrooms, green mosses, the slate blue ocean and rosy skies at sunset, the holly berries, lichen splattered pink granite balds, deep scarlet blueberry leaves against white deer moss. Lush tarn shorelines and boulder strewn narrows taken out of Tolkien's Middle Earth. We woke early every day, packed up a hiker's lunch and climbed a new mountain: Pemetic, Cadillac, Beech, The Bubbles, Dorr, The Anvil. Drunk on beauty at day's end we'd stumble back into town feeling lucky and achey with the good sort of misery that says your body has been working hard. On one of those blue clear days atop a mountain facing west you could see all the way to Baxter State Park. Katahdin loomed on the horizon like a whale surfacing from the sea, the largest thing visible. We haven't yet met face to face, Katahdin and me. There are a lot of mountains to climb first, and a few mountains that have to be moved to begin the trek.",,Acadia National Park,"Jan 05, Sat",0
Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606310,"When Emma Gatewood was 67 years old she ran away from her home in Ohio wearing a pair of Keds sneakers and began hiking the Appalachian Trail NOBO in Georgia. The year was 1955 and she became the first woman to ""thru hike"" all 2100+ miles in one season. She had been inspired by an article in National Geographic about Earl Shaffer who was the first thru hiker after returning from WWII. Emma went on to thru hike it two more times, the last time a section hike in 1969. This trivia about ages and dates only matters because I turned 56 in November. Thinking more about age and endurance these days. For my birthday we went camping at my favorite state park, Cloudland Canyon, and spent the weekend taking beautiful hikes along the rim and through the gulch to see every waterfall. It had been rainy so they were full of thunder, plunging over the ledges, pounding into the pools, churning through the gorge as if a dam had broken upstream. Chattanooga is less than a half hour away so cocktails and dinner at St. John's restaurant made for a most perfect birthday celebration. Yeah, I'll be a decade younger than Grandma Gatewood when I begin my first big section of the AT. My pack will likely be 20 pounds heavier than the homemade gunny sack she carried on one shoulder stuffed with little more than a blanket, a flashlight, some raisins and peanuts, and a shower curtain to keep the rain off. So lighter pack goals because age is not the biggest barrier to finishing the AT but an overstuffed pack probably is!",,Cloudland Canyon,"Jan 08, Tue",0
Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606385,"Fifteen years is a long life for a dog but not nearly long enough for a good dog. We got Pinder one afternoon in spring when my sons were ten and twelve. We had been dog-less for some years because I was reluctant to add puppy training on top of my kid training duties. But in 2004 we found a blonde 4 month old lab mix pup at a parking lot showcase put on by a local dog rescue organization and my boys fell in love with him. I'd sort of hoped they'd fall in love with a housebroken adult dog but he won them over with his playful energy and frequent kisses. This new pup went straight from the parking lot to his first little league baseball game that day. He spent a lot of time at baseball games and ultimate meets and family gatherings. And as the boys grew up and away, he became mostly my dog and spent more time on hiking trails. He loved them as much as I did, maybe more because the trails told him richer and more layered stories than I could understand. He heard or smelled every dog, every squirrel, every deer, every human, everything that had walked our path before us. When he stopped to snuffle under the leaves we joked that he'd stopped to check his ""pee-mail."" He  lived to get in a car and go on an adventure, run a trail, track a scent, see something different, stand on a high place and look out at the world like he owned it. He also lived for food: the tidbits left on a plate, the drippings on the dishwasher door, the crumbs dropped on the floor, a snack left unattended in front of the TV. 
On Friday the trail finally ended for him. His appetite never wavered but his body failed him in a way that made him confused and feeble. We helped him leave us gently with his dignity intact, laying peacefully in his own bed in the living room, his pack-mate beside him with her paws over his, our hands on his head, whispering in his ears what a good boy he was. We'll miss him so much. I'll miss my trail dog and constant companion of fifteen years. There wasn't enough time, not enough trails with him. Pinder was such a good good dog. Maybe I'll put his tags on my pack and bring him along on one more long trail.",,Chattahoochee Recreation Area,"Jan 13, Sun",0
Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606557,"Between the holidays and a couple of outdoor store sales I've accumulated a lot of new gear. I'm trying to keep my general base weight below 18 pounds and finally had the chance to pack it up and get it weighed. Divided into categories:
Pack: Osprey Aura AG 50 with rain cover (Not the lightest pack but I'm an organization nut and I like pockets. Plus it is comfy.)
Tent: Marmot Tungsten 2P UL (because my husband will be hiking along sometimes so I'll take a little extra weight for flexibility) my footprint is tyvek.
Sleep System: Enlightened Equipment 10 degree bag. (Will switch it out later for a lighter bag.) Thermarest neo air xlite pad. Cheapo small inflatable travel pillow with removable fleece cover (purchased at drug store.) Black diamond down throw for extra warmth (may be overkill.)
Kitchen: MSR Pocket Rocket with fuel canister and stabilizer tripod, good old Stanley Adventure cookpot (without the cups), DIY reflectix pot cozy, lightweight no-brand coffee cup and rubbermaid storage bowl with lid, Snow Peak long handle titanium spoon, mini lighter. I'm still tweaking this system. Kind family gifted me with two other cooking pot options during the holidays so I might switch out the Stanley.

Other stuff: Zpacks Bear Bag kit (may switch to bear canister eventually), stuff sacks, Street Cat headlamp, Foxelli carbon cork quick lock poles, Sawyer Squeeze water filter, SmartWater bottle, Bogler aluminum mini-spade (love this design- found on ETSY,) medical kit, toiletries, bandana, phone chargers and cables and an old ipod shuffle with music, DIY butt pad (yes it has a chicken on it.) A few more odds and ends including a Garmin inReach because my family insists.
It's amazing how much you can shove in a turtle shell! I'm pleased that my base weight came to just 16 pounds. My total weight with food, water, and clothes should ideally stay below 30 pounds using the 20% of body weight rule but I really want to keep it a lot lower. Planning a weekend backpacking trip to do a shakedown of the final gear list. It will be chilly but sunny and clear. 
Hey, a special thanks to everyone who offered kind words about my dog, Pinder. Our little family misses him. Our other dog, Grace, still goes out and paws at the leaves where he spent his last outdoor time before we carried him inside to wait for the vet. Gracie spends a few moments laying on his bed everyday but never sleeps on it. The cat and Gracie are figuring out a new relationship without him as the mediator. Time moves forward. Rain refreshes the trail and makes it new again.",,Somewhere in Atlanta,"Jan 23, Wed",0
Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606599,"Early NOBO hikers usually leave from the trailhead at Springer Mountain in late February or early March with hopes of reaching Maine before things freeze over and make summiting Katahdin difficult or impossible. That start date here in Georgia runs along the cusp of Spring, sometimes bouncing back and forth between warm weather and unexpected ice storms. Our unpredictable weather often spoils early blooming flowers and at times an early hike. Yesterday I took advantage of a sunny day and drove north with my pack. I thought I'd hike a section of the AT that crosses over Richard B Russell Hwy: the trail up to Wolf Laurel Top at Tesnatee Gap. The photos I took are a stark reminder that even on a sunny day the terrain and conditions on a mountain can be hard to gauge. Both photos are from the same day, taken within fifteen minutes of one another on the same mountain, but on different sides of it and at slightly different elevations. Tesnatee Gap was frozen over with a temp of 24 degrees and gusting winds that made it feel like the mid teens. Steep frozen trails made things even more treacherous. But a fifteen minute drive back around the mountain to Raven Cliff Falls revealed windless, ice free trails (though muddy from all the rain we've had) and a balmy 35 F. So for all of you with an early start date, plan carefully. It does get very cold here on the regular. Some days you can even hike from winter into spring in a single afternoon.",,Tesnatee Gap and Raven Cliff Falls,"Jan 25, Fri",0
Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606695,"The Appalachian Trail runs 2180 miles from north Georgia into Maine, but the Appalachian mountain range dips a bit farther south and west into Alabama. I really wanted to do a gear check but also hoped to avoid the frozen trails I found along the AT last weekend, so I joined a small group of 5 other hikers who are members of the GA Appalachian Trail Club. We met up at FDR State Park in Pine Mountain, GA not far from Warm Springs where President Roosevelt had his ""Little White House"" near the therapeutic pools of naturally warm spring water that flow from underground. The park is in the southern foothills of the Appalachians just above central Georgia's flatlands. High on one ruffle of land is this view from Dowdell's Knob, a favorite of FDR's for picnics and quiet contemplation. The area is about a 3ish mile hike from Molly Hugger parking area and it is a lovely place to have lunch. It can be reached by car so there are picnic tables but no other facilities. Our group put in another 3+ miles before we reached our final campsite at Big Oak. It has a nice raised fire circle of large stones, lots of level tent site choices under the trees, and a clean flowing water source a hundred feet or so downhill. Two barred owls called out above us all night, the stars were brilliant, and the temp a crisp 34 at night then up into the 50s during the day for the hike out. All my equipment performed as I'd hoped so now it's just a waiting game until my official start. There may be time for another weekend pre-hike on the Alabama side of the Appalachians, maybe a section of the Pinhoti Trail which covers the mountains from Alabama into Georgia and hooks into the Benton MacKaye Trial that leads to Springer. So many trails, so little time.",,FDR State Park,"Jan 29, Tue",0
Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607356,"Oh how nice to be roused by the morning sun and not a clap of thunder or the drumbeat of rain! Being deprived of trail days has been dispiriting and frustrating. I've lived vicariously through the journals of those who've started the AT this month. I won't say I envy the days and nights battling severe storms and biting cold, but I tip my hiking pole to everyone mucking along soggy trails in sodden boots. You are hearty souls.
But on this new day of blue skies I wanted to be out there with you, so off I drove and arrived at Neel Gap with my light pack and dry boots. I crossed the road and started south toward Blood Mountain shelter. It's a climb up some steep rooty dirt paths, mud bogged low areas, up stairways of uneven rock steps, through laurel tangles and across granite balds. The first clear area stops you in your tracks on a day like today. Rolling waves of multi-hued blue as far as the eye can see. Way out there at the horizon's southern edge is a spiky little patch that is the city of Atlanta. My home, a city that sprouted up in the foothills of Appalachia with many an old foundation set with granite from these mountains.
As I climbed/squished up the trail I ran into 8 or 10 thru hikers on their way to Mountain Crossings. Most had been on the trail 3 days or so depending on zeros for weather. I ran into Rocket and Hot Mess with a friend who has no trail name yet. An Aussie lady with no trail name and another young woman with a very full pack who asked about need for bear canisters in NC. And another with a pink beanie who is from Athens and shared that Justus Creek is very high and must be crossed on a narrow slippery log. 
Everyone seemed to be in high spirits with the great weather today. At the old stone shelter up top I stopped to gobble down a snack but the gusting wind was very cold so I headed back down pretty quickly. The shelter's interior smells of wood smoke even though the fireplace has long been filled in. Its back room windows are covered in blue tarps to baffle the cross gusts at night. A scout troop was descending as I climbed so I'm guessing this was their overnight accommodations. One of them had left behind a damp ball cap in the front room. This shelter has no bunks so sleeping on the stone floor is probably very chilly. And I imagine the sudden snapping of the tarps as wind sucked them in and out of the window openings like a bellows all night would be unnerving. All the AT Thru hikers I met were planning to stop at Mountain Crossings or the Blood Mountain Cabins at Neel Gap rather than shelter in the historic stone cabin up top. 
My up and back clocked in at around 8+ miles, which included a side trip down the Byron Herbert Reece blue blazed trail to check out the tumbling waterfall you could hear from the intersection. Drove home fully trail-satiated for the moment but so eager to begin the entire GA section in March. And hoping to hum ""Blue Skies"" everyday I'm on the trail. Added a few photos of the conditions and one video.",,Neel Gap to Blood Mountain,"Feb 24, Sun",8
Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607990,"Call it a very soft start. One official mile on the AT so far, but six miles of hiking today. First: there are two ways to access the summit of Springer Mountain where the trail officially begins. Most NOBO hikers begin at the Amicalola Falls visitor center and take the blue blazed approach trail up from the parking lot. I've hiked the approach trail many many times as a day hiker or weekender. It's nearly all uphill and a good introduction to what lies ahead. Along that 8.8 miles you'll pass a few tent sites and then see Black Gap Shelter--the first standing structure on the trail (if you don't count the shelter right beside the visitor's center.) Climb a bit more and you reach the summit to see the first white blaze of the 165,000 blazes that will mark this trail from Springer all the way to Mount Katahdin in Maine. A mile beyond the first blaze is a gravel parking area where you can leave a car for 14 days. This lot is the second way to access the beginning of the trail but it requires you to hike SOBO for a mile and then double-back to begin the NOBO journey. NOBO purists feel you have to begin with the full blue blazed approach trail and others think because the blue blazes don't count as part of the AT it doesn't matter. As they say, ""Hike your own hike"" or ""you do you.""
Back to the math of this first official piece of trail. I've been torn about whether to begin at the visitor's center and retrace the blue trail that I've done many times or begin closer to the top to give me more time to complete the GA section. On Sunday the decision fell into place. My son came in from Philly to visit and it seemed like a good day for a hike so we zipped up to the mountains from Atlanta. We took the dirt FS road up to the Springer parking area, left the car there and hiked a mile to the first blaze then down some more to Black Gap shelter for a total of around 3 miles. Light drizzle pushed us inside for lunch. Another hiker from Pittsburg had a small fire going in the stone ring when we got there. Tom, the ridge runner for this section of trail, appeared soon after we did. I really appreciate his efforts to keep the trash in check and be a shelter caretaker/advisor for early NOBO hikers. Already he'd collected a giant black bag of garbage folks had left. (Pack out your own trash, people!) Several other newbie thru hikers joined us to wait out the drizzle. Tom entertained us with bear tales while we ate. The rain slacked off and we jumped back on the trail to retrace our path back up to that first blaze then the parking area--but now going NOBO. So I'll count that as my first official trail mile. Next Monday hubby (trail name Ukester) and I will shuttle from the lodge to the parking area and keep going NOBO until he has to get off in Suches. Then I'll continue without him to get most of Georgia during this first section hike.
One mile completed so far, but I got to take all of those steps with my son along so it was a very sweet mile indeed. Yay!","Springer Parking Area

Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608421,"What a beautiful day to begin a big adventure. Blue skies, mostly dry trails, friendly people along the way. We began with a shuttle up to the Springer lot where we left off last week. Traveled to the 5.4 mark and stopped for lunch at a cross trail with the Benton MacKaye where Long Creek tumbles over a rock outcropping into a pool 20ft below. It felt strange to take off my pack, my feet seemed like they might lift right off the ground with each step. Odd sensation almost like being in space. We continued up and over to Hawk Mountain shelter at mile 8.1 where we are overnighting with several other hikers. Some are from the US (Virginia, Florida, Massachusetts, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, N Carolina) but also The UK, Scotland, Germany, Australia, India. Around the campfire our international friends spoke with reverence of the great unspoiled places in this country. And how lucky we are to have such trails and places at the edges of our backyards. As we watched a campfire (hiker TV) with our trailmates, we did feel lucky to be in the midst of it all and among people who love it like we do. Hiker midnight..8pm Time for bed.

Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608459,"Endured a very chilly night with temps inside the tent dipping to 24. My 10 degree bag kept me warm enough but Ukester‘s 20 degree bag didn’t keep him comfortable. This morning at breakfast one couple said they had ice form inside their tent due to poor ventilation and condensation on the tent walls. I slept with my water filter to keep it from freezing. After breakfast we pushed north toward Gooch Gap shelter at mile 15.7. In between our two points is Sassafras Mountain. To climb it you climb Hawk awhile then descend into Hightower Gap, then climb again to another ridge and down into Horse Gap. As you descend you notice a taller peak in the distance that has the shape of soft serve ice cream with a curl on top. Ukester said he hoped the trail would bypass it but that wasn’t the theme of the day. Up up we trudged with each switchback leading to new climbing. Finally the step path down into Cooper Gap where there was a cross road with a few trekkers waiting for shuttles off the trail. Ukester said he was tempted but he decided to push on to Gooch. More climbing through lovely laurel tunnels and along Justus Creek, past a campsite named The Devils Kitchen. We faced another cold night with Ukester‘s insufficient bag so made a decision not to stop at Gooch shelter but continue another mile up then down into Gooch Gap. All in all we traveled almost 9 miles and climbed 2900 feet. Shuttle driver Gary from Wolf Pen hostel picked us up,  drove us to Dahlonega, and dropped us at the Quality Inn (clean and near the square.) Ukester says this was the most difficult physical work he has ever done. (It gets harder from here.) Tomorrow he travels to The Big Ears Fest in Knoxville and I return to the trail. There’s always gonna be another mountain. Ain’t about what’s on the other side. It’s the climb.","Hawk Mountain Shelter

Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608484,"The trail is it’s own kind of magic. There’s the magic of finding people doing this same trail day after day. You end up hiking at a similar pace and camping together each night. We are a merry band of travelers on a gypsy journey across mountains. There is the magic of a trail name. You are another person here. The same but not. There is the darkness that sends us inside to quiet activity before early sleep. Owls hooting above, the sound of a brook, the sunrise, group breakfast, break camp, more mountains. And there is trail magic! Today I was treated to trail magic twice. At Gooch Gap a couple of veteran thru-hikers handed out beers, cokes, donuts to all of us passing through. I grabbed a donut with some folks I’ve been hiking with. We climbed up to Woody Gap and yet more trail magic! Zeus had little Debbie treats and cold Gatorade waiting for us. I’ve never had a better nutty buddy than that one warmed in the sun. A big climb up to cedar ledges then down into Lance Creek camp area. Tomorrow we’ll tackle Blood Mountain. But tonight just after the Spring Equinox, I’m listening to the stream and the owls and feeling the magic of the day. The trilliums are just emerging along the trail.

Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608625,"My spot at Lance Creek directly faced the first blazed tree of the trail going up toward Gaddis Mountain, Turkey Stamp, and then Slaughter Creek. Beyond that is the climb up Blood Mountain then a descent to Neel Gap. There is a wonderful stone Building with a hostel for hikers. Beside it is an old spreading oak, it’s limbs draped with the boots from hikers who have stopped their long hike right there at mile 31. It is a tough section of climbing up and down before the push to 4442ft and a steep, rocky finish consisting of granite slabs and stone steps. I hiked with or near Django, Doppler, and Q most of the day. We’d been expecting late morning rain but that held off during the 4 hours it took to reach the summit of Blood Mountain. I’ve done this hike and had this view in the past but not with a heavy pack. As always the view from the ledge was breathtaking-Waves of blue peaks to the horizon. Extra special to be there with fellow travelers who were seeing it for the first time. We cheered as each appeared: puck carrier, Doppler, Q, Silent Bob, Spools, Lukenbach.

Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608626,Imagine standing in the chest cavity of a sleeping giant. The great bellowing of the mountains inhaling and exhaling surrounded us as we traveled from Neels Gap past Bull Gap and up Levelland Mountain. Our crew began together but Lukenbach and I pulled away after Levelland. We noticed the tiny emerging leaves of the grace seeds planted by hiking poles along the trail. Soon this hiker planted garden will grace the passage of future trekkers with a runway of grasses and wildflowers. The gang caught up to us  on top of Wolf Laurel Top. Then the descent to Tesnatee Gap where a group of SCAD students were just finishing a trip and provided us with trail magic: snickers and baby ruth bars. Welcome fuel for the steep switch-backs up Wild Cat Mountain.  Then from Hog Pen Gap up and down to Sheep Rock Top. There is a lot of blow down wreckage along the ridge lines but tangles of blackberry are enjoying the space in those bare places. Fruit for bears and birds and scampering creatures come July. Luke and I traveled in silence for the final 3 miles of the 11.5 we hiked today. We arrived at Low Gap Shelter at 4 and decided to sleep inside it tonight rather than pitch a tent. There are 7 spaces and all are taken. Our fellow trekking friends made it while some light still filled this little gap between the rolled shoulders of two sleeping giants. There is also a group of high school students here on a church trip. We ate together and everyone tucked into tent or shelter before 8.

Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608728,"The snoring mountain giants grew quiet at 3am. The sudden quiet woke me and when I poked my head out of my bag the forest appeared lit by a search light. The bare trees on the ridge top above us held the brightest moon in their branches and it shined directly into the shelter. I ducked back inside and slept until someone’s phone alarm played music at 6:30. She scurried to find, then quiet it but everyone was awake at that point. Our group (Teebeedee, Django, Lukenbach, Doppler, Q, Happy Hour, me) decided to make it a lower mileage day up to Blue Mountain Shelter—about 7.3 miles. Also that shelter has a wonderful covered porch with cooking table and sunrise views. Luke took to the trail earliest, then me, with the rest breaking camp at a more leisurely pace. I have to say this is a benefit of sheltering rather than tenting, you can roll up pad and bag pretty quick to get out. The terrain wasn’t as steep as other sections but there are long stretches of craggy rocks that require some thought and care when placing feet. They are beautiful, like Zen moss gardens, but also treacherous. They are called “ankle busters” for good reason. For most of the day I traveled alone, though when I stopped for more than a few minutes other hikers passed by. I felt my energy level nose dive at around noon and stopped at a big log for a proper lunch. It’s a pain to stop mid-hike, remove pack, dig out food bag, rifle through, assemble, etc. so I’ve mostly eaten something quick that I can stow in my pack pocket. Rx bars are my go to. As the mileage has piled up I’m burning more calories than I’m eating on trail and I’m starting to feel it at mid day, so today I stopped and had a nice picnic of high calorie seed crackers smeared with a small container of full fat cream cheese and a whole packet of Trader Joe’s manzanilla green olives along with half a bag of crunchy roasted corn and bean snacks with a halvah bar for dessert. Many delicious calories. Happy hour caught up to me and had a slow lunch too. It was nice to have a one on one conversation with her as there hadn’t been a moment when we weren’t with the group. As we were pulling on our packs again Doppler, Q, Django, and Teebeedee pulled up. We all ambled down into Chattahoochee Gap where they decided to stop for lunch. I felt energized and rested so left them there and walked the last three miles alone with my thoughts for the most part. When I reached Blue Mountain Shelter Luke was there along with a hiker Paulo(?) who was in his sleeping bag taking a rest day. Along the way I had received a message from family that they’d be at their mountain home for the weekend and could pick me up at Unicoi Gap if I could make it by 6:30. I agreed to go the extra 2.5 for their hospitality. I began unloading my food bag for takers at the shelter as the last of our crew arrived. Paulo asked for anything fresh and got my trail magic apple, some cheese, and my last packet of olives. Luke got all my spicy snacks and hot sauce. Doppler took wasabi peas. Django got bacon pieces. Happy Hour got seed crackers. I felt so sad to leave them at Blue Mountain but grateful to have walked the first fifty miles of The AT with such a good natured group. Happy trails tramily!

Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608869,"After reluctantly leaving my friends on Blue Mountain's shoulder I still had almost 3 miles to go. First a climb to the summit of Blue at 4010 feet with a deep plunge into Unicoi Gap where there is a parking area on the side of the Highway that leads to Helen. More rocks to negotiate with tired hip flexors so I placed feet and pole tips carefully. On trails that require me to spend a lot of time looking at the ground I always try to stop from time to time, stand up to give my neck a break, and be observant of the landscape. During the descent from Blue's summit I noticed more trilliums spreading their trout-skin patterned leaves, a white anemone in bloom, unfurling leaves of violet and coreopsis, a bright yellow cloudless sulphur moth, and all the birds flitting and calling out for mates. At the Gap there was trail magic—fried chicken and beer on one side, cheese burgers and hotdogs on the other. People are sooo kind to feed hikers! I can't get over how wonderful it is to experience selfless generosity from strangers after a hard day of hiking. I waited in the lot for a little while with Apostle who was offered a ride to Helen and took it. Also waited with a father and son from Charleston who have been doing short sections for some years. Then my brother-in-law extraordinaire arrived and whisked me away to a pampered weekend of hot showers, good food, and company. But looking out at their view of the mountains I couldn't help wondering about the trail life happening right at that moment, wondering about my friends, wondering how soon I'd get back there. I’ll be off for a short break to attend important birthdays and a wedding. Gives me some time to tweak my gear and food choices before I reenter the woods. Until then, happy trails everyone.","Blue Mountain Shelter

Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609909,"Plans unravel with a phone call. Section hiking is a double-edged sword. On the one hand you can choose your entry and exit points, taking into account the weather, off trail responsibilities, and allow longer recovery times when injured as well as better resupply options. But it also means saying bittersweet goodbyes to friends made on trail and it means a series of jarring mental shifts in focus. The rhythm of the trail never becomes completely routine or familiar. My plan for sectioning has been to carve out as many big spans as possible, anywhere from 50-100 miles at a time as close together as I can arrange them. I’ve been told section hikers like me are called LASHers: Long Ass Section Hikers.
After 53 miles I left the trail in March for a milestone birthday celebration. Carving out space in April has been a challenge but I found enough consecutive days to reach Franklin, NC from Unicoi Gap. This would be sandwiched between a weekend birthday getaway with my mother and a wedding the following weekend. The weather looked dicey but I didn’t much care. I miss the trail. I’ve been jealously following my tramily as they surge farther and farther ahead of me—about 100 miles at this point. On Sunday I drove up to Unicoi Gap from Atlanta, parked in the lot where I’d been picked up in March and excitedly reentered the white blazed forest with my pack. There are notably fewer thru hikers than in March but more section and day hikers. The trees are gauzy green now and there are large drifts of anemone, trilliums, bluet, mountain flox, and violets. As I enjoyed the view from Rocky Mountain I felt my phone buzz. I’d forgot to put it on airplane mode and found a text from home. A death in the family. A funeral. Could I get off and return home? I’d hardly started so yes, I could. Brother-in-law extraordinaire negotiated the moonscape that is Tray Mountain Road to met me at Tray Gap and shuttle me back to my car. Only 4.4 trail miles logged. But a little bit of time is better than no time. Life happens.","Unicoi Gap

Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614288,"Thirty one years ago on May 2 there were flowers, an aisle, a white dress, music and my true love waiting for me. For all of those years we’ve also had a love affair with the outside world, hiking and biking and paddling. On this anniversary we had wildflowers along an aisle of brown loam in the forest accompanied by butterflies and set to songbird music. No white dress but a full pack and hiking boots. A little camp at Addis Gap beside the Appalachian Trail. A campfire, a tent, a day and night and day of being entirely with one another without distraction. Every anniversary we begin our relationship again, building on the past. This was a perfect fresh start for us. And it is a new beginning for me on the trail. The first two days as a couple from IndianGrave to Dicks Creek Gap followed by a nice stay at Henson Cove B&B. Chocolate strawberries, a beautiful dinner, then a morning kiss and drop-off at the AT trailhead as I go solo for a while. I love you HJS. See you in North Carolina.

Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614304,"In the weeks since I’ve been away the forest has come to life. It is verdant and vibrant in every way Eden must have been. I can scarcely go 100 feet when I must stop to gaze at some newly unfurling fern glade or open throated acre of trilliums or a perfect arrangement of bluets and violets and moss along a rocky springhead. The variety is overwhelming. This is particularly true between Dick’s Gap and Plumorchard Shelter, just shy of the NC border. I felt welcomed back to the trail with bouquets of flowers. This was a short mileage day but one that allowed more time to stop and admire this beautiful mountain. To find my trail legs again slowly. The biggest hiker bubble has passed, though there are a few stragglers and section hikers and plenty of day hikers. Imagine Plumorchard, a large 3 tier shelter, with only 7 of us spread around when compared to a month ago when people were crammed in like sardines. We each felt like we had a private room there was so much space between us. While there spent the evening with Red Beard (AT’87) who is thru hiking the entire Eastern Continental Trail from Key West to Nova Scotia. He began in Florida January and will finish in December after flip-flopping North when he gets to Pennsylvania. Tipping my hat to him and wishing him safe trails. Also met John and Susan from Michigan who are sectioning the trail. They are in-laws and Susan's first taste of the trail proves to be addictive. She vows to come back again with her son. John has a French Press he is fond of, a luxury item out here but coffee is his entire breakfast so he wants it to be worthy. Goodnight from this long green tunnel of flowers.","Dicks Creek

Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614407,"I have been trying to leave home by crossing the border from GA to NC since mid March. When home is close to the trail it is easy to be called backward or to delay for various reasons that crop up. This day I woke at Plumorchard after a restless night. I always sleep lightly and shelter noise (people rustling, turning, snoring, sighing, etc.) usually means almost no sleeping. I felt anxious energy to put one state behind me and so chugged my coffee and packed up quickly. The border is only about 5 miles away from Plumorchard with my final destination a bit more than 12 miles at Standing Indian Shelter after 5200 ft plus of climbing. Welcome to the Southern Nantahala Wilderness where trails mostly go straight up and switch backs are rare. The thru hike of Georgia ends quietly with a small sign nailed to a tree but more traditionally at Bly Gap with a milestone photo at the gnarled old Oak. Mine was taken by John and Susan, the Michiganders who are sectioning and who I’d met at Plumorchard the night before. After a little snack at Bly with flies buzzing everywhere we all set off to climb Sharp Top which hits 4300 ft. Sometimes I could almost reach out to touch the trail in front of me it was so steep. But the work didn’t stop there. Next mountain topped at 4700 ft, then down and up another at 4700,  then another, then to 4800, then a drop into Deep Gap. Here I contemplated breaking one of my trail rules about never camping near an area accessible to cars. The next camping area was another climb up to 4700 and my legs were nearly out of gas. I pulled off my pack and chatted with thru hiker Meow who shares this same rule about car accessible areas and encouraged me to push on. She set off up Standing Indian Mountain while I debated. Not long after, a sweet couple from Nashville who I’d chatted with off and on during the day on trail provided some much needed trail magic! I’d complained early on that my external battery wasn’t functioning and I’d have to wait days to get a phone charge. On the trail my phone is my favorite tool: a navigation device with water sources and every waypoint listed, my kindle, my weather info, my connection to concerned family, my journal. This couple spotted me in the parking area and waved me over to present me with a fully charged solar battery! It is true that the trail provides. I am consistently humbled by the kindness and generosity of people out here. Newly energized by this stroke of luck I decided to climb the mountain and was rewarded with the most perfect stealth campsite ever. Just south of the shelter and perched beside the trail in a knoll of grasses and bluets with the sound of a stream and a view of the ridge tops on both sides. Finally a deep sleep on this first night in NC at mile 85.9.","Plumorchard Shelter

Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614564,"The numbers ending in zero have significance. They are milestones and today marked that first round double digit number. But first the glorious hike through Moody Gap with it’s stunning hillsides of trilliums and mayapples. Fragrant air and sunshine and loamy soft trails made for a dreamy early part of the day. There is a forest road that runs nearby and crisscrosses the trail with campsites accessible by car. The AT has been nearly trash-free with just a few exceptions and those exceptions seem to relate to the most easily accessible places for weekend campers or car camping. In my experience thru hikers tend to be very respectful of the trail and hold each other accountable for LNT principles that include packing out every bit of trash. So it is startling and disappointing to see a trashed campsite like the one I found before Albert Mountain. Empty cans, a roll of toilet paper, soggy cheesecake, eggshells, coffee cups, plastic bags. After all the lovely flower-rich trail leading to this I decided I couldn’t leave it so I bagged what I could and tied it to my pack since I knew there would be a trash bin at Rock Gap at days end. No big deal I thought until I reached Albert Mountain which has a 22% grade—equal to a ladder propped against a wall. Hauling that extra poundage of garbage up to the top had me swearing, but in the end there was a celebration with fellow traveler 2nd Chance, a retired cop from Boston who took my picture at the tower. I’d met him the day before at Muskrat Shelter where I stopped for lunch before continuing to my overnight at Betty’s Gap. After Albert he stopped at Long Branch for the night and I continued down to Rock Gap where my car was parked. John (Blue Brew) and Susan and Trillium and Kevin (Banana Claus) were waiting for a shuttle to Franklin but I hightailed it to the Nantahala Mountain Lodge for a wonderful overnight stay with laundry and resupply. And Mexican Food with a Margarita to celebrate the first 100. Perfection!

",Rock Gap,"May 08, Wed",19.90
Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614876,"After an early breakfast at the lodge I got a shuttle drop off at Rock Gap to begin the day. Kevin5.0 had been tempted by a “too good to be true” deal on ripe bananas at Ingles and was hauling more than 3lbs of them in his pack to give away as trail magic. I took two and shoved them into my front pack pockets so they looked like banana holsters. Trillium took a couple and then Munchie. Fresh fruit is a rare treat on trail so K5.0’s pack was getting lighter as we walked. I called him Banana Claus because of the big white hyperlite pack on his back full of banana gifts for good little hikers. (Later learned this name stuck!) Also he is a happy, glass half-full kind of guy no matter what happens. He is chatty and full of good cheer.
So the usual climbs and descents all day, but after a night of rain--which I avoided at the lodge, the trail was fresh and dripping like a rainforest. Beautiful burgundy trilliums and wild cranesbill geraniums and daisies galore plus waterfalls followed a short scurry along the highway shoulder at Winding Stair Gap then across it. How strange it is to move from the lush green forest to the asphalt and rumble of cars and then right back into the arms of the trees. The forecast and threat of rain pushed us to take the long long trail down to Siler Shelter, a blue blazed trail that seems never-ending before you finally see the shelter which has seen better days. A very nice water source and big field for tents, but otherwise a dowdy shelter.Folks continued to arrive until all spaces were full including two bunking on the strip of platform along the toes of everyone else. Met Lilou from Germany who has already done the PCT and Luna, a dude who also finished it and isn’t shy about stripping down in the shelter kitchen to wipe himself down thoroughly, LOL. Jukebox entertained us with wild tales of the eclipse until Tiny drifted off to sleep. John and Susan “Michiganders” took the ends. Needless to say with such a packed house the bananas decreased to almost nothing overnight. Twas sweet dreams to the patter of rain on the tin roof and the breathing of other nomads tucked in together like a pack of human sardines at mile 113.1.","Rock Gap

Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615092,"The AT passes right by the big meadow known as Siler Bald, which has a serpentine path worn through to its top at over 5200 feet. It is about a .2 mile diversion and an extra climb so most thru hikers don’t explore it. My hiking agenda is focused on experiencing the trail visually and in detail, meeting the other people on trail, and making miles before I have to get off again. So as everyone left Siler Shelter I dropped my pack at the base of the bald and began the climb. On this spring day I learned that the meadow is a big strawberry field sprinkled with wildflowers and grasses. Very like an alpine meadow from The Sound of Music! Really, you could twirl and belt out a song and feel very “Julie Andrews.” At top you are rewarded with big views and a stone directional marker. Back on trail and coming down the mountain through the forest is like walking through an edible Eden. Wild ramps, edible mushrooms, fiddlehead fern, thornless blackberry, violets, blueberry and more. Paths strewn with the dropped bell shaped blossoms of Carolina Silverbell so it seems a wedding has just taken place. Tinkling spring heads over missy stone. Dense textural greens and showy flowers. More big views along the way. Yeah, I heart this mountain more than all the others so far.","Siler Shelter 
",Cold Springs,"May 10, Fri",12
Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615379,"After leaving Siler the climb up Wayah (Cherokee for ""wolf"") to the tower wasn’t terrible. There are many signs of the wildfires that swept through some years ago. Burned tree trunks and leafless old rhododendrons stand along the trail with new understory growth greening at their feet, particularly honey locust and blackberry. The stone tower atop Wayah is interesting architecturally and has a creepy wet interior basement painted with graffiti. The large expansive view from up top is worthy of a stop. But my favorite discovery was the clean toilet building just uphill! Very welcome sight after all the sketchy “mouldering privies” on offer along the AT. I arrived to find Big Man and Refugee moseying around, then Kevin (Banana Claus=B.C.) arrived. We took pics with the view then headed out. Big Man and Refugee took off first--in the wrong direction. We yelled until they turned back. The white blaze is on one corner of the shelter and you continue the AT behind it, FYI. As we were leaving we saw Tiny trudging up to the paved area. She has had some falls and injuries and is nursing arthritis in an elbow so I much admire her tenacity.
When BC and I pushed into Cold Springs Shelter we found it filled to the brim. It’s a log cabin style lean-to built in the 1930s and not very large. Above it is a ridge with several camp spots and it is here you find a nice picnic table with a view. There is no table at the shelter, only a fire ring and some logs along with a lot of gnats. Having water so close to the shelter is convenient but it creates clouds of bugs. I brought along a cheap ""citronella bug bracelet"" and tried it out while I ate with the group near the shelter and I must say I had fewer of them floating around my face than everyone else.
During the night music drifted up from a concert down in the valley and it was so pleasant in my tent listening to it...and then the rain set in. All night, off and on. Happy to say my Marmot Tungsten UL tent stayed very dry inside. Banana Claus wasn’t so lucky. His Zpac UL takes on a lot of water no matter how he sets it up—I think from ground splash entering the vented areas above the tub edge. There is a design flaw that just doesn't allow a deep enough gable over the vent area to mitigate the splash in pouring rain. He woke with a liter of water inside and a wet bag. In the end nearly everything gets wet when you break camp in a driving rain. 
Very soggy and slippery trail to negotiate. Flooded trails, rivers for trails, shin high slog with muddy muck. B.C. had a terrible day: first the wet tent and wet bag, then his rain gear wetted out, then a branch poked his eye and tore his contact lens, then a misstep on a slick rock sent him tumbling hard which bruised his ribs and broke his hiking pole (which is of course also his tent pole.) Really, I would have cried and gone home at that point. But he took a brief personal moment to regroup then forged ahead to the NOC. On the other hand I wimped out and decided to take a Near-o rather than risk the treacherous downhill mud-skiing into the NOC. I called for a pick up at Telico by Maggie from the Nantahala Mountain Lodge. Sweet lady met waterlogged me in the gravel lot and whisked me off trail to the dry comfort of her guest lodge.
After a shower and once the rain had subsided I managed to get down to the NOC to have dinner with everyone who'd bravely weathered the deluge. Saw B.C., Munchie, Meow, Trillium, John & Susan Michiganders, and lots of others.
One notable bright spot! Up on Rocky Bald my older son managed to catch me at a brief moment of phone signal to wish me an early Happy Mother’s Day. Even in thunder and rain there can be light. But I think my boots are beyond all hope.","Cold Springs
",Telico Gap,"May 11, Sat",3.60
Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615426,"The Nantahala Mountain Lodge is about 20 minutes above The NOC. The NOC is a very popular destination for hikers with a big complex of lodging options, laundry, general store and decent outfitters. After a very peaceful night alone in the Lodge Maggie followed me to the NOC to drop my car next morning as it’s my destination point before Fontana. Did I mention I have my car for this entire 20ish day section of my hike? Here are the logistics: Hubby and I brought both cars up for our anniversary weekend/section send off. Inside are all my resupplies of food and other stuff like TP, maps, trail guide, as well as clean ""town clothes"" and extra gear. I parked first at Rock Gap and hubby dropped me at Dick's Creek where I began hiking north toward the car. When I reached Rock Gap several days later I drove it to the Lodge where I overnighted, then it stayed parked there while I hiked from Rock Gap to Telico. After the NOC, hubby will meet me at Fontana. We'll drive back to the NOC to get my car, overnight at Fontana and then he'll help me drop it at Newfound Gap in the Great Smokies.
Now back to the present: It’s less than 8 trail miles from Telico Gap to the NOC so I decided to carry only a small pack with enough supplies for a day hike and leave my large pack in the car. I took a water bottle, my filter set up, a cheese sandwich, some snacks, and a couple of other things. Wow, how soon you forget that it is much easier and faster without an extra 30lbs on your back! I am so glad I didn’t do it in the pouring rain. I would have missed the lovely and longggg descent into the river gorge. I would have been stressed about falling in the mud, would have had my head down against the rain, would have been subjected to the many blowdowns crossing this section of trail in rainy conditions. It was difficult enough without the rain. Instead I moved lightly over the trail stopping to look at sunning lizards, take pictures of flowers, pick my way carefully over fallen trees, and listen to the roar of the swollen river in the gorge below.
One spot in the trail features a treacherous turn at a rock outcropping that reminds me of Pride Rock from Lion King. It is called The Jump Off. I honestly thought I was off trail for a moment because it seemed the trail just ended into a void that drops hundreds of feet down into trees, but as you edge closer you see it turns sharply right and steps down in a way that is hard to see. This would be a bad spot for a night hike or in fog, or in pouring rain with your head down. Yikes! But the view there is breathtaking. There are signs of the fires all around with understory recovery. Lots of Honey Locust and blackberry and laurel blooming. Down at the NOC I grabbed a room at Dogwood and spread out gear to continue drying. Took care of some blisters on my left heel from the wet boot hike to Telico. Had dinner and ran into Tiny who is still moving forward. Made phone calls to my mother and mother in law for Mother’s Day. I had a nice chat with younger son while standing on trail above the gorge, something I prefer to breakfast in bed any day. Tomorrow I repack drier gear and head to Fontana where I'll meet up with hubby in a few days! I am back to the heavy but beloved turtle shell and maybe my spare boots. Uphill miles to begin the day. Sigh.","Telico Gap
",The NOC,"May 12, Sun",7.90
Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615649,"I woke at the Dogwood and checked my gear. Most of it was dry with exception of my boots which smelled like mildew and other unsavory things so I made the decision to let them retire. They had worked hard and lived a good life on many trails and deserved to rest in peace at a milestone trail destination like the NOC. So I had a quick breakfast at the NOC's General Store and switched to my spare boots kept stashed in my car with all my resupplies. Then back across the river and up into the mountains again. 
The overwhelming floral theme out of the NOC was mountain laurels. I love their blush colored origami buds that pop open into individual ballerina tutus gathered into bridal bouquets at the ends of branches. Pretty quickly after the climb from the gorge you must squeeze through tunnels of frothy blooms and duck beneath the bowers. Of course the going is very steep with few switchbacks as is the hallmark of the trails in NC. Along the way you pass a memorial to a firefighter who lost his life battling a blaze in 1968 and many hikers leave tributes around the marker. Climbing into cooler damper zones there are lady slippers and trilliums and the first large blooms of lily of the valley I’ve seen. They are so fragrant and I picked up a broken one and tucked it into a loop on my pack strap. It nearly masks the scent of pit sweat that permeates both straps now. 
At around mile 143 I reached Sassafras Gap Shelter and decided to call it a day rather than do the push up and over Cheoah Bald. The weather had become very windy and chilly. A weekend hiker, Erica, was already unpacked inside and trying to get warm inside her bag. She and her friends were having their first backpack trip. They wanted to tent further up and she wanted to stay in the shelter for warmth. She carried well over 40lbs for a two day hike including a rubber food bag with at least 4 days worth of meals, a full terry bath towel, two metal water bottles, a heavy car camping tent, flashlight, and other assorted items. She was interested in the much lighter options out there and how that would affect the enjoyment of trail hiking. A lot, in my opinion.
Shortly Porridge arrived with her adorable trail dog Ivy who is really well trained. We had a short conversation but she and Ivy were just making a pit stop then pushing forward. After Porridge left Erica got a text from her friends who had decided not to camp but push all the way to Stecoah Gap where their cars were parked. They didn't like the weather. This really ticked her off but she made an executive decision to try to hike to them rather than overnight in place. In great haste she crammed her gear into her bag and dashed out to begin the 6 mile hike at around 6:30pm with dark creeping in and no headlamp. I assume she managed it. 
You get used to hiking alone for stretches and even tenting alone from time to time. I don't really mind it. For the first time I contemplated sleeping in a shelter alone. Sassafras is actually a larger shelter so it feels cavernous and a little creepy-lonely with wind blowing and dark settling in. Just as gray twilight began to deepen and I was settling into my chosen cozy corner to read Red Beard arrived! We had sheltered together at Plumorchard my first night back on the trail along with Susan and John Michiganders, and others. Along the way I’d lost track of him other than hearsay and shelter journal entries. Turns out he'd taken some time with family so we were temporarily back on a synched path. I couldn’t have asked for a more interesting evening companion. He completed a thru of the AT in 1987 and is now thru hiking the trails along the east coast from Key West, Florida to Newfoundland (the Eastern Continental Trail), which will take a year. Not many attempt it so he’s a bit of a growing legend on the trail. Deep conversation and a restful sleep followed darkfall. 
I will admit that it is nice to hear someone else breathing near by on a dark and windy night in the mountains.","The NOC
",Sassafras Gap Shelter,"May 13, Mon",7.10
Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615739,"Red Beard and I broke camp at Sassafras around the same time, had breakfast and walked around picking up a little bit of trash at the shelter to pack out. I left first knowing he'd probably overtake me in short order, having already hiked more than 1500 miles of his journey on the ECT. First order of business was the climb up to Cheoh Bald. Place names like Wayah and Cheoah are a constant reminder of the historical presence of the Cherokee people in these mountains. The spellings are sometimes anglicized into English. For example Cheoah is roughly ""cheeohwa"" which means ""otter."" Probably relating to the waterway in the gap below. THis morning Cheoah means a steep climb from the shelter but steep also means big views. In this way Cheoah does not disappoint. It has more trees than Siler Bald and is less uniformly grassy, more rough meadow in appearance, but the bird song here was intensely lovely and butterflies darted everywhere gathering nectar. I had my pack off when Red Beard arrived and we took photos of one another with the vista behind us before I took off to leave him with the view. We'd end up leap frogging for most of the day. I stop to take photos of flowers and views pretty often so I am passed by other hikers regularly. Today I found Jack in the Pulpit, pink lady slippers as well as the yellow ones that look like dragons, trilliums with the small yellow flowers that mimic fairy crowns, and white honey locust panicles full of frantic nectar drunk bees.
At Stecoah Gap I took a moment to stretch out on a warm picnic table. Chatted with a father and son pair of hikers out for a few days on trail, Dad being 80 and son in his 50s. Also a SOBO section hiker who told me her husband had been at the outdoor concert I'd heard from my tent at Cold Springs. She said the weather was so brutal it ruined their tents and they had to sleep in their car all night. No trace of Erica who had dashed out the night before to meet her friends so I'm certain she made it without trouble. Somewhere on the other side of Stecoah (Cherokee for ""little place"") Red Beard pulled ahead of me. I got a whiff of cigarette smoke at the blue blaze leading down to Brown Fork Shelter and knew he had been there, or perhaps was taking a quick break but I decided to push forward to Cody Gap rather than stop again. The sun was tapering off when I arrived to set up camp. There are a few spots right on the trail but I prefer to be less visible, especially since it appeared I'd be solo camping. I managed to find a cleared and flattish spot near the trail leading down to the spring, which also happened to be surrounded by mayapples and trilliums. I photographed a burgundy leafed trillium I'd never seen anywhere else. The spot is really beautiful and peaceful! Found a decent bear bag hang, took some time to soak my tired feet in the cold spring waters, had a good dinner and tucked in for a very peaceful night's sleep.","Sassafras Gap Shelter

Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615855,"The birds woke me up at my cozy campsite at Cody Gap. This would be my last day in the Nantahala so I wanted to be present and observant, but also get to Fontana to meet my husband and do all the trail-stop things one does (laundry, resupply, bathe, eat, eat, eat.) So once I had my breakfast and coffee, packed up, and got back on the trail I began to miss the Nantahala before leaving it. This section has been so very lovely and floral and rain forest lush. Finding good water sources is easy. Shelters and campsites are never too far apart. I'd say the section leading down to Fontana isn't the most beautiful of all those I've passed through but still worthy of awe.I spotted a few more of the burgundy trilliums along the way, fragrant wild viburnum, extremely healthy blackberry patches, and blooming flame azalea. I stopped at Cable Gap for lunch and saw that Red Beard had been through already. Eventually I got a glimpse of the dam through the trees and knew I was close. I was supposed to call my husband from the Marina when I reached it. It has indoor plumbing! A soda machine! Also a very sweet memorial to a man who did not finish his thru hike beyond Fontana due to pancreatic cancer. (His wife has left a pair of his boots there filled with pebbles and hikers are asked to take one then leave it wherever they finish their hike in memory of him. I took a white pebble and tucked it in my pack.) What the Marina doesn't have is a phone signal. So I ended up climbing another mile to find a signal which meant I wasn't turning back to meet anyone, so I pushed on toward the shelter.When I arrived there was a small welcoming party. Hubby had run into my trail buddy, Munchie. The two realized they had me in common and were sipping bourbons and telling tales while waiting for me. I love the connections this trail creates! So a fond farewell to the Nantahala and great anticipation for the Smokies!","Cody Gap

Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615939,"Fontana Lodge is a popular place for hikers to stop before entering the Great Smoky Mountains backcountry. It's also a popular gathering place for souped up cars and motorcycle enthusiasts because of a stretch of paved road known as the Tail of the Dragon. It has 311 turns in eleven miles so if making turns is your thing, this is the place to be. It means the lodge is a funny mixture of people: sweaty, hippy-looking hikers doing laundry and moving about by foot and another set in leather chaps or Nascar sunglasses polishing their vehicles and zooming around at high decibel speeds. Both sets hang around and discuss gear a lot, just different kinds of gear. 
Fully focusing on hiking a trail is tunnel vision at its best, in my opinion. But other outdoor opportunities open up when you take a day off and look around, or if you have a husband who doesn't believe a zero day should mean zero adventure. He loves fishing. It doesn't matter if he catches a fish or not, just being on water throwing out a line with some morsel of hope in his heart is plenty good enough. So while I finished up my laundry and resupplied my pack he chatted with Munchie on the porch of the General Store and got busy finding someone to take us fly fishing later in the afternoon. This meant altering some plans, changing one B&B to another, and dropping my car at Newfound Gap earlier than I anticipated. Munchie fully supported the fly fishing idea so when the call came that a guide had agreed to meet us, the new plan was in motion.
We fist dropped my car in the GSM then met our guide in Bryson City at Tuckaseegee Fly Shop. Bryson City is adorable and worth a stop. Our fishing destination took us on a backtrack to the Nantahala River about 15 minutes above the NOC. The water was running high and wild so wading upstream meant knee-high resistance work against the water while sliding over slippery stones. I leaned a lot about reading water, understanding what is beneath the surface, the preferences of trout, and a number of different casting techniques. After lots of bites I finally hooked a decent sized rainbow and managed to get him all the way into the net. We took photos and released him and I called it a day. The guys fished a while longer while I let my legs rest on the bank. At dusk we returned to Bryson City for dinner and then to our awesome B&B, The Folkstone Inn. A very full day for a zero.","Fontana Lodge

Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616104,"I love the videos of people crossing Fontana Dam in the misty morning as they approach the Smokies backcountry entrance of the AT. It makes the trek look as mysterious and epic as you'd imagine it to be when crossing the highest dam in the Eastern US to enter a wilderness area containing the highest peaks of the trail. I slept fitfully and with great anticipation the night before this solemn test of my newly strengthening trail legs. But The Folkstone Inn has an amazing breakfast that isn't served hiker early. Begin with good coffee, a fruit cup and fresh homemade donuts to dunk in the coffee. Follow with a delicious arepa (basically a tamale dough that is flattened and griddled rather than stuffed) topped with freshly gathered yard eggs from their free range chickens, slashed with good tomato salsa from the garden, and house-smoked bacon on the side. Delicious!
After breakfast we made a needed stop at a pharmacy. Soon the morning was no longer young and I began to feel anxious about such a late beginning. There was no early morning misty video over the dam. Just a clear blue sky and creeping humid heat by the time I dropped my thru permit into the box on the other side of the dam. Hubby graciously carried my food bag up the first three miles to Open Ledges where, like magic, the humidity lifted as the altitude increased past 2500 feet. At that point we lingered for the view before I took my food, we said our farewell, and I carried on alone. I decided to make Birches my destination because of the time. I took the little side trail up to Shuckstack, dropped my pack and considered climbing the tower. I spoke briefly to a couple just coming down and found they were doing the 20 mile loop trail. They highly recommended going up and I'm glad I took their advice. The 360 degree view of rolling ridgetops on a clear day is amazing to behold. You can see where you've come from and what is in store.
When I arrived at Birches the same couple was there and pointed down toward the creek that separates the campsites. A bear was having an afternoon drink, completely unconcerned with us. Not interested but also not fearful. They were on a short holiday from their home in Arizona and avid outdoors people, mostly trail bikers. I chose a site on one side of the creek and they took the other side. Soon two more thru hikers arrived, Sock Monkey and Zoom, then a whole troop arrived. Collectively they are known as ""The Band"" because at least 4 of them play guitar pretty well and the others join in with various improvised percussion instruments. Wandering Kiltsman is the member carrying a backpacking guitar so it goes without saying he plays pretty well, Swan plays and sings in a Johnny Cash style, Blacktoe is a lady friend of Kiltsman's just along for the adventure, Zach plays and comes up with his own lyrics about the trail, Moses has a selection of tunes as well, Crash accompanies with percussion on a pot bottom or by thumping a log. Very fun group at night around the fire ring! 
A young family of four arrived in the midst of the singing. They set camp up near me and proceeded to cook dinner away from their tent but next to mine. Food smells bring bears and other animals so generally we try to keep that to one area like the fire ring rather than any tenting spots. ""Mom"" asked for guidance about hanging their food on the cables and we suggested they get water upstream at the pipe rather than down where the toilet area is directly uphill and where the animals seemed to prefer drinking. During the night I could hear animals moving near the tent but none bothered me. Overall a pleasant and restful first night in the Smokies.","Bryson City

Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616251,"Woke at Birches to a beautiful crisp morning. I have been so fortunate with weather. Really only one very rainy day in the Nantahala but blue skies and mild temps otherwise. Got packed and on trail fairly early, about the same time as most members of The Band. The young camping family was breakfasting by the fire-ring and getting water at the pipe as we pulled out. The route began with wildflowers just popping up. And then I came to large swaths of oddly plowed up and denuded ground that lay along both sides of the trail. I've seen this kind of devastation before in south Georgia. Bands of wild pigs root up tender plants and small trees, they create mud wallows in moist areas, and batter down plants where they bed at night. As the miles passed by I became more and more alarmed at the amount of damage to the understory! Not a wildflower or fern or blade of grass to be seen in huge areas along miles of trail. So disheartening and disturbing to contemplate. And places where a spring should be seeping appeared as mashed and trampled wallows of black mud. I had no idea these invasive, non-native animals were such a problem in the back country. The Smokies need quick intervention to control these destructive critters or too much will be lost of one of the worlds most diverse ecosystems.
Eventually I came to a most beautiful stretch of trail bordered by fields of long, soft meadow grasses beneath beech trees. Dappled sun and a breeze ruffled the grass so prettily it made the pig-damaged areas that much more hurtful to think about. A ridgerunner was stationed at Mollies Ridge Shelter and he was checking the permits of those going forward. No permit, no problem! He could process your payment right on the spot and give you one as a thru hiker. Not sure what would happen if you weren't a thru hiker. He had info about which shelters would be full with reservations. If a shelter is full a thru hiker can tent but otherwise is supposed to sleep in the shelter. Most of us prefer to tent over shelter for the sake of a good night's sleep.
A lot of us from Birches chose Spence Field as our end point even though it is a short hike off trail through a tree-shaded meadow. The Guthook app lists it as having no privy but in fact it has a brand spanking NEW facility. Really the nicest one on the trail so far with a locking door and half moon decoration on it. It even smells like new wood rather than a moldering latrine. Oh, it's the littlest things that can make you happy sometimes.
The Band members ended up at Spence so we had music again after dinner. Flip Flop hiker Sock Ninja was there and a retired gentleman who is sectioning. Some weekend hikers with reservations showed up, including a very funny couple of dudes with gigantic packs. One of them, Lido, had two bear sprays (one was a practice spray) and all kinds of heavy food and gear. He made us laugh with his very dramatic expressions of fatigue and entertained us with a Philippine ghost story at dusk. We were in for a treat as the moon rose. I've never seen one like it and later heard it was a rare ""Full Flower Blue Moon."" First a very red orb began to inch from behind the dark mountain ridge then grew larger as it rose into a purpling sky. Dark tree limbs seemed to cage the huge and glowing orange full moon, but then clouds sifted across to cause a gauzy effect so that the moon became blurry and then slowly disappeared into a splotch of pale amber. We all sat silently in awe and then clapped at the display before tucking into our chosen slots in the shelter with Swan happily tenting beside it.","Birches Campsite

Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616569,"One thing hikers look forward to seeing in the Smokies backcountry is wildlife. The Great Smoky Mountains NP is known for its biodiversity in terms of plants and animals. Few places on the planet are as richly diverse. Here you are likely to see black bear and other large animals, and on that account I can say I haven't been disappointed. Not long out of Spence Field there is a very steep climb up to Rocky Top at 5422ft and then some ups and downs to Tunderhead Mountain at 5520ft. Yes, it is required to stand and sing the Osborne Brothers classic tune on the summit of Rocky Top while taking in the view: 
Rocky Top you'll always be, Home sweet home to me! Good old Rocky Top. Rocky Top Tennesee. Rocky Top Tennesee...
Moving down a long decent from Thunderhead a big tom turkey strolled across my path and I stopped to watch him while he warily watched me. More turkey and a couple of deer later I came to a section of Rhododendron that closed the trail around me a bit. From somewhere in the underbrush beside me I hear a low rumbling, something like a throaty growl. I immediately froze and tried to see what had made this noise but couldn't see through all the leaves down the hill. Could have been a bear or could have been a large feral hog. Ironically a female bear and female pig are both called a sow, and the males of both are called boars. Maybe because they sound a lot alike? Whatever made the grumble sound seemed to be warning me to move through quickly so I picked up my pace and got out of the thicket ASAP.
Stopped at Derrick Knob for lunch and ran into a couple of other hikers. There is a privy here and a spring that's a bit of a steep hike down. Found a logbook entry from Munchie who has hooked up with his girlfriend. They are hiking the GSMP together which is a tough entry point for her having not done the first 150 miles of trail. Glad to see she is hanging with him. Also note: this is why logbooks are better than online postings while on trail. It's the quickest and surest way to let trail friends know you have passed through and how you are faring. I'm always grateful to find the handwriting, thoughts, and doings of fellow hikers in these. 
Reached the final destination of Siler's Bald Shelter later in the afternoon. Found some of The Band members here (Moses, Zach, Crash) but Swan had decided to go on to Double Springs where there is a privy. Blacktoe and Kiltsman were farther back, mainly because she (Blacktoe/Ryanne) is still working on endurance and trail stamina. She had very little backpacking experience before beginning the AT and decided to get in physical shape on trail. Much respect for toughing it out this far because it is not easy for those of us in fair backpacking condition. Also in the shelter were a father and son on a backpacking weekend for the son's 16th birthday. He was getting to skip school for the occasion. Dad has been hiking all the GSNP backcountry trails for several decades and had stories to tell. They shared their snacks with us and we all got to join in the birthday celebration.
As dusk settled bugs appeared and Crash made a small fire to smoke things up a little and drive them away. (Learned from him that hand sanitizer makes a very good fire accelerant. One squirt on dry wood, a touch from a lighter and flames! Good hack to know.) Soon a small group of female deer arrived to graze around the shelter. Several looked round-bellied with spring fawns ready to drop. We also spotted a herd of pigs crashing around down the slope looking for more ground to plow up. And a little harem of turkey hens with their Tom strutted through the long grass in the field that serves for a toilet at this shelter. Most spaces on upper and lower deck were full for the night. Most pleasant company to be with, both human and wild.","Spence Field Shelter

Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616787,"Today marks the end of a section, a goodbye for now kind of hike and it makes me a little wistful. I'm plotting how I'll come back even though I still have a full day of hiking before I leave this place. Of course it's a beautiful blue-sky day again and I decide to hike mostly alone. I want to savor these miles slowly and quietly in my own time. Everyone else is excited for a zero in Gatlinburg. Most hikers are exiting at Clingman's Dome Rd for a shuttle, but my car is parked further along at Newfound Gap. Members of The Band are talking about breaking up the tramily. Several of them feel they need to be making quicker time and are ready to do bigger miles, others aren't ready and will lag behind. But having been part of an earlier tramily during the GA section I can attest that those bonds don't disappear. The Band will live on.
Most of the early part of my last day is spent in a gorgeous spruce forest. The spruce zone begins on the climb up to Clingman's dome. It is a mossy, evergreen, viburnum flowered wonderland that smells of loam and Christmas. The trails are raised here and there in the gaps with crosshatched log pathways or dirt filled log byways. The moss is so thick on downed logs that they appear to be fuzzy muppets or wooly beasts. Dinner plate sized shelf mushrooms cling to rotting stumps. Viburnum bushes are bedecked with clusters of white bell shaped flowers that fall and dapple the moss. It is truly lovely and I move slowly to take it in. 
Eventually I emerge onto an open ridge and get a glimpse of Clingman in front of me. The heat is immediate and I welcome the intermittent shade as well as the clouds that sift over the trail and feel like a cooling mist machine has come on. The climb is so gradual that I am surprised to suddenly find myself emerge from the forest at the edge of a paved trail clogged with tourists who have climbed up from the parking area to see the tower on the peak. It is concrete and styled as a Jetson's era flying saucer with an upload ramp attached. I drop my pack and climb it to take in the 360 degree view, pausing to look south toward my beginning and then north at what is left to do.
Back on the trail I am suddenly more focused on finishing out the day and getting to my car. Perhaps the busy watchtower has broken the spell of the spruce forest, or maybe because the trail beyond Clingman's is drier and not as lovely as the climb up to the dome. A good part of the trail here is parallel to the road and so there is traffic noise. There is an interesting plaque at Indian Gap worth reading and the buttercup meadow is a sunny happy spot to do so. I pass through the Beech Forest enclosure that is an attempt to protect a small area from the feral pigs that plague the park. And then in a short time I begin to descend and hear traffic noises and come to the stone wall at Newfound Gap. Round a corner and the big asphalt parking area appears and I see my my car is still intact where I left it days ago. It's a bittersweet reunion but it's time to go home for a little while. There is a beach vacation waiting, my family, and a return to the responsibilities I've put on hold for 207.7 miles. 
But first...Gatlinburg awaits. A shower! A ginormous steak and potato meal with wine! Then later tonight I'll meet up with trail friend Munchie and his girlfriend for a drink. Tomorrow I'll shuttle them back to the trail and then head home until July.","Siler's Bald Shelter

Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624061,"I am late recording my journey. I've had reservations in the GSMNP twice so that I could finish the backcountry from Newfound Gap and twice I have been thwarted by real life. Feeling jinxed I decided to begin this section just outside Davenport Gap then go back to fill in that final GSMNP section later. Officially making swiss cheese of my sections which are getting farther from home. I'll need to think about longer drives matching longer hikes.
This one began with a huge dinner at the Dillard House on the drive up and then an overnight at the brand new Appalachian Trail-er right on the trail in Hot Springs. (Very clean and comfy) It set a theme because other than caretaker ""Murphy""--a triple crown hiker--I was the only backpacker there. In the morning I left my car at the Pisgah trailhead above Hot Springs and Murphy provided a shuttle to my start point at the Pigeon River bridge parking area. It's a little bit breathtaking to watch a car leave when you are alone on a deserted gravel road at a trailhead. Today it meant settling back into my pack after being away for the summer, wondering if my legs could still carry me, and deciding to be gentle with myself while I regained my footing. I suppose that's the story of section hiking--always reorienting to the trail.
The day began with an immediate climb up Snowbird starting with steep stone stairs just beyond the overpass. I think you climb from about 1500 feet to 4257 in 5 miles. I collected hundreds of spider webs on my way up and met nobody on the trail until mid afternoon. There are signs of autumn with the Virginia creeper turning scarlet, mushrooms the size of hubcaps, bright red pods of Hearts 'a'busting, purple aster, golden rod and frantic bees gathering the last of the nectar. Most of the water sources were dry because we've had little rain of late. The weather in the South is still very warm in September so my shirt stayed soaked all day. Listened to baying hounds and thought about the fact that it is deer season and wished I had a bright orange hat.
Took the side trail up to look at the weather station before enjoying the lush wildflower bald and flitting butterflies on top of Snowbird. At this point in the season the flowers and grasses have become shoulder high walls on each side of the trail and the blazes are on posts. Continued on and decided to stop at Groundhog Creek shelter for the evening. Twas' just me so I was able to pretend I had my own cabin in the woods. Log book had numerous mentions of a young bear in camp so I expected I'd have a visitor. Hung everything except bedding and clothes on cables. Sure enough, at midnight the bear began snuffling along the shelter wall opposite my bedroll. I held my breath as it emerged near the open front of the shelter, paused then circled the picnic table, then the fire ring. When it got to the bear cables I sat up and shined my light out at it and screamed bloody murder, hoping to scare it. Thankfully it took off running and never came back! After that a restful and comfortable night alone in the shelter.","Pigeon River Bridge
",Groundhog Creek Shelter,"Sep 14, Sat",8.70
Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624063,"Woke to mist and pitter-pattering rain that wasn't heavy enough to break through the leaf canopy. Just enough to create an enchanted forest with light filtering through moisture. I knew the day would be a short one because my goal is Max Patch with its big views. I've always wanted to overnight there to catch sunset and sunrise. So I took my time with breakfast and packing things up. The rain kept things cooler and clung to the spider webs making them silvery. Much easier to avoid the ones draped over the trail. Gorgeous shelf mushrooms and a lucky discovery of a very large ""Hen of the Wood"" mushroom beside the trail. I clipped a few lobes from it to add to my dinner later. These have less a slippery texture and a more meaty texture that is a little like chicken with a sweet, nutty flavor. Mountain folk prize it and chefs do too.
Sometime around noon after climbing above Brown Gap Spring I heard a faint but unmistakeable hiss as I put my foot down and immediately veered away from the sound. I stood searching for the snake that had made the warning. It took a moment to see it, a dark toned timber rattler really well camouflaged, with tail tip right beside where my trekking pole had landed, head off trail in the brush. It was about 5 feet long and as thick as my arm with about 12 rattles. An old wise mountain dweller, unhurried and only a little annoyed that I'd come so close. I really do appreciate that s/he warned me with a hiss. It is why I don't wear earbuds when I hike. I like to hear things: birds, rain, wind, people approaching, hissing rattlesnakes.
Reached my destination early in the day, around 2:00. Usually I would push forward but I really wanted to stay on the Patch. Many people up for the day, whether hiking or just driving to the lot near the top and walking a few hundred feet. Five different photo sessions for brides or engaged couples, so fun to watch girls in billowing dresses with their prince charming being posed among the epic background of mountains and wildflowers. I set up camp in a spot with good views to the west and east, poached campfire wood from abandoned campsites, then wandered through the big fields. Was interviewed by a couple with a blog about the AT. Got a nice small fire going and watched the sun paint the sky. Beautiful and peaceful and memorable.
I tucked into my tent and the fun began. Sleeping in a field means all the little critters come out to play. So many of them scampering around me, pushing against my tent walls with little paws, chittering and chattering, climbing up the poles. Suddenly something large and hoofed galloped right by my tent. A little critter screamed and an owl hooted in triumph. The full moon lit up my tent like a search light. Needless to say my sleep was sporadic and fitful. Glad I can say I slept on Max Patch and witnessed the beauty of the sky and mountain range... but if you decide to do it, don't expect to get more than a wink of sleep.","Groundhog Creek Shelter
",Max Patch,"Sep 15, Sun",6.40
Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624114,"All the meadow chatter and moonglow through my tent walls insured I was up for sunrise on Max Patch. There is a slow bleed of orange into the gray, a creep that seems so slow that you have time to understand that this rise of the sun is related to the movement of the planet around a star. And you are a speck riding on that spinning twirling world fully aware of the star that is staining the sky, when suddenly the orb peeks from a notch in the mountains in front of you and then lifts above their crowns. It is glorious to witness.
Early onto the trail and a beautiful day to hike. There are many signs of the large old farm that once spread across this mountain: cleared meadows now full of grasses and flowers, boundary trees, standing fences that once were paddocks.There are plentiful water sources along the trail after Max Patch, thank goodness, because the Patch is dry. I rationed water during my overnight and made sure to hold back half a liter of water to begin the day. Came to a running stream right away and filled up. My goal was Roaring Fork Shelter but I arrived early in the day and kept going. Once I left the general area around Max Patch there were fewer and fewer hikers which made this hike really feel like a solo venture. All in all I met three flippers doing their SOBO section and one couple sectioning like me. The only flipper I spoke to was Joy who is racing against time to finish before going to a wedding. It's a little too early for the SOBO bubble from Maine which should begin arriving in November.
I considered stopping at Phil's Gap to camp because it is in a lovely grove of trees with nice flat ground cushioned with pine needles, but it felt too early and there is no water source. Finally I decided to stop at a stealth site on Bluff Mountain near Big Rock spring, which was reduced to a trickle but putting out enough water to fill my bottles. Hung my bear bag, made a campfire, tucked in and listened to my audio book until I fell asleep.","Max Patch

Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624130,"A comfortable and uneventful night on a shoulder of Bluff Mountain. While packing up, two section hikers-- Scoops and Einstein--trekked by my campsite. They were a little surprised and stopped to chat for a moment before moving on. I ran across them again filling up at a stream and we ended up hiking together the rest of the day. The terrain was up and down, a little boring, but a shower and food in Hot Springs motivated us. Scoops and Einstein have been sectioning together every April and October for several years. Scoops hopes to finish the entire trail but Einstein will be satisfied to reach West VA. He is retired and has hiked many of the national parks and in other countries so had lots of interesting stories to tell.
We ran across a young bear on the trail but it quickly scampered into the woods when it saw us. When we reached the trailhead next to Laughing Heart Hostel where I'd left my car we made a plan to meet for burgers and beer in town and parted ways. Laughing Heart had a few other backpakers in residence but it wasn't crowded. The rooms are clean and the hostel caretakers are friendly. They shared the story of the property which was once a monastery retreat center with chapel, monk's quarters, an orphanage, and larger home for the priest. The orphanage is now the hostel and the caretaker's quarters were once the monk's quarters. The chapel is now used for weddings and the big home is a B&B. Decor is funky and trail centered. I luxuriated in the shower, relished putting on clean clothes, then headed to town to meet the guys. Delicious food at Iron Horse Tavern, local beer and a guitar duo. Fun to have some company after being solo most of the hike. Really satisfying ending to this section.

Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625172,"Earlier in the season I left the trail at Newfound Gap with intentions to begin again there and get as far as possible before cold weather settled in for the end of 2019. After 2 aborted tries to tidy up my section here I ended up skipping ahead in September and hiking from Davenport into Hot Springs. Well, I managed to find space for a last section hike in late October and decided to patch the hole in my Smoky Mountain section during prime leaf-peeping week. Shelters worked out best going south and I hoped to run into some SOBOs heading to Springer. 
I left my car at Newport Gap, spent a night in Gatlinburg with hubby who dropped me at my start-point to begin stitching the trail together going south. The leaves were vibrant, the trail a carpet of confetti but a carpet that pretty much climbed up out of the gap for 7 miles. 7 miles of step ups. Welcome back to the AT! I reached the side trail to Mt Crammerer fire tower with very little gas left in my legs and 2 miles left to reach my shelter for the night. I thought about by-passing the view--it's an extra .6 in and another .6 out--but ultimately decided I shouldn't miss it. But I did drop my pack in a hidden spot off trail just to give my legs a break. I walked much faster without it and also fueled with worry that a bear would find my pack in the bushes (I'd already seen one.) I reached the tower and found a couple there I'd hiked with earlier, campers visiting from Nevada who were experiencing their first miles on the AT. The view was stunning even with an overcast sky. We talked about the weather warnings we'd heard and wished each other well. On my way back I passed some horseback riders on the trail which surprised me. Evidently there are portions of the AT that overlap GSMNP horse-trails. Found my pack still intact and hightailed it to Cosby knob before the storm.
One other hiker in the shelter, even though the GSMNP site showed it full. Another section hiker, Dennis ""Shoehorn"" from Virginia. He and I spent a little bit of time battening down the tarp and wondering where all the hikers were. He had a transistor radio that picked up blue-grass, a nice background for dinner before hitting the sack. In short time the wind began to scream around us and the skies opened like Niagara Falls. All night it screamed and pounded the tin roof and tried to peel it back while the tarp sucked in and out like a bellows. Our bear bags flew sideways from the cables. Epic storm! No sleep! But we survived, safe and dry in our very sturdy stone shelter.
It turns out the park service had closed the road into the park due to the severe winds (65 mph gusts) and torrential rain. Glad I got in before they closed it down or my 3rd attempt would have been another bust!","Davenport Gap
",Cosby Knob Shelter,"Oct 26, Sat",9
Quillgirl,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/625173,"Shoehorn and I took down our sodden bear bags and took stock of our things. My lighter had filled with water during the storm and he generously gave me his PLUS some waterproof matches just in case. (He is a former navy fighter pilot so being prepared is in his wheelhouse.) Trail magic from other hikers is so appreciated. He was heading off trail and I was just starting my section, so we said our goodbyes and good lucks. The fury of the storm had pretty much stripped most of the red leaves from the trees but many yellow ones held, so the trail looked like a red carpet and the forest glowed golden. Thinking about the difference in late spring and mid autumn in the Smoky Mountains I think Autumn is its most beautiful season, hands down.
The day turned into a beautiful blue-sky trek through a wonderland of big views along the ridges, misty fragrant spruce forests carpeted with moss, orange salamanders and snails among the leaves, tunnels of rhododendrons. Because the roads had been closed and hikers hadn't made it up the slopes, I had the trail to myself nearly all the day through. One of my favorite days on the AT so far.
My shelter reservation at Tri-Corner wasn't too far away so I took more time than usual and stopped for photos, to look at the mist rolling below the peaks, and to savor this last section for the year. When I reached the shelter, again only one other hiker was there. The road closure and weather had pretty well vanquished most everyone who might have had plans for a backcountry weekend. More room for us to spread out in the shelter. Steve ""The Stereo Man"" from Asheville was my companion for the night. He is a waterfall chaser at heart but was trying to finish out his list of 6000 ft peaks in TN to get his patch and recognition. A much calmer night with better sleep this time around.","Cosby Knob Shelter

Stereo Man and I had our breakfast coffee and folded and stuffed our stuff back into our packs. He headed down a side trail and I continued toward Newfound. Looking at the topography I knew this would be a lot of up and down along ridge tops as I got closer to some of the more iconic GSMNP landmarks like Charlie's Bunion, Eagle Rocks, The Saw Teeth. I knew I wouldn't be able to dawdle along because I needed to cover nearly 13.5 miles but I also wouldn't be able to resist photos and stops to look across the peaks.
Another blue-sky day to die for and again, very few people on the trails this high. I know the park is full along the roads below the AT and also on the lower trails but up high it is sparse company with a feeling of having this wild place to yourself when you climb up and stay up. This is what I love most about backpacking in the back country. This section of the GSMNP is very Tolkien worthy inside the spruce and balsam forested areas, always as fragrant as a Christmas tree lot and soft-sculptured with mats of moss and shelves of mushrooms. These places eventually open into views along ridges that are so expansive they appear to be of blue ocean waves. You understand why the Cherokee origin story involves a waterbug that brings up clay from beneath the water to build land when you see mountain peaks that appear like islands above the swirling clouds that move like water between them.
I reached Ice Water shelter early enough to have dinner with my shelter companion from Australia. Charlie aka ""Mule-y"" had made a somewhat last minute decision to take several months off from life to recover from a bad break-up. Hiking a big section of the AT and then visits with expat friends in the USA seemed to be the prescription and she packed her things and found her way. We talked late into the night about her experiences so far on the AT, relationships, travel, and life in general. Very fun company and a lovely person. I hope her heart heals along the trail and the she is lifted up by all the good folks she meets.
Read about the excessive bear activity in the shelter log and remember this one was closed for a while during Spring. A very funny and long entry about a group of hikers who had to resort to collecting an arsenal of stones to throw at a little rowdy gang of bears that kept showing up. What a night that must have been! Grateful that Charlie and I missed all of that.

I took my time over breakfast because today would be a short day down to the parking lot at Newfound Gap. Could I have finished it up yesterday? Yes, but probably with a sense of being pushed through the last part of this hike, which isn't how I wanted it to end. So Charlie and I were up early, had a leisurely coffee in night clothes. I offered most of my remaining interesting food and she took as much as she could carry. 
My usual downhill pace with a nearly empty pack is more than 3 mph, putting me at my car in an hour, so I slowwwwed it down. I took every little side trail to look at views. Suddenly more and more hikers streamed up from below, asking directions to Charlie's Bunion. My visit there had been nearly solo. I arrived late in the day as another couple was leaving but otherwise had it alone to explore. I hear it is usually very crowded. All I can say is it's a long drop from the edges and I can't imagine trying to squeeze around a crowd on the narrow ledges leading up to it.
At a mile before the bottom at Newfound it became downright crowded on the trail and I had to step off over and over to let day hikers in tennis shoes pass by. Many stopped to ask me about my pack and the AT, and I had plenty of time to chat and answer questions. Finally in the parking lot it was surreally mobbed with busses and cars, almost claustrophobic. I found my car and took a slow drive down to Gatlinburg. I stopped to hike some of the lower areas around the Little Pigeon River and found a couple of waterfalls before hitting Gatlinburg for a shower, some BBQ, a cocktail and a soft bed.
