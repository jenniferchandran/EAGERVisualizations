Denver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606341,"In about 80 days I'll be starting my thru-hike of the AT.This hike represents a lot of things to me. Its the fulfillment of a dream that I inherited from my father. I grew up hiking the White Mountains with him and my brother. The Appalachian Trail was something he always talked about wanting to do. It was something that had called to him since his youth, and while he has explored stretches of it through New Hampshire he has never gotten the opportunity to hike its length.When I moved from New Hampshire to Virginia to begin my career I was delighted to find the trail just a short drive from my front door. I've spent an enormous amount of time walking along its length from Big Meadows to Harpers Ferry as well as up and down the blue blazes that intersect it throughout the region. It has become an old friend and place I retreat to when I need to shed stress and get in touch with my thoughts.At this point in my life, the trail represents a path out of the life I've been living to the life I want to live. I started gender transition about three years ago. Ive had wonderful support from friends and coworkers and some family in that effort. I've successfully held onto my career through this and have kept my life from falling apart, but I've reached a place where I feel stagnant and unable to move forward in any meaningful way. I feel stuck, trying to fulfill the expectations of people who knew me before starting this journey. I need a clean break. To go out into the world and re-introduce myself to it as the person I am now. The trail has been a significant source of peace and comfort to me through my transition so it seems like the right place to go to begin this final phase. I hope to emerge on the other side of this experience, wholly and unapologetically myself, having accomplished something big as the person I am now.Finally, the trail represents an opportunity to show my parents that for all the frightening change that I've been undergoing, deep down at my core I'm still the person they raised with the same dreams and aspirations. That the choices that I have been making along this path have not been in an attempt to throw away everything that we have in common and destroy the person they know. I want to show them that I'm still their outdoorsy, determined kid in spite of how I present myself to the world now. I hope that through this accomplishment we can find some healing.When this is over I am looking forward to picking up and moving to begin a new life somewhere else, but right now my focus is fully on the challenge before me. I'm looking forward to sharing my experiences as I go.Thanks!- Heather J.","

Denver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606404,"Got two good training events in this weekend. I try to mix up my routine as much as possible, but due to a bruised bone in my foot I've had to stop running again. That's frustrating to me. I love running. I'm not built for it and its always, always hard, but the sense of accomplishment is unmatched.
Saturday I spent about 3 hours hiking around Great Falls park with my pack loaded with all my gear, partially for the sake of having weight on my back and partially for giving my pack-loading skills a good test. My REI Ridgeline, while being the heaviest single item in my kit, is comfortable and easy to carry. I've had it for about six years now and it's become a good friend. I'm having a hard time deciding if I'm going to upgrade it before I leave. I'm torn on how necessary it is. Upgrading would get my cold-weather base weight to 15 lbs and my summer base weight down to about 12 lbs.
Sunday I broke out the snowshoes thanks to a fresh 6-7 inches of snow. I trudged all the way across town to get coffee, getting first tracks across the golf course and the nature trails at 5am in the morning. I took my time getting back, going around one of the two lakes in my neighborhood, up through the nature center, into the woods, and eventually looping back home. Final mileage was about 7.5 miles for the morning. Unfortunately, I went too hard and now have very painful blisters on the backs of my heels.
I feel foot care is going to be a problem for me on the trail. I tend to push past the point of discomfort and do real damage to myself.

Denver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606451,"Part of the deciding factor for making this the year I ditch everything and go hiking was the belief that I had most everything I would need in terms of gear. I've done plenty of 2-3 day backpacking trips and thought I could easily scale up to a thru hike without a huge financial investment.
And then I become weight obsessed. When you start talking to the hiking community online you quickly learn that ""Ultralight"" is the new thing that everyone aspires to and the way people talk about gear you might come away with the impression that if you're not targeting a sub-20lb pack weight and spending $100s of dollars to shed ounces then you're in for a really bad time on the trail. 
I've always been fairly comfortable hiking with my kit. I have my $60 REI Garage Sale Special Backpack which weighs in close to 5lbs, but has been with me through eight or nine seasons and has never let me down. I have my 3lb Big Agnes 15º sleeping bag. And I have my 3lb Big Agnes MtnGlo tent with the fancy little USB battery pack and LEDs sewn into the seams. These have been the staples of my outdoor adventures for years now. Also, since I'm still a fairly big person, all of my gear tends to be the largest version available in its category.
So when I sat down and started building out my LighterPack and started comparing my projected weights against other people's kits I felt that sting of inadequacy. I now have a pile of gear that will not be coming with me because it got upgraded. I've spent more money then I ever intended to on upgrades, sidegrades, and things I wouldn't have thought to bring in the first place. And I've spent several nights every week packing, weighing, unpacking, re-packing, re-weighing, and tallying up weights. I've had custom items made and sold off things to generate cash to fund further upgrades. Its become a bit of an obsession.
But I'm finally done. At some point I decided that I wasn't willing to make any more trades on comfort and convenience for the sake of a few more ounces. My starting base weight will be around 20lbs. That will drop to about 17lbs when I shed my winter gear. The ultralight-ers would scoff and point out items in my kit that I could do without, but I'm at ease with every item that is in there. As an example, I have a little 5-ounce travel electric shaver in my pack. I haven't finished my laser hair removal treatments and keeping those pesky hairs at bay is important for my mental health.
So with the last of my gear purchased, I'm turning my attention to the details of properly closing out the life I've been living in Northern VA.  73 days to go and still so much to do.

Denver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606616,"I got up early to have coffee with the neighbors before hitting the trail for an 11 mile loop. The goal was to find an out of the way place to set up my shelter.  I've hung the hammock a few times, but my custom hex tarp from UGQ came in a couple weeks ago and Ive been itching to find the time to test it. 
I got off the main trail onto an old mountain bike trail that had been closed down and found two perfectly spaced tree and went about trying to figure everything out.  My hammock is hung with an Eno strap system I got for my old non-backpacking hammock. But what I was really excites to try out was the hanging system for the tarp witch uses two Dutchware Wasps and four tarpworms on shock cords. It all went up really easily and Im really pleased by how easy it is to adjust it.
I continued my hike across the county park and on to the Cross County Trail which was a mess of frozen mud as usual. I had to ford one unexpected marsh and one flooded stream crossing. My feet got wet but thankfully it had warmed up from 22 degrees to about 37 by that point in the day.
By about mile 8 my hips started to complain. This is one of the ""joys"" that hormone therapy has brought me. My hips are sensitive to longer distance hikes in a way that they never were before. I was able to finish out the loop, but I will be sore tomorrow. Ive been walking 5-6 miles 4-5 days a week, but Im going to have to get some more of these longer distance hikes in over the next few weeks if I dont want to be suffering right out of the gate.  Thankfully my pace was decent and I did the whole loop and shelter test in almost exactly 3.5 hours.",,Lake Fairfax - Vienna Loop,"Jan 26, Sat",0
Denver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606792,"I've decided to try swapping out my trusty REI Ridgeline for a more ultralight pack. I picked up a Granite Gear Crown X60 from Massdrop for a really reasonable price. The pack showed up yesterday and I was eager to do a shakedown hike with it.A good friend of mine and mentor of mine met up with me this morning to go through my kit. I really appreciate his insight as he's done more of these kinds of trips then I have. He's lending me his trekking poles, a dry bag, and a Kindle for the trail. I also got some free advice on supplements and some overall encouragement which is very appreciated.I moved everything over to the new pack and headed over to Great Falls for some hiking. It was perfect out. About 32 degrees and all the trails were still snow covered. My favorite hiking conditions. I wandered through the woods for about 7 miles, crossing the ridge a few times to get some uphills in.I had some reservations about the Granite Gear pack because I'm used to my much more substantially constructed REI pack. The straps are thinner, there is less padding, and the frame sheet is not comparable to an internal metal aluminum frame. But once I got everything adjusted it seemed to ride just fine. The body of the pack seems have more lateral movement then I'm used to, but this wasn't something you really felt when in motion. It did seem as though it was pressing on my lower back more then I'd like, but I'm going to adjust it some more for my next hike. Its shaves almost 2.5 lbs off my base weight so Im going to try to make it work.I've also decided to move up my start date to avoid being in the busiest part of the bubble. I can't leave any sooner then the third week of March, but that still puts me slightly ahead of peak traffic.",,View Entry,"Feb 02, Sat",0
Denver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607078,"I resigned from my job yesterday. This was difficult. I love a lot about my job and I've had many wonderful experiences over the past 6 and a half years. In spite of all the stress and long hours and lackluster pay, the work has remained rewarding. I never woke up with a sinking feeling that I had to go to the office. I am also eternally grateful to the ownership and staff for their support during my coming out and first steps of transition.I've felt personally stuck for a while now, and restlessness to me signals that it's time for a major change. The next four weeks will be about cleaning up things at the office so my responsibilities can be passed off to someone else. At the same time I still have a ton of work to do to wind down my life in VA.My gear prep is mostly done, but there is still some tweaking im doing. I switched out my hammock suspension for amsteel whoopie slings last night. My Eno Helios whoopies were fraying badly and were too short so I upgraded them.Im down with a cold this weekend so no training today.",,View Entry,"Feb 16, Sat",0
Denver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607443,"21 days til I hit the trail!I am equal parts excited and terrified. I made a preparation check-list that I've been slowly marking items off of as I close down my life in Virginia. There's a lot to it. Things like...what do you do when you're keeping your vehicle, but moving it to another state to store, but not the state that you intend to be living in when you return which is also not the state the car is registered in currently?Plane ticket is booked and next week I change my mailing address to Arvada, CO! Next week is all about my resupply boxes.Im struggling with the new pack. While I really like the philosophy and weight savings of the Granite Gear pack, I feel its putting strange pressure on my lower back that has left me in a great deal of pain after short training hikes.  My old reliable REI pack is bigger, heavier but so much more comfortable. Its got a thicker hip belt and has longer shoulder straps. It also has better air circulation between my back and the pack body.Im trying one last series of adjustments to the Granite Gear before biting the base-weight bullet reverting to the old pack. That will put my base weight above 22lbs, which is not what I was hoping for. I am comforted only by the fact that once I drop my winter gear I will be back down around 17lbs base weight.",,View Entry,"Feb 28, Thu",0

Denver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608611,"Well friends, I am on the trail and it is difficult. Yesterday I got dropped off at Amicalola Falls State Park and started walking around 2. Made it to my first stop at Black Wood Gap Shelter where I made camp for the night just short of Springer Mtn. The wind came in around 5 and howled all night long. I did not sleep well. I got up early and hiked the final 1.5 miles to the top of Springer to officially start the AT itself. Today was a lovely hike through rhododendron groves and along Mtn streams. Only one major climb but it still kicked my ass. I fear my level of physical fitness is lacking. I'm also having some trouble with my right leg. I've called it quits at mile 8.1 at Hawk My Shelter. I intend to rest, get sleep, and take some Advil to see if it helps the leg.

I unfortunately was unable to get a fuel canister before leaving Atlanta. I could really go for some meat or some soup right now but all I have is dry food until I get to Neel's Gap.

I hope I can stick this out.","Black Wood Gap Shelter

Climbed Sassafrass mountain and met some people from the local Baptist Church who gave me an apple. I had already planned to go to Gooch Gap for the day's hike and apparently that's where they had some trail magic setup. A kitchen churning out dinner and breakfast for hikers.  So that's where I am now. Sitting in a chair, feeling pretty good after a fast and better day then the one before. And I get it food tonight!

It was 14.2 miles from Gooch Gap to Neal's Gap with Blood Mountain, the first 4000 footer of the AT at the northern end of the stretch. After hitting Woods Gap at 3.5 miles in I started pacing this guy ""Josef from Jersey"". We ended up doing almost the whole need 11.7 miles together.  The weather was amazing, the views from Blood Mountain amazing, and I feel extremely accomplished. Coming over that mountain in the rain would have been a nightmare.Tonight I am holed up in a hotel in Blairsville, GA to wait out the rain. Splitting the room with Josef. I'm going to have to give away some of my resupply. I have 2 days of food still in the bag. It's been hard to eat the first few days.","Gooch Gap

Denver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608900,"First off, I want to say that I do read my guest book and I absolutely appreciate the words of encouragement and the fact that people are following along. Thank you!

But here's the report....
I'm back on the trail after two nights in lovely Blairsville, GA. Josef and I were joined by Hot Sauce, Nick, & Keagan for our second night. We got laundry done, resupplied. I changer out a lot of my food because I realized the stuff I had brought was too difficult for me to eat. I gave away what I could and dropped off the rest in the hiker box at Mountain Crossing this morning before starting. 
We were in the clouds all morning. I climbed out of Neal's Gap with Josef. I'm not sure when I lost him, but I ended up alone for at least an hour. Other hikers would emerge from the mist periodically but I was mostly alone. At one point I stepped out on a ledge and took out my camera to take a picture of most drifting across the rock and as I did the clouds parted and revealed the whole range spread before me. It was great. I was in amazing spirits today and kept on rolling until about 2, ending my day at Low Gap Shelter.
My new knee brace is doing an amazing job and I'm just really pleased with how I felt today. No one from my group arrived for almost an hour and forty-five minutes.","Neal's Gap

Denver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608988,"Last night the rain came in just after I finished my journal post. It turned the whole area around the Low Gap Shelter to mud. Seeing it wouldn't let up, I curled up in the hammock and read until I fell asleep.

In the morning I had to deal with wet gear for the first time. That wasn't pleasant. I got everything packed up and hit the trail, abandoning my tramily with a plan of walking a short day to Blue Mountain Shelter and drying everything out.

The terrain was easy for the first 5 miles but the last two we're rocky and rooty and narrow. Still, I covered the ground quickly and made the shelter by 1230. 

Tonight I'm sleeping in the shelter because it's gonna be cold. Tomorrow will be a really difficult day. 

Rocky and Tray mountains await.","Low Gap Shelter

Denver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609057,"Longest day yet...
I set out from Blue Mountain Shelter this morning after a glorious sunrise. Had to leave the tramily behind today. Josef and Keagan were both heading to town to nurse their injuries. Nick and Hot Sauce were going to keep going but didn't have a destination in mind. We all agreed to meet up at Dick's Creek Gap in 2 days one way or another.
I descended to Unicoi Gap after crossing the summit of Blue Mountain and began to climb Rocky Mountain. Ran into a trail worker near the summit and chatted with her while she dug out a waterbar. Continued on over the summit and entered the rhododendron tunnels from Indian Grave Gap to Tray Gap before the final ascent of Tray Mountain for the highest elevation of the day. I stopped at a very empty Tray Mountain Shelter for lunch and decided to push on. I thought I might attempt to get to Deep Gap Shelter, but figured if I didn't make it that would be okay too. 
The trail after Tray Mountain was pretty featureless...wandering from gap to gap along the ridge. I ran into a couple hikers and at some point decided I might as well go all the way to Deep Gap. I stopped before the final ascent at Adis Gap to check on a blister and take stock of the situation. With just 1.9 miles to go I was out of water, and the final climb was up yet another 4000 foot peak, the 4th of the day. But I decided to go for it.
That turned out to be the worst climb of them all. It felt like it was going straight up the mountainside. It didn't help that I was already footsore and stumbling. Still, I dragged myself over the top and rolled the .9 miles down to the shelter, stopping at the water source to drink my fill and fill up for camp.
Dinne was Mountain House Chicken Teriyaki and Vegetables and Rice. It was delicious. And now I'm bundled in my hammock anticipating an easy day to Dick's Creek Gap and the Top of Georgia Hostel. Only 10 miles til I'm done with this state.","Blue Mountain Shelter

Pat (another hiker I've been chasing) was sitting there waiting for a shuttle back to Blairsville to go to the urgent care facility. Apparently he was coming off trail due to foot issues. Managed to hop into his already paid for shuttle as they were going through Hiawassee on the way. I was happy not to stay around ToG as they're starting to develop a negative reputation.
I spent the rest of the day in town hanging around Hiawassee. Cute town. Checked in at the hiker friendly Budget Inn, did laundry while waiting for my room and took a shower. Wandered to Ingles to complete my resupply and got some ice coffee. Hot Sauce and Nick caught up to me later in the afternoon and came down to join me at the hotel. Plan is to get back on the trail in the morning. Joseph and Keegan left in the morning back to Unicoi to begin the section I just completed.","Deep Gap Shelter

We got the 9 am shuttle from the hotel back up to Dick's Creek Gap. Nick had to run down the hill to ToG to pick up his new sleeping bag so we waited for him to get back before heading out.
A short hike and one long climb took us to Plumorchard Shelter, one of the coolest shelters we e passed and the last shelter in the Georgia stretch. It's a triple decker with three floors that had been placed on the mountain by a Chinook helicopter. We made a fire and hung out for the afternoon.

We passed the NC/GA state line about 4 miles into the day. Joseph stopped to take off his rain coat. I went around the corner to Bly Gap to wait. I waited for about 15 minutes before pressing on. Josef is a strong hiker and I expected him to catch up. NC greeted me with a howling wind through the Gap and back to back vertical ascents up into the 4k feet range. It's was a brutal introduction that didn't improve until I passed the Muskrat Creek Shelter. Even then the whole section felt like a remix of all the worst terrain of the past 10 days. I popped out of the woods at Deep Gap (NC) just as the Baltimore Jack's hostel van was pulling up. Knowing the cold was coming it was all I could do to keep from flagging then down. It was only .9 miles to the shelter to end my day though so I pushed on to the flank of Standing Indian mountain. Tomorrow I will walk over it's summit at 5400 feet, the highest peak yet.
For now I am huddled in the shelter as the mercury drops. Hot Sauce and Nick made it up along with Ziggy. Josef apparently bailed at Deep Gap due to hip issues. I'm worried about that guy.","Plumorchard Gap Shelter

Truthfully I was miserable and considering quitting for most of the day. I was scared of the cold and the wind was chilling. I figured if I stayed with others today it would buoy my spirits.
Today was a drastic difference. If yesterday's hike was a brutal welcome to NC, today's was an apology for that welcome. The ascent to the summit of Standing Indian was gentle switchbacks the whole way followed by a meandering decent to Carter Gap. We had lunch in the shelter and pressed on to Betty Creek to camp. The trail dropped into a rhododendron tunnels that ran along a narrow ridge. At breaks in the rhododendron you could see down into the valley. It was some of the best views we've had so far on the trip. Descended to the rhododendron groves of Betty Creek Gap where I am sharing Nick's, now Prometheus, tent for the night to keep warm.

My heal got a cut so I stopped to tape it up and continued on. A guy at Mooney Gap was hanging out homemade cookies. Took one for the climb up Albert Mountain. The final .3 miles to the summit was best vertical but was still a lot of fun. Crested the top and took some time to take pictures on and around the fire tower. While the tower isn't really the 100 mile mark, it's close enough that it's the best landmark to celebrate at. Rest of the day was meandering down to Rock Gap and the world's most exposed privy....

There was a lady handing out carrots and hard boiled eggs by the road and my hiking buddies we're ready to be done so we called the last 3.7 miles and waited for the shuttle to Franklin, NC to show up.

That was a less then pleasant climb with a resupplied backpack weight, but it went quickly. Crossed the highway at Winding Stair and as I stepped across these little log bridges in the trail I managed to come up short slightly. There was an audible pop from my left calf muscle and pain bad enough that it roiled my stomach. Nick heard me yell and came back to check on me. We sat for a few minutes while I weighed my options. We were at the road. I could go back into town, but I really didn't want to. Finally I got up and decided to go on. The plan was to get to the Silas Bald Shelter to wait out the rain so we pushed on.

I gashed my arm to the elbow and was just covered in mud. Hot Sauce looked at me sadly and said ""It's gonna be a good day"". She headed back to the shelter and I heard her yell as she also slipped in the mud and went down. So now we're both covered in mud and laughing but really I'm about to cry. I'm muddy, cold, injured, and I don't know what to do. I really wanted to go back to town at this point. We sat in the shelter until about 11 and decided to leave when the rain finally let up.

I worked my way up to Copper Ridge Bald and spent the next hour and a half winding around the peaks along the ridge. It was really nice and I was feeling more myself again.
I even ran into @nurse4rocks who I've been following on Instagram.
Stopped to have lunch at Tellico Gap before the final ascent to Wesser Bald. Wesser Bald itself wasn't too bad of a climb. I ran into a trail runner I had seen at Rock Gap a couple days before and then I climbed the observation tower at the top for some really amazing 360 degree views. The last .8 miles were an easy descent to the shelter. Stopped to get water at a nice cistern fed by a spring.

As the afternoon wore on we packed more and more people into the shelter while some people made camp in the rain.  The rain did not let up until just after daybreak.","The NOC

Denver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610104,Today was not like yesterday. My legs felt leaden and every climb seemed to go straight up each mountain. Arrived at Stecoah Gap to find two older guys setting up trail magic. Had an apple and a Yoohoo or two and sat around while friends found their way down to the Gap. Took off just street 1pm and o do the Jacob's Ladder climb. That was difficult but rewarding once you were over the top.

Denver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610106,"Woke up at dawn determined to get to Fontana before the post office closed. I'd had my tent shipped to me to replace my hammock. It had just been too cold for the hammock which is why I've been shelter hopping. I also had Big Agnes send me a warranty replacement for my sleeping mat which has been losing air overnight causing me to have to blow it back up every night. Finally, I'd had a 5 day resupply shipped in to get me through the smokies.I left camp at about 730 and pushed hard. The first half of the hike was really nice with rolling, easy slopes and great views. Once you hit Cable Gap shelter the trail turned uphill hard and there was a pretty significant climb to the top of the ridge overlooking Fontana Dam. The descent proved even more difficult and was punishing on my knees. I dropped down onto the road and checked the time. 12:20. I'd made it in less then 5 hours. The shuttle pulled up within minutes and by 1pm I was at the post office and had my packages. I sat on the front porch and reorganized my new supply of food and my new equipment and shipped off my replaced gear. The. I hit the general store for a drink and some additional resupply items before wandering down to the pit stop for two chili dogs.  Then I caught the shuttle back to the Marina and walked the final 1.1 miles in to the Fontana Dam Shelter where I took a shower, did laundry...in the shower, and set myself up to wait for my friends.  They never showed up because they bailed at the marina and went to the village to spend the night. So I'm alone tonight without them. They want to zero tomorrow...but I'm ready for the smokies. I haven't decided what I will do.","Brown Fork Gap Shelter

It was a tough decision to go push on on my own, but I decided I needed to do it. I pushed the 14.9 miles in to Russell Field Shelter in the Smokies. I crossed the Fontana Dam and dropped my permit in the iron ranger and began a long climb. I was mostly by myself today though I ran into Dishwater and Two Sticks at a couple intervals. I ran out of water and was parched by the time I strumbled into a Gap with some water. I sat there to eat lunch and heard a noise behind me. A massive black board and about nine piglets came running down the trail before veering into the woods just before the gap. That was definitely a new experience.Made it to Russell Gap Shelter around 230. There are a bunch of Carolina good ol' boys here for the night, but there was room for me and with rain in the forecast I'm happy to be in the shelter. Tomorrow I plan to do 15.5 miles or so. I'm considering going to Gatlinburg on Saturday if I can get over Clingman's Dome. That will give Joe, Prometheus, and Hot Sauce time to catch up.I miss my tramily.","Fontana Dam Shelter

Denver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610379,"Day started out with light rain which quickly intensified to driving rain and wind as I started the climb up Rocky Top and Thunderhead Mountain. It intensified the higher up I got. I passed Redbeard and his son near the top of Rocky Top. Everyone looked pretty miserable. As I started down the other side of Thunderhead, a mountain that I spent my whole time on praying it wouldn't live up to it's name, the trail was a river with little waterfalls spilling off of every step, rock, and root. The rain stopped shortly after I started my descent, but the water was with me for a while. The rest of the ridge was constant up and down. It was perhaps as difficult as the climb the day before. I made it to Derrick Knob Shelter where Brother Bear and his crew we're waiting out the day, planning to night hike. There was also a very annoyed looking Ridge Runner standing around out side. She clearly was unhappy to be there. The next six miles to Silers Bald Shelter we're rough. The trail was thick muck. The kind that sucks at your shoes and makes walking take extra effort. My feet were wet and I was starting to chafe badly. I was pretty unhappy. And with 2 miles to go to the shelter I started to see bears. The first one popped up as I was taking a break on an incline. Looking back down the trail I was in time to see a massive black bear walk up onto the trail. I quickened my pace and made it about half a mile down the trail before seeing another one down off the trail to my right. I made the final mile and a half to the shelter and was surprised to find it empty...except for Two Sticks who was going to press onward. My feet told me that we were not doing the same. I sat alone at the shelter and made dinner and got ready for bed. I was almost ready to crawl in for the night when other hikers started showing up including, Dishwater, Redwood, Cricket, Nemo, Pippy, Salamander, Redbeard and son, and Kitty.

She noticed us I think and tried to pick up her pace, but com'on....we're bears. You're not gonna get away. Anyway...long story short we caught up with her and she had nicely packaged herself into one of those three sided bear feeders they put up here for us. And bonus! She had brought about 11 friends so we ate soooo well... 10/10 would feast again.Nah, I'm good. Left the shelter at about 745 and headed for Clingmans Dome. Big landmark and was excited to get there. Got some good sunrise photos from the saddle between Clingmans and Silers Bald. When I reached the next shelter I was delighted to find a gentleman and his son had set up shop and we're serving coffee, fruit, donuts, and mimosas for breakfast. Heaven!Leaving the shelter after about an hour of sitting around, eating and chatting, I headed off to begin the ascent of the Dome. We quickly entered an honest to God pine Forest. It was amazing. Like being home in NH. The air smelled like fresh pine and the ground had that bouncy pine needles underfoot feeling. Everything was covered in thick moss. It was truly magical. The climb really wasn't so bad considering the past couple days and It was exciting to have views at every vista. The clouds were staying out of the way and while it was heavily overcast, there was only a couple of raindrops. Reaching the top I was excited to walk the spiral walkway to the observation tower. There were plenty of people around who had come up the auto road for the views, and it was hard not to feel a little smug having walked 200 miles to earn my vistas. I felt like a mythic hero walking among mere mortals. ((Shhhh...let me have this.))I spent a lot of the past couple days thinking. The smokies feel different then everything that has come before. Everything feels older...ancient. And while you focus on conquering each peek and ridegeline, you're only on top for a moment and these mountain will outlive every hiker that ever has or will climb to their summits. It's humbling.The rest of the day was spent rambling the 7.7 miles down to Newfound Gap. Weather warnings for Sunday had been echoed by every person we had met so the plan had been formed to escape the mountains for Sunday. I had no sooner popped my hedge over the ridge at Newfound Gap when a woman walked over from the parking lot to ask if I needed a ride to town. We waited for my hotel buddies for the night, Manifest and Frodo, to catch up before all piling into her car for a ride down to Gatlinburg.Driving down the mountain we got our best look yet at the fire damage from 2 years ago. It's awesome inspiring how much was destroyed. Almost every slope had some large section covered in skeletal charred trees, standing like twisted finger bones against the sky.Our wonderful benefactor dropped us off at the Day's Inn at the top of the Gatlinburg strip. This is a noisy silly place, but I'm happy to be safe off the mountain for a day. I'll be back on Monday and I'm going to try to reach Standing Bear in 2 days.","Silers Bald Shelter

About 25 hikers milled about at the NOC outfitter waiting for a shuttle and news that the road had been reopened. I had a chicken biscuit and was very happy to wait.As soon as we got word that it was clear the shuttle from the Baptist Church loaded as many as they could and we were off. The Newfound Gap we were dropped at was not the one we had left. Everything was covered in ice and the wind was howling through the Gap. Everyone raced for the bathrooms to pile on the layers. I debated even heading out and felt maybe I should return to town, but as each hiker disappeared into the woods I decided to follow.The terrain after Clingmans Dome is completely different then everything that had come before. We were now rolling along ridges above 5000 feet. The elevation changes were easier and we were surrounded by pines covered in wind blowing ice. It felt like we were walking through a crystal fairytale forest. I took a ton of pictures of ice encrusted trees and snowy peaks.  In spite of the appearance of the trees, the ground itself was not frozen and there was little ice on the path. I made good time past the first two shelters and decided to push for the third. I arrived just past 5 pm to find a large group already there. Thankfully there was still plenty of room in the shelter. I love shelters. I had a hasty dinner and stripped out of my sweaty clothes and crawled into bed. The temperature was dropping and I was already chilled. I ended up throwing on my rain she'll to trap a little extra heat and eventually stopped shivering. Around 930 I was awoken by a headlamp in my eyes and a voice announcing that it was from the park service. Two paramedics were peering in on us, apparently looking for someone who had called 911 from the shelter 10 hours earlier. The distressed hiker turned out to be sleeping in a tent behind the shelter and the paramedics were able to wake him and assess the situation. He was suffering from severe muscle spasms and was unable to walk out of the park without assistance. The two rescuers debated plans for getting the man out while they made dinner and then they crawled into the shelter to sleep until daylight.","Newfound Gap

I wanted to make the push all the way out of the park today to Standing Bear Hostel. I made excellent time. It was a little strange watching as the pine forests began to give way to the kinds of forests we'd been seeing before Clingmans, but the trail was not too difficult and was mostly downhill, dropping from 6000 down to about 1700 over the course of the day. I left the park behind at Davenport Gap and followed Pigeon Branch down towards the I-40 crossing. Just before passing over the river I encountered double trail magic, two groups handing out candy, sodas, and hotdogs. Gave me just enough fuel to make the 1.8 miles to the hostel.Standing Bear is an interesting place. They sign you in and hand you a piece of paper that serves as your tab. It seems like it's a major hangout for the locals. While rough around the edges I actually really enjoyed the place.

I had raised the idea of camping on Max Patch at the campfire last night but no one seemed interested, so I assumed I'd be alone.Today was hard...physically and emotionally. I'm having some post-smokies depression. I miss my tramily who are now 3 days behind me. I'm struggling with making progress with my presentation out here. I feel I'm just gross and smelly all the time and that doesn't really help you feel very attractive which is a strange desire when you're on the trail...but an ever present one for me. The climbs today we're challenging. I took a rest at the top of Snowbird Mtn to admire the views, eat breakfast, and chat with some day hikers. Then it was just rolling on. The trail kept dropping down to gaps only to climb straight up the next hill. The last set of climbs to Max Patch were extremely difficult and water was scarce. I filled it with extra water at a stream before the summit and push the last .8 miles up the stairs to the Bald summit.  Instant gratification upon reaching the top. Max Patch is an intense place to be on a beautiful day. 360 degree views of the Smokies and the trail ahead. The grass is mowed and it's just a great place to sprawl out and soak in the views. My plan was to sit up here, camp, and watch the sunset. There was already a group of tents set up at the top so I wasn't alone in my idea.Slowly hikers who had been at the hostel began to filter in as I made dinner and now we have a tent city up here on the Bald. Seems like the views and the difficult climbs made my idea all that more attractive after all.Watched the sunset and am now laying in my tent watching the lights come on in the valley below.","Standing Bear Hostel

So I'm stuck here in town because with the current temps and weather, if I go back out I will get pneumonia. On top of that, I've been having a lot of trouble lately. I'm having a hard time finding the motivation to continue. I miss work. I am eager to go to Denver. I'm not having a bad time out here, but it's becoming hard to justify spending several more months on the trail I'm also having some more personal issues out here. Being trans on the trail has it's challenges, especially when you're mid-transition. My presentation is kind of a mess. It's hard to feel like I'm making a positive difference when I'm filthy, smelly, and about as far from feeling feminine as one could imagine.Bottom line...this hasn't been the best weekend.

I just couldn't bring myself to walk past the outfitters. Joe was with me. He was headed out of Hot Springs too, but for whatever reason I decided not to. My health has been rough, though I've been on the upswing. My body is in good shape. I'm not having difficulty with the terrain. But my head and heart are definitely elsewhere. I don't feel I'm done with this trail, but I do feel I need to step away from it for a while.

So what now... Well, I hitched into Asheville and found a direct flight to Denver for tomorrow. That's right.....I'm going to Denver to see my nephew and my brother. I'm going to try to get up to Rocky Mountain National Park for a few days. 
Right now I'm feeling like I'd like to come back after a little time away and pick up with the AT again, but I don't really know what will happen. I want to hike with my friends again. Maybe I'll return for trail days in Damascus.

I'm disappointed in myself to some extent. This is purely a mental/emotional decision. I didn't quit on a bad day. They've all been really good days. I haven't had a bad day since Wayah Bald. It just seemed like I was presented with two paths and one opened up to me while the other was closed. Either way, I couldn't sit in Hot Springs another day.

After I landed in Asheville I managed to find an Uber willing to drive me 46 miles to the middle of nowhere. I ran to a gas station to buy two new water bottles first and then summoned a ride. Gentleman picked me up at the terminal and off we went into the night.
He dropped me at a very dark Sams Gap about 50 feet from the Tennessee border. My initial plan had been to night hike but I quickly remembered Im afraid of the dark and also I was fairly exhausted. So I backtracked out of the woods and made camp in a ditch about ten feet off the interstate.
Sleep proved impossible due to the constant truck traffic on the highway. I laid in the tent until about 615 am before breaking camp and heading out.
The first 6.5 miles went well as I climbed up to Big Bald Mtn. But after I passed over the summit my body betrayed me. I slowed down to a shuffle. My knees didn't want to cooperate and my feet hurt and I was just tired from not sleeping.
I began to reevaluate my plans to hike 18 miles to the next shelter. Thankfully I'd been able to get ahold of Prometheus who was only a few miles behind. His plan was to hike to Spivey Gap and shuttle to Erwin. He would then slack pack the final 11 miles the next day. This plan started to look attractive to me and I decided to go with them. However, when I got to Spivey Gap it was only 130 and the shuttle wasnt due until 4pm. And furthermore the sky had darkened and there was dramatic thunder and lightning. I decided to try to hitch to town rather then wait.
I'd been standing at the gap for about 15 minutes and hadn't seen a single car go by, but decided to give it a shot anyway. I found a spot visible to drivers coming around the curve and stuck my thumb out when I finally heard someone coming.
A beat up pickup truck stopped in the middle of road and the driver pointed as if to confirm which direction I was heading. I told him I wanted to go to Erwin and he waved for me to get in. I tossed my pack and poles into the bed of the truck and climbed in the cab.
The driver was a older-looking guy with several missing teeth and a heavy southern accent. He immediately started talking and didn't stop the whole trip. It was hard to tell what he was saying at first as he talked very fast. On the seat beside him was a 3 month old pitbull puppy who immediately climbed into my lap and made himself comfortable.
My driver's name was ""Click"" and he was a moonshiner on his way to town with his latest batch which he offered for me to taste. I declined politely. He spent the better part of the trip telling me about his ten month stint in Federal prison and all of the prison rules and unwritten laws. Every so often he would punctuate his story with a pointed look at me...and every time he did he would nearly swerve off the road. I just kept petting the puppy and trying to be engaged and not think about how narrow the road was and how deep the ditch on either side was.
We finally got to town and he dropped me at a gas station and as I climbed out of the truck he gave me a fist bump and said ""Remember, Jesus loves you."" And then he sped off.
I hiked the final mile to Uncle Johnny's Hostel and checked in for the night, opting to tent once again. Then I waited for Prometheus and Little Debbie to shuttle in and we all went downtown on the shuttle to get dinner. We met up with Hot Sauce for the ride back and got to spend the evening with the core of my Tramily.
Now I'm laying in my tent listening to the river and looking forward to an easier day tomorrow which is also the start of Erwin's annual hiker festival which kicks off tomorrow with a chili cook-off.

I was feeling really good after longer miles the previous day and rolled along just fine over the couple of smaller peaks between me and Hughes Gap. 
Crossing the road at Hughes Gap was when the day got interesting though. The climb up 6190' ft Roan Mtn was long and every few hundred feet the forest changed. The higher you climbed the more the big trees gave way to scraggly short bent trees. You started to see more pine mixed in. I climbed to a small rocky summit and was granted a reprieve at Ash Gap, a beautiful flat section with grass growing among the trees. I found Wyld Violet here and stopped to have lunch before continuing my climb.
From Ash Gap, the forest was wholly taken over by spruce trees. It felt like I was back in the Smokies. The trail became rocky and the light beneath the fir trees was darker. The trail snaked upward, weaving back and forth as it climbed. When I finally reached the top I felt more accomplished then I had on any other climb thus far. I turned towards the nearby parking lot at the top of the still closed auto road to find a group of hikers taking a break near the bathrooms. The park service had left a stall open for hikers, but everything else was locked up until the start of the season. I relaxed for a bit and refilled my water bottles before heading for the shelter, finding it empty when I arrived, but that didn't last long as it started to rain and before long other hikers were filtering in to get out of the wet, including Hot Sauce and Prometheus.
The area around the shelter was beautiful and I was really glad to stay there for the night. The rain moved out and the light from the sunset filtered down through the mist that swirled through the pines, making for some stunning pictures.","Apple Orchard Campsite

Denver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612923,"This was a section I had been looking forward to since starting the trail and the Roan Highlands did not disappoint.
I left the shelter in a wave of other hikers. The first couple of miles meandered through the Spruce forest as the trail descended from the top of the mountain. It let out onto a road at a mountain pass where there was a bathroom rest area. Then it climbed up to Round Bald where I was able to look out over both NC and TN. The clouds on the NC side we're far below us, settled in the valleys several thousand feet below.
Pressing on, I climbed to another Bald and then the trail began a long descent to a shelter around 5 miles in. Another 1.9 miles brought me to the Overmountain Shelter but I decided not to go check it out, beginning another climb. About halfway up I turned and was able to look down on the shelter. Overmountain Shelter is a converted big red Barn sitting at the foot of a clearing that stretches up the mountain. It's an impressive structure and very unique for an AT shelter.
I continued the climb, eventually making it to what I thought was the top...
But what I had climbed was Little Hump mountain and reaching it's summit revealed Hump Mountain beyond. From where I was standing it seemed impossibly huge, filling the sky beyond the peak where I was standing. I abandoned my plan to sit and have lunch until I had conquered this new challenge and headed off.
The climb was long and exposed. Hump mountain is bald for the entire length that you are on it. It stretches up and up and up and taunts you with false summits. Even when you reach the fence near the top you find another few hundred yards of climbing to reach the summit. I reached it just behind Pumpkin and found a bunch of faces that I hadn't seen since Hot Springs. I sat and had lunch and chatted before the group headed out for Roan Mtn, TN.
We had barely gotten below the Bald when the sky opened up. It rained hard for about 15 minutes forcing the pack covers and rain jackets to come out. I had just purchased the pack cover in Erwin and was grateful to have it.
The last 5 miles to the road went quickly and I reached it with a small group of other hikers. A few of us grouped up and hitched a ride into town for resupply and BBQ. Both went really well. Finished the day out at The Station Hostel which is really really nice and run by a native New Hampshire-ite. Hot Sauce and Prometheus made it in as well but Hot Sauce is sick and is going to the doctor tomorrow.

I apologize for not keeping up with my posts. I'm going to condense the past several days into one post and try to be more regular going forward. 
I'm sure many of you have heard of the tragic murder that hit the trail over the weekend. This is a rare but sobering incident and it has really put a damper on the whole community out here. We still don't know names of the victims and we all fear it may be someone we know. For now at least I am safe as are my immediate trail family.
I left the Station at 19E without Hot Sauce and Prometheus because Hot Sauce had come down with bronchitis and had to go to the Dr. I wanted to get ahead of the weather and make some miles so I got a late start after a fantastic breakfast in Roan Mtn, TN. I was feeling ambitious and made it 18.4 miles to Moreland Gap Shelter, outdistancing most of the people I had hiked with over the previous days. It was a miserable night in the shelter, as it was too hot to sleep and there was a bear roaming the hillside up above, though he never came down to the shelter. 
I woke up early with my sites on the Boots Off Hostel at Lake Watauga in Hampton, TN. I made the 14.9 miles in good time, passing by Laurel Falls and climbing the inconveniently placed Pond Mtn. I got there just in time for BBQ and got a tent site for the night. 
The next day I decided to zero at Boots Off to allow my friends to catch up little and also to hide from the rain. Had a really nice time just reading and enjoying their super cool shower.
It was still raining the next day but I had to leave and at least make a few miles. I did 9.1 miles to Vandeventer Shelter and got there just in time to beat the rain. And it rained so hard. The shelter got packed as did the limited tent space. I slept great and got out early the next day.
I did a fast 12.2 and emerged at a parking lot where two camper vans were setup handing out trail magic. They were making grilled cheese sandwiches and it may have been the best thing I've eaten since I started the trail. I lingered too long and eventually they offered to take any interested hikers back to their camp for the night for drinks, free showers, free dinner and camping. I caved. I figured I could still make up the miles the next day and with trail days not until Friday I had plenty of time to reach Damascus.
I spent the night with the Riff Raff crew at their annual pre-trail days encampment. I had a few drinks and crashed in my tent. Slept great.
I got up and packed to go, hoping for an early shuttle back to the trail. That was not to be however. What I did get was coffee and pancakes and that was pretty fantastic. By the time we got a shuttle it was about 945 and it took us until 1030 to get back to the trail. I hopped out eager to make my miles. First leg was through a field, complete with cows. The day was cool but honestly perfect and the miles went by so fast. I crossed the state line into VA at about 530 and made camp a little outside of town at a camping spot. 20.5 miles. A new record. Tomorrow I'm looking forward to walk down into town for breakfast and some RnR.
The sad thing is that Prometheus has decided to leave the trail so I will most likely be saying goodbye to him tomorrow as our little trail family begins to splinter. I may go to DC with Hot Sauce on Monday.","The Station at Route 19E

Denver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613719,"Hey Team! I'm at Trail Days in Damascus this weekend. I will be hiking out on Sunday, but I realized there was one thing I have forgotten to include in my updates over the past couple of weeks.
I got my trail name! Thanks to my escape to Colorado a couple of weeks ago I have earned the trail name ""Denver"". I am now seeking someone named ""Omelette"" to hike with so that we can form a dream team hiking duo ""Denver Omelette"".","

Denver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614261,"Leaving Damascus alone without Hot Sauce or Prometheus was one of my hardest days on the trail since I came back. The terrain wasn't too difficult, but I felt really alone and lethargic from sitting in town for 4 days. I pushed on though.I encountered wonderful Trail Magic at the first road crossing. A guy named Wheels was standing next to a bridge handing out sodas and grilling burgers. I wasn't going to stop, but the burgers smelled really good so I eventually took my pack off. I didn't stay long though.Pushing on the trail ran parallel to the Virginia Creeper trail for a while before winding up a mountain only to rejoin the Creeper Trail on the other side.In spite of my late start I got to the shelter around 4:45. Looking around I realized that I didn't know any of these faces at all. All my friends are ahead or off trail. Still ... It's an opportunity to meet some new people.It stormed over night but I was very comfy in my tent.","Damascus

Denver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614263,"Id been waiting for this section for a long time. The Grayson Highlands are iconic as are the wild ponies that live there and I was excited to see what all the excitement is about. The climb to Buzzard Rocks wasn't too bad, but the weather was threatening to turn. Reaching the first summit it was drizzling lightly, but as I made my way down to Elk Garden the rain went away and blue skies took over.
The next climb was great, winding it's way back by up into a pine Forest. I ran by into one of the vendors from trail days that I had bought a hiking skirt from. We chatted for a bit but the summit was calling so I pressed on.
Just below the summit of Mt. Rogers (the highest peak in VA), the landscape opened up into mountain fields and pine groves. Signs of the ponies we're everywhere but I didn't actually see any until I climbed past the beautiful Thomas Knob Shelter and reached the crest of the highlands.
The trail wound through a series of protected little valleys along the ridge where ponies we're clustered in groups of 5 - 10, grazing. I even saw a longhorn steer laying out in the grass of a bald peak.
I was able to get close enough to the ponies to take pictures. They're not really afraid of people at all and will willingly approach you if you let them.
Continuing on, I encountered a trail work crew working on the trail and much to my surprise Unicorn and NAB were among them, getting some volunteer trail work in before they flip up to Maine to finish their hike SOBO.
By the time I reached the shelter below the highlands my feet were tired. It's hard not to feel competitive when other people are pressing on and you're done for the day, but it becomes so much less fun out here when your body is beat up, so I crawled into my tent grateful to be done.","Lost Mountain Shelter
",Wise Shelter,"May 20, Mon",17.50
Denver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614266,"Big day and the first part of it was absolutely spectacular.
Leaving Wise Shelter, the trail rambled along through a bowl between the peaks that make up the highlands. You soon emerge onto an open ridge running down the center of the valley with views of the pine-clad peaks all around you. You can see other trails on the peaks around you and there are plenty of wonderful camping spots. The whole area seems like it has so much to offer and I'd love to come back and explore it further.
After a few miles you descend into a gap where a paddock sits. This is The Scales and the hillsides around it we're dotted with ponies and longhorn cattle. It's a perfect camping spot and even has a privy and a water source. The scenery is spectacular.
I lingered as long as I could before continuing on my way. I encountered trail magic at a road crossing as I left the highlands behind. Two gentlemen had setup camp to catch the post-trail-days bubble and serve them coffee, sodas, lunch, and dinner. I stayed for about an hour before pushing on. I had an ambitious goal for the day and didn't want to arrive too late.
The rest of the day was honestly a blur. The terrain was rolling but not too difficult. I was on high alert for snakes but saw none. The final 1.75 miles to the shelter down from the ridge felt like an eternity and I kept running into spider webs. I was very close to my limit.
Finally reached Trimpi shelter which is actually a very cool stone shelter similar to the ones in the smokies. It had a chimney, two levels, and a resident snake. I opted for my tent.","Wise Shelter

Denver,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614268,"Today was about getting to town and resupplying. I've been having trouble with my pack and was eager for a more restful day.I woke up at 615 to find that Crypter and Memorial, two guys I'd hiked with over the past few days were already packed and heading out with the goal of hiking the 10 miles to Marion in time to catch the 11am shuttle. I packed myself up and headed out at about 7:15.The trail has a surprising amount of climbing. I had expected an easy 10 miles, but it proved to be more challenging then I'd hoped. Still, I rolled in to the parking lot at the visitor center at about 10:30 to find a trail angel waiting with Memorial and Crypter already on board. I hopped in and was wished away to Marion, VA where I am now splitting a room with Memorial at the Travel Inn. Nemo is also staying here and I ran into WyldViolet at the Bojangles. A couple that go by Shortcake and Slearner are also here, and I ran into about 4 other hikers I know whole wandering around Walmart while resupplying. I'm ready to go again tomorrow, but I am grateful for the rest.","Trimpi Shelter
