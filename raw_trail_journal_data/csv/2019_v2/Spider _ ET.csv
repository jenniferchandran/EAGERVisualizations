Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614681,"We are about 1.5 months from hitting the trail to hike the 6th and final section of the AT. We started the dieting and excercise programs about a month ago with only moderate success so far...We still have weight to lose and muscles to strengthen before we will feel comfortable on long days of hiking. After experiencing New Hampshire's White Mountains and southern Maine last year, we know what kind of shape we need to get into...Fear is a good motivator! We have our plane tickets to fly to Boston on July 10. Arrangements still need to be made to get from Boston to Stratton, ME where we will start this year's hike. The plan is to start focusing on the details of food, equipment etc. in June. More to come!!",,View Entry,"May 27, Mon",0
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616642,"Time is flying by to when we step on a plane for the East Coast. Spider has been putting the final touches on our hike plan. He has contacted the various hostels along the way to double-check rates and availability. He has contacted the Stratton Motel/Hiker Hostel to reserve a shuttle from the bus station in Augusta, ME to Stratton. He has also established with Shaw's Hostel in Monson, ME where they can do a food drop in the 100-Wilderness so we won't have to carry 9-10 days of food. With the hike plan being finalized, ET will get the resupply boxes this week and we will begin to fill them. The first box should be going out in about 2 weeks! Today or tomorrow we will get our gear down from the attic and check it out. No doubt there will be some repairing/replacing required.Our exercise program continues, only not at the rate we had planned...Life keeps getting in the way!! At our age, it is difficult to expect to hit the trail to get in shape, so we will need to focus on exercising a little more in these final weeks...Fear is a great Motivator!!",,View Entry,"Jun 18, Tue",0
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617524,"We continue to make progress on getting ready for our AT Section hike...The last section. Our house looks like a tornado has hit it with food boxes and gear all over the place. Spider set up the tent (today's picture) to let it air out and to make sure all the parts are there....It's been 9 months since it was last used. ET fired up the JetBoil to make sure it still worked too. Bus tickets were purchased to get us from Boston to Augusta, ME and we made a reservation with the Stratton Motel/Hiker Hostel to shuttle us from Augusta back to Stratton. The trip is starting to take shape.Meanwhile we are scurrying around trying to get everything else to a point that we can leave it for a month. Bills are being paid ahead and some of our home services are being cancelled. Likewise other things continue to pull us away from our hike preparations: ET's mother's 90th birthday, Spider's work on rebuilding a 1954 Willys, etc. Fortunately, if all goes as planned, everything will be completed in the next week...fingers crossed.",,View Entry,"Jun 26, Wed",0
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617867,"Our picture of the day is not our recently washed laundry but clothes drying after being sprayed with Permithrin insecticide. Although the thought of wearing clothes infused with insecticide is not particularly appealing....Lyme disease is even more repulsive. We have been successful in hiking over 2000 miles of the AT without a tick problem since we have always sprayed our clothes with Permithrin...So we continue to do it!We are getting down to the wire on things to do for the hike. We have most of the major items taken care of: clothing and gear repaired or replaced, food boxes ready for shipping (the first box goes out tomorrow!!) and reservations made for the trip where we can. However our to-do lists still seem to remain at a dozen or so items...It seems that every time we complete a task, a new task or two is identified!! Oh well, it 8 days it will be what it will be!!We have begun to watch the weather in Stratton, ME (our starting point) and beyond. It looks like the temperatures are moderate, but rain/showers seem to be in the forecast for our first week. Needless to say, we are double checking our raingear!!",,View Entry,"Jul 02, Tue",0
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618227,"We are in our final week of preparation before we fly out next Wednesday on a red-eye to Boston. We mailed our first food box last Wednesday...so this hike is getting real! Spider has put the final touches on our hike plan and is reducing the pages so we won't have to carry too much weight. We are spending a couple days at our vacation home in Lake Tahoe so we can ""button"" it up for a month. Monday we will be back at our house in the SF Bay Area and do the same thing there. We have been hoping that the showers/thunderstorms being forecast In Stratton, ME (where we will start our hike) will change to a forecast of sunshine..But no change yet!Our to-do lists continue to have lots of things on them, but most are things to be done in the last couple of days before leaving.As with last year, our neighbors are our first trail angels! Carl has volunteered to drive us to our local rapid transit station and his wife, Ginny, volunteered to send our final food boxes out.We are anxious to get back on the trail!",,View Entry,"Jul 06, Sat",0
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618419,"Day T-3: In 4 more days and we will be hiking the AT. We just got home from a week in the mountains of Lake Tahoe. Now we are down to the last minute things! Spider is packed (today's picture) and ready to go, while ET is still ""working on it""! Spider also waterproofed his boot since it sounds like the trail is wet and muddy from the recent rains...Although past years have shown nothing is really waterproof after several hours trudging on flooded trails!!
After getting home yesterday, we have been racing around completing all the tasks we waited until the last minute to tackle like paying bills ahead through July, haircuts, last minute clothes washing etc. We each have about a dozen tasks still to do, but by tomorrow afternoon, if they aren't done, they won't get done!!
We are getting excited about finally getting back to the AT and finish the final section!!",,View Entry,"Jul 09, Tue",0
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618522,"Day T-2: The to-do lists are completed. Trail Angel Carl showed up at 4pm and gave ET and Spider a ride to our local Bay Area Rapid Transit station...Thanks Carl!
An hour later we arrived at San Francisco airport. We checked our packs as baggage then made our way through security. We had allowed plenty of time for this trip to the airport so we would have extra time to deal with any unexpected issues,  like last year when we arrived at the airport to find that our flight had been cancelled. Arriving early allowed us to be ahead of the crowd in rebooking another flight before they filled up. This year we arrived at our gate 2 hours before our flight was scheduled to leave. Fortunately we are members of United's Club, so we proceeded there to relax in soft chairs with free food and drink. That's the life and is today's picture.
During this time we were notified that our flight had been delayed for about an hour. We seem to be jinxed. Fortunately we had about 2 hours in Boston before we catch our bus to Augusta, ME. We finally boarded the plane an hour later than planned. We had used points to upgrade to First Class. Between the United Club and First Class treatment I guess we're enjoyingbcivilized luxury before experiencing living in the wilderness for 3+ weeks! After a nice meal we flattened out our seats and went to sleep. Another reason we justified First Class is we actually had enough space to sleep on a red-eye flight. 
Tomorrow we'll wake up on the East Coast and closer to getting back on the trail..Wahoo!",,View Entry,"Jul 10, Wed",0
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618588,"Dat T-1 er Maybe Day T-2: We made it to our destination of the Stratton Motel/Hostel by 1:30pm..we are only about 2 miles from where we return the our AT hike..Wahoo!
The flight to Boston was uneventful. We were able to get a good 3 hours of sleep in our fully reclining seats..Boy was that nice. We awoke as we began our descent into Boston airport.
We were one of the first off the plane, picked up our packs at baggage claim, then proceeded to the bus stop where we would meet our Concord Coach Lines bus to take us to Augusta, ME.Our pilots had made up a little time from our late departure out of SFO, so eill had to wait about an hour for our bus. Fortunately the bus arrived only a few minutes late, so began the ground-porton of our trip.
The day was overcast and there was a forecast of rain as we headed further north into Maine. It was amazing to see the lush, green countryside compared to California.
We arrived in Augusta at 11am. Spider had been informed that Stacey, the owner of the Motel/Hostel, would be picking us up, so Spider called her when we reached Augusta. She said she was about 30 minutes away, so we waited. Stacey arrived at 11:35am and we headed out on the next leg of our journey.
It was a nice drive through the Maine countryside and a chance to get to know Stacey. She had quite the stories to tell about running a Hiker motel and hostel. We arrived in Stratton by 1:30pm and checked in.
Next on the agenda was lunch. We walked the 1/4 mile down the road to the Flagstaff Market. Spider had been in communication with them and knew they had fuel canisters for our stove. So besides lunch, we also got stove fuel.
Now an explanation for the Entry Title and the Day T-1 vs Day T-2. When we returned to the motel, we repacked our packs. Things that normally hang on the outside of the pack on the trail, had to go inside the pack when getting it ready for shipping by plane. Likewise anything breakable or precious was carried on to the plane rather than put in the pack. The end result is that our packs had to be completely repacked. We had chaecked and rechecked our packing lists at home, however in the course of the repack, we discovered 2 things: Spider had packed our old water filter instead of the new one..it will work but it will be slower. And ET had the wrong set of maps. Spider is carrying some maps too so we are not without anything..but we will have less information than planned...so ADAPT!
As for the Day designation, we were informed by Chris, the motel/hostel manager, that they are recommending that hikers not head out tomorrow. The first section of the trail we will hike eventually gets above treeline on a ridge. Tomorrow's weather forecast is for violent thunderstorms with lots of lightning and high winds..not a good time to be on an open ridge! We will reexamine our plans tomorrow morning, but will likely shorten our hike to stop before the open ridges or start our hike the next day...so ADAPT
After repacking, we decided to relax until dinner..of course we fell asleep! 3 hours later we felt refreshed, so went outside and met some of the other hikers. Then we headed across the street to the Plaza restaurant for a dinner of prime rib and chili mac & cheese. Back to the room to read and journal. To bed by 11pm.",,View Entry,"Jul 11, Thu",0
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618839,"Day 1 - We are back on the AT! It rained overnight so we awoke to a wet parking lot and overcast sky's. The weather forecast had changed to have the thunderstorms come in mid-afternoon. So we decided to hit the trail but go a shorter distance than the planned 8 miles to Avery Campsite. Avery is above treeline and has no shelters, only tent pads...not a place to be in a thunderstorm! Instead our plan was to go only a little over 5 miles to a shelter, Horn Pond Lean-to, still in trees. By-the-way, a 3-sided shelter on the AT in Maine is called a ""Lean-to"" where everywhere else on the AT it's called a ""shelter""..so I will be using the terms interchangeablely.
At about 7am Chris from the Stratton Motel gave us a ride to the trailhead. We hit the trail at 7:15am. It was a fairly gentle walk at first, although there were plenty of roots, rocks and mud. The roots were paticularly slippery with the recent rains. We had several short ups and downs for about 2 miles until we reached Cranberry Stream Campground an hour later. Now the climb for the day began in earnest. ..1850 feet in 2 miles! 
We took our time and made plenty of rest stops. We met around  dozen southbound hikers but only saw 2 northbound hikers. Maybe they were heeding the warning and staying off the mountain. The trail varied from flat to places where we had to pull ourselves up grabbing large rocks or small trees and mosquitoes we're our constant companions!
We finally made it to the shelter by 1:30 pm. 6.5 hours to go 5.1 miles..Hmm. There we're actually 2 shelters. One had a couple of hikers in it already, so we moved into the other. After lunch we took a little nap but we're awakened by a downpour from a thunderstorm. On a metal roof you definitely know when it is raining! However the rain only lasted 10 minutes. Dinner at 7:30pm and to bed by 8:30pm. More climbing tomorrow.","ME27/Stratton, ME
",Horns Pond Lean-to,"Jul 12, Fri",5.10
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618916,"Day 2 - It rained several times during the night and the wind  blew strongly..no thunder and lightning though. Still we were glad to be in the Lean-to. Up at 6am and out by 7:15am..foggy day and still windy.
We had 4 climbs today, 3 of them 500 feet or less, but steep. The 4th climb was 750 feet but more gentle. Our goal was to try to make up for our short day yesterday by hiking 10 miles. That would put us back on schedule.
We started our first 500 foot climb right after leaving the shelter. The going was slow  climbing South Horn Peak as there were several places were we had to forego the trekking poles and use our hands to pull ourselves up a steep rockface. After about an hour we reached the top and stopped for breakfast. Unfortunately, this is when Spider's arm strap on his pack broke. As he was repairing the strap with diaper pins from his repair kit, four young men who were just hiking the Bigelow's joined us for a while. We would see them on and off throughout the day.
After breakfast we hit the trail and decended to a ridge that connected us to the next peak, Bigelow West Peak. Fortunately, as we hiked the ridge, the fog cleared and we were able to see for miles. The climb to West Peak was similar to South Horn Peak, so it took longer than planned. While we stopped for our next break, the 4 guys caught up with us and returned ETs water bottle she had accidently dropped on the trail. Thanks guys.
This was a weekend, so we saw lots of day-hikers. There are many side trails to approach these peaks that are much shorter than the AT approach and many people were taking advantage of them. We also saw a couple of Northbound thru-hikers and a half dozen Southbound thru-hikers..busy trail!
The wind continued to blow and the skies clear as we made it to the top of Bigelow West Peak. We had grand views in all directions. The nice thing about the wind was no mosquitoes. Across the way we could see people on the top of the next peak we would climb, Avery Peak.
We started our descent off West Peak. It was very steep at first. We sometimes had to hold on to trees and back down the rocks. We next made it to the campsite in the col between the two mountains a little after noon. This is where we had planned to camp the first night . Not sure we could have made it before dark and certainly not before the rainstorm, so it was the right decision to hunker down at Horn Pond Lean-to!
So we had a half-of-a-day of hiking left for what was planned to take a whole day...Hmm. Next we climbed the 300 feet to the top of Avery Peak..which is today's picture. Then we had a 2000 foot descent. Down, down, down, sometimes steep and sometimes only slightly down. We finally reached the bottom at about 4pm. All the day-hikers left us heading down a side trail to their cars.
Then we had a decision to make. We weren't going to make it to Little Bigelow Lean-to 5 miles away. Should we stay at the nearby Safford Lean-to and make the next day a 12 mile day to get back on plan, or should we hike up the trail and stealth camp. The decision was made more complicated in that we needed water. Spider uses an app on his phone called Guthook. It is GPS based and shows us where we are on the trail and the distance to things like roads, Lean-tos, water sources etc. Guthook showed that there was a water source up the trail in little over a mile. So the decision was made..keep hiking!
We started our 750 foot climb up Little Bigelow Mountain. Unfortunately, when we got to Guthook's water source all that was there was a mud bog. In general, the area seemed fairly wet so we explored up the trail further and eventually found a small rivulet of clear water coming from under a rock. It took ET about 10 minutes to patiently fill a small container, then pour it into a bigger container. Eventually we had enough water for dinner, breakfast and  the first part of tomorrow's hike 
After getting our water, we continued our climb. The map showed a relatively flat area just before the ridgeline we were heading for. When we got to the flat area we explored around and finally found a flat spot for our tent, out of view of the trail. 
We finally started setting up our tent at 6:20pm. Dinner at 7:30pm and into the tent by 8pm. While Spider spent the time doing a more permanent repair on his pack arm strap using wire, ET read. Finally lights out at 8:30pm. It had been a long day.","Horns Pond Lean-to

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619031,"Day 3: About 11pm it began to rain through most of the night. This surprised us since it had been such a nice clear day and the last forecast we had seen was for good weather. We had put the rainfly on the tent but not tied it down..Oh well! 
Our alarm went off at 5am. We wanted an early start to what we hoped would be an 11+ mile day. We found, as we started to pack, that some things had gotten wet inside the tent from the rain dripping off the untied rainfly. Fortunately nothing was wet that couldn't dry out. So we packed up our wet stuff and the wet tent and hit the trail by 6:30am, to clear skies and wind.
We had a 200 foot climb to the ridge. From the ridge we had great views to the valley below. The trail now followed the ridge with short ups and downs..some fairly steep. Other parts it were nice forest walks Periodically we would break out of the trees onto large rock slabs with great views. On one of these we stopped for breakfast.
After breakfast, we continued our ridge hike and eventually arrived at the top of Little Bigelow Mountain, the highest bump on the ridge. Next we began our 1800 foot descent. It soon turned into a rock slab walk. Fortunately the sun had been out long enough to dry the slabs from the previous night's rain. We started passing several day-hikers climbing the mountain. After one more break we reached the turnoff to the Little Bigelow Lean-to at 11:45am..our original destination for Day 2. 
We filled up with water at the nearby stream and continued down the trail. Changes became noticable: the trail had become smoother and flatter and it was now covered in leaves instead of pine needles...so we strided out!
We soon crossed a road where all the day-hikers had parked and we reentered the forest. However this was a very different kind of forest. It was relatively flat and had many boggy areas. We crossed several ""bridges"" made of cut logs to keep us above the mud and muck. As we exited this area we found ourselves walking along the shore of Flagstaff Lake. This is a huge lake that dominates the local landscape. We first saw it when we climbed our first peak in the Bigelow's and continued to look down on it from every subsequent ridge and peak. It seemed weird to now be walking next to it!
We next climbed over a ridge and dropped into a valley on the other side. Fortunately the trail was fairly benign and we made pretty good time. We crossed a road, then climbed another hill, Little Round Top. By this time Spider was running out of ""gas"", so it was a slow climb. We finally reaching the top and Spider found his legs again and we made good time going down. We stopped at a stream about 0.5 miles from the shelter to fill up with water. We had read that the water source for the shelter was the nearby pond and we prefer stream water, if we can get it.
We reached the West Carry Pond Lean-to at 6:20pm...which is today's picture. We are finally back on schedule. Wahoo!
There was one north-bounder (NOBO), who had passed us on Little Round To, and a south-bounder (SOBO) already there. Black clouds had slowly built up during the afternoon and the wind had blown most the day, all pointing to the possibility of more rain. Given our previous night's experience, we decided to stay in the shelter. Since both the other gentlemen were tenting, we had the shelter to ourselves.
We spent some time talking to the other hikers as we set up sleeping accommodations and prepared dinner. The NOBO's trail name was ""Dreamer"" and he had started in Hanover..the place we had started our section hike last year. We compared our experiences going through the White Mountains. We may see him again since he is planning to stay in the same hiker hostel we are headed to in Caratunk.
Finally to bed at 8pm. Spider did a little journaling, but with no cell service, he wasn't sure when he will be able to post it. Lights out 8:30pm.","Stealth Camp after Safford Junction
",West Carry Pond Lean-to,"Jul 14, Sun",11.10
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619032,"Day 4 - We arose at 6:30am. We had decided to sleep in a little after our hard day yesterday. We hoped that the trail would be as kind to us as the later part had been yesterday so that today's miles would come more easily. As we got up, Dreamer was already packed and heading out. That's one thing we see on the trail. The dedicated hikers are usually up and out early to maximize their mileage. We need to become more like them! We packed up and were on the trail by 7:35am. 
The trail started out rocky and muddy near the pond but then turned into a nice forest walk. Soon we joined the Arnold Trail. The trail was named after a route Benedict Arnold took leading a group of over 1000 soldiers to surprise attack on the English in Quebec, Canada in 1775. At the time Arnold was a well respected general in the Continental Army and, although the attack on Quebec was considered a failure, it had an impact on the English and their concerns about the capability of the Revolutionaries.
As part of the trail we soon passed over Arnold Swamp via an elaborate bridge walkway, which is today's picture. In fact we would cross several swamps/bogs this day but none with a sophisticated bridgework like Arnold Swamp.
Our second break for the day (first being breakfast in the woods) was at a beach on East Carry Pond. Most of the ponds we have seen are surrounded by rocks, so it was unusual to see a sandy beach. So we had to stop and take advantage of it. ET sat on the sand in the sun enjoying the views across the pond, while Spider hid in the shade.
We ended the day with a 350 foot climb over a saddle. We met several SOBOs but saw no NOBOs on the trail. We arrived at the Pierce Pond Lean-to at 3:30pm...nice mileage and ending early..Wahoo. 
The weather was windy but clear so we decided to set up our tent. We needed to dry it out from the rainstorm of 2 nights before anyway. There was only one other person there in the shelter so we found a nice, flat spot near the pond and set up the tent.
We needed water and Spider had read that there was a small stream down a side trail...or we could get water out of the pond. Given our preference of avoiding pond water, Spider grabbed the waterbag and headed down the side trail. 
Spider's other goal was to put our reservation in for the pancake feed tomorrow morning. From Spider's research, he learned that there was a fishing lodge about 0.3 miles down the same side trail that offered a pancake breakfast to hikers if they got their names in the previous day. We were ready to eat something other than freeze-dried food.
Spider had no problem finding the lodge, but no one was around. He waited awhile but no one showed up, so eventually he left and headed back to the water source stream he had passed. He filled up the water bag and returned to our campsite to deliver the sad news to ET.
At 6:30pm we headed to the shelter to cook our dinner. (The Maine Appalachian Trail Club prefers that all cooking occur at the shelter.) According to ET, during Spider's absence, a lot of hikers had come in. Sure enough the shelter was full plus some additional tents.
We cooked our dinner, then back to the tent by 7pm. Spider journaled and ET read until 9pm..then lights out. Tomorrow we will get to a town and stay at a hiker hostel that is famous for it's milkshakes..Mmmm! Best yet, it comes with a shower and a bed!","West Carry Pond Lean-to
",Pierce Pond Lean-to,"Jul 15, Mon",10
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619033,"Day 5 - ET awoke a little before 4am and read until Spider woke up at 5:30am. Then we got up, packed up and hit the trail at 6:35am..one of our fastest times yet! 
The first thing we had to negotiate was the weir/dam for Pierce Pond. It was one of the sketchiest works of engineering, with random sections of rocks, boards and logs constructed to let water out while still allowing a hiker to cross. Once finally over the dam, we headed down to the trail for 0.3 miles to the turn off to the fishing lodge Spider had visited the day before. We decided we would walk the 0.1 miles in to see if there was any left over pancakes. When we arrived we found a sign saying the lodge was closed due to illness. Darn. We had to eat Tang and oatmeal for breakfast again.
We headed back to the AT and continued to descend as the trail followed the stream coming out of Pierce Pond. Unfortunately it followed it close enough that the trail was constantly going up and down, often steeply due to the erosion near the stream. In Georgia we called these MUDs..Mindless Ups and Downs!
At 7:35am we found a flat place and stopped for breakfast. We took our time because we could not cross the upcoming Kennebec River until 9am because that is when the ferry starts running...yes a ferry. 
The Kennebec River is unique on the AT in having a ferry because there are no bridges within miles where the AT reaches the river...and it is too deep to wade across. So the Maine Appalachian Trail Club along with the Appalachian Trail Conservancy run a ferry to get hikers across safely. In reality the ""ferry"" is actually a guy in a canoe. The service is free and starts at 9am and ends at 2pm each day. All NOBOs and SOBOs have to plan their hiking day around the ferry schedule. This is one of the reasons we stayed only 4 miles away. We knew we could make it to the Kennebec when the ferry was running.
After breakfast we were back on the trail negotiating more MUDs. We had been passed by a couple of NOBOs but didn't see any SOBOs until 9:30am, the first ferry riders of the day. 20 minutes later we we're standing on the banks of the Kennebec River. It turned out the ferry/canoe had just dropped off 2 SOBOs and was ready for us. The canoeist/captain/driver/pilot said he had been expecting us based on what the previous NOBOs had said when he taken them across. No secrets on the AT! 
We signed a couple of release forms, put on life vests, then got instructions on how to get into the canoe...packs first then people. We noticed that the canoe had a white blaze on it (the mark on trees and rocks indicating where the AT goes) so we knew we were still on the trail even on the water. We left shore at 9:55am and it took less than 5 minutes to cross. Our crossing the Kennebec River is the picture of the day.
Once across and back on dry land the canoeist gave us directions how to get to our destination, the Caratunk House Hiker Hostel. We walked 100 yards along the bank of the river then cut inland. A few steps later we were at Highway 201. Across it was the small town of Caratunk. A short street walk and we were at the hostel at 10:10am..a short hiking day!
The first thing we saw was Dreamer sitting at a table in the front yard waving at us. We said ""Hi"" then Spider went in to register and check to see if our room might be ready this early in the day. As Spider entered, the owner of the hostel, Paul, said ""You must be Spider!"". Between the email Spider had sent a month ago requesting a private room for this day and Dreamer's description of us, Paul already knew all about us...no secrets on the AT!
It turned out our room was available and better yet, our resupply box with next week's food was there. Everything was working. So we went to our room and took care of the most pressing business..a shower! Next we ordered a chocolate milkshake and drank them on the front lawn talking to Dreamer. Then we got our laundry done and found a few nibbles for lunch in the hostel's resupply store.
We had a lazy afternoon talking to other hikers, reading and getting caught up on the journals. At 5pm Paul took a bunch of us to a local restaurant that was having all-you-can-eat taco night. Any all-you-can-eat place is a target for hikers so we were all happy with Paul's choice. When we were done we called Paul and he came back to pick us up. To bed by 7:30pm and lights out at 9pm..hikers midnight. 
This ended our Nero day in hiker parlance. ""Nero day"" stands for ""near zero"" miles hiked that day, i.e. any day where significantly less the normal hiking mileage is hiked. Obviously a ""zero day"" is when no miles are hiked...like tomorrow will be for us!","Pierce Pond Lean-to
","Caratunk House, Caratunk, ME","Jul 16, Tue",4
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619089,"Day 6 - We have a Zero Day so we can sleep in, right?...Nope, up at 5am! Paul had the coffee ready soon after. So we sat in the two chairs in our room and enjoyed the coffee. The windows were open and we could smell the wet earth from last night's rain. We sure were glad to be indoors last night!
7am was breakfast call and we headed downstairs for a meal of  orange juice, scrambled eggs with mushrooms, bacon, fried potatoes, blueberry muffins and french toast. Since the place is full, there were 2 spots set up in the kitchen in addition to the 8 at the dining table. We opted for the kitchen...kind of a Chef's Table! We watched Paul scurry around the kitchen preparing our morning repast. A good hiker's meal, but we weren't hiking!
A little something about Caratunk House. The house is very old with wood plank floors, drooping glass in the window panes, and doors with old mechanical latches. It appears to have been added on to several times as there is a bit of rambling twists and turns in the hallways. The fun part is that it is filled with antiques. Paul said he used to be an antique dealer. Our room is on the second story near the front of the house. It is today's picture.
After breakfast we said good-bye to Dreamer who was headed back to the trail. He hikes so fast we're not sure we will see him again. Then we went back to our room to relax and enjoy our day off. 
At 10:30am an old friend showed up. Spider had let Phil/Runaway know we were going to be at Caratunk House for 2 nights and we would see him and take him to lunch if he was willing to make the drive..It turns out he was willing to make the 2 hour drive...Thanks Phil!
We first met Phil and his wife, Thea, on the AT in 2014. They were doing a thru-hike as Runaway and Grasshopper, respectively. We hiked with them for over a week through the Shenandoahs. We eventually dropped off the trail for a zero day and they continued on. We kept in contact with them and they actually picked us up from the trail last year and hosted us with a lobster dinner at their house in Maine. 
As we were sitting in the living room talking, it started to rain outside..we'd picked a good day to have a Zero Day! We went to lunch at a local Outfitters restaurant (a different Outfitter than last night). Then came back to Caratunk House for milkshakes. We had a lot of catching up to do. Unfortunately, Thea unexpectedly died this past year, so it was nice to see Phil and reminisce about past times.
After Phil left, we went back to our room to continue our relaxing. Then at 6pm Paul shuttled us to the Outfitter for dinner. At this rate we may gain weight, instead of lose weight, on this hike!
Speaking of physical condition, each Zero Day I like to report on how our bodies are holding up to the rigors of the trail and so far so good. No blisters, a couple of scrapes and a bunch of mosquito bites (even though we are fairly religious in putting on insect repellent, the mosquitoes still seem to find a place to bite!). As far as the number of falls, we both have one. Hiking a trail with muddy, slippery roots and rocks makes every step a potential disaster. So every year we have kept track of the number of falls so that we focus on preventing them. 
After dinner we returned back to Caratunk House and did an initial packing of our packs in preparation for getting back on the trail tomorrow. Since it had rained on and off all day, we checked the weather forecast for the next couple of days..partly sunny..Wahoo! To bed by 8pm and lights off by 10pm.","Caratunk House, Caratunk, ME

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619459,"Day 7 - We arose at 5:30am and had coffee with a couple of hikers in the living room. Breakfast call at 7am and this time we got to sit at the ""big kids"" table! The menu was the same as yesterday and just as good. Turns out there were 4 hikers who were NOBOs (including us) and 4 hikers who were SOBOs at the table. After breakfast we headed back to our room and finished packing up. We paid our bill and headed back to the trail at 8:15am.
The trail went through a trailhead parking area then climbed into the woods. We were able to keep a good pace as we gently climbed. We commented on how far away we were but still able to hear the whine of the tires on Highway 201. 
We continued to take breaks every hour. Getting our ""trail legs"". Being able to extend our time between breaks takes about 2 weeks and we are still ""city soft""!
The trail climbed over a small ridge then dropped into a dale with a running stream. We then began to climb upstream next to Holly Brook. In doing so, we left the noise of the busy Highway and could once again hear the birds.
We commented in last year's journal that we noted the absence of the cacophony of bird sounds that we were used to in our hikes on the East Coast. A local had hypothesized that a hurricane that had hit the area the year before may have destroyed many of the birds and their habitats. So we are happy to report that we are hearing many more birds this year. It still is not as much as we heard in earlier years, but it's great to hear what we do.
We crossed the Brook a couple of times before we left it for good about a mile from our destination. Now going through the woods on a mud, roots and rocks trail, we made it to the Lean-to by noon.
So now we had a decision: Plan A would be to continue hiking since we still had half a day left. However the next mile is a climb of 1100 feet in the afternoon heat then ~4.5 miles to the next water. That would make it a 12 mile day with packs full of food for 5 days. Or Plan B, we make this a short day, consume some of the food and tackle the climb in the cool of the morning. We opted for Plan B.
So we found a nice tentsite, set up the tent, had lunch and took naps. Out of the tent at 6pm for dinner. The nearby shelter sounded like it had filled up based on all the voices. Assume they are mostly SOBOs positioning themselves to get to the ferry. Back into the tent after dinner at ~7pm. Lights off at 9pm.

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619460,"Day 8 - We set the alarm to get up at 5:30am, but we were already awake. We hit the trail at 6:35am and immediately began to climb Pleasant Pond Mountain. It was a fairly steep climb, but we kept plugging away. 1 hour and 25 minutes later we were at the top..time for breakfast! We had great views in all directions. Today's picture is looking back in the direction we have come. Those bumps in the distance are the Bigelow's the we hiked on Day 1 and Day 2. We enjoy seeing our back trail and how far we've come. 
After breakfast we began our descent. It was a long, slow descent with a lot of short, steep ups and downs. We met a guy who was out doing trail maintenance and commented that today and tomorrow will be the 3 H's..Hot, Humid and Hazy. The high today will be in the mid-80s and tomorrow will be in the mid-90s. Who would have thought you could get a heat stroke in Maine? All we know is we are sweating a lot and so are the rocks! I've described this in previous journals. When it is hot and humid, cool, submerged rocks with a piece sticking above the ground, become wet and slippery when the humid air condenses on the rock.
We finally made it off the mountain and had our first river that was listed as a ""Ford"" on our maps, meaning we have to wade across. In reality, Baker Stream was wide but we could rock-hop acsoss. We made it to the Lean-to by 3:30pm.
The early arrival allowed Spider to work on an important project, his sleeping mat. Yesterday, while lying in the tent he found his mat was loosing air. At first he thought it might be the valve but confirmed it was not. He tried sleeping on it last night but woke up in the middle of the night to find himself on the ground, several times. So how do you find a small air leak in a mat in the middle of the woods? Spider tried first by building a trough with 2 parallel logs, rocks, and a garbage bag filled with water. He submerged portions of the mat in the trough looking for bubbles..but no luck. So he took the mat to a nearby stream and floated it in a small pool..Eureka!..bubbles. So he used his repair kit and will see if tonight he sleeps on air...or the ground again!

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619461,"Day 9 - We set the alarm for 5am. It was expected to be a hot day and we had a mountain to climb first thing, so thought we would do it in the coolest part of the day. Unfortunately Spider was already awake, having spent most the night on the ground. His patching of the ground pad had not solved the problem..Bummer.
We were on the trail by 6:10am, our earliest start yet. We immediately started climbing the 1300 foot Moxie Bald Mountain. The ""cool"" of the morning was 68 degrees and with high humidity we were both drenched in sweat before too long. We took our breakfast break part way up the mountain then tackled the final part of the climb which included some hand-over-hand rock climbing. We finally made it to the top around 9am. The views were spectacular. As had been the case the previous morning on the top of Pleasant Pond Mountain, Spider was able to get a cell signal with his ""burner"" Verizon phone and sent off the previous day's journal.
We rested for a while on top because there was a cool breeze blowing. While we rested, a SOBO joined us and we soon found we had a link to California in that a friend of his was a winemaker in the Napa Valley, Arcudi Wines. After some good conversation and a chance to cool down, we started our descent.
The first part of the descent was a series of slab walking but then turned steep and some places required holding onto trees and rocks and backing down rock faces. ET looked to the north and thinks she got a photo of Katahdin (the trail finale). Finally we were back to a regular trail. Once off the mountain, the trail turned back to the rooty, rocky, muddy trail we have come to expect.
Around 1pm we reached Bald Mountain Stream. This was listed as a ""ford"" on our map, but like yesterday's crossing of Baker Stream, we were able to rock hop across. After crossing we took a break at a nearby campsite.
So it was decision time. We were now at the planned destination of the day, but it was only 1:30pm. The next shelter was ~7 miles away. If we could make it to that shelter today we could be off the trail in Monson, ME the next day...a day ahead of schedule! The map showed a steady descent ahead with no more mountains, so we could increase our rest breaks from every hour to every hour and a half. Given this we decided to go for it.
We had hoped for a flat forest trail, but we only got that for a short while, then it turned to a mostly rocky trail where we were literally stepping from rock to rock. This slowed us down.
About 4:30pm we made it to the crossing of the West Branch Piscataquis River. This was also listed as a ""ford"" on our map, but unlike the others, there was no way we could rock hop across. So we took off our boots and socks, put on our sandals, tied the boot laces together and hung out boots around our necks, and waded across the river. We then reversed the process on the other side. Today's picture is of ET demonstrating this. It was a great way to cool off a little.  The river was warmish...  The day had reached the mid-80's, with the humidity about the same. With these kinds of numbers, we sweat a lot, but don't cool down!
Once across the river, the trail followed the river downstream. It undulated from down by the river to up on the ledge above the river. Eventually the ups and downs of the trail and total distance took its toll on Spider. So when we found a nice campsite near the trail at 7:40pm, we decided to call it a day...almost 13.5 hours of hiking! We ended up 0.4 miles from the Horseshoe Canyon Lean-to.
We set up the tent, got water and ate dinner in the waning light of day. To bed at 8:40pm and another night dealing with a leaky ground pad.","Bald Mountain Brook Lean-to

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619462,"Day 10 - We had decided to not set the alarm so we could give our bodies the rest we needed after the long day yesterday. We were up at 5:30am and out by 6:35am. The trail continued to follow the West Piscataquis River with a profile of ups and downs. The day was overcast and a little cooler. We stopped to talk to a SOBO (We do that a lot to find out what to expect up ahead) and asked him about the weather forecast. He said afternoon showers today and cooler tomorrow. We hoped we'd get to Monson before the afternoon showers!
We followed the West Branch of the Piscataquis River until it merged with the East Branch. We then had another boots-off ford of the East Branch of the Piscataquis River. Immediately after the ford, we had our first major climb of the day, but only 500 feet.
At about 11am we heard our first rumble of thunder..Uh oh.. It wasn't afternoon yet. Soon it got so dark that it was almost nighttime in the forest. Within 10 minutes, the first rain started to fall. We stopped to put our pack covers on, but decided to not put on our rain gear. It would only make us hotter and we were already wet from sweating. Within 5 minutes of being back on the trail, the heavens open up. Sheets of rain came down like someone had opened a faucet. Within minutes the trail was flooded and every gully was running full of water. The nice thing was that we were getting a shower and a clothes washing all at the same time!
The rains lasted for about an hour then began to taper off. However we got a ""secondary"" rain every time the wind blew and knocked the rain off the tree canopy above. By the time we were ready to take out next break, the sun was shining and it was about 15 degrees cooler...Wahoo! 
Our break was at a junction. To the right was a side trail that, in ~2 miles would take us into Monson. Straight ahead, the AT would take us to Maine Highway 15 in 3.3 miles. Then we would need a shuttle down Highway 15 to get  back to Monson. We wanted a private room at Shaw's Hiker Hostel if we could get one and the early bird gets the room. But coming out of Monson was a planned 10 mile day that would become a 13+ mile day if we did the side trail..Hmm. After weighing the pros and cons, we decided to continue on the AT and to try calling Shaw's as soon as we got to the top of upcoming Buck Hill (no cell service at the junction.)
About an hour later, we had cell service on Buck Hill and were able to contact Shaw's. They had one private room left, so we reserved it. Now back on the trail, we had a down, an up, and another down to Highway 15. We arrived at the trailhead at 3:35pm..We are now a day ahead of schedule..Wahoo!
We waited in the trailhead parking lot with another hiker from New Zealand named Fern who had already called Shaw's for a shuttle. 10 minutes later we were being whisked down the highway by AJ from Shaw's. 
We arrived, checked in and were given a tour of the place. Then we were shown our ""room"". Today's picture is of our room...No we have not been transported to the steppes of Outer Mongolia. There are yurts in Maine, and we are sleeping in one.
Next, we followed our usual pattern of showers first. Mother Nature's shower wasn't good enough! We picked up our resupply boxes...Whew, they were there. Then off to dinner at a nearby pub. The food was good and the beer and wine were rewarding. Back to the room...er... yurt to relax. Lights out at 9pm.","Stealth Camp near Horseshoe Canyon Lean-to

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619916,"Day 11 - It rained last night so it was nice to be in a yurt! We slept in until 6:30am. Aren't zero days great? Breakfast was served at 7am...eggs (cooked to order), bacon, home fries and blueberry pancakes. Then on to chores. Spider used water in the sink to find that the original repair on his ground mat had not worked so it was still leaking. ET prepared a box of things we had brought on the hike but haven't used and mailed it home. Spider got caught up on all the journal entries. We planned our trip through the upcoming ""100 Mile Wilderness"".
As soon as we leave Monson tomorrow, we immediately enter the 100 Mile Wilderness. This is 100 miles of the AT where there are no towns and no paved roads, only a few old logging roads. Most of the area is now under a Nature Conservancy, so not many inhabitants. As such, we will pretty much be on our own for the next 9 days. One of the things that Shaw's does provide a service where they will do a food drop in the middle of the 100 Mile Wilderness, so we don't have to carry 9 days of food. What we had to do was to figure out where and when to meet them given our planned hike schedule.
Once all that was done, it was lunch time. We walked around town and finally settled on the General Store that had a deli that made fresh sandwiches. Back to the yurt for a little relaxation and phone calls to the family. Later we did some preliminary packing and took another shower, since it will likely be 9 days until we can take the next one! The day had been mostly cloudy and I'd finally rained a little mid-afternoon.
We found out that of the 3 restaurants in town, one was closed on Mondays (the pub we ate at last night), one was out of food because of a big celebration over the weekend (only in a small town!) and the last was""fine dining"" and pretty expensive, so we opted for wine and pizza in our yurt!
Physically we are still I good shape with no blisters, strained muscles etc. Unfortunately we have probably 3 times the number of mosquito bites than a week ago. We slather bug repellent on several times a day, but they still seem to find a place to bite...and we hear from SOBs that it will get worse the farther North we go!
As for the falls, we both have 3. Spider's last was a spectacular fall 10 feet from parking lot  at the end of yesterday's hike. This area is known for its blue slate. It's pretty to look at, is used in decorative construction, replaces gravel in driveways etc. It's also sliperry when wet. Spider stepped on a slab of this blue slate that was at a 45 degree angle. Both feet went out from under him and he went flat on his back. Thankfully his pack took the brunt of the impact. To add to the drama of the fall, he then slide 4 feet down the slab on his back. Fortunately only his pride was hurt!

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619917,"Day 12 - We were up 5:30am. We finished packing and carried our packs over to the main house hoping to get out on the first shuttle. Breakfast was at 7am. Spider paid our bill and we loaded our packs on the first shuttle. We arrived back at the AT parking lot on ME15 and hit the trail at 8:40am. It had been sprinkling all morning and was still doing so, so we had put our pack covers on, but not our rain gear. Within 100 yards we encountered a sign cautioning us that we are entering the wilderness. It is the picture of the day.
We skirted around a pond then began to climb. After ascending a couple hundred feet we started to descend. That would be the pattern all day, climb descend, climb descend! Sometimes they were steep and sometimes they were gentle. 
About mid-day we came to Little Wilson Falls. Pretty falls in a deep, slate canyon. Soon after we descended into that canyon to cross Little Wilson Creek. It was listed as a ford on the map but we were able to rock-hop across. Soon after we had an extended climb to the open slate ledges of Big Wilson Cliffs. Finally we descended to the Big Wilson Stream. This, too, was listed as a ford on the map and it was, indeed, a boots-off ford.
We had a fairly steep climb away from the stream and soon crossed a set of railroad tracks...this wilderness doesn't have a paved road but it has a railroad!  We climbed  little more and arrived at the Wilson Valley Lean-to at 6:45pm. While we were putting up the tent we heard a train roll by. We couldn't see it but it sounded close by. Hope they don't have a midnight express!

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619918,"Day 13 - We awoke at 5:30am and were on he trail by 6:40am. We continued the climb we had started yesterday. Within a half a mile, the trail had been rerouted because a beaver had recently built a dam across the gully, submerging the trail. This also meant that the water we got from the bubbling brook next to the Lean-to last night was Beaver pond water...Yuk! 
After topping the ridge, we began a long descent with many minor ups and downs, one steep switchback descent, a long traverse across the side of the mountain and a scramble over a large rock fall. 
Near the end of our descent we came to Wilbur Brook, which was listed as a ford, but we were able to rock-hop across. Soon after we came to Vaughn Creek, another ford we were able to rock-hop.  What was spectacular was the 20 foot falls just past where we forded. After a walk down an old logging road we came to Long Pond stream. There, written in small rocks lying on a large rock was the number ""100""...100 miles to Katahdin...Wahoo!
We were able to rock-hop across this one too..three for three today! After crossing we took a break. A SOBO coming down the trail joined us. His trail name was ""Cache 22"". We asked him about the name and he said it refers to a water cache on the Hat Creek Rim on the Pacific Crest Trail. We remember that area because it was an over-30 mile stretch with no water. When we hiked that part of the PCT (which was a hike that our sons both joined us), we drove up Fire Road 22 to where the PCT crossed it and hid some jugs of water. Now there is a tank of water there thanks to Cache 22..cool!
We left Cache 22 and started our big climb of day of 1100 foot up Barren Mountain. It was  pretty steep in several places, so the going was slow. However we were rewarded with some grand views when we reached the Barren Ledges and Barren Slide...which is where today's picture was taken. Looking to the north we could see the top of Barren Peak with it's old fire tower. About 1.5 hours later we were there. Then we had slight descent to the turnoff to the Lean-to. 
It was 0.4 miles to the Cloud Pond Lean-to. This is further than we normally like to go, but was the only source of water on top of the mountain. So off we went. This was the toughest trail to a shelter we have ever been on, over mud bogs, climbing down rocks etc. We finally arrived at 5:50pm to find all the good tent sites taken. So we found a marginal site and set up our tent. We ate dinner at 7pm and to bed by 7:30pm..lights out at 8:30pm
Oh yeah..on the saga of Spider's ground mat, it turns out the repair on the trail had not worked. It was still leaking from the same spot. So at Shaw's he repaired it again...still no good. So a third repair was made with liberal application of glue, and that worked. No more problems...yet!

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619919,"Day 14 -  We were up at 5am using the alarm and were on the trail by 6:10am. We started early because we knew we had a long, rough day in front of us to get near our planned destination. 
It's ""near” our destination because Spider found out that the planned campground requires a reservation and we don't have one. The other issue is that the campground is the only place we can camp in the Gulf Hagas no-camping zone. So our plan is to stealth camp just outside the no-camping zone.
But first we had to get there...and that entails going over 4 peaks each 300-500 feet tall but very steep. So we left the Lean-to and made the difficult 0.4 mile climb back to the AT. Then we headed to Fourth Mountain, then on to Third Mountain. In between we took our breakfast break. ET had broken her spork, so spent some time with duct tape and a twig to repair it. Thank goodness for duct tape!
So after Fourth and Third Mountains it should be Second Mountain. Nope. The next mountain was Columbus Mountain, then Chairback Mountain. I don't know what happened to First and Second Mountains.
Interestingly, on the top of Columbus we were passed by a SOBO moving really fast with just a small pack. As he sped passed us, he said he had started at the top of Katahdin 2 days ago! Jeez...we won't be for another 9 days! He must be doing ~45 miles a day. Later we heard he was trying to beat the fastest known time for hiking the entire AT.
When we finally got to the top of Chairback Mountain we could see off in the distance Whitecap Mountain. Today's picture is Spider checking out the distant Whitecap Mountain. It's hard to believe that we will be there tomorrow.
As we exited the top of Chairback Mountain, we found ourselves climbing down a near-vertical rock fall with rocks the size of refrigerators. We took it slowly and made sure of our balance each rock.
Once off the rock fall we walked several miles of rock slabs until we finally reached a normal trail. The hour was getting late as we continued down the trail. We finally reached more level ground and were paralleling a small stream. When we felt we were getting close to the no-camping area we cut cross country to the stream and found a flat spot to set up our tent by 7:10pm. 13 hours of hiking with lots of steep ups and down. We were pooped!
After quickly setting up the tent, we had dinner and to bed by 8:30pm..no reading or journaling!
Major milestones: We passed the halfway point of 94 miles in this year's hike. We also passed 100 mile mark of this section hike. Lastly, we passed the 2100 mile mark of miles hiked of the AT...only 89.8 miles to go!","Cloud Pond Lean-to

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619920,"Day 15 - We woke up at 5:15am. It was supposed to be at 4:30am via the alarm, but we had a faux pas. ET set it for 4:30 PM instead of 4:30 AM. So we hurriedly got packed up and began our cross-country...er cross-forest hike back to the trail at 6:05am.
Within a quarter of a mile we reached the Pleasant River and found a campsite full of tents, some for hikers we recognized. Based on our map, this was in the no-camp zone, but obviously it wasn't enforced. Soon after the camp, the AT crossed the River in a boots-off ford. Once across we were in another world. The trail was smooth and well graded. We were in Gulf Hagas! A preserve of sorts, for a canyon with lots of waterfalls.
We continued up the trail following Gulf Hagas Brook to the base of Gulf Hagas Mountain. Like yesterday, we had 4 peaks to climb. The first was a steep, 800 foot climb to the top of Gulf Hagas Mountain. The day was warming up, so this was a hot climb. Next was a steep climb up West Peak. Then a moderate 500 foot climb up Hay Mountain. Finally our ultimate goal was in sight, White Cap Mountain. We made the final push up the 500 feet and arrived at the top of White Cap by 6:10pm.
Some of the significance of White Cap Mountain is this is where we get our first good view of Mount Katahdin...and that is our picture of the day, ET looking at Katahdin in the distance. We hope to be there in about a week.
The other significance of the top of White Cap Mountain was cell service for Spider's Verizon phone. Why this was important was that Spider had arranged with Shaw's to do a food drop in the middle of the 100 Mile Wilderness. That way we didn't have to carry 9 days of food, especially up all these mountains.Shaw's had asked us to confirm that we were on schedule or to adjust the schedule when we got to the top of White Cap Mountain, so that is what we did.
That's the other reason we are pushing ourselves and hiking long hours to stay on schedule. We only have so much food and if we dawdle, our food will run out and we will be in trouble. There are no grocery stores in this Wilderness.
After taking our pictures and making our call we headed off the mountain at 6:40pm. The first part was similar to what we saw in the White Mountains last year...just a scree of medium sized rocks that required carefully stepping from rock to rock. Later the trail became more vertical and crews had built steps out of flat rocks. We had seen some steps on the other mountains we had climbed this day, but the amount we saw on the back side of White Cap Mountain was amazing.
After 1.4 miles and about a 1200 foot drop we arrived at Logan Brook Lean-to at 7:45pm..almost 14 hours of hiking. We arrived to find no one at the shelter.  So we got to pick the best tenting spot. Dinner at 8:50pm and to bed at 9:20pm. Our longest hardest day finally complete!","Stealth Camp near Pleasant River

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619921,"Day 16 - We allowed ourselves to sleep in after our long day yesterday and knowing that today's trail is mostly downhill. We finally got moving at 6:40am and hit the trail at 7:45am. While we were packing up, two hikers came in, got water and continued on. We wondered where they had spent the night.
On the trail we followed Logan Brook for several miles and it was mostly roots, rock and mud. We soon crossed an unnamed gravel road, then started through an area that had lots of bogs. We had been seeing lots of SOBOs all morning and some day-hikers. It is Saturday after all!
We finally reached the East Branch of the Pleasant River that was listed as a ford, which we rock hopped across. Then came our first climb of the day of about 500 feet, but it was nothing compared to what we had been doing the last couple of days. We met a SOBO who said the trail got much easier on the other side of the next mountain. We hoped so since we needed to make some miles given our late start.
The next mountain was Little Boardman Mountain. It was about a 400 foot climb and would be our high point after leaving Logan Brook Lean-to. As such we were going to try phone the White House Landing. It turns out that in the middle of this Wilderness is a Fishing Resort that also caters to hikers. From talking to other hikers who have stayed there, it's a place to get a shower, sleep in a bed and have a non-freeze dried meal. Since we will have been on the trail in the Wilderness for over 6 days, we smell. We have put in some hard days and are a day ahead of schedule, so decided we deserved a reward. The hikers said it's best to have a reservation, thus our attempt to call them. 
Once on top we tried calling the White House Landing but only had one bar and nothing would go through. Finally Spider tried texting and that seemed to work. Later a SOBO mentioned she had good Verizon service on a nob further down the trail, so we tried to call again and this time it worked.The guy at White House Landing confirmed he had received Spider's text and the room was reserved for Monday night...Wahoo!
Coming off of Little Boardman Mountain was a little steep at first but quickly turned into a flat forest trail where we could stride out. One interesting thing we crossed was an old dam on Cooper Pond that was constructed of large rocks piled at the outflow. There were so many rocks that it held the water back, but water still flower through the rocks and crested Cooper Brook.
We made it to Cooper Brook Falls Lean-to by 5:45pm. There were only 2 other hikers there so we all set up our tents by the Brook. The falls create a 6ft deep pool at it's base and many of the other hikers we had passed had commented on what a refreshing swim it was,  but to be aware that there are LEECHES...Yuck! Spider had read about the leeches in the ponds of Maine but hadn't figured the steams would have them too. But after 5 hot days on the trail, a cool dip beckonned us. So today's picture is ET enjoying a dip in Cooper Brook. Spider joined her later and boy did it feel good to wash off some of the trail grime. ET got out and found one leech on her. Spider spent a little longer time in the water and found about 50 leeches on him. Now these are not like the leeches you see on TV that are the size of your index finger, these varied in size from the size of a macaroni to the size of a staple. So was it worth it? Yep.
Back at the tent, we cooked dinner and talked to the other hikers. Finally to bed at 8:45pm. Lights out 9:40pm. We are in position to get to our food drop tomorrow.","Logan Brook Lean-to

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620105,"Day 17 - Knowing we needed to be at Jo-Mary Road at 9:30am to meet the person from Shaw's for our food drop, we did some calculations on what it would take to hike the 3.8 miles, including a breakfast stop. Thus the alarm was set for 4:45am. We tried to quietly pack up as the other 2 hikers were still asleep. On the trail by 6 am. 
The trail continued as a nice forest walk so we could maintain a good speed. The trail appeared to be an old road that went to Cooper Pond. We stopped for breakfast then continued on and arrived at Jo Mary Road at 8:59am. 
At 9:45am AJ from Shaw's showed up with our food...Whew. We were down to 2 bullion cubes and tea bag! AJ also brought us a cold soft drink apiece and a note from Dreamer, the hiker we had met at the West Carry Pond Lean-to just after the Bigelow's and later hung out with at Caratunk House. Apparently he had arrived back at Shaw's the day after we left. He had taken a couple of days off with a friend. He wished us well and gave us his phone number thinking we might reconnect someplace around Katahdin. Hopefully we can.
After guzzling our sodas (boy, were they good!), we hit the trail at 10am. The trail continued as a forest walk for a couple more miles then reverted to the rocks, roots and mud we know and hate! 
At about 1:30pm we came to Lower Jo-Mary Lake and saw a sandy beach in the shade. Best yet the wind was blowing a cooling breeze off the lake...how could we resist? We only had about 2 miles to go to our destination shelter. We had been hiking in the low 80s temperatures and sweating and the bugs had been progressively getting worse. So we plopped down on the sand and enjoyed a bug-free, cool rest. Best yet Spider had 3 bars on his Verizon phone and send off a couple of journals.
After about a hour of sitting there looking to the South at the riffle-covered lake, something caught Spider's attention out of the corner of his eye..it was a black cloud coming from the north..Hmm. Then we heard a rumble in the distance..Uh oh! We quickly packed up and hit the trail. As we hurried up the trail, the rumbles got closer and soon we were hiking in the rain..Darn. You can't outguess Mother Nature!
We arrived at the Potaywadjo Springs Lean-to at 3:35pm. The rain had stopped 20 minutes earlier but we were soaking wet. There was no one at the shelter, so we debated about staying in the shelter or setting up the tent. The shelter offers space to hang the wet clothes to dry (although not much dries in 80-90% humidity) but with the rain ending, the bugs would be back and the tent is a bug-free zone. We opted for the tent.
The tent pads were some of the nicest we had seen (this helped in our tent vs shelter decision). They were areas raised with fine gravel, rather than leaves scraped off exposing dirt/mud. The gravel allowed the water to drain. So the place we set up our tent was already fairly dry. Once set up, ET went to get water and came back raving about the spring. Turns out it is the largest spring on the AT. It's 15 feet in diameter with cold, clear water bubbling up in the center. A plank has been laid on rocks out to the center of the spring. You walk the plank to the end and dip your water container into the water!
Next we took off our wet clothes, climbed into the tent and put on some dry clothes. Now we could relax some more. What a difference from a couple of days ago when we arrived at the shelter at almost 8pm!
At 6:15pm we got out of the tent and headed to the shelter to cook our dinner. In the meantime a NOBO had arrived and set up in the shelter. He was a young man from Germany called Grandma Alex. He said he was enjoying his hike and wasn't looking forward to going home. He said they didn't have any long-distance trails like the AT in Germany.
We finished our dinner and conversation at 7:30pm and went back to the tent. Lights out at 8:46pm.
Major Milestone: We passed the mark of only 50 miles to go to Katahdin.","Cooper Brook Falls Lean-to
",Potaywadjo Spring Lean-to,"Jul 28, Sun",11.40
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620107,"Day 18 - We woke by alarm at 6am. We were excited because today we were planning a near-zero hiking day (a Nero!) to the fishing resort we had called yesterday. We packed up and hit the trail at 7:10am. The trail had stretches of forest walk but several stretches where it was all rocks, roots and mud. 
After about a half a mile we took a short side trail to Pemadumcook Lake and had a great view of Katahdin... it's starting to look close! Later we stopped for a breakfast break then continued to the side trail to White House Landing. At least we thought it was the right side trail. There were no signs or indication that this trail led anywhere, but based on the information we had, we decided to take a chance. About 0.2 miles down the path there was a sign directing us to a dock. We found out later from the owner of the White House Landing that the Maine Appalachian Trail Club is unwilling to let him post a sign on the AT to direct hikers to his place.
We arrived at the dock at 9:50am and called the owner, Bill, and he said he would come pick us up. Within 5 minutes, there comes a boat. Bill loaded us and our packs and away we went, skimming across the lake. It was a lot faster than hiking!
We arrived at his dock, got off the boat, hiked up to his lodge and he checked us in. He had only one room with a queen bed, so we grabbed it. Now first things first...showers.
This is an interesting place. It's off the grid using well water, propane but no electricity. So the showers had a large tank over the shower that fed a gas water heater in the shower room via gravity which in turn provided hot water to the shower. The big tank also fed the cold faucet in the shower...tubes running all over the place, but it worked. We both had a nice hot shower. After 6 hot days on the trail, we needed that!
The building we were in had 4 bedrooms and a shared living room and kitchen. it was one of about a half dozen buildings on the property. Besides the lodge and our building there was an individual cabin, a bunkhouse, the shower and toilet building (no inside toilet facilities, just the pit toilet facilities by the shower) and a couple others. Lighting was provided by gas fixtures hanging on the wall that had to be individually lit. A very different kind of life.
Now, the laundry. After sweating for 6 days, our clothes could almost stand up on their own. The laundry facilities were two tubs, scrub board (like my grandma used) and a hand pump to pump water from the lake. We had seen and used a similar set up in a hostel of backwoods Tennessee in one of our earlier AT hikes. So using the camp soap we carry with us, ET washed and rinsed our clothes and Spider wrung out and hung the clothes on the clothesline. We were done just before lunchtime.
There was no lunch service but Bill said the lodge would be open from 12 to 1 pm if we wanted to buy snacks. So we headed up to the lodge and there we met Bill's wife Linda. She had done a lot of baking so we had to try her blueberry muffin and her Woopie pie. Along with chips, sodas and a few other things, we ate lunch.
The afternoon was spent doing a few gear repairs, reading, napping and sitting on the front porch of our building looking out over Pemadumcook Lake..and that is the picture of the day.
Dinner was served at 5pm and we were surprised to find out we were still the only guests. We ordered their pizza (which we had heard was huge..and it was) and split it. Along with some wine and beer, we felt very civilized. We had a good conversation with Linda and found out a little about their history of running the place (28 years) and a little about their family. Suddenly Linda grabbed a set of binoculars and said ""there's a moose across the lake""...a moose, just what we had been hoping to see! We shared the binoculars and each had a chance to watch the moose feeding in a cove on the other side of the lake. Linda said they sometimes actually come into her yard. We can only hope!
We headed back to our building about 7pm. We relaxed for a while then headed to bed at 8:15 pm. To sleep by 8:45pm. We really needed this day!","Potaywadjo Spring Lean-to
",White House Landing,"Jul 29, Mon",3.40
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620191,"Day 19 - We woke to the alarm at 6am. We got up, packed up our packs and hauled them up to the lodge in time for 7:15am coffee. Bill was the cook and at 7:30am served us bacon, eggs and English muffins, followed by blueberry pancakes. As he cooked we got to hear about some of the politics of working with the paper companies that own most of the land around.
After breakfast, we grabbed our packs and headed to the dock. We put ourselves and our packs in the boat and away we went skimming across the lake. We arrived at the original dock, said our goodbyes to Bill and hit the trail at 8:30am.
We walked the 0.2 miles back to the AT and just as we arrived 2 SOBOs came down the trail. They had hiked the AT last year and were back for a reunion hike in the 100 mile wilderness. We talked with them for a few minutes, then headed north. The trail started as a nice forest walk for a couple of miles until it began to follow the Nahmakanta Stream. Then the trail became mostly rocks and roots. There were also many more ups and downs. 
We had a decision to make on our destination. We could try to push for the shelter after the one we had originally planned to go to before diverting to White House Landing...but that would be over a 14 mile day. Or we could stick to the original plan and have a short day. Given our late start and the fact that this was going to be the hottest day of the week, we opted for the short day. So we have used up the day we gained going into Monson.
We took our first break on a gravel beach on Nahmakanta Lake. It was a little early, but we were hot and we had been making pretty good time. The next break was early too for the same reasons and it, too, was on a gravel beach of Nahmakanta Lake. We finally reached the shelter at 2:40pm. We set up the tent, then got in to rest, read, and journal. We commented that the only hikers we had seen were the 2 SOBOs at the beginning of the day. But about 4pm, a bunch of NOBOs came rolling in..7-8 of them. What a difference from the last couple of shelters we have stayed at. Today's picture is of our yellow tent with the Lean-to in the background and one of the other hikers with his tent in the foreground.
At 6pm we got out of tent to fix dinner and interact with the other hikers. Most were planning to do 16 miles to the last lean-to in the Wilderness, or doing 22 miles and exiting the Wilderness tomorrow! Ah youth!
We finished dinner and crawled back into the tent at 7:15pm. Lights out at 8:45pm. 
Major milestone: We passed out the 150 mile mark today for this hike. Only a little more than 38 miles to go!","White House Landing
",Wadleigh Stream Lean-to,"Jul 30, Tue",6.70
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620295,"Day 20 - It rained last night! It started around 9:30pm and rained on and off until 4:30am. As a result, neither one of us had a particularly good night's sleep. Being in a tent is like being in a kettle drum, each raindrop is amplified. Fortunately when the alarm went off at 5am, we found partly cloudy skies. So we packed up and hit the trail at 6:05am.
We immediately started our big climb of the day, 800 feet up Nahmakanta Mountain...and this was a very steep climb. We had lots of rock stairs that had been constructed specifically to send you straight up the mountain. When we finally reached the top, we had our breakfast break. We also had a great view of Katahdin..which is our picture of the day. 
Next we had a fairly steep descent off the mountain and we finally headed away from Nahmakanta Lake. We skirted Crescent Pond and were surprised to find boats and canoes chained to trees around the pond. With no road to the pond we wondered if they had to be carried to this pond...and the nearest road is a long ways away!
Next we headed down Pollywog Gorge...we love the name! Then we started following Rainbow Stream. This is a stream with 2 distinct personalities. When we joined it, it was a raging torrent flowing through a narrow canyon. There were shutes of water broken up by waterfalls. As we continued upstream, the land flattened out and soon we walking by large, mile-long pools of water connected by riffles. Ultimately we reached Rainbow Lake, the genesis of all this water. The trail had been a lot of rock hopping and root avoiding and we were happy when we finally arrived at the Rainbow Spring Campsite at 4:30pm. We were the only ones there!
To add to the excitement, we thought we heard a rumble of thunder, so we quickly set up the tent...but nothing materialized. Once Spider got the water from a nearby spring (that's why it's called Rainbow SPRING Campsite!) we got into the tent and relaxed.. i.e., snoozed until 6pm. Then out for dinner. 
While we were eating dinner a NOBO young lady came in and set up her tent. We later learned her trail name was Rose.
After dinner it was back to the tent. We were both so tired that it was lights out at 8:15pm.","Wadleigh Stream Lean-to
",Rainbow Spring Campsite,"Jul 31, Wed",11.90
Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620296,"Day 21 - The alarm woke us up at 5am. As we were packing up, Rose walked by and said that she was planning on getting to the base of Katahdin today (that's over 20 miles!) and summiting tomorrow. Wow. She also said she had heard of us from another hiker, Dreamer, who she had hiked with the previous day. Turns out he was staying at in a shelter only about 2 miles away. We hadn't seen him since Caratunk. We finished packing up and hit the trail at 6:10am
The trail continued to follow the shore of Rainbow Lake..which meant rocks, roots and mud. Then, periodically it would climb into the forest only to descend back to the shore again.
During one of these ascents we hear a voice from behind said ""I've finally caught up to you!""..it was Dreamer. We talked for a while and compared hiking plans and found we were on about the same schedule..including summiting Katahdin on Sunday. He said he would see us at the end of the 100 Mile Wilderness and off he went.
We finally reached the end of Rainbow Lake and began the major climb of the day, 400 feet up to Rainbow Ledges. The climb was moderate and soon turned into a slab climb. At the top we had great views to the South but to the north was blocked by trees. We wanted to make reservations at a hostel in Millinocket for tonight...but no signal..Darn. As we continued off the top, we came to another bald slab with a grand view to the north of Katahdin. 
We now descended back into the forest on a trail that soon turned back to roots and rocks. We went through several sections that were fairly level but were characterized by a forest growing in a boulder field. The boulders were 2-3 feet in diameter and covered in moss. Pretty in some ways, but hard to walk through.
At our early afternoon break, Spider turned on his phone (it's usually shut off to preserve the battery) and from the middle of the forest, had a cell signal. So he called the AT Lodge in Millinocket and reserved a private room. He also asked about a shuttle coming to pick us up. It was a little before 2pm and when told that we were about 2 miles out, the owner, Paul, said that he would have the shuttle there by 3pm. 2 miles an hour is easy to maintain on a good trail but some of the stuff we had been hiking on was not ""good"". 
So we packed up and hit the trail with a little urgency. At first things were not looking good...lots of rocks. But then the trail began to smooth out, including a walk on boards through a cedar bog. Finally we passed the caution sign for the SOBOs warning of no services for the next 100 miles...we had officially exited the Wilderness..Wahoo!
100 yards later we reached the road (We later found out that it was called the ""Golden Highway"" because it cost so much for the lumber company to build it!). We turned right and walked the quarter mile to the Abol Bridge. This is a bridge over the West Branch of the Penobscot River..a huge river. In the minds of many, this bridge is the end of the Wilderness and the beginning of the assault on Katahdin. A separate walkway was built next to the bridge for hikers because the bridge is a single lane bridge and is completely consumed by a fully loaded lumber truck. Half way across there is a great view of Katahdin...and that is today's picture.
There is a private campground with a country store just on the other side of the bridge and that is where we were to meet our shuttle...we arrived at 2:57pm. Sitting at a table with some other hikers was Dreamer. Many of them were enjoying an ice cream cone. They pointed us to a window on the side of the store so we ordered a couple of ice creams....Mmmm.
At 3:05pm the shuttle showed up. We and Dreamer piled our gear and ourselves in to the SUV and away we went in air conditioned bliss. In about half an hour we arrived at the AT Lodge. We checked in and picked up our resupply box...Thanks Ginny! We moved our gear into the room, then headed to the showers. Next was laundry and relaxing.
We headed to dinner with Dreamer to a local restaurant. Spider had a lobster roll and ET had scallops...after all, we are only about 100 miles from the coast. Back to our room and lights out at 8:30pm. The weather forecast for Katahdin is good for this weekend so we will position ourselves in the next couple of days to summit on Sunday.","Rainbow Spring Campsite

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620479,"Day 22 - We were awake by 5am even without an alarm. It sure was nice to sleep in a bed! We read for a while and worked on journals. At 6:15am Spider texted Dreamer if he was interested in breakfast...he immediately answered ""yes"", so we met in front of the AT Lodge and walked 3 blocks to the AT Cafe.
This Cafe has a unique tradition, each year, those who finish the AT sign a ceiling tile that, when full, replaces a blank ceiling tile. About 70% of the ceiling is covered with these signed tiles from previous years. Since we are unsure if we will be back to the cafe after summiting and are determined to finish, we cheated a little and signed it today. Today's picture is ET signing her name. 
After breakfast we went back to our room and did a preliminary packing of our packs then relaxed. At around 9am we moved out of our room so they could clean it for the next guests. We walked 4 blocks to a small market to buy Sunday's breakfast. Rather than our tradition of hiking a hour before breakfast, we decided we should have breakfast in camp before we start climbing Katahdin on Sunday...immediate energy. Likewise, rather than taking the time to heat water for oatmeal, we would eat a cold meal of energy bars...but we don't have any energy bars...thus the trip to the market. We also bought a couple Snickers bars for quick energy on the climb.
Back at the Lodge we called our families,  rested and read our books... that's what Zero Days are for! At 1pm Spider texted Dreamer about lunch and he said he was down the street at a pizza place, so we joined him.
After lunch we headed back to the Lodge. The shuttle driver said he was ready to go any time. So we grabbed our pack, put them in the SUV and jumped in. In 30 minutes and 20 miles later we were back at Abol Bridge. There are 2 campgrounds here, one state owned and one private. Since Dreamer already had a reservation at the private campground, we thought we would try there first. Turned out they had 8 slots left and one was next to Dreamer, so we grabbed it.
We hiked to our site and set up our tent. This positioned us for tomorrow. Baxter State Park has lots of rules and restrictions, not dissimilar to what we saw in climbing Mt. Whitney...and they all have to do with over-use and abuse by the public. One of the rules that will affect us is who can stay at the Birches Campground at the base of Katahdin. It is restricted to NOBOs who have hiked more than 100 miles before entering the park, i.e., have hiked the 100 Mile Wilderness. It is on a first-come-first-served basis for the 12 available sites. The sign-up sheet is at a kiosk a quarter of a mile from Abol Bridge as the AT enters Baxter State Park. So the early bird gets the Birches campsite and we hope to be one of them!
We rested and read until 5:30pm, then headed over to the camp store and restaurant for dinner. Back by 7pm and into the tent. Lights out at 8:30pm.
The Zero Day analysis of our health and well-being starts with how many falls we've taken, Spider 4, ET 5. The reason I start there is one of ET's falls affected her physical status. She was stepping on a rock to cross an old stream bed about 5 days back and the rock moved. She fell sideways into the stream bed. She scraped her knee, shin and elbow. She also bent one of her trekking poles and broke the carbide tip off. Fortunately nothing more than scrapes, so she was okay to hike. Spider bent her pole back to almost straight and we put a rubber tip on to protect the exposed end. (We carry rubber tips to transport the poles in cars, buses etc.). Then we were back on the trail.
Otherwise, we are blister-free on our feet. We have a few scratches from rocks and trees we have passed and mosquito bites. We are now using Ben's 100% DEET and which works well where you apply it, but the mosquitoes continue to find places where we didn't apply it. We don't want to overdo the application of this stuff since the sales lady said it is a neurotoxin!  So if we come back with a few new twitches, you'll know why!","AT Lodge, Millinocket, ME

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620584,"Day 23 - We woke up just before the alarm went off at 5am. We quickly packed up and headed out of the campground with Dreamer at 5:45am
We walked past the store and turned down a gravel road. The road soon became a trail and it crossed the Abol Stream on a wooden bridge. Half way across the bridge an orange line was painted on it indicating that we were entering Baxter State Park. Just beyond was the kiosk that had the sign-up sheet for the Birches Campground. We found that we were the first to arrive...Wahoo! So Dreamer was #1 and we were #2 and #3. We had a place to sleep tonight in the Park!
Dreamer is a fast hiker so he said he would meet us at the Birches and off he went. The trail seemed to be an old road that followed the Penobscot River, so it was easy walking. After about an 1.5 hours of hiking we stopped for breakfast next to the river. 
Back on the trail we soon left the Penobscot River and began to follow a tributary, the Nesowadnehunk Stream.(I wonder if they have nicknames for some of these unpronounceable river/stream names...this one could be ""Nessie""!) The trail now turned back to the usual trail that follows a stream, roots and rocks and many short ups and downs. 
After about a mile we had a gentle climb of about 500 feet, then the trail leveled out again. We had passed several spectacular falls on ""Nessie"" and we soon began to meet day-hikers heading off to see them...after all this is a Saturday! 
Next we came to the parking lot where all the day-hikers had parked. Obviously we were back in civilization. We headed across the parking lot and back into the forest. After skirting a couple of lakes and meeting some more day-hikers, we arrived at the Katahdin Stream Campground at 12:30pm. 
We made our way to the ranger station and checked in. He already had a list of who had checked in at the kiosk and it looked like all slots have been taken, so we were happy we got there early. He gave us each a card to show that we were in the Park ""legally"" and gave us directions to the Birches.
We arrived at the Birches at 1pm and there was Dreamer along with a couple of other NOBOs who had passed us on the trail. Dreamer said he had been there since a little before 10am. I said he was fast!
We set up the tent, got water, then sat around and talked for a while. Soon we headed to the tent to rest and journal. At 5pm, we got out of the tent and socialized with the other hikers. Many more hikers had come in while we rested and it was a very festive atmosphere. As you might imagine, for many, tomorrow would be a culmination of 4-5 months of hiking from Georgia. For others, like us, it was the culmination of years of section hiking.
At 5:30pm, we headed over to the ranger station to pick up a daypack. One of the services offered to hikers is the free use of a loaner daypack. Knowing this is a tough climb, the park provides these daypacks so NOBOs and SOBOs don't have to haul our heavier packs up the mountain. They also provide a place to store the heavy packs while we are on the mountain. So when we arrived at the ranger station, we went through the several dozen daypacks and each selected ones that seemed to fit us best. We then took them back to the Birches to do a little pre-packing.
As we ate dinner around 6pm, one of the hikers started a fire then brought out the fixins' for s'mores as a final celebration of the trail...and that is today's picture.
We went to our tent at 7:30pm..lights out at 8:15pm. Tomorrow is the big day!","Abol Bridge Campground

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620586,"Day 24 - We had set the alarm for 4:30am because we knew this was going to be a long, grueling day. There are several trails to get to the top of Katahdin, but the AT takes the longest and most difficult of them all, the Hunt Trail. Likewise, even though we only get credit for hiking 5.3 miles on the AT, the reality is that we still needed to get back off the mountain, too. So we would actually be hiking double that mileage. 
We finished packing our daypacks. Then packed up everything else in our regular packs. Breaking our normal routine, we then sat down and ate breakfast. By this time, the majority of the other hikers were up and moving. In fact, some like Dreamer, had already left!
We took our regular packs to the ranger station and hit the trail at 5:55am. The trail started out as a gentle walk following Katahdin Stream upstream. Soon the trail became steeper and we crossed the stream. Several weeks ago we had heard that the bridge over Katahdin Stream had collapsed and the crossing was a rock hop. Sure enough, when we got there the bridge was gone and a log was laid across some rocks as a replacement.
After crossing the stream, the nature of the trail changed. It became rockier and steeper, with rock stairs constructed in some places. By this time we had been passed by all the other hikers from the Birches!
As we continued up the trail, the rocks got bigger and the trail got steeper. Soon we were looking for finger holds and toe holds to pull ourselves up...our trekking poles more of a hindrance than a help. Finally, as we reached a huge rock outcropping, we collapsed our trekking poles down and put them in our daypacks.
This rock outcropping was the size of a 5 story building and had to be climbed by muscling your way up a series of cracks and ledges. In a couple of places, rebar had been inserted to aid in this climb. By the time we had reached the top of the outcropping, we were above treeline. The day was partly cloudy, in the low 60s with a cool wind blowing. Being that we were now above treeline, we were actually quite chilled by this wind.
After the outcropping, we faced a moderate climb up a rock, scree ridge. Finally at the top of the ridge, we passed what was called the ""Gateway"" to Katahdin. From here we had a ~1.5 miles hike on the so called ""Tablelands.""  It was a scree covered flatter area that steepened as it reached the summit.
By this time several of the NOBOs from Birches passed us headed back down. All delivered the message that Dreamer was waiting at the top for us but had to leave at noon to get off the mountain to meet his wife. (He was continuing down a trail on the other side of the mountain.) 
At about 11:30am we made it to Thoreau Springs, the only water for miles from the top. It was also where another trail, Abol Trail, joins the Hunt Trail. We continued to climb and could see, in the distance, the gaggle of people at the peak.
As we approach the peak, we could see Dreamer taking pictures of us and waiting to welcome us to the top. We arrived at the top at 11:55am..thus finishing our hike of the AT! 
As is customary, we waited our turn among all the day-hikers at the top, to have our picture taken with the Katahdin sign...which, of course, is our picture of the day.
We sat and talked for a little while and Dreamer suggested we consider a different trail off the top. Going back down the Hunt Trail was going to be almost as difficult as coming up it...and a lot of energy had already been expended. The problem was that our packs were sitting at the ranger station at the other end of the Hunt Trail...Hmm. Ultimately, we decided to head back down the Hunt Trail so we said our goodbyes to Dreamer and he headed off on the Knife-edge Trail and we headed back.
Going down the scree slope from the top was a little easier and faster than going up, but not much. As he made his way down the slope, Spider thought about his own level of fatigue and Dreamer's comments about going back down the Hunt Trail. So when we reached Thoreau Springs again, Spider suggested that we take the Abol Trail down. It was considered an easier, shorter route off the mountain, but steeper. ET agreed, so off we went on a new adventure.
The trail left the Hunt Trail and went to the edge of the Tablelands then dropped sharply down via a rockfall. The biggest challenge was finding a route through the massive rocks that didn't end with no place to go. The going was slow, but we were able to us our trekking poles to control our descent. The further down we went the more the trail began to flatten. When we finally reached treeline we had been working at it for about 3 hours. Fortunately at treeline the trail began to take on more of the characteristics of a trail rather than a rock climb. A total of 4.4 miles later we finally made it to the bottom of Abol Trail at 4:15pm...and we were pooped! 
The only thing was that we were now 2.5 miles from our packs! So we went to the main road and started walking. At least it was easier than rock hopping down a steep trail. We saw several cars go by in the opposite direction, leaving the park, but none heading our direction...Bummer. Finally, after about 30 minutes a truck came up behind us. We immediately stuck our our thumbs. The truck stopped and offered us a ride...Wahoo! They were pretty full, so they did some rearranging and finally piled us in. The last 1.5 miles was a lot easier than the first!
We arrived at the ranger station at about 5pm and wondered what time we would have reached this same spot had we taken the Hunt Trail. We retrieved our packs (the only ones left at the ranger station!), emptied the daypacks and repacked our packs. Next we had to get out of the Park.
Another couple whom we had met on the Abol Trail had gotten a ride from another car behind the truck. ET found out the couple had a car at Katahdin Stream and were headed to Millinocket, but they had to make a stop back at Abol Trail trailhead to connect with friends who had a car there. So we piled into their car and headed to the trailhead. 
When we arrived at the trailhead, their friends were not off the mountain yet. So we thanked them for the lift that far but said we would try hitching from there, knowing that they would pick us up once their friends arrived if we hadn't been picked up yet. We walked down the road and the first car to come by responded to our thumbs out. It turned out the driver was a young lady who had passed us on our hike up the Hunt Trail. She had recognized us, so she stopped. You never know when serendipity will work for you! Interestingly, she was a doctor from Halifax, Nova Scotia who liked ""bouldering""...using your hands and feet to climb over big boulders. Picking the Hunt Trail sure was a good choice! She said she couldn't find anything like this in Nova Scotia. 
We remembered this lady passing us on the Hunt Trail as nimbly bouncing up the rocks... as we lumbered on! What we began to wonder was why was she picking us up when we were the slow ones and we had been off the mountain for over an hour?! She must have spent a long time on top or the trip back down Hunt Trail was a bear. We think we made the right decision going down the Abol Trail!
When she asked where we wanted to be dropped off in Millinocket, we said the AT Lodge (Spider had phoned from the mountain to reserve us a room). She said that was where she was staying too...What luck! At 6:30pm we pulled up to the AT Lodge. All parts had come together and we had made it to the top of Katahdin and back to civilization... Wahoo!
We showered, dressed and headed across the street to the restaurant for a celebration. Spider celebrated with steak and lobster! Back to our room and collapsed in bed at 9:30pm...Mission accomplished.","Birches Campsite, Baxter State Park

Spider & ET,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620589,"Day 25+3 - Monday we took an AT Lodge shuttle to Midway, ME to catch a bus to Bangor, ME. From the bus station we took Uber to a downtown hotel. We walked the mile to the Post Office to pick up 2 boxes of non-hiking clothes for the next week...Thanks Ginny! Eventually we hooked up with our oldest son and his family who had come from California to help us celebrate our accomplishment.
We will now wander our way down the Maine coast, eating as much lobster as we can and enjoying Maine in a very different way than hiking through the woods. One of those lobster ""events"" is captured in today's picture  Eventually we will end up in Cape Cod where we will spend a couple of days before we fly home. 
Life is already different when we look out the window of the car at the forest we are passing and everything looks so familiar, yet we have just covered the distance in the last 10 minutes that would have taken us a whole day to hike...and no mosquitoes!
This year's hike was good in many respects. Even though we got wet a couple of times, overall the weather was good. We got to experience the heat and humidity but had many days starting out in the 50s. The bugs, while bad by our standards, were minimal according to the locals. Where hikers coming from the south complained about dried up water sources, that was never a problem for us.
Physically, Spider ended up in better shape this year than last..no nagging injury. ET ended up in great shape, however we both admitted that as we age one more year, we don't bounce back quite as fast physically as we did the previous year. The count of falls stayed the same as last reported: 4 for Spider and 5 for ET. Spider lost 10 lbs and ET list 5 lbs over the 3.5 weeks we hiked.
Our emotions are a real mixture. We have finally finished a trail that we have hiked 6 of the last 8 summers. We are proud, relieved, happy and sad. We have made friends on the trail that have continued beyond the trail. We decided to hike the AT because we both grew up in the West and knew very little about the East. We thought the AT would give us a more realistic view of rural living in the East...and it did. We met a lot of great, caring people living in small communities away from the chaos of big cities.
Likewise we experienced a trail that was very different than the Pacific Crest Trail we had previously hiked. Many people asked which trail we liked better. It is like asking which is better, an apple or an orange. The two trails are so different, they require very different skills, so it just depends on what you like or hate. The AT was physically more challenging because of trail conditions and it's tendency to go straight up and over every mountain. Resupply was easy. But we didn't have to deal with crampons, ice axes, 10,000 feet and above and resupplies miles and miles apart.
So what now? At our age the Continental Divide Trail is not on our radar...so no Triple Crowner's here! In fact our focus will likely be B&B to B&B/hostel to hostel hiking. Daypacks are much more kindly to older legs and bodies! Camino de Santiago sounds good for our next challenge!",,View Entry,"Aug 07, Wed",0
