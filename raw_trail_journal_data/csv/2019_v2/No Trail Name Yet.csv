No Trail Name Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607670,"This week was supposed to be all about doing shakedown hikes.  Temps in the mid 20s with single digit windchill haven't really cooperated. With a little luck (knock on wood), that's colder than I'd likely see on the trail. Even if I did, I'd probably come off the trail and take a zero day. Lots of folks already on the trail are doing just that. I wanna be hardcore and all but screw that. Extreme winter backpacking is definitely a thing but it's a different thing than I'm trying to do -- different gear, different training, different planning. I admire people that do it but I'm not one of them. 

I do wish I could have found more shakedown time. Oh well.  Today's short and cold journey did teach me a few things, and I'm feeling pretty dialed in on gear. I'm sure being sore all over isn't a problem, right?  ;-)",,View Entry,"Mar 06, Wed",0
No Trail Name Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607773,"Yesterday I hiked a few miles SOBO* to the Sam Morris Shelter and stayed the night.  I actually pitched my tent for practice instead of using the actual shelter.  I'm pleased with my gear and feeling mostly dialed in on that front.  The rocky ups and downs of The Roller Coaster** are making me feel very NOT dialed in physically. I'm sure glad I'll have my trail legs before I see that section again -- assuming I make it that far. 

Oh yeah, holy crap was it cold!  My sleeping bag and pad served me well but I think I found my weather low point. If I see colder nights on the trail, I'll just try to get to a hostel. 

One other note -- a coyote will scare the the pants off you when you're all alone in the middle of the woods and the howling starts. I knew we had them but I still wasn't expecting it in the wee hours. Or it might have been a werewolf. I never saw it. * SOBO is Southbound on the trail in ""hiker lingo"" as opposed to NOBO**The Roller Coaster is 13.4 miles of the trail from about Virginia Route 50 to just over the WV border.  It includes numerous 250 to 450 foot climbs, often covered in linear spans of less than 1/4 mile.  It is a section that most hikers love to hate.",,View Entry,"Mar 08, Fri",0
No Trail Name Yet,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608143,"Ok, $h!t just got real!  Today was my last day of work.  Fourteen years is a long time.  I'm sure it would have -- and may still -- hit me harder but I'm hyper-focused and distracted about leaving for the AT on Sunday.  
Everyone was super nice and supportive.  There are a ton of folks who I'm really going to miss.  Last days at work are a little like going to your own funeral -- people only say nice things!  ;-)
I did stumble across this article that lightened my mood.  I really love The Onion:
