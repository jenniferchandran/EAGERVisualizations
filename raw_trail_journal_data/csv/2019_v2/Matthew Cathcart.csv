Matthew Cathcart,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610511,"Okay.
I guess I should do one of these things. To be honest, I don’t really feel like pouring the time and energy into a trail journal but I also know that I’ll probably regret not having one when I’m an old fart who can’t remember much from the previous week, let alone years and years ago.
So here we go. I’m writing this in the back of my parents’ Subaru (thanks mom and dad!) as we make our way down to Georgia. We’re currently in West Virginia. We’ll be staying in Roanoke tonight and outside Amicalola Falls tomorrow night. And then we start hiking back north! This will probably be a pretty long entry since I’ve been mulling things over for quite a while now.
It’s pretty surreal that we’re actually DOING it. We’ve been talking about this for over a decade, and all the classic stereotypes that prevent people from hiking the trail have reigned supreme for a time: It’s not the right time. What about jobs? What about family? Maybe in a few years. Bills. Loans. The immense hassle that is packing up all your crap, moving it around, and storing it in little squirrel holes before forgetting about most of it. But here we are, on the other side of all the self-imposed red tape, and honestly none of it was really that bad. I guess I have a penchant for overthinking things and making them more difficult in my head than they actually are. (Example: actually creating a trail journal) Introspection at its finest! I’m sure there will be a fair amount of that over the next few months.
All things aside, I’m very excited. It’s getting hard to sleep due to the excitement, the anticipation. I know it won’t be terribly different immediately, no flashbulb moment as soon as I set foot on trail. That kind of thing will happen in time and creep up in slow realization. I’m just excited to get started. We’ve been waiting for so long. I’ve kept busy and distracted from it all by doing the prep work, and now that’s all finished and there is only time between me and the trail. I’m excited to sleep in a tent again. I’m excited to walk in rain, shine, mud, rocks, etc. I’m excited to earn a trail name. I’m excited to meet all the people. I’m excited for type three fun. All of it, rolled into one big ball of beauty. It was hard at first to get the proverbial ball rolling in terms of prep work and planning and the movement of undoing, but this thing has snowballed into something so massive and heavy now that it crushes everything in its path… In due time. 
So I guess I’ll keep waiting patiently. I’m pretty good at it by now.
I’m very thankful for all of the kindness we’ve encountered so far. Our families have been so helpful in driving us places, letting us store our junk at their houses, feeding us, supporting us even if they might not understand why we’d want to do something like this. Our friends have sent us cards, gear, food, drink, good vibes. Internet strangers have offered their friendship and advice. For something that on surface level may seem like an innately solitary experience, we’ve had a lot of other “teammates” pushing us forward. If any of you are reading this, hi!
People keep saying we’re brave for doing this. I don’t really feel like it’s that brave. It does however seem kind of crazy to me. In a good way.
I don’t know how often I’ll update this journal. I have a feeling there will be a lot of shorter entries that are more factual (“Walked from that rock to these trees today”) and less introspective. But who knows! At least anyone who wants to can follow my journey. Our journey. We’re all in this together.

Matthew Cathcart,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610835,"Started walking on the approach trail around 10 am. Mom and dad walked with us the first few hundred yards, up until the falls stairs. Approach trail was steep, and it was hot and sunny. Definitely not used to a full pack the way I used to be. Kim heard her friend bird (black-throated green warbler) immediately. Seems like a good sign. Mica sparkle flecks all over the ground for most of the hike... Ruins of the glitter bomb. Reached Springer summit around 1:30 pm, lunched at the shelter and then moved onward. Reached Stover Creek shelter around 3 pm, and decided to push on toward Hawk Mountain campsite. Reached the campsite at 5 pm, right after hearing coyotes. Hard day. Very tired. Total mileage today: 16.2 miles... But 8.8 of that was approach trail so we’re at mile 7.4! Maybe too much for the first day? Celebrated with (cold as it needs to be) Forest & Main beer with dinner. Thanks Bogdan!","Amicalola Falls Visitor Center

Matthew Cathcart,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610837,"Short day. Kinda bummed. My foot had started hurting about five minutes before we got to the campsite yesterday and I thought it just needed a good sleep (which I had). But yeah, hurt in the morning too. It loosened up throughout the day thought which was nice. Still tender, but manageable. I’d be crazy to expect to hike as far as we’re planning without any pain. Got on the trail around 9 am, hoping to make it to Lance Creek campsite. We made it to Gooch Mountain shelter around 1:30 pm, cooked lunch and Kim wanted to stop because her feet were bothering her, which is a valid stop reason. And the campsite ahead is 8.3 miles away... And there are only six tent sites... And the Gooch Mountain shelter caretakers expect it to be busy since they had some many people at the shelter last night, so... We’re tenting at the Gooch. Bad Frodo, who we met yesterday, is doing the same thing, which sort of swayed us to stay. Not what I wanted to do. I guess that means we’ll stay in Neels Gap at the hostel tomorrow. A little early for a hostel stay, but whatever. It’s tough because you’re balancing what your head wants to do with what your body can do, especially as you adapt to trail life. I just want to go until I’m exhausted and then sleep, rinse, repeat. Stopping early on a nice day (sunny and high 70s) bums me out, especially when the next few days call for rain. Oh well. I guess I’ll try and read, get some sleep tonight, and go hard tomorrow. We did kind of make a friend though, so that’s cool. Brent from Cincinnati. He gave us little plastic flamingos. Other highlights: black snake at Gooch Mountain shelter, hot ramen lunch, and seeing a palm warbler and a black throated green warbler!","Hawk Mountain campsite

Matthew Cathcart,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610841,"Woke up at 6:15 in the morning, and started tearing down camp. Left at 7:45, am. We could get better at tearing down camp and making breakfast quickly, but I know it will come. Bad Frodo left pretty close behind us, and we leapfrogged with him all day. Climbed Blood Mountain, which was awesome. Highest point on the AT in Georgia. It sort of felt like the Adirondacks but the foliage was all mountain laurels and rhododendrons. Awesome views. from the top, rockier than anything we’ve hiked thus far on the AT. Booked it hard so we could make it to Mountain Crossings in Neels Gap to try and get hostel space since the weather looks pretty crappy tomorrow (1.1 inches of rain, severe thunderstorms, wind). Really not stoked on taking a zero so soon, but the temperature is supposed to get down to 35 tomorrow night and our bags are only rated to 45. We got there and there was only room for one... So we ended up staying with Josh, one of the workers there, and his friend Christina, at one of the Blood Mountain cabins. Pretty good deal, since it’s cheaper, and way nicer than the hostel... And just as close. We also got our first mail drop at the outfitter and it felt like Christmas! So great to have new food! We should have enough to get us into NC. Pizza and beer for dinner. Feeling good, strong, like I can crush the miles that I want to. Highlights: trillium hillside, white-breasted nuthatch, blue-headed vireo, tufted titmouse, brown water snake (not sure what kind), and a crayfish in the middle of the trail at Lance Creek!","Gooch Mountain shelter
