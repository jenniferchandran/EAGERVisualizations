CHRISTINE BOGART,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607761,"In 6 days I’ll be in Georgia starting the journey of a lifetime.  I’ve had things ready to go for several weeks and have enjoying my time before I head out.  But I’ve been thinking,  I have family members who are betting on when I’m going to quit and others who think I’m crazy for even thinking of hiking over 2000 miles.  I’ve done other things over the past 53 years others have thought were crazy so I’m really puzzled on why they are even questioning what I’m doing now.  Well, I guess if they are talking about me they are leaving someone else alone, LOL.   You know, why sit around and dream of things you could be doing when you could be out doing them!!!  Sooooo (with my tongue sticking out, thumb on my nose wiggling my fingers)  Hope you all have a super duper day and Happy Trails!!!!!",,View Entry,"Mar 08, Fri",0

CHRISTINE BOGART,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608045,"I can't believe this day is finally here. I've been planning this for almost two years and I'm sitting at the airport waiting for my flight to Atlanta!   I have a lot of emotions going on right now.  I'm not the type of person to let my emotions show and up till a few years ago I wouldn't let myself feel any type of emotions.  But that's another story.   With that being said I'm sitting at my gate and I'm excited, scared, nervous, and a lot more I can't even think of right now.  This is going to be an epic journey and I it starts in less than 24 hours.  God look over me and everyone on the trail.",,View Entry,"Mar 14, Thu",0
CHRISTINE BOGART,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608086,I couldn't wait.  I flew into Atlanta and arrived at the lodge at 1:30. After I checked in I hiked the approach trail down to the visitors center and signed in. I'm hiker #967!!  I didn't have my pack so I didn't weigh it at the visitors center but it's 24 pounds with food and water.  After sitting in on a quick class I headed back to the lodge.  It was awesome!!  The stairs weren't too bad and the rain held off so it was a nice afternoon.  I'll start off from the lodge in the morning and head North.,"
