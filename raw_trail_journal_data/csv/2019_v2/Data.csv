Data,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614195,"I expected to start hiking two days ago,but delayed my start due to heavy thundershowers. Monday was clear and cool, great hiking weather. I started at the visitor center and had to wait for them to open at 9 o'clock, so I could register my car and sign the hikers log. I decided to hike the north ridge trail instead of the steps to save the wear and tear on my knees. I was joined by Slow Hokey Poppy and his daughter and grand daughter who were starting at the same time. It was a good start for my hike to Neels Gap.","Amicalola State Park

After Sassafras,  the trail was re-routed around Justus Mountain (3219'), it was a nice surprise not to have to climb it out of Cooper Gap saved me 400' of climbing and 400' of downhill hiking.

It was nice and quiet all night, some others are camping at lance Creek campsite and some at Jarrard Gap. No signs of bears at my campsite.","Gooch Mountain Shelter

This is my 7th climb up Blood, Great views from the top and I love the Blood Mountain stone hut on top, a classic!  It was clear on top but there is a chance of rain later. There was a group of girls up there celebrating one of their's wedding day.  After a hike down to Mountain Crossings at Neel's Gap, I checked in, arranged a shuttle back to Amicalola Falls to get my car tomorrow, showered off, hand washed my clothes, ate a cheeseburger and a pizza, and relaxed and enjoyed the company of my fellow hikers. There are at least a dozen of us here, we were all happy to be out of the rain.","Campsite s/o Jarrard Gap

Data,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614204,"I have decided to skip the section from Neels Gap to Deep Gap, I just wanted to hike up Standing Indian Mountain and Albert Mountain in the time I have left on the trail. 
 I got a shuttle from Splitter at Neels Gap back to Amicalola Falls and picked up my car and drove to Standing Indian Campsite. I parked my car at the back country information stand and hiked the Kimsey Creek Trail up to the Appalachian Trail at Deep Gap. From there I hiked to Standing Indian Shelter. There was about 8 other hikers at the shelter and sleeping in tents nearby. We all hung our food bags high due to recent bear activities in the area. But there was no problems while we were there. ","Standing Indian foest service campsite

Data,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614207,"From Standing Indian Shelter, I hiked up Standing Indian Mountain (5435') then down to Carter Gap Shelter. Actually a great day for hiking. I got to Carter Gap about 2 PM and decide to hike out tomorrow.  There were 4 of us at the shelter. I thought it might rain, but it just got cloudy and a little foggy. The skies would change every hour, sometimes clear sometimes not. The winds were 10 to 5 MPH. The shelter sits on a ridge, so we could feel it when the winds were strong.","Standing Indian Shelter

Data,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614209,"HIked over Albert Mountain (5250'),one of my favorite mountains. This my 4th time up. I like the rock climb up and the views from the fire tower on top of the mountain. From there I hiked to Glassmine Gap and hiked the Long Branch Trail back to my car. The Standing Indian Loop is a good short 2 or 3 day hike. From the campground I drove to Franklin NC and stayed at Ron Haven's Budget Inn.  I have had a good week of section hiking, good weather, good company, no falls or injuries. Not bad for a 68 year old. ",,"Franklin, NC","May 20, Mon",12
