Chris drove me down to Virginia, and we met Matt in Elkton for breakfast before heading to Shenandoah National Park and the start of my hike at the Big Meadows Wayside.  Matt and Chris hiked with me for a couple hours before sending me off.

Woke up too dim light but went back to sleep till around 7.  It was 27 degrees with a stiff easterly wind.  Shortly after starting mi hike I came across two deer and they totally ignored me as I walked by about 20 feet away.  Later came across a couple of guys doing trail maintenance- it was nice chatting with them.  Did not see anyone else on the trail today, and found myself a nice stealth campsite about a half mile south of Elkwallow.","Birds nest 3

Met Wayne from the Potomac Appalachian Club.  He was doing trail maintenance and took the time to give me some of the history of the section of trail I was hiking - always interesting!
Stopped at Tom Floyd shelter to have lunch and met “Wrong Way”, a NOBO who started in Georgia and was hiker #4 hit the trail this year.  His uncle was picking him up at the Rt 522 crossing for a little break with the family.  When I got down to 522 his uncle had just arrived and he introduced me before they went on their way.  I expect Wrong Way will pass me on the trail in a couple of days.

Last night their was a couple staying at the hostel, Steve and Karen who were doing a six week SOBO to raise awareness of overdose deaths.  Also, Brian, a college student who wants to write, but decided he needed more life experiences in order to improve his work.  He was going SOBO.  Bob, another SOBO, was also spending the night and like me is retired.
Starting out this morning it was very foggy and cool with temps in the mid 40’s.  Warmed up nicely to around 70 with sun and clouds so it was a great day.  I met Sarge on the trail and we walked about 4 miles together.  Sarge is a 70 year old Purple Heart veteran from Florida who is doing a section hike to Pennsylvania.  He was staying the night at the Molly Denton shelter and I stopped there for lunch before moving on.  While I was there Old Bastard strolled in with his granddaughter to show her the shelter and hike some of the trail with her.  Just before I left Mojo Mama stopped by on her way to Mountain Home.  She has been there for a week preparing for her flip-flop, and was returning from a rainy day/night shakedown hike.  I expect we will cross paths again as we make our way to Maine.","Mountain Home Cabin Hostel

Was up a little after 7, and got an early start on my way to Harpers Ferry.  The trail was relatively easy today as I left Virgina behind and entered West Virgina.  Decided to take a detour to a deli about 0.3 miles off trail.  Got a turkey grinder and some resupply and continued on my way.  Couldn’t hold off long on the grinder so I had an early lunch!
Signed in at the AT Conservancy, I am #50 for flip-flop hikers this year, then made my way to the Tea House Hostel where I am spending the night.  Wrong Way showed up just before I was heading out for dinner.  Look forward to seeing him on the trail tomorrow.  Reader was also staying at the hostel- he is doing a flip-flop and started at the Delaware Gap.  Slo dog was also spending the night and starting a Nobo flip tomorrow, so I expect to be seeing him on the trail.","David Lesser shelter

On the way to Tumbling Run shelters I was passed by 7 Sisters and his daughter Evergreen who were backpacking with their dog.  Evergreen is practicing for a two week backpacking trip in the Cascades in Northern California.  They were planning to do 15+ miles that day, so I don’t think she will have a problem backpacking this summer.
When I made it to the shelter I met the caretaker Kurt, and his trusted companion Mocha (who is getting a little grey in the muzzle!).  It was really nice talking with Kurt, and the shelters and site are beautiful!  There are two shelters here - one labeled “snorers” and one labeled “non snorers”.While at the shelter I met 22, who is on the trail in support of 22 too many, a group trying to raise awareness of veteran suicides and providing aid to them and their families.A couple, Bird Man and Warrior Princess have just started their Nobo flip flop and were spending the night.  I expect I’ll be seeing them on the trail.  Slo Dog showed up and we shared the snoring shelter.  Got really cold during the night, and was 32 degrees in the morning before I left.","Pen Mar road

The Boy Scouts were up early at about 5:30.  I think the we’re trying to beat the rain which was expected to start at around 10:00 am.  I got up just as they were leaving and packed up quickly as I had a breakfast date at a deli that is about a 1/4 mile off trail at a road crossing a little over a mile from the shelter.  As I was about to leave I noticed a pile of stuff on the shelter floor.  Warrior Princess was also getting up so I asked if it was hers.  She said no, so we assumed it belonged to the Scouts.  I grab the stuff - a stuff sack, a baggy with tp, and a piece of burlap, and packed it in my bag figuring I’d catch up with them at the next shelter which was there destination.
Leaving the shelter at about 7:15, I hit the trail heading for the deli!  About a half mile from the shelter I saw my first sign of bear activity in the form of a large pile of poop on the trail- looked pretty fresh too.  Had a fantastic egg, cheese, sausage, tomato, green pepper and black olive sandwich with a side of hash browns for breakfast!  Real coffee was good too.
I left the deli around 8, and caught up with the Scouts about 9:30.  Apparently the burlap was a bag that they were using for a bear bag to hang food. 
Continuing on, I made it to the next shelter just after noon and decided to stop and have lunch.  Just as I got going again the rain started and I put on my rain gear figuring this would be the start of the heavy rain that was predicted.  It didn’t rain long and I ended up in shorts and a t-shirt for the rest of the way into Boiling Springs where I planned to spend the night.  
When I got to Boiling Springs the ATC center was closed but I did find a number for a hostel on there bulletin board.  The forecast was still calling for 2” of rain overnight and the hostel sounded much better than walking back a half mile to the backpacking camp and spending the night in the rain.Found the tavern across the street from the ATC center and grabbed a beer and some dinner before being picked up and taken to the hostel.  When I arrived I found 22 was already there and it was just the two of us in the hostel.Rained heavy overnight and we lost power.","James Fry shelter

Hiking out of Boiling Springs the trail goes through about 10 miles of farm land.  The grass is green, the trees are flowering and leaves are forming.  Every now and then I would catch a sweet smell in the air- some like autumn olive, and others that I could not identify.

AG,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612575,"Odds and Ends (thoughts along the way)
Shenandoah was really beautiful and I think I would have lingered at the overlooks but it was pretty cold as they are exposed to the wind.  I think I started a little early to see the bears but hope to see them when I return to complete my flip flop.  Uncas, who started mid April had two sightings.
As I was making my way to Bears Den Hostel in Virginia I came across what I thought was a morel mushroom.  A couple of miles later I met a native who was hiking the ridge and he confirmed that I had indeed found a morel.  I didn’t keep it, so no morel for me.
The day I found the morel was warm and cloudless.  As the trees still lacked leaves there was very little shade.  That night I discovered that my scalp was a bit tender  which I attributed to a little sunburn on my developing bald spot.  Never an issue before but I had cut my hair very short before starting!  Fortunately, sunscreen was available in Harpers Ferry.
It seems that most of the trail in Pennsylvania travels through “Game Lands”.  I talked with a game warden on opening day for spring turkey hunting and was told the parcel I was hiking through was 46,000 acres.  He said the state had 1.5 million acres of game lands set aside and maintained by hunting license fees. Very big state!
Just before running into the game warden I had crossed a bridge over a fairly large stream which had an old convergence of water spewing out of a couple of metal grates.  It turns out that the water coming from the grates was being treated with lime before being sent back to the stream.  Due to previous coal mining the water in the stream has a pH of 4, and the addition of the lime was needed to bring the pH up enough to sustain life.  The previous day was the first time I had discolored (light brown-yellow) water which is due to heavy iron content.  Even the tap water at the 501 shelter was discolored.
Trail Confessions:
Bless me trail for I must leave.  It has been x (xx) days since my last shower.  My shirt has developed it’s own biome,and I’m not sure if it is repelling or attacking flys.  My socks are competing with their own peculiar funk, and I am forced to sleep with them on my chest in an attempt to dry them out every night.  My underwear....  well I only take them off for laundry as I’m afraid they might take off down the trail without me!","Bert’s Hostel

The climb up from Lehigh Gap reminded me of hiking in the White Mountains.  1000’ up in the first mile over rocks, sometimes a scramble needing handholds.  Fortunately most of the rocks had dried out from yesterday’s rain.  The day was cloudy but clear and the views were great.Saw my first rattlesnake today, a small one about as fat as my thumb.  As I was walking the side trail leading to the shelter I heard rustling in the leaves to my right.  The snake was heading away from the trail about 4’ into the leaves and brush. I didn’t see it’s head but the part I could see was off the ground, very stiff, and moving back and forth.  When I saw it’s tail it looked like it was vibrating but I didn’t hear any rattling.  I moved on.   I really paid attention setting up my hammock as the tenting site was only about 70 yards from where this snake was.  Earlier in the day a hiker passed me and asked if I had seen the snake just off the trail (I had not).  A large rattlesnake was coiled next to the trail and starting rattling as he was walking by.","Bert’s Hostel

I passed by a beautiful beaver dam that appeared to be 6’-8’ high at its mid point.  Just past the dam I saw a very large hoof print in the mud which I assume was from a Moose.  When I got to the shelter Lou, a Canadian hiking the Long trail said he also saw it and was surprised that a  moose was this far south.

I got to the Notch around 9 and found myself laughing out loud at the pile of boulders ahead of me!  I promptly collapsed my trekking poles and attach them to my pack as it was obvious that this was going to require my hands.  It took me about an hour and a half to make it through the Notch, and I had to remove my pack three times to squeeze through some boulder caves.  There was still some ice and snow in the Notch.  
I made fairly good time going up the Arm but definitely working up a sweat!   Made it to Speck Pond Shelter around 1 and had lunch.  Originally planned to stay here but it was too early in the day so I moved on.  Made it to Baldpate Lean-to just before 7.  Ewock, who I met at Full Goose was at the shelter and we were both exhausted after a long day on a hard trail.","Full Goose Shelter

The first climb of the day was Baldpate mountain, and as the name implies, it’s a little thin on vegetation!  Glad it was not raining as the ascent included a long section of steep rock slab.
While walking a very nice section of trail with grass overhanging the sides a rabbit came running around a turn in the trail and did an abrupt 180 when it saw me.  Seemed strange that it was running down the trail before it got to me.  About another 200’ up the trail I saw why the bunny was running - a fisher had caught it!  Didn’t have time to grab my phone to take a picture before it was gone.
Saw moose prints in the mud on the trail in several spots.
Just after noon I heard a strange squawking sound just off the trail and caught movement to my right.  I think it was a spruce grouse but it was really hard to make out in the pictures I took.  Decided to stop there for lunch and the bird came back and I was able to get some nice video.","Baldpate Lean-to

I talked with Tim for a while and he told me about the lodge which was built in the 1930’s and is the only one still in operation.  It is a beautiful log cabin, and Tim lives there year round.  For him the people staying at the lodge are family, and he enjoys talking with the hikers passing through.

We lost the trail while crossing a road.  It appeared that there was a trail marker on a bridge abutment but this turned out to be a white rectangular reflector.  Fortunately, soon after crossing the bridge we met another hiker who had also made the same mistake and was coming back after hiking a half mile down the road without seeing any sign of the trail.  Consulting Guthook, the trail just crossed the road, and going back we were able to find it.

We arrived at our planned destination, the Stover Creek Shelter a little before 4 but decided to stay even though both of us could have easily added a couple more miles.  We had a very brief shower on the way but not enough to get anything wet.
When he first joined me in Maine Matt said he was surprised at how early it was light outside in the morning as the sky was fairly bright by 5 am.  It was my turn to be surprised in Georgia, as the sunrise comes much later!  At 7 am it seemed to be just getting light out.","Amicalola State Park, Georgia

AG,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620618,"Matt and I had the shelter to ourselves last night.  He set up in the shelter and I hung my hammock under the large overhanging roof of the shelter.  At dusk the woods came alive with the sounds of frogs and insects.  When I woke up at 6 the woods were quite again and I could here the water running in the creek down hill from the shelter.  
The morning was nice and cool and we started walking around 8 am.  Around 10:30 we took a side trail to see Long Creek Falls, took a break, and filled up our water bottles.  The falls were impressive and worth the side trip.  The day warmed up but was still pleasant, and the trail was nice, perhaps with the exception of the spider webs which we kept running into.
We decided to camp at an overlook area on Ramrock mountain.  This was a dry camp so we stopped a couple of miles short of the campsite to fill up on water.  Matt also carried up a couple of our bladders for cooking water.  The campsite was beautiful and the overlook was the best we’d seen so far.
During our day on the trail we only saw a couple and their two children hiking.  We past bye another couple camping along the trail but saw no one else.","Stover Creek Shelter

AG,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620681,"A couple of items I forgot to mention about yesterday - 
When we stopped for lunch on our way to Ramrock mountain we started hearing automatic (like fully automatic) gunfire.  Not close, but not all that far off.  As we were eating dinner that night I remembered reading in my guide book that the military does special forces training in the area so I’m guessing that may have been the source of the gunfire.  
Last night at 11pm I was harshly awakened.  The first thought as I was waking was that a plane was about to crash on us.  An aircraft flew directly over us just above the trees.  It was incredibly loud!  It was a startling way to wake up and it took me a long while to get back to sleep.  I’m thinking those special opps boys were having a little fun with the hikers camping on top of the mountain!!
Today was my last day hiking with Matt.  We had a beautiful day, warm but breezy so mostly comfortable.  We found water when we needed it and made pretty good time to Neel Gap where Matt had parked his car before we caught a shuttle to Amicalola State Park.  We decided to go to town, get a hotel, shower, and hit up a restaurant.  Life is good!!","Ramrock Mountain

I only saw 4 people on the trail today, a SOBO flip-floper, a north bound hiker, and two south bound section hikers - Joe and Chick.  I met Joe first, about two miles north of Hogpen Gap.  He said he was hiking with a friend who was behind him and having a hard time today.  He asked me to let his friend know where he was when I saw him.  About an hour later I met Chick who was resting on the side of the trail.  I let him know I had seen Joe and that he was planning to stop at Hogpen Gap.   Chick told me he had called his wife earlier and arranged to be picked up at Hogpen Gap as he was tired and needed to get off trail.  Apparently Joe did not know this.  Chicks phone was out of power so he couldn’t let Joe know, and he said he was still very tired after resting an hour and was considering finding a campsite and walking out tomorrow.  This did not seem like it was going to end well!  Fortunately my brick was fully charged and I was able to charge his phone so he could call Joe and let him know what what was going on.  He would also be able to call his wife if he was not going to make it to Hogpen Gap.
After charging his phone I wished him luck and continued on my way.  I was at camp a little after 5 and had the place to myself until around 8 when some other hikers came in.","Neel Gap

I was concerned about water availability and started out with 2 full liters.  The first reliable source was 2.6 miles into the hike, and I wasn’t sure the other water sources would be running.   When I got to the creek it was running enough to collect water with a scoop.  I drank as much as I could and the topped off my bottles.  
Early in the day I came across some blackberries and supplemented my breakfast!!  I stopped at Blue Mountain Shelter and had lunch.  I had decent reception so I caught up on Eagle Wings journal to see how he was making out after getting back on the trail.  Looks like he is making great progress on some difficult sections of the trail!

I had planned to go to a campsite a couple of miles north of the Plumorchard Gap shelter.  On my way I noticed some of the water sources listed in Guthook were dry and I was a little concerned that the water source at the camp I was going to might be dry.  I stopped at Plumorchard for lunch and decided to get water from there.  A steep 0.1 mile side trail led to the spring which was flowing well.  I camel’ed up, filled my water bottles and also filled a 1.5 liter bladder to bring with me.  7 lbs of water and a full resupplied pack was a tad heavy!  When I got to camp I found that it did have water, but not much.  It took me about 10 minutes to collect 1.5 liters.  It’s not like taking a swim, but at least I can wash up some before hopping in the hammock!
Pat texted me earlier in the day that tonight is the peak night for the Perseid meteor showers.  Unfortunately my campsite is pretty well enclosed by trees.  It’s also cloudy this evening so I think I’m unlikely to see any meteors.

AG,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621085,"It’s been an eventful day!  I started out at 8 and made my way up the first climb of the day.  About a mile in I must have stepped on or close to a bees nest in the trail as I go stung on my right ankle.  After brushing the bee off (I later found it in my shoe) I ran up the trail a couple hundred feet hoping that I was not being chased!  It did not take long for me to feel my ankle starting to swell.  I stopped and took a benyldril hoping that would help, and I think it did.  I also zipped on my pant legs.
Around 9 I crossed into North Carolina.  I was pleasantly surprised that the trail had recently been given a trim as I had read that this section of trail was overgrown and difficult to walk through (another reason I had put the pant legs on).
At noon I came to the Muskrat Creek Shelter and stopped for lunch.  Dusty was at the shelter having her lunch.  She is a LASH completing her hike from Pennsylvania.  While I was having lunch Papercut and Sonic showed up - It didn’t take them long to catch up with me!  It was good seeing them and nice to hear about their adventures before starting the trail in Georgia.  They were heading much farther than I was today and planned on taking a zero on Franklin on Thursday.  I expect to get to Franklin on Thursday afternoon so we plan to hit the brew pub in town.  Since they hike much faster than I do I don’t expect I’ll see them after Thursday.
After lunch I continued on and reached my original destination (Standing Indian Shelter) rather early so decided to keep going to the next campsite at Beech Gap.  Not far north of the shelter the trail became very overgrown.  About a hundred yard section of the trail contained 3-5 foot tall flowering plants.  The flowers were loaded with so many bees there was a constant buzz in the air.  I essentially had to push my way through the gauntlet!  Most of the bees were bumblebees and thankfully not aggressive, even though a lot of them took flight as I plowed the flowers aside passing through.
Most of the trail to Beech Gap was overgrown which made for difficult walking.  It ended up taking me much longer than I expected to get to camp.  When I finally made it I set up my hammock and tarp, then went off to find water.  The side trail to the water source was much longer than I expected.  It ended up taking me more than a half hour to get water.  But at least I had enough to wash up after a long sweaty day!
The trail went over 5000’ today, first time since Katahdin for me.  The rhododendrons are just finishing their bloom and dropping peddles along the trail.
As I am writing this a heavy thunderstorm is passing through.  The rain is coming down hard and I’m sure the water running down from the tarp is splashing up on my underquilt.  I guess I’ll be drying gear out tomorrow.   Once again I have a campsite all to myself.","Campsite north of Plumorchard Shelter

AG,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621266,"I did not sleep well last night.  I was almost asleep when the storm came through and I got up to anchor the ends of my tarp (fully awake after that!).  Even after the rain had tapered off the lightning was like flashbulbs going off through my closed eyes.  My ankle was sore and itchy from the bee sting, and I had to stop myself from scratching it raw.
I ended up staying in my hammock much later than usual which worked out OK as the morning breeze dried everything out by the time I packed up and left.  The day was nice and fairly cool to start.  The trail continued to have sections of “car washes”, a term that Slo-go’en used to describe unmaintained sections of trail where the spruce trees felt like hard brushes when you pushed through them.

We decided to go beyond the next shelter and camp a Licklog Gap.  The water supply there is a half mile off trail so we picked some up on the way.  When we got there two section hikers were there.  We all had dinner together, and Papercut started a fire.  We all called it a night around nine.","Winding Stair Gap

I only met one other hiker on the trail today and he was from Israel.  He only has three months to hike so he has been doing various sections of the trail.  He appeared genuinely thrilled with his hike!  Like me his last week was in the rain but when I told him about Max Patch his face lit up with the prospect of having a view other than the inside of a cloud!

A couple hours into the day I scared another bear on the trail.  It took off down the trail and I thought it had turned off and into the woods.  I couple minutes later I met a trail runner who ran into the bear on the trail as she was running around a corner.  Caught between the two of us it decided on a quick departure on the down hill side of the trail.
There were some good views as I was climbing out of town this morning, but the best views of the day were from the Rich Mountain Fire Tower.  I took a detour off trail to get to it, but it was a  nice place to take a break.

AG,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623782,"Mongo gave Special Ed and I a ride to the trail crossing on route 608 around 8 this morning.  Special Ed is a much faster hiker than I am and he was taking a break when I caught up to him at the route 606 crossing.  We agreed to meet at Dismal Falls where we had lunch and rested.  On the way to the falls I met a SOBO hiker, Swan Dive, who I remember meeting in Maine!  She confirmed our water source information.  
After lunch we stayed together till we reach the last reliable water source where we stopped and filled our containers with enough water to take us through the next days hike.  From there we hiked another 2.5 miles to a campsite.","Lickskillet Hostel 
",Dismal creek ,"Oct 01, Tue",11
AG,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623783,"Special Ed and I were up and out a little after 8.  We did find some good water sources within a couple of miles from our campsite and definitely would have gone there if we had known about it.  We met three other hikers today one around 10, and two others who joined us at an overlook where we were taking a break just after 11.
After we left the overlook Ed went on ahead and I expected to meet up with him at Woods Hole Hostel.  Not long after we parted I heard Ed calling to me down the trail where he was standing by a large log laying across it.  As he approached the log he thought there was a skunk on the other side but as I came up he saw the it was a dog with a white tail.  The dog came around the log and laid down on the side of the trail.  I think it was a Basset hound, and it had a tracking collar on it.  He looked very thin and exhausted.  Ed tried to give him some water out of his hand which wasn’t working very well, so he took out a collapsible bowl and was able to get him to drink.  We tried to get him to come with us and got him to stand and take a couple of steps.  His left hind leg appeared lame and he laid back down on the side of the trail.  Fortunately we had phone service and after a few tries was able to contact the owner using the number on the dogs radio collar.  It took a while to explain where we were - unless you’re hiking the trail, mile 621.4 north of Springer is pretty meaningless.  We finally found a landmark that he knew and I found on my map - the communications tower on Sugar Run Mountain.  The tower was 1.4 miles north of me on the trail, and another 0.7 miles to the forest service road which accessed the tower.  The owner said he was on his way and I asked him to call me when he got to the tower.
Ed decided to head to the tower in anticipation of meeting the owner, and I stayed with the dog, who was called Blaze.  I tried giving him some potato chips and a piece of bagel but he wouldn’t take anything.  At one point he got up and started down the trail on wobbly legs.  I went to go get him as he was heading the wrong way and realized he was trying to poop which ended up being a large squirt of diarrhea.  I was able to get him to come back to me and lay down on the side of the trail.  He was breathing heavily and appeared to be having some stomach cramps.
The owner called me to let me know they were at the tower but didn’t see any trails.  I texted Ed to let him know they were there.  A short time later Ed texted that he found them and they were on their way.  Later Ed said the trail was around the side of a fenced in area and difficult to see.  If Ed had not gone ahead it’s unlikely they would have found it!
As I was waiting for the owners I ended up standing next to Blaze and using a branch with leaves on it to shoo away the flies which were buzzing around and landing on him.  It was a pathetic site as he didn’t have the energy to move.  I tried to give him more water but he wouldn’t take any. 
The owner made it to me and I think he was surprised at the dogs condition.  He thought it was heat exhaustion, which apparently had happened to him before and was the reason he had a strip of hair missing from his neck to his tail.  He picked him up and started down the trail and I followed.  After about a quarter mile we came to his friend who had come to help.  He had taken his shirt off and was planning to use it as a sling on a pole so they could carry the dog more easily.  I gave them the rest of my water to try and cool the dog down as they said I could get water at their truck which was just a couple of miles down the trail.  
I left them and continued on my way but I didn’t think the dog was going to live.  I stopped to get water at the truck, but there were three trucks there and I hoped I wasn’t stealing someone else’s water!  As I got to the road leading to the hostel there was trail magic - gallons of water, and a cooler full of soda, generously provided by Honey Buns, a 2019 thru hiker.  Thanks Honey Buns!!
When I got to Woods Hole I found Ed, grabbed a soda and filled him in on what happened with Blaze.  We both thought he was not going to make it.  To our surprise and delight, Blaze’s owner drove to the hostel with Blaze to let us know that they had gotten him out and it looked like he would recover!!","Dismal creek

Special Ed and I had breakfast with Neville who prepared eggs, savory crapes, and home made breads for us.  Afterwards we packed our gear and Neville drove us to the trail, saving us a 0.5 mile uphill road walk!
While I was heading to Pearisburg and the Angels Rest Hostel, Special Ed was heading to the MacArthur Inn in Narrows.  We parted early in the day as his pace is faster than mine, and plan to meet up tomorrow on the trail.
When I made it to Pearisburg the hostel picked me up at the trail crossing and brought me into town.  I was able to shower, do laundry, and get my resupply done before heading over to the local Mexican restaurant for dinner.  I had contacted Shannon, a friend from Nalas who lives in the area, and she and Keith joined me for dinner.  It was great seeing her again and meeting Keith, who is apparently a well known builder as he was recognized by a couple of other people at the restaurant.","Woods Hole Hostel

Ed and I got our signals crossed so we didn’t meet up till we reached the site of a spring we were hoping had water.  Fortunately it was flowing, and I was able to collect 2 liters in about 15 minutes.  As there is no water at the shelter, we cameled up and also filled all our containers so we would have enough to get us through tomorrow’s hike.  We reached the shelter a little after three and decided to continue on to a campsite another mile and a half north.","Angels Rest Hiker Heaven Hostel

6 miles into the day we made it to a shelter and both Ed and I stopped to eat an early lunch as it provided shelter from the rain.  I was a little chilled so I made some coffee to warm up.  It was the first time I used my stove at lunchtime since starting the trail.
