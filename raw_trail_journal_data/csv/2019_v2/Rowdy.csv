Rowdy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604520,"Pack is basically packed but the opportunity to go sauntering in the woods, especially on the A.T., just doesn't seem to present itself. Guess I also need to find a new hiking partner in this area. At 80 years of age, I think it best if someone is with me. Anyone in the middle Tennessee area interested?","Home, Moss, TN

Rowdy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604621,"   I love this time of the year. There is a bite in the air, the leaves are changing colors, and there is a very unique smell in the air in the forest. It is so rejuvenating. Doesn't look like I am going to get the time to get ot there this year, but hopefully, next year. Stay dry, stay warm, stay safe out there, but enjoy.","Home, Moss, TN

Rowdy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627823,"Here it is May the 3rd, 2020 and we are still in this raging pestilence. Things do seem to be getting better in some locations, maybe with the Lord's Grace, we will soon be out and about.I would very much like to go to the mountains near Damascus, VA and finish the section from Low Gap into Damascus. That would tie me up all the way to Johns Creek Valley for a push on Northward. The only reason that I can't is because of my wife's health condition. She suffers from geriatric dementia and weakness from a bad fall back in December of 2019. I can't leave her alone very long at a time and right now there is no one that can stay with here for me to go on such an adventure.   Oh, by the way, I turned 81 back in March, but still able to hump my backpack for a good hike. So, stay safe, stay apart, and hike on safely. See ya on the Trail.",,View Entry,"May 03, Sun",0
