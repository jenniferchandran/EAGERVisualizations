Arwen,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/488334,"Creation of this journal is of course premature. As I follow the trek of a close friend who is thru hiking this year, my excitement is mounting. Even if my own adventure is a few years away, putting the desire in writing makes me feel closer to achieving the dream. I was completely unaware of the Appalachian trail until the age of 25, in 2008. At the time, the idea seemed a vague unattainable concept, much like hiking Everest, running a marathon, or becoming a rock star. In stumbling, falling, and also in achieving a few milestones since that time, I have realized that the difference between an inspired pipe dream and a goal-in-progress is really only a mindset, coupled with desire and drive. I can do it, I want to do it, and I will do it. I am so very eager, and looking forward to 2019.Meanwhile, my heart is with Proudfoot. May the weather be beautiful, and the trail magic plentiful.",,Looking Forward,"Apr 13, Mon",0
Arwen,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/490417,"Across 4 days during the month of April I have hiked just under 60 miles of the trail. With a little more knowledge under my belt, I can now confidently say that I have ABSOLUTELY no idea what I am doing. I suppose acknowledging that is the first step to potentially being able to actually finish a thru hike. The desire thrives on. I can't wait for my turn to allow the trail to consume me. Go Proudfoot!",,Section Hiking,"Apr 23, Thu",0
Arwen,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/504170,"I was able to drive up to New Hampshire on 07/03 in order to spend a long 4th of July weekend accompanying Proudfoot during the first 27 miles of the White Mountains. The weather could not have been more beautiful.It has amazed me, every place I have ventured along the AT, how extraordinary the landscape in this country is. I never thought to myself, 'HEY! I should go vacation in Virginia!' or New Hampshire... or Maine... But one cool aspect of the AT, is that it really opens your eyes to the gorgeous make-up of places that, while somewhat un-exotic, are truly worth taking the time to explore. The U.S. has its own wonders. I was proud of my smooth climb over the 4,000ft elevation gain up Mt. Moosilauke. My fitness level has greatly improved during the past few months. Nothing however, stops the rage of the AT towards hiker feet. Towards the end of day 2, the familiar feeling of threatening blisters became apparent on my once-again tender feet. It would seem that it takes about 30 miles for me to start to feel it... I wonder how much longer after that before callouses provide some protection and relief from a daily brutal beating... Rock climbing and trail running added spice to the weekend adventure. I would say however, that the most interesting portion of the trail, besides the sights, is of course, the people. I enjoy traveling with Proudfoot immensely, because it allows me inclusion into the elite community of thru hikers. I met some incredible wonderful people, and was also exposed to a few jerks. The good news is that I am no longer completely naive to the nature of the AT community. As much as there is peace, love and hiking, there are also a lot of opinions, gossip, and drama. It seems a little ridiculous, but it's good to have an glimpse of one of the lesser known challenges on the AT. Keeping a level head and hiking your own hike seem to be reasonably effective. Keep your eyes on your feet, on the skyline, on the rocks in front of you, and on Katahdin :D
The weekend was incredible though, and when it was time to leave, I was wishing that I could have staying to finish out the Whites. Things at home seem to be a bit trivial in comparison, when I could be scaling mountains. Another gift of the AT - perspective.",,"Glencliff, NH to Franconia Notch","Jul 05, Sun",0
