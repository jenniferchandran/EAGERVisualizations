Training for this adventure - I started doing a 3 day a week work out (2.5 miles on the treadmill and then about 20 to 30 min on different machines to work on my core body muscles)in February 2016. I was motivated to start my workouts by watching Marilee's dedication to her workout routine (4 or 5 days a week). I have added to my workout the last few weeks the hike up and down the Lowes' hill (100 ft from top to bottom -- this is where the kids sled). I do this with my 40 lb pack. 15 times up and down is a mile and 1500 feet in elevation change.",,View Entry,"Apr 15, Sat",0

Gordon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566141,"May 25: Springer Mountain: 0 miles to Stover Creek Cove: 2.8 miles 
Started out the day finishing up a few items and sending a few email reminders. It is hard to get ready to leave for 30 days.

Marilee and I got my pack ready last night so it could be checked st the airport.

We left for the airport at 7:30 and everything went great at the checkin. Marilee and I said our goodbyes (I am really going miss her the next several weeks). Boarded the plane for Atlanta at 9:30.

Arrived in Atlanta at 1pm and was on Marta at 1:45pm. Survivor Dave picked me up at the North Spring station at 2:35. We stopped in Dawsonville, Ga for food. 

The last 13 miles on the trip the trailhead parking was on US National Forest dirt road. We arrived at 4;45pm. I loaded up my pack and back up (Southbound) the AT so I could start at the 1st AT blaze. It was 1 mile to top (1000 ft elevation gain) of Springer Mtn. After a few pictures and a sandwich at 6pm. I decided to hike some of trail vs spending the night at Springer Mtn. I was going to Stover Creek Shelter which was 2.8 miles. So I covered 3.8 miles my 1st day on the trail. I arrived at Stover Creek at 7:05 with plenty of sunlight to pitch my tent.

I met the people at campsite. There were 6 people in the shelter and 1 person tenting. 

I put up my tent first and since it was my first time it was taking a little long. Sebastian from Montreal come over to tell he had the same tent and I got him to show me the features of it I purchase the tent at 3pm yesterday (another story for later). 

I got the tent up, ate the other half of the sandwich I purchased in Dawsonville, and refilled my water bottles at the spring. 

It was a long day but it was good.

I am ready for tomorrow.","Springer Mountain

Gordon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566360,"Starting Stover Creek Shelter(2.8) and going to Gooch Mtn. Shelter (15.8 )-- 13 miles 
Several trips to bathroom during the night but I was up at 5:45. It was not light until 6:15am. I had 2 packages of oatmeal with pecans and 2 cups of coffee. At 7:30am I was on the trail. The trail starting out was good with a little up and down. Within the 1st hour I had at least 7 crossing of Stover Creek. The section to Hawk Mtn Shelter was mostly downhill with only a piece that had 700 ft elevation gain. I reached Hawks Mtn. at 8.1 mile post at 10:15am or I hiked 5.3 mi in 2.75 hours (I had planned on staying Hawk Mtn on first day of hiking). I called Marilee to check in and I left Hawks Mtn at 11am. 

My next stop was at Cooper Gap (12.3 mile post) for a snack. I arrived at 2pm. It was hard. It took me 4 hrs to go 4.1 miles. The terrain was back to being covered with roots, rocks and boulders and I had to hike over Sassafas Mtn. It was an 800 ft elevation gain over 1 mile on tough terrain. A couple of times I could touch the trail front of me; it was so steep.  Even after I clear the peak the downhill was hard because of large boulders. 
After a snack at Cooper Gap I left at 2:20. Justin Mtn up next it was hard because of Terrain but not as hard as Sassafras. 
I reached Gooch Mtn Shelter (15.8 mile marker) at 4:45om. I was on the trail 9 hrs and covered 13 miles. This is the longest I have ever backpacked in one day. The terrain was a big ""WOW"" today but I reached Gooch Mtn Shelter. My shoulders are sore and I have a hot spot on my big toe but very satisfied. I made Gooch on 1st full day on the AT. 
After I arrived in camp I got my water ready for tomorrow. For dinner I had peanut butter and honey on a tortilla plus some trail mix (too tired to cook). 
Spent the rest of the evening talking to people in the campsite. There are 6 of us who stayed at Stover Creek last night that made it to Gooch (Joe & Jake -  brother and sisters from NY and are going Franklin, NC; Chris from Atlanta and he is hiking for 14 days; Gabriel & Sabastian  from Montreal and they going to Maine). Memorial Day weekend has brought a lot of hikers on the trail. I saw 10 to 12 hikers during my 9 hrs.
Heading to bed at 9:15pm
It was a good day!","Stover Creek Shelter

Gordon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566361,"Gooch Mtn Shelter 15.8 miles to Woodys Gap (20.8 miles) : hiked 5 miles  I slept great last night.  I did not wake up until 6am. I got up and fixed breakfast and coffee and proceeded to pack my stuff and take down my tent.

I hit the trail at 7:40.

It was going to be short day since I decided I could not make Neels Gap which was 15.8 miles away and would have to hike over Blood Mtn. The last 8 miles before Neels Gap requires bear canisters and most hikers do not carry them due to the weight.

There were great views along the trail this morning ( I will post pictures) The terrain was still hard and very up and down like yesterday. I reached Woodys Gap at 11:10am and had gone 5 miles.  Marilee booked me a bunk at Hikers Hostel for tonight which is 7 miles off the AT. I had a snack and Hiker Hostel picked me up at 12:15. I felt better today but still a little tired-- I wish I could hike a few more miles.

I have spent the afternoon taking a shower, washing all my cloths (2 shirts, 2 shorts, 2 pairs of socks and my long tights- I wore my gym shorts as laundry was being done), and catching up on the internet since wifi has not been available on the trail. 

The Hostel is very nice and very clean. I am in a bunk room with 2 bunk beds.

A great story: I broke my reading glasses on the trail today. The Hostel did not have a pair I could buy and they suggested I call Mama's Taxis to take me in town (14 miles away) to buy some.

I called the taxi but no one answered. I took my shower and called again. Martha answered and I told her what I needed.  She said the fare would be $50 so I told her I would do without my glasses for a few days. She calls me back in 15 min and told me she was in a Dollar General and had reading glasses. She said she could buy and drop them off at the Hostel later tonight. I told her to buy me 3 pairs (cost was $3). She delivered them about 4pm. She just wanted me pay for glasses - I gave her a pretty tip and she did not want to take it because she said she was just doing me favor. I got her to take tip.. There are still good people out there.

I spent the afternoon on the porch (picture) checking out things on my phone and catching up on my journal. I order a medium pizza from Papa Johns. I could only eat half of it. Check weather and calling thunderstorm in the morning- not good.
That is it for today. I am heading to bed at 9pm.","Gooch Mtn Shelter

Gordon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566558,"Sunday, May 28 Started at Woody Gap at the 20.8 mile and finished at Neel Gap at 31.7. Today I did 10.9 miles.

The night at the Hiker Hostel was great. As I said last night, I went to bed at 9 pm and fell asleep immediately. I did not wake up until 3 AM to go to the bathroom (that is a long stretch for me). I fell back asleep and woke up at 6 AM as a big thunder storm was coming through and it was pouring down rain. I had wifi so I checked weather and it was supposed to clear by 9 AM but there was a good chance for storms this afternoon. I decided to take the regular shuttle at 9 AM. (The manager of the Hiker Hostel was originally going to make a special run for me at 7:30AM) I got up and packed and got ready for a day on the trail in the rain. (rain gear was ready)

Coffee was ready at 7:30 AM. I had about 5 cups. Breakfast was at 8 AM – muffins and fruit. (The fruit was very good.) There were 2 men from Tampa, Florida in the bunk house with me. They were involved in Boy Scouts and had gone to Philmont. They are out of scouting today since their boys are finished. Their boys were Eagle Scouts. These guys were 57 and 63 years old and were doing a 7 day hike for about 60 miles. 

The 63 year old (I will give you their names later) had tried a thru hike in 2008. He twisted his knee, stepped on a boulder (Boulders are everywhere on the trail.) before Hawk Mtn Shelter (8.1 miles and one day into the trail) An EMT had to hike in and take him out on a stretcher. His trail name is “One Day” and his friend’s name is “Footloose”.

Our shuttle took us up to Woody Gap. We arrived at 9:15 AM. I didn’t hike with them (they were going 4 miles) and I was trying to make Neel Gap by 5 PM. (I would have been ok arriving between 5:30 or 6 PM)

It stopped raining by 8:30 AM and it was dry. Blood Mtn is 8.5 miles and it was 2900 foot elevation gain over about 4 miles. The first miles were a lot of up and down (no switchbacks like we had at Philmont). The terrain was the same as previous day with a lot of rocks, boulders and roots on the trail. You have to watch every step. The difference was more rocks and boulders.

I went the first 2.2 miles in 1.5 hours (moving at a good pace considering the ups and downs plus the terrain.)

I arrived at Jarrad Gap at 12:25. I covered the last distance of 3.6 miles in 2 hours. The big climb started up Blood Mtn. I had 2.6 miles to reach the peak. I arrived at 2:35 PM. I had a lot of water and took some pictures of the view. There is a photo of rhododendron flower canopies over the top of the trail. They were beautiful and smelled even better. I felt great about my pace up the mountain. “One Day” and “Footloose” didn’t catch up to me.

The views on Blood Mtn were outstanding. 

Still no rain. I had a steep decline to Neel Gap over rocks and boulders. (See the picture) The AT blaze were marked on the rocks instead of the trees. Plus the rocks were slippery because of the rain and mud. Going over a boulder, my foot slipped and went into a crevasse on the boulder and my foot was stuck. It was steep and it caused me to fall. I went to my knees. I had to lean back to get my foot out and I couldn’t get up without taking my pack off. A person hiking behind me on the trail saw it and came up as fast as he could to see if I was ok. He helped me get up (He looked like a football linebacker). I was very lucky. I could have easily twisted or broken my ankle and the trek could have been over. I was lucky – I decided to slow down.

Decent to Neel Gap. I arrived at Neel Gap at  4:34 PM. I was on the trail 7 hours and 20 minutes and covered 10.9 miles. I felt good arriving before 5 PM.

The outfitter store was still open (closes at 5 PM). I decided to buy a new sleeping bag to reduce my pack weight by 2.6 lbs. I shipped my old sleeping bag home. My new sleeping bag weighs 17 oz. FYI- I weighed my pack this morning and it weighed 37.8 lbs. The 2 guys at the Hostel said their packs weighed 29.9 lbs. & 32.0 lbs. Also food and water in all packs weighed about 12-14 lbs. 

I have showered and I’m heading to bed at 9:30.

Gordon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566814,"Monday, May 29.  Neel Gap to Poplar Stump Gap (44.6) for total of 12.9 miles.

It is Marilee’s birthday today and I hate not being home.

I had a great night at the Blood Mtn Cabins. After I fell asleep I slept great. I woke up at 4:30 and was up at 5 AM. I wanted to get an early start since the forecast is calling for rain this afternoon. When I got up this morning, the hot spot/ blister on my big toe was bothering me. I decided I had to do something if I was going to make it 12.9 miles today. I decided on a moleskin patch. I did not realize I could not see the bottom of my foot (what time in your life does that happen?) so I had to get my 2x5 inch camp mirror while I held my head lamp to see my toe and what I needed to do. The blister was between my toe and the ball of my foot. I cut moleskin to fit with my pocket knife and held the moleskin in place with medical tape.

I made coffee and packed making my rain gear more accessible. I sent Marilee a text for her birthday. I turned in the key. It was a 1.0 mile back to the AT from my cabin, (The night before one of the guys at the Mountain Crossing Outfitter Store gave me a ride to the cabin.)

I hit the trail at 7:15 AM. The place I had to go onto the trail was thru a breezeway between the Hostel and the Store. This is the only place in the AT that the trail goes through a building. 

The climb coming out of Neel Gap was steep for the first 2 miles (800 ft elevation gain). However the trail had fewer boulders today. (I hope it stays that way). There were some great views today to the east. I stopped to take pictures at Mile Marker 36.2. (The AT does not have mile markers but I get where I am on my phone app.) I had gone 4.5 miles and it was 10 AM. After a few pictures and a water break, I left at 10:15. 

The trail was very up and down today. (Up 500 feet, down 300 feet) but the trail was better than previous days  - still rocks and roots but not as many.

I went over several mountains, too many to list.  I stopped to have lunch at Hog Pen Gap. I met a girl who had just graduated from college (somewhere in NY) and did not have a place to live so she decided to hike the AT. She is going south bound and had started in Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) since she had a friend that works there. She was hiking to Springer Mtn, Ga and a friend was picking her up and taking her to Maine to start hiking south from Katahadin (at the north end of the AT) so she could hike to NOC and cover all 2189 miles. This is called a Flip Flop hiker. 

I continued on after only a 20 minute lunch. And the trail was the same with lots of ups and downs. 

At the top of Poor Mtn (mile marker 40.6) some day hikers stopped me to tell me to be careful - about 20 minutes ahead on the trail there was a rattlesnake. It was still there when I got there but it was setting on the edge of the trail (The trail is only about 2 ½ to 3 feet wide.) and I couldn’t see it but I heard it rattle and he was upset. Another hiker and I marked the trail so hikers would stop. I am so thankful those hikers told me because I do not think I would have seen the snake in the leaves. 

I got to Low Gap Shelter (43.2 miles) and thought about stopping at the shelter since it looked like rain and this would keep my tent from getting wet. While at the shelter I made a few calls to get a shuttle to pick me up at Unicoi Gap tomorrow so I can stay at the Budget Inn and restock food in Hiawassee, Ga. I got it lined up with the shuttle driver, John. I decided to go to an actual campsite up the trail at Poplar Stump Gap (at mile marker 44.6). I looked like rain so I moved along at a faster pace. I arrived at 4:30 PM. That was a 9 hour 15 min day on the AT.

I got my tent up as fast as possible so I could put my stuff inside while I went and got water. The stream was .1 mile away. At night I always fill my 2 water bottles (1 liter smart water bottles – they are tall and slender & fit great in my pack) and 2 liter platypus. I use the 2 liter platypus for cooking, coffee, and to refill my water bottles in the morning. Since the water has to be filtered, it takes about 30 or 45 min to do 4 liters of water.

I tried to call Marilee but did not get her. I had settled into my tent when rain started at 7 PM. It rained hard awhile and then stopped. When the rain stopped I hung my bear bag of food. I had 2 peanut butter and honey sandwiches in tortillas tonight for dinner since I could not cook. 

I finally got my call to go through to Marilee and we caught up on how her birthday was today. 

I’ve been updating my my journal as I listen to the rain. It is raining hard. It is 9:30 and I am heading to bed. Thanks for reading.","Neel Gap

Gordon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566851,"May 30, Tuesday:  Poplar Stump Gap (44.6) to Unicoi Gap (52.9) for total of 8.3 miles
As I said it was raining last night when I went to bed at 9:30. I woke up several times during the night due to the noise the heavy rain was making as it hit my tent. 
At 5 AM it had stopped raining. I got moving at 6 AM and I began to pack my back pack. It was dry inside my tent but very muddy outside. I did heat water so I would have coffee & oatmeal. I was the only person in my campsite last night and it was located right next to the trail.
I hit the trail at 8 AM. I packed so if it started to rain I would have my rain gear available. It was cool when I started out. 
There were no tracks on the trail this morning. It was muddy. I was thinking as I walked that I was the first person to hit the trail.
About an hour into the hike I noticed a very fresh print in the trail. It was the paw print of large black bear. (See the picture) I never did see the bear but it had to be close. I moved along at a pretty good pace.
At 10:45 AM I had gone 5.0 miles. The terrain on the trail was better today about 70% of the time. It was foggy. I was walking in the clouds. Also there were a lot of flowering trees along the trail. 
I did hike over Blue Mtn today at a height of 4025 feet. After I cleared Blue Mtn it was downhill to Unicoi Gap over rocks & boulders. They were very slick due to the mud. I think I would have fallen 8 to 10 times if it were not for my trek poles helping me maintain my balance. 
I made it to Unicoi Gap at 1:15 PM. I called the shuttle yesterday and arranged a pick up for 4 pm (since I wasn't sure of the terrain or weather and I didn't want the person to wait on me). I called John, my shuttle guy at 12:45 when I had cell service and told him I would be there around 1:15 PM. He picked me up at 1:30. I am staying at Holiday Inn Express in Hiawasse Ga tonight. 
I dried my tent by hanging it over chairs around the pool. I washed my clothes and took a shower. And Ingle Grocery Store was about .4 mile from my hotel so I walked up there to get some re-supply and more moleskin for my feet.
I had dinner at a Mexican restaurant at 6:30 PM. I got back to my room and prepared for tomorrow. I plan on hiking without my big backpack. I will do a day pack and will need to do 17 miles since that is the place John, my shuttle driver can pick me up. He will bring me back to the same hotel for a second night.
I will be heading to bed before 10 PM since tomorrow will be a long day. 
I had a great day. I hope you did also.","Poplar Stump Gap

Gordon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566972,"May 31, Wednesday: Unicoi Gap (52.9) to Dicks Creek Gap (69.6) for 16.7 total miles
I had a great night of rest. I was tired. I got up at 5 AM to prepare for my day. I wanted to work on my right foot so it could get me through the 16+ miles today. I packed my day pack (food, power pack for my phone, 1 liter of water, filtration system for additional water, rain jacket, and first aid kit). I think my day pack weighed about 4 or 5 lbs. I am spending a second night in the same hotel so I can leave my full pack today. I will shuttle back to town. 
I had breakfast of eggs, sausage, pancakes, an extra sausage biscuit and coffee at 6:30. John. my driver picked me up at 7:15 and dropped me off where I left off yesterday. So I hit the trail at Unicoi Gap at 7:35 AM. I had a lot of ups and downs ahead of me for the next 16.7 miles.
I started out my day with a 700 foot climb over Rocky Mtn (pictures) and a 1400 ft climb over Tray Mtn in the 1st 5.2 miles. I reached the top to Tray at 10:10. I reached a group (father and 17 year old son) that I met at the hotel this morning about 1 hour in the hike. They left 30 minutes ahead of me.
I was moving at a good pace today. As I was passing Tray Mtn Shelter, Max (a person I had met a few days before on the trail) and Packman (a 25 year old that had been in the service and was looking for a job but could not find one so decided to do a thru hike on the AT) leaving Tray Mtn Shelter. I talked to them for a while but told them I was going ahead. Max passed me about 1 mile later and Packman caught up with me when I was taking a break. 
Packman had a crazy story. He started from Springer Mtn 1 1/2 weeks ago and got to Unicoi Gap last Friday and decided to catch a shuttle to Hiawassee, the same town I am staying in, to take a break. He was at a local Subway getting something to eat and a 69 year old woman asked him if he needed a place to stay and he did not need to pay just do some yard work. He stayed with her over the weekend and got back on the trail Tuesday. He tells me today, the AT is too hard and he was quiting. There are lots of crazy stories out there on the trail. 
I did not meet anyone today on the AT going south. I did pass 4 people going north. The mornings are great with the cool temperatures and the birds singing. 
There were some great views both east and west plus lots of flowers along the trail. 
I had originally told my driver, John to pick me up at 6:30 PM today at Deep Gap (3.5 miles left). I called him and told him I thought I would arrive at 4:15 or 4:30  PM. He said he would be there at 4 PM so I would not have to wait. I decided to pick up my pace so he would not have to wait. I arrived at 4 PM at Dick's Creek Gap. I was on the trail for 8 1/2 hours today and covered 16.7 miles, the longest single day of hiking I have ever done. (I did not have a back pack today but still a great day.)
The 16.7 miles had 4500 feet of elevation gain. That is huge. 
I got to the hotel at 4:20 and did laundry, took a shower and called Marilee. I went back to the same Mexican restaurant I went to last night since it was very good. I got to my room at 8 PM. I will do my journal and pack for tomorrow and hopefully will be in bed by 10PM. 
Another great day on the AT. Thanks.","Unicoi Gap

Gordon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567058,"June 1, Thursday: Dick's Creek Gap (69.6) to Muskrat Creek Shelter (81.4) for 11.8 total miles.
Got moving this morning about 5:30 AM. I wanted to have time to work on my right foot (blisters/ hot spots) and pack before I went down for breakfast at 6:30. Today will be my 7th full day on the trail. I have enjoyed having wifi available the last 2 nights. I could not get wifi any other nights I was on the trail. (I write up my journal, text it and photos to Marilee and she posts for me.) 
The last 3 days I have met 15 people who had planned  5 day treks to full thru hikers who have quit early because it is harder than they thought it would be. However I also get reports from south bounders that 5 of the people that I camped with the first 2 night are still going because they tell people to tell me ""hello"". They recognize me because I have on a white baseball cap and the group I know tells them to say hello to Gordon from KC with the white hat. It is interesting how the communication works on the AT.
I got picked up at 7:15 AM and was on the trail by 7:35 AM at Dick's Creek Gap at 69.6 mile marker. It was a great morning to be hiking - 60's, and gentle winds with lots of birds singing on the trail. 
I had several mountains to hike over today. 3700 ft elevation gain and 11.8 miles. I hiked over Buzzard Knob, Rocky Knob, and Courthouse Bald. The terrain was good but it was very steep; the last 3 miles having 2400 feet elevation gain. Some places I could not step up high enough to get to the next rock. I would sit on the rock and roll to the next.
Another interesting thing about the AT, the trail is normally about 2 - 3 feet wide but sometimes the brush is thick which makes it even narrower. A lot of the times the trail is cut into the side of a mountain. Because of this, my treking poles on the cliff side of the trail often do not make contact with anything.
The big news for the day, I crossed over into North Carolina (see pictures). There was no big fanfare or band playing when I crossed over but I was still excited to make it to NC at 78.2 miles. I arrived at Muskrat Creek Shelter at 4 PM today. I am sleeping in my tent. 
I was on the trail for 8 hours and 25 minutes today. I covered 11.8 miles with a lot of elevation gain. Muskrat Creek is at 4562 ft elevation which means it will be in the 40's tonight. 
I have covered 81.4 miles. This trip now registers as my longest back packing trip.
I am heading to bed at 9 PM as I hear the birds chirping and the stream flowing next to my campsite.","Dick's Creek Gap

I said goodbye to people at the shelter and hit the trail which was 10 ft behind my campsite at 7:15 AM. The big task at hand for the day was the hike over Standing Indian Mtn at 4742 ft elevation. I reached the top at 11:30 AM for 6.4 miles. It was quite the climb. For the next 6-8 miles I hiked through forest that had been damaged by the forest fires last year but you could still smell smut, the worst 6 miles of the hike. 
I reached Carter Gap Shelter at 3:15 and there was no water source. I had little phone service (it had been limited all day) but I called a shuttle driver for tomorrow. After trying to call Marilee and a hotel for tomorrow, I gave up and decided to try for the next campsite at Betty's Creek campsite another 3.7 miles away. I moved at a fast pace even though I was already tired from the 12+ miles on the trail today.
As I was hiking I met people who said Betty Creek Campsite was closed. I camped at an individual campsite that was .4 miles before Betty's Creek. I arrived at 5:30 PM. I shared the campsite with 2 people (an uncle from Denver and his nephew from OKC) who I had flip flopped with during the day. I was exhausted after a 16 mile day. I went to get water (1.4 miles round trip), fixed dinner (beef stroganoff), and went to bed after a 10 hour and 15 minute day on the trail. But all is good.

The big task for today was a straight up climb to the top of Albert Mtn at 5250 ft. It was a 2.5 mile trek to the top. The climb was the toughest I faced so far on the trail. The boulder or log step ups sometimes were above the height of my knees. It was a tough climb but I made the top at 9:40 AM. I took a break, took some pictures of the view and the fire tower atop Albert Mtn. The hike to Rock Gap wasn't bad since the trails were good and downhilll. 
I arrived at Rock Gap at 1:30 PM and waited for my shuttle. My driver called and said he had a flat tire.  In the meanwhile a guy pulls up in an old pick up truck and asks me if I want a cold Budweiser. I said ""sure"" and asked him ""how much?"" And he said it was free and he explained they were only 67 cents a bottle at Ingrams Grocery. And it was cold bottled Budweiser. I sat and talked and he told me his dream was to sail the inter coastal waterway from Florida to Maine. I like to ask people ""what's your story?"" The people are an interesting part. The backup driver arrived at 3:15. 
I checked into the Comfort Inn, washed my clothes, took a shower,  went to buy groceries, and went to dinner. I ate at Willy's BBQ. It wasn't bad but of course the last 2 nights my dinner was out of a foil bag. 
It's amazing all the thoughts I have as I am walking throughout the day. The reoccurring thought I have is ""I'm the luckiest man alive"". I learned about 8 years ago what real success in life is and for me that is that my loved ones are happy. I am so fortunate to have a wife I love and she loves me and my children are happy. Plus I get to spend my time helping other people and doing things I  enjoy doing. 
This lucky guy says ""Goodnight!""","Campsite South of Betty Creek Gap

Gordon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567390,"Sunday, June 4. Rock Gap (106.1) to Wayah Bald (119.7) for 13.7 miles.
My regular 5 AM wake up. I needed to work on my feet (they are a lot better) and check the weather. I'm planning on doing a sack pack today for 13.7 miles. However the story of the day is going to be the weather.
I ate a huge breakfast at the Comfort Inn and my shuttle driver, Jim picked me up at 7 AM. Jim is Italian and a Purdue Industrial Eng and at 71 years old, retired and moved from Chicago to Franklin. Jim told me that he had another pick up at the Budget Inn this morning. When we arrived I realized it was Gabriel and Sebastian, my 2 Montreal friends from the first two nights on the trail. I was impressed I was able to keep pace with them. Plus my brother and sister team from New York were also staying there (they were driving to New York today).
I hit the trail at 7:40 AM in a light drizzle and by 10 AM it had developed into a heavy downpour. At 11 AM I was walking to a shelter where I was planning to ensure my phone was dry. After a half a mile hike down I decided I was not going further down the side trail. I had just added an extra mile to my day.
My Kuhl Jacket has waterproof zippers and keeps the water out. The rain plus thunder and lightning had me concerned but I kept walking. The trail was flooding and I was walking through water, sometimes over my boots for several hours. 
Today I ate lunch as I walked. I normally only take a few minutes break during the day plus about 20 minutes for lunch so when I am on the trail I am walking which is how I am able to keep pace with much younger hikers. The rain stopped at about 1 PM and I arrived at my destination at 2:30 PM so I was on the trail for 6 hours and 50 minutes today.
My shuttle driver, Jim picked me up at 3:30 PM. I was soaked. I got to the Comfort Inn, washed my clothes, dried out some other stuff, and took a shower.
I ordered dinner in tonight by having a pizza delivered to the hotel. I talked to Marilee and finished packing. They are calling for rain like today for Monday and Tuesday so I am preparing my back pack for rain. I am going to look for possible destinations for tomorrow and head to bed.
I am almost 120 miles and I'm feeling good. Thanks again for following my adventure.","Rock Gap

Gordon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/567597,"Monday, June 5. Wayah Bald (119.7) to Nantahala Outdoor Center (137.3) for 17.6 miles todayWow. I thought a few days ago I said I would never do another 16+ mile hike in this terrain again. I actually had a plan. It was projected to rain all day (and it did) so I decided I would try to get to Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) so I could dry out. Then I would rest in the morning and try to do 6 or 7 miles on Tuesday. The weather was scheduled to be clear by Tuesday afternoon.The day consisted of 17.6 miles, rain, a fall, and NOC. What happened? I got up at the usual time, 5 AM to pack for the rain, get prepared, and eat my breakfast. My shuttle driver, Jim was supposed to pick me up at 7 AM (he was a little late) to take me back to Wayah Bald. I hit the trail at 7:50 in a light mist. I was in the clouds. At 10 AM it started to rain harder and I put on my rain jacket. I had two big peaks to go over today, Cooper Ridge Bald and Wesser Bald. At noon it stopped raining. I had lunch at Tellico gap at 1 PM and had gone 9.5 miles. It started to rain again and at times it was raining very hard. I climbed to the top of the second peak. By this time I was very tired and it was raining hard so I missed the trail and went about .6 of a mile out of the way (1.2 miles round-trip). I wasted 1 hour and 15 minutes doing this. I finally got started back on the trail at 3:15 with 7 miles to go to NOC. By this time it was raining very, very hard and the trail was mud, slick rocks and slick roots. Plus a steep decline. It would drop over 3000 feet over the next 3 miles. All of this made it difficult to travel at a fast pace. I had several near falls. Finally about 2 miles from NOC my feet went out from under me on a very tricky part of the trail with lots of mud and rocks. I hit hard and strained my back trying not to fall.I made it to NOC to check in at 7:15 PM. I'd been on the trail for 10 hours and 25 minutes today. By the time I made it to NOC my back was very stiff. I made it to my bunk (see pictures) and started to unpack and dry out.I went to take a shower and on my way back met 3 school teachers in their 20s and 30s on an adventure in the next bunkhouse to mine. I met them because I was moving very slowly down the stairs to the bunkhouse and they asked if I was OK and I told them about my adventure for the day. 10 to 15 minutes later I heard a knock at the door and they asked if I wanted a cold beer. So my dinner consisted of peanut butter on a tortilla and a beer. I talked to Marilee, took some Aleve and went to bed.What a day! I covered over 17 miles with my backpack on hard terrain in bad weather. I'm proud I was able to do that and it is supposed to be sunny tomorrow. Thanks for following.","Wayah Bald

PRE-HIKE NOTES
I'm feeling much better today after a good nights rest and the Aleve kicked in. i'm a little bruised and sore but I will be able to backpack today. I was up at 5:30 AM getting my chores completed. I went to the laundromat to dry my clothes from yesterday and while I did that I had a great breakfast overlooking the river race course. The outfitter was next-door so I purchased a new pair of shorts. One of the pair I had did not do well in the rain. I also saw Sebastian (my Montreal friend), and John (my Pigeon Forge friend) who was buying new boots at the outfitter. I went back to my room and plan to hit the trail at 10:15 AM. It's going to be a beautiful day.
POST HIKE NOTES
I hit the trail at 10:10. The first climb out of NOC was long. It was a 2500 foot elevation gain for 6 miles. It was a beautiful day and I had a great view almost the entire trip.Also the trail coming out of NOC is a huge chop in the side of the hill and it narrows.There was not much of a breeze today. Something I've noticed the last several days, when the air is still and a breeze comes I can hear it in the trees before I ever feel it.I reached Sassafras Gap Shelter at 3:15 and decided I did not want to stop walking. My back felt loose and the Aleve helped so I decided to go the 3.7 miles to Locust Grove Gap at the 147.7 mile marker. This puts me only 17 miles away from Fontana Dam.As I said the walk today was great and I only saw one person on the trail today. So the last two days I've walked 27 miles and have seen 2 people.I got to Locust Grove gap at 6:05, did all my camp chores and at 9:15 I'm ready for bed.

No one else camped at my campsite last night. Actually I have passed only one person on the trail and no one has passed me the last 35 miles or three days. I wanted to get on the trail by regular time of between 7:15 and 7:45 so I got up at 5:30 AM. I had coffee and a couple of breakfast bars while I packed. I hit the trail at 7:20 AM. There were a lot of ups and downs today but no big peaks to crossover. However there were a lot of places to climb down or up on boulders to continue the trail. I had to stop and think how will I climb down or up on this. I was also thinking as I was doing about 15 feet climb down across boulders, that this is quite dangerous. I actually was thinking with how our government operates, how would they let the general public do this? On the trail today they were several of those spots. 
A couple more things about the trail today. At Stecoah Gap which was about 3 miles into my hike today I saw my Montreal friends, Gabriel and Sebastian. They were going to have a zero day today at one of the hostels a few miles off the trail to let their bodies rest and their feet to heal.
Also I met on the trail as they were hiking south from Fontana Dam to NOC, the three ladies who had the bunk next to mine at NOC who brought me the beer. I found out today that they are from Winston-Salem. I arrived at Cable Gap Shelter at 3:45 and went 11 1/2 miles and was on the trail 8 hours and 25 minutes. 
I wanted to mention something about my family because I really miss them. Tyson finished second in his division and fourth overall in his PDGA tournament this past weekend. Dani and Chris celebrated their 13th wedding anniversary on Monday by going to see one of their favorite bands, the Disco Biscuits in Utah . Gordon and Paige, his girlfriend went hiking in Colorado over Memorial Day. Graham is staying in Manhattan this summer and started summer school on Monday. Marilee, my partner and I really miss him. She went to visit her mom in Altoona PA for a few days which leads to why I am really excited about tomorrow. Marilee is going to meet me in Fontana Resort tomorrow. I am currently 5.5 miles to Fontana Dam where I can catch a ride to the village.

A note on last night - I went to bed at
7:30 PM and a person came into camp making all kinds of noise at 8 PM. I got up
to see what was happening. It was Jon, my Pigeon Forge friend with sore feet
arriving at the shelter and just saw a bear so he was making noise to scare the
bear away. I talked to him for a while and went to bed at 8:30 PM
I slept great and I was up at 5 AM and packed my stuff in my
tent. No coffee today since I was going to hit the trail early. I was hiking at
6:20 AM. There was a steep 800 foot elevation gain starting out but the trail
was good except for huge boulders to climb over. 
I arrived at Fontana Dam at 10:30 and had no phone service.
Service has been very limited the last few days. But they have a phone at the
rest area so you can call a shuttle to pick you up. The phone did not work.
There were some people at the dock so I asked if anyone had phone service and
they said they did not have any. As they came walking up to me they noticed my white Wolfpack hat; the father and son both graduated from NC State. The father
in '72. I graduated in '71. I told him that I needed to catch a ride or walk
into the village. The wife/mom, Gloria Harter was heading that way so she gave
me a ride to the lodge. She's also minister at the only church in town. 
I checked in at the Fontana Dam Village Resort at 11 AM,
took a shower and then went to the laundromat. While my clothes were washing I
walked up to the grill at the resort and ordered the biggest cheeseburger and
fries they had, to go. Back at the laundromat I ate lunch as my clothes were
washing. I just laid in the bed in our room the rest of the afternoon. No TV
and no nap, I just laid there and rested. I moved to the outside deck with a
view of the mountains around 4 PM and to the grill area at 6 PM to wait for
Marilee. She arrived around 8 PM from a scary ride on curvy roads from
Knoxville. It was great to see her. It was a great day.","Cable Gap Shelter

First zero day on the trail after 15 days of hiking. I read
30+ journals on through hikers. They take at least 2 down days during the first
2 weeks. I had 1 schedule but skipped it. I'm not sure that was a good idea. But now I can be at Fontana Dam Lodge when Marilee arrives. My body and feet
needed to rest.
Marilee and I had breakfast and then went to the general
store for my big food supply for the next four days on the trail. I soaked my
feet with Epsom salts to help reduce some of the swelling. I had no feet issues
during my 75 mile Philmont trek but the terrain on the AT is much more
difficult and hard on the feet. 
We just relaxed most of the day but did visit the Fontana
Dam Visitor Center in the afternoon. Fontana Dam is the tallest dam east of
the Mississippi. We went to dinner and met a lot of interesting people when we
were at the lodge. We quit early.

feet. They're a lot better. 
I sorted through my stuff and rearranged the order I pack my
backpack since I wont be able to use my tent through the Smokies. You have to
sleep in a shelter. 
We went to the general store to pick up a few more items and
heard more discussion about  bear sightings. After my daily ice cream we
rode over to Fontana Dam Marina to look around. I showed Marilee where I came
off the trail and she actually hiked one of the trails a short way. We spent
the day just hanging out and resting. The Wi-Fi and phone service is almost
nonexistent. You would think in this day and time you could have Wifi

My last day at Fontana Lodge. I really appreciate Marilee coming to meet me. It was a great 2 days. My physical and mental state is so much better.
Marilee took me to the AT at 7:00AM. It was hard to say goodbye.
I hit the trail at 7:20AM. There was a 2800 ft elevation gain in the 1st 4 miles. I was going from 1700 to 4500 ft. About 30 minutes into the hike a black bear cub jumped across the trail about 30 ft in front of me and went up a tree. Only a couple of seconds later, the upset mama bear jumped on the trail facing me in a defensive position and was growling. Mama Bear was not moving since the cub was in the tree. She took up the entire 2 1/2 foot trail and then some. I decided to back track 20 yards and go up and around (the choice was a cliff on one side and a steep climb on the other). I did not get a picture since my phone was turned off but I was able to move around the bears and get back on the trail about 80 yards up.
I was making great time and my feet felt good so I went past the original shelter I had planned to stay at and went to Russell Field Shelter at the 180.4 mile marker.
There were some great views along the way today. The trail has been mostly dense and shaded so that the sun and views are a treat. 
I arrived at the shelter at 3:43 PM. I was on the trail for 8 hours and 10 minutes. A fellow hiker's fitbit says we did 540 flights of stairs and 34000 steps today from Fontana to the shelter. 
In the Smokies you have to stay in a shelter. (They do not allow tents.) The gnats are so bad. I set up my tent without the fly in the shelter to keep the bugs out. I got water and had dinner by 6 PM. Since 3 other people have shown up at the shelter, a college student from Germany and 2 former army buddies who are in their 30's, we are going to build a fire in the shelter fireplace. We had 2 more hikers join us at the shelter. It is going to be a full house. (shelter).

Not a lot of miles today but a lot of climbs up. There were some great views as I went over Rocky Top (you can see 360 degrees since it is a rocky top with no trees) and Thunderhead Mtn. Rocky Top was 5440 ft and Thunderhead is 5527 ft. These climbs are straight over the top and created straight up climbs and lots of boulders. 
Also today about 4 miles of the AT allowed horses on the trail. The AT connected with another trail. This part had great terrain to hike. You are supposed to sleep in shelters in The Great Smokies but the shelter was full so I volunteered to pitch my tent (less bugs in the tent vs shelter). 
Marilee went to Knoxville today for an early morning flight to KC. I really appreciate her coming to meet me. 
I went days not seeing many people but there are a lot of people who come from all over the world to hike the AT through the Smokies. There are 12 people in our shelter tonight and I think they are from 6 different states (none from NC)

Gordon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568581,"Tuesday, June 13: Derrick Knob Shelter (189.3) to Clingsman Dome (201.5) for 12.2 miles
I decided to get an early start since I had set a 4:00 PM pickup at Clingsman Dome and I heard there was a good chance of rain this afternoon. I did sleep in my tent last night since the shelter was full (11 people). There are a lot of people from all over the US hiking the Smokies. The AT runs 74 miles thru Smoky Mtn Natl Park. Also I wanted an early start since the trek today would be mostly up elevation. The elevation gain would be 3900 feet (one of my biggest) and it ends with 1500 ft climb up to Clingsman Dome. 
Staying at the shelter last night were a dad in his 30's, his son and 2 of his son's friends. They were also at my shelter the night before. Also last night was the first night I slept in Tennessee. I now have been in Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee. The AT follows the NC/Tenn border for about 70 miles starting at mile 174. I went into Tenn my second day in the Smokies. The trail crosses back and forth and sometimes is actually the border of the 2 states.
I hit the trail at 6:55 AM. Most of the trek was uphill. Part of it crosses through tall grass and sometimes it was as high as my head. The trail was about 1 foot wide in some places. As I past the 5000 foot elevation the forest turns from oaks, hickory and maple to cedars. At 6000 feet it was all cedars.
When I was in the tall grass (weeds) section of the trail, a wild turkey jumped on the trail in front of me and ran about 40 -50 feet down trail (again, no picture since my phone is usually turned off.)
The views today were the best I have had so far on the trail. Not only could you see both east and west but you could see the storm rolling in over the mountains.
I reached Clingsman Dome at 2:15 PM before the storms hit but the clouds had moved in so you could not get any views from the dome. Clingsman Dome is the highest point on the entire AT at 6612 ft. It is also at the 200 mile mark on the trail. I am at 200 miles!!!
At the dome today a 4th grader from Tennessee asked if he could interview me using a GoPro video camera. He wanted to ask me about hiking the AT and it is pretty obvious I just came off the trail (the backpack and I smell). He was doing a school project about his vacation. I gave him some overall stats about the AT and the facts about Clingsman Dome. I also told him about my encounter with an upset mama bear. That was the part he was most interested in. 
I called a shuttle service to let them know I was early and they told me they would send someone now. We were about 23 miles to Gatlinburg but it is an hour drive.
During the hour wait the storm rolled in with heavy rain, thunder, very close lightning, and hail. There were no shelters so I waited outside during this. The dad, his son and friends from Toledo, Ohio (they were at my shelter the last 2 nights) came up while I was waiting. At 3:30 PM the shuttle arrived and also gave them a ride into Gatlinburg. They were going to end their 6 day hike after 3 days due to the difficulty of the trail and the rain. 
I got to Gatlinburg around 4:30 PM and checked into the Days Inn (pretty rundown but I got a great rate and they have a shower). I laid out my stuff to dry and took a shower. That always feels great. I went to dinner at 6:00 PM at Great Smoky Mtn Brewery. I had the steak that my shuttle driver recommended and it was very good. I came back to my room, called Marilee, and went to bed while it was pouring rain outside. It is nice to be in a hotel room tonight.","Derrick Knob Shelter

Gordon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568802,"Wednesday, June 14: Zero Day in Gatlinburg
I decided to give my body a complete day to rest. I had noticed after resting at Fontana Dam I was great the first day out but the next day my body tired
earlier in the day.
I feel great now. I had a huge breakfast at Crockett's Camp Breakfast
House. I had 2 eggs, bacon, grits, biscuits and the largest single (thick)
pancake I have seen. When I saw the amount of food I ordered I was thinking, no
way I could eat all of that. I ate it all. Of course on the trail, my
breakfasts and lunches consists of granola bars and peanut butter mostly.
After breakfast I went to the laundromat. It was 3 miles from the Days Inn
(the hotel washer and dryer were not working). I stood on the street with my
thumb out and finally caught a ride. Most places I've been are more oriented to
the AT traffic and hikers are looked after a little more. Gatlinburg is really
touristy with all the usual tourist stuff. 
The rest of the morning I spent talking to Marilee and planning out my
final 6 days. It is calling for rain over the next 6 days so I want to plan a
stay in a shelter each night and that makes it a little harder to schedule
since the shelters are 6 to 9 miles apart. Also if it does rain some everyday,
my stuff will not dry out. I will just have to go with the flow. 
This afternoon I went to NOC outfitters and Walgreens to stock up on food
for 4 days. This will cause my pack to be heavier since I have only carried 3 days
worth of food max. I just rested this afternoon. I went to dinner at 6:00 PM to
Calhouns and had trout. 
Back to the room for my final prep for tomorrow. The car is picking me up
early and there is a 60% chance of rain so I will have to prepare for it.
I am heading to bed. Thanks for the support.

I was feeling great after my day of rest. The car picked me up at 7:00 AM and I hit the trail at 7:30. Hitch-a-Hike driver, Carol was my driver today and she told me the story of how she got her business started 7 years ago. The story is too long for the journal but it was very interesting. That is some of the best parts of my trip, the great stories that people will tell. I usually ask ""So what's your story?"" and people are happy to share. Everyone has a story.
There was a little climb to start the day but the trail was in good shape. It started to rain about 1 hour into the hike and it rained for about 2 hours. It was not hard but I put my rain jacket on because it was cool.
About 30 minutes into the hike a couple in their 30's from Dayton, Ohio met me on the trail. There are lots of day hikers - there is a 4 mile loop that people can take. They asked a lot of questions about the trail and they asked if they could take a selfie with me so they can tell their friends what I was doing. I also took a picture on my camera with them.
Almost all of my hike today was over 5000 feet so there were lots of cedars on the trail. The views were also outstanding today and I took several photos.
Something happened again today that has happened before. I was hiking through a grove of flowering trees for about 1/2 mile. As I was hiking about 15-20 butterflies started following me down the trail. They were small butterflies (1/2 to 1"" in size). They flew right in front of my face for 200 ft. It reminded me of a cartoon when birds or butterflies fly around someone's head.
I made great time today. I think I'm getting my hiking legs. I reached the shelter I was planning on staying at tonight at 2:15 PM so I decided to go to the next shelter 4.8 miles further down the trail. I arrived at TriCorner Knob Shelter at 5:15 PM. It rained hard the last hour of the hike. It felt good to arrive at the shelter to get my stuff dried out. There are 11 people in the shelter - a group of 5 (dads and sons from Cleveland, Ohio) who are doing a 4 day/ 30 mile hike, a group of 4 from Virginia (mom and dad in the group who are 62 and 63 years old and started in March to do a thru hike but had to stop. They are back to do a 60 day hike.) Also there is a 37 year old woman from Liverpool, England who is doing a thru hike. She started on June 4 and plans to finish Sept 10 (I think 100 days) which is about 1/2 the time most thru hikers allow. She does podcasts and she is recording this hike on her GoPro. I think her site is called ""Tough Girls"". I did the same amount of miles today that she did. : )
I had dinner and am getting ready for bed. Bedtime is always when the sun goes down. I try to write my journal in the evening but it is hard to find a comfortable position to write. It's the little things that you notice. I am hoping for good weather tomorrow. I did complete 10 % of the total AT (2098 miles) today and I only have 57 miles to Hot Springs.

Last night was the first time I had slept in a shelter with just with a pad and sleeping bag. I was hesitant to get moving as early as I normally would since I did not want to wake anyone up. The sun is up at 6 AM and the people in the shelter started to move so I started to pack my stuff . I slept on the lower level so I could get up during the night and not disturb anyone. The lower level in the shelter was not high so I could not sit up making it hard to get my stuff packed. I still was able to hit the trail at 7 AM.
I am excited about my day on the trail. I hiked over Mt Guyot early in the hike. I continued at the 5800 to 6200 foot elevation of the mountain which means most of the trees are cedar. After the rain yesterday and early morning dew the forest smelled like Christmas. The terrain was good and usually some up and downs. I started out today thinking I was hiking to Davenport Gap Shelter which would have been 14.8 miles. When I arrived at Davenport Gap Shelter the gnats and black flies were very bad so after sitting at the shelter for 30-45 minutes I decided to hike to Standing Bear Farm Hostel. I am very excited I covered 19.6 miles today, the most I have ever backpacked in one day.
I am also excited to be leaving the Smokies covering the 74 miles in only 5 days of hiking. 
I also crossed over the Pigeon River and under Interstate 40. There were white water rafters right next to the trail and I40. (pictures)
I arrived at Standing Bear Farm Hostel at 6:45 PM. The caretaker, Clark checked me in and gave me a tour. I got a single cabin for $30. I am hopeful I can post pictures of this tomorrow.
I was able to take a shower. The hot water is heated by propane as you shower.
I wanted to mention the speed hiker from England, Sarah is also here tonight. That means I have hiked at her pace the last 2 days. (34 miles in 2 days.)
The views were outstanding all day. Since I was at the hostel today I was able to have frozen pizza for dinner. 
Only 37 miles to Hot Springs. Did I say only? And I will meet Tyson on Sunday afternoon. I am very excited about my last 4 days on the trail.

Gordon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569009,"Saturday, June 17: Standing Bear Farm Hostel (237.2) to Groundhog Creek Shelter (247.5) for 10.3
I woke up several times during the night. It was bright outside since it was a clear night and over the creek, next to my cabin were thousands of fireflies/ lightning bugs going off. I was almost like a light show and I had a window view of it.
At 6 AM I got up and washed my clothes. I got in late last night since I hiked a lot further than my plan. There was no washing machine, just a washboard. They did have a dryer. This place is rustic. (See the photos)
I went back to my room and packed since I was not having coffee. I had a regular coke from the little honor system store (since I could) to get my caffeine fix for the day. When I went to the kitchen to fill my water bottles, Jim, the dad who is hiking with his son, James asked if I want a cup of coffee. I noticed James had a scout shirt on and I asked about it. I found out James was an 11th grade Eagle scout. I sat there another 45 minutes to discuss scouting. And forgot my water bottles in the process.
I left at 8:30 AM. The climb out of Standing Bear Farms was almost 2500 ft elevation gain. The positive part is they did have switch backs and the terrain was good. (In GA and Southern NC there were very few switchbacks, just straight up and straight down.) At the top of Snowbird Mtn there was an FAA station. I was told it was one of the first to use satellite to track planes. It was still in use. Because of the FAA station the top of the mountain had been cleared of trees making for great views. 
I was the first person to our shelter since I arrived early afternoon. It did rain very heavily for awhile. At the Groundhog Shelter tonight are Jim and James who I talked about earlier and a girl from Asheville out for a 1 night hike. I am 5 miles from Max Patch where I will meet Tyson tomorrow. I am really excited to see him. And I really miss Marilee.
I am going to bed early.

Gordon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569124,"Sunday, June 18: Groundhog Creek Shelter (247.5) to Walnut Mtn Shelter (260.6) for 13.1 miles today.
After I went to bed last night we had 4 more hikers arrive at the shelter. It was already dark and it was pouring down rain. The shelter was full so they had to pitch their tents. The shelter had a slant to it and it was very uncomfortable but it was dry. When I sleep in the shelter I can not start as early since I do not want to wake the other hikers.
I did start moving at 6:15 AM since the sun was up. One of the people who showed up yesterday was a girl from New Hampshire, a freshman at Vassar. She is going to see how far she can hike during summer break. She thought she would make NY (that would be a fast pace).
I left the shelter at 8 AM heading for Max Patch to meet my oldest son, Tyson. It was 6.1 miles to hike over 2 big elevation gains. I arrived at 11:30 AM. Tyson called and said he would be there around 2 PM. I just made myself comfortable and had lunch. He arrive at 1:55 PM. It was great to see him. He brought me an Italian wrap. It was delicious. We were at the 252.5 mile marker. We hiked to Max Patch. The AT goes right through Max Patch. It is a National Park Service area that is mowed. It was an old farm and they used the land for grazing their livestock. At the summit you can see a 360 degree view. It is stunning. A lot of families were having picnic lunches at the summit. 
After a few pictures Tyson and I took off for the first shelter that was 2.5 miles away. We got there at 3:15 PM and decided to go to the next shelter that was another 4.9 miles. It was a great hike with Tyson except for the part when it poured rain. We arrived at Walnut Mtn Shelter at 6 PM. Tyson had hiked over 7 miles in his first day on the AT. 
We got water and had dinner. Tyson is currently playing War, the card game with an 8 year old in our shelter. 
It was a great day with Tyson arriving and I got text or phone calls from Graham, Gordon and Dani. Plus I got to talk to Marilee. Happy Father's Day.","Groundhog Creek Shelter

Gordon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569312,"Walnut Mtn Shelter (260.6) to Hot Springs Public Parking Lot (274) for 13.4 miles today.
It rained throughout the night so we were glad we chose to sleep in the shelter. Well at least I was. Tyson is 6'5"". The shelter was not wide enough for him so his feet hung over the end of the shelter platform. 
We were on the trail by 7:15 AM. We started out with a 1000 feet elevation gain. Tyson could move up the mountain faster than me. (I am not fast up the elevation gains.) So he lead. We hiked over Bluff Mtn, talking and taking pictures as we moved up and down the trail. It was such a joy to have Tyson doing the last day on the AT with me. 
During the day we had 2 more good elevation gains. The terrain was good so we moved at a fast pace. Tyson said the downhill bothers his knees (most people say this) plus his feet and shoulders were a little tender from yesterday's hike. We reached Hot Springs in record time at 2:15 PM. We covered the almost 14 miles in 7 hours on the trail.
I did a little celebration dance and got a big hug from Tyson. 
The trek was COMPLETE. 
We went to get Tyson's truck and then went to have lunch at Iron Horse Bar and Grill. I got a huge hamburger and Tyson had a catfish sandwich. I was starving so I ate all of mine in just a few minutes. 
Tyson did great the 2 days on the AT and I am so appreciative of him doing this with me.
We did the 3 1/2 hour drive to Oak Ridge NC (north of Greensboro) to Tyson's house. We took showers and Tyson, Mel (Tyson's gf), and I went to The Stokeridge Tavern (their local hangout) for the Monday night special - wings and a pitcher of beer. I talked to Marilee and Gordon Jr.
It was a long day but I feel great. 
I am so appreciative of all the support I received during the trek. It really helped especially on the days when things were not going great or I was very tired. 
I also could not have completed this if it was not for Marilee's support, the nightly calls (when I had service), texts and especially the visit to Fontana Dam. I can hardly wait to get home to see her.
I will do a little summary of the hike in the next few days on the journal (mostly for my benefit so I can remember some of the facts and my final thoughts). If you are interested check back in about a week.
The next few days I am going to rest, enjoy hanging out with Tyson, Mel and Stella and visiting my mom in Sanford, NC. I will land in Overland Park on Sunday. 
It was an unbelievable experience.

STATS:

total miles of walking)76,200 ft elevation gain755,000 steps26 days and 23 hiking
days11.9 miles/ hiking day13.9 miles/ day (last
6 days)
 
PEOPLE ON THE AT:
I met and talked to an
estimated 140 to 160 people on the Trail, at Campsites and in the Trail Towns
(I recorded that I talked to 50 to 60 groups with 1 to 4 people per group).
Thru Hikers: There were
14 Thru Hikers in this group. 7 of them were heading north and trying to reach
Maine before the mountain there closes around mid October. 7 were hiking south
and were going to flip back to Maine when they completed the southern section.
I know at least 3 in this group were not going to complete the thru hike and I
would love to know if the other 11 make it.
Section Hikers: This was
the largest group I talked to and I estimated it to be around 100 to 120 people.
I consider you a section hiker if the group was doing at least 5 days or more
on their hike. Based on my conversation with this group:
-At least 50% of
this group would not complete the days or miles they planned to hike (example:
planned a 10 day hike and only did 7) due to the AT being harder than they
expected, sore feet or weather (top 3 reasons).
-Only 4 section Hikers
were doing a section longer than my 274 miles.
-I did not meet a section
hiker that was doing more than 30 miles that was older than me.
-I would estimate the
mix was 65% male and 35% female. I was surprised by the number of college age
females that were hiking solo. 

FAVORITE THINGS ABOUT
THE HIKE:
-Marilee meeting me at
Fontana Resort. I am not sure I would have continued if she
did not come and give me
support.
-Tyson meeting me on Fathers
Day and hiking the last 2 days with me.
  
FAVORITE THINGS THAT TOOK
PLACE DURING THE HIKE:
-Meeting and talking to
all the people and hearing ""their story"".
-Early morning on the
AT when I was refreshed and the only noise was the breeze
in the leaves and the birds singing.
-The Views that happened
every day on the Trail. The best view was at Max Patch at mile mark 253.
-Hours upon hours of being
able to think. There were a wide range of topics I thought about such as: 
   -what do I need to do to help the people I love to be happy
   - was it more efficient for me to take a 2 foot step or
2 1/2 foot step (E=mc2)   
   - what I can do to be a better husband, father and grandfather.
   - Plus many more subjects 
 
THE THING THAT HAPPENED
THAT I WILL NEVER FORGET:
-The face to face encounter
with the upset Mama Black Bear.

BIGGEST FEELING OF ACCOMPLISHMENT:
 -The 2 big days of miles
I had. 
     -Tricorner Knob to Standing Bear Hostel: 19.6 miles
     -17 miles into NOC in the pouring down rain
-Reaching Hot Springs
in 26 days (I tracked/logged 32 thru Hikers journals to plan my hike. 1 person did it in 25 days and 2 did it in 26 days.
The average was 30 days). My orginal plan was to be in Hot Springs on June 19 and that is when I got there.
 
HARDEST PART OF THE TRAIL:
-The climb over Sassafras
Mtn and Blood Mtn in Georgia on my 2nd day due to the steepness of the climb
and the terrain (rocks and boulders).
 
WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE
TREK WHAT I WILL REMEMBER
YEARS FROM NOW:
-The peacefulness of the
morning walk
-How my senses seemed
to be heightened (sounds, smells and etc).
 
MY THOUGHTS:
-IT WAS HARD - I thought I had trained hard to do this
trek.
I know I am in much better shape today than when I did the Philmont Trek 10
years ago. The trek was harder than I thought it would be. I would say it was twice as
hard. The elevation gains were brutal and the the terrain was hard especially
in Georgia and southern NC. You had to watch where you made every step and
there were very few switchbacks so you went straight up and straight down over
the mountains.
Most
people think about a hike on trails that are well traveled and maintained, The AT
is remote and not very well maintained in most places. The terrain is hard. At
times it took me 1 hour to hike 1 mile.
-PEACEFUL
– It was hard but it also was very peaceful. I had hours to reflect on my thoughts
and to enjoy the views, the sounds in the forest, the breeze, the surrounding
wildlife and the solitude.
-PEOPLE
– It was great to meet so many people and hear their stories. It became very
clear everyone had a story and each person's story is very important to them.
-ACCOMPLISHMENTS
– Setting goals and achieving them or doing your very best to achieve them is
very rewarding.
 
FINAL THOUGHTS:
Hopefully
doing this journey will have a positive impact on the way I view people and my surroundings.
I know it is has increased my awareness of how important it is to appreciate
and cherish the people you love. The time on the trail has help me reconfirm
what is important in life and how I measure success. 
As I
head home today I do realize I am the “luckiest guy in the world”.
Thanks for
following my journey.

On Friday, Seot 21 I will fly to Bristol, TN and catch a shuttle to Dennis Cove Rd at mile marker 418.2 on the Appalachian Trail (AT). The ride from the airport is 31 miles/43 minutes. Dennis Cove Rd is 144 miles from Hot Springs (where i ended my 2017 Trek). I am skipping this section this year for several reasons (will explain later). Mike Pearce will be my hiking partner this year. Mike has done several AT Treks in the past years. Mike and I met and became friends through Scouting. We will cover 171.7 miles on the AT (walking approximately 185 miles with the side trips). Our 2018 Trek will start in northwest Tennessee close to Hampton, Tenn. and  after hiking 47 miles through the Cherokee National Forest we will cross into Virginia (my 4th State on the AT). We'll hike through the Trail Town of Damascus, Va and go through Grayson Highland State Park (herds of miniature horses). We will go over Mt Rogers, hike through Jefferson National Forest and end up at Bland, Va (60 miles west of Blacksburg, Va) at AT mile marker 589.9 on Sunday October 7.

(My trail counter says 280 miles which includes the 274 miles of the AT that I hiked in 2017.)
What a great day to start a trek on the Appalachian Trail.
Marilee took me to the airport this morning for my 7:05 AM flight to Charlotte NC connecting to Bristol TN. I met Mike Pearce (MP) at the airport. We are both excited to get started and looking forward to the adventure that is in front of us.
My thoughts on the flight this morning as we start our 15 day trek - I feel prepared since I know from my previous experience what lies ahead. I have trained hard the last 30 days. In addition to my normal workout of running 10 miles per week and doing core body workout 3 days a week (which I have been doing for the past 2 years), I have walked 150 miles the past 4 weeks on non-paved trails with a 38 pound pack. I also did some hill climbing (Lowe's Hill) and added the stair climbing machine at the gym to my routine.
The unknown is how the terrain will be on this trek, how it will be hiking with a partner, the weather, and just the day-to-day things that will happen that will be part of the adventure. 
We landed in Bristol, TN at 12:15, our packs arrived and Bob, our shuttle driver was already at the airport waiting for us. Bob and his wife are the owners of Black Bear Hostel located .4 miles from Dennis Cove Rd. We arrived at the hostel at 1:15 and were able to buy fuel for our stoves and fill our water bottles. Bob drove us down to the AT and we started our trek at 1:50 PM. 
We hiked down to Laurel Fork Falls (2.0 miles) and walked along Laurel Fork Creek with several wooden bridge crossings until we reached the base of Pond Mtn, a 2.6 mile, 1800 ft climb. We met a south bound hiker at the spring from Madison, WI. His trail name was Cliff Hanger. He had started in Harper's Ferry, WV (the half way point on the AT). He had interesting stories about being on the trail during Hurricane Florence. 
This mountain kicked my butt. The temperature was about 85 and I got overheated. So for me the climb was slow. Mike Pearce (MP) did great. 
At 6:15 at the top of Pond Mtn, we stopped to fill our water bottles. MP arrived about 15 minutes before me.
We camped at Pond Mtn Flat campsite about .2 mile from the spring. We set camp, hung our food bags, had dinner and went to our tents at 8 PM. It was a long first day, but good. I'm excited about getting started tomorrow.","Dennis Cove Rd

We were up at 6 AM. Both of us had leg cramps during the night. We need to drink more water. But today is a beautiful day. We packed our stuff and had breakfast. I was not very hungry so I only had a protein bar. We hit the trail at 7:30 AM. 
Our first stop was going to be Shook Branch Recreation Center where they have bathrooms and water. This is only 3 miles and downhill. It was closed and locked for the season so no water and no bathroom. The next 4 miles we hiked around Watauga Lake and passed Watauga Lake Shelter which was closed because of heavy bear activity. The rest of the day is mostly uphill. 
We met a thru hiker heading south to Springer Mtn. His name is Sandals, he is hiking the entire AT in sandals! He is from Florida and started in Maine on May 29. We met another thru hiker at the spring getting water. His name was Jet. He was in his 20's. He started in Damascus VA and hiked to Maine then caught a ride to Springer Mtn GA and was going to finish in Damascus. He only had 30 more miles to complete 2170 miles. Wow!
We got to Vendeventer Shelter at 5:30 PM. 10 hours on the trail today. We have done 5900 ft elevation gain and 18 miles in our first 1 1/2 days on the AT. Pretty good.

I forgot to mention yesterday that it started raining at 5:30 PM when we got to the shelter. It rained for several hours. We were thankful we were in a shelter so we wouldn't have wet tents in the morning. 
Since we were so tired last night, we slept well. We didn't get up today until 7:15 AM. We left the shelter at 8:50 thinking we would do a light day and hike only to Iron Mtn Shelter of 6.8 miles. 
We arrived at Iron Mtn Shelter at 1:30 PM. We made good time so we decided to go an additional 4.6 miles to Tenn Hwy 91. We would call the campground for a pickup. This way we could wash our clothes and take a shower. We left the Iron Mtn Shelter at 2:00. 
Along the trail we met thru hikers (hikers doing the whole AT) who were doing a flip-flop. They started in Harpers Ferry WV and hiked to Maine, came back to hike from Harpers Ferry to Spring Mtn GA. They have only 440 miles to complete the 2170 miles.Their names were Princess (from San Diego) and Low Gear (from St Paul). The third person we met was a guy from Chicago/ Switzerland in his 30's. He was hiking from Harpers Ferry to Springer Mtn too.
There are not many people on the trail. We have been the only people in our campsite each night.
Also someone asked if I have seen any bears. We have not. I have seen bear scat 7 or 8 times along the trail. Today I saw some that was very fresh - this bear had been eating blueberries and acorns, or Cliff Bar Crunch with blueberries like I had for lunch. 
We got to TN91 at 4:15. We covered 11.4 miles today and were on the trail 7 hours and 25 minutes. 
We got to the campground at 4:45, took showers and washed our clothes. Then we walked down to pay the owner (he was also our driver). He took us on a tour of his shop and the house he is building. 
 We cooked dinner (heated water for our MRE's). I had chiken and rice. We are heading to bed early.

About 2
miles into the hike we met Whip, a 30 some year old from New Brunswick, Canada,
a thru hiker who was hiking to Springer Mtn. He only had about 450 miles to go.
At
Double Springs Gap, 3 miles into the hike, we ran into 2 guys from Danville VA
and Reidsville NC who were lying in at the shelter. They looked exhausted and
one of them was smoking a cigarette. They left their car at TN91 (where we
started this morning) and were planning to hike to Damascus VA and back, about
40 miles. They were planning on a 5 or 6 day hike. They gone 13 miles and spent
2 nights out and were heading back to their car. They only had 3 more miles to
get back. They said they had done a lot of hiking prior to this but did not
realize it would be so hard. On top of that their packs weighed 55 and 60 lbs.
My pack with water weighs 34 lbs..
We
arrived at our shelter, Abingdon Gap Shelter at 3:15 PM. We were on the trail

We were up at 7:15 AM (sunrise is at 7:00) to get packed. We left for our trek to Damascus at 8:15 AM. 
The trek today was mostly in the trees so no great views of the mountain but some great views of nature. We met 3 SoBo (South Bounders) today. They only have 450 miles to complete the AT. This always amazes me. We met a couple, Machine and Squeaky, who have been together 5 years and they are in their 20's. They are from Boston and they started on June 3 (same day as Hustle, who they know). Shortly after that we met Dr Who, a SoBo from Memphis TN. He was in his early 30's, a big guy at 6'3"" or 6'4"". He was a physical therapist. We arrived at Damascus at 12:45 PM, so we covered our 10.3 miles in 4 hours and 30 minutes (a really good time) but it was mostly downhill.
We went to Wood Chuck Hostel in town to check in. It is $25 for a bed, shower and a hot breakfast. Nice house. Wood Chuck owns the place. He is 60 some years old from Montana and moved here 4 years ago. Staying at the place tonight is:

They all have a story and its great to listen to them. 
Mike and I got showers and went to get lunch at Damascus Diner at 2:00 PM. I had a hamburger steak, french fries, side salad, and coconut cream pie. Plus about 64 oz of Diet Coke on ice. The bill was $15. 
We came back to the hostel and washed our clothes. At 5:00 PM Wood Chuck took all 6 of us to the local grocery store to restock. Mike and I went back to the Damascus Diner at 6:00. It was packed.

We were up at 6:45 AM as breakfast was being cooked. Wood Chuck had blueberry waffles, fresh melon, bananas, fried potatoes, and a selection of cereal, orange juice, and coffee for us. It was great. 
The rest of the gang in the hostel got up around 7:30 for breakfast. (see the picture) We had a great stay at the Wood Chuck Hostel. We left at 8:15 AM.
The walk to get out of town was enjoyable. Damascus is a town of about 900 people. The town is all about biking and the AT. There are 6 bicycle shops that each run 6 to 8 vans that can pull 12-14 bikes on a trailer. They would take riders 15-20 miles up the mountain and people ride back to town. The trail runs along all of this. Plus a creek that ran through town. 
The first 8 miles of today's hike we walked along Whitetop Laurel Creek which was 15 to 70 feet wide and had 2, 3 and 4 grade rapids. At times the rushing water sounded like a train. It was a gorgeous hike this morning. Very peaceful. As we hiked along the creek, we crossed over 21 trestle bridges that the trains used in the past. Some of them were long, all 20-100 ft long and 100 to 150 ft over the creek. (See pictures)
We did have a steep climb to get to our shelter and we also walk through rain for about 2-3 hours. It didn't rain hard enough to put on rain gear but we did cover our packs. 
We arrived at Lost Mtn Shelter at 2:15 PM, 6 hours on the trail and we covered 14.3 miles. We made great time. We didn't have cell service all day. Just as we got to the shelter it started to pour down rain. We were glad to be at the shelter. I had lunch. As we were setting up in the shelter a hiker arrived who was soaked. He was Jeff from WV, out for a 9 day hike. He was with his brother-in-law but he had to drop out a few days back because of sore feet. Jeff is in his late 20's and owns a landscaping business. He is married with an 18 month old girl. He is ending his hike in Damascus, starting in Bland VA.
About 6:00 PM Greg, a 54 year old from St Petersburg FL showed up. He had dinner and then shared my bear bag. We all talked briefly and went to bed at 8:00 PM.
It was a very pleasant day since I got to reflect a lot in the quiet time. Mike has been a great partner. 
I am a very lucky guy.

Shelter (483.4 AT) to Hwy 600 (492.8 AT) for 9.2 miles today and a total of
73.9 miles so far.
What a day!
It rained hard all night and it continued
to rain when it was time for us to get going this morning.
Our 2 shelter partners took off at 8:00 heading for Damascus VA.
We left at 8:15 AM hoping to go to Massie Gap so we would get throught the 17 mile section that has no camping. Camping has been suspended in that area due to heavy bear activity. We also would go through Grayson
Highland State Park where a herd of wild miniature horses roam.
The rain did slow down as the morning progressed. The rocks, boulders, and roots were very
slippery and the rest of the trail was mud. It was hard to move at a fast pace.
We were sliding with several near falls. We also had a 2500 ft
elevation gain in the first 5 miles. We met 3 people, a mom, dad and boy from
Chicago were doing a 3 day hike and we met a SoBo from RI. His name was Otis, he had started on June 5 and only had 500 miles to finish.
We arrived at Hwy 600 after 9.4 miles at 1:30 PM, a little behind our projected time. We have not had phone service for the last 28 hours (since we left Damascus). 
We were concerned since our hiking speed in this weather wouldn't get us to Massie Gap until around 7:00 PM and it would be dark. We were trying to figure out what to do. Go for it? And if we had a problem stay in one of the ""no camping"" shelters or see if we could get phone service. After several attempts with ATT (Mike's phone) and Sprint (my phone), I got a call to go through to the Grayson Highland State Park. We asked for help and they gave us the number for Dennis, the owner of Grayson Highland General Store. Mike called and got Dennis and explained our situation. Dennis came and picked us up (took about 40 minutes). We were wet and cold waiting but glad he could come. He gave us a place in the wash room with cots. (pictures) Plus we could wash our clothes and shower. The General Store also has a food bar. We got to the store around 3:00 PM. They also had WiFi so we got to update everyone on what was happening. We had dinner - hamburger, pulled pork sandwich, french fries, beer, and ice cream.
Things worked out great. We are still supposed to get rain tonight and tomorrow so tomorrow could be another wet day but we both have smiles on our faces tonight.","Lost Mtn Shelter

It rained a lot during the night. We were up at 6:55 AM. We prepeared for the day as we waited for the General Store to open at 8:00 AM. It looks like the rain may be over for a few days. That would be great.
At 8 AM we got coffee and ordered a breakfast sandwich with eggs, cheese and bacon. We are going to slack pack the 17.1 miles today. Slack packing means we do not take our back packs. We will only need water and lunch so our packs are only about 5 pounds. The plan is to hike today's route and catch a ride back to the General Store since we can't camp in the park.
Dennis was ready to take us at 8:30 AM. We were on the trail at 9:10 at Hwy 600. We hiked up to Grayson Highland State Park. We had about 1000 ft climb to the park. It was 58 degrees when we hit the trail. About 3 miles in we met Cheddar from Appleton WI. He is 28 and is thru hiking with 50 miles left. 
Throughout the day we met several day hikers enjoying the park. We did meet 4 men from NC, 3 of them NC State graduates, ranging in age from 35 to 45. They were out for a 3 day hike of 25 miles. They got a kick out of the fact they were all born after I graduated from NC State in '71. I wear a white baseball hat with an NC State logo while on the AT. 
We also met The Last Boy Scout around 1:00 PM today. He was about 30, started in Maine and was planning on hiking to Key West FL and back to Maine. This would be 6000 miles and he would not complete it until fall 2019.
We stopped for lunch at Massie Point. There were great views (pictures) and we did get to see the wild ponies. They pretty much ignore humans.
This weekend in Grayson Highland State Park they will auction off 20 ponies. They do this to keep the herd to about 120 so they do not over populate. It is a big festival, over 5000 will attend. 
We had a great day.
We finished at 5:40 PM and went 17.8 miles. Mike's fitbit recorded 41,000 steps today. We were on the trail 9 hours and 30 minutes  and covered a lot of distance. Dennis picked us up and we are back at the Grayson Highland General Store tonight. We had burgers, took showers, and washed our clothes. We are still in the laundry room for tonight.
It is 9:00 PM and lights are out in our room. I'm looking forward to tomorrow.
It looks like we might not have cell service for several days so we may go dark for a bit.

CONT'D FROM YESTERDAY: FRI, SEPT 28
I forgot to mention that we went over Mr Rogers Mountain. It is the highest mountain in VA at 5729 ft. Also last night we sat on the porch at the General Store and 3 ladies gave us the story on the wild ponies at Grayson Highland State Park. The ponies were actually put there in the 1940's to keep the brush in check. They are a managed herd but they are wild from the standpont that they do not go to a barn anytime over the winter months. The state checks them to make sure they are healthy. There are some ponies outside Grayson Highland State Park since some got through a broken fence. We saw some outside of the state park. The ponies range in size from as small as a big dog to a small quarter horse that you could ride. The prices for the ponies will range from $200 - $1000. 
The other interesting thing from yesterday, phone service was out to the General Store when we were finishing up our hike and we were concerned since we didn't have our full packs and it was getting late. But Dennis was waiting for us at Hwy 603 when we finished at 5:40. He explained that the phones or the electricity goes out when the heli-chopper (a small helicopter pulling a 40 foot buzz saw below it) comes out to clear the limbs from around the power lines. I had never seen one of these before. Apparently it is easier to fix the wires when they get snipped than to trim the trees from the ground. They clear 3 - 6 miles of power lines from both sides in a day. (I found a picture of one online and have included it in the pictures.)  
TODAY
We were up at 6:45 AM just before sunrise. I went to the front of the General Store so I would have wifi connection to send Marilee my journal entries and photos. I am trying to write better. I went back to the room and Mike was up and packed. He went to get coffee and order breakfast for us while I packed. We had breakfast and I bought a few food items. We will need 4 days worth to the next restocking opportunity.
Dennis, the store owner (and our driver and landlord), was ready to take us up to VA Hwy 603 at 9:10. We hit the trail at 9:40 AM and at 11:15, we got to Hurricane Mtn Shelter. Mike wanted to make a pit stop. Most of our walk today was through the woods with very few mountain views. We crossed over several roaring, I mean ROARING streams. A couple were hard to cross without being part of the stream. Rocks were slick and the water was moving at a fast pace. 
We met a couple of day hikers and 3 SoBoers. They were:
Dingo - a late 20 year old young man from Australia
Roadkill - a late 20 or early 30 year old young lady from Albuquerque NM. She had blue hair and a great looking tatoo on her knee that looked like a spider with the spider going over her leg
Calgary - a guy from... Calgary CAN
At 3:10 we reached the peak of the mountain we were climbing and decided to stop and check for cell service. I had some so I sent the photos for today and called Marilee. Gordon Jr was there since he had stopped by after playing in a charity golf tournament this morning. He gave me the update that NC State beat VA today. It was great to talk with them. While I did, Mike went on to our shelter for the night. He arrived at 4:10 and I got there around 4:30. We are staying at the Trimpi Shelter for the night. 
We got water, fixed our bear bags, and had dinner. We are getting ready for bed at 7:45 PM.
No one else is at the shelter currently but some could arrive later. 
After we passed 75 miles, I have now done 3 backpacking trips exceeding 75 miles. 
Only 68.5 miles left and we have 7 days left.

We were the only people in our shelter last night. It was a nice, cool evening. We got up at 6:45 AM, had breakfast - peanut butter on toasted shell, and packed our gear.
We left the shelter at 8:15. Most of the hike today will be in the woods. We had a 1000 ft climb to start the morning. The trail had dried out some so it was not as muddy. 
We met a couple of people on a day hike but we also saw a few thru hikers. The SoBo'ers we met were:
Humas and Bolt: a couple in their 20's from Omaha, NE. They started in Maine and only had 520 miles to go.
Mondamon: a guy in his late 20's from Danville VA.
We also had Griz pass us today. He is only the second person who has passed us. Griz started in Waynesboro, VA, went to Maine, then flip flopped to Springer Mtn GA and will complete his trek in Waynesboro VA. Griz is 36 and lives in Maine.
It was a lot of up and down today. We walk through a canopy of trees for miles. (picture) We got to Partnership Shelter at 2:00 PM. We are gaining speed. Partnership Shelter has a shower and is a double deck shelter. It can hold 16 people. We walked over to the Mt Rogers National Park Visitors Center (about .2 miles from our shelter) after we unloaded our packs.
When we got back I took a quick shower; the water was really, really cold. It was quick, and refreshing. 
We are having dinner. It will be an early night.

Shelter (533.3 AT) to Atkins, VA (545.3) for 12 miles today and 125.6 miles
total.
What
a great shelter. It is the nicest one I have ever stayed at. 
We were up at 6:45 AM. After breakfast we packed to walk to the
Mt Rogers Visitors Center to get water and check for phone numbers for possible
lodging in Atkins VA tonight. They had a land line we could use since we had no
cell service. We decided on the Comfort Inn so we could watch the Chiefs game.
Some pretty good climbs today
for the first 5.5 miles and then it was downhill heading to Atkins. The walk
today was mostly in the woods and through meadows. We met a few thru hikers
headed to Springer Mtn GA. They were Sonic and Puddles, a couple in their late
20’s. Sonic started on June 9 and Puddles started later in June. Both are females,
Sonic is from ARK and Puddles was from GA. Also we met Blood Homey, a guy from
Chicago. He was in his 20's, thin, 6'2"" and had a man bun. He was
wearing a tee shirt and his underwear (they left nothing to the imagination).
We also met a couple of section hikers, Granddaddy Long Legs and
Greg from Kentucky. They did a thru hike in 2014 and have been doing long
section hikes every year since. They were 59 and 60 years old. We have only met
1 person who was older than Mike and no one my age.
We got to Atkins VA at 2:45 PM. The AT comes out at a truck stop
on US11 and I81. We stopped at the truck stop and called a taxi for a ride to
the Comfort Inn, 3 miles off the trail. Wayne, the owner of Bird Taxi picked us
up at 3:30 PM. Wayne had some great stories.
After we arrived at the motel, we showered and I wanted to
wash clothes (3/4 mile walk) and hit the Dollar General to restock our food for
the last few days. Mike arranged for dinner for us and went to get beer for Monday Night Football. We ordered pizza, a salad and bread sticks
for takeout. It was great. 
We only have 46.1 miles left on my leg of the trip to Bland VA.
Now we are getting ready to watch the Chiefs.
3 hours later: Wow! What a game! Go Chiefs!
We turned off the lights at 11:45 PM. We have been in our sleeping
bags between 7:30 and 8:30 PM every night on the trail.

Before I start off with the activities for today, I wanted to mention a few things that I have been thinking the last few days.
Mike P, Yakker (his trail name), has been a great trail partner. He has lead us almost the entire hike since he is slightly faster than me and that allows us both to hike our own hike. I am amazed that he can continue up the steepest inclines without stopping. He calls it plodding along. He can do this because of all the training he did the last several months. In May- August he recorded the following # of steps: May: 651,301, June: 712,129, July: 804,023, and August: 800,687. (That is almost 1500 miles.) We have been great support for each other.
Also being the 12th day on the trail (counting our Day 0), I am really missing the family, especially Marilee. She has been a great support. I am a really lucky guy to have the support and love from all my family.
Now to today's activities. It was hard to get to sleep last night after the Chiefs game but we were excited to get started today. We were up at 6:30 AM. We went to get coffee and have breakfast at the Comfort Inn and watch the highlights of the Chiefs game.
Wayne, the taxi company owner, picked us up at 8:50 AM and we were on the trail at 9:05 AM.
We passed under I81 heading back out the the trail. It rained a litlle on and off but it was a very pleasant day to walk.
We met 7 SoBo'ers. A couple named Squeaky and Blackbeard. They were in their 20's and were from a small town outside of Reading PA. We then met a group of 5 SoBo'ers who were spread out about 1/2 mile. All guys in their 20's, Little Foot, Moose from Johnson City TN, Pony Express from Bristol, England, Animal from Indiana, and Toons from Boseman MT.
Most of our hike was through the woods but we also hiked through several large meadows. It was a good day. We arrived at Bear Garden Hostel at the intersection of the AT and VA Hwy42 at 3:00 PM. We were on the trail for 6 hours and 55 minutes and covered 12.5 miles. We are getting stronger.
Staying the night at Bear Garden Hostel that is owned by Bob and Bert Langham. They opened this place in March. 
We will hit the sack at 8:30 PM.

What a day! Today was one of those days that you do not have time to reflect on your life since you have to focus so intently on the next step. We did 11.2 miles with 4200 ft elevation gain. I think this is the most I have ever done in one day.
Also I forgot to mention that on Tuesday I clocked over 400 miles on the AT (for 2017 and 2018). When we finish on Friday I will have 445 miles on the AT completed. 
We were up this morning at 7:15 (we slept in today). We did our morning chores and had a ham, egg and cheese croisant heated in the microwave. We also made coffee. Bert, one of the owners, came down around 8 AM. She had some great stories. It was $20 for the room and a few dollars for the breakfast sandwich, a coke and an ice cream sandwich.
We hit the trail at 9:10 AM. We had a big climb today - 4200 ft elevation gain. We met a few SoBo'ers today. They were all in their 20's. 3 were hiking together: Mr T from Nashville, Dozer from Lexington KY, and Rico Sauve from New Hampshire. We also met Big Al from Mississippi.
We arrived at Chestnut Knob Shelter at 4:20 PM. This shelter was once the Forest Warden's cabin. Plus the view is great. (picture)
After we had dinner a thru hiker heading to GA showed up at 6:30 PM. His trail name is Happy. He is in his early 30's, from NY. This is his 3rd attempt at completing the hike.
Then shortly after that a group of 5 from DC came into camp. They pitched tents.

Back to yesterday's story, there were 5 people who came into camp at 6:45 PM last night. Only 4 of them tented near our shelter and had dinner and breakfast inside the cabin. It was dark when they had dinner but Mike had a light so they could see. More about them later.
That group had breakfast and was gone by 7:45.
Happy woke us up at 3:00 AM jumping around saying a mouse ran over his head. Happy might be a little wacky. 
We got packed and waited until 8:30 AM to leave to give the group in front of us a head start. 
The hike today involved a few climbs but along the ridge. We would go up 300 ft and down 200 ft and back up. The tough part about the hike today was that for about 7 miles we hiked over rocks and boulders. You had to climb over the boulder and we did that numerous times today. Our time was not as fast as in previous days. 
The SoBo'ers we met today were: 
Chili - in his 20's from Pensicola FL
Lucy - a female in her 20's 
Mocca - in his 20's from Mass
Grizzly & Turtle Mom - a couple in their 40's to 50's from Maine
We also met Bumshey, a gentleman in his 50's who will complete the trail this year in Atkins VA. It took him 4 years.
We also met 2 section hikers.
Now back to the story of the group that stayed at the campsite last night. After we hiked 6 miles we came to a county road and sitting next to the road there were 3 black SUV Suburbans. The group was there and one new guy we had not met offered us a Gatorade. I thanked him and he told me to thank the woman in the group. When they left 4 guys stayed and 3 new guys went with the husband and wife. (They were in their late 40's to 50's.) The SUV's had VA and DC tags. We think the husband and wife had a security team hiking with them. We think the wife was the person they were providing protection for. There are more details to the story, too much to write, but it is very interesting.
We arrived at Jenkins Shelter at 3:30. 7 hours on the trail today.
We had dinner. A flip flop SoBo'er by the name of Falling Tree showed up at 6:00 PM. Falling Tree graduated in 2014 from James Madison U. He lost his job and decided to hike the AT. 
There is no phone service at Jenkins Shelter so we will hit the sack at dark, 7:30 or 8:00.

We got an early start this morning since it would be my last day on the AT in 2018.
We left the shelter at 8:15 AM. We had a couple of good climbs early this morning and then walked several up and downs across the ridge. The trail was in good shape.
We have not had wifi or phone service for the last 2 days so at lunch at the top of the ridge I called Marilee. At that point we had 4.2 miles to complete my trek.
We ended at 2:15 PM for 6 hours on the trail. That is great time for 11.5 miles.
We only met 2 SoBo'ers today. Grub from New Hampshire and Slim from Michigan.
Stripper (Her trail name because she can strip the bark off a tree faster than anyone.) picked us up at 2:30 PM to take us to Lick Skillet Hostel. It is an old church built in 1911. (pictures) No indoor bathroom, an outdoor shower, dinner tonight, and the cost is a donation. They have 8 beds.
Stripper is a thru hiker in her 40's who is looking after the hostel while the owner, Mongo goes on a 4-5 day hike.
There are 2 other people at the hostel tonight. Chili, we met him slack packing a couple of days ago, and Trail Monkey from FL who is also slack packing.

Only 4 were doing hikes longer than 172 miles.We did not meet any hikers as old as me and only one, No Doubt, was older than Mike.80% of the hikers were in their 20's.
THE THING ABOUT THE HIKE I WILL NEVER FORGET:
Camping at Chestnut Knob Shelter with General Selva, his wife, and their security detail. General Selva is the 2nd highest ranking military officer (4 star) in the armed forces and the highest ranking officer in the Air Force. A graduate of the Air Force Academy and an Eagle Scout. He is a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. His trail name is ""Flat Top"".
FAVORITE THING THAT TOOK PLACE ON THE TRAIL:
The 17 mile hike through Grayson Highland State Park - Great views, ponies, long horn cows, and the opportunity to meet some great people.The stay at Woodchuck Hostel in Damascus VA. We needed a break. We had a great host (Woody or Woodchuck), interesting bunk mates, a delicious breakfast, and great meals at the Damascus Diner.The night we spent in Atkins VA at the Comfort Inn where we ordered pizza takeout and watched the Chiefs beat the Broncos.The hike along the roaring stream/ creek for 12.5 miles as we were leaving Damascus VA. It was the best day I had on the trail to think about all the good things I have in my life, my family and friends, and how lucky I am.
HARDEST PART OF THE TREK:
The first 2 days before we had our hiking/ trail legs we did 19 miles in 1 1/2 days with steep (very steep) climbs. I was exhausted at the end of both of these days.The 4200 elevation gain and 12.5 miles headed to Chestnut Knob Shelter.
THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE IN THE 2 TREKS:
Springer to Hot Springs was 274 miles (26 days) vs 172 miles (15 days).The first trek I was alone and had more time to reflect and think. The second trek I was able to share the experience with Mike Pearce.Both treks involved great views, great times, some challenges, meeting lots of interesting people and creating memories for a lifetime.Last year since most of the hikers I met were just starting their trek (NoBoers from GA), a lot of them (over 50%) did not meet their objective in hiking distance. This year almost all of the hikers we met had already hiked all summer and had already completed 1600 to 1700 miles of their trek (mostly SoBoers). A large percentage of this group were going to finish their goal of reaching Springer Mtn (2170 miles).
BIGGEST FEELING OF ACCOMPLISHMENT: 
Completing 172 miles on the AT in 14 1/2 days.Setting a goal and achieving it.
HIKING PARTNER:
Mike Pearce, Yakker, was a great hiking partner. I enjoyed the numerous conversations we had and getting to know Mike better. The support he provided made the hike easier and very enjoyable. After I left the trail Mike continued his hike for 6 more days (Oct 7- Oct 12) and his sister and her friend joined him for this final week. They did an additional 64.9 miles therefore Mike did a total 236.5 miles. That is great!!!
THANKS FOR FOLLOWING:
We had over 5000 people visit this Journal. Most days we had over 400 people look at the Journal.
FINAL THOUGHTS:
Still the 3 words that come to me when I think about hiking the AT:
PEACEFUL - the opportunity to enjoy the views, the sounds of the forest, the surrounding wildlife and the solitude of the walk.PEOPLE - it is great to meet so many people and hear their unique stories.ACCOMPLISHMENTS - setting goals and achieving them or doing the best you can to achieve them is very rewarding.
As happened with my 2017 trek, I am hopeful this journey will have a positive impact on how I view people and my surroundings. I know it has increased my awareness of how important it is to appreciate and cherish the people you love. The time on the trail has helped me reconfirm what is important in life and how I measure success.
As I write my Final Thoughts about my 2018 trek, I do realize I am the ""luckiest guy in the world"".

Gordon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621481,"Overview of Gordon's 3rd Appalachian Trail section hike:
August 29 - Sept 19, 2019  

The Appalachian Trail journey will continue on Thursday, August 29, when I will fly to Roanoke, Va. and catch a shuttle to Lickskillet Hostel which is close to Bland, Va.. This is the location my 2018 hike ended. My feet will hit the Trail on August 30.

 
One of the things I really enjoy about hiking the AT is that every day you experience something different. These experiences could be birds singing in the early morning, the wind whistling through the trees, a sunset over a ridge, hiking in the rain, a great view of the sun shining into the valley below, a rugged & rocky trail up a step pitch for several miles, or meeting new people and hearing their story of why they are hiking the trail.

 
Some of the experiences this AT Trek will include:

  
- Starting in Southwest Virginia close to Bland, Va. in the Jefferson National Forest at the AT mile marker 591.7

-Covering 242.2 miles on the AT (walking about 265 miles with side trips). 

-59,000 feet of elevation gain

-Traveling along the Brushy and Pearis Mountain Ranges to Pearisburg, Va.. 

-Mike Pearce, my 2018 hiking partner, joining me on September 4 13 miles past Pearisburg at the AT mile marker 656.3

-Following the Virginia/West Virginia  border for several miles (West Virginia will be the 5th State I have hiked in on the AT).

-Hiking in the George Washington National Forest.

-The 2nd oldest/largest oak tree (over 300 yrs. old) on the AT.

-The Triple Crown (Dragon Tooth, McAfee Knob and Tinker Cliff). McAfee Knob has to be the most photographed lookout on the AT.

-Traveling through the Trail Town of Daleville, Va. 

-Ending this year at the Ty River Suspension Bridge on Sept. 19 at mile marker 833.9. This is close to Montebello, Va which is just north of Buena Vista, Va. 



 
And everyday on the trail there will be many more experiences, some good and some bad, and I can hardly wait to see what they will be.

 
As in the past years you can view my/our progress and see the experiences we had each day by clicking on the “Entries” and “by date” on my Gordon’s Appalachian Trail Journal page. I will try to update the Journal and post pictures each day but as in the past I could be limited at times due to my phone/wifi service.

Gordon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621990,"Thursday, Aug 29: Overland Park KS to Lickskiilet Hostel, Bland VA (0 miles) 
What a great day to start my journey this year.
Marilee took me to the airport to catch my 8:15 AM flight to Washington DC (Dulles) connecting to Roanoke VA. I am excited to get started on my trek this year plus I am very thankful for all of the support I get from everyone that allows me to do this, especially Marilee.

 During the flight I had time to reflect on what I had to do to get ready for the hike. I did not start preparing as early this year since it has been a very busy 1st half of 2019 for our family with Tyson and Melissa’s February wedding, Graham’s graduation in May and starting a new job in June, and Gordon J and Paige’s June wedding and move to Atlanta.
 We (Mike Pierce and I) set the dates and the preliminary hike plan in mid-July. The training for the hike started the third week in July. It was not as intense as previous years, but I did walk/ hike about 120 miles with my backpack (weighing 46 lbs) the last 4 weeks plus I continue to do my 3 day a week workout that I have been doing for over 3 years. I do a 3 mile run and a core body work out on the machines.
The only new item I added to my backpack this year is a lightweight (2.5 oz) inflatable pillow. I think the comfort it will add will be worth the weight. My starting pack weighs 34.6 lbs. This includes 13 lbs of food and water. I will have 5 days of food (10 lbs),  1 ½ liters of water (3 lbs). Of course the food is 1 lb of peanut butter and 1 lb of chocolate. : )

 The other 22.6 lbs include my backpack, tent, sleeping bag and gear, sleeping pad, stove, pot, clothes, battery pack and charging cords, rain gear, first aid kit, toiletries, knife and my journal. 
I feel like I am ready.
The trip to Lickskillet Hostel went great. It was planes, buses, and automobiles. All my flights were on time. I left KC at 8:15, thru DC and into Roanoke at 2:00 PM. At the airport I caught a bus to the Virginia Tech Student Union in Blacksburg (about 1 ½ hour trip) and this is where Don Raines, my shuttle driver picked me up for the drive to the hostel. We stopped in Pearisburg VA at the Walmart so I could get some stove fuel and a chicken sandwich from the deli for my dinner. Don was a talker and I enjoyed listening to his story. (It’s too long to cover in this journal but it was interesting.) 
I got to the hostel at 5:00 PM. Magic (his picture is in my photo gallery) is the person looking after the hostel tonight and he gave me the lowdown how things work. Magic is staying here doing work around the hostel for room and board. 
At 6:30PM we had dinner. Magic cooked some burgers and I had my chicken sandwich. I spent the evening talking to Magic, catching up on today’s news on my phone (this place has wifi) and reading some of the reading material at the hostel.
I hit the sack about 9 PM and plan to get an early start tomorrow. I am excited to hit the trail in the morning.

August 30: US 52 @ Bland VA (591.7 mile marker) to Lickskillet Hollow, VA 608
(604.8 mile marker) for 13.1 miles
It got
cold last night. I was going to sleep with only a sheet on the bunk but during
the night I put my sleeping bag over me and put on my lightweight long
underwear. It got down to 49 last night. Plus I drank so much water yesterday I
had to have a couple of bathroom breaks during the night.
Only
Magic and I were at the hostel last night and we both were up at 6:00 AM. 
It's going
to be a great day to for a hike. The highs will only be in the high 70's.
I am
going to slack pack today (when you only take a day pack) since I will hike
back to the Lickskillet Hostel today.
I got
my stuff together for the hike (2 liters of water, battery pack, lunch and my
knife) while Magic cooked us breakfast of eggs and sausage mixed together and
coffee.
Mongo,
the owner, came over about 7:30 AM and we left for the trailhead at 7:50 AM to
mile marker 591.7. 
I got to
the trail at 8:15 and it was 52 degrees. As I started out, I remembered some of
the things I truly enjoy about hiking early in the morning. The birds are very active,
so they are singing but it is quiet too. You can hear the breeze blow through
the trees. The thing I don't like is being the first person on the trail, I
always run into spider webs and there are a lot of them.
The hike
started out with a steep climb for about 3 miles and then I hiked along the
ridge which had lots of ups and downs. I finished with almost a 3 mile descent
back into the valley where Lickskillet Hostel is located. The hostel is .6
miles off the trail and when I got off the trail, I walked back adding the
.6 miles to my 13.1 miles on the AT. A lady stopped and gave me a ride the last
.3 miles. 
The
trail was not busy. I met 2 flip floppers. They hiked from Harpers Ferry WV
(1/2 point on the AT) to Katahdin, Maine (the north point on the AT) and flip
flopped back to Harpers Ferry to Springer Mtn GA. They have 600 miles to
complete their thru hike of 2192 miles. The first person I met was
Fireball from Indiana and he was in his early 30's. The second person was
Sleeze and she was in her late 20's or early 30's. They both started in late
April and if they complete the hike they would arrive at Springer Mtn around
mid-October.
I
finished my hike at 2:15 PM so I was on the trail for 6 hours and covered 13.1
miles. I had a few water breaks and lunch during the hike. I felt good about my
pace and only a few aches after I finished. 
More to
come for Aug 30 later tonight. 
Since I
finished my hike early today I had a chance to catch up on the internet plus
take a quick shower. 
Magic
and I had dinner at 6:30 PM. We cooked hamburgers. After dinner I looked over
my itinerary for the next few days to make sure my original plan still looked
ok and I repacked my back pack.
I plan
to hit the sack around 9:00 PM tonight. Tomorrow will be a big day for me.

Gordon,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622117,"Saturday, Aug 31: Lickskillet Hollow VA Hwy 608 (604.8 mile marker) to Wapiti Shelter (618.8) for 13.3 miles

Had a great night’s sleep. Magic and I were up at 6 AM again. We fixed and ate breakfast and I packed for my hike. We had frozen sausage biscuits straight out of the microwave. They were not very good. Plus I had a bowl of cereal with fake marshmallows. So much for breakfast. At least it filled me up.

I got my pack ready so Mongo could take me to the trail at 8:00 AM. Mongo dropped me off and at 8:11 I started my first day with a fully loaded back pack. I am guessing the weight around 34 lbs.

The hike started out with an 800 foot vertical climb out of the valley. That was about 3 miles. The rest of the day I hiked along the ridge with ascents of 200 to 400 feet and descents of 200 to 400 feet. The trail was very rocky for the first 7 to 8 miles but it was great the last 6 to 7 miles with just a bunch of roots. At about the halfway point there was a side trail of .3 miles to Dismal Creek Falls. I decided to go take a look since I was making good time. It is located close to a road so it is a hot spot for the locals. 
Also at the falls I met a couple from VA Beach. Lost & Found (the male) and his girlfriend, Malan were visiting the falls. Lost & Found was planning on doing a 200 mile section hike but after 100 miles called Malan to come get him. He said being a construction worker in his 30’s, he thought he was fit. He said the AT kicked his butt. They took a picture of me at the falls.

I also met Logger (male 40’s to 50) heading south. He started in Central PA and was heading to Springer Mtn GA, about 1300 miles. 
The rest of the day went ok except I did take the wrong trail for .2 miles before I realized it. I got to the shelter at 3:30 PM. 7 hours, 20 minutes on the trail. My phone app said I did 15.6 miles with the side trip and taking the wrong trail. Still a great day and the weather was perfect with 56 degrees to start and 82 degrees to finish.

Beng on the trail for 7+ hours gives you a lot of time to think and that is great for me. When I am going down hill I think about how I can be a better person, how to help and support my family, and how I can do things to help the people around us. I think about life. 
When I am going up hill I think about how far it is to the top. :  )
I did pitch my tent tonight and I will hang my food bag.

Tonight I was too tired to cook so I had 2 peanut butter wraps in tortilla shells with extra peanut butter. (I was missing my peanut butter.) I also had 3 or 4 miniature Hershey bars plus lots of water.

After dinner I went to get water and setup my tent. Tonight will be an early night. I will be going to bed at Hiker’s Midnight (sunset) which is around 8:30.

I have covered 26.4 miles in 2 days. I feel great.

Before I went to bed last night a couple, Jessica and Tate from Columbus, Ohio showed up just as I was getting ready to head to my tent. They were going to tent but Tate realized he lost his tent poles, so he slept in the shelter. This is a reminder that crazy things can happen if you are not paying attention. 
I had a hard time falling asleep since the cicadas were so loud. It was after 11:00PM when I went to sleep. The night was cool enough to feel great. I was up at 6:15 AM. (It does not get light until 6:30) and packed the stuff in my tent. 
I packed my things, ate breakfast (a Clif Bar) and hit the trail at 7:35 AM. The first 2 miles were very steep with 1800 feet elevation gain. The trail was very rocky today. It was hard to find a place to put your foot without stepping on rocks or boulders. I did not meet anyone during my hike on the trail today.

I arrived at Woods Hole Hostel at 12:05. It is .5 mile off the trail. It was voted as 1 of the top 10 hostels on the trail by the AT Thru Hikers. The main structure is an 1822 chestnut log cabin. It was opened in 1986 by Tillie and Roy Woods. Neville, their granddaughter runs it today. The heated bunk house is an 1840 log cabin. 
I sat on the front porch, wrote in my journal and caught up on the news. It is a great day. About 75 degrees. Very relaxing.

I spent the rest of the afternoon walking around the farm. They raise all their vegetables and meat (cows and pigs). 
Dinner is at 7 PM but everyone meets at 6:00 to help prepare the meal. We had homemade pizza. After we cleaned up the dishes, we had homemade ice cream. I was stuffed.

The group gathered around and talked in the living room and kitchen. At 9:00 PM everyone started going to bed. I got my laundry from the dryer and came to my room to get ready for bed. 
A good day –

I slept great last night. I had a bed in the main cabin. It was 3 beds in a room but it was only me last night. Plus I could use the bathroom and shower in the main cabin. The cost was $33 (hiker rate). I had a great view of the sunrise from my room. I got up at 6:15 AM and packed my back pack. 
At 7:00 AM I went down to sit on the porch until Neville, the owner needed help with breakfast. I had to break 20 eggs and slice watermelon for breakfast. After, I sat and drank coffee on the porch watching the sun coming up over the mountain range. We had breakfast at 7:40. French toast casserole, scrambled eggs, watermelon, orange juice and coffee.

At breakfast this morning were Achilles (he just earned a PhD in Anthropology from Yale), Low Key (who as a baby was left at a bus station and recently worked with a carnival that traveled city to city), Ed (in his mid 50s, hiked from Florida), Golden (a male in his 30’s was thru hiking and got tired and stopped), John (in his late 20’s and needed a break from life).  All of this group have been working at the hostel for the last 1-4 weeks. 
Visiting were Morning Star (not a trail name) and Luke, a married couple who met on the AT during their 2014 thru hike. They now live in Ashville NC and were visiting for the weekend. Plus Coach (a section hiker from Cincinnati OH who is doing a 220 mile section hike) and me. Plus Neville, the owner. What a group! They were interesting and of course they all had a story. I left the hostel at 9:00 AM. I walked about .2 miles and realized I forgot my poles. It is a .6 mile walk to the AT from the hostel on a road. Golden was going to check the spring water source and saw me walking back. Since he had the 4 wheeler, he picked me up. I got my poles and he took me to the trail. I started hiking at 9:15 AM.

I only had a hike of 10.6 miles to Pearisburg. I did say “only”. After I climbed out of the valley this morning, the afternoon walk was downhill. Again, a lot of rocks and boulders plus tall weeds (taller than me) for about 3 miles (see the picture in the gallery). 
I stopped at Angel Rest to have lunch and enjoy the view. I met a couple of VA Tech coeds from Blacksburg, and Jamie and David (father and son) from Richmond. They all had hiked up to Angel Rest to see the view. From Angel Rest I only had 2.5 miles to Pearisburg. 
I forgot to mention I did meet Dog Bowl from Richmond VA. He was about 50 and was doing a hike from Harper’s Ferry to Virginia/ NC state line (about 600 miles). 
At 2:15 (5 hours on the trail) I arrived at the parking lot/ road that crosses the AT close to Pearisburg. David and Jamie from Richmond finished about the same time I did and offered me a ride (the walk would have been .8 miles) to the Angel Rest Hostel, the place I’m staying tonight. At Angel Rest I got a room in a 3 bedroom house trailer. I got the master bedroom with my own shower for $50 (hiker’s rate). There are 2 other hikers in the trailer but they use a different bath. The other hikers are Twinkle Toes (a 20 something male doing a flip flop to Springer Mtn) and Right Foot (a 60 year old male who started in Daleville VA – about 100 miles from Pearisburg and plans to hike to Springer Mtn – a 750 mile hike). Right Foot twisted his knee and has been Angel Rest for 4 days waiting to see if he can continue.

After I checked in at 3:00, I showered, washed my clothes, and started my journal. It is now 5:00 PM. More to come.

At 5:30 I walked over to the Lion King to resupply groceries since it will be 5 days before the next resupply. Plus I am concerned about availability of water since I am told there is no water on the trail until the place I meet Mike Pearce on Wednesday. I will need to load up on water, maybe 3 liters (that’s 6 lbs!)

After shopping at Lion King the plan was to go to the best restaurant in Pearisburg, the Mexican restaurant but it was closed because it was Labor Day. I settled on Dairy Queen. I texted Coach (the section hiker I met today) and told him the plan. He came to DQ (about .4 miles from the hostel). After dinner we came back to the house trailer since it had air conditioning and talked with Twinkle Toes. They left at 8:30. I called Marilee and now I am getting ready for bed at 10:15.

A big day. I was up at 6:00 AM. I made coffee in my kitchen at the house trailer. I packed my backpack as the coffee brewed.

Twinkle Toes actually was not staying in the trailer with me. He was in the bunk house. He was just….. (I can’t read)… in the trailer. Coach came over at 7:00 AM to get coffee.

The shuttle was running at 7:30 to take us back to where we got off the trail yesterday (635.9 mm).

I loaded my pack down with water. I took 4 liters instead of the normal 1 ½ liters since we were told there was no water on the trail for 20 miles.

My pack weighed 40 lbs with the extra water. That is a lot. I try to have it no more than 32-34 lbs. 
The plan for today was to go to Rice Field Shelter since there is a huge climb out of the valley so that would have been 7.8 miles. 
I got to Rice Field Shelter at 12:15. I made great time with a 3000 foot elevation gain plus I had a 40 lb pack. I called and talked to Marilee for 20 to 30 minutes since I had cell service. I always feel better after I talk to her. 
At the shelter, Buckle, a female in her early 20’s was having lunch. She is another flip flopper who started on July 31. All the flip floppers I have met know each other. Buckle graduated from a small college outside of Chicago a few years ago. She has worked for a couple of non-profits. She didn’t think she would make a difference in the world with her job so she quit and decided to hike the AT. She was small, maybe 5’4” and very thin but she only has 630 miles to go. Sitting there talking to Buckle I decided to hike some more miles since it was only 12:45 PM. The plan was to find a campsite somewhere down the trail. Tomorrow I meet Mike at Pine Swamp Branch Shelter.

During the next part of my hike I met Beer & Burgh, a husband & wife team in their 20’s. I didn’t talk with them very long since I was getting tired and they had to find a place to camp for the night. They were also flip floppers and knew all the other people I have met.

I got to my campsite at 5:05 PM. I had been on the trail for 9 ½ hours. I had gone 14.4 miles with close to 4000 feet elevation gain with a 40 lb pack. That is a good day. I was very tired. I got my tent up and put the rope up for my bear bag. Buckle did see a bear today. 
I was hungry but did not have enough water to fix a freeze dry meal so I had 2 packages of tuna, crackers, 2 energy bars and some chocolate. 
A south bounder (SOBO) came down the trail while I was eating. This is first SOBO I have met this trip. He left Katahdin Maine on June 18. (They opened the mountain for the summer on June 15. Normally they open it June 1 but they still had snow on the ground.) His name was Steve and this is his 2nd thru hike. He said he has backpacked 20,000 miles. Wow. He was 55. 
I finished dinner and got ready for bed. I am tired tonight.

I had a great night of sleep. I did not get up until 6:45 AM with only 1 bathroom break during the night. I did my morning things: pack up my sleeping pad and sleeping bag, get my bear bag down, brush my teeth, eat breakfast, take down my tent and pack my backpack. I hit the trail at 8:15 with only 6 miles to go. (I was wrong last night when I said I only had 4 miles.) 
I was a little tired. I’m hiking to the location I will meet Mike today. The hike is mostly downhill today. I did meet Bob, a 75 year old retired marine who is doing a 3 day, 30 mile hike. He asked a lot of questions about the trail.

AT 10:50 I got a call from Mike Pearce that he had just landed in Roanoke and would arrive at the trailhead .3 mile from the shelter. (I had phone service but most of the day I had “No Service”.) We decided since I would be there that we would hike to Barley Gap Shelter (3.8 miles from the trailhead) and get a start on tomorrow’s miles and the uphill climb.

More later after Mike arrives. Currently No Phone Service.

Mike arrived at 2:00 PM. He had some extra water that we left on the trail for hikers out of water. We started hiking at 2:15. We only met 1 person in the afternoon. Guru Bob. He was hiking from Harpers Ferry WV to Springer Mtn GA. He did the northern part of the AT last year. He was from Hudson NY and according to the NY Times and him, Hudson is the new Hamptons. He was in his 50’s. He has a sister who used to live in Halbrook in Kansas City but after her children left home, moved to a place in the Upper Plaza. He spends each Christmas in KC.

The hike in the afternoon was short (3.8 miles) but with a big elevation gain (1800 feet). It took 1 ½ hours to get 1.5 miles. The shelter is good. Mike is sleeping in the shelter. I put up my tent. He had ramen noodles, I had a Mountain House chicken and rice MRE. (14 grams of protein and servings for 2).

I went and got water (.3 miles from camp) and we hanged the bear bag. 
I am going to my tent at 7:48 PM. Mike is already in bed. He got up at 4:00 AM Eastern Time this morning.

I have not had phone service. -0 bars since I left my campsite last night. Service is supposed to be spotty the next 2 days.

I forgot to mention, I think with the mileage yesterday I have gone 500 miles on the AT. Also I hiked in my 5th state, West Virginia, on the AT. I have also hiked GA, NC, TN, and VA. I actually saw the markers for the VA – WV state line several times yesterday.

We got up at 6:30AM and were on the trail by 7:50. The original plan was to hike to War Spur Shelter for an 8 mile day. We got to the shelter and decided to go and get a big climb out of the way. Just to let you know the big climb kicked our butts.

We did make it up the climb of 1700 feet elevation gain for the last 2 ½ miles today. It took 2 ½ hours to do this part. We arrived at camp at 5:30 (with an hour for lunch) so we had 9 hours and 40 minutes on the trail. A long day.

We did meet a lot of SOBO people today. A lot of them  ….. know I have met the 6 leading SOBOers (people who started in Katahdin, Maine and are hiking to Springer Mtn GA). 
The SOBOers we met today were Brown Eyed Girl, Baterds from Boston, Wobat (a guy in his 20’s from Australia), Frenchy (male in his early 30s from the west coast of France), Blister (a mid 20’s guy from Fredericksburg VA), Glucose (a 20 something guy from WI), Joka (a 53 yr old male). We also met Smash Burger doing a flipflop and Nibble Feet, (a 63 yr old from northern England) doing a 120 section hike. 
I am exhausted today. As I arrived at the campsite, I started to look for a place to pitch my tent. I stepped within a few feet of a rattlesnake lying next to a log (in the pictures). We got it to move on, but it let us hear his rattler.

We do not have enough water to cook dinner tonight, so we had snacks for dinner. I called Marilee at about 7:30 PM since we didn’t have phone service for a couple of days. As I was talking to her, the tree Mike had attached his hammock to fell. Mike is ok!! I got off the phone to help Mike reset his hammock. Everything is good.

(Editor's Note: We are running a day late posting. With the long days and the lack of phone service, Gordon is late writing and the posts are slow getting thru.)
Sorry for the late post. Our phone service has been bad the last several days.
We had a good, tough hike today. We left camp at 7:50 AM. The big climb today was in the middle of the day which was better than at the end of the day. It was hot today with temperatures in the mid 80’s. We thought we made great time after about 10 miles since it was only 2:30 and we had finished the big climb (2000 feet elevation gain in 2.5 miles). We only had 5 miles left with very little uphill. But it was HOT.

We came to this area called The Ledges (our app said there would be great views). The Ledges are a series of boulders across the top of the ridge We walked for at least a mile across these boulders that varied at angles of 10 degrees to 45 degrees. It was scary. One false move and we would have been calling someone to come get us. We made it across, but it took at least 1 hour. In addition we were running low on water. I had a half of liter left and Mike was completely out. We shared the half liter for the last 3 miles. Mike’s legs were cramping so I went ahead to the shelter to start getting water. I got to camp at 6:30 PM and Mike came shortly after that. Water was .2 miles away, but I went and got 2 liters and brought it back to camp so he could have water. 
Everything is good. Things that happened during the hike today – We did see a bear, but he ran off when he saw us. Also something I thought was interesting today -the boulders we walked across were the Eastern Continental Divide. We saw a sign that said that water flowing to the east had 405 miles to the Atlantic Ocean and water on the western side of the ridge had 1905 miles to get to the Gulf of Mexico.

We also met SOBOers (South bounders) Bean Pot (a guy from Wisconsin), Smokey (guy from UK), and Capone (a guy from Chicago). They were all in their 20’s. We also met Vulture (a girl from Boston in her 20’s). She started a thru hike last year but had leg problems. She is now small section hiking to complete her hike. And we met Otto (a 65 yo guy from Woodstock NY) who was doing long section hikes, and with this was going to finish the trail at Springer Mtn.

Exciting day. We got to see a bear. We were on the trail for 10 hours and 40 minutes today. We were tired but safe.

The hike was good today. Some ups and some downs. The trail was pretty good with 1 big 1700 foot elevation gain. 
We arrived at the shelter at 4:30 PM. We were on the trail 8 hours 15 minutes. We took a lot of breaks today.

The people on the trail today are all SOBOers. Cheeks, a girl from Conn, Why Tho, a guy from Colorado, Sulpen, a guy and Coca Cola Jones, a guy from Wichita KS. They were all in their 20’s.

To follow up from yesterday, we did have a weekend camper stay at our shelter last night – Stan, a student from Radford University in Radford VA. He is a 5 year veteran of the Army. He was 101st Airborne and jumped out of planes in both Afghanistan and Iran. He is studying to be a PE teacher. A really nice kid.

We were up at 6:30 (first light) and left the shelter at 8:00 AM. 
We had a short day planned since we have had some tough days since Mike joined me Wednesday. We needed his body to catch up to all we were doing.

We met 2 SOBOers: Duct Tape from Switzerland and Pond Bear from Bedford PA. Both males in their early 30’s.

It was a steady climb all day. The terrain was hard today especially as we got to Dragon Tooth. Lots of large rock formations we had to climb over or down. It was almost technical rock climbing and it was hard with a 34 lb backpack and poles in your hands (see pictures although the pictures do not do It justice). We did see the Dragon Tooth formation and were surprised by the number of people who had hiked up the 1.4 miles to see it. We saw maybe 20 people. Lots of VA Tech students. 
We made it down to Four Pines Hostel, a 6.5 mile hike. This does not include the .7 miles we hiked out of our shelter this morning. And the hike to the hostel this afternoon. To go this 7.5 miles we were on the trail 7.5 hours.

We got to the hostel at 3:30 and Joe showed up at 4:00. We took showers and went to dinner at The Home Place (picture). After dinner we stopped at the country store and got a few items we needed for the next few days. Plus we had an opportunity to wash our clothes and hang them on the clotheslines. 
I have hiked 112.3 miles in 10 days.

A couple of things to finish up yesterday. Mike continues to have cramps (due to dehydration) throughout dinner last night. It has been really hot. He went to bed about 7:30 PM. I finished up the journal, checked sports scores, and went to bed at 9:30 PM. Graham and Gordon J keep me updated on the NC State, K State and Chiefs scores over the weekends while I’m hiking. A good weekend of football. 
Also the shower and real food were great yesterday. I had not had a real shower and real food since last Monday (6 days). It is unbelievable how simple things make me feel great. 
One last thing, I did wash my hat last night. I think it is good for 10 more days.

Because of the tough days we have had, we decided today would be a “nero” day (nearly a zero mile day). We slack packed only 6 miles. Joe took us to VA311 at 8:00 AM and we hiked the trail south bound back to the hostel. We had a great hike. Most of the hike was along the ridge with plenty of ups and downs but we could see the valley both east and west of us. The last few miles were along a babbling stream that almost sounded like music and of course the birds were singing this morning. We finished at 11:45 AM. Mike headed back to the hostel (.2 miles) and I walked to the country store (added another .6 miles to my hike) to get a hamburger, some food items and Gatorade for both of us.

When Mike got to the hostel he told Joe (the Four Pines Hostel owner) that I had gone to the store so he got in his truck and came to give me a ride back.

At the hostel at 12:30, Mike and I had lunch and looked at our plans for tomorrow while Joe hung out and talked to us. We took showers and washed our clothes from today. The rest of the afternoon we just enjoyed hanging out, drinking Gatorade and admiring the view. Time: 3:00 PM. More to come.

Mike and I spent the afternoon relaxing, sitting on a bench in front of the hostel looking at the mountains, reviewing our plans and talking. It was a great afternoon. At 5:30 we called and ordered a pizza from the country store and Joe took us down to pick it up. Joe is going to pick us up at 7:00 AM tomorrow. We’ll hit the sack around 9:00 PM.

We spent another night at the Four Pines Hostel. I had a great night of sleep. Actually my alarm had to wake us up at 6:05 AM since we were leaving at 7:00. I am hiking solo today. Mike has decided his body has not recovered from the day he got dehydrated. I knew he has not been himself the last several days. The AT is a hard place to recover. He has hiked 700+ miles on the AT. During the month of August he had trained with over 900,000 steps, a lot of those carrying his backpack. He hung in there several days but has decided it would be best to get off the trail.

Sor this morning Donna, Joe’s wife and the other owner of Four Pines Hostel, was taking me to the trail and taking my backpack plus Mike to Daleville.

The plan was for me to slack pack 20 miles from VA 311 to Dalesville. My slack pack weighed about 11 lbs with 3 liters of water. At 7:05 they dropped me off at VA 311. It was very foggy. My first destination would be McAfee Knob, the most photographed spot on the AT. It is 4 miles with a 1900 elevation gain. I reached McAfee Knob at 8:35 – a great time. However it was in the clouds and almost zero visibility. Bummer. Actually it felt like it was raining since we were in a cloud.

I was disappointed. I could not get the picture, but I was excited, I felt great and made great time.

Next stop would be Tinker Cliffs, the 3rd member of the Virginia Triple Crown. The trail was smooth leaving McAfee Knob, so I was moving at a good speed. Visibility was only about 20-40 feet. 
There were a couple of cut limbs (3 to 4 inches in diameter) that although cut were still hanging over the trail at about my head height. I was moving a fast pace and ducked my head to miss them. I missed the first one but the 2nd one struck me squarely on the top of my head. It did not knock me down, but it staggered me. I immediately removed my hat to feel how bad it was. I was bleeding with a pretty good cut on my head. 
I poured cold water over it and applied pressure with my bandana. It stopped bleeding after about 10 minutes. I am fine. I sat down and waited about 25 to 30 minutes to make sure everything was ok. The rest of the hike went great. The views were still socked in until around noon. In the afternoon it did clear so I could get some pictures. 
I truly enjoyed the walk today. I arrived in Daleville at 5:00 PM. I walked 20 miles and had an elevation gain of 4200 feet. I was on the trail for 9 hours 55 minutes. This is great time since I took several water breaks, a 25 minutes lunch break and a 25 minute accident break.

My feet are tender tonight since I took 50,000 steps but I feel good.

Mike and I are staying at the Howard Johnson in Daleville tonight. We went to The Taproom and had a great burger.

Heading to be shortly after 9:00. That’s it for Day 12.

Follow up from Day 12. Mike did get a return flight to KC booked and he will fly out of Roanoke tomorrow afternoon.

Since he was here with a car, after we had breakfast he took me to Black Horse Gap located on the Blue Ridge Parkway at mile marker 743.3. We are staying at the Howard Johnson and it is a dump but it is clean. We left at 7:30 AM and got to the trailhead at 8:00. Some of the views off the Blue Ridge Parkway were spectacular. I hit the trail at 8:10. I did not have the views we had from the Blue Ridge Parkway this morning but I could see the valley through the trees all day. I had a 2800 feet elevation gain which is not too bad over 13 miles. I had a great hike. The trail allowed me time to think. The last 3 miles were in the sun and with temperatures in the 90’s, it was hot. Also the gnats were bad today. 
I only met 3 grumpy old men (50’s) on the trail today. They were doing a day hike. The had on long pants, long sleeve shirts, floppy wide brim hats and were complaining about everything. I did not talk to them very long.

I moved at a quick pace and finished the hike at 2:00 PM, so I went 13.4 miles in 5 hours and 50 minutes. When I got off the trail, I purchased a large Gatorade and some ice cream.

This afternoon I took a shower, washed my clothes, and Mike and I have been talking. Plus we are packing for tomorrow and deciding where to go to dinner. More later. 
AT 5:30 we went to Three Little Pigs for dinner. This place gets mentioned in a lot of the thru hiker blogs. It did not disappoint. 
After dinner I finished getting my pack ready and watched a little TV. I plan on getting an early start tomorrow to try to beat the heat. Bedtime will be 9:00 PM.

Set the alarm for 6:00 AM but I woke up at 5:30. At 6:00 I went to get coffee and something to eat. Bagel with cream cheese, Kellogg’s Corn Flakes, orange juice and coffee. Back to the room at 6:20 and Mike was up. We left for the trailhead on the Blue Ridge Parkway at 6:35.

Mike is heading home today and I am so thankful for all his support the last few days. Mike is a great person for all the things he does to support the youth of our community. I hope he feels better in the next several days. He is a trooper because he already has a planned trip to the AT for October when he will do 7 days in NC with his sister and her friend.

We arrived at Black Horse Gap just as the sun was coming up (see the pictures). I was able to hit the trail at 7:15. The first 9 miles today I think the trail was always within 100 to 500 yards of the Blue Ridge Parkway (BRP). As I hiked I could see it sometimes above me and sometimes below me. The trail went in the valley and then up to the ridge as the BRP was carved around the mountain. I crossed the BRP 4 or 5 times today during my hike and several times were at overlooks on the BRP. During the hike I could always see the valley below through the trees. 
It was an unbelievable hike today because of the views. I did not meet anyone on the trail today so it was just me and the surroundings. I had lots of time to think today. I have said this many times but I have not said it this year; I am the luckiest guy in the world to have the friends, family and especially Marilee. I am very thankful.

During the hike, about 3 miles from the end I called the Middle Creek Campground to let them know I would want a ride in about 1 ½ hours. They told me to call them when I got to VA 614 or Jenny’s Creek Rd. When I got there Cindy was already there waiting for me. I had a big smile on my face. I arrived at 3:20 PM. I was on the trail for 8 hours and 5 minutes. It was a great hike.

Cindy took me to the campgrounds. I got checked in and she gave me a towel and soap for a shower. I am staying at the bunkroom. It does have AC – a window unit. I am the only person here. Cindy and Lauren, a high school student who works here, fixed me a cheeseburger and fries. I also had a bowl of ice cream.

I had a long conversation with Tyson after dinner. He is going to pick me up on Tuesday when I leave the trail on Hwy 60, 9.3 miles east of Buena Vista VA.

I am going to meet Cindy at the store in the morning at 7:30 AM even though she normally comes in at 8:00, and she will fix me breakfast and then take me to the trail. I will follow some of the NFL Thursday night game and turn in around 9:00 PM.

Just to let everyone know, my head is ok. If I ever lose my hair there will be a visible scar but that is ok.

What an interesting day. I was packed and ready to go at 6:45 AM. I was just waiting for Cindy to open the store. She arrived about 7:30 and fixed me some biscuits and gravy. I ate and paid my bill. We were off to the trailhead. I started hiking at 8:15. The morning was in the high 60’s but the air was heavy. I made great time considering the big elevation gains I had.

It started to mist rain around noon but I arrived at Cornelius Creek Shelter at 1:30 PM. It was only 8.8 miles but had an elevation gain of 4200 feet. (Over 4000 a day is a lot.)

I met a SOBOer by the name of Fake Canadian from Montreal. She was born in France and was about 30. I met several (6-8) section hikers who were out for a few days. After arriving at Cornelius Creek Shelter, I decided to have lunch. It was raining harder and was cooling off. Around 2:45 I decided I was going to try for the next shelter, 5 miles away, since this shelter did not have water. Shortly after leaving the shelter I decided to go to Stanimal Hostel in Glasgow to see if they could pick me up at a place on the BRP that was 2.7 miles away. The rain was picking up and this seemed like a good idea. They could pick me up at 5:30. I arrived at Sunset Field Overlook at 4:30. It worked out great.

After checking into the hostel, I got a shower and washed my clothes. I am the only hiker here today. I tried to work it out so I could slack pack tomorrow but there was no availability of beds tomorrow (the weekend). It did not work out.

I did go to the only restaurant in Glasgow (about .2 miles from the hostel). It was Scotto’s. The most expensive dinner on the menu was $9.95. Chicken parm and spaghetti and a beer. I did not get back until around 8:30. After writing my journal I am heading to bed.

During the ride up to the trailhead, it started to rain. It was raining when I started but as I hiked, I got above the clouds and it stopped raining. By 9:30 it had stopped altogether but it was foggy. The trail followed the BRP for about 7 or 8 miles and I crossed the Parkway twice. 
Not much for the views today due to the clouds. I met several weekend hikers (6-8 people). I also met a section hiker who started in Duncansville PA. His name was Papa, in his mid 40’s. I also met 2 SOBOers. They were Gear and Houdini. They were in their 20’s and suggested I should stay at Glasgow shelter in Glasgow (5.4 miles from the AT).

I had a lot of time to think today. I thought about my purpose in life and why it is important to have a purpose. I am one lucky guy.

I will close with my plan changes. I will hike 215 miles. That was my original plan before I knew Mike was coming and without him here, I decided to go back to my original plan. I will end this hike 9.3 miles west of Buena Vista VA. Since I hiked 33 miles the last 2 days I will finish on Monday and Tyson will pick me up Monday afternoon.

The Glasgow shelter now has several people staying the night and they are noisy. It’s Saturday night. I pitched my tent to get away from the noise, but it is not working.

I was awake at 6:00 AM and started getting packed at 6:15 so I would be ready for Phil, the local driver who gives hikers a lift back to the trail. He arrived at 7:20. Phil stopped so I could have coffee with my strawberry pop tart. Last night he gave me a lift and wanted to bet me he was older than me. I told him I did not bet but I knew I was older. Phil is 62. I think Phil has lived a hard life. He has lived in Glasgow for 8 years. He was in the Outer Banks with a fishing gig and a business growing pot that went bad. So he moved to the James River where he could fish. The first 6 years he lived in the woods in a tent. The last 2 years, he has lived in government housing. I asked why he stopped living in the woods. He stopped because there was a female Big Foot that kept stealing his food. He said she ran thru the woods naked. Phil said a local preacher’s wife also saw the female Big Foot and then people started believing his story. So he moved out of the woods because he was afraid of Big Foot. I was completely amazed by the story. I gave Phil a tip, but he did not want to take it because it was too big. I told him it would be for the riders who never left him a tip. He took it.

I thought today there are so many of these stories I hear from people about their lives that I do not write about in the journal since I only have so much time and energy when I am hiking. I love listening to them and I hear a great story almost every day. 
The hike today was 10.5 miles with 3800 ft elevation gain. It was a big up day from the James River to Bluff Mtn (see picture). Since the clouds burned away early, I had some great views during the hike today.

I arrived at the Punch Bowl Shelter at 2:30 (that’s early) and I decided not to hike anymore today since I was tired from the 2 previous days.

No Dice and Tazer showed up at the shelter around 4:00. They are tenting. No Dice is a male, 26 years old from Pittsburgh PA but is a Dallas Cowboy fan. What??!! He will complete his thru hike in 80 miles at McAfee Knob. That’s pretty cool. Tazer is a flip flopper who started in Harpers Ferry. She is heading to Springer Mtn. She is from Baltimore and just got out of the army after serving 6 years. She is 28.

First, Happy Birthday Dani! My daughter turns 46 today. I love you, Dani! Rock out Vegas!

I was awake at 5:30 AM and excited about the day ahead of me. The last day on the trail for 2019. I slept in the shelter since No Dice and Tazer tented and I could pack quickly today.

In my overview I talked about all the experiences I have had, both good and bad while I am on the trail. This adds to the excitement since most days you do not know what these experiences will be. Well today was one of those where I had both good and bad experiences.

It started with a “bad” experience. Like I said, I was awake at 5:30. It is still dark; first light is around 6:40 and sunrise is at 7:00. I started packing. Shortly after that I went to get my bear bag (food) that I had hung the night before and noticed it was on the ground. The bag was still tied to the tree and the cord on the bag was not broken. I had the bag over a limb that was 2-3 inches in diameter on a tree that was a foot in diameter, and it was hanging about 15 feet in the air. Plus it was about 2 feet below the branch it was hung on. No way a bear could get to it. So what happened. A raccoon got to it. My theory is the raccoon climbed the tree and out the branch, jumped down and grabbed the bag, which in turn bent the branch enough for it to slide over the end of the branch. The bag and the raccoon then fell the 15 feet to the ground. I have a very heavy duty food pack that would be almost impossible to penetrate. The raccoon tried several places to get into the bag but was unsuccessful. It was able to create a hole in the bottom of the bag (picture) and reach in and got my planned breakfast of pop tarts, and some ramen noodles. I had very little food left since it was my last day, but the other food was in heavy duty zip lock packages and were not opened. That was one very smart raccoon!

It took me a little time to sort all that out. I packed in my trash bag anything I thought he touched, and I had 2 big scoops of peanut butter for breakfast since my pop tarts were gone.

I left the shelter at 6:55 and reached the trail at 7:05 ready to do my final hike for 2019.

The hike was great in the early morning with the sun coming up over the mountains plus it was cool. I made great time since the trail was smooth most of the day with no big climbs (nothing over 900 feet).

I did meet Warrior (male) and Sun (female), both SOBOers. They started on June 15, the first day Katahdin Maine opened. When hikers came thru Harpers Ferry WV they register as hiking the AT and Warrior and Sun were #21 and #22 SOBOers for the season. I started naming all the SOBOers I had met. The #1 is Legs and I met him my 1st day on the trail 18 days ago. I think I have met around 15 SOBOers. They asked if I had seen Keys (male) and Happy (female) and I told them I had missed them somewhere along the trail. I think I missed them in Daleville. But I had heard Keys was on the trail since his sister knows my nephew, Jack who lives in Charlotte.

The hike was the normal up 300 – 500 feet and down 300 – 500 feet on a very smooth trail. I stopped for a break with 4 miles to go and noticed I had phone service, so I called Marilee to give her an update. Phone service has not been good for several days. I told her I thought I would finish at 1:00 PM. That would be 11.3 miles in 6 hours. 
After talking to Marilee it got my mojo going since I had been very tired this morning having done so many miles the last several days. So I was moving down the trail which was downhill and very smooth. I had stopped using my poles (I was holding them in my hands) since I can walk faster without using them. I almost let the weight of my pack push me down the hill. Remember I said I was moving at a very fast pace and not really paying attention to the trail. Well, in the past I could never understand how a person could do a face plant since I thought you should always be able to catch yourself. I have 660 miles on the AT and have only fallen twice, both times on wet rocks while it was raining. I had always been able to catch myself with my trekking poles when I stumbled.

Moving at a fast pace while just holding my trekking poles I hit a root that I did not see. In a flash I went down with the momentum of my pack driving me forward and the first thing to hit the ground was my head. I was definitely dazed. I also notice I was bleeding. After I came to my senses (at least I think I came to my senses) I grabbed my bandana to see if I could stop the bleeding. I got to my knees and took my phone out to take a selfie so I could see the damage to my head. It was not pretty. I had major road rash (or trail rash) on my forehead. The skin was peeled back. The bleeding stopped. I cleaned the wound, wet my bandana and tied it around my head. I hike the final 3.5 miles in a daze.

I arrived at US 60 at 1:30 PM. I found a shaded spot and waited for Tyson. He was right on time at 3:00. It was a 2.5 hour drive for him.

After Tyson arrived and we had a big hug, we went to Hardees in Buena Vista VA (9.3miles) so I could properly clean the wound using my first aid kit. I am fine, just a little sore today and a pretty messed up forehead and a black eye. (Pictures included but not for the faint of heart.)
Tyson and I got to his house at 6:30 PM. Mel and Stella were just getting home. After I took a quick shower, we went to the drugstore to get something to help protect the wound on my head and then to dinner. 
It was a great drive with Tyson and evening with Stella and Mel.

We all went to bed around 9:00. I was exhausted and elated all at the same time.

I am very appreciative that Tyson was there for me. As I said, I have experienced good and bad things everyday which is part of life, but I hope the good experiences will make dealing with the bad still worth it. Since this is the last post, I want to say again how thankful I am for the support I got from everyone but especially Marilee. 
I am the luckiest guy in the world.

-217 miles on the AT (240+ total miles of walking)
-52,020 ft elevation gain
-580,000  steps
-18 days on the Trail
-12.1 miles/day
-14.1 miles/day the last 6 days on the AT. Covered 98.6 miles in those 6 days.
-20.0 miles on the AT on day 12. The longest single day I have had (my phone app recorded me walking 25 miles)

-169,180 ft elevation gain
-I have hiked in 5 states (GA, NC, TN, VA, and WV)
-56 hiking days on the Trail (58 total days)
-11.8 miles/day

PEOPLE ON THE TRAIL:
-I have meet hundreds (300+) of people on the Trail the last 3 years, in campsites, at shelters and in Trail Towns.
-The one thing all the long section and thru hikers have in common: they all have a story of why they are hiking the AT.
-In the 300+ people I have meet, I still have not anyone who is older than me hiking more than a few days or a weekend. (I know there are people older than me who are doing long sections/thru hikes but I have not meet them. Based on this, I say there are very few of them).
-The majority of the people on the Trail are in their 20s and early 30s.

THINGS I LEARND DURING THIS TREK:
-That I am a LASHer (Long Ass Section Hiker). And that Mike and I are O’Lashers (Old Long Ass Section Hikers).-Water sources were very limited on the AT in Southern Virginia --- Always Plan for the Worst.
-Daleville, Va is a great little Trail Town. It has lots of options for the LASHers and Thru Hikers.
-I confirmed that I do not like long steep climbs on the AT (10 to 15% grade for 2+ miles)

FAVORITE THINGS THAT TOOK PLACE ON THE TRAIL:
-My afternoon and morning at Woods Hole Hostel was very peaceful and relaxing.
-Phil, the person that gave me a ride to the Trail in Glasgow, Va., and his story about his encounter with the female Big Foot.
-My 3 days on the Trail from Daleville, VA to the James River Crossing in Glasgow, VA. It was 43.4 miles and I crossed the Blue Ridge Parkway 8 to 9 times. The views were some of the best I have ever had on the Trail. These views are permanently burned into my memory and I am sorry I could not capture the beauty with my phone camera.

THINGS I WISHED HAD NOT HAPPENED:
-Mike getting sick during his hike and having to leave the Trail. I missed him not being there with me but he was a real trooper the days he hiked.
-The fall I took with 3.5 miles to complete my 2019 trek. It was quite the face plant and it was a real shock to my body. It did scare me until I was able to gather myself together and realized I was going to be  OK. However I was very glad Tyson was going to be picking me up in a few hours.
-I was disappointed my hike over McAfee Knob (one of the most photographed location on the Trail) and Tinker Cliffs was in the clouds.

WHEN I THINK ABOUT THIS TREK (and the other treks) WHAT I WILL REMEMBER YEARS FROM NOW:
-The peacefulness of the morning walks
-How my senses seemed to be heightened (sounds, smells, etc.)
-The people I met and their stories.
-The views that took place daily on the Trail.
-The solitude and the time to reflect on what is important in life.

THANKS FOR FOLLOWING MY 2019 TREK.
We had close to 6000 views this year.
FINAL THOUGHTS: 
Still the 3 words that come to me when I think about hiking the AT are: 

PEACEFUL - The opportunity to enjoy the views, the sounds of the forest, the surrounding wildlife and the solitude of the walk.

PEOPLE - It is great to meet so many people and hear their stories. And 

ACCOMPLISHMENTS - Long hikes on the AT are HARD - setting goals and achieving them or doing the best you can to achieve them is very rewarding.
This year’s trek reminded me it so important that we have a Purpose in Life and we should wake up each day thinking about that purpose. Hopefully that Purpose has a positive impact on the people you love and the world around you. You will have days that things do not go as planned but how you respond to those down days will be what will allow you to achieve your Purpose in Life.
And as I write my Final Thoughts about my 2019 Trek I do realize I am the “luckiest guy in the world”.

 Thanks for following along this year.
 Luckiest Guy in the World,
