Arky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552043,"On March 21, 2016, I will depart Amicalola Falls State Park, Georgia and hike the 8.8 mile approach trail to Springer Mountain where I will start my attempt to thru-hike the 2189-mile Appalachian Trail. 

After following others, via Trail Journals, I will now be the one posting my activities before and during my hike. Yes, I am nervous about everything that goes into preparing for the trail which includes the planning, selecting the gear, clothes and food to retiring from work and beginning the trail in March. Even though I have been planning this for over 10 years, it seems like there is always something else to consider and changes that need to be made.

I feel lucky and very blessed to have the support of my wife, family and friends for this adventure I have thought about for so very long. So with this first AT Journal entry I’m making it official. 107 days and counting.

See you on the trail.",,View Entry,"Dec 01, Thu",0
Arky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552044,"I have been thinking and planning this adventure for over 10 years and along the way have gotten quite a few questions and comments from friends and family. The most often question I receive is “Why would I want to do something like that?” That’s a fair question…one that all aspiring thru-hikers should try to answer at some point. So in no particular order, here are my Top 3 Reasons:

1. I enjoy a challenge. I have done a lot of crazy things in my life and hope to continue doing them as long as I can. Thru-hiking the AT will be difficult to put it mildly. The total elevation change on the AT is the equivalent of hiking Mount Everest 16 times! Every year over 2000 hikers start out to thru-hike the AT and only about 15-20% actually make it. If I do accomplish this, it will be something that I can look back on with pride.

2. I enjoy physical activity. I have run over 30 marathons and numerous other distances over the past 12 years. I stay in good shape by running almost every day. One of the pluses to running is that I can eat what I want without worrying about the calories. This will carry on to a thru hike in that I will need to take in at least 5,000-6,000 calories each day. Even though I eat what I want now, I will need to significantly increase my calorie intake to keep from losing too much weight.

3. I love the AT. I have hiked the AT hundreds of times through journals, movies, YouTube clips, and books. The first book on the AT I read was AWOL by David Miller. In 2016 I followed along on the excellent YouTube videos by Craig and Slim. So, 2017 is my chance to have my own AT adventure and to tell my own story. Hopefully it will be interesting to any potential journal readers and end the way I’ve imagined. However it ends, it will be an adventure.",,View Entry,"Dec 02, Fri",0
Arky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552207,"Ok, so its 104 days and counting until I head to Amicalola. As this is my 3rd journal entry I guess that means it really is official. No turning back now, plus I've already spent so much money on gear my Wife would probably disown me. I’m ready for this adventure to begin!

Speaking of gear, I'm still not sure about everything I plan to bring with me. I do have the big three settled on and researching gear is always fun, so there are a few items that I am still considering and researching. It will be interesting to see what changes and what the list will look like when I'm done. Here's the current list of some of the gear I do plan to bring:

Big 3:

Backpack - Zpacks Arc Blast Backpack - This is probably the lightest backpack on the market. I previously used a ULA Circuit but have opted to start with this one. It’s made of ultralight Hybrid Cuben Fiber Fabric that is waterproof.

Shelter - Zpacks Duplex Tent - This is probably the lightest two person tent on the market. I chose it because I wanted a tent large enough to bring my backpack inside with me, it’s made of Cuben fiber and it very light - 21 oz.

Sleeping Bag - Enlightened Equipment Revelation (20 degrees). This is really a quilt. I have had this for about two years and I love how versatile it is. It’s very warm and light and packs down small.

Other Gear:

Sleeping Pad - NeoAir XLite. This pad is really warm and comfortable. They say it’s noisy, but I haven’t noticed it being any more than normal. I don’t plan on staying in shelters unless necessary, so hopefully this won’t be an issue.

Stove - MSR Pocket Rocket - I have had this stove for 5 years and it works just as good now as it did when purchased. I use a 700 ml pot with it to boil water. I plan to only us this for making hot chocolate and heating water for freeze dried meals.

Water Purification - Sawyer Squeeze - I plan to use the larger Sawyer Squeeze Water Filter Plus. The smaller one clogs very easily and the larger one is not that much heavier. 
 
Food/bear bag - Zpacks - I seem to buy a lot from Zpacks. I have not used this yet but it seems to be very well made and comes with everything you need.

Electronics - I will carry an IPhone 6 or 7 and an Anker 10,800 mAH power pack. I will use the IPhone to take pictures, videos and communicate with my wife. The power pack should charge my IPhone 2-3 times.

Shoes - Saucony Peregrine 5 Trail Runners - I have used these for trail running as well as hiking. They are light, comfortable and durable. I plan to start out with a pair that has about 50 miles on them. I will replace the inserts, but other than that they should be ready to go.",,View Entry,"Dec 06, Tue",0
Arky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552405,"Since you never know what the weather will be like on the Appalachian Trail and especially in March, I decided to test out my cold weather gear to ensure it would keep me comfortable. I planned just an overnight hike and was not disappointed when the temperatures got down into the low 20’s. The hike started at Pinnacle Mountain State Park and followed the Ouachita Trail out and back. 

I was very satisfied with all my gear. My pad and quilt worked very well and keep me warm and toasty. Since this was just an overnight trip, the pack I carried only added up to about 14 pounds. I still need to add a few items such as a rain jacket and pants. My ZPacks pack worked very well but had a minor screak that was little annoying, but overall it was a successful outing and gives me confidence in my cold weather gear.

I know that testing all of my gear on the trail is very important if I am to make it all the way to Katahdin, but getting advice from former thru hikers is something that I believe every aspiring thru hiker needs. I would like to thank Sparky, AT Class of 2013 for the much needed and appreciated advice.",,View Entry,"Dec 12, Mon",0
Arky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/552469,"I registered for my thru hike a few weeks ago and today received a letter from the Appalachian Trail Conservancy and a commemorative thru-hiker hangtag. The letter also contained some basic tips and a link to the seven principles of Leave No Trace. 
 
But the most interesting information that was included was the official 2017 length of the AT which is 2,190.3 miles. The official length in 2014 was 2,185.3. So this year the trail is 5 miles longer than a couple of years ago. I searched back a few years and I’ve not found a year where the official length was over 2,190 miles. I did see where the trail measured 2,168.1 miles in 2001.
 
All this really doesn’t mean anything in the larger scheme of things. The only thing that does matter is the enjoyment of doing something we all love.

For me, and I assume for many others, this new year will soon be filled with work, activities, promises, commitments, friends and family members. With my AT hike starting in about 2 and a half months, I predict the start of this New Year will be a busy one.

Arky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553144,"Based on the Appalachian Trail Conservancy 2017 thru-hiker registration charts (as of January 5th) there will be a lot of hikers starting around my planned March 21st starting date. That’s okay with my wife as she was concerned that I would be alone when starting. It’s okay with me also since it always nice to see other hikers on the trail. 
 
I normally don’t see anyone when hiking the Ouachita or Ozark Highlands trails in Arkansas. On my last three day hike of the Ozark Highlands trail I didn’t see a single hiker. That’s not unusual and I really didn’t expect to see any. I guess I’ll have to get used to seeing a lot of other hikers.

I have almost all of my gear ready. The hard part now is the waiting. One of the items I have not decided on yet is a portable charger. I have an Anker 3350mAh that I have used in the past but I feel a larger one will be needed for the AT. I have looked at the Anker 10000mAH and feel it should be enough. 
 
This next weekend I plan to do some trail running. I’m going to try out a new pair of Saucony Peregrine 6 trail runners that I may use on the AT. I have used Hoka, Nike and Altra trail runners in the past so I’m interested to see how the Saucony’s do.

Arky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/553585,"This weekend I plan to increase the training a little more for my planned thru hike. Even though I run 3-4 times a week, running and hiking are two different things. I have found that running can help with the endurance but the leg strength and stamina to hike for 8 hours is an entirely different matter. They say that about a fourth of thru hikers will not make it past Neels Gap. I think one of the reasons is that hikers are just not prepared for the mountains in Georgia and those first 31 miles can be a rude awakening. Being properly prepared physically in the beginning could be the difference in making it to Katahdin.
 
To prepare for my thru hike, which incidentally will start exactly 2 months from now, I have implemented a training program that includes hiking on trails a couple of times a week for 1-3 hours in addition to my regular training runs. During this time I will carry a full pack with about 5 additional pounds than what I plan to start out with on the Approach Trail.
I also don’t use my trekking poles during my training hikes. I do plan to use trekking poles on my thru hike but training without them seems to help with balance and stamina. When I first started using trekking poles they just didn’t seem to help and I even tripped over them a couple of times. To some people using them just comes naturally, but that was not the case with me. Then I accidentally ran across a video on YouTube about the proper use of trekking poles. Following that advice I now don’t see how I could even attempt a long distance hike without them. If you are interested, here is a link to a video about how to use trekking poles: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q2YwOE4okA. It’s not the original one I watched, but it still has some good tips.

On the training this weekend I plan to pick trails that have some steep ups and downs and go back and forth on them to stimulate the PUDs of the AT. PUDS is thru-hiker shorthand for ""pointless ups and downs"", referring to the less interesting sections of mountains thru-hikers encounter from time to time; several PUDS in a row are MUDS, which is shorthand for ""mindless ups and downs"". I plan to start out slow and try to go a little faster after a while but also be careful not to overdo it. A fall resulting in a broken arm or leg is not a good idea this close to the start or anytime.

Good luck on your training and preparation, don’t overdo it, be safe and I will see you on the trail.",,View Entry,"Jan 21, Sat",0
Arky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/554479,"Just a few more weeks and it will be time to travel to Georgia and start my thru-hike. In the mean time for the past few weeks I have been practicing setting up my ZPacks Duplex Camo Tent. I agonized a long time on whether to get the camo version or not, but now that I have it I’m very satisfied. It is not as transparent as the olive drab or blue fabric. It is also slightly thicker fabric weight which makes it .67 oz/sqyd instead of the standard .51 oz/sqyd. This also makes it a little heavier, but not much.
 
I have also been busy getting everything at work ready so I can retire. I will miss my co-workers and I have enjoyed my job, but now is the right time to retire and do all the things I have waited so long to do, and for right now that is thru-hiking the Appalachian Tail! 
 
I noticed there are a couple of hikers who have journals that have already started and about five more that will be in the next few weeks. Good luck to all of you on your journey.

Arky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/556179,"One week from tomorrow I will leave for Georgia to begin my hike. My Wife, Granddaughter and her husband will drive me there, we will spend the night and I will be on my way the next day. 

Until then I have a number things to get done. One of them is to go through my gear again, which will be about the 100th time, and make sure I have everything I need. I have included a picture of of the gear I will be bringing. This includes everything except what I will be wearing. It looks like my pack will weigh about 14 pounds without food or water. With 3 days of food and a liter of water it should weigh about 22 pounds. 

The other things I need to get done include finishing some projects around the house, getting some paperwork completed and running the Spring Fling 5k in Cabot. 

I also just retired last Friday from my job of 33 years. It was difficult saying goodbye to all my co-workers and friends, but many of them will be following me on this journey. It's hard to believe that I only have about a week until I start, so I'm getting pretty excited.

Arky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557130,"After the long drive to Amicalola State Park and spending the day with my Wife, Granddaughter and her husband, I was ready to head back home. The thought of 2200 miles without my Wife was just now sinking in. She is my best friend and being separated from her for 4 to 5 months is going to be the hardest thing I have ever done. But it’s her love and support that will help me to do this.This morning they dropped me off at Amicalola and we said our goodbyes. I was hard but it did not take long for the reality to set in as I started up the trail. I've heard some bad things about the Approach Trail but I enjoyed the trail and the views through the trees from the ridgeline. I left the park at 7:45 and was on top of Springer by 11:00. The trail was tough as it goes from about 2600 feet to 3800 feet.I took several pictures at Springer, signed the registry, talked to a few fellow hikers and officially started my first mile on the Appalachian Trail. The trail down from Springer was easy and about a mile later I was at the crossroads where many hikers are dropped off to begin their hike. They are heading the direction I just came from as they must go the .9 mile to Springer, to officially begin their thru hike.The rest of the day was fairly easy and flat so I took my time to enjoy the scenery. Now it’s 7:30 pm and I am here at Hawk Mountain Shelter in my tent. There are probably 25 or 30 people here and too many names to mention (if I even could remember them). So, today’s mileage is 16.7 with only 8.1 of that on the AT. Now it’s time to finish my Mountain House supper and finish the coke I brought to celebrate my first day on the AT.","

At about 9:30 a thunderstorm came through with hard rain and hail. It was so bad I thought my tent was going to be blown away. Luckily, my tent held up and I was dry and safe.

Sassafras mountain was supposed to be the big climb for the day but I got through okay. It was that hill right after Gooch Gap that really got me. If it had not been for the lentil beef soup trail magic at the gap I'm not sure I would have made it.

I am still hungry but my food bag has been hung and I'm not getting out of my tent just for a snack. Tomorrow is Blood Mountain and then Neal Gap. It will be a short day for me as I plan to rest up there overnight in a real bed.

The climb up Blood Mountain was slow and it took almost two hours to get there. Blood Mountain is the highest mountain so far at 4457 ft. It was a clear day and the views were beautiful.

The trail down was very steep in spots with slippery rock formations. I went slow to make sure I didn't trip and fall. It seemed like it took forever but I finally arrived at Neel Gap at about 11:30. Neel Gap or Mountains Crossing is the only spot on the AT where the trail is covered as it goes through a section of the building.

I had planned to make this a short day and rest up a little. I immediately headed for Blood Mountain Cabins, which is about a quarter mile away, and was lucky enough to secure a spot in one of there cabins. I am now showered, eaten (pizza and Coke) and now resting in a real bed.

So at 7:30 I set out and started the long climb out. The weather was windy and cold with no views because of the low clouds. It stayed this way for the first 2.5 hours with rain at the higher points. It was cold and windy going over Poor Mountain at about 3600 feet.

A few miles later going up Wildcat Mountain it started to rain but thankfully it didn't last long. After that it started to warm up and the trail was nice and rolling for several miles. But as previously on the AT it didn't last long. The climb to Blue Mountain was long and rocky. Blue Mountain is the highest point on the AT so far at 4010 feet.

I was very tired after my longest day yet and quickly put up my tent fixed something to eat and turned in for the night. As I lay here several more hikers arrive and they seem just as tired as I am. It looks like it's going to be a peaceful night.

I am now at Deep Gap Shelter inside my tent resting my sore knees. These Georgia mountains are tough on the knees with all the steep accents and decents. I plan to go into Hiawaasee, Georgia tomorrow afternoon to see if a half day of rest will help them.

Since I had planned a short day for today anyway, I took my time hoping the rain would stop before taking my tent down. It is always tough taking down a wet tent and packing it away. 

The trail was slick and muddy and I took my time knowing that the shuttle to take me into Hiwaasse would not be at Dick's Creek Gap until 11:00. Hiwaasse is a nice trail town with everything a hiker would need including an Outfitter, an Engels grocery store and several good places to eat.

Once I checked into the Budget Inn, I hung out my tent to dry, washed all my clothes and then headed to the nearby Dairy Queen for a delicious hamburger and French fries. I then walked about a half mile to Engels to resupply for the next three days. 

I have been having some pretty significant knee pain in the last three days and I took this opportunity to also visit a pharmacy to purchase a knee brace and Biofreeze. Hopefully these will help with the pain on the trail and at night. I haven't slept well lately and reducing the pain should help. I am trying to not take any pain medicine such as ibuprofen or Advil which have caused me stomach problems in the past.

Tomorrow I will be shuttled back where I left the AT and continue on into North Carolina. I am ready to be finished with Georgia.

By the time I was on the trail it was 9:30 which was okay because I had only planned to go as far as Muskrat Creek Shelter 11.8 miles ahead. 

As the day progressed I reached the GA-NC border and I took the obligatory picture of the sign and started climbing the first mountain in NC. The mountains of North Carolina are straight up and much taller than Georgia mountains. Within the first 1.2 miles I had gained over 800 feet in elevation.

Finally after what seemed like going up mountains the trail leveled out some and I took the first decent camping spot I could find. I stopped at Deep Gap and quickly setup my tent as it was supposed to rain tonight. Which it did. Along with lightning and thunder and wind. A little rain got into my tent, but nothing serious.

The trail early was fairly easy which was a welcome change from recent days. Around noon the trail started to gradually climb and I was rewarded with some of the best views so far. Then in the distance I got my first view of the Albert Moontain fire tower. What I had heard was right about the climb up. Most of the time my trekking poles were useless and I was using trees and rock holds to pull myself up. 

Finally I reached the summit and the most beautiful views so far. What had started out as a rainy foggy day was now sunshine and almost no clouds. The Albert Mountain fire tower is a Natonal Historic lookout. The tower is 40 feet tall and has an observation room on top. The Albert mountain Fire tower elevation is 5350 feet.

I have arranged to be picked up by a shuttle at 11:30 at Winding Stair Gap. Ron Havens offers a free shuttle ride into Franklin and was actually driving the shuttle. On the ride to his Budget Inn he offered several pieces of information to the hikers on board. This included a rough layout of Franklin and the best places to eat and/or drink beer. He also provided some friendly advice on resupply and the cost of shuttles and places of resupply for the next 100 miles.

After checking into the Budget Inn, it was time to get something to eat other than Mountain House meals and Ramen Noodles. Along with two fellow hikers we headed over to the Motor Co. Grill for a great hamburger and fries.

For tomorrow I have a decision to make. First, weather to take my first Zero day (a day with no hiking), or take the shuttle back to the trail and continue hiking. I have not been sleeping well lately because of the knee pain and all the stormy weather. Taking a day off to rest up would probably be the best decision right now.

Here is the story on my knee. I originally had it operated on when I was in the Army. It has caused me problems ever since. The problems include pain, swelling and instability. Over the years I have been able to cope with these problems with the help of Cortisone and Synvisc one injections to the point where I have ran numerous marathons and other distances.
 
Usually in January or February of each year I get a Synvisc injection for the upcoming running season. For you that are not familiar with Synvisic, it’s an injection that supplements the fluid in your knee to help lubricate and cushion the joint, and can provide up to six months of osteoarthritis knee pain relief. I opted to not get one this year because it did not seem to help much anymore and it’s expensive.

Not getting the injection this year was probably a mistake. I also underestimated how steep and long the mountains in Georgia and especially North Carolina are. The long and increasingly difficult assents and descents plus adding to that carrying a 25 pound backpack produced the constant pain and swelling that I currently have in my knee.

I am not ready to give up yet on a thru hike. If things go well next week, I will be back soon at Winding Stair Gap ready to continue. Thanks to everyone who has sent me messages and called to offer encouragement and support.

Arky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587730,"The temperature last night got down to about 15 degrees, so as soon as possible I packed everything and was on my way before 8:00.  I was actually awake at 6:30, but it took me that long to unthaw and get everything packed up.  This included boiling water for a hot cup of cocoa.
As I started out I noticed that everyone in the shelter were still sleeping.  Maybe it was good I tented instead of waking everyone to get an early start.  The reason for my early start was to try and make it into the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC). The AT goes right through the NOC and it is a well known rafting destination. The also have a restaurant, general store and hostel for thru hikers called “the Base Camp”. This is really nothing more than a small room with buck beds. 
As I started walking I thought making the NOC would be difficult because the map showed two climbs above 5000 feet as well as going over Wesser Bald which should have some great views. It would then be a long 6 mile mostly downhill to the NOC.
Th weather did not cooperate and there were no views this day.  I walked through about a foot of frozen snow most of the day until getting below 2500 feet where it suddenly all disappeared.  It was about 6:00 when I finally arrived at the NOC.  It was a tough day and I reminded myself that I was supposed to start off easy and take lots of breaks.  That’s what my wife told me to do.
I secured a room at the Base Camp and was able to eat a hamburger and fries at the Rivers End restaurant before going to bed.  Life is good on the Appalachian Trail.","Wayah Bald Shelter

Arky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587766,"I waited around at the NOC in order eat breakfast and did not leave until about 9:30.  I did sleep better but my legs and especially my ailing knee did not seem to get enough rest after the 16.5 mile previous day.  Also, I was not looking forward to the climb out of the NOC which goes from 1732 feet to Swim Bald at 4710 feet in 6 miles.  
The Long continuous climb out of the NOC was tough.  Along the way I passed the Wade Sutton Memorial which was placed on the trail at the site where he died while fighting a Forrest fire.Since the day was mostly clear, the temperature was nice and there were several great views. One of the best was at a site called the Jump Up which had a great view of the Nantahala Gorge.
By the time I got to Sassafras Gap shelter at 2:30 pm, continuing on up to Cheoah Bald, which is at 5062 feet, was not very appealing.  So I took my wife’s advice and called it a day.  I set up my tent, streatched out and rested in the warm sun and prepared for a good nights rest.  Little did I know that a front was moving in that would send 50-60 mile an hour wind gusts directly upon my tent.  Several times that night I would have to redo my tent stakes that came loose.  Finally I piled rocks on them which solved that problem.  But I did not get the rest I was looking for because of all the flapping from my tent.
Not a good night on the Appalachian Trail.","Nantahala Outdoor Center

Arky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587772,"After a tough night dealing with howling, high winds, I was anxious to get my tent packed up and move on. It was a chore to get my tent packed up without it blowing off the mountain, but I succeeded and was on my way by 8:00 up to Cheoah Bald.
With the day mostly clear these were some of best views so far.  I took it a little slower since my legs and knee were still sore and enjoyed the beauty of the AT.  At mile marker 150.3 the AT crosses NC143 at Stecoah Gap. As always coming out of a Gap there is always a climb coming up.  This climb was unusually tough.  It probably took me an hour to go .6 mile.  At the top I looked at the AT map on my phone and realized I had just completed the infamous “Jacob’s Ladder”.
After that was over the trail was easier and I decided to bypass Brown Fork Gap Shelter and stealth camp further on.  Stealth camping here is basically anywhere other than at a shelter.  The advantages of staying at a shelter is that there is water nearby, people nearby and most important, a privy.  The place I selected was Cody Gap which had a water source close by.

Arky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587786,"It was an uneventful night, for once, at Cody Gap.  I got up early with my next destination being Fontana Lake.  The trail looked fairly easy and I was hoping to be at Fontana by 1:00 pm in order to check into the Fontana Village Lodge and resupply.
The trail was easy and I made it to the famous Fontana Hilton Shelter before 1:00.  The Fontana Hilton is special amoung AT shelters in that is overlooks the beautiful Fontana Lake, has a solar powered cell phone charger, real bathrooms close by and best of all, showers.
But I’m not staying here, I’m going to catch a shuttle at the nearby parking area where it will take me the 1.8 miles to Fontana Village.  Fontana Village was originally built as a town for the workers and their families who came from all around the country to construct the Tennessee Valley Authority Fontana Dam.  Construction of the Dam began in 1942 and was completed in 1944.
Fontana Village is now mostly a tourist town and resort community.  Today is Saturday and there are BMW motorcycles all over the place.  Most of the riders seem to be affluent older couples.  No one seems to notice me with my stinky hiking clothes, muddy trail shoes and backpack.
I’m checked into the lodge and am now on my way to get some real food and resupply for entry into the Great Smoky Mountains tomorrow.","Cody Gap

Arky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587819,"The shuttle back to the Fontana parking area does not run until 8:30am, so I had plenty of time to pack up and have a nice breakfast for a change.  Usually my breakfast includes two pop tarts and a protein bar.  This morning I had biscuits and gravy, scrambled eggs and cantaloupe.  It was great.
I was the only one waiting when the shuttle pulled up at 8:30 and had a nice drive to the parking area.  Today is supposed to be warmer with sunshine.  Then rain is forecasted for the ne txt four days.  
The walk down the road to the Dam was easy and I could see beautiful views of the lake as I crossed the Dam.  Shortly the road passed the Great Smoky Mountain National Park sign and a little later I put my hiking permit into the permit box and I was on my way.  All hikers in the Great Smoky Mountain National Park must either have an AT thru hiking permit or a backcountry  permit to stay at one of the shelters.  Tenting is only allowed near a shelter and then only when  the shelter is full.
The first good view of the day was at Shuckstack Fire Tower which evnvolved climbing several narrow flights of steps to a small observation platform. This would a great view of the lake and Dam.
As the day progressed the trail gradually went from 1756 feet at Fontana Dam to over 4500 feet at mile marker 172.  Keeping with my lower miles plan I had planned to stay at the Mollies Ridge shelter which would give me about 9 miles for the day.  When I arrived there at 2:30pm their was hardly anyone there.  This meant that I would be staying in the shelter.  Looking at an alternative I decided to move on to the next shelter hoping it would be full so I could tent.  Have I mentioned that I hate staying in shelters.
Two and a half hours later I arrived at Russell Field Shelter to find it almost full. I was sure more hikers would arrive so I found a good spot and setup my tent.  I went back to the shelter later to fix my supper out of the wind.  Supper tonight included chili flavored Ramen with corn chips and a Kind bar for desert.It was then time to hang my food bag and rest up for some higher mountains tomorrow.","Fontana Dam

The day started with Rocky Top at 5440 feet, Thunderhead mountain at 5527 and then finally Cold Spring Knob at 5204.  By 2:00 it had starting raining and the wind had picked up.  The last climb to Silers Bald Shelter was treacherous and tiring.  Upon reaching the shelter I found it full with wall-to-wall hikers.
That did not surprise me since no one wants to tent in rain and high winds.  I looked around for a spot that might shield me from some of the wind but found none.  Finally I setup close to the shelter and prepared for a long night.","Russell Field Shelter

Arky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/587829,"Last night may have been the worse night I have ever spent in a tent.  The wind howled all night and along with the rain made my tent a wet mess.  Several times my tent stakes came loose collapsing my tent and only by pilling rocks on then was I able to keep it up.  The winds could easily have gusted to 50-60 MPH.
Most everything in my tent was damp or wet.  I use several dry bags so all my important items such as my change of clothes, electronics and food were dry but everything else was not.  It was a good thing my Enlightned sleeping bag retains heat even when damp.  At one time I even used my hiking umbrella to hold up the tent and keep out the rain.
Finally at 6:00am, after a long sleepless night, I decided to just get up and put on whatever dry clothes I had and hike as quickly as possible to the Clingmans Dome parking lot to get a ride into Gatlinburg to dry out.
With the wind blowing so hard I put my puffy jacket on under my rain jacket to stay warm and quickly ate a cherry pop tart before loading everything up.  The last to pack up was my wet tent which took a while to get into its bag.
Heading out I was cold, wet and miserable.  I did not look forward to the next few miles which included some of the highest altitudes on the entire AT.  At about mile 2 I finally made it over Mt Buckley at 6603 feet. The wind and rain pounded me made it extremely hard.  
Finally I came to the sign pointing to the Clingmans Dome parking lot and headed that way as fast as possible.  It was here that I came on another hiker.  I slowed down to pass him and asked how he was doing.  Besides being wet and cold he was doing fine.  He had hiked to the shelter a couple of miles back the day before and had decided to turn back this morning.  His car was parked in the parking lot and asked me if I needed a ride to Gatlinburg.  Without hesitation I accepted.  Eddie delivered me safely to the Quality Inn in Gatlinburg and even waited until I had gotten a room before leaving.  Thank you again Eddie.  You were a life saver that day.
I was shivering as I made my way to my room and quickly took off all my wet clothes and took a long, hot shower.  Boy did that feel good.  The next few hours I spent washing and drying all my clothes, laying my tent out to dry and getting something to eat.
I’m now safe and warm in my hotel room catching up on my Journal.","Silers Bald Shelter

Today it is back to the trail as I caught the 8:30 shuttle back to Clingmans Dome.  The First Baptist Church of Gatlinburg provides this service free of charge to hikers.
It is not raining in Gatlinburg but halfway it starts to rain and is very foggy.  When the shuttle lets us out i hurry to one of the restrooms to make sure all my rain gear is in place.  
First up is Mt. Love and passing the 200 mile mark.  With the rain, fog and wind supposed to last all day, there is nothing to do but hike.
At the 207.3 mile marker is Newfound Gap and US 441.  This is also the border of Tennessee and North Carolina.  I remember stopping here many years ago when vacationing with family. 
The day and miles go slow because of the mud and slippery conditions.  I’m glad when the shelter comes in sight.
There are lots of hikers here, so I will be tenting tonight again.  It is still raining but at least where my tent is there is no wind.  Hoping for a restful and uneventful night.","Clingman’s Dome

The trail is not too bad today as the climbs are not as long and the descents seem less severe.  There are still no views and around 11AM it starts a slow steady rain which is not helping the muddy conditions already on the trail.
The rain stops about 3:00 as I approach Tri-Corner Knob Shelter so I decide to call it a day and get my tent up before the rain starts again.  I don’t even check to see if the shelter is full because there is already one tent setup.
There are no good places to setup, so I choose the best one available, which slants downhill.  I guess I will be fighting to keep my mattress from sliding out of the tent all night.  Good times on the Appalachian Trail.","Icewater Spring Shelter

I was on the trail by 6:30 with the idea to get out of the smokies today.  This will make for a long day, but it will mean that I will not have to sleep in my tent because Standing Bear Hostel is only about 18 miles away.
The trail today looks to be mostly down hill, which should help, but is not a good thing for me.  Both my knees actually hurt more going downhill than up.  I use my hiking poles to ease the decent and if not for them I would not be able to make it. 
The other problem today is the mud, wet rocks and roots make the trail slippery and dangerous.  After only a few miles my feet and pant legs are a muddy mess.  I go as fast as I can and around 3:00 I reach Davenport Gap.  
The trail is not so bad here as it is mostly level.  I cross under I-40 and slowly go up the rock stairs on the other side.  They are steep and seem to go on forever. Finally I make it to the turnoff to the hostel, which is .5 miles off the trail.  
When I arrive I find out they are full but they offered a place on the back porch out of the rain.  It seems fine and there are a couple of friendly cats to keep me company.  I accept.  I go ahead and setup my tent, purchase a coke and pizza and settle in.  It’s just me and the cats.  I feel right at home.","Tri-Corner Knob Shelter

Even after the long day yesterday, my legs did not feel too bad today.  It’s probably because I had a really good nights sleep on the back porch and also the trail today was a lot better as far as the steep ups and downs.
The day started out foggy and cold but as the day progressed the fog and clouds went away and the sun came out making for really nice afternoon and several nice views.   Max Patch was the highlight of the day but there were way too many hikers there camping out and milling around.
Tomorrow I plan to hike the remaining miles into Hot Springs. I have a room reserved at the laughing Heart Hostel witch is right on the trail.  Once there I will be able to spent a night in real bed, eat some good town food and resupply.

As the day goes by it occurs to me how much better I enjoy hiking when the weather is nice.  I guess I must be a fair weather hiker.
About 4:30PM I come out of the wood right at the Laughing Heart Hostel.  I had called earlier to reserve a room, which was the last one available.  I get into my room, unpack my gear and head for the shower.  Now, nice and clean, I head down the hill into Hot Springs to the Mountain Valley Diner to get something to eat.  After that I go next door to the Dollar General to resupply.
I will need 4 days of food to make it to Earwin,TN, which will probably be the end of this hike.  If you read my entries from last year, you know that I got off the trail because of my knee. I can hike with it but the pain at night kept me from sleeping and basically exhausted me.  When I returned home the doctor suggested a knee replacement.  After thinking about it, talking to others that have had it, and doing some online research, I decided to not have it done.
My preparation for returning to the trail this year included getting a steroid shot in my knee just before leaving, purchasing a new knee brace and settling on a schedule to start out easier. The schedule includes shorter days and more rest. I knew this would be a problem because I am an early riser and I hate to sit around while I could be hiking.  
When I started out this time I have tried to walk slower and take more time enjoying the views and interactions with the other hikers.  This has worked only partially in that all the bad weather gave little time for views (because there were none) and I saw very few people in the mood to talk much (because of the bad weather).
I have had several long days during this hike and I really don’t mind them.  I guess it’s the marathon running mentality in me.  But, the long days, over time, wear me down and make my knee pain worse.  I could take off a few days to rest up, but that is just not in my nature.  I could not sit around some hostel or hotel and do nothing but rest.
So, the conclusion all this is that I am just not a thru hiker. I really knew this before this hike started, but I wanted to try again.  I can hike for two or three weeks and really enjoy it, but much beyond that is just too difficult for me at this point in my life.  Section hiking is what I plan to now do in the future.  I think I will pick out 200-300 mile sections of the trail that really interest me and hike them next.  I think one I would really enjoy would be to start at Baxter State Park in Maine and hike south for a few weeks or hike through the Presidential Mountains.I plan to enjoy as much as possible this next week.  The weather is suppose to be good and who knows, I might even take it slow and enjoy the scenery.","Roaring Fork Shelter

I’m trying to take it slow this morning and enjoy the great weather and scenery.  My knee feels fine today but last night I noticed both my ankles and feet were swollen.  They don’t hurt and I don’t what could cause them to swell.
A few miles into the day and I come across a pretty pond with benches.  I try not to pass up any benches on the trail without trying them out.  Also a few miles further there is a tower on top of Rich Mountain that had some great views.
Since today is Sunday, there are a lot of day hikers that pass me going South.  There also seem to be a lot of South bound section hikers along with a lot of North bound thru hikers that pass me.
I had planned to take a short day and stop at Spring Mountain Shelter, but I got there at 1:30PM and didn’t like the looks of it, so I hiked on a couple of miles to Deep Gap, which is where I am now in a nice level tent site.  It’s now almost 7PM, so I maybe the only one here tonight.

The day started fairly easy with mostly easy down hill, but the downhill turned into a knee breaking rock hopping that seemed to go on and on.
Next the trail started going up and went from 2376 feet to 4750 feet in a little over 5 miles.

The climbs today are shorter but they seem to be steeper.  The climbs don’t bother my knee as much as the decents, but the long day yesterday cause them to tire out quicker.  
There is one long climb near the end of the day that takes everything I have to complete.  Hogback Ridge Shelter is at the top of a that long climb and in an glad to see the Shelter, even if it is .02 off the trail.

I was up and ready to leave at 7AM.  I am almost always the first to leave.  I prefer the cool mornings and the birds singing while I hike.  The weather since Saturday has been beautiful, with clear skies and cool winds.  This is quite a change since the cold, snowy/rainy and windy weather I experienced my first few days on the trail and thru The Smokies.
The trail today was challenging.  It included a steady climb all morning, climaxing with the summit of Big Bald at 5516 Feet.  The views were spectacular and what made it better was that I as the only one there.  The trail stayed above 5000 Feet until 2.5 miles away from my intended stopping place.  The trail then descended almost 1500 feet, which was not good for my sore knees.

It starts to rain as I reach my destination, but it’s all good.  I plan to tent tonight as the bunkhouse is not for me.  Thanks to Alex for the ride into town.","Stealth Camping Spot

Arky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612591,"I considered taking a zero in Hampton, but it was supposed to be good weather today with rain the next day.  I was hoping it would be good weather crossing the Lake Watuga Dam.
Sure enough, the sun was shining and I got some great pics of the Lake and the Dam.  The trail was fine as it circled the lake, but after crossing the dam it stated to go uphill and would continue this for most of the first 9 miles.  
Even with the climbs, I was still able to make good time and once I got to the Vandeventer Shelter the trail became easier as it followed several roadbeds.
By mid afternoon, I changed my original destination for the day and decided to try for Double Spring Shelter.  Most of the time I end up just stopping when I get tired enough, but it was still early and I still felt pretty good.
It was a little late than normal, but I made it to the Shelter and still had time to get all my chores done before dark.  I’m pretty sure that 23.6 miles is a record for me.  Hopefully I won’t be feeling it tomorrow.
Going those extra miles now set me up for a easier day into Damascus tomorrow. Hopefully it won’t rain all the way there.","Hampton, TN

Arky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612639,"It started raining during the night, but stopped just before 5 AM.  I quickly got packed up and was ready to go by 6 AM.  I hate to take my tent down and get everything stowed away while it’s raining.
I was on the trail by 6:30 and headed for Damascus.  Damascus is one of the most famous trail towns on the AT.  They annually hold a Trail Days festival in May which is attended by hundreds of hikers, vendors and others.  Trail Days this year in on May 17-19.
I only have about 18 miles to cover, so I’m looking forward to some town food tonight.  Even though the trail is not bad, it starts to rain, hard at times and it’s a struggle to make it up even the slightest climbs.  It helps that most of the last 10 miles into Damascus is downhill.
Along the way at about MM 470 I come across the TN-VA border sign.  Finally I’m out of TN after being in and out of it for what seems like forever.  Virginia though is the state with the most miles within the AT, so we will be in Virginia for a while.
It’s still raining as I reach Damascus but I’ll be out of the rain tonight and not in my tent.  It seemed like a long day, and all those miles without a break are getting to me.  Maybe now is the time for a well earned zero day.  We’ll see.","Double Springs Shelter

Arky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612662,"Decision made.  The rain has stopped and it is a beautiful day.  I would rather be walking the AT then spending the day in town with nothing to do.
Just after the sun came up I was headed out of town on the Virginia Creeper Trail which is also in some places part of the AT.  After leaving the Creeper Trail the AT goes up into the mountains and soon crosses US 58 on the Straight Branch footbridge as well as several streams.
The trail continues to gradually go up and reaches 3350 ft at Sanders Shelter.  It starts to rain again as the trail gradually descends again crossing several streams and footbridges including the neat Luther Hassinger Memorial Bridge and even follows the Creeper Trail for a ways.
At Lost Mountain Shelter I consider stopping for the night, but again, it is too early and I push on to a campsite shortly after filling up with water at a spring.
Tomorrow should be an interesting day as the AT enters Grayson Highlands State Park where the famous ponies are.","Damascus

Arky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612772,"Today will be my last full day on the AT for this year.  I was hoping to get at least 200 miles in but I may fall just a little short.  
Today started out with no clouds in the sky and a forecast for highs in the 80’s, but that is in town and not at 5000 ft.  I’m sure I’ll be sweating all day anyway.
The trail goes above 5000 ft for the first time in a while when I reach White Top Mountain and then 5200 ft at Briar Ridge. Along the way there are several nice views but my legs are getting tired and I am sweating a lot more than usual so the views are coming at a price.
The side trail to Mt. Rodgers, Virginia’s highest mountain at 5729 ft, does not interest me. 
As the trail starts to level out and descending, my legs start to feel better and I look forward to the Fatman Squeeze (a rock tunnel), which I have no problem with, and something I have been looking forward to - ponies!
Grayson Highlands State Park is famous for the herd of ponies that roam the park.  It does not take long after entering the park to see signs of them and finally the ponies themselves.  The Park does not allow you to feed or even touch them, but several hikers do.  They don’t seem to mind being touched, actually they pretty much ignore the hikers.  
The rest of the day is spent making my way to Old Orchard Shelter, which is where I find a good tent spot and setup for my last night on the AT, for now.
Tomorrow I have arranged for a shuttle to pick me up at the Hurricane Creek Campground, which will be the stopping point for this year.","Stealth Camp
