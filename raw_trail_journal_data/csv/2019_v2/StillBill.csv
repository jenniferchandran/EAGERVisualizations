After getting a closed avulsion
fracture of my right ankle during last year's hike, I was told that
recovery time would be eight weeks. Well, eight weeks later I
stopped lumping. The true total recovery time was around four months.
I now feel that I'm good to go.","

StillBill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608195,"A couple of things about training for a
hike this year. My weight this year is the same as last year. The
last two years my trail pack weight was 35 pounds, and I am planning for
about the same this year.
Two years ago, I trained with only a 25
pound pack weight, and paid for that the first week of the hike. Last
year I was hiking out at Pearson Park with a pack weight of 38
pounds, and was walking from my apartment on the 15th
floor down to the 1st floor and back up with a 50 pound
pack. 
This year, I have joined Rossford
Community Center and have been in the weight room three days a week,
and using their Jacobs Ladder to train on (not very well I need to
add). Again walking the stairs at the Commodore Perry with increasing
weight. And walking three miles or so either at Pearson Park or
downtown Toledo three or four days a week.","

StillBill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608196,"I am planning on doing this year's hike
with my friend Boo Boo, who I met on the trail two years ago. The
hike plan for 2019 is to start at Amicalola Falls State Park in
George hike the 8.8 miles of the approach trail to the southern
terminus of the AT, then God willing, hike 468.7 miles to Damascus
Virginia, for a total of 477.5 miles. This will take me back to where
I started this hike two years ago. I'm thinking that this hike should
take somewhere around six weeks to carry out.
On March 28, Dave Ziems and I will
leave Toledo Ohio meeting up with Boo Boo at Amicalola Falls State
park. The hike start date is set for Friday March 29th.
Our plan is to start with low mileage
days and increase the miles as we can. Please note that the very
first thing that we will have to do is go up a 604 step staircase to
the top of the falls.","

trail that takes you to Springer Mountain, the southern terminus of
the Appalachian trail (AT). Full disclosure, at the start of the
approach trail, Boo Boo hiked the 604 steps of the staircase to the
top of the falls, I did not. Tented the night at Stover Creek
shelter, 2.8 miles into the AT. 
3/30: Hiked 13 miles on a real nice
trail. About ten miles in we met our first trail Angel, who gave us
each a can of pop. We tented at Gooch Mountain shelter. It rained all
night.","Springer Mountain

StillBill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621869,"3/31: Hiked 10.6 miles. After an all
night rain, the day was cold and very windy. Stopped at Jarrard Gap
to spend the night, but the cold and wind were an issue. We ended up
setting our tents up on an old Forest Service road that was on the
back side of the mountain, that got us out of the wind. This was a
very good decision.","

and today was the first real test for the trail. The climb up 4,457'
Blood Mountain was not as bad as I was thinking it would be. After a
short day to Neel Gap, we stayed at Blood Mountain cabins with
another hiker named Robo Knees for $24 each.","

StillBill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621871,"4/02: Hiked 12.9 miles. I do not recall
anything special about this day. We ended up at Poplar Stamp Gap
where we tented for the night. 
4/3: Hiked 11 miles. The day's hike was
all about going over Rocky Mountain at 4,017'. Coming into Unicoi
Gap, GA a south bound hiker told us that trail angels were just
ahead with free hamburgers. I proclaimed that I would not be eating
one on this day. A couple of minutes later, as we came into the
opening, I was asked if I wanted a hamburger, and I said yes. It was
a hard climb, but the payoff was that our friend Stealth, whom I
hiked about 200 miles with last year, picked us up from the trail at
Tray Mountain for a zero day at his nearby cabin.","
",Tray Mountain ,"Apr 02, Tue",23.90
StillBill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621872,"4/4: / Zero day. Had a great zero day
with Boo Boo and Stealth. We went into the towns of Helen GA. A
tourist town known for its Bavarian-Style buildings, and Cleveland
GA, where we resupplied, and had lunch at Rib Country BBQ. Again,
what a great day.
4/05: Hiked 13.3 miles. It rained most
of the day. The hike was up and down all day. We came back off of
the trail for the night in Hiawassee GA, and stayed at the Holiday
Inn Express.
Story of the Day. Knowing that
it was to rain all day, we decided to stay off trail this night to
get dry. Boo Boo called to make a reservation at the Top of Georgia
Hostel the day before we were to get there, but was told that they do
not take reservations and there would be no issue with us staying
there the night of 4/05. Coming out of the woods at Dicks Creek Gap,
there was a shuttle from the hostel dropping hikers off. As I came up
to the van, the driver told me that only people with a reservation
could get in because the hostel was full. Another hiker told the driver
that he had a reservation and I asked him when did he call for it, he
said that morning. We were not happy people at that moment. We went
over to the side of the road to hitchhike, and no one was stopping.
Maybe 20 minutes later, an old small pickup truck stopped for us and
told us to ride in the back. He had a small step ladder, and a number
of Jesus saves signs already back there, but in we went. This guy was
going down the road at 60-70 MPH with us in the back. Boo Boo told me
she was most concerned that the ladder was going to come lose, and take
her head off. For me, I was thinking that the back tailgate would
not hold, and I would be sent out the back at 70 miles per hour onto
the road. Well, somehow we made it to the hotel, and when we got
out he told us that we needed to pray with him. After that ride, we
both agreed. First he put oil on our forehead making the sign of the
cross, followed by a pray that went much longer then it
should have. Just before I was going to speech up, he ended it by telling us that God loves us.","Stealth's

StillBill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621873,"4/06: Hiked 11.8 miles. Nine miles into
the day's hike, we crossed the Georgia, North Carolina border. The
1,000' climb up to Court house Bald summit at the end of the day was
the big event. The trail went just about straight up. We tented near
Muskrat Creek shelter for the night. 
Story of the Day: The welcome to
North Carolina climb. The first 72 miles of the trail were in
Georgia, and it was for the most part just a warm up for the legs.
The real action was yet to come. As we came up to the border, there
was a creek there and we stopped to get water. At the creek, there
was a young woman there also getting water and the three of us
started talking. At one point, she told us how hard Georgia had been,
and how happy she was that it was over. Per her, now the trail was
going to get easier. Boo Boo and I just looked at each other
disbelieving that anyone would say that. Just over the border, the
tail goes just about straight up with a 1,000' climb up to Court
House Bald summit. We went slow but worked our way to the top. Two
days later, I saw that young woman again and asked her about that
climb, she told me that her legs were still feeling it.","
",NC Border,"Apr 06, Sat",11.80
StillBill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621874,"4/07: Hiked 12.5 miles. This day's hike
was all about going over Standing Indian Mountain with a summit of
5,435'. We tented at Carter Gap shelter for the night. We met a
German hiker today who was about our age named Camp Finder. His life
was all about hiking.
4/08: Hiked 12.1 miles. Another big
climb, this time up and over 5,250' Albert Mountain, which has a fire
tower on the top. It was a good day for a hike until late afternoon
when very heavy rain came in from about 4-7 PM. We spent the night
in our tents at Rock Gap shelter.","
",Albert Mountain,"Apr 07, Sun",24.60
StillBill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621875,"4/09: Hiked 3.8 miles. Our first real
nero day. More heavy rain from 5-7 AM. As planned, we were going to
spend a long day and a good night in Franklin NC. We picked up a free
shuttle that dropped us off on the far side of town at the Comfort
Inn hotel. A week earlier, Stealth had told Boo Boo to make sure that
we went to the Lazy Hiker Brewing Co. in Franklin. I had two nice
beers.
Story of the day: From the start
of this hike until today, there has been a group of 5 or 6 men hiking
the trail about the same mileage per day as us. These guys were known
as the “Flat Earthers”. Each of them carried a 8' spear with
them. Yes, an actual spear.","
",franklin NC,"Apr 09, Tue",3.80
StillBill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621876,"4/10: Hiked 12.3 miles. The trail
inclined 1,300' over the first five miles, which wasn't bad. It was a
good and long hiking day. We ended up tenting at Lick log Gap.
4/11: Hiked 14.2 miles. This day was no
joke, One hard climb after the next, and to top it off, at the end of
the day, the trail went down about 2,500' at a slope that one would
not like. We tented at A. Rufus Morgan shelter for the night.","
",Morgan Shelter,"Apr 10, Wed",26.50
StillBill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621877,"4/12: Hiked 11.4 miles. Today was the
“seven mile up”. Every step you take is higher than the one
before. On the way up, we passed Wade Sutton memorial, which I do
not recall, but I noted it. Stayed at Locust Cove gap in our tents.
For the last week, we have been hiking about the same pace as a
French Canadian women named Frenchie. This would be the last time we
would see her.
4/13: Hiked 10.7 miles. Late in the
morning come 500' “Jacob's Ladder”. I was thinking this was going
to be all stairs, but it was not as bad as we prepared for.
Mid-afternoon, we came to Yellow Creek gap where we were picked up
for a stay at Creekside Paradise bed and breakfast. 
4/14: Zero Day. Went out to lunch,
resupplied, laid around and used the hot tub. Great day.
To make it all the way through the
Smokey's without resupplying would mean for us to carry seven days of
food, neither of us wanted to have anything to do with Gatlinburg TN,
but by going there we would only have to carry four days of food
weight. We agreed to get off at Newfound Gap to resupply, but no
zero's.
4/15: Hiked 7.9 miles. With us near the
Great Smoky Mountains National Park southern border, we were going to
be forced to go long, or go short. Long was just too far, and in this
park, you MUST stay only in the shelter area's. Boo Boo's solution
was to slack pack for the day right up to the visitor center of
Fontana Dam, and stay another night at Creekside Paradise. This plan
was a good one. The morning started out cold, but warmed up nicely.
My backpack,  normally around 35 pounds, was at 8 pounds. At that
weight, the day's hike was a lot of fun.
4/16: Hiked 12.6 miles. The day again
started on the cold side, but ended up sunny and in the 70's. This
day we were going up all day. It wasn't bad, but it was up. Tented at
Mollies Ridge shelter for the night.
4/17: Hiked 12 miles. We stopped for
lunch at Spence Field shelter that had a new privy that is wheelchair ready, but a person in a wheelchair could NEVER get into that
privy, NEVER. What a way to spend our tax dollars. Went over Rock
Top, and Thunderhead mountains. Tented at Derrick Knob shelter for
the night.","
",Seven Mile Up,"Apr 12, Fri",54.60
StillBill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621878,"4/18: Hiked 13.5 miles. Today is a big
day. The climb up and over Clingman's Dome at 6,667' is the highest
point one will be at, on the entire trail. The incline going up was
very nice and easy. All the other hikers that I talked to about this
incline said the same. The trail goes very close to the tourist tower
at the top and of course you need to go up there to get some photos.
At the end of the day, we passed the 200 mile marker for this hike.
We tented at Mt Collins shelter, which was a big half mile off the
trail. Again, you must stay in the shelter area's when in this park.
4/19: Hiked 5.7 miles. Going to bed, we
knew that we were going to wake up in the rain, but our plan had been
to only hike to Newfound Gap, spend one night in Gatlinburg TN
resupplying and drying out from the rain, before being back on the
trail first thing in the morning. Per the plan- There would not be a zero day in Gatlinburg. The rain started at 3 AM, and it rained
sideways for 12 hours. The speed of the wind was off the chart. The
fear of a tree coming down on your tent was real. When morning came,
my tent was literally in water. By this I mean that the inside floor
of my tent had standing water everywhere. When I opened the tent door
and looked out, I could not believe what I was seeing. There were maybe 12-15 tents that I could see, and they were all in the same
“lake” that I was in. It looked to me like Boo Boo's tent was a
couple of inches higher than everyone else. I'm not saying that she
did not pack up wet, but maybe a notch less than me. Most of the 5.7
mile hike to Newfound Gap was in ankle deep water. Upon coming into
the Gap's parking lot, Boo Boo told me that there was a hiker on
the far side and we headed over to him. He only had bad news. He told
us that the park was closed, all roads in the park were closed, a
winter storm warning was posted for that night, and we should expect
4 inches of snow. The Gap's restrooms were open, but the men's was
already full of hikers. We set up shop on the floor of the women's
restroom, and tried to hang some of our things to drip dry. It wasn't
long before floor space in the women's restroom was also full. Most
cell phones did not work, Boo Boo could only text here friend Sarah,
and there was one guy in the other restroom who could get through to
the Ranges. The restrooms were heated, but only at a level to keep
the water pipes from freezing. I was becoming more certain that we
would be sending the night here leaning against the wall. Me sleeping
with Boo Boo on one side, and a women hiker named Phoebe on the
other.","
",Gatlinburg,"Apr 18, Thu",19.20
StillBill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621879,"A hiker from the Men's restroom came
over to tell us that the Rangers were sending up a shuttle to bring hikers down into Gatlinburg. We did not have an ETA, or how many
hikers would fit per load. About an hour later, two long vans from a
local church showed up for us. By the time Boo Boo and I got our
things together and headed out to the vans, we were the last two
hikers looking for a ride. The one van was already full. There was
only one spot left in the other van, and some of the hikers told Boo
Boo to get in. That left just me standing there. The van driver got
out and came around the van, and said to me, “get in”. Whatever
max capacity was, we were way over it. The 12 miles ride was a very
tight fit, and about a mile from Gatlinburg a tree had come down
covering the road in the time the vans were picking us up. The
Rangers came up and cut it up and had it moved off the road in about
a half an hour. Once in town, we checked into the Appy Lodge and got
cleaned up, then headed out for a nice meal at Mellow Mushroom on Bob
O'Donnell's. You see, before I left for this hike, Bob and I got
together for a drink and Bob gave me some money telling me it was for
the time on the hike when I was beaten down and needed a drink. It
would be on him. From Boo Boo and I - Thanks Bob.","
",Gatlinburg,"Apr 19, Fri",0
StillBill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621880,"4/20: Unplanned Zero Day. The Park
Rangers gave notice that the Park and all roads in it would remain closed all this day, and maybe the next which would be Easter Sunday. To start with, I had tried to clean the mud off my tent using the
bathtub, and then hung it to dry overnight. This did not go well,
and Boo Boo through the place looked like a crime scene. We cleaned
it up as best we could, but because we were not planning on staying
more than one night, we did not have a reservation for another night,
and the Appy Lodge was booked up, so we had to move. Sidney James
Mountain Lodge welcomed us in for that Saturday night, and it was
closer to where we would need to be when the trail reopened. Boo Boo
informed me that I was not going to hang my tent in this bathroom.
Ended up, we had a room with a balcony, so we could dry everything we
needed to out on it.
Story of the day. The bus picks
us up in the middle of a puddle for safety. After we had checked into
Appy Lodge hotel, and gotten cleaned up, it was time to head into
downtown Gatlinburg. Gatlinburg has a nice bus system, and we found
it's loops worked very well for us. One of the bus stops was in our
hotel's parking lot. All we had to do was go outside and sit at the
bus stop. A few minutes later, a bus pulled into the lot to pick us
up. It had been raining all day, and right in front of the bus bench,
there was a very large water puddle. I signal for the driver to stop
short of the puddle, but she would not. She stopped in the middle of
the very large puddle. As we came around the bus, I asked the driver
to pull forward a few feet to get out of the middle of this very
large puddle, again, she said no. We had to board the bus with wet
feet due to where she stopped. As we got on the bus, I asked the
driver, what kind of customer service was it to “make” someone
walk through a water puddle to get on the bus. With a smile, she told
me that the bus system had reviewed the spot and decided that was the
best stop for the safety of the customers. The whole ride into
downtown, I sat there disbelieving she told me that with a smile. 
4/21: Hiked 10.3 miles. Easter morning
the Park reopened about 10:30 AM, and our shuttle ran us back up to
Newfound Gap. The ice and wind was very bad at the drop off point,
and I was thinking that we needed to get back into the shuttle, and
try this another day. Boo Boo was very happy to get out of
Gatlinburg, and back on the trail, so off we went. It ended up that
the trail was on the east side of the mountain, so we were out of the
wind the whole day. First up was a 1,000' climb up Mt Kephart. Due
to rain/melting ice and snow, we spent the night in the shelter at
Pecks Corner. This was the only time on this hike that I slept in a
shelter. Boo Boo told me that every guy in the shelter was snoring.
Story of the day: Gatlinburg - A
crime against humanity. This town is ONLY about tourists, as we were
walking around town, Boo Boo turned to me and asked if I noticed that
no one had any bags of things that they had bought.
I told her she was right, and she answered back that the place was
just like a carnival. You spend money, but don't leave with anything.
The overall class of people we saw was low. For the rest of the hike,
most hikers were referring to Gatlinburg as a crime against humanity. I
agree.","
",Gatlinburg,"Apr 20, Sat",22.80
StillBill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621881,"4/22: Hiked 12.5 miles. It was a cold
morning, and the ground was covered in snow. After going over 6,302'
Mt. Guyot the trail “starts” to head down hill. We Tented at
Cosby Knob shelter. Setting our tents up right next to each other, we
were both asleep by 7 PM or so and slept very well all night. In the
morning, another hiker came over to me to say that a large black bear
had checked out our two tents completely about 9 PM that night. Boo Boo
and I had no knowledge of this happening.","
",Mt. Guyot,"Apr 22, Mon",12.50
StillBill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621882,"4/23: Hiked 10.7 miles. After a morning
climb up Mt. Cammerer, it was down hill and out of the north end of
the Smokey's . Just out of the park, we passed this hikes halfway
point and stopped for the night at Standing Bear hostel (Boo Boo
called this place “Barfing Bear”). Everything about this place
told us to move on, but we needed to resupply so we spent the night.
We shared a cabin with another hiker, a south bounder named Dan.
4/24: Hiked 6.9 miles. During the
night, I was not feeling well and I got sick in the morning. With
this, I last my hiking legs, but I told Boo Boo that I did not want
to stay at this hostel any longer than I had to. Coming back on the
trail, the first thing we had to do was climb 2,700' up Snowbird
mountain to it's 4,263' peak. Boo Boo had to just about carry me. I had
promised her days before that we would spend the night a top Max
Patch Summit. We stopped about six miles short of it and tented at
Groundhog Creek shelter. I just could not go on. After getting sick
at dinner, it was off to a very early bed, and 12 hours of sleep. 
4/25: Hiked 13.1 miles. Feeling better,
but I could not eat all day. Let me tell you, Hiking and not eating
is a very bad plan. 6 miles into the hike, we were a top 4,629' Max
Patch Summit. If the Sound of Music was not filmed here, it should
have been. The view is world class. If it was not for some terrible
weather, we could have stayed here a long time. We ended up tenting
at Walnut Mountain shelter.
Story of the day: Boo Boo meets
a friend. Just before we started the climb up to the summit at Max
Patch, we stopped at a dirt road crossing that had a parking lot for
maybe two cars. We were in the true middle of nowhere. I sat down on
a rock and Boo Boo dropped her pack and went across the road looking for
a water source. Just then, a woman pulled into the parking lot and
was looking at me with some uncertainty and was just sitting in her
vehicle. When Boo Boo came back across the road, the women then got
out of her vehicle and started talking to Boo Boo. I came to find out
that the two of them are in the same Bike riding club in Tifton
Georgia. It's a very small world.
4/26: Hiked 13.1 miles. Boo Boo was
sick during the night. We were heading into Hot Springs NC for a
much needed zero. The problem was, Boo Boo was sick and 13.1 miles is
a long way to hike. It rained on and off all day, with a hail storm
coming in the afternoon. We pushed on, she is a true champion for
sure. For the third day I was hiking without eating. Today was a
Friday and upon entering Hot Springs, Boo Boo turned to me and said,
“I'm not leaving this town until Monday”,  that's two zero days.
After checking in at Elmer's SunnyBank Inn, Boo Boo showered and went
to bed for 14 hours of sleep.","

StillBill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621883,"Story of the day: Hot Springs,
after Boo Boo went to bed, I went out for dinner and then down the
street for a short show about Emma Gatewood (the first woman to
thru-hike the AT). Sitting in the second row with Camp Finder, I did
not know that this would be the last time I would see him, and just
the start of my time with the Corey family (Google – A mile in
their shoes) from New Hampshire that were sitting to my left. This
family is made up of a dad, mom, girls ages 13 and 11, and a 8 year
old boy. The whole group was asked that if anyone was thru-hiking
the AT to stand up, they all did. I was sure that they did not
understand the question - they did. We would be running into this
family for the rest of the hike.
4/27: Zero Day. A lazy day, after
breakfast we walked around town and checked out their town trail
festival and then I laid down for a nap and Boo Boo read a book. When
I got up, there was another hiker (south Bounder) named “Too Many”,
on the balcony with Boo Boo. I talked to him for a couple of minutes,
and when I turned to leave, he asked me if I was on youtube because he
knew my voice. I said no and left. A few minutes later I came back to
talk to him again, and told him that last year I was hiking up north
at the same time he was, and we started comparing our hikes. I told
him I ended my hike at Rattle River hostel, and was there from July
6th to July 8th. He came back with a list of hikers by names that
were there when he was, and asked if I knew them, and I said yes,
they were there the same time I was. I asked him if he remembered Vinegar and his answer was no. I asked him about Stealth and he was
pretty sure he remembered him. After about an hour, he came back to
me and said he remembers me for I was the one who went to the
hospital - Correct. Turns out, a year ago when I got back from the
hospital on July 7th, Stealth and Vinegar were not there and I sat
down and talked to “Too Many” for a couple of hours. Again, it's a
very small world.

of miles were a real hard climb. Tented at a campsite on Rich
mountain near a Lookout tower with another hiker named Hugs.
4/30: Hiked 13.9 miles. A great day for
a hike. Early on, Boo Boo pointed out a Bear about 150 yards to our
left. There was no ground cover in these woods, and you could see a
long way. Once that bear saw us, he ran the other way. We tented in
Jones Meadow which was a really nice place to camp.","

was just not a place to stop. We ended up setting our tents just off
the trail in a little opening.
5/04: Hiked 8.7 miles. A somewhat
flatter terrain for today's hike. Coming into Erwin TN for we had a
cabin waiting for us at Cantarroso Farm. Erwin was having their town
festival this day, and we walked the downtown to check it out. When
we were done, we walked about a mile to the Food County to resupply.
On the way, we contacted a shuttle service to pick us up after our
resupply. What a great decision, for when we were done shopping, it
was raining cats and dogs.","

Erwin, it was an all day up, in a all day rain. 12 miles into the day's
hike, we came to a place called Beauty Spot Gap. We had been told
that this would be another great view. Upon getting to this bald, it
was raining sideways coming from our left. With no view to be seen,
we were pushing on, when we heard someone calling “Trail Magic”
from our left. Three trail angels were set up in a parking lot, with
hot-dog's, pop, hot tea, and much more. Boo Boo sat there having some
nice hot tea, with me downing two hot-dogs and a diet coke. The
Corey family was here also. In this weather, standing there was not
all that much fun so we moved on. A mile or so later, we came upon a
Christmas tree in the woods for a little boy who had passed away. A
mile past that, we were at the top of Unaka mountain, a dense spruce
forest and a great place to camp. After we made camp, a number of
other hikers set up their tents there including the family.","

let up all night, and I could hear Boo Boo coughing very badly. The
day's hike was going to be up and down all day. About 3 miles into
the hike, we stopped at Cherry gap shelter for a break, and when we
were leaving, Boo Boo stopped me to say that she had bronchitis and
could not go on and would be leaving the trail 7 miles ahead at a
hostel. About 2 PM we parted ways. This was by far the hardest /
sadist day on the trail. I ended up tenting at Clyde Smith shelter
for the night.","

miles of the day were the hardest, for I was going up and over Roan
mountain at 6,212'. The third highest point on the AT. Anyone with
bronchitis could not do this climb. Tented the night outside a
converted barn called Over Mountain shelter. A young women hiker
named Bruiser camped next to me.","

day's hike, I came out of the woods with an Aussie named Tree Trunk up
to a road called 19E, where I was to meet up with Boo Boo. She was
coming from her sister's house which is about two hours away. I just
sat down on a rock when Boo Boo drove up, talk about timing! We
stayed just down the road at a place called Mountain Harbor Hostel.
After I got cleaned up, we went out for pizza. When we were done with
lunch, we headed over to meet up with Sarah, Boo Boo's other hiking
partner. Sarah showed us the beautiful house she is building, and
then the three of us went out for dinner.","19E

StillBill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621892,"5/9: Hiked 16.7 miles. Today I pasted
the 400 mile mark for this hike. I did a short side trail to Jones
falls, which was really nice. 12.7 miles into the hike, I was planning
on taking a side trail to Upper Laurel Fork hostel for the night,
but could not find the trail so I ended up going another 4 miles to a
campsite where I tented for the night. I was sure of two things, that
I would be at this campsite alone tonight, and that this was bear
country. After I was in my tent for the night, another hiker named
Chris from Monroe MI came into camp and told me two other guys would
also be sending the night. There were no bear issues overnight, and
when I got up, I saw that Bruiser had set up her tent right next to
mine.
5/10: Hiked 8 miles. Short hike day for
a few reasons. 1) I was coming up to Pond Mountain which will be my
last hard climb for this hike and did not wish to go over it late in
the day. 2) If I would go over it later in the day, I would plan on
spending the night at Watauga Lake shelter, which is closed due to
bear activity. 3) Rain is coming. My thinking on this was that I
wanted to wake up and pack up dry. I knew I would be hiking in the
rain, but that would be okay for the rain should stop before I would
set up camp that night. I spent the night at Black Bear Resort, a real
nice place about ¼ of a mile off the trail. Late afternoon, I went back to the front
office and on my way back ran into Bruiser, and we
talked for a while. This would be the last time I would see her.","

StillBill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621893,"5/11: Hiked 17.7 miles. It rained ALL
day. The temperature was in the low 50's which kept me from overheating, and with the rain, there was nothing to do but go forward.
Early on, the trail goes down to Laurel Falls, with the rain it was
just beautiful. The issue was, the white blades stopped when you got
down by the water falls. I forged along the river for maybe half a
mile with no white blades to be seen. As I was coming up to a stone
wall that would stop me, I asked the power that is for help with a
white blase. Just then, I could see one that led me around the stone
wall and back up away from the river. The climb up 3,693' Pond
Mountain was not all that bad, and the top was flat. Coming down went
very well, and I ended the day tenting by Vandeventer Shelter.","

StillBill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621894,"5/12: Hiked 14.4 miles. It rained all
night, and all this day. The trail was nothing but mud. From here to
Damascus VA, the trail somewhat flattens out. I made a stop at
Nick Grindstaff Monument/tomb, It's in the middle of nowhere, but
that was appropriate, for the saying on it said “Lived alone,
suffered alone, died alone”. I spent the night tenting at Double
Springs shelter in the rain.","

StillBill,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621895,"5/13: Hiked 18.2 miles. It rained all
night, and most of today. The trail is nothing but mud and water.
Nothing was going to stop me today, for I was heading into Damascus
VA which is the end point for this hike. 15 miles in, I came to the
Tennessee, Virginia border. After a photo, I moved on. Late
afternoon, I came out of the woods and into the streets of Damascus.
For most of this 500 mile hike, I was thinking that at this time, I
would be singing and dancing. I did neither, I dragged my ass into that
town. I had told Boo Boo that I was going to spend the night at a
cheap hostel but it was at the far end of town, which was too far for
me to walk. The Old Mill Inn is real nice, and more importantly at
the end of town where I was standing. After a shower, laundry, a nice
meal, and a couple of drinks, it was time for a good night sleep.
5/14: Zero day. I met back up with Boo
Boo at our agreed upon place and time. We spent most of the day in
Damascus VA, but spent the night in Abingdon VA where I used to live.
I told her my legs were infected and when I showed her them, she just
said that in the morning after breakfast, I was going to Urgent Care.
I was not in dispute. 
5/15: Zero day. As planned, after
breakfast, off we went to Urgent Care where they did a blood test
(abnormal but acceptable), and they gave me antibiotics (which I
would be on for six weeks). After lunch, Boo Boo and I parted ways
with her, dropping me off at the hotel where I was going to meet up
with Dave Ziems for the drive back to Toledo, OH.
Story of the day. The doctor at
the Urgent Care told me that this was her favorite time of year to
work. I asked her why, and she said because “all you hikers come in
here all busted up, and I get to talk to you”. I replied, “we
only do it for you”.
Story of the day. I'm not sure
which day this happened, but I liked it. In camp, a young hiker asked
the group in general, “how long will pepperoni last”. An older
hiker answered back “longer then you will”.","
