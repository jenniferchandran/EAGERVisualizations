Kelsey Denesha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606925,"So the time is almost here for me to start my AT thru-hike and I couldn't be more pumped. I have wanted to thru-hike the AT for over 10 years and this has turned out to be the opportune year for me. I want to start out by saying that I am not a great writer and I am just writing these entries for my family and friends to be able to keep up with my travels but to be honest, this may be the only post I write. I tend to start things like this with great intentions and then get too caught up in the experience to take time to write about it, which I am cool with. 
About Me and My Trip:
I just wanted to give a little summary of what most people want to know when they meet a person and what people ask about my AT trip. I live in Marshall, NC and work on the farm my husband and I just purchased. I spend most of my time processing timber into firewood, renovating our shed/cabin, and farming. I have wanted to do the AT since I was about 13 after seeing a documentary about the trail. My only other backpacking experience was walking the Camino De Santiago in Spain (about 500 miles) a few years ago. It was a beautiful experience and at the end I wanted to keep walking.
Training:
I am training for my AT trip by doing circuit style workouts 3-4 days a week either at home or at the gym and just my daily working on the farm. I am not going to train by putting in a lot of hiking milage just because of the amount of time that takes and because if you have ever been to Madison County, NC, the line between hiking and walking is blurred. I am actually in the best shape of my life and am not concerned about the physical aspect of the trail. It is going to be extremely hard no matter how you train. 
Pack Weight and Preparation:
In preparation over the years I have read A Walk in the Woods, AWOL on the Appalachian Trail, Tracks, and Walking Through. I have also read a lot on the website Trek this month. Outside of that I have just talked to a few people that attempted to thru-hike it or have completed a thru hike. I also took 3 classes at REI this month: lightweight backpacking, a class on the AT offered by the ATC, and backcountry food storage. 
I have recently finished getting everything for the trip and packing my bag. It weighs 27 lbs base weight and about 32-35 lbs with food and water. I am happy with that because I am literally carrying as little as possible but am not willing to buy lighter gear. I will be carrying a bear vault because I know myself, trying to hang a bear bag from a branch at the end of the day will seem more frustrating than the slight possibility a bear will drag me from my tent and therefore I will not do it. I am planning on carrying 5-7 days of food. The man who owned the farm before my husband and I was a big prepper so he had thousands of dollars of Mountain House food in the basement from the late 70's. It is still excellent and I will be sending it along the way for myself. 
The Plan...it is not written in stone:
My plan is to start the AT April, 4 2019 walking an average of 15 miles per day. I live next to Hot Springs, NC so will take a couple of zero days to go home and see my wonderful husband and home. I have a hiking partner coming to hike with me some time in the beginning of May and she plans to walk with me until Aug. 1st after which I will continue to walk solo. I am estimating it will take me about 5.25 months to finish. I am not the fastest walker nor do I think I will magically be able to hike 20 milers when on my last backpacking trip the most I ever hiked was 19 miles. 
As far as what I plan to do while I am on the trail I have planned approximately 11 mail drops which I even think is a lot but financially it makes since because of all the Mountain House food I inherited. I plan on doing laundry and showering twice a week, sleeping at a hostel once every two weeks. I also plan on taking a zero day once every two weeks. I have no idea how many people normally take but I based my zero days on my last backpacking experience, although those were almost all prompted by illness so who knows.  
Frequently Asked Questions, and the Answers...there is not many but they are asked a lot:
Q: How does Chris (husband) feel about this?
A: He is very supportive. He is a traveling soul himself so he 'gets' it. He wishes he could go with me but he just started a business and is committed to that goal. 
Q: Are you scared??
A: I was but I am not anymore. I use to be very afraid of the dark and scary people but after moving to this remote farm and being out there alone a lot, I am no longer afraid of sleeping in the dark or wilderness. We lived in a tent for 3 months last winter so that is like cake at this point. I am not afraid of animals...except hornets and am just as scared of scary people as any lone female hiker should be, but I am not worried. Trail family is a strong being. 
Q: Why?
A: Uhm...because I want to. Actually a lot of reasons, some simple some more complicated. I like extreme things, this is extreme. I am a goal oriented person, this is a big goal. I love being outdoors and the beautiful moments that come out of extreme struggle. I want to see the landscape, I want to see what my body is capable of, I want to eat pop tarts and pancakes guilt free, etc. It mostly just feels right, like it is what I am supposed to do. 

Hope to post more but if not good luck to everyone else attempting a thru-hike this year and hope to see you out there",,View Entry,"Feb 10, Sun",0

Kelsey Denesha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606939,"So I have been trying to create a budget for my AT trip because I have a tendency to be quite lush without one. I think I am being reasonable but I would love feedback from experienced people on whether this budget is realistic or not. 
Weekly:
2 x $5 for laundry = $10 
2 x $5 for shower = $10 
$40 for eating out 
$60 for groceries 
$15 for hostel stay (one stay every 2 weeks so assuming hostel stays are about $30) 
= $135 per week x 22 weeks = $2,970",,View Entry,"Feb 10, Sun",0
Kelsey Denesha,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610741,"Surprises on the AT: Homesickness, Shelters, and Fanny Packs


Homesickness The AT in many ways is how I expected it would be but some aspects have been surprising. Like the fact that the first night after nearly running the approach trail to the southern AT terminus, Springer Mountain, I cried all night long except for the couple of hours I slept. I was so homesick and wanted to be with my husband and dog so badly that I had convenced myself I was quitting the next day. At one point I almost got up to pack my tent up and start heading down the approach trail so that I could call Chris to take me home the next day. Then I thought more rationally and told myself I would walk to Hot Springs and then get off the trail. But by the next evening Chris had talked me off the ledge and just being able to communicate with him made me feel better. I see why everyone says that you need to have a really good reason for doing the AT that you can focus on in those times you want to quit. But during that first night and second day, I couldn’t think of any reason good enough to be away from my husband, my dog, and my life (which I really love) for 6 months.
But as the days have gone on I have found a strong trail family and have become fully immersed in trail life. And although I am a little rocked by my break in resolve, I am feeling determined and happy to be on the the trail. Shelters The next surprising revelation is that I love staying in shelters. I had heard the rodent stories of shelters and been warned of the smells and noises that 10 bodies can conjure up, but I have found that I can sleep through just about anything in a shelter and I find them cozy. I am also (surprisingly) the earliest riser and get walking before everybody else. That usually means I am the first to get to shelters in the afternoons. This has allowed me to claim my favorite spot which is by a wall. It’s the best spot because you can feel how much you have moved during the night, where as if you are in the middle you could have moved to be nearly laying on your neighbor or worse, you may have 2 people on either side of you crowding your space. I also don’t have to break down a tent in the morning if I stay in a shelter and there is always the perk of being dry on a rainy day (aka everyday).The Fanny Pack Never in my life would I ever have thought that I would wear a fanny pack for its utility. I have thrown mad shade at Fanny packs in the past but not anymore. They are the prestigious snack holder of the AT. People are literally jealous of my fanny pack. One of the perks of getting up early is that I am usually the first one to the shelters in the afternoon or in this case the first to Mountain Crossing Outfitters in Neel Gap. When I got there they had 1 Patagonia Fanny pack left in burgundy, dark blue and bright pink. I now proudly wear that thing every moment of the day and I am never without my money, snacks, knife, chapstick, and phone. 


It’s been fun, strange, and a whirlwind and I am enjoying every minute of it.","
