Biscuit,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623747,"I’m off once again to do some hiking...after working various jobs in Asheville I’ve managed to scrape up a few hundred dollars so that I can try to hike 600 miles from southern Virginia to Springer mountain in Georgia. I’m so very very excited to be “going home” back to the trail. I thru hiked NOBO in 2010 and SOBO in 2015....and it feels like it’s been too long since I’ve spent any real time on the trail.This has been an incredibly difficult year for me...a messy break up with someone I love, fired from a job I enjoyed, evicted from my home...and coming to terms with the fact that I struggle with addiction. So, it’s been a lot. I’ve had amazing support from close friends, including Amy and Sophie who took me in for 10 months, and for that I will always be grateful. The trail has also always been here for me and I’m hopeful that when I finish my hike, however long that will be depending on finances and weather, I will find myself in a better place. Hiking this trail can be brutal at times...really hot and dry, miles without water. Ferociously bitter cold, when you make hot chocolate only to have ice forming inside your mug two minutes later. Relentless bugs of all kinds biting you, or worse getting into your eyes as sweat drips down your face. But the incredible joys ....well, it’s hard to explain. You arrive at the top of a particularly steep mountain and you feel something incredibly powerful inside of you. Relief, probably is the first emotion. Oh thank baby Jesus that’s over! But then a deep sense of pleasure, immense pride washes over you as you look back at what you accomplished. And you realize if you can do this, in the cold, in the rain, in relentless heat...well, then you can do anything. So that’s why I’m hiking. To remind myself that I am strong enough to do anything.",,View Entry,"Sep 29, Sun",0

Today was hard. Harder than I thought it would be, which is silly because the first days on the trail are always hard. We climbed and climbed and climbed. For 3.5 miles. There wasn’t any water. I usually pack only a liter at a time and camel up when it’s not summer...but it was really hot and feels like summer. And there was nowhere, like really nowhere, to get water. For 9.5 miles, just 1 liter of water for the two of us. Then it rained, but not the good kind. Just enough to soak you but not enough to drink. When I saw Roo-dog trying to lick the droplets from the leaves it almost broke my heart. So I gave her the last of our water and had to hope the creek at the shelter wasn’t dry.  It was a hard but glorious day. We made it to the shelter, there was water, and we’re settled in for the night. I’m too tired to make dinner... but still, it’s such an amazing feeling to accomplish a goal and be in the woods and get to do it again tomorrow. And Roo-dog is currently chasing chipmunks so I know she feels the same.","Pearisburg, VA

Day two is generally harder than day 1, between not eating dinner last night and the soreness. My shoulders are quite tender from my pack. Also again there was very little water...but at least today I carried a liter for Roo-dog and a liter for myself, which had to last 12 miles. But then I found a half-liter water bottle just on the side of the trail! We started late, maybe around 11:30 and pushed on past dark in order to make it to a spot with water. I was tired but not cranky but I think Roo was pretty exhausted. I did feed her dinner with tuna maybe 4 miles before we stopped, so I think it gave her the energy she needed to push on. She’s currently completely passed out on her fancy bed sharing my sleeping quilt. I’ve been massaging her muscles throughout the evening. We’re tenting by this lovely creek...when I got water (by headlamp) I saw so many cool looking little tiny catfish, and a crawfish! I’ve known hikers who manage to catch and eat them, but I settled on my noodles :) Guess I’m not quite there yet. 


It was a really lovely day to hike...really warm out, but at least it didn’t rain like yesterday. And the terrain was gentle, rocky in places but very hikeable. Lots of rodedendroms, sweet tiny blue flowers, pine needles, and beautiful gold leaves turning. And...totally unexpected we found a little pond near the end of the day where I got to throw a stick for Roo. Those who know Roo understand how exciting that is!

It’s late, around midnight so I reckon I should call it a night. Tomorrow I get to stop at little country store and get a biscuit, so that’s exciting! (I mean, my trail name is Biscuit after all)","Doc’s knob shelter

I think I almost killed the dog yesterday. Today we were both very sore...had to make it to our resupply which included hitching into town. The hitch in was just fine, only 30 minutes or so before we got a ride. Ha, turns out I was in a car with 3 military/law enforcement men...which anyone who knows me would appreciate the predicament. But alas one can’t be particular about a free ride. 


Roo was very resistant to walking today, even though it was only a six mile day. But three of those miles were on the road where I had to keep pulling her aside when the cars came flying down so it was a bit stressful. In the three miles we hiked we needed to stop three times to rest...it was very, very hot. She just kept sitting down so I would find a shady spot and we would rest for a bit. She’s so good at expressing her needs. One of the stops was under the I-77 overpass, where unfortunately I had to poop. You do what you have to do out here ?. 


So on that note I’ve decided to change the plan a bit... we’re getting a ride back to the car and will try shorter mile days but still be in the woods. Camping, fires, creeks...but with the guarantee of water without having to hike 16-20 miles a day. If there are trail angels out there reading this post, if you’re close to to the trail, leaving a couple gallons of water really makes all the difference!!


My sleep schedule is still a bit wacky....was so tired today that I fell asleep snuggling roo on her bed at 6pm but woke up at midnight and couldn’t fall back asleep. Watched some downloaded tv and finally dozed off around 4am. 


Still, it was a great day to be on the trail. We started hiking around 8:30am and it was magical. Crisp, cool weather with the smell of sweet pine. Absolutely lovely.","
