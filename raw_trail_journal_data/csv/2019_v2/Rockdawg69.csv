Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610874,"I have a chance to drive to Waynesboro, VA on the 24th and hike 3 days to close a 30 mile gap south of Rockfish Gap that I have avoided for 3 years running.  1st year (2016) a hurricane called me home from the Tye River crossing.  2nd year (2017), a stupidity on my part stopped me at Rockfish Gap (forgot to get new tag for my truck which was due 2 days after I got to Waynesboro)  OOPS!    3rd year (2018), I was in a rush to get home after the MD-PA section hike (another stupid move).  Should have stopped.
So now I find myself having to drive from Savannah to Waynesboro (8 to 9 hours) just to tackle this section.  And then home again. At least it is not hurricane season!!!!!!!!
More to come in 2019 as I plan to re-start my hiking at Great Barrington, MA in late May and push for Maine to finish this ""thing"".  At the least I have to get past the White Mountains as I don't want to train for those climbs again.",,View Entry,"Apr 19, Fri",0
Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611076,"Gathered the pack and all the junk that goes in/on it.  Taking the Zimmerbilt for this short trip.  3 days food and hammock gear, plus Packa, extra clothes, cook gear, camera, etc., etc., etc.  Total weight without water was 24.5 pounds.  Add 4 lbs for 2 quarts of water at the start.
Weather is not looking the best at this point.  Thursday and Friday are calling for 50% showers.  It will change again before I get there.  Planning for low 40's at night since I will be above 3000 feet.  Hoping the wind holds off for the few days I will be out.  Rain is usually not an issue for me.  Been there, done that many times.  However,  this is mild weather compared to that the many thru hikers have suffered through this winter and spring. No complaints from me - yet!!!!!",,View Entry,"Apr 21, Sun",0
Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611346,"I have delayed one day on the start thinking I will miss at least one day of rain in VA.  Truck is loaded and ready for 8-9 hour drive tomorrow.  Stanimal's hostel tomorrow night in Waynesboro and hopefully hiking out of Rockfish Gap Friday morning.  Weather is not looking the best on Friday.  Depending on storms, I might have to wait another day to head to the trail..",,View Entry,"Apr 24, Wed",0
Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611477,"9 hours ----- ""on the road again"" (thanks Willie). Normal interstate travel these days. -- delays due to construction. Cost me about an hour of normal travel. But I arrived safe and sound. Staying at Stanimals hostel tonight. Rain started around 1900 and looks like it will hang around tomorrow.
Met a couple of thru hikers staying tonight - Turkish and Bill. Both started in mid March from Springer. Moving at a fast rate to have gotten here in 2 months ( approx). Also met Paul (Maps) who is doing a section hike. He is a little younger than me Nice chat about our previous lives.EDIT:  Hung out at Stanimal's on Friday (26th)  due to storms with high winds and rain.","Home

Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611661,"Excited to finally capture these 30 miles. Stanimals got me to Rockfish Gap at 0845. Off an ""running"" --- Ha! Good trail and fair weather. Met weekend, day , section and thru hikers all along the section today. To many to name, plus there were the crowds heading to Humpback Rocks for the views.
Stopped at Paul Wofle shelter at 1100 for snacks and rest. Scout troop went by as well as a group of family hikers - age 3 to 40ish.
A long afternoon got longer for the last climb out to Humpback Mtn. 1600 feet of switchbacks, rocks, an a dead tired hiker. Not ready for prime time yet! Drug myself over to Humpback Mtn and took an hour to set camp at the base of the main rock pile. Exhausted. Did not eat enough during the day so my energy gave out. First time in a long time I felt this bad at the end of a day. Lesson learned number 95.
Hammock is swinging in the wind in this gap. Now for sleep and NO Bears!","

Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611906,"Today started with that 300 footer over Humpback Mtn that I did not make yesterday. A thrill as it was a slow go. Takes a while to get legs and lungs going in the morning. The trail improved after that with the usual ups and downs. Crossed Blue Ridge Parkway and started 3 to 4 hours of side hill contouring that never seemed to end. One long ridge. Crossed BRP again and started last 2.2 miles to the shelter. First 1/2 miles was sweet, next 1.7 was a butt kicker - straight up. Not good for end of the day. Finally reach Maupin at 1420. A good day even with the twists and turns. A chance to take the time to rest and eat breakfast since the winds were not conducive for cooking when I got up. Double meal later to help with that energy problem from yesterday.
Several folks came and went, mostly section hikers. Two stopped for the night as they had come over the Priest (Mtn) and Three Ridges. A long haul.
In the hammock at 1830 with the wind howling until after 2200. Was a good rocking chair night in the hammock. Tomorrow I tackle the 2200 feet up and over Three Ridges.","0.1 mile N of Humpback Mtn

Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611925,"Really windy and cooler last night. Shaking the tarp and hammock. Got up at 0630 and left at 0730 to fight the battle of Three Ridges - 2200 elevation from my start point. Many 1 to 2 minutes stops for breathing and legs. Two 15 minute stops for food and water. One stop at Hanging Rock overlook for a series of photos looking in valley to E and SE. Finally topped Three Ridges crest at 1005. 2.5 hours for 2.3 miles. Took a long rest for snacks and water before jumping off the mountain. 
Down the south side, 5.3 in 1.75 hours. Met several thru hikers and a couple of groups of section hikers. A pair of section guys traded places with me going down, several times. Rough and rocky for first 2 miles. Good switchbacks for last 2 miles. Reached Harper's a Creek shelter at 1210 and rested for 45 minutes. 
Met a couple about my age, an Old Grad from WP . They are closing a gap up to Snickers Gap that will give them trail completion to North Adams, MA. Talked shop for awhile then trucked on toward Tye River. Reached the end of this section hike at 1425. Shuttle arrived at 1530 and back to Stanimal's hostel for shower, dinner and sleep. Last might be a problem with the crowd of young' so around tonight. Home tomorrow.","

Rockdawg69,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612004,"Adam (Stanimal's owner) picked me up at Tye River at 1530 Monday and got me back to Waynesboro at 1630??)
 A good night with a bath, dinner at Ming Garden, talking with thru hiker Badger and the host Glenn. Left Stanimal's hostel at 0630 for the drive home today. Debated the route with Glenn to avoid that MESS in Charlotte on I-77. Decided to cut off at I-74/I-77 junction and head south thru Winston-Salem, then to I-95 in SC. Made it in 9 hours with 45 minutes for lunch and fuel.
So for another hike with no ""exercise"" beforehand, I did not die. Although I thought Saturday was about as close as I want to come. Beat me up it did, but my fault for not doing the food and water thing I know to do. Old men ""not"" doing stuff!  This 30 mile section closes all the AT from GA to MA - 1500 miles done.
Thanks to all who follow this rambling fool thru the woods and hills. Thanks to Stanimal's for a great stay and shuttle support. Highly recommended for anyone going thru Waynesboro, VA. They do B&B also.Pictures in the photo log give a better view of stuff along the trail for this section.  Cloudy Sunday and Monday made for poor color.
Lastly, thanks to the good Lord for watching over me - again.",,Home,"Apr 30, Tue",0
