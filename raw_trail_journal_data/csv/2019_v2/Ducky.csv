Ducky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620631,"My husband and I decided to take our dogs on a section of the AT as a practice trip as well as get out and do something. It ended up being colder than they were expecting. Once we got to the shelter we tried to make a campfire right away. Due to the wind the fire would not stay lit. We had it going long enough to heat up some dinner but even that was lukewarm at best. We decided to set up our sleeping area on the second floor of the Peters mountain shelter. Not thinking about the fact that the wind would come up from under us. We wore every piece of clothing used every sleeping bag and even used the tarp to try and keep warm. We woke up every hour due to being cold. As soon as the slightest bit of light was in the sky, we decided to make something warm to eat and get out of there. It was not until we got back to Table Rock before we could feel our toes again. We vowed to never hike in December again. lol",,View Entry,"Dec 08, Sat",0
Ducky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621339,First day of my solo hike was rough. I know i'm not used to hiking so my rough may be a drop in the bucket for others. Most of the trail was rocky and up hill. The rocks made it hard to see the trail. Cody started giving up on me halfway threw the day. He would lay down on the trail while we were walking. I gave him some breaks to try and help. Of course this slowed us down. I met a few solo hiker woman as well. That surprised me. I thought I would be one of the very few solo woman hikers. I found out there was a group for solo hiker woman but I could not remember what the name of it was. I decided to sleep in the shelter tonight. I figured it would be easier and faster than setting up and tearing down the hammock. The shelter was two lean to type building's. I met another hiker called Shepard. He told me he was sick with nor virus. I sat at the camp fire ring and we talked for quite a long time. I finally headed off to the other shelter around 7 to make dinner and head off to sleep. Around 11 a group of hikers came in and woke me up. I kept hold of Cody's leash as I did not know how he would react to them. The group stayed rather loud for a good amount of time. i let them know I had my dog as they also had a dog. None of them slept in the shelter I was in. After an hour or so they settled down and I was able to go back to sleep,"Md/Pa Line

Ducky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621566,"Today went much better than yesterday. I arrived at tumbling run shelter by 2:30. I'm not confident in my hiking enough to skip to next shelters yet. Im afraid if I attempt a skip I wont make it to camp in time and have to set up off trail somewhere. not ready to do that yet. Since I had so much time i set up my hammock. No sore hip tonight. Last night my hip started hurting from the hard shelter floor. Even the mat did not help much with that. Plus I didnt sleep well with the loud hikers and Cody waking me up every time he heard someone, and my hip hurting waking me up. I was ready to take a nap but afraid if i did than i would be up all night and end up sleeping to late. 
Today Cody kept up with me for the most part. Funny thing, at the park we hiked threw Cody kept rolling around trying to get the backpack off. But then he would get stuck and and not be able to get up. ran into a couple of thru hikers. One took a photo of Cody and I and said she would email it to me. Park was real nice and the pic-nic table was a nice place to have lunch. 
At camp I met the caretaker, ridge runner, and an AT personnel. The caretaker walks his dog every night threw the camp to check up on it. This camp has everything; a stream to take a ""cold"" water bath lol. clothes line, and toilet paper in the privy. 
Tomorrow I am going to try and leave earlier because it is supposed to be my longest hike day. 6 Miles. Ugg. Hopefully Cody will keep up with me. Hopefully I will keep up with him lol. I gave Cody his Trail name of ""muddy paws"" because he kept walking threw the muddy area's and getting his paws muddy lol.","Deer Lick Shelter

Ducky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621569,"Up and Up and Up. And once I got to the top; guess what was next... You guessed it; Up and Up again. Today was torture. I got lost first thing out of camp. I ended up walking a mile out, than headed back past the camp to water; than back again before finding someone that pointed us in the right direction. I leaned on Chris' text strength a lot during this hike. I had to keep taking breaks for myself and Cody. The hills and rocks were bad, but the rock climbing to the overlook was spectacular. We met some scout while there and Cody kept making friends with whichever one gave him food lol. I kept saying to Chris that I didn't think I would make it. But we did. i think Cody is trying to run away lol. he keeps trying to go with other people when they pass us. Little does he know they are going much faster and longer than we are. 
Last night we could not get to the spring. I was not confident enough to think I could climb over the logs. So I used my cup and filled my water that way. When I got to camp I had to search for the water source. i did not realize this was the one that Chris said was difficult to get to. I did not think it was hard but it was very slow. I found a small area that the water flowed over a rock to fill my cup with. The water was next to a very busy road. 
The ridge runner came to the camp after I got there. I was shocked to see him again. He said he went farther but came back. He cleaned up the campsite a bit. Someone left a huge amount of trash in the fire pits. I gave him a zip lock to put the trash in since he didn't have a bag. I ended up doing an extra two miles due to getting lost. Cody kept trying to stop on the trail slowing us down. 
I could not set up the hammock tonight cause we are on a mountain side. I was not about to set up the hammock and end up rolling down the hill if it fell or I rolled in the tent the wrong way lol. 
I do not look forward to the uphill climb straight out of camp in the morning. Another big day too. 5.6 miles tomorrow.","Tumbling Run Shelter

Ducky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621571,Today I got to camp about 4:30 pm. i would have been here sooner but I got lost just passed Rt. 30 when we had to detour off the AT due to flooding. I called Chris and even he had trouble figuring out what the signs ment. After awhile he finally figured it out and got me back on track. Cody needs to go home but he has to endure at least 4 more miles. First he slowed me down a lot today. The rocks were so bad I had to carry Cody over them in a few area's. But together we made it. After passing the rocks every time I turn around Cody was falling way behind me. I liked it at first because I did not have to worry about him running ahead of me chasing a bear or snake. But then he kept falling farther behind. The path leading into camp was something special. Except for the gnats. I felt like Royalty with all the flowers that had fell off the bushes lining the trail path. But that was nothing compared to the camp. OMG it is awesome. There is two shelters with a pic nic table in the center. The stream was in a little alcove. There were potted plants everywhere as well as garden decorations. There was 3 tent platforms on one side with additional spaces on the other side. I set up my hammock near one of the platforms. Was not to many good tree's to use. Chris' knee is bothering him. I don't think he wants or can do much hiking tomorrow. I was supposed to meet him and we hike to the next shelter together. I am trying to see if maybe he can come to this shelter and I will 0 day it. That way Cody can take a break before sending him home. Still waiting for an answer to that. I'm a bit worried about hiking with bad weather supposed to be hitting. I'm not trying to stop though.,"Rocky Mt. Shelter

Ducky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621572,"Last night many people came into camp and stayed the night. I met one girl named Chili. She set up a tent on the platform next to me. She gave me the trail name ""Ducky"" after I told her about Chris leaving the ducks and how I have been taking pictures with them on the trail. Two other hammockers came in but could not find decent tree's so they set up their hammocks on either end of the porch. They did not want to set up near the privy. Even though it was not that close. Someone else came in with a black lab. She had little pink paw boots on. Maybe that's what Cody needs. This was defiantly the fullest shelter I have seen so far. It was interesting to hear the stories that they told each other and watch how they ""the experienced"" do things. 
Chris agree'd to meet me at Quarry Gap. So Cody and I are going to 0 day it here and wait for him. We watched a few chipmunks scurry around. Lots of butterfly's and a humming bird came in to get some nectar. When Chris got here I had laid on the tent platform next to Cody. Something caught my attention and I looked up to see Chris walking towards us. Chris and I explored the area a little bit and relaxed at the pic nic table most the afternoon.","Quarry Gap Shelter

Ducky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621573,"After a 0 day today was a very emotional roller-coaster. First I reduced my pack to just what I would need for two days when I would meet Chris again. He is going to bring me full chargers and resupply. I also sent Cody home with Chris. After taking longer than expected to shake my pack down, It was a bit sad to leave Chris but at least I will see him again in two days. I hit the trail running. I averaged about 2 miles an hour. I blew passed the shelter and kept going. I wanted to make up for taking a 0 day. I got caught in three rain storms. My ""water proof"" boots are NOT very water proof. So I had wet feet for most the day. Halfway to the next shelter my left knee started hurting. It hurt more when I went down hill. I saw a blue blaze and thought it was the way to the shelter. I lost track of where I was on the print out due to there being more streams than listed. So after walking at least a mile maybe two down the blue blaze with no signal I started getting worried because I was lost, I had no signal, and it was getting dark. I finally decided to turn back around and head back to where i thought the trail was. I got back to the trail and headed toward a large stream. I finally got enough signal to connect my call to Chris. I started panicking when the call kept dropping. Finally I decided to cross the stream and there just passed the stream was the shelter. I felt so relieved but at the same time silly for getting so worked up. I made dinner and set up my mat in the shelter. Was not even going to bother setting up the hammock this time with the rain and being drained from the emotional day. AT was not being nice to me today lol.","Quarry Gap Shelter

Ducky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/623281,"I met Chris at the ice cream shop. I actually beat him there. Unfortunately I could not get a good signal to call him to tell him I was at thee ice cream shop and not the museum. So it took him awhile to find me. After he finally found me we enjoyed a couple hours together. While I resupplied and switched to dry socks and shoes. We went to the museum and reluctantly I had to leave him to go back on the trail. When i got to the end of the park, right away I was lost. The blaze on the right said to go to the right. But when I went that way there was a tree across the trail. So I turned around and went the other way. That blaze said to go straight. But that just kept going along the road. I didn't want to go to far down the road not knowing if it was the right way or not. I finally went back to the gate and tried to look at the map. Finally someone came along that knew where I needed to go. He told me the way with the tree was the right way. And that many have complained about the confusion but they take their good time to fix the trail. He told me to just climb over the tree and I would be back on track. 
I finally got to Peters steeple. I figured out that steeple ment the trail was steep. lol. Got to the top and enjoyed the view. When I headed down i noticed there was a less ""steep"" trail but I didn't want to get lost so i ""stayed on the trail"" Well when I made it to the bottom it came out to a road. I was lost again, and of course no phone signal. I looked at the Guthook map and realized I had to go back up to the steeple and back down again. I knew that by the time I got back on track It would be getting dark. I was ready to give up. I walked the road until i found a ranger to take me back to the IronMasters Mansion. 
When i got to the mansion the caretaker helped me get set up and afterwards i took a warm shower, talked to Chris for a little bit and headed off to bed. The room reminded me of the group home I grew up in.","Quarry Gap Shelter

Ducky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627099,"This morning the caretaker of the Ironmaster's Mansion offered to take me back to the trail so I would not have to walk threw the town again. I would have to wait until everyone was checked out first so I got a little bit of a late start but at least I didn't have to re-walk the town a 3rd. time. I ran into the guy that won the ice cream challenge that I had met at the store the night before. He told me he had been sick all night and was catching a ride to town to get a hotel room till he felt better. 
After about an hour uphill I sat on a rock to take a break. When I noticed my shoes sole was torn almost all the way off. I tried to use duct tape but it was fused together from the heat. I decided to try and go on and went to put my pack on when I noticed the strap was also torn. I called Chris and he offered to bring me shoes and backpack. After walking a bit I felt bad about asking Chris to come out 4 times to help me when he has to work. So I called him and said just pick me up.

Ducky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627386,"Chris and I did a small section of the trail this weekend. At the bottom of the trail head someone had left some trail magic of water bottles. That was an unexpected surprise considering how late in the year it was. 
We started at the parking lot below Clarks fairy and hiked up to the shelter using the boy scout side trail. I think it was a bit steep for a side trail. We also had a few fallen tree's we had to climb over and crawl under. We made a rest stop at one point and I heard leaves rustle. I thought it was a deer and I stopped to focus where it was coming from. As I was trying to find it something caught my eye up in a tree and I looked up just in time to see a black bear scurry down and run away. I think Chris saw it when I said bear. The next day Chris took the side trail down, While i took the longer AT trail. I think it was easier than the boy-scout trail. There was one spot where I had to scurry over some rocks but it wasn't to bad. I also heard leaves rustle again. I waited for about 5 min or so with camera in hand. But no bear or deer. Oh well guess it was for our eyes only. Of course Chris got back before me.","Rt. 22

I got a late start but made it to camp with enough time to set up my hammock, change clothes, and eat some cold Beefaroni. lol. Today is the first time I'm not in a shelter. I'm at a side tent site. It is a bit un-nerving being out here alone after seeing the bear. I also had to scare something away while hiking. It was coming at me in the bushes. I clacked my sticks together and it still came towards me. So I yelled ""HEY"" That worked and seemed to stop it, so I continued walking before it moved again.

I don't know yet because it does give me the perfect time to think and clear my head while enjoying nature. I was supposed to do 13 miles today. By 7 pm. I got paranoid so I stopped on the side of the trail and set up camp. I only did about 11 miles. :(. I'm going to try and get up a little earlier tomorrow to make up the extra 2 miles.

Ducky,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/627394,The beever dam was interesting. I brought water proof socks and at one point the water almost went over them. Many of the streams were dried up. I almost ran out of water. I ran into another hiker and we started talking at the parking lot. I ended up staying there longer than I should have. So I ended up heading out later than I ment to. A storm started rolling in and I was getting paranoid about it. It started raining on and off and was getting dark faster. I tried to beat the storm but could not find the campsite or any suitable place to set up camp. I ended up falling and hurting myself again. At this point I called Chris crying and looking for strength but instead I convinced myself I had to give up again. So Chris came to get me.,"Rausch Gap Shelter

I started back at 81 and found out if I just hung in there a few feet, I would have found the campsite I was trying to get to before. I figured out that I am my own downfall. If I don't let my mind run away with me I can make it. Today, not only did I meet my destination I passed it. I rushed the last 3 miles and fell, but I got to the shelter with enough time to set up my hammock, have dinner, and enjoy the forest. My knee hurts from falling but that's ok.

Even though I got to the 501 shelter early I decided to stay awhile and see how my knee felt. After awhile I decided to just stay at the shelter and 0 the rest of the day. I figured this way it would give my knee a break and maybe I could continue on and maybe even do a day and half tomorrow. 
I attempted a shower in the solar shower but with it being in the tree's it was not very warm. I did manage to wash my hair and at least do a sponge bath of sorts. I sat in the shelter, washed my clothes a little better than I could on the trail. Looked threw the log book, and sat on the steps enjoying the nature.

After i set up my hammock I got a weather alert for  thunder storms and flash flooding.. The campsite I was at already had some ponds of water, I'm guessing from a previous storm. I called Chris, concerned about the site being so close to the waterfall during a thunder storm with flash flood alerts and water already on the campsite. After half an hour we decided that I would go home, rest my knee, try to fix my shoes, and resupply. Some local hikers went past me and offered to carry my pack. i declined.

He wasn't to please about almost getting pee'd on. lol. When I got to a clearing off the hill above the railroad tracks I got a little turned around and almost started walking on another trail.

I'm not so sure I could have done the rock climb for my first major hike as well as increased miles with a bad knee.

He set the alarm for an hour earlier. When the alarm went off I said NO! One more hour! lol. At that point Chris forgot to reset his alarm. That's ok. We were setting to do 16 miles today but decided to enjoy the hike and do whatever we could get done. After 8 miles Chris couldn't go on anymore so I did another 3.6 miles to the shelter alone.

We didn't get much sleep because of the last minute packing and leaving extra early to get a good start. We really didn't condition ourselves which was a mistake. Both of us and both dogs were hurting. So we decided to stop and take a nap and see how we felt. When we finally got to camp I had a migraine as well as dizzy spells and hurting.

The rocks were slippery from rain and moss. I guess with not as many hikers the moss built up. I nearly fell a total of 6 times. And slid twice twisting my ankle. Not bad though. I did not think I was going to make it to camp before dark. I kept getting paranoid that I was going to be hiking in the dark by myself on my first day back. Chris and Kayla helped me get out of my head by cheering me on with texts, and posts. That helped so much. I made it to the raven rock shelter just before sunset. I got to stop letting myself get worked up by my thoughts running away. Tomorrow is calling for storms. So I think I will be taking it slow most the day. We'll see.

Other campers were loud, snoring, air mattress' squeaking, and my mattress was not filled all the way up so It was very uncomfortable. Then at 4am someone woke up and loudly packed. At first I had trouble finding the water spot. I could hear it running under a rock but no way to get to it. When I finally found where it came out from under the rock I realized that I was nearly out of water again. Looks like this year is going to be tough to keep enough water in me. After filling up from the trickle and walking on I found that the trickle opened up to a bigger stream. So big some hikers were taking a break and playing in it. At one point I kept hearing thunder but had no signal to look up the weather. So I called chris who looked it up on his computer at home. As soon as he says ""I don't think it will hit you, I think it will skirt under you"" The sky opened up and it poured. So hard that my poncho did little to keep me dry. So I found a huge rock and hunkered down. i draped the poncho over me to try and keep myself and cody dry. Cody stayed dry... Not me lol. When the rain finally let up and we continued on, we found the rocks to be even more slippery than before. At a large rock wall I ran into an older gentleman and he almost fell on the rocks. I grabbed his arm and stabilized him. When he said he was good, I continued on. Hope he makes it down the rocks. They were pretty steep going up, and dangerous going down for him. I met Chris at camp. He brought me some trail magic. Pineapple, and chips. We set up our hammocks. washed up a bit, made dinner and relaxed until we turned in for the night. Another storm is supposed to come threw so hopefully we will stay dry under our rain tarp.

We left anything we didn't need for the day in the car which chris had parked 1/4 mile near camp. To bad all the camping spots aren't close to parking lol. After we unloaded our gear we took off. At the beginning of the trail for the day we ran into an elderly couple who thought they were going to hike 5 miles up and 5 miles back with just a small 16oz bottle of water for the both of them. We were worried about them until we saw them coming back. They decided they weren't going to make it with such little bit of water and they turned around. At one rocky spot of the trail I heard a snake hiss. I stopped and looked around but saw nothing. so we went on.

I had enough water to last the night so I decided to fill up in the AM. I sat around the camp and enjoyed the animals and nature. I explored around a little bit and found what looked like a bear box. It had privy items in it like pine shavings and shovels. I decided to use it as a bear box anyway. Just had to put a carabiner on the box. No one else showed up so I turned in early. In the AM I got packed up and started heading out but realized that I needed to fill my water up so i unpacked it and headed down to the water.

We got to the car at 4:30pm and headed to Walmart to get a screen protector for my phone cause I dropped it and busted mine. On our way we saw a turkey and then a bear. A BEAR! He was only about 10ft. from us. He was sitting in the grass eating some grass or something. He turned around and looked at me and went back to what he was eating. It must have been good lol. What and exciting day. Tonight were sleeping in the truck because it's still a little to cold.,"Hawssbill Parking Lot
