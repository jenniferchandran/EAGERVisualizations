Sleprock61,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606148,"This is my first officially logged warm up hike for the AT 2019 through hike. 
I have been sick with a head cold since Dec. 17.  So I took time off from the elliptical in the living room and from hiking outside.  And as I am retiring soon I just relaxed through those last 13 days and took it easy to just get over this silly cold.  Christmas has come and gone peacefully.  Now its time to get out and there is no better place to start than Darby Creek park.  It's my old familiar territory with standard trails and mileage.   I  started out from the car in the Nature Center parking lot at 08:57 AM.  It was 28 degrees on my car thermometer. It was cold and I felt it. I had on me brand new REI zip off pants.  My feet were well taken care of.  I wore Injinji toe liners socks under Bass Pro Shop heavy wool socks.  These socks have a lifetime warranty.  I see a lot of bloggers  that swear by the Darn Tuff socks, also with lifetime warranty.  But I already own 10 pairs of the BPS socks.  I have this thick sock inventory from when I was on my feet on concrete a lot. I like these extra thick socks and I am going with them. Why not?  They are already paid for!  I am not 100% sold of the Injinji socks, but I now have 2 pairs of the liner socks to rotate daily with the thick ones on the through hike.  I wore my fairly new Vasque Inhaler boots.  These are very light and ankle height.  I noted near the end of this walk that my feet were great, and not even close to being cold.  My feet were completely dry.  The thick and the liners worked great together.  But the Darby trail is a very easy well maintained compacted gravel trail.   Let's see how it goes on more difficult terrain.  I wore a light polyester t-shirt and a thin long sleeve polyester shirt topped off with an old tried and true friend, my blue long sleeve medium weight fleece sweater. On my head I had on a buff that I had made into a full beanie.  I could feel the cold and the breeze but I knew I would warm up. I was wearing neoprene cycling wind gloves. But I left my trekking poles strapped to the side of my pack.  I went from the nature center lot and the bison were right there on the right side of the trail. Not far from the bison, I saw three women jogging towards me. They were three wide and I was moving to get to my right to stay out of their way.  As they passed I thought I heard a muffled ""Hi Ron"" that didn't really register until after I heard a louder ""Sleppy!"" I turned to see a now former co-worker from EGA, Kristine.  She was turned back in my direction with a beaming smile, still in time with her running partners ""Oh... HEY!""  I said. It was nice seeing her.  I assumed she knew I was out hiking some miles warming up for the AT.  But no time to talk today, and then we went on our trails.  I walked through the easy flat section through the ranger station area, down to creek level, and under Alkire Rd. I did the terrace loop with the left fork and around to the Ancient trail. I snacked on some Stinger cherry cola flavored energy chews and a Clif Nut Butter bar on the first half.  There is a bench about two thirds of the way around Ancient trail. I put my on rain jacket while on the bench to block the slight breeze.  I stopped to make Ramen noodles and a cup of coffee. This took about 40 minutes to set up, cook, eat, and clean up.  I opened a Stinger caramel honey waffle as I left the bench and ate it in a few minutes.  I felt very energetic and cruised along the trail easily. From this point there is about 2/3 of the hike.  I finished up strong and feeling good at 12:59.  I never really over heated with that clothing set up, but I was never really cold either.

Sleprock61,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607135,"I signed in as a section hiker at the visitors center.  The falls are definitely a sight to see. The steps weren't that bad. The total elevation gain was about 2000 feet up. The falls section is about 500 of that.  I was thinking about hiking to Stover Creek shelter once I got on top. But it was 4:30 by the time I got to Springer and I was not feeling the energy to push to Stover. I set up my new tent for the second time ever The first was in my yard on  a 20 degree night. This was the first AT set up and it went OK. There was another thru hiker who stayed in the shelter. His name was John, no trail name yet. He was from Brandenton FL. He took off ahead of me in the morning and I never saw him again. It rained a little overnight but no tent leaks. I kept two door flaps open. The breeze through was amazing. It got down to low 30s. But I was laying there just grinning about my equipment choices. There wasn't much condensation inside. I wiped things down with a bandana no problem.  The approach trail is optional, although I walked 8.8 on the approach and then 0.2 to the shelter it only counts as 0.2 of AT miles. I am sure there will many more off trail miles. weather: partly sunny it got up in the 50sfeet: goodbody: goodconfidence level: optimisticwildlife report: there is not much out in Feb except for a few birds.  I saw a Pileated woodpecker(s?) go from left to right a couple times and a few finches, I think.  Shortly after seeing the big woodpecker I heard the loudest pecking I have ever heard in my life.  It must have been a very big, very strong bird,and a very big hollow tree, and probably not that far away.  It rattled the air like a machine gun.  DaDaDaDa..DaDA!DAAA!! I was walking along trying to think about how to describe that loud hollow sound. Besides a machine gun it reminded me of when you stuff the biggest Ruffles chip you can fit in your mouth and crunch down in one big chomp. OK maybe the machine works better. gear: REI pants with legs zipped on. Poly t-shirt and poly long sleeve t-shirtI am wearing my old Outdoor Research blue gaiters. I started sweating like crazy so I put my map buff on as a headband and that worked great to keep the sweat out of my eyes.  I can't remember the last time I had a sweatband on.  I might have been in the racquetball days in the 80s.  But it worked so well I will continue for sure.","Amacalola falls state park visitors center

Sleprock61,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607136,"I got up at 6:30 after a decent night's sleep.  But it took me to 9:00 to get all done and moving. As I started down the trail I felt that my legs were kinda tight. So I went the couple miles to Stover Creek shelter.  I pulled in and there was a thru hiker tearing down his hammock. I found out his name is Poptart. I have heard him mentioned on the YouTube vlogs I have been watching. He is a veteran and a cancer survivor and he is a hiking machine. He attempted the AT in 2017. He had an outside reason for not finishing. He went all the way in 2018. His buddy was with him for most of it but the buddy had get off trail for some personal reason.  They met back up somewhere and finished. But the buddy missed I think he said 6 or 7 hundred miles. Poptart must almost constantly be hiking. He shared how he had been on tge Florida trail and switched over to the AT. The buddy called this year asking about picking those miles he had missed. Poptart agreed but he started all the way at the approach trail and was going to join up with buddy in Virginia to pick up those missed miles. And Poptart plans to finish AT by May because he plans to the PCT this year also. That's over 5000 miles in a year. So I am feeling like I need to pick up the step a little compared to Poptart. He also mentioned a quote, but I dont remember who said it.  ""Cover the earth before the earth covers you""  .... you go Poptart, veteran, cancer survivor, and hiking machine. 
I only encountered one other person on the way to Hawk Mtn shelter. It was a young (25?) hiker named Nick. I came up on him and we chatted then he moved down the trail at a good pace. He stayed to himself and set up his tent and stayed away from the shelter chit chat with the rest of us. After meeting Poptart the super hiker in the morning I met Toothless and Snowflake at the shelter. I would have swore they were a couple by the way she bossed him around.  But they say they just met on the trail.  It took them 4 days to get from Springer to Hawk. I had done this in about 8 hours at a pretty easy pace. There was another guy named Crash who I found out later was on his 4th AT hike.  Another younger guy, Homeward Bound came in last. HB for short. HB was quite an accomplished young man. Thru hiked at age 18, has a Great Lakes pilots license for those big ships.
 I set up the same as before with 2 flaps open. And it worked wonderfully. We had a little light rain no problem.  I got up in the morning and tore down and made breakfast. I let Toothless and Snowflake have a couple extra granola bars. The next water spot was 6.6 miles away and Snowflake showed great concern about stretching out that far when they had been averaging 2. I left them and headed to Gooch Gap shelter.  weather: very decent day hikingfeet: goodbody: goodconfidence level: optimisticwildlife report: there are a few dog prints on the trail mixed in with the Vibram soles.  But I saw one paw print that stood out from the dog tracks. I was sure at the time it was a left front black bear print and I checked it out later at the Helen library and it is confirmed. I looked around and so no other prints like that one.  gear: same as before Pants T shirt, long sleeve T shirt","Springer Mtn shelter

Sleprock61,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607137,"Hawk Mtn to Gooch has a couple thousand feet of elevation ups and downs. But it was short miles so I took my time. I developed a tiny hot spot on my right heel. But I let it go. My right knee starts out in the morning with no problem but it gets a little achy as the miles go by. Not pain just a little ache. It still feels strong.  I ran up on HB sitting by a creek getting water and apparently resting. He took off as I sat and stayed by myself until Gooch. So it was me Crash from NH,  HB local GA, and Nick at Gooch. HB has a wood fired stove for heating his water for dinner. He also lit the campfires both nights we stayed together. I set up camp the same. Crash was on his 4th thru hike. 1999 with his son. 2009 for his 10 year anniversary 2016 just because and now his 20th anniversary.  He has a lot of experience and knows a lot of ins and outs. I decided to follow his lead and go to Bearfoot Hills hostel at Woody gap. Nick is from Long Island NY. I think Indian decent. Very inexperienced hiker.","Hawk Mtn shelter

Sleprock61,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607172,"Did a quick 5 miles down to Woody Gap by 12:30. 
There was no sign of Nick after camp.  Crash went out first. I left camp before HB but he passed me.  He said look for a big white Ford with blue wheels at Woody Gap. His mom had driven his truck up to get us.  He drove to Bearfoot hills hostel.   HB and I went in to find crash eating a DeJourno pizza and a Coke.  I checked in.  It is $25 for a bunk and another $5 they do your laundry for you.  We had a beer together while mom waiting on the truck. They had about a dozen beers to choose from.  I liked the Hop Dang Diggity Southern IPA from Jeykll Brewing in Alphretta GA.  The best part about it was a super big hoppy piney floral aroma that was followed by a big hoppy flavor.  Just what a hungry thirsty hiking hophead like me was looking for.  The bunk room was nicer than I expected. Crash said this is a boutique or B&B style hiker hostel.  Most of them are not this nice.  For the evening I tried to stay out of Crash's way.  He went in the bunk house and I stayed out on the porch a lot.  He had the heat cranked up to 75.  But he got it down to 65 by the time it got to be dark.  
report: all the same no big deal. 
Wildlife report: I saw a few centipedes and one snail on the trail and a very few birds.","Gooch Gap shelter

Sleprock61,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607173,"We turned the light out in the bunk house about 7:30. Crash were in bottom bunks in opposite corners. This reminded me of the last time I slept in a bunk was in the Army.   I was worried about snoring and bothering him. But I slept pretty good even considering I was on a twin size mattress on wooden slats. Laura at the Bearfoot put out a nice breakfast, cereal, boiled eggs, yogurt, fruit, milk juice and coffee.   As we were eating HB texted and said he was on the way and he was bringing Chic Filet biscuits. So I saved a little room for one of those. The hike was a little tough. I had called The Further Shuttle from the hostel and arranged a ride back to my car at Amacalola falls between 4 and 5.   Donald on the phone said take my time, when you get there is fine.  We left Woody Gap at 9:00.The terrain that day was to get up and over Blood Mtn (+1500') then downhill to Neels Gap (-800') in 10.7 miles. I paced myself really enjoying being out there.  The scenery was pretty much constant all day and it was supposed to get up in to the 60s. I changed up my hill climbing technique listening to Crash. I was doing a rest step before, where I would push until I was breathing very hard then stopping for a step, or two, or three, then move up. stop, move. Now as I am moving along uphill, as I feel my heart rate and breathing increase, I slow the pace down to keep from getting winded.  I just keep moving even if only tip toeing baby steps. I like this style better.  I will continue.  I made it up on Blood Mt as it was going on 4:00.  I called Donald and he said take your time.  The views were pretty spectacular from up there especially as I started to descend. The trail brings you out to a rocky point that gives you a very wide view.  I passed a guy coming up as I started down in the trees.  White regular men's haircut, black Nike shirt, black shorts, and a black headband. I found later he was Tommy.  He caught up as I was heading down form the top.  He said this was his 526th time up on Blood Mtn. I said I was impressed with how he was able to keep track of that many. He had estimated the first 150 but has a log since.  He was a pretty fit 66 year old. We talked as he led the way through the rocks.  He talked about an epic near death experience on Mt. Washington in winter.  He was trotting and hopping and skipping around the rocks and he would hesitate his steps as he continued the story as I followed my way down.  Following his lead I felt like I was moving down better than ever, but I would not classify it anything close to trotting, hopping or skipping.  Mary the shuttle driver was waiting on me at Neels gap. I talked to HB and Crash, a little.   And who else did I see but Toothless and Snowflake pull up riding in a pick up. They had hooked up with another hiker who was going off trail to rest his knee.  He had the truck at Woody Gap.  I was glad to see they were actually making some trial miles. I dumped out the rest of my food for them to take since I was going home. They were very appreciative and graciously accepted. 
Mary took me back to my car to start heading back to Columbus  I drove up to I75 and stopped in Athens TN at an Applebees and crashed at a Days Inn. I was home by 2:00 on Friday.","Woody Gap

Sleprock61,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607065,I did the 40 miles in 5 pretty easy days as planned.I got advice from Homeward Bound and Crash not to wait until mid March to start my hike. I went home for a week. Brenda brought me down and we spent the night at the lodge at Amacalola falls for Valentine's Day dinner. I registered at the visitors center as a through hiker. And she dropped me off where I left off at Neels Gap to start my big hike from Georgia to Maine Sept 15.,"

Sleprock61,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608120,"I am consolidating groups of days to help speed up this journal update time. Hiking days #6, 7, 8. #6 I stayed at Whitley Gap shelter alone.  The shelter is 1.2 miles off the trail downhill.  Which is why I was alone.  But it was a pretty damp night and I was thinking I would be happy to have at least 3 walls around me.  But I slept under my umbrella back in one corner.  There was a heavy fog being blown in the front of the shelter by some moderately heavy winds. My down quilt was damp some but not really wet. #7 I made a wrong turn out of camp and went 1.2 miles out of the way. (1.2 for the shelter trail back to the AT + 0.6 down and 0.6 back up) 2.4 extra miles on top of 12.1 to the next shelter. Hiked to Blue Mtn Shelter.  Met a group of about 8 hikers from an Atlanta hiking club.  I refer to them as the young professionals, like the HYP (Honda Young Professionals) at (former) work.  They all seemed educated and mostly experienced hikers with good attitudes, much like the EGA ones too. I came into the shelter area after 4.  The YPs were all in tents. Plus there were a few more tents up and 3 people in the shelter. Skinner and his wife JuJu and another guy. It rained hard at night. I called The Further Shuttle for a ride the next day from camp. #8  Hiked down to Unicoi Gap. Mary picked me up and took me to the Riverbend Motel in Helen. It was only $49 a night for a hiker rate and the room was more than adequate.  They had cereal and danishes for breakfast and it was 2 blocks to the main strip.  I stayed in Helen for 3 nights. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday.  I was still broke out from a rash mostly around my mid section that the OTC hydra-cortisone was not suppressing.  I called my doc and it took a couple days to get it sent to that small town pharmacy. Highlights of Helen, GASunday I hit the Old Bavaria Inn first because it was the closest to the motel.  They have an outstanding selection of German biers. I snacked around at a few places without sitting down for a real dinner. I ended up at The Heidelberg where the lady talked me into buying a ticket to see an accordion player named Alex Meixnor.  It was an accordion act unlike any I had ever seen, that is for sure. Like the German restaurants in Columbus he played the Um Pah Pah that I expect. But he had a back up band with guitar, drums, and a guy on winds; clarinet, sax, and horn.  I was thoroughly entertained.   About halfway through he asked for requests.  Everyone else hesitated, raised my hand.  ""Pride and Joy by Stevie Ray Vaughn"", I said. Wanting to hear him do SRV on the accordion.  He asked the guitar player.  ""Do you think we can handle that?""  He kinda nodded.  They ripped it up.   But it was mostly guitar, and it was mostly a fine bluesy guitar tribute.   The accordion took over the lead for the last verse.  It was awesome.","Neels Gap
