I’ll head to REI in the morning to do some last minute shopping and catch the shuttle to Springer Mountain to start the journey. Next few days will be packing and finalizing the gear. Weighing in at 33 lbs - bit heavier than I want but I have some extra food and nonessential items that I may leave behind or swap out. I’ll include a gear list one I’m done",,View Entry,"Apr 10, Wed",0

I had thought about doing the hike without a stove, guess I’ll try that out now. Don’t need to cook much of the food I have so not a huge issue....yet.... pack is heavier than I like, but I have too much food, which I’ll eat thru, and already have some things that I think I can ahead along the way - like a stove for instance.Hike today was great. Averaged a little over 2 miles an hour which is where I want to be right now. Weighed the pack again up to 40 lbs now, but will get that down over the next few days and only have to do a small re-supply in Neel Gap about 23 miles from here Shuttle driver was a wealth of knowledge. He’s going to be working as a ridge runner south of Harpers Ferry this summer so I’ll look him up when I get there.Predicting heavy storms tonight.

Was the last one to leave camp this morning- wanted the rain to die down a bit. Regardless it was a wet day today. Rain gear worked well but the trail was really a stream.

Started early today -too cold to do anything else, and my great view from last night was gone. Not many people on the trail in the morning. I was going to stay the the Blood mountain shelter, but it was snowy and cold, and I only had a few dry clothes left. I figured it would be better to keep going to Neel’s Gap and dry things out/ see what I need for re-supply. Met a few thru hikers on the way down the mountain. Most were planning to get a room vs continuing on up the other side of the gap. I chose to get a cabin vs the hostel. I haven’t slept well the last 2 night, cabin seemed like a better option for sleep.Whitley Gap shelter is my next stop tomorrow see how I feel if I want to go farther","Big Cedar Mountain

I picked up some chocolate donuts and a water bottle in the hiker box. I looked for a stove, but nothing was there. Oh well. Making it out of Neel’s gap wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be. Great viewing spots on the trail down. Meet several day hikers out for the view. Cow pens lived up to their name,. I had my first trail magic experience. Several women were handing out candy and oranges. Gave me the extra energy to get through that section. Many thanks to them!!I was originally going to stop at low gap shelter, but it looked like there were several people already there, and about a dozen people that I figured would be showing up later in the afternoon. The cold/rainy weather created a log jam at Neels Gap and was hoping to get ahead of it. Hoping for another good day tomorrow 15 miles will put me at Deep Gap shelter.

No sugar coating this - The ups and  downs kicked my butt!! If I walked 1 mile today on flat ground I would be overstating things. A couple of good views. Tomorrow is a little better, but I have to think re-supply. I don’t need much but there’s a long stretch coming up that only crosses dirt roads and not near many towns. Don’t think I’ll make it to the NC border tomorrow I never made it to Deep Gap Shelter either by the way. I made it as far as Addis Gap..Thanks Dave and Dave!!  it’s about 2 miles away, from Deep Gap but there’s a 700 foot climb up and an equally painful 600 foot decline.

Hot shower, bunk, shuttle to the trail and into town was all included. Enjoying the sunset now!NC border is about 10 miles away. It will be a tuff day. Suppose to be in the 80’s and lots of uphill. One of the guys here just checked out for an ACL issue with his knee. Hyper paranoid now.Sort of funny story. Had a dream I woke up and started my hike going the wrong direction. Didn’t realize it till I got to the start point and saw the driver who dropped me off. That wasn’t the funny part. Funny part was when I was hiking and meet a guy on the trail. We started talking and he said he was going to Muskrat Creek. I must have gave him a look cause he realized he was hiking in the wrong direction. Fortunately it was less than 1/4 of a mile so not a big distance.Goal tomorrow is to get to the boarder before 1:30 then I will have meet my initial goals and make some new ones.Also need to get my pack weight down.

Continued hiking to the next shelter, 1st one in NC. Big climb coming in - NC way of saying “Welcome”. Ran out of water on the way up so was happy to finally get to the shelter. Twisted my knee on the way up. Hurts a bit, have to watch that tomorrow.Place was almost empty when I arrived except for 2 section hikers, Dave and Dave who left, bad Frodo ( he lost his wedding ring), and Alice. I was going to stay in the shelter, but there were some nice tent spots and no rain was forecast. Probably one of the best decisions I made this trip. There must have been 15 more people who strolled into the shelter after I settled in. One of them was a serious snorer. Woke me up and I was over 150 yards away from the shelter.

To summarize - put seven or so strangers together sleeping shoulder to shoulder.... and then throw in a couple of mice and a nice thunderstorm to make things interesting. Sounds horrible -  subs reality TV???, but it actually wasn’t too bad. It was a good decision with the storms last night (cold is bad wet is bad, cold and wet is just horrible). Plus you have to sleep in the shelters in the smokies which are coming up pretty fast. Hiked up the fire tower on Albert Mountain. The clouds from the storm just moved out so had some good views. Windy and cold though. Didn’t stay long, still had 5.5 miles to hike in 3 hours to catch the shuttle in to town. Suppose to get down to 35 tonight. Would rather not freeze, plus need to resupply a couple of things.Next stop will be the NOC in about 30 miles where I have to get a pass to hike in the Smokies.Met up with a couple of other folks from day one. We are all sharing 2 hotel rooms. Only Kurt and I plan to go out on the trail tomorrow. The others are going to take a “zero day” and stay in town. I’m sure we’ll all meet up again at some point on the trail.Learned a tip today on how to get a good weather forecasts for where I’m going -.atweather. Org has a forecast for every shelter site on the trail. Just have to type the trail, state, and it lists each shelter in order. It’s pretty neat.Passed the 100 mile mark. This is now the longest hike I’ve taken ever. Body is holding up, but everything still hurts. Knee feels better today. Stiff, but no shooting pain.  As soon as I get my blisters and shoulder worked out I should be able to increase my mileage - maybe in a couple of days.","Carter Gap Shelter

Met Rain and her owner waiting for the shuttle. They are hiking all over the US. Also sawTim and Kurt waiting for the shuttle. Everyone else is staying in town. I would love to but it’s too nice of a day to hike.  Shuttle driver made 2 stops. We were the 2nd stop and there was an extra hiking pole in the van. I figured it was Rains so I took it hoping I would catch up with them at some point. Hiked 3 miles and Tadah trail magic. Kendal drove 3 hours from Atlanta to give us all kinds of food and drinks. It takes a special person to be a trail angel and do this.Found Rain and her owner sleeping in a field at about mile 11 of the hike. He did leave the hiking pole in the van and was happy to see it. I was kinda’ getting use to it.Final climb to the campsite was a bugger. Ended up camping and eating with Sarah ( she didn’t go to town), and a couple of section hikers. They were real nice. He has hiked several miles on the trail and had some good information. You really do meet some great people out hiking.

It was good to get up and moving to keep warm. Knee and feet were hurting this morning. 1st stop was Wayah Bald tower. Great views of the valley, and some good examples of how they are restoring the forest. Some big down hills and was feeling it in my knee. I look up , and there wrapped around the tree is a knee brace. I am not kidding. And yes I put it on. Definitely helped.The rest of the day was filled with stops to soak up the incredible views. Rocky Bald. Side trail. Finally got a signal so made some calls sitting on the bald. Then had what seemed like a never ending climb up to Wesser Bald and the observation tower. Incredible views of the mountains in every direction. Nothing but mountains and forest for miles. Climb down to the shelter was quick. Now with a new group of people. 2 guys from Huntsville with an interesting story, and several folks from outside the US. A bunch of folks were down at the shelter too, but I didn’t meet them.

Printed my permit to hike in the Smokies. Soaked my feat in the river (NOC is pretty amazing. If your ever in the area I would suggest checking it out), but resupply became a problem. They have a great selection of dried meals, but not much in the way of cook less food. Problem is Fontana Dam may not be much better for resupply. That would mean I’m heading into a 6 day trip with 4 maybe 5 days of food.Hmmm don’t even need to takeoff my shoes to see the problem here. Quick change of plane. After lunch by the river I’m going to climb the 3,000 plus feet out of the gap. Fantastic right at the high temps of the day too ! Actually the climb wasn’t too bad. Shelter and camp sites were all full so I had to push on about a mile farther to find a site to pitch my tent. Tomorrow will be a short day to Stecoach Gap where I’ll stay in the hostel and resupply/ shower and wash my clothes. Rain is predicted in the coming days here, if I take a day off it will probably be when the rain rolls in.","Weser Bald Shelter

It’s a 4 bedroom house he uses as a hostel. I have my own room, and 3 guys up here to do a little fishing will be staying here as well. The hike was done by 10:30 so I have a good chunk of the day to just relax and get things together. I’m going to try to make it into Fontana Dam Shelter tomorrow. 14 miles, and 2 uphills, including the famed Jacobs Ladder. We’ll see how the body feels tomorrow, but right now I’m feeling good.
There’s a scale here. Looks like I’ve already lost a few lbs . The AT should advertise the hike as a weight loss program. Eat anything you want and in 2 weeks you can still loose weight","Sassafras Shelter

Hike is going better starting to get a system down Nd work out all my “issues”. Biggest problem I have is my right shoulder, but will fix that once I’m thru the Smokies and can get rid of some stuff. Until the. I just have to suck it up. Had an interestin night at the Fontana Dam Shelter. Couple of folks got drunk in town came back and woke the whole camp up. Must have been 30 people in total. Surprised they lived through the night. I wish they were locals but unfortunately the were hikers. 99% of the folks hiking are good people, and you can form bonds very quickly with folks you really don’t know well, but it’s a community. That said there is always that 1% out there in every community.unfortunatey these chuckleheads are about a day behind me. I’m currently hiking through the Smokies. It’s about 70 miles, and about 1/2 way through as of today. Crossed the 200 mike mark T 10:00 this morning at Clingman’s Tower - the highest point on the AT at 6,643 feet. Heck of a walk up since we started at 1756 feet at Fontana Dam. The Smokies are ok, but really if you’re going to see the Smokies come in a car and hike the trails . You get some view from the AT, but the better view is from below looking up. From the AT you mostly get a view of whet the inside of a cloud looks like.Today ( Sat) we came in to Gatlinburg, TN. Oh yeah forgot to mention I made it to another state. Keep bouncing between NC and TN. Only way you can seem to tell is if the shelter has a privy. If it does your in TN. Anyway, I wanted to go into town and everyone said it’s real easy to get into town from the Newfound Gap. Just ask people in the parking lot for a lift into town. Well 2 of us - Nick (Smokie)and I were the dumb one who believed this. So of course today it starts raining/ storming about an hour before we come of the trail. How many people do you think were willing to give 2 smelly, wet muddy hikers a lift to town? If you guessed 0 you are correct. We started walking the 15 miles to town. Fortunately about a mile or so into our “hike” some dude stopped and gave use a ride - in the bed of his pickup. It was still raining, but heck we didn’t care we weren’t walking!Gatlinburg is a cool place to visit too if your in the area!Back on the trail tomorrow.

Walling on the AT “creek” was difficult. Feet were wet almost instantly, and had to take deliberate steps so I didn’t fall/ slip. My shoulder is still bothering me too. It was about all I could do to get the 10 miles done today. Should have read the Guide book a little better too. This shelter was 1/2 mile off the trail. Hate wasted miles. Oh the thing about the Smokies. Everyone who camps needs a permit. You have to stop at designated shelters, and can only set up a tent if the shelter is full. Everyone but thru hikers ( people like me) have priority to stay in the shelter which is no big deal, I would rather sleep on a tent than a full shelter. Well unfortunately for me Ranger Rick saw me walk in to the nearly full shelter and said there was one spot left. Great! (Said with heavy sarcasm).

Made it to the next shelter by 10:30. Talked to Trouble for a bit, and met Reckless, Twig, and Wyoming. Aka Larry mo and curly. Great guys out here just doing their thing since April 4th. I’m noticing that I’m starting to catch the tail end of the Hiker bubble.I pushed on to the next shelter, another 8 miles. Day started clearing up , got some decent views. Very quiet. Only saw a few day hikers. There was suppose to be a plane crash site on the trail, but I couldn’t find it. Got to the next shelter and decided to keep going. Would be a long day, but put me pretty much out of the Smokies. So I went for it. The last or first shelter is like a jail. A 3 sided shelter with a chain link fence and a door on the open side. The idea is you and your food/ gear go inside the shelter, and bears stay outside. Basically I’m in jail. Yeah I don’t feel too safe. I guess all the shelters were set up like this until campers started feeding bears thru the fence. Yup didn’t make that up.Off to bed to rest up for tomorrow.

Came into a beautiful stretch of trail with stream crossings and waterfalls. Took a break at Standing Bear Hostel which is really cool. Meet a few hikers from the past, but most of my original crew is still 30+ miles back. Walked a few miles with Monty who has an interesting background racing bikes and making hiking and biking trails. He dusted me pretty quick. Stopped on Snowbird mountain. Nice open bald, with an air traffic control radar tower. Actually took a picture of it when I was in the Smokies, was wondering what that tower was. Talking to the locals on the hill - don’t go near the tower. Response time for a military drone/ vehicle is 20 minutes if you enter the forbidden zone, or fly a drone.After a big day of hiking I camped on Max Patch summit. Have to say it’s one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever been. Can see the mountains for what seems like hundreds of miles. Absolute must see if your in the area. Great sunrise and sunset. Timed that well.Uneventful next day. Difficult and tiring. Stopped at a shelter just before Hot Springs. Will take a light day on Thursday, and if my body feels good will leave out on Friday.

Light milage day today, but lots of uphill. Hot Springs was fantastic. Great food, and a relaxing town. Many hikers are staying in town to  avoid the rain this weekend so didn’t see many hikers today. Stopped at the fire tower to absorb the view. Missed seeing a snake today, been seeing one a day for the past week. I’m no snakeologist but I’m sure they were all deadly.
Got to Springer early in the afternoon. A woman named Sarah Joans was here taking pictures of the shelter. She is working on a book of the shelters on the Trail. Look for it stores near you this spring.

Been fortunate to be able to stay in shelters during the rain. Finally got my first official 20 mile day, 22.8 and a 20.3 back to back. That was a big accomplishment, but the trails are nice in this part. Well the streams are nice since the trail turns into a stream when it rains this hard. You may have heard of the trail attack this week. Happened in Virginia, about 200 miles ahead. The trail communication is fantastic. We heard about it almost right after it occurred. Very unfortunate. This guy has been a problem on the trail for over 3 weeks. They took him in once, but released him. Everyone on the trail is postitioning for trail days this weekend in Virginia. It’s a huge event for the AT. The town it’s in goes from around 5000 people to over 15000. Most people are going to shuttle from Erwin vs continue to hike, go to trail days then shuttle back to Erwin. I’m not planning to go. Should hit Damascus a day or two after the event ends. I’m going to get stuck in a hiker bubble somewhere in the next 10 days. My appetite is really kicking in.

The trail in very quiet/ empty with many people at Trail Day. The should change tomorrow as hikers return.
Still haven’t replaced my stove yet. One section hiker offered me his the keep, but I declined. It’s really not bad without a stove, just limits what you eat.
Taking the day off today, we’ll i should say not hiking. Many of you who know me may find this hard to believe, but I got a job doing work for stay at the hostel. I get free stay/ laundry/ shower and I’m helping the owner plant a garden. Not a bad deal, and it’s helping me get back on budget. Plus I’m gardening, doesn’t get much better than that!
The interesting thing about the trail. It’s really a mini economy. There are people who live on the teail and do this work for stay, or stay for a while to earn some cash and hike to the next town. I’ve already met 3 people on the trail who live this way - and they do it on more than just the AT. 
I also weighed in. Lost 13 pounds. I shouldn’t have weighted in.....
Back to hiking tomorrow. Virginia is about 70 miles away, the wild Ponies are about 100 miles. Trail is supposed to be a lot easier till PA, hoping I can start cranking out 20+ mile days consistently soon.

This area in TN is apparently where a lot of the trail was built, and the locals didn’t accept that it wasn’t their land. Most of the families have either accepted the situation or died off. Needless to say no issues today, and I gave the graveyard a wide bearth.
Some nice waterfalls today. Saw a few deer, and a few snakes. I’m sure the snakes were deadly.
Staying at the shelter tonight. The shelter graffiti board has the handy work of Sovergn on it ( guy who attacked the hikers in Virginia). Kinda creepy.

That was the plan at least. Next stream was dry, ended up hiking about 4 miles till I found a stream with a flow I could filter. The hike today took me to Laurel Falls, and a pointless climb up 2,000 feet and then right back down 2,000 feet. Apparently when the trail was built there use to be a pond st the top feed by a stream. There’s no pond, no stream, no view - just a long 3 mile climb up and 3 miles down! Laurel Fall was spectacular. My guide book says the next shelter was closed due to bear activity, and there is a picture of a bear in the area before the next available shelter. While I could just camp someplace in that 8 mile gap I thought it might be smarter to see about staying at a hostel and cover that ground tomorrow. Decided to do the hostel and try this work for stay thing again. They had some work to do at the Boots Off Hostel cutting grass so I stayed. Also used this time to load up on calories. Ate about 3,000 calories between McDonalds, what was in the hiker box, and ice cream. Still not enough, but I’m stuffed. I have more ice cream to eat in the morning after breakfast and before I hit the trail.Met a bunch of people at the Hostel that I haven’t seen in a while.

Spyder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614345,"Finally made it into Virginia. 3 states completed. Virginia portion of the trail is about 500 miles so I’ll need lots of sub state line targets to hit. For week 6 - get to 500 miles, see the wild ponies in the highlands, and hike 100 miles ( only did 90 last week).Camped last night with the Gary, Principal, in a camp location. Glad he stopped because we are still in bear country. About 11 last night there was some snorting around our camp. It was either a deer or a bear, but it didn’t touch our food bags or us. Temps are increasing now, and so are the bugs. They are the tiny black nats that bite. They usually go away once it’s dark, but we have been doing fires at night too. Usually in the tent by dark.Damascus is a neat small town. I’m staying at the longest continually operating hostel on the trail. It’s run by the Methodist Church in a house built in the 1800’s. It’s had some restoration but no heat or AC so it’s only open for a few months a year.Did some swap of equipment. Sent about 7 lbs of stuff home, and got new shoes. My feet have been hurting, hoping new shoes with additional support will help.Did a resupply and got food for today. Need to try and eat at least 5000 calories while I’m in town. Have you every drank 1/2 and 1/2????","Iron Mountain Shelter

Spyder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614682,"Been a busy  few days. Left Damascus and started heading uphill for a 4 hour trip. Not a lot of sites, just climbing to get to the “cruising altitude”. First day was about 15 miles, uneventful except that there are new bear warming signs posted. I guess they are serious about this since they are putting in bear boxes at the shelters. It’s not a trivial task to get these boxes to the shelters. They are heavy and big.Second day brought me in to Grayson Highland State Park. This is another park that I would put on a must see list. I know it’s a holiday weekend, but there were well over 250 people I passed hiking through. There are tons of sites to see - from the mountain top views, the views of the highland plains, wild ponies... a little bit for everyone. The hiking can be challenging, but there are several trails to choose from. You can also do a horse back trip as an option. I also hit the 500 mile mark today.Yesterday was 20 miles. Hiked out of the highlands and on to Marion , Virginia. Camped at Trimpi shelter. Really buggy and crowded. There was a high school group from Cincinnati. All total there were 3 groups with about 50 kids. 8 plus 2 adults were at our site. That was on top of the 10 or so thru-hikers. The school offers a 1 week outdoor hiking for the kids in the club - usually they do a section of the AT since it’s close. It’s incredible that the school offers this, but also that the teachers support the program ( the school year is done), and so many kids are interested. Great group of kids, and lots of trail magic.Got some rain during the night, but hiked out he next morning to meet Principal and Santa at the visitor center to head into Marion. Turned out the shuttle wasn’t running - holiday weekend- but “Ox” gave us a ride. Getting resupplied, eating, and finally washing my clothes after a week+. I really need to clean these- starting to smell like death. Back on the trail tomorrow. I’m trying to find what the next major site is to see, other than dragon Roth, or some other mountain that I need to climb!!","Damascus, Virginia

The school house was awesome.I just hiked thru the area where the attack happened. There is a hiker memorial someone made up. Kinda weird walking in he area. I also made it past the 1/4 way mark.Yeah!
Today there was a lot of hills and climbs. Last one was a 4 mile uphill. Hot and humid till the last section, then the clouds rolled in and the wind picked up. Made it to the shelter, and decided to stay. Principal ( who I have been hiking with for a week) decided to go on for a few more miles, I wanted to eat and see what the weather was going to do. I’m glad I did. A wicked storm hit. High winds, and lots of rain. Fortunately the shelter is an old stone cabin - staying dry tonight. Suppose to rain through the night, but be good hiking tomorrow.

Spyder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615060,"Started early this morning. An awesome sunrise. I was hiking by 6. Mostly because I was out of water - well down to 4 oz. my intent was to fill up with water at the gap about 1.5 miles away. That was the plan. Reality - I made really good time on the down hill, and blew right past the water. I didn’t figure it out until about 1/2 a mile later, and I wasn’t going back. Next 2 streams were dry. To make a long story short I had to go about 7 miles on my 4 oz of water ( after rationing the previous afternoon). Water sources are getting farther apart now. As much as it pains me I’ll have to carry more.Saw my first bear(s) today. One ran one way, the other ran the other way, then I heard a loud snorting. Might have been momma, but I didn’t hang around to find out. Man those bears are quick!Had some great trail magic today. Saw some signs that said “food” with an arrow. Natural hacker thing to do is follow the sign....as long as it doesn’t take you too far off trail. There was a group ATOM that had a huge spread of food - hot dogs, burgers, chips, soda, desserts.... It was a great feast, but then I needed to climb up about 700 feet. Took it real slow so I didn’t see the food again.Decided to share a hotel room with Camelback Santa. I have to take care of some blisters that tore open 2 days ago. Seem to be healing ok, but want to check them after 40 miles of hiking over the last 2 days.Next big stop is Pearisburg,VA in about 40 miles for a resupply","Chestnut Knob Shelter

Spyder,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615263,"First a note. I only hiked 44.5 miles. The extra miles are to catch up the log. I must have missed a day along the way.
Lots of miles over the last few days. Almost 70 miles in 3 days and my body feels it. Trying to decide if I should take a zero here or take a light day. We’ll see!!
I’ve been hiking with wonder women, camelback Santa, and principal on and off for the past week. Seen a couple of sites worth noting in the last few days- dismal falls, a really neat footbridge, and a great view of the valley where Pearisburg sits (the ridge lie is what i walked) but mostly it’s just been one foot in front of the other hiking in the woods. I’ve been dodging rain storms for the last 3 days, and have been doing a pretty good job. One I was in the shelter, second I was on the “dry” side of the hill. That was inteeesting. The thunderstorm came in as I was walking on the rim of the mountain. Wasn’t sure what to do - hunker down, or keep walking. I kept walking, and as the rain and wind hit the trail dropped off the ridge. The trees and the ledge literally kept me dry. 3rd storm I had just set up my tent and it started pouring. Tent did a great job of keeping everything dry.
Next 90 miles will be challenging. Some of the bigger climbs in VA are coming up - Macafee Knob, Dragon Tail. I don’t think we’ll go much over 4,000 feet though. The trail is definitely easier - less rocks and tree roots so you can get a good stride going.Hoping to make it to Daleville before my next stop!","Bland, VA

The first part of the day was hiking out of town. Did find some wild strawberries! Second part of the morning was spent hiking right next to the town dump. Horrible smell. Made it to the shelter by 2, but felt good so kept going... and going. Was trying to make it to the next shelter, but heard too much thunder. I was camping alone till about 9:30, then 2 other hikers rolled in. It was dark already, guess I’ll meet them in the AM.Had a turkey scare the heck out of me.

It’s been an exhausting 3 days but I hit Dragons tooth and McAfee Knob. Not many other sites along the way. Just a lot of miles.I am starting to have problems with my new shoes. They’re Oboz, never had a problem with my other pair, but the front of these are starting to peal back after only 2 weeks/ 200 miles. I filed a claim online, and within 10 minutes they responded that as a thru hiker the warranty covers 2 replacement pair as long as I’m on trail. Then they asked where I will be in 7 to 10 business days so they can send my replacements. They just secured a customer for life. I’ll never buy another brand of hiking shoes!Heading into Daleville tomorrow - about 15 miles, and then I might stay Friday as well. I’m feeling a bit tired, want to get some extra calories in my body. There is also a mini Trail Days in town this weekend. May stay for some of that.

I plan on doing the free dinner tonight, breakfast in the morning, check out the outfitters, and then be on trail by 10:00 SatWeather is suppose to be rainy for the next week. Hopefully not too bad, there aren’t too many places to stop in the next 60 miles or so.Forgot to mention, had some great trail magic again.

Principal is taking some down time to heal so it may be a while before we are all back together again. Woke up today to a nice steady rain, but too many hikers are in town waiting for weather to improve. I went to the free breakfast, after eating at the hotel, and picked up some free stuff, including another pair of socks. The weather is supposed to be rainy for the next 4 days so extra socks will come in handy.Hiked most of the day in rain. Yup I’m drenched, but my sleeping stuff is dry , and I’ll be in a shelter tonight at least. Hope I’m right and a lot of people stay in town.

There’s no sense putting on something dry since it will be wet within 30 minutes. Other than the clothes I wear, shoes  and backpack everything else is dry. I have also been fortunate to make it to the shelters early enough to get in and not have to set up a tent. Gotta take what wins you can getThe hikes themselves have been uneventful. I know this area must be beautiful, but it looks a lot like the smokies to me - all fogged in! There are some serious altitude changes in this part of the trail - both up and down. The ups don’t physically hurt, but breathing is a challenge. The downs just physically hurt. I’m still nursing my right foot. It’s been 6 days now, and not getting better. I can’t get full bend with my toes, and am hobbling on the flats and down hills. Been running into a group of about 10 hikers all targeting to complete the trail in less than 100 day. It’s humbling to watch them book past me on the trail as they do their 25 miles a day. It’s a very different hike, at least I keep telling myself that. As an example, my pack is between 35 and 40 lbs (depending on food/ water/ and how waterlogged from rain it is). The one guy that blew by me has a pack that was 12 lbs. big difference!Made it into town. Glasgow is a small place, but the Episcopal church runs a free shelter for hikers right in town. Just like a regular shelter, but with showers. I’m choosing to stay at the Hostel down the street. They need a work for stay, and I may need to be here for a few days to heal my foot and recover from the wet weather over the last few days. The church also host a free dinner on Monday since the restaurant in town in closed - yes the only restaurant in town.

Definitely not as scenic as the trail down south.Overall this was a great experience. Almost 2 months, over 800 miles, and countless feet of vertical elevation.
