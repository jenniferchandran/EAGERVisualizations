Mtn.BunNY,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621712,"Rockhopper and I met Tom from “hike inn” at Clingmans Dome. As Tom drove us for the next hr to Fontana Dam, he shared his knowledge of the smoky mountain region as well as his experience as a thru hiker in 2014 after retiring as a lawyer in Ohio. I was nervous at the start of our ride but felt confident and ready to tackle the AT after chatting with him.
We elected to have Tom drive us over the Fontana dam and then started the AT. Took some tome to adjust to the weight of the pack, but i eventually hit my groove. We made great time and actually missed the side trail for Shuckstack Fire Tower which bummed us out. We got to molies by 3pm and decided to continue on another 3 miles  russell field shelter. Total of 13 miles for the day, feeling good. We met mile2go and shared the shelter for our first night.","Fontana Dam

Sleeping in the shelter was tough. Listened to critters scrambling around throughout the night and admittedly was nervous about a bear dropping In. 
Day started with constant rain and thunder rumbling. I was hoping for a few grand views given we were at 4800-5800 ft but the weather combined with it being the smoky’s squashed that. However, there was some wildlife to be seen! Spence Field shelter was closed due to high bear activity. I asked RH to take a picture and I took off hiking. As RH was powering up the phone, mile2go arrived and while chatting they spotted a bear 30 ft away on the move. All that happened before the phone turned on so no pic!!! I was so bummed that I missed the bear in my haste to keeping moving on this 15 mile day. 
We arrived at derricks knob at 2:15 wet, tired and hungry. Took an 1.5hr break to rest, eat, change socks and refill water. Left at 3:45 for another 6ish miles which turned out to be dry but the toughest part of day. Thunder rumbled  intermittently. I lingered behind RH and didn’t get to shelter till 7. Happy to see a rumbling fire, RH, mile2go and 2 new hikers ken and Ron from Louisiana. 
Highlight of the night was an epic thunderstorm which lasted for what seemed like hours. The night was the makings of a horror film as I lay in the shelter looking out at the raging fire, the flashing lightning and listened to the pounding rain on the tin roof. Yes ","Russell field shelter

Mtn.BunNY,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621717,"Slept like s baby! Fitbit recorded 9hr 53 min! I awoke fired up to finish our journey and perhaps extend it to newfound gap. In the end, RH and I enjoyed these last 4.5 miles above 5400 ft. The forest finally had my favorite Fraser firs! Wish I could bottle up that smell! We arrived at Clingmans Dome 11:30ish in a cloud. Saw mile2go one last time and wished him well on his journey to Damascus Va. RH quickly checked the cooler in our truck at the parking lot and had a cold brew waiting! All thoughts of continuing onto Newfound Gap were forgotten! Total mileage 32 miles in 2.5 days. Now back to Elkmont campground for some fly fishing! ","Silers Bald
