Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/441284,"OK, why am I hiking the Appalachian Trail?My hike has been many years in the making from fleeting thoughts over the last 30 years or so; to dreams of doing it as I met people who had either done it or who were planning to; and finally to the ""bucket list"" of something I actually did want to do (about 10 years ago); and then of course to reality of doing. Retirement was necessary so that enough months could be stacked together to create the journey and trail experience I'm hoping for. Retirement happened in mid-2012. I have spent most of the time since becoming a long distance hiker vs a cyclist and kayaker. Thanks to friends I have made hiking the Sheltowee Trace in 2012/2013 and the experience they imparted I feel ready. Regardless this still begs the question, why?In reality there is not one reason but many. All however get to how I'm ""wired"" and how my growth as a man got me to this point in life. The list is long.The beginning no doubt originated with my joy of being outdoors. From camping, paddling, fishing, hunting and hiking with my Dad and the Boy Scouts of Troop 23; to spending summers outdoors with my family at our cabin on the Ohio River in the woods of northeast Oldham County; to more recently, but still several years ago, taking up mountain biking after almost 20 years of road cycling. Upon entering the woods on a bike I instantly realized that the pleasure came not only from the bike but from just being in the woods. In the meantime I also got back into paddling and did more hiking (day hiking) with Cathy (or Catherine to many of our friends) my fantastic wife of 40 years.   More ""fuel"" so to speak has been added to my fire to hike the AT as I have embarked on learning more about my ancestors who traversed the Appalachians during the earliest years of settlement of Kentucky. The most noteworthy being Daniel Trabue. My family is most closely related to his younger brother, Edward, who followed him to Kentucky after the revolutionary war to land they received as payment in Woodford County, Ky.   Daniel Trabue became somewhat famous as a protégé of Daniel Boone and an early long hunter/explorer in Kentucky. Reading his journal and a book ""Westward into Kentucky, the Narrative of Daniel Trabue. Reading accounts of the journeys made across the mountains sharpened my interest, although over 200 years later, to experience the mountains, to the extent possible,as they did. In addition to recognizing how much I liked being outdoors and in the forests one other thing has drawn me to this journey. When in the woods I feel closest to God and his creation. I feel sort of embedded into his work or the portion of it that pleases me the most; where I find solitude and where my thoughts...the good, bad and ugly can be sorted out. So sort of like Jesus I'm heading to the mountains partially for an extended time with God in the midst of what is to me the most beautiful and wonderful part of his creation. So is this all the reasons why? of course not. The physical challenge, the technical aspects of learning and using equipment are also a part of the draw. Kayaking, camping and early experiences in my life and even cycling have added to the my knowledge base but the shear necessity of becoming a long distance hiker is also part of the allure of this challenge. Well now you know a little bit more about why I'm doing this. But truthfully, the final answer to that question remains somewhat unknown as it too is one reason I will be hiking... to first hand try to figure out why this trail or any other, such as the Sheltowee attracts me and others to accept the challenge of doing it.

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/441417,"Now that the dream is almost reality and I've moved from being over a year away from the start of my hike to months and soon to weeks...anxiety is starting over final preparation. I just can't seem to get started on food planning. Other things like final gear selection and purchase, developing the rough itinerary, mail drop and/or bounce box locations...all that stuff is easy for me. The food stuff is just not. In addition to food I still need to improve my capability using my Spot Messenger and the web site for it. I was convinced a few months ago to get the Spot if for no other reason to ease Cathy's mind a bit knowing my location at least a few times a day. One problem I have with it is me not it. The Spot uses color coded lights (red and green)to let you know of satellite connections and message delivery. Well I'm color blind and I don't ever really know if the messages go out!! Just another challenge for me among others the AT has to offer. Philippians 4:13",,The Second Day,"Jan 22, Wed",0
Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/442336,"Now with just eight weeks to launch date waiting is the hardest part.   I do have a lot to do like finishing the purchase and packing of food for mail drops, deciding the exact or preliminary location of those drops, and finally reaching the point where I quit wondering what I’ve forgotten. Like most other activities by the time I leave anything forgotten would not be major.Most of my friends and other acquaintances who learn of my upcoming hike tend to ask all the usual questions. For those of you to whom I have not had these discussions I submit this journal entry for you.My guess is that if you had the opportunity to see me in person or talk on the phone these questions would have been asked so here are the questions and answers...and a few other thoughts.Question 1: Are you going alone?Well that's a yes and a no. How about that? Technically I will be by myself as no friends are going with me for the long haul. That is except for Dan who is driving me to Georgia and is hiking the first 5 miles to Len Foote Lodge where we will spend the night at this unique, hike-in only lodge. We will enjoy good food and scenery and the next day Dan will head south back to his car and home while I head north toward Maine. (At Len Foote I'm still over 4 miles from Springer Mountain the official beginning of the AT.) In 2014 my hike will take me to Harpers Ferry, WVA and where I will start again in 2015 to finish my journey to Maine/ Mt. Katahdin. And then I can check off the most dreamed about item on my bucket list. Along the way I will be accompanied by the hikers who comprise ""The Appalachian Trail""! Together we will provide one another camaraderie, fellowship and assistance when needed. In other words I will not be alone. I do however, expect and look forward to long stretches of solitude and gatherings with other hikers at campsites, shelters and trail towns.It has been a long WAIT to this point and I'm anxious to get going. And now I'm anxiously making final preparations with just 8 weeks to launch.Question 2: Are you taking a gun?Even my non-hunting friends are asking this one. No doubt my ancestors who traversed the Appalachians in the 1700's carried them as they came to and from Kentucky. They needed them, however, for protection from enemies of the wild animal kind and the human kind. Nowadays, folks think I need one for the black bears who inhabit the woods through which I will hike. And even a few in regards to protection for “bad guys” on the trail. Well if I'm lucky enough to even see a bear I hope to be able to shoot a good photo or two of it before it scampers away from me the intruder. Besides all that...I've studied equipment and planned to lighten WEIGHT so why would I tote a heavy piece of metal in the off chance I could even get it unpacked to use it. As for as the “bad guys” I count on them not being hikers. The standard procedure is to camp one or more miles from any road crossing. And, like the bears if a human kind of bad guy approaches me that gun would be deep in my pack. All precautions will be used to stay clear of strangers acting odd.Actually both questions are asked with good intentions for my health, safety, and welfare. And I appreciate the good thoughts and prayers that will be said on my behalf.One friend, Tim, did ask the best question. And Tim does not hike. He saw a KET show on the subject. He asked: what are your plans for protection against ticks? You see these itty bitty bugs may be the most dangerous and annoying critters on the AT. I hope to be well covered with protection. And lastly WEIGHT is the hot topic among hikers as it is also with the cycling community of which I've been most familiar with much longer. My thoughts on this matter are also cycling based...""it's not the bike it's the bod(y)"". To that end it's much cheaper and about as effective to loose lbs at my waist vs worrying too much about ounces off gear weight. My focus in this regard is on compactness - easy to pack, to fit in my pack, and easy to grab out when needed. For example, I recently changed out my fleece jacket for a primaloft one that packs into its own pocket.Psalm 27: 14",,"Wait, Weight, Weight","Feb 09, Sun",0
Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/442553,"Thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail for the uninitiated means hiking the entire trail from either direction (Georgia to Maine or Maine to Georgia) in one season. This is an approximate 5 to 6 month adventure covering over 2100 miles of which less than 20 percent of the some 2500 hikers that start each year complete. The reasons for not completing are numerous. Hikers stop for reasons ranging from physical to mental to other personal reasons that draw them off the trail unexpectedly. My hike is because I want to experience the trail for reasons previously noted and the environment of the AT: the woods, trail towns, and the challenge of being out in the wilderness on a long distance hike. I also want to undertake this adventure in a manner that helps ensure success. To this end that is why I'm a ""Thru-Halfer"" as Steve Burkich, a Sheltowee Trace 2013 Hiker Challenge friend has led me to call my hike.My strategy is that by splitting my hike into two seasons I can experience all the trail has to offer and not be away from Cathy as long. From the beginning I know that being away from my life companion will be most challenging and harder than any physical challenge I will face during the hike. At this time my plan is to head back out next year at about the same time I end this year so as to fully experience the trail as if I was truly hiking it all in a single season. I can also hike at a pace that is as slow or fast as I want. That means I can ""dilly dally"" along the way, like when I stop in Gatlinburg to meet up with Cathy and help my cousin Jan open her cabin for the season. My plan is to hang out there for 3 days but that could easily extend to 4+ and my hike plans remain unaffected. And besides all that I guess since I'm retired there always the option of continuing on past my stopping point for this year to whatever alternate location I might choose.

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/443495,"One month to go! And I'm getting anxious to get started. For the last few days I've been getting food and mail drop/bounce box supplies ready. I really enjoy this aspect of adventure. This is probably due to my professional background in planning...oh well, so be it. I must say however while there is still anxiety about getting everything, including me both physically and mentally as ready to go as possible, I am ready to hit the trail. And even more so today with icy rain turning to snow and several inches predicted by tomorrow. In just about two months I will be at or near the route down to Davenport Gap in the GSMNP. I'm in anxious anticipation of being one with creation, walking north into spring, meeting new friends, being tired enough at night to enjoy sleeping on my mat in a tent or shelter, stream crossing with and without shoes, navigating through small towns and grocery stores looking for resupplies, hostels and motels and laundry mats (!), campfires and cooking on my MSR, taking pictures to share, but not so much missing my Cathy and family/friends at home.

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/445198,"It has been just over a year since I retired and casually began planning for my AT Hike. Serious planning began about 5 months ago and Wow its now just under 3 weeks to go. I'm getting more and more antsy and anxious to start, especially after the one day venture into mid-spring last week (followed by yet another winter mix). I know I will miss my bride and how that will be handled is likely the biggest question I will leave with. My goal is to finish all loading of mail drop and bounce box supplies by March 28 and cruise to the end, but I'm also struggling with getting all things in order here at home before I leave. It seems this is the season for appliances to break down around here. First the hot water heater, then the washing machine's ""mother board"", and finally our ancient dehumidifier decided this was the time to stop. Navigating through these distractions coupled with the need to build two more boxes for our raised garden,hand over my chores at the Reset Ministry, and get the Honda to the shop for checking out and an oil change, etc. are making for an interest last few weeks.I praise the Lord for these challenges and anxiously anticipate my extended journey in His natural creation.",,Nearing the End of Preparation,"Mar 17, Mon",0
Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/446924,"It's finally here or almost. One week from today, April 5, Dan will pick me up and we will head down to southern Tennessee. There we will stop for the night and head out early the next morning for the approach trail to the AT at Amicalola State Park in Georgia. That is about a two hour drive from where we will stay. At this point I'm almost done with packing. I hope to get out a few days next week to hike some more before the real hiking beginnings. My plan is to take it easy with short mileage days leading into my first resupply stop at Neels Gap. I figure it will take a week to ten days, maybe more, to reestablish my hiking legs. I'm really pleased at this point that my gear is not too much and similar to what i used on the Sheltowee last year. Extras only amount to about one maybe two pounds of weight at the most. The exception is food and I will soon learn if I have more than I need. This week I hope to spend good time saying goodbye to my bride. Over the last 40 years we have not been separated longer than 5 days. At day 6 I will be hitting that proverbial ""wall"" and that may well be the toughest day regardless of the physical terrain.",,One Week,"Mar 29, Sat",0
Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/447436,"Less than a week before ""launch"". The countdown is underway. I just completed a trial pack of my gear and food for the first leg. It all fit just great and the weight was no more than what I carried a few times on the Sheltowee. Extra water needed on the Sheltowee accounted for some of it but also when hiking the Trace I most always carried extra just to prepare for the AT. That was a wise decision I think. On the AT I plan to trade off some gear in Gatlinburg, like my winter sleeping bag for a summer version, and leave some winter clothing as well. That should counter some of the extra weight I will need for food later on up the trail. I have been doing battle with a head cold and sore throat for almost two weeks and hope that all clears up by Saturday when I leave for northern Georgia.",,Sweet Victory,"Apr 01, Tue",0
Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/448012,"The big day is here! Cathy and I have had a good last few days and we are already anticipating our reunion in about a month in Gatlinburg. I still expect a tough time releasing from her final embrace. This morning my daughter Sandahl and her husband Jeff are coming over for a sausage, scrambled egg, and pancake breakfast. And at 11 Dan arrives and we hit the road south. Yesterday went really well. All my packing was done, the first mail drop sent Thursday. It should easily arrive at its destination before I do. I met my other daughter, Marina, yesterday for breakfast before she went for a job interview and then to Lexington to help a friend at an alpaca show. Then I headed to the store to pick a few things up for the house; came home and fixed a gutter drain pipe...a rather regular day. Later I loaded my pack, including the first load of water and food. It now sits in our living room waiting to be loaded in Dan's car. Last night dinner was burgers and fries from Mad Mikes. Nothing fancy for the last dinner, just calorie laden and yummy! Just some more cals to burn on hike day one. Thanks to all my friends who are wishing me well and praying for my journey. To name a few I've heard from in the last few days...

Actually was light headed at top and it was not the altitude! Lunched and just chilled at top for an hour before the hazardous downhill to Neels Gap. In Neels I shared a cabin with Cigar Willy and Lucky. $20 bucks each plus free laundry...they do it for you too! Never thought frozen red baron pizza could taste so good.

Stayed late to further recuperate, eat breakfast and pick up a couple of items at Mountain Crossing. Needed some 50 sunscreen to combat the sun. Lucky and I hit the trail at about 11:30 and as usual all trails out of gaps are up. Second trail angel at Tesnatee Gap just before the climb to Whitley Shelter for the night. This one was in person offering bananas. Oranges and apples were all gone. On a hot day oranges would have been the preferred choice. The banana was great though and the .7 mile jaunt uphill to camp a bit easier. The side trail to the shelter was a whopping 1.2 miles and back again the next day. Just too much for this Logman; so I set up camp ""lone wolf"" as Lucky and me had separated several hours before. He's just under half my age and I have learned early on that I have to keep at my pace. My camp site among rhododendron trees was quite cozy but a bit on the slant. During the night I found the tent side holding me in quite frequently. Determined to get up early tomorrow to make up miles I'm loosing as I get in hiking shape...a two week plus process.

First water was (supposed to be) at Hogpen Gap. If it was it was way down a hill...so headed another 4.8 to Low Gap Shelter and for sure water. The trail was much less steep heading into and out of Low Gap. Some quite rocky most not. Another 7 miles to Blue Mountain and dinner/sleep. Leaving Low Gap I passed Lucky who had also solo camped. He is now behind me. Nice hiking today starting to round into shape but still much to do. Arrived at shelter to find it mostly empty, only three in it tonight. This is my second shelter experience and not too bad yet. Some folks were tenting there hoping to get out before tomorrow and storms. Including a couple of former thru hikers who met on the trail and married after. This weekend they were doing a favourite short section.At the shelter I reconnected with Cigar Willy who had taken off early from Neels Gap. Wind all night was forboding of the expected storms.

Too windy to light a stove and too cold to try! In bed by 4:00! I was actually rather warm considering with dry clothes and bag liner. Now putting those babies on was not fun.

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/450360,"After last night the morning could not have come too early. Still cold, very cold but sunny and only a slight breeze. I awoke early and hit the trail for one of my longest days do far driven by the urge to bet back to Hiawassee, good food, warmth and a much needed and too long overdue Zero Day. We still could not cook over a stove so the day began with a cold/near frozen breakfast bar accompanied by the very little water I could get out of a frozen water bottle. Not the best way to begin a long day on the trail. Some say this is the toughest section in Georgia (Unicoi Gap to Dick's Creek Gap). I don't know but with frozen water I was anxious to get that thawed. It took about two hours and did that much needed refreshment taste good! The day ended up being almost foodless as time was of the essence to meet shuttles at Dick's Creek. Few stops and eating from the pocket as I went. Made reservations for shuttle at Deep Gap Shelter, about the last spot for cell service as none is at Dick's Creek Gap. I had two hours to make 4 miles; no time to reload water or stop for any break. And AT mathematics is this: Gap = uphill. On this stretch uphills seem to go on and on and on. So starting my time crunch 4 miles I had about 3/4 mile up before some rollers and a long downhill into the Gap. Got there with a few minutes to spare. But the best news was that there was still plenty of room at the Blueberry Patch Hostel. Seconds there are a good deal. I would zero tomorrow in Hiawassee at the Budget Inn a very hiker friendly motel near the center of town. Dinner at Big Al's all you can eat pizza (second time there too) and breakfast again at Blueberry Patch should be a great start to the much needed day of rest. At today's end I felt like I used to after a long week of cycling...dead legs. And knew that only a whole day of rest would offer recovery. I certainly learned the that I need more rest than planned. For example, I should not have gotten back on the trail Tuesday and stayed over then instead of tomorrow. Of course that would have meant missing all that great weather on Tray Mountain! The essence of the AT...unpredictable adventure. My hope now is to stay on track to meet my wife in Gatlinburg in about 10 days.

Today's goal was to make North Carolina and be done with Georgia - one state down 13 to go. Georgia taught me a lot as the AT does to everyone in Georgia. Weather predictions for today were not great. Late afternoon sprinkles turning to steady rain around 3 or 4. I hoped to make Muskrat Creek Shelter before that. North Carolina trail is very nice, less steep climbs it seems than in Georgia. New Man stopped at the first shelter in, Plumbcreek at about 5 miles. I wanted more miles in an attempt to make up for some lost time on my now way off the mark itinerary so I hiked on with fresh legs from the Zero yesterday.The trail to Bly Gap and the state line was nice and made for some great views. And what a nice site to see the pipe (message container) and sign identifying the GA/NC state line! Per the usual (gap = climb) I head up and out of Bly Gap toward Muskrat Creek Shelter. Steep was the trail and wetter was the rain, now rapidly changing from sprinkles to rain! At a low saddle in the climb I quickly set up camp to avoid the pending deluge. Just crawled in when it hit! (You can see a picture of my campsite in photos...I think.)Per my lovely and adorable Cathy's suggestion as we texted during the rain...can't you hike in the rain? Well yes but... One has to make a decision in such situations. This trail can be a monster in dry let alone wet and getting dark conditions. Two hikers did pass me. For me with legs tiring and the weather I stopped.

Bly Gap was still a long climb after my campsite and the trail down steep, rocky and with running water...not a good thing for me would that have been at dusk!","Hiawassee Budget Motel

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/451309,"Broke camp at about 7 am just after first light. Tent wet and most everything else damp, I headed to Muskrat Shelter for breakfast and to dry out the tent. Two hours it took to negotiate the climb out of Bly and down to Muskrat...see why I made the good choice yet unknowingly yesterday? Muskrat Creek Shelter was not where I would have liked to be. When I arrived it looked like maybe 20 were in the shelter and tenting around it. The shelter itself was very rundown. Of all things at the shelter were a couple from Houston, TX both former thru-hikers, who were there spending two weeks marketing their hiker food (Yeti is company name). So I arrive, take pack off, start to put up rope to hang tent and start getting a sales pitch...not cool. No one I have met since liked the idea. It took about an hour to dry tent, cook, eat and clean up from breakfast (yummy blueberry oatmeal)and hit the trail again. No sooner had I started than a couple hiking a section of the AT heading south passed along word of a group of folks setting up for barbeque at Deep Gap some 5 miles away. Upon arrival I found a well honed setup of ""Trail Angels"" cooking and welcoming hikers...me being the first. Chicken, baked beans, pork butt, potato salad, chips, soft drinks and Gatorade...wow. Unfortunately the pork was not ready yet but I did dine on chicken, beans and other goodies. They said I was the first hiker to pass since the food was ready. In fact as I came into site several of the folks yelled ""first hiker"". Sort of neat in the wilderness of NC. Neat people, organized by two former thru-hikers the group had been doing this for 22 years on Easter weekend! In the morning they were going to be making omelets, custom omelets for hikers passing through Deep Gap. Standing Mountain Shelter, my destination, was only one mile away...up of course...so theoretically I could have hiked back down (2 miles with round trip) for breakfast on Easter. Didn't wanted to make more miles for an easy shot into Franklin one or two days later. At the shelter I reconnected with New Man who had stopped short yesterday and with Lucky from Neels Gap. I thought Lucky was way up the trail. This is what happens on the AT. Everyone hikes their hike but we seem to reconnect along the way.","Bly Gap

And what better place to be than in the midst of this forest and his awesome creation. Looking forward to a long day.Today's destination was in a valley with little chance of a cell signal for my much desired call to family at around 3. My plan was or my hope was that I would be up on the mountain when time to call. I was moving fast over the nice trails here in NC and got antsy so called early while my family was traveling to the gathering. Lucky turn of events or more precisely topography that right before heading down to Betty Creek the trail went over a small summit and I could get a fairly strong signal. It was great to talk with Doris and Bert (parents in law), Mike, Cindy, Joe and Christine brothers and sisters in law. And of course I also heard about all the wonderful food they were about to partake of. (Food is a hot topic on the AT. More so even than gear.) But hey I had taco mac, nuts and a snickers bar awaiting.Betty Creek campsite was very nice. Stream nearby, level tent sites among the rhododendron and other trees, and right adjacent to the AT. Four of us from the previous night ended up there- besides New Man was Lucky and Scott. One other person stopped for a look but continued on up the trail.

(My journal miles add the approach trail from Amicalola which are not official AT miles) From Betty Gap the hiking was rather easy and fast. That is until the last quarter mile or so from the summit. At that point we experience the most challenging and exciting section of trail so far. More accurately cliff...this bit required more rock climbing than hiking. The effort was well worth the reward of absolutely stunning views from the fire tower on the top. At the top New Man and I had the pleasure of meeting Pocahontas who last year completed the hike I'm doing to Harpers Ferry. She has no immediate plans to finish and is now living/working in Franklin. Originally from south Florida she was out on a day hike keeping in hiking shape. Pocahontas gave us some good info about Franklin where we would be in two days for a Zero.Today's hike stopped 4 miles short of Winding Stairs Gap where we would meet our prearranged shuttle into Franklin (11 miles) tomorrow. The Rock Gap shelter was loaded with hikers doing the same as it is the last good camp location. New Man and I certainly raised the average age of this group of hikers!. Example: Too Long Braids (19), Ella (22), Bridgett about late 30s and Essense/other trail names (23). Most were just out of college or high school. The conversations were interesting as these young adults discussed future aspirations and how they came to hike the AT.","Betty Creek Gap campsite

In the past flare ups of plantar fasciitis came and went rather quickly. This time not. Upon arrival at Haven's Budget Inn I showered (whoopee!)and headed straight to Outdoor 76 for my bounce box and a discussion with them about my foot. Great place. Full service outfitter with a bar. After retrieving my bounce box I was invited back this time I must have boots in tow for an evaluation. This I did immediately after laundry, a few snacks and a nap. Upon arrival Cookie (Brian)spent a long time evaluating my feet and current insoles. But first he offered me a beer...freebie organic locally brewed. Sure can't beat that for service. I don't drink much but a cold one while shopping was a nice touch and of course the price was right. I think they really wanted me to buy new boots but Outdoor 76 is very professional and asked me what I would prefer. Since I really like my boots we agreed on a more customized fit insole. So after an hour or so I left with new $50 insoles and the right foot feeling much better. The guys at Outdoor 76 also showed me a new stretch for my foot. Dinner at Motor Company Grill was fantastic and just what the doctor ordered to start a recovery day - blue cheese hamburger with the works, mac and cheese, iced tea extra lemon and a chocolate milkshake for the road back to the motel about 1/2 mile away.

Mine seems to entail a lot of lounging, minimal walking and lots of napping or trying to in the hope of rebuilding energy for the next several days of hiking. Today my right foot is feeling much better. I'm stretching per the method shown by the staff at Outdoor 76 and that seems to be working. I walked down to the grocery to top off my supplies. I did not need much because most of what I need was in my bounce box mailed forward from Neels Gap. Missing was the sweet, quick energy stuff (code word: chocolate). Picked up some snack food for today and fruit for breakfast tomorrow. I will be taking the 9 am shuttle back to the mountain. Several of us here at the hiker motel walked down to a gas station for hot dogs. Nice little mid-afternoon treat. I'm still pondering dinner options and since I don't want to spend much Mexican might give me the most ""bang for the buck"" so to speak. And the closest Mexican restaurant is highly regarded.Soon I will shave again and repack my bounce box for either Gatlinburg or home where Cathy can bring it to Gatlinburg when we meet there. My Gatlinburg reunion with Cathy is getting complicated due to my slow start on the trail. Hopefully, all can still be arranged. I will/hope to accommodate with an improved foot and hence an increase in daily mileage. Franklin is a real nice small town. We are close to the downtown which has many unique shops and all merchants and residents seem very ""hiker friendly"". It may be awhile for my next posts so friends stay tuned.

The places aren't fancy at all but the services and pricing can't be beat. Mr. Haven uses a mini-bus to pickup and deliver hikers to and from the trail. And beside that for free he takes us to resupply and restaurants at no additional charge. He is a real ambassador for the City of Franklin as he promotes to hikers all the businesses in town.After the usual climb out of the Gap we settled in to a double figure mileage day which I need to stay on course to meet Cathy in Gatlinburg. Since my original ""rough"" itinerary is now toast, Cathy and I have had to readjust during this past Zero.One key component for success would be how my right foot responds to the new insole. Early on I could tell it was better but the test would be how it felt later in the day at approximately the 5 hour mark and how it did on downhill sections. Well within the first hour my left foot started to feel uncomfortable! Did I overcompensate with a new insole for both feet when one was just fine? After agonizing for about 30 minutes I stopped, loosened the shoe strings and problem solved. Needed to restring with the new insole. The day's highlight and the last climb of the day before dropping down 1 mile to today's shelter, was Wayah Bald and an historic viewing tower. When this day was done two good things were accomplished: my feet sure enough were doing better, Not 100 percent but hope was there; and I did the miles needed to stay on schedule.Interesting people met today: two young guys from Salt Lake City, very strong hikers averaging over 18 miles per day. We nicknamed one PCT because he hiked the Pacific Coast Trail last year. At the Wayah shelter we had a most interesting and enjoyable mix. All over 50, except Celeste a twenty something from Vermont . Herself a very strong hiker. Besides New Man we also had... get this...56 and her husband, No Regrets! If you been following me you know that New Man's trailname used to be No Regrets until I suggested the change! Interesting, eh.Rain in the forecast for tonight and tomorrow.

Arose early to make it as close to the NOC as possible so that Saturday would be a short hike and a long rest day before tackling the 6 mile climb out of Nantahala and the charge to reach Fontana Dam in two days. Long miles, long days, two in a row. The reward is to stay on schedule to meet Cathy.The next shelter, Wesser, was 10.6 miles. We reached there at 2:30. Good time for the distance and climbs...not to mention the drizzly windy weather. New Man stopped for the day. I pressed on to shorten the miles on Saturday. Two and a half hours later with the narrow ridge offering very few tent sites, I finally found one. I did not however find the spring I needed to refill with water. So with just a little more than what I needed to reach the NOC tomorrow, dinner was quite simple.... jerky, apricots, and a small snickers.The site was very nice with views both east and west toward the sunset and sunrise.

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/453070,"Arrived early about 8 am at the Nantahala Outdoor Center. This is quite a complex that straddles both sides of the Nantahala River and caters primarily to white water enthusiasts but also to hikers as the AT goes right through the complex, and to mountain biking. This weekend was a Spring Fling and the place was packed with kayakers, exhibitors, and spectators.My bunk at the part of the complex called ""basecamp"" was not to be ready until 3. Basecamp is appropriately named as this is where most AT hikers stay and it is literally at the start of 7 mile climb out of the river gorge to the mountain top. I would be tackling that tomorrow. Hence the desire for more time to rest today at NOC.I was hoping to get blessed with early access to my bunk once the office opened at 9. In the meantime I headed first to the outfitters who graciously held my pack and poles and then to the restaurant for breakfast. No trail breakfast today. I awoke broke camp and hurried here with the intention of eggs for breakfast! Two wonderful surprises occurred at breakfast; besides the great food at reasonable price. First when I was seated my table was next to none other than Pocahontas, the young lady New Man and I had met atop Albert Mountain on our way to Franklin and a Zero Day. Small world...she was here for the whitewater festivities. Moments later Celeste the young strong hiker from Vermont we had shared a shelter with 2 nights ago showed up and we sat together. It was nice to get to know a bit more about her. Turns out she is a recent graduate of Berea College and like many other of the younger hikers on the AT is using this time to figure out what to do next. Celeste had already overnighted at basecamp and was eating prior to tackling the 7 mile climb that I would do tomorrow.At 9 the good folks at NOC did let New Man and me into our room. New Man who stopped hiking before I did yesterday arrived at NOC about 3 hours after I did. Once roomed we quickly showered, changed into town clothes and headed to the laundry. At NOC the laundry is located in the same building as the General Store. A very convenient location to resupply on overpriced food while waiting for washing and drying to finish. While waiting for laundry I ran into another recent acquaintance, Robert the manager at Len Foote Hike Inn who gave me the free room and board. He was here doing a section hike/team building with his board of directors. He wanted to introduce me to his board chair. They were shuttling north and hiking south so I was certain ti meet them tomorrow as we go north.After that chore it was basically rest until rejoining the crowd by the river so as to revisit the restaurant for dinner. Pizza of course then to the bunkhouse and bed. A good rest day. Hope I'm ready to assault another long climb on the AT.Blessings,","Unnamed Campsite less than 3 miles from NOC

First one more mountain climb down; second more fantastic mountain top vistas. Today began my push to Fontana Dam and the Smokies. I'm way behind my rough itinerary and need to get my legs under me for more miles per day. I want to meet Cathy on May 3rd. Already 5 days past when I had hoped. And I will completely miss seeing my cousin Jan and her son Jonathan, in from Texas, at their cabin. At the cabin I will resupply, rest and spend time with Cathy for the first time since starting this journey. But this is the AT! This trail does what it wants with you. And most everyone agrees that these first weeks prepare you for the rest of the trek to Maine. For me getting climbing legs on and dealing with the foot issue have been my challenge.The trail today and the climb out of the Nantahala River Gorge provided two of the best vistas yet. First the view from above of the gorge gave perspective to how far we had climbed and yet we knew at that point we still had far to go (up). Cheoah Bald offered the most absolutely stunning views yet of the enormity of the southern Appalachian. To the west I counted 12 mountain tops in a line...and could see even more beyond! Clear sunny days are a real plus.In regards to sunny days we were expecting storms to move in tonight so pushing on toward Fontana was the target.

First in the form of case of bottled water; second from extra supply from a group of guys cutting their few days in the wilderness short due to pending bad weather.Speaking of bad weather our new group of four became two as Peas Pa and New Man decided to bail for the day and hit town now instead of later. Peas Pa had a mail drop somewhere near but not at Fontana, the next for the rest of us. So with that Slingshot and I continued north aiming for the shelter almost 10 miles away.

This would be tough for our two friends when they come tomorrow after a rain. Without sticks this climb would be almost impossible. I have never leaned on sticks with so much of my weight.New traveling partners, Slingshot and Logman, headed toward the second shelter from the Ladder and a mere 6.6 from Fontana where we both had mail drops and hopes to find a room at Fontana Resort to share. We made the shelter with daylight to spare. Time to dry gear from last night's rain. Already there was James, a young hiker from Colorado, who I had meet previously. He can really motor. James had to Zero in a shelter and was still near us.Interesting young guy.

At the Fontana marina the resort has a free phone for hikers to call. Nice little feature. At Fontana Resort they offer special hiker rates and there is a PO for mail drops, laundry and small general store for (expensive) re - supply. Both of us had mail drops waiting.

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/453571,"Weather forecast for today is not rosy. Cloudy with rain chances high, especially in the afternoon and night. In the Smokies the rule is that everyone must stay in the shelters unless full and then tenting is permitted. With that and the pending rain today's challenge was twofold: get to the shelter before the rain; get there before its full. Mission accomplished... almost. Rain began about 30 minutes before the shelter and thankfully there was space. No setting up my tent in rain. Starting at the dam the first several miles were uphill as we went to the top of the Smokies where the trail basically follows the TN/NC border. Lots of uphill and downhill and stunning views. The top of the climb up was marked by Shuckstack Mountain Firetower. Did not hike the extra 1 mile round trip due to wanting to make the shelter. Plenty of other views await as I traverse the Smokies. At the shelter we guessed were 40 people. All of whom would comprise ""the bubble"" of hikers passing through the park with me. There would be competition each day for shelter space. No one likes this but that is park rules..everyone stay at shelters only. And the final kick in the pants is that thru hikers must give up space to hikers with reservations thru the parks. Usually these folks are only hiking within the park. Did I mention we pay $20 for a permit to hike through the park? The result is most of us just want to get the park behind us because the distance between shelters governs how many miles per day we must hike.

I don't know whether my excitement was moving me or the extra rest from a short day yesterday, but I made great time over the climb to Clingman's. It's the tallest in the park and on of the highest elevations on the AT. I got there in about an hour an 50 minutes. The AT meets the walkway up from the parking lot at about where the manmade overlook starts. From there it's about one half mile down a paved walkway to the parking lot. I sure wanted to get there and get a ride quick. Even at this early hour about 10 am several tourists were around. On the way down a lady asked if I'd seen the bear on the way up. I told her I had just come off the AT and had not seen a bear for the last 200 miles! That sparked a conversation that led me to ask for a lift to town. Whoopie, Whoopie I had my ride! And lightning quick too!Her name was Mary and to me not coincidentally she was from Corbin, KY. One Kentuckian helping another and on Derby Day to boot. I proceeded to the parking lot to wait as she continued her walk to view the Smokies from the overlook. During the drive down we shared information about our trips.

It took about two hours for Doc Price's office to nake contact with the pharmacy and for the prescription to be fill.While waiting I went to the library and uploaded more pictures to this journal and made a few edits. Check it out. I also changed a couple of the story pictures. And for Kevin Linn's daughter and my daughter, Marina, there is a picture of the one and only bear I have seen so far. At the cabin Cathy and I continued our vacation/reunion by spending more time by the river. Soaking my still sore right foot in the cold water sure seems to help. When not there we enjoyed the quiet solitude of the cabin sitting on the deck. Neither of us is interested in reading, just in spending time talking and together.I didn't mention yesterday that while at the PO I submitted my first ever absentee ballot. That completed an interesting process that had never been managed before I don't think by the Kenton County Clerk...accommodating an AT hiker on the move. Mission accomplished and may my candidates win.Blessings,","Gatlinburg

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/454422,"Final day at Woodsmoke. Thanks to Jan this has been a wonderful way to take a break from the trail, reunite with Cathy, and hopefully I have made good progress in the foot healing department as well. We have yet another wonderful weather day that blesses our stay here. It was a lazy day with cleanup and repacking chores waiting until the evening. And of course we continued our daily trip to the swimming hole. The soaking of my sore foot finally seems to be working. This final full day together has gone really too fast. We both have some anxiety about tomorrow's upcoming second goodbye. However we both agree that these last few days together have been fantastic. Please pray that the separation tomorrow at Newfound Gap goes ok and for a safe and uneventful trip home for Cathy.Blessings,","Gatlinburg

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/455289,"This was one tough day. Mentally and physically it really wore on me. First was saying goodbye to Cathy at Newfound Gap trailhead. We had 4 fantastic days together and without plans to meet again, it might be 2 months. Watching the CRV pull out of the parking lot made my eyes tear up and throat tighten. Next my right foot had responded well to the work on it over the last few days. However at about the 5 mile mark discomfort came back. Within an hour or so it seemed worse than ever. I was ready to get off the trail to rehab. I was sure hopeful that I could finally start hiking the usual way. That is at about a 2 plus a little mph and about 12 to 15 mile day.Made to the shelter but was very sore and ready to pull off - sure tired after over a month of dealing with a sore foot and too low of miles to reach my daily goals. Cathy and Billy, an ATC Ridge Runner, both provided encouraging words and advice. Billy mapped out a plan also mentioned by Cathy to do less miles, especially than today. Billy to move forward to shelters near trails down off the mountain vs back to Newfound Gap. I slept well now having a more positive strategy than earlier in the day. So for the next two days I again would hike short days and stop early to rest. Perhaps after the 4 day break I needed build back up slower than planned to regain hiking fitness.","Newfound Gap

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/455787,"Early start per my usual routine and anxious to test my foot. So far I was getting about 3 good hours before discomfort began slowing me down. Per my plan of yesterday I would hike about 8 miles tomorrow and then boost to about 11 on Sunday (Mothers Day). Today and tomorrow I would finish near trail down to the Cosby area of the GSMNP. And if needed from there I could get back to help to rehab the foot.One thing Billy the ATC Ridge Runner reminded me of was the AT motto ""No Pain, No Rain, No Maine"". Well I certainly had the pain and the rain was predicted for tomorrow. One goal I really want to accomplish if I were to have to pull off the trail for a while is to put the Smokies behind me.So much for the foot and my frame of mind. The Smokies offer some of the best views and hiking trails on the whole AT. I enjoy every pause in the hike to look out beyond the trail at the majestic vistas. Since Newfound the views have been toward Pigeon Forge and Douglas Lake. Tomorrow we will begin overlooking the Greenbriar and Cosby areas. As projected I got to the shelter early about noon. Set up my sleeping area and waited for others to arrive. Right now our ""bubble"" is small consisting of about five. No Regrets and his wife 56, myself and a couple of others they knew of. Besides Billy we ended up with only one other, Titan a 20 something from Johnson City, TN. Ridge runners (3 in the Smokies) are out 4 to 5 days a week. And by the way are paid enployees of the ATC. They help hikers, particularly thru hikers during the months from March to May. Additionally they help maintain shelter areas, report bear issues, do minor trail maintenance, and report major trail problems such as blow downs blocking the trail. As a treat he brought along a bag of jellybeans to share with us AT hikers. Yum!Blessings,","Pecks Corner Shelter

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/455788,"Today promised rain. In an attempt to reach the next shelter before the 60 % chance I again got an early start. In 1984 a military jet crashed adjacent to the trail. Sad event but an interesting location. Wreckage still remains and is marked on the trail guide. The story goes that in bad weather it hit the mountain at 400 mph and with such impact debris actually landed on both sides and can be seen along two trails - the AT and Snake Den.About mid-way into my hike the rain hit. Not too bad except that at high elevation the temp dropped and wind picked up...and picked up. Praise the Lord I have chosen a good rain coat/windbreaker. With only about 2 miles to go I skipped the rain pants and relied on my gaiters which are tall and extend to just below my knees to both keep my shoes dry and legs warm. I would have plenty of time at Cosby Knob Shelter to rig a clothesline and dry out. I got to the shelter about 1 pm or so. Billy was already there doing his chores. Tonight he would not be staying but would take Low Gap Trail to Cosby campground where his car is parked. We have all enjoyed being with him the last two nights. Arriving about 2 hours after me was No Regrets and 56. For a couple of hours it looked like it would only be us in the shelter. They hike slow and I'm taking it easy due to the foot. Eventually two other AT hikers arrived. Carey Less from LA and Yogi from England by way of Toronto. Titan also stopped by but being young, strong and capable, he headed on to the next shelter just over 7 miles away - Davenport Gap, the last one in the Smokies going north.Soon we were joined by 5 Section hikers from Columbus, OH. Very interesting and ""green"" group (eg. little experience) but they were having fun. The group consisted of four coworkers from Allied Chemical Products and one of their wives. Their story or reason to be hiking is that one of them, Tom, a native of Knoxville, has wanted to hike the AT through the Smokies for years. Sort of a ""bucket list"" item. The others were joining him on the journey. They had hiked up the long hill from Davenport Gap that we would be hiking down tomorrow as we exit the park. To a person they were bushed but still enjoying the day. From either direction entering the Smokies requires a long climb. The advantage we had is that we had been hiking for several weeks. They of course had not.They must have asked us a hundred questions. Ranging from gear, to food, and about our journey so far. We even had to show one of them how to hook up his stove to the fuel canister. I even anointed one of the guys with a trailname ""Corporate"" because we caught him emailing the office! Now they were really part of an AT experience.This group was really having fun. One could easily tell they not only coworkers but good friends. I sure hope the rest of their hike goes well.SPECIAL: Thanks to all who are praying for my foot issue. I feel the love. As of now it is either improving and/or I'm adjusting to it. In the next few days I plan to increase mileage and pace. Let's see how that goes.Blessings,","Tri Corner Knob Shelter

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/455897,"It felt great to be heading out of the GSMNP today. Relatively easy hiking as most of the remaining miles in the park are downhill. Not to good on my poor old foot but good for making time in hopes of arriving at the hostel early. Why? Well the laundry facilities are very old school...wash board and wringer. It would take time and I wanted to be sure to get my rangy clothes clean! Thankfully I was the first in and they did have an electric dryer. With clothes clean and me clean the rest of the was eating and resting. I would take off early tomorrow on the section to Hot Springs.Hot Springs is three days hiking at distances and pace I have aimed for from the beginning of this journey. It would be a good test for me and the foot.While at Standing Bear, Titan the young man from TN, introduced us to his parents. They had driven down to meet him on Mothers Day. They had driven to Max Patch to see that. I'm anxious to be there myself in a couple of days. It is one of the most popular places on the AT. Titan has become popular within our ""hiking bubble"". As he is a fast hiker who can go long miles we most likely will not see him again.Just a few words about Standing Bear. Rustic and basic is the best way (and kindest) way to describe the place. It provides basic needs of food, water, shelter and cleaning. But most of us waited until we went back to the woods to take care of certain necessities. On a more positive note on the way today I crossed paths today with a young German businessman out for a day hike. On a business trip to Asheville, he was out to hike a short section of the AT. In the future, after his children are grown, he and his wife want to thru hike. He was super excited to see me an honest to goodness long distance hiker! He couldn't hardly wait to get my picture. I took his too.All told a rather nice day of hiking.Blessings,","Cosby Knob Shelter

Also excited to finally reach Max Patch just two days away. Ok by now it is routine. Every day after a stop seems to begin with a climb back up into the mountains. Leaving Standing Bear was not much different, except it took close to three hours, a good portion of this day. Not much to see today. The AT is often called the ""Green Tunnel"" because all you see for miles is vegetation not views. Now as the season is moving forward, the forest is really coming to life. Beauty is everywhere. And even smells. What I experience several times each day are aromas best described as forest perfume. Too bad I can't put some on. I'm beginning to take on the infamous "" hiker smell"". Showers and clean clothing are great but as the weather warms the freshness sure disappears fast!As I approached my destination, Brown Gap, dark clouds and wind that precedes a storm began to appear. Arrived in camp, located a spot suitable to withstand a storm, set up and then the rain came. Short, strong and windy. Thankfully that was it after less than about 30 minutes. My tent sure felt stuffy and I was pleased to be able to sleep with the fly partially open.I also had a bit of worry last night. This campsite is located at the junction of two forest service roads. These roads are restricted and since the AT has clearly identified the spot as good for camping and water, another necessity, one would think I would have no non- AT hiker visitors. Well on a rainy Monday night I did. Thankfully my tent site was out of range of headlights. It sounded like they didn't know which road to take. And by the way this was my third solo campsite, so I was alone. Slept darn good afterwards after a good long day of hiking.Blessings,","Standing Bear Hostel

Facing another long day and excited to finally soon to be at Max Patch, I wanted to get moving because I would spend significant time there. The issue being that Max Patch was only about 3 miles away and my target camp just over 10. And of course I camped in a gap...so upward I must go at the start.(Next chance I get I will try and upload pictures of Max Patch to my photo album.)Well Max was as advertised. The best views so far on my journey. From this unique bald one can see for miles and miles. Lots of people get married here and I could see why. While AT hikers take days to reach this location on the trail, there is a road that takes visitors almost to the top. I saw a few there and they were infatuated with me. About my age they were amazed when I told them I had started in Georgia. The day before I had lunched on another open area near a prominent FAA radar tower. Today I could clearly see that tower while having an early lunch on Max Patch. Sure didn't look almost 24 hours away.On Max I met Old School a young professional from Indianapolis who was hiking several sections of the AT with her parents. Parents were alternating between providing shuttle service and hiking with there daughter. Old School might take several years yet to finish the trail but without the need to carry much gear can she really go! Walked with she and her mother for a bit down from Max but they soon left me in their dust!At Walnut Creek Shelter I had sort of a reunion with No Regrets and 56. They hike slower than me but stay on the trail longer each day. I had gone several miles further than them yesterday and did not expect to see them again until Hot Springs. Also there was a new acquaintance, Jay, a retired art teacher from Montana. No Regrets and 56 did not beat another rain shower like Jay and I did and arrived ""well watered"". Luckily they were able to dry most of their things before dark. Early to bed was the order for tonight as tomorrow is the longest day for me.

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/456020,"Today was a long mile day. Really wanted to make Hot Springs as early as possible. A lot to do there like pick up mail drop before the PO closes at 4. I also had no reservations so I would need to find those. Thinking about staying here two days primarily to rest foot. And finally a trail maintenance crew let us know of a storm moving in around 5. Heavy rain and wind was forecast. My target was 3:30. And as usual the day included the usual time eating climb but the last 3 miles were downhill into town.The day became hot fast. Luckily this stretch included plenty of nice and cold water sources. Met up again with Old School. This day she was walking with her Dad. We lunched together at the last shelter before Hot Springs. It was just over 3 miles out. I rested there and refilled water for the last bit. One short climb and then downhill to a shower....yeah! And hopefully enough time to get to the PO.The AT literally goes down Main Street in Hot Springs. Once I got sight of the city I cranked up the phone to call for reservations. At the trailhead in town I finally connected with a live person, not a mechanical voice directing me to push way too many numbers to get help. I just loath that...don't believe me ...ask Cathy. Laughing Heart Hostel was the place. I asked directions. The owner, Chuck, asked where I was. He said you are here just turn around. Yep there he was waving to me through the trees. Laughing Heart is right at the trailhead! Very convenient.Got a good deal on a private room, put my gear in and headed to the PO. That done it was back to the hostel and gear cleanup and resupply organization. Laundry would wait for tomorrow as I needed to go to a laundry mat not on site at the hostel. During the gear cleanup process I discovered water again had leaked from my old camelback bladder. Enough is enough. There is an outfitter in town. I will buy a new one.Dinner next. From about the time I left Springer people have been talking about the 12 ounce Hiker Burger at the Smoky Mountain Diner here. Being especially hungry due to hustling down the mountain today and not stopping to really eat much. I was hungry and that burger sounded good. Even Billy the Ridge Runner talked about it. Dinner tonight was: one big burger, salad with very good homemade blue cheese dressing, and tater tots. Lemon meringue pie went back to the hostel with me.After catching up on some journal entries, it was bedtime.Blessings,","Walnut Mountain Shelter

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/456072,"Busy day here in Hot Springs. Laundry and checking and rechecking resupply were top priority. The laundromat is on the other end of town so on the way through I made necessary stops. First at Dollar General for anti-itch ointment. On the way down to town yesterday I hiked without gaiters just in case I needed to quickly put on rain gear. Gaiters have to come off to do that. With time of the essence I skipped them and now paying with many mosquito bites between where my shorts stopped and socks began. Both of them have been insect proofed. The darned bugs sure found the target area...many times.Next stop was the outfitters. With so many hikers passing right by the front door they offer a great selection and I was surprised at the rather modest prices. A new water bladder was close to 10 bucks cheaper than at home. After that I crossed the street to the laundromat. One hour later that chore was done. The time passed really quick as hikers and locals mixed well in conversations. Well one can't come to Hot Springs and not try out the goods. Can they? A short walk past the laundry at the far edge of town from where I'm staying is the spa. On weekdays you can just walk in. I was the only customer. The session was one hour. The tubs are of course secluded but are along the bank of the French Broad River and open on that side. Real neat! The naturally hot mineral water is pumped into the tub at about 103 degrees. By the one hour mark the water is still warm. I got a great bonus. My tub was not completely filled at the start. This caused the jets to shoot water everywhere when I turned them on. Soaking my towel and some of my clothes. What can one do, no towel and wet clothes? So while enjoying the moment, I tried to get the attention of the attendant. Once done I got a dry towel and an extra half hour. The tub was great for massaging all the aches from hiking and my oh my did I feel clean afterwards.Now almost 1:30, it was time for lunch. Spring Creek Tavern, special strip steak with a great salad and fries. Along with a local brew this was both lunch and dinner. I was seated by the window and was spotted by No Regrets and 56 as they walked by. I had heard they weathered the storm last night on the mountain. It was good to see them in town and dry. At the library, my next stop to use a computer, I ran into Yogi and Birdie. I didn't expect to see either of them again. A quite pleasant surprise. Birdie is a retired art teacher from the Black Hills of South Dakota. Who along with Jay is the second retired art teacher I've met. One from Montana and the other from South Dakota. Go figure! I joined them while they ate lunch. They had a date with No Regrets and 56 for the hot springs tonight. I may be old and out of fashion but those tubs must be done in the buff. Not with friends requiring swim suits. By now it was late afternoon and I needed to get back to the hostel and do a few things. Basically I move out tomorrow to stay my final zero here at another location. Tomorrow besides the move will be a day to use legs as little as possible. Blessings,","Hot Springs, NC

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/456378,"Moved out of the Laughing Heart hostel early this morning and headed to the Alpine Motel for my second and final zero in Hot Springs. Could not get into a room until about 11 so I ran a couple of errands before heading to the Smokey Mountain Diner for a combo breakfast/lunch. First stop was the local hardware. No chain store here just a good old full service with a smile store. There I picked up a 4 inch piece of pvc pipe to use to help rehab my foot per advice of sister-in-law, Christine. Service? 4 inch cut by hand pvc, no cost. Next I stopped at the outfitter to get their opinion on using a part from my old bladder on the new one. The process involves cutting the new tube and installing a port to refill by back loading through the tube with my water filter. Didn't want to mess that up. It's just very convenient to not have to unload the pack to refill with water.At breakfast the now famous Smokey Mountain Diner was crowded with hikers either grabbing a meal before heading out or zeroing like me. Also there was Old School, the section hiker, with her parents. They are relocating further north to hike more sections before heading home. It's always nice to see people again along the AT. We share an interesting common bond.Back at the motel the room was ready. Very nice room. I asked Lynn one of the staff if there was a barber here in town. It would be nice to get a cut as it has now been about 6 weeks and would be at least about 2 more before the next opportunity. I was directed to a beauty/tanning shop just off the main drag in a single wide. Off to find it. I was likely the first guy in the place in a long time just guessing from the looks I got. I was given a time slot with 30 minutes to kill. Nearby I spotted a small antique type shop with about 10 sting ray type bikes lined up in the front yard. Stopped to talk with the owner as a sideline he was selling fresh squeezed lemonade. A great deal for one buck. Back at the beauty now barber shop I was told it had been a while since they had used clippers but that they did have some. Upon being asked how much to cut...my response was whatever you do is great. These days I mostly wear a hat and in the wilderness who cares. They did a great job.Back to the motel and a final check of my mail drop soon to be ""bounced"" forward to Erwin, TN my next major stop. Didn't need anything else so it was across the street to the PO. Then it was back across the street, Main Street, to the library to check websites. The Alpine is perfectly located at about the center of town. Very convenient.The rest of the day before dinner was spent massaging and stretching my foot, relaxing with some TV, and a nap or two. Several of us staying at the Alpine were going together back to the Diner for dinner. No Regrets had not yet tried the Hiker Burger. Can't leave Hot Springs without trying this iconic delicacy. Just before leaving for dinner I finally heard from New Man. By now I figured he was an easy three days ahead of me. His plan had been to zero here on Monday. So much for plans on the AT. The communication was a picture of his foot in one of those plastic casts. He had hiked two 15 mile days to get to here and had injured his foot. MRI was scheduled for next week. He hopes to be back on the trail in 8 weeks. Maybe he can modify his dream and hike with me next year from Harpers Ferry to Maine.For dinner I enjoyed a modest sized black and blue burger and salad with ice tea. And could not resist a take out dessert, blackberry cobbler for later.Before hitting the sack I talked with Cathy, got my pack ready so that in the morning I can be out of here and back on the trail no later than about 7:30.Friends it may be awhile before more entries as I don't know how reception will be over the next few days. Coming here it was very sketchy. Hopefully it will be better as we head north.Blessing,","Hot Springs, NC

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/457049,"Hot Springs was a great lay over but I was glad to be back on the trail. The hike out began along the French Broad River and followed that for about a mile before heading back up into the mountains. The river seemed to be running high. If so much higher and the AT might have been underwater in spots. There were great views of Hot Springs from overlooks on the way up.Rain at a chance of 50%, was in the forecast. The name of the game today, so to speak was to make camp before the late afternoon. That was the highest probability. That was 11 miles and I was anxious to start putting in more miles.I made really good time even with the usual climb back up into the mountains. Tonight there were 9 of us at the shelter. Three, me included, inside and the rest tenting. Really unusual was that everyone except me was from Massachusetts, even though not all living there now. One couple, section hiking the whole trail were hiking with their grandson. After this section into Tennessee and one more this fall they would have only 30 miles in Vermont to be completed.One guy, who was really hard on himself, got turned around after a stop and had hiked 5 miles back toward Hot Springs. This is not uncommon on the AT. He did not recognize the mistake until he could look down the mountain and again see Hot Springs. His estimate was 5 extra miles on the day. We just got a small amount of rain. Along with it the drop in temperature guaranteed a cold night. Shelters are typically colder than tents. This would be a test for my summer bag, which I changed over to in Gatlinburg. It packs smaller and is lighter but also is rated to 30 degrees. That along with my bag liner and I should be ok. Shelter mice would be busy tonight... already were in the daylight. Brazen little rodents and that is one reason no food or other items with oder, like toothpaste or meds are keep there overnight. Bear cables are not just for bears.Blessings,","Hot Springs, NC

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/457051,"Today started out to be short being on the heels of two long days. Still babying the aggravating foot. Wanting to push but but too much. I was considering stopping at about 6 miles into the day at a trailside hostel secluded in the wilderness. If not for the day, for a snack. On the way down the mountain to Allen Gap there was a sign posted along the trail. ""Mom's Hikers Welcome"". Illegal sign if on Forest Service property but I took note nevertheless. Well once on TN 70 I could see a sign for Mom's about 100 yards away. If open a cold drink and snack would be good on this Sunday morning. And would negate the need to stop at the hostel. And thereby also the temptation for a day under 10 miles.Mom's was an ancient looking place. And in need of much more than a coat if paint. Smoke was billowing from a wood burning stove, no lights were on nor any signs of life around. There was an ""Open"" sign on the door. I slowly opened the door and stepped inside. To my surprise and pleasure I was warmly greeted by a man and woman. This started about 45 minutes of interesting conversation as I snacked on cold drink and snacks. Turns out the Cutstalls trying to revive the family grocery store where once it thrived in this area on service to hikers. They open the store from March to November. The market is primarily hikers. It sounds like this may be their only source of income. I was sure glad they were there, as were Yogi, Birdie and Poppy other hikers I knew who had signed their register. Real nice people. I wish them well.After refreshments I was ready to go. Soon ran into Pop C a guy I had met in Hot Springs. We both use the same model of Spot Messenger and saw them on each others packs. He is retired as a Forest Service Ranger/Fire Fighter from Arizona. He had used Spot for years on his job. Anyway this day he was stopped along the trail eating. Pop C had picked up a mail drop at the hostel I skipped due to Mom's and was partaking of some of it's ingredients. We hopscotched and or hiked together until he stopped at a spring to refill and I took a side trail to check out a campsite noted in the guide. At that point I had gone just about 10 miles and with rough terrain ahead it might be tough to reach the next shelter or find a suitable tent site. My investigation turned up not much but one mile ahead was another opportunity. Pop C and I hiked on. He was not interested in the other site so we parted ways. The other site was a lookout point with road access. Back to the woods with only about 3 good hours of daylight. And up ahead was Big Firescald Knob a section a SOBO who shared our shelter area last night said took him over an hour to negotiate. With daylight burning down and tent sites nil thank goodness my legs still felt good. Actually tbe best since starting the AT. My hike today started at 7:30 am and here it was almost 5:00 pm and not done yet.Lo and behold right on the Firescald Knob eating again and completely blocking the trail with steep drop offs on both sides was Pop C! At that point we decided to stick together until we found a camp location. It took some hiking but finally about 7 we found a site. None too soon as we were voth ready to set up and sleep.Thus ended my longest day on the trail so far in both miles and hours.Note: Firescald Knob had some of the best views to date on the whole AT. Too bad I had to hurry through. Someday it would be nice to get back there via the road where I did not camp and spend more time viewing the mountains from there.Blessings,","Spring Mountain Shelter

To me it is significant because that means I have gone as far as the full length of the Sheltowee Trace, ""Kentucky's Long Trail"" that I completed last year. Just a few more to go before I complete the AT!Late to camp, cold dinner , wanting to start being consistent on mileage... what would today be like after yesterday. I was anxious to get going and strive for another long mileage day. I figure that I need to be knocking out at least 12 mile days soon. Pop C is a real early starter. By the time I awoke at 6 he was about ready to leave. Wonder when I will see him again? Really enjoyed the time with him, although short.Today was another beautiful day to hike in the wilderness. About an hour into the day the legs began to feel yesterday's effort. With the early start I had plenty of time to go easy and still make mileage. There were not as many grand views today as we had yesterday. The woods however were gorgeous. Spring has sure given those of us in these mountains a treat. Praise the Lord. Around two I stopped at a shelter for a long break. Looking over the guide I discovered a new hostel at Devil's Fork Gap, just a few miles ahead. Since it was at about the miles I wanted and figuring that I would need probably 3 to 4 miles beyond the gap to both get back up the mountain and away from civilization to find suitable camping, I decided to give it a try. It was 2.5 miles down the mountain and I was hoping for a free shuttle or else I would hitch.The shuttle was not free but cheap. However it was not available for a while. I therefore tried hitching for probably the first time in 45 years or so. As luck and/or good fortune would have it, a real estate appraiser parked at the trailhead at Devil's Fork Gap, gave me a lift. Two for two in getting rides quick now. He was interested in my previous job, before retirement. In just a few minutes I was down the mountain at the hostel. Interesting that about 15 minutes after leaving my ride came back. I thought I had left something in his car. He wanted a picture of me. Gee...second time for that. Who would have guessed that I would be a celebrity AT hiker!Mark, the hostel owner, was gone when I arrived. He had locked up after I called deciding to go ahead and retrieve me from the mountain. He saw the other car pick me up. As this is his first year with a hostel as part of his business he is trying to provide the best service he can to AT hikers. I recognized a few names on the log book of hikers I have met on the AT. Besides the hostel the place serves as a convenience store and short order restaurant for the local area. Tonight I was the only resident of the six bed hostel. After a shower, a dinner of a super dupper chili dog I settled in for the hostel special...a movie on DVD with complementary microwave popcorn.

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/457430,"This is not the hike I want. The day started great. Mark cooked me bacon and eggs. They were wonderful. My shuttle arrived on time and I was back on the trail at about 7:45. Three days more of just over 10 miles per day and I would be in Erwin. The stairs over the fences are iconic on the AT. This is my first. Best I can tell they indicate the trail has access over private property.This would be a day of ups and downs. A long downhill stretch to Sam's Gap would precede the final climb to where I would find a camping spot. About two hours in my right foot and now leg began to act up again. By the time I got to Hogback Ridge Shelter above Sam's Gap I was extremely uncomfortable. And the uncomfortable was now joined by depression as I thought the foot issue was finally under control. Something has to be done. Thankfully Cathy had already sent some additional inserts for my heal, where the pain mostly resides, to Erwin my next stop. In Erwin I would also be taking my next Zero Day. Facing the question of whether I could even make it there...over two days and 25 miles away... a decision had to be made. The decision: get off at Sam's Gap, get a shuttle to Erwin, and get to those inserts so they could be tested. The hitch woukd be that there would now be a short section of trail to make up. That said I determined that it was better to have a make up section, hopefully successfully address the foot, and maintain my schedule. I will deal with the make-up in the future.At Hogback Ridge Shelter I called for a shuttle to meet me at Sam's Gap. That was 2.5 miles away. Marie the shuttle owner/driver said she'd meet me at two. ""It's all downhill"" she said. I said it would take at least 30 minutes longer as the downhills is what really hurts. On the way down a few areas of the trail were exceptionally steep and thus slow and uncomfortable for me. The shuttle took me to Uncle Johnny's in Erwin. This is one of the most liked hostels on the AT. Located immediately off the trail on the banks of the Nolichucky River. The offerings are many, supplies and accommodations, including tent sites, bunk house and even private rooms. Nothing fancy at all but priced right and with shuttle service three times per day 3.5 miles into Erwin. Thankfully I had my mail drop sent to the hostel not the PO. At the PO it would have been the next morning before I got it. I was anxious to try the orthotics Cathy had sent. I took a private room. They are only a few more bucks per day than the bunkhouse and I wanted privacy. Here at Uncle Johnny's one can immediately see the hum of activity and younger hikers warrants privacy for those of us beyond the ""stay up late and party hearty"" phase of life. I also knew I would be here a few days resting my foot, testing the inserts, and just plain resting. It has been several long days made longer by the return of foot issues.Settled in to Room D, showered...ah, always nice even after only one day on the trail. Lots of people were already here that I had met along the way; Butterscotch to whom I helped out with food as I headed into Gatlinburg; Animal and Cat, two recent college grads hiking before starting careers, and Michael who I may have mentioned before. He is a monster hiking athlete...long miles, no off days, and super nice young man. I first met him in Hot Springs and at the pace he hikes did not figure to see him again. And I would not have seen many here if I had not come in from Sam's Gap.Took the 5 pm shuttle to dinner. Tonight was $1 taco night at the mexican restaurant. Uncle Johnny's is a regular here. We had a long, long table ready and help prepared to serve about 15 hungry hikers. Even after a disappointing day the end was enjoyed.Tomorrow I will once again tackle the foot issue and make decisions about the future of my AT hike this year.Blessings,","Laurel Trading Post/Devil's Fork Gap

I'm very hopeful as I write this entry that soon I will be back on the trail and again describing more of His awesome creation through which I'm hiking.Today I tried both combinations of orthotics I know have here in Erwin. Thanks to a second mail drop hurried here by Cathy. Two different insole pairs and one pair of inserts for the heal, specifically designed for plantar faciitis. I want to see the town today, visit the library to use a real computer, grab lunch and meet up with the lunch shuttle from Uncle Johnny's. I took the breakfast shuttle in at nine and had until 1:30 to meet the next one. The one catch...it was about a mile and a half from where I would be. Actually this was good because I could test combo one over a good distance.I have always enjoyed small cities. Erwin seems to have a lot going for it. Being a trail town on the AT is one. The neat and tidy little downtown is undergoing major infrastructure improvements. During lunch at Hawgs and Dogs, recommended in the AT guide and by the shuttle driver yesterday, I chatted with the owner. The street out front was completely torn up. The multi-year project is completely installing new water and sewer lines and placing all utility lines underground and then reconstructing the street. Downtown businesses are completely supporting... hear that NKY. After the library and lunch I headed for the rendezvous. My walk there was a good test for the foot. Seemed ok but I was walking on smooth sidewalks and pavement not uneven hiking trails. Nevertheless, the walk gave me some confidence that I could continue my journey.I relaxed the rest of the day until the shuttle into town for dinner. One pick up included Yogi and Birdie. I figured they would arrive today as that would be about how far ahead of me they were. As always great to see people again along the way. One dollar pizza slices at the Italian place near Walmart and resupply as usual. That is the routine at Uncle Johnny's... dinner at either the Mexican or Italian place in front of Walmart and pickup two hours later giving all who wish a chance to resupply.Thinking about who else might arrive while gone for dinner, I figured that Pop C and Turtle might be at the hostel now. Sure enough Pop C was. Turtle not yet. Turtle is from Murray, KY and a good guy and in my age bracket.Pop C and I shared laundry as I helped him set up camp. He was tenting. I also switched shoe setups to test the other insoles. Tomorrow the decision must be made early because the PO is reached from the breakfast shuttle. Again 2 hours to eat and do whatever needs doing. And of course all was done by walking once in town.Bedtime came just as storms arrived. My room has a tin roof...nice sound if rain to sleep by. Glad I Zero again tomorrow with storms tonight.Blessings,","Uncle Johnny's Hostel

I'm antsy because this will be the third time. I need to see improvement or have the ability to manage the issue. Otherwise I most likely need to head home to heal and modify my AT plans.This morning I have decided to hit the trail with my old inserts and new orthotics Cathy sent here. I will ship the ones I bought in Franklin ahead to Damascus.After breakfast and the PO, I came back and packed to head out tomorrow morning. Food resupply had been done yesterday and unused sent forward to Damascus. Today is one to stay off feet, hydrate, and pray about this journey and God's plan for it in my life and in the lives of my family and friends. Late this afternoon, Pop C, convinced me to have another hiker, Amazon Barbie, who is a massage therapist, work on my foot. Glad I did. That felt great both during and after. Hope the effects last at least a little bit into the hike tomorrow.Mexican for dinner again and a long conversation with Cathy while others resupplied at Walmart. In town is where I get best phone service here. I needed a long talk with Cathy.Back at the hostel it was final preparation for leaving, a shower, phone conversation as least partly between being disconnected with Sandahl, and to bed.Rain is coming tonight.

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/457607,"Up early as I was anxious to once again be on the trail and hopeful for the rest of my journey. I was not early enough to join Pop C on the way out of town. He's an early bird and was packed and leaving when woke up at 6. I headed out at 7:30 and was joined by an old hound dog that had infiltrated the hostel last night. The AT out of Erwin follows the Nolichucky River for about 2 miles. It's a nice start before heading back up the mountain. Less than an hour in and the sky darkened in like seconds and the thunderstorm ripped. I hustled to unpack rain gear- jacket, pants and pack cover. Here I was weeks into my hike and this was the first time I needed to wear all the gear. Shortly thereafter a faster hiker passed and that hound dog went with him. I guess he wanted a faster pace. Speaking of that the foot was good and I was moving at a good clip.The storm was quite furious for about an hour. Not too far from me but out of sight a large tree crashed to the ground. I hard the deep ""thud"" and felt the vibration. On the climb and of course at a narrow section of trail I came upon a fresh dead fall from the storm. Thankfully the rain had stopped but I had to bushwhack around the tree on a steep steep slope below the trail. The hiker that passed and evidently done the same. Those following will have a hard time of it as the bypass route gets worn.To my surprise and joy a SOBO, who I did not immediately recognize called my name ""Logman, Is that you?"" It was Peas Pa who along with New Man had passed me when I laid over in Gatlinburg. Peas Pa had shuttled to trail days in Damascus from Hot Springs and with the aid of his wife was slack packing south back to Hot Springs to complete the section of trail. He would then return to Damascus and continue north. It was great to see him again.I was hiking good but at the usual 3.5 to 4 hour mark my foot once again and for the third time began to react negatively to the effort of hiking. At the point it began to affect my walk I was about 1 mile from Indian Grave Gap. I made the decision immediately that it would not heal without professional help and probably more rest than I could give it on the trail. Sadly it was home for me.At about the decision time I once again heard my name. ""Logman, I thought you would get here while I ate lunch."" It was Pop C. I was really glad to see him once again before leaving the trail. We went down to Indian Grave Gap together. On the way down I called for a shuttle that I hoped to take all the way to Johnson City, TN to a car rental place. At the Gap Pop C and I got some great trail magic. BT, a catholic brother...Brother Tom, hence BT was there sharing homemade banana bread and brownies from his congregation. There were chairs to rest in. Pop C stayed until my shuttle came. Very sad to shake his hand for the last time. It was 1:30 when I arrived at Indian Gap and by shortly after 3 I was in Johnson City at Enterprise getting my ride. I was excited to be heading home to Cathy but not happy to be off the trail. The long drive home gave me ample opportunity to think of ""Plan B"". I did not come up with it, but friends there WILL be a Plan B. This injury has not diminished my dream and I will complete the AT.I got home at 10 after a long drive that included two wrong turns and maybe an extra 30 miles. It seemed surreal to be on the AT for several hours and in the same day be home in the arms of my love, Cathy. That was good for the ending of a rather sad day.Blessings,","Uncle Johnny's Hostel

I like the guy a lot because he has a ""let's get you back on the trail"" attitude. He first asked me my plans/desires for returning and then we discussed how much time he needed to accomplish his mission of making sure the designed solution works. We are aiming for June 20. And that suits me just fine. I will then have a few weeks before my 2014 ""hiking season"" ends in mid-July. I will certainly not make my 2014 goal of Harpers Ferry, but I can at least make it to Damascus (and Virginia) and possibly make up the section I missed from Sam's Gap to Erwin.I will now begin making plans for how to return and hopefully it all will work out.I have appreciated all the kind and thoughtful things friends and family have said upon my return. I know that while my plans were one thing, His plans for me were different and that ok. There have been pluses for me being home.

I'm now ""testing"" to see how much I've healed and if returning this year is an option. I think it is. Another little ""wrinkle"" popped up that I was ignoring as my foot was being attended to. At issue was a sore back that probably was much more than it would have been because of weakness caused by babying my foot along. Logistics are set and I'm to meet my ride in Lexington this Sunday for the return to Erwin. Now I'm quickly redoing my planning and mail drops. I have two out that will be in place. I was not expecting the one at the PO in Damascus to be held, but a phone call confirmed they will hold it for me. Right now my plan is to back track a bit and pick up the approximate 24 miles I skipped from Sam's Gap to Erwin. That will entail another stop in Erwin and another mail drop to resupply.One thing this time around and because of the foot issue is that I will be carrying less food (e.g. a little less lbs. in the pack) and resupplying some along the way more often than I had planned to do on the initial go. Only not so good aspect of that is the food, particularly the dinners, will not be nearly as good as the ones we made here at home and packed. Assuming all goes well for the next three days I will return to the trail until about mid-July and go as far as Damascus this year. Damascus is several miles and weeks short of my 2014 target of Harpers Ferry, WVA. Adding the to the good news of being able to find a ride back is that my good friend Walter will be driving to Damascus to bring me home. He is actually from that area and it will be a nice drive home with a friend.I really appreciate all the good things- thoughts, prayers and acts of kindness and love shown to us during this past month and for Cathy in my absence previously.

Pizza and no walk through a busy interstate intersection exit won.With oodels of time to use it's nice at least to have cable TV. We don't have that at home.

The trail soon started to elevate as I approached Big Bald Mountain and the weather forecast for afternoon rain did too. On the mountain, bald as the name implies, the wind was strong and dark clouds were rolling in. Luckily only a couple of miles to the shelter. As usual I was not planning on sleeping in the shelter but just like when I was out before, weather often dictates that.I arrived early and for a couple of hours thought that I might be the only inhabitant. As the rain hit there ended up being 9 of us. I was rather surprised to see that 3 were thru-hikers. It pretty late to still be this far south. By necessity every one of their days needed to be long miles. Their plans were to wake up at 3:30 am and start hiking with headlamps. Logman won't do that except in an emergency. If I did it would likely create an emergency.One group of four guys was from Cincinnati. And from his T-shirt I could gather he coached football. He does at Glen Este. Small talk disclosed that he knows our friends, the Park's son-in-law, and whose son Logan is a small part of my inspiration to hike the AT. Small world for sure.I saved the ugliness for last.

A test for both my fitness after a month at home unable to do much, and the health of my foot. I thought there might be a chance to press on to Erwin a little over 16 miles away. That depended on what time I arrived at No Business Shelter and how I felt. Additionally I wanted at least to arrive at 2pm and have time for a good break. That wasn't happening this day! My fitness stinks right now....and the foot didn't help either. On the plus side when I arrived there around 3:30 rain was again upon the trail. Got here minutes before the first downpour. Thankfully the rain came in just a few spurts add stopped in the early evening. My new friends from the east side of Cincinnati arrived about 7. Dinner for me this night was taco mac my favorite. Zack the football coach and me had a great conversation before heading to bed. He to his hammock and me alone in the shelter. Zack was quite interested in my meals. He and his hiking buddies have hiked several sections of the AT but in his future is a thru-hike. Overall today was another good day on the AT. Nice trail and scenery. I was not at disappointed at not reaching Erwin. In addition to being a stretch for me anyway, I would have arrived late with no real advantage gained. That is because I could not have resupplied and that would have taken me all day. In other words I would have been there until Thursday anyway and paid for 2 nights instead of one. No Business is free and it's only about 6 miles into Erwin tomorrow. I will be there before lunch tomorrow easy.Late, real late another hiker showed up and startled me when shining his light in the shelter. I invited him in but he chose to tent. Seemed sort of silly to me. Without asking I new he had hiked a very long way, it was almost midnight, and the shelter was empty except for me. I'm still learning how to adjust the contraption for my foot used when sleeping. Actually it's not too bad but a bit cumbersome getting up during the night...especially from a sleeping bag. In the shelter, particularly when alone, I could easily do all the exercises for my foot and back.

Sort of slept in with short miles today. Nevertheless I was out and hiking shortly after 7. Everyone says this is a great section of trail. Right from the start it proved to be. I was aiming to reach the Nolichucky River and Uncle Johnny's Hostel right at the trailhead before lunch. With only one long climb I made good time and was on pace to arrive before 10 am. About one and a half miles out, Adam the late arriving hiker, caught up with me. He is another late starting thru-hiker. When I asked if he thought he could make Maine he responded ""I hope not"". What? With that attitude he may not. He hiked over 30 miles yesterday!There is a much talked about view of Erwin from the trail down the mountain. See picture. As we got close to town it began to sprinkle. Just as we exited the trail about 100 yards from Uncle Johnny's the clouds let loose. Whew! Talk about good timing.With the rain there was a question as to whether there would be room available for me. Rain often encourages hikers in towns to stay put. Luckily several did not. Uncle Johnny's Hostel while not lavish fit the bill both in price and utility.The Ohio guys arrived shortly after the rain had stopped. Most of their hike today was in the rain. Sure glad I started early. Weather tomorrow is supposed to be just as bad so I may very well get a soaking. After arriving and getting my gear in the room I hung out a while with the Ohio guys getting to know them better before doing the chores of the day...gear cleanup, resupply from mail drop, shower, laundry and dinner. After dinner was the usual trip to Walmart for folks to resupply. I didn't need much so spent time talking to Cathy. I've been in Erwin so much having stayed here almost three days trying to get better so I could continue hiking before heading home in May, that I really know the place. For example, poor cell service at the hostel so calls necessary while in town at Walmart. Upon return from dinner I learned two things. First someone had bought 28 rib eye steaks to share. Ok...after one burrito, one enchilada, chips and refried beans, there was just enough room for a grilled steak..yummy! The second thing was not so inviting. My Sheltowee friend Steve B posted me a message about bear activity along a section of trail I will reach in about 5 or six days. We all knew of earlier caution notices but apparently the situation has gotten worse. Right now we can still hike through but must not stop or stop to fix a meal. Currently the official word covers only a four mile section of trail. New information from Steve and gleaned from others seems to indicate a 12 mile section. If so that will greatly affect me as that exceeds my daily miles for this hike considering my foot issue and care I'm taking with it. I will be staying at the Kincora Hostel just before the area and most certainly better information will be available.

Around 8 just when I thought I'd be Nails, from Texas, and John Wayne, from Florida showed up. I shared a shelter my first night out with John W.

That decision will be made tomorrow morning. CeeCee or Connie her real name is a most wonderful hostel hostess. It is known that she honors the Jewish Sabbath from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday.

Between that and other chores she was needing to get done before sundown us three hikers here today were mostly on our own. CeeCee took us to a small crossroad community for lunch. I got a hamburger and the largest side salad in history. Shared half of it with Spectrum (Amanda from Louisiana) who arrived too late for lunch. For dinner she brought us back sandwiches from Subway. Besides me an Spectrum the third hiker here, a repeat customer, is Pick a retired Army Sargent from Virginia.

I heard from a hiker I met in May, Wild Child, that while at Traildays in Damascus, she helped work on about a mile of trail ""somewhere"" south of Damascus. I think this section may be it. Sure was a lot of work. It made the trail up to Roan, at least a part of it, much less steep. Thanks to whoever did the work.The first three miles today took less than 2 hours. The next 7 took six hours. And the stinky was that the summit was fogged in. At least there was a public restroom with potable running water. There I could resupply my water for the final mile and a half to the Roan Mountain High Shelter. Nice to not have to filter..and faster. I was anxious to get to the shelter and eat. Had only snacked all day since breakfast at Greasy Creek Friendly.Roan shelter is the highest on the AT and some say the coldest. The good news is that its an old fire watchers cabin and even has a door and two floors. Pylons for the old tower are about 30 yards away now hidden in the forest.The fog created a rather Erie environment. In all about 12 hikers showed up. Seven of us stayed in the shelter.One character the others had told me/ warned me about also showed. He is called Crazy Pete. Crazy is very likely one of the characters who hang around the trail. He was ill equipped to be in the forest and in my opinion in danger of severe injury or death. One sign was that he wore blue jeans and didn't appear to have any long sleeve clothing. I will be glad to be rid of him and hope he doesn't show up at the shelter tomorrow.Tomorrow's hike should be wonderful as we cross several balds in a row before staying at Overmountan shelter. Overmountan is one of the iconic AT shelters. A renovated barn with stunning views of the mountains and the valley that the Overmountan men from what is now Tennessee, took to fight the British at the Battle of Kings Mountain during the revolutionary war. Can't wait.Blessings,","Greasy Creek Friendly Hostel

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/464036,"It rained like cats and dogs last night on Roan Mountain. Praise the Lord for that cabin and not the typical 3 sided AT shelter. All was well this morning for as far as I could see. About 100 yards! Fog on the mountain again. We couldn't tell how the weather was until we hiked to lower elevations. No exaggeration here. Most of the trail down to Carver's Gap was a creek. Slippery rocks and tree roots are certainly not how one wants to start a two mile or so down a mountain...and on Sunday to boot.Carver's Gap is a major tourist attraction. Day hikers by the dozens hike to Jane's Bald and Grassy Bald. Many hikers were coming down as well after weekend hikes. Most used the AT and overnighted at the Overmountan shelter which is only 5 miles from Carvers Gap. Talking with a family heading down I learned of a program wherein goats are being used to maintain the balds. It's an experimental program and this family volunteers and spends one night each year helping. Last night was their night. The two children, both girls who each looked to be under the age of 10, were cute in hiking gear. They had a cold, windy, and wet night in a tent. The goats are kept confined/protected by an electric fence. It's moved so they graze in different locations. The short hike ended with about 30 minutes or 1 mile of rainstorm. Soaked pretty good and discovered that my left boot is no longer waterproof. Go figure it's only been used for about 900 miles now. It will do fine to finish this section but must be replaced for future hikes. By the time I reached the Overmountan shelter the rain had stopped. The sun was out and the view awesome! It would rain on and off the rest of the day. That made it impossible to rig a clothes line so the sun could dry my things. My line in the shelter was only minimally useful. Good thing I will be able to wash and dry at the hostel tomorrow.When I arrived there were already a few hikers there. Three sisters and one of the sister's husband and two local day hikers. Those guys clued me in and revved me up for tomorrow's summit of Hump Mountain. They also provided much comforting news that Crazy Pete had stopped in but moved on. I do not want to share shelter space with him again. Upon the arrival of others who had been with me last night at Roan Mountain, I learned he is the likely culprit who stole an item from one of the ladies as he left the shelter first and early this morning. Later on Wounded Knee showed up. Sort of expected him to go much further than this shelter.Wounded Knee is a guy I first met last Monday when I started at Sam's Gap. He does long long miles. For example, last night he was at Roan when I hit the sack. Sometime around 10 he hit the trail for more miles. I thought he was still asleep upstairs when I left Roan this morning. Lo and behold as I passed a shelter just two miles before Overmountan there to my surprise was Wounded Knee crawling out of his sleeping bag. He hiked through the storm until 3:30 am! Now at this shelter just two miles from where I saw him. He had other plans. At this location the AT is crossed by the Overmountain Trail that comemorates the men who crossed the mountains here during the revolutionary war. Wounded Knee took off on that trail with his slack pack in search of the city of Roan Mountain and beer. Sort of crazy in my book. It continued to rain, got dark and no Wounded Knee. He got back about 10:30 soaked of course and of course no beer. He did get to town. Odd young man but a strong, very strong hiker.Just advertised the view from Overmountain was awesome..in sunshine, rain, fog and mist, and in the dark. And I could see it all from my sleeping bag!We also had good cell phone reception. Even got a call from my good friend Walter. I think he thought he was calling Cathy. Walter will be picking me up in about two weeks in Damascus. I think he was as surprised as me! This is the second call I've gotten, except from family while in town. All in all another great day with awesome views. Just one of the main attractions of the AT.Blessings,","Roan Mountain High Shelter

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/464037,"Those two local hikers yesterday were not exaggerating. The views in the Roan Highlands were the best yet. This morning I got going early. With only 9 miles to hike and a Zero tomorrow, I wanted to go slow and enjoy the effort. Leaving the shelter climbing began almost immediately. At the first bald I could look down and see the shelter. Yesterday we heard hikers yelling to us but could not locate them. A mile or so later I started entering the highlands. Fog obscured much of the view at first. Then I stopped, turned back toward the trail I had just hiked and WOW! The fog was lifting and the wind was beginning to move the clouds across the landscape below me. I spent most of the next hour stopping every few minutes to just enjoy God's creativity. His paint brush was changing my view constantly. What a great way to spend a Monday morning. I will load pictures as soon as I can in the photo album.Hiking north the trail up Hump Mountain, the name of this one in the highlands, there are numerous false summits. Each one held the promise of another version of the wonderful views from this mountain. I almost hated to leave but was also anxious to reach the hostel to shower, do laundry especially after the rain, and rest before adding daily miles to reach the next hostel.The trail down off the mountain was a bit tricky in spots as it was still quite wet from yesterday's rain. I was also hiking with one wet boot that was not too comfortable. At Doll Flats, a camp spot I had planned on using in my rough itinerary, I stopped and talked to a couple from Missouri (Jim and Trish). They were on their first section hike on the AT. I answered about a hundred questions they had. Hope they have a great hike this week. The Mountain Harbour Hostel is .3 miles down U.S. Highway 19 E from where the AT crosses that road. I arrived about 2 immediately checked in and showered. The perfect end to a gorgeous day that was preceded by rain.Blessings,","Overmountain Shelter

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/464774,"Mountain Harbour is a nice hostel located just a few miles outside of Roan Mountain, TN. It is just .3 of a mile from where the AT crosses US19E. It too like the Overmountain Shelter is a converted barn. A whole lot more converted! It can sleep 8 indoors and numerous in tents. It is also located near a B & B on the same property. They provide the much desired shower and free shuttle to town for dinner and resupply (at 5 sharp). Roan Mountain the town is just a few miles away. It is a very small town and the pickings are slim for restaurants and groceries.The others here last night, a group I've been sharing shelters with now for several days, got out really late today. That is after John Wayne whose hobby is cooking provided everyone with a fantastic breakfast. I did cleanup since they were leaving. The least I could do for a free meal. I'm guessing I might see them again because they won't get too far today.I spent most of the rest of the day evaluating my food supply to make sure that if more was needed I could get it tonight during the dinner run. And of course just staying off my feet and resting.Early in the afternoon another couple arrived who had stayed at Overmountain shelter while I was there. Patrick and Jill from Kansas had stopped yesterday at Doll Flats for the night. They then came the two plus miles down the mountain today. The three of us were the only ones at the hostel until after dinner. Today is Jill's birthday. No idea which one but definitely low thirty's at the most. They partook of a movie after showering etc. And I was surprised that my nap was successful. Earplugs could not be found. I guess fatigue over came the noise. Dinner was again at Bob's Dairyland. This time it was the signature cheeseburger using beef ground fresh on site...wow. Could not taste the difference. Chocolate milkshake for desert. Back at the hostel two guys had arrived who would be slack packing from Carver's Gap back to here. A tall order. I hope they pack enough to stay a night on the mountain just in case.We all congregated on the front porch of the B and B for WiFi service before turning in for the night.

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/464775,"I'm really anxious now to finish my AT hike for this year. I would welcome a fall hike if friends are going. But for now I'm ready to get home with Cathy and start planning how to complete the whole trail. Today I got out of the hostel about 7:45am. Trail information provided by Vagabond who has hiked the AT and manages the hostel, indicates that this next section between Roan Mountain and Kincora Hostel, while not flat it is more gentle and good time/miles can be made. I would love to do this section in two days instead of my planned three. I set out to reach the first of two shelters. Once there, hopefully around noon, I will lunch, stretch foot and see if it's wise to push on.The views today were mostly nonexistent. Especially after those awesome ones the last few days on the trail. However heading back up into the mountains I arrived at a grassy area. When I looked back there through light cloud cover was the grass covered summit of Hump Mountain. I sure hope it shows in the picture. Overall the trail today reminded me of the Sheltowee Trace back home. Similar forest and trail composition. I did make good time. Once at the shelter I lunched and exercised my foot. Decided to stay put. Hiking would gave meant tenting and as I write this the expected storm is brewing. So the plan now for tomorrow is similar to today: make the next shelter about 10 miles and evaluate. I will leave earlier thus allowing more rest time before pushing on to Kincora. The difference is that tomorrow may be a longer day than today would have been, but ends at a hostel not a campsite. Dinner is done, water refilled, sleeping bag set up, rain starting...almost bedtime. Hope tomorrow finds me at the hostel instead of the next shelter.Blessings,","Mountain Harbour Hostel

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/464777,"Struck out very early today at 6:00 am in hopes of making the next shelter 10 miles away. At that stop I hoped to be there with enough time to have a long rest before heading down to the hostel 7 more miles away. I did make good time averaging just over 2 mph. The shelter was the worst I've seen on the AT! Very dirty and run down. Wouldn't have stayed there if I was dead tired. Actually I was feeling good. But the question was could I do another 7? Well after a one hour rest and lunch off I went. That was at 12:30. The trail was mostly level to downhill most of the way. I slowed mightily about two miles from the end. Even tripped and fell for the first time! Later discovered one of my sticks was slightly bent. Earlier, before I fell, a stick was put to good use stopping a fall. Had not fallen hardly at all since starting this journey back in April. And here today once and almost twice! Question is did I bend it on the fall or the almost fall. No matter bend was slight and still stick fully functional Was I ever glad to reach Dennis Cove Road. Kincora Hostel was . 3 miles away. Got there just before 4 and no one was home. The hostel was open and a sign said to go on in. I did and the place was ..well it's ""rustic"". I guess that's what one gets at a place that takes donations only and the suggested amount is 5 bucks. The owner, Bob Peoples who is a legend on the AT arrived about 5. We immediately had to go into town, Hampton, TN. because the grocery closes at 6. Picked up a frozen pizza, Gatorade, two soft drinks, and three bottles of water for the trail. One other hiker, a day hiker from St. Louis I think was staying there. Besides Bob a former thru-hiker , still using his trailname, Lumpy was there. He was Bob's help around the hostel and with trail maintenance. Get this he sleeps in the woodshed not the hostel! No kidding. Scott the day hiker was also a bit odd. When away hiking he likes to be uncomfortable. He thinks that's is the way it's supposed to be. To that end he doesn't shower, shave or sleep in a bed. Sleeping is done sitting and in dirty clothes. And apparently he doesn't eat much either. Odd and more Odd. Very interesting guy otherwise. Very knowledgeable of birds, plants, trees and the like.Bob seems to know the AT like none other. Is very active in trail education and the Appalachian Trail Conference. He is in charge, totally as a volunteer, of maintaining all the trail I've hiked since after Erwin! I told him of a tool I saw along a relocated section going up Roan Mountain...a solid steel pry bar for moving rocks. Probably weighs in at 50 to 70 lbs. And not the tool one would want to voluntarily carry to such a job site or use for that matter! Bob immediately told Lumpy to go fetch it the next morning. That's likely at least a 5 mile round trip. First it would be down from the parking area on the mountain top and then up with the tool. Glad I could be of help guys.I initially had thoughts of Zeroing or Neroing at Kincora, but for me this would not be a comfortable option. Just a wee bit too rustic and with no cell or WiFi service nothing at all to do. The only reason to stay would be if I just absolutely needed rest..like after my longest ever day on the AT! I decided it was time to test both me and my foot. So how about the second longest day since returning to the AT two weeks ago and followed by a 10 miler into Damascus. I had now made the decision to have Bob shuttle me around the over active bear section plus a few miles and just get me home and back to Cathy another two days plus or so sooner. Sure do miss my bride. I can make that section up in the future. Perhaps with Sheltowee Trace friends.Tomorrow's hike starts at TN 91 in a gap almost at the top of the mountain. The trail basically will skirt the ridgetop before heading down into Damascus. According to Bob, I should be able to make better time, approximately one half mile per hour, over the next two days.Now to bed Logman....""If you are lucky enough to be hiking in the woods, you are lucky enough"" from the wall of an AT shelter.Blessings,","Mountaineer Falls Shelter

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/464883,"Today's hike started at one of the unique trailheads. At this location part of the trail, perhaps one-half mile is handicapped accessible. It's gravel at less than 6 percent grade. At the end of that the trail crosses private property for about one mile. A cow pasture complete with manure and of course the bovines seem to hit the mark consistently. Hence, this hiker was in the pasture not on the trail frequently. About three miles into the hike I see my first black bear, besides the tourist beggar one at Clingman's Dome in the GSMNP. I saw/heard him coming at me some 50 yards away before he saw me by about a millisecond! Off he went like a greyhound after the rabbit. No picture opportunity. That big boy could move and it sounded like the forest was falling down. Now as you know one reason for jumping ahead today was to bypass the bear watch/high activity area. Irony isn't it the that I see one within the first hour today. The trail today was exactly as described by Bob Peoples..easy and faster. To be expected from such a knowledgeable source. At the first shelter I took only a short break to try and return Spectrum's hat. The other day I was behind her and picked it up after it was dropped. She probably had it hanging on her backpack. Anyway she knew I was behind her and left a note at a shelter to hang on to it. Since I don't think I will see her again, especially after skipping a section, I needed a way to get it to her. My method: hat with note in large zip lock and hung at shelter immediately adjacent to trail and in plain view. Hope she gets it.A few hours after the shelter stop and about a mile or two from my target shelter..BEAR NUMBER TWO! This one surprised me..a lot. Heard it, saw it real close about 20 yards, it was gone right across the trail in front of me with the same crashing through the woods as the first one. This guy saw me first for sure. So this is bear day whether or not. Met two guys about my age along the trail. We talked some. They were headed to the same shelter I was for the night. I got there first by about an hour. Rob a twenty something hiker out for the weekend was already there with his tent set up. The other two guys, Jim and Kevin arrived and the three of us set up in the shelter. The weather today was great. Cool here on top and gonna be very cool tonight. Tomorrow the same for the hike in to Damascus. The four of us had really good conversation as we built a fire and cooked and ate dinner. Kevin thru-hiked in the mid-seventies. Jim and Rob wanted to know a lot about hiking and I enjoyed sharing the duties if information provider with Kevin.My plan is to wake at the usual time and try to hit the trail by 6:30 for a leisurely hike to Damascus.

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/464884,"Today I awoke as usual, about 5:30 am and hit the trail about 6:30 on this my last day of hiking the AT in 2014. While a bit sad I was also excited to be nearer the reunion with Cathy. That was still two days off as my friend Walter would not arrive to retrieve me until Sunday and we would head home on Monday. And then we will likely have to wait until the PO opens to get the box I mailed there over a month ago. I doubt my easy pace today will get me the ten miles to town before the PO closes at 11.The trail down from the shelter was even more gentile than the day before. I was gliding down enjoying the chilly morning and bright sunlight filtering through the forest. Hold it! Another bear! Right on the trail with his back to me. Picture time? Gotta get closer. Tried that but failed as he slide off into the forest with hardly a noise. Probably watched as I passed his hiding place. Passed a small group of hikers heading up as I approached town. The AT enters town from this direction right past someone's side yard. The couple was on the back porch. They hardly gave me a glance. Can you imagine how many hikers they see? Next you cross into a city park through an official looking archway. From there the AT hits Main Street and follows it through town. I was advised, again by Bob People's, to stay at Dave's Place Hostel. It's owned and operated by the Mt. Rogers Outfitters located right across Main Street. And both are about dead center in the town. Very convenient. One attraction was that the hostel is small, has individual rooms that sleep only two, and each room is keyed for gear security. At $21 per night a good deal. Checking in I learned that there is no coin laundry in town. It closed two years ago. That meant I would remain i. n my hiking clothes until tomorrow to help keep town clothes clean for two days of use. Once gear was stowed, the first order of business was...a shower...nope skipped that for the moment and went to find lunch. That turned out to be an adventure too. My philly cheesesteak sandwich came complete with ground pieces of bone. Yuk! Exchanged for a less than average cheeseburger. I spent the rest of the day walking the town. Visited a few interesting shops. A long nap was welcomed too. Later two other hikers who I knew from the trail stopped by...Wounded Knee and John Wayne..now Chef John Wayne. These guys still hope to make Maine before the trail to Katadin closes. They will need to continue hiking fast and long. Both will be leaving Damascus tomorrow. They welcomed some of my extra food supply that, of course, I don't need now.All in all a rather slow but enjoyable day once in Damascus. Dinner was a calzone. Real good but the smallest size was too big for me to finish. After dinner and alone at the hostel, I spent time updating this journal, and getting gear ready to move to another hostel tomorrow when Walter arrives. This hostel requires the use of your own sleeping pad and bag, which Walter will not have. I found a hostel with real beds so tomorrow is both Sunday and relocation day.

We will head home tomorrow morning. In the meantime, Jeff the owner of Mt. Rogers Outfitters, invited me to his church this morning. It was a short walk (every walk in this small town is short) back toward were I entered on the AT. Prior to heading there I was honored to meet Jeff's father Dave the founder of Mt.

I was a bit surprised he had not started back on the trail this morning. He is aiming for Maine and can't really afford too many more low or no mileage days. It was great seeing him though. After church I relocated to Hikers Inn Hostel where Walter and I would have beds vs. platforms and the need to use sleeping pad and bags. Hikers Inn is very nice and even has AC. Once there I basically relaxed on the front porch and observed the happenings on Main Street Damascus on a sunny Sunday afternoon. Most all traffic was cyclists using the Virginia Creeper Rail Trail that also goes through town. Walter arrived around 4. I showed him the town. We loaded his stuff into his room at the hostel and went to dinner at a barbecue restaurant followed by ice cream...yummy. Back at the hostel we conversed with other hikers before hitting the sack.

After the trials and tribulations on 2014 there were basic decisions to make regarding how to finish my dream of hiking the AT. Having only completed 1/2 of my 2014 goal, several options were available for 2015. The two primary ones being to continue with my two year plan or go for a three year plan. At this time after discussions with my wife, Catherine, it appears with about 95% certainty I will stick with the two year plan. The two year plan is that will ""Aim for Maine"" not just to Harpers Ferry, WVA my 2014 goal. What this means is more time away from my wife (the toughest task for sure of long distance hiking for me) and approximately 1700 miles...almost a thru-hike. At this time I'm completing a rough, very rough itinerary which will be the basis for food and other supplies. I will be starting from Damascus, VA for sure. The location where I had to stop in 2014.

Besides a great visit to the magnificent Biltmore Estate we stopped at two places I hiked through/over last year and that I wanted to show to Cathy. Did you know that the Vanderbilt's, who built Biltmore, gave a lot of the land for Pisgah National Forest? AT hikers pass through a large section of that on the AT. On the way to Asheville we stopped in Hot Springs. We enjoyed a visit to the hot springs and a meal at the Smokey Mountain Diner. After two days in Asheville we drove about 10 miles (one way) on forest service roads to near the top of Max Patch. Once there we hiked about 2 miles so that I could show Cathy one of the magnificent panoramas I visited last year. This one was easy to get her to because of road access. The other two will involve long day hikes and maybe one night in the woods. Here is a picture of Cathy on the trail on Max Patch. Note the AT blazes on the posts..simple 2 inches X 6 inch white blazes. Before leaving Asheville we picked up bananas for trail magic. On Max Patch we where able to give several away to AT hikers we met. The remaining we left for others heading that way. It was fun to give back in this way.

Just enough miles and climbing for the first day. At the Shelter I met several hikers I would see over the rest of the first week. I hit it off with one in particular...Roy from Morehead City.NC. Roy is thru hiking. There also was Jen/ Soda Pop from Louisville out with her partner, Skittles, who is a faster hiker and already ahead. They too started in Damascus and will be on the trail for four weeks before heading back to jobs at UPS. Everyone except Roy left to go on. I sheltered for the night. Roy tented.

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/493901,"(One word describes the next 4 days: brutal)Roy, with about 6 weeks of hiking under his belt, decided to stick with me (me,with only 9 miles under my belt) this day. Roy and I have really hit it off during our stay at Saunders. We are close to the same age and share a lot of interests. I was honored when he, obviously ready to hike much faster and further than me, wanted to stick with me so we could talk more. Roy is from Morehead City, NC. ...yes my friends a Duke fan too. He's not really a,basketball fan. His Duke connection is not sports so much as care his wife and family got during an extended illness.The day began well as we basically hiked parallel to the Creeper Trail and even on it for a short while. Our journey this day would take us over a 2000 foot climb and a 5000 foot one to the top of White Top Mountain. Roy was content to follow me at my pace for most of the day. We talked and hiked. Well on the climbs he talked...not me. I was doing good just to keep breathing and not stopping every 20 yards to recover before moving on. Roy moved ahead just before the 5000 foot climb up White Top. At the start of the climb as I exited a cow pasture there was Roy resting and waiting for me. After the climb yesterday up from Damascus and the previous 2000 footer earlier today, I was not real anxious to tackle this one. No choice as there were few camp sites and less water sources until the top. Roy quickly moved out of sight. Several hours later and almost totally wiped out I reached the top. A guy was there tenting and I was tempted to join him. Roy had asked him when he passed to encourage me to go the additional mile and a half. That encouraging word and news that the remaining distance was downhill boosted me. Almost at the campsite was a wonderful spring...piped and easy to refill. Nothing like cold mountain water to quench thirst after a long hot day. I arrived at camp and set up right before a brief rain. Completely whipped and not a bit of appetite from the day's exertion, I hit the sack. I had started the day at 7:30 am and made it to camp at 7:30 pm. A brutal day for the second day. Harder I think than any day in Georgia last year. Tomorrow's planned miles were going to have to be reduced for recovery. Blessings, Logman","Saunders Shelter

Rogers is the highest mountain in Virginia. It will be all downhill from here...ha. Since miles today would be low I took them slow. Although a short hike, I was anxious to get over Rogers and into the Grayson Highlands. They are reputed to be one of the most beautiful and enjoyable areas on the AT. Home to friendly and maybe too friendly wild ponies and stunning landscape and views.Roy left camp a few minutes before I did. Since he hikes faster it was a bit sad as I may not see him again. He is getting off the trail in mid May to visit with his girlfriend so maybe I can catch up with him again. The trail up was rocky but nice with enough switchbacks that hiking was relatively easy. The AT does not go to the peak but skirts around near it as we move north. A side trail to the top signals me that I'm only about 2 tenths of a mile from the Thomas Knob Shelter and the end of hiking for the day.Breaking out of the forest onto open vista is grand. Immediately I see the first ponies and a foal nursing right on the AT and by a marker. (See pictures section) It's only about noon and with the broad view I see rain clouds on the way. Good time to be stopping early at a shelter. When I arrive a lot of hikers have congregated. Odd that few seemed to pass me and many were not at my previous campsite. Roy had stopped and was just about to leave but a chance for a final goodbye. Soon after my arrival hikers who would be staying the night began to arrive. First was Dave/ Fisher king who SOBO'ed in 2003. Very nice guy out for only a few days. He was a wealth of good information and even carried garbage out for us. Arriving early we had lots of time to talk. Six guys from Alabama arrived. One actually a native of Louisville, teased another of the group of being a Travolta. And by golly that guy did really resemble the actor. I took a picture without trying to be obvious about it. Another guy, Justin and his dog, Jesse were also there. Justin is out for a month and like me he started in Damascus.I had not eaten last night so first thing I cooked and ate last night's dinner. A must to try and regain energy lost yesterday.

Anxious to see how much I recovered and get on with getting in hiking condition. It's much easier to get an early start from a shelter because there is no tent to load. I really like the first 3 hours in the morning. The forest is quiet and there is a better chance to see wildlife. During these early hours I pray and praise the Lord for his help as I hike. No better place than in the midst of creation. Shortly after leaving the shelter and at the gate...yes gate entering the Highlands I came upon Skittles and Soda Pop who hammock and we're stopped at the gate because there is no camping in the Highlands. The hiking here includes several stints going over rocky ridges into mountain valleys and vistas. Always the ponies are around. And not really wild at all. I soon pass through ""the scales"" a large fenced corral where annually some of the ponies are checked by veterinarians and sold. One good thing about reaching the scales, which the AT goes right through, is that there is a compost toilet and garbage can. These are almost luxuries. After the three previous three days of climbing, today's route ended with the last few miles downhill to the campsite. We did get some rain today but nothing major. At the,camp it was Skittles and Soda Pop, me and a guy who came in late sick and who set up and stayed in his tent.

Climbing right off the start today was good to get me warmed up in the cool morning. Hiking was great...nice trail and not to rocky. By lunch I had reached a road crossing before the last climb leading to the planned stop. It was just close enough to Marion so reach there timely. And by now the cool morning had transformed into a hot day.

Probably the prettiest I've seen so far since Damascus. See picture. Hiking was easy today and I made better time than expected arriving at Partnership Shelter 30 minutes faster than expected. Justin and Jesse were there and had secured our ride into Marion. Again more trail magic from a former hiker. Once in town we had to wait awhile for our room. We had arrived too early for it but too late for me to retrieve my mail drop from the PO. It closed at noon on Saturday. What a bummer. Now leaving town on Monday gets complicated and delayed. That will likely result in a short day on Monday. After long showers and some equipment cleaning we headed to lunch/dinner and the much needed laundromat. Food was had at a fine Mexican restaurant...of course after 6 days on the trail any food would be fine. Marion is a long town. It was a long walk to food and laundry. More magic at the laundry.

It opened at 9 and I was in and out in about 25 minutes to catch the bus on it's return to the motel. One interesting thing is that Marion provides bus service to and from the AT three times a day during the week. And hear this...it's only 50 cents!

That was about all we could hope for after our 11:30 start.We arrived at Chatfield about 5 pm. Several others were there already, including Mr. Don. He is a very interesting guy from Maine. One of several I have met already from Maine. Another is Sam I am who showed me a picture from his house of Mt. Kahtadin. He's really walking home.

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/495909,"After rain last night it was slow getting packed and started today. I really needed to hike long today so as to catch up with my hoped for schedule. Well to stay close to it as possible. Leaving from a shelter, especially after rain, is much easier and faster than having to repack a wet tent. I was underway shortly after 6:00 am. First stop, 4.4 miles away was Atkins,VA. The AT passes right through this little town, which is famous on the AT for the hiker friendly Barn Restaurant. I hoped to get there for a late breakfast or early lunch. And a hot meal in any event. I arrived and had a cheese omelet with sausage, chocolate milk and a biscuit. (I can almost hear my bride saying that all I talk about is food.)By the time I finished Justin and Jesse, slow starters in the am, had arrived. Justin desperately needed more fue, which he had forgotten in Marion. Unfortunately none was to be found. He settled on a can of Sterno in hopes that would suffice. Jesse the beagle causes Justin the hiker problems at such places as restaurants. I watched Jesse while Justin ordered a sandwich to go. After that we headed out of town around 11:00 for another 12 miles. Justin wanted to go even further to make Pearisburg a day earlier. For me at my pace that is still about a week away. As man and dog moved ahead I was a bit sad because I might not see them again.Alone now for the rest of the day I enjoyed a day of wonderful grasslands, many of which the AT crosses private land, and scenic vistas of the mountain range of western VA. As the day progressed and I grew more weary every uphill was very laborious. 16 miles was going to take until darn close to 7:00 pm. Numerous fence stiles needed to be traversed. Think of a ladder up one side and down the other with a pack on. By the time I finally reached the Holston River and was just under 2 miles from the camping spot I was aiming for, just putting one foot in front of the other was tiring. Just on the other side of the river I passed Whisper and Drug Store, two very strong and young hikers from Portland, Ore. whom I have been leap frogging with for a few days now. They were moving on to the next shelter about 5 miles away. That is probably where Justin ended up. I was just about cooked and knew I had to reach camp soon. Just as the three of us got to the final fence stiles...wow trail magic. We sure hoped there was some left. And there was ! Several cans of Dr. Thunder! Never had heard of this before. Apparently the Wal-Mart version of Dr. Pepper. Given a choice I don't drink Dr. Pepper...but after 15 long miles on the AT with almost 2 to go, this stuff was awesome. And for some reason it reminded me of a recently deceased and colorful character from Newport...Johnny Thunder. My chosen camp site was near a road, which no one ever likes. And to boot a couple of local guys were nearby camping. I set up at almost dark and broke camp at 6 am to catch up with Justin and again hike long miles. Those other guys probably never even knew that I was there. All in all another good day on the AT. Blessings","Chatfield Shelter

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/495910,"Today's hike while several miles shorter than yesterday was just about as challenging. A lot of uphill through beautiful meadows. There was little opportunity for water resupply because the trail stayed mostly on the ridges. The final spring before the Shelter was almost two miles away. The process in such a situation is this: load your bottles and then load yourself. And you also need to make sure you have enough water for getting to the campsite, for dinner and until you reach the next spring to refill.A lot of hikers collected this day at Chestnut Knob Shelter. The reason is the awesome view of Burke's Garden. We have heard that many locals call it ""God's Thumbprint"". I set my tent so that I had an unobstructed view as I sat and basked in the warm sun. The Shelter is one of the few so far that is completely enclosed. And there is good reason. Constant wind holds the promise that tonight will be cold on the mountain. We had to go inside to cook and eat. My light weight sleeping bag would need help to keep me warm. Besides the view we could also get full cell phone reception! Yea. I could talk and text Cathy and others. A great day...talking to Cathy, a warm sunny day, with just enough breeze to not be hot and that view with a simple uplifting ok my head while sitting in the tent.When the sun started to set the wind picked up and the temperature started to plummet. Time to dress for bed in hopes of being warm enough to sleep. I would need it because tomorrow would be another long day. Bedtime is always early on the AT.

Justin is focused on getting to Pearisburg asap due in part to his fuel issue. I'm a little saddened as most likely our paths will not cross again. Best wishes to them. Well as it often goes this morning I got a new hiking partner as we both left the campsite at the same time. Ed ""Lost and Found"" Spoon is a retired game warden from Wisconsin and a native of Vermont. He, like Justin, is section hiking for 4 weeks. If we stick together I will be saying goodbye to him in a fee weeks. Unlike Justin who is 30 years my junior, Ed is only about 2 months younger. We should be a pretty good match.Our destination today is long but with much less uphill than yesterday. For the first several miles we traveled the rim of Burke's Garden before dropping down as the trail went gradually down. Not that going down means no uphill or that going down is all that easy. Downhills, especially long sustained ones, put a lot of pressure on knees and ankles. And a pack with weight don't make it easier.A few miles from camp we were caught by Silent, a hiker from Israel. Silent was fit and moving fast and like his trail name didn't have much to say. That would change. Right before camp we crossed a bridge over Laurel Creek. Laurel Creek is more like a river with a lot of water moving fast clear and cold. Justlike a mountain stream should. As we crossed the bridge there was Silent across the road on the other side signaling us were to go! Nice because it was a little confusing. As we all set up camp Silent began to talk. Seems they don't have skunks in Israel! He met one today. And the outcome was apparent, but thankfully for him and us the skunk had a bad aim! Silent had gotten after it with the sticks he was using to walk with after losing his store bought ones. As for the sticks at the water source for this campsite he found two trekking poles left there by some other unfortunate hiker. We had to assure him that it was ok for him to take them. Very good honest guy. That goes to figure as we learned that prior to his current work flipping apartments in Tel Aviv, Silent had been a lieutenant in the Israeli Army. He had seen service in all the hot spots we have heard of...Gaza, the Left Bank and the Lebanon border.During camp setup we also were blessed with another camper. Grease, a 2014 thru hiker, stopped by with goodies. And to my amazement he had Ale 8 1. Turns out he is from Dayton Ohio and currently an medical student at Wright State University and had attended EKU. Hence the Ale 8 1. Besides drink he brought us fruit and beer. Very nice guy who also provided us with good information for the trail ahead.Again looking forward to a good night sleep after a long day of hiking.

This short section into Bland was very nice trail. Perhaps the best so far. Well maintained and relatively free of rocks. At the road into Bland Lost and Found and I were successful in getting a hitch into town. That is,after about a dozen vehicles just whizzed past nary even glancing in our direction. Our benevolent driver dropped us off at the PO where Lost and Found had a mail drop. Also there waiting for them to open after lunch break were two other hikers - Moss and Dream Crusher along with Moss's dog Disco.

At the motel and in the whole town there were not any laundry services. Big Walker accommodated hand washing in the room sinks by providing a clothes line. Great...our clothes were 3 plus days dirty and rain on the way. Drying them so we could get going in the morning was the challenge. Man did we get a lot of crud out by hand. Restaurant options were few. The only none chain one was way back in town near the PO. We got a ride there. The redeeming factor for the little place attached to a Sunoco Station was a large salad. My main course of a ground beef steak was well...bland. Then another 1 mile walk to the motel and work drying clothes. Back at the motel we reconnected with Skittles and Soda Pop, the two women from Louisville who we had gotten ahead of a few days back.

The climb out Bland was not too bad as the drop off from the shuttle was up in the mountains above town. We actually had a bit of a road walk over I-77 before getting back to the woods.

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/497025,"For me today's target was to get within an easy hike of the Woods Hole Hostel. That means approximately 7 miles or so. The challenge today includes few places to reload with water. Weather has been warm and uphill efforts require much more water than along other terrain. I also wanted to avoid the Wapiti Shelter due to its past history. Even though it's been moved much deeper into the woods a multiple murder there in the early 1980's is still yucky to me. Also as noted previously Lost and Found was hesitant about a 13 mile day. As our day went on it appeared obvious to us both that we had to make the Wapiti Shelter at the least. Once there we were glad for the effort. Good water, close to the only climb tomorrow heading to Woods Hole, and several interesting hikers there. First and foremost was Moss, Dream Crusher and their dog Disco. We had first seen these guys at the PO in Bland. And then there was Flash and Geography grad student heading to Vancouver for his PhD. We had a lot in common to talk about. Also there was Trixie and her dog Gertrude a blood hound. They camped way away from the rest of us. Her reputation has preceded her up the trail. Rightly or wrongly she has the idea she and her dog are not real welcomed. Sorta sad. She seems OK to me and she puts in awesome mileage.A long day but got in to the Shelter with a lot of daylight remaining and enough time to collect water, set up tents, cook and eat and to bed early.

When I arrived at the crossing Moss and Dream Crusher along with Lost and found were there. Moss and Dream Crusher had already been to the hostel, grabbed a smoothie and were heading back out. As I arrived the three were closely observing a ""wild boar "". I carefully took a couple of pictures and headed straight down the mountain to Woods Hole. I wanted a smoothie! Neville and Michael the proprietors have a wide reputation for their hospitality and meals. As I ascended the driveway Neville who was on the front porch painting new signs asked if I wanted a smoothie and /or a fresh loaf of bread. She must have read my mind...both please. Next I confirmed that I would join them for dinner and breakfast before heading back out tomorrow. I was shown to the bunkhouse and where to shower and bring dirty clothes for washing.And that ""wild boar"" it was just one of the pigs from Woods Hole. Neville immediately got into a four wheeler to herd it back home. We wondered why it calmly let us take pictures.We had been rained on during the night so tent drying was the first order of business after showers. The rest of the afternoon we repacked clean, clothes and dry tents. And of course the mandatory lounging to let hiking legs recover.At 7:00 the dinner bell rang. Neville's meals are made primarily with organically grown ingredients from the hostel garden and ours was preceeded by a great salad and as much fresh bread as we wanted. The main course was vegetable soup and dessert was ice cream. Two other hikers there who were working for keep helped with the cooking and other chores. Pork Chop had been there a week and was heading out tomorrow. Casper had been there a month and didn't seem interested in leaving at all. Interesting is that Neville and Michael asked if any of us would like to stay for a few days to help with farm chores. None of our group did, but later on I would meet a few considering going back to help out.Like most major stops along the AT, a reunion of sorts takes place as we hikers gather. It's a bit amazing that no matter how slow I am in relation to others, I continue to meet up with faster hikers at these stops. For example, here was China Rock, a young lady from Austin, Texas by way of China who I last saw at the Chestnut Knob Shelter on May 13 and who only stopped for a meal before moving on.

We both wanted to get there before the PO closed as we had mail drops waiting. For the last several days the AT has certainly lived up to it's other name the ""Green Tunnel"". That means the trail while always near the edge of a view does not often break out onto an opening to afford us one. Last year one trait I really thrived on was that most hard long climbs ended with an awesome view. In Virginia this is not the case. For me this has made the climbs over the last couple of weeks a little more difficult.Today's hike was nice until we actually had to go down the mountain to Pearisburg. The trail down was steep and slippery n several spots. I fell once and the shifting of my stuff in the pack caused the zipper I thought I had repaired at Wapiti Shelter to explode. Not good! Luckily when my water filter fell out I heard it and stopped to make emergency repair. Now in town I would have a new problem to resolve. Once at the road into Pearisburg we still had just over a mile to walk. Such a road walk on a hot day is not too fun. First you are down the mountain which is warmer and add to that the open asphalt ribbon and it gets hot fast. And oh yes...there is still that pack on your back.In town I passed the motel on the way to the PO so I dropped off my pack and rushed to get my mail drop. Hurrying back to the motel I called my outfitter to determine options for my pack zipper. Regardless of other options I would need to find some large safety pins to hold me over until professional repairs could be made. My pack with a lifetime warranty is great unless you are actually out using it. I made contact with the manufacturer who assured me the warranty would remain and I could do anything necessary to keep going with the pack.Lost and Found and me were joined by Walnut, who like us is retired, for dinner at the local Pizza Hut. While the food was cooking I ran next door to Dollar General for safety pins. After dinner it was back to the motel to get ready to leave town tomorrow. After today it would be maybe up to 9 days until the next stay in town and my next mail drop.""Hiker"" motels along the AT are a thing to behold. Most,are very basic and provide all we need.

The ride would be most appreciated as we would not have to re-walk the 1 mile road back to the AT.After we mailed forward our boxes we headed to Hardee's. There just as he promised we found Bob with his friends. A nice group of people. We probably hung out there almost an hour before loading into Bob's van. The wait included time for Lost and Found to pull one of my favorite tricks...sitting my pace down on my water tube spout and leaking water all over the place. This is not good on the trail as loosing valuable water can be a problem. And gee can it spew fast! In Hardee's it made a huge mess on the floor. In just seconds Lost and Found spilled a liter! After cleanup we headed back to the trail with our new friend...Mr. Bob Leece of Pearisburg, VA. Back to the water issue. Today began with the usual climb back up into the beautiful mountains of western VA. The trail up had been re-routed and was a long but gradual slope. Very nice and with a few views back to Pearisburg. One issue was however that the first shelter was waterless. What that meant was a long hot climb using plenty of water along the way and then needing to add a few more miles after to find resupply. A day like this also means carrying more water..the heaviest component in the pack.At Rice Field Shelter we were surprised by a most unexpected reunion. As Lost and I sat resting before moving on to water and our campsite...up on the picnic table jumps one happy little beagle named Jesse. We thought for sure that Justin and Jesse had moved ahead of us in Pearisburg. It would be great being together tonight. At the Rice Field Shelter the AT overlooks West Virginia. The trail will not actually enter West Virginia until much further north near Harper's Ferry.","Pearisburg VA

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/497526,"Awoke this morning to certain rain. Lost and Found and me hustled to break camp and pack up. There is great advantage to this...no wet tent to carry or to dry out tonight. I just got the pack cover on as the rain came. Believe it or not this would end up being the longest I've hiked in rain on the AT. Thankfully it was also cool to cold at times so we did not bake wearing raincoats and pants. At one point Lost and Found pulled out gloves to stave off some of the chill. Ugh! I had just bounced mine forward at Pearisburg! I was just a little envious.The trail today alternated between ridges where the wind at times was really chilly and down slope where the mountain provides some wind protection. As the name should imply our destination was low and we had started the day high. Lots of potential to slip today as we negotiated the downhills. Actually the hiking today was good, even in the rain. By the time we reached the Shelter rain had stopped and the sun was trying to make an appearance. Too bad we were down in a rather narrow valley. That necessitated sharing sun space to dry rain gear, socks and boots.Pine Swamp did not have very many tent sites. Luckily our early start got us there nearly first and we got to pick our sites. Lost and Found does that practically before he takes his pack off. A very good practice.Back in Bland we had learned of a large family hiking the entire AT together. Parents and 10 children. Earlier we had not had time to actually talk to them much. Well today it ended up that they too were stopping at this shelter for the night. They arrived in two's and three's and once there dominated the Shelter space. They are an extremely close family and I'm guessing range in ages from 9 or ten to young adults. We heard that two waited to join the rest after school was out. Might be college students. The Dad, a doctor on sabbatical, goes by the trail name Simple Man. I was impressed when one of the daughters told me they only hike 6 days a week and honor the Sabbath every Friday/Saturday by getting off the trail.The group goes by the name ""The Biff Network"" with their mascot being a rubber chicken that Simple Man carries. Most impressive and a little daunting is that the lot of them hike about 20 miles per day! At Pine Swamp we got some clues to how they operate. Each one has daily chores that seem related to what each carries during the day. With so many in the group pack weight can be distributed. My guess is that none of them carry more than 25 lbs.They sure do dominate a shelter. Other hikers who had shared camp with the group previously noted that other hikers had become a bit concerned about this. Thankfully most of my wet clothes dried enough before bedtime so that I could get them inside my tent in case it rains again. Blessings,","Campsite North of Rice Field Shelter

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/497527,"My mileage goal today was predicated on trying to get far enough today to make a high location tomorrow for cell phone reception. So far Virginia has not been the best for phone calls. And tomorrow is an important one for me. Our family with the help of our dear friends Val and Rich Livingood were throwing a surprise 60th birthday party for Cathy.Lost and Found was not wanting quite the miles I wanted. After a rain day today dawned nice. Early on the miles were relatively easy as the trail stayed down for a few miles before heading back up into the mountains. Relatively easy did not apply once the trail started on the grade back up. It seems like we hiked forever on rocks of every description. Real ankle twisters...not to mention tough on knees and even poles. Real surprised that I didn't bend them the wrong way...both knees and poles.Fittingly on the top we were rewarded by views from Wind Rock. Shortly after Wind Rock Lost and Found stopped for the day. I proceeded another few miles to the next shelter. I was the first to arrive and so got first choice of tent sites. Before long others began arriving and by dark the place was full.My plan for tomorrow was to be up and out very early. The goal was to find cell reception on one of the two mountains I would climb. To bed early was easier said than done. Most of the young hikers stayed up very late and filtering out the noise was not easy.Tomorrow is a big day. Can't hardly wait!Blessings,","Pine Swamp Shelter

And if I went to the second mountain I would be pressed for time and faced with a difficult climb.The day started with a steep, rocky climb. Being fresh I made good time. Once at the top I would begin checking for cell service. Turns out today would start with a surprise. At the top of that first climb was....TRAIL MAGIC! ! There to greet me, the first hiker up today, was Super Dave with donuts, soda and hot dogs. Super Dave is a former thru hiker from nearby Blacksburg, Virginia. All trail magic is good. One thing we hikers never get enough of is food. One just can't carry enough to fully replenish the calories burned.Well at the top of that first mountain I began testing cell service. I got good results for texting but questionable for talk. As I went over the top stopping quite often I got feeling desperate as the next mountain was a lot of hiking and several hours away. Praise the Lord...on the way down and just past the crest was success! And conveniently to mark the spot was a downed tree across the trail. Next would be the next shelter to await 5 o'clock my time to call in to the party. It wasn't even lunch time yet so there would be plenty of time to kill.It was a 30 minute hike down to Laurel Creek Shelter. That would probably compute to 40 to 45 minutes back up this evening. Once again I was first to the Shelter. At least first of those who would stay the night.At the Shelter several just stopped by for lunch. One, Psych is a very young recovering alcoholic. He is 5 years clean and only 24. Psych is stopping and attending an AA meeting in every city he hikes through or to along the AT. Stopping by for the night were two women, close but not to close in age to me and Lost and Found. Food Truck, from Virginia and SheWe from Colorado. Like Lost and Found and me they had met hiking the AT this year. At approximately 4pm I would begin my trek back to my calling spot. Time came and off I went with only my town pack with battery pack, water and rain coat just in case.It only took about 20 minutes to get back up. What a difference it makes not carrying weight. My understanding of the plan to surprise Cathy was that she would arrive at 4.30. When I called the surprise had already happened. And pulled off with magnificent success by Sandahl, Marina, Jeff and the Livingoods. To all I can't say thank you enough..for helping, for attending and just being there for her.

By day's end yesterday Lost and Found was also at this Shelter. Today the geography would begin with low elevations before heading up to rocky ridges. The AT goes through a lot of private property here in Virginia. We must pass through numerous fence stiles that keep livestock in their fields. The trail in these instances is usually only a narrow path through tall grass. Tick heaven. And Praise the Lord none on me yet. Today once we got up the trail was quite challenging. Lots of slanted rock ledges above long drop offs...certainly dangerous if one is careless. Slow going for me.After the first climb I stopped to rest and check for phone signal and messages. What I got really made my day! A video of my granddaughter taking about 4 steps. Aubrey it's about time to hike. Your first boots are mine to buy. Man oh man did that make my day.

Today I started out with getting there before 10 as my goal. It was about 5 miles from our campsite and doable. Also the sooner that I could get there the longer I could hang out and still be on target to reach Daleville and a much needed zero day on Thursday /Friday.I did arrive about 9:45 to a flock of other hikers and wonderful volunteers helping provide the magic here now for 8 years. Included was Justin and Jesse the beagle. They had arrived yesterday and camped here to partake over two days. The trail up the mountain today was very very nice. That meaning well maintained and with gentle slopes and switch backs. Hiking as noted was fast. Audie Murphy the WWII hero, died on this mountain in a plane crash. None of us could think of a more appropriate place to be visiting on Memorial Day 2015.From the Memorial the three musketeers and a beagle took off together. Justin who was well rested hiked on when Lost and Found and me stopped. We did however sort of pair up with two women, Food Truck and SheWe, whom we had met at the Laurel Creek Shelter. Together we all wanted to camp somewhere beyond the next shelter for as short of hike as possible to VA 624 where a store/deli is located just .3 from the trail. For me this was important because I need a few supplies to get me into Daleville 3 days away.Bugs and bites really stink. Maybe my day off in a few days will help.Blessings,","Niday Shelter

I was hiking maybe 20 to 30 minutes before the others this morning. Really wanted to make miles to that store. In total we were looking for about 14 miles today. With that mileage I couldn't dilly dally at the store. I only needed some breakfast food and a few snacks. And I would eat lunch there.When we stopped yesterday we guesstimated that Dragon's Tooth was only about a mile away. From there it was just a couple of miles to the road. I think we were wrong by about a mile. Additionally, the trail was rocky and going slow the closer I got. Dragon's Tooth is a stone monolith visible for miles as it sits on the mountain top. Once there the trail down the mountain was more climbing than hiking for quite a distance. There were even steel bars in a couple of places to assist. Going down with a pack was tricky. Going south or up would really be challenging. I got to the store just before noon. For lunch I ordered a ham sandwich. Soon other hikers arrived. The place is really nice for somewhere to get real food and simple resupply items. The day was getting hot fast and concerns about water supply after the next road crossing were significant. A southbounder warned that no water was available until about 5 miles beyond the next road. For us that meant about a 17 mile day.Once at the road, VA 311, I was beat and so was Lost and Found. My idea was to shuttle back to the road with the store and stay at the hostel. That way we would be fresh tomorrow for the stretch with questionable water and still on schedule for Daleville in 2 days. Also on the plus side was a shower and laundry. For me it has been 8 days since laundry and 7 since a shower. Clothes were stiff and I had the ""hiker smell"". Also at the road was more trail magic. This time by my new friends from Louisville, Skittles and Soda Pop. They were done with their section hike and we're paying back before heading home. Hot dogs, cold drinks, chips and other goodies were consumed before we secured a ride back to the hostel. The ride was compliments of Bruce a Trail maintenance volunteer who knowing of the water situation heading north had brought water to VA 311.At the hostel we pitched tents, showered, gave laundry to be washed and then driven back to that little store for dinner.

McAfee Knob would be first up followed by Tinker Cliffs. McAfee is the most photographed location on the entire AT. Lots and Found am I were pleased with the trail going up to McAfee from VA 311. This route was obviously the way day hikers went to McAfee. It was well used and of gentle grade for the most part. Within yards of McAfee Lost and Found, in the lead as usual, hollered in a somewhat hushed tone...""bear"". On the trail ahead was our first bear of the journey this year. It wandered off before we could get pictures. It did not run off, indicating it probably did not see us. Moving slowly ahead we could hear it. Soon we saw it not more than 100 yards off the trail. Cameras already out we photographed it. My shot got the subject on all fours. Immediately thereafter it rose on hind legs, an awesome sight, to check us out. Lost and Found got that photo. (See photo in gallery)McAfee Knob and the views from it are just absolutely awesome! The promontory point off it is the one photo everyone hiking the AT wants. I'm thankful this day was a good weather day. We hung out there about one hour before heading on. Further on we would come to Tinker Cliffs a location that one can look back and see McAfee as it projects from the mountain it's on. It was not easy to distinguish but enlarging the photo on my phone it could be correctly identified.Next stop Lamberts Meadows campsite but first we had to once again descend the mountain we were on. For the last few days the descents have been tough. Many steep and hard on feet, knees and ankles. Down to Pearisburg and from Dragon's Tooth being notable. Once down we found a really good and large area along a Creek for camping. It was not really a meadow. We shared a site with two southbound section hikers, Tree Hugger and Brave Mouse. They are both librarians front Fredericksburg, VA. Tomorrow after a good night of rest we will head into Daleville. I sure need a day off.

Once down the trail wanders a bit before crossing a railroad track and popping out on the main road. Howard Johnson was literally only about 200 yards from the trailhead. And next door on the way was a gas station/convenient store where a cold drink could be secured.

After showers, laundry, and a trip to the local outfitter for fuel and a valve for my platypus water bottle tube, it was dinner.

Several hikers stopped to rest before moving on. Eventually 6 of us were there for the night. Two interesting young guys were: Power House and Castaway (complete with Wilson).

Early on was a very important water stop as there were few today before my stopping location. Already there and filling up was Castaway. He too had left early. He is fast and puts in long miles. Most likely I will not see him again.The hike today was nice as the trail was already up in the mountains. Once at the Blue Ridge Parkway I suddenly felt bad...real tired and blah. I had eaten good, slept well last night but really felt drained. Hiking south and slack packing was a guy...Ben Jolly from Texas who I had first met at the Four Pines Hostel and was staying in Daleville. He had tried a thru hike in 2007 and failed due to trying too many miles per day. Close to my age he had taken 2 zeros in Daleville and suggested that I might want to shuttle back to there and take another before heading on north. Better to be slow than have to get off altogether.After continuing on for a while longer I took the advice. Met a guy, David, a recent transplant from New York out giving water to hikers who offered to take me back to Daleville. Being just whipped like I was reminded me of experience cycling when I would head out feeling fine but immediately loose energy. It took years but I learned how my body felt and when to push through and when to just call it quits and go home. Today I think the same happened in hiking.

I learned some time ago that hikers are athletes. And I knew from experience that much of what I learned from cycling and other athletic endeavors was adaptable. For example: is you are warm within the first mile you have too many clothes on. Well today nothing in that experience helped me. I totally did not expect to be almost too fatigued to hike further. Yesterday was a good day so why today turned bad after only about 8 miles is a mystery. Ben Jolly a hiker I had met in Daleville came by as I was resting and hoping to continue on. He provided sound advice...to save your hike get back to Daleville and take another zero. At the next gap I met a local man out assisting hiker with water and fruit. Thankfully he was there because phone service was not. For free he took me back to Daleville. The funny thing was that he was a new resident of the area and was not sure if he knew where Daleville was. Well needless to say he got me there and back to the Howard Johnson that I had left two days ago. A bit bummed but after a good discussion with Cathy I think I was soothed. Well feeling better sort of. Cathy had asked if part of the issue may be mental. At first I thought not, but after further consideration probably yes.

And it was not a light rain, very persistent an windy rain. In the forest wind and rain seem worse because of the water blowing of the trees. My goal today, if possible, was to be the first in at the Shelter so as to get a choice spot. Very necessary because it would be packed. Next to a side wall is great because only one person is next to you. For some reason starting a day of hiking in the rain was not too bad. It was unseasonably cool so wearing a raincoat was not too bad, even with a fair amount of climbing. Less than 1/4 mile from the Shelter I came upon a blow down, a big pine tree to high to just step over and with many broken tree branch stubs that could do damage if I slipped. I made it ok, but a few days layer word came forward that a hiker, Yoda a retired Army Ranger, had fallen and needed to be rescued. That's sad news for all us hikers, even those like me who did not know him. AT hikers are family. Several miles into my day I met a southbounder, trail name Circuit Rider. Circuit Rider is a Baptist pastor from upper Michigan who spends 6 months each year along the AT. He was currently participating in a revival in Daleville and taking short day hikes. He prayed for things bothering me. I was both grateful and had a bit more bounce thereafter. He was a real cool guy who I would like to talk to more. And he reminded me of someone. I just couldn't figure out who.Today the trail went up to an FAA radar station on Thunder Ridge before heading down to the Shelter of the same name. The trail was within about 50 yards of the station which was barely visible through the clouds/fog. The trail down included the Guillotine. That was the easy part...mud and wet grass made every step down an adventure. I did make the Shelter first and set up next to one side wall. I used my rope to rig a clothesline. Socks, raincoat and pack cover were hung up. Dry jacket and rain pants on to help dry t-shirt and shorts /underwear. And of course actually drying in these conditions is virtually impossible. Importantly though is I got warm. Stopping after hiking for hours in rain is painful because you immediately get bone chilling cold. And that needs to be remedied fast to avoid hypothermia. Unlike the last shelter this only held 6. That means hat many arriving here will be setting up in the rain. Praise the Lord it's not me...yet. I'm sure my turn will come.Tonight next to me are a mother/ daughter pair. Wistful (mother) and Relentless (daughter) from Austin. TX by way of Germany. They mostly talked in German to each other.

And if the title of this entry does clue you in...it was still raining! And it did until late after and then was off and on until dark.Hiking was gloomy. Nothing to see beyond the forest. See picture. However as I walked and prayed this morning it dawned on me that I enjoy very much hiking through what I think represents the best of God's natural creation...the forest. That said I should also enjoy being there when He provides the nourishment the forest needs...rain. Without rain the forest will in turn not provide us other things we needs in addition to recreation. As I was considering such things who do I see again, and again hiking south toward me...Circuit Rider. He was out again hiking a section. I shared with him what I had been thinking. And again our short talk was uplifting for me. Something about him I really like. And now here is a tidbit, maybe only odd. It took me asking a,lot of other hikers if they had met Circuit Rider before finding one who did. This is very unusual as he was hiking south when almost everyone else is NOBO. A lot of us should have met him. Hmmm.Once at Matt's Creek most other hikers went on past because it was only two more miles and a 5 mile hitch to town and food, laundry and resupply. And the main draw there was a city owned park providing free camping with a pavilion. And with the rain this was a good destination. At the shelter we had a good group. Brewery, a southbounder headed to the Smokies before heading back to school. Cowboy, from Arizona sporting a cowboy hat thus his trail name.

Everything was wet including most if not all of my equipment. This morning my big decision would be whether or not to bring out dry socks or just use wet ones for a second full day. Now for you all reading this that might not sound too important. Let me explain. Hiking in wet socks is not good on the feet. Blisters and other nasty things can happen. Pulling out dry ones is ok if it does not rain and/or if the wet ones might dry during the day. Socks are commonly attached to the outside of the pack for this purpose, but today they would be covered by the pack cover just in case the rain continues. With a hostel stop one day away I risked using the dry socks. They sure felt better and we're better for my feet. Early on we had a touch of rain but then clearing. Praise the Lord!After a quick first two miles, flat and along the James River we arrived at the famous James River Footbridge. It's a tradition to jump off this. It's also illegal. Already damp from days of rain jumping was not even considered and would not have been regardless. Many others did. Just after the bridge we began a long climb back up to the mountains.

A nearby pond offered music in the form of bullfrogs, and water supply. Off the trail a bit further than usual I wondered if I might be there alone. I was surprised to be able to make phone contact with Cathy. A pond located near the Shelter provided an opening in the forest so perhaps that helped. Eventually I was joined by four others.

We stayed down low or just along hillside contours all day. Absolutely beautiful streams and moving water. For a couple of miles the AT skirted along a reservoir complete with large dam, boats and fishermen. Still too high above to actually see detail but nice view through the trees. At one point an information sign and bench to sit on (very unusual on the AT so far) told about a small community once here occupied by decedent's of freed slaves. Dismantled when the forest service purchased the property in the 1920's one can still make out remains of buildings and fences in the forest.The target today is US 60, a major road and where phone service would be available for connecting with the hostel. Approaching I could hear traffic for about 30 minutes before ever seeing the road.Interesting is that this same US 60 also is Frankfort Avenue in Louisville going through the Crescent Hill neighborhood where I grew up. Upon arrival I called Three Springs Hostel and would have to wait only about 30 minutes for pickup. A free service they provide from this location. Having been without phone service for several days I took the opportunity to try a few calls while I waited. At Three Springs there would be no cell service but the price includes the use of the house phone for long distance calls.Oma, owner/operator of Three Springs arrived and I was off to a much needed rest, shower (never have needed or wanted one worse) and laundry. Those wet socks from two days ago were nasty, nasty, nasty. Actually in Waynesboro a day or two from now they will be replaced. Oma really has a nice business model for this hostel. Very hiker friendly because her passion is helping hikers. Just two years in business. She moved to these mountains from the Virginia tidewater specifically to open a hostel. The single price includes shower, laundry, fantastic dinners and breakfast, very comfortable accommodations as only 6 are here at a time, and the aforementioned phone service.After the long awaited shower I tossed my very dirty, stinky clothes into the washing machine. That felt good. Next was drying the rest of my gear. Dinner tonight will be grilled burgers, salad, potato salad, tea, and for dessert, brownies and ice cream. Oma baked the brownies this afternoon soon after I arrived. The smell of baking brownies was almost overwhelming. Mmm!Dinner was at 7. Afterwards plans were made for tomorrow morning's shuttles. Some of use were slack packing, others just getting back to trailheads where we had come in. Upon counsel with two new friends, Ben Jolly and Doc 13 and with assistance from Oma, I decided to do my first slack pack heading south. This accommodated both me and Uncle D. We would be taken north to Spy Rock. Uncle D would hike north from where he stopped today and I will hike south back to US 60. For me it would be a 17 mile day...doable with only the necessary things in a small and borrowed pack.Excited for tomorrow to see how I manage a long day without my full pack.Blessings,","Punchbowl Shelter

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/499682,"Slack Packing = borrowing a day pack + carrying only essentials for one day (water, water filter, snacks /lunch, camera, cell phone, raincoat, and sticks. This means a faster and longer than usual hiking. Today my miles would be 17. And as I mentioned yesterday I would be hiking south. Into the wind so to speak of most others who today will be covering the same route but north. Doc 13 was shuttled to US 60 to head north. After a 30 minute or so ride, Uncle D and me were dropped off at Spy Rock Road. We had a mile hike up to the AT from the drop off. Once hiking I guesstimated that Doc and I would connect during hour 4. One advantage of me walking south was that the long uphill from US 60 would be a downhill for me and theoretically faster. What I didn't account for when estimating my pickup time was meeting almost everyone I had met over the last two weeks as they too, like Doc, we're heading north. So a 20 minute lunch with Doc and a few minutes with many others added up. I ended up arriving about 40 minutes late.The hiking was sweet! Amazing how light I felt and how much I didn't get fatigued. Just shows how much pack weight means. Trail wise today's route was nice. Not very many views out of the Tunnel but pretty nonetheless. The one large bald, see picture, was reminiscent of those in Tennessee and North Carolina. Nice views and since it was Sunday a lot of day hikers were out too. After arriving back at Three Springs Hostel I was able to shower and wash my clothes again. Doing so two consecutive days may not happen again on this journey. Due to being busy today with shuttles Oma brought in pizza. She made a salad to go with it and of course the homemade dessert. Enough food for all.This night at the hostel there were 4 new face in addition to Uncle D and me. Splash and Smoke, a mother and son duo from Indiana, Ghost Hiker from Tennessee and Mama Moab and her so called service dog from Ohio. Smoke is a recent ""retiree"" from service to our country with the Army. I don't think the dog being paraded as a service dog is one. Stories abound about hikers getting such certificates so as to be able to take their dogs through the Smokies and other places dogs are not allowed. Thankfully the dog was well behaved.Tomorrow I will ""bounce"" to Waynesboro for a zero and to assure that I make my much desired meet up with Jeff, Sandahl and Aubrey. Doing this will make the second section I will be making up before completing the AT. Blessings,","Spy Rock Road

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/501022,"I have decided to skip forward today. This is the second time since starting my journey to hike the AT that I have done this. I now will have two sections to make up. Moving forward any additional skipped sections north of Harper's Ferry become problematic. I think getting back to Tennessee (my first skip) will be easy. This skip will be more complicated but not too bad. Any others north an issue. During this trip I have met many hikers, mostly about my age, who had plans altered and took longer to complete the trail than initially anticipated. At this point I'm in that boat too. I skipped today to remain on my time schedule primarily due because my miles per day is well below what I thought they would be. And as you have read there have been days of rest that I needed over and above what was planned. Tomorrow will be another one of those. All this gets to me learning what it takes to ""hike my hike"" and continue to enjoy this experience. And that my friends is most important. As my friend Charlie Boles said before I started this year ""It's the journey, not the destination."" He is so right. And others in my age group are focused on that also. If this journey takes me longer so be it. I enjoy the wilderness, seeing what I see as I hike, and just being in the natural environment created for us.Right now I want to rest and be prepared to enter the Shenandoah National Park and meet up with Sandahl, Jeff and Aubrey in a few days. Wow, I am really excited to see them. We will spend about a day and a half together before they head on home from their vacation and I continue north.I really don't have a lot to do today in town as clothes are clean. The main thing is mail. I have items in my bounce box to mail home and then organize food for Shenandoah. And I would love to get a haircut! In closing this city is fantastic to hikers. Local citizens have created a network of volunteers to pick up hikers from Rock Fish Gap about five miles from town for FREE! A list is provided at the gap and many local businesses. They will also provide taxi service in town. A very nice touch appreciated by all of us.Blessings,","US 60/ Three Springs Hostel

After my little meltdown several days ago I want to be careful not to push too hard too fast. Looking back at my journal, the handwritten one I keep, I discovered I had gone 17 days without a day of rest. Bad idea. I should probably not go more than 7 or 8.Anyway today I rest and with only one chore...get a haircut. Barber Shop was just across the street from where I was staying. Does that feel good.

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/501024,"A bit of a late start today as we headed into the Shenandoah. Today would be short so no rush to get going early. The next campsite after the first one was too far anyway so our first day would be short. .The trail today was very unexciting. No views.Seems a lot of us took aim at this Shelter tonight. Shelter full when we arrived and just a few tent sites available. Taking most of the space was a scout troop out for a week. Nice young men and leaders from Lutheran Church sponsored troop.Also in camp tonight was a couple from New York...Dr. Pickles and Mockingbird whom we had become friends with. Together we hatched a plan for the next few days. The plan as one might guess was based on food and showers. Ben Jolly had prepared a schedule for the two of us that got me to Big Meadows by Sunday to meet up with Sandahl, Jeff and Aubrey. To do this he had a twenty mile day on Friday. That would be my longest ever on the AT. The new plan had us doing twenty tomorrow getting us to Loft Mountain Campsite the location of a wayside (restaurant) and showers. And for me that would be the twenty mile challenge early versus later when I would likely be more tired. Plan done...bedtime early. Really big and long day tomorrow.Blessings,","Waynesboro

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/501026,"Another day in the green tunnel. At least one view. See picture. Throughout the Shenandoah the AT criss-crosses the Skyline Drive rather frequently. The trail either seems to come down to it then it's back up the mountain or vice versa. Being a week day we hear traffic but see little at the road crossings. We left early and the first ten miles were not too bad for me. More of the green tunnel. As the day wore on and the heat rose and I tired...ugh. And of course Loft Mountain Campsite was on a mountain. Go figure it was a climb up. Mission accomplished...as I popped out of the forest using the trail connecting the AT to the campground, I saw none of my group waiting my arrival and no idea where or what to do to find them. Dead tired and just wanting my pack off, I summoned enough energy to find a camper and ask what to do. He guided me in the direction of the ranger station. About 1/4 mile away...ugh. Upon arrival I was greeted with ""You must be Logman"". The ranger was watching out for me...and hiking friends too. That's what the AT community does...take care of each other...even complete strangers. He told what campsite to go to...back another 1/4 mile and that he would be there shortly to take down yo the wayside and showers. Waysides are restaurants. On the way he stopped to shoo a rattlesnake off the road. They are protected here and the authorities are serious about it. $500 fine for killing one, including running over one in a car. About every hiker in our bubble was at the wayside eating and showering. Food was great but expensive, shower great and free....ok tradeoff.After eating and showering it's a hike back up to the campsite. Probably about a mile, maybe more like 3/4 mile. After setting up tents it was to bed. We will rise again early tomorrow and be off. I'm ready to see family at Big Meadows on Sunday.Blessings,","Calf Mountain Shelter

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/501028,"I was antsy upon waking up today. Fifteen miles following a twenty mile day might be very tough. That said an early start was the best bet. I typically get started no later than 7. Today I was up, gear packed and hiking just after six. Slept real good last night after that long day. Cool breeze into tent all night was soothing. With good rest getting up and going early was easy.This morning I was hoping to see wildlife which would seem logical with an early start and everyone else still in camp, most still sleeping. But no, our friends Dr. Pickle and Mockingbird, who left after us saw the bears...two cubs and the mother and later on a large male. Oh well so much for leaving early.Another good reason for leaving early was that storms were forecast to move through in the early afternoon. Getting to the next shelter by 3 was another of the day's goals. Again the green tunnel carried the day, but by and large the trail was nice. Immediately after one of the several crossings of Skyline Drive I stopped to wait for Dr. Pickle and Mockingbird. Just off the road about 100 yards, I heard a car stop and offer them trail magic. Out of the woods I came. A couple driving north was giving Gatorade. Wow! Great trail magic on this hot day.After trail magic it was back to trying to beat the almost for certain storm to the next shelter. That this was a 15 mile day preceded by my longest ever meant pacing my speed so as to conserve energy. That was going ok until the weather got dicey looking and a storm imminent. Thankfully as both the storm and shelter closed in, the terrain got better too. The result was that while fatigue set in during the final mile or two, I could still keep a decent pace. Whew! Arrived at the Shelter literally 10 minutes before the rain came. Many others, including our friends Dr. Pickles and Mockingbird. Preceding me there was Ben Jolly and a PATC ridge runner, Blistful.Thankfully the rain while a mighty downpour did not last long. Tomorrow we get to another campground in Shenandoah, Lewis, where we can again resupply and get hot food at the camp store. And then from there a short 8 mile day to Big Meadows and family time.

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/501104,"Another early start today. For me being anxious to be with family for almost 2 days gets me moving. Hiking early seems to pacify the anxiety and while no closer than if I left later it seems like it.Today for the first time I really experienced the ""You can make good time in the Shenandoah."" comments we've heard for weeks. It was a fast 12 miles today. Still not a lot of views but nice trail nonetheless.After we reach the Lewis Campground it is only a short distance to Bear Fence hut. Less than a mile. We plan to hang out at the camp store a while and make a leisurely day of it. Again the trail allows for making good time today. We get there just as it looks like a storm is coming. We were on the store's porch when it rained just briefly. It didn't take long for a dozen or so hungry hikers to arrive and begin eating and resupplying. On the way today and almost at the campground I was passed by a young hiker from Switzerland. Out of the blue he said he would have a soft drink for me when I arrived at the store. And he did.At the camp store we found good eats for lunch and good resupply. We also found Randy the store manager. Talk about a passionate Park employee. Wow! He provided us tips galore on everything from what to buy food wise at other park restaurants to trail and water supply information. At the next shelter where we would stay he advised not using the spring. As a result we maxed out our water at the store. Enough for the day and for tomorrow. Thankfully I only had 8 miles before the next wayside and more. One could really get spoiled here in the Shenandoah with so many chances for food and drink and lighter pack weight that comes with convenient resupply.For the last several days Ben Jolly and I have been hiking with a young couple from New York City, Dr. Pickles and Mockingbird. I really like them very nice, fun and interesting. Again tonight we will all be at the Shelter. Unfortunately for me the last time as I meet Sandahl, Jeff and Aubrey tomorrow for two days of family time.Bears had been frequenting the Bear Fence Hut recently. Thus the name is appropriate. We sure hoped there would be no visit tonight. We made sure everyone properly stored food and other scented things for the night.Blessings,","Hightop Hut

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/501105,"One is always skeptical when told a day of hiking will be ""easy"". And that is especially true given my age and recovery requirements. Today was however easier than I expected. A very nice and fast hike into Big Meadows. I arrived about 30 minutes earlier than expected. And let me tell you breakfast was great! Yes I got to the Wayside before they stopped serving breakfast. As Ben Jolly and I were just finishing in came Dr. Pickle and Mockingbird. And as before it was great to see them again and especially on this day. I will zero tomorrow with Jeff, Sandahl and Aubrey here so they will all now be over a day ahead of me. And it's quite possible we will not see each other again. That's how it goes on the AT. Instant friends but often short term too. We have exchanged email addresses and phone numbers.I had about 2 hours to wait for Sandahl and Jeff to arrive. Having to wait at the Big Meadows Wayside was not a bad deal at all. Lots of people to watch, other hikers stopping in and several I knew and then of course food and drink is readily available. Once family arrived we would eat lunch before checking in at the lodge. I was talking to a couple of non- hikers, answering their questions when my family quietly snuck up behind me. What joy getting hugs and kisses. It would be a great next couple of days.Unfortunately after lunch and check in, I had some necessary business to take care of...first a shower and then laundry at the campground. I wanted to get this stuff done and out of the way so as to not take more time away from the visit. Before dinner we did a little sightseeing but most of that would be tomorrow. We had light dinners at the lodge and then settled in for the night. Aubrey, in my opinion, did great. And what a joy for granddad to see her. Good night.Blessings,","Bear Fence Hut

Interesting that there are much better and more frequent views from this road than from the AT. We then embarked on a short hike to Dark Hollow Falls. It was an easy route suitable for Jeff to carry Aubrey. See picture. We took photos, hung out there a while and then back to the car. Next stop was for a picnic lunch back at Big Meadows near the campground.After lunch it was back to our room and naps all around. Dinner was back at the wayside.

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/501786,"Awakening this morning we began preparations to leave. Jeff and Sandahl had a long drive ahead so leaving as early as possible was beneficial. And for me the usual emotional roller coaster of happy to have had two great days but sad to see them leave. I have learned much about me as an AT hiker this year. One main thing is that ""my hike"" is not to be out real long periods of time. More on that later. And today I'm about at the limit. Seeing the van drive away was a little tough.Because of the late start for me, about 10 am, today would be very short. Just over about 2 hours of easy and slow hiking and I was at the Hut. I spent most of the afternoon updating this journal and setting up my gear for the night. Also near this Hut was a PATC (Potomac Appalachian Trail Club) cabin. PATC maintains the trail through the Shenandoah and has several of these huts that are for rent. This is the first I've seen. It was about 100 yards further down the mountain from this Hut. It had a great view of the Shenandoah Valley. A family had it rented today.Also arriving early were two guys, Bad Hat and Mr. Magoo. About my age we immediately found a lot to talk about, mostly hike related. After describing how I was feeling this day after having said goodbye to my family, Bad Hat suggested that I hike with them so as to have company and to help get my mind back to the hike. Good idea so I accepted. We then concocted a plan, mostly a change to my hike plan, to get us to Harper's Ferry in about 10 days. Bad Hat had a mail drop in Luray so they were going to zero there too. I had a drop in the next town, Front Royal. So I would join them, take a zero there instead of in Front Royal. I planned to call the PO and have my boxes there either sent ahead to Harper's Ferry or back home. Why home?Well that's a story to inform everyone about. Over the last couple of weeks I have discovered what HYOH (Hike your own hike) really means for me. And also what, as my friend Charlie Boles, reminded me of before I started this year, what it means for me in regards to ""it's about the journey, not the destination"". From the beginning of my planning to finally hike the AT it was not about hiking the whole thing in one year but to enjoy it and see the wilderness and experience the culture of the AT. Initially as most of you know my plan was to hike it all over the course of 2 years. The plan was to be out 3 months or so each year. Last year I did not make the distance planned to Harper's Ferry because of injury requiring getting off the trail. I did get back out for just about 2 weeks but only got to Damascus, VA where I started almost 7 weeks ago. The plan this year to still complete the trail in two years required hiking for about 5 months. About three weeks ago now this began wearing on me. I'm missing Cathy and had a couple of days where the hiking was not real enjoyable. On top of all that my mileage range is less than I anticipated it could be. I've had a few long days and even a 20 miler last week. For the most part I hike comfortably about 10 to 12 miles a day. And I likely can't make Maine this year at that rate. While pondering these things during the day, ... a great thing about hiking in the wilderness is the thinking time. ... I concluded that my hike was more like those guys I have hiked with this year. Namely, Justin and Jesse the beagle, Lost and Found, and now with Bad Hat and Mr. Magoo. Like me they all want to experience the AT and not like a thru hiker. That means taking time to see what can be seen, not pushing miles, and for us older guys more frequent rest days. A sort of confirmation came a few weeks ago when I passed a guy hiking south. When asked how far he was going (a common question asked when passing hikers heading in the opposite direction ) he answered that he was completing the thru hike he began in 2008. And he added that doing shorter section was more enjoyable. I thought about that for a long time. Last year I actually did hike two short sections. Three if the break in Gatlinburg is considered. First to Gatlinburg where Cathy and I spent 5 great days together. Second to Erwin where I finally needed to get home with my foot issue. That was two weeks after Gatlinburg. And third, once back in late June two more weeks in to Damascus where I came home.In the final analysis this year's plan...five months of hiking and being away from home was just too much. And I knew before starting, and saying such here in an earlier post, that my biggest challenge would be to be away from Cathy. How true that is. While I don't like not accomplishing goals, my journey to hike the AT and my plans for how to do it were flawed. And I learned that only by actually trying it. Now I have learned and know how to adjust. The desire and passion are still strong as ever. The time frame for completion will be longer...years perhaps at 4 to 6 weeks per year. And they will need to be stretched over several years. I'm thinking perhaps 4. I absolutely do not want my hike to be an endurance challenge where the hiking is not fun. Being out long this time I have had days of late where the journey was not fun. While I have left home to hike ""alone"" that hardly happens as we connect with other hikers walking at our pace, stopping at the same locations, and often within or near our same age. I'm certainly thankful for Bad Hat and Mr Magoo, my most current hiking partners. And I look forward to the next week with them as we go to Harper's Ferry together. There I will head home to family and regroup. I will not immediately plan how to finish my AT experience but will certainly start that before too many months pass. 2016 may not be a year to hike as the Walk in the Woods movie is expected to draw a lot of folks out. Maybe my plan will be to restart in 2017. More later on all that. I now want to enjoy the next several days of my 2015 journey.Blessings,","Big Meadows Lodge

These guys, old college friends from LSU, are my age and I think we will get along fine and hiking paces should be compatible. The plan today is to make it to the road into Luray by about 3:30 or 4. Bad Hat had called and made arrangements for a local guy to pick us up.The hiking today was typically Shenandoah...no or very few views from the trail but nice trail and good time made. The highlight was the long and potentially treacherous downhill leading to Thornton Gap our destination. This is where Ben Jolly had ended his 2007 hike due to a fall. And here we were doing it late after a 14 mile day.Hiking in a drizzle much of the day we arrived at the appointed time. No shuttle waiting. Bad Hat called and the guy was still coming. That took darn near an hour as we waited on the cold mountain.We were delivered the 9 miles to town at the motel the driver worked at. Very convenient to all we needed, but too late to get any chores down today. He also secured a more favorable room rate for us.After showers it was dinner at a very good pizza place next door. It by that time for bed and up early to get laundry and resupply done before lunch so we could rest off our feet the rest of the day.

I substituted a zero here with one I planned two days from now in Front Royal. I could only because I still have enough food to get to Harper's Ferry. That was one advantage of hiking in the Shenandoah...advantage is lot of food available that allowed me to conserve mine. Since we got to town late in the day all zero day tasks had to be done today. That is not the preferred way. The best is to get that done the day one arrives thus saving the zero for rest only...sort of like a sabbath day.Luray is a nice small town surrounded by the mountains. Dollar General and the laundry mat were almost next door to one another about 1 mile down Main Street. On the way we stopped by the local outfitter. The clerk there was totally useless...could not answer any of our questions. One thing that would really help this town would be to set up a volunteer hiker shuttle service like what we found in Waynesboro.

It opened early so we could actually eat real food before heading back to the AT at 7:30 am. We arrived at the trailhead and we're hiking by 8. Today would be long but would also included our last Wayside in Shenandoah. Eating lunch today will make dinner a snack.The trail again in Shenandoah was nice and good time was made. Even with long miles and the late start we arrived reasonably early and had first choice of spots in the Shelter. It seems that for this section in the Shenandoah I have used shelters more often than planned. The advantage is early starts and no issues with wet tents if it rains.Our current ""bubble"" of hikers includes many who have made stops in either Luray like we did or Front Royal. And most everyone want to reach Harper's Ferry within the week. I certainly do. This will be a rather long stretch without a break, showers or food stops...5 days. That stop will be at one of the most popular hostels...Bears Den Hostel. Bears Den is owned by the ATC and run by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club. And before Bears Den is the start infamous ""roller coaster"" a 13.5 mile section of one climb immediately followed by a downhill total of about 13 such beasts.Tomorrow we will leave the Shenandoah National Park behind as the journey continues north to Harper's Ferry. Harper's will be the next National Park as most of the town is a national park. Six more hiking days left now before I head home. I'm hoping for rain, which is forecast for the next several days to entail afternoon storms. That scenario allows me to get to camp and stay dry before they hit. My bet is that like tonight, I will be sleeping in shelters mostly.Toward the end of the day we passed a falcon recovery area in the Shenandoah. Fortunately a ranger was there to explain to me what was going on. Young birds are being brought from Washington DC where falcons were introduced to help control pigeons and other urban pests.

It seems I've been in this park most of the time this year.Shortly after starting and almost out of the park, I finally see a bear. It seems everyone but me has seen one or more. This one was just walking about 50 feet off the trail coming in my direction. It was rather small so I had to quickly determine if it was a cub. I immediately looked for the mother while deciding it was probably older. This one did not run away but hurried too fast for a photo.Rain was expected today....and not just the afternoon thunderstorms...but severe with high winds. As a result we ained to reach the shelter and get space inside. On the way I met one of the many Germans hiking this year. U-haul, had lived in Blacksburg VA for a few years and knows this area well. His story is that his workplace a auto parts factory, in which he is a manager, gave him a one year sabbatical, to hike the AT. Interesting is that after hearing this from U-haul another German hiker got the same benefit from his employer. Come on US employers get in the game!!U-haul had worked almost 1700 hours overtime so got his to help reward him for the effort. The other guy had just passed his 17th year and got his for that.U-haul was hauling this day to make about twice the miles I was. As he was pulling ahead I slipped and fell for the first time this hike. Hit pretty hard too. U-haul literally ran back to assist me up and then insisted on staying with me to the Shelter. A very nice gesture. Once there he asked Bad Hat to make sure I was alright in the morning. No lingering pain you know in the old guy after the night. I was just fine but really appreciated U-haul. Later everyone talking of U-haul only,said good things too. A real fine guy.This shelter had one drawback...water was way down the mountain. With this and rain coming our first chore was getting water. We were soon joined by other hikers and thus the Shelter was full. Anyone else arriving would be setting up tents in the rain. Well once the rain came...I had found a caulk gun in the Shelter. Guess where it had been used...above my sleeping spot. And it was still leaking. Once discovered my bag was already damp. Thankfully I arranged to fit between the two drips thus minimizing getting wet. Drying out my bag tomorrow before sleep will be job one.Tomorrow is national hike naked day. Think I should?Blessings,","Gravel Springs Shelter

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/502910,"No I did not hike naked today. It was a hot one but no naked hiking. I did hear some stories. Just plain dumb thing to do, especially on a weekend when in this area we see a lot of weekend and day hikers.Today at the heat of the day I came upon the best thing. ..a freshly put out cooler stuffed full of sodas and snacks. From the looks of the trash bag only one or two had passed by before me. Bad Hat was ahead and the first thing I thought of was if he had gotten some. At the Shelter later I learned he had not. And too boot it was at a trailhead with a picnic table. A great place for a long ""Pack off"" break. And I did...two off brand mountain dew type drinks called mountain lion...both super ice cold, and two Little Debbie oatmeal cookies. Yum, yum, yum. Coming right when I needed a,boost to finish the day and climb the last hill. Praise the Lord for whoever Corky and Greg are...the angels who left the cooler.A couple of hours later upon arriving at the Shelter, the first thing I asked Bad Hat was if he had gotten the trail magic. And just as I thought he had not. Bad luck for him. And not the first time ehither. A penalty for hiking fast perhaps. This shelter had great water and unlike the last one very close. In early I could dry my sleeping bag and put upa clothes line to dry socks, bandanas, and other items before dark.Tonight the Shelter and campsites were full. It seems a lot who got off the trail in either Luray or Front Royal have collected here for the push into Harper's Ferry the psychological half way point. It is actually about 60 miles shy. We are also nearing two other notable points...the 1000 mile and the infamous ""roller coaster"".Tomorrow is supposed to be a hot one. I have loaded to maximum capacity all my water containers so I can leave early in hopes of beating most of the heat. Blessings,","Tom Floyd Shelter

Unless it looks like rain I will tent tonight.Even with early morning heat I made good time today. The AT today takes us through a large mountaintop Virginia state park. Right as we entered someone had left some water jugs as trail magic. Looked like they had been there a while but several still had water...good for a quick fill up.Again a lot of us were at the shelter. I was the first there who was tenting and thus got first choice of tent pads. This time the water source was very close. My tent was even closer to it...good for refills early tomorrow morning if necessary. An early start tomorrow will be a must. It's supposed to be hot and we begin the ""roller coaster"", a thirteen mile section of constant up and down hills. Most everyone will go the 9.9 miles to a popular ATC owned hostel.Here tonight Bad Hat, Mr Magoo and me met up again with two interesting ladies, Ma'am and Sunshine. To me they are dead ringers for sisters but are not. Ma'am is from Cleveland, Sunshine from Minnesota.

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/502915,"Ten minutes from camp it started...the roller coaster. Unknown at the time but for telling the rest of today, two things started happening. First, I heated up fast. A full sweat before 6:30 am is not a good sign. And that is especially true on a day expected to be hot. Second, the belt on my new pack, only a few days in use, started slipped. A feature is called on the fly adjustable. It works using velcro and that was not holding. As a result my pack was not staying on my hips where it best hlps me carry the load. Now more was on my shoulders. That would make for an even tougher day.Eventually, after several stops to work on it, I got the pack to stay on my hips pretty well. As for the heat that continued to rise as did the mountains we were climbing. About mid-point today we crossed the 1000 miles mark on the AT. The general location was marked with the stone sign shown here.One thing about this roller-coaster stretch is that the downhills are also tough...very rocky and slow going. It would be a long day even if on the short side in terms of time. Given the difficulty and how I felt, I seemed to be making ok time. But let me tell you I sure was wanting to get to the Bears Den Hostel and a shower, the first after 5 days, and the famous hiker special...a frozen pizza, pint of Ben and Jerry's ice cream and a soda....not to mention laundry too. By the time I crossed the foot bridge 1/2 mile from the hostel I think I was seeing mirages of ice cream. The last half mile about did me in....others too. I ran out of water too. Later we learned the heat index was 105 degrees! No wonder I was feeling bad.On that last hill about halfway up, I was passed by a hiker I had met way back in Catawba on May 26. It was Corky, who is from Front Royal,VA a city we had recently passed. She had stopped home for a few days and that how she came to be here. And,she and her husband were the givers of the awesome trail magic I described on June 21. She is an awesome hiker. Known this year for hiking in crocs. Yes those plastic shoes most everyone else is using for camp/town shoes. In my suffering I asked Corky to holler when she got to the side trail leading to Bears Den. From there it was only .2 of a mile from the AT. Praise the Lord she yelled about 2 minutes later. Renergized, I sped up to get there. Bears Den is a first come first serve hostel. But it is large. The hostel had been a summer retreat house/mansion donated to the ATC. Made of stone it's impressive. Costs of staying is reasonable and it hold about 20 inside plus a lot of space for tenting. The cost includes the hiker special plus free laundry and shower. A really nice respite for me just two days from getting off the AT for 2015 in Harper's Ferry.One more shelter before Harper's.Blessings,","Rod Hollow Shelter

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/502920,"The first order of business today was a pancake breakfast. It was the final part of the hiker special at Bears Den Hostel. Next was finishing off the remaining few ups and downs of the roller coaster. Rain and wind last night brought in cooler weather and that coupled with less steep and high hills will help. Because Bears Den is on the top of a mountain the first half mile was down.One of the best things happening today is that we leave the state of Virginia behind. Upon crossing the line which was marked with a sign, I arrived at a nice view. With good cell reception I sent my friend Dan Allen a picture and told him I was finally on his home turf.Even with the final part of the roller coaster today's trail was nice and relatively fast hiking. Our destination the David Lessor Shelter was very nice except for the fact water was .25 of a mile downhill from it. Most others that had been at Bears Den chose to press on further toward Harper's Ferry to a campsite. Bad Hat, Mr Magoo and me stayed here because regardless we would be in Harper's before noon tomorrow. Besides the three of us, four others stayed here. Two brothers our age hiking this section, a German and a guy named 4B. The two brothers were enjoyable. Very talkative and interesting in that they seemed to know way more about the AT than they really did....in my opinion. Near dark, Dirty Face, a young lady joined us old guys. She must have felt a bit odd not being the only woman, but being so much younger than her camp mates this night.I have a lot to do tomorrow in Harper's Ferry so that I can get out early Friday morning to Washington DC and then home. Anxious to get to bed, wake up early and get going. Early starts as you may recall is an advantage of using the shelters. Enjoyed my last trail meal tonight...Taco Mac.

I bet only about 20 minutes at a time. When I checked my watch at 4:45 am I decided to go ahead and get up. The 5:40 am start was by far my earliest.On the trail I was flying. The first three miles were super fast for me at close to 3 mph. Easy terrain and desire to be home for sure was the reason. With less than 4 miles to go and we'll before the 12 noon estimated arrival time, I ran into Foo, A guy that I met in Shenandoah. In fact he was a guy Ben Jolly had advised to seek medical help for an infected bug bite back in the Shenandoah. For some reason the two of us hit it off well. I had last seen him at the Big Meadows Lodge when there with Sandahl, Jeff and Aubrey. He was there after having seen a doctor in Luray.He was recuperating well. He's much faster than me but on this day I kept up with him. We stayed together until the outskirts of Harper's Ferry where he finally pulled ahead.Crossing the Shenandoah River and entering Harper's Ferry was nice. I have now hiked almost 1023.2 of the AT. 553.2 of that this journey in Virginia and West Virginia. The trail takes you right into the heart of historic Harper's Ferry. Here the Appalachian Trail Conference main office is located off a side trail. Absolutely everyone goes there. When I arrived about 40 hikers, most of whom I knew or at least recognized were congregated. Packs lined the sidewalk out front and hikers crowded the lounge inside. Here everyone is photographed and recorded by number, either as a section hiker or thru hiker. Unfortunately I did not commit my number to memory. It was in the 380 realm however.Here at the ATC office my busyness began. I needed to pick up a mail drop, head to Econo Lodge to check in, pack some gear back into the box Cathy sent stuff in, and then get back to the PO to mail before closing. And of course I also wanted to spend some time with friends before we parted ways.Having arrived well before Bad Hat and Mr Magoo, I had lunch with Ma'am, Sunshine, 4B and two others. After lunch it was back to motel for napping and securing gear for travel home. Cathy had sent travel clothes so I had fresh stuff. I visited with Bad Hat and Mr Magoo when they arrived and we said our good byes as they were not joining the rest of us for dinner in the historic old town area. Besides dinner there I needed to check out where I needed to come early tomorrow morning to catch the commuter train to DC. Dinner was at Private Quinn's Pub. By the time we left the motel Ma'am's family and a friend of Sunshine ' had arrived for a visit. Good news because they had cars and it was raining. The walk there would have taken 20 minutes. We parked right at the train depot where I wanted to be at 5:25 am tomorrow. At Quinn's we chose to eat on the deck under a makeshift tent of table umbrellas to ward off the intermittent drizzle. It was sort of a fitting end to my hike symbolic of having lived outside for most of two months. Still hungry as if e had not already had a town meal, we ordered appetizers to share with drinks. For my dinner I had a crab cake sandwich with potato cakes. A quick stop at Walgreen's on the way back to the motel, a quick goodbye to friends, and it was to bed for me. I will rise early tomorrow to begin the long journey home.Blessngs,","David Lessor Shelter

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/502950,"I awoke at 4:30 am to catch the first commuter train into Washington, DC at 5:25. To meet the train required about a mile walk across town to the station. The ride in was fine except the seat I had to use because of my pack, gave me minimal view of passing towns, farms, etc. Once there I tried to store baggage with Amtrak but that office was closed for some reason. What to do?Previously, long before actually starting my hike last year, I had checked out the potential to rent a bike at Union Station. Now I headed to find that location. I was hoping I could maybe store my pack there while touring the Mall and monuments for a couple of hours. At that point I had almost 4 hours until my train left for Cincinnati. At the bike rental, I found a mechanic, Matt, there early getting bikes ready for the day. He was interested in my journey, but the bike rentals did not begin until 11am. And my that time I needed to be on the train! Upon hearing that Matt took it upon himself to go ahead and rent to me. What a nice gesture that I shall never forget.The Mall is a big place. It's probably 2 miles or more in length. DC is very bike and pedestrian friendly even with massive traffic too. In most places I could ride on sidewalks like most other cyclists were also doing. The two hours went by quick and only allowed time for quick pictures. My only stopping places were at the WWII and Korean War Memorials and at a farmers market in front of the US Dept of Agriculture building for a snack/late breakfast. This is most definitely a place to come back to with Cathy and more time to sight see.Back at Union Station it was a short wait before our train started loading. Thankfully I got a window seat for the 14 hour ride home. On the train I spent time updating this journal, reading, napping, seeing what I could of the countryside as we passed through. Delays on the way meant that I would arrive at least 2 hours late. And that was problematic in that our arrival time was very early in the morning. Originally, scheduled for 1:30 am this meant Cathy was staying up even longer in order to come get me.Well as this day ends, I'm at least on the way home.Blessings,","Harper's Ferry, WVA

Goodbye this year with Cathy was much easier since I'll only be gone a week. Thanks to my friend Dave for taking me there at such an early hour. Amtrak is a nice way to go. It's cost effective, comfortable enough, and in this case I can make an easy connection with a shuttle in Staunton, VA for the ride to Three Springs Hostel where my hike will start tomorrow. Actually hiking will not start until Tuesday. Ed ""Lost and Found"" will not arrive here until tomorrow.

It seems very compact and snuggled into this corner of the Shenandoah Valley.Upon arrival at Three Springs I met two other hikers I would be sharing the bunkroom with. Will from Alabama and Scout from Florida. Scout was very quiet and kept to himself, Will and I hit it off, started immediately. Will, who like Scout, is a thru hiker started his hike in early March, which he had to have to be at this point on the trail. Recently out of the service he embarked on this journey. Will is experiencing some foot issues and decided to join Ed and me in Buena Vista tomorrow. Three Springs is closed on Monday and Tuesday but still provides shuttle servce.

Clean, very friendly and she is such a great person. Hugs upon arrival and exit too.Breakfast was: toasted bagel with choice of butter, cream cheese and jelly; homemade yogurt parfait with blueberries and cherries; scrambled eggs and cheese, and bacon. Plenty of portion to fill up any hungry hiker. My problem was that I'm not yet a hungry hiker. I did manage however to finish it.After breakfast Will and I packed up and relaxed while waiting for Ed's call. Around 10:30 he made contact and estimated he would make the trailhead about 12:30. Oma's plan was to leave at 12:15 to meet him there. Did that work out perfect? As son as we arrived, got the van turned back around in the right direction, there he was popping out of the forest. After the twelve mile drive to town, Oma showed us all the important locations on the way to Glenn Maury Park...restaurants, grocery and for Ed, the laundry mat. At the Park we discovered the office closed until 2, so Oma took back into town, about a half mile, to a barbecue restaurant that also just so happened to be very near the laundry mat. Covered outdoor picnic tables served as both our lunch spot and hangout where Will and I waited for Ed to do hid laundry.After getting back to the Park and checking in we had a huge choice of a red from which to choose a campsite. Glenn Maury is one fine park for such a small city. They even have RV spaces and there were even,a few there for the night. We chose a spot in the RV section away from the vehicles and with electric hookup for our spot. After moving a picnic table to it we were set. While pitching tents, two other hikers joined us, two brothers from New Brunswick, Canada. They were on a brutal schedule to complete their thru hike in the time they had available. The estimate was about 23 to 25 miles per day. Both were experiencing foot pain and taking in large portions of Vitamin I. They took off very early the next morning in pouring rain. They had to I guess to make the required miles.Once our tents were up it was back to town for dinner. Italian this time at a pretty good little place.

On the AT gaps mean you enter them going down and leave them by going up. And Up we did this day from the very start to the tune of 2000 feet. The rub is that last year I slack packed this piece and came down this heading south. The first 17 miles of this year's hike will be a repeat for me. Joining my friend Ed ""Lost and Found"" this year requires this do over. It will be worth it.It rained last night. It is never fun to awake after a rain to a wet tent and significantly more weight to carry. Now add that to the fact that today we start with a 2000 foot climb and you get..ugh! Fortunately, the Glenn Maury Park has large shelters near our campsite. We carry gear there first and then take down tent and hustle them there too. I spread my fly out on a picnic table and wipe off as much water as possible. Sometime today we will stop to hang these out to dry....if it stops raining.We hustle to get packed as we wait for our shuttle. Once at the trailhead the rain has stopped. Will hikes past us almost immediately as we say goodbye, Ed and I know it's unlikely we will see him again. Fine young man he is.The climb up was not all that bad just slow. At the summit we found a great place to dry tents, rest and enjoy the fact that the sun was making an appearance. A good breeze helped tremendously too. For the remainder of this day we continued on trail that I had covered last year going south. Our plan was to DIY camp near a spring some 10 plus miles into the day. Now finding that stream as dusk rapidly gained on us and also what appeared to be more rain was an issue. When finally found campsite options were not great but doable. Water supply was quite nice as the spring where we met it was flowing like a small stream and was sweet tasting and cold. One problem we had to overcome was the rain that began sputtering down and darkness as we pitched tents and cooked dinner. I slept great after my first night out. We did have some rain and would need to dry tents again tomorrow.Blessings,","Buena Vista and Glenn Maury Park

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533771,"Today was confession and communion day as we aimed for one of the iconic mountains on the southern Appalachian Trail. Also, today about 4 miles in I cross over trail I have covered last year and start on “new territory”. After yesterday’s climb to start the day, today was nice and rolling. The first 5 or so miles went rather quickly and we stopped early to dry our tents. The Priest heading NOBO is not nearly the climb as heading south would be. Even so we did not want to be carrying extra water weight on our tents. Our first climb was up to Spy Rock, near where I began my slack pack hike SOBO last year. I was amazed how fast and easy I covered 17 miles last year and that took me over a day of hiking this year. That 2000 foot climb was the difference. Going down it in 2015 was fast. The Spy Rock climb was a bit more than I anticipated. Once at the summit the side trail to the rock was extra miles and we decided to skip it. There was however a super nice camping area at that junction. Up next on the Priest we would climb about three fourths of the way before coming to the shelter and camping area. Tomorrow we would begin the day finishing the climb. Fog was setting in as we arrived at the camping area. Camp sites preceded the shelter which was actually downhill a bit. Ed was ahead of me as I passed the camping area. One tent was there already snuggled into some nice rock and looking mighty comfortable. My first thought was let’s just camp her and not near the shelter tonight. In sight of the shelter but not quite there, I found Ed talking with another hiker “Chili” and his dog Pepper. Chili forewarned us of a guy inhabiting the shelter who was on the odd side and had been there several days. We did an about face and went back to the camp sites. At the campsite we met “Purple Haze” a young lady obviously happy to have us join her with the odd guy so nearby. She was much too young to have known much of Hendrix so we needed to quiz her about the trail name. That’s Ed’s forte. Mine is forgetting what he found out which is exactly what I’ve done since learning of it and writing this piece. One just can’t record everything in the handwritten journal.This is possibly the nicest campsite so far on my whole AT journey. Nice ground, great scenery and sparsely inhabited this night. We did have to venture to the shelter to re-supply our water. After setting up tents and before cooking our dinners we headed down the do that and personally check out the odd hiker. Once watered up we went to introduce ourselves. The guy was from Kansas City was carrying per his info over 125 pounds of gear and was not hiking the trail except it pieces. The pack weight seemed likely as he had set up a fan powered by D cell batteries and his air mattress was one of those you keep around for guests at home that looks like a real mattress. He told us his trail name was “White”. We hoped White was not trying to hike north like us and that that was the last we would see of him. Signing the trail journal at the shelter we noticed that most hikers began their entries with the traditional “Father forgive me for I have sinned…..”. And many wrote a lot of stuff, mostly real creative and funny. For me a simple “Logman here for the night and for communion”.After a nice dinner of Taco Mac I turned in to enjoy a night of nice moonlight and no rain.Blessings,","Unnamed Campsite

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533772,"We awoke and got going a bit later today as we would be hiking short and after finishing the climb up The Priest we would have a long downhill of about 3 miles. While downhills of such length are not easy, good time will be made.The morning arose looking great weather wise. Forecasts indicated late afternoon and evening rain. A short day would mean we might very well be in camp before it rained again. White, the odd hiker from the shelter passed our campsite heading south as hoped. His pack was enormous. And as anticipated he was hiking to the nearest road only. This was confirmed by young hikers who passed us later in the day and had not seen him. While a clear day, it was chilly. Starting with the remaining climb up The Priest was actually very nice as we warmed up and it was nice and easy. The downhill was a real pain. Keeping the “brakes” on for 3 miles really was hard on leg muscles. So much so that I welcomed the end and the start of the short first leg of the climb up Three Ridges to the shelter. As planned we arrived at the shelter early, before rain, and with plenty of time to recover from the first two days of hiking. At the shelter we met “Moose” stopping for a rest before heading on. Moose is the youngest hiker we’ve ever met on the AT. At 16 years old he was very mature and trail wise. Obviously he had support of good parents. Moose had a goal of finishing the AT before he turns 16 on August 31. He had worked ahead in school to leave early enough to begin his hike and be here at this time. And if he did not finish before school starts he would be making up missed work. Ed and I guessed that he must be, would have to be, a very determined young man and probably one of the top students in his class. He actually told us of some trial and tribulations he had overcome on the trail and we both were super impressed with his maturity and even that he would share those with us. Of course, I’m guessing we look more like grandfathers to him anyway and that probably made him even more comfortable with us. Both me and Ed will be watching his progress and looking for him on the list of AT finishers.Next to arrive was a rather remarkable young lady “Push”. Push is an Argentine-Canadian currently living in Atlanta but who left a job to hike and decide on what her future might be. She seems very independent and resourceful. I mentioned that my cousin lives in Yellowknife, NWT and she has visited there and strongly encouraged me to make the trip. Hal I may need to do that. We and 4 other used the shelter that night as it rained, rained and rained some more. Thankfully, the shelter held the six of us quite nicely and we were not cramped for space.

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533773,"Ok it took us three hours to climb what was left, which was most of it, up the Three Ridges from Harpers Creek Shelter. And if that is not a clue…it was a labor. Stopping frequently to catch a breather we climbed steadily literally from the first step out of the shelter. We did get many awesome views through the “Green Tunnel” that is the AT, but early on they were blocked by heavy fog. On several occasions trail switchbacks gave views up and down where we could see hikers ahead or behind. At times this can be disconcerting as one grows weary and sees but a speck of a person ahead and you know that you too have at least that far to go before the summit. At least today we know that this climb is the last of any significance until we get to Waynesboro. And in my case I head home, but Ed continues NOBO to Harpers Ferry. Once over The Three Ridges we pick up speed. That is good because today we plan on about 10 miles and have 7 yet to go. A sunny day developed and nice weather was a welcome…and a curse when we hiked about a half-mile through a field when we crossed the Blue Ridge Parkway. Once heated up things got dicey. Mainly, we were not finding the so called campsite, even after a SOBO told us it was about a mile ahead. We passed several springs but found no camp worth site on a boulder strewn mountainside with only the AT providing any similarity to level ground. At least we had good cold water. Finally we determined to take any site wherein we could squeeze two tents. And we were blessed with a marked overlook with rocky but pretty level opportunities. Accompanying this site was an awesome view of the Shenandoah Valley. Maybe the best one I have seen yet. This location was also accompanied by cell service, which we had not had for a couple of day so contacting wives was a real plus. Unfortunately, for me I had nearly a total bonk leading up to finding the campsite. I was able to force water but food was another matter. At camp I finally ate some dried fruit and risked attracting animals to my tent by keeping some rather than bear bagging it all. Our planned hike tomorrow was important so we could make Waynesboro as early as possible on Sunday. I had a train to catch and sure want a shower before catching it. And I assume the person sitting next to me would appreciate that too. So I went to bed a bit anxious as to my condition in the morning and how I would manage about 11 miles.

The weather report for today predicted afternoon thunderstorms of short duration between 3 and 5 pm. It would be great to get to the shelter before that happens. First stop today, a quick mile plus into the day, was the Blue Ridge Parkway and Dripping Rock Springs. We got there in short order. From there we would soon begin the day’s first and only climb of any significance over Humpback Mountain. This is a very popular day hiking location and both of us looked forward to meeting day hikers. From the outset Ed was mentioning how nice it would be to get some trail magic today. I, too, was hoping for the same as a way to get more food/calories into me from the depletion of energy I expected today due to the bonking yesterday. Sure enough about a mile of so past the road crossing and the spring, we came upon a cooler placed beside the AT. Ed actually say a man walking away from it along a side trail and a house was nearby. We guessed that he lived there and maybe regularly provided magic to hikers. We each enjoyed an ice cold fruit juice. My energy took a huge boost with this too. Starting up Humpback we met two guys hiking south. One of them said we were in for a difficult climb. We asked him how far he was going. He had the difficult climb up Three Ridges. After reaching the top of Humpback we both thought he was in for a rough day as Humpback was a piece of cake. At the overlook where one could gaze upon the Wintergreen Resort we began seeing day hikers. Actually the first group were young men out for an overnight. We noticed that each of them had brand new equipment. Even their clothing looked brand new. They were on a good hike to break in new stuff and get a feel for backpacking.With a what seemed like a million switchbacks we headed toward the Humpback visitor center. Further along as Ed was a bit ahead of me, I caught up as he was giving advice to three young women day hikers out heading for the Humpback overlook. They seemed completely confused as Ed showed them the trail on a paper map! Google maps and Siry all the way! Without phone reception these millennials are probably lost. We wished them well and headed on. After Humpback it was basically easy onward to the Shelter. And of course it began raining at 2 instead of the predicted 3. Rain it did for sure…in buckets accompanied by wind. A lot of wind. We had to quickly don rain jackets and pack covers before making the mostly downhill push to the shelter, which we predicted was about 1.5 miles away. By this time, we were actually in a group of about 5 hikers all heading to the shelter. One tends to gain energy and speed in rain and all of us headed at a fast and careful pace onward. The trail became slippery in spots quickly so caution was necessary. I was the last of the 5 to reach the shelter, which was full of people escaping the wind and rain. Many of them were trail club members out for weekend trail maintenance on this section of trail. Immediately upon arrival and I as usual was behind Ed, I told him of a plan I had concocted on the way down in the rain. Being still early in the day and with only 5 miles of what was supposed to be easy trail ahead, I wanted to push on into Waynesboro today. Ed liked the idea and the local trail club folks confirmed we could do this rather easily. It sure would be nice to sleep in a dry and warm motel and to eat a nice meal that I didn’t have to cook. Ed too could use the time to re-supply as he is heading north while I’m heading home. Getting in today for me would also mean no issues with showering before the train ride home. After a brief rest of 15 minutes or so we struck out. The rain stopped soon thereafter and we took off raincoats for the time being. As it worked out we saw no more rain, but the temps took a nose dive. We made the 5 miles to Rockfish Gap in just under 2.5 hours and it was nice hiking. At the trailhead local volunteer shuttle drivers post phone numbers. In a short time, we had one coming to get us. In the meantime, the temps and wind about froze us before we could quickly de-pack and don rain jackets/wind breakers. The shuttle driver recommended a dinner place when Ed described we wanted some good meat, good beer and a good salad. At the motel we quickly showered and headed into the downtown area about .5 miles away to Jakes Place. True to the recommendation we found a great menu, very good list of locally brewed beer and a nice sized salad. Desert wasn’t shabby either. I had the house special of a sourdough donut topped with whipped cream, caramel and chocolate drizzles and one scoop of vanilla ice cream.Back at the motel sleep would come easy to tired legs after 15+ miles today. Tomorrow I will get my gear ready for the train easily in time to be picked up by my shuttle at 1:30 for the trip to the Staunton, VA Amtrak Station.Blessings,","Campsite near Spring before Cedar Cliffs

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/533816,"For some reason I did not sleep too well last night. It could have be partially because other AT hikers in the room next door did exactly what they told us they were going to do while hiking into town…party hardy. Actually they weren’t noisy enough to keep me awake, I don’t think. Last night after dinner I had wanted to do Ed a favor and take his clothes to the laundry. He hikes with minimal clothing and must change at the laundromat into a pair of gym shorts and his raincoat to wash. Since I’m going home I wanted to do that for him. The hotel people told us it was a 24-hour place. After a long walk there last night I discovered it was not. It opens today at 7 so I wanted to hustle there and get’er done.Once back from that I packed up to be prepared for the shuttle coming at 1:30 and we headed to a popular local eatery, Weasie’s, for lunch. Talk about a place that is all and more of its advertisement! Fully crowded in a small dining area they were hustling to fill orders and clean off tables as fast as they could. At first glance one can see this is a great place. And it offers amazingly large portions for reasonable prices!!! Just perfect for hikers. Breakfast all day long too it appears. From here Ed and I would say goodbye as he heads one direction to the Rockfish Outfitters to pick up a mail drop and I head the other back to the motel to await my shuttle.It was nice to hike with Ed and I hope we can connect again next year at Harpers Ferry to continue the trek NOBO.On the way to Staunton to catch Amtrak the shuttle stopped at Subway for me to secure food for the 10 hour plus trip. I got to the station with about 45 minutes to spare. Staunton is an amazingly historic city with what looks like most of its building intact and in use. The Amtrak Station like most is location in the old part of town so I could take advantage of that and some time to kill to walk a few blocks of the city. This is definitely a place worth returning to for a visit. The train ride itself was uneventful, just long. I was pleased that we actually arrived in Cincinnati and Union Terminal on time!

I was blessed to be accompanied on this hike by Chris Pack and Josh Sosby. This was their first hike on the AT. We began our hike yesterday with an almost 6 hour drive from NKY/Cincinnati to Hampton, TN. In Hampton we stayed at the Braemer Castle Hostel, owned and operated by Sutton Brown. We arrived late and had a bit of a challenge finding the hostel after dark. Once in the accommodations were quite comfortable. Mr. Brown would be our shuttle driver tomorrow.I had actually been to Hampton in 2014 and utilized Mr. Brown's Grocery for dinner and some resupply while staying at the Kincora Hostel. Our day began with breakfast at Dunkin Donuts. What better fuel for a hike! First we were shuttled to drop our car, actually Chris's truck, at the TN 91 trail head. This is where our hike would end on Sunday. We then were delivered to the trail head at Dennis Cove Rd.The first stop was Laurel Falls. I was anxious to see this as I had heard how beautiful it was. To this point the trail was nice and relatively flat. Beyond we began to climb Pond Mountain. Pond was more of a challenge that I expected and my two partners were somewhat unprepared for hiking in real mountains! In our home area there are hills but nothing even close to a bona-fide mountain.I had planned a short day partially for this reason, plus a warm up to a longer day tomorrow. Let me tell you was I glad to be back on the AT. The first blaze got me to realizing I was in a way ""home"".

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558601,"After a much harder than expected hike up Pond Mountain, we found a very good campsite..and slept good. Today's hike started off quite easy as we descended Pond Mountain to Watauga Lake and Dam. We had absolutely beautiful sunny weather, coolish temperatures and nice views much of the day. We ate breakfast/lunch at the lake, filled up with water and headed on after about 45 minutes. Shortly we would be in the area where bear activity has closed an AT shelter and curtailed all activity, except hiking through on the AT. When we passed the shelter a few folks were there, but looked like they were not staying but just resting. As a reminder, this section I skipped in 2014 specifically because of bear issues and being alone at the time did not want to risk not being able to pass through far enough to miss nosy and hungry bears. About 1/2 mile past the shelter, I was behind Chris and Josh enough that they were out of sight. I hear a voice hollering and soon distinguish a man is calling after me.   Behind me coming up toward me is a man obviously not a hiker as he had no equipment. Turns out he was a fisherman who had arrived to the area by boat. He and a buddy, had a visit while camping last night from a ""black panther"" that destroyed coolers left in their boat. Upon a short quiz..he didn't know the area was closed due to bear activity; he showed pictures of puncture holes in coolers...just like a bear's claws or hey maybe a ""black panther"" too, would make. He seemed to buy my explanation that it was in no way a black panther and seemed genuinely alarmed that he had camped in a closed location. I even pointed out a sign just down the trail a bit, that he had passed as he caught up with me. Well this area has been closed for three years now because of bears and it sure looks like at least one more. 
I caught up with my team at the dam, where we headed back up the mountain starting with a rather tedious road walk. Thankfully, a lot of daylight even for the fall season was still remaining as we had plenty of uphill hiking left before reaching camp.  Heading into camp the young guys were again ahead of me.  Upon reaching Vandeventer two hikers already set up in the shelter pointed me down hill toward the water source to where the other two had decided to set up camp.  At a saddle, and still about 400 yards up from the spring, they were in process of pitching their tent.  Unfortunately, we would be sharing the leveled area with a hive of yellow jackets!  Thankfully at the late evening hour and darkness fast approaching they were hardly active at all. One of the guys has headed out to find the water source to no avail.  Fortunately, one of the hikers at the shelter had informed me that it was a piped spring.  We would need to find that water in the morning for sure as all water sources ahead were reportedly dry until after the trail head at TN 91, about 11 miles north.","Pond Flats campsite

That must have been a real chore; done by really dedicated and loving family and friends.Approaching TN 91 and our cars, we began to see day hikers.  Just before that though a hiker passed me who was obviously out for a long time.  From experience I could tell he had his ""hiker legs"" and was rolling along.  Hiker legs we did not have as it takes at least 4 to 6 days for most to start getting into that kind of condition.  Asked him where he had started that morning.  He had started near where we had started the day before!! He was moving!  Youth and hiker legs how awesome.  At the car we took our time getting ready for the 5+ hour drive home.  A nice long weekend to finish this part of my AT hike and with two friends to boot.  Just a fine finish.

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/565552,"Yes, it's true. I'm traveling by bus. I would have rather been on the train again, but connecting schedules from DC and Harper's Ferry allowed only one hour leeway to arrive and depart. The Bus option approximately 12 hours...too long but safe. So here I am on the way to Pittsburgh where I change busses for the last leg to DC.

This is a long layover, approximately 3.5 hours before leaving to arrive in DC at about 4:30am. Yes, that's as in the morning. Jim Weber, a Journeyman at Reset Ministry, who is from the Pittsburgh area recommended a place near the station within easy walking distance. And after sitting for several hours walking was relaxing. I ended up not eating at Jim's recommendation but at an awesome fish grill nearby. 

One thing I feel certain and that is after this pre-hike journey I will be ready for the hike to begin. 

The photo from the start is the bus station in Cincinnati conveniently located adjacent to the Jack Casino. So far I've seen 3 bus stations each better than the last. Ugh...for Cincinnati!

The last stop today, which is not the last for the trip, is somewhere between Pittsburgh and Baltimore. Why we go to Baltimore and back to DC is odd. Anyway the hope is that I can sleep some before DC. In DC I have a monster of a wait of about 12 hours. Plenty of time to finish one of the two e-books I have. Union Station is very near the Capitol Building. Should I stop by?

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566278,"Having arrived at the station in DC about 4:45 am or thereabouts and scheduled to catch the MARC train to Harper's Ferry at 3:30, I knew there was to be a long sit. I didn't however think it would be as hard as it was...not by far. First off there was no place that I could find to recharge my phone. Very problematic when that was to be my reading material for the day. I sparingly read my ebook off and on all day. Sleep...no real sleep now for well over a day. Surprisingly I actually don't feel that bad. A good sleep at the Teahorse Hostel will be imperative for a good first day of hiking tomorrow. 

The final obstacle was how cumbersome my backpack is in the protective travel case.  

It was so much so that going to the men's room was even a challenge. Didn't really want to spend more but decided to pay for two hours of storage time for my bag so I could take a walk. Sitting for so many hours was doing me no good. Weather outside the station was nasty rainy but I had a small umbrella just for that occasion The Capitol was not far away so that was my destination. 

Back at the station I enjoyed more time without the big bag before retrieving it to await the train departure to Harper's Ferry.

Arrived in Harper's just after 5 pm; went straight to outfitter to purchase fuel, which I could not travel with and then headed up hill to find the hostel.  Nice place and anxious to eat something buy food items I did not carry from home and hit the sack for much needed and awaited sleep.

About halfway in the trail went through Gathland State Park, the first of several Civil War historic sites this section will take me through or near. While there another hiker, like me, was reading the information signs, as we got headed back to the AT I asked if he was a thru hiker...yes...where you from...Campbellsville, Ky!! Wow the first guy I meet is another Kentuckian. 

Good campsites at the Crampton Gap Shelter. Met a ""just out of college"" hiker...Eric, recently graduated from Wake Forest. He studied economics. He seems to be carrying too much stuff. Rain was expected tonight. Thankfully it began after dark and was light.

The bit of rain last night slowed the start and was just a little concern as the planned length today of 12 miles may be long for day two. And with heavy rain expected tonight I wanted to reach camp early before it began. Hate setting up in the rain

More interesting historical sites today. First up was the Reno Memorial commemorating the site where the first Union general was killed in the Civil War  (Reno). Very interesting to pop out of the woods into well kept clearings at these sites. Next up was the Dahlgren Backpackers Campsite complete with restrooms and showers. Not quite in the middle of nowhere but a good spot. I stopped long enough for a bite of lunch and to dry the tent. While there I meet Mike a guy about my age out for six days and going north like me. We hiked together the rest of the day.

The final historical monument of the day was the original Washington Monument. Very cool with one heck of an awesome view. We spent about 20 minutes there before pushing on.

Right before camp the AT crosses I-70 on it's own footbridge. That was kind of fun. At camp we quickly got to work setting up as the sky darkened, the wind picked up and the feel of that storm pressed on us.

Luckily it was daylight when I discovered that so much water was there that I had to get packed in order to keep as much dry as possible. The packed tent weight was easily 6 to eight pounds. Normally just over three. The food bag which was hung up on a bear pole was of course soaked. Thankfully I got my clothes, except the ones I was wearing safely in my dry bag. The sleeping bag too put away. Leaving camp the rain was so intense it was hard to see. Fortunately, these were intermittent hard downpours.

And of course the day started with a climb...and my back many pounds heavier than usual. The forcast didn't look promising for an opportunity to stop and dry out. 

The casualty of the day was my Spot Messenger stopped. That hurts. I  stopped at the next campsite about 1/2 way up the first climb that had a covered picnic tables to change batteries to see if that works. Nope.  However,  I  did meet Ed from Arizona with whom I would hike with for the next two days. Ed, is a retired Firefighter/EMT. 

Again today we were hustling to reach camp before the next evening storm. Not much to see today and not much time to see it. Right before a very challenging climb and with the storm making noises, we had to ford a stream, my first on the AT where shoes had to be switched to camp shoes for wading. As a result of all that I did not quite make it to the Shelter before getting wet. My tent still way too wet to use, I was thankful that this was an awesome shelter with plenty of room for all. 

I  was completely exhausted after that final climb and blessed with a whole bunch of really fine young adults at the shelter. One young man hung my food bag so I wouldn't have to get wet again What a blessing to see such good young folks out here.

I  really had to get my stuff dry as carrying the extra weight was a burdon. Good thing tomorrow appears to be a better weather day.

I  had stopped today at Pen Mar Park to dry my tent and didn't want to get it wet again immediately; also one reason to hike short because we had left camp late after wiping it some and then one hour spent at Pen Mar to dry. Along the way shortly after the Park I passed the boundary marking the Mason-Dixon n-Dixon line. ""Honey I'm not in the South anymore. ""
Ed got off trail Near the Park to resupply.  We hope to meet up again as he will not be taking an extra day. 

The rest of the hike was rather easy today. I was looking forward to arriving early to rest , eat better than I had the last couple of days and rest before pushing on early tomorrow morning to pick up lost miles and to get back on schedule with adding more miles not hiked today.

Walking into camp I saw War Cry, a lady hiker from Colorado I had met earlier in the day, moving her tent. The reason, two guys already set up in one of the two shelters had discovered two rather healthy and beautiful black snakes near her campsite. Seven feet of one was actually climbing a tree. Black was preferable as War Cry had heard that rattlesnakes had frequented the area last year. I have heard that black snakes scare off rattlesnakes. ..let's hope so. 

I shared one of the shelters with just one other guy. A rather unusual guy from Michigan and huge. He was having trouble breathing, could hardly get to his feet, and I have no idea how he hiked here with very heavy gear.

The draw of town is powerfull on the AT. My legs seemed too fresh this am based on past days. Once back on the ridge I was making good time...hoping to make the road to Fayetteville by 2:30 or 3. PA is not called Rocksylvania for no reason. And supposedly I'm still a few days from them. So the rain showers start about mid-day and then the rocks...bolder and climbing over them slippery dudes begins. And of course I begin to slow down...considerably. 

Given the conditions my desire to reach town increases and keeping my concentration and focus on the current task becomes a conflicting battle. What a relief it was to finally hear traffic and know that I was on the final decent 

Once at the road, the pentacostal church sponsored hostel was only a .7 mile walk. I  knew several who were going to be there and the odd guy from last night had told me it was a really nice place too.

Taco mac for dinner. One of my favorite freezer bag meals. The shelter was very nice with bunks for eight. We had two on the floor and twice as many in tents. I like nice shelters and always glad when I get there in time for a space...only in the rain...otherwise tenting.

Today the thru-hiker bubble for the year began catch up with us. These folks have been hiking from Georgia since early March, have gotten in incredible hiking shape, and this year have experienced a lot of unfriendly weather conditions. The weather conditions I've been describing are old hat to them. Most are well under my age and piling on the daily miles. I likely won't see them again after today.

Tonight at the shelter we had a group of about six guys who met on trail, decided to travel together and even get off for a week together. Visiting New York seemed to be the chosen thing. All very interesting young men. Glad to meet them. 

Here in PA the shelters seem to be in much better shape than most south of Harper's Ferry. Some sites even have two....not one for men and women...for snorers and non! 

Tomorrow, shortly after breaking camp, we will pass the 1/2 way mark on the AT. Did I tell you I have met a slack pack hiker from Edgewood? Actually I've seen him a few times now.

Many local area residents out hiking on the holiday. Fun chatting with a group at lunch stop. I meet them again almost at the finish. One of the guys even bought me an ice cream at the famous Pine Furnace Grocery. There they have a famous 1/2 gallon challenge. Eat that in one hour and it's free.
Left Eddie Spaghetti at the last shelter before the park drying his gear. On the way in I mis-stepped and took the third fall of this first week of hiking. This one could have been bad as I hit the top of my head on a rock. Luckily most of the energy of the fall had already been disapated by my legs and sticks...knees too a bit bloody. Sat down for a few minutes all was ok so headed onward to the park. 

I had called ahead to reserve space at the hostel there, but it did not open until 5pm. As a result I would hang out with hikers and others at the store for a few hours. The store is quite a popular place with local park users andAT hikers. The ice cream challenge is it's reputation, but its short order grill is excellent too. Since I was eating later at the hostel  just next door I resisted all but the awesome fries and some ice cream...but not the half gallon size.

Seemed a lot of folks were there for late in the day the final day of a long weekend. The park, the site of a former iron mine, is known for its lake. The lake is the old mine and is 90 feet deep!  Cold I bet but I know people were swimming today from the clothes seen at the store.

Just a bit down the road from the store is the AT Museum. It's in a neat historic building once part of the mining operation. It closed at 4 so I hustled there after eating. It contains one of the original 5 shelters built on the AT by Earl Shaeffer, the first to hike the entire trail. We should not complain about today's shelters. 

Ironmaster's, where I will be staying is the historic main building for the mine. It's been converted to a,hostel by a conservancy group with a full-time innkeeper. At five I checked in via Jeff the innkeeper, a former Presbyterian minister soon to be catholic priest. Tonight there would only be a few here. It would feel empty as it hold about 40. 

Dinner was pizza...the meat lovers variety for hikers wanting protein and carbs. Don't know the brand, but it was good. Dinner and breakfast here is only $5 more than just a spot to sleep!!

After dinner I retired to the front porch overlooking the park to enjoy the final remnants of this day.

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566974,"After yesterday's early arrival and long wait for hostel to open I was ready to hike. The next two days would be my longest over moderate terrain once the climb back into the mountains from the park was completed.
We were served a great breakfast of eggs, bagel, waffles and orange slices. On the trail, starting immediately out the front door of the hostel, the first few miles were in the park and flat. In the park the AT takes us by the 90 foot deep lake formed from what used to be the iron mine from which the park is named. Amazingly there was someone swimming laps in the in-lake pool at 7:30 am. 

I was feeling a bit stronger...finally, after one full week of hiking. Once back on the mountain, I soon got my rhythm and moved along at a good pace. Eight miles in there is a very popular general store only .2 of a mile off trail. Many stop there for lunch...me too. Even planned my food for that event. 

Down the mountain nearing the store, I began the first of several road crossings. Nothing unusual one stops looks both ways and goes. I did and stepping downhill just slightly,  I suddenly became dizzy, blurred vision, and the bump on my head began throbbing and right eye watering. Whoa! Held myself up easily with my sticks and probably only stopped for a minute or two. I needed to get to that store quick and figure out what to do. I tell you I was a bit scared.
At the store were two other hikers who had been at the hostel last night. The lunch they were starting to eat looked and smelled good. I took that as a good sign.

Unfortunately cell service stunk and I had trouble connecting with my most trusted advisor. She was at her Mom's house working. Between making contact with her, the folks at the store helped me connect with a local shuttle driver. It was obvious I needed professional opinion after the head knock yesterday.

It would be a while before my ride so I did eat lunch. While doing so I self diagnosed...jump ahead to Duncannon where I was taking a day off anyway...rest and hopefully get back out on Thursday. Upon pick up I was taken to urgent care in Carlisle then picked up again and taken to Duncannon. 

Everything checked out OK. No significant problems but did get concussion just odd it took a day plus 8 miles of hiking to show up. The docs diagnosis was like my own...rest, plus a good dosage of ibuprofen.

So that's my day after such a good start.  The bright side is that even while I have now a new missing piece of the AT, I now have more time to meet Cathy later this month.

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/566975,"Well today only a few things on my agenda that needed doing...the PO to pick up a few re-supply items and then send forward to next stop; eat a burger, beer, and fries at the most famous hotel, The Doyle, on the AT.  After that back to the motel to pack up to leave tomorrow and rest, rest and more rest.
Part of the deal at the motel is reasonable shuttle to and from town. Only the most brave, young or you name it actually stay at The Doyle. It's over 100 years old and room rent is only $25. That alone encouraged me to stay elsewhere . It is however the epicenter of AT activities as the trail passes right through town and by the hotel.

Walking up to the hotel, I recognized a hiker exiting a shuttle whom I recognized from earlier on the trail. Unfortunately he was hobbling along very badly. I  greeted Lion heart as he greeted me. We ate lunch and hung out together for about two hours before I headed back to the motel and he continued to wait for his girlfriend to arrive from New York City to pick him up. 

Lion heart is a really good guy. Even with 32 years difference in age we had a lot to talk about besides trail stuff. Sad for his injury and will pray for his healing to be quick.

The first few miles out were basilly level. The trail crossed two rivers that intersect at Duncannon. A quiet beautiful scene. Once out of town the Trail immediately head back up to the mountain ridges of eastern Pennsylvania. Today's hike was not easy after getting up. Several boulder fields needed negotiating which proved slow for me after my fall. I need to remain cautious but also need to get my mojo back.

It proved to be a long day. At several locations the forest opened for amazing views of river valleys on both sides of the mountains. And these are large rivers. I will have to look up the names and correctly get down which is which.

Peters Mountain Shelter is large. Easily room for 16 to 20. I  arrived early, only two there. Met Bloodhound a remarkable 70 years of age hiking the AT for a second time. The water supply was way down the mountain....320 rock steps to be exact. We took turns timing each other....average about 25 minutes round trip. Soon the young men thru hikers began arriving...filled the shelter by throwing gear wherever. Us early arrivals glad we had already eaten and had bed space setup.

Started hiking about 5 minutes after saying bye-bye to my Bible study brothers. Bloodhound and I hiked together today. I may have found a partner for the next few days. After the crowd at the shelter last night, I was expecting a lot of those young guys to pass me today. Not that many did. Someone said they hear that the guys had partied quite enthusiastically in Duncannon the night before.  

The day contained two very long gradual climbs. At the start of the second, I heard that a young lady had fallen and like me hit her head and was bleeding. Don't be scared the person said.  Shortly she caught up with me. She was a hiker..Seed..whom I had met in Duncannon. The wound was indeed nasty. Having just crossed a road I suggested she go back and seek help. Not...she pressed on. Tough young lady!

Several at the campsite tonight. A great spot but no water. . we all filled about 2 miles before camp. Bloodhound and me carried dirty water in our filter bags just to have enough for dinner and to get to the next water tomorrow.

Early arrival at camp is great. Plenty of time to set up, eat, and relax before sleep. Rain expected again tonight, but tomorrow no rain predicted.

I had offered to share with Bloodhound but he was uncertain if he wanted to. Got to the road in good time but the trail head was at the peak of a hill and on a curve, not a good spot. Walked down about 100 yards. Soon War Cry went thru and hollered that Bloodhound had decided to join me. Great! Now the cost just got cut in half. Soon after he joined up a car with AT decals made a u-turn and picked us up.

In town we quickly showered and used the provided laundry. While that was going the Wendy's next door was magnetic. After that we dried tents and napped. Went to subway for dinner and Speedway for a few items of resupply.

Soon after sticking our thumbs out a couple, staying at the motel and also hiking gave us a ride. The couple from Boone, NC were hiking the entire AT by slack packing using their own two cars. Dropping one off at the days endpoint and the other at the beginning. An expensive but fast way to hike.
Except for the nice beginning at a canal path and historic bridge, not much today. But of course there was the usual hike up the mountain at the beginning. Two pretty good and long ones today. 
The 501 Shelter we are going to was equipped with indoor bunks and managed by a caretaker. Rain as has been usual for too many days, was forecast for this afternoon. The goal...reach the shelter before the rain. That got done. 
One thing unexpected also at 501 was that it was close enough to a road, a town, and a pizza place to order in food. Rocketman, an honest to goodness, former rocket scientist and one of the most interesting guys so far this year, coordinated orders...most everyone ordered too much. The draw of town food is just too much. 
Also at the shelter were: Sam and Luna, Mr. Tea, Bloodhound and me. Two more came in after dark and in the storm that was underway.

But like many days so far rain was not far off. I left the shelter with pack cover on. I  do not like hiking with that thing on...it feels like I'm dragging a balloon around. 
More PA rocks today and one of my longest days too. Certain to have a long day I paced more diligently to conserve energy the best. 
God is Good: One thing I left out of the June 1 entry, but it was no small thing. I had been craving lemonade for a couple of days. Long distance hiking and water every day gets tough to drink. I  carry some stuff to add, but was really in the mood for lemonade. Out of the blue...and no coincidence  (Dave Ramey you hearing this) a day hiker moving south, offers me some vitamin water he is carry to hand out to us.  The flavor.....lemonade!!! And did I ever enjoy and need that. The guy even carried away the empty bottle. 
Today we passed another cool monument. It marked the location of an outpost used during the French and Indian War used to warn of impending attack. See picture. 
At the turn off to the shelter, several of us from the previous night were congregated deciding whether to move on or hike .3 miles off trail to this shelter. Bloodhound and I were firm on our plans to go. Others joined too and so we had another night with our friends Rocketman and Mr. Tea. Two other ladies our age came in soon after....one EB (Early Bird) is from Mason, OH. 
At the shelter we commenced drying out what we could. Luckily it only rained a short bit today. That would soon end. About dusk we for the umpteenth time heard rumblings from the heavens.

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569020,"Port Clinton is a tiny town with no hostel, no shower or laundry facilities. But for me a very important stop. They do however provide some good services to hikers, much of which I did not know about until we arrived. 
While not much, what they do provide is adequate and done so with much enthusiasm. We arrived at about 11:30. The PO did not open until 12:30. While I waited, Bloodhound headed to The Pavilion, a large covered facility provided by the community free of charge for hikers to camp, either under without tent or in the yard with tent. Rain forecasted so us and about 15 to 20 others were under and with plenty of room for everyone. A clean portable potty was also provided. On the way there a local resident stopped me and pointed out his neighbor's outside faucet for use by hikers at the Pavillion. 
Without laundry or a shower to take, we soon had staked our claim to an area in the Pavilion and headed to lunch and other places. First stop the barber shop...the designated location for hikers to hang out and recharge cell phones. What a neat place. Three chairs in an historic building that  also includes a flea/antique /consignment shop...all owned by Frank the Barber. Fox skins were $60. Local guys loved talking to us hikers. Haircuts were a mere $8. A couple younger hikers all talented musicians, were jamming with instruments from the store. Fun when Frank stopped cutting a guys hair, picked up his harmonica and joined in. 
Next stop the Port Clinton hotel, just a couple of notches above The Doyle in terms of accommodations but a great restaurant. Bloodhound and I ordered cheese steak sandwich and fries...huge portions. We should have shared!

Final stop...the Port Clinton Peanut Shop....a really well endowed candy store in this tiny town. One must wonder how they stay in business. After selecting a few munchies it was back to the Pavilion for the night.

First was breakfast at the Three C's restaurant, a very popular place not far from the Pavilion. Eggs, toast, scrapple and home fries for me. Perfect to tackle the usual steep and rocky climb back up the mountain. 
Before the hill climb out we walked almost the full length of town plus as the Pavilion is at the end opposite. Good walk length to warm up. Guess what we also anticipated more rain today. Thankfully not much more than light showers early was the order. 
We got to our shelter early. Another hiker, Joe, was already there. Joe was already sleeping....turns out this was his first day out as a section hiker  (like me). Joe, a retired professor, had been assisting with shuttle driving at a hostel in Virginia. He was obviously hurting from his first 6 miles on the AT this year. We also learned during the night that he is a world class snorer! 
We spent the day relaxing and drying out clothes from the morning exertions and brief rain. Dinner was early. With this shelter being close to the trail several hikers stopped by before continuing on. A friend from sever all days back, War Cry, also showed up to camp for the night. She had taken a day off the trail. 
This shelter is actually close to an area park and roads. In addition to other AT hikers we saw several day hikers. Near dusk we heard a commotion coming along the trail toward the shelter. Turns out it was a local guy, whose name I could not understand, and two others who hike the area to hand out trail magic. Literally without stopping he hollered...""Trial magic, beer, whiskey or chips."" We all chose chips which were actually cheese puffs. A yummy before bed snack!!

Our destination was the Eckville Shelter known for its shower and the only shelter with a flush toilet!  One issue and our desire to get there is that it's small with only about 8 bunks. First come, first serve. 
About mid-hike I met up again with Eddie Spaghetti who again I didn't expect to see again. It's always fun to see people again along the way. Except that we had a rather long stretch of trail, maybe 2 miles, without the PA rocks. That means, among other things, that one can hike at their regular pace. 
Bloodhound and me arrived early as desired and took 2 of the three lower bunk spaces. Since we had a good amount of time we leisurely set up in the shelter and took showers.  Amazing how a shower and putting back on dirty clothes still feels great. Now that shower, a sun shower, without much sun for days, was just a bit chilly. Nonetheless it was still great. 
One of the well known trail legends was at the shelter today visiting the caretaker...Bag of Tricks. As one hikes north several shelters actually have caretakers, who manage the facility and assist hikers as necessary. My understanding is that they are paid employees of the ATC.  This particular location is just out the back door of the caretakers house. Bag of Tricks was visiting the caretaker when we arrived. Bloodhound had met him several days before in Duncannon. Bag of Tricks had oranges for us...awesome on a hot day. Later he stopped by with soft drinks and fruit. 
Remember Joe from the shelter yesterday? Bloodhound and me wondered how he would do today. He showed up and as per yesterday immediately went to bed and slept...including entertaining us with his world class snoring. Not a joy before bed much less at night.

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569023,"After a couple of short days it was time to make miles. The hike from the Shelter which was off trail about a quarter of a mile was a good warm up for the climb back up the mountain. Maybe too good! Wow...what a long steep and rocky climb...over hour, maybe about one and one half's worth! 
Our goal today was to begin increasing miles and to reach Palmerton in 2 days. And that my friends is the location of the toughest section of PA rocks...the Lehigh Gap! Additionally we were entering a long stretch with sketchy water...and expected good weather and increased temperatures. 
Personally I'm continuing to get my confidence back in these rocks after the fall and day off a few days back. We aim today for what we have heard is a nice established campsite about half-way between the 25 miles to Palmerton. 
At the trail marker to the New Tripoli Campsite we learned it was not only 3 off the trail, but also downhill! That of course means 3 back up tomorrow am. 
Once down we found a nice spot and awesome spring water gushing from the ground. Nothing better than cold mountain spring water. We set up camp, ate dinner, hung food, and hit the sack.

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569024,"The hike back up from the campsite, about. 3 miles, got me and Bloodhound warmed up for what ended up being the first hot day of hiking. Today's hike will take us over two rock formations popular with day hikers and tourists. We saw several out early as we approached parking for the sites. And speaking of those sites....they are comprised of what I  call ""good PA rocks"", actually boulder fields requiring rock hopping and tricky maneuvering with awesome views and ugly consequences if not careful. The first area is called ""The Knife Edge"". Let that image set in and think what that was like. The second was ""Bake Oven Knob. 
More on these rocks: my definition of the rocks of PA fall into two categories...1) those that have littered the trail here in such density that one cannot hike in any rhythm whatsoever and requires almost constant watching of your foot placement. These slow down the pace for me and destroy any accurate estimates of hours it may take to reach a destination. And these represent what I have fallen on already enough times for this journey. 2) are these boulder fields like today which offer great views usually and while also slowing down the hike are interesting challenges. The type ones are also foot and boot destroyers! 
Initially I was not going to stop and stay in Palmerton today's destination because information used to plan my pre-hike itinerary indicated no place to camp or stay there. A very popular place, actually the old city jail was closed by the city due to rude and disrespectful hikers a couple of years ago. Fortunately we learned of a new place operated by a local restaurant and who provides free shuttle service to and from the AT. 
As is usually the case the place was first come first serve so like previous occasion we hustled today to get there before the place filled up. With sore feet and knees we arrived at the trailhead and called the shuttle  Good news! We would be the first residents for tonight....and for a mere $20 we got a bunk, a shower and laundry...not to mention free shuttle to and from. 
When we arrived at the trailhead to call the shuttle we both were very tired. And we had a great view  (see photo) of the behemoth climb out of Lehigh Gap tomorrow. There would have been no way, strength wise, to have done that today. PTL for the hostel being available. 
The hostel while small, only holding 6, it was well appointed. In addition to free showers and laundry, they provided sheets, towels, pillows and even razors and deodorant...good because while I carry a razor, I discovered it had been crushe'd in my pack. A shave after two weeks will be nice. 
Bloodhound and me had a welcomed surprise after we returned from a quick resupply at the grocery, a short two blocks from the hostel. Fiddle, a hiker we had meet along with her friend EB (the one from Mason, OH) was there. EB, like me had fallen on the rocks and headed home. The three of us were about the same ages and decided to hike out together in the morning. Unknown at the time this was the beginning of a strong trail friendship between the three of us 
We went to dinner together at the steakhouse owned by the hostel and wow what a menu!! This is a breakfast, lunch and dinner place so we would be back tomorrow am for breakfast before heading back out. 
Also at the hostel were two thru hikers, Hickory from Colorado and Lo Tech from Texas who were hiking together. Those guys also being about our age made excellent roommates for the night. Lots we could talk about.

Unfortunate because the Bert Steakhouse would not open for breakfast until 8 and the shuttle they provide would not deliver us to the trailhead until about 9:15. We wanted a good breakfast before tackling the most difficult climb out of Lehigh Gap but also concerned about the heat. Today was to be the hottest day of the year so far. 
Filled with energy providing fuel and with full loads of water (not exactly what one wants before this particular climb or any other for that matter) we headed up. Now this climb is for the most part wide open to the elements...no forest cover...and requires one to stow sticks in order to be able to use both hands!  
So much for yesterday's shower, I was soaked within minutes, including my bandana headband. Now friends I don't have good pics to show and description is hard...one must experience this to understand...but I will try. Picture taking while using both hands to cling to this trail would be dicey!  On a ledge I did get a few of the awesome gap we were hiking above. 
Imagine climbing on a jungle gym with a 40 lbs pack...upright, sideways, reaching full out to grab a hold, minimal footholds often, using knees, butt and any other odd position to hike!!!  Actually it was a fun challenge. Let me tell you though, once up this guy was exhausted and still a long day of hiking and rocks ahead. 
After such exertions it was necessary to drink and not conserve water. The next water would be 9 miles away at camp...unless we got trail magic at the only road crossing of the day. We had heard that local folks often provided and we prayed for that. 
Once up out of Lehigh Gap the trail was basically rolling with only short ups and downs. The openness to the sun was the issue. It seemed I stopped to cool in about every shady site. 
Finally as we approached the road crossing, Bloodhound and Fiddle were ahead of me. When I arrived they were about to cross the road, but I saw water jugs they had missed!!!  PTL there was one gallon remaining. We divided it between us, hoping it would take us to camp still almost 6 miles and 3+ hours ahead. 
We struggled up one more climb after the road crossing. The climb included a boulder field that slowed us down considerably. Finally at the campsite water was .4 miles downhill. I was elected to stay at camp to watch gear and did not complain a bit. Bad news is that after such a day of exertion I had no appetite...not good. I had a bit of dried fruit, apricots and pineapple, and some lemonade I had carried from town. We all needed a good night of sleep to rejuvenate for what was sure to be another challenging day and again with water issues.

Tomorrow would require a hike of over 6 miles before a spring known to go dry early in the year. With the rain we've had it was doubtful that water there would be a problem. Regardless we would conserve tonight. 
About halfway to the shelter and water source it happened again!!! I tripped on a rock and hit my head. Enough this time to produce a cut. Luckily the three of us were close together and Bloodhound and Fiddle quickly came to my assistance. First I got to my knees...not done quickly with a pack on. Then Fiddle coached me through removal of my now blood soaked bandana and help with cleaning the wound. The small cut was easily covered with a regular bandaid. 
For the rest of the day these friends stayed close, one in front the other behind, to keep an eye on me. Of Course I  appreciated that. Hikers take care of each other like this. 
After resuppling with water we headed on for tonight's campsite. For tonight's dinner I knew I needed to eat and maximize limited water use. Thus, the meal of choice was one of my favs... a peach fruit smoothie!  Almost 500 calories and only 8 ounces of water. Nevertheless we all wanted more water than we dared to drink before tomorrow.

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/569295,"We woke early to get as far as possible before the day heated up. Very important on this day requiring almost 7 miles before more water would hopefully be available.

The hike today starts on the downhill to Wind Gap before what should be the final major climb before Delaware Water Gap. And if course while we were anxious to reach that water, the trail wanted to again slow us down with rocks. By this time with PA almost behind us everyone was looking forward to leaving the rocks behind and enterinf New Jersey at the Water Gap. Also everyone was anxious to see if water was available at that spring known to be questionable. 

Just a few miles from the water two old friends finally caught up with us....Rocketman and Mr. Tea. They had left the trail in Port Clinton for two days. We expected to see them before the Water Gap As they hiked much faster than us and of course would be refreshed from time off.  At the spring we found absolutely wonderful water!!!  Just about 100 yards west and flowing very cold. Shortly after arriving several others joined. All hung out about an hour before moving on. A sign on the trail at the spring pointed toward a side trail around Wolf Rocks, the last boulder field in PA. All were ready to get there, get over and head toward the last night before Delaware Water Gap. 
Wolf Rocks was actually a fairly easy hike over. Not a bad climb and then basically a walk across them with minimal ups and down climbs.  Immediately after the rocks the three of us regrouped for the downhill walk to our Shelter. I stayed back to take care of ""personal business"", knowing that on the upcoming terrain I would readily catch up. 

Leaving my pack beside the trail I took off to find a suitable spot the requisite 200 yards off trail. No sooner there than I heard a huge commotion of people coming up the trail!! I never did that so fast in the woods. Back at my pack I saw a herd of young adults heading my way. Turns out it was a church group of 90 from Michigan. They were headed for Wolf Rocks and was I glad to have not met them there. Passing through such a group in opposite directions would not have been fun. 

Soon I caught up with Fiddle and Bloodhound. We arrived at the shelter, decided to stay there vs camp. The draw at this shelter is a water spigot nearby. We all basically bathed in it to cool off. 

Campsites at this shelter are actually about .3 miles further. The result being that many heading there stopped here first to get water. Many passed through but did not stay. By evening only two others did...Shutter from Virginia and Maverick from who knows where. 

Maverick arrived late. Shutter had camped previously with him and body language told me something was up. Sure enough he was a odd young man.  And obviously a loner to match his trail name. Just out of high school and obviously lacking g in social skills, he had hiked this far on the AT and still did not adhere to basic trail etiquette. Immediately upon arrival he started chopping wood for a fire; strewing equipment all over the place; and generally encroaching on everyone's common space. This culminated in him staying up and making noise long after ""hiker midnight"" of 9:30. The rest of us tried sleeping though this.

Fiddle had decided today to, like me, get off the trail at Delaware Water Gap. Her reason was to get back to Montana to continue care for her Mom and Dad, both of whom had encouraged her to continue her quest to complete the AT. I would help her make arrangements once there as I had looked in to a variety of options before Cathy and I decided to make the trip home a vacation.

This is the last stop Cathy and I will make before heading home. We've been meandering home now for 5 days...and my feet still feel those PA rocks!  
 

This last day dawned with both Fiddle and me anxious to get in to the Water Gap. She to figure out how to get hone, me to await my bride's arrival on Friday....like getting there early would speed that up! Just anxious to see her after almost a month and to begin our vacation.

 

A beautiful day greeted us and we hoped for a mostly downhill hike...and of course I think we all knew that PA would send us off with a few more lovely rocks! At the Delaware Water Gap the trail crosses the Delaware River in to New Jersey and leaves PA behind. 
 

Our destination for today includes The Church of the Mountains Hostel, a very welcoming place provided by a local Presbyterian church in Delaware Water Gap. Bloodhound who had already passed through on his AT hike in 2010 had already whet our appetites with tales of food to come. Remember AT hikers talk food, town food, almost constantly...trail food keeps you going but it is not considered ""real"" food. That label is reserved for pizza, hamburgers, and other delites  found in town. Bloodhound has been telling us for a few days now about a pastry shop that also serves real food...it's signature dish....hot dog and apple pie....sounds odd and oddly good!

 

As expected there were a few final sections of rock, but to our delight more good trail than not. On this last day of hiking as a team we stopped for a couple of photo opps...even passed a day hiker who took one of the three of us with the water gap in the background. At a scenic pond almost to town we stopped for our last ""Pack off"" rest...not that we needed the rest but just to enjoy a few more minutes together in the woods.

 

The AT enters town and immediately turns north to cross a bridge it New Jersey. We turned south to the hostel just a couple of hundred yards from the trail. Most still there were in the process of leaving. There is a two day limit at this donation based hostel.  Suggested donation is $3 per day, which includes shower but no laundry. For me the motel where I will meet Cathy has a laundry. PTL...I wouldn't want dirty clothes to be packed away as we meander home....not clothes this dirty. 
 

Packs put on bunks as our reservations we headed toward Food!! DWG as one can imagine, located in the mountains of NE Pennsylvania, is hilly. Walking hills without our packs felt odd, but my it was nice. Like a magnet the outfitters...The Edge of the Mountains...drew us in as we passed on the way to eat.  I quickly decided that the cotton t-shirts on sale were a must....synthetic is great but after many days and several not even taking mine off at night, I longed for cotton.

 

Sure enough, just as Bloodhound had advised, the special was a hot dog and a slice of pie for $2.95!! I opted to add sour kraut for $.50 more. Actually the apple pie I had chosen tasted mighty good after that dog and kraut. Filled me up pretty good too. On the way back up to the hostel, Fiddle and me detoured to the bus station...again up hill. Fiddle needed to get to Waynesboro, VA to get her car, I to nearby east Stroudsburg to the Econo Lodge. 
 

Fiddle had many options combining bus, train and shuttle once near Waynesboro. My best option ended up being a local shuttle from people associated with the hostel /church. We walked back to the hOster with information to ponder in regards to Fiddle's options. First showers then the conquering of that. On the way we decided to treat Bloodhound to dinner as he was continuing north to Maine.

 

After showers, we gathered at a gazebo next to the church to relax, stay cool and recharge phones before dinner. You know a place is ""hiker friendly"" when the gazebo has electric outlets for cell recharging!  While there we also helped Fiddle make decisions on getting home. The final, easiest, and most direct solution was by Greyhound Bus to Washington DC and then on Charlottsville; and from there a shuttle to Waynesboro. The good news too was that it left here tonight at 9:30!  And that was plenty of time for our final meal and goodbyes.

 

For dinner we chose a place we had passed on the way earlier that was offering a barbecue rib special....my meal was half a rack, salad, fries, slaw and ice tea.  A great meal to send us all on our way.

 

Here at Delaware Water Gap we also ran into several old friends...all of whom we figured were well ahead of us. One guy, a really strong hiker, McFly, I had meet weeks ago and who was hiking with a rather large group of fast and long miles guys. We were both glad to see one another. An amazing part of relationships made on the AT are these and how quick they develop. 
 

At 8 Bloodhound and me saw Fiddle off as a shuttle took her to the bus station. She promised to text us as she headed first to New York City then south.

 

A bit melancholy we were after she left. Tomorrow Bloodhound and me would eat breakfast and hangout a while before I headed to my motel to do laundry and wait for Cathy to arrive on Friday. He planned to zero one more day then continue north on Friday.

So it goes with the ""best laid"" plans.  I will be starting this year (and praying that no road blocks pop up) at Delaware Water Gap.  Right now as plans are still being finalized, I will be aiming for Hanover, NH. Starting date will be late June/early July.",,View Entry,"Apr 17, Wed",0
Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616570,"Hello... Planning and waiting are coming to an end for 2019. Mail drops are just about all packed. Travel arrangements have been final now for several weeks, and I'm now into final details...like how to get home once I arrive in Hanover. NH. Per usual I'm looking forward to the trip to Delaware Water Gap. A bit of a long journey by train and bus but an adventure nonetheless. My food planning includes travel food as well...won't have such luxury on the way home...however that's going to happen.
Still lots to do in two weeks, including having our granddaughter for several days right before the weekend I leave. My plan is to have most everything done by end of this week.  Including an email to friends and family that this journal is again up and running. 
Since starting this AT journey in 2014, I have learned many things to streamline my gear, meals, etc.  But as I’ve been packing the last two days, food and other necessities mostly, it still seems I pack too much.  This time out I plan to purchase more food along the way and mail drop only main courses and other items I know will not be available at trail town shops and small grocery stores (e.g. Larry and Lenny cookies).  Time will be spent this week after all food and other supplies are in boxes, to see what I can remove. A pound here or there will be a benefit. Heading now into the northeast the AT goes through several towns and skirts others within easy hiking or hitching distance.  I just ponder how much time I will have or will want to take in going off-trail, only to need to get back to the trail on the same day to make my next camp spot. 
At this point my rough itinerary (ie. rough is the final format) includes many “short” days of 10 miles or less.  I think/anticipate that once I get back into some level of hiking shape (4 to 6 days in hopefully) daily miles can ramp up, especially in Connecticut, where the terrain is more level.  Recently, I discovered a problem with the itinerary in that a mail drop retrieval day was on a Saturday when the local post office closes at noon. The day before that I will push a couple of extra miles to help insure I get there before noon.  I also discovered today that when I changed a mail drop location I had not modified my meals – switching one to the previous box!! 
Enough said for now.  Really looking forward to what I hope will be my second to last section before finishing next year.

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617611,"Final Countdown…Less than 48 hours now before I catch a ride on the Amtrak Cardinal to Philadelphia, PA.  Lots of ends to tie up in the last two days. Also a couple of roadblocks that needed removing. Like an air conditioner that decided to stop.  PTL that I already had an estimate for this and that work was scheduled the next day (Friday, the 28th).  A “newbie” I guessing at the post office told me I could not mail to “General Delivery” that I needed a street address!  AT Guides don’t supply that information. Called the PO at Delaware Water Gap to confirm this was an error and followed up by going to a different post office…all is well now.  Whew! Thought I might have to redo all my box labels. Not that many but still a pain.
Picture attached is looking NOBO from the exact location I stopped at in Delaware Water Gap in 2017.  The blaze in the picture (look on the telephone pole) will be the first I pass on this hike.
Currently fighting the “just one more thing” conundrum. Besides stuff I might need, but likely not, for the actual hike is stuff I might want for the almost 32 hours of travel. I get on the Cardinal at 3:27 am Sunday; arrive in Philadelphia by way of Washington DC at 10:30ish and then pick up the Greyhound bus to Delaware Water Gap at 6:40 Monday morning.  What and how much reading materials, snacks/meals do I need and can I actually carry in a small backpack? All my gear will be in my Osprey pack in a duffle bag for transport. I don’t want to be in and out of that at all if possible during the trip. So I’m stuck with my smallish “day pack” that when stuffed into its bag fits in the palm of my hand. Certainly all will work out and those little items most likely left behind…and not needed nor missed. It’s just the thinking about all this that makes me even more anxious to get this trip started.  More so to finally be on the AT again.
On Friday, we barbequed chicken on the grill; enjoyed some ice cream and today Cath and I will be spending as much time just being together as possible.  Only real task outside of the house will be taking my second mail drop to the post office so it will arrive ahead of me in Unionville, NY next Saturday given the short week with the holiday.  I will see if that ugly little problem at the PO comes up again.","Lakeside Park, KY

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617756,"Early start today. We started off behind schedule, about 20 minutes. By the time we got through W. Va. We were behind by an hour. Potential issue for me was that I was to change trains to get to Philly and two hours to do so. After another delay in Staunton, VA. It appeared likely I could miss.
Thankfully this train also goes to Philly and the conductor told me I could stay on board. 
All that resolved and thankful I had brought along two sandwiches. Initially had hoped to buy food during layover in Washington. Finally arrived in Philly at 30th Street Station, which will be my “campsite"" for tonight. Actually a nice and comfortable wooden bench found in many of the old train stations. This is quite a nice place and rather busy for late on a Sunday night. Doubt that I will actually sleep but certainly feels safe enough to doze. 
Amazingly at this time ( about 11 pm) and after a 17 hour trip, I feel pretty good. Did get some napping in today, but a bit concerned lack of sleep will catch up to me tomorrow and/or Tuesday. Stay tuned. Maybe significant “butt"" time will count toward rest. Haven’t sat that long ever I don’t think.

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617834,"Interesting night…short of napped in brief spurts at the train estation and looking forward to the 3 hour bus ride and an opportunity to sleep in route to the trail head today. The station was quite busy all night. That kept the “Wizard of Oz"" like voice a constant companion all night. I could barely hear all that it said it was so loud and reverberated off the walls. According to my Garmin Vivosport I got a whopping 1 hour and 4 minutes of sleep last night on the bench at the train station. There weren’t many others doing the same but I was still surprised at the number. 
At 5 am I was ready to catch the commuter rail to the bus station. Figuring that out was the first challenge of the day. No employee showed at the information booth to assist and my train was to leave at 5:30. I asked an Amtrak police officer if he could help he seemed very happy to and even advised a different train. Once at the bus station that too was somewhat dicey. Very crowded, very cold and very poor communication with riders and which lines to be in and when.  Finally got that sorted out and underway at about 7AM. About 4 stops and 3 hours later I arrived in Stroudsburg, PA. The station actually is very close to Delaware Water Gap, which I knew from 2017, having stopped there before and helping Fiddle catch a bus to get home. 
A shortish downhill walk to the Gap. Check in time for my motel was 4 PM. Of course I was hoping to get in sooner…to sleep, shower, eat, etc. before starting my hike tomorrow. 
First stop was the outfitter to buy fuel, which cannot be transported by train. (Don’t tell anybody but I did bring along an almost empty can. A bit concerned about distance between resupply for fuel so want to carry just a little. Glad I got it through. Actually I  saw no luggage checks.) While at the outfitter they assisted with calling the motel as I didn’t have the local number. I was offered early check-in immediately for $20 or no charge if I waited until noon. Easy decision there. Noon was still 4 hours sooner than advertised!! With that I headed to the PO for my food pickup sent a few days ago and the “famous"" hot dog and apple pie lunch at the local bakery/deli/vegetable stand. Killed time easily eating outside and watching numerous hikers arriving. Many just off the trail.
A shower, nap and repacking the box with my travel clothing, etc and getting back to the PO was completed by 4! Then back to resting, hydrating and hopefully napping more before dinner.
Dinner was a very good chicken pot pie and water as I’m hydrating for tomorrow. During travel I didn’t drink nearly enough…so now catching up. Final packed my gear for tomorrow and will go to bed very early….still haven’t felt as tired as I think I should be. That is a little bothersome with my first day tomorrow including hiking up out of this Gap and carrying a fully loaded pack for the first time in a while.

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618215,"Finally underway today. Because of good fortune yesterday, I could start hiking about 7:30. With an early start and adequate endurance today I think 12 miles on day one doable. Delaware Water Gap: remember gap = up. Whenever in a gap the way out is a climb! Getting out of DWG was not too arduous today. First stop was at Backpackers campsite. This is a popular campsite maintained as such vs the many that while identified in guides a spot to camp have merely developed by use over the years. Here I took my first “pack off” rest at about 6 miles in. I wanted to ascertain that my fitness is good enough to double up and reach my goal of Mohican Outdoor Center. Felt great…helps that almost 3 of the first 6 were road walking to get out of town. 
I was quite tired and thirsty upon arriving…ran out of water between the trail crossing and the Center, about .3 miles. The place is awesome. Very hiker and outdoor friendly as the name implies. As soon as I stepped into the, but after being asked to leave my pack on the porch…a sign I hadn’t seen; I was offered a cold drink. Ten bucks for a nice “walk in"" campsite and shower. 
Every day they offer AYCE dinners. Every AT hiker, which comprised most guests, opted for rather hefty grilled sandwiches…me too. Another benefit is the lodge room with charging cables, games and showers stays open all night. Met two hiker in my age group…Legacy from Rochester, NY and Death March Dan from Knoxville. They had connected in March back in Georgia. 
Hoped to sleep great this first night and be ready to roll tomorrow and see how my endurance is. Typically I can count on 4 to 6 days to get “trail legs"" ready begin feeling comfortable for steady climbs and distance aiming for 10 to 12 per day.

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618217,"Very good night of sleep. Anticipated rain storm turned out to only be a few brief period of showers during the night. Tent was dry as bone in the morning. Good news because a wet tent would have sloed my start as I dried it first.
Legacy and Death March Dan were at the Lodge leaving as I arrived to top off water. Because they’ve been hiking so very long I guessed we wouldn’t see each other again. They were planning on about 4 more miles today than me. That said, of course I caught up with them. We hiked together to my campsite. On climbs they’d pull ahead but I caught up a bit after each. (Picture of them at one of the nice views along the trail today) 
Nearing the end of my day it became clearly evident my fitness was not nearly enough to press on with them. One last rock climb and the most arduous of the day, proved that. The plan was for them to take a long “pack off"" break at my campsite before moving on. While there they demonstrated the PCT bear hanging method for me. NJ is known for the most active bear population along the whole of the AT. We also determined that my source of water was .8 of a mile downhill…that would be a total of 1.6 more miles on my already exhausted legs/body. 
Decision time. How badly did I really need that water or did I have enough to cook dinner and make it to the next water about 1.4 miles up the trail. Probably could do that…But. This had been s hot day. I was needing water and a lot of it if I was to recover for tomorrow. For me really no decision and I had previously on the AT done similar distances for water. 
I set up camp. Even hung my bear bag just in case of an unwanted visitor…very unlikely in late afternoon. I loaded my little in-town pack with filter and dirty and clean water containers. Headed downhill. As I was leaving a group of day hikers from New York City we had seen earlier came by. They had come up this trail (Buttermilk Falls) and were heading back down to their car. They said there was not a spring or any water on the trail until at the actual falls about 2 miles. Trusting my Guthook guide, I figured and certainly hoped they just didn’t see the spring. Much of the trail going down was steep…I constantly prayed there was water source to be found…and dreaded the hike back up…especially if no water. In fact I would be in significant trouble if no water!!
I did have to search. A large area of ferns in a very shaded area indicated that water had at least been there. About 50 to 75 feet off trail I spotted trickling water over a large mossy rock. Bushwhacking over I heard several frogs jump in and PTL there were pools and running water. Filled my bottles, drank about 1 liter to hopefully get me back up hill. 
Up was just dreadful. Dead legs, hot day, and stopping about every 200 yards…. Finally got up but if I wasn’t already totally exhausted, I was now. I must have just sat for another hour wiping sweat and sipping a little water to catch my breath before starting to filter and refill. 
The effort had sapped my appetite, which is not good when in need of recovery. Luckily we had arrived quite early in the so enough daylight yet still to gain my appetite. 
Don’t know what time but as I was starting to cook, another hiker arrived. Shakera (?) a lady who just happened to be from Cincinnati. Go figure. Terrace Park to be exact. She was only going to be hiking a fee day. Having started very near, about 3 miles, she elected to conserve remaining water and get it up trail. 
No one else came in. 
For me it was recovery.. drink as much water as I could…but sparing what I would need tomorrow and early to bed.

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618288,"Woke up this morning feeling refreshed. A long sleep and restful night was good after yesterday’s debacle. My campmate hustled off to reach her much needed water. I had plenty to reach Branchville where I would refill. 
The day started good. Good weather, good trail for the most part and for a while not too much heat. I was looking forward to Branchville where several restaurants and other stores are very near the AT road crossing. A rather short hike to the road – 7.5 miles. 
For me those 7.5 miles became longer as within less than two I began to feel the effects from yesterday’s efforts. Plans change, especially hiking plans, and mine did. I hadn’t checked much about getting off trail in Branchville except for lunch and head on another 3 miles to camp. About halfway to the road crossing I began faltering big time. Stopping frequently, especially on any uphill. Just nothing in the tank. Most likely I had dehydrated yesterday without nearly enough water or electrolytes or time to recover. Similar has happened before. 
Fortunately, meeting up with two SOBO slack packers, actually husband and wife, whom I’d met two days ago, provided the answer. A friend had stayed at a motel in Branchville and they thought space may be available. At that point I was less than two miles, maybe about one, from the road. Immediately stopped, found the phone number in the guide…and PTL they had a room and pick up hikers at the trailhead. I’m here now resting, watering up like a camel and hoping tomorrow bodes better than today. I have several action plan depending on how I feel once hiking begins. Tomorrow may be very short or at most less than ten miles. Right now I feel good, but won’t know how recovered until feet hit the trail. 
Waiting for my ride I had a nice lunch. Drank a lot of ice water and tea/lemonade mix (Arnold Palmer). Didn’t realize until at the motel that I’d used almost ¾ of the water I carried today. From here on I really need to watch my supply and maybe carry more with me….ugh! Water is the heaviest necessity we carry. Food is second but that varies depending on how many days between resupply. 
Here’s hoping tomorrow shows recovery and progress toward getting into hiking shape for this journey.

A bit of a late start today but because of need to pay more attention to my fitness and recovery from yesterday, I planned less miles. Including an option to stop short. Water is becoming an issue in these parts too. Some very sketchy water sources to be avoided if at all possible.
From the outset the day started well. A climb of course to start but once up pretty good going. Still rocky and at this point thru-hikers as well as me (after a year off) are just plain tired of the continuing “Pennsylvania” rocks. An interesting site today, called Sunrise Mountain. It’s an open area with an ancient pavilion type shelter. Early 1900’s I’m guessing. A place where people apparently went to gaze at the rising and setting sun. One could actually camp in it if they had adequate water with them. It was a hot day but quite comfortable in the shelter. 
My first stop and alternate final if needed was the Gren Andersen Shelter. Here I decided to move on but due to water concern, I packed out one liter of dirty (unfiltered) water. “Only"" an extra 2 to 3 ponds to carry. At Mashapacong it is known that local volunteers often supply water. Not knowing for sure that would be available and not wanting water issues again if at all possible….I carried just in case.
Sure enough plenty of water in 5 gallon jugs at the shelter. Still glad I carried the water….might need to carry it tomorrow if water up ahead is scarce. 
Really nice tenting area at Mashapacong and privy. When I arrived only one hiker there. A guy hiking south. Not much of a talker and hid in his tent most of the afternoon. I did glean that he is from Oklahoma and was born in Louisville. Within a couple of hours we were getting a good group staying the night. A couple my age, Lolly and Pops, from Spokane were thru-hiking but had taken time off trail and even jumped ahead some to stay on “schedule” I think. Others: Buck, Strider, and Mr. White their white dog; and Rastice (?) a most interesting guy from Australia.

At Unionville I would then have to wait until the PO opened on Monday morning to get mail drop. Before the debacle of two days ago and falling behind schedule, I had hoped to make Unionville today and before noon to retrieve that. Once I couldn’t I plugged in this short day to help ensure recovery and more gradually get my trail legs.
This New Jersey area is really beautiful. Whatever or however you think about NJ, it’s likely not about this beauty in the mountains. Todays hike took me through ridge and valley section just very green and lush. Also today’s and a little yesterday hikes took me past rock wall remnants of past settlements. These have always attracted me and been attractive. 
Bad news is that after only about 3.5 miles my energy started to fade. Legs tired again way too soon. Of course by that time to the day was heating up. After hiking down to the visitor center at the Highpoint State Park, which is where water is available, restrooms, etc. I was informed by park employees that a strong thunderstorm was headed this way. Sure couldn’t tell by looking. 
Being that the rest of my hike was uphill and only about a mile plus to go and I was exhausted I decided to hangout at the center.
They were providing a free soft drink to all AT hikers. Quite a treat. First trail magic I’ve had. 
Got to thinking that feeling this tired that maybe I could just hitch a ride or otherwise get into Unionville and maybe a good idea too with the storm. About then it started raining. Got my gear inside right before things got very wet. When I had arrived say 20 or 30 minutes previously there were only a couple of other hikers here. Dark skies suddenly brought more in. I think most all AT hikers, as opposed to local day hikers, stop here for water…not to mention restrooms too. The storm brought them in in droves. As that was happening I had decided to get to Unionville. Tried Uber for the very first time…visitor center staff said Uber was the least expensive mode. 
Was having no luck with that when a soaked to the bone hiker, Tigerlilly, overheard me and wanted a ride as well. She’s a thru-hiker from Dayton OH…go figure…and a former student at Cedarville University where my son-in-law teaches…small world. Anyway some of her hiking partners started calling in and we all ended up at Mosey's Hostel in Port Jervas NY. Cost with shuttle, laundry and breakfast just a tad more than an Uber ride…and in Unionville we would be tenting. Probably in rain or certainly on wet ground. 
Besides Tigerlilly we have: Rebel from Tucson, who owns several restaurants; Try-Try, from Nashville (on her second attempt at s thru-hike); Shock Top from Denver, who is an amazing hiker averaging over 20 miles per day; finally Just Dave, a section hiker like me, but who has been hiking already a few weeks. 
Dinner was at a microbrewery in Port Jervis. At dinner I had the pleasure to sit next to Just Dave. Very interesting guy. Lives in Asheville, teaches ROTC, a former West Pointer and Special Forces. I finished a book about the first group of those guys that went into Afganistan, the horse soldiers. Just Dave is close friends with all those guys! Now that was very interesting and inspiring conversation. 
Mosey is a thru-hiker from 2015 who started this hostel in her home upon finishing her hike. Very welcoming and accommodating a real pleasure to be staying with. Tomorrow she will take me to Unionville where I will  camp (hopefully not in the rain) and wait for the PO to open on Monday for my resupply. 
Word has it that this year a nearby drive-in- theater is inviting hikers to camp for free…Including a movie. One version has them giving leftovers from concessions to hikers as well. Don’t know if that’s my “ cup of tea""

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618440,"After a rather tough first week back on the AT after a year off and continuing to battle getting into hiking shape, I  decided an unplanned zero day (no miles day) was best. A good opportunity arose at High Point SP and coincided with me not making it to Unionville by Saturday noon, July 6. PO closed and would not be open until Monday, July 8. 
I really enjoyed Mosey’s Hostel but didn’t want to pay more when free camping was available at the Unionville City Hall and Park. Arrived there around three with only two tents already in place. A great spot to be in to choose a location. Many more were expected so taking early advantage was a nice perk. Sure enough by nightfall the park of about 2 acres with a play lot, basketball court and short walking trail was full hikers and tents.
One popular draw here is Annabels Pizza. And that happens to be located directly across the street. Upon arrival I met one hiker already set up. Shade fron Michigan. She was hiking with her dog, a Vizsla, which I had never heard of. A really well behaved nice looking pet. Also  she had been through here before and provided good information on the area. 
First priority was getting a permit at Horlers General Store, another iconic place in this town. Being immediately off the trail most every hiker stops in…and of course free camping helps to. 
Wanting to save a few bucks, I ate an early dinner of the last meal in my food bag. And also my favorite trailside beans and cheese burrito. Later I would venture over to Annabels for a slice of stromboli pizza, a drink and to charge my phone. Most every place serving hikers offer charging. 
Rain is forecast for tonight so after dinner I prepared by “tightening” my camp and doing what I could to prepare for leaving tomorrow in wet conditions. One good aspect is also that rain will bring cooler weather for at least half the day. 
Tonight will be interesting also because the park is equipped with large security lights that are motion activated. I tried to set up to account for that…we’ll see.

Today I have to wait for the PO to open at 8am to retrieve my mail drop. With an anticipated leaving time of 8:30, I have plenty of time to carefully pack up within the confines of my one person tent and endeavour to avoid getting gear, other than my tent, wet. 
Looking out at the crowded campsite it appears that very few are preparing to leave. This is an advantage I will take. You see there is a gazebo. A dry gazebo no one is using. It’s a bit of a distance but as items are ready I dash them to there. Last up a wet tent. I have taken a tip from Mark Zaccone a Sheltowee friend, and have packed an extra bag to put my went canopy in. Separating that from the rest will keep the body mostly dry and more quickly dried when that opportunity arises. 
I’m ready with a load of time to spare before the PO opens. It’s located right next door and very near the gazebo where I’m waiting in dryness. In and out of the PO in seconds and food bag filled and off by 8:30. Still raining but off with the raincoat!! It will be way to warm today, especially carrying a pack, to be heating up under that.

After the .4 mile road walk back to the farm market and and apple cider donut or two…one wrapped and packed for tonight’s desert..it’s onward and upward on the Stairway. 
Per usual the Stairway is a boulder climb. Actually as these have been going so far not bad at all. Several day hikers out today as at the top is an awesome view (see picture). One group was comprised of mothers, fathers, and two very energetic little boys. I was behind them for a while and certainly enjoyed watch the two little guys scramble up, over or around the rock. Laughing and having a grat time. They finally arrived at the top as I was leaving and still laughing and having fun. 
The view of the valley, of which I don’t have a name, was well worth the hike up. In the photo I can see but can’t adequately describe, the grove of trees on the Ricky farm where I camped last night.

After the climb today’s hike was pretty blah. The only other highlight being that I saw Just Dave again. He had gotten off trail to visit a college (West Point) friend. Given his background and the little we discussed over dinner a few days ago, he puts in at least double the miles that I do. Very nice guy. Sure glad to have seen him again.
The shelter and location for tonight was fine. A nice well maintained privy, which is a nice thing and easily accomplished when shelters are close to trailheads. At this one when I went to sign log, a guy had left several walking sticks as gifts. They were quite nice. Laminated or encased in a plasticky type of material. I would have taken o e but carrying it along with two trekking poles would have been a bit too cumbersome. 
With plent of time I could choose my tent site, and leisurely set up before others arrived. Word is that this location is popular. Sure enough true…by dusk it was filling up. 
To bed early. A long day tomorrow and a great stop at a ice cream place right off trail.

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620190,"Yes, I was in Unionville, NY a couple of days ago. That village lies within about .1 of the NJ state line. I was immediately the next day back in NJ.
In for a long day after a short one. The road crossing with ice cream is almost 10 miles with another 2 beyond to shelter. Given the many rock climbs of today, one requiring the assistance of a rebar ladder in rock, it was certain to be a long one. I like these climbs, really do, challenging and energy consuming but once up the views and walking here in NY are generally ok. Now getting down of each csn be tricky…and slow. A major disadvantage of the geology of these mountains in that these formations are in a row but not connected. That means…up and down, and back up and down…repeated about 15 to 20 times today.
Well by the time I finally made the creamery I was much in need and without a significant rest there the final two miles upon arrival seemed impossible.  Amazing what good ice cream (…wanted sorbet for thirst, but not enough calories so strawberry it was), and an hour + rest can do. In addition I had some terrific orange drink made specifically for the creamery…two in fact!
Good rest stop and back on trail to go the final two miles. Walked out with an interesting thru-hiker from VA, Martha Stewart, a guy folks! He got the name for being a stickler and keeping places and thing in order early on and complaining when appliances at the first stop out of Springer Mountain GA didn’t work as good as he thought they should. Terrific young man. It would be great to see him again but he didn’t stop at Wildcat.
Once back on trail about 1.2 of the first miles was practically flat. Then of course the day couldn’t end without a couple more rock climbs.
Wildcat is a large area, popular in part because water is immediately available from a very good and cold source. Water is a major challenge in these parts. Very few locations and fewer with good water. Many are outflows from the numerous bogs and pond which look black and tend to taste bad even with using a good filter. I always look for flowing water and so far have not had too much issues. I have however carried “dirty"" water a couple of times to make sure that I had enough. Extra weight, ugh.
Mosquitoes here were nasty, nasty. A little dampness  I guess makes for that. I carefully and quickly set my tent up, zipped the screen closed and kept those suckers out. Hopefully when I had to get in to sleep I could do it fast enough to keep most out…I did! Yay!
Tonight a couple of hikers here I’d met previously. Jazz Hands and the couple from Spokane, Lolly and Pop. Also met Tartan, about my age from Austin, TX.
As expected because everyone stops for ice cream, several arrived late. Even after I was in my tent resting and falling asleep. Before sleep I called ahead to reserve a motel room in Tuxedo, NY. It’s two miles from the road crossing and they don’t come pick up. Looks like my first hitchhiking this time out.

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618694,"After a very restful night it was off to reach the trailhead on NY 17 in Southfield/Harriman, NY at 6:45am. The motel guy I talked to last night asked when I might arrive. When I said the very earliest would be noon. Upon which, in his very Noo Yoork accent said “no, no, you can’t do that. There’s no way I can have a room ready before 3.”. To which I responded that if I got there early I could just hang out and wait. And with a grunt, he acknowledged and we hung up. 
Little did I know at the time what adventures this day would hold! The day started with a mile or so of easyish trail. And then the fun began. Actually it was…but today held the pleasure (a cuss word should precede, pleasure) of well over a dozen rock climbs. Friends I was nearing complete exhaustion near to what I thought based on mileage left to hike, was the downhill to NY 17. 
Along the way today at a nice water stop I finally meet a guy others had mentioned from Western KY. They could not come up with his trail name. It’s Freedom and he’s from Murray, KY. Very nice young man. We chatted for maybe 15 minutes. I think I know why folks could recall his name. Bet they know that of his hiking ³partner…a quite attractive young lady from Germany. Apparently they’ve been hiking together a lot since Georgia. 
At what I thought was the last climb and nearing exhaustion, there was Freedom, who offered to help me up. It was really more of a climb requiring hands than legs…not real good for a guy with weak shoulders and tired to boot. 
We got up and over that one and Freedom had to move on as he had 15 more miles to go. Me, about one. 
That one mile was the absolute worst of all my miles to date on the AT! Packed in to that distance was at least 5 more very difficult, and difficult even if I hadn’t been so exhausted, rock climbs. At one point I stood on the down side of one looking across a crevass of about 15 feet to the immediate next climb. Knew I couldn’t make it without a “pack off"" rest first. Also, with remaining water in a bottle and hoping enough remained in the platypus bladder inside my pack, I mixed lemonade for a sugar fix and quick energy shot. Got up and over. And there were more. Very discouraging and confusing because most patrs of trails, but not all, ease down. This one did not. Once at point where I was for certain over the last section of rock climbing, I finally could see the end. Only one, actually two more challenges, maybe three if hitchhiking two miles to motel is added. First, was an almost sheer rock slope. One that at least twice as I remember required turning around backwards to both hold on snd get good footing. Second it was starting to rain. Let’s get the heck off this hill quick! Once on the road, rain getting steady, I stuck out my thumb. One big truck, one SUV, do the turn around to walk with thumb out and not facing 
traffic and PTL, the next car pulls off to pick me up. A young guy, 2016 thru-hiker, from the area and in the area for the day and to attend a trail maintenance workshop…PORK ROLL!! Not only did he pick me up, but also time to kill until his meeting, he took us to get cold drinks and then to a very good pizza place, the Pizza Pit. Pork Roll knows the area well as he lives about an hour away in New Jersey and hikes and mountain bikes at Harriman Park, which is right here.
Because of the odd phone call I had with the Tuxedo, Pork Roll stayed with me to see that all was well before leaving.
After a very bad day, the appearance and help of Pork Roll was a good ending. Friends, I was close, very close to calling if quits after today and several previously. In other words my attitude sucked. 
A good conversation with Cathy, rest, shower and clean clothes (a much appreciated service provided by the Tuxedo) started getting me into a more positive outlook to where I decided to think of other options. Including a zero day tomorrow.
Good night this hiker is more than ready and in need of sleep and rest.

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618695,"Yesterday I was within a “nats hair"" of calling it quits for 2019. After a desperately hard day and a not very positive attitude given an easy opportunity I may have gotten off trail. A good meal and trail magic, shower, talking with Cathy, and sleep caused my spirits to lift and make plans to move forward. 
A day of rest, where I only left this room to walk to a nearby food mart is making me now ready to head out tomorrow. This morning dialing into my men's group where they prayed for me was also very uplifting. Couldn’t have timed a bad day much better. PTL. 
Will be trying Uber for the first time ever tomorrow. Sure hope that works.
One more night in motel….

Logman,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618914,"Well friends I woke up this
morning with plans to catch shuttle/Uber to Ft. Montgomery and next mail drop.
But.... That did not happen. My tired aching body was just not ready to
go!  After reflection, prayer and just listening for guidance, I got a
clear word that it was time to give this AT 2019 hike up. Minimize further
""losses"", get home, consult with Cathy and determine what happens
next.  
Usually, it takes me 4 to 5
days to get my ""trail legs"".  In the past each day I have been
able to recognize improvements.  This time not much during the almost two
weeks of hiking.  Due to difficulties and timing (missed mail drop in
Unionville, NY) I had two zero days in two weeks. Plenty of time to rest and
recover. And did as each day afterwards I felt recovered. Neither had been
planned, but I was concerned that I might miss arriving in Unionville by noon
on Saturday, which would necessitate an unplanned zero. Sure
enough.  
The hike in to
Southfields/Harriman, where the trailhead to Tuxedo is located, was extremely
tough!  As noted previously, one rock climb would have been particularly
problematic without an assist from Freedom.  (A map I've seen since
arriving home labels part of this section ""Agony Grind"". It sure
was.) This little bit was the icing on the cake, I think, that sapped my energy
to a level of very slow recovery.  I recall what my friend, Ed Spoon, said
when hearing I was heading out; ""it will be hot you know"".  How
correct and perhaps one issue I was not dealing with very well as it had not
been hot for long at home. Not to be disappointed...I met several very
interesting hikers.  Several from near home. Photographed numerous awesome
views.  Experienced the bogs of New Jersey and New York, which are very
beautiful and for this time of the year not as ""buggy"" as
expected.  These were one feature of this section hike I was anxious to
see.  Mission accomplished.  
Challenge for this day would
not be hiking, but how to actually get home from Tuxedo.  After several phone
calls to Greyhound, to the New Jersey Transit Authority (I think the proper
name), I decided to just take Uber all the way to Newark Penn Station. 
Cost was not much more that other means and would be direct without confusing
transfers on a system totally unfamiliar.  Result, first Uber experience.
Awesome young guy driving, Marlin, from Jamaica.  We talked a bit while
driving.  Uber for him is a quite lucrative side hustle.  Once at the
bus station, it was a six hour wait for a 15 hour bus trip.  Thankfully,
only one transfer. And also thankful I had downloaded enough movies/tv shows
and ebooks.
