Mountaindo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/601436,"It was about 6 years ago when a good friend of mine let my wife and I use his cabin in Pigeon Forge Tennessee. He told me to hike up to one of the falls near Gatlinburg. When I reached the falls about a dozen people were climbing all over the falls, so I decided to keep on going up the trail. After about 3 more hours of hiking I reached the top of the mountain and saw a sign that said Appalachian trail 6 miles. When we got home I decided to look up the trail on the internet and started reading all about it. That was the beginning of the dream and desire to eventually become a thru-hiker. Now that I have recently retired I have found the time I will need to complete this dream.",,View Entry,"Aug 23, Thu",0

I have enjoyed the amazing views of God's creation and hope to see a lot more.

The picture above shows Long Creek Falls it was beautiful.  It was a long day with a lot of ups and downs along with rocks and roots by the time I got to the 10 1/2 mile marker I was through for the night. It was a long night because it was about 25° and with 15 to 20 mile an hour winds. I didn’t sleep much I was just trying to stay warm which is probably not gonna help me tomorrow cause I want to do another 10 1/2 Miles.

It looks like a long down hill to Lance creek where I ended up taking a 20 minute lunch break. Then the tough stuff started, the rain started, the wind started blowing and I am walking in the clouds. The highlight of the day was to be getting to the top of Blood mountain and have great views. Unfortunately when you are walking in the clouds there are no views. So when I got to the shelter on top of Blood mountain I snapped a few pictures and headed down to Neels gap. To make things worse I missed a turn in the trail and ended up bush wacking my way to the AT. I finally got down to the gap and found all the rooms were taken. So while I was trying to figure out what to do a guy came in to say he was giving up his bunk and see if anyone else would like it don’t you know I raised my hand immediately. The Lord does provide.

Supposedly 20 percent of those that quit are at this point. Met a guy named Dave who walked about as slow as I do so we were able hike together and talk which seems to make the time go by quicker.

I was sweating bad and the wind was really blowing hard so I took some photos and hustled down. So after another 12 mile day I set up my tent to let it air out since it rained hard all night,everything was wet. While my tent is airing out somebody said there’s trail magic down the hill by a service road.

We weren’t sure what to do but we hoped that if he walked on it this morning it would feel better as he went along but that did not happen either. Gus felt that if he stopped walking on it it would swell up or not be able to use it at all so we decided to try to get down to the Nantahala outdoor center as quick as possible.  Today was our longest day yet and one of our slowest because of Gus’s knee but we had to get down to get a warm bed and not have to spend the night in the cold. We got down there about 6 o’clock got our room and went and had something to eat hoping that a good nights sleep might make it feel better.

We were talking about camping at the Wayah Bald Shelter but there were quite a few people with tents already set up on some not so flat ground so we pushed on another 1.3 miles and found several nice spots to ourselves.  Unfortunately Gus was complaining about his left knee hurting him , hopefully tomorrow morning it will feel better.

But I am excited to finally get out of the smokies so I don’t have to sleep in shelters I can sleep in my tent again.  It’s been a long day and just as I figured my ankle is giving me some problems so I am going to stop short of getting out of the Smokies today and stay at Davenport gap shelter.

So it was a nice walk along a nice dream as you can see from the picture I followed that for bottom mile was very scenic. After I left the Smokies life go underneath I 40 overpass and start my hike right back up the mountains.  I hiked up a very steep Trail until I got to the standing bear hostel which I  stopped in for a resupply for only about a half hour. Unfortunately when you come down a long ways down to a gap or road you know what’s coming it’s another steep climb up to the top of another mountain.  Today was no exception I was very difficult to get to the top of this next section very steep and very tiring. Knowing that I only did 10.7 miles today figuring I was going to be very tired by the end of the day which turned out to be the truth.

The big site for today was going to be Max patch I chose you see in the photo is another big bald on the top of the mountain. The climb was pretty much uphill most of the day and then when we got to Max patch there’s a lot of people that are up there they can drive within a few hundred yards of the actual summit. Sometimes I wonder why the trail doesn’t follow  The road it would make it a lot easier for us hikers instead of going straight up and straight back down but that’s the way they designed the trail. But when I did get to the top I scored some trail magic there was a couple of people who hiked the trail in 2015 who is giving away food and drinks you can ever pass that up when you’re hiking. I’m trying to keep the miles up because I know in a couple of days I will be in Hot Springs.Unfortunately my ankle is still giving me some problems it’s very sore in the evening and I keep hoping that after I rest it overnight it will feel better and it does in the morning but shortly there after it starts hurting again.

So wouldn’t you know it as I was just getting my pack completely done the snow starts as you can see from the picture it wasn’t a lot but still made things a little slippery. In fact on my way down to Hot Springs since it’s fairly steep I stepped on a wet root and sure enough I fell for the second time. Luckily when I fell I fell on my pack so nothing is really hurting. Today started with a step up as usual until I got the bluff mountain and then it was a long 5 miles down to the gap and that also was very steep. I then had about 3 miles of small ups and downs until the last long downhill in the Hot Springs. I truly tried to hustle down to Hot Springs today as quick as possible because tomorrow they were predicting a lot of 19° So a lot of the hikers that were already in the hostel will probably spend another night there that means it’ll probably fill up quickly. The trail goes right next to the hostel as you leave the woods so I walked right over there and asked the owner if there were any banks available and luckily there was two spots left so I quickly grabbed one.  Since I got there by 2:30 they at least gave me enough time to get a quick shower do some laundry and going to town for a bite to eat. Hot Springs is a very little town with one main street a few restaurants,a bar, a post office along with  A dollar general and very few residents. They do have a hot springs spa but I didn’t wanna pay the $65 to sit in the hot tub.

We talk together about what kind of mileage we wanted to do and we decided to try to get to Erwin Tennessee by Friday. That means we would have to average 14 miles a day for five days which would equal 70 miles to Erwin. So today started off like most days with a pretty steep up but according to the book it didn’t look too bad once we got over firescald knob. Boy were we wrong it was a long hike up a very steep trail but once we got to the top then it will seem like it turned into a rock scramble. Somebody did a lot of work to place the rock so we could climb up them but man was that tough.For a mile and a half we had to scramble over a lot of rocks and even put our trekking  poles away sometimes just to be able to climb up or down them.

We always love trail magic.  Of course whenever you come down to a road or a crossing the next thing is to head up a big hill and that’s what it was for the next couple of miles,once we got over the top of that it was a couple miles down to the shelter for the evening. A couple of us were getting ready to set up a tent when a guy came down from the shelter and said there’s trail magic up here at the shelter if you want some food. Course without hesitation we dropped everything and headed up to the shelter.To fine gentleman hiked 2 miles with fried chicken,Sodas and fruit. Can you believe a trail magic twice in one day and I don’t even have to cook dinner. I forgot to mention yesterday that we actually crossed the 300 mile mark Only about 1900 more miles to go.

Of course we head up the hill to see what that’s about and find out there’s a gentleman named quiet Paul who previously hiked the trail and is ready to service breakfast. But before we could sit down and have anything to eat we had to do a small chore of raking leaves in a small cemetery Next to where his truck was parked. We gladly raked and threw the leaves over the fence and by the time we were done he had eggs and hashbrowns ready for us. We scored two times of trail magic yesterday and already trail magic this morning it’s a great start to a day. After trail magic we had a pretty good climb but we ended up coming into this meadow which is in the picture, and if you look closely behind or if you can blow it up big bald is right behind me up at the top of the mountain. It’s tough when you can see where you got to go for the day the ridge in the background is 5 miles away and we know it’s a long steep climb uphill.Then it was just as we expected there were some big big climbs for the day but we were rewarded by some great views and some nice open meadows to walk-through.Thanks for reading and following.","Hogback Ridge Shelter

So unfortunately I had a put a heavy wet tent in my backpack along with my wet food bag that was hanging over night. But when you know you’re getting into town at the end of the day your pace quickens. So I got up before most of the others packed everything and headed down the mountain. Mrs. do and I had planned to meet up here in Erwin Wayback when I was planning to hike so she was on schedule to meet me here at about 4 o’clock this afternoon. Since it was raining this morning I didn’t even have anything to eat but wouldn’t you know it as we got to the first road crossing which is about 2 1/2 miles away there was trail magic. Cowbell who it is a former hiker also did trail magic way back at Fontana dam and was here feeding us hamburgers for breakfast. That gave me enough energy to be able to hike quickly and not have to stop for lunch.  There were a few ups today but not too bad since the trail is heading down into town it usually means you’re going downhill most of the time.  I reached the edge of town at about 4:30 PM and Mrs. do was down there waiting for me with a nice cold Mountain Dew. So we were able to make town in five days covering 70 miles, fortunately my ankle is still bothering me so I am planning on taking my first real zero day tomorrow I’m looking forward to a good rest day.It’s time to get to the motel, get a shower, do some laundry and go out for some dinner.

When we got to the top we thought we were going to have some nice views we must’ve had to get off the trail to see those views because we were in the woods the whole time. But we did finally get our great views from the top of round bald and Jane bald. We had several nice 360° views it was beautiful. The next iconic thing we saw was the over mountain shelter after a long downhill, this shelter is iconic because it is an old red barn that got converted into a shelter.  From the shelter it had a great view of a deep valley and some high mountains on both sides. Unfortunately we had to climb to the very top of one of those high mountains which was a little hump mountain. We looked at our book to see where we could camp for tonight and we thought between Little hump Mountain and hump Mountain might be a good place to stop. Fortunately when we got there there were no tent spot  or water but the box says there was both so our next option was just to go up over hob Mountain which is a very steep climb straight up and then back down again.

It never did rain and the weather was actually pretty nice. We did 13.6 miles in approximately six hours which is telling us that were physically in pretty good shape. The knees and the ankles seem to be holding up well. It was a real nice hike today with not many high ups or downs and we were able to walk next to the elk River which was a beautiful fast-moving river.

I saw a lot of people today just out for the day or the weekend which makes me concerned that the campground that I was hoping to stay at tonight is going to be full. I stopped off at the Lewis Mountain Campground for lunch and talk to one of the employees there and he told me that all the campgrounds are full.  Today’s terrain was like usual and a Shenandoah was up to the top of the ridge walk the rocks on the ridge come back down but nothing too steep or high today. Sure enough when I got to big Meadows Campground it was full, so I stopped at the camp store and got a soda and figured I’d keep on going.  So after a big Meadows Campground the next hot was about 3 1/2 more miles, I didn’t really want to do over 20 but I didn’t have much choice. I got down to the heart and it was only one other person there named wild child, and as we ate dinner several more people showed up that were out for the weekend.

So we ended up hiking most of the day to gather sometime she was farther ahead and then I would catch her on the downs. I think the only reason I caught up to her at all was because her feet are in such bad shape, her shoes don’t seem to fit her properly and are wearing out. In the Shenandoah national park there are several ways sides that serve food, drinks, and souvenirs. I talked to wild child and she was planning on making the elk wallow wayside which was almost 23 miles,  she asked me if I was going to do the same but I told her I didn’t think I could do that far.

It rained hard for about a half hour but luckily we were at the wayside so we were able to take cover there.

While we were walking I made wild child a deal I told her that if she wanted to Mrs. do was going to pick us up tonight and bring us both back to the camper where she could get cleaned up and a good meal.  I told her that meant that she could be slack pack tomorrow also if she wanted to stay with us one more night, it didn’t take much convincing to get her to except the invitation. We were happy to have her come stay with us for a night and hope she enjoyed the time off the trail and a little recuperation. This is due is now back from Washington DC and  visiting family and is able to come get us for a night in a soft bed, it’s so exhilarating. So we took wild child out for a dinner it made her feel it at home. If she’s reading this I hope she doesn’t get upset but she reminds me of a starving college student even though she’s 27 and on her own.  I’m not really looking forward to tomorrow because tomorrow’s got the roller coaster for 13 1/2 miles. The roller coaster is a series of steep ups and downs for the whole length of it, it’s probably one of the hardest sections on the trail. And not only that were planning on a 21 1/2 mile day.At least we’re getting a good meal, a good nights rest and a light pack for tomorrow. Thanks Mrs. do.

It was just as I feared very steep ups and very steep downs with a lot of rocks. Sometimes you don’t mind the step ups and downs because you know they’re coming but when They throw all the boulders and rocks on the trail your feet just hurt all day long.We were excited though because today we finally get out of Virginia, it is the longest state the trail Is in and it’s for just over 500 miles. Sometimes the state seems like it will never end, but that’s for down and 10 to go and the next few are going to go by quickly. While the child and I were having a tough day today and about 3 miles short of the black burn center we both seem to hit a wall and could hardly keep going. We had told Mrs. do to try to meet us there by 5 o’clock and we didn’t make it there till a little after 6 PM. I told wild child she could come home to the camper with us again tonight but she wanted to stay at the Blackburns center so she could get up early Tomorrow and get into Harpers Ferry early so she could meet up with family and hopefully get her new shoes.I said my goodbyes to her and Mrs. do and I headed back to the camper, I think I will see her again because she’s going to take a couple of zero days while I take one to move the camper so she will probably catch me in a few days.

She drop me back off at the black burn center and headed for Harpers ferry to do a little sightseeing. I got on trail about 8 AM and walked into Harpers ferry in about 12:30 PM. Mrs. do pick me up in town and took me over to the AT Conservancy to have my picture taken. The headquarters for the Conservancy is in Harpers Ferry, they have all the through hikers come in and have their picture taken along with their information and then it’s put into a book for anyone to see. My number was 383, which means only 383 hikers have reached this point so far. When I started In Georgia I was number 576 to leave there. I know a lot of other hikers who starred it after me half past me already which goes to show how many people have dropped out. Harpers Ferry is considered the mental halfway point of the trail even though mileage wise it’s not.  I still have about 65 miles to do before I am to the actual halfway point which is in Pine Grove furnished State Park Pennsylvania. It was nice I met Mrs. do close to 1 o’clock we went to the Conservancy had that taken care of then we went for lunch and after that we spent some time looking around the historic town.

I walked by Jefferson rock, the big church in the picture, down through town And Across the bridge that was over the Potomac River. The next several miles were very easy because it was an old tow path that runs along the river so it’s very flat and graded real nice. The terrain was very nice today with only a few small ups and downs.  The elevation change has not been that much the last couple of days and it looks like it’s going to be relatively flat for a while, that makes me happy. I decided not to do big miles and keep each day around 20 miles so I don’t get burned out, I just want to try and enjoy these easier days rather than pushing big miles. So another big mile stone today is that once I crossed over the Potomac River I am now in Maryland, that means five states down and nine more to go.In fact in a couple of days I will be done with Maryland and into Pennsylvania. It seem like it took forever to get out of Virginia because the trail is over 500 miles  long in that state, which is the longest state.I am starting to knock off states more quickly now that they’re not as long.

Unfortunately I couldn’t go in the Washington monument or get a very good picture of it because as you can see from the picture it’s being refurbished right now. The plan is to do over 21 today to get to the county park shall miss it to can pick me up again, that is only .2 miles from the Pennsylvania line. Again the elevation change today was not bad, I did have some good ups and downs but the worst part of it was the rocks again.  I did make pretty good time today and completed my 21.5 miles x 4: 15 PM. But at the very end I was going pretty slow because my feet were really hurting from all the rocks. Especially when I came down into Pen Mar County Park it was more of a boulder scramble, And some of the time I was almost thinking it was dangerous, one slip or bad step and you fall forward and Something is going to break. So I took my time and watched each to my steps to make sure that I did not slip and fall, by doing that it slows you down and really makes the ankle sore. Better safe than sorry. They say that Pennsylvania has a lot of rocks, not looking forward to that. Well tomorrow I will crash until my seventh state, this one is about the third longest with just under 250 miles of trail in it.Just a note that the Washington Monument in the picture is the original one and was built back in the early 1800s.

Today’s plan is to do 18.6 to the Caledonia State Park where Mrs. do is going to pick me up. Today was pretty uneventful with fairly flat ground to walk on, with a few spots sending me up into the rocks that were very challenging to climb on. All in all the day went by pretty quick considering I didn’t have very many big climbs. I ended up coming out and crossing route 30 which is Lincoln Highway right before Caledonia State Park, this route 30 is the same one that is very close to my home in Indiana. This route 30 also go straight into Gettysburg.The weather’s been actually pretty nice with mostly sunny days in the low to mid 80s, today was very nice but they’re expecting thunderstorms at about 4 PM.I manage to get to the pick up location right before the rain started.

I walked about 2 miles and came up to the shelter where other hikers were just getting ready to leave. One guys name was Nagel and I started walking with him, I ended up walking with him almost all day long. I learned a Nagel just started his through hike seven days ago in Harpers Ferry and he is doing what they call a flip-flop. Flip-flop is starting somewhere other than the beginning or the end , Walk into one end and then go back and finish what they haven’t done yet to the other end. So the day went by pretty fast because Nagel had a lot of questions about through hiking since he just started his.Before I knew it it was 10:15 and we already had 9 miles in so we took a short snack break.But the mile stone for today is when we passed the halfway mark around the trail as you can see in the picture.The actual halfway point was a couple miles before this but this looks a lot fancier.  After about 15 miles I left Nagel at a shelter because he is not doing bigger miles yet since he just started and doesn’t have his trail legs. Another highlight was to get into Pine Grove furnace State Park, here it’s customary to eat a half a gallon of ice cream in one sitting to commemorate that we’ve done half the trail. I walked into the park about 3 o’clock and went right over to the general store and waited for Mrs Do to come meet me, then I got my half gallon and sat there and finished it, I don’t need ice cream for a little while.

The first 11 miles were very nice and gradual with no big ups or downs which made walking easy. Those 11 miles went very quickly because I was probably averaging over 2 1/2 miles an hour. Unfortunately after lunch it wasn’t easy anymore, I began several steep ups and downs which were not very high but unfortunately were very rocky. In fact the guidebook calls at the rock maze, the trail sent you through rocks, over rocks and around rocks.  Sometimes the hiking got a little bit tricky having to climb up and over rocks and being very careful not to slip and watch every footstep you take. The walk was not real difficult but just very slow having to take the time to watch your footing every step of the way. Finally towards the end of that It was a very nice walk through farm fields of wheat and corn which made for a very easy walking. Then I entered the town of boiling Springs by crossing over an old bridge right into town next to a pond were several fishermen were catching trout.I enjoyed standing there for a few minutes and watched them real men, they weren’t real big but they were having fun.

Again once you got on top of the mountain it was a fairly easy walk which slight up and downs but again no views.By doing these long days I know 20 miles or just slightly over is about my limit even though there’s no big climbs.  I got a slight late start because it was a long drive from the motorhome but by the time I got to where I was camping for the evening and it was almost 730.

The terrain is starting to get a little more ups and downs than They did in Pennsylvania but they’re still not too bad compared to what’s coming up in the north.So the highlight of the day was close to the end when I entered High Point State Park which as you can see in the picture has a tower on the highest point in New Jersey. The trail then turns East and follows the New York New Jersey state line staying just in New Jersey, so I won’t be entering New York for a couple more days.Thanks for reading and following.","US 206

Mountaindo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617072,"This morning Mrs. do drop me off by accident at the pick up location, this was not a problem so I decided to hike southbound. Sometimes it’s nice to walk south because then I can see which hikers are hiking in the same area as I am, Because if I’m not hiking with them they only may be 20 minutes ahead of me and I’ll never even know it. I did manage to see about five different through hikers today, several I knew and several I didn’t know. Today was a very interesting day as far as the terrain the first half of the day was very steep and Rocky with big climbs and steep descents, While the second half of the day I seem to be more walking through swamps than anything.There was one real nice section as you can see in the picture that had a beautiful boardwalk built through the swamp for approximately a half a mile. Most of the other swampy areas I walked through were in the woods and it’s like they threw a few boards down on some logs just so you didn’t get your feet wet.And there was one real nice area where I had to walk around a nature reserve which had a build up dike around it so the walking was nice and flat and easy. I saw a few swans in there and other wildlife around there , it was a very nice walk. Well I have about six more miles to do before I’m officially out of New Jersey and into New York and that will be eight states down six left to go.Thanks for reading and following.","Gemmer Road

One of the milestones about today is that I will be leaving New Jersey and entering New York that means eight states down and six more to go. My guidebook had it that today was going to be a challenging day with the rocks even though the elevation change did not seem very bad.It really didn’t seem too bad the rocks here are more like slabs then boulders, with it being dry outside that means I can walk right over the top of them and not worry about slipping and falling.I made good time today and had my 19 miles done by 3:30, so I called Mrs. do and she promptly came and picked me up with in a half hour which was great. I have about 80 miles to do in New York before I get into Connecticut, so that means I have about five days of hiking before I leave for New York.

So I put on my rain jacket, covered my pack and headed up the trail.It rained on and off for about the first two hours then by 10 o’clock I took all my rain gear off. But unfortunately I was wet all day long either from sweating under my rain gear or just sweating because I was doing a lot of climbing.Today I had planned on only doing just under 17 miles because the terrain had a lot of ups and downs. Even in the book it warned that today’s hike would be very rocky and very steep. So it was a very good thing that I only decided to do under 17 miles because the book was right, today was tough between the steep ups and downs, large boulder climbs, wet rocks And the rain I was wore out by the end of the day. I can see how they tell you when you get up into the White Mountains that your mileage will be cut in half just because of the rocks that you have to climb.I included a picture of the lemon squeezer which is iconic rock area that’s very narrow, you have to work hard to squeeze you and your pack through that narrow slot. This is a lot how today went, many times I had a put my poles away and use my hands just to pull myself up and over these rock ledges.Thanks for reading and following.","

I walked the .4 miles to the trail and started heading north. Today I plan on doing a little bit shorter day only about 14 miles because I know I have several big climbs  today including Bear Mountain.So sure enough I started the morning with a 600 foot climb up to the top of the west mountain where I did have a good view, then right back down another 600 feet to the bottom to get ready to walk up bear mountain. The climb up bear mountain was all over 700 feet and a lot of rock climbing sometimes with just your hands to pull yourself up. Once I got on top of Bear Mountain had some real nice views On different sides of the mountain and then it took you over to the tower which is in the picture above. Unfortunately you can’t go in the tower that’s locked so I started walking down Bear Mountain which included over 1000 stone steps Which takes you all the way down to the Hudson River. Lunch down at the bottom of Bear Mountain they have a real nice lake with park all around it. Then from there the trail goes into the Trailside zoo Which hikers get to go in for free because the actual AT runs through the zoo.So technically I’ve seen my ninth and 10th bears because two of them were in the bear cage, but I really won’t count those.So after I spent a little time wandering to the zoo next thing is is I had to walk the bear mountain bridge Over the Hudson river, boy is that a muddy mess. After that it was a short road walk and right back up for another steep climb over the next 5 miles which brought me down to the Appalachian deli where Mrs Do thankfully picked me up.Thanks for reading and following.","Palisades Parkway NY

But she ended up staying around the area and went to Bear Mountain and a few other places so she didn’t have to drive all the way back to the camper and then come get me again. She then went to the store and bought ice cream, brownies, Sodas Several other things and got to where she was going to pick me up by about 1 o’clock and did trail magic. More people know her because she meets more hikers and they like seeing her because she has goodies for them. Today’s hike was not too bad there weren’t as many steep ups and downs as I’ve come across in the last couple of days. I even ran across a couple hikers to day one of which I’ve met before his name is Nagel and when I had met his name is Cecil,I was able to sit and have lunch with them that was nice for a change. Then at the end of the day I had a rock climb to the top of Shenandoah mountains where the painting of the American flag for a memorial was painted on the rocks and you can see that in the picture. When I got to the road crossing where Mrs. do was, she was giving trail magic to a hiker I haven’t met yet from New Zealand and his name is  lucked in.

The forecast for today look like rain by two oclock so I was hoping I was gonna make it to the pick up spot with as little rain as possible. As it turned out it never did rain, so I’m thankful for that. Today’s to rain didn’t look too bad in the book so I figured I could do 20 miles today but I don’t think it’s going to be that easy for very long. The hike today was not bad as far as ups and downs but with the temperature being close to 90 I did a lot of sweating start very early on. I tried to keep hydrated today because I know I was sweating so much that not only my shirt put my pants were soaked today too. Fortunately in several locations trail angels leave gallon jugs of water there for the hikers to use it really makes things easier not having to find a creek and filter water. Well I made my goal of almost 20 miles today by 5 o’clock and when I reach the road there was the largest oak tree on the AT. So I had Mrs. do stand in front of it to show you how large this Tree really us.

First off when Mrs. do drop me off there was a guy taken photos of the hikers and had trail magic there. I didn’t really get anything from them because I already had something to eat on the way there and drink. But not only was there trail magic but there were five other through hikers That I had recently met over the last couple days all sitting there. Which gave me the opportunity to visit with them and start hiking with them. Usually when I start off in the morning and most of the day, I hike by myself because sometimes I don’t see anybody. But Today I started off hiking with other people and had good conversation along the way. Next, one of those hikers’ wife was doing trail magic up at the next road which was about 2 1/2 miles away. That Hiker’s name was up and over and we enjoyed a second trail magic for the morning and it wasn’t even 9 o’clock yet. Next, as you can tell by the picture I’ve completed my ninth state and have five more to go. Next, about 50 feet passed that sign more trail magic, a cooler with ice cold sodas in it. About 300 feet past the cooler was another couple doing trail magic, they had pulled pork sandwiches, fruit and Sodas there, I went there and thank them for what they were doing but told him I had to keep moving and we really appreciate what they do for us Hiker’s. Sometimes when I only do shorter days like today I feel that I need to do longer miles but sure is nice sometimes to do a few shorter days in there. So today seem to go by very quick, I was able to hike with some good company and we had lots of trail magic, like I said It was an unusual day.

Today’s plan was to do just short of 17 miles, most of the day looked very tough because of the steep ups and downs. They weren’t real high but it felt like all day either I was going up or down and rarely walking on any level ground. At the end of the day I saw papa Smurf and I said something to him about the terrain and he agreed that even though they weren’t big climbs it seems like they were very tiring climbs. We even had one section coming down from Saint Johns ledges down to the Housatonic River that was a boulder scramble and you had to be very careful coming down the steep rocky decent because if you slipped and fell something was going to break, And that would be the end of my hike.Luckily I got down OK and then after that for the next 4 1/2 miles it was a beautiful flat walk along the Housatonic River which was really enjoyable. I did get one nice view that I posted in the picture above looking into Connecticut from Indian rocks. Looking at the book for tomorrow it’s almost an exact copy of today with the short ups and downs, rocks and even a flat stretch at the end, so I’m figuring on doing about the same miles again tomorrow.

The day wasn’t a bad day though didn’t have a whole lot of use but It did go by pretty quick.So doing about 16 miles is not a big day but with the steps ups and downs by 16 or 17 miles I feel like I’m done for the day.

From there I had a 1400 foot climb to get to the top of Killington which has a side trail of a quarter-mile to the peak where there is a view and a restaurant, but again us thru hikers don’t do any extra miles so I headed right back down and it was a fairly easy afternoon all the way down to the pick up spot.

Mountaindo,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620079,"Today started off like usual with Mrs. do dropping me off and expecting  to do about 14 1/2 miles to a pick up spot.The day started off with just a small little climb and then down into Gifford Woods State Park which is a beautiful park, I took a picture of the lake that was in there and enjoy the flat walk around it. After that I had a good 1300 foot climb in approximately 1.3 miles which got the blood pumping for the morning. After that was some small ups and downs till I came down to one of the Brooks and then another fairly difficult climb Approximately 700 feet till it flattened out which only gave me a short distance to the pick up. That’s when things went a little bad, when I stepped out onto the gravel road where mrs do was supposed to pick me up I realized that gravel road was practically impassable. And with no cell service in the area at all I decided to walk down that gravel road and hopefully I could find her trying to find me.I walked approximately 6 miles down the gravel road which seem to improve as I went down but hoping Mrs. do never tried to drive up there. After approximately 4 miles I started seeing a few houses and the road was much better till I got to an intersection in the gravel road and while I was standing there trying to figure out which way to go a friendly neighbor drove down to me and was very nice to allow me to make a phone call on his landline.Just as I was getting ready to step into a house his house I saw Mrs. do driving up the road and one of the other neighbors who I had talked to while she was walking her dog recognize the car from the description I gave her and stopped her and told her she had seen me.So fortunately she stopped her and I was able to get a ride back to the motorhome, talking to Mrs. do her phone sent her up the other side of the mountain and found out that Road had been washed out years ago and was impassable.But for your purest there was no way I was going to start at that impassable road and continue tomorrow just because there was no way to get there without walking back up the 6 miles so I consider that as part of walking the AT, I know you purest would disagree but sorry so thank you for reading and following","US 4 Rutland, VT

Today’s move seem mostly like any other move that we’ve done, everything went well packing up but as we were driving within 45 minutes of reaching our new location I could hear a bad noise under the camper, so when I pulled over Mrs. Do  could even hear it in the car behind me.I check the tire pressure in one of the tires seemed a bit low so we drove to the nearest service station and aired it up but we were really concerned that that was not the problem, so in trying to find somewhere to have it checked out it seem like the noise was not nearly as loud after I air the tire up. Hoping it was something minor we continue to head to our destinations, after about another 25 minutes of traveling the tire completely blew up just missing Mrs. do drive in the car behind me. Fortunately we just got onto a major road after going through the hills on a road with no shoulders, so I pulled off to the side and began changing the tire. Fortunately I had all the tools and the jacks to change the tire which took me approximately two hours to do. So after changing the tire in 90° heat I was hot, sweaty and dirty as you could imagine from crawling underneath the Motorhome, but we reached our new campground and got everything set up. Unfortunately now Mrs. do has the job of finding a place to get a new tire to replace the blown out one. So the plan is to drop me off for a couple of days out and she will find a tire store and see about ordering a new one while I’m out.

The forecast was for rain this afternoon but I was trying to hustle to make 17 miles to hexacuba  Shelter before the rain. Just said I was beginning to climb up smarts mountains which is all 2100 foot climb it started to rain lightly. I finally reached the top of Smart’s Mountain and there was a fire warden’s cabin up there which is now a shelter so I decided to stop in because I haven’t had lunch Yet. Nobody was there so I changed out of my wet clothes into some dry clothes and sat down to have a little lunch. The rain began to get a little heavier so I decided to be smart on smarts mountain and just stay there for the night instead of trying to climb down wet rocks another 5 miles. Five other hikers eventually came there and spend the night too which gave us a pretty full house. We all laid out air mattresses on the floor since there were no bunks and stay dry while it rained most of the night.

Luckily within a half hour after I left the rain seem to stop and it was just dripping from the trees for the next couple hours. I had to take the decent slowly this morning because it was pretty steep and long and I didn’t really want to fall on the rocks, so it took me a while to get down and then when I got to the Brook at the bottom I had another 1400 foot climb in 3 miles up to the top of Mount cube. I stop for a moment on top of Mount Cube to take a photo and then it was about an 1800 foot drop down from Mt. cube to the bottom with that another 900 foot climb. Needless to say I was tired from all the climbing up and down but the good news was that today Mrs. do was picking me up to get back to the camper for a shower and a good meal, that always lifts my spirits.

Today again it’s one of those nervous days because I got to go along Franconia Ridge which is above tree line, the thing that makes me nervous is the fact that you can’t camp up there and it’s getting very difficult to find camping at the miles you want to make for the day. And I started off with a big steep climb up to liberty Springs which is at 4283 which is a 2800 foot climb,The next was little haystack mountain at 4800 then continue up to Mount Lincoln which is at 5089 and continuing up to Mount Lafayette which is at 5254 back down to Garfield pond which is at 3856 then right back up to Mount Garfield at 4453, needless to say we did a lot of climbing today. When I left this morning first thing I ran into a northbound through Hiker who name is doublecheck who I met previously weeks ago briefly on the trail. He’s much younger than I and a faster Hiker but I did manage to meet up with them when I got to the top of Little Haystack Mountain, he was taken in the views. We talked for a bit and I told him how I did not like to know where I was going to end my day, I don’t like the unknown especially when you’re hiking in the mountains. He assured me that he find stealth campsites all the time. So luckily I was able to hike the rest of the day with him and he didn’t seem to mind me tagging along. We did manage to find two spots tucked in the woods just a little bit, there was basically just enough room for 2 tents so it worked out very well and I was able to have a little company for the second half of the day. We only got in just under 11 miles but we were both very tired. The picture I put above is a view looking down Franconia Ridge which is a ridge line that goes from Mountain to Mountain which is above tree line so you can see exactly where you’re heading next.

But right before that I came across the Galehead hut which is in the picture above and it’s nice that they have fresh water there, so I filled up my water bottles and headed up to South twin Mountain. From there it wasn’t bad most of the day Was downhill to where Mrs. do would be waiting to pick me up. I reached the Zealand falls hut at about noon so I decided to check in there for lunch so I bought a bowl of soup and a couple of cookies and sat and ate my rest of my lunch there. The other thing about the whites which they seem to make it difficult for the Hiker’s is there’s not many shelters and where there are shelters they want you to pay them $10 to stay there because they have a caretaker there. Another difficult thing for me is to tell Mrs. do what time to pick me up because it’s very hard to gauge how hard the trail is, but that’s a great trade off to be able to get back to see her and get a shower and a good meal.  So I had told her to pick me up about 6 PM knowing that I had a Lot of rugged terrain and I was doing just under 17 miles, I managed to reach the parking at about four but Unfortunately I had no cell service there or anywhere else to give her a call.

I had a big climb that morning but I ended up getting to the campsite at about 1230 where they have a caretaker who would sign you in. When I got there he was not there so I sat around outside Mizpah Spring Hut Which is next to the campsite for about 45 minutes waiting for him to show up. While I was sitting there several other hikers came there to refill their water bottles and I asked them where they were going for the night and all of them responded they were going to Lakes of the clouds hut which was another 4.7 miles. So I decided to throw caution to the wind and headed up for another big climb towards Mount Washington. Lakes of the cloud hut sits about 1.5 miles at the base of Mount Washington which is what I want to summit tomorrow. I reached a hut around 430 and asked right away if I could do work for stay here tonight, they took my name down and said I was the first one there to ask. Each hut only takes so many work for stays and this one will take six people, but if you’re after that they won’t turn you away but for $10 you could sleep on the floor. So the woman in charge explain that we would be doing minor chores at about 830 after all the paying customers have been fed. After they left, us and the ‘croo’ got to eat as much of the leftovers as we wanted and then our chores were handed out which included scrubbing pans, washing some dishes And sweeping the floor. So we got our chores done and figured out where we were going to sleep on the dining room floor when the woman in charge said lights out at 9:30 all but one light was turned off and all the paying customers were in their rooms.

We were anticipating the big climb up to Mount Washington which is about 1.5 miles straight up a very rocky slope. We all hope that it’s going to be a clear day but they have very few clear days on top of Mount Washington. Mount Washington has the worst weather in the world with the highest recorded wind speed up to a year ago at 231 miles an hour. It was supposed to be a clear day and I could see the top of the mountain when I left the hut and as I climbed I could see the fog is starting to cover the top. But yet all around the mountain there were no clouds. The mountain is situated that it creates its own weather. But as the good Lord had it 10 minutes before I reach the top all the fog blew away and I was able to get some nice pictures and five minutes after I left I was covered in fog again. There would’ve been so many nice pictures today to post but I only posted the one of me standing at the summit sign.  The original plan with Mrs. do was for me to spend three days doing this section of the whites but since I went approximately 11 miles yesterday that only made 15 miles to get down to where she could pick me up, so talking with some of the other hikers they were doing the exact same thing so I decided to push all the way down even though I had to go over several other ridges including Mount Clay, Mount Jefferson,Mount Madison and then quite along decent to get to the bottom. Today’s walk was brutally hard because when you’re above tree line all that there is rocks and more rocks and boulders and more rocks. By the time I reach the bottom, even though it was only 15 miles, my ankles feet and knees all need a break make that a rest. I was very happy to be able to do that in two days rather than three days and I got over Mount Washington which was one of my biggest fears of the whites. That still leaves me about 38 miles left in the white mountains which includes the Wildcats.

Besides, the last 267 miles will still be there if I decide I want to complete it someday.If you have seen the movie Forrest Gump, you may remember a scene where Tom Hanks is running from coast to coast at some point he just stops and says to him self I think I’ll go home now, that’s just the way I feel.I hope nobody will be disappointed because I am not, and I want to thank everybody who supported me in anyway through this journey I really want to give you a big thank you. And of course my biggest supporter my wife Lis who has gone way out of her way to make this happen, thanks honey I don’t think I would’ve made it this far without you. Thank you for reading and following.","Speck Pond shelter
