I'll be starting in the south and heading north. I have no fixed itinerary and no expectations.  Joani, my beloved pardner, is going to support me along the way.  I heard a rumor back in 2015 that some segment of the American public actually bets on AT hikers posting on social media like this one....who will succeed, who will fail.  Could this be true? It sounds absurd, so indeed it must be true. Or absurd; take your pick.  I only know that once I step out onto the gravel and roots, my true friends and my ever-faithful family will be with me wherever this little adventure leads.",,View Entry,"Jan 23, Wed",0
Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606568,"There are lots of articles, books, opinions and advice about how I should be preparing for a long-distance hike on the AT this spring.  Fortunately, I live in a paradise of mountains and hiking trails and scenic beauty.  It makes for some pretty awesome training days.  One of the great allures of the AT, for me anyway, is that every day is a new place, an unexplored trail.  On the AT I don't have to turn around, or circle back to the car. I can keep looking around every bend, expecting surprise.",,View Entry,"Jan 23, Wed",0

We have been there together many years ago. I still wonder why they don't just start the AT at the base of the falls in the park. But it matters not, the trail designation is just a matter of convention. It occurs to me that the AT is a long, long walk, no matter where the starting line is drawn in the path under our feet. I hope to enjoy tomorrow and days to come. I'll miss my beautiful wife, all my friends and family. But the beauty of the woods and streams and mountain paths will keep me company until I return home.",,Amicalola Falls Lodge,"Mar 06, Wed",0
Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608055,"After bidding my wife farewell, I have started my hike up the approach trail towards Springer Mtn and the official starting point of the AT. It was a cold morning, and there lots of frozen tracks of hikers in the path. Even the mole tunnels crossing the trail were frozen and I started to wonder if the little diggers worked overnight through the frozen ground, or did their work before the freeze. I can picture the little rodents working away just under the frozen mud, with tiny hammer and chisel. The bigger mystery is why they feel compelled to go from one side of the trail to the other. I made it to Springer with no problem, and the morning was quiet. Started to see a lot more hikers at Springer. When I got to Stover Creek Shelter, there was a good crowd of fellow AT hikers, some tenting and others in the shelter. I snagged a spot in the shelter and enjoyed some good fellowship with a lot of new hikers. Rumors of rain tomorrow, but rain is the norm. It's coming on Spring, and I have to remember that I will be hiking through the Southern Appalachians, a true temperate rainforest.","Amicalola Falls Lodge

I spent the day mostly walking head down into the rain. Because of the weather I was really hoping there would be ""room at the inn"" at Gooch shelter. When I arrived, there was one last spot, everyone following had to scramble for available tent sites and try to set up in the weather. An ATC trail runner was there, trying his best to direct traffic. It was a crowded, hectic night of drying off gear, cooking and organizing under the porch of the shelter. The crowded conditions made for a fitful night but I was grateful to be dry and squared away in one of the AT's many and convenient lean-to shelters","Stover Creek Shelter

It's hard to focus on the beauty of the woods with these conditions but occasionally the foggy mist through the trees adds some mystery to the dark woods. I arrived at Woods Hole shelter and we had plenty of room with only 5 humans and a dog. Zaffer is the faithful companion of two of my trailmates from Maine. Zaffer is a good dog. But he snores. And since he was bunked next to me, I kept feeling his extended front paw rhythmically tapping my shoulder through the night. Every now and then I had to grab his paw and move it away. So, a new experience sharing my trail bed with a dog. His owners were apologetic and Zaffer is such a good dog, all is forgiven. He wasn't the only cause of a fitful night...it continued to rain and howl all night. But by morning the clouds were breaking and the shelter site revealed itself as a scenic open ridgetop. Light fog rolled through before the sun broke free in the east.","Gooch Mtn shelter

Beautiful woods, some nice views and my first maildrop resupply awaiting at Mountain Crossings Hiker Hostel. This great old stone structure was built by the CCC back in the '30s and has that unmistakable look of the great stone work done by the Civilian Conservation Corps. Now a hiker store and small but cozy hostel. My bunk included a towel for a welcome hot shower. After cleaning up and cooking up my evening meal, I went out on the large stone work deck and watched the sun go down behind the mountains. The bonus was meeting up for the second time with trail magic brought to us hikers by the good folks of the Georgia Mountain Resort and Christian Retreat. I know that's not exactly the name, but they were affiliated with a church in Raleigh, NC. They grilled me up a special order of veggie burgers (thanks David!).","Woods Hole Shelter

But after hiking through some very poor looking woods (lots of blowdowns, broken trees and eroded ground) I arrived at the shelter location to find a muddy, unappealing mess. To stay on track for my next maildrop I decided to push on to the next shelter location at Blue Mountain. I'm glad I did, the woods became healthy again, and the last 7 miles was mostly easy hiking along an old logging road. Daylight was waning, and energy was sapped, so I stopped short of the shelter at the testing site. It was a scramble to get my little shelter set up before dark. All the level tent sites were taken so I had to make do with a bit of a slope. Being so tired, it didn't matter and I slept well. Once again, I awoke to a beautiful sunrise.","Mountain Cossings Hiker Hostel

Even two steep, rocky climbs felt easier underfeet with cool temperatures and clear skies. I reached a flat ridgetop on the back side of Tray Mtn and was thrilled to see a nice shelter with only one other hiker to share it with. Solitude on the AT at the start of the northbounder season is hard to come by, so the quiet of the shelter area was welcome.

Checking in felt a little like my first day of summer camp, but the staff is enthusiastic and very helpful. I get the rules and procedures.

""In a couple of miles there's a sign at the GA/NC border."" ""That shelter has to be right around the next bend.""  On this day, a morning of light drizzle left over from the previous night's rainstorms kept promising to end, only to start up again.  Still, the woods held an eerie fog and only the noise of raindrops on my pack umbrella was heard.  By mid-day, conditions gradually improved and traces of sunlight made it to the ground.  After getting to the NC line on the trail, a blue-headed vireo welcomed my entry.  Seems like the forest birds hunker down in bad weather just like we do.  As the sun continued to warm the air, I heard nuthatches, titmice, chickadees and a pileated woodpecker sing songs of relief.  Arriving at Muskrat Creek Shelter was a welcome end to a black/white day.  Made more enjoyable by the two new hiking mates who shared the shelter with me.  Do the NC woods feel any different than those I left behind in Georgia?  Well, yes they do.","Top of Georgia Hiking Center

Carrying extra gear and clothing for the cold adds about 3 pounds to my pack weight.  But it's better for me to carry the load than suffer through the night shivering in my sleeping bag.  So, it was cold but I was able to sleep pretty comfortably through the night.  But even in the shelters, if the cold air is pushed along by 15-20 mph winds, there is no protection.  So for about 3 nights it got a little ""chilly"" by about 4am.  What to do?  Put on every piece of clothing you carried, zip the sleeping bag up to your nose, and hope like hell your bladder holds out.","Muskrat Creek Shelter

Today I had a chance to check out the first along my path, Albert Mountain.  It is a real pleasure to know that a dedicated bunch of people are concerned about preserving and restoring the remaining fire towers in our mountain region.  Their work is evident as towers like Albert have been fixed up, made safe for visiting, and showcased for the public.  There's a lot of history associated with each tower, from the challenges of their construction to the rugged mountain folks who stood watch in them.  No longer needed for forest fire management, they still remind us of how vast and remote the southern Appalachian forest remains to this day.","Carter Gap Shelter

Making a northbound trek on the AT in March is not an exercise in solitude.  It's a social experiment.  Only the forest and the streams themselves force solitude onto the scene.  Walking along the path each day is your only real moment of zen.  Having said that, nothing felt finer than seeing my wonderful wife pull up in the car to whisk me back to civilization for the night.","Long Branch Shelter

The poor site was made easier by the good company.  Three of the folks from the previous night were there and we all shared the cooking area and chatted.  The Alabama Boys (section hikers) and a young lady through-hiker who was quite an expert on the harvest of wild mushrooms for food made for an interesting close of the day.  More hikers piled in late and scrambled nearby for non-existent level ground.  Watching others thrash around trying to hang their food bags up in trees to keep bears from pillaging made me thankful for my bear canister.  It's heavy but damned convenient to put all my food in one container, carry it into the woods a ways and drop it on the ground.  And it made a great seat while I cooked and ate my evening meal.  Worth the extra 2lbs.","Wine Spring Tenting Area

Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608606,"Walking up and over Wesser Bald and along the spine of the Nantahala Range towards the Smokies, one can sense the gradual changes in the landscape.  The ridgeline north of Wesser was exposed, rocky and dry.  Previous fires along the ridgetop have opened up a lot more views on either side of the narrow path.  I don't know if this was a prescribed fire or a natural one, but the good effect on regeneration of pines was evident everywhere.  Small pine seedlings (perhaps Table Mountain Pines) were here and there.  Their cones need a hot fire to explode the seeds and regenerate their kind. I like to think they are Table Mountain Pines even though I'm not sure they grow this far south and west. They are a endemic to my home area of the southern Appalachians and I like rare things.  After descending steep steps down off the narrow ridgeline, the AT takes a long, meandering downhill glide to Wesser, NC.  The reward of another reunion with Joani and a zero day in Bryson City was highlighted by hundreds of small, white Hepatica flowers growing along the switchbacks of the trail near the bottom.  These are truly among the early harbingers of spring and renewal.  We enjoyed a bowl of hot chili and a beer at Nantahala Outdoor Center, then a great meal in Bryson City after a visit to Nantahala Brewing's Taproom. The promise is of another zero day tomorrow to rest and regroup.","Big Branch Tenting Area

There is lots of history here, predating the creation of the park.  Horace Kephart's book, ""Our Southern Highlanders"" paints a realistic portrait of the early pioneers in this rugged foothill region of the Smokies.  To the east is the Qualla Reservation of the Cherokee.

On arrival we saw Mr. President, a nice reunion. I was anxious to get moving again, and was crossing the bridge over the river and bidding Joani a farewell by 9:15am. It was a cold morning but sunny with the promise of a warm, clear day. I was not disappointed. The climb out of the north side of the gorge is steady, almost relentless. But it was not too steep. By midday I found myself at Cheoah Bald, a beautiful, open grassy slope looking southward. From there it is mostly a descending trail to the night's destination at Locust Grove. Not a large tenting area as things go, but I found a quiet, level spot, and good water was nearby. Tenting was more enjoyable that night with the milder temperatures.

There is a convenient little picnic table there for a break, but the paved highway was strangely quiet. Beyond Stecoah the trail heads sharply up again out of the gap. This a familiar characteristic of the trail. Climb to ridges, then descend to ""gaps"", then climb steeply out again. Beyond Stecoah is a named climb...""Jacob's Ladder"". There are no rungs or steel handholds, just a series of short, steep switchbacks as you make your way up and over a prominent conical peak.

More gradual signs of change in the woods were evident. I Flushed a panicky grouse up from right off the edge of the trail. Blue-headed vireos were singing all morning long. And as I descended the mountain to Fontana Lake, suddenly the ground was covered with trilliums just starting to open their maroon buds. Silver bell trees became noticeable for the first time.

These and the general foggy cloud made for a wet day.  Reaching my destination for the night at Russell Fields Shelter, I found no room in the inn, so I set up my tent.  The wind was howling through the gap and it promised to be a very cold night.  Fortunately the wind died down, the moon rose late in the night, and I awoke fairly well rested.","Fontana Dam

Today was no exception.  The sky was clear and the wind was blowing strongly out of the southwest...signs of a warm day in the mountains.  I reached the famous spot called Charlie's Bunion and enjoyed the sun, the red squirrels, and some memories of previous visits here.  The trail leading eastward from the bunion was narrow and open with views on either side of the ""sawtooth"" ridgeline.  Continuing to hike through northern conifer forest, this part of the park feels like it was dropped into the southeastern United States in some geological mishap, which it kinda was.","NewFound Gap

The AT was a mix of mud and ice, with lots of rocks and roots added to the mix.  I have learned from past visits to the park in April that this kind of weather is not unusual, and I was glad to still be carrying the 3-4 pounds of extra gear for cold weather hiking.  I used every bit of it.","Peck's Corner Shelter

I helped out my feet by placing two handwarmer packets at the bottom of the liner. I pulled a knit balaclava all the way down over my face and neck and tightened up my mummy sleeping bag around my nose. It worked and I slept pretty well, until I had to go to the bathroom. Twice.  But even this has a silver lining.  Getting back into my cocoon takes about 5 minutes but I can re-adjust everything that has inevitably shifted.  And the midnight comfort break lets me scan the sky, sometimes revealing a spectacular star show.","Cosby Knob Shelter

Still, the rumors were of a warm-up and before long I was shedding layers of clothing.  My intention was to hike about 9-10 miles and find a tenting spot.  When you are hiking along the trail, it seems there are little level spots everywhere inviting one to plop your tent down for the night.  When you are actually looking for one of these spots, ideally with level ground and water nearby, they are nowhere to be seen.  Hearing the first songs of the black-throated green warblers of the season didn't help my mood as I trudged along.  The long, dry ridge leading towards Deer Park Mountain made the day seem longer, and the lack of water more concerning.  My right foot developed some sore spots, which I've had before but were nonetheless aggravating.  Finally I arrived at the little gap and to the right a path led .2 miles to the shelter.  To the left is the path for the water.  I needed water so I walked down to the stream, and realized along the way that there were a whole series of clearings and level spots where folks had camped and tented.  A group of hikers were set up in several tents by the stream.  I watered up, and decided on the way back up to the junction that there had to be a perfect tenting spot for me somewhere.  I found it and spent the quietest, most comfortable night on the trail in my cozy shelter.  Never saw Deer Park Shelter.  I packed up the next morning, ate a hearty breakfast and moved on towards Hot Springs and my welcome meet-up with Joani.  My mood swing was complete.","Roaring Fork Shelter

Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609596,"Hiking down the ridge of Deer Park Mtn towards Hot Springs puts a spring in your step on a warm, sunny morning.  In fact, I went from the hardest day of hiking to the easy-peasiest just like that.  One has many personal and physical milestones along the trail.  Some are in your head, others are on the ground.  Many aren't really that significant to anyone but yourself.  Today my milestone was to be able to zip off the pant legs on my hiking pants for the first time and enjoy the warm air on my scrawny little calves.  WooHoo!  I also made my first wrong turn.  I jokingly tell folks that you have to literally be sleep-walking to get lost on the AT, it is that well marked.  So I did make a wrong turn, not in the wilds of the southern Appalachians, but entering town with its street signs and paved roads.  After walking about 5 minutes down a paved sidewalk, I got the uncomfortable feeling I was not getting any closer to the little downtown of Hot Springs. A quick look at the map showed that I had zigged when I should have zagged.  Reversed course and was soon on Main Street.  A welcome and familiar little place to Joani and me.  I sat on a bench in the sun and awaited her arrival.  We will enjoy another break from the trail together, in the lap of luxury at the Iron Horse Station Inn.  Love this place!  Went across the street to the Spring Creek Restaurant for a lunch on the covered deck overlooking the stream, and watched NC DNR staff stocking the stream with this year's crop of trout.  I had three delicious beers from one of my favorite regional breweries, Innovation Brewing, went back to our room at the inn, and fell fast asleep for an hour or so.  Simple pleasures for a simple fool.","Deer Park Shelter and Tenting Area

Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610040,"Leaving Hot Springs after a relaxing day with Joani gave me my first taste of loneliness on the trail. Just like the hiking....climbing one hill, then descending to a low gap, then repeating....emotions while I hike are following a similar pattern at this stage. It can be exhilarating one day, a bit depressing the next. Today was a down day. But it bounced back when I reached Rich Mtn Fire tower and enjoyed the bracing air and clear skies. We were actually here in January to take part in a ribbon-cutting ceremony for this fully restored tower. New wood, new roof, all spiffed up thanks to several organizations and the US Forest Service. These old watchtowers are being saved from demolition and restored as viewing platforms all over the U.S. My down day ended up...when I found a perfect tenting site near the shelter, complete with a ready-made pile of dried, cut wood. Me and a couple of my hiking compadres enjoyed a warm campfire way past our normal bedtime of 8pm! As I brushed my teeth and glanced up at the sky, I found the Big Dipper, and then the north star. The way ahead was marked.","Hot Springs, NC

Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610041,"Hiked a long way today to find a decent tenting spot that would offer some protection from thunderstorms rumored to be moving in tonight. The weather rumor mill on the trail is as active and wildly inconsistent. But like all those computer models projecting hurricane paths, when enough rumors align, It's time to take cover. I found a spot near water down in a protected cove near Jones Meadow. And lo and behold...after finishing my evening meal, washing up and crawling into my tent, it started to rain. Then it thundered and rumbled, but always in the distance. Were it not for some troublesome minor water leaks at the corners of my tent, it would have been a fairly peaceful night. Still and all, I stayed dry and my gear was stowed neatly inside with me. I heard a lone coyote howl and bark about 4:30am. It sounded relieved also that the worst was over. Some light drizzles the next morning but it stopped long enough to break camp and hike on.","Spring Mountain Shelter

Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610042,"The trail can become a muddy mess after a rain, and this morning was true to form. Still, the walking was pretty easy grade, and up on a high ridgeline near Fire scald Mtn, there were some nice views. By 11:30 in the morning I arrived at a scenic shelter site called Jerry Cabin. A few hikers had already claimed their spots and talked bout the imminent return of heavy rain this afternoon. I wanted to even out my miles getting to the next hostel, so I hiked on. As soon as I started moving, doubts crept in. Even a couple of fearless young AT hiker dudes had opted to settle in. Fortunately I made it to Flint Mountain shelter with just a passing shower or two. It was a good day to break out the backpacking umbrella and glide to my next home. One always has to worry about crowding at the shelters when the weather turns bad. So I felt fortunate to arrive there and find plenty of room. Met some new fellow hikers and enjoyed trail conversation as the rain began to fall in earnest. Slept great and the sound of rain pelting the metal roof all night drowned out the muffled snoring and rustling around in sleeping bags and on squeaky vinyl pads.","Jones Meadow

Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610044,"well it was still raining in the morning, but it didn't seem sincere. A last effort to make us unhappy. So I took my time waking up and tucking away all my sleeping paraphernalia. It did start to let up enough to make coffee and oatmeal, repack...and start up the trail again. When a hot shower or laundry awaits you at the end of the day, it puts a little spring in your step. Today's hike was mostly uphill but not too steep. And the trail followed a natural ridgeline that mostly followed the NC/TN border. Beautiful carpets of spring beauty and other wildflowers kept me entertained most of the day. By noon the sky was blue and the lingering hint of rain passed. Hogback Ridge seemed interminable at the end of the day because I so wanted that shower. Eventually I heard the roar of the big trucks on I-26 struggling up and down the steep mountain grade. I got picked up by Sarah from the Hostel, and soon enough had a full belly, clean feet, laundered socks, and a new positive attitude. My goal is now set. I will set out tomorrow for Erwin, TN, then onto Roan Mountain where I expect to wrap up this little adventure.","Flint Mountain Shelter

Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610055,"Even though I got to bed last night at the very late hour of 11pm, I was able to update this journal and now this morning I am up early and ready to go. I ate a lot of heavy, fatty food last night and I'm hoping this morning the hostel owners will be making their famous biscuits and gravy. I feel fine, but I have lost some weight and figure I need to stray a bit from our plant-based diet to make up some calorie loss. The hostels usually have a good supply of rich food, and Nature's Inn is no exception. The kitchen and common area has all the comforts of home, so I'll take advantage of it while I can. I slept in one of their cozy little creekside cabins. The rushing sound of the water put me right to sleep. The stars are out in force and it looks like we will have a couple good weather days. I am now hiking in the Unaka Mountains, working my way towards Roan Mountain. I have left the Snowbirds, the Smokies, the Nantahala, and the Georgia Blue Ridge mountains behind. The Southern Appalachians are a complex of geology and forests that seems endless. This turned out to be one of my best days on the trail yet, with warm weather, clear skies and some beautiful hiking over Big Bald, through open northern hardwood forests carpeted with spring beauties, and fairly easy grades. The tenting site was pleasant and I spent the evening with 5-6 fellow hikers. A couple of barred owls scolded us for staying up late around the fire, and I called it a night.","Nature's Inn Hostel at Sam's Gap

Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610197,"Another good weather day provided an opportunity to gain a day on my hiking schedule and get to Uncle Johnny's hostel near Erwin, TN. This morning's hike out of Whistling Gap meandered along the cove slopes and since I got an early start it was the first time I noticed a real spring chorus of birdsong. The sun shining at a low angle through the gaps, the warm breeze, it all added up to make a long hiking day a pleasant one. Coming down the mountain and seeing the Nolichucky River flowing briskly along lightened the steps at the end of my day. At the hostel, I was informed the shuttle into town was at 5pm. Got a good hot shower, clean clothes and piled into the van with 10 other hikers. I ate with some trailmates at the local Mexican restaurant. It's almost 10pm as I tap out this hurried entry. Way past AT hiker bedtime. It has been a bitter sweet stop here. So many other hikers are feeling like they are getting the hang of it and talk of getting to Katahdin is common. These are the hikers who survived the first, hard month. I am not looking forward though, and my section hike has to end soon. I already feel left behind. But it's been the most challenging, and hardest thing I've done, and I am happy to have gotten this far.","Whistling Gap

Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610225,"My short life in the forests of the Southern Appalachians must come to an end today. I have learned a lot about myself and especially about others. My fellow hikers have been a fun, supportive, unique cross-section of humanity. You cannot pigeonhole anyone on the trail. We all have our foibles and quirks. Most of us snore. Most of us wrestle with our doubts every day. We spend a lot of time trying to understand why we strap 30lbs on our backs, hike up and down mountains every day, covering 10-15 miles a day or so. I worked that out for myself one day while struggling along. I realized that the long days of hiking and solitude jump-started my brain. I am flooded with thoughts and memories too numerous to organize but welcome nonetheless. Childhood memories, small events previously buried in a tiny cluster of synapses. Songs, books, people I've liked and disliked. Scenes of nature, restaurants. Loved ones, always the Loved ones. My beautiful wife who supports me in everything.

Mark,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610319,"I temporarily conclude my section hike.  One of my given trail names that I never really adopted was LASHER.  A trail angel said it stood for a long-ass section hiker.  That's me I guess.  So my LASH has concluded for now.  I have some home and part-time work responsibilities to tend to.  I also have to put a little meat back on my bones, at least that's the judgement of certain loved ones.  In one of my entries I wanted to talk about the trail, and the people who use it.  In homage to Woodie Guthrie I say, ""This trail was made for you and me.""  Even starting out at Springer Mountain, GA in the spring the AT is not the exclusive property of northbound through-hikers.  Unfortunately, some adopt that attitude.  But I met day-hikers, boy scouts, families with little toddlers. Trail runners, dog-walkers and slack-packers. Section hikers, weekenders, novices and grizzled experts keeping their toes in the water.  The Appalachian Trail was conceived and built for anyone who wanted to experience some solitude or exercise in the woods.  To listen to birds or look for wildflowers.  Most of the fellow hikers I have journeyed with this past month were indeed through-hikers.  The talk more and more was of reaching Maine, accomplishing that specific goal. But the trail offers so much more to so many people. It is a special place to re-create.As a prologue, I am still contemplating a return to the trail for another section hike. I may still meet up with a few of the good people I've met out there.  It would be impossible to catch up to those on their northbound trek to Maine.  But perhaps I will meet them by walking the opposite direction?

Roan Mountain, Little Hump, Mt. Rogers, Grayson Highlands and those wacky wild ponies.  I've seen many of these places before but they always look and feel different when taken day-by-day from the vantage point of a long, winding path through the mountains.  It is a completely different perspective; immersive, and more personal.",,View Entry,"May 04, Sat",0

But looking back on my first two days back on the trail, it feels good to have everything go right. The forest has changed completely. From gray and leafless to the many shades of spring green. The Unaka and Iron Mountains are rich cove hardwoods so the forest floor was carpeted in shades of white, purple, yellow and blue wildflowers. Too many to list. There is a place along the trail called Beauty Spot, a perfect name for another of the southern Appalachians grassy balds, with views in every direction. At the top of the bald sat Rob, master of all he surveyed in his rocking lounge chair. He drove to the parking area for the bald and made the short walk up.
