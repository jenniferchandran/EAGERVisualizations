d20,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596575,"I've been writing some posts about my thoughts on gear, equipment, etc.  In addition, I thought I'd write about my own personal gear list.
Big Three
Tent, sleeping bag, back pack.
Osprey Exos 58 (with brain removed) 38 ounces.Big Agnes Copper Spur UL2 with tent pegs, etc. 48 ounces.Sleeping Bag: Feathered Friends.  28 ounces.  Zips together with my wife's bag.  Slightly custom (it is a men's short).Thermarest Neoair (with bag pump/bag pump nozzle). 12 ounces.Trekology inflatable pillow (the second one I've bought, my wife swiped the first one ;) ).  Three ounces.
Total is 129 ounces or 8 pounds.
Clothing:
Rain
Rain jacket:  Outdoor Research Helium Hybrid.  8.5 ounces.  Functions as a wind shirt as well as a rain jacket.ULA Rain skirt: 3 ouncesGaiters: 5 ouncesOsprey Pack Cover: 3.5 ounces (my wife kept an Osprey cover for her pack even after she traded the Osprey in for a different brand.  Price/Weight/Quality are a good mix)
20 ounces.
Base Layer (for sleeping -- either a base layer or a sleeping bag liner is really needed).  It is important to have dry clothing to switch into to sleep at night. In the morning I put whatever I was wearing the day before back on so that I'll have dry clothes again the next night. Since I am switching to dry clothes, I also use them for a sleeping baselayer
UnderwearREI Quarterzip Merino Wool: Dark Blue Patagonia Mid-Weight Capilene Bottoms:  BlackFor summer use I have Tek microfiber/spandex in white.  It was very cheap (about nine dollars total for top and bottom)
Usually I would go Merino Wool for clothing layers and I tend to shop what is cheapest.  I got very good deals on all of these and Capilene is neat stuff. 
Hiking Clothes
Underwear Warm weather top is a WoolX Lightweight long sleeve t-shirt (I'm wearing it in the picture for this entry).  It was a great deal at the time.  Works in hard sunlight to prevent sunburn, disperses sweat and helps cool me off.  I have used Under Armor and similar things.  Some have treatments to help them avoid picking up the stench that many artificial fibers pick up when used for a long time.I also have a white/ivory buff by Buff that matches the lightweight top. (Also in the picture).Cold weather top is Minus 33 Degree Heavyweight merino wool long sleeve t-shirt. The reason for the different brands has to do with what was at the low price point at the right time.  Watch out to make sure that you are getting 100% merino wool (sometimes the low price options aren't actually 100% merino wool).  Checking the prices when you buy is important.REI convertible pants. Relaxed fit, Nylon/Spandex.  REI pants have gone through a number of redesigns.  I bought these for about twenty dollars from a guy who sells remainders. Black Diamond Fleece Hoody.  Fleeces all insulate about the same for about the same weight. We had a factory outlet store with great prices near-by once.  This one is 20 ounces. It was designed for lasting a long time over warmth.Socks.  I have both Smart Wool and Darn Toughs.  Depends which shoes I'm wearing, which ones fit the best (which was a surprise to me).  I'm still working it out.Sleep socks.  I sleep in the Costco hiking socks.  They are surprisingly good socks.  
I don't carry all of this at the same time.  For cold weather, one set.  For warm weather, another set.
Puffy
I have an REI down puffy I got on sale.  11.0 ounces.  Dark blue.I also have a Patagonia down alternative (nano-puff) I got on sale (discontinued color.).  The two of these together came to under a hundred dollars (about fifty or less each). 12.5 ounces.  Warms while wet.  Bright Green.
I only carry one or the other.  I like them both and have traveled all over with both (though not at the same time).  When you've stopped for the night and it starts to chill down, it is time to put one on to keep warm.  I've been tempted to use the Patagonia Nano in place of the hoodie and just carry a down hood (I have one I picked up to go with my quilt [which is now redundant given the switch to a sleeping bag]).  That would be warmer and lighter.
Camp shoes
I have some croc-like shoes.  7.5 ounces or so.  Croc clones are a mixed bag.  Some are really heavy.  Some are really light.  Some are worthless to walk in.  These I walked in for ten miles or so around town, getting resupplied and catching lunch and my feet felt great.  It helps to get out of your shoes and let them dry and breathe at the end of the day.
I'll discuss gear more, but this is my basic gear list. (I'm backpacking with my wife who carries other gear).Other gear includes things like a trowel, hiking poles, my hat.",,View Entry,"Jul 03, Tue",0
d20,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596186,"I've been through a number of tents in my life, from when I was in the boy scouts in the 1960s with canvas to more modern tents and car camping.  Have also used different tents while section hiking.
This is the advice I recently gave someone who was looking for a tent for a couple to use to through hike the AT next year. They are 5'8"" and 5'10"". They wanted to just buy one tent, not get on the treadmill of buying tent after tent until they got it right.  Note that I'm 5'5"" and my wife is 5'8"" (I was 5'6"" and she was 5'7"" when we got married).
Below is my advice....I’d suggest that you schedule a trip to an REI. REI will let you set up tents and take some time in store to look at them. Set up two or three side by side and lay down in them. My wife and I have done that. Set up tents, crawled in and out of them, compared them side by side, and taken some real time.
[I really found this helpful after I had used a few tents and been out camping with modern tents.  Once we had a feel for what it had been in a tent for several trips on the trail, compared to car camping, it really helped to then compare the tents we were looking at using to replace our tent with for use on the trail.]So you set up 2-3 tents in the store and check them out, then take down one or two and set up some more (that way you always have a tent set up from the group before to keep a baseline going). 
[Note that every REI I've been in has had a couple-three tents set up anyway.  The neat thing is that they really will let you set up and look at tents in store and you can compare all sorts of tents in a way you never could otherwise.]
After you have checked out the tents, rent/borrow/buy used a tent and do a short trip with it. Go to REI garage sales and see what people are returning (that is how they get everything they sell -- returns) -- often people who returned something are at the garage sale and will talk about why they returned what they returned.
[For example, at our local REI the most common returned tent for sale is a Big Agnes Fly Creek 1p tent.  I once was in a check-out line directly behind a guy who had returned one and the girl right in front of him was buying it.  The tent was perfect for both of them.  He was just too large for it to work for him.  She was petite and was comfortable with small tents and ones that are not free standing.]
[Another thing that people will talk about is freestanding and non-freestanding tents.  For some people whether or not a tent is freestanding -- whether it needs to be set up with tent pegs and guy lines and such -- is important.  For some it really doesn't matter.  Most tents need a little tying out, some need a lot.  Some can make do with very little.  At the end of the day it sometimes makes a difference in setting up.  How much work, what kind of soil you have to deal with, lots of things.  A lot of that depends on the person.]
By experimenting like this (setting up and laying down in tents in store and taking tents on short week or so section hikes) my wife and I realized we like freestanding tents more than not. We got to a definite preference for side entry over front entry. (I confess that at the end what I really wanted was a two pound half dome  At five pounds it is just too heavy. But it works for car camping). We tried 3p and 2p tents. Tried vestibule(s) for gear storage and tried storage in the tent. We checked out how much condensation we had issues with. (some people create more condensation than others, some have stronger feelings about condensation in a tent than other people do. Find out where you fit).
[Side entry make sit easier to get in and out of a tent.  Some people don't care.  Front entry in a tent means you climb in and out of the same entrance, and kind of in and out over each other if it is a shared tent.  We didn't climb over each other really in the front entry tents we tried, some people get really annoyed by each other.  But it is easier to get in and out and to keep gear accessible and not in the way.  Climbing in and out over our gear in the vestibule was more of a hassle in a front entry tent than climbing in and out over each other.]
[We found that some tents ventilate a lot better than others.  Condensation really annoyed my wife.  Others are good with wiping down the inside of their tent every morning.  I have to agree my wife was right.]
That said, almost everyone [most of the manufacturers had some significant updates in 2017-2018] updated their tents this year or last year, so everything is current. You have plenty of time to check sales. [A good number of last year's models were close to this year's model or almost exactly the same.  Price really dropped for those that were updated.] Options I’d suggest:
[Ok, something I should have brought up.  Many people hike with a 2p -- two person -- tent for one person.  3p for two people.  Others find a 2p tent works just fine for two and are fine with a 1 person tent for one person.  What works for you really is a matter of personal choice and comfort.  As I mentioned, 1p Fly Creeks get returned a lot to REI -- at the same time they are really popular on the Appalachian Trail.  One of the most popular tents with a lot of satisfied users.
That is why it is important to figure out how size and fit works with your style and comfort.]
[Back to options I would suggest looking at]
Tiger Wall 2p or 3p. REI exclusive now [the exclusive will end eventually], but lots of sales. REI currently offers 20% off and the REI coop refund too.  [It is very light, semi-free standing, and has dual side entries.]Mountain Hardwear Ghost 3p. (I sold mine, it actually ventilates too well for me, front entry, but it is a great tent to look at).From Big Agnes, the two backpacking standards: Copper Spur and Fly Creek. (Disclosure, we bought a CS 2p to use instead of the ghost).Naturehike and Lanshan—especially since they are cheap and you can buy one to play with and experiment. You can get them on ebay and check them out on YouTube -- lots of reviews.The Tarptent double rainbow. Free standing using a hiker pole. Depends how how much moisture you breath out whether it works for you, but it is a really solid tent (as are the other tarptents).The various Nemos. Note that the Fly Creek and Nemo’s are not free standing. Lanshan is not freestanding.My Trail Company. https://mytrailco.com/collections/te...nt=20147804867
But those are the core choices to look at. All of those tents go on sale -- sometimes dramatically on sale. Almost all have a 2p and a 3p version, and the 3p version isn't that much heavier (For example: My Trail Company's 3p is 2lbs, 15.5oz (Fly + Nest + Pole Set) (the stakes and guy lines add to the weight) the 2p is 2lbs, 6oz (Fly + Nest + Pole Set). 28 square feet vs. 46 square feet.Tents I've owned include MyTrailCo. 2p, BA Copper Spur 2p, Mountain Hardwear Ghost 3p and a Half Dome (with the replacement pole sets). Etc. Wife and I currently use the Copper Spur 2p. But we are shorter than you and your boyfriend.I've set up and played around with the Nemo Elite, the Nemo Dagger, the Tiger Wall (gets good reviews, just seems kind of fragile to me) and some others. And I've played around with a number of different types of tent stakes while I was at it. We hike with pack covers for the rain and have used them when setting up tents at night.
[The Tiger Wall, btw, seems to last just fine.  It doesn't ventilate quite as well as the CS--Copper Spur, and isn't as free standing.  I still like the CS better, but for my personal use.]But it you are after ""one and done"" the real things you need to know:
What kind of entrance are you comfortable with? Climbing in and out of tents in a store to try lying down in them will help you get a real feel for it. Some people don't mind a front entry. Some really hate them. Some just are ""meh"" on them. I'm kind of in the last group. I can live with them but would rather not.How tight a fit are you comfortable with? At first I thought 30 square feet was a bare minimum. 39 feet felt a little cramped. But in the end with the almost vertical sides [the new Copper Spur], we've been happy with 29 square feet. Go figure. 2 lbs 11 oz. for the Ghost 3p is tempting though. You won't know how fit works for you until you've set up tents, laid down in them and asked yourself how you feel in them (with the rain fly on and buttoned up). Most people on a through hike spend about one out of four days (almost two days a week) in towns in hostels and the like. That really makes a smaller tent easier to live with. Through hiking is a different animal, it is a matter of just not stopping. 12.5% of couples through hiking used a 1p tent (?!). 28% used a 3p tent. 54% of solo hikers used a 2p tent.How much fussing around with your tent at the end of the day are you interested in? The entire free standing vs. not discussion, and the types of tent set up are all focused around this question. A lot of people are happy with either choice.
When you look at the annual hiker survey of AT Hikers, it becomes obvious that there is a wide range of choices that worked for people.
With this in mind look at the statistics Mariposa has developed (you can check 2016, etc. too). https://thetrek.co/appalachian-trail...-hiker-survey/Top 2-person models (used in 2017 on the AT. Note because this consists of numbers from 2017 it won't have the Tiger Wall which is new this year and well worth considering).
Big Agnes Fly Creek HV UL 2 -- single entry, not quite free standing.ZPacks Duplex -- high line. But still only $599. Not free standing by any definition. The total weight for the packed tent is 21.0 ounces. Does not absorb water, can be packed wet after shaking it with little weight penalty.Big Agnes Copper Spur HV UL 2 -- free standing side entry.MSR Hubba Hubba -- free standing, side entry.REI Quarter Dome 2 -- almost free standing.Nemo Hornet 2P, Elite 2P -- both front entry, almost free standing. They were just too small for me. I'm shorter than you are, but you may find them ok. I really wanted to like the Elite 2p. Minimum Trail Weight 1 lb. 12 oz. Packaged Weight 2 lbs. 3 oz.
[Those are the most popular tents on the Appalachian Trail according to the statistics that are being collected.  Year in and year out.  Obviously things that work well for some people are just not the choice for others.  I mean, 12.5% of couples through hiking used a 1p tent and over half of solo hunters used a 2p tent.]
So, lots of people are fine with not freestanding. Lots of people are happy with front entry. Lots of people don't need a high interior. At some point price/weight affects choices (you don't see any through hikers with an REI Half Dome -- 5lb is too much, but the Quarter Dome at about three pounds is a steady seller used by through hikers.
[That isn't to say that a lot of people don't start with heavy tents, they just don't finish through hikes.]For almost every choice but heavy there are lots of people [who] like each choice. I hope that this lays out the how and why of your tent choices better for you and how to decide what you want. Note that many sellers have no questions asked return policies. Try not to abuse those.-------------------------------------------------------I did not suggest hammocks for a couple on the AT. Some day there will be lightweight two person hammocks that let you sleep flat. But today is not that day.
[That pretty much lays out the things I thought through on tent selection.  Or why there is not necessarily a right choice for everyone.]",,View Entry,"Jul 04, Wed",0
d20,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596227,"I've used various ground sheets and not used some.  I've worked with Tyvek, nylon and polycro (also called polycyro).  To quote a section hiker [Philip Werner] [ at https://sectionhiker.com/gossa...]  about it:
Polycryo is a clear, multilayer, cross-linked polyolefin film that is amazingly lightweight, weighing only 1.5 oz for a 40 x 96 inch sheet.
It has three significant advantages.  
It is very, very cheap.  This means that it is easily replaced and can be considered disposable.It is very, very light.It absorbs no water.  That is significant since most tarps and ground sheets absorb some water (or at least are much heavier wet than dry).
You can make a ground sheet, a tarp or even an a-frame tarp-tent out of it.  E.g. https://backpackinglight.com/f...
I'm not willing to go the tent route (polycro tents are almost invisible and quite see through unless the condensation gives you some privacy).  But for a ground sheet to use under a tent or in a shelter, they are great.
The other place polycro works really well is as a tarp/rain fly.  You can set a tent up under a polycro rain-fly and always set up out of the rain.  I run a ridge line (a bit of parachute cord) between two trees.  Toss the tarp over it with 4'-6' of shock cord running from each corner to a tent peg.  That gives me a place out of the rain to set up.  The tarp is made by just getting a sheet of polycro (using a window film kit) and tying shock cord to each corner using a sheet bend knot (the type used for sailing).
I've been very pleased.  The rain tarps are incredibly light (around 2-3 ounces, with the cord) and they absorb no water, so when I got rained on during the night, I still packed up my tent dry in the morning.  The also inhibit condensation on the outside of a tent.
Made into a ground cloth, there are two ways to do it.  The first way to make one is simple.  Just lay out a piece of polycro that is about the right size.  That is what Phillip has done for years.  Compared to Tyvek they are lighter, absorb far less water, and you can see under them for anything that might be a surprise when setting up your tent.  For some reason, the ground or the shelter floor is easier to see (in some ways) after you've laid one down -- so pine cones, branches, rocks, and such stick out more.  I've done variations on this.  If you need more directions:  http://backcountrybanter.com/h...
The second way to make one is a little more work.  
Measure and cut the ground sheet to have your tent overhand it.Seam the edges (I've used Gorilla Tape and the very thin edging material that it comes with to make a tear resistant edge).Make tie-outs.  I've done this several different ways.  Tie some sheet bend knot shock cord to each corner.  Take shock cord to each corner. Make a tie-out from Gorilla Tape (clear), a gasket (plastic) and a thin piece of wood.  The gaskets match up where your tent poles will be.  You can also use this set up to set up the tent poles, anchored by the tie-outs, then put up your tent's rain fly, then put up the tent's interior (where you would usually have to put the interior up first) which can make life a little better in the rain.
Here is what one looks like:  

I've made one like that, and a couple with the various shock cord tie-outs.  My next one will look like the one in the picture, but with clear tape being used.  I will post a picture of it when I get it done.
Of the two, the rain fly and the ground sheet, either can be done without.  Lots of people don't use either.  Others do the entire hike with one.  An important caveat is that this is another example of something that is a matter of personal preference.  However, having hiked with and without them, I find that they are work the effort to make and carry.
And so easy to replace. If it rained less, I'd really say skip the effort (e.g. PCT vs. AT).  If trees were not found everywhere and it wasn't so easy to set up a ridge line I'd also say skip the effort. But when there is no shelter or the shelter is full, and rain is blowing in, it makes for such a nice morning pack-out.
Ground sheets are universal.  Rain flies I learned about from some section hikers who do a lot of winter sections as well as a lot of band weather sections.
In the ""off season"" (e.g., when there are not any bugs) I've know people who just used the rain fly and ground sheet and skipped a tent altogether.",,View Entry,"Jul 04, Wed",0
d20,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596232,"It is fun to listen to people talk about ""the best shoe"" (or the best boot).  
There is no ""best shoe.""
This is because just about every manufacturer has a type of foot their shoes work best for and a way of hiking that their shoes work best for.  As a result, the best shoe for someone else is probably not the best shoe for you.
Even worse, a shoe that is perfect for you, in a new edition may no longer be perfect.  The best example is the Brooks Cascadia.  It started to take the hiking world by storm.  Then Brooks came out with new editions. If you don't know, Brooks is known for narrow shoes.  Most hiker's feet spread.  The new editions were narrow.  Brooks went from loved to hated.
Now they are trying again.  No surprise, reviews for the new Cascadia (the 13) are few and far between.  In fact, the first page of Google results looking for a Cascadia 13 review will send you to the 10. ( https://trailrunnermag.com/gea...).  It was a fine shoe for runners with narrow feet.  A terrible shoe for backpackers.Anyway, the ""best shoe"" is one of three or four (out of literally more than a hundred possibilities) that fits your particular feet and hiking style.////////////////Now for some quoted material [with their links] -- the sort of pre-trail preparation and research I did that brought me to my conclusions.///////////////
Statistics for 2016 reflected the following (looking at Mariposa's blogging on things). https://thetrek.co/appalachian...
The Top Footwear Brands
As in years past, Salomon, Brooks, and Merrell were among the most popular footwear brands of AT long-distance hikers. Salomon was the top brand, as before, but Altra entered the running, from being worn by less than 4 percent of hikers last year, to over 12 percent this year.
Most Popular Hiking Shoes
Low top versions of the Salomon X Ultra (non GTX version)Low top versions of the Merrell Moab Ventilators, which comes in a Men’s and Women’s version
/////////////////Back to me////////////////Salomons are too narrow for me.  
My bottom line:
You need to find shoes that fit your feet, under a load (a backpack) with 30 lbs in it (even if you expect to never carry quite that much).  Do a week long section hike shake down with the shoes.
Get ones that fit your feet and the way you hike.
I've tried a lot of shoes.  Some threw my knees out.  Some left my feet sore after only 3-4 miles.  All the ones that did not work for me worked very well for others.

Of interest, as to other gear, Mariposa had the following to say (edited to delete things she got significant push-back on):///////////////Back to quoting (and I wish she were still writing)///////////////
Other than winter layers, bug nets, and other seasonal gear, the items hikers most commonly discarded were:
Parts or all of their First Aid kitsBear proof sacks or cans (these are necessary in other regions of the U.S., but not the AT)Bear spray or pepper spraySecondary electronic devices (e.g. tablets, Kindles)CamerasTowelsSolar chargers (useless in the “green tunnel”)Surplus tent stakesMicrospikes (not needed unless you’re hiking very late or early in the season)“My dignity” (you better expect you’ll become hiker trash)
Most of these items, such as bear canisters and bear spray, are commonly used (or required) in other regions of the U.S., but they are unnecessary on the Appalachian Trail. Bear spray is primarily designed for use with bear species like grizzlies, which we don’t have on the east coast. Before hiking the AT, you should educated yourself on behavior around black bears, and if you do that, you won’t need bear spray.
As woman who was traveling alone, I did bring pepper spray on my 2014 thru-hike, but that was a precaution against creepy men, not wildlife. I never had to use it but I did feel safer hiking alone at night, and it hardly weighs anything.
The following items are so unnecessary that hardly anyone brings them in the first place. If, for some reason, you’re thinking of bringing these, just don’t:
Secondary light source (just bring 1 light source and spare batteries)Additional sleeping pads or bagsGround mat for under a hammockMacheteSawMirrorPocket showerSatellite phone
This graph shows how many people discarded these items (on the left) and how many added them (on the right).
 I highly recommend all hikers carry them in nearly all thru-hiking circumstances:
Water purification of some kind: if you don’t treat your water, you are more likely to get sick. End of story.Soap or hand sanitizer: you’re probably fine if you just bring one or the other, but you’re likely to get sick if you don’t bring either.Compass: If you don’t bring a compass, whistle, and light source, you are likely to get lost and/or injured. I was astonished that NINE hikers said they discarded their compasses, especially after the widely publicized death of Geraldine Largay. She did not have a compass and left her SPOT device in a hotel room, then died only two miles from the AT because she became lost and disoriented. Compasses are small and lightweight, so there’s no reason to discard them.WhistleLight sourceTrowel: I did not bring a trowel on my AT thru-hike, but I’ve learned more about Leave-No-Trace practices since then, and become more concerned about the heavy traffic on the AT. Please consider bringing a trowel.Groundcloth: Groundcloths, trekking poles, and duct tape are staples that nearly all thru-hikers rely on, so bring these unless you have extensive experience and a specific reason not to.Trekking polesDuct tapeBattery pack: Nine hikers added a spare battery pack and no hikers shook this down, so it might be a good idea to bring one.",,View Entry,"Jul 04, Wed",0
d20,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596604,"TrowelI""ve used snow stakes for a trowel.  They just don't cut it unless the ground is soft.  Too many people don't use a trowel at all, they claim that they can make it work with just a hiking pole and kicking the duff (the ground cover).  When they do that unless the situation is perfect, what the do is leave poop way too close to the surface.  You can smell it when someone has done that.As far as trowels go there is the classic plastic trowel.  I haven't used it.  There is the Deuce of Spades.  Excellent, light, aluminum, in lots of colors.  I liked mine, it is just a little short.  There are some titanium trowels. I picked one up from Massdrop with a credit I had.  Narrower and longer than the Deuce.  For most of the situations I've encountered, digging deeper, but not quite as much (the narrow vs. wide) is better.  Not sure I would have picked it up if it were not free.Hat & BuffI use a Tilley Hat. I had something very similar that I lost.  The wide brim provides me with protection from rain and from sunburn when hiking (I burn much too easily) and covers my ears and neck.  Many hikers will do just as well with a cap or a cap and sunscreen.  Tilley Hat is a category (mine happens to be that brand, but the one that disappeared was not).  Pricing can be from under $20.00 (which is what I'm willing to pay) to way too much. https://www.amazon.com/Tilley-...  Often out there used as well.Buffs vary in price, weight and color.  Pick one you like and that is the lowest price the week you buy it.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009... is what I got, lower price when I bought it.  I have a lightweight one for warmer weather and a heavy fleece/snow skiing one for cold, cold weather.  Wool will keep you warm when wet, dries out easily, doesn't pick up smells.Bug screen.  I need to pick one up some time.WaterI use a three liter reservoir and it hangs in a water proof separator in my pack. I use a mouthpiece so I can drink as I walk.  I've tried water bottles (and lots of people use Gatorade bottles and fruit juice bottles work really well -- lighter and better shaped than Gatorade), but the platypus system works well for me.  I can carry enough water when there is drought, it is easy to get to and drink through the day, and I can add electrolyte powder to it easily.  I've seen people hiking with as little as a single one liter bottle.  You can tell people who are ""signaling"" status who list a Nalgene bottle as part of their equipment. The weight/price/etc. on them just doesn't justify it. Compare the Nalgene to a Welch's Cranberry Juice bottle emptied out (weight, price, etc.).  https://www.amazon.com/Bike-Mi...First Aid and CookingMy wife (a CRNA) carries the first aid kit -- basically a tick removal tool.  We also both carry a little bit of cleanser (hand sanitizer) and biodegradable wet wipes, our own tooth brushes, tooth paste (dehydrated pellets), tenacious tape.For cooking we've tried a lot of systems and alternatives.  The basic choices are a canister system where it all fits together (like the MSR Windburner https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Y... which has an available 1.7 liter pot) and a pocket rocket and titanium pot.  We've used both.  The MSR uses less fuel, boils water faster, etc.  (there are also alcohol stoves made out of cat food cans.  One of the pioneers for those never carries one on a trip longer than three days because the fuel weight at that point makes them heavier than a canister attached to rocket.

d20,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596317,"Something that fascinated me when reading through hikers and their finishing gear lists was that many of them had backpacks that were heavier than they started with (the backpackers who switched from an Exos to an Atmos are the largest group), others had other switches, and most people who finished had light backpacks.
The truth is, just like shoes, backpacks have to fit your body.  
In addition, backpacks have to fit the use you are putting them to.
For example, when we first bought backpacks, the guy at REI steered us to the award winning Gregory Baltoro 75 (and the woman's version) which was about five pounds at the time.
https://www.outdoorgearlab.com...
There are reasons the pack wins awards.  Carries a heavy load well.  Lots of organization, has a built in day pack, sturdy, one of the best expedition packs out there.
But.
If you aren't camping in the snow, if you don't need the direct access, if you would rather not carry quite so much weight, it really isn't the right pack.  For the Appalachian Trail it is really, really the wrong back.
Since we got them at REI, REI took them back.  I ended up with an Osprey Exos that fits me very well.  I use a very limited number of stuff sacks for organization (a couple ounces instead of a couple pounds).  Currently have the ""brain"" (the top compartment/lid) off as it reduces the weight a little.
My wife tried an Exos, it didn't fit her well.  She has a different pack now. One that fits her just right and weighs a lot less than her first pack. But it took three trips to get the right pack for her and to make sure it was the right pack.  BTW, she liked the Exos pack cover, so she kept that for use in the rain (and there is going to be a lot of rain).
I've run across a lot of packs on the section hikes we've done.
We've done:
The Inn-to-Inn route in Virginia to Luray.  Then South from the North Georgia border.  Then north from Luray to Harper's Ferry.  Then north from Harper's Ferry to Pennsylvania (stopping before the rocks).
I've seen just about everything being used.
But there are good reasons for the most popular backpacks and good reasons why the cottage industry packs are still in business and doing well.

d20,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596319,"One great thing about doing a number of section hikes over a number of years is the chance to explore gear.
Shoes
I started with cross-trainers.  I have walked and hiked with hard court tennis shoes and then the related cross trainer styles for years.  After that I picked up some Vasques at an REI garage sale that I really liked (the ones I had have been discontinued).  They wore out.  I tried some New Balance 400s.  Nothing breathes like them.  The last is defective and the support disappears within a hundred miles or so of use (they've been discontinued to). Which I discovered when I started to get foot pain from them.
Tried basketball shoes (the curved ""rocker"" bottom style threw my knees out).  Tried some more various New Balance Trail Runners (had bad luck with them.  I'd advise being very careful of the lower end New Balance shoes, a number of them do not good quality control and the quality varies between which factory makes which color). Others have issues with the rock plates (which can cause trouble if you are carrying a load, it is like walking on a hinge -- thank goodness I tested them out with a backpack filled with sandbags at REI for that set of shoes).
The higher end New Balance shoes are fine.  That is when quality control and everything else kicks in.  I've got a pair I do some walking in.  I think the cushioning is just a little light, but I like them.  But they have flooded just about every niche.  It makes it impossible to get a good handle on what they offer.  To quote from https://www.solereview.com/bes...
""But it does have a problem – that of differentiation within its performance running catalog. There are too many New Balance models with shared ride characteristics, thanks to the lack of a distinct tiering strategy.Let’s take the Vazee line for instance. What’s the difference between the Vazee Pace, Coast, Rush and the Prism? And who should buy the Vazee Pace instead of the Zante?





Also, the ‘Fresh Foam’ platform is quite ordinary. Unlike Saucony’s Everun or the adidas Boost, the New Balance Fresh Foam is regular EVA foam. So it becomes hard to differentiate a Boracay (980) from a 1080 in functional terms except for the lower heel offset.
Today, the product nomenclature is also confusing. Old timers are familiar with New Balance’s numbering system which classified shoes by their intended use.""



I tried Altras (they threw my knees out -- though they were invented to solve certain knee problems, they can cause others).  On the other hand, other than almost crippling me, they were the most comfortable shoes I've used. The issue is the zero drop style.  Zero drop (which means that the heels are the same height as the toes on the shoe) doesn't work well for me.
I bought and used Salomons.  They are just a little too narrow for my feet so that I ended up with sore feet all the time.  If they fit you they are great and a lot of people love the comfort. There is a reason they are well loved and in the top shoes worn on the trial.
I have gone through two pairs of North Face 110s.  I'm planning on trying some other shoes.
Currently looking at:
La Sportiva Wildcats.  (https://sectionhiker.com/la-sp... )Wide toe box ++12mm drop28 ounces
Vasque BreezeDurableGrippy35 ounces
Merrell Moab 2 (https://www.switchbacktravel.c... )33 ouncesComfortableUnderfoot protectionDurable
Cascadia 13Brooks is ever changing.Not much in the way of reviews.Ratings compare it to the Wildcat as not quite as good.  Which got me looking at the Wildcats.
Interestingly enough, while there is a complete subsection of backpacking or ""hiking shoes"" -- and while what is what people are doing on the trail, it seems that instead everyone wears trail runners instead. Trail runners just seem to work better for most people, which got my attention as I started noticing the attempts to market shoes for backpackers to fit the niche that trail runners have created.
One of the first pairs of walking shoes I actually put on were New Balance, and had a rocker action to them.  I could find no reviews, had a bad experience with rocker action in high end basketball shoes, and did not want to learn a new way of walking and hiking as a pioneer.  I also tried out some North Face Hedgehogs.  They are trying to market those to backpackers.  Their 110 trail runner is a better shoe for me (and for most reviewers).
As far as I can tell, there is something that the shoe designers are missing about how the shoes actually function.
I'm curious to find out what I actually settle on for a final shoe.",,View Entry,"Jul 05, Thu",0
d20,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596401,"My first tent for the AT was none.  :)  We did a four day inn-to-inn segment.  Drove to the trail head we were going to hike.  Caught a shuttle south.  Hiked north to our hotel reservation.  Spent the night, then got up and hiked to the next hotel.  
We got there before lunch, and would have kept going except we had reservations where we were.  
The next day, we got up in the mist and hiked in the rain to the next hotel.  The last day we hiked to the trail head, picked up our rental, and drove to a hotel (after a good solid meal).  I lost ten pounds on that trip.
I then spotted a half dome at an REI garage sale.  For about twenty-five dollars it seemed like a great deal.  A little heavy, but split between the two of us, surely it wouldn't be that bad.  [spoiler warning -- every time you look at some thing heavy and think, it won't be that bad -- it is that bad].
The next trip was mostly in shelters, with a night in the tent (and the poles broke -- we replaced them later).  I realized it was too heavy.  So I picked up a tent from Mytrailco. https://mytrailco.com/collecti...
It only weighed about two and a half pounds.  Semi-freestanding.  It was a tight 28 square feet, and it doesn't ventilate as well as some tents.  Lots of people use tents like that (including single wall tarp-tents) and just use a microfiber small towel or wash cloth and rub the moisture off.  (The cheapest place to get a microfiber small towel or wash cloth is a dollar store or grocery store where they are about a dollar or less.  At outdoor stores they get closer to $20 and not any better). 
That one got returned, some people love it, but it didn't fit us just right.
Then Happy bought me a tent for a father's day surprise.  https://www.mountainhardwear.c... (note that it is often available for under $300.00 -- do not pay full price or even close to that).  
A lot of positives, even if it really is only semi-freestanding.  Here is a review of the smaller UL2 version of the same tent.
https://sectionhiker.com/mount...
It ventilates like a house on fire.  
Weight Packed: 3 lb 6.7 oz / 1551 gWeight Minimum: 3 lb 1.8 oz / 1413 gTent Capacity: 3Number of Poles: 1Number of Doors: 1Number of Vestibules: 1Height Interior: 39 in / 99 cm
We only used it a couple of times.  Once on the trail.  Once in the back yard with cold weather to test some gear.  Nothing like a stiff breeze blowing through your tent at around 32 degrees to decide that perhaps it ventilates too well.
We finally went with the new Big Agnes Copper Spur.
It is freestanding, which at the end of the day makes setting it up just a little easier.It has near vertical sides, the new design makes for vastly improved interior space and height with dual side entries.It is large enough for the two of us (remembering that about 1/8 of all hiking couples use a one person tent -- they are smaller than us, 1/2 of all single hikers use a two person tent and a substantial number of couples use a three person tent).  For us it is a good size.It ventilates well (but is adjustable to ventilate less).  Better than the Tiger Wall.  But it can have the ventilation reduced and is easily adjustable.It is just a little more substantial than some alternatives (e.g. the Copper Spur Platinum which has a number of reports of rain coming through the fabric; others that felt just a little too fragile).
It helps that we don't do much in a tent except crawl in and sleep.  With rain we tend to get up and get moving rather than try to wait it out.  No cooking in the tent (which is a bad idea anyway).  No eating in the tent.
The picture with this post is of the Ghost UL3 and the Copper Spur UL2 set up side by side in the back yard.  
The Ghost is 39 square feet vs. the CS (Copper Spur gets abbreviated as CS a lot) at 29 square feet.  2.99 lbs (as actually weighed as we packed it) vs. 2 lbs 12 ounces.  I have to admit that when I sold the UL3, I substituted titanium stakes (which was a selling point some buyers liked) for the original ones, which I kept.  The folded aluminum stakes are stronger and lighter than solid pegs and I've been pleased with them.  
I have not been able to find anything like them for sale.  I use a combination of those and titanium stakes on for my polycro rain fly and vestibules, etc. in staking out the Copper Spur to keep it from blowing away when in use.
The bottom line is that the original backpack and tent I had weighed over ten pounds together.  I originally also used a Noah's Tarp which added almost another three.  Now the tent and backpack together weigh about five pounds, the tarp I use adds an ounce or so.
Big improvement from about fifteen pounds to about five pounds.
https://www.rei.com/product/11...
Bottom lines:  Copper Spur is a great tent. For PCT hikers it is the one tent that was used a lot and that no one felt like upgrading away from it. 

If budget is an issue, a great tent is the Kandhan. $100.00 vs $350 or so (typical sale price for the CS).

d20,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596523,"Most of what passes for wisdom on rain gear has to do with temperature control rather than keeping dry.  As a result, most clothing lists will have a rain jacket or a windshell rather than a rain jacket and a windshell.  
That said, there are hikers who hike with umbrellas (attached to their packs -- that way they are still free to use their hands and arms to make use of their hiking poles).  There are hikers who hike with rain jackets of various types.  There are hikers with ""packas"" and similar things.  There are hikers with ponchos.
For me, a poncho just made the most sense.  I even carried a couple of them ""just in case"" on our first section hike.  Sure enough, it rained, we ended up using them.  I discovered that a poncho and I don't work well together after a couple of attempts.  So, it made a lot of sense, but a poncho just did not work out for me, in spite of trying different ponchos and approaches.
There are lots of advantages.  You can get a poncho that covers you and your pack.  Lots of ventilation.  And ... just didn't work for me.  You can also get rain sleeves to go with your poncho (think of them like gaiters for your arms).  They make them of Tyvek and of Nylon and just about every other combination.  Every objection has an answer, but if it doesn't work for you it doesn't work for you.
I haven't tried an umbrella on the trail though I've used them outside of the trail.  They kind of work like a huge hat.  Even better ventilation.  They can protect against rain and sun and make backpacking a little cooler when the sun is hot.  Lots of people swear by them.
I just didn't connect.
In the same line as a Poncho is the Packa (a modified poncho with a cult following) and the extra long rain jacket (with a french name) that kind of covers the area of a jacket and a rain skirt.
Which is a reminder that in addition to rain pants, there are rain skirts or kilts.  I've hiked with two different ones.  I like them better than rain pants.  I've met guys who just transitioned to hiking with their rain skirt and compression shorts.  I haven't gone that far. But that is what I now carry for rain.  And lots of people just do without, having either water resistant or waterproof pants or shorts, or just not worrying about getting their legs wet.
Which brings me back to rain jackets.
There are several types.
Water resistant ones.  They leak or wet through eventually.  Their sole purpose is to keep you warm(er) in the rain.  Rather than fight the fight on how to ventilate sweat, they give up the fight and expect you to get wet from both sides.  In normal life, you might carry one of those in your car and use it only to dash from the car to somewhere else before it soaked through.
Waterproof ones.  These are totally waterproof.  The classic yellow rain coat you may have had in grade school would have been one.  Often very heavy.  Sold to tourists.  They trap sweat inside of them.  If you aren't carrying a load or going very far or very long, they will keep you dry (since you won't have time or reason to break a sweat).  Some come with what are referred to as ""pit zips"" which is a zipper on the underside of your arm/arm pits that ventilates the jacket by opening it up where the rain isn't hitting.
Water vapor permeable ones.  Like goretex.  In theory, as you sweat the water vapor can exit through the jacket while rain is kept out.  Many ""water resistant"" jackets are variations on gore tex that just don't work as well as they should.  Some have pit zips as well.  Others use breathable water resistant fabric where the pit zips go.
You can pair any of these with gaiters (knee high or ankle high) to cover the parts of your legs that stick out of a rain kilt -- or with rain pants.
Mark 1 Rain Skirt http://www.trailjournals.com/j...
Important points.
What works for you is something you probably need to experiment with.Most backpackers are happy with their rain gear, and the bottom line is ""cost is probably the most important criteria behind the purchase decision"" (see below, link and copy of some of the statistics).Light and cheap is possible for at least one item of gear selection and light, cheap and satisfied is possible.
For me that translated to a rain jacket and a rain kilt (instead of rain pants).  Of the various jackets, I liked the https://www.rei.com/product/11... best.
I also use a Tilley Hat for sun protection (I burn easily) and I hike with the knowledge that when it is cold, the rain jacket also works as a windshell.  I accept that I am probably going to sweat and probably going to get wet (which is why a dry base layer, used only to sleep in, is important).
Anyway, over several years, that is my thinking as to rain gear.

Top 10 Backpacking Rain Jackets
The most popular rain jacket purchased by the backpackers we surveyed is the Marmot Precip Jacket, perhaps the best known waterproof/breathable outdoor recreation jacket ever made. An astonishing 28.8% of our survey respondents own this rain jacket, far more than any other, as shown in the table below.

What do these results tell us?
First, slightly over 50% of our survey respondents purchased one of three rain jackets: the Marmot Precip, the Frogg Toggs UL Rain Suit, or the Outdoor Research Helium II rain jacket. Knowing backpackers, it’s incredible that so many would share such a strong consensus about these three items.
Second, none of the top 10 rain jackets are made with a Gore-tex or eVent waterproof/breathable membrane. It would seem that having a Gore-tex or eVent membrane is unimportant to most backpackers when purchasing a rain jacket. That’s an eye opener.
Third, the backpackers who own these jackets are fairly satisfied with them (on a scale of 1-5, where 5 is the highest level of satisfaction,) but most of the ratings fall between 3 and 4, not approaching a 5. If you were reading customer reviews on an online retailer’s web site, I doubt these ratings would have a big impact on your decision-making for or against a product. This tells me that cost is probably the most important criteria behind the purchase decision to buy one of these jackets, not performance or features. We see further evidence of this below.",,View Entry,"Jul 07, Sat",0

Now she has us walking four miles every night with sandbags in our packs. It is surprising how fast that has gotten easy (just twenty pound sandbags but still). Since our base weight (pack/sleeping bag/pad + tent or cooking gear) is under ten pounds, 22 pounds or so to hike with is fair  
The funny thing is I like my shoes better when I’m carrying a pack. 
I’d forgotten that they feel better with a load. I’ve suddenly lost interest in checking out other shoes. Do need a rock plate insert. 
I’m not sure how much conditioning we are getting, but we would walk the four miles anyway.  As we get closer to October we will probably move up to six miles a night  
I’m also working on stretching my calves just started with deep squats to stretch and they seem to work  
Just one more step  

//an aside

Our first section hike we planned on ten miles a day.  That turned out to be easy for us.  We’ve done longer or just stopped early on some hikes.  I’m beginning to think that we can do fifteen a day without too much stress.  Will see how it goes on October.
Then will see how things go next year.  Planning on a hostel or hotel about twice a week.  Taking time when the weather is hideous.  Making sure it is pleasant rather than a grind.

d20,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598278,"We have tried various types of pre-hike conditioning for our section hikes.Weights.  Walking 4-5 miles a day.  Stair climbing (I even knew a guy who went downtown and climbed up the stairs in a skyscraper, then rode the elevator down, then repeated, with a full pack).  Martial arts training (the hard kind, where you sweat 3-4 lbs off during a work-out).Most recently we started carrying full packs for hiking a local 4 mile circuit every evening.A couple-three things.I found I like my Northface 110 GTX shoes a lot better when carrying a pack.  I tried some Wildcats (too narrow).  Some other shoes (too narrow).  Haven't tried the Cascadia 12s yet.  But I'm suddenly much happier with the Northface 110.  I may very well just stick with them.  Within a week, carrying 20lb or so of sandbags in a pack it was much easier to walk with the load.  We seemed to condition fairly quick.My knees felt better with the weight (in fact, I realized I hadn't had knee pain for some time).Given how the weather got insufferably warm, we are holding off more hiking with packs, just going on our normal walks.  But I feel better about putting off the conditioning given just how fast we started to adjust.We will start up again in September, a month or so before we do our two week section hike, then in January for our February 15 through hike start (remembering that the ""official"" through hike definition is what you can do in a 365 day window.  Starting at February 15 with fifteen days already in is like getting a February 1 start without the February 1 weather).I'm comfortable with the conditioning we will be able to do.  We may push it up to eight miles a night instead of four, depending on the trails available, etc.  But I'm positive about the way we started to adjust.",,View Entry,"Jul 25, Wed",0
d20,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598281,"Well, had a good rain, so we did a four miler with packs and rain gear to see how it did.
The rain skirts worked like a charm.  Ok, we are using ""real"" ones (not the Mark 1 in the picture), so they are incredibly light, breath well, and do well.  
We have a set of very lightweight, but very waterproof, gaiters for each of us.  Those did very well too.  No water got into my 110 GTXs from the top, Happy's feet stayed dry too. The skirt/gaiter combination worked much better than rain pants for us, and was much, much lighter than the Mark 1 DIY.
Now, Outdoor Research and Youngone and Moosejaw are now kind of WalMart brands, just like Patagonia.  However, that has not reduced the price.
On the other hand, both the Helium II Happy had and my Helium Hybrid wetted out very quickly.  Hers went back to REI.  Mine I'm going to use Nikwax and try to renew the DWR.  It appears to be a known issue that some of them need renewed before their first rainfall (e.g. mine, first  serious use was when it failed me), but renewal seems to fix that.  Happy got her money refunded and then bought a Goretex replacement.
We will do another stress test, or I may just do a stand in the shower test.  :)
Heck, I'm going to do the five minutes in the shower thing.
I'll report on that next.
But I want a jacket that will keep me dry in cold rain. For warm rain/warm weather I don't really care, I've friends who hike wet.
And, I've friends who do the Continental Divide with afternoon sleet in just a rain jacket and shorts and let their legs get wet. A lot of people are comfortable with that.
More thoughts and reports when I know more and have better data.

d20,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/598621,"So, I went and tried on some more shoes.A couple thoughts. First, I loved the Altras I had, but they threw my knees out and I had a couple months of painful rehab before I was recovered from them. I tried Salomon X Ultras but they were too narrow. The section hike I wore them on had me with aching feet from the start of the day, every day.
I'm on my second pair of North Face Ultra 110 GTXs. The first I picked up when my knees couldn't take the Altras any longer. When they wore out, I bought another. I find that they actually feel better on my feet with a 20 lb pack than walking in them without one.  The more I've trained a little here and there carrying a load (remembering we had a stretch of weather at 100+), the happier I've been with them.  My feet manage not to get too much sweat and heat trapped in them.
I've been interested in how the Salomon Odyssey Pros, especially the new ""through hiker"" edition (out early 2019) are going to turn out. Are they wide enough? Will they have enough cushion. Wildcats were not quite wide enough for me.  A test walk in them at REI and I put them back in the box.  Live and learn.And, I'm wondering if the ""triple crown, through hiker"" Odyssey Pro will be any different except for cosmetics.I keep looking at changing my shoes up, especially since the latest 110s have been adjusted again by North Face.  I need to try a pair of the revised ones on to see if the changes affect the way they feel on my feet.
Anyway, looking forward to more updates.Links:https://www.switchbacktravel.c... -- Salomon Pro Odyssey review.http://www.trailingthought.com... -- another review.https://www.trailingadventures... -- a review at 700 miles of a pair.  The review that got my interest.The new Odyssey Triple Crown Trail Magic -- https://www.rei.com/blog/hike/...https://www.amazon.com/Osprey-...  Osprey Exoshttps://www.amazon.com/Salomon...

So, I ended back at REI and Arc’teryx gear was on sale, a dramatic sale.  I now have a new rain jacket as well.
We are in the process of changing homes, so our training and practice is down, but we have everything pretty dialed in.  I cooked a trail meal for Sunday dinner and enjoyed it.

d20,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603082,"For my very first section hike I read a lot of essays on food.  Lots of people recommended Lipton Sides or Knorr Sides (same thing, same manufacturer, same product line, name depends on where marketed) with either chicken or tuna in foil.
The recommended breakfast food of choice was pop-tarts.
I discovered that I'm not that fond of the sides.  Luckily there were hiker boxes to leave them in and at home we have a daughter who really likes them.
A dinner usually has two parts:
ProteinCalorie Base (carbohydrates and fats).
I found that freeze dried meat was a lot lighter than meat in a foil packet, and carrying a lot wasn't that much of a problem.  Amazon Prime can send out a new can to you every-so-often.  Nut butters are also a choice, as is cheese.
For the calorie base, you have the following choices:
Lipton/Knorr Sides.  Pasta and rice.Stuffing Mix.Freeze dried Lentil Soup Freeze dried refried beans.Couscous.Mashed Potato Mix.Rice.Noodles.Oatmeal.
With most of these you can add in butter (it lasts surprisingly long without refrigeration) or olive oil, salt and pepper.  It adds to the flavor and the calories.
Surprisingly, noodles are easier to eat than pasta.  Lots of people live off of Ramen noodles.  I found that the Lentil Soup was ok, especially with freeze dried taco meat.
But what I really found was that practicing and experimenting with food really made a difference as I found that I enjoyed Oatmeal as a meal sometimes for dinner and that I didn't really enjoy pasta sides.
A breakfast is often best simple.
That is, two packages of pop-tarts.  A bagel with cream cheese.  Another bagel.  Get up, get moving.  A little variety made it better (otherwise I got tired of pop-tarts and left packages in hiker boxes).  The bagels are surprisingly good, calorie dense and travel well.
Lunch can be the same thing or similar to breakfast
Maybe add some lunch meat to the bagel sandwich.
 Town food can make a good spacer.
Now this is where your budget becomes important.  But if you can afford it, hamburgers, pizza, Reuben sandwiches and Philly Cheese steaks can give you a blast of calories, protein and variety.  You will hit a town or something similar every 3-4 days.
Discover if you can eat hamburgers (I can) or if you can't stand pizza (my condolences if that is you).

Hiking shorts
I'm surprised at how much I like some I picked up at Costco.  I'm not sure I'll use them on the trail, they may be worn out by then because I've worn them so much for walking and practice hikes.
But there are inexpensive shorts out there that are really good.
=========================================================
Shoes
I've tried some more.  Ended up picking up another pair of North Face shoes (my current pair is wearing out).  I'm surprised at how happy I feel with them every time I carry a pack around while wearing them.
I'm also surprised at how well the Costco wool hiking socks are wearing.  I'm not hiking in them (I got insectshield treatment for the socks I plan to hike in already).  If I'd known they would wear so well, I'd have gotten some of them treated too.",,View Entry,"Sep 16, Sun",0

The Ultra (Ultra 3 GTX)The SpeedcrossThe Odyssey

The Ultra has a great arch support last (the ""last"" is the framework style of the shoe) but is too narrow for me. I used a pair for a section hike. It gets great reviews (consider https://www.switchbacktravel.c... for an example). If it just were not so narrow, I'd be wearing them to hike now. But my feet hurt every night when I wore them on a section hike.
They do make the Ultra in a Mid that is a wide, but I'm not interested (at least now) in a Mid.
The Speedcross is the best selling Salomon shoe, and comes in a wide. It just has an extended arch (feels like a bar of soap instead of an arch -- a little longer and broader than I'm used to) and I just couldn't make my feet like it.
The Odyssey is the one they are getting ready to market for through hikes and long distance hikers (they are even releasing a redone one in February of 2019 named the Odyssey Through Hiker Triple Crown). It is breathable, quick drying and has a high wear sole (designed more for trail hikers and durability). It even has a redesigned/restructured mid that will resist breakdown so the shoes will be good for as long as the sole lasts.I special ordered a pair through my local REI (so I could return them if they were a bust).  
And ... and ... it has no arch support to speak of. The flattest shoe I've tried. It is intentionally wider (hikers feet widen out).  I liked everything else, other than my feet were uncomfortable in them immediately and it didn't get better regardless of what I tried.
So, back to the The North Face Ultra 110 GTX -- especially as it actually feels better on my feet with a backpack.
I've tried all the various Salomon incarnations, trying to regain the feel of the Ultra without the ""too narrow"" and it just hasn't happened, at least without giving in and going to a mid, which I don't want to do.",,View Entry,"Sep 30, Sun",0

We were dropped off at the parking lot, backtracking to the terminus and then on to Hawk Mountain like AWOL recommended for an easy start. That got us to Mike 7.8. We were there and settled in at the shelter early enough to nap from 4:00 to 6:00 when I realized I’d left the butter in the hotel freezer. Met a Latvian-American SF officer named Josh who shared the shelter with us.

It suggests tenting, though there is a shelter. 
Happy looked at the trail and we pressed on. Water was a problem so we were going to tent where there was supposed to be water. 
Did not find anything (though there was solid, cold rain) and I was greatful for waterproof rain gear that did not wet through). 
Then I went back looking for a stream. 
Ok. First, it is a spring, not a stream. 
Second, it is closer to the road then advertised. 
Third, the water is not on the secondary trail, but next to a campsite that drops off the trail. 
Luckily that is all in the comments in Guthooks. 
Unfortunately, I’m like the other guy and walked well past the water before doubling back. 
It was good fortune for two other guys looking for water since they were passing the campground and would have made the same mistake I had. 
I saved them from that.

d20,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604283,"Well, it was only ten trail miles but we ended up walking further. The rainstorm helped with water and we met a lot of people. Blood Mountain is a popular day hike. 
Mountain Crossing is where I met my first mouse in five section hikes. I woke up. Mouse noses on your feet are cold. 
They provide bins to protect your food so I didn’t lose anything. 
Happy and I slept on the bean bags to get away from the mold. 
Note:
Pizza is no longer free with the bed. It is a separate charge (and you can also get Dominos to deliver). 
Most hiker hostels provide sheets, but no pillow. A classic hostel does not provide sheets but has a pillow. This one had no sheets or pillows, which makes sense as a hiker is covered for both. 
Also. The washing machine broke a while back. Guidebooks are wrong when they suggest you can get laundry done.
