Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608516,"So we have spent the weekend doing last minute packing and adjusting. David figured we should carry 5 days + 1 extra meal. After loading that into his pack and hefting it onto his back, he quickly changed his mind. He reminded me of Katz in “A Walk in the Woods”, throwing out food and saying “We don’t need this! This is too heavy!” I will be carrying the tent and assorted odds and ends - first aid kit, power bank & phone cords, etc. I have laughed with friends about maybe hiring a Sherpa to carry our packs! 
I will be bringing a paper journal and pen for journaling too. I’m old-fashioned in that respect and will journal on paper and then add to this journal when I can. I will only have my phone and I’m not crazy about typing journal entries on that little keyboard. Maybe I should hire a teenage Sherpa to type my journal entries online. :)",,View Entry,"Mar 19, Tue",0
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608512,Tonight will be the final shakedown of our pack. David stopped at our local and awesome outfitters and talked to them about the logistics of carrying water and about food weight. We have packed about 4-1/2 days of food and the weight is about 16 pounds. They said that was a good weight for 2 people.We are excited and nervous!,,View Entry,"Mar 21, Thu",0
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608609,"So last night we did another run-through of our backpacks and re-weighed them. David was 37.2 and mine was 31.6. I was pretty shocked and upset at the weight gain. (The first time I weighed my pack I was in the low 20's.) I walked around part of the night wearing it to get used to the feel. 
I've decided to take my pack with me tomorrow and have a shake-down done at the local outfitters. I've also decided to embrace technology and threw out the paper journal and pen. This girl is going high-tech (if you call a smartphone high-tech.)
Today at work I was called up to the front office. As I walked into the principal's office I was serenaded with the song ""Happy Trails"". On the desk was a beautiful cake with ""Happy Trails"" written on it. My job rocks!! I love my co-workers!! We spent some time talking about my upcoming adventure and whether I was brave or crazy. We laughed and laughed and laughed. I will miss them so much! I will miss everyone at school so much!Today was David's last day at work. They took him to lunch at Massaki and then had a party at work. Speeches were made, stories shared, and there were damp eyes. He was truly highly thought of and loved. He will miss the people he worked with very much and has already made plans to meet up with a group of them when we pass through Waynesboro.We leave for GA tomorrow and then the adventure really begins! Can't wait!",,View Entry,"Mar 22, Fri",0
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608702,"We both slept fairly well last night. The nerves are kicking in this morning. Mackenzie was up early and ready to go. (Hmm. Is she anxious to get us out of the house so she is now the boss??)I sent out an email to our neighbors to verify today was really the day. We stopped by to say a personal goodbye to one couple. Told them to stay healthy till we saw them in June. They were avoid hikers in their younger days so they are really excited for us. The drive to GA was about 8 hours and David insisted on driving the whole way. Mackenzie and Megan slept most of the way. Kenz offered to drive the last 15 minutes and we laughed about that.We had Mexican for dinner and, as always, I ate too many chips and felt bloated afterwards. Ugh!We are staying at a nice little local hotel called the Stratford Motor Inn in East Ellijay, GA.TOMORROW'S THE BIG DAY!",,View Entry,"Mar 23, Sat",0
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608703,"Did not sleep well. Weather is supposed to be nice today but tomorrow is rain and thunderstorms. Nothing like starting things out with a bang.
Tried to eat this morning but nothing really settled. Note to self while dressing, Injinji socks have a right and left!
We are leaving in a few minutes for Amicolola Falls State Park and the adventure begins!",,View Entry,"Mar 24, Sun",0
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609103,"March 24 (Day 1): Got going about 6:30am to get over to the 7:00am breakfast. I couldn't eat. I was sick to my stomach with nerves. Went to the bathroom about 3 times in an hour (probably more info than you wanted). The drive to Amicalola State Park was 19 miles.
We got there and registered and got our AT tags. I am 1395. David is 1396. Bob weighed our packs. Mine was 32 lbs and David's was 40. Splinter gave us a 15-minute talk on trail do and don't. They said the registration was slow today. They had only had about 20 hikers register so far that day.
We had our pictures taken under the arch. Some with the girls too. Then the tears began. We all cried and cried. I had made copy of a picture of all the girls. David pulled the picture out of his pack and showed it to them. They said “Great, dad. Now you're going to die!” We always joke when we see a movie and some character pulls out a family picture to show everyone. We say “Well, that guy is going to die.” And it never fails. That character always dies. Hopefully we will make it through. :)
We finally got on our way and headed up the hill. The girls called out “The sign says the Approach Trail is to the left.” Great! We start our hike by taking the wrong path! 
We came back and walked towards the falls. It's the tallest falls east of the Mississippi. 604 steps up the side of the falls! I met our first Trail Angel, Jeremy. He gave me a filter and a Tornado Tube to go on our Sawyer filtration system. Woo hoo. Thanks, Jeremy! I also saw some trail magic on the steps up. A box of Kleenex. My nose runs all the time so I was happy to see it. The box was the Wonder Woman symbol.
I won't lie, the Approach Trail was brutal. Alot of uphill climbing… and that was after the 604 stairs!
We met a bunch of hikers: Shaun, Grey Fox, Whitey (James from Ireland) to name a few. Most don't have their trail names yet, but some do. (Grey Fox named himself because he heard of one hiker getting the trail name Two Poops and he didn't want to get a name like that. Haha)
We finally got to the Southern Terminus about 5:30pm. We signed the log and headed to the Springer Mt shelter. We were told that by shelter standards it was a palace and it was. Two privy's, fresh water, and a big shelter with an upper floor.
David went to the stream to get water and I set up the stove and tent. Walking past the tent David noticed a couple small holes in the rain tarp of our tent. (We think it happened when I was waterproofing the tent on the back deck at home and the wind grabbed the tent and threw it.) Tomorrow calls for rain and thunderstorms. I searched everywhere and could not find the repair kit I brought. Luckily our neighbor, Michael, had a kit and we were able to repair a number of holes. He is just section hiking while trying out a new pack. He brought his beautiful German Shepherd, Apollo,with him.
We cooked a quick dinner of pasta with Lipton soup to flavor. I only ate a little. I just don't have an appetite right now. Hit the privy and then the sleeping bag. I'm done for the day.","Amicalola Falls Visitors Center

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609104,"March 25 (Day 2): Last night was a bad night for David. He felt sick and couldn't sleep. He got up 3 times in the middle of the night. Everytime one of us would move the sleeping pad made, what seemed to me, a really loud noise. I was concerned about disturbing the neighbors, but poor David. He really had a bad night. I slept on and off.
Not sure what time we got up but if David hadn't been sick I would have strangled him. The alarm on his phone went off at 6:15am!
We tried to make breakfast and I thought I had lit the fire on the little propane can because I could hear the hissing. After about 5 minutes we realized we were just listening to the propane escaping. Crap! Ended up having poptarts for breakfast.
We left the Springer Mt shelter about 10:30am and got to the Stover Creek shelter about 12:00. That was only 2.6 miles. I'm told that's called a “nero day” which stands for “near zero” day. The rain is due about 3:00pm with thunderstorms. Since we found holes in the rain tarp, we decided to stop here for the night. That way we will stay dry tonight AND won't have to pack up a wet tent in the morning.
Lots of hikers have come and many decided to push on. But the rain started shortly after. It has not stopped and the shelter is filling up but the conversation is wonderful! Folks from NC, CT, Arkansas. Amy is a veterinarian and is here with her standard poodle, Nash. Tyler is a hoot and has really kept the conversation lively. :) We're also bunking with Emma, Emmy (Sundrop), Chatham, Compte (his real name, not a trail name), Colt, Sloth, and Diana.
The thunderstorms rolled in a few minutes ago (7pm) and then hail. The ground is sprinkled with white hailstones. In March! Wow! So glad we stayed even though we didn't make many miles.","Springer Mt shelter
",Stover Creek shelter,"Mar 25, Mon",2.60
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609145,"March 26 (Day 3): We slept in the Stover Creek Shelter and there were some real snorers! David did not have a good night again. I'm really worried about him. He said his lungs hurt. We may need to leave the trail and find a doctor.
David had a couple of his butterrum Lifesavers left and set them on the shelf near where we were sleeping. I found them on the ground the next morning. Somewhere nearby is a very sugared up mouse!
The fog this morning was unbelievable! It was milky white and visibility was really low.
We didn't get up and moving until about 8. I packed up while he made breakfast. First thing he made was a cup of Folger's instant coffee. He said it was the best tasting coffee he'd had. Being a coffee snob, that was a shock to hear.  :) He also made a combination of plain oatmeal and maple sugar oatmeal. I finally had an appetite today for the first time since we left. I had oatmeal and made up a snack bag of my strawberry Instant Breakfast w/ powdered milk. That tasted awesome!! David is feeling better. Must have been the coffee.
We said our goodbyes and finally headed out about 11:45am. We are only going to the Hawk Mountain Shelter (5.3 miles) so it shouldn't take long. It is supposed to rain again so we want to make sure we get to the shelter in time to grab a spot. After today we are supposed to have nice weather with sun. Yay! Not supposed to have more rain until Sunday. That will give us time to get to the Mountain Crossing resupply store to get a repair kit for the rain tarp.
After leaving Stover Creek we had to cross over a number of cool bridges. Some were planks, but the first one out was just a really long log. It was a little slick because of the rain but fun to cross.
Farther along we came to a path with a sign to Long Creek Falls. They were beautiful! It would have been a nice place to stop for lunch but it was really wet.
On the walk we met Lexie and Fireweed. They were sitting by the creek soaking their feet. Fireweed did a thru-hike in 2012 and said that she washes her feet every day! Keeping your feet clean is very important she said. 
We got to the shelter and met a nice lady and a father/son team. The lady, Renee, retired last year after 26 years on the police force. She also served 2 tours in Iraq. When the guys heard that they said “Oh there's your trail name - Police”. She said “No, no. I want a name that's nice and cuddly so people aren't afraid of me.” So her trail name became Cuddles. She had a sweatshirt on that said ""Just another half mile or so"". Love it!
Lexie and Fireweed strolled in later. Fireweed is big on hammock camping. She has 7 tents! The one she has with her is called a Hummingbird. She gave a Hammock 101 class. She set her hammock up in 2 minutes! It was really neat. I might like to try hammocking.
Fireweed also gives talks on hiking the AT. I told her that I had read alot about getting your “hiker's legs” but I had never heard anything about hiker's lungs. I told her that it worries me how much I suck wind hiking uphill. She said week 3, about 100 miles, you will be amazed how “hiker tough” you become. Hiking uphill will become much easier. I look forward to that!
We have a full shelter tonight because of the rain. A lot of folks are still camping out. The rain just seems relentless. It's also gotten really cold. Tyler gave us a prepackaged backpacker's dinner of red beans and rice. David cooked that up for dinner. It was fabulous!! It tasted gourmet to us! We went to bed about 7:30.
About 8 pm or so a hiker we had met hiking to the Southern Terminus our first day, came into camp. His name is Phil and he is recovering from a stroke and is doing a thru-hike! What an inspiring guy. He set his tent up in the rain and slept in it.
Another hiker, Ephraim, who hails from Israel, came in later. The shelter was packy with hikers but he just threw his stuff on the floor and slept there.
Before falling asleep we could hear helicopters overhead and, at one point, machine gun fire. The Army Rangers were training nearby. They are supposed to stay off the trail and away from the shelter. One of the hikers said that they were told that if they ran into a Ranger they were to ignore them and not ask questions or start a conversation. Like I'm going to force a conversation on a person holding a machine gun!","Stover Creek shelter

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609235,"March 27 (Day 4): Today was cold, cold, cold and the wind just cut right through you. Someone said the temp was in the low 30s. The rain finally stopped during the night. The sunrise was beautiful.
David made breakfast while I packed us up. I had hot tea to warm me up. We improved our time and got on the trail by 9:50.
There was alot of elevation change today. Some of it pretty brutal, but we know that NC/Tennessee hike is going to be really tough. So far we have have only hiked as high as 3782’ (Springer Mt). The NC/Tennessee hike will go up in the high 6000’s. As Scarlett O'Hara would say ”I'll worry about that tomorrow.”
The weather turned out beautiful. Sunshine! I was able to shed my fleece jacket and puffy jacket.
We came down the side of Cooper Gap and saw several hikers in the gravel parking lot. Cuddles had slipped on her way down the mountain and fell back and tried to catch herself on her right hand and when she took her pack off at the bottom she was in terrible pain. Thank God that Amy was nearby. She stabilized Cuddles right arm. She said it looked like a rotator cuff injury because Cuddles couldn't lift her arm. Cuddles had some phone numbers of friends so she called them and they were on their way. We got her situated on a seat cushion with food and water. Another hiker, Paul, said he was going stay with her and ride into town because he needed to go into town anyways. Poor Cuddles broke down and cried for a bit. She had been training for this hike since November and was so upset that she had gotten hurt 3 days in. We told her that it could just be a strain and a few days off trail to rest could be all she needed. We said we would see her on Katahdin! I also gave her our phone number and told her to call us when she got to Waynesboro and we would come get her. We would lhave a soft bed, shower, and washing machine waiting for her. She thanked us and told us to get back on the trail.
We took off and continued on. I said a prayer for Cuddles.
We stopped for a quick lunch of crackers, peant butter, and a Snickers bar about 12:30.
We came to a fairly wide stream and decided to follow Fireweed's advice and soaked and washed our feet. That ice water felt so good!!
We finally got to Gooch shelter about 5pm. It's always great to walk into a campsite or shelter. Everyone says hello and congratulates you for making it. We set up camp and then went up to the shelter to cook dinner and chat with everyone. The conversations are always fun and entertaining.
Well it's 8pm. Way past “hiker midnight” time. Time to get some sleep. Tomorrow is an 8.3 mile day. Then Friday is Blood Mountain.","Hawk mountain

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609236,"March 28 (Day 5): We were able to camp in our tent last night and that was nice. We shared a tent site with Moe, who is also a thru-hiker. I slept fairly well, but sometimes David and Moe would start snoring in stero.
I've noticed that we definitely have the hiker funk now. Good thing I like myself or I wouldn't be able to stand the smell! :)
Each day we are getting better with our time. We got up at 7:30 and were hiking out by 9:13. The hike today was fairly level a good chunk of the time. Hiking up to Preacher's Rock was tough but the view was incredible. You could see mountain ridges for miles.
We experienced more Trail Magic today. Came down into a parking area of the Chestatee Wildlife area and a couple was there with bottled water and Twinkies and Hostess cupcakes. A steak dinner couldn't have tasted better! We wolfed it down like we were starving. There was also a privy (no TP unfortunately) and trash cans! It was great to finally be able to throw away all the trash we have been packing.
We leap frogged with Amy, Nash and Lexie all day. We all ended up at Lance Creek campsite. There aren't many sites here and alot of hikers ended up setting up their tent on the trail. We were lucky enough to find a flat spot in the campsite. There is no privy so we had to dig our first cathole. We also had to hang all food and anything with a scent up on the bear wires. No bear boxes here.
After setting up our tent, we went down to the stream and soaked our feet. I also “iced down” my knees. Boy, that felt good.
Since this is a dry campsite we had a dry dinner - tuna fish in flour tortillas and water to drink. We took our dinner up to the upper campsite, where Lexie and Amy are staying and sat and ate. More and more hikers joined us and we had a great time.
The campsite is not dry. There is a great stream, but back at the parking lot a Ridge Runner said to pass the word that the water at Lance Creek was questionable because several people had gotten sick after drinking it. We made sure to water up before getting here.
Once the sun goes down it gets really cool but tonight is only supposed to go down into the 40s. Yay.
Got a text from from Cuddles and she had a rotator tear. She got 2 cortisone shots and was told to take 2 days rest and then she could slack pack (where you carry only what you would need for a day trip.)
Time to hit the sack. Tomorrow is the climb over Blood Mountain and it's mostly a straight up climb but down the other side is Neels Gap and resupply. Amy asked if we wanted to share a cabin with her, Lexie, and Katie (who is from Luxombourg). We had been talking about asking them the same thing so we jumped at it. Can't wait! A bed, a shower, and washing machine. I also hope to get cell service so I can upload my journals.","Lance Creek campsite

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609237,"March 29 (Day 6): We improved our leaving time today and got onto the trail at 8:47. The hike wasn't as bad as we thought, alot like Springer. We watered up at Jerrod because we were worried about the water at Lance Creek. The water at Jerrod was great. Someone had put a PVC pipe there to funnel the water and give good water pressure. We cameled up and then filled an extra bag of water since there wouldn't be any water sources until Neels Gap.
Used my GoGirl for the first time on the trail. It worked great. You'll have to look up what that is if you don't know. ;)
It took us about 4 hours to get to the top of Blood Mountain. At the top was a beautiful stone shelter. We were told it was a really cold place to stay which probably explains why someone had set their tent up inside the shelter. We also learned later that the shelter used to have shutters on the windows but someone took them off and burned them because they were cold. Now the wind blows through it and makes it colder.
The views were beautiful! We stayed and had lunch for ½ hour (tuna and tortillas) and then started down. At least the first ⅓ of the hike was giant rocks to scale down. Thank goodness it was dry. I can't imagine hiking down in the rain.
We have developed a pattern in our hiking. David leads going uphill because he is faster. I lead going downhill and on the level because I am faster. It works out well.
On our way down we met another Trail Angel. Her name was Melody. She asked if we were thru-hiking and we told her yes. She told us to wait because she had trail magic for us. She gave us each a can of Mountain Dew, an orange, and some Snickers bars. We took her picture and she asked to take ours so she could prove to her co-workers that she had done trail magic on her day off.
We continued down Blood and got to Neels Gap about 3:30pm. There is a outfitters there called Mountain Crossing and it is built literally right on the trail. The white blaze mark (that denotes the AT trail) is painted in the middle of the building. They carry all kinds of resupply stuff and anything to get you on the trail. They will also do a shakedown on your pack if you want. David had them shake his down and give him some tips on adjusting his pack to carry better.) Lexie was already there. There were physical therapy students offering massages for a donation for a trip they were planning. We planned to get one but time got away from us. Amy came up the stairs and said she had a cabin at Blood Mountain Cabins and if we wanted laundry done they would wash it for you for free but we had to get it to them by 5. It was about 4:25 so we had to hurry and shop and get to the cabin (named Raccoon) before 5. We had to walk along the road for a couple minutes and then there was a path to the cabins. They washed and dried our clothes in 2 hours. They smell so good! We all took showers and then cooked up the frozen pizzas we had both at the store. 
After eating, David and I patched up the rain tarp with the repair kit we had also purchased. Then we sat around and relaxed and laughed with Amy, Lexie, Katie, and Sarah. It was great. We love our tramily (trail family)!
We hit the bed about 9. Oh the soft sheets and cushy mattress….","Lance Creek campsite
",Neels Gap,"Mar 29, Fri",7.30
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609240,"March 30 ( Day 7): We stayed overnight at the Blood Mountain Cabins and it was wonderful! The cabin was kind of cold early in the morning but that was because we forgot to turn the heat on. When we did, we all woke up to a toasty cabin.
We got dress and walked to the main cabin where there is a little store and they cook breakfast. We ordered coffee, hot tea, and 2 sausage and egg biscuits. Delicious!
Diesel (Amy), Sarah, and Katie have decided to take a zero day. Lexie is going to hit the trail with us. After saying our goodbyes and promising to catch back up down the trail, we headed back in to the Mountain Crossing store to return their cloth shopping bag and go through the building to get back on the trail. When you shop, they have cloth bags to put your stuff in. Since most of the shoppers are hikers and will need to unload their pack and repack, they tell you to take the bag and just return it when you get back on the trail.
One note about hiker's hello and goodbyes. You never shake hands or hug. We know we are dirty and probably smelly. Also it's a good way to pass on germs. So hiker ettiquette is to fist bump.
Just before you go through the passageway of Mountain Crossing, there is a giant tree. Hanging from the branches are hundreds and hundreds of hiking boots and shoes. The tree is called the Tree of Souls.
We started out on the trail, and what seems to be the norm every day, we were going uphill. Of course!
We hiked up and then down. Then hiked up Cowrock Mountain. That was a killer. Stopped for a break and drank a bottle of Gatorade that we had purchased at Neels Gap. I was surprised how hydrated I felt when we started hiking again. We will definitely be getting more of that at the next resupply.
We met Lexie taking a break along the trail and she proudly showed us the necklace she had purchased at the store at the cabins. It was made with a small smooth rock that someone had then hand painted on a beautiful sun and then sealed with a shiny sealant. It hung from a leather “chain”. I said “We should call you Sunshine!” She grinned and said she really liked that. She really is like sunshine because we always look forward to seeing her toi, just like the sun. I gave out my first trail name!
On the other side of Cowrock Mountain we came down into Tesnatee Gap and there was a huge spread of trail magic set up by several folks that had hiked the AT in 2017. The dad (Papa G) hiked to Hot Springs and then got off. His daughter (Antenna) and her husband (Thunder Buns) thru-hiked. They had all kinds of food and drinks, but they also had miscellaneous stuff that hikers use and run out of like the small tubes of toothpaste, mineral supplements, mini packs of sweetner or catsup. They thought of everything. I had 2 cowtails candy and grabbed some Jolly Ranchers. (I had just mentioned to David earlier that we should get some of them at the next resupply because they could help keep you from getting dry mouth.)
They also had a hardcover journal of AT hikers and their stories for 2017. We saw Amtrak, a lady that we had met on the AT when we were day hiking near Humpback Rocks that year! So this book is created by a guy named Odie who lives out of his van and cruises up and down the AT each year. They say he is a legend on the AT. You send him your picture on the trail and then when you get to Katahdin and he puts together a book of all the hikers that year. We are definitely doing that!!
Ugh! Leaving the trail magic stop had us going straight up another mountain. Not sure of the name but thankfully it had a lot more switchbacks than a lot of the previous ones. Those make a mountain hike much more bearable. I have to say too that I wasn't sucking wind as badly either.
Down the other side put us at Hogpen Gap. We were able to find a small stream. It was wasn't fast flowing or deep but by using a cup we could scoop out water without stirring up the silt. It helps keep our water filter from getting clogged too badly.
The trail led us over a highway and up a slight rise. We decided to cowboy camp for the night. Wasn't sure if we had another 5 miles in us at that point. And it was 4pm and a rainstorm was due in that night.
We got camp set up and found trees for our bear bags. We have designated Sunshine as the master tree finder. Her tree was perfect. The branch was about 20 feet up and 10 feet out. She had never hung a bag before and we all had some good laughs watching her try to throw her rock bag overhand up over a 20 foot high branch. We showed her how to pendulum swing it back and forth and then fling it.
We got the bear ropes set, had some dinner, hung our food bags, and planned tomorrow's hike. Then we hunkered down and waited for the storm.","Neels Gap

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609552,"March 31 (Day 8): OMG! Where do I even start? Our campsite companion, Sunshine, said it was 60 degrees last night when we went to bed. We were really warm. Sunshine came over and we sat in our tent and chatted and laughed. It was really fun. Sunshine went back to her tent.
At our campsite there was a father and son there before we got there and they had already set up camp. So there was just the 4 of us at this campsite. Unfortunately it was about .2 of a mile from the highway and the traffic was pretty noisy at times, especially the crotch rockets. The weather was nice so all the bikers seemed to be taking advantage of it.
Later that night the rain began and it poured all night and the wind was unbelievable! The tent shook like crazy. We staked it down but it still shook.
By morning the rain had stopped but it was still shaking off the trees. The wind was still blowing at 40 MPH! The temperature was in the 20s. We were cold and wet and waiting for the wind to die down a bit, but it just didn't seem to.
Suddenly we heard a man's voice ask if anyone wanted a coffee or hot chocolate. He was one of the other tenters and had waken up to part of his tent collapsed and things wet. He told his son to stay in his own tent and he would grab the shuttle and go get the car. He did that and grabbed some hot drinks to offer us. He said if we wanted a ride into town they would be glad to wait for us to pack up. David, Sunshine, and I talked about it and decided that since the winds were supposed to continue all day and then tomorrow morning's high would only be 28 we decided to take a zero day.
We packed up as quickly as possible and got into their warm truck. It felt wonderful. I was having trouble feeling my fingers and it took a while before they warmed up. We introduced ourselves to Mike and Zach. (Mike said that some hikers had seen Zach hiking in a pair of pajama pants and gave him the trail name “Party Pants”.)
As we were loading our stuff in the truck, we saw Tiger and Lifer checking their maps and getting ready to hike on. They had stayed at the Whitley shelter so they were dry and ready to go. God bless them! (We had passed the Whitley Shelter sign, but it's 1.4 miles off the trail! We didn't want to add 2.7 miles to our hike and it wouldn't even be on the AT.)
They dropped us at the Best Western in Blairsville, GA. The staff was amazing and allowed us to hang our wet stuff over the railing outside our room (#203). Housekeeping offered whatever we needed to clean our sopping wet gear. It was a little chilly in town but the wind was only 15MPH so that helped with the drying. It took about 2-½ hrs to really get things dry.
As we were leaving the hotel we saw 2 of our fellow thru-hikers (Miak and Tanja from Germany). They told us that if we didn't find any butane, we could have the partial one that they had found in the hiker gear box at Neels Gap.
After we had a good handle on our gear situation we walked around town and hit the Dollar Store first. We found our new food resupply place! We were able to get almost everything we needed except butane to cook with and some extra tent stakes. (Never did find them.) There was also an Ingles grocery store. It's like a Martin's back home. Bought a 2nd knee brace to be safe. I started wearing one on my right knee and figured I should probably protect my left one too.
We hung out at the hotel for a short time and then went to a local Mexican restaurant. It was authentic and delicious. It was one of only a few places open. They roll up the sidewalks at 2:30 on Sunday afternoons in GA. :)
They have these really deep and wide gutters that run along each side of the streets there. Probably 4” deep and 8” wide. I have been climbing up and down mountains for a week now and never fallen. I walk out of the Mexican restaurant and promptly fall out of my shoes and down onto my knees! I had a lovely black and blue bruise on my right knee by the time we got back to the hotel.
Trying to repack all the stuff we bought was tough. I have been wearing a warm, lined hat that looked like a raccoon. I borrowed it from my daughter, but I had to ditch it. Wearing it to bed was not comfortable but I have to wear a hat because of the cold. (Yes, Mackenzie, I owe you a new hat.) I've also had to ditch my book and my paper journal. Too much weight. I thought I would have time to relax and read at night but by the time you set up camp, make & eat dinner, and then hang your bear bag, you're ready to sleep!
I've noticed that the 2 times we have eaten “town food” I have woken up with the worst swollen eyes. I don't know if it's the salt or extreme change in diet or what, but I look scary! Please tell me my diet is not going to consist of oatmeal for the rest of my life or I may have to find a cliff to jump off. Still trying to get accustomed to the texture of oatmeal (or gruel as I prefer to call it).
We have found a local guy who will take us back to Hogpen Gap tomorrow at 8:45 for $25. The hotel serves a hot breakfast and the weather is supposed to be really nice for the next 4 days. Can't wait to get back on the trail!","Hogpen's Gap

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609554,"April 1 (Day 9): Best night sleep we've had since we started! Between nerves and weather and basically learning a new way of living, a solid night's sleep has evaded us. We all felt really good this morning.
We packed up and headed to the office for breakfast and checkout. (Almost forgot our trekking poles in the room!)
Jeff, the shuttle driver, took us back to Hogpen Gap. We started out and within a couple hours ran into Sarah and then Amy and Katie!
The sky was a beautiful blue, a slight wind, and some ice along the sides of the trail. There were muddy, slippery parts to the trail too at times, but for the most part the it was a pretty easy hiking day. Not too many strenuous ups and downs. Lots of level areas. Really enjoyable! Several of the trails were like long tunnels with wild rhododendronsl on either side. Their big green leaves are out but no blooms. It will be really pretty in a few weeks when the flowers bloom.
Today was our longest day in miles, 9.6 miles. We decided to stop at the Chattahoochee campsite. We watered up at a stream shortly before getting there. The wind is steady and we know that once the sun goes down it is going to be cold, so we plan to be snuggled into our sleeping bags, wearing all the clothes we have with us, by 6:30 or 7.
Hanging our bear bags was a real pain tonight. Couldn't find a strong enough tree. They would bend over when you would try to pull the bag up. Took us 45 minutes to get them up and ended up having to put one of our bags on Amy's rope. Arghh! We need to get a stronger rope.","Blairsville, GA

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609557,"April 2 (Day 10): The winds rushing through Chattahoochee Gap were 40-50 MPH. The night was long and very cold. I haven't had trouble staying warm until last night. It was as though the cold was seeping through the insulated air mattress. We “slept in” until 8:30 hoping the winds would die down. They did for the most part, but the day was supposed to be nice and yet it was cloudy and overcast. That and the slight breeze was enough to keep you cold. Diesel and Nash were long gone by 8:30. Katie left about 9. We decided to just eat a Clif bar and stop later to make a hot meal. We got going about 9:30.
Another day of up and down. The trails today were really rocky and covered with tree roots. It was slow going. The sun would come out now and then in the morning but it remained cold.
We got to the Blue Mountain shelter and decided to make lunch since it was 12:30. The shelter is really nice and had beautiful views. It seems that no matter where we hike there are mountain ridges 360 degrees around you.  It's really breathtaking. Spring is coming to Georgia. There are grasses and spring flowers popping out on either side of the trail. The trees are still pretty bare. Now and then you'll see some green leaves, like on the wild rhodedendrons.
We ate and used the privy and met some other hikers, Brooke, Mike, Wild Violet, Amy, and Michael (from Vancouver). I have to say that staying at a shelter with a privy is now a luxury to me.
When you're hiking you have lots of time to think and I'm wondering if my swollen eyes are from the Ramen noodles that we are eating at least once a day. They are really high in sodium and I rarely ever eat them. Hmm.
Something I forgot to mention in a previous post was that we ran into the person who had registered just before us at Amicolola. His name is Bob and his number is 1394. With all the folks on the trail we were pretty surprised to catch up with the person that had registered before us.
We continued down the other side of Blue Mountain and met a couple that were doing trail maintenance. They said the descent down the mountain was referred to as “mini Pennsylvania” because of all the rocks.
Part way down we got a text from Diesel and Katie that they were in Helen at the hotel. Sunshine and Sarah had joined them. They wondered what our plans were. They also said there was trail magic at Unicoi Gap. When I told David the girls said there was magic ahead he practically flew down the mountain! ;)
When we got to the gap about 3:25 there was no trail magic. David was really disappointed. He said next time don't tell him and let him be surprised. (We found out later that the magic was hamburgers and hotdogs.)
Brooke, Mike, and Amy came down shortly after. A guy parked at the gap offered us a ride into Unicoi but we decided to get another mile or so in before stopping. I texted Diesel and told her we were going on. She's going to take a zero tomorrow but we would probably see the rest on the trail.
We hiked up (of course) and finally found a spot about .1 up from a pretty stream. Today is the first day that I am really tired. I didn't really want any dinner. I just wanted to go sleep. We went to bed right after dinner. I usually journal for an hour before bed but not tonight.","Chattahoochee Gap

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609563,"April 3 (Day 11): We cowboy camped at a campsite about .5 from the summit of Rocky Mountain. The site was slanted so I rolled against the door of the tent all night but we woke up to nice weather and no wind.
One thing about getting to a summit, you see mountain ridges for as far as you can see. It's really stunning. You'll have to excuse me if I repeat myself but it really can be breathtaking at times. No pun intended because when you get to the top a lot of times your breath is gone. ;)
The day was beautiful. Blue sky and warm temps. We met up with part of our tramily (Sunshine, Sarah, and Katie) and hiked with them until Trey Mountain shelter. We decided to go past Trey Mountain shelter because we were feeling good and there was still time to put in a few more miles.
We hiked a total of 6.9 miles and ended up at a nice campsite with 6 other hikers. The only problem was the water source was .5 mile downhill. My right foot has been a little painful so I wanted to soak it. (And the bruise on my knee is almost gone!) We set up camp and then hiked down to fill our platypuses (water bags) and I soaked my feet until they were numb. Then we had to hike back up the hill. I say that adds another mile for the day!
That's the thing about hiking the AT. The trail is 2,191 miles but it doesn't include all the miles you put in hiking to water sources and shelters and campsites and into town. I bet by the end you have hiked at least another 300-400 miles.
The temperature at bedtime was just a little cool so I only slept in 2 layers and David in 3 (I am a warm sleeper while he is cold.) I didn't have to put my hat on until early morning either. First time!
I usually keep a hat or buff on all the time because I have constant hathead. My hair is literally flat to my head and all swirled around. Ask me if I care. :) I think I am going to have Mackenzie shave my head when I get to Waynesboro because I am tired of messing with it.",".5 miles from Rocky Mtn summit

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609918,"April 4 (Day 12): We slept warmer than we have this trip. We woke at 6:40am and we were on the trail by 8:21 (a new record). We said goodbye to a fellow hiker we had met last night named Irish (his last name is Irish and he left for his thru-hike on St. Patrick's Day). There was also another married couple there, but they were doing a section hike. (We would ended up leap frogging with them all day).
The first mountain we went up I asked David the name of the mountain. He said he didn't know but from here on he would name tough mountains “Bitch Mountain” if he didn't know the name. I suspect there are going to be a lot of those mountains between here and Maine. :)
The next mountain (Kelly Knob) went straight up, no switchbacks. It was over 3800 feet, so you can imagine how hard that was to walk straight up with 30 pounds on your back. 
The walk down the other side was fairly nice. Lots of level areas, but it seemed to go on FOREVER.
We finally came down to Dick's Creek Gap. Down the road .56 miles is the Top of Georgia hostel. We decide to spend the night since another bad storm was due in. We were lucky enough to be able to snag 2 bunks before they were full. They're pretty strict on rules. All packs, poles and boots were to stay outside while you registered. The. You could take your pack into the bunkhouse but boots and pokes stayed out. It made for a clean place so that was nice. We were put in the Yolala cabin with 18 other hikers. I think we got the party cabin because we had some lively folks and they were a lot of fun. One hiker, named Boorah, had a mini disco ball that he could hook into his charger. He said he found it at a dollar store. So we had disco lights playing in the common area! David bought a pizza at the little store and we baked it in the kitchen area. They also gave you a scrub set so you could take a shower and have all your clothes washed, if you wanted.
I think they bunked all the old codgers in the same room. I was in with David and 4 other guys. David and I had top bunks. Boy, could those guys snore! When the guy below me would start, I would roll over in my sleeping bag and it would jiggle the bed enough to make him stop. It was a nice warm sleep.","Campsite

It was pouring rain, but we had our rain gear on (rain coat, rain skirt that ties around the waist and hangs below the knees, and rain cover over backpack) so we were good to go. 
We headed to Plumorchard shelter in the hopes of meeting up with Sunshine and Katie. We had only been there a short while and were having a great conversation with Dayglo and Trail Daddy when Katie came rushing up. She said she had literally been running to catch up with us because they were afraid we would move on because there was still so much time left in the day. Sunshine had stopped at Top of Georgia to pick up a pkg she had mailed there and was coming. We found out that they had been standing in the office when they called the 9sm shuttle and we were out in tbe parking lot getting into the shuttle! We JUST missed each other!
We ate lunch at Plumorchard, Sunshine showed up and then we took off for Bly Gap. Katie said that she had gotten her trail name from Sarah. Her name is Pebbles. She got it because she had forgotten to remove the rocks ftom her bear bag and had carried them down the mountain and into town! And Sunshine had her name changed to Funshine. So that's what they will be referred to from here on. Sarah was named T-REX because she eats oatmeal with dinosaur eggs and is always talking about dinosaurs.
The hike wasn't too bad and there by a little stream in the middle of the the trail was a tree with a wooden sign nailed to it that said “GA/NC”. We took pictures and then headed on to Bly, which wasn't much farther.
We hit the water source first and then had to hike up some steps to the campsite. We set up camp, watered up, and had dinner. Dayglo and Trail Daddy were there with a bunch of their tramily. They built a campfire but we were too tired to join in. It was a 9 mile day for us. Even more for Pebbles and Funshine.","Top of Georgia hostel (Dick's Creek Gap)

Last night we had dinner and went to bed and then about 3:30am I threw up. I continued throwing up until morning. I also ruined a pair of pants. I was not doing well. I got up early morning and there was a group of hikers outside our tent asking if there was anything they could do for me. One offered to go get more water. Another gave me an electrolyte tablet. All kinds of offers. These AT hikers are really a protective bunch.
My wonderful tramily said that we would take a zero day so I could recuperate and they could dry out their tent and equipment. (Pebbles and Funshine had camped in the rain the night before so their tent and rain tarps were soaked.)
The day was nice, warm temps and blue sky. I slept all day. About late morning Funshine said that she was not feeling well. Next thing we know she is throwing up.
By late that night David was sick too. He got up in the middle of the night and made the comment “The only thing that could make this worse is for it to start raining.” Be careful what you wish for… Several hours later the rain began pouring down.","Bly Gap

Funshine threw up during the night but was feeling better part way through the day. David was nauseous and weak and suffered a little diarrhea. Pebbles began throwing up early morning and kept on during the day. We reminded her to drink water but at times she was throwing that up too. I made her a cup of tea but she couldn't keep it down. She and David both slept in naps all day.
The day is warm and we could see blue sky with some white clouds.
The Bly Gap campsite is right on the trail. You walk through the trail to continue on. Laying in our tents resting we could hear hikers pass by. I could hear Funshine in her tent whispering “Save yourselves!” It made me laugh.
As the day went on we could see dark clouds move in but then they seemed to move on. We could hear thunder in the distance but it kept on moving. Yay! Maybe a rainfree night?? Could we be that lucky?

Pebbles was feeling weak but a little better. David was feeling sluggish, as he put it. But we all wanted to get the hell out of Bly Gap! We ate breakfast because David hadn't eaten since yesterday and really needed something in his stomach. Pebbles nibbled on half a tortilla shell and Funshine ate her granola. We packed up and started off.
We knew the way out was up (is there any other direction??) and we had seen the log steps, but when we got up the first 10 or so and turned the “corner” in the trail, it was log steps all the way up the mountain! I don't know who installed the steps but some of the steps came to my knees! I really had to climb up to get up those steps. Thank God for trekking poles!
It was a tough climb and for 4 people trying to recuperate from a bad stomach virus, it was really tough! Even recuperating from norovirus, Pebbles could still out hike us. The woman is a hiking machine! :)
We hiked to Muskrat Creek shelter, about 4.4 miles, and met up with Diesel and Nash. It was about 12:30. We were so happy to have our tramily back together!!!
Each shelter has a carved wooden sign outside it telling you the name of the shelter. The carved sign outside the Muskrat Creek shelter said “SHEETER”. 
The prediction was for rain during the day and then then thunderstorms that night. Having been sick we wanted to make sure we got a space in the shelter. The shelters in GA had at least 2 floors. We even came across a 2 floored one. In NC the shelters are only 1 floor so space is limited. We knew that the virus we had was highly contagious so we told the 2 guys in the shelter that we had been sick but we really needed to be in the shelter because of the bad weather coming. One guy ended up packing up and leaving. That gave us the 4 slots we needed but also left us feeling bad that we drove him away.
The other guy turned out to be Laptop, the guy on Blood Mtn carrying the 80-pound pack! When he booked past us on the trail I made the comment that he looked familiar but I couldn't place him. After Blood Mtn, he had gone into Neels Gap and sent home 50-pounds of stuff. He was flying now!
The rain started within 30 minutes after we got there and continued off and on throughout the day. But when it would rain, it would pour down in sheets!
Three women came into the and one of them had problems with her tent and everything was soaked. She hoped to stay in the shelter. We were honest again (about being sick) and the three of them decided to brave the rain and stay in their tents. I was sitting at the picnic table and one of the ladies was sitting next to me. We we're discussing being sick and she turned her back to me. I said “Gee, I feel like a leper.” I understood her fear of getting sick, but that just seemed really rude.
As the rain continued, more and more people began coming into the shelter looking for a dry place for the night. By evening, with the rain and thunder, no one seemed to care about getting sick. They just wanted to be dry.
More great conversation and met a new hiker named Redline. Maik and Tanja showed up too. Hadn't seen them since Blairsville.
By bedtime we had 11 hikers jammed into a 6-man shelter. One slept on the picnic table and 4 took the dirt floor. Six of us were on the wood floor of the shelter. Everyone was settling down to sleep by 8:30.

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610612,"April 9 (Day 17): We woke up to fog and puddles and mud, but the rain had stopped. More bad weather was due in, however. There were 2 people in the shelter that snored loud and hard enough to wake the dead! If they hadn't been there it would have been a pretty quiet night but boy oh boy, not much sleep was had by the rest of us.
The day before, Diesel mentioned that when she was climbing up to Muskrat, she had stepped wrong between 2 rocks and now the top of her right foot was giving her pain and when she stepped on it to climb it was really painful. We knew exactly where it had happened. I bet those rocks had caused other hikers problems too.
David, Funshine, and Pebbles were packed up and ready to go and Diesel had just gotten to the shelter to make her breakfast, so I told them to go on and I would hike with her and Nash.
After they ate, we started out, but went slowly. She was worried that she might have a stress fracture and that would end her hike. The night before we decided to get a shuttle into Franklin.
We all met at Deep Gap and took shuttles into Franklin (NC). Shuttles are basically folks that have started a business shuttling hikers back and forth into town from locations on the trail. Some charge fair prices and some don't. Usually $10/ person is the going rate.
Diesel had booked us a room at a place called the Sapphire Inn. The place was old and kind of sketchy looking. David wanted to move but since we were there and we would have to pay for another shuttle somewhere else, we just stayed. In the end, it worked out for the best.
Funshine, Pebbles, David, and I took the MTA (Macon Transit Authority) to Walmart to resupply. It only cost $1.00 each. We did our shopping and then headed back to the motel. While we were gone, Diesel had walked up to the urgent care clinic and had her foot checked. It wasn't a stress fracture but the dr told her to take at least 2 days and rest it or it could become one. 
When we got back to the motel, I went in and took a shot. For the last 3 days I could feel welts on my behind and at night they would itch unbearably, but if I scratched them it burned. After my shower David insisted we go to the urgent Care clinic and get them checked out. So off we hiked, passing Diesel, who was just coming back from there. It didn't close till 7 and we got there a little after 6. The Dr saw me and said that the welts were bug bites and they had become infected. He called in 3 prescriptions to the Bi-Low Grocery and Pharmacy. The pharmacy closed at 8pm. We needed to walk fast. The Dr gave us directions and we walked and walked but still did not see the store. David finally stopped by a pizza place and the owner came out to point down the road to where the store was. Then he went back into his store, grabbed his car keys and said “Come on. I'll give you a ride.” He offered to wait till we got the Rxs and give us a ride back to the motel. Unfortunately, the pharmacy had just gotten my orders and there was one ahead of me so it would be ½ hour. David went out and told Mr. Lomonaco thanks but it would be ½ hour. Mr. Lomonaco had given us his business card earlier so told us to just give him a call when we were ready and he would come back and pick us up. Angels are everywhere!
We got our ride back to the hotel and then ran across the street to McDonald's for a bite. The tramily had done laundry at the motel so we had clean clothes. I told the tramily about the meds I had to take (2 oral and 1 ointment) and needless to say, I rejected the trail name “Buttpaste”. :) 
It was 9pm and we were exhausted. We hiked 4 miles on the AT and goodness knows how many in town.","Muskrat Creek shelter

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610613,"April 10 (Day 18): Today was a perfect day!! We woke up at 6:30am in the sleazy hotel (Sapphire Inn). Boy was it foggy out. We needed to be out at hotel office by 7:15 to catch the van from First Baptist Church in Franklin. They drove us and a group of other hikers to their church and warmly welcomed us into their community hall. There they served us all-we-could-eat giant pancakes, bacon, fruit, and coffee cake. Orange juice, coffee, tea, and hot chocolate to drink. They took our picture and gave us a note card to write home. They printed out our picture, we put it with our addressed envelope and they covered mailing. Pebbles is from Luxombourg and they told her they would mail hers too. They mailed letters all over the world. We ate to bursting, they said a prayer over us for safe travels, and then they gave us a ride back to our hotel. It was awesome! Talk about trail magic!
We got back to the hotel and packed up, except for Diesel. She was going to call the Microtel Inn and move there. We did not want her staying at this sketchy place alone even with Nash. 
We had called Three Eagles, a nearby outfitter and resupply place to find out when they opened and they were open now and they came and picked us up!
We bought some additional tent stakes, Germ-X, and neoprene gloves (for the Smokey Mtns). They gave us a free t-shirts for spending $100.
Mary, our favorite shuttle driver, picked us up at Three Eagles and took us back to Deep Gap. By 12:30 we were back on the trail.
The climb was gentle with lots of switchbacks. Spring is definitely coming with the beautiful little yellow flowers and purple flowers that line the trail.
And speaking of the trail, the trails so far in NC, have been beautiful. Well maintained and the blazes look newly painted and are frequent. No guessing if you are on the AT.
After reaching the summit, the downhill trek was even more wonderful! We went through an area of trees that were probably no higher than 10-12 ft tall, but they were bent over and gnarly. It was almost spooky looking, even in the day. I thought it would be the perfect place to hold a Halloween event. (Found out late that the are wild rhodedendrons.)
Some of the trail was muddy. All of it was rocky with tons of tree roots to navigate. We rock-hopped over lots of streams. Sometimes the stream was the trail!
We got to Beech Gap campsite and decided to press on a little farther because the day was beautiful. We found Coleman campsite and had it all to ourselves. We did 7.0 miles today. We made dinner and tried very hard to get a campfire going but the wood and leaves we're too wet, so we just sat on the logs around the fire pit and talked. Having Diesel and Nash there would have made it complete. 
The little flying bugs or gnats were annoying so I pulled out my sun hat which has a net rolled up in the crown. I unrolled it and immediately felt like a beekeeper, but I was bug-free! Then I tried to eat a peanut M&M (Yes! Some things are worth the extra weight!) and got a mouth full of netting.
As I walked along the trail today I thought how I wished I could film all this beauty and send it to all my family and friends. Pictures or words seem so inadequate in trying to describe it all. You just have to see it. One of my goals for this trip was to learn to live in the moment. See and enjoy what was happening right now and not be planning what I needed to do next. Today I did that.

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610900,"April 11 (Day 19): We started the day at Coleman Gap. Woke up to a dewy tent and dense fog. Walked across a good number of streams as we hiked toward our destination of Albert Mountain, the 100 mile mark for NoBo thru-hikers.
Albert Mtn is known for having a “rock scramble “ that you have to go through to the top. I guess our idea of a rock scramble is different. We were able to climb it with our poles. (When we’ve hiked in Maine, the rock scrambles required you to have to use both hands and feet to climb up. Poles wouldn’t help.)
Once past the rocks, the summit wasn’t very far. There was a tall fire tower there that gave amazing views for miles and, yes!, even with my fear of heights, I climbed that tower! I just hiked 100 miles! No fear of heights was going to stop me now!
The hike down was very nice. As we walked I noticed that the trail literally glittered. It’s due to the mica in the rock. NC is the nation’s leading producer of this mineral.
We got to the next shelter, called the Long branch. Rain was due in that night and the tent sites were all downhill. I didn’t want to camp where the water would be running into my tent all night, so we pressed on to the next gap. So far we have been fortunate to find campsites at the gaps. (Is you’ve heard of the old tv show “Gunsmoke”, I thought it would have been funny if we had stayed at that shelter. Miss Kitty staying at the Long Branch.)
We stopped at Glassmine Gap and found our first gap with really no flat sites. There was Funshine, Pebbles, David and I, and 2 other section hikers named Jack and Cap’n. It took a while to find enough spaces and we ended up sleeping with part of our tent on the trail.
We did 11 miles today, so that was good. We’re starting to pick up the pace a bit now that we’re healthy and feeling good.","Coleman Gap

It was quite the challenge to try to pack up the tent and keep it as dry as we could. We decided we would hike to the next shelter (Rock Gap) to make breakfast. It was 2.6 miles. The trail was not much more than thick, sucking mud and even a steam of running water at times. We tried to dry out the rain tarp in the shelter, but the air was just too full of moisture.
Diesel was returning to the trail today! Yay! We met her at Winding Stair Gap. She brought us all trail magic! Arby’s! There was a guy there with a decked out conversion van and he offered chairs to sit on and something to drink.
Diesel, Pebbles, and Funshine had been waiting quite a while for us so we told them to go on and we would meet them at the next shelter after we enjoyed our lunch.
The rest of the hike was not too bad. We got into Silar Bald shelter about 4:30. It’s a really nice shelter with large grassy areas. Someone had tarred 2 of the sides so it was really protected. They say the shelter is .6 miles in, but it sure seemed longer. We set up down from the shelter and David went to soak his feet in the stream. I went up to the shelter and chatted with the girls.

We left our packs and hiked up to the top. The view was 360 degrees and stunning! Mountain ridges as far as you could see! A Bald is an interesting thing. It had no trees or tall bushes on it. Just beautiful grasses and some flowers. It was really a serene thing to experience.
The hiking was tough with some killer climbs. On the descent we would walk through masses of spring flowers with them up the mountain to your right and down the mountain to your left. It was just beautiful. We also got to hike through lots of streams.
We finally made it to the Wayah Bald Tower. It was made of stone and beautifully done. You could walk up and see for miles. The AT blaze is actually painted on the tower!
There was a group there preparing for a wedding. It was very simple but beautiful. The bride and bridesmaids and flower girls were up in the top of the tower. We just snuck up and took some pictures and then disappeared. They had a barrel decorated with flowers and covered with cupcakes. Boy, they looked good! I thought about saying ""Oh, trail magic! How nice of you!"" But I behaved myself. :)
The trail continued on the other side of the tower. We got down to the Wayah Bald shelter and set up camp. The tramily was already there and setup in the shelter. Diesel has noro! She had just finished setting up her hammock when she threw up. It just got worse from there. Poor girl! Been there, done that.
Went to the shelter and the girls were saying that we are famous. Talk was up and down the trail about the group with norovirus at Bly Gap. Gee!

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610908,"April 14 (Day 22): I had worried about hiking on and leaving Diesel at Wayah Bald sick. The girls insisted that they were going to take a zero and stay with her, but I still felt guilty. Well, the good Lord took care of the decision for me. That night a storm blew in. Pouring rain and extremely high winds. We woke to the same. T-Rex stopped by our tent and said that we were the only tent there but the rain and high winds would continue so hunkering down was probably the best thing to do. That night the weather was going to be worse with 60 MPH wind gusts and lows in the 30's. Then tomorrow was supposed to be nice.
Both our phones were low on charge. My iPod was dead, so no music or audio books. We just dozed and slept all day. It was too stormy to even get out of the tent to go up to the shelter and talk. (I had gone to the privy in the early morning and my clothes and raincoat were soaked.)
There was a break in the storm for about 2 hours (sun!) and David made us something to eat. But it was late in the afternoon, too late to pack up and get anywhere dryer, so we stayed put. (We found out later that 2 of the hikers that had packed up and left had realized that they were getting close to hyperthermia. They stopped at the next shelter (Cold Spring) and stayed there. They said the temp in the shelter was 32 degrees.)","Wayah Bald Shelter

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610910,"April 15 (Day 23): Today was definitely an interesting day. After tornado winds and pelting rain all night, we woke up to frozen temps. The water bottles we had left out were filled with ice. The rain tarp over the tent was coated in ice. Even our tent poles were frozen and we couldn't get them to collapse. The winds were still about 40 MPH. We were told later that the temperature on Wayah Bald was 25 degrees, not count the wind chill.
We finally got the tent down and camp packed up. We decided last night to just eat a Clif bar and stop later to heat up a hot breakfast, maybe at the next shelter. Our hands were so cold we couldn't feel our fingertips. I would carry my  poles in one hand and put the other under my armpit to try and warm it.
The trail was extremely muddy. The sun finally came out about 10am, but the wind was relentless! It just froze you to the bone.
About noon, the sun won out and it began to warm up. Yay!
The folks that maintain the trails will sometimes put logs or large stones in the trail to direct water down the mountain during storms instead of it washing down the trail. Unless it has been dry for a while, the logs can be very slick. You should step over them. Am I a daredevil? Or a thrillseeker? Or an idiot? Probably the latter because I stepped on the log, my boot slid and I went down on my right knee and my knee grazed a big rock in the trail as I fell. I laid there for a minute and cried, had a small pity party and then had David help me up and we kept hiking.
 We stopped in Tellico Gap and pulled out the tent, rain tarp, footprint, and our rain gear to dry it out. I held up the tent and then tarp and the wind would blow it like a flag. I had them both dry in about 15 minutes. David laid the footprint out (it's Tyvek that serves as a moisture barrier between the tent and the ground) and let the sun do its job. In about 30 minutes our stuff was all dry.
We continued on and came to the Wesser Observation Tower. Once again I climbed to the top. It was a big flat wooden platform that gave views for miles. Someone had been wonderful enough to leave 2 chairs up there. And they looked new. We sat in the sun and enjoyed the view. Liz and Cindy joined us a few minutes later.
We continued down to Wesser Bald shelter in hopes of catching up with the girls, but they had decided to go on to A. Rufus Morgan shelter. There was no way my knee was letting me do another 5.5 miles so we camped there for the night.
T-Rex had decided not to go on with the girls either. Liz and the 2 Cindys, Lifer, Tiger, and later, Phantom, were also there. One of the Cindy's had packed this huge bag of food and it was so heavy. For dinner she had a pita bread with fresh avacado and chicken salad. We commented how delicious that looked and she gave us a baggie with a pkg of chicken and an avacado! She also gave away sandwich bags of olives to anyone who would take them. Boy, did we tease her about all the heavy food she brought. 
We did 10.6 miles today.","Wayah Bald Shelter
",Wesser Bald Shelter,"Apr 15, Mon",10.60
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610914,"April 16 (Day 24): We were up at 6:40 to get to the NOC (Nantahala Outdoor Center). During the night I woke up and my right wrist was really bothering me. I'm wondering if I hurt it too when I fell. It didn't seem to bother me when I held my poles. I was glad for that. 
From Wesser Bald shelter to NOC was only 6.9 miles and we got there about 12:30. We noticed that the trees in Nantahala had leaves and buds, but from the high elevation that we hiked down from, the trees were still just  sticks with no leaves or buds yet.
It's supposed to be a resupply for hikers but the general store there sucked. How can you claim to be a resupply place and not have toilet paper? You had a choice of only 3 different oatmeal flavors. The gear center was pretty well equipped and there were outlets everywhere so you could charge electronics and phones. There was also a hiker box (which you find in almost every hiker place you stop) and I found a single boot lace. Ta da! Instant new belt for me! Now I don't have to keep pulling my pants up every half mile. ?
I went into the Riverside restaurant and the girls were there. They had gotten there much earlier so they were just about done with lunch. They told me the food was really good. I went and got David and we had lunch with Liz and the 2 Cindys. I had the Sherpa Rice with chicken. It was delicious! David had a big burger and fries. The conversation was wonderful too. We talked about food, of course, and what healthy food we could eat on the trail that wasn't too heavy.
The NOC is right on the Nantahala River so we sat and soaked our feet in the river and watched the kayakers. There were Adarondick chairs so you could enjoy the sun. There's a bridge that crosses the river (called the Founder's Bridge) and you could stand on the bridge and watch the rapids. It also said it was on the ""Trail of Tears"". I'll have to Google that sometime. The tramily was there so it was lots of fun. David got Hostess cupcakes and ate them both.
We had planned to hike a few more miles and then stealth camp. I happened to mention it to a worker in the NOC gear store and he said that the climb up was 7 miles to the Sassafras shelter and it was a killer hike. He also said that there were no campsites because it was all uphill. I told this to David and he was bummed. We did hear of a discreet little campsite nearby. David checked it out and then told the girls where it was. There was a beautiful waterfall as we walked to the campsite. We all camped there and fell asleep listening to the river.","Wesser Bald Shelter

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610915,"April 17 (Day 25): It was a beautiful day when we woke up. Slept great, listening to the river rush by. It was wonderful.
Got back on the trail and headed up. It is 6.9 miles to the first shelter (Sassafras Gap) and everyone said it is straight up and a killer hike. We didn't think it was that bad for the first 5 miles. After that it got pretty tough. We finally made it to the shelter and we were really feeling strong, stronger than we've felt yet, so we kept going!
The climb up to Cheoah Bald was tough but the view was beautiful. We sat there for a bit enjoying the view and the cooling breeze. It's strange to be hiking along and the breeze is blowing and then it will stop and get hot and humid. And you start perspiring like crazy. Then you get up to a summit and the breeze is great and cools you down.
After that we hiked down to Locust Cove Gap and made camp. There were already several hikers set up. We found a fairly flat site (Always a challenge. One or the other of us is usually rolling down hill in the tent all night. ?). After we got the camp set, I hiked down to the stream and soaked and washed my feet. Boy that feels great after walking all day. 
We put in 10.6 miles today! Woo hoo!","Nantahala Outdoor Center
",Locust Cove Gap,"Apr 17, Wed",10.60
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611446,"April 18 (Day 26): Woke up at Locust Cove Gap and it was a nice day. A little cool but nice.
We hiked downhill to Stecoah Gap (NC 143). There was a picnic table and trash can, so we were able to throw away the trash we had been carrying.
We wanted to go into Robbinsville to resuppy and met another couple (Trevor and Rhea from Johannesburg in South Africa) who were also looking to go into town. I tried hitchhiking for the first time! I put my thumb out and the first truck that came along pulled over! My first thought was ""Are we all going to fit in the back seat?"" Then when I saw everyone loading into the bed of the truth, I realized ""Oh yeah, they don't want stinky hikers inside their truck!"" ? The 5 mile ride into town was breezy but exhilarating! Trevor made the comment that they couldn't get used to how spread out the towns and homes were. At home, everything was very close together.
We were dropped off at the Walgreens and waked across the the Ingles grocery store. As always, we bought a little too much. We wanted to have 7 meals to get us through the Smokies. While sorting through and packing, a couple came over to us to ask about hiking the AT. She said that this was her 40th birthday trip and she wanted to go along the trail and talk to people actually hiking it. We talked for several minutes and told her how great it was and life changing too. Then she asked to take our picture with her.
We loaded up and, boy, were our packs heavy! We headed out to the road and I turned to put my thumb out and a woman, named Suzie, pulled up and asked if we needed a ride back to the trail. (David said I had the magic when it came to hitchhiking.) Suzie was very nice and she asked where we were from. We told her outside of Waynesboro. She laughed and said that her daughter worked at the Ski Barn by Wintergreen! We told her we would stop by and say hi to her when we got home.
Suzie dropped us off at Stecoah Gap and we started up. Short up the trail was the betgit of Jacob's Ladder. You hike 600 feet up in .6 of a mile. That might not sound bad when you read it but it's killer when you're hiking it with loaded packs! It would have been killer without loaded packs!
We finally made it to Brown Fork Gap shelter. Really bad weather was due in that night and we wanted to stay in a shelter. We considered just getting water and hiking to the next shelter but knew there would definitely be no room by the time we got there. I told David that I would not be able to carry a wet tent tomorrow, in addition to the extra food I had.
The folks already in the shelter voluntarily squished together and fit us both in. (We ended up fitting 9 people into a 6 man shelter!) We couldn't inflate both air pads because there wasn't room, but we actually slept pretty warm that night.
We hiked 5.5 miles.","Stecoah Gap
",Brown Fork Gap,"Apr 18, Thu",5.50
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611448,"April 19 (Day 27): The bad weather began about 1am with torrential rain and thunder. It was pretty warm in the shelter, with all the bodies lined up like little sardines. We stayed dry too.
The younger group was up early and on the trail around 8. It was pouring rain. We got onto the trail about 9:30. The rain was still coming down hard. We had on our rain coats, rain skirts, and Neoprene gloves.
The trail was basically just a river. We walked along the side where possible, but most of the time we were in the water. It wasn't long before our boots were squishing with water, soaked through. I had the Velcro around my wrists closed tight but the rain still ran down my gloves and into my sleeve. It would pool at my elbows and if I lifted my arms to reach up, the water ran down my sleeve and soaked my shirt. David was soaked through too.
At one point we were crossing some large boulders. I planted my pole but when I tried to pull myself up the pole slid and I went down on my face. I'm not a screamer but this really scared me and I did scream when I hit the rock. David came rushing back and I shook  my head to clear it. I figured I would have a bruise but I was ok. We walked on and I took the lead this time. I would glance back occasionally to make sure David was there. Then I heard him grunt and turned to see his arms flailing and then him cartwheeling down the mountain! I threw down my poles and slid down the mountain after him. Luckily he only went down about 10 or 15 feet, but his pack had him pinned down and he couldn't get his arms free. I had to shift his pack and he was able to climb back up to the trail.We decided we were done for the day.
We finished hiking the 5.2 miles to the road and then tried to call a local hostel for s ride. We had no coverage so we started hitchhiking. I didn't think we would have any luck since we were soaking wet. Suddenly a blue VW station wagon pulled over and I saw Diesel's face! Diesel, Funshine, and Suzanne were going in to Robbinsville to resupply. They were staying at the Creekside Paradise Inn. There was only one more seat so David sat there and I had to cram in the back with the packs but it was dry so I didn't care. Cynthia drove us  to the Hiker Inn but it was full so she took us to the Quality Inn and we got a room there. I immediately got into a hot shower. David was next then we spent the next several hours trying to dry things. We walked across to the laundromat to wash clothes but only had change for the washer, no detergent. So the clothes were just rinsed really well. Lol.
While they were washing, we walked for to the Subway and had a sandwich with real vegetables! As we were eating it rained again. I am so done with rain right now! It was a quick rain though and I ran down and put the clothes in the dryer while David ran to the drugstore. Then back to the hotel where we crashed for the night.","Brown Fork Gap Shelter
","Robbinsville, NC","Apr 19, Fri",5.20
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611449,"April 20 (Day 28): We stayed at the Quality Inn in Robbinsville. They had a nice breakfast with make-your-own waffle, cereal, and assortt pastries and bagels. We called Cynthia at Creekside Paradise and she was bringing some hikers into town for a resupply so she would pick us up about 12:15.
She pulled in and we sat in the car and talked while the hikers (Kidney and Driftwood) shopped. She was so interesting to talk to. After the girls came out of the store, Cynthia said she would drop them off at the inn and then take us to Fontana Lodge. Funshine and Pebbles slack-packed to the Fontana Hilton shelter so she was going to pick them up there.
We drove to the Fontana Hilton shelter (It's called that because it has showers and is a really nice shelter.) and there were several tents set up with MAJOR trail magic! Hamburgers, donuts, salads, candy, you name it! It was over the top! Cynthia pulled over so we could partake in the magic. They also gave us a cool bandana that says ""Trail Hard"". It was awesome. We saw Pebbles and Funshine and they said that they had no problem waiting while Cynthia dropped us at the lodge.
The Fontana Lodge was really beautiful. It's actually a resort but alot of the things weren't open yet (pool, water area for kids, volleyball, etc.). We checked in and then saw the 2 Cindys. They were talking to a sweet older woman who introduced herself as a ""Dam Kid"". She was one of many of the children whose fathers helped build the Fontana dam. They get together for a reunion every year in October. She was a real pistol to talk to.
We eventually made our way over to the computer to print out our permits for going through the Smokies. I got mine to be print pretty easily. David's was another matter. We must have worked on it for an hour before we got it. At one point he said that he would just take the risk of not having a printed copy. (He would later be glad that he finally got it printed.)
We walked around the resort a bit and then met the 2 Cindys for dinner at the Wildwood Grill. We both ordered the vegetarian pizza. It was delicious!
We went back to our room and relaxed and watched TV.

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611450,"April 21 (Day 29): Happy Easter! We caught the 8:30am shuttle from the lodge over to Fontana Dam to begin our hike through the Smokey Mountains. The day was beautiful with dark blue skies and temps in the 60s. We took our time crossing the dam and taking pictures. Then we had to walk up the road to the entrance into the Smokies via the AT. We took a picture as we put our permits into the box, then off we went.
We came up to a split in the trail. Off to the right was a steep path up to the fire tower. We left our packs at the bottom and hiked up to the tower. We used our hiking poles and it felt so odd using them without having a pack on your back. I felt like a newborn colt struggling to stand on wobbly legs.
We got up to the fire tower. It had wooden steps and a few of the handrails were missing. The top was enclosed and the view was so amazing! Again I battled my fear of heights and climbed to the top! Yay me! 
We continued on to the Mollies Ridge Shelter. The shelter and the area was really beautiful and there was a cool breeze blowing. The shelter was stone on 3 sides and the open side had a large tarp covering it. There was also a fireplace inside! It had 2 levels and could sleep 12 people. There was a long wooden table out front with a bench. No privy but there was one side of the trail that was a ""designated privy"". What's also nice is that the trail goes right through the campsite. You don't have to walk out of the campsite to get back to the trail.
After dinner we were relaxing in our tent when I got a message from a good frit that he was in the Smokies for the three day weekend and wondered if we needed or wanted anything. I kiddingly replied ""How about some Ben & Jerry's?"" He started making plans to get it to us when I told him I was only kidding, but thanked him so much for the offer. He ended his message with ""You are a rock star."" ?
I had sent texts to family and friends wishing them a happy Easter. One dear friend responded with ""Happy Easter to each one of you dear chicks. We are so blessed to have our hardy one climbing closer to God (and having each one of us in her  heart). Thank you Kitty--for sharing it all with us..."" I am so blessed to have such special friends.

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611451,"April 22 (Day 30): Today was one of the most brutal days of hiking. We left the  Mollies Ridge Shelter and there was a large stretch of downhill and then uphill. We passed the Russell Field and Spence Field shelters then started up to Rocky Top. We passed a couple day hikers who told us we were near a beautiful view. We thought we were at the top so we stopped there for lunch and could see the fire tower that we had climbed the day before!
After lunch the climb continued up. This mountain certainly earned its name! The path was covered in rocks! Big rocks, small rocks, flat rocks, ankle-rollers! It was a killer. THEN we got to the top of Rocky Top! Downhill was more rocks!
While hiking down I kept repeating, like a mantra, what my friends had said to me ""You are a rock star."" and ""Our hardy one climbing closer to God"". It gave me encouragement when my stamina and morale was flagging. Thank you.
The last mile to the shelter was straight uphill! When I staggered into the Derrick Knob shelter, folks said that every hiker that came in looked exactly like I did. Completely drained! It took us until 7pm to get to camp.
We hiked 12.1 miles today.","Mollies Ridge Shelter
",Derrick Knob Shelter,"Apr 22, Mon",12.10
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611512,"April 23 (Day 31): Today we hike to the highest point on the whole AT - Clingmans Dome. 
We left Derrick Knob shelter about 8:15am. When we came up to the Silars Bald Shelter there was a deer standing not 20 feet from us eating grass. It didn't seem the least afraid of us. The whole trail that day was a beautiful hike.  Everywhere there were fields of flowers and the closer we got to the Dome the more beautiful. It was like a fairy land. Everything was covered in a soft, green moss. The path was soft to walk on from all the fir needles. Some of the trail consisted of walking in shallow streams. We could hear all kinds of birds. It really was a gorgeous hike and even though we were hiking up to the high point the ups were not terrible. I wouldn't mind if the rest of the AT were like the Clingmans trail.
At one point we stopped to talk with a fellow hiker and then he suddenly said ""Bear! Or boar!"" We turned to see a huge wild boar cross the trail below us. We couldn't believe how big it was!
We came off of the trail at the paved path, from the parking lot, leading up to the Dome. As we stepped onto the pavement, a mom and her 2 kids were coming up and the mom said ""Look, kids. It's the real deal!"" Then they stopped to ask us questions and have their picture taken with us. Mini celebrities! Lol!
There is a low, concrete semi circle wall just before you start up the walkway of the Dome. Sitting on the left side of the wall we're all AT hikers. They cheered as we walked up and we all congratulated each other on making it 200 miles. Yep! Clingmans Dome is the 200 mile marker! (It took us 19 days to make 100 miles and only 12 days to make 200 miles.)
The Dome is an interesting structure. It has a circular concrete path that ends in a covered dome at the top. You can see for miles if the day is clear and we had the perfect day! Funshine and Pebbles had waited for us so we could all take pictures together! So we took lots!
It was 4:35 by then and we still had 3.9 miles to go to get to the next shelter, plus the half mile walk into the shelter. The Mt Collins shelter does not have the trail going right through it. So off we went. 
Why does it seem that the last mile before a shelter is straight uphill?! We seemed to walk parallel to the road for a while and I wondered why there would be a shelter so close to the road. But we hiked and hiked and I was afraid that we had missed the sign for the shelter, until a few younger hikers went flying by and said it was just up ahead. (A lot of the hikers have an app called Guthooks. It shows the trail in detail and gives detailed information on topography, shelters, local area info, user comments, and will show you exactly where you are.) We dragged into the campsite about 7pm. It was deep in the woods and the air was humid. We ate dinner and hit the sack!
We hiked 13 miles today (13.5 if you count hiking into shelter).","Derrick Knob Shelter
",Mt Collins Shelter,"Apr 23, Tue",13
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611514,"April 24 (Day 32): Left Mt. Collins shelter at 7:50am, our earliest yet. Had to hike the half mile out to the trail. The rest of the hike was really nice. Loved walking through the moss covered forest and listening to the birds and looking at all the flowers. We had to cross a bunch of wooden bridges made from fallen logs. They were really pretty.
We came up to the parking area for the Road Prong Trail and there was trail magic! The ladies told us that to provide trail magic in the Smokies they had to be interviewed by the Forest Service and then pay for a permit! But they do it anyway, every Wednesday for 6 weeks. It was great!
We continued on the Newfound Gap and it was much more than the gaps in GA. There was a large parking lot and a large stone viewing area dedicated on the golden anniversary of the Smokey Mountains for ""excellence in conservation, restoration, and enjoyment"". We also had our picture taken at the NC/TENN border line. Another state down!
The free shuttle offered by a local church was not due until 12:30, so we had 1-1/2 hour wait. We decided to hitchhike. A nice couple on vacation offered to take us to Gatlinburg. We arrived at the NOC and got our gear out. We called for a hotel and got a nice rate at the SureStay. We gathered up our gear and realized that we had left David's hiking poles in the couple's car!! They were long gone and we had no way to track them down. We only knew they were Gwen and Kevin from San Antonio. Arghh! We felt a cross between anger and frustration.
We checked into the hotel and then walked over to the NOC to buy him new poles. We also bought a waterproof bag for our food. Putting them in Walmart bags, hanging them on the bear chains, and then hoping they'll stay dry just doesn't work.
We came back to the room and as I was sorting through dirty laundry I heard voices, familiar voices, on the balcony. I walked out and there were the 2 Cindys and Wren! We all just laughed. We couldn't believe that we got rooms right next to each other, without knowing it.
We knew we needed to do laundry and for resupply, so we all trucked down to the trolley stop and had to take 2 trolleys to get to the laundromat on the other side of town. The grocery store was a 1/4 mile from there. We walked as much today as we would have on the trail, but without all the rocks and tree roots to climb over.
We didn't get back to the hotel until 5:30. Little Cindy and I walked over to the Texas Steakhouse a while later to get take-out burgers. Then back to the hotel to relax. Finally!

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612538,"April 25 (Day 33): I've never seen Gatlinburg so we decided to take a zero here. The day was cloudy but it didn't rain. 
Before sightseeing I walked over to the NOC and left a note in case the kind couple that gave us a ride to town, saw the poles, and thought about contacting the NOC. It was worth a try. (I also said a lot of prayers.)
We walked around and checked out all the candy stores and even bought some salt water taffy. We didn't buy any souvenirs because there was no way we were adding any weight to our packs. We did decide that we needed to bring Mackenzie and Megan back here. Those 2 love to souvenir shopping!
I really wanted to go to the Ripley's Aquarium, but they wanted $35/ticket and I didn't want to spend $70 so we just continued meandering. It was nice to just walk slow without any particular destination in mind.
We shared a late lunch at Bones BBQ. Had pulled pork with coleslaw and potato salad. It was very good. Topped it off with Starbucks - coffee for David and a chai tea latte for me.
Went back to the hotel and checked the weather for the 1000th time, hoping the rain would pass us by when we hit the trail tomorrow morning.  We packed up and prepared to catch the 8:30 shuttle from NOC to Newfound Gap. A local church offered hikers rides into town and back to the trail twice a morning. 
It still shows that it's supposed to rain tomorrow. I hope we are ready. Everytime I think of the rain, I get flashbacks of our hike to Yellow Gap and the rain and wind and our scary falls. Rain, rain go away...","Gatlinburg, TN

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612540,"April 26 (Day 34): So David watched the weather like a hawk and talked me into waiting until the 11am shuttle. He said the weather kept looking better and better and we might miss the rain. So glad we did that.
We got off at Newfound Gap and were on the trail by 11:38am. The weather overhead looked cloudy but not threatening. We wore our raincoats and put our pack covers on but didn't bother with our rain skirts.
The air was misty but not enough to even get our pant legs wet. The wind was unbelievable! It blew at 30-40 MPH with gusts up to 50 MPH! We love walking along the ridges because you can see so much but today was nerve-wracking. Luckily the gust were blowing us toward the mountain and not away. At one point, however, I had to plant my poles and hunker over them until the wind gust died down because I was in danger of getting knocked over on the trail. Sometimes the trail would go below the ridge line and we would have some time that we weren't getting battered.  
We walked along a couple miles and saw the sign for the Icewater Spring Shelter. It was about 1pm. David decided to walk down and see if anyone was there. He called me and when I got there I could see smoke coming from the chimney! Inside were a few hikers, including Phoenix, one of the Ozark Spear Boys, and Banana (he had gotten off the shuttle with us and said he was freezing). We stayed for a few minutes to warm our hands and then headed out. Banana said ""Boy, are you brave!"".
We hiked along and continued to fight the wind, but then the sun started peeking out every now and then. So the hike was pretty good except for the wind gusts. We decide since the ground would still be wet from yesterday's rain, we would stay in the shelter tonight.
Eventually we made it to Peck's Corner Shelter and, boy were we surprised when we pulled back the tarp. The shelter was packed with people, including Chappy, the 2 Cindys, and T-Rex! They couldn't believe we had been out hiking ""in this weather"". At the same time we were at Icewater (at 1pm), 8 miles down the trail (where they were) they were getting battered with torrential rain and hail! Most of them were there from the day before and decided to take a zero rather than fight that weather. A few guys had staggered in from the previous shelter and we're dripping wet. They had the fire going to keep warm and dry clothes and equipment. They said they had had 20 people crammed into the shelter the night before. They couldn't believe we had not run into any of the bad weather!
The bunks were full but Chappy had put out her footprint and slept on the floor in front of the fire the night before so we took that spot. (Some folks had decided to try and brave the weather and move on so Chappy was able to get a bunk.).

It was a long day but we really moved along at the beginning. By the end of the day I was so exhausted and, of course, the last mile to the shelter was completely uphill. I dragged into the shelter in tears at 5:10pm. I so want to stop by 3:30 or 4pm each day but it hasn't worked out that way yet. In the Smokies you HAVE to stay IN or AT a shelter. No stealth camping. Eight to nine hours of hiking every day is wearing on me.
The Cosby Knob Shelter wasn't crowded at all, but we pitched our tent. Our hiker neighbor, Cindy, said to camp by her. The site was nice. It turned out to be on a slant and we slid down hill all night. ?
At the end of the day, however David calculated that we had done 36 minute miles, our best yet, and had hiked 12.9 miles.","Peck's Corner Shelter

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612543,"April 28 (Day 36): Today we started at Cosby Knob Shelter and hoped to make it to Standing Bear Hostel.
At one point during our hike an ATC member stopped us and asked if we were thru-hikers. We told him yes and he asked how the cleanliness of the shelters and the trail was. We told him we thought things looked really good. He also said that we needed to put in the box the remaining portion of out thru-hiker permit when we hit Davenport Gap. Woo hoo! We are almost out of the Smokies!
We hit Davenport Gap and put our permits in the box and said goodbye to the Great Smokey Mountains National Park.
The rest of the trail was pretty good. We had to cross a number of streams/rivers by jumping big rocks. 
One of the highlights today was a different type of lookout. We came to the sign for the Lower Mt. Cammerer Trail and kept going, downhill. We went maybe .2 miles farther and I asked David where he thought the ""lighthouse"" was. We pulled the AWOL book out and found that you had to go down the trail we had just passed! So we hiked back up and the 2 Cindys were just coming down the trail path. It was .6 down the path but they said it was worth it. So off we went and, boy, were they right!!
It's called the Mt. Cammerer Lookout not fire tower because it is built on the ground where as a fire tower is built of wood or metal and goes up into the air. The building was 8-sided and looked just like a lighthouse. You could go inside it and there was a large floor space and windows all around. It had a balcony that went all around it on the outside so you could walk 360 degrees around. It was just beautiful. We also knew of 3 fellow hikers that had spent the night in the lookout.
The rest of the hike was downhill for the most part. We came out at road and then had to walk across the Pigeon River Bridge. Then we had to walk along the road until we came to an I-40 underpass.  We turned right and started up a gravel road and then saw an AT sign. We got back on the trail and seemed to be walking parallel to the gravel road. We came back down to the gravel road again but David stopped before that and began walking along the river. He found a really nice campsite. I was concerned that someone would come along and make us move but, as David likes to say ""Better to ask forgiveness than permission"". ? So we set up camp, made dinner, and filtered water. We went to bed with the sound of the river lulling us to sleep. Found out later that we were just down the road from Standing Bear Hostel. That's ok. I think it was for the best. Word was that there was an outbreak of norovirus at Standing Bear.
We hiked 10.7 AT miles, but 12.3 (to lookout).","Cosby Knob Shelter

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612546,"April 29 (Day 37): We left the stealth camp, down from Standing Bear hostel. So glad we stopped to camp because we thought the hostel was right on the AT trail and would have continued on the trail looking for it but would not not have found it. Chappy and the 2 Cindys came walking down the gravel road from the hostel and yelled hello across the river.
Once we were packed up, the climb was straight up for 4.5 miles. It was brutal. The day was nice day but very hot. It was a lovely walk across a meadow to the top of Snowbird Bald and the view was beautiful. Both the Cindys and Chappy were there. They were just getting ready to leave. Tall Cindy had not been feeling well since last night. Oh no, noro! We agreed to meet at Groundhog Creek Shelter. 
We really enjoyed our rest and snack at the bald and then made our way to the shelter.  David had picked out a campsite at the shelter but we all decided to stealth camp another 2.5 miles up at Hawk's Roost. We all wanted to get some extra miles in so the final walk to Hot Springs wouldn't be so long. Since there was no water between here and there we cameled up. Water is really freaking heavy. One liter of water weighs 2-1/2 pounds! David usually carries 2 liters and I carry about 1-1/2 liters. 
My little toe on my right foot had been really causing me alot of pain all day. At the shelter I put some gauze padding around the toe and it felt much better. I also loosened the laces on the boot toe box. 
After we all got our water we started the climb up. David noticed his camp shoes were no longer on the back of his pack. We knew we had to go back and look for them. Finding size 14 shoes is not easy. They had fallen off at the campsite where he had dropped his pack. He was exhausted and hungry so we just decided to stay there send catch up with the girls in the morning. 
We hiked 6.9 killer miles today.","Campsite below Standing Bear Hostel

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612547,"April 30 (Day 38): We got up at 5:45 this morning to try and catch up with the girls if possible. They are fast hikers! The climb up went on for several miles. We hoped to meet them at Max Patch, but by the time we got there they were gone. 
Max Patch was once used to graze cattle but is now a popular place to come for the views and beautiful grass covered bald. We stayed and relaxed and ate a nice long lunch. When we first walked across the grass s man stopped David and asked if he could talk his picture with the mountains in the background. Then another man stopped him to ask questions about our thru-hike. He felt like quite the mini celebrity!I pulled the rain tarp for the tent out to dry it and laid it across the grass and then pulled off my shoes and socks. David was the celebrity and I probably looked like hiker trash! Lol!
As we left Max Patch, 2 women, Doris and Suzanne, stopped to ask us some questions about our thru-hike. Suzanne asked if we would like some pecans and we jumped at that. Then Doris said that all the had was some trail mix send would we like it. Before we could answer, Suzanne said ""Oh, they're hikers. They'll eat anything. Like the people we feed at church on Sunday. The homeless people."" We just smiled, but after they had left and we had walked on, David and I burst out laughing! ""Hikers eat anything. Like homeless people."" But she's right. We don't turn down offers of anything! We love any kind of trail magic!
We didn't catch up to the Cindys, but decided to stop just short of the Walnut Mountain Shelter and stay at Lemon Gap. The campsite was big and Charles and Charles ended up joining us along with 3 other hikers. The river flowed past in 2 places and we enjoyed a nice bath and foot soak.

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612549,"May 1 (Day 39): We got up early (We had to use our headlamps to see.) and left lemon gap. Trying to decide if we could make the 14 mile hike into Hot Springs, NC or should get close and then hike in tomorrow early. The trail would mostly be downhill the whole way. In the end we did hike into town. There were a few uphills, but mostly down.
The town was much smaller than I thought it would be. Not even a traffic light! We sat on a stone wall calling around to find a room and who walks by? Diesel! We were so excited to see her. We didn't think we would catch up with her. We knew she was coming back on the trail at Davenport Gap but didn't know when. She was staying at Elmer's Sunnyside Inn, but it was full. We finally found a room at the Alpine Court (Room 1 with a king size bed and A/C and a frig). Found out the 2 Cindys were there too (Room 5).
We ate dinner with the 2 Cindys at The Smokey Mountain Diner. David ate his pork chop dinner and part of little Cindy's meatloaf dinner plus dessert! The food was delicious and plenty of it!
As we were talking, a man stopped and asked if we were thru-hiking. We told him yes. He said he had just retired and his 3 grandchildren (ages 12, 10, and 8) were also thru-hiking (slack packing) with their parents. The grandparents had an RV and were meeting them each day. A support vehicle. We had heard of a family doing that and were excited to meet them. Grampa told us the youngest boy's trail name was Yahoo. They were putting in 18-20 mile days! They were from Maine. We talked for several minutes and thoroughly enjoyed it. A minute later the waitress came by and picked up our checks. The grandfather came back and said ""God bless you and have a great and safe hike. Dinner is on us."" We were overwhelmed by his generosity! What great trail magic!

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612551,"May 2 (Day 40): We decided to take a zero day in Hot Springs. Little Cindy was still feeling bad. There is a festival (the French River Festival) in town this weekend and all the rooms are booked everywhere. We tried to get a cabin for the 6 of us, but couldn't find anything. David, Diesel and I ended up staying at the Alpine Court again (room 6). Went to the Smokey Mountain Diner for breakfast. It is now David's favorite place to eat.
We went to the dollar store and did a small resupply then went back to our room to go through our packs and send home stuff we don't need anymore. After that we hit the outfitters and I got some good rain gear and a belt. No more boot lace. Lol. We also bought a pint of Ben & Jerry's ice cream. There was a scale there and David stepped on it to check his weight. Completely dressed and with his hiking boots on, he had list over 25 pounds! In 6 weeks! He would tell me everytime he went in another notch on his belt and I knew he had already gone in 4 notches, but this much weight loss in so short a time really has me concerned. I've lost 10 pounds. I have read that men tend to lose more weight and faster than women do, on the trail.
We stopped by the Post Office and got a box to mail home our stuff. It was great to lighten our packs some! Their computer was down so we couldn't send it out. Arghh!
Back at the hotel we decided to go to the Hot Springs Resort and soak in a hot spring. We stopped at the P.O. and the computer was up so we sent our box. 
We got to the resort about 3:10 and got a reservation for 3:30. The resort is really pretty.  We got a private tub, for an hour, filled with water pumped straight from the springs. There is also a mister overhead that you can turn on. It was so relaxing!
After that we arranged to meet Tall Cindy for dinner at the Iron Horse Station restaurant. The food was incredible. David had snacked all afternoon so he wasn't really hungry and ended up just ordering onion rings. They were huge! I got a fantastic chicken sandwich with cheese and avocado.
During dinner we talked about everything and had a great time. At one point we talked about trail names and David started telling them about some he had come up with like Walkman Killer (I didn't put it in a bag and the rain fried it) or Energy Killer (I didn't lock my headlamp and burned out the batteries.) He also liked Seabiscuit because at the end of the day, when he is dragging, I tend to get a spurt of energy and really climb up hills. I didn't want yo be named after a horse. Diesel said she liked it and the meaning behind it. (Check out the YouTube video of Seabiscuit's famous race.) We also talked about our routine when hiking. I mentioned that I love to soak my feet at the end of the day or if we come across a good stream during the day. I said that it felt so good. Cindy commented that I had happy feet then. Then she said ""Hey, that should be your trail name because you like penguins too. Just like the movie!"" So I am now Happy Feet! David is CoffeeBean.

We met them closer to 8 and Chappy joined us. Our group of 6 said goodbye to Hot Springs and walked across the bridge over the French Broad River and down the AT trail along the river before finally beginning the mountain ascent.
The uphills were tough because the air was so hot and humid, even early in the morning!
We stopped for a long break at a place called the Dammed Pond. There was a beautiful stone wall built to dam up the pond. It was a really tall dam wall too!
Little Cindy is still recuperating from her bout of noro. She still feels a little weak and hasn't eaten a whole lot. She thinks it was food poisoning but David ate a good chunk of her meatloaf and suffered no ill effects. And food poisoning doesn't last several days so we think it was noro. Chappy's the only one now that hasn't had it.
Got back on the trail and hiked to .1 past the Spring Mountain Shelter.  David wanted to go on but I was done. We set up camp with Chappy and the 2 Cindys. Amy was just below, at the shelter.
The bugs are absolutely horrible. They're like little flying gnats and they swarm all around your face. I pulled out the netting on my hat and it was better.

It had started to sprinkle before we got there. The 2 Cindys and Chappy had gotten their rain gear and umbrellas out and said that it was still early so they were going to hike on a little farther. We were done so we wished them luck. We started setting up our tent as fast as we could and Diesel set up her hammock and then the bottom fell out! We threw our packs in the tent and climbed in.

It was really foggy too. We told her we were going to wait until it warmed up a bit to see what we were going to do. It started raining again shortly before she left. (She later said it rained her whole hike.) About 10:30am we thought we might move on and had half the tent packed and the bottom dropped out again. The wind picked up then and it got cold. We decided to zero today. We really, really didn't want to but we just don't do well with rain AND cold. We slept and I journaled. (Surprisingly I have cell and internet access!) We also strategized about the rest of our hike. We would like to make Damascus, VA by May 18th (for the big Trail Days Festival). To do that we will need to pound out 14.4 mile days between now and then. We believe we can do that. Resupply is the only pain in the butt. It just seems to take so long to get into town, shop, and then get back on the trail, but we are going to work hard to shorten that time if we can. I'm telling you. If someone had a mobile truck, with real hiker supplies, and they went from gap to gap or parking area to parking area, they would make a fortune!  To not have to get off the trail and hitch a ride into town and then hitch a ride back out, would be great!
It's 5pm and the rain has finally stopped. It's supposed to be nice tomorrow, Tuesday, and Wednesday and then possible showers on Thursday. Hopefully we'll be far enough away by then. I'm tired of the rain and am trying not to get too depressed about taking another zero so soon.

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613277,"May 6 (Day 44): We were on the trail by 7:40am this morning. The tent was wet so we bagged it to dry out later, probably when we stop for lunch. Walking along we heard wild turkeys gobbling down the way. We never got to see them, but we could certainly hear them.
A hiker passed us and said that we would probably pass a couple in a few minutes who had stopped for lunch. They had gotten engaged on the trail! Sure enough, we came upon Hot Lips and Quincy. (Hot Lips got her trail name because she grew up watching M*A*S*H.) We congratulated them on their engagement! Hot Lips said they were on the trail in a thunderstorm at the  NOC in Nantahala when Quincy pretended to fall on his knees. He has a bad knee and she thought ""Oh, no, he's hurt his knee!"" While down on his knee, he proposed to her! Hot Lips showed me her ring and it was beautiful! The ring was made by a friend of theirs and Quincy had recorded the making of it. It has a large round diamond in the middle with 3 smaller round diamonds on either side. She said they had passed us earlier in the day and Quincy had said to her ""That'll be us"". That made us smile.
Another note about our engaged couple. Earlier that day I was feeling discouraged and slow. We started our hike on March 24th and seemed to be the last people in our bubble. I asked the good Lord to give me some encouragement. (I know everyone should hike their own hike, but sometimes it seems that we hike and hike and just don't get far. Like a hamster on a wheel.) We asked Quincy and Hot Lips when they started and they said March 15th. As we walked away, I realized my prayer had been answered. We were not the last people or the slowest hikers. I don't mean that to sound snotty, but it was nice not to be the old, last people in the bubble.
Later we passed a headstone set by the trail by the Howard Bassette family. He had thru-hiked the AT in 1968 and passed away at 83. They had buried (or spread his ashes) on that site the following year. 
After that we came upon a beautiful meadow. In the center were three headstones - the Shelton graves. It seems that 3 Confederate soldiers had come home to see their family and were shot dead on that site. David and William Shelton and Millard Haire. Millard was only 13 years old! The site is maintained by the descendents of Millard Haire. It was really a beautiful and serene place. We sat and had a nice lunch. We also pulled out the tent to dry. I hope that wasn't disrespectful.
We ended up hiking to a stealth camp just up the road from the Laurel Hostel, and right next to a beautiful stream. We set up camp and then soaked our feet in the stream. I took a picture of my ""happy feet"" and sent it to the Cindys.
After that we walked up to the hostel and bought a Coke and a pizza (that they cooked on the grill for us). It tasted so good!

The trail was narrow but it went on and on through blankets of beautiful white, wild flowers. We kept looking for a level spot to camp but the trail remained narrow and gently rolling. David finally decided to hike up the ridge, off trail, and found a dirt road. Along the road was a level spot! There were flowers all around it. Down below, on the other side, we could see a condo and another road. We hoped no one would come down our dirt road.

Several hikers had camped there that night. What a view! The clouds were all around us, by the treeline, and the mountain tops in the distance looked like islands in an ocean.
We hiked on and came to High Rocks. We left our packs near the trail and hiked up to the top. Another great view! Boy, was it nice to hike without a pack. We literally jumped up the rocks!
We hiked along further and since we were worried about not finding a stealth camp again, we stopped at the next one we found. Shortly after getting our tent up, Six staggered in and asked if she could share the spot. We said of course! A short while later Mr. Maps came in. He and Six were hiking together. He was so glad she had stopped there too. 
Several hikers traveled through our site, since we were right on the trail, and one especially interesting fellow we met was Sketch from Osaka, Japan. (We asked his real name so we could Google him: Yusok). He is a freelance illustrator and sketches everyday just for himself. This is his triple crown.

We continued our hike into Erwin, TN. We passed several views of the Nolichucky River as we hiked down. It was pretty impressive! 
We came off the trail and turned left and there was Uncle Johnny's Hostel. Diesel had booked a private cabin for the 3 of us. Diesel was slack packing and said she would meet us at Uncle Johnny's later. 
David was dying for Bo Jangles and the free shuttle from the hostel was not going that way, so we got directions and took off on bicycles. We emptied my backpack so we could also hit the Food Lion and resupply while we were out. 
We rode about 3 miles and could not find the ""Erwin Linear Trail"" that the woman at the hostel told us to take. We stopped to ask 2 men at a store and the father insisted that we go back the way we came and get up on the interstate and get off at the next exit. I said ""We're on bicycles. We can't ride on the interstate."" He said ""Are you sure? I bet you can! That would be the way to get to Bo Jangles."" I assured him we could not. Then his son said ""I think she's right, Daddy. Remember that guy hitchhiking on the highway and the state police picked him up and took him to Spivey Gap?"" They gave us directions that had us riding through town and then admitted that they were from NC and only came over the border to shop and didn't really know the roads in Erwin. So we rode on and asked some locals. We got better directions and found the trail. It was a nice paved path that ran along side the river. We had to ride about 3 miles and finally found the restaurant! Then we had to ride another mile to the Food Lion. We FINALLY got back to the hostel about 5pm, just in time to see Diesel and the shuttle head off to Walmart.
The private cabin was big but not worth the price. Towels were raggedy and bed lumpy. Took a shower and then had to do laundry when we got back. That took another couple hours. Other than a bed and shower, I hate resupply! It's exhausting!

We then crossed the bridge that went over the Nolichucky River and walked along side the railroad tracks. Then we had to actually walk up and over the tracks. We had to cross over lots of streams via footbridges. The first bridge was an Eagle Scout project. We met a bunch of hikers that we're slackpacking SOBO so they wouldn't have to do the big uphill out of Erwin when they left. It turned out that the uphills weren't as bad as we had been led to believe. Thank goodness!

We hiked up Unaka Mountain and it was so foggy you couldn't see very far ahead of you. It was kind of spooky.
Down the mountain we walked into a spruce forest. There were only the spruce trees, no bushes or smaller trees. The spruce were tall with no lower branches. The floor of the forest was soft with needles and it was very foggy. THAT was spooky too!
We hiked in the rain till we got to Cherry Gap Shelter. I took off my pack cover to find that my pack was soaked! I don't know how as there were no holes in the cover. I was so pissed! David made a hot lunch of a Knorr Rice Side but I didn't eat much. I was cold and wet and just sick of this rain.

The hiker community is reeling from the news of the attack of 2 hikers by a man with a machete.

The attacker, who called himself Sovereign, surrendered. A woman had also been attacked and walked 6 miles before coming upon a group of hikers and getting help. She is going to live.

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615614,"May 14 (Day 52): We stealth camped in a spruce forest down from the Roan High Knob Shelter. We woke to temps in the 30s and ferocious winds. Neither of us slept very well because of the cold. We wore all the clothes we had, but were still cold. We hoped the temperature would warm up as the morning went on, but it didn't. David really wanted to take a zero, but we finally broke camp and headed out about 11:38am. Because we started so late we hiked until 7:50pm.
We started by hiking down to Carver's Gap and then across the road. Our first mountain was Round Mountain and then Jane Bald. We love hiking up to balds because they have only short grasses and the views are amazing.
Just before going up Little Hump we stopped to see an old red barn that had been converted into a shelter. It was huge and had an upstairs and 2 large platforms on the side (kind of like porches) where you could watch the sunset and sunrise. There were several hikers that had already decided to stay there for the night and had claimed spots for the awesome views.
Then we started up Little Hump Mountain. That was a killer. Views were great but with the cold temperature and the wind, we didn't stay long to enjoy it. We came down the other side and had a short level period. Then I looked up... and up and up... the trail up Hump Mountain. David was not happy about doing another killer climb so late in the day when we were tired and he was getting hungry, but there was no where to camp so we had no choice. David went first and I followed. I tried not to look up because the climb seemed to go on forever. I saw a rock outcropping and thought ""Thank God we're at the top!"" Then God laughed because as soon as I got to the rocks I could see I was not at the top at all. Oh, He has a wicked sense of humor at times!
We FINALLY got to the top, but again the winds were so bad and the temperature so cold that we looked at the views as we hiked as fast as we could back down. We thought what a great place to camp if not for the weather. We did see that 2 hikers had pitched their tent for the night. 
So down we went with no flat spots for camping. We were both getting exhausted. Close to 8pm we came across Doll Flats, a large flat area with a water source. As you walked into it there was a sign that read ""You are leaving NC"". I set up camp. David made dinner and we crashed. We didn't even bother to hang our bear bag. God help the bear that might wake us up!
After all that we had only hiked 11.8 miles.","Down from Roan High Shelter

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615615,"May 15 (Day 53): Left Doll Flats about 9:50, we were cold and didn't sleep well. Today's hike had us going through woods and over bridges and through beautiful meadows. The elevation changes were like ripples, compared to the previous days. The ups weren't too high and the lows weren't too low.
When we got to US19 there were several shuttle drivers waiting to see if anyone needed rides into town or the nearby hostel. We told them we were good and we were hiking on. They said to be sure to get past Isaac's Cemetery and Campbell Hollow Road before 5pm. There were 2 families in the area that had been feuding for about 200 years and they started drinking about 7pm. He said they wouldn't hurt us but would sure make us uncomfortable if we ran into them on the trail. Like the Hatfield's and McCoys!
We were past those 2 spots early in the day, so we were ok. The cemetery was very pretty and serene. We just looked through the fence. Decided not to go in.
After a lunch of cheese and avocado with a fun-size candy bar for dessert, we started hiking again. On the trail you could clearly see deer hoof prints. We must have followed those footprints for at least a mile. Section-hiking deer! Lol!
We also hit our 400 mile mark! Someone made a ""400"" out of sticks on the left side of the trail.
Saw a gorgeous waterfall called the Jones Falls. It was really spectacular and we took lots of pictures. The trail then ran along the Elk River. This was a big river that you couldn't just jump across on the rocks.
Just before the Mountaineer Shelter was another waterfall called the Mountaineer Falls. It was not as big or impressive as the Jones Falls, but still pretty. 
The shelter was only .2 miles from the falls and the water source for the shelter was actually the top of the falls! The shelter is one of the newer ones, built in 2006, and sleeps 14. It has 3 floors and there were only 3 guys in it so they could each have their own floor. Lol! Also someone had carved a bear in a log and it was standing near the corner of the shelter.
The area around the shelter was all hills, nothing flat. The tenting area was just before you took the path down to the shelter, so we are right next to the trail to leave in the morning.

Today had a lot of uphills but they weren't too bad. Saw another waterfall (Hardcore Cascades). Not as impressive as Jones Falls, but nice enough for us to have lunch there. Wet Sticks and his girlfriend, Honey Badger, did the same.
Stopped for a break at the Moreland Gap Shelter. Called the Boots Off Hostel to arrange catching their shuttle into Trail Days in Damascus, VA on Saturday. Then headed uphill for a while longer.
Decided to stop for the day at a tent site in a meadow with a pipe spring nearby. I washed several pairs of my stinky sock liners and hung them to dry.
We debated going on for a bit longer but were worried we might not find a tent site, which has happened before. So we set up camp and then David was talking to a couple hiking past and they said that there were sites at the trail head 4 miles up. Ugh!! It was almost 5 by then and we didn't relish the idea of hiking for another couple hours so we just stayed put.

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615617,"May 17 (Day 55): Enjoyed our night in the meadow. Hiccup and Sherpa pitched tent across from us later that night.
Got back on the trail at 7:45am. The hike was straight up at first and then leveled out.
We walked into the Cherokee National Forest and along a beautiful wide, fast moving river, which I believe is called the Laurel Fork River. We stopped and sat on a couple of huge rocks near the river for our morning break. Saw Legs and Marathon walk by and chatted with them for a bit.
After our break, we hiked over big boulders and down into the gorge. There was a stunning waterfall. Sorry Jones Falls, but you just slid into 2nd place. The trail then ran along side the river and you had to climb over rocks. At one point we had to inch along a narrow ledge cut into the rock, just above the river. That was utterly cool!
Stayed at Boots Off Hostel. Awesome!! Grumpy and John welcomed us. They had someone very artistic paint the building and showers. Even the porch where we ate was painted with a night sky. There are 2 showers. The men's shower has a painting on the outside that says ""And into the forest I go to lose my mind and find my soul"". The inside has the painting of a man wrapped in a towel showering and thinking of beer and hotdogs, etc. It's really whimsical. The ladies shower shows a painting of their little town of Hampton and the inside shows a woman dreaming of pizza, margaritas, Snickers, etc. Really cute! The showers themselves use a short galvanized bucket with holes around the sides that fills with water and sprays down. It's really clever.
We set up our tent and I took a shower. Ohh, it was wonderful to be clean. Tomorrow is Trail Days and I can't wait!

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615618,"May 18 (Day 56): TRAIL DAYS IN DAMASCUS, VA!!!
Got up at 6:30 and dressed to make breakfast by 7:00. Grumpy is leaving at 8 sharp so you don't want to miss the shuttle. Breakfast was the best we've had at a hostel: cereal, fresh donuts, and coffee, FRESH FRUIT!, tea, and milk. I had Capn Crunch with Crunchberries, an orange, an apple, and half a donut. It was great!
While eating breakfast David mentioned to a fellow hiker that we were from Waynesboro (because hikers have usually heard of Waynesboro, but not Stuarts Draft). One of the other hikers said ""Really? We're from Stuarts Draft."" Can you imagine meeting another couple from little Stuarts Draft when you are in Tennessee thru-hiking the AT?? What are the odds? What a small world! It turns out they were the couple that stealth camped near us the day before! Sherpa and Hiccup! Sherpa went to Ridgeview Christian School like my daughters did for a short time! Unbelievable!
After breakfast we loaded into the shuttle: Riddle, Ambassador, Hagrid, Sherpa, Hiccup, Medic, Mr Maps, and us. There was also a couple that we dropped off at a trail head who were weekend hiking. The ride to Damascus took about an hour.
We parked by the Post office in Damascus and Grumpy reminded us to be back there by 4pm.
We got out of the van and saw Diesel first thing! We walked with her a bit and she showed us the path to take to get to the main area (the Town Park). We had to walk over a nice bridge. David mentioned that it was on a slant. (He is obsessed with things being slanted since he had to sleep on slanted ground several nights ago and his pad kept sliding.) The Town Park was crowded with arts and crafts vendors and companies that cater to hiking/outdoors. I didn't even stop to look at the arts and crafts because I knew I couldn't buy anything. I did stop at a tent that sold dresses. Diesel had bought one and raved about it. I tried on a medium and it was too big. Tried on a small and it fit great. And my stomach is flat! Haven't seen that since long before children. :) Bought that dress!
We wandered over near the library and met up with Chappy and the 2 Cindys. We talked for a bit and then they announced a walk/talk on edibles on the trail. I overheard a young woman introduce herself to the program speaker. It was Sundrop! We had not seen her since the first week of our hike! I had kept in touch via text though. I looked at her and yelled ""Sundrop!"" We just hugged and hugged so hard! I introduced her to Diesel and the rest of the ladies. David went to fist bump Sundrop and she said ""Don't give me that fist bump. I want a hug!"" It was so great seeing her! She left on her tour and we continued our conversation with Chappy and Diesel and the Cindys. The 3 ladies were getting ready to hike out since they had been there since Thursday. They took Friday (the first day of the festival) as a zero and decided to leave early to avoid the bubble leaving Sunday. We said our goodbyes and promised to keep in touch. We also told them to contact us when they were near Waynesboro for a stay at the Krogh B&B.
We then wandered down towards Tent City and the One Way Ministry. We met Sister as we crossed the bridge. David didn't even recognize her! We had heard she had shaved her head and it was true! She had had hair halfwayway down her back and now it was about 1/2 inch long! It looked good on her! 
We walked on and a church along the way stopped us and offered us chips and a drink and a place to sit in the shade. We were talking about the hikers we would probably not see again because they were so fast. One person we both thought of was Sketch. Just as we said his name we saw him walk by! He stopped and we talked for a bit then he walked with us to the One Way Ministry. They had a ton of free food and some folks had started playing guitars on the porch. We were sitting at a table inside eating when I look through the window and recognized the shorts and top of the woman out on the porch. I knocked on the window and Pebbles turned and saw me and I went running out to hug her! We had a great reunion and she introduced us to her current hiking partners: Camerman from Denmark, Mountain Goat from Taiwan, and Promo from Texas. They considered themselves the international group.
We walked to a nearby trailer and bought 2 pork BBQ plates and ate them while listening to the music.
Walked up towards the park to catch the Hiker Parade. It started with the oldest thru-hikers (1980 then 1999), then 2019, and then 2018 and back. Per tradition, many of the current male thru-hikers dressed as women. Don't ask me why. The spectators sprayed the parade and participants with water guns (except the older folks at the beginning). A fire truck at the end sprayed the crowd with a hose from the truck!
The parade didn't last long and afterwards we went back to some of the vendor tents that were doing drawings. Diesel had entered in a couple and won a 40 degree quilt for her hammock!
It was about time for us to leave so we walked back towards the shuttle van. Grumpy was there and so were most of the gang. Once Hagrid showed up we climbed in and went back to Boots Off. Riddle kept us entertained on the ride back with riddles and brain teasers.
We had about an hour until the 6pm shuttle into town so we just hung out. Grumpy took us to Subway, McDonalds, and then the Dollar Store. That sub was good! 
I took a shower when we got back and went to bed! Great zero day, but exhausting.","Boots Off Hostel

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615619,"May 19 (Day 57): We got up about 6:30 and dressed and went up for another great breakfast before packing up and leaving Boots Off Hostel. David insisted I take a picture of him and Grumpy before we left. I also texted Jim (the owner) last night and told him what an awesome hostel he had and that we loved it!
After walking down the road we walked across to Lake Watauga and the trail followed the shoreline for a while. The Lake Watauga Shelter was closed because of all the bear activity around it. In fact, Grumpy told us if we were going to hike out at any time of day, we had to make sure that we hiked past the 7 mile ""bear containment area"", where bears were so prevalent.  
The trail then took us up to the dam and we had to walk across that. The climb up to the ridgeline was steep and seemed to go on forever. 
A couple times we were able to see some pretty views of the lake. It is a long lake! We leap frogged with Mr Maps most of the day.
We stopped for lunch at the Vandeventer Shelter. We sat out on the rocks behind the shelter and had a beautiful view of the lake and surrounding area.
Don't know if I've mentioned lately how beautiful the flowers are along the trail. The wild rhodedendrons are finally starting to bloom. They are all pink but sometimes they seem to have darker or lighter shades of pink. They are gorgeous though.
We hiked on and finally dragged into the Iron Mountain Shelter about 7:50pm!  Stopped to get water and met Bearbait setting up her hammock. She had put in a 20+ day and had hoped to reach the shelter but was pooped. She said she was pushing because she was running out of food and needed to get to the Rabbit Hole Hostel to get her resupply. We offered her food but she had several food allergies. We should have stayed and camped with her but we had really hoped to do a 16 mile day so we pushed on. About a mile before the shelter I saw a bear! It ran up the hill toward the ridgeline. My first bear on the AT! 
We had hiked for 11 hours and 10 minutes and broke our record. 16 miles today! But we were exhausted! We had enough time to set up camp, eat a cold dinner, and hang our bear bag. We were just settling into our tent when it began to rain (Crusher had said there was only a 30% chance of rain.). It started slowly and then really began to come down good. We were warm and dry and exhausted so we didn't care. I'd worry about packing up a wet tent tomorrow.","Boots Off Hostel

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615620,"May 20 (Day 58): So it poured rain last night. Don't know for how long as we conked out right away. Woke up today and the tent was completely dry from the winds that followed the rain.
We slept in a little and didn't end up leaving the shelter until 8:50am, just as Ambassador was leaving too.
We really needed water. The first source we found was way down the hill and not very good. Had to scoop it with a cup, but we got enough to make it to the next source.
Saw an interesting monument to a local hermit. They called him Uncle Nick Grindstone. He died in 1923 and was buried there.
We continued looking for water sources. We tried several more but they weren't very good either. Finally found one around lunchtime and had a hot lunch and watered up. 
We walked through a beautiful meadow. An old farm building had a giant ""AT"" painted on the side.
We ran into Bearbait again. She had stopped at Rabbit Hole and gotten her resupply plus a shower and milkshake. David started obsessing about a milkshake. When we hit Low Gap we saw a sign that said ""It's not too late to get a milkshake."" We thought long and hard about getting one, but we decided to go on. Later we wished we had called for their free shuttle, tenting, milkshake, and shower.
We finally stopped to stealth camp. The site wasn't very big but enough to fit our tent. A while later a woman came and asked if we had room for another tent. She had just hiked 15 miles and was exhausted. (We found out later her trail name was Kokopelli.) David got out of the tent and looked behind the tree and told her there was room for a small tent. She said she was so tired she could sleep on a pile of rocks. She set up her tent and we heard her leave to hang her bear bag. Another man walked by and David talked to him too. He went a short way down past us and found a site.
We settled down for the night but I didn't sleep very well. Too noisy.

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615702,"May 21 (Day 59): As we hiked toward Damascus we crossed the VA/TN border. Woo hoo! Another state down!
We hiked into into Damascus, VA. The trail actually goes right through town. You pass under an arch built as an Eagle Scout project by a Boy Scout. The arch welcomes you to Damascus and tells you that you are walking on the AT. We then walked over to the library. We washed our hands several times in their nice clean bathrooms. We walked the trail through town. The sidewalk going down their main street is made up of bricks donated and/or created by people. Some are really creative and others are really touching.
We checked into a church-run hostel called The Place. It is donation only and clean. It had one bunk room and you used your own pad and sleeping bag. There was a shower and a kitchen with a sink. No laundry. The towel provided was actually a bath towel cut in half. Currently only one other person, named Phil, was there. The caretaker was a micro-managing, annoying, kind of creepy guy. He would come downstairs and look into every room every half hour or so. Later on Just Jim, Longfeather, and another hiker checked in too. Longfeather and a bicyclist tented outside. 
We went for dinner at The Damascus Diner. It was very casual but good food and lots of it. They were out of meatloaf so David had the pork tenderloin. I thought it interesting that the restaurant was run by all women. 
After dinner we went to the Dollar Store to resupply and ended up leaving one of our bags. Just Jim had stopped in to get an ice cream there and the lady had explained who we were and he found us. I took a shower that night and washed off the trail stink. David had fallen asleep early.

There were a lot of fellow hikers there (Mr Maps, Sherpa, Hiccup, Legs, Marathon). Then we continued hiking through Damascus. To get back on the trail we had to walk up a long flight of wooden stairs.
The rest of the day was tough. The hike out of Damascus was up, up, up.
We finally stopped for the night at a camp site down by the river. Ambassador was with us. We almost missed the site because we came down off the trail onto the Virginia Creeper Trail and crossed the bridge. David finally saw a couple down by the river and the little path to the site. We walked down and met Good Man and his best friend, Taylor. He owns a coffee shop in Cary, NC and she has been a barista there for 5 years. They had a great campfire going. I love the smell of a campfire. Taylor and Good Man asked us if we would like a cup of coffee. David, of course, jumped at the offer. He hasn't had a ""real"" cup of coffee in a long while. Afterwards he told me it was amazing.
Ambassador and I walked down to the river and soaked our feet. This girl had some Happy Feet that night!

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615707,"May 23 (Day 61): After a wonderful night falling asleep to the sounds of the river, we hiked out and began our climb up.
We hadn't gone far when a large RV stopped as we crossed the road and asked if we would like any snacks or drinks. Her name was Elizabeth from New Jersey. Her husband, trail name Gump, was running the trail and had started in Amicolola on May 6th. She was his support vehicle and would drive along stashing PB&J sandwiches and stuff at junctions for him. 
Elizabeth gave us gummies and trail mix and pistachios. Ambassador and I mixed the trail mix and nuts and split them. David asked if she had any orange juice. He was so excited when she handed him a big cold cup of it. He hadn't had any OJ since leaving home. Elizabeth told us that she and her husband had sold their home and bought the RV and were driving around the country in it. She was so nice and we talked to her for a bit. 
While standing there talking and eating, 2 women came SOBO down the trail slack-packing. We recognized Kokopelli from the other night when we were stealth camping. She asked if a bear had gotten our food bag. We told her no but I said that I had heard the bears crashing around during the night. She said one had torn the bottom off her bag and eaten her food. Her friend was camping elsewhere but a bear had torn her Earth Sack apart too. They were slack-packing while waiting for their new food containers to come in from Amazon. They had ordered  bear canisters instead of bags.
We took pictures of all of us and our trail angel, Elizabeth, and said our goodbyes.A short way up the trail we met a Forest Service ranger coming back from Thomas Knob Shelter. She warned us about the bears and to please make sure we hang our bear bag every night and hang it properly. Also make sure that we put anything with a scent into the bag. She said that a father and daughter only had toilet paper and clothes in the vestibule of their tent yet the bear tore the vestibule apart anyway.
The rest of the morning was a brutal climb up towards Mount Rogers, the highest peak in VA. We climbed from 2688 ft to 5100 ft. The summit with the views is Buzzard Rock, but you can take a half-mile trail to the actual summit of Mount Rogers but there is only trees. No views. Not going to waste our precious energy when you can't see anything. Besides, Buzzard Rock's views were incredible!
There was a large rock outcropping that I climbed up to explore. I found a backpack with its rain cover off and the cook pans and water filter out. It seemed strange but I thought that maybe the owner was exploring and would return.
We sat and ate lunch (tuna on flour tortillas... again) and then we laid back on our packs and snoozed in the beautiful weather.
A short time later Unicorn and NAB (Not A Botanist) showed up. We chatted a bit and then I mentioned the backpack in the rocks. We checked the pack for ID but found nothing. NAB called 911 and reported what we found. He and Unicorn stayed to talk to the Forest Service folks. We had nothing to add so we left.
We stealth camped at Deep Gap, after another exhausting but exciting day.","Stealth campsite by river

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615712,"May 24 (Day 62): Unable to find the spring last night, we just packed up and decided to get water and make breakfast at Thomas Knob Shelter (about 2 - 2.5 miles). The hike wasn't bad. At a small stream, David saw a trail and followed it out to a huge meadow. It was really foggy and you could watch the mist swirl by. It was beautiful. We had grabbed water earlier at a stream on the way up the trail so we were good on water. We continued up the trail and it opened out to a meadow. Right there in front of us was a herd of the famous Grayson Highland wild ponies! When they saw us, two of them came right over and started nuzzling our hands. They also licked our arms for the salt on our skin. There were babies too and we watched them run around and play with each other. We stayed a long time petting the horses and taking pictures. There was one horse that stood off, just watching us, at least we think so. His mane was so long it covered his eyes. We think he was probably the leader of the herd.
We also hit the 500 mile mark!!
We finally tore ourselves away and hiked on to the Thomas Knob Shelter for breakfast. I felt safer visiting it during the day though that really didn't matter. This shelter is widely known this year for its bear problems, day or night. They are so agressive and are constantly harrassing the campers by stealing their food bags and walking among their tents. They go after the food bags even though they're in the bear box. Last year a bear stood on top of the box and tried to flip it!
The rest of the day was spent hiking along open fields, seeing more ponies and even long-horn steer. (Farmers are allowed to lease the land and the steer keep the grasses short.) The weather was gorgeous and so was the hike!  Lots of long, rolling meadows, fields of flowers and grasses, and occasional rocks to climb.
Another fun spot was a rock tunnel, also called the Fat Man Squeeze. You could walk around the rocks but it was more fun squeezing through them!
We met the Forest Service ranger, Beth, again. We asked her about the pack on Buzzard Rocks. She said that a large group had hiked up there and a woman in the group had fallen and hit her head. They had rushed her to urgent care and must have forgotten her pack. We were relieved that the pack owner was ok.
Lunch was at Wise Shelter with our day ending at Old Orchard Shelter. A million dollar day!

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616093,"May 25 (Day 63): We began the day at the Old Orchard Shelter and got going about 7:30-ish.
Today's hike was pretty nice. More of the ""rolling hills"" that everyone claims describes Virginia instead of the killer ups and downs that we've actually been hiking. :)
We crossed through a field of cows and they just watched us as we walked past. They must be used to strange people walking through. One little calf stood in the path as I approached, like he was daring me to stay on the path. I won our game of chicken when his mom moo'd at him and he ran off. :)
As it got close to lunch time we began looking for a place to sit and eat and relax. We could hear a road and I said that there would probably be a flat place to sit (and maybe even take a nap!) where the road and trail intersect. We walked and walked and finally saw a campsite so we stopped there. We ate lunch (What else, flour tortillas and tuna! David had bologna.). I said that I really would love to take a nap. I just felt so tired today. So we set up the tent in 2 minutes, crawled in, and took a nap and a 30 minute snooze. I could have slept longer, but as we are constantly telling each other: ""Those miles aren't hiking themselves!"" We packed up and within 5 minutes came upon the stupid road!
We crossed over and saw a sign that there was trail magic on the road at VA670! That was 6 miles away and it was about 2:00. Three hours would make it 5:00. Sure, they would still be there at 5:00! So we started hiking quickly.
We were getting low on water again and the sources we came upon weren't that great. I didn't want to stop because I kept thinking of the trail magic, but we really needed the water. 
The next source was the Trimpi Shelter. I had wanted to see it anyways because it had been built in memory of a 17yr old boy and it was made of stone and had a fireplace too. Didn't know anything more of his story than that. I hiked ahead and got to the shelter ahead of David and got water. The mosquitoes were horrible!! and I couldn't wait to leave. No one else was there. (Found out later that there was a whole group of hikers that went looking for that trail magic too. One hiker even hiked down to VA 670 and then hiked back to the shelter.)
We finally got to VA 670 and no trail magic! ? So we looked for a place to stealth camp and found an old trail road (where they had rerouted the original AT trail), cleared away the sticks and stones, and set up camp.

He told us that he and Mr Maps were at the Hiker Inn in Damascus when a friend of theirs, Stargazer, walked past. They hadn't seen her since last year. Mr Maps had left the trail to attend his daughter's college graduation and would come back to hike the last 200 miles with her. (She had hiked the first 200 with him last year.) Crusher had hiked for several days with Stargazer. He also told us a funny story about her. They were at Thomas Knob Shelter with a group of others eating lunch. Suddenly a large bear comes walking up the path toward the shelter. Everyone scatters except Stargazer. She pulls out a bear ""gun"" (like a flare gun) and fires it over the bear's head and he takes off and she goes back to eating her lunch! We all had a good laugh at that.
Hiked 7.6 miles into the Mt Rogers National Recreation HQ outside of Marion, VA. We met Six on our hike in. Before the HQ there was a shelter called the Partnership Shelter. It was built by the friends and family of Robert Baldwin, in his memory. It said he was a lover of the Virginian mountains. It had 2 levels and a shower and sink! The water was not on but still. Wow. It also had several benches around the fire pit and a separate privy. It was very nice looking.
At the HQ I used a flush toilet and washed my hands several times, just because I could! I also changed into my not-quite-so-stinky camp shirt.
David had changed into his camp shirt too and then we went down to the road and tried to hitchhike. A number of cars and trucks went by but no one stopped. Three more thru-hikers came down too (Surprises, Die'sel, and Thuggins). Shortly after, a car stopped and offered us all a ride bit we were a seat short, so they told us to take the ride since we were there first. Joe, a super nice guy, drove us into Marion and to the Travel Inn hotel.
As we got near, David noticed Ambassador walking by. She just got in about an hour before us and was staying here too. We got our room, showered, did laundry, and walked to Mi Puerto for a mexican dinner and then Walmart for a resupply. (David saw Topoff in the laundry room and then we saw both Hoot and Topoff as we left the hotel.)
We came back to the hotel and watched TV and relaxed.
We hiked 7.6 miles today.","Stealth Camp past VA 670
","Marion, VA","May 26, Sun",7.60
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616486,"May 27 (Day 65): Today is Memorial Day. We got up early and packed up and checked out of the hotel in Marion. Ambassador was staying another day waiting for a package from Amazon.
We walked to McDonalds and had breakfast. Then we walked towards town to see if we could catch a ride back to the Mt Rogers Rec HQ. The Memorial Day parade was getting ready to start. As we walked past folks waiting for the parade, many of them stopped us to ask questions about our hike. One particular couple, Jim and his wife Fairfax (I love that name!) stopped us and we talked for at least 15 or 20 minutes. They were a lovely couple that looked to be in their late 60s, early 70s. Jim was a retired doctor and graduated from UVA. He and David talked about the NCAA championship and UVA taking it all (Of which David still can't believe that he didn't know who won for 2 weeks after the tournament!). Fairfax played tennis and they both took daily walks. And Fairfax had the prettiest light brown hair that was completely natural. She said none of the women in her family had ever colored their hair. When her mom passed away she only had a few strands of gray hair at her temples. Fairfax shocked us when she told us she was 84 and Jim was 87!  They were just the cutest couple.
The parade started and it was great! High school marching bands, old cars and tractors, and floats. One lady in the parade yelled out and asked if we were thru-hiking. We told her yes and she said ""We had this parade just for you!"" We laughed and yelled our thanks. I was especially moved by a float by the ROTC group. They had one of the members kneeling on a flatbed truck in front of a rifle with a helmet on top and a pair of combat boots beneath (the famous ""Kneeling Soldier"" statue). The parade only lasted an hour but we loved it! Small town parade. Doesn't get any better than that!
We walked down to the street heading out of town, to hitch a ride, but few cars came our way and none picked us up. One guy parked nearby came over to talk to us. He had thru-hiked years earlier and his trail name was ZZ Pop. He had the ZZ Top beard and everything, so we knew where he got his name! We talked for a few minutes and then I noticed a man had pulled into the lot behind him and opened the back of his car. He asked us if we needed a ride up to the Rec HQ. He was going to work there. His name was Jay and he was a wildlife biologist.
Jay dropped us off by the trailhead. It was close to noon by now. David was stalling getting back on the trail. So he walked over to the HQ and got a Coke and we shared it. I threw the can away, poked him with my pole and said ""Those miles aren't hiking themselves. Get going.""
It was a good hike that day. A couple of uphills but nothing too bad then lots of downs and levels. 
We saw an 1890 farmstead. The house was closed but we were able to peek in the barns and see the old farming tools and a horse-drawn buggy. There were some chairs and a swing on the front porch. I could just imagine sitting out there on a summer evening, after working hardon the farm all day, and talking about our day. I got a kick out of the lantern hanging from the porch ceiling. The whole farm was in amazing shape for the age.
We hiked a short ways from there and came upon the Lindamood Schoolhouse from 1894. The desks and chalkboards were there. Each desk held 2 students. On the walls were pictures of Abraham Lincoln and George Washington and an American flag. On the chalkboard was written the following:Welcome to the 1894 one room school, built in 1894. One teacher taught grades 1st-7th. School started in Oct and ended in March. Usually there were 18-25 students. Teachers were paid $30.00 a month. This school closed in 1937.Have a great day! God bless.
In the back of the school was trail magic like we had never seen! Four large wooden crates held everything a hiker could hope for. One had supplies like first aid, toothbrushes, toothpaste, floss, feminine stuff, etc. Another crate held 2 containers. One container had fresh fruit like apples, bananas, and oranges. The other had all kinds of snacks (cookies, crackers, rice crispy treats, etc.). The last 2 crates had coolers with all kinds of drinks on ice! There were a bunch of hikers there hanging out and they said the ladies from the nearby church had come by earlier and refilled all the food. It was awesome!!
A lot of the hikers decided to stay and camp out there. It was only 4:30 so we decided to put in a few more miles before calling it a day. We were also stoked up on food so we had energy galore!
We left the school house and hiked through a pretty pasture and into the woods. As it got closer to 6 o'clock and there were no stealth campsites to be found, we started getting concerned. We came up to and crossed railroad tracks and considered finding a flat spot by the tracks (Thank goodness we didn't!), but pushed on, across a boardwalk and up an incline. The grasses were tall on either side of the trail but the area was fairly flat so I suggested camping there but there was a farmhouse that we were concerned might see us and we didn't know if this was their property. David went up the hill a little farther and found a flat spot, out of sight. We camped there and watched a beautiful sunset. Now if only we could have done something about the noise from the railroad tracks on one side of us and I-81 on the other. Oh well. The view was still really pretty.
Hiked 10.9 miles today, even with our late start.","Marion, VA
",Stealth campsite,"May 27, Mon",10.90
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616514,"May 28 ( Day 66): We woke up and thought it had rained but the tent was wet because of the heavy dew. It was even dripping off the trees so we thought it was still raining. The rain tarp was soaked. Neither of us had slept very well. The train came through 3 times last night and, holy cow, was it loud. We thought it might be coming right through the tent.
We packed up and hit the The Barn restaurant, only a mile from where we were camped. Crusher said the coffee was great and he couldn't wait to go there in the morning. I don't think the taste would have mattered to David. It was real brewed coffee, not instant! (He did say that the coffee was good though. Bonus!)
We waited a bit to see if Crusher showed up but then at 7:30 decided to get going.  We had to walk along the road for a bit and then the underpass of I-81 till we saw our white blaze. It was strange hiking along there in the woods hearing the interstate traffic rush by and knowing that most of the folks in those vehicles probably didn't even know the AT was running parallel to them.
We climbed higher and into denser woods, looking for a sign for the Davis Cemetery. James Davis settled the area and it was originally called Davis Fancy (I love that name. Too bad they didn't keep it.) We found the little cemetery after pushing through waist high grass and an almost non-existent trail. It had a little fence around it and a couple pretty shade trees but it was overgrown. The stones were in pretty bad shape. One had been fastened to a tree to keep it upright. Several were just stacked against the other tree. The one of Harold (1808-1886) and Annie (1816-1867) Davis was in good shape to read. So was Lizzie Davis' (1859-189?).
We walked back to the trail and continued on. We finally hit the sign that read ""1/4 GA->ME""!! Wonder Woman had gotten there just before us. She took our picture by the sign and we took hers. She even included us in her Instgram post.?She mentioned she was from Holland, Michigan. We told her we took our daughter there when she was little and there was a windmill and local girls would dance a Dutch dance. Wonder Woman said that she was a Holland dancer when she was in high school!
We  walked through several beautiful, privately owned pastures. You knew they were privately owned because the sign by the gate would ask you to please close the gate after coming through or you would have to climb up and over the fence by way of a ladder.
After coming through one particularly beautiful pasture and climbing up and over the fence we came upon the campsite where Stronghold and the Canadian woman were attacked and Stronghold lost his life. There were flowers and a cross with his name on it. There was also a book and pen in a bag for hikers to leave their thoughts. Hikers had left momentos and coins. We stopped and spoke quietly of this loss to our hiker family. I said a prayer. We walked on, but definitely in a more somber mood. It was so hard to believe something that horrible happened.
We hiked on a while more and then stopped for our favorite lunch of avocado and cheese on a flour tortilla.
After lunch Crusher caught up with us and walked to the next road where he was going to stay at the Quarter Mile Inn and then leave the trail to go home. (He hikes about 150 miles of the trail each year.).
We hiked on to the Knot Maul Shelter and there was no one there but us. They thought ""Holy crap! We must be the very last hikers on the trail!"" Later that evening though another hiker came along and slept in the shelter. 
We had a number of tough ups today but still put in 15.2 miles.","Stealth Camp
",Knot Maul Shelter,"May 28, Tue",15.20
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616573,"May 29 (Day 69): We left Knob Maul Shelter and started up another mountain. We were headed to the Chestnut Knob Shelter at the top of Garden Mountain and we knew today was going to be a day of brutals ups. And it was. But once we got near the top, it opened up to pastures along the Chestnut Ridge. They were nice and so pretty, but now we were out in the open in the blazing sun. Whew! Was it hot! And they went on and on.
We finally were back under the trees and walking along what appeared to be an old road. It obviously wasn't used much because of the large ruts and rocks everywhere. The road seemed to go on forever too and I was getting sooo frustrated and tired. After going around yet another curve, I slammed my poles on the ground and yelled ""Come on!!"" and a few other choice words that I won't include here. Guthooks kept saying it was only .3 miles to the shelter. That was the longest .3 miles!!
But finally, finally I saw the shelter! This shelter, the Chestnut Knob Shelter, is made of stone and completely enclosed on 4 sides and has a door too. Outside was a nice fire ring with logs around to sit on. Inside were 2 sets of bunk beds, a single bed, several windows, and a large picnic table in the center. Someone had drawn a fireplace on one wall, complete with red flames. There were several hikers hanging out or snoozing. David took off his wet shirt and sweatbands and I took off my Buff and we laid them on the logs outside to dry. There was a nice breeze blowing in addition to the sun. We then sat at the table inside and ate lunch. After lunch, David took a nap and I walked around. I checked out the privy. I laughed when I saw the toilet plunger. You would really have to be ""talented"" to plug up a privy so bad that they had to use a plunger on it! How would you even use a plunger on a privy? One of life's mysteries I guess.
The other views were much prettier. They were of the valley called Burke's Garden. The valley is only 8 miles by 4 miles in size, has one road in and out, and only about 300 inhabitants. It is beautiful to look down upon, but I've heard the weather can be really harsh. Lots of snow in the winter and rarely above 80 degrees in the summer.
We probably stayed about an hour and a half before heading out. The down was not too bad.
We came to a dirt road, Walker's Gap. It had several campsites but we decided to go up to the ridge and look for one. We hiked up and were on the ridge when we noticed that the thunder in the distance was getting louder and more frequent. We came on a site and I said that we needed to make camp now. David suggested hiking another 1/2 hour or so but I insisted we stop. As we started to set up the tent, the wind began picking up. We just finished getting it staked down when the rain started. We threw ourselves and the packs into the tent when all hell broke loose! The thunder was right overhead! The lightening lit up the tent! The winds tore at the tent! In  fact, the winds were so strong that the tent was laying flat down on us. We had to lay at the bottom of the tent with our arms straight up in the air, holding the tent poles up because the tent kept collapsing. This went on for about half an hour. The winds finally slowed enough that we didn't need to hold the top of the tent off our heads. We pulled out our sleeping pads and blew them up, changed into our camp clothes, ate a cold meal, and, tried to sleep. David asked if he should hang the bear bag and i told him I didn't think even the bears would come out in this storm. We talked to several hikers later that had gotten caught in the storm. They said there really wasn't any place to hunker down. They just tried to find a bush or large rock to squat next to and wait it out. Then they called for a shuttle at the next gap.
Hiked 11.2 miles today.","Knot Maul Shelter
",Stealth campsite by Walker's Gap,"May 29, Wed",11.20
Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616575,"May 30 (Day 70): Even though we had a terrible storm last night, the silver lining was that the wind had pretty much dried out the whole tent. The one side of the rain tarp that was away from the wind was still a bit wet, but shaking it up and down for a few minutes dried it out quickly.
Today was a great hiking day! Gentle ups and downs, ridge walking, and beautiful views. Hiker's heaven!
We ate lunch at the Jenkins Shelter with a group of other hikers (Platypus, Laugh, Ula, Maniac, and Willow to name a few). Where to find the next water source was the main discussion because a lot of us were low. Several of the sources along the trail were dry. Found that the next source was a nice river, just down the way.
We finished our lunch of, what else, flour tortillas and tuna/baloney, then headed for the river. It was a great source and we filled up! Laugh had pulled out his stove and was making a cup of vanilla chai black tea. It smelled amazing. He was trying to get caffeinated up for the big climb ahead of us this afternoon.
We had decided several weeks ago, after much discussion back and forth, that we   probably needed to go off trail for a couple weeks to take care of some things at home and some issues with our rental house in NC. We had first texted the girls that we were coming off trail and they would need to pick us up. At first they were very upset and thought it was because of them and they were afraid we wouldn't finish. So we called them then and assured them that they were not the only reason, but, yes, we missed them terribly and wanted to see them too. But we were also not giving up and would definitely be finishing our thru-hike. So we decided to have them pick us up in Bland, VA on Friday, May 31st.
So we started up. And up we went. We just kept thinking about the girls coming to pick us up the next day. That's all that got us through that killer climb.
The end of the day had us walking across a beautiful bridge over the Laurel Creek. Lots of folks had stopped to get water or just wade in the river. We crossed and were coming down to the road when a woman came up and stuck a ""FOOD"" sign in the ground. Anything related to food immediately gets the attention of hikers. The lady said we could follow the trail or the road to get to the food. We chose the trail and it only took a couple minutes to see the little side trail to several white tents. Awesome trail magic!!! There were half a dozen men and women restocking food and grilling hamburgers and hotdogs. There was everything we could dream of to eat, in addition to the meats, there were donuts, cookies, veggies, fruit, candy, soda, water, chips, juice, chocolate milk, cupcakes, and I'm sure more that I've forgotten. Oh, and ice cream too!! We ate at least one of everything. David really loaded up until he was full, and that took a lot! There were at least 10 of us there and more hikers kept showing up. Word travels fast, even in the woods. ?
Our trail angels were the Appalachian Trail Outreach Ministries (ATOM) group. They have been doing this for 17 years. Some of the folks worked full time jobs and saved a week of their vacation time just to come and do this. One guy was from Arkansas. Another was a teacher who had to go back to finish the school year on Monday. We were so touched that they would give up their personal time to come feed us. And they had been there all day. They had fed breakfast to the hikers camped nearby that morning and then lunch in the afternoon and we were getting dinner. They were going to pack up after we were done, but made no move to start packing because they didn't want us to feel rushed to eat.
After eating our fill, we went around and thanked each of our trail angels personally and then waddled up the trail. It was after 4pm but we wanted to get a little closer to Bland. The more miles today, the less to hike in tomorrow. Did I mention that 2 of our girls were coming to get up in the morning? ?
So on we went and then about 6pm decided to look for a stealth site. Of course we couldn't find one and I couldn't get the Guthooks app to find us using the GPS. (That drives me crazy, when I press the button to locate us and it can't find us or it show us in a location that we were in several hours ago!) We stopped to rest and another hiker was walking by. I asked him if he could tell us where we were in relation to Bland because Guthooks wasn't finding us. He said ""Oh, we're 1.3 miles from Bland."" (Then Guthooks synced up to us! ?) David and I looked at each other and said ""We can do that!"" So we jumped up and took off.
At 8:30 that night we walked off the trail at the Brushy Mountain Outpost. We heard earlier that if you bought breakfast the next morning you could camp around the store. So we joined the other dozen or so tents that circled the store. I texted the girls and told them where we were and that in the morning we would let them know where to pick us up in Bland.
We also CRUSHED our record by hiking 20.2 miles. David also has a pedometer on his phone. We did 50,498 steps! Woo hoo!","

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616794,"May 31 (Day 71): It poured rain last night, but we were warm and dry in our tent. About 6am we heard someone ""knock"" on our tent. We were already awake so I said ""Yes?"" and a familiar voice said ""Mom? Dad?"" David and I looked at each other and quietly yelled ""Mackenzie? Megan?"" We didn't want to wake up the other hikers camped near us, so we quickly unzipped the tent and said ""Oh my gosh!! Come in here so we don't wake anyone up! "" When we unzipped the door, the best word to describe their reaction is ""recoiled"". Because that is exactly what they did while pinching their noses and covering their mouths. They both gagged and said ""Oh my God, you smell!"" and they backed away from our tent. The hiker next to us was taking his tent down and said to them ""Yeah, we do stink after a while."" I kept trying to shush the girls and have them come in the tent, but there was no way they were getting anywhere near it! So we shoved our feet in our boots and jumped out to hug them! We hadn't expected them for hours. There are no adequate words to describe how good it was to see them. Two months! We had never been away from them for that long.
We hustled around to the front of the building to talk. They said after we had texted them our location last night, they said ""Let's be spontaneous and surprise them!"" So they jumped in the car at 9:30 that night and drove to Bland. (I told them I had heard a car pull into the gravel parking lot late the night before, but thought it was just turning around.) It was midnight. Mackenzie put on her headlamp and she and Megan came around the building, hoping to surprise us. They saw an orange tent like ours and Megan began unzipping the door. She only had the zipper a little way up when she saw boots and said ""That's not their boots!"" and quickly rezipped the tent and they ran back to the car. They decided they would wait until closer to morning where there would be more light.
It rained that night and they said they were glad to be in a dry car. ?
Then about 6 they came looking for us again. That's when they came around to the back of the building and saw all the tents. We have an orange 3-man Big Agnes tent so it was easier to pick out in the light. (The one they started to unzip the night before was also an orange Big Agnes, but only a 2-man.)
We talked and packed up our gear and by then the restaurant was open. We all had breakfast. David and I apologized to Chong for ""someone"" unzipping his tent in the middle of the night, but he just laughed when he heard the story. He said he had taken a sleeping pill and was dead to the world. He had put in 25 miles that day.
After breakfast we loaded our stuff into the trunk. (I saw there were sheets and towels covering the seats in the car.) We gave a hiker a ride into Bland and then headed home to Stuarts Draft.
We will be off trail for a few weeks until we take care of some stuff at home. We plan to be back on the AT no later than July 1st. We will probably flip up north to Killington, VT to get to Katahdin, Maine by August 15th. We then have to run back home to take Megan to college and help Mackenzie move into her first apartment. Then back on the trail until the end of September. 
I will return to work on October 7th, thank goodness, because we will be coming home to an empty house and that is going to be very hard. I am really going to need something to keep my mind busy.

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617893,"June 29: We are back!! Today the girls drove us to Carlisle, PA and dropped us at the trail. We had planned to leave the house by 8am (Carlisle is a little over 3 hours from us), but didn't actually get on the road until 9. David kept saying ""Let's just go out to breakfast and leave tomorrow. "" I think the fact that he's become addicted to the Netflix series ""Ozark"" has a lot to do with it.
I enjoyed the time to sit and read and got through two James Patterson books while home. On the trail there are folks that load books on their phone or bring their Kindle with them, but I honestly don't know when they find the time to read. At the end of the day I am ready to sleep! I have my addiction too though, i have to admit. I spent a lot of time tending to my farm on Townville. I asked the girls to make sure my animals are ""fed"" while I'm gone but I don't think it's a high priority in their lives. Lol!
We found a smaller, less busy road that the trail crosses in Carlisle and we parked there. We said our goodbyes to the girls. Told them to text when they got home and waved as they drive away.
Well started out walking through a field so that was a nice, gentle way to start our first day back on the trail in a month. One of the Cindys is not far behind so we will probably be seeing her soon. Diesel is also going to be joining us sometime in July so we'll have a tramily hiking together!
There were a lot of wooden boardwalks and bridges to cross today. Of course, to welcome us back to the trail, it rained! It lasted about 30 minutes. We were able to get our pack covers on and then David held the jacket of my Frogg Toggs over the both of us. When the rain finally lightened up we started walking again. Within 30 seconds we came upon a beautiful stone bridge overpass! If we had kept walking we could have stayed under a nice dry bridge while it rained! Argh! We dis meet and chatted with Nate who was doing an overnight hike. He is also a member of the trail group that maintains the trail in this area.
The rain finally let up and we hiked up to the Darlington Shelter and stopped for a snack. Nate was there and so was a flip-flopper named, appropriately, Flip. The shelter was really amazing. It had 2 sets of bunk beds so you didn't have to sleep on the floor. And let me tell you about the privy! It was a 2-seater and big enough to have a party in! The hole covers were nice wooden covers with handles on them. The door of the privy even had a crescent moon on it! Have I been hiking too long that I can get excited over a privy? Lol!
After chatting for a while and enjoying our snack, we decided to try and make the next shelter (Cove Mountain). It was only 4:00.
We hiked until 6 and David had just commented that he hadn't seen many stealth campsites, when we came upon one. My feet were beginning to hurt so we decided to camp here, 3.6 miles short of the shelter.
We set up camp. David went back to the stream for water and met K-Town, who had camped by the water. After dinner, just as we got into our tent, it started to sprinkle. Then we heard thunder. There wasn't supposed to be anymore rain for the next 4 days.
Even starting late in the day, we hiked 8.1 miles.","Carlisle, PA (Bernheisel Rd)

Stopped at the Cove Mountain Shelter to make a hot breakfast but the shelter was .3 miles downhill so we cooked at a flat area across from the shelter sign. David is eating Zoom for breakfast now instead of 3 little oatmeal packets. (Zoom is like oatmeal only made from wheat.) It is working much better and filling him up. He is really feeling better now that we've made changes to his diet. He is also eating more meals/snacks a day. It has made a big difference in his stamina.
I, on the other hand, have been really struggling. I am really tired. I also felt really blah today and have seriously considered going home. I am going to give it a few days and see if maybe I am just in a temporary funk. Then I will make a decision.
We did hike into Duncannon today. The trail literally goes right through town, just like in Damascus. Being a Sunday just about everything was closed. We walked past an antique store that was open. it used to be the factory that built Lightening Guider Sleds (children's snow sleds.) The factory ran from 1904 to 1990. In the antique store they had old black and white TVs with The Three Stooges playing on them! They still make me laugh! 
We've been trying to hookup with Tall Cindy. She is about 15 miles behind us. She texted to ask if we were stopping at the famous Doyle Hotel, but we were already on our way out of town. I did read about it on the plaque in their little town square. There was also a huge mural that had been painted on the building by the town square. It showed highlights and events of Duncannon.
We got through town and came to the intersection where you turn right and go over the bridge. We wanted to eat at the Subway and also needed water so we stashed our packs in the bushes by an abandoned trailer and walked to the Subway. We saw K-Town there too. Enjoyed a sub and soda and filled our water bottles then went back and grabbed our packs. We walked across the bridge with no problems. (It seems that there is a peregrine falcon nesting area nearby and it's not uncommon for the falcons to dive-bomb the hikers as they cross the bridge.)
Right at the start of the trail we came upon trail magic. Someone had left coolers filled with ice and soda and water. There was also a box filled with snacks. We grabbed a soda and some Ho-hos.
The climb went uphill and then we really hit the famous Pennsylvania rocks. We're talking giant boulders that we had to climb over! We finally got to the Clark's Ferry Shelter. David went to get water and I laid down on one of the bunks. I was so tired! We met Ladypoles, Tree, snd Spider at the shelter. They were fun to talk to.
We decided to hike another 1.2 miles to an overlook that had some campsites. They view is beautiful and we should be able to see the sun rise in the morning. It was only 6pm when we got there too. Ladypoles joined us later and camped too.

We left camp about 6:30 and hiked to the Peter's Mountain shelter. It was the biggest shelter I can remember seeing. Two floors and the picnic table was in the shelter so you could eat dry if it rained. The only downfall to this amazing shelter was the trip to get water. It said is was .2 miles down, but that included 300 steps! Down wasn't too nad, but coming back up was exhausting especially carrying 5-1/2 liters of water! Several day hikers came in and we had a nice chat with them. Then in walks Tall Cindy and Cowboy!! We have been trying to meet up her for almost 2 days. We were so happy! Also, she has a trail name now! Her sister gave it to her - Braveheart. We made plans to meet on the trail later and camp together tonight. Then David and I headed out.
We hiked for a while and when we stopped for a break, Braveheart and Cowboy came along. We all hiked on. We met Hiccup and Sherpa and Ladypoles later on too.
We ended up stealth camping at a lovely site covered with pine needles. Someone had moved the large flat rocks around to form reclining chairs with backs. It was so nice to sit on something other than a log. There is also a porcupine that hangs out at this stealth camp. Previous hikers nicknamed him Needles. We were all in our tents except Cowboy, who was actually cowboy camping by just sleeping on a mat with his sleeping bag. All of a sudden we heard him say ""Hey! Get out of here. Go on."" Needles had come to visit! By the time i got out of my tent to see him, Needles was hiding behind a tree. Maybe Cowboy can get a picture tonight.

They can break camp faster than we can. We started hiking about 6:40. (Cowboy said Needles didn't come back to visit him the rest of the night.)
Today's hike wasn't too bad as far as terrain, but the temperature went up to 92 degrees and the humidity was brutal. When you're hiking in a green tunnel there isn't much breeze. The bugs seemed to love Braveheart because she wore her bug net over her head part of the day.
We met some new hikers (new to us) named Jeopardy and Letters. Also ran into Freebird while we stopped for lunch. He is quite a character and loves to tell stories and jokes.
Came to a section of the trail with a detour due to beavers damming up the river and flooding the trail. You could hike that section but you would have yo wade across the river. We decided to go with the detour that ran parallel to the AT trail. It was about .6 longer but it was a forest road so it was flat and well maintained.
We had to cross several busy roads and walk under I-81. Wouldn't have wanted to try and cross that, running with a full pack and trekking poles!
Water was a big concern today. Several of the water sources were dry so when we found one we filled up and cameled up.
Walked through part of Swatara State Park. It was a nice hike with just a few ups.
After leaving the state park, we crossed a large foot bridge that ran over Union Canal. There were several benches so we took a break. There was also a trash can so we unloaded all our trash. That is always nice. Less weight to carry!
Then we walked under I-81 and started up, up, up. We were all drenched with sweat and exhausted by the time we got the 1.2 miles to the stealth camp. We were able to set up and eat a cold dinner before the rain started (30% chance of rain. Yeah, right!). We had heard some thunder and then it poured buckets for about 45 minutes.
But we hiked 15.3 miles today. We are going to get up early and put in at least 17 miles tomorrow so we can be in Hamburg, PA in the afternoon of July 4th.","Stealth campsite

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618059,"July 3: We started early this morning, Cowboy, Braveheart, Coffeebean and I. We had to finish going up the mountain we started last night but then it was pretty level the rest of the day. Level, but not easy! The trail was filled with rocks just big enough to have to walk over or around or on. It really slowed us down but it was nice at least not having to go up or downhill.
Several times we really had some big rocks to scramble over. Those were fun!We crossed a pretty meadow with a beautiful view of the valley. The sun was out so we pulled out all our wet tents and gear and enjoyed a break while everything dried.
Cowboy and Braveheart crossed the 1200 mile mark today! So proud of them and happy we were there to witness it!
Later in the day we were crossing what looked like an old forest road and Cowboy spotted a large black rattlesnake laying in the sun. I didn't know some were black in color. I had only seen pictures of the ones out West and they are more sand colored. Coffebean comes walking up and I said ""Look at the rattlesnake!"". He walked toward it ""to get a better look"". The rattles started and the snake raised its head! Braveheart yelled at him to stop and the snake headed off into the grass, in the same direction we were headed! So we hurried down the trail.
Cowboy owns a farm and cattle ranch in Ohio. He is one fascinating person to talk to! I have learned so much about farming and cattle!
We were trying to get to the Black Swatara Campsites before the rain started but didn't make it. We were about a mile away when the skies opened up and poured buckets! We were drenched within minutes! Luckily I had my pack cover on but I didn't take the time to get my Frogg Toggs out (dumb move). I was drenched and my glasses were covered with rain and i had to keep wiping them just to see. And the trail! It became a fast moving river with minutes! You had no choice but to slosh through it, so my boots were squishing with water and covered in mud.
We got to the campsites area and it was a lake! So the bright side was that if we had gotten there before the rain, we would have set up right where there was now 6 inch deep puddles! We walked a little past that and found an area that was a little higher ground. It wasn't a cleared campsite. There were low plants and grasses. The rain was starting to slow so we all picked an area and cleared away any rocks or sticks and quickly set up our tents. I closed the vestibule on my side, stripped, and got in the tent to dry off and set up. I wrung my clothes out as best I could but knew I would be wearing wet clothes in the morning. I didn't even come out for dinner. I just asked David to hand me a tortilla and a chicken salad packet and ate in the tent.
We broke our mileage record though! 20.8 miles!","Stealth campsite

Happy Feet and Coffeebean,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618061,"July 4: We got up at 6:45am. We ate a hot breakfast and packed up wet everything. Wrung out our clothes as best we could and got dressed. I always wear long pants because of how sensitive I am to poison ivy, but the thought of putting on long, cold, clammy wet pants was not appealing. I unzipped the bottom section of both legs to make them into shorts. I put on clean, dry socks and stuck my feet into my boots. My socks were instantly soaked. 
One thing about Braveheart that always just impresses the heck out of me is that no matter how crappy things seem, she is always upbeat and positive. Every morning she greets all of us with a smile and a ""Good morning!"" Even today when everything was wet, she was smiling and cheerful. I know I really needed that as I put on all those wet clothes.
We saddled up and headed out about 7:30. The trail was a muddy mess! We spent a lot of time trying to walk on the edges of the trail to avoid the deep mud, but sometimes walking through it was the only choice. Well, our boots couldn't get any wetter.
One thing I don't think I've mentioned much are the insect bites. I don't know what the bug is because I never feel it bite me, but it leaves the biggest welts on me. The bites are large, circular, hard red, welts. And they itch like crazy! David doesn't get them. I should probably wear bug spray but I hate the greasy feeling. As David would say ""It's all part of the experience."" But then, as I said, he doesn't get bitten.
We did hit a really rocky uphill that was brutal. We took a well-needed break at the top.
While we hiked we talked about what we were going to eat at the Logan's Steakhouse in Hamburg, the town we were hiking towards. Steak and baked potato were top of the list.
During one break we ran into K-Town and Viking. They bragged about the hostel they stayed at and the homemade waffles they had had at breakfast. We just groaned about how good that sounded!
We stopped for a quick lunch at an overlook and enjoyed the view of the beautiful farmland below. The walks in the forest were beautiful. You could see lush, green ferns for miles.
We still had about 2.8 miles to get into town and my feet were really hurting. I knew I would have blisters. It felt like I was walking on pins and needles. Wasn't sure what that meant but I figured it couldn't be good.
The downhill in Port Clinton was really, really steep. There were some rock steps but also areas with nothing to keep you from sliding down the rocky dirt of the trail. It was almost to the point of dangerous, but we made it down.
We walked through the little town and under I-81. We were looking for a small path that we were supposed to be able to follow into Hamburg. After going under the underpass, the only trail we found was to take us back onto the AT NOBO. So we headed out to the 4-lane highway that we knew went to Hamburg and the Microtel hotel and Logan's Steakhouse.
It was a mile down this busy highway with traffic rushing past. We saw a McDonald's and headed for there. We were starving and out of water. We couldn't wait for dinner at Logan's! We all ordered meals. We just imagined our hamburgers were steaks and the french fries baked potatoes. Ha! Cowboy got the ice cream that he had been craving. Two cones!
We did hike 15.8 miles today.
Coffebean and I are calling it. This has been the adventure, challenge, and journey of a lifetime but the AT will always be here while our two youngest daughters will not. They are both moving out and on to new chapters of their lives. We are pausing, not quitting, our thru-hike. We will go back and finish our hike in sections and summit Mount Katahdin, just probably not this year. We have hiked 700 miles and had the most amazing time, met the most wonderful people (some that we will keep in touch with for the rest of our lives), and learned more than we could ever have imagined. We have walked up and down mountains in the freezing cold, the rain, the heat, the mud. We have seen breathtaking balds, wild ponies, boars, bears, porcupines. The trail magic was unbelievable and so very appreciated. Thank you, Trail Angels, for the food and rides into town! Thank you to all the friends and family that have supported and encouraged us. You will never know how much that has meant to us.","Near Black Swatara Campsite
