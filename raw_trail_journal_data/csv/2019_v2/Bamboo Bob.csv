Bamboo Bob,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624066,"Off at 8:45. I decided to hike down to the ALDHA meeting in Williamstown via the AT from the point closest to our house. Wet rocky trail.  Wet leaves.  Fell twice.  Met JayZ, hiker girl, two more nobo women, and one guy my age going north.  The two here at Goddard Shelter are from North Carolina, doing the AT in VT.  Cold morning. Being 70 means having to walk a bit slower. No more twenty mile days. All my gear is at least six years old from CDT and some from the PCT. And even 2002 AT.","Forest Service Road off Arlington-West Wardsboro Road

Bamboo Bob,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624069,Camped at Harmon Hill. Rough going down at rt 9 and then up to here.  Stopped at 5:15.  Fell once.  Back sore.  I was going to get water from the River but two dudes told me a guy was handing out water and food at the parking lot. He was gone when I got there but a nice day hiker gave me a liter so that saved me sometime for the climb. I met a girl day hiker who climbs Harmon Hill every day. She told me there's a shelter two miles up (I knew that) but I think she didn't want me to camp up on Harmon Hill overlook. I did anyway. It was late and I was tired.  Great views. It rained all night but my tent was dry in the morning since it was so very windy.,"Goddard Shelter

Bamboo Bob,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624070,"Rained all night but so windy that tent was dry in the morning.  Great hiking day.  Yellow tunnel of foliage.  Passed three nobos.  Camped here with couple completing Long Trail, southbound, tomorrow, and then heading to Maine to finish the AT too, and an odd guy with a huge 80 lb. pack and jeans.  Stopped at 3:45.  The couple made Smores and chatted late which was fun. ","Harmon Hill

Bamboo Bob,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/624134,"Rocky walk the rest of the way.  Pine Cobble is a steep up and down.  Unfortunately, no views today.  Met one guy trail running, who does the Pine Cobble twice every day and then a whole team from Willims running for their workout. They went up but never came down so I think they do a loop with the AT. Nice walk through town and a chat with a local guy who actually understood what I was doing. The few people I talked to all congratulated me when I said I was done. They thought I had finished the Long Trail. WHich I have done twice but not this time.  Happy to be in the Willows Motel, nice guy Paul behind the desk. Excellent dinner at next-door Greek restaurant with motel discount.  Good beer too, Berkshire Brewing Co. Always one of the best things about backpacking.","Seth Warner Shelter
