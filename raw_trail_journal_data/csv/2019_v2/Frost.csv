Frost,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610128,"Phew - arrived in Gainesville via train and shuttled by Ron Brown (highly recommended) to Amicalola State Park. Registered as hiker #2099 with associated orientation. Because I’m staying at lodge tonight, I decided to do waterfalls piece of approach trail (thanks Ron). Emotions were very high as I started the walk forward and found myself reflecting a lot. These tired legs took the steps up the falls very slowly and I cherished every aspect of it. Settled in and ready for long sleep! Bring on tomorrow! Love to all I love!","Amicalola Visitor’s Center Approach Trail

I’ve decided to go home and pursue treatment options. I’m incredibly sad and disappointed, yet overwhelmed by all of the love, thoughts / prayers, and support coming my way.
