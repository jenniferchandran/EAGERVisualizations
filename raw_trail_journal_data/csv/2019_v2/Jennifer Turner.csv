Jennifer Turner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610893,"The number one question I've been asked lately is ""Why?"".  Why would anyone want to walk 2000+ miles from Georgia to Maine?  Why put yourself through that?  Why give up a great job and apartment to live in the woods?  The truth is sometimes I ask myself why too.  Thoughts like  ""Am I making the right decision?"", ""Should I forego job security to attempt a goal that is not even guaranteed?"", and ""What if you hurt yourself or fall off a cliff?"".  All of these are legitimate questions.  I vacillate between being a nervous wreck with knots forming in my stomach to completely excited and thrilled at the thought of giving it all up and stepping foot on the trail with my pack and nothing but time between me and the end destination.  I found out about the Appalachian Trail a few years ago and was instantly intrigued.  Not only was it one of the world's longest continuous footpaths, but there were people ""crazy"" enough to hike the whole thing.  I knew in the back of my mind that I wanted to be one of those people.  The thought of completing the thru hike would be the ultimate accomplishment.  Not only will the trail test me physically, but most importantly mentally.  So to all those people out there asking the question, my response is ""Why not?"". ",,View Entry,"Apr 19, Fri",0
Jennifer Turner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613769,"Today was a LONG day!  We set out for Harpers Ferry, also known as the ""psychological midpoint of the AT"", around 9am.  Unfortunately, we didnt arrive until after 5pm because of traffic.  We hit traffic in Richmond, VA, and it didnt die off until we got to Harper's Ferry.  On the way up here, I was so excited, but did have moments of nervousness.  I oscillated between the two emotions. Now that I'm here, I'm ready to face the trail.  I hope I get everything out of it that i wanted, plus some.  Once we arrived, we toured the historic downtown district, which is within walking distance from our hotel.  It was so quaint and idyllic.  You could tell the buildings have been here for a while.  So much history is here.  I even had mom and Jer step foot on the trail.  They can now brag they've tackled a few yards of it. :)  It was awesome stepping foot on the trail.  It was a teaser to what lies ahead for the next few months.  ",,View Entry,"May 17, Fri",0

Jennifer Turner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614247,"Sorry for not updating in a few days.  Service is spotty at a best and I'm trying to perserve my phone life in case of emergencies.  I plan on updating this blog every time i hit a trail town and can recharge. The past few days have been.... Challenging, exciting, hard, insightful. I could go on and on.  I'm so grateful to have this opportunity and on top of that to meet so many wonderful people out on the trail.  The trail is a great equalizer of humanity.  It doesnt matter who you are back at home or how much money you have.  None of that matters out here.  People often refer to one another by trail names.  The trail name bestowed to me is pink socks because i wear pink gaiters over my shoes to keep debris out.  I'll take it.  I officially feel like a thru hiker now.  In total, ive hiked a little over 40 miles.  I will be crossing the mason-Dixon line shortly and I am beyond thrilled.  I know 40 miles isnt a lot, but to say I've hiked one state the Appalachian trail runs through is a big accomplishment for me and also a morale booster. Thanks again for reading my blog and encouraging me along the way!! It definitely means a lot.  Please keep it coming!!  ","

Jennifer Turner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614565,"Already 3.5 miles in to my walk today, I've come across a cute little store called Pine Grove General Store.  It's tucked in Pine Grove State Park.  I plan on doing about 10ish miles today and tomorrow and hope to stay in a hotel in a couple of days.  I'm so excited to rest in a bed and take a nice hot shower.  Most importantly, washing my clothes.  I think being grimey and dirty has been the hardest thing to get used to.  It's really hard putting on the same thing every morning knowing it smells absolutely horrendous.  My body is holding up pretty well given the amount of hiking, especially my feet.  I do have a few blisters on my feet, but hopefully, in time, they will harden up and wont be as sensitive.  Some nights I do have to take a few Advil or ibuprofen because my feet ache pretty bad by the end of the day.  I'm starting to come across less and less people as I move further up in Pennsylvania.  It is sometimes hours before I see another hiker on the trail.  Some days it's nice, but others it can get a bit monotonous and boring.  You'll be surprised by the number of thoughts that randomly pop up in your head while you're out here.  You'll also notice a lot more things you wouldnt have noticed if someone was with you.  Like a large caterpillar crawling on the ground, an owl hooting in the night, etc. You get the idea. Pennsylvania is supposed to be pretty rocky and the rocks are already taking a toll on my feet.  In northern PA, there are supposed to be even more.  Some the size of huge boulders.  Cant wait for that.
Until next time!","Tom's run shelter

I'm more than 100 miles in to this epic journey.  I know I still have a ways to go, but I'm glad to have at least 100 miles under my belt.  I decided to hike in to Carlisle and take a couple of rest days, so that my body can recover and give my feet a break.  I'm so grateful to have a nice bed to sleep on and running water.  It's the small things that matter now. :) ","Backpackers Campsite

Jennifer Turner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615132,"Today has been such a great day!!! I'm feeling pretty refreshed since I took my zero in Carlisle.  I decided to hike in to Duncannon and stay at a local church that opens their doors to hikers passing through.  They are kind enough to allow hikers to stay in the basement of their church building.  Not only is it air conditioned, but it also has a shower with hot water :)  They even cooked hotdogs and hamburgers for us.  Wasnt expecting that at all, but it was greatly appreciated.  I would highly recommend Duncannon Assembly of God if passing through town.","Darlington Shelter

Jennifer Turner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615799,"Hi everyone! I'll try to become better at posting on a regular basis.  I made it in to Port Clinton and was officially adopted in to a tramily (trail family)! I've been really blessed by the people I've met on the trail.  I was feeling a tad bit homesick this morning wishing I was in Port Clinton already and low and behold I ran in to 10-4 and Bounce.  Bounce quickly turned the frown upside down reminding me of the accomplishments I've already made.  I've almost completed 200 miles of the trail.  I know that's a small dent in the grand scheme of things, but it is an accomplishment! Right now I'm focusing on small steps like just making it to the PA-NJ border.  The hardest part of PA is yet to come.  Just North of Port Clinton there are boulder fields and even more rocks. I havent really seen many great views throughout PA. Mainly rocks, mud, and fields.  I'm still grateful to be out here though.  My favorite part of the day is in the morning just walking through the woods, listening to the birds chirping.  Speaking of animals, I did have my first snake encounter.  A rattlesnake to be exact.  The snake was right there by the trail and i didnt see it, but sure did hear it.  I screamed like a little girl and ran back towards Catherine (another flip-flop thru-hiker).  She was definitely braver than I.  We had to bushwhack in order to get around it.  Turns out it was feasting on something and they apparently get more aggressive while eating.  That incident sure did get my heart racing. At the shelter later that evening, all of us hikers gathered round the table to discuss all of the snakes we saw throughout the day. Fun times!  Until next time!

Jennifer Turner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616272,"The countdown to the end of Pennsylvania has begun.  The rain and rocks have really slowed me down the past few days.  I'm really looking forward to having another state under my belt.  I decided to take a nearo in Palmerton since it was raining the majority of the morning and didnt want to climb on the rock scramble out of Palmerton in the rain. Better to err on the side of caution than risk a twisted ankle or worse.  I had the privelege of grabbing lunch with a couple I met outside of Bert's Restaurant.  They paid for my lunch and everything.  So nice of them!!  I also met a bunch of other thru - hikers staying in the hostel.  Its nice to hang out with other people who dont think you have few screws loose for trying to achieve this goal. :)

p.s. I saw a cute little turtle on top of the Ridge and thought to myself if this little guy can make it this far, surely I can go a bit further too.","Campsite

Jennifer Turner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617525,"I'm a few days in to New York!! Woo hoo!!  So excited to have New Jersey under my belt.  I'm even more excited my parents are flying up to New York to visit in a few days.  It will be nice to have a small break from the trail.  While they're here I definitely plan on swapping out some of my gear to lighter weight options. 
I've decided to take a rest day and skip staying at the next shelter, since there's a problem bear in that area.  There is a bear that's bold and brazen enough to steal properly hung bear bags while people are hanging out right there.  I ran in to two guys yesterday who were camped a mile away from the shelter and had their bear bags out while cooking breakfast.  Sure enough the bear approached them and took off with their food.  Definitely want to avoid staying around there.  
Just a reminder to everyone who camps.  Please properly hang your bags and never leave any food behind.  Please pack everything out.  A fed bear is a dead bear.","

The lessons I've learned, the struggles I've faced, the beautiful views I've witnessed, and countless trail angels I've run in to along the way. I'm incredibly lucky to pursue this dream of mine.  The trail has humbled me greatly since stepping foot on it 7 weeks ago.  I know this is a daunting task, but I'm up for the challenge and cant wait to see what the next 500 miles bring!","

Jennifer Turner,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621213,"Hi everyone! Sorry for the lack of blog posts lately.  I'm now in New Hampshire facing off with the White Mountains.  They sure are beautiful though.  I'm only day three in to my journey in the Whites, however, I now know why everyone has been talking about them for quite a while.  They're difficult!  Ascents and descents straight up and down with slick rocks and tree roots lining the trail.  Even though its difficult the rewarding views are worth the climb.  Another thing ive noticed is how silent the woods can be.  No birds chirping or any other animals making noise. Not even mosquitoes, which I'm thankful for.  I'm now less than 400 miles from khatadin. I will be so grateful when I make that climb and flip down south.  Feels like I'm one step closer to coming home.  Until next time.

I've walked over 1,000 miles and made it to the top of Katahdin.  It was truly an amazing moment seeing that sign for the first time.  I felt pure joy and elation. Finally, my hard work has paid off and the first half of my adventure is over.  The climb up Katahdin was one of the hardest I've done out here.  It was more of rock climbing than hiking. I did it though!!","
