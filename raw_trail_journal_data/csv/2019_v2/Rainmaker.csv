Rainmaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607190,"Day 1 - our scout Troop 197 from Atlanta is doing a section hike mostly to prepare some scouts who are going to Philmont this summer.  But a couple of us scouts and adults are taking the trip just for fun.  I'm taking it because I enjoy backpacking and to finish up my Backpacking merit badge requirements.   The last requirement is to take a 5 day, >30 mile trip.  We meet at the 197 Scout Hut Rriday afternoon to load up and eat our Chick-fi-A.  The scouts and adults piled into a few cars and made our way up to Woody Gap.  After we arrived we all pitched our tents in the dark during a moderately heavy rain for the night.","Woody Gap

Rainmaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607191,"Day 2 - woke up, ate breakfast of bacon bagel sandwiches heated over a snow peak backpacking stove.  After breakfast, clean-up, and camp breakdown, we hit the trail around 9:15.  At .8 miles we enjoyed the view at Preaching Rock.  The sun had come out a little bit and we stripped some layers.  At mile 5.7 we arrived at Jerrad's Gap for a lunch break.  For lunch I had cheese, crackers, ham/cheese rollup and snicker bar with lemonade.    After lunch  we hiked about 2 more miles to Wood's Hole Shelter.  It is located on a nice knob with a bear box, bear cables, nice picnic table in the shelter. When we got to the site, we set up our pads and bags in the shelter.  Afterwards, we hiked back toward the AT to gather water.  We treated the water with chlorine tablets.   Afterwards, we all chilled in our backpacking chairs and built a fire.  For dinner we cooked chicken cheese quesadillas in a skillet on a snowpeak stove.  I used an aluminum foil cover to make it cook faster.  Most of us slept in the shelter.  All the spaces were full but 2 thru hikers made 2 spots for themselves by sleeping on and under the picnic table!","Woody Gap

Rainmaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607194,"During the night at Wood's Hole, it started to rain and there was thick fog.  We woke up, gathered our food bags from the bear box.  For breakfast I cooked oatmeal.  Afterwards, we broke camp and got on the trail about 9:15.  There was very dense fog.  Not far into our hike we climbed Blood Mountain (south approach).  At the top of the mountain, we met University of South Carolina's Mountaineering club who had spent the night inside the Blood Mountain shelter, which is an old building made of stone with 2 rooms.  After we talked with the club a little bit, we headed down Blood Mountain going ""north"".  It was very difficult going down with high winds and several exposed rock areas that were slippery.   At the bottom of Blood Mountain we arrived at Neels Gap where we bought food for lunch from the store there.   I bought pop tarts, cuban sandwich, vanilla coke, and a honeybun.  We ate it under the store in an area protected from the weather.  After lunch we continued our hike to Tesnatee Gap.   There the entire group except me and my dad would be picked up to be taken back to Atlanta.  At Tesnatee, we planted 4 Red Buckeye trees in the area for a conservation project.  After the project, dad and I departed Tesnatee Gap to continue another 5 miles to Low Gap Shelter.  About 1 hour into our hike it started to rain very hard and get dark.  We hiked in the dark and rainy weather for about 2 hours.  As I was hiking I was beginning to get discouraged and thought we had passed the shelter, or had become lost.  But as my dad had promised, we arrived in no time because we were hiking fast!  We arrived at the shelter, very happy.  But our hearts sank when a hiker who was tenting said the shelter was full!  We hiked down anyway to look for ourselves.  Sure enough it was packed with hikers already in their bags for the night.  At this time it was raining very hard and mostly dark.  The thought of pitching a tent was very depressing. My dad begged and pleaded for the other hikers to squeeze together to make room.  They felt sorry for us as we were cold and wet and agreed to make some room.  They were all very nice and talked with me a lot as my dad was unpacking his gear.    It was around this time they gave me the trail name ""Rainmaker"" as they thought I had brought all this rain with me.   I went to bed quickly and slept well considering the 15 mile day just completed.","Woods Hole Shelter

Rainmaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607195,"We woke up well rested and slow to get out of our bags due to cold weather.  For breakfast I had a packaged PBJ and a couple of snicker bars.  We departed camp just before 9.  The hike that day was my personal favorite considering we were hiking on a logging trail for a while that wasn't a steep grade.  The weather was really nice - sunny and brisk, good hiking weather.  We stopped at Red Clay Gap to get water.  The water source, a spring, was a long side trail downhill from the Gap.  It was very steep.  After climbing back up to the gap, we were so tired we decided to take a break for lunch.  Two guys that we met at the shelter the night before (yet-to-be and two-tenths) joined us.  They were  guys trying to make it to Maine.  After lunch we climbed a little over a mile to Blue Mountain shelter, getting there before 12:30.  This was my favorite shelter because it has several pegs to put your stuff on, a nice covered cooking area, and a great view of the mountains.  After we set up our pad and bags, we set up a drying line.  Much of our gear had gotten wet during the hike to Low Gap shelter the day before.  Shortly thereafter, 2 guys from the previous night's shelter arrived for the night.  We had lots of time on our hands so we mostly cooked and ate a lot of food to make our packs lighter for the next day.  I made quesadillas with the leftover cheese, chicken, and tortillas.  I also had some of my dad's dark chocolate with chili.  I really liked it having tried it for the first time.  The weather was turning colder that afternoon so we spent a lot of time chatting while sitting in our sleeping bags.  Before it started to get dark, we made a run to the spring to get water for the evening.  That evening, I had freeze dried lasagna.  It was mostly good but I wish I had some spices to give it more flavor.  With my full stomach, colder weather and darkness, I got into my warm sleeping bag but could not go to sleep because it was only 6:45!   I was excited to see the warm car the next morning meaning the end of our trip.  As it got fully dark, I kept hearing noises outside.  What I thought was a mouse running around outside turned out to be a leaf rubbing up against branches.  Around 7:30pm two thru-hikers rolled into to the shelter for the night.  They had done 18 miles that day.  I had a hard time sleeping that night because I was so anxious to get to our car the next day.  Eventually I went to sleep and before I knew it the sun was rising.","Low Gap Shelter

Rainmaker,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607196,"This morning I packed up my things quickly so we could beat the rain that was forecasted.  We didn't even eat breakfast.  We left before 7:30am.  2 of the thru-hikers we met (yet-to-be and two-tenths) at Low Gap Shelter were taking a ""zero"" and asked if we could take them into Helen.  They hiked with us today.  It started to sleet immediately.  But that wasn't so bad compared to the heavy rain we had 2 days before.  We had a few little climbs today but it was mostly downhill.  Once we arrived at Unicoi Gap I was so excited to eat my chik-fil-A sandwich that I had left in my car from Friday!  We climbed into the car, dropped the 2 hikers at their hotel in Helen, and drove home.  
After this trip, I have done the first 52.9 miles of the AT.  I would describe this trip as hot and cold.  There were some really great parts and some parts that really stunk.","Blue Mountain Shelter
