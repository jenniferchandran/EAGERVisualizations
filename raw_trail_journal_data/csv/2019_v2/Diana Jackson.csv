Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608764,"1408, my official trail number! Day one done! It’s hard to believe more than a thousand people are on the trail already! 
I arrived in Atlanta at 9am, unfortunately with little sleep. My shuttle driver Murris was a hoot! I now know all about pigs, bears, wolves, fire towers, gear, and much more! A shuttle is definitely the way to go! He had a disco ball and goggles hanging from his mirror. Murris was an experience... I was also given advice to climb a tree when running from a wild pig. I enjoyed that picture haha. 
Arriving at Amicalola Falls State Park was a bit overwhelming. There were so  many tourists and families and a ton of thru-hikers! Some seemed very confident, I was a bit more nervous. I also felt that my pack was too heavy. I tend to overpack or “mom pack”. You never know when you’ll need that extra pair of shorts! The trail is a good way for me to minimize stuff. Just the important things! I needed to send the duffel I used to check my bag home anyway, so I went through my bag and sent quite a bit of other things home. Hopefully I’ll be warm and comfortable despite that! Unfortunately my water bottle spilled inside the duffel on the flight as well... here’s to the unexpected! 
Leaving took me a bit. I checked my pack and checked my pack again. I chatted with thru-hikers and other friendly day-hikers and finally set foot through the arch! 
The whole first mile of the approach trail is all stairs up to the top of a waterfall. I took it really slowly on purpose. Better to care for my body rather than get there earlier. I met so many people on the lookouts all the way up the stairs. At the top, I started following the trail to the Inn I’m staying at, the Len Foote Hike Inn. It was a fairly short hike of about 4.8 miles, but it felt quite long. My back, shoulders, and feet were starting to ache and I could hear my body saying “what on earth are you doing?” I had a moment of thinking that, but I was also so taken by how beautiful it was. I had the perfect start day. 70 degrees, sunny sky, a nice breeze. 
I arrived at the Inn at about 4pm. I collapsed in my bed and just stayed still for about 20 minutes. Everything ached! Then I went for “snacks” in the kitchen and they had chocolate fudge cookies. They were so yummy and the perfect treat! The views from the Inn are wonderful, as it is right in the mountains and only accessible by foot. There is a communal dining room, a bathhouse, and a game room with a woodburning stove and large windows to show the beautiful view. The whole Inn has that musty New England smell that I have always loved when I stayed in Maine or New Hampshire with my family as a kid. 
Side note: the slippers I purchased from the North Face are actually heaven on earth. A true comfort to my angry feet. I wore them on a tour of the area and dinner, where I had the best conversations with two couples from Georgia. They were sharing photos of trips they’d done and chatting about my journey. We watched a slideshow afterwards about Patagonia. Next destination after this, I want to go! 
I am not disgusting yet given that it’s my first day, but I took a shower anyway because I had the option. It was nice and warm. I am finally resting now, about to pass out. It’s been a very long day! 
One thing I want to do in these journals is leave a “song of the day”. I have been listening to music during the trail and I have received plenty of questions about battery. Essentially, music has been such an important part of my life and it’s helped me through so many struggles, I just need it. At least for now. Spotify does not use a lot of battery. I definitely took a lot of pics and snaps today, but that was because I knew I’d have an Inn to charge my phone at. I will be more cautious in between towns. Anyway, the song of the day today is “New Skin” by Beach Weather. It just hit the spot. 
Signing off and passing out,

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608971,"Food! Today I realized the true importance of food. I ate a nice big meal of sausage, eggs, and biscuits at the Inn, but I waited a while before I ate again. Something about the annoyance of taking my pack off completely to get food out and putting it back on... I’m going to try to place some snack bars in my pack waist pockets for easy access! But because I didn’t eat much, I was getting hangry and feeling frustrated. I got up to Springer Mountain without even realizing it! The trail had the blazes, but no signs! 
I had hiked about 4.4 miles and was pretty much alone the whole way. It made me happy to have my music because I really can get into my head sometimes, especially when hungry! When I arrived on Springer, there were two people from the Inn, which was nice! And I met a whole clan of thru-hikers, all boys! They were all nice, but I definitely felt proud being a solo-girl hiker! Some of them were very ambitious, planning for a 17-mile hike on their first day. I was still happy with my plan to hike 7 miles.
... especially because it was starting to rain!! To all the folks praying for me back home, thank you! I was blessed with warmth and a light drizzle on my second day! I arrived at my shelter at about 2pm. There were a ton of hikers there already and it was starting to pour. I felt tired, but also didn’t know if I should change clothes because I’d need to filter some water for tomorrow and would need to go back out to do that. I am currently lying on my sleeping bag in my hiking clothes, but I’m pretty cold because I’m in my sweaty hiking clothes. 
One downside to today was that I found a tiny hole in my inflatable sleeping pad in the shelter. It’s tiny, but enough to deflate the whole pad. Ugh. I expected some downsides and upsets, but not on day two! I figured out a solution... I packed some medical tape with me so I used that to cover it up and was able to reinflate it... until it deflated again. Maybe REI will be helpful and allow me to exchange, but if not, I can get a new one at Neel’s Gap in a few days. These things happen! 
Overall thoughts for the day... I started out feeling pretty sore and homesick, but I took some Advil and headed off! I was hangry a few miles in, but happily ate my lunch on Springer and celebrated officially starting the trail! I felt really good the rest of the way to my shelter, but am now pretty cold and annoyed about my pad. I met so many wonderful people today and that helps me feel adjusted and happy to be doing this! And all the love and help from back home is also making me feel great, so thank you! I’m looking forward to a warm Mountain House meal! And the GORP, or trail mix, I have is also delicious; it has sweet dried fruit, which really hit the spot! 
People I’ve met so far: Eric from Litchfield County, CT (yay CT!), Jacob from Indiana, Colt from Arkansas, Emma from Texas, Amie, Graham, Amy (who brought her dog aghhh), Tyler (who showed me how to use my water filter properly and was very entertaining, and who had a whole block of cheese and powdered hot chocolate), two people from Germany, and two retired folks from Virginia! Honestly it’s a lot of names haha so I tried to get as many down as I could! Craig left me with a great quote since it was starting to rain when I ran into him: no rain, no pain, no Maine! A little early to start thinking about Maine, but it’s definitely on my mind. The first goal that will make me feel accomplished and encouraged is the NC border! Soon enough! Song of the day was Mr. Brightside. It is one of my favorite songs and it came on my shuffle, and just made me feel happy and comforted. Here’s to a warm meal and hopefully a good sleep! 
So... I am not sleeping well and am fully awake at 11pm. I was totally wiped yesterday, but since I took it easy today and only hiked 7 miles, I wasn’t really wiped. I went to bed at 8pm, which is pretty early for me anyway. Entertaining Tyler is a snorer, but he did offer me his extra pad tonight and I’m grateful. I could’ve hiked farther today, as I felt pretty good, but I know my body will thank me later. Tomorrow I plan on 13 miles... just the way the shelters and my plan worked out. I know I can do it, but I’m a little thrown off by today. It’s hard to have things go wrong so early on. I sat and wrote here for a bit, processing my own frustration, as that’s what the whole past year of my life has been about and it’s what I’m able to do now. I did get out of my funk for a bit and made dinner with everyone. My Mountain House meal was noodles and chicken, and tasted like ramen, but it was good! I played a card game (Tyler brought cards, mad props) called “Shithead”. Tyler and I played for the win and I ended up the “Shithead”. Hope that’s not my trail name! Haha. Emma and I walked to the stream to get water. It was crisp and clean-looking, but I’ll still filter it. Emma’s leaving the trail soon and I’m sad I won’t see her again. Tyler is a section hiker so I won’t see him either. Amie was also very intriguing, suggesting we ditch camp and hitch a ride into town, all while smoking a cigarette. She ended up staying and I’m glad she did. The retired dad passed out at 3pm and the mom was so sweet. Meeting people who are that age does bring comfort as they feel like parent figures and provide wisdom. The youthful energy of Tyler is also valuable so I am lucky to have gotten both. 
It is quiet now, with the sound of the stream in the distance. It was pouring this afternoon and there was thunder and hail; I’m glad I didn’t push on. I stayed dry all day and avoided being out in the storm. Very thankful for my expensive rain gear from REI regardless! I’m going to try to sleep now, hopefully I can!!

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608975,"Ugh. Rain. Today was rough. I was lucky enough to be sleeping in the shelter last night out of the rain/hail storm. But, because of the amount of hikers on the trail right now, there is less room in the shelters and I knew I might not have that luxury every night. I also didn’t sleep well in the shelter with my pad being broken, so I wasn’t too keen on sleeping anywhere until I could replace it. 
I started out the morning well. I woke up at 7am, which is early for me, but I was ready to go. I was definitely chilly and didn’t want to leave my sleeping bag, but I knew I had a long day ahead of me. For some reason, the way I planned it, I either had to hike 6 miles to the nearest shelter or push on and hike 13. 6 would bring me back a day and I’d have to change my hotel and everything this weekend, so I went with the plan. Every other day this week is 10 or less miles of hiking. 
Tyler was surprised when I started laughing and joking with him because he could not remember my name, so he started calling me giggles. A new trail name? Better than Danielle, what he was calling me all day haha. Breakfast of warm oatmeal was good! I headed out at about 9:30am. A little too late for my mileage, but I was enjoying chatting with everyone. 
The morning hiking was like walking through a rainforest. It was foggy, dark, and damp, but really cool. I came across a rattlesnake skin and almost jumped out of my skin. I’m glad it wasn’t the real thing. People at my shelter had suggested stopping at “Long Creek Falls”. It was beautiful! It sort of felt like Rivendell from the Lord of the Rings, with the intertwined branches and flowing water. It was very peaceful and I had a snack. I got back on the trail afterwards and headed for a place to have lunch. 
I passed a creepy, eerily quiet dirt road with a graveyard. That’s the second spot with graves that I’ve seen on the trail so far. Soon enough Colt from my shelter showed up. He was having some knee pain and I was having some feet pain. I climbed up to a mountain peak and figured I’d have service, so I checked in with everyone, but unfortunately my battery was low. Every day it’s been either or. I have great service, but can’t use too much of it because of low battery, or I have a ton of battery and no service. The latter was the first night. I tend to have more service in higher areas, so I’ve learned to stop on peaks and check in. 
I passed several people and eventually stopped for lunch at one of the mountain peaks. I believe it was called Sassafras. I could give that mountain some sass for the rough climb and downhill haha. Overall, Georgia hiking is all up and down. It’s constantly making you descend rocky slopes and go right back up again. There are some nice breaks on ridges, but even then, you’re looking down and to one side there’s a steep drop. It’s been interesting hiking. Not quite as gorgeous as the White Mountains that I’m used to, but there are some nice views! I’m enjoying it. 
The rest of the day after lunch was really rough. I had already climbed more than 10 miles, but I felt defeated. It was taking forever! I found Colt again and we got water at this tank and found a retired man who had hiked half of the trail last year and quit due to injury. He was very nice and helpful, and being able to put my pack down for 20 minutes made a world of difference. The last 3 miles hurt. My feet were killing me and it was starting to rain. It was early afternoon, but because the sun wasn’t out, it felt like evening and I was worried about making it to my shelter. 
I was having a lot of frustrating thoughts because of the mileage and the weather, and wishing I had done the 6-mile day. I finally arrived to my shelter and wanted to cry I was so happy. There was a fire and I met a trail ambassador and his grandson and they had wonderful tips for me. But the joy lasted briefly because it really started to rain. Five more minutes and I could’ve had my tent up, but instead I got completely soaked and so did my stuff. I put my tent on a muddy hill and was covered in mud too. After a long day, I was really not having it. And the shelter was full of people. I suspect 45 people were there. That includes the people in the tents; it’s a total for all the people at the campsite. 
I got out of my soaking tent to go up to the shelter to make my dinner. I was very thankful for the shelter to use my stove. I ate a Mountain House meal of beef stew and finally went back to my tent. With a deflated sleeping bag, and now being soaking wet, I didn’t sleep at all. I tried hard to, but I couldn’t. I was freezing and soaking. I knew I’d have nights like this on the trail, but you still don’t know just how bad it is until you experience it. I also was noticing that a lot of people had two-person tents. I considered that while shopping in REI, but went with a one-person instead. It’s tiny. I barely had enough room for me and my pack. I am considering replacing it and the sleeping bag in two days at an outdoors store. REI has a wonderful refund policy so I’m hoping something can work to send the other ones back. I loved all the help that I got there and truly felt ready to go on my trip, but again, couldn’t know how my gear would hold up until I was out there.
My shoes are amazing. Everyone said I would hate them. But they were dry and warm today because they’re waterproof, and the extra padding is great on my feet!  My feet have definitely taken a beating, but I’m thankful for these shoes. I have not thrown them off a cliff yet, REI employees. Hahaha. I do have a lighter pair of shoes waiting at home that I’m going to switch to, but not yet. 
Ugh what a day. Today was really rough. I honestly wanted to throw up my hands several times and getting through the mental challenge is going to be the hardest part for me. My body carried on and besides my feet, is doing quite well. It’s my head. Ugh. I definitely remembered things I talked with my therapist about this year, like mindfulness, and taking those moments to stop and take a drink of water or take in the view. I’m not on this trail to just do the miles every day. I want to take it in. But until I fully get my trail legs, it’s going to be a bit rough. I’m excited for when I’m fully adjusted; I think I can bear the stinky weather better when 13 miles doesn’t feel so long. One day at a time!Song of the day was “What the Water Gave Me” by “Florence and the Machine”. It gave me power and on a day filled with water, it was fitting! 
Diana/Giggles? Haha","Stover Creek Shelter
",Gooch Gap Shelter,"Mar 26, Tue",12.90
Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609006,"Ahh today was much better. It started out a little rough though. I woke up still freezing and damp. I made some oatmeal, but my hands were losing feeling. I got my tent and stuff packed up and headed out, but the wet gear made my pack considerably heavier. I continued on, stopping occasionally to take pictures of the views. I was also in my sleep clothes because my day clothes were wet, so I changed on the trail and was cold from the damp clothes, but they dried on my body as I walked. 
I stopped for lunch at Woody Gap. It was nice and sunny, so I laid out my day clothes to dry. Thankfully I had service. My phone was low on battery so I used my external battery for a little bit and was able to post and check in! It really made such a difference in my mood to be able to check in and dry things out. I had a tortilla with peanut butter and more of my trail mix. A lot of people were bailing for the night and going to Suches, GA. There were cars frequently going by, so it was nice to see civilization like that, but as long as the sun was out, I was good to keep going.
The hike after was not too long. There was also a beautiful view at Preaching Rock! I stopped there and chatted with another thru-hiker named Willow the Mountain Goat/ CVS / Dan. He had a lot of stories and we chatted for 20 minutes, looking out at one of the most spectacular views I’ve seen on the trail so far. The climb up was very rocky, but I almost preferred it over the mundane up & down I had been experiencing. I met some people later on who were night hikers! Nightwalker was the first guy’s trail name; the others didn’t have them. It actually didn’t seem that crazy to me to hike at night, considering you’re moving and might actually be warmer. But it’s full of rocks and roots here and I can’t imagine trying to navigate that. Apparently they all had the night shift at their last job, so it was just an easy adjustment. I met Bernie Man and his dad and Superglue earlier. Hoping to meet some more! I arrived at Lance Creek Campsite before I expected to and was able to hang up the rest of my stuff, including my tent.
The same trail ambassador from last night was here again, and he truly is a grandfather figure, standing there telling stories about every place and shelter on the trail. We could’ve started a campfire, but people were tired. I was actually doing well. Not to give TMI, but I did have to do my business in the woods today. Honestly it was not too bad; the only annoying part was walking so far away. The other campsites had privies, which are basically open port-o-potties... yeah they were gross. My feet are starting to blister and are definitely mad at me, but other than that I felt good. I haven’t mentioned my pack weight, but it’s 34 pounds with food and water. I think that’s pretty good, although I know people go for lighter. I’m sure it will change if I get new supplies. But 34 pounds for 13 miles on rocky downhills can kill feet. I was expecting that and have very nice wool socks and liners. I wanted to bring more pairs, but they took them out at Amicalola. I’m at a point where I could add some things I need and still carry the pack. It’s a lot of weight, but I’m doing it! Comfort, especially at night, is pretty important to me. 
I chatted with the trail ambassador, his daughter, and his grandson, as well as a guy named Chatham, who gave me another trail name possibility today. I got sunburned, which hadn’t even occurred to me since I’ve been freezing and it’s March and at home the sunscreen comes out in the summer. And I know you can get sunburned at any time of year, even while skiing. It just hadn’t occurred to me. Honestly, as much as I don’t want to damage my skin, it felt good to have the heat. I’ve been so cold. It’s just my hands and face... which led to Rudolph. So giggles or Rudolph? I’m hoping some more choices will come into play haha, although both are fitting. I always laugh at everything and I have always been the odd ball person that is misjudged, but once people get to know me, it works out well. We’ll see on the trail names haha. Pink nose Rudolph is tired.
I had Mountain House Chicken Teriyaki for dinner, but got full too fast and almost didn’t finish it. I started reminiscing about the beautiful rainy forest I saw yesterday. I took some pictures, but I wish I took more. It really was like walking through Lord of the Rings. I think I’m going to need to take out my GoPro and use it more! I was so excited to have it, but the overwhelming first few days put it down on my priority list. I will definitely take it out and start to film more of what I’m seeing. 
I’m in my sleeping bag now, no pad tonight; there’s no sense in bothering and it’s still wet. My bag is warm and I’m cozy,  but could be comfier. I originally was going to go farther today, but settled here. All day I was thinking “either site works”, “wherever I want to stop”. I’m glad I stopped here. It’s nice listening to the creek, and I was able to fill up on water! It’s definitely chillier here than I was expecting and I don’t think I brought enough layers. I will check out the store tomorrow! I can’t wait! I’ve put so much money into this trip, but it’s worth it to me. I want to be comfortable and as happy as I can be, and I have the power to make that happen. On my Overland trips I actually had a sleeping bag that was too cold and I remember them going and getting me a new one, so even on group trips like that, they want everyone to be comfortable and it’s expected that gear might change. I definitely went in with that mindset, but I was hoping the changes would occur later on. I realize the benefit of getting them fixed now. Oh well! These things happen. 
Song of the day is “Natural” by Imagine Dragons. Such a jam. I played it after lunch with all that food energy and it was great. 
Off to bed! Hope I sleep tonight! Thanks again for the love and support everyone! 
Diana/Giggles/Rudolph","Gooch Gap Shelter
",Lance Creek Campsite,"Mar 27, Wed",8.30
Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609078,"Today was awesome. I started out the day cold, as I have been. I was sleeping on cold ground all night so it was uncomfortable. The trail ambassador, who’s name is Pete, also Smokestack (I really take a while with these names, there are so many!), shook my tent to wake me up. I asked him to, but it still startled me. Haha. He told me later he was gonna call “Rudolph” and see if I responded. We ate oatmeal and watched the sunrise by the creek. 
The first part of the day was all uphill. I felt really sluggish. I’m not sure why. Maybe lack of sleep or just the pounding on my feet all day. I met the most wonderful people from the Georgia AT club. I had stopped for a break and a granola bar, and they walked up with shovels, ready to maintain the trail and clean it up. I must say, the trail is in excellent condition. The blazes are sometimes too far apart and I get concerned that I’ve gone the wrong way, but the trail itself is clean and the campsites are all well maintained as well. I was noticing at my campsite that there were a lot of down trees nearby, and Pete told me that Hurricane Irma took a beating on the trail and they had to come out and clean up the mess, but couldn’t remove all of the damage. There were a few trees in spots where the tent pads used to be, and I’ve noticed that some trees came down on the trail and they just cut the middle chunk out, so you could walk through the fallen tree. 
Anyway, the two men chatted with me about my trip and one of them said “I sense something about you. You’re going to Maine. We’re going to read about you on Facebook in a few months.” It made me feel really good. I definitely find Maine very daunting right now, as I am only a week in. But those little moments of encouragement make all the difference. We chatted for a bit and I was on my way. 
My shoes were also bothering me for some reason. My feet kept sliding around, which hasn’t happened at all so far. I tightened the laces and kept on, and as the day went on it was better. I really think my feet are sore because of the mileage and weight, but maybe it is my shoes. At this point, I’m just going to go with mileage. 
I made it up Blood Mountain without even realizing it, just like with Springer. It was a rocky climb, but really not too bad. There were a few “false summits”, but the view was spectacular. You could see everything and felt so high up. Finally! After so much up and down hiking, I finally hiked a beautiful, tall mountain. I was very pleased. And I ran into Smokestack and his family again! Also, his trail name is Smokestack because he’s always smoking a pipe.  They were so nice and we chatted while looking at the view. I think I made pretty good timing, because people started flowing in behind me and commenting on that. I felt like I had gone so slowly, but maybe not? A woman came up to the summit and screamed “Ahhh shit!” Haha I felt that! 
The next thing to conquer was the downhill. It was just like some of the mountains I’ve hiked with my parents actually, and I was having real flashbacks. A ton of rocks, sometimes a flat rock face with the white blazes painted on it. When I was younger, my mom and dad had the food and water in their packs and we all just hiked without it. Coming down those flat rock faces with 34 pounds was not exactly the same haha. I was actually scared. I managed to get down well and continue on, but it was definitely a rough downhill. My knee that has bothered me in the past started acting up, and my feet were not having it. But I really enjoyed it because it felt like home. It felt familiar. And I saw people with sticks they had found and were using as poles, and we always used to do that while hiking too. Now I have real, fancy poles and I love them, but it was nice to reminisce. I started to think about all the AT hikers I had run into, and suddenly realized I was the hiker. These families, coming for the day, were asking me about my trip and seeing me as the AT hiker. It felt really good! 
Another thing people have mentioned that made me think of home happens every time I say I’m from CT; they always say, “you’re going home!” I guess I hadn’t thought about it that way, but yeah, New England is home and even though I won’t pass through my hometown, I will pass through my state and some of my favorite states. I don’t feel too far away in Georgia, but I suppose it is not that close. I did meet a family from New Hampshire today, and they brought their dog ahhhh. I love seeing dogs on the trail. It makes me so happy. Especially the little ones that carry their packs. I can’t wait to have a dog someday. I also could use one for warmth at night! I also met a dog the other day with the trail name “Deeoegee”. Took me a minute, but I enjoyed that haha.
I met a woman from Sweden and a man from Wisconsin on the top of Blood Mountain, and after the rocky descent, ended up at Neel’s Gap. It was like seeing heaven. I was so excited to be there. It had been a tiring, but beautiful day, and I realized I was more sunburned than before and just needed to fix my supplies and everything. Mountain Crossings was great! They had pizza and candy and honestly that just hit the spot. I went right in and asked about the tent and pad and the woman was super helpful. I also realized I probably smell horrible right now, and my face is like a tomato, but I was so happy to have made it there. 
The tent was NOT cheap. I definitely lost some money there. But it’s so nice. It’s a Big Agnes two-person, so it’s nice and roomy! And the company has a great rep. I got a Thermarest pad, which is more durable and won’t have holes, although it’s less thick. It does the trick! I also bought a pizza and Mr. Goodbar. I chatted with a fellow from England and a guy from Boston. Both started two days ago; so they were quite ambitious. They were joking with me because I pulled out everything from my bag as I was planning my purchases and I found out the bottom of my bear bag was still wet from the rain storm. I took out my food to dry it and got a new trail name possibility of “soggy oatmeal”. Yeah no. Chatham showed up and said “no she’s Rudolph!” So I guess my options are set haha. We’ll see if something else comes along.
I bought my new stuff and shipped the old stuff home. It’s amazing, my two-person tent is lighter than my REI one-person! Don’t get me wrong, I love REI, but it was clear that maybe the pricey options would serve me better. 
Chatham was staying at the hostel that was right there, but I figured I had spent enough money, so I walked a mile to Bull Gap. It wasn’t bad hiking, but I was definitely tired, and after you take that pack off, you really don’t want to put it back on. 
I’m very happy with my choice because Bull Gap had plenty of people, including the British guy Johnny and the guy from Boston. I can’t remember his name, but he brought whiskey on the trail and I was so happy. We had a campfire and some whiskey and it was just as I pictured the trail to be. Everyone around a campfire, the sky full of stars, whiskey going around, and laughter. They called me Soggy Oatmeal a bunch and we had a great time. 
Nate helped me hang my bear bag, which takes some getting used to! I think I threw the carabiner 5 or 6 times before finally getting it around the 20-foot branch. I got it though! So far, most of the shelters and sites have had “cables” set up to hang the bear bags or “bear boxes” that seal the food in, so I haven’t had to do it myself, but this campsite had nothing. I must say I’m a huge fan of the bear boxes. If I could put those all over the trail I would, but I was told there aren’t that many of them. The AT Club members that I’ve talked to definitely think they’re the best way to go too, but I don’t know what process they have to go through to get bear boxes placed at all the campsites and shelters. For now I’ll keep chucking my carabiner at a tree and hope it works! Haha. Silly bears could probably get the food anyway. 
At the campfire, one of the people, Boulder, was trying to convince everyone that the world was flat. People were getting into a heated debate and I was just sipping my whiskey. Flat or not, I was enjoying myself. Willow the Mountain Goat built a second fire, close to my tent, so yay warmth! Patches, Passport, Debra, Nate, Johnny, Boulder, and Boston guy all huddled around and cracked up. It was great. There was a man, August, from Texas, but he didn’t join us. We chatted for a bit earlier and he said his pack weighs 55 pounds. Holy moly! Unfortunately he started talking about feminist issues, and though I’m rather neutral these days with politics and stay out of it all, the other women were getting pissed. You meet all kinds of people on the trail and I’m trying my best to reserve judgment and enjoy myself. We can all have our own opinions. I was really just happy to be by the fire. I am interested that people open up so quickly on the trail!
I was disappointed about the amount of money I spent today, and I’m so frugal, it was bothering me. I was a bit disillusioned, thinking about my purpose and goals for this trip. I was able to process through that and hopped into bed. I should’ve gone straight to bed while I was warm from the fire, but I wanted to write this. I bought SmartWool today to keep me warmer at night. It seems to be working, but I’m still cold. I’m worried about the Smokies. I really hope I don’t freeze. For now, I’m way more comfortable and that’s good! Phew it’s been a long day. One more day/night before I can shower and sleep in warmth, although it’s supposed to rain on Sunday. Ugh. I’ll enjoy the weather while I can!

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609167,"This morning I woke up with a puffy face. I’ve never had this kind of reaction before, but my whole face was swollen and puffy. I could barely open my eyes! It was uncomfortable, but I got up and went to get my bear bag. I came back and saw the guys sitting by their tents. I said “guys... my face...” and they all laughed and one said “you are literally a breeding ground for trail names, Soggy Oats... or Puffy”. So my blown-up face has now led to Puffy. Again not taking it yet, but the suggestion has been made haha. I didn’t have any Benadryl, so I packed up and headed off, hoping it would die down. 
I was slow moving to start and the last to leave camp. I really think my puffy face was just irritating me. I ended up making great time and catching up to Nate and Willow the Mountain Goat on a beautiful mountaintop. I passed by August, from last night. He had had a beer and said he was done. I had a clan of four hikers behind me, and that motivated me to move faster and keep going. Sometimes the pressure of people behind me slows me down and I let them pass, but today I let it fuel me. I was racing on the downhills and it felt good! I think I might actually be getting my trail legs! 
That being said, the second half of today was long. It was another 5 miles to camp after I stopped for a granola bar and that 5 miles felt like forever. I had already climbed two mountains and it was discouraging to see that it wasn’t as far as I thought. The last five miles dragged. I stopped for water a few times, but otherwise kept going. It was all up and down. 
Finally I made it to the shelter I’d be staying at. I had the option to stay in the shelter or camp, and with my new tent, I wanted to camp. I set up next to Willow the Mountain Goat and felt completely wiped, but good! Even with my late start, I had finished 10 miles by 3:30pm. I forced myself to eat because unfortunately I haven’t been too hungry. They call it “trail hunger”, but I haven’t gotten it yet. I realized that I’d be resupplying tomorrow and still had food left. I had a peanut butter tortilla and a ton of trail mix. I was pretty full, but made the Mountain House lasagna anyway. It was just noodles and sauce, but it was good. I was really trying to force it down so I could get that protein and calories. All I had eaten through my 10 miles was oatmeal and a granola bar. I can’t wait until I crave food and eat everything I have. I don’t like having to force myself to eat. 
Calories later, I hung my bear bag and got some more water from the stream, and then headed back to my tent. Willow had made a fire and was playing the Lord of the Rings soundtrack and the book on tape. It was awesome! I totally think of LOTR through this whole journey, so it was nice to have that. And the fire was warm and near my tent. I stayed in my tent and chatted with him and Nate. Willow used to be a pro soccer player, which is so cool! He is now retired from that and doing the trail! Nate is from New Hampshire, but works in the Everglades for Outward Bound I believe. Another hiker joined us briefly. His name was Hot Tub, as he believes he can build a natural hot tub with rocks and dirt... he saw me and said “now that’s a fucking woman!” Can’t say I’ve ever gotten that reaction before, but yes, Hot Tub, you are correct. Hello, fucking man! Haha. As it got dark, Willow played “A Sky Full of Stars” and other Coldplay songs and then some bluegrass. The stars really are beautiful at night. You can see so many! It’s a real treat. Sitting there by the fire, listening to music, and looking at the stars was wonderful. I was starting to pass out from exhaustion, but stayed up to enjoy it all. 
I am starting to pass out now, although I just heard some unpleasant noises in the woods and that made me scared. I’m not sure what kind of animal it was. I’ve heard foxes and coyotes and it didn’t sound like that. I am trying to put it behind me and go to sleep. Hopefully the animals leave us alone. Hanging my bear bag, I always think, what are the chances a bear would come rolling through? 
Overall, today was a good day. It was tiring, but ended on a nice calm note. Song of the day was “Out of the Woods” by Taylor Swift. It came on when I was wondering when I’d be at my campsite haha. It was a good jam!

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609210,"Puffy face again!! My skin is really not happy with me! I woke up with a swollen face all over again. I am annoyed about it. It’s definitely an insecurity. I already smell bad and don’t look my best; it just sucks to have that in addition. But I also don’t like having any health issues that persist like that without treating them. I am debating getting some Benadryl in town today, but maybe the rest in a hotel will do the trick and the swelling will go down! I’m really living up to the name “Puffy” haha. 
Despite that, today I was racing. I wanted to make sure I got to Unicoi Gap in time to get a ride. I was planning on hitch-hiking, although I really would’ve loved to avoid that. You can’t really get an Uber from these “gaps” and the taxis and shuttles are very overpriced. $40 to drive me 5 miles? Come on lol. I am not just being frugal here; I will dump so much unnecessary money if I choose that option every time I go to town. That’s $40 each way, so $80 every time I need to go to town! I know the dangers of hitch-hiking, but I was hoping I’d meet some other hikers or people would be parked and I could talk to them before asking for a ride. 
In order to make it there in time while it was still daylight and to enjoy the town of Helen, I headed out at 9am and I was booking it. I made it to Unicoi by 2pm. Getting those trail legs! I must say it still feels long every time. 5 miles, 3 miles, it all feels like a lot. But even though I get discouraged when I’ve only gone three miles or so, I have to remind myself that any mileage is an accomplishment and that I’m pushing my body way past where it’s gone before. When I had reached my highest point of frustration today, I realized I had hiked 7 miles already! That felt really good and it proved that even though I feel like I’m going nowhere, I’m making progress! 
I started to hear cars and was hoping that wasn’t just the wind, but it was indeed cars and I walked down to Unicoi Gap! There was a parking lot with cars and a highway in between. The highway was a bit scary because it was at the top of a hill, so I was worried the cars coming 50 or more mph would not see me and there was no official crossing, just a green sign with walking people on it. I safely got across the road and saw Willow the Mountain Goat and a new man, who I’ve already forgotten the name of. They were talking to this lovely woman named Kelly Johnson, who took a picture of me to show her friend’s daughter, who has always wanted to hike the AT. Glad I could be an inspiration, since I was inspired too back in the day! Kelly offered us all a ride, even though she had a small car. It was perfect! I didn’t need to hitch-hike and I had already had the conversation before the ride offer, so I felt like Kelly was trust-worthy. She was incredibly nice. She said she was on her own adventure for a few weeks. She was in her 60s and was getting bored of the same routine. She was headed to Helen for the night, so it was perfect! 
Kelly dropped Willow off first at his hotel, and then “no-name” and I walked to my hotel. I got into my room and went right for the shower. I stood under the hot water for a while and then took a bath to soak my muscles, especially my feet. I ate, because my desire to get to town was so great I didn’t stop for food today at all and now I was starving. I took another shower to finally cleanse myself, and headed out to dinner. The town of Helen is so cool! I had actually read about it when planning my trip and a lot of people choose to go to Hiawassee, GA instead to resupply. Helen is a more touristy place because it’s all German-style buildings and food! It’s so cool! I love a good tourist place because I love to travel, so I wanted to see this unique place!! It’s so weird; you are driving through Georgia and just arrive in this Bavarian-style town with a windmill and pretzels and stereotypical German things. I joked and said I was going to post a picture and say I had ditched the AT for a trip to Germany! It was definitely a nice atmosphere and a complete change from anything else I’d seen. One kid saw me and exclaimed “you look like you’re going for a hike!” No kidding, kid. Haha. 
Willow the Mountain Goat and I got beer and dinner. It was nice to have company. I must say, the thought of camping on my own or being on my own right now does scare me. I am here to experience this for myself, but at least while I adjust, it’s nice to have the company. I ate so much! Sausage, egg noodles, French fries, potato pancakes, and a pretzel. Ahh it was so good! 
It definitely felt weird to be off the trail and in a town. Everyone was in shorts and T-shirt’s and it looked like a typical summer BBQ, except with the German vibe. I am sad I’m going to miss the whole summer back home. I’m not really looking forward to hiking in the heat, even though I’ve been cold! But I know this journey is worth it. Even talking to Willow and seeing how excited he is about this trail made me realize how special a thing it is. I think I’m dealing with a lot of emotions right now. I’m adjusting physically and mentally to the trail and it’s not easy. I’m going to try to go to sleep now to clear my head of all these thoughts. Thank you again to everyone back home; your support means everything!

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609286,"Ugh today sucked. It was a bad day. I know they happen and I’m getting through it, but I have to acknowledge that it sucked. I ate breakfast and packed up in Helen. I put my pack on and it was considerably heavier. I knew that would happen, so I was okay with that. I was happy to have food and supplies. I met up with Willow and I hitch-hiked for the first time on the AT! I got a ride within 5 minutes of putting my thumb out. The guy’s name was Ryan and he had a cowboy hat on and a truck. There were about five other trucks/jeeps with him and they were all going off-roading. He was super nice and drove us back to Unicoi Gap, chatting about his weight-loss journey and the AT. 
The whole clan of trucks parked at Unicoi and we got out and started hiking. It was so rough getting back on the trail after a day in civilization, and the added weight made it harder. I felt so sluggish the whole first half of the day. And the worst part was that it was cold. Today was so cold and so windy. The wind was blowing on me all day and it was relentless. It was even harder to walk through the trail with the wind like that. I kept hiking for a while despite feeling sluggish and cold, and I finally climbed Tray Mountain, which is beautiful, but maybe more so on a warm day. There was a shelter on top of the mountain, and I originally planned on staying there, but the wind and cold would have surely done me over. I did debate it for a while with another man, Doug, who arrived, but he decided to bail. So did a couple from Maine who arrived as well. I headed down the mountain in search of a campsite or warmth. I was so mentally done. One day out had just thrown me off completely. My body felt fine other than being cold. I was not sore. But mentally I was losing it. I started to cry on the way down because I was so cold and it just hurt. I felt hopeless because the next shelter was 10 miles away and the next campsite was 4 and it was getting dark. I wanted to find people so I could find a fire and warmth and comfort, but I had no idea where everyone would be. I thought they would all be at Tray Mountain shelter, but it was deserted when I finally decided to bail. 
I kept walking and thankfully that warmed me up, but every time I stopped to look for a potential campsite, I got cold again. Finally I came upon a pack of tents and a bunch of people! And a fire! It was wonderful. I set up my tent while I was still warm from walking and I made dinner by the fire. It was still so cold, but that made it better. I had also changed into my sleep clothes and put all my layers on. The final straw to make the day suck happened with bear bagging. Some guys offered to have me put my bag with their’s, which was very nice. It was all too heavy and snapped their rope. I felt bad, although it wasn’t just my bag. There were four on there. I offered them my rope, and went and got it. One guy threw my rope over and it managed to get completely stuck. I now have no rope, which is actually a problem because I can’t hang my bag. And I may find people in the next few days who can help, but if I don’t I’m screwed. I don’t want to sleep with my bag and I don’t want to leave it out. I don’t know what to do. I know the guy was just trying his best to help and make it work, but now I have no rope, and I just resupplied yesterday. Everyone else is going into Hiawassee tomorrow, so they made it sound like “no big deal”. If I go into Hiawassee, I’ll have another day off the trail and another mental adjustment, but also I’ll be behind a day in my scheduling. I do actually have to crush some mileage because I didn’t go where I expected to today and I am meeting my parents in a couple of weeks, so I need to make sure it all works out. I’m definitely not going into town with the guys, but I’m pretty annoyed about what happened. It was such a rough day mentally and it was so cold, and now this. 
I am sorry for the negativity to anyone reading my blog. I really do want to give the realistic picture of what I’m going through. And some days it’s just going to suck. Mentally, physically, supplies/gear, something will be off. I definitely expected challenges, but overcoming them is still a battle. Feeling like I would be camping alone and freezing tonight was such a panic for me. Even though I eventually found people, I had no idea I would, so my mindset was deep into survival/loneliness mode. I felt proud of myself for making a decision to get off that mountain; sitting there wouldn’t fix anything. But I am still annoyed at the turn of events. I am pushing myself emotionally and mentally on this trail more than anything. My body will be fine. But my head just needs to be there too. I am okay with crying to let it all out because I want to accept that I’m feeling shitty and push through it. I need to allow myself to cry and feel that way because it’s how I’m feeling, but I do need to let the practical side step in to get me where I need to be. 
Ugh it’s been a day. I love this trail so much, but I am still battling a lot of my own demons and mother nature’s cold touch. I hope everyone is well back home; again I appreciate the support! I am currently cold in my sleeping bag, but it has been worse (last week with no pad and the rain). I think I’ll be able to sleep, but we’ll see. Praying for a better tomorrow. It is Sunday so I hope God is with me. Maybe he can’t send bear rope to me out of thin air, but some kind of comfort would be good. My dad said they prayed for me at church today. Thank you to all those praying for me. Much love!
Song of the day: “Take Me Home” by Phil Collins. Thankfully my classic rock/throwbacks playlist finally downloaded last night, so I got to listen to this jam this morning, just as I was wanting to go home haha.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609414,"Happy April! Today was long. I started out late because it was still cold when I woke up. I had a lot of mileage to cover. Yesterday I said the plan was to stay at Tray Mountain Shelter. Well the original plan yesterday was to stay at another shelter, Deep Gap, and it would’ve been a 13-mile day. Since I got out of Helen late, I changed my goal to Tray Mountain Shelter. That set everything back of course, so today I wanted to make up some miles. I decided to head for Plumorchard Shelter, even though the original plan was to go even further. I didn’t even calculate the mileage, I just went. I also didn’t know exactly where the site I stayed at was since it was not an official campsite, so I didn’t know where I had started. 
The first half of the day was all uphill. It was quite a climb. There were a couple of guys going up it too and after we all descended, they said that’s the hardest climbing they’ve done so far. It really was tough. It just kept going! At one point I just shook my head because I couldn’t quite believe it was still going uphill. At the bottom of it was Deep Gap, my original plan for the day before. It was nice to hit a mark and know where I was. I had filled up for water at an earlier Gap, but now I was at one I knew. I pushed on to continue to get those miles. I stopped a few times to munch, and found a beautiful campsite with 360 views. I did not stay there.
Today I was feeling particularly lonely and a bit scared. I don’t really know why. I met such amazing, funny people during those first few days, each time willing to start over and do all the introductions. But now that was changing. I was with new people last night and it was nice, but I was so cold and focused on getting set up that I didn’t really get to know them. I remember one guy’s name was Q-tip, and another’s was Matches, and another’s was BBQ. Some of them seemed like they were already a “trail family” or “tramily” and had been hiking together for days. I had officially lost everyone I knew except for Willow, and today I lost him too. He went ahead of me and was planning to stay in Hiawassee. A lot of people were. I felt really lonely and sad having said goodbye to all these lovely people, and I didn’t really want to start over again. 
I hiked on past Deep Gap and got to Dicks Creek Gap, which is where everyone catches the shuttles or rides into Hiawassee. Before I arrived, I was dealing with two guys who were kind of making me mad. They both hiked ahead of me, but kept stopping every few hundred feet to look back or adjust something. I wanted to pass them because that was getting  annoying to follow. I arrived behind them and one of them said, “we thought we’d lost you!” I don’t know, it was just weird. I passed them because of their frequent stopping, but the minute I did they were on my tail and didn’t slow down all the way until Dicks Creek Gap. I felt the pressure and I did not like it. I was not trying to be competitive at all. They were stopping so I passed them. Ugh it was frustrating. At Dicks Creek Gap, some people arrived and then left in a shuttle. It was so tempting, but I decided against it. I ate some snacks and relaxed for a little bit. It was 4:30 when I needed to make my decision: press on or find a campsite near there. 
I decided to press on. I almost immediately regretted it because as I started to climb out of the Gap, my body was aching and didn’t want to keep going. And I didn’t have many hours left of daylight. But I’m a pretty determined person, so I had set my sites on the next shelter and that’s where I was going! I was getting that lonely and scared feeling again. I was racing against the clock and still had 4 miles to go. I was afraid no one would be at the shelter either. I think Willow spooked me this morning because he told me there had been a bear siting at Deep Gap just a few days before. Apparently the bear refused to leave, even with gunshots being fired into the air. When I arrived at my shelter, a man told me that that was a rumor from a year ago on the Guthook app. I don’t have the app because I’d rather just use AWOL and do it that way, but apparently rumors like these can spread easily on the app. Willow must have read the year wrong. Oh well, it just spooked me in addition to not knowing anyone again and feeling lonely. 
I stopped seeing white blazes and started to panic at around 6:20. I really was feeling a lot of emotions in addition to exhaustion and I was worried I’d have to break camp beside the trail. Finally, I saw the wooden sign and I came up to it. It said Plumorchard Gap, with an arrow pointing to the shelter. I was so happy, but also still worried there wouldn’t be people. It was a steep slope down to the shelter, but I heard laughter and I got excited! Humans! I walked up and there was a group of people around a fire. Perfect! It was exactly how I described earlier with “tramilies” and people knowing each other, but they were friendly, showing me where to camp and asking about my day. I got my tent set up and made dinner by the fire. It was getting dark. I stayed cozy by the fire and then headed for my tent. I am now snuggled up in my sleeping bag. It’s much better than yesterday, but it’s still cold. I’m comfy though, and after a really long day of hiking, I’m sure I’ll sleep! 
Also my puffy face is peeling! Ah the lovely stages of sunburn. It is not very ap-peel-ing... hardy har har haha. 
Song of the day: “Stayin Alive” by Bees Gees. It’s one of my all-time favorite songs  and it came on my shuffle when I was hiking that last stretch to the shelter.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609500,"Today had a lot of highs and lows, but overall was a bit of a mental struggle. I knew I’d have that on the trail, but I am still battling with it everyday. I really psych myself out and get into my head. I start to worry about the mileage of the day, my plans for the next few weeks, the weather, the amount of people, bear-bagging, going to the bathroom, getting water and filtering it, etc. It is a challenge for sure to take all of that and center my brain onto the main thing happening. I heard listening to podcasts and zoning out might help me. Right now I listen to music, but it’s still background noise to my thoughts.
I have to consistently work on calming my head. My body really is good. I definitely have blisters on my feet and some soreness, but overall I feel like I can handle a lot of mileage physically. Unfortunately, my pack is quite heavy with food still. I am just not eating enough at all. Tonight when I was hanging my bear bag with some fellow hikers, they all said my bag was really heavy. The problem is that my Mountain House meals involve water, so when I don’t finish them, the trash is heavier, and I have to hold onto that until I can throw it away responsibly. And I have a ton of peanut butter. I normally like peanut butter a lot, but I really am just not hungry. It amazes me. At home I could have several helpings of dinner and have a big appetite, but on the trail I have no appetite. I need the food and the water for energy, and I have been forcing myself to eat it, but I really am not hungry. I can tell the weight of the food is weighing me down. I need to eat or give some away. Trail hunger, please come! I want to eat all of this! 
Anyway, I headed out late because I was cold again. Getting up and moving when it’s cold like that is tough. I was so happy as I left my shelter because I ran into Colt!! Ahh! Colt was from my first shelter so he really feels like part of my original “tramily”. He was so excited to see me too. He’s been injured and slack-packing a bit. We chatted for about 30 minutes. I just wrote about feeling lonely and now I had one of my first buds on the trail show up. I was so happy. He’s got an interesting trail name now... Ball’s Out. There’s a story there... haha. As we were talking, Eric from Litchfield County, CT showed up. Another person from my first day! It was awesome! Eric’s trail name is Two Fingers. These boys I swear. Another story there lol. I’m keeping it clean with Little Debbie. For now. It actually fits me well since I love to bake and make sweets for people back home and I really did take a ton of pastries from the hotel. Haha. 
They all hiked on ahead. My pack felt heavy and I felt cold and mentally wiped, although I was so happy to have seen them. I continued on, stopping a few times to recharge, get water, and chat. I originally planned to go to Standing Indian Shelter today, but it would’ve been another climb and it would’ve been cold. And all the people I was running into said they were going to Muskrat Creek Shelter and I was craving company to get my head on straight. 
A few miles into the day, I arrived at the Georgia/North Carolina border. Colt was there. It was not very exciting; just a sign on a tree. But it felt so good. That was the first goal I had set that would make me feel accomplished. I wanted to cross that border and knock out a state. Today I did it! Yay! Colt took my picture for me and we remarked on how he had taken my picture at Springer on the first day. I took off some layers, as I was sweating a bunch already, but my sweat made me colder, so I ended up putting my layers back on. 
North Carolina brought some heat. And not the temperature. Almost immediately after crossing the border, there were two steep mountains that seemed to go on forever. After skirting the summit of the first with no view, I was so wiped and annoyed. Thanks for the welcome, North Carolina! Haha. Some welcome. Right after that I saw another huge mountain in front of me. Maybe the trail will dive off to the side and miss it, I thought. Nope. The trail went right up it! I do have the AT Guide, AWOL’s book, with me, and it mentions the mountains and elevation, but I think it would drive my mind more crazy to know every single elevation. Maybe not. Maybe it would help. When I plotted out my mileage, I didn’t really take the elevation into account unless I knew it would be tough, like the Whites or the Smokies. I should look at it more. Those climbs today were insane! And both skirted the summit with no view! Lame! The second mountain did have a little lookout point that I stopped at, but the views would’ve been incredible if the top of the mountain offered that 360 look. The lookout was nice, but it didn’t show all of the scenes around me. 
I came down from the second one and was mentally done. I needed to get to the shelter. I found someone else paused for a break and he said the shelter was a half-mile away. I was excited for that, but it was uphill mostly until the shelter. I got way into my head and started to cry again. I rested my head on my trekking poles and just let it out. I had had such success today and I was proud of it, but I had also had such challenge and frustration. I kept going and started to smell that campfire smell! And there it was! My shelter! People! Ahh. 
I walked in and found a spot near Colt and Eric. I put my tent down and changed into my sleep clothes. I sat in my tent and tried to snack on my food to lighten the weight as I chatted with Colt and Eric. I got up eventually and brought my food to the fire. I made noodles and again tried to finish them all, unsuccessfully. I was having a blast talking with everyone though! They are all calling me Little Debbie because some of them were from the campsite the other night. Giggles came up again as a suggestion though. So we’ll see! I was sitting so close I had smoke in my eyes and on my body, but I didn’t care. It was so warm. 
Everyone wanted to see the sunset, so I went along. I sat in the grass on top of a ridge and watched. It was beautiful, and I’m sure on a warmer night, that would’ve made for a gorgeous campsite. Ty went up into a tree haha and got an incredible view, and I snuggled with the doggie, Buck. Such a sweet dog! I wanted to bring him into my tent for warmth! Truly a good boy. Haha. Colt and Eric had made a fire near our tents, which I was happy about! They had tried to hang my bag, but it was too heavy. I have to eat more food. Tomorrow morning is gonna be a big breakfast haha. Whether I want it or not! They helped me hang it. True lifesavers. Bear-bagging is truly tough. Q-tip spent 45 minutes throwing the rock over and missing, and throwing it over again and missing. I honestly really dislike having to do it. I mentioned before that I liked the bear boxes. Well they really are genius. I knew they wouldn’t have them past Georgia, but they really should. People do such a terrible job bearbagging and there are embarrassing pictures on the internet of it. And the bears are way smarter than this method. Anyway, Colt and Eric are pros, so my bag was up in no time. I left my water filter inside by accident, I hope it doesn’t freeze tonight. 
I stood by the fire with Colt, Wobbles, and Tinder (also a story there haha) and chatted as it died down. I’m now snuggled in my bag writing this. I am anxious about tomorrow. My mind was relaxed tonight and I was laughing and enjoying myself with all the people at the shelter, but I know the mileage and stress of tomorrow will eat away at me. I’m going to try to start out better and really focus in on the goal right ahead of me rather than miles ahead or days ahead. I can do this! What a mental challenge the AT is though.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609508,"Today was good! Yay! I had a long day planned and knew there would be a challenging mountain in there, Standing Indian. I keep starting too late. I’m so wiped that without an alarm, I’ll wake up at 8:30, even if I went to bed at 8. I have to get up earlier so I can start hiking earlier and get to camp and set up. I left at around 10am. I went pretty slowly this morning, mainly for my head. I needed to take deep breaths and calm myself so I wouldn’t get frustrated early on. It actually worked quite well, except that because I was going slowly, I knew I’d have a late day. I got to Standing Indian and ate a Clif bar, but I was anxious for the climb. It was probably the longest climb I’ve ever done. Long and slow. I can’t tell whether I prefer a long and slow climb or a short and steep one. I think short and steep actually. 
I stopped frequently to give my mind and body a break. I took some advice from Wobbles last night and set smaller goals for myself. Get to that next root up that small incline, stop for water at that tree. I ran into a whole pack of trail ambassadors/ATC members. They were all very nice and asked me about my trip, although the women were extra cautious with advice about me and “creepy men”. That spooked me a bit since I haven’t really met any creepy people. I’ve loved everyone I’ve met and we’ve been yucking it up! I know there are creepy people and I know that hitchhiking as a woman and camping alone as a woman has its risks, but I stick with people because I feel safer that way. And I think I’d have an idea when someone was creeping me out. But ugh, they got me in my head again with these thoughts! They told me the trail skirted the summit, but that there was a trail up to the summit. A lot of these AT mountains “skirt the summit”. What’s that all about? Spent half my day climbing a mountain and never saw a view? 
I was grateful for their advice. I would’ve skipped that “side trail”. And when I got to that, the whole clan of people from last night was there and they all said there was “no view”. I told them what I had heard, but they were all wiped and ready to head out, so I went up the side trail on my own. Sure enough, there was an incredible view. It was truly spectacular. I sat on the rock face and stared at it for a while, just taking it in. Someone else came up, but none of the people I knew. 
I headed down the trail and it was the longest downhill I’ve ever done too. A lot of it was actually just walking on top of the mountain on flat ground, and then it went down. What a big mountain. Sheesh! I stopped at the bottom to check the mileage and have a snack. Overall it had been a bit rocky and the slow incline was annoying, but it was a gorgeous mountain and a good way to kick out half of the day’s mileage.
I only had three more miles to go, and it was all flat or downhill, which was nice. It was really rough terrain though. A ton of roots and rocks and stream-crossings. I saw a few people camped along the side, and then ran into a woman lying on the trail with her feet up. She was a mood haha. It’s tempting to just lie down on the trail and throw my pack everyday haha. Her name was Spare Change. I hiked ahead and before I knew it, was at my shelter. 
It always feels so good to arrive at my shelter. I see the tents and the people and smell the campfire and I get pumped. It was around 6pm given my late start, slow morning pace, and stops. I set up my tent and started snacking. I finally started to feel more hungry today! A little bit more! Yes! 
I filled up my water and filtered it and then went to deal with this bearbagging situation. Spare Change was hanging her bag at the same time, so she helped me. I don’t know if I can do this alone haha. Especially without rope, but also just arm strength to throw, not getting it tangled or stuck, and not breaking the rope or branch. She threw the rock over and got it on the second try. I left my line up while I ate, which is often what people do. I ate Mountain House lasagna and I finished the whole thing! Yay hunger! I was happy. 
I hung my bag, again needing help to tie the special knot they use in the PCT method. Such a process! I realized I still had trail mix in my pocket and there was no way I was taking that bag down, so I ate it and shared it with people. There’s a pretty sad looking bearbagging job here tonight. It’s like two feet off the ground. Don’t really know what that accomplishes, as a bear can easily reach up and take that down, but it makes me feel better about my struggles with this process! Bear boxes, please follow me! 
I am now in my tent getting ready for bed. I’m warm and cozy in my bag tonight. I may have left my water filter in my food bag again and it’s worrying me, but I’ll check in the morning. 
Also I’m sorry if I’ve taken a while to get back to you or respond to comments while on the trail. I keep my phone in airplane mode all day and just use Spotify Premium, and then when I want to check in, I turn airplane mode off and it immediately begins to suck the battery. Sometimes I’ll send a text or make a post, and then turn airplane mode back on. I have an external battery that has up to four charges on it, but only want to use it when I know I can charge it too! Anyway, just wanted people to know! I have a lot of social media catching-up to do! I type these journal entries in the notes app while my phone is in airplane mode and then I turn it off, post them, and turn it back on again.

",Carter Gap Shelter,"Apr 03, Wed",12.50
Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609777,"Today was amazing!! It was sunny and warm, and I officially reached 100 miles! This morning I headed out from Carter Gap, late as I have been. I really need to get moving! Ugh. Despite that, I had a great morning hike with some incredible views. I climbed over one mountain that was called “Big Butt”. Haha. That was a scary climb for a moment because I looked down and realized I was on the edge of this ridge, with a rocky cliff below me. It wasn’t like that the whole climb, but for a bit it was. I didn’t summit that mountain, but I did summit the next one. 
Albert Mountain was a beast, but such a fun climb. It was steep and short and involved some rock scrambling, but I loved it. I really preferred that over Standing Indian’s ridiculously slow climb. At one point I definitely had to put my poles aside and use my hands, but I do want to give a shout-out to my poles because I love these things. They’re amazing. They’ve probably saved me 20 times at this point with all the root-trips I’ve made and they definitely help me push down on some of the steep steps while climbing. 
At the top of Albert Mountain was this awesome firetower. If you all remember, Murris was talking about fire towers on my first day and saying I needed to check them out for the best views. This one was definitely awesome. The climb was really scary though; it was a very shaky metal staircase and it was quite windy as you climbed up. I climbed it twice because I wanted to use my GoPro to mark this special accomplishment, since the 100-mile mark was here, and I had to go back and get it! The views were spectacular. 360 views like that are something to remember. I spent a long time just taking it in, but freezing as well because it was so windy. 
I had some snacks at the bottom of the fire tower and then began the descent of the mountain. It was a nice downhill for a while, and there was another marker that said 100 miles made out of sticks, and one written in paint on a rock. I don’t know what the official 100-mile mark was, but I know that I hit it today and it felt amazing. I have never hiked that many miles! I’ve biked it, but haven’t hiked it. It was so great. I reached the first shelter that some people were staying at around 3:30pm, but decided to hike on to the next one so I’d have less hiking to do in the rain the next day. I met Steady Eddie, who was in his 70s I think and had hiked 16 miles that day. Impressive man!
Unfortunately there was a little downside to the day at this point. I ran into this lovely couple who I had chatted with at the top of Albert Mountain, Swamp Cat and Green Knight. We were chatting about resupply and I was talking about needing new bear rope and maybe a new bag (unfortunately mine has some rips, I think from the weight). I was commenting on how hard bearbagging is for me, and they were agreeing, saying they had gotten bear canisters (plastic containers that don’t need to be hung). A girl was next to us and she said “bear bagging is so easy. I’ve never had a problem”. I don’t know, it just really upset me. I’m insecure about this camping thing that may seem like standard practice to everyone, but to me it’s not at all. I really can’t throw; my strength has always been in my legs. So trying to throw a rock perfectly over a 20-foot branch is tough for me, and especially if there are other bushes and branches in the way. I know I’m not alone in this because the guy who got my rope stuck managed to get the rock stuck in the tree and the rope twisted. And a lot of what I’ve seen is just plain fails, as I was talking about with the bag hang that was a few feet off the ground. There was one 5 feet above my tent tonight. A bear could’ve easily snatched that and landed on my tent lol. 
Anyway, I just find the process really annoying and I have to validate myself that it is annoying because it’s probably the thing I dislike about the trail most. The girl who said it was easy may find it easy, and that’s fine for her, but I’m going to feel the way I feel about it. Someone commented on my post and said they’d remember me as “the person with bearbagging issues”. Well great. You can join me on the trail and do all my hangs for me if it’s that easy! Ugh. That person did leave nice comments in addition and I appreciate that, but it’s hard to be struggling with this.
I must say, the girl’s comment really got my mind going, as it tends to do. I’ve noticed that all of my friends on the trail are guys. And yes, there are more guys than girls on the trail, but still, I’m closer with the guys. Today when I got to the summit of Albert Mountain, all of them were in the fire tower and they called out my name and cheered for me and took pictures. It made me feel awesome and I felt great to have such wonderful people by my side. But they’re all guys. I definitely feel more reserved with girls because I just have had way too much drama and painful experiences there, but it would be nice to be friends with some of the female hikers too. I just got to thinking about it all because that girl’s comment made me feel insecure and inferior to her, when the guys actually made me feel validated when they got my rope stuck and were having trouble. Hoping I meet some more girls on the trail who I can become close with too.
After that insecurity funk that followed such an incredible high, I went on to my shelter. I arrived around 5, with plenty of time to set up and eat before the rain. I set up next to Colt, which I found funny because we slept next to each other last time it rained too! I was excited to see how my tent would do! The ultimate test of my new tent! I made a Mountain House meal, but could not finish it. I needed help again with my bear bag ugh. Q-tip was awesome and helped me hang it. It was getting dark and the rope kept coming undone, so we left it pretty low on a tree, but there wasn’t too much food left in there anyway. Q-tip had a lot of trouble the other night, throwing his rope at a tree branch for 45 minutes, and now he helped me, so maybe I will get this thing down eventually too. Q-tip’s mom called him and it was truly hilarious to hear some of the stories she told. Q-tip is 18 and graduated from high school early just to do this. He is from Vermont and was a huge gamer before this and built his whole gaming system from scratch. His mom complained about how much time he spent on technology and his response was to buy a ton of gear and leave for the trail. He’s a great kid and reminds me of some goofy kids his age that I know. I stayed warm by the fire and then went to bed. It was warm and cozy in my tent, but I had no service to write or celebrate my 100 miles, so I just went to bed. 
I could hear the rain start and was praying I’d stay warm and dry. I had a nice time hanging with my trail friends today and a great success too! Here’s to a shower and bed tomorrow!

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609788,"Rain rain go away... so the result of my tent test was good! Unfortunately a little water got through into the tent, but overall everything was dry and I was warm and that’s a huge plus. The only problem was... taking down the tent in the rain! First I put everything in my bag and put the rainproof cover on it, and then ran that down to the shelter, so all of that was dry. Then I managed to take the stakes and poles out and let the rain fly flatten on the tent, and then I pulled the tent out from underneath and it stayed dry! I brought that to the shelter. The rain fly was a muddy wet mess, as was the tarp underneath, but I rolled both up and brought them down. My bear bag was just a disaster altogether, but I took it down and brought that in. I squeezed out as much water as I could from everything and packed my bag inside the dry shelter. It was yet again a late start for me, partly because I was sitting in my tent hearing the pouring rain and dreading getting out of the tent. But because I was late, I had the shelter to myself to assemble my wet stuff. A lot of people actually left straight from Rock Gap, but I wanted to walk to the next pickup because I could get those miles out of the way. 
Two people showed up, smoked weed, and left. There is a lot of weed on the trail in general. Everyone is smoking it every night. There’s alcohol too, but I have noticed a lot of weed. I finished packing up and walked the four or so miles. I met some other hikers. It wasn’t too bad hiking in the rain. I was actually too hot in all my rain gear. But I was dry and my pack cover kept my pack dry. It stopped raining halfway into my hike and was just a drizzle/mist at that point. There was one climb today, but it leveled out after and was a nice, flat, winding path down to Winding Stair Gap. My phone was almost dead so I was a little anxious. I called my hostel several times without an answer. 
Finally, the owner, Zen, picked up and said he could get me, but that he needed to drive someone else quite a distance. I said I’d be fine coming along because it meant a warm, dry car and eventually a shower/hostel stay. The hiker was Joe and he was slackpacking, so we dropped him off an hour away from Winding Stair Gap and then drove back to Franklin. Because of the detour, I didn’t get to Franklin until the afternoon, but it worked out. Zen actually miscalculated his bunks and had another person calling about a bunk, so he offered me this other option, that was an Airbnb down the street that his friend owned. I was receptive. It was more expensive, but it meant a big bed, TV, and my own bathroom. Zen drove me there and I met his friend, who was very nice. The Airbnb was super clean and it had a porch, so I dried out my tent on the porch. I took a shower immediately to get warm, but didn’t really wash until later. I just needed that hot shower. I checked in with everyone, lay out my wet clothes outside, cleaned my bear bag out, washed my stove, charged my electronics, and then headed over to pick up my mail drops and drop off my laundry. 
When I got there, they were simmering a sauce for pasta and preparing garlic bread. I was pumped. One of my favorite meals! I grabbed some “lend clothes” and looked quite funny, and then left for a bit and went into town to get a new bear bag and rope. There’s a great store, Outdoor 76, that sold me new rope and a sturdy, waterproof bag. I was so tempted to buy an ursack because you can just tie those to a tree, but I got the bag and rope because the owner said ursacks didn’t work very well and the bear can still get the food. They gave me a hiker discount and a free bandana, and I signed the official Class of 2019 banner!
I headed back to the hostel and they had dinner ready. Ahhh pasta! I ate so much and the meat sauce was really good. And that garlic bread omg. It was all amazing. I had some salad too haha. Zen brought me my clean laundry. It smelled amazing. Wow it’s been a while since I’ve had clean clothes! I brought it back to my Airbnb and organized my food and clothes. I then went back to the hostel to get ready to go on a Walmart trip with everyone. Yay Walmart! 
This was honestly the biggest Walmart I’ve ever seen. I got a 50 cent Pepsi outside and was so happy lol. I bought more sunscreen, Sensodyne toothpaste (omg my teeth have been suffering without it, it’s worth the weight), and mini alcohol bottles for the next few nights. I need propane, but Walmart only had huge things of it so I’ll wait until the NOC. 
After I got back I dropped all my stuff off at my Airbnb. It was late, around 9:30ish, but I really wanted to check out this brewery nearby because I want to take advantage of all that the towns have to offer me. I walked to the brewery and got a beer and all of my trail friends were there! They shouted “Little Debbie” and hugged me and pulled me onto the couch with them. It made me so happy. My people! They were pretty toasted, but I didn’t mind. We danced to the music in the Lazy Hiker Brewery and told funny jokes and it was just awesome! 
I left around 11 and walked back to my Airbnb. I planned out the next few weeks because my schedule is a little off. I packed everything up and got into bed to finish planning. I was totally wiped, but I needed to get some planning done. I actually got a lot done overall. I hiked in the morning, walked to the store, did laundry and hung my tent, had dinner with everyone, went to Walmart, and went to the brewery. Overall a successful day! 
Excited to lie on this memory foam mattress and pass out! Night!

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609860,"On today’s episode of “Diana hates bearbagging”... haha. I was back in the woods today! I woke up so unbelievably comfy in that memory foam mattress and decided to take another shower to feel extra clean. I made sure everything was packed away and clean and headed over to the hostel. Zen drove a bunch of us up to Winding Stair Gap and I shared the front seat with another girl, Lexi. Once we arrived, everyone took off and started hiking. I had skipped breakfast, so I sat down to eat before starting my hike. 
Zen sat with me and read some Buddhist book with quotes like “your feelings. Throw them away.” I’d have a hard time with that book. I have a lot of feelings and they don’t get thrown away lol. I’m an expert at hiding them until I explode, but I’ve gotten better about opening up and expressing my opinions and thoughts about everything. Progress! Just after I finished eating, a woman showed up, handed me money, and left! My first trail magic on the AT! That was so nice of her! Her name was Willow. 
After that, a whole family came by with their truck and set up tables and a grill. They made hot dogs and had a bunch of snacks. Unfortunately, I had just eaten, but I had a hot dog and chatted with them. The man grilling is a grandpa and he hiked the AT last year! An awesome man. They were all so nice. There was a couple with a little toddler, the grandson, and he was just adorable. He kept putting a whoopie cushion on everyone’s chairs and giggling. What amazing trail magic! I was so thankful. Also, Houston, we have HUNGER!! Ahhh!! Today I ate three meals with snacks and plenty of water! I was hungry!! Finally! I wanted to eat all of my food! 
I finally left the trail magic setup to start hiking, as it was getting late to start my day. I met a couple from Pittsburgh at the trail magic, and they started hiking at the same time as me. Incredibly friendly people! I can’t quite imagine hiking with a boyfriend because my personal hike is to find and challenge myself, but hike your own hike! I guess their relationship will really stand the tests! 
The hiking today involved a lot of slow uphill, which I am not a fan of haha. But it was a beautiful day. It was so warm! I had to stop and put on sunscreen and take off my layers. After a while, I reached this clearing that was a “Bald” or grassy hill. I took my pack off and walked up. It was an awesome 360 view, but there were a lot of people and it was hard to get pictures without people in them. 
I walked down and ate lunch at the bottom of the grassy hill. I ate so much! Yay! Full of food and happy, I headed off. I stopped at a stream for a water refill and saw that guy from Kentucky, Damon, and his dog, Riley. I kept going and stopped again midway through a rough uphill. More trail magic! OMG! Someone left a bunch of bottled water there, so I took one and drank it empty right then and there! It was a hot day today. I’m glad I hydrated. 
It felt like a long way up to Wayah Bald, and I ran into that couple from Pittsburgh a few times, as well as a man named Robinhood. Because I had gotten started late with the trail magic, I was hiking pretty late into the day. When I got up to Wayah Bald, it was already 6pm! 
That view though. Wow. It actually took my breath away. And taking off my pack, that always sends me flying every which way. Wobble wobble wobble haha it’s the best feeling though. There was a tower at Wayah Bald, but you didn’t even need it for a good view. I walked up it anyway and just sat there. It was so peaceful and beautiful. This is what it’s all about! I live for these views. It’s actually one of my favorite things when I travel. I always want to go up in the towers or lookouts. It’s just wonderful to be up so high and see so far. It just makes me so happy. And I do get scared of heights, especially with that shaky metal fire tower the other day, but it’s so worth it for the view. 
The lovely couple from earlier arrived. The guy’s name is Chad and the girl’s is Lauren, but her trail name is Mountain Laurel. She’s so nice and I’m so glad I met them both! They headed down to the shelter and I followed, but it was getting late so I was quite anxious. It was all downhill to the shelter, but my pack was heavy from resupply and I was tired. I knew I’d have to set up camp and hang my freaking bear bag and was not looking forward to doing that so late at night. It was past 7 when I arrived at camp. I set up my tent very quickly, I’m getting good at this haha, but bearbagging was a real struggle. At this point I am starting to find my struggle comical, but last night I was not having it. I probably threw my rock bag 20 times, went and collected it, tried again, got a foot below the branch, got it tangled in other branches, broke branches, and finally got the stupid rope up in a branch that was definitely not high enough. Honestly I want to just be Katz from a “A Walk in the Woods” and just grab a bunch of chocolate bars and hop into my tent and call it a day. The bears can have it! Ugh. I cursed at the line of rope. One benefit of the woods, you can get mad with no one around! Haha. I remained calm though and got my rope up, and then went and ate. I was hungry so I ate a lot, but it was getting dark. 
There were some people from the hostel who were staying at that shelter. There was Polar Bear, Red Wiggler, Jeffrey (Ringer), Lexi, Johnny (the English guy from earlier on, I was so happy to see him! His name is now Honey Buns), and another girl I can’t remember the name of. Ringer is the man! He’s so freaking nice. I’m not sure how old he is, but he seems parent-age. He’s truly one of the nicest people I’ve ever met. He saw my bearbagging struggle and came and helped me hang it. He taught me all the knots, but I forgot them. He told me he’d practice with me again. Such a sweet man. 
I felt good and went to bed with one of my mini alcohol bottles as it started to rain. I passed out writing this journal haha so I’m finishing it a day later. I did hang around the fire for a bit, but was quite wiped and it was already so late. I enjoyed today. Some moments of anxiety and frustration for sure, but incredible views and nice people. I didn’t see my original trail family clan, but I was making new friends and was having to keep moving. Mentally I actually did just fine getting back out there. I was worried while eating the hot dog, surrounded by people and cars and civilization, but I really did just fine. My pack was heavier and I could feel that stress on my back, but it was a good stress because I had food I was excited about and I was clean and rested. And there was so much trail magic in one day and it was the first I had experienced; it was wonderful!

",Wayah Bald Shelter,"Apr 06, Sat",11
Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609869,"Today was all over the map emotionally. I had a vivid dream about my old boyfriend last night, so naturally that was on my mind all morning. And I’m not really surprised because it’s still recent and painful, but it made my heart hurt. I hiked with two couples today throughout the day and it just made me realize how much I miss that companionship. Not only is it nice for set up because both people do the work and make dinner and hang the bag, but it’s nice for company. The couple from Pittsburgh (the girl is from there, but they met in film school and want to move to Pittsburgh together) have been together for a while and they seemed happy and in sync. 
It was a lonely morning and I listened to one of my favorite songs, but it made me cry. It wasn’t the trail or the mental frustration this time, it was just plain sadness and heartache. Comes with the process of life I guess! Still not fun to go through. It’s also that time of the month so I’m extra emotional haha. I ate thin mints at breakfast to cheer me up lol. Chocolate therapy does wonders! 
After my sad morning, I ran into that same girl that made the “bearbagging is easy” comment and I realized she was hiking with two super intense guys. They were all so buff and one guy looked sculpted. I prefer the human-looking men haha. Am I in Florence staring at the David or am I on the trail? Will keep you posted. Anyway, I realized she was a bit more intense anyway, and it made me calm down a bit with my insecurity situation. Lauren is a lovely girl and I met another from the hostel who is also nice. I also ran into Spare Change and she was so friendly too! There’s hope for some female friends after all! 
After the bulky sculpture humans, I arrived at a shelter that was right in the middle of the mileage I planned to go. Mountain Laurel and Chad were there, as well as Polar Bear and someone else I didn’t catch the name of. And guess who showed up?!?! Q-TIP!! I was so happy! He’s that kid from Vermont. He’s awesome! We were laughing because he actually went and bought the exact same bear bag that I got in Franklin and he had everything in ziploc bags like me, and we both had Haribo gummy bears, which are the best. Twinsies!! I had the best lunch surrounded by such wonderful people. I didn’t even need chocolate therapy then. I headed out again and kept running into Polar Bear a few times. I was thinking about him a lot actually because he’s 55, but has never been married and lives alone. It sounds like a really lonely life, and I don’t mean to judge at all, but I personally could never imagine not having a family. I need that companionship and love. I’m glad he’s found us all on the trail so we can provide that company. He’s actually had some scary moments and I worry for him. At home he had a stroke, and with no one there had to make his way to his parents’ house. On the trail, he was brought off a mountain with hypothermia, and last night he fell out of his hammock straight onto his arm. The poor man.
I was very happy to run into Two Fingers after seeing Polar Bear! He is now Three Fingers. Oh boy. Despite his name, he’s really a great guy and he’s from CT, so home! I also ran into Unicorn, a rather loud, no-filter, rambunctious girl. She reminds me of myself, but even I’ve calmed down a lot and learned to filter myself a bit more. She is on the trail with her boyfriend and he was not in a good mood, but she called him an “ass” and it made me think of how far I’ve come in understanding people and situations and I would’ve just given him space and come back later to check in on him. I was putting up my tent today and left the rain fly off to dry because it was still wet from this morning, but then it started to rain, so I ran and got my fly and got it on my tent in time, but Unicorn was just watching and laughing, saying “better get your fly on there!” No kidding haha maybe you could help me or just leave me alone rather than standing and laughing? Lol. Nice girl, but a bit hard to take at times. I really hope I don’t sound mean or judgmental; I’m just trying to take everything and everyone in, and some people interest me in the way they go about situations, as I am still young and trying to navigate a lot on my own! 
Unicorn, her boyfriend, Chad and Lauren, Polar Bear, and Two Fingers all headed forward with me and we reached the top of Wesser Bald, with another fire tower! The view would’ve been spectacular, but it was unfortunately quite cloudy. There was a view, but not a great one. The tower was wood at the top with no inside area like the other one, but it was cool. A lot of people had carved their names into the wood. I didn’t stay long because I knew it was going to rain and everyone else was headed for the shelter. With a better view I would’ve stayed a while. There was a creepy pile of camp stuff just sitting there and Mountain Laurel commented that she was worried someone just abandoned it and was hurt or something. We could’ve assumed all day, but I didn’t really want to get my head going with what creepy reason could be behind the abandoned pile. 
I left and walked down with everyone. I got to camp in plenty of time to set up. I ate a Mountain House meal of Chicken Teriyaki, but it’s not my favorite. I had some sweets and alcohol and these really spicy nuts that I bought for myself back home because they have those crunchies that they give you at a bar and I love those things. Ahh crunchies! So good. 
There were bear cables, thank the Lord. I didn’t have to hang my bag, although the bear cables were pretty full, so it took two boys and me to heave all the bags up. 
I’m now in my tent all warm and dry, but there’s a thunderstorm going on outside. The lightning keeps flashing my tent. It’s peaceful to listen to though and I’m warm and tired. I hope tomorrow isn’t too nasty of a day. 
Song of the day that made me cry this morning: “Sailboat” by Ben Rector. It really is a beautiful song. I love music by him, but this one is a true gem. I played it several times and had a good cry.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609978,"The weather lies! This morning I woke up warm and dry and it wasn’t raining, so I was able to pack up and have breakfast, but I knew there was more rain coming and I was not looking forward to it. I got out of camp around 9:30. The start of the day was a bit uphill, but there were some pretty steep downhills after that. It wasn’t too slippery from last night’s storm, but it was steep and rocky. I was making good time. I was not sure what I was going to do because I knew the rain was coming around 1pm, and I’d definitely be at the NOC by then, but I wouldn’t be at the shelter I planned by then. I didn’t mind getting caught in the rain after the NOC, especially if I had had a dry morning and gotten there quickly.
Unfortunately, the weather did not follow the forecast and it started raining around 10:30. I reacted quickly and got my rain coat on and my pack cover on, but I figured maybe it wouldn’t be too bad, so I didn’t dig for my rain pants. Bad decision there. It poured. There was thunder and lightning and I was caught up on this ridge in the middle of it all. In one aspect it was cool, but it was also really scary. It was all still steep downhill, so coming down that in the pouring rain was rough. It was puddling into a muddy slip-and-slide and I was drenched. At this point I was thinking I’d stop at the NOC and dry off and then play it by ear. 
Without my rain pants, my socks and shoes got completely soaked. They might’ve anyway because it was raining so hard, but it was uncomfortable. I continued to walk down the muddy path and it felt like I was walking in buckets of water. I was worried about my feet and getting them dry so I wouldn’t get more blisters.
At one point, it was so miserable being in that rain, that I started to sing along with my music. I’ve never done that in the woods and definitely have struggled with stage fright my whole life. But I felt alone and free to sing out. It was pretty funny because the English guy Johnny (Honey Buns) came up right behind me as I was singing and I was taken aback and a bit embarrassed. He was friendly and just kept on hiking. I reached a shelter that was one mile from the NOC and was feeling good, but still soaking. I slipped once in the mud and thankfully my poles saved me. A lot of the trail today was on the ridge, so when I slipped, my foot slid down the side of the ridge and that was nerve-wracking. I kissed my poles haha those things are the best. 
I arrived at the NOC and found a bunch of hikers, all soaked from the rain and taking off their layers and shoes under the overhang. I joined them and saw Mountain Laurel and Chad again. I took off my shoes immediately for the sake of my feet. I went inside to ask about pricing, but I really didn’t want to stay. I felt like I could push on and I really didn’t want to change my plans, but I was soaked and my stuff was soaked and it was only going to get worse. 
I found Red Wiggler, Ringer, Kacy, Lexi, Honey Buns, and Polar Bear in one of the restaurants and they told me they had an extra space in their cabin that they rented. I had spent too much time going back and forth on what to do that I decided to just go for it and stay with them. The whole time I had a feeling that I shouldn’t and that it would push me back so much, but I had to think ahead of how miserable I’d be setting up in the rain, already soaked. And the bunkhouse at the NOC offered a bunk with no linens and no towel so had I decided to pay to stay there, I wouldn’t have gotten any amenities anyway. At least the cabin offered a homey space with beds and a hot tub. I’d have to share a bed with someone and I was not crazy about that idea because I don’t really know this group too well. I’m kind of bouncing from trail family to trail family. But I went ahead with it and stuck with my decision. 
The ladies running the cabin service really overcharge in my opinion. They charge $20 each way for the shuttle (it’s a 5-min drive) and don’t have any laundry here. It’s an okay cabin, but I’m not blown away by it. Everyone kept saying “omg yeah we’re getting a cabin and it’s going to be epic”, but it’s really just a few small bedrooms, a bathroom, and a hot tub. I don’t mean to complain; I guess I just was feeling off about my decision all day and the cabin didn’t make me feel like “wow that was an awesome decision”. There was barely room to spread out and dry things and with no laundry, it was just not great. 
I will say, the hot tub was amazing. I love hot tubs, but haven’t been in many in my life. This one was great. We all showered before getting in it so we were all clean. We had beers and relaxed. I spent my whole afternoon in that tub and it’s the closest to a “zero” day that I’ve gotten. I probably needed it honestly, but I’m still stressed about planning. I put my feet against the jets to massage them and put my back against the jets too. Whole body relaxation. 
I had bourbon too, and we made chocolate chip cookies and ordered pizza. Ringer, that awesome man I wrote about before, was super generous (he paid for the whole thing, even though we’re paying him back and he paid for the cookies and delivery situation) and told us all sorts of crazy stories about his life. He’s awesome!  
Again, there was a lot of weed going around. I did not partake, but it was interesting to see everyone getting toasted and asking questions like “describe yourself in 6 words” or “what is your ideal self?” Although I wasn’t high, it led to a lot of deep conversations about relationships and love and life and it was nice. I find myself opening up a lot to these people even though I just met them! And Red Wiggler had a very similar situation to mine with his relationship, and his girlfriend also went and saw a therapist and had changed for the better, so it was nice to relate there, and to hear that he gave her another chance. 
I chatted with them all for so long that I was definitely starting to get tired of conversation, and headed to bed. My stuff is all still so wet. Ugh. I am sleeping next to Lexi tonight. Unfortunately, she came right into the room and turned the fan on. She’s from Florida and I guess was hot? Lol. I’m still wet from the day and the towels we had all got soaked too, so I am really not liking this fan. Brought me back to college roommate days. I’m way more direct these days, but what’s the point of complaining about the fan when I’m so tired and it’s one night? Oh well. 
I’m happy with my decision and really bonded with these people, but it was hard for me to go off trail today and make that call. And I’m still not dry, nor is my stuff. I do have reservations in Fontana in a few days, so I’m looking forward to that, but it’ll be some long days of hiking. Hopefully my rested body is ready for it. Popped my first blister today, but otherwise I’m doing well! 
Song of the day: “We Find Love” by Daniel Caesar. Love is on my mind, as it was yesterday morning and today with the deep conversations. It’s a great song and it’s what I was singing to today.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610037,"Ahhhh finally settled and writing this. What a long day. We got out of the cabin at 10am. They planned that because they all wanted a slow start, but it made me anxious. The drivers were late and showed up at 10:15. We got down to the NOC and I was debating what to do in terms of mileage. I was quite emotional this morning again. Whew it’s been a lot of crying lately haha. But the weather was good and I needed to get going so I did, around 11:30.
The day would consist of a lot of uphill and I knew that while at the NOC. It was going to be a lot of climbing. Most people planned to stay at Sassafras Gap Shelter, which was about 7 miles from the NOC, but uphill the whole way. Because I’m a day behind in my scheduling since I stayed at the cabin, I had to figure out a new plan, and that was to stay at Brown Fork Shelter. It would be a 16 mile day. Unfortunately, because of our late start, I kind of knew that it might not be possible, at least not possible in daylight. 
I took my time through the 7 miles of uphill, and mentally I was doing well. I knew it was coming and I was going for it. I stopped for water at a great water source, but it was like a mini waterfall, so I got a little wet trying to fill my Platypus bag. Honey Buns and Red Wiggler showed up. I was really happy to see them. Red Wiggler told me he’d cry with me anytime if I needed a cry buddy. He’s so nice. I guess I must have looked upset, because a man walked by me and said “smile, God loves you”. 
I met a few other people there and was on my way. I ate a Clif bar, but had skipped breakfast because of the cabin/timing situation. I finally reached Sassafras Gap Shelter (there are so many Sassafras Gaps and Mountains on this trail haha) and it was about 4pm. I joked with people I met about eventually climbing into space at this rate haha so much climbing! I knew it would be tough to make it 9 more miles to the shelter by dark, but I pressed on. 
I saw Unicorn and her boyfriend, NAB, again. Unicorn again lacked a filter and was calling me crazy or messed up for trying to keep walking today. I told her about the NOC and being back a day and she said “well you asked for it then”. I didn’t ask for it lol I made a judgment call and I think it was a good one. And I’m alright with big mileage days as a result. But her comments really irritated me. She and her boyfriend actually pressed on as well, but only for a mile or so up to the top of Cheoah Bald. There was a flat place with the stones for a fire there, so they wanted to camp up there. I definitely have wanted to camp at a place like that where I can see the sunset with a view and the sunrise with a view. 
As annoyed as I was by her comments, I discussed the mileage with her and she said there was a campsite three miles ahead. I pushed on, but it felt like a long trek. And I must say, the trail maintenance in this section sucked. Today I was crawling under trees or straddling them to climb over. And the bushes and trees along the trail were so overgrown in places that I was literally whacking branches the entire way through. It was not fun. I appreciate how much work the AT Club members put in and I’ve met a fair amount of them, but this part of the trail could use some work. 
I found two guys moving quickly behind me, McQueen and Justin. They had both done super long mileage today and were pretty wiped, saying they were headed for that campsite too. We all got to the campsite and I saw Two Fingers and Buck the doggie, which was nice! They had a fire and it was a great vibe, but I was still game to press on. At this point I had eaten nothing but a Clif bar and I was dehydrated and tired, but whatever mileage I could take off of tomorrow would help. The boys I met decided to press on, so I joined them. McQueen said he had never “stealth-camped” or camped alone at a site that isn’t an official AT site, and I said I had never done that either and we shared our fears of it. We all pressed on, but they were much faster than I was. They stopped at one ridge and were planning on camping when I found them, but they decided to press on, so I did too. This time they separated. McQueen went further to find a spot at Stecoah Gap, but Justin stayed behind on top of a ridge just a little ways before it. I debated, but ended up staying with Justin. I said earlier how I wanted to camp on top of a ridge like that. Well here was my chance. I set up camp and made Mountain House lasagna. I even hung my bear bag without issue! Omg! It’s way too low though, but whatever haha. It’s up! Justin sleeps with his food and I don’t blame him! As dangerous as it might be, it’s so tempting.
I sat with Justin and watched the sunset. It was actually really nice. He’s been going solo the whole time and didn’t seem to have any trail family or connections yet. I didn’t want to infringe on his space up here, but it was such a great spot to camp and I was so tired. He’s from Wisconsin. We chatted for a while and then headed to bed. My feet are killing me. This is the worst pain I’ve had the entire trip in my feet. It’s really awful. I took some Advil, so hopefully that helps. I know I pushed myself today with all of that climbing in the beginning and rushing toward the end and not eating enough. My poor feet are not happy about it. I keep wiggling them around to make it less painful, but they feel horrible. Ugh. I hope they can take the mileage tomorrow. It’s about 14 from Stecoah Gap, so since we’re near that, it’s a little over 14 miles tomorrow to my pickup spot for my Inn. 
Wow what a day. I am completely drained haha. And I may have to amputate my feet lol. But it was a nice day and didn’t end up raining! I actually didn’t mention that; there were storm clouds circling me all day and occasionally thunder in the distance, and at one of the lookout points I could see rain pouring down. The forecast originally did call for rain today, so I’m so glad it held off. It was actually part of the rushed/panic mode I was in because I kept staring at these dark clouds as I walked and feeling like there was a storm coming, but it didn’t rain at all. I can actually hear the cars down at Stecoah Gap from up here and it’s loud haha. 
Song of the day: “Smile” by Mikky Ekko. I actually didn’t listen to music for the whole second part of the day, but for the first, this was great!

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610123,"What a long day! I got up earlier than I have been, despite being wiped. I woke up at 7am and got my stuff together. Justin was up too and we chatted a bit while packing up. I headed out around 8:30. The downhill to Stecoah Gap was a little longer than I expected. I was happy I had stayed on the ridge, but pretty anxious about the day. After Stecoah Gap, there was a long uphill, Jacob’s Ladder. What a beast. It was quite steep. 
I haven’t actually mentioned the weather. It’s been really hot! I complained about the cold before and now I’m complaining about the heat haha. I expected that would happen. I actually prefer the cold normally, but when I have the right layers. Now that it’s been hot, it’s been uncomfortable to hike in. I’ve been sweating quite a bit and have been pretty dehydrated. 
Climbing that first climb in the heat was tough. After that, it leveled out a bit, but there was still a fair amount of uphill today. I ran into a couple I had seen briefly at the campsite yesterday before I pressed on, and I met a lady as well. Her trail name was something with “squirrel” in it. She was headed toward Fontana today too. We were joking about how you can’t trust people on the trail because people will say things like “tomorrow is all downhill” and then you get your hopes up and it turns out to be some downhill with a bunch of up. I do have my AWOL guide to confirm the elevation, but I also trust people easily, so if someone says, “the next part is all downhill”, I’m ready for the downhill. People do that a lot on the trail. They say that about weather too. Yesterday someone at Sassafras Gap Shelter told me I would get rained on and that “it was coming for me” and with those rain clouds circling, I believed it. I was never touched with a drop of rain yesterday. I’ve learned to trust my personal info. and apparently this woman feels the same way. I had stopped for water when I saw her, and I was about 3 miles from Cable Gap Shelter at this point and about 8 from Fontana. 
I had not eaten a lot, again. It’s weird, I totally got the trail hunger the other day and was going crazy over my food, but now I’ve lost it again. Maybe I just have too much on my mind with the stress of timing and whatnot. We often feel things in our gut, so if I had anxiety or stress in my gut about what I was doing, I might not have had hunger. It sucks though. I want to eat! Today I had a ProBar for breakfast. It was good, but I wasn’t even hungry enough to finish it. I put it in my pocket for later. Even though I was having food issues, I knew I needed water desperately in this heat, so I made it a priority to stop where I did. It was a bit of a walk off trail and “Squirrel” joked with me, saying, anything that’s “off trail” is still “on trail” if you decide to go there. 
I must admit, I was not in a good mood today. It was a combination of exhaustion and stress I guess, but I was in that “easily irritated” mood. I was irritated by the lack of trail maintenance and the amount of branches I whacked myself with and trees I had to climb over. There was one tree that was honestly comical to me. It was more than half my height, so I would’ve had to lie down on top of it to get myself over. Thankfully, a path led around it, but it was a muddy path that looked like it had been made by someone passing through. There were also a ton of webs! You know when you’re walking outside and suddenly you hit a web without seeing it and have that gross feeling? I hit about 50 webs today. They’d be in between the bushes and branches that were blocking the trail and I’d keep having to wipe them off. 
I do want to take a moment to appreciate nature, as I know that is why I’m here haha. The AT right now is a bit bare. There isn’t much vegetation, which makes going to the bathroom behind a tree a real blast. You can see everything haha. Both Georgia and North Carolina have been this way. North Carolina is a bit more spread out with uphills and downhills. Sometimes it’s all at once, or a steady incline or decline. But it isn’t the same as Georgia’s constant up and down. I still pass through Gaps all the time, but they aren’t as brutal here. Every time you get to a Gap, you know there’s an uphill coming out of it! Squirrel said Gap stands for grueling agonizing pass. Haha. Overall, the views have been spectacular, but the hiking itself has gotten a bit boring. There’s plenty of variety in terrain, but it’s still pretty dead and bare throughout, and the lack of trail maintenance doesn’t help. I’ve seen some pretty little flowers coming up alongside the path and I’ve seen lots of butterflies. One even flew ahead of me for a while the other day, hiking the trail with me! And of course, the ridges are awesome, especially sleeping on one last night! 
I reached Cable Gap Shelter and headed for the privy. I really don’t want to give TMI, but I’ve been having trouble with the whole “cathole” concept out of exhaustion when I have to go, but there have also been privies the whole way so far. A past AT thru-hiker told me they don’t continue, so mentally I’m prepared for no privies, but for now I’m taking advantage. Unfortunately, Sunday night, the privy was so full the pile was a foot or less from the top. Trail maintenance!!!! But it’s been rough this week, being that time of the month and having a tight, heavy pack on my hips. Women, y’all can hear me out there. 
I saw the boys from Kentucky again. I’ve run into them several times today. They’re always smoking something haha. I also ran into Buck the doggie and his owner. I keep forgetting his owner’s name haha I’m not ashamed that I’m too attached to the dog. Buck knows me now and came over for a petting. He’s such a good boy. I love that dog. May or may not steal him. 10/10 would pet him all day. Squirrel was smart. She took her shoes off and soaked her feet in the stream at the shelter. I should’ve. My feet were starting to ache. It was 2pm and I had 5.5 miles left to go. Sounds okay timing-wise, but as with every Gap, you have to climb out of it! Haha. It was a good 3 miles uphill. It was rough. Physically my body was done. I was so wiped I was practically bent over trying to hike up those climbs. 
Finally I made it to Walker Gap, and it was about 2/2.5 miles from there to my destination. It was 3:50. The Inn said they could pick me up before 5, so I was really against the clock at this point. It was a really rough downhill, with all sorts of rocks and roots and steep steps. My feet were killing me. I was actually wincing while stepping and sometimes whimpering in pain. I know I did this to myself, but I eventually planned 15-20 mile days and I’m trying to get my body ready and test out what I’m capable of, while being safe too. I took that Nero at the NOC for my body’s sake as well as the rain. Today, my body was not happy at all. 
I finally reached the road crossing and followed the instructions from the Inn owner, using a phone box thing (parents yes I know what that is) to call because there is no service down at the Dam. There was a vending machine there and all I wanted in that moment was a soda, but I didn’t have exact change and didn’t want to risk putting a big bill in there and not getting it back. The Inn owner picked me up and took me back. It’s a nice little Inn and she runs it since her husband passed away a few years back. I was limping out of the car because my feet were in that much pain, and I limped all around my room. I got into the shower and that felt good. I put all my laundry in a pile and gave that to her. I actually still have clean clothes from Franklin because I’ve been wearing the same sweaty T-shirt and leggings every day. Yes I reeked. I apologized to her, but I’m sure she’s used to it. 
She then took me into Robinsville for dinner. There is nothing in Robinsville. Even on the way, there were several dilapidated houses. There was Wendy’s, McDonalds, and Subway, or this Mexican restaurant. I went for the Mexican restaurant rather than fast food. I downed a whole bowl of chips so fast I was wondering where it went. Chips, hello? Are you out there? Haha. I ordered a yummy pork quesadilla that was grilled in pineapple. Yummy!! I couldn’t finish it though. Blame the chips. I brought the rest back here, but probably won’t get to eat it. I was intrigued because I wanted a margarita, but it’s a dry town here. The guy at the restaurant was joking about how sad it is to have a Mexican restaurant without margaritas. Yeah too true man! 
I came back and put on the TV, something I haven’t done in weeks! And Harry Potter was on, my fave! I stretched out my feet and watched it. I’m relaxed, but sore now. I took Advil for my feet and elevated them for a bit, so hopefully they’re better tomorrow, when I enter the Smokies! Woot woot!
I saw an interesting quote on one of the churches in the town today: “you are never too lost to be saved”. Pondering that for a bit. 
Song of the day: Lord of the Rings soundtrack! There was a cool-looking fog this morning in between the mountains and as I climbed that beast of a mountain, I listened to one of my fave soundtracks. Don’t worry, the Harry Potter soundtrack was next.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610219,"Today was a beautiful day. The sun was out and there was a nice breeze. I originally planned on going into the Smokey’s today, but didn’t follow the plan. I’ve been frustrated when plans change, but I had to listen to my body today. I got a shuttle from my Inn back to the same place and sat there having my breakfast. Some people came down from the trail and were pumped about the vending machine, only to find out there was nothing left in it but Diet Coke, no calories there! Guess I’m glad I didn’t try wasting my money on it yesterday. I met a man who is headed back to Boston today to run in the marathon. He spent 12 days on the trail and told me it was “the best training” and that after the trail, I could run a marathon. Maybe! Lol running with no weight on my back does sound rather amazing right now. He told me he ran the Chicago Marathon 4 times and Boston 10. What a champ! I’m sad I won’t be in the scream tunnel this year at Wellesley; that was always such a blast. 
I saw Two Fingers and an older man, who had absolutely no weight in that pack. He said it weighed 15 pounds, no food or water. Yeesh. He already hiked the AT last year and didn’t know what to do with himself after so he’s hiking it again. I have heard the adjustment back is hard. But he also had some hard stories of people quitting, even after they made it to CT! This trail is such a challenge and sometimes I don’t give myself enough credit for being out here and doing this. Even just waking up, taking down my tent, and stepping foot onto the trail is an accomplishment. It is really hard work and I just did two 14-mile days. I get why people quit and obviously I don’t want to ever do that, but it is a tough journey I’ve set out on. I’m not sitting here with rose-colored glasses and honestly I don’t think I ever did. I got slammed with the difficulty of the trail on day one and have experienced many challenges since. So when experienced hikers tell me the rose-color will fade, I don’t think I ever felt it. I’ve felt the hard reality of the trail every day, while having a blast too.
Anyway, I was chatting with everyone and decided to push on. My pack was heavy and my body just felt wiped. I started hiking and the view was gorgeous. I was walking right by the lake and it was lovely. I arrived at the “Fontana Hilton” or basically a shelter with a bathroom and solar-charging station. Everyone had been talking about it for days because it had a shower. Since I stayed at my Inn, I didn’t need a shower, but it was a really beautiful spot. It had a view of the lake and was spacious and clean. I sat there, feeling mentally like I just didn’t want to hike today and physically beat. 
And then my friends showed up! Red Wiggler, Green Slouch, Hermione, Ringer, Honey Buns, and Lexi. And I finally found out the name of Buck’s owner haha. It’s “Tits on the Ritz”. Hmm. Unfortunately, he had to send Buck away for the week because you can’t bring dogs into the Smokey’s unless they’re service dogs. I miss that pup! The best doggo. 
Most of the people from my two trail families were here and I just didn’t want to leave. I really sat and debated for so long. I always feel bad when people help me think out my decisions, but everyone was helping me process what I should do. I even flipped a coin haha. I did this with the NOC cabin situation too and it just kills me to have to sit there debating. I’ve gotten better at decision making, but it’s hard with the trail because if I dump more mileage onto tomorrow, I don’t know how I’ll feel, and if I push on today, I don’t know how I’ll feel after. 
I decided to stay. It was getting late by that point anyway to push on. I decided to take a zero and just rest my body and mind. I haven’t actually taken a zero yet and I’ve been out here almost three weeks. I’ve done some low mileage days, but nothing where I can just sit and relax. I was really against zeros for a while because I thought they’d take me too much off trail mentally, but as the terrain gets tougher, I realize that they may be necessary.
Unfortunately, my ankle is really in pain and so are my feet. A lot of hikers have this thing called K-tape or something, but I don’t have that. I don’t know what to do, but I need to press on. It’s not debilitating and I don’t find it hard to walk on, just sore. I really pushed on that downhill yesterday. Luckily, a wonderful act of trail magic today left me with a bucket of ice at the shelter! I put some into a plastic bag and iced my ankle. I put sunscreen on and brought my sleeping pad out and just relaxed by the lake view, icing my feet. It was wonderful. I did get a bit burned, but I put sunscreen on so ugh! 
I tried to eat through some of my food because my bag is heavy. It’s not too bad, but I had leftover food from last time, mainly peanut butter! This morning another hiker at the Inn and I were discussing food and he was telling me I didn’t need any of the food I had and that I had too much water. I really disagree. Hike your own hike! But seriously, we’re all burning so many calories per day out here and we should be having at least 4 liters of water a day. He said he got by on 1 and a half. Yeah you save water weight, but that’s not enough water at all! And the thing is, I do need all the food I have. My body needs those calories and protein and the fact that I haven’t been eating it has put my body in a worse position. It needs those nutrients and nourishment. Honestly hike your own hike. I am fine carrying extra weight if it means I’m being healthy and smart with what I’m feeding my body. I need to give it the power to do this trail. 
Anyway, I ate and iced and chatted and it was nice! I had a great zero day. Everyone went into town to resupply and I was just relaxing. I needed that so badly. They all came back with a ton of food and the resupply had been quite pricey. That’s the kind of effort I don’t want to put in sometimes, which is why mail drops are my way of doing food. I love grocery shopping at home, but here it feels like a chore. Sitting by the lake made me realize how much I miss that. It’s another dream of mine to have a house on a lake someday. I know I’m super frugal, but maybe it will help me make that dream come true too! Someday! 
One guy made a fire and we all sat around and chatted. Ringer helped me bear bag. He offered, so I took him up on it. We got my rope up on a good branch and I waited to hang my bag since I still had food I wanted to eat. I hung out around the fire with Red Wiggler and Hermione and Slouch. We again had some deep convos. I enjoy these peeps! 
I went to put my bear bag up and got to that last part with the stick and managed to get my finger stuck in the knot I was trying to make. Lol that was some serious pain. I let the whole bag fall because I couldn’t get my finger out. Red Wiggler said I need to be named “Bear Bag”. Never! Haha. I will conquer it eventually. Maybe I’ll have a few fingers left and five feet of rope, but I will do it! Man. 
There was a snake in the bathroom and everyone named it the Chamber of Secrets and I really enjoyed that reference. The snake, not so much. Also the only place to charge phones was a power strip in the men’s room because the solar charger didn’t work! Not fair lol. I walked in there to plug my phone in. No shame. I went to Wellesley, where the men’s rooms were the cleanest and least used, so we used them. No fear! Haha. I did warn said men, but they can deal unless they want to give us girls the power strip! 
I am sleeping in the shelter tonight. It isn’t always my first choice because there are mice and snorers. I really can’t sleep when someone is snoring and I am not a fan of hearing mice. But it is dry and it’s supposed to rain tonight, so it’s the best option! 
Update: slept through the snoring, but Honey Buns had a bad dream and woke up screaming “hello, hello!”, so that was interesting! I totally thought there was a bear. Thank goodness there wasn’t. He said he was dreaming about a tree falling on the shelter. Yikes!

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610326,"Today made me question a lot of things. I don’t want to have so much negativity about this trip, because I’m out here to enjoy myself and this journey, but I have to acknowledge that the adjustments and the past pain I’m working through is going to make it tough. Today was just so tough. And today I actually wanted to quit the trail and it’s making me miserable to even think that because it’s been my dream for so long and it’s so early on. 
It started this morning with the rain. My entire trail family clan decided to stay back because Ringer had a horrible night’s sleep and his knee is bothering him. I feel really bad for him because he snores and someone was poking and cursing at him all night. I definitely find the snoring really annoying, but I was tired enough to sleep through it last night, and Ringer is the sweetest man; I know he can’t help it. He left the shelter because he didn’t want to be poked and he tried to sleep outside, and his knee was bothering him too. Poor Ringer. Everyone stayed behind for him and Lexi even said it’s because we’re “family”. I felt horrible for pushing on instead of staying with them. I know, hike your own hike, but it made me really think about what I want out of this friendship-wise and what’s important to me. 
I continued on in the rain, alone, and reached Fontana Dam and the Visitor Center. Inside, there was a lady with candy and a stamp for my AT Passport. It was a cool place and it was nice to stop for a minute. Another couple hiking the AT together was there as well. I headed out and walked across the Dam. Honestly that was the best part of today. It’s literally part of the trail to walk over the Dam and for some reason I loved that. It was nerve-wracking looking down. And there was fog in the mountains. On the other side was the lake from last night, which still looked beautiful in the fog and rain. 
After the Dam, I turned right and headed down a road for a bit to head to the trailhead of the entrance to the Smokey’s. I was feeling pain in my ankle at this point, which was annoying. I finally reached the trailhead and by this point, it wasn’t raining anymore, which was nice. I dropped off my permit in the box, took off all of my rain layers, and headed off. It was uphill all morning, as I expected. I finally reached a peak with a firetower and Mountain Laurel and Chad were there having lunch. The firetower was off-trail a bit, but I wanted to see it because I love views. I walked up to it and it was a bit eerie. It was rusty and old and the top floor was rotting. It was very windy too. But the views were fantastic, so I’m glad I climbed it. 
I went back down and had lunch. Unfortunately, TMI, I really had to go to the bathroom, and with little greenery was having trouble. But I found a place. It’s just a struggle sitting in the dirt every time because you get covered in dirt, even though I’m very clean about the whole process. It just added to my bad mood to be covered in dirt and leaves. I went back and finished lunch, but was forcing down my tortilla. 
After lunch, I was feeling better physically, but not mentally. I was pushing through the hills and not having too much pain, other than a little in my ankle. My decision to put that food in my body was turning out to be worth it. Things went downhill again when there was a part of the trail not well maintained. There was a massive tree across it and someone had again just dug a small path around it, but it was all mud and slippery. I couldn’t get down the hill side and was afraid of slipping so I sat down to ease my way down, but that was worse and I got covered in mud. I was pretty miserable at this point and all I could think was “I hate this”. Which is really so sad to me because I don’t want to hate it. I was crying again (I know I know I cry a lot I have a lot of feelings) but this time I was crying because I hated the trail and I didn’t want to hate it. I hated myself for feeling that way. I hated that I was covered in mud and leaves and I hated that I still had so much more mileage to go. 
I reached a crossing with a sign and it said 3 miles to the first shelter, and I was headed to the second, which meant I had 5 miles left to go. It was 5pm. It was really too bad that I was feeling the way I was because right in this spot was a beautiful field of white flowers. The whole ground as far as I could see was covered in them. It was like a blanket of snow, but flowers. The trail was very muddy at this point so I was going very slowly to avoid more messes with mud. 
I reached a water trail and I decided to get water because the AWOL guide said the water sources were unreliable at the next two shelters. I also thought maybe I could wash off some of the mud. It worked somewhat and made me feel better, but then I met up with people at the trailhead and they said it was still another 1.7 miles to the first shelter. It was just taking forever to get there. I felt like I had gone so far, but I hadn’t. It was starting to thunder and I was losing daylight. I was truly miserable. 
I followed the two men to the shelter, which was all uphill for 1.7 miles and I was losing it. I didn’t even want to be here and I was just pushing my body forward. It was such a low. I finally got to the shelter and I set up my tent. It wasn’t where I wanted to go today, but I couldn’t keep going. I made my dinner from the vestibule in my tent and just ate and tried to relax. There were bear cables so thankfully I didn’t have to deal with hanging my bag. I got in my tent and in my dry clothes. It’s chilly here, but I slept well. I fell asleep instead of writing this because I just needed to process. I am writing this the next morning because I need to get it out and hopefully I will have a better day today. I’m lonely and muddy and sad, and I really wish I could say it was different. I am still really proud of myself for making these decisions and judgement calls and trying to listen to myself, but I am upset that I can’t make this trip what I wanted it to be right now. I’m upset that I even thought the word “hate” today. 
I’m going to have a late start today and a late end today because I still have mileage to make up, but I’m going to take it one step at a time and try my best. I will head for whatever shelter I can handle today. I’m sorry again for the negativity. I want to be able to see the positives of this journey right now, and I really did see them during my zero day, but I am just not seeing them today.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610579,"Today was a better day, but again I didn’t make the mileage I wanted to. I woke up feeling pretty horrible given my day yesterday, but writing my journal helped me process through it and get ready for the day. I woke up at 7 and didn’t really want to move. Unfortunately, had I moved, I would’ve missed the rain. But since I didn’t, it started raining and I was still in my tent. I used that time to write my journal. I left at 11.
Today was my latest start of the trail, but I really needed that time to get my head in the right place. I actually chatted with a man named Richard while I made my oatmeal. He was a bit older, but had a young face. He said he moves very slowly, about a mile an hour. I finally got my stuff packed up and headed out. It wasn’t raining anymore for the most part; it sprinkled throughout the day. I stayed in my rain clothes just in case. I had taken my pack cover off, but I decided to stop and put it back on. Unfortunately, 5 minutes after I stopped, I ran into a ridge runner and he asked to see my permit, which was in my bag. Luckily he was nice and took it out for me so I didn’t have to take my pack off again. He was friendly and said someone ahead had mentioned me! 
I passed two shelters this morning. Both were within a couple of miles from each other. At the first, I ran into Nate! I haven’t seen him in a while. He was planning the same mileage as me, but we both got a late start. I needed water so I filled up there and Nate headed on. He’s really a nice guy. Apparently his girlfriend broke up with him on the trail and he’s been dealing with that all alone. Poor guy. His name is now “Lone Wolf”. I’m glad we know each other and ran into each other. 
I reached a mountain, “Rocky Top”, around 3:30. I was making good time, but my late start had still pushed me back. I met a past thru-hiker, Wrong Foot, and his daughter on the summit, as well as a couple, Robinhood and Melissa. Wrong Foot hiked it in 1998 and has written a book and given talks on the trail ever since. It really does stay with you for life and I like that. He was super friendly and we chatted for a while as I had lunch. He said he was the 8th person to hike it the year he did it, and I told him I was 1400 after that this year! Crazy how times have changed and how many people do it now. Robinhood and Melissa headed on and I followed a few minutes later. There was a fair amount of climbing and steep downhills for the rest of the day. I saw Robinhood and Melissa again and walked with them for a bit. Robinhood was very into the wildlife and kept stopping to look at field mice or interesting flowers. I was third-wheeling again; I find myself attaching to couples sometimes haha. Take me in and give me love too! Haha I’m totally jealous of their companionship and I wish I had it on the trail. It really is hard to keep going sometimes and I really do feel so alone, no matter how many friends I make. 
The couple stopped for a break and I kept going. It was 2 miles to the nearest shelter by this point and it was late. I was thinking I’d have to stop there or else I’d have to night-hike, and I didn’t really want to do that. I kept going, but that last 2 miles felt like forever. It really does amaze me how the trail works that way. The morning 2 miles felt like nothing and this felt like forever. But on some days, the entire day drags on. It is hard to recognize the accomplishments sometimes when I hike 7 miles and it takes me four hours. It’s a long four hours. I can usually make a pace of 2 miles an hour, but even that feels so slow to me. 
I actually stopped .3 miles before the shelter, feeling like I’d never get there. I checked my phone and had service, and it said I was .3 from the shelter. I pushed on and arrived around 7pm. Hermione and Green Slouch were there, which was awesome! And some of the other folks I met at Fontana were also there. I could not push on the 5.7 miles to the shelter I wanted to in daylight. I was too afraid to hike in the dark alone and Nate was already gone, so I stopped. The shelter was full, but I expected it to be. Anytime I arrive late to a shelter, I expect it to be full. I was okay with that because it was dry. There was a storm coming, but at the moment it was dry. I actually found a genius spot right to the side of the shelter. The wind would completely miss my tent and blow past, and it was flat.
Because I got there late, I was having dinner late, but I cooked my meal and sat in the dark with my headlamp. My meal was not cooked well because I didn’t wait long enough, and the wind was really picking up. This was some of the worst wind I saw on the trail and it was howling. Someone said, according to the weather, it was 60 mph. I believe it. The bear cables were flying all over the place and it was loud as they squeaked. The tarp on the shelter was flapping around and it was hard for me to keep my food and supplies still as I cooked. 
I ended up not finishing my meal, but just heading to bed. Today was long and had some rough terrain, but I was in a better place than yesterday and was happy to see friends.

",Derrick Knob Shelter,"Apr 13, Sat",12.10
Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610580,"Ugh. Another rough day today. The wind from last night was howling this morning too. I woke up at 6:30, yay Diana! My goal for today was to make it to the parking lot of Clingman’s Dome and hitch a ride to Gatlinburg. I wasn’t going to summit it because the weather was supposed to be insane and it’s the highest point in the Smokey’s. The weather lived up to the insanity. There were tornado warnings and thunderstorm warnings and winds of 40 mph. I really am not kidding. It was nuts.
I headed out in those winds and it was like walking through a hurricane. I was constantly being pushed to the side and it was taking forever to push forward on the uphills. I had all my Goretex wind gear on, but it was still rough. And then the rain started. It was pretty much just a goal to make it to the nearest shelter at this point. I didn’t feel safe out in this weather and I felt scared and was soaking. There’s only so much rain gear can do in pouring rain and howling wind. I had a brief Forrest Gump moment because the rain really did seem to blow in sideways. Haha. Lieutenant Dan was mad on their shrimp boat in the storm and I was mad today too. I was pretty upset. It’s just miserable trying to walk through that. Even when you know it’s coming. I’ve been told so many times “you signed up for this”, “what’d you expect? It’s the trail”, “there will be more and more days like this where you’ll never be dry”. Trust me, I hear you all. I did choose to do this. I knew what I was signing up for. But going it alone is really rough. Pushing through such a severe storm and feeling completely alone and helpless was horrible. 
I ran into four section hikers and they told me the nearest shelter was 1.5 miles away and that it was “mostly flat”. I need to stop believing people lol it was not flat at all. It was mostly uphill with “some flat”! I was losing my mind and seriously considering bailing. I pushed on and finally made it to the shelter. I walked in like a zombie and the group of people from Fontana were there. They have their own tramily, but they’ve all been friendly. I was soaked to the bone and considering pushing on to Clingman’s Dome, but I needed to get warm first. They had all stopped sooner than they had planned to too because the storm was so insane.
They didn’t want me going back out alone and convinced me to stay. It only took about 20 minutes in my soaking clothes to decide I needed to stay. I had pretty bad service, but texted my mom to try to move the reservation at my hotel in Gatlinburg. I got into my dry clothes, literally changing in the open in the shelter. I set up my sleep stuff and got into my sleeping bag to warm up. It worked well and I napped for a bit. 
The trail family here is Hot Sauce, Prometheus, Naners, and Joe aka “Piss Pack” (he tried to pee outside his tent in the middle of the night and forgot his pack was there. Ahh the luxury of being able to even pee outside your tent like that. Men.) I don’t think he’s keeping that name haha. Hot Sauce hiked 700 miles last year and stopped, so she’s here again to try and finish it. Prometheus is funny and sassy. We give each other a lot of sass and I enjoy it haha. He started to call me Deborah because of Debbie and when he found out I was as tall as him, he started to call me Big Deborah. Lol I don’t like the name too much, but it’s funny. He’s into horoscopes and I definitely had a phase of being into them too. I don’t really follow it all anymore, but I joke sometimes that I’m a Leo and that’s why I do this or that. I know it’s all hogwash. He’s a Pisces. All the Pisces I’ve met have that sass and we go back and forth like that. Pretty interesting. He looked up his horoscope and then looked at mine. It said I’ve been struggling lately and losing faith in myself, but will get stronger every day. Amazingly enough, that seemed fitting. 
We played crosswords on Naner’s phone and hung out. It was really nice, and the storm was not letting up outside. Prometheus has the best sleep pad. He let me share it with him so I could see. It’s making me rethink the one I bought because mine is very thin. It isn’t as easy to pop, but it’s thin. I have a very comfy bed at home, so it’s a hard adjustment to the thin pad, but I’ve been glad it’s durable. 
A woman and her friend walked in during the storm. She was a thru-hiker from last year who had to stop due to heath concerns and is finishing it now. She was not in the best mood. The shelter had gotten full throughout the day and she walked in and said “you’re going to have to make room for two more”. Usually when the shelter is full, you just have to tent. That happened to me last night. Unfortunately, in the Smokey’s, day hikers and section hikers can reserve the shelter for 4 dollars and kick you out if you’re a thru-hiker. I think it’s really dumb because honestly thru-hikers have to endure so much more. Section hikers will be done in a week and back in a car going home. It doesn’t feel fair to me. And I did have to pay as well for a permit; 20 dollars. This woman did not have reservations, but her friend did. He was able to find a spot, but there was a leak in the corner, so it wasn’t great. He and a few other guys tried to MacGyver their way around the leak. They put up a tarp and it seemed to help. She set up her stuff on the floor, but was complaining a lot. The Kentucky boys came in pretty late and their dog walked right in and shook off her dirty wet fur all over the woman on the floor’s sleeping bag. She was pretty pissed and made that clear. Dogs aren’t allowed in the Smokey’s unless they’re service dogs, which I guess this one is. Dogs and bears don’t like each other so I guess I’m happy the dog is here. Another man came in from his hammock because he was afraid of getting hypothermia. It is supposed to be cold and snowy tonight actually. What a disgusting day of weather. 
I went out during a break in the rain and got water and went to the bathroom. A lot of fun on a muddy slope... muddy bum again! I can’t wait to shower agh. I made my Mountain House meal and ate the whole thing. I had cheese and nuts and alcohol, my own little cocktail time! I played cards with Prometheus and Naners. I’m getting ready for bed, but the guy next to me snores. Great. Of all the people in the shelter, I’m sleeping next to the snorer. This will be a real struggle for me some day in a marriage lol. It is so annoying. As much sympathy as I have for them, I need my sleep too and it’s like sleeping next to a bear! Ugh. 
Here’s hoping tomorrow is dry and I get some good sleep tonight. 
Little Debbie/Deborah? Haha","Derrick Knob Shelter

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611092,"This morning was cold! We woke up and the trees were covered in ice and snow. Our bear bags were frozen and my carabiner was totally locked. Prometheus was a champ and used a lighter to loosen it and get my bag off. My sleeping pad had slid under his last night and I was moving around a ton trying to get it back, but ended up half on his. He was really sweet this morning and put his sleeping bag on top of mine to keep me warm. I was pretty cold, but the body heat of the shelter and my SmartWool did a good job all night. I had put my wet clothes in the foot of my sleeping bag to dry them out, but it never quite works. They were still damp. 
Prometheus was boiling water and gave me some hot water to use for my hot cocoa packets. He was a trooper and kept everybody’s spirits up even though it was freezing out and everything was still wet from yesterday. Imagine putting on frozen, soaking hiking boots. It was a morning. There was a serious concern of hypothermia with all the wet gear and freezing temperatures, so I actually hiked in my sleep clothes today. I took a while to get going out of my sleeping bag, but I got going as Naners and Prometheus did, and we headed out into the cold!
Today was the first time I saw nature I was in love with. All of Georgia and some of North Carolina was bare and monotonous, but today I saw pine trees and snow and it was gorgeous! We got to the first shelter and I used the privy. My muddy bum was thankful because not every shelter here has a privy. TMI, but I also want to mention that my bum gets muddy because I have trouble squatting to go to the bathroom because my legs are sore and I end up sitting. I promise I’m clean about it, I just sit in the dirt. Prometheus and I are going to make an inflatable toilet seat someday haha. But to all you folks back home, I want you to know I’m clean, just can’t squat well these days because it hurts! I do have a pstyle, which is essentially a female penis, but it is amazing because you can stand and go. 
I was sweating a lot and my legs were freezing. I had actually slipped and fallen earlier today, first fall of the trail! But it was really funny because I slipped on the mud and kind of slowly fell to the side. It didn’t hurt and I didn’t actually get any mud on me. Prometheus took a pretty great picture of me. I had been leading so far that morning and I was nervous because I’m not that fast, so I wanted Prometheus and Naners to lead from here on. I lagged behind a bit, but they stopped and waited for me and were truly wonderful. 
I stopped to take pictures too because it was really so beautiful. We climbed for a while and finally reached Clingman’s Dome, the highest point of the AT and the 200-mile marker! It was so exciting! There’s a tower at the top and I walked up and met Prometheus and Naners, but it was so cold. The walkway was slippery and there was ice crusted onto the railings. I made it up and there was no view, but sometimes the snow and fog cleared with the wind and there was a view. It was too cold to stay up there longer. We headed down the road to the parking lot. There were a lot of people walking up, despite the weather. We saw Joe and he said the shuttles were stuck because a tree and boulder had fallen across the road. We saw it later when it had been cleared. The wind was definitely strong enough the past few days to have knocked over trees. I saw one post in the Facebook groups I’m in that showed a tree right across the AT. I remember hearing the cracking sound of trees on that super stormy day. Crazy stuff! 
We took pictures and tried to figure out a hitch/ride situation, but then a shuttle showed up! We were up on top of some rocks getting cool views so we had to scramble down. We hopped in the shuttle and it was so warm! We picked up the Kentucky boys and their pup and continued on. It was a long ride down, but it was beautiful. There were a ton of scenic overlooks and I wished I could’ve stopped at all of them. We arrived in Gatlinburg around 3pm and went straight for Cici’s pizza. I’ve never been there, but was pumped for food. I had two full large cokes and pizza and it was delicious. 
I plugged in the Hampton Inn to my phone because that’s where I was staying, but a 20-minute walk later I found out there were two Hampton Inns in Gatlinburg and I had walked to the wrong one. Oh well! I got to see the whole town so it was fine. I walked back to the other one and checked in. I went up to my room and charged my phone and laid out all my cold, damp clothes. I took a long shower and it felt so good. After, I went for a walk with Prometheus. We were going to go on the Gondola, but everything at the top was closed so we decided not to. He went to do laundry and shop and I walked around. I didn’t need to do laundry since I’ll be in Hot Springs with my parents soon. 
Someone was asking in the comments about why I plan my hike like that and I just wanted to answer and say that my parents are meeting me in Hot Springs and they needed a rough schedule so they could purchase flights and hotels. I also want to have some outline of when I’m going to be places for people I may see later and for my job when I return. I don’t need to plan my whole trip, but I need to have a sense of when I’ll be places. I personally like having a plan. And I don’t really want to hike this forever. I’m already having stresses and struggles a few weeks in. It’s a long journey and I don’t want it to take much longer than needed. I am still enjoying the little things and learning and growing from this every day, even if I don’t enjoy everything about it. Hike your own hike! 
Gatlinburg is cool. I know there are people that don’t enjoy those tourist towns, but I really love exploring and experiencing everything. I was definitely in a different world than CT, as there were people wearing confederate flags as t-shirts, but it was still cool. The town had so much to do. It would be easy to spend multiple days there. I was so tempted by mini golf and laser tag and the ski lifts. I know you can do all of that at home, but it still looked fun to do with my new friends. I didn’t end up riding the chairlift, but I wanted to. Chairlifts scare me a bit because I haven’t been skiing much in my life and I fall off every time I get to the top. I definitely want to learn someday when I have the money and time. I mainly didn’t ride this one because of time. It was almost 7 and I was hungry. 
I spoiled my dinner a bit because there was a Ben and Jerry’s and it was only open until 9, so I had it first. It was delicious! I love me some chocolate ice cream and chocolate waffle cones. As I was eating it on a bench, Nate walked up! It was so good to see him! He told me he ended up night-walking the other night and I apologized for not meeting him. He asked to get dinner and I said yes. We headed to Smoky Mountain Brewery. I had spotted it earlier and I really wanted to go. There was a 30 minute wait. We checked out some of the other restaurants, but ended up going back. We went to the bar and I sampled some beer. We met another thru-hiker who started March 1st and said he was taking his time. We finally got a table and headed over. 
I ordered hot pretzels and beer-cheese dip and chicken fingers and French Fries. I couldn’t finish it all, but I brought the rest back to my hotel. I had the best dinner with Nate. We really opened up to each other about our situations and breakups and he almost started to cry, which made me tear up too. I love how you can connect with people like that on the trail. I felt like Nate and I had each other’s backs. We had a great time. Mountain Laurel and Chad showed up and we yelled their names, but they didn’t hear, so I went over to say hi. We left and I took my leftovers to my hotel. 
I got back to my room and decided I wanted to get in the hot tub. Why not? It was late, but it was still open and it sounded amazing. I invited Prometheus because I enjoy his company and I had the leftover food to share. He came from his hotel and we hung out in the hot tub for a while. We opened up a lot to each other and it was really nice. He’s been through a lot and we related on so many things. A few kids showed up and jumped in the pool and then the hot tub and they were a little annoying given our conversation, but they left and we stayed for a bit. We went in the pool and back in the hot tub. Prometheus took my leftovers because I knew I wouldn’t eat them. I really don’t enjoy leftovers, especially microwaved. But sometimes they’re good. It depends. I’m a picky eater so I’m picky about that. 
I headed back to my room and dried off. I passed out almost immediately, with a fair amount of planning still to do. I did some of it for my mom and logistics, and then I fell asleep. There is nothing like a hotel bed right now. I laid on probably five pillows and it was amazing. My thin sleeping pad does not compare at all! 
It was a great day with great people and I was so happy to be warm and dry and see a cool town! Back on trail tomorrow!

",Clingman’s Dome/Gatlinburg,"Apr 15, Mon",4.60
Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611093,"Today we left Gatlinburg. We were going to do a long hiking day, but we got a late start. I felt really wiped, as I do every day. There’s always so much to do in addition to hiking, and even walking around town is tiring. I woke up around 8:30/9. I spent some time writing my blog since I was a couple of days behind and I had left off on a bad note. Don’t worry readers, Gatlinburg was a good break and meeting this clan of people helped tremendously. 
I got breakfast at the hotel. Loved the continental breakfast. I made myself waffles with butter, syrup, and Nutella. It was wonderful. Yes I know, not that healthy, but carbs can be good for long days of hiking! I took some cereal boxes to munch on and ate a yogurt and some orange juice. I read the newspaper about the Notre Dame fire. I was upset by it, as it was a tragic disaster and I tend to feel sad when history is destroyed like that. I visited Paris during my junior year of college and I stood outside Notre Dame and took a picture of its iconic towers, but I never got to go inside. I was bummed, but I was following the plans of two other girls I was with. I also wanted to go up in the Eiffel Tower. Two bucket list desires for Paris that I didn’t get to do, and now one of them I’ll never get to see as it originally was. I know, that’s life. I’ll never get to see everything the world has to offer, but it still upsets me. I also love churches and visited too many to count while abroad. St. Peter’s in Vatican City remains my favorite, although going to Evensong in St. Paul’s in London was special too. Church has been a big part of my life since I was young, and even though I’ve had my doubts at times, it remains important to me. Holy Week was always special when I was in the choir. There were so many services it felt like a marathon, but the music and celebration on Easter was worth it. My dad is probably the most religious in the family, as he was raised Irish Catholic and it’s strong in his blood. I am thankful he’s sacrificing church to come see me this Easter. I’m hoping God will be with us as we enjoy time together in Hot Springs. 
I texted Prometheus and he said the shuttle left at 1. I knew that was late, but I was down to do it since the shuttle would be free and convenient. I didn’t feel ready to go. Prometheus and Hot Sauce had been talking about giving me a pack shakedown, or at least a food bag shakedown. I packed everything up because I knew I had to check out at 11 and the cleaning crew was making their rounds already. I planned to finish packing my bag up in the lobby. I headed down with all my stuff and Prometheus and Hot Sauce came to hang. They helped me with my food bag. I ended up having a lot of trash and just way too much trail mix. Before I came out here, I ordered trail mix from this place in California and I ordered four different kinds. I planned on two a resupply, but I haven’t been eating enough of it. I really like all the mixes, but it’s not the first thing I want to snack on and I haven’t been hungry enough. They’re all calorie dense so I should start eating more. Hot Sauce repacked my food bag in an efficient, organized way and I packed it in my bag. Unfortunately, at Amicalola when I got that pack shakedown, they told me to put my tent and food side by side, but Prometheus said that was making my bag tilt and putting too much weight on one side. He told me he would help me fix that later. I was so grateful to both of them for their help. I’m still learning every day how to do this and what changes I can make, so I’m thankful for any advice people have for me. 
We headed out to catch the shuttle, but when we got to the NOC (that store is a chain, which I didn’t realize before), we found out the shuttle wasn’t doing another ride up to Clingman’s Dome. We met the driver, but he was done for the day. He did mention that a whole crew that morning had been talking about me and I realized it was Thunder Buddy, Tinder, and Wobbles! I was sorry I missed them, but excited to know that they were there! We were a bit frustrated not to have the shuttle ride, but decided to call an Uber, because in a populated town like Gatlinburg, that was possible. We used the time to go to the general store across the street. I really wanted some moonshine. I have never had moonshine haha, but I really wanted to try it. I was going to put it in a Gatorade bottle and carry that out, so I bought a Gatorade, and then two little bottles of moonshine. Prometheus stopped me from buying a big bottle. I guess I wasn’t prepared for how moonshine would hit me and when I looked at the percentages on the bottle, I understood. We went back and called the Uber. Prometheus had some ice cream that he got at the general store. 
Our Uber ride was a bit long, but we got back up to Clingman’s Dome. It was totally packed. There were so many people. And no more snow! It was so different from yesterday. It was overwhelming how many people were there. We went up to the visitors center to get postcards/stamps. I needed water and this friendly man gave me his plastic water bottle. There is no water up at the Dome, not even in the little bathrooms they have. They only have bottled water. It was so nice to have someone helping me out, but I would’ve been okay to wait until the next water source had it been necessary. I had had a whole bottle of Gatorade after all! 
We decided it was probably too ambitious to do our long mileage day today given the time, so we headed out for the next shelter, which wasn’t very far. I’ve realized that heading into towns, it’s almost better to plan a Nero both days because of the stress of getting into and out of town. We headed on. We met some nice people on the road up from the parking lot and they asked about our trip. We decided not to go up in the tower to get a view, since it was so crowded. We pretty much missed the view because of all the snow the day before. We connected back with the AT and continued on. It was a nice few miles until the shelter. I really have enjoyed this part of the Smokey’s. It’s been beautiful with the pine trees, fir trees and greenery. There was a cut pine tree at the top of the Dome and that smell was amazing. Just so you all know, pine tree scent is my favorite scent. I always have candles, lotion, and diffusers with that scent. This scenery was what I thought the Smokey’s would look like! It was warmer today, but still chilly. It’s windy and chilly everyday here. I want to get out of the Smokey’s, as much as I love the nature now. 
The shelter was .4 off the trail. I don’t like when the shelter is off the trail like that. Off trail is on trail! It adds mileage and is frustrating. When we arrived, there was room. There was a dad with his two sons and they were section hiking. For some reason, they left the shelter and decided to camp that night. I hope we didn’t scare them off! Thru-hikers tend to be pretty open, as I’ve noticed. We curse, joke, drink, smoke, change in public, etc. I’m civilized I promise, but we definitely have a more open vibe. I think the father just wanted to experience camping for real with his sons. There was at least one other section hiker there and some thru-hikers. And I found Ball’s Out! I had been missing him! He was my day one! Also I really feel open these days so if you’re curious, his name is from wearing a pair of boxers that were a little too roomy and putting his leg up on a log while talking to some hikers. Not too bad honestly. Haha. He seemed a bit different unfortunately and wasn’t as warm, but I still liked seeing him. Prometheus wanted to make a fire and I was so thankful. We went exploring for some dead, dry sticks, as things were still wet from the rain and snow. It was really cool where we went. All the down trees had moss all over them, so it was like climbing in a green jungle gym. I unfortunately stepped on a glass bottle that someone had buried. Luckily I didn’t get cut, but I did break the bottle. That’s pretty disappointing to see though. Is it that hard to carry your trash out? The planet is dying! It was a huge bottle, so there was no way I could carry that out. I covered it up as best as I could, with the top sticking out so people could see. 
Prometheus and Hot Sauce started a fire and then hung out and made dinner. I couldn’t finish my Mountain House noodles, so Hot Sauce finished them for me. I had some candy though because I will always have candy! That sweet tooth! 
I accompanied Ball’s Out, Prometheus, and Hot Sauce to the woods for their smoking activities and we had a nice time chatting. We then went to sleep. It was a very nice day today and I was happy to be hiking with Hot Sauce and Prometheus. Especially after such difficult days of hiking recently, it was so good to have an up. I was against the idea of a trail family because it may slow you down or change your plans, and as you’ve all noticed, I’ve jumped from tramily to tramily because of that, but sometimes it is nice to follow along with others and have that company. 
Little Debbie ","Clingman’s Dome/Gatlinburg
",Mt. Collins Shelter,"Apr 16, Tue",3.20
Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611095,"Long day! Longest day so far actually! Today we planned to do 16 miles. The people in the shelter all left so early. Hot Sauce woke Prometheus and me up and they were all gone. We joked and told her we “didn’t want to go to school” and “what did she pack in our lunches”. Prometheus lay on top of me and it was actually so funny. We were totally like the little kids and Hot Sauce was the mom. We got up and moving eventually and made breakfast. I had oatmeal with dried cherries, which was delicious, but I still wasn’t that hungry. 
We packed up and headed out! The terrain was fine for the morning, with some uphill, but mostly down. We got to a Gap with a parking lot and there were several people there doing trail magic! It was my second experience with an official table and chairs setup. I went right for the Little Debbie treats and they said I really fit into my name. They had so many wonderful treats. I grabbed a Little Debbie chocolate peanut butter thing, a hostess cupcake and roll, a banana, a clementine, fudge stripe cookies, and a coke. Can’t pass up the sweets and soda when it’s there! 
We left and after a little bit, arrived at Newfound Gap. Back in the day, this was where I planned on catching my ride to Gatlinburg. It’s very touristy and has a huge parking lot, so it was packed full of people. And there were bathrooms! But again no water, so no sinks. We saw a sign for the North Carolina/Tennessee border and took a picture with it, but we’ve been following the border for a while, and will for another 200 miles or so. 
There was more trail magic here! Omg! This woman had it setup in her trunk and she had a cooler and Gatorade, as well as chips and cookies. I had two bags of Doritos and Gatorade. I know, healthy again haha. This man came over with a massive cinnamon bun and we munched on that too. He said they were sold in Gatlinburg, but I certainly missed that memo! 
We took pictures next to a monument, I put sunscreen on, and we headed on. Joe had caught up to us even though he had done a zero in Gatlinburg. He was headed for an 18-mile day! It was pretty rough terrain at times, with a fair amount of climbing and descent, but it was gradual. We passed some people and this little girl said to her parents “I can smell em”. A great boost of confidence haha it was pretty funny. I know I smell! I know because most normal humans I pass smell really good, and I know they all didn’t put perfume on today. They just smell so much better than I do.
Hot Sauce takes these things she calls “tree breaks” and I liked taking those too so I could have some stops in the climbing. I really have terrible breathing out here. I totally breathe through my mouth and I know that’s not the best way. At home, when I was running, I had trained myself to breathe through my nose and out my mouth, and it worked. But on these uphills, I struggle more. My legs also burn, which sometimes gets hard. I always hated that burn when I rowed crew. I talked with Prometheus a lot today about pain tolerance and fear and all of that. 
We actually talked about skiing this morning, as we were descending into Newfound Gap. He said that skiing gives you that way of moving that can help with hiking, as you sort of glide your way down. This dang sport seems to help with everything. Lol this winter I’m going to learn. Making it a goal now! Better balance and movement to come! We also talked about fear factor. I am scared of a lot of things. And I’m sure you can all see that in my blog. I get scared when there’s a steep slope and end up covered in mud because I don’t know how to go down it. I get scared when there are rocky climbs and when the weather is bad. It’s definitely tough for me sometimes. I have to say, I never grew up doing crazy things because I was always scared, but I wish I had, because you can knock that fear out if you expose yourself to it while young. I literally watched little kids glide down the mountain while I was skiing with my dad and I was so scared. The kids had no fear. I am conquering a lot of fears out here and that’s really been good for me, but I do think about why those fears are there a lot. 
I also struggle with pain. I really can’t stand a lot of pain physically. I’m sure there is a mental component to it, but I definitely don’t like to feel pain. That thigh burning is not my fave. I can deal with other pain like my back or feet though. My feet definitely started to ache today and I pushed through it. But it was hard. I’ve honestly always wondered about things like tattoos. I think they’re cool, especially if they tell a story, but I would want it to be someplace I could cover it if I got one. I just don’t think I could ever deal with the pain of getting one. 
This is so far from where I was when I was younger. I was against tattoos and dying my hair and all of that. And I dyed my hair this summer. I got a lot of “post-breakup” stereotype crap haha but I seriously just woke up one morning and wanted to do it. I don’t know, I just felt free and young and wanted to do it. I really wasn’t thinking, “omg I need to be a new person now and go change my hair.” I just wanted to do it. This girl from my college that I had had a tricky friendship with dyed her hair two weeks after me and it took all the wind out of my sails. It was a very controlling and unhealthy friendship, and I needed to distance myself. It still felt like she was controlling me though. I couldn’t even dye my hair without her having to one-up me. And it may have been a total coincidence, but it upset me. I made a long Instagram post because it made me so mad, but I definitely calmed down and tried to focus on myself and my decisions and making myself happy about them. I really loved dying my hair. I felt really pretty and good about myself. And I was really starting to love myself and my body. I was opening myself up to change instead of continuing to be the person who “will never do this or that”. 
Anyway, I was reflecting on all of this today while I was hiking and it was so good to process it. It was so nice to talk to Prometheus too and have that company and conversation while hiking. I really didn’t have that for three weeks or so, and it felt good. It made the mileage go by faster. 
We reached a mountain, Charlies Bunion, or something like that. There was a side trail to the view and we followed it. There was a rock that you could climb out onto for a view and a cool picture. Hot Sauce climbed it so fast! I slowly made my way out onto the rock and Prometheus and Joe took some awesome pictures of me. I climbed back down and Hot Sauce went for a rock that was even steeper. She and Prometheus climbed that, but I stayed down. I was nervous! There’s that fear again! Prometheus rock climbs a lot at home and has taught it, so he’s really a pro. We took some funny pics out on that rock before and were joking with each other throughout the day. He’s great! 
Another trail magic occurred, third of the day!! Two ladies came up and offered me Starbucks packets, but they couldn’t find them so they gave me basically all the other food in their pack. They were day hikers headed to Newfound Gap and home today. They gave me a banana, clementine, bars, crackers, and drink packets, and I split it with everyone. 
We continued on and got to another peak, Laurel Mountain. It was a long climb and my feet were starting to kill me. I was wondering where the dang summit was for a while. There were lots of mini views. It was beautiful and a nice hike, but I was getting pretty tired. We took a lot of pictures and headed down to the shelter. It was a bit of a long downhill and I could feel pain right underneath my toes. A weird place in my opinion, but I still had pain there. My back and shoulders were also hurting, but not as much.
Prometheus was so nice and let me hike in front of him. It made me feel like he had my back and was watching out for me, and I really liked that. I have always struggled with being the “last” or “slowest” and it felt good to lead for a bit. I remember my counselors doing that on my Overland trips. We always had a “leader of the day”. Prometheus is a great leader/counselor/helper/teacher! He’s going to be a great dad someday if he has kids. 
We got to the shelter sign and it was again another .3 off trail! Ugh these shelters! Why! It was late and we were wiped and the shelter was full. We found that out while getting water before heading down. We got down to the shelter and set up. My feet were killing me, and I took off my shoes and realized how bad it was. Sorry for those easily grossed out, but the skin was gone under and in between my toes and it was raw. I knew I had a situation, but hobbled over to have dinner after setting up my tent. 
I saw Hermione and Green Slouch again, which was awesome! They asked me how I was and I complained a bit about my feet and a woman inside heard me. She came out and said she was a registered nurse. She gave me some wipes and was very nice. She took a look at my foot and was concerned. She told me it could get infected and would take me off trail. I definitely didn’t want to hear that. She told me to air my feet out and so did Hot Sauce, so I sat there with no socks for a bit and wiped my foot. I was cold. I couldn’t finish my dinner because I wasn’t hungry enough and it was really getting dark. I packed up my bag and heaved it onto the filled cables. I headed to my tent and put on very thin liners, as suggested by Hot Sauce. Here’s hoping my feet heal. What a long day! 
A lot of reflecting and processing today! And a lot of company and fun and trail magic too! Longest day so far! Woot woot!
Little Debbie ","Mt. Collins Shelter
",Pecks Corner Shelter,"Apr 17, Wed",15.90
Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611097,"Today offered a different kind of trail magic! Prometheus and Hot Sauce were the ultimate saviors. I woke up to Prometheus lightly shaking my tent and I felt absolutely wiped. 16 miles just drained me and no amount of sleep seemed to help. I’ve been known to go to sleep pretty late and then sleep in pretty late, but my schedule definitely has changed on the trail. I’m also a very deep sleeper, which has its pros and cons. It means I can sleep through snoring if I am fully asleep before it starts, but it also means I sleep through alarms. I got up when Prometheus came over and slowly started to get my stuff together. He ended up tenting further away from the shelter, so I couldn’t see his tent from where I was. I was hoping he and Hot Sauce were taking their time too. 
My foot hurt quite a bit and was annoying to walk on. I packed up my stuff in a heap inside my bag because Prometheus said he wanted to do a shakedown. I walked up to his tent area. He has a super nice tent. It’s 3 pounds, but really spacious and nice. He and Hot Sauce were sitting in front of it eating breakfast. I plopped my stuff down. 
Prometheus came over to look at my foot. He used my bandana that I got in Franklin to rest my foot on his leg so he could see. I cleaned my feet off with wipes and he gave me this tea tree oil to rub on them. He said it would have vitamins for the raw part of my feet. I aired them out for a while. Prometheus said I was on the road to Trench Foot, which is essentially when there is too much moisture and the skin rots away. I know, it’s gross, and I’m sorry to my readers. But it was really happening to my feet. I have leather boots that don’t breathe at all, and I was wearing liners and Darn Tough socks together. You should really take your shoes and socks off at least once during the day, or at night when you get to camp. My issue is just being wiped. I would call it laziness, but no part of hiking 16 miles is lazy. There is a lot to do when you get to camp and it is almost like chores after a long work day. But the issue is that my “work day” is all physical, and those chores are too. To me the idea of walking .4 down to the water source and soaking my feet and then coming back up and filtering water, hanging my food bag, and setting my tent up, is just tiring and time consuming. I haven’t been washing my feet at camp, but I also haven’t been taking my socks off every day. I think I’ve come around more to the idea of the camp chores, and once I realized how bad my feet were, I woke up and knew I needed to make time for these chores, even if they annoy me after a long day. The nurse last night said it would take me off trail and I don’t want that. At home, my hygiene is so important to me, but I guess since I can’t do most of the things I’d like to, like shower, I just gave up on it all. Hygiene out here actually needs to be more important than it was at home or I’m going to get injured and sick and be taken off trail. I am going to switch shoes as well at some point. I started off with boots, as the REI staff felt they would give my feet the padding they’d need to get used to long hiking days and tough terrain. I purchased a pair of Altra trail runners as well and they are very light and breathable, but don’t have the same kind of padding and protection. They’re basically sneakers. I think I’ll try to get another couple of hundred miles out of my boots and then make the switch. I also have very wide feet, and although I’ve always sort of known that, I officially found out when I was shopping for shoes at REI. They measured my feet and were kind of shocked about the width. They put me in a men’s wide shoe. Honestly, I’ve loved my boots. I tied them pretty tight at the beginning because they were big, but my feet totally swelled into them and now they fit well. I needed to loosen the laces now and Prometheus pointed that out and helped me do that. I think they work perfectly now with the laces loosened and my new approach to foot care. 
Anyway, back to this morning’s activities! There was a light breeze which made it chilly, despite the warm temperatures today. Hot Sauce went to work on my pack. She put a bunch of stuff in a pile that she claimed I would not need, and she repacked my pack. It was amazing how she was able to save space and fit things differently. The pile of things I didn’t need wasn’t huge, but she put it all into the day pack that came with my pack and wrapped it up. I have never used that day pack, and I don’t feel like I will right now, even though it’s nice to have. There is also something called the pack brain, or the flap that goes over the whole pack, and she took that off too. She fit my tent in the bottom, loose, and then fit my food bag in sideways to even out the weight. 
My pack looked great. I was apprehensive about giving stuff away. I’ve struggled with this for a while until this fall, when I purged my room and threw so much stuff away. If it doesn’t bring you joy or use, it is just stuff. I enjoyed reminiscing and going through it all, but I let it all go. I was ready to do the same here, but in the woods I couldn’t get rid of anything. I would send the day pack and the rest home with my parents in town. 
I unpacked my bag so I could see what Hot Sauce did and practice packing it myself, and because I needed to take my food bag out to have breakfast. Prometheus put KT tape on my feet. There were scabs from what appeared to be my feet rubbing against my shoes around the ankle. He put the tape on that so it wouldn’t get worse. He said to let my feet breathe today rather than covering the raw skin with a bandaid or tape, so I put just one pair of my Darn Tough socks on, without liners. Everyone packed up and I put my pack on to test the new feel of it, and we headed off.
Because of my shakedown and feet, we had a slow morning. Hot Sauce also seemed a little hesitant to hike today. Everybody seemed tired and slow going. We were originally going to hike 13 miles, but we decided to hike 5 to the nearest shelter. It would help my feet heal, help me get adjusted to the pack feel, and help everyone rest up a bit from that long day. We walked out of the shelter trail and stopped for water (Prometheus was very kind and got it for me). 
When I got to the top, I saw everyone! It was awesome!! Naners, Red Wiggler, Mountain Laurel and Chad, Lexi, Honey Buns, and a few others I didn’t know. I was so excited to see them all! They had started hiking earlier in the day and this was their lunch break. We were all headed to the same shelter, and there was a bit of a concern because it was going to rain tomorrow and it might be packed. We headed on and were passed at different points by Honey Buns and Lexi, as well as Naners and the people she was with. I also saw Ringer and I was so so happy! He’s just an angel man. His knee is doing well and he’s been pressing on like a champ. He was going to do a 20-mile day! Holy cow! Also, I can’t help it, I do want to share how he got his name. He told a story about when he was younger and tried to fit donuts on a certain body part... he claims he fit two and they were eclairs. Haha. I’m sorry, I just love this guy. Hot Sauce and I took our time because we were both just wiped and not really feeling the hiking today. Prometheus hiked on and got to the shelter. At the time he arrived, it was full and the tent sites were too. People started to leave though, as they realized they could make it to the next shelter by dark and be closer to exiting the Smokey’s in the storm. 
When they left, we arrived and snagged their spots. Great timing! It meant we wouldn’t have to pack up a wet tent tomorrow. We were hoping no section hikers would come and kick us out. I wore Prometheus’ flip flops and changed into my sleep clothes. It was getting very crowded and people were all over the shelter and tent areas. I want to say 50-70 people were there. We stayed inside the shelter to cook because there was literally no room to cook outside. I made a Mountain House meal, but really couldn’t finish it. We didn’t hike very far today and I wasn’t very hungry. I had no service and was getting very anxious about plans with my parents tomorrow. I walked up the shelter trail a bit and got some service, but my parents were at dinner so I waited a bit, but still didn’t know the exact plan. I told my mom to plan for the worst weather-wise tomorrow and just come in the late afternoon. 
Prometheus helped me hang my food bag and I got into my sleeping bag with some whiskey. Very much needed with my anxiety about the weather and meeting up with my parents tomorrow. We also had a 15.5-mile day planned, which added to the anxiety. Hopefully it all goes well!
Song of the day: “Takin’ it to the Streets” by The Doobie Brothers. I listened to music again today. I’ve had a little break while hiking with others and having conversations. I love this song and it was such a jam on the sunny day.
Little Debbie","Pecks Corner Shelter
",Tri-Corner Knob Shelter,"Apr 18, Thu",5.20
Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611098,"And another long day!! 15.5 miles this time! We woke up to pouring rain, as expected. There was some occasional thunder and lightning too. We cooked in the shelter and some guy came in and scolded us. He was super passive aggressive and said “I thought I knew the difference between hikers and tourists”. *dramatic pause while he walks out of shelter* this is not a movie! This is real life! Haha but seriously... there is a rule about not cooking in the shelters because it attracts bears, but you are allowed to cook 5 feet from the shelter in the open air with wind to carry the scent. If a bear smells food inside the shelter, it’s also smelling what’s being cooked outside. It’s going to come near the shelter regardless. I respect the rules of the Smokey’s, but it was again packed outside and we were just doing the best we could since it was pouring too. I was very clean about my food and so were Prometheus and Hot Sauce. There were no crumbs or trace of it. That comment definitely got us upset. There are people on this trail that throw trash in the privies and we are not doing that. Someone has to dig through that pile of human waste to pull the trash out. Yeah, it’s disgusting. And we simply cooked 5 feet from where everyone else was cooking because it was crowded and pouring rain. No trace, no poop digging needed. I recognize that we were not following the rules, but I really stand by our decision and was upset by that comment.
We packed up and headed out about 9:30. Hot Sauce and Prometheus were originally going to just hike 7 miles to the next shelter, which was also why I was worried about hiking alone in this weather and trying to meet my parents. They decided this morning to hike the full 15.5 instead all the way down to the gap. They wanted to come into town with me so they could have a shower and a bed and then we would all shuttle back to the same place on Sunday. 
Almost immediately after we stepped foot on trail, it was like a waterfall. There was a flash flood warning for the area and we were literally in the flood. Water was pouring down the trail. It was not even a trail anymore, just a rushing stream. I was so thankful for my waterproof boots. I was also wearing my rain pants, so before the water got deep, my feet were dry and I was doing well. Today would have been sucky to have those sneakers, although Prometheus and Hot Sauce had them and were doing fine. 
We actually had a great morning despite the conditions. We played “never have I ever” and sang a bunch of songs. We told stories and Prometheus said “one time at band camp” every time and it was so funny. It was really great. It all went downhill when we started to get cold and were not so comfortable anymore in our gear. Everything got soaked, as expected, but it was cold out. Prometheus couldn’t feel his hands anymore so he stopped using his poles so he could wrap his hands under his sleeves. My gloves are windproof, but not waterproof, so there was no point in wearing them. My hands were cold, but not losing feeling. I wiggled my fingers while using my poles. The chafing of the pole strap on my wet, cold skin actually caused it to bleed, so I stopped using the straps on my poles.
Hot Sauce had the same issue as Prometheus with her hands and stopped using her poles too. There was not as much wind today as the last miserable rain day I experienced, so I was happy. I must say, wind is my least favorite form of weather here. It was relentless the other day and was like walking in a hurricane, and every other day, it’s just been cold. I don’t like wind! The Smokey’s certainly had a lot of wind. I was so ready to get out. But today was not too bad wind-wise. 
We reached the first shelter, which was 7 miles in. Prometheus used his Garmin to text my parents, which was very nice of him. I had no service, as expected, but I was still anxious and worried about keeping them posted. We said we had 8 miles left and would be there around 5, and my mom got the message. Originally, Prometheus wanted to stop at this shelter and dry off. His idea was smart because of the concerns for hypothermia and my feet, but Hot Sauce and my concerns were also valid. We were worried if we stopped and took everything off, it wouldn’t dry quickly and we’d get colder standing there, and then end up having to put the still-wet clothes on or stay there. And even if we put dry clothes on underneath, that would be all the dry clothes we had, and that’s not necessarily safe either. I personally just thought back to the other day. When I arrived at that shelter, I did not get warm until I got in my sleeping bag and full dry gear. It would be the same today, and if I took out my sleeping bag, I would pretty much be staying. And I couldn’t because I wanted to meet my parents and we had plans. 
We pushed on from the shelter. My feet were soaked by this point. The water had gotten deep enough that my whole boot had made it under and water found its way in. It was like walking in buckets again, and we were only halfway. I was concerned about my feet, but they weren’t cold or hurting at this point; just wet. As we hiked on, they got cold. Prometheus was so sweet and asked frequently about my feet to make sure I was doing well. He also hiked behind me and that protective instinct is so great about him. He also helped me pull up my pants. Haha my rain pants are too big on me now... I’m assuming weight loss, but my pack also pushes my pants down sometimes. It can be annoying because if the skin is exposed, it’s cold and rubs up against the backpack, causing chafing. He held my pack up and I pulled my pants up all the way to my belly button. They were cold and wet, but it felt good to have my back covered.
Hot Sauce was having a hard time and I felt bad for her. I really could relate to it all because I had felt that way. Prometheus and Hot Sauce had helped me so much. I was in such a bad way, having bad days and “I want to quit” days until I met them. We let her know how amazing she is and how great this journey is that she’s on. She really is amazing and I’m so impressed she completed 700 miles last year. I have no doubt she’ll finish it this year. Having people to get through the shit together really helps, excuse my language. She hiked ahead of us for a bit earlier, and when Prometheus and I were alone, I fell. It was a bad fall. The water rushing down the trail was so deep and muddy that you couldn’t see the rocks underneath, and I made a big step down into the water and right onto a rock. My ankle gave out and I actually yelled in pain. Prometheus tried to catch my bag to slow my fall, but he caught my rain cover instead. Haha. I actually didn’t get too wet despite falling in the water, but I needed to get up in case water made its way under my clothes.
I stood up and walked on, and Prometheus was very concerned. He told me I’m stubborn. Haha this is very true. I was determined to keep walking, even though I probably did damage my ankle. It really hurt to step down and have it give out. But I am stubborn! I joked and said it’s because I’m a Leo and we’re basically the most stubborn sign besides Taurus. I know I know, it’s not real, but I was just joking with him. I kept walking and that’s when we found Hot Sauce and talked to her. It made her smile to find out I fell on my butt in the water. Fall number two for Debbie! 
As we continued, the rain let up. We had a mountain to climb before the final descent out of the Smokey’s. Thankfully it wasn’t raining for that climb. We stayed together and made it up the mountain. Prometheus stopped for a snack at the top. We didn’t make time for lunch today with the gross weather, so we just did snacks, but Prometheus was really hungry and food fuels the body! I had service at the top of the mountain, and with little rain, texted my mom that we just had 5.5 miles left and it was all downhill! Yay! 
We started hiking down and it was the same waterfall we had experienced earlier. But, it was not raining and it was getting warm as we got to lower elevation! Yay! Prometheus was being silly and on his phone behind us, making my giggle his ringtone. Haha if you know me, you know I make a lot of loud, weird sounds. I know, I’m a loud person. It actually has been a major insecurity for me because I can’t hear how loud I am, and some people have been very critical of me. It’s part of who I am. I’m loud and love to laugh real big! I definitely have learned to filter it when I know it’s not the right time, but otherwise I am unapologetically myself. Prometheus recorded my laugh and made it his ringtone. It was very funny. Hot Sauce and I were having a fun conversation about proms and formals and planning committees and college. The sun had come out and we were enjoying the warmth and hike down. 
Unfortunately, after all the water had run down the mountain or off the sides, we were left with mud. So much mud. It was like stepping through quicksand and it almost pulled my boot off several times. My feet were still soaking, but now my shoes were covered in mud too. And I fell again. This time didn’t hurt. It was just a slip in the mud. Again I didn’t get any mud on myself, miraculously. I have a talent for slipping in mud and not ending up muddy except for that one time when I purposely sat down to get down a slope and ended up muddy. Haha. Prometheus took a selfie with me on the ground. He really is such a goon. 
We made it to Davenport Gap Shelter, which is about a mile from the Gap itself and is surrounded by fence to keep the bears out. We kept walking and that last mile felt like forever, as it often does on these long days, but we were all warm and drying up and in good spirits. Hot Sauce was excited because she saw little purple orchids coming up out of the ground.
We made our way down and there they were! My goober parents! Haha my mom had her phone out and got a video of me walking down. It was great to see them and I was so relieved it all worked out. Davenport Gap is on a mountain road, and I had warned my parents about that. But they made it and it worked! We all put our packs in the car and it was starting to rain again, so perfect timing! We drove off and my dad showed us where water had come onto the road and said it had been a little treacherous driving up. We made it onto a main road, but could see the river going by us. It was rushing and had risen to the tops of the bridges it flowed under. There wasn’t flooding on the road, but it was very close to the road. We were all happy to be in a car and were amazed by the water situation. We were literally hiking in this mess! 
It was about an hour to Hot Springs. When we got there, we dropped Hot Sauce and Prometheus off at a motel and went to our Inn. It was a very nice, homey Inn. It’s a house, with a rustic, home vibe. We had a suite with two rooms. It had an electric fireplace that was complicated to work, a main sitting room, a bathroom, and two bedrooms. I was freezing. I brought my bag in and my parents went to get their’s and they came back and I was in the shower! The water pressure was a little hard, but it was still so nice to shower. And to take my boots off! My poor feet. They actually looked okay, despite a 15-mile day in soaking wet boots and an hour drive. I walked around without socks on to let them dry, and then put my dry clothes on to go to dinner.
We went to a Tavern and I was starving. I ordered mozzarella sticks (with meat in them, delicious), tator tots, and a burger with fries. My mom got wings and I tried those too. It was all so good. Nothing like fried, greasy food to hit the spot! The waitress recommended a good beer for me and I loved it. I had two. I also ran into so many people! Prometheus and Hot Sauce had met up with a friend Heather, and they were there. And Boulder! Anyone remember him?!? He said he didn’t recognize me because I’ve lost so much weight. I guess? It was great to see all the hikers and we had an awesome meal. 
We came back to the Inn and I totally passed out. I woke up at 1am and brushed my teeth because I’m anal about that, but fell right back asleep. What a long day! Glad it all worked out and I’m in a warm bed in a town and my parents and friends are here.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611101,"Rest day number one! Today was a zero day with my parents, but we went on an excursion to Asheville/Biltmore, so it was full of activity too! We had breakfast at the Inn, which was nice. The Innkeeper is so lovely and threw in a load of laundry for me. It’s normally not included here, and the laundromat in town was vandalized. There is not much in Hot Springs folks! I was really expecting so much more. I was expecting baths and spas and tourists. Lol nope. It’s a tiny town with one little street of shops and then the resort, which was closed all weekend due to the flooding I was walking in. Haha. 
Anyway, I threw the dirtiest clothes in there and wore my dry sleep clothes. I would’ve liked to wash those too, but didn’t want to push two loads on the Inn and the sleep clothes didn’t smell nearly as bad. We headed out. It was about 50 minutes to Asheville, which is an actual city. I definitely didn’t know that. I don’t know a lot about this area to be honest, but I had heard amazing things about Hot Springs so I figured there was nothing in Asheville. Other way around! Asheville has an airport too so it really has a lot there. 
The Biltmore Estate is like a city of its own.  This place is insane. It’s 8,000 acres. The hiker in me was calculating the mileage from one end of the estate to the other and how long it would take me. Definitely not doing it in those long dresses they used to wear! We parked in one of a gazillion parking lots and walked up to the house. We spent some time walking through the ridiculous gardens. They were stunning, with bright beautiful flowers everywhere. And the greenhouse was filled with color and beauty. But it was extensive. Also probably the nicest bathrooms I’ve used in a while haha. Now to go marry a Vanderbilt... just kidding!
We walked back up to the house to tour the inside. We had a timed ticket and it was starting to rain as we waited outside. Perfect timing! The inside was gorgeous as well. There were a ton of flowers and plants in the main entrance, and then the tour led us through sitting rooms, guest rooms, the master bedrooms, the kitchens, the pool, exercise room, changing rooms, and back up to the grand dining hall. That place was stunning. It actually reminded me a lot of one of the rooms at Windsor Castle in England. It felt like American Royalty. It had a 7-story high ceiling and an extensive table adorned with flowers. Throughout the house, there were mannequins with the clothing that the Vanderbilts would have worn, and in this room they had the elegant dresses of the ladies. It was pretty impressive how they had people look through the photographs and design the clothes based on that. 
There was a Billiard Room and Smoking Room and then the exit. Wow. The whole house was a lot. And the audio guide was honestly kind of funny. It was conversations the staff would have had with the Vanderbilts and this one housekeeper kept chasing the dog around. It was more interactive than historical, but I did learn some about the things and life in the rooms. 
We exited the house/mansion/castle/palace thing and it was starting to rain again. There was a cafe and my mom treated me to a bagel and cookie. My family has been known to share snacks as meals, sorry mom. My dad had a clif bar and an apple. That doesn’t really do it for me. Haha. I need a meal, something to fill me up and keep going. I was getting hangry towards the end of that tour. My friends joke with me because they don’t think I drink enough water and I say it’s because my family always shared two water bottles amongst the five of us while day-hiking. Clif bars and two waters! Haha. In all seriousness, I am grateful for everything my parents did this weekend; it was such a treat. But I tease them a bit because that bagel was a special event! It was actually delicious because I haven’t had a bagel in so long. And if you know me, you know I loveee bagels. I have one every day for lunch back home. I don’t really like sandwiches; I’ve never liked cold soggy meat aka cold cuts. Lunch has always been tricky for me, but I love bagels so much. I know they’re a breakfast food to many, but they work for me! 
Anyway, we walked back toward the car. It was really starting to rain now. We got some more pics of the house as we walked away. I saw a sign that said “Diana”. I was pumped, maybe I do belong in the Vanderbilt line! Haha. It was just a statue of her. Goddess of the hunt. I followed the signs in the rain and got a pic of the statue. It looked out over the whole estate. I felt special. Yay Diana’s! Haha. Can’t say I’ve been hunting too much in the woods, but I hunt after my dreams! 
I got pretty wet, but I didn’t care because I had a car option and warmth that I wouldn’t have had on the trail. We drove to the Winery. It was about 10 countries away from the house. They must make bank here. They have gift shops and an Inn and restaurants and the Estate and the Winery and Creamery and Village and Stables. Craziness. Our tickets came with a free wine tasting so of course we partook. 
The line was long, but moved quickly. The lady that served us wine was very friendly and helpful. We selected 6 wines we wanted to try from the list. I went for Chardonnay and Rose and then some sweet wines. I love sweet wine. It’s dangerous because I could drink a whole bottle of that without realizing it. It’s so delicious. I loved the sweet white that I tried. Yum yum! My dad probably ate an entire bowl of the crackers they give you when you have the munchies. It was so funny. She gave us more crackers. And she picked me out of the whole group to give a bonus tasting of the house Chardonnay! Ahh. That was so nice of her. 
Unfortunately, my ankle was bothering me at this point, but I was elevating it as I drank and hoping it would feel better. That fall really did hurt. The wine helped haha. Best medicine! 
We all were feeling pretty good, as many are leaving wine tastings. Italy’s was an adventure haha. We had people wandering the streets of small Italian towns and missing the tour bus back. That wine, I tell ya! The lady had given us a recommendation for an Italian restaurant in Asheville because I was craving pasta. 
We drove to Asheville and arrived at Vinnie’s. The locals will get mad that I’m publicizing it, but holy cow this place was good. It doesn’t get better than a family-owned Italian restaurant with the family recipes. The wait was an hour, but we hung out at the bar and got drinks. My mom and I had the “painkiller”. It was delicious. It started to clear out and we got our table. I was starving. We ordered garlic knots and these fried risotto balls filled with mozzarella. I practically inhaled the garlic knots. For my main course, I had Sunday Gravy, the grandma’s recipe. I don’t even know where to start. It was so so good. I was getting full from my garlic knots situation, but I savored the bites I had of this spaghetti. We had delicious wine with it and it was all just amazing. If I had room, I would’ve gotten their cannolis. One cannoli hope! Hardy har har Diana, so funny! But alas, I took the Sunday Gravy home with a wonderfully full stomach. 
It was about an hour back. Once we got onto the small town roads, there was an annoying truck with super bright headlights on our tail. It was really dark on these roads. We finally arrived back at our Inn and stored my gravy in the mini fridge. We passed out and this time I didn’t get up to brush my teeth. Oh well! Too tired from all the wonderful activities of the weekend! It was an amazing day and my parents treated me to a lovely excursion. I was very thankful. I have a bottle of that sweet wine and I’m going to pour it in a Gatorade bottle to bring on trail. That will be such a treat!

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611104,"Rest day number two! Today I took an extra zero in Hot Springs. Prometheus got the stomach bug or food poisoning yesterday and had a rough day. He was not ready to go back on trail, and honestly, because I had been with my parents and traveling, I wasn’t either. I wanted a chill sleep day. Zeros are always spent shopping or doing laundry or other chores. The Biltmore certainly wasn’t that, but it was activity. I was glad to stay another day. My parents again were very wonderful with accommodations and making sure I was set up here. They headed back to CT today so they could get some rest before the work week. And it’s Easter! Happy Easter everyone! 
I had breakfast with my parents and they gave me some things they brought down. I asked my mom for new liner socks that have the toes separated, which could help with the rubbing and rawness I had. I also asked her for a new sleeping pad since I was starting to be uncomfortable in mine. I also asked for a butt pad, or essentially a small square of foam padding made by thermarest. I’ve noticed a lot of people on the trail with it and I wanted one. When you’re at camp and making dinner, you really only have dirt or logs to sit on, especially if the shelter table is full. This light pad is the perfect way to have a comfy seat wherever you need to sit. And you can strap it to the outside of your pack to make that easy. I had money to spend at REI, because my mom returned the stuff I sent home back at Neel’s Gap, but she didn’t have my debit card, so they could only refund the money on a gift card. Might as well use it! 
I sent her home with the day pack and pack brain, as well as the old sleeping pad I had. It was great to see my parents and I’m thankful they came down here for this trip. We had a fun time and I got treated to tours and wine and food, which was such a wonderful break from my trail life.
When they left, I stayed in the Inn and it was a bit lonely. I was going to move rooms because I was in the suite with my parents, but now they were gone. The new room wasn’t ready, so I hung out downstairs. I met an older man who was here to spend Easter with his son and daughter. The daughter had a little girl who was so adorable. Her grandpa was hiding plastic Easter eggs all over the lawn of the Inn and she was running around in her pretty little dress with a bow in her hair. It was so sweet. A scene like that always makes me so excited to have a family, even though I know I’m young. She came up to me and showed me her jelly beans and was truly the sweetest little girl. It was a pretty place to hunt for the eggs too. They host weddings at this Inn and have twinkle lights and a fountain in the lawn. I love twinkle lights. My wedding someday will be covered in them. 
It took a little while, but I finally moved into my new room. The Innkeeper was amazing again and had given me her favorite room. It had a big bed and a balcony and a jacuzzi. I was really looking forward to just passing out and doing nothing. Which is what I did. I lay down on the bed and passed out for a bit. When I woke up, I went downstairs and she heated up my Sunday Gravy for me. It was still amazing the second time around. Omg. I practically ate the plate. I went back up and wrote my blog! I had already written a few days, just hadn’t posted them. I finished writing the past week’s worth of entries and then headed to dinner with Hot Sauce and Prometheus.
I met them at a tavern and got chicken fingers and spring rolls. I know, I eat like a child. Chicken fingers are good for life okay? They are not just for kids. Ugh. I got a beer, yay adulting! It was all very good. Prometheus was still a little down from his rough day yesterday, but Hot Sauce was in great spirits. We joked about my posture. Maybe it’s because I’m inhaling food, but I am pretty much bent over the table now. It’s because I’m tired, okay! And my poor back is so confused about why I keep putting so much weight on it every day. I really noticed the difference and found it hard to sit up. We were also talking about a video of a mamma bear and her four little cubs that had been shared online recently. It’s really a sweet video. Prometheus joked and said “one out of four bears make it to Katahdin!” We went to a bar afterwards and it was fun. Prometheus loves Subaru’s and we teased him about it. He has a bright blue Crosstrek. That’s a cool car and I would consider getting it someday. I want to buy a new car when I save some more money after the trail, so maybe this one! He said he’d get me a discount! Um yes! 
I headed back to my Inn and they headed back to the hostel they’re staying at. We had a nice night and I was glad we all stayed the extra day. I finally posted all of the blogs and am finishing it off with this one! What a wonderful weekend it’s been, and things are on an upward trend, which is awesome!

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611929,"Ugh. A toxic end to my day today. Will write about that later. This morning I woke up tired. I really don’t know if I should go back to coffee. I stopped having it actually because I got my wisdom teeth out in January and they recommend no caffeine while taking the drugs. I just never went back. I’ve always had issues with withdrawal on the weekends because I sleep later and wake up with a headache, craving that caffeine. I was happy with the results after I stopped having it, but I feel like I need it sometimes. 
Anyway, I got up and texted Prometheus. I went down to have breakfast. It was biscuits and gravy. I was being picky and didn’t want the gravy. I had eggs and the biscuits and yogurt and granola and orange juice. I went back upstairs and turned on the jets in my bath. I put my feet in and put my ankle against the jets. It definitely helped soothe it. 
I took another shower because why not! I heaped everything together so I could get out by checkout and set it up in the sitting room downstairs. I left some of the food for when I pass through the town again (they were very nice and let me leave my box there) and packed up the rest. I walked down to meet Prometheus and Hot Sauce. We met up at Bluff Mountain Outfitters. Unfortunately, Hot Sauce was not feeling well and got whatever Prometheus had. At this point I think we all knew it was norovirus and not food poisoning. For those who don’t know, norovirus has been rampant on the trail recently. You hear all sorts of random stats, but apparently 50% of the “hiker bubble” got it. I was happy to have stayed in my own hotel room, far from the sick hikers.
We hung out for a bit and decided it would be a low mileage day. We were looking at shuttles to take us to Davenport Gap and found one that could take us to Standing Bear Farm, which is 3 miles or so from the Gap. We decided to do that. It was an hour and a half before they arrived, so we used that time to shop and weigh our packs. I wanted hand sanitizer. I’ve mainly been using wipes, which definitely make me feel clean, but hand sanitizer is good too. I also needed a Gatorade bottle for my bottle of wine. I guess alcohol can degrade plastic, so a thicker plastic is needed. I got one of the big gatorades and slowly worked through it. I realized I didn’t have a corkscrew for my wine and should’ve asked my hotel to open it for me. I was frustrated at that silly mistake. I bought a super cheap one at Dollar General and opened it that way. I had asked the restaurants in town to help me, but they all said it was illegal to open wine that wasn’t sold there and whatnot. Anyway, I figured it out and poured it into the Gatorade bottle. It actually didn’t even fill up the bottle. Big Gatorade! 
Now came some upsetting news. I weighed my pack. Bluff Mountain Outfitters has a scale just for packs. Hot Sauce wanted to see how her shakedown had played out. I was eager to see too. It was so disappointing. My pack weighed 45 pounds. That’s just way too much weight. Now keep in mind, the wine I just added was probably a pound, and the sleeping pad I asked my mom for was a full pound and a half heavier than my last one. I also just added food. My pack itself weighs 4.4 pounds. It’s a heavy pack. A lot of people try to ultralight the trail, and I respect them, but comfort is also important to me. I was happy when my pack was 34, and I knew it would gain weight, but sheesh. 
We were all pretty disappointed given the shakedown. We discussed another shakedown and prepared for the shuttle. It arrived and we got in. The lady driving had a doggie ahhh and we listened to classic rock with the windows open. My hair got all messy, but it was nice. Standing Bear Farm is an interesting place. I had considered staying here at some point and abandoned that thought because it’s not too far from Hot Springs and that’s where I’d meet my parents. Well, I ended up staying here! 
Overall thoughts about the place are money-related ugh I know I think too much about that. But seriously, everything they do is an “add-on” and I dislike that kind of process. It was $15 just to set up my tent on their grass. I could’ve set my tent up for free five feet away. And then dinner was $10 and breakfast was $5. And then laundry was extra and showers were extra and resupply was extra. It’s like one of those scam commercials! Only $15, (*plus shipping and handling and a fee every year for the rest of your life*) get it now! 
Anyway, they just seemed money hungry rather than catering to the hikers and their needs and I didn’t like that. The owners were smoking weed and it just didn’t have the warm vibe of a hostel. But it was an interesting place regardless. We found out that last weekend, when we were in Hot Springs, norovirus had spread here as well and everyone was taking zeros to recover. It was also 4/20 so apparently there was a massive weed party. 
Hot Sauce seemed reluctant to stay here because of money too, since we all just stayed in Hot Springs, but we agreed it was the best option and it was late in the day. And they offered slackpacking, for a fee of course! They drove us to Davenport Gap and we hiked with no packs back to the farm. So we got in the 3 miles and got a place to stay. Slackpacking was amazing. Having no weight on my back ahh it was like flying. Prometheus and Hot Sauce actually started to run and I joined in and it felt so good. I haven’t run in so long. We ran and then walked a bit. It was so awesome without weight. It was a pretty hot day though, so we found ourselves dehydrated despite the short distance. 
We ate dinner. The options were chicken or burgers. I chose chicken, but it was a dark purple color underneath and I was grossed out. I’m picky, I know. I actually really don’t like meat with bones in it, and if I can see veins in meat I’m equally grossed out. I tend to like my meat well done because I don’t like the red, but when I’ve allowed myself to try meat that’s red, I’ve always enjoyed the flavor. Just have to get past that initial look. The life of a picky eater folks. I promise I’m miles ahead of where I was as a kid. 
Prometheus made a fire, but the wood was a bit wet, so it was not burning well. The owners and staff gathered around, as well as some hikers, and everyone was smoking weed. I was snacking on my food and candy. The toxicity came then. 
I opened my phone since there was WiFi and got snapchats from the girl I mentioned earlier (the tough college friendship) and they were in a group chat, with her claiming she never dyed her hair and that the sun just bleached it blond, so should she dye it back to brown because it looks like she dyed it and omg isn’t that terrible and she has no experience dyeing it so could we all help. Part of the reason I ended that friendship is because she just lied all the time. She was so insecure she had to make things up and use me to make herself feel good. And here we are months later and she’s still doing it. Oh hey! My hair just naturally went 3 shades lighter in the sun, so cool! Didn’t know I could naturally go blond! *eye roll* If you’re wondering why I’m still connected to her, I’ll answer that. We had the same friends and group chats at school, and her sister is my grand-little, so it’s tricky. I also don’t like to cut people out. Especially in this day in age with social media the way it is, we can’t go back on our decision to cut people out. I’m a pretty forgiving person and have thought of giving her another chance several times, but then she sends a series of snaps like that and I never want to associate with her again. 
I’ve been very reflective on my mistakes and I know I’ve made a ton, but I’m actually implementing change, because that’s the point. She went to therapy at school and said “50% of my problems are from my grandma” and then never did anything to change. First of all, no therapist ever gives you percentages. But yes, part of therapy is to identify what part of your environment may have contributed to the person you are and the the mistakes you’ve made, but part of therapy is also admitting to those mistakes and learning how to stop making them. I was very humbled by the whole experience. And I had a big dip in confidence when my breakup happened. But I have slowly built that back up. I am trying to be a person that I can be proud of. The real me. I don’t want to live under an image just to feed off of others. And I know that controlling people often send pics like these to get a rise out and that rise makes them feel better. It did get a rise out of me even though I didn’t respond to the snaps. I was angry. It made my blood boil. I rarely get that mad these days. I stayed calm by the fire, but I was furious inside. Prometheus and Hot Sauce and I talked a bit about it because it was bothering me. I wanted to blast to the world that this lying, controlling, mean girl is not who she shows the world she is and that everyone who ditched me for the lies she told is wrong, but I obviously knew that would do nothing. Sometimes we can do nothing. Sometimes people just take the easiest path. Why do bullies have cliques? People just join the power sometimes. 
I’m taking the hard path and sometimes feel powerless, but I know it will benefit me in the end. I know I will be the person I want to be. I’m already forming connections and friendships so easily and I feel so good about myself. I’ve had incredibly hard days and moments on this trip, but I have stayed calm and acted rationally and I’m proud of myself for that. One day at a time. I’m sorry to vent about her like this. I really dislike talking about others like this. But it was a very tough friendship and essentially ruined my senior spring of college. I am still very bitter, despite the amends I made with the other friends in that group. One day at a time. 
We all went to bed. Prometheus and Hot Sauce were sharing a tent to save money. I was in my tent next to them. It was the first night with my new sleeping pad. I moved around a lot to get comfortable and break it in, but I was liking it much more than my last one. 
Song of the day: “Man I feel like a woman” by Shania Twain. Hot Sauce played it during the small hike and it was such a throwback. 
Also update: I just wanted to say two things. I know that it takes me a few days to update these days. I think it’s because I’m enjoying myself out on trail and putting my focus there, but I am also updating this from a place of weak WiFi in Hot Springs, so sometimes when I’m in town, it still isn’t great for posting. If I were to quit this trip, I would post something small to let you all know. But absence these days just means I’m out enjoying the trail and will update as soon as I can! I know it’s a bunch of entries at once this way, but it’s what’s working for me right now. Other thing, I don’t publicize my blog on social media and I just wanted to say that I don’t because it has some personal stuff in it and my own insecurities with the people I’m friends with on my social media and the people I may have mentioned here (like college friend) make it tough. I also mention a lot about drinking or weed or inappropriate trail names or bathroom stuff so I just want people to be fully prepared for my honest and open blog about my life on the trail and I know a fair amount of adults follow me! One more thing: I check my mileage based on AWOL, but I’ve heard different things from folks with the Guthook app. I’m not sure what’s actually accurate. Back in the early days I thought I did a 15 because my health app said I had and folks with Guthook said it was a 15, but it only ended up being 13.8 in AWOL. So I have no idea what’s right. But that is how I check my mileage and go along the trail. Works well enough for me right now!

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611932,"It’s probably the zeros that set us back, but today we were slow-moving. Hot Sauce and I were listening to music and we were all charging our phones and relaxing. Prometheus bought me breakfast. I mainly just didn’t want to pay when I had oatmeal and other things in my food bag I could eat, but he was sweet and wanted me to have their scrambled eggs, sausage, and potatoes. Again, I was disappointed by the food. There were ants crawling on my plate and it just didn’t feel sanitary or that tasty. I ate it and then we headed over to pack up. Out tents had gotten so much condensation on them overnight. It was actually frustrating because they were soaking wet with condensation. It didn’t even rain and yet we were packing up wet tents. Part of what took time this morning was hanging the rain flys to try to dry them out. We finally got everything packed up and headed out. 
I lagged behind a bit. I think it was a combination of the zeros and my heavy pack, but my stomach was also hurting. About 20 minutes in I thought I was going to be sick and I took my pack off and clenched my stomach. Thankfully nothing happened, but I was not doing well. I sat for a bit in the middle of the trail. I knew Prometheus was frustrated by the late start and I was just hoping he and Hot Sauce would go on today and I’d find them later. But he’s too sweet and he waited for me. He and Hot Sauce stopped at the next water source and she had lunch. I caught up to them and we all agreed we weren’t going far today. 
We headed out again and Prometheus hiked behind me. I really do love how helpful he is. I was feeling pretty terrible and sluggish. I let him and Hot Sauce go ahead. They made it to Deep Gap. There was a shelter there, but it was in bad shape and everyone was camping, so we decided to camp before the shelter, in the Gap. I took my time and met up with them there. Prometheus had left little notes for me, “Deb”, in the dirt along the way. Hot Sauce wanted me to camp with her and give Prometheus space because he does so much for everyone else and sometimes he forgets to take care of himself. He claims that he grew up on a farm and there was always something to do, so he’s always on the move. It’s true though. He was making a fire and hanging a clothes line and setting up his tent before I could process it all. Trust me, on most normal days, I’m pretty good about moving and getting myself going. It’s the waking up part that is tricky for me. Waking up at 7:30 and getting out by 9 isn’t bad, for all the camp stuff to do and breakfast and whatnot, but I need to get up earlier. It wasn’t happening in the past few days with my zeros and then the sluggish mornings we’ve had as a group. And I really do like to be helpful and get things done, but I’m tired too so it’s tough. 
We all made dinner and had a really nice time. We hung the bear bags a little late and Prometheus was trying to throw the rock in the dark, which was hard. There were bear cables down at the shelter, but we didn’t want to walk down in the morning to get food. Prometheus found a good tree and he and Hot Sauce used some method that was different than the PCT method to tie it up to another tree. It worked and was high enough off the ground, as well as far enough from the trees. We stayed up late and I was pretty tired, so went to bed. Town really messes with schedules! But we had an exciting plan to go to Max Patch tomorrow and I was looking forward to it.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611933,"This morning was really tough. We all have our struggles and frustrations out here, and hiking in a group can lead to some, but this morning Hot Sauce and I had a tough talk. She told me that she and Prometheus had been discussing whether or not they wanted to add me to the group and whether or not I fit. No matter how much I understand it, because I do, it still hurt to feel like I was being talked about. She called them “team meetings”. Hot Sauce told me to my face that she was “just now warming up to me”. I had no clue. This whole time I thought they both wanted me here and were excited to bring me in. I also thought their entire trail family had Naners and Joe in it too and I never understood that Hot Sauce and Prometheus were the original two hiking together. I never meant to intrude at all; I just felt accepted.
It made me think back to younger days when I had drama with friends before. Jealously is such a terrible emotion, but I felt it a lot with friends throughout the years. And a lot of it had to do with my own insecurities, but I always got jealous when a close friend of mine found another friend and brought them in. I’ve never been on the other side of the equation and now I am. I’m the new friend that’s come in. Because I’ve been in Hot Sauce’s shoes, I was able to understand. But I do feel that I’m more secure and confident in myself these days, so I’m able to handle and balance things better. 
I had a relationship right before coming on trail and he would sometimes be spotty with timing or plans, but I was pretty easygoing about it all because I was happy with myself, and I didn’t need him to be there all the time. I wanted to get to this point and test it out in a relationship. Dating actually went really well for me and I was able to prove to myself how far I had come. I still had a past relationship on my mind and was working through my own struggles, but I was doing well. I also tested it out with my work friends and I built really wonderful friendships there too. I was able to build a nice life for myself before leaving and I proved to myself that I was totally capable of having awesome relationships in my life and being happy with myself. I actually struggled with leaving because of the bonds I had made. 
Anyway, I was now on the other side, so I was trying to understand Hot Sauce, but she did take it a little far. She was pretty mean and dug into me for pace and timing and how much attention I get from Prometheus. I thought I had the exact same pace and timing as her and I didn’t realize I was taking attention away from her. I didn’t defend myself because I knew she needed to let it out, but it was honestly making me question whether or not I could continue with them. I felt pretty horrible emotionally. Prometheus had left before us and was not there for this whole talk. Hot Sauce then left before me because I was kind of taken aback and I needed time to process. 
A man showed up, “Cut Away” was his name I think. He was section hiking. We talked for a bit and then I left. I was able to get this morning off my mind for a bit and enjoy the beautiful weather that we had. The hike was all uphill today and it felt difficult, but I drank lots of water and stopped as needed. I stopped for lunch at a road crossing. There was a water source nearby and I went and got some. There were a few men there. Two were section hikers and the rest were thru-hikers. They all were friendly, but I had to start the conversation. I ate a clif bar and had some water. One of the thru-hikers made a joke that “we’re thru-hiking until it becomes a section” and I laughed about that. I guess it could be one longgg section. The thru-hikers left and I chatted with the section hikers for a while. One of them was from Alabama, and the other was from South Carolina. The South Carolina man said he married a Northerner and we joked about each other’s mannerisms and slang. I realized a mosquito had gotten into my dirty water bottle and was floating around and I commented on it. They said “you really are from CT, aren’t you?” I wasn’t complaining, just commenting, but I did find that funny. The mosquitoes can be bad in CT too okay? And we have ticks and Lyme disease! Speaking of, I have found three ticks on me so far in my journey. I plucked them off, but not a fan! I did buy clothes treated with Permethrin that lasts for 70 washes, so I’m hoping they stay away for the most part, but I have found them! 
We all headed on, right back uphill. I was taking it slow today, but I knew that we didn’t have very far to go to Max Patch, so that’s mainly why I took my time. I enjoyed the nature and the sun and it was wonderful. There’s a ton of greenery now. It’s a bit nerve wracking to me because of poison ivy, but it’s still very nice and the flowers are pretty. I showed up at another road crossing. It was less than a mile to Max Patch. There were a few people there and a plastic bag with fresh strawberries! I had a few and chatted with them. Cut Away was there and a woman who’s name I can’t remember, as well as the guy from Alabama, Mike. A little ways down the trail was a water source. It was the last water source for a while because the summit of Max Patch has nothing. I filled up my Platypus and continued on. I met two other men at the water source. It’s getting hard to remember everyone’s names. I think that part of my experience has definitely changed. I was excited by every hiker I met back when I started, but there are so many now it’s less exciting. 
The hike up Max Patch was not too bad. The path had a set of wooden stairs that led up and the view started to appear as I went up. My pack was heavier with the water, but it was so exciting to see that view. It was beautiful. I got all the way up to the summit and set my pack down. I hiked back down a bit with my GoPro to get a video of it all. When I got back up, I sat down for a bit. Prometheus had texted me earlier and I responded now and told him what happened this morning and that I needed some space. He was nearby and came over to talk. We chatted for a while and it was nice to clear things up. 
We set up our tents and Hot Sauce came over. Things are okay with us and she set up her sleeping pad and sleeping bag to “cowboy camp”. We made dinner and relaxed. Prometheus finished off my dinner; it was beef stroganoff. I’m normally not a fan of mushrooms, but I’ve eaten this meal before and it wasn’t bad. Tonight I wasn’t really enjoying it. It was chilly so I took my sleeping bag out and got in it. I took a time-lapse on my GoPro of the sunset. It was a bit hidden behind some clouds, but it was nice. 
The stars came out and it was beautiful. There were so many. In the distance there were lights of towns and I have to say that was pretty cool. It was like what you’d see flying over towns or cities in a plane at night, but we were just sitting looking at it. I didn’t know what towns we were seeing. Prometheus and I chatted for a while and stayed outside and finally went into our tents to sleep. 
Song of the day: I’ve been listening to my soundtracks playlist and today it was the Jurassic Park soundtrack.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612295,"Well folks, I got norovirus. I guess it was only a matter of time. When I had my tummy pain the other day, I thought I had escaped it. Nope! I woke up at 2am and threw up outside my tent. There was no way I’d make it any further from my tent. I find throwing up to be really painful and I was slightly moaning because it hurt. Prometheus woke up and came over into my tent. He truly is such an angel. He ripped off toilet paper for me to wipe my mouth and he rubbed my back and sat with me. I got sick a few more times and then stopped and he went back to his tent.
The fun part of norovirus is that you have it coming out of both ends. Really fun with no toilet accessible. I walked out of my tent for number two and literally sat in the grass because there was nowhere else to go. I made it back into my tent and passed out for a little bit, but woke up throwing up again. My tent door was open all night. I know it’s all gross, but again, reality of the trail here folks. Prometheus came back and this time he brought his sleeping bag and stayed a while. He held my hair as I threw up. #friendshipgoals. He’s the best. 
He went back to his tent again and I passed out again. I woke up after the sunrise happened, but it was starting to rain, so I guess I didn’t miss much. I felt horrible. My body felt drained and my stomach felt like period cramps x 10. I lay there for a while, debating my options. I threw up again and this time it was extra painful because there was really nothing left to come up so it was green and it felt like my body was trying to throw up my whole throat. I’m sorry, I know. I kinda knew I had to get off trail now. Prometheus and Hot Sauce were worried and thought I might need to go to a doctor, but as money-stingy as I am, the doctor was the last place I was going. I felt okay after throwing up actually because it released more of the pain I guess, so I sat up and packed up. I got everything into my bag and Prometheus called a shuttle for me. 
Hot Sauce walked down with me. I was pretty slow and my hair was greasy and sticky and smelly from being sick and I probably looked like a situation, but I was looking forward to town. Thankfully there was a parking lot to walk down to. I sat my pack down and went to the bathroom in the grass nearby. My shuttle showed up, but we were waiting for Prometheus. He was packing my tent up for me. Again angel. He also cleaned up my vomit and honestly I don’t even know how to thank him for what he did. It’s beyond what anyone should have to do on this trail and he’s already got his own daily things to worry about. There was a couple in the parking lot and they gave me two Nuun tablets for electrolytes. I put one in the half bottle of water I had left. They gave me a banana too. It was too soon to eat, but I held onto it. 
Prometheus showed up with my tent all neatly wrapped. I thanked him and Hot Sauce profusely. I seriously would’ve been in trouble without their help. And I was fretting about money too. I knew going off trail would cost me. But I knew it would help me too. I got in the shuttle and the driver was nice. He mumbled the whole time and I could barely hear him. It was a bumpy road and I did not like that, but my tummy was okay. He drove incredibly slowly and I was getting frustrated and anxious because I just wanted to be in town. Once we were on the main road, there was a whole line of cars behind us. He was really going slowly. He seemed uncomfortable with the driving and kept remarking on how he had only been up here a few times in his life. He was a bit interesting and asked for my Facebook. I literally was dying in the backseat and this guy wants to be my Facebook friend. Lol okay?! He told me I looked like a ghost. Thank you, Captain Obvious. 
Finally I got to town. He dropped me off at the Laughing Heart Hostel. I know I looked like a situation, as I said earlier, but they knew it here for sure. The owner met me and said “are you sick?” And I said yes I was sick and just needed to sleep and she gave me a private room. She gave me a discount because I was sick. Another angel today. I lay in that bed for so long and slept. I tried to slowly sip the water, but really didn’t want to throw up again. My temperature was all off. Ever since last night, it was up and down. I had the chills and then fever and then chills and then fever and it was just annoying. I woke up in the afternoon and ate the banana. It went down without a problem! Ahh. I fell asleep again. I woke up late at night overheated and dehydrated. I went to the kitchen and found ice and I put it in a towel and some in a mug of water. The cold water tasted so amazing. I put the ice all over my body and turned the AC on in my room. I was cooling down and that helped. I ate some more crackers and finished that water with the tablet in it. 
What a day. I’m happy I’m in a safe place with a bed and shower and water, but it was rough getting sick on the mountain like that and I had a hard night. Thank you to all those supporting me back home. Hoping this ordeal is done soon and I’ll become immune for a little bit, or so I’ve heard.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612329,"Today I took another zero. I needed to fully let my body get the virus out and get some food in me so I could get back on trail. I was feeling pretty weak and didn’t want to move, so I sat in bed for a while. I finally got up to talk to the owner. I probably should’ve talked to her sooner, because she was all booked up when I saw her. Sometimes these hostel owners aren’t fully organized though, and she was just writing names in a little notebook.  She told me I could sleep on the couch in the bunkhouse and I was fine with that. Anywhere would work to help me lie down and recover. I booked a room with her for tomorrow night while I had the chance, as I wanted to stay one more night and possibly slackpack.
I moved my stuff into the bunkhouse and set up the sheet and comforter on the couch. She was nice and let me keep the comforter and sheets from the bed I had slept in last night. There were other hikers in the bunkhouse with me. Most of them were taking zeros. I remember Tex and Brother Bear. There was a guy from England as well, but I can’t remember his name. The hostel owner’s name is Tigger and her husband is Chuck. They named their dog Chigger. 
Brother Bear put in a movie. I was not super excited about it because it was “127 Hours”, that movie about that guy that cuts his own arm off after getting it stuck while hiking in Blue John Canyon. I’m normally grossed out by that kind of thing, but I did start to watch more “doctor” TV shows before I left, so I got more exposure to that kind of “surgery gore”. I had actually read about this guy before. It’s kinda random, but the story about him is in one of the books I read with the kids I teach. Every time we read the story and had to discuss our pictures, I wanted to vomit. It’s pretty graphic. I tried to skip that story when possible, but the boy students always chose it lol. 
The movie was actually really good. I liked it quite a bit. I watched the whole thing, even the arm-cutting scene. It’s inspiring to see how he tried to get himself out of the situation, even though he made some stupid mistakes by not telling anyone where he went. The trail is completely different, but it did make me feel scared of situations I could get myself into without help. It made me feel lazy just sitting there watching the movie, but I knew that was ridiculous because I just had noro. Someone brought us trail magic because they were picking up someone from the hostel, so they came in with candy and Gatorade. I couldn’t handle the candy, but I held onto it. I was pumped for Gatorade, but then I saw that it was lime-cucumber flavored. Yuck! Hot Sauce later told me that’s her favorite haha, to each their own! I’ll stick to the blue or red flavors! It was very nice of them to bring it; I’m just picky. 
After the movie ended, I finally got up off the couch and decided to walk to town. I had not had nearly enough water or food today. I was just so afraid of eating because I didn’t want to throw up and be in that awful pain again. I put all my stuff on the couch to claim it as mine, and left the hostel. I brought one bottle of water with the other Nuun tablet in it. I walked down to this smoothie place and got a berry smoothie. It was delicious, but my tummy was having a tough time. I saw Tinder and Wobbles! I still smelled like sickness because I hadn’t showered or done laundry yet, but I was so happy to see them! Wobbles got sick on Max Patch too!! Twins lol. He actually walked the same day he got sick and said it was the hardest 6 miles of his trail experience, even though the 6 after Max Patch are pretty easy. He got off at Lemon Gap and came into town. I’m glad I didn’t try hiking that first day. I would’ve been in the same boat and I was so miserable even walking to the parking lot.
Zahzu showed up too! It was good to see him. I haven’t seen him in a long time. He’s been partying it up on the weekends with his old soccer buddies, but hiking 20-mile days during the week to make it all possible. He told me he thought I had lost a lot of weight and I was thinking “yeah I probably dropped 10 just from the noro” haha. 
I walked to the Dollar General next. It’s actually so cheap there and I didn’t realize because I’ve never been to one before this trip. I got ice cream and pasta stuff for tomorrow night, my last night here. I got crackers, Gatorade, ginger ale, and rice as well. There were a bunch of other hikers there buying the usual hiker meals: ramen, peanut butter, knorr sides. The store had WiFi, which was also nice because I had no service in the entire town of Hot Springs. Also I don’t think I mentioned this, but I switched to Verizon just for the trail. I’m doing a personal unlimited plan and it’s pricey, so I’ll switch back to my family’s plan after, but it’s the best provider on the trail. Even so, it had no service in Hot Springs. I also don’t have service at shelters pretty often, and that’s annoying because I want to blog and update people when I’m done hiking for the day. Overall I’ve been pretty pleased with the switch, but it has its disappointments. 
The hostel was a bit of a walk with my full bags of groceries. I was also still carrying my smoothie and my water. The path was grass on the other side of the guardrail from the main road. I got back and put my groceries away on my couch. My ice cream was melting so I put that away. I went to cook my rice for dinner. I didn’t realize there was no real stove, but rather a hot plate. There was no simmer, so I wasn’t sure how I’d make my rice, but I went for it anyway. There was a pasta dinner in town tonight, but I didn’t think I could handle pasta just yet. Rice was a suggested meal for post-noro when I searched online, so it seemed like a good plan. 
Hot Sauce and Prometheus were there as I finished making my rice! They had been in town all day doing miscellaneous things. They actually pulled off a crazy day and hiked the entire 20 or so miles from Max Patch on the same day I got my ride into town. They left at 11am after helping me get to the car and finished hiking in the dark. Today they were taking a full zero to recover. They were setting out their food on the picnic tables outside to plan their meals, so I joined them with my rice and ginger ale. I actually drank a lot of ginger ale. It was good! Ginger ale was always the post-stomach bug drink growing up. I don’t tend to drink a lot of soda, but this hit the spot. I actually have had so much soda on trail and it’s interesting to me. I almost crave it more than alcohol. It’s just refreshing. I know it doesn’t hydrate like water does and it’s really just sugar, but there’s something about an ice cold Pepsi that just hits the spot. Ginger ale was hitting the spot today. 
I was slowly going through my rice. It was a process to get it all down. Prometheus and Hot Sauce did laundry and Prometheus put on the loaner clothes they give you at the hostel. He’s such a goon. He put on fuzzy pj pants that said “love” in different colors and then really switched it up and wore a dress. We were cracking up. He and Hot Sauce decided to tent on the grounds, which you can do for a fee, but they paid for laundry and showers so Tigger let them tent for free. 
There were some people hanging out inside and I chatted with them for a while because I was chilly outside. There was a mom and her daughter just here for the weekend. They didn’t have trail names, although the daughter wanted to be called pineapple. She was very talkative and wanted to show me many photos on her phone of random things. I went along with it because she was sweet and funny and I knew her mom needed a little break too. Her mom thanked me for talking to her daughter all night. I also chatted with a man who lives out of his truck because he has a tent attached to the top, and he’s been going from hiker fest to hiker fest. He was headed to Roan Mountain the day after tomorrow. That town is two town stops from here for me. We were chatting about how I came from Max Patch because I was looking up shuttles and deciding who to call. 
After a while, he nicely offered to drive me there. He said that he had always wanted to see Max Patch and was hoping to see it before he left town, so he’d gladly take me for $20. I was overjoyed. My shuttle into town was $60, and with the cost of the hostel too, I was getting annoyed about money. What a wonderful offer he made! We arranged it all and planned to leave at 9. I decided I really was going to slackpack the whole distance from Max Patch down. I certainly wasn’t healed, but I was feeling good enough to do it and I didn’t want to skip the section. I had also taken two zeros and didn’t know how many more I could do before mentally getting too far off trail and financially going overboard. I did meet another woman in the hostel who also came down from Max Patch due to ankle pain and she never went back to make up the mileage. Hike your own hike, but that would bother me! And I wouldn’t want to make it up at the end of the entire hike. 
I headed in to sleep on the couch. It was comfortable actually and I had a good rest. My point about the disorganization of the hostel owners was proven though, as there was an empty bunk all night and I was on the couch. I didn’t mind because I paid less and it was fine, but I was a bit annoyed that a bunk was available after all. I felt wiped even though I didn’t do much today. My body is still just recovering and I haven’t eaten anything but rice, crackers, a banana, and ginger ale for two days. Norovirus totally sucks. I can’t wait to shake this and finally feel healthy and strong again.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612640,"Alarms started going off pretty early! That hiker timing! I tried my best to sleep through them because I stayed up pretty late and I was tired. I woke up at 8. I felt tired, as I do every day on trail or off, but I got moving. I asked Tigger if I could put my stuff in the room I was moving into and I did that. I used my big pack, but put the Gatorade in one pocket and my Smart Water bottle in the other, with the sawyer filter on top of the bottle. This would allow me to get water quickly and just drink it from the filter. I put some crackers and simple chocolate chip granola bars in the main body of the pack, along with sunscreen, my wallet, and TP. I didn’t have much for breakfast. Hot Sauce made eggs and toast and I had a piece of her toast, which was probably a good idea because it wouldn’t mess with my tummy too much. My pack felt so nice and light. Ahh there’s nothing like slackpacking and dropping 30 pounds of weight for a day. It’s awesome. 
We drove up to Max Patch and he was a much faster driver, thank goodness. It was a nice drive, now that my head was up and I was mostly human again, looking out the window. We passed a lot of abandoned cabins and talked about what it would take to fix one up and have a beautiful cabin in the woods. We talked about his hiking experience too. He thru-hiked the AT and the PCT, but didn’t finish the CDT. Almost a triple crowner. Someday he says! There’s no way I’d ever do all three. I’ve never wanted to do the other two, always just the AT. I don’t know if I mentioned this, but someone did all three in a year. Yeah no. 
We got up to Max Patch again and parked. Tbt haha it brought back all the memories of walking down in zombie mode to the shuttle. We had to walk back up to connect with the AT. I really did not want to summit again because it just was too soon. I was just done with Max Patch. I wanted to move on from it and officially get to Hot Springs. I went into that town twice by car and still hadn’t walked into it. I will definitely come back to Max Patch someday. It was beautiful. All of the “bald” mountains are really beautiful actually. They have grass at the top like a field and no tree cover, so it feels like standing on top of the world. The hills are alive! I was not singing the sound of music today though. I bid farewell to my new friend and walked down the AT. 
The first 6 miles really were easy. The terrain was flat or downhill the whole time. I raced through it and it felt so good. I passed a bunch of day hikers. It was a beautiful day so it makes sense that they were out hiking. One commented on my pack size and thought I was hiking the whole AT with that. I laughed and joked with her, crying inside that my pack is so much heavier normally. Little does she know how annoying it is. I got to Lemon Gap, where Wobbles got off. And of course, with every Gap, there’s a freaking climb right after it, so I stopped for a snack. I had a granola bar and some water, and started the climb up. 
It wasn’t too bad. It was a hot day and I am not a fan of uphills, but it was okay. I met a man on the way up and was deeply saddened by his story. He’s “Luke Walker” because he’s terminally ill with Leukemia. His goal is to hike as many months as his body will allow him. It was so sad. People like him inspire me every day. I can’t imagine doing this if I were terminally ill with Leukemia. Such strength and courage. He has a blog if anyone wants to follow his journey: mountainsthatremain.com. 
I made it up the first mountain, ending in a nice grassy field on top. I then came across a shelter. I was tempted to stop and take a breather, but I felt okay and kept going. It went downhill for a little bit and then climbed again. This climb was much worse. It was just long. I met a man halfway up who was also headed to Hot Springs today, but with a full pack. He was eating a poptart on a rock. I got to the top and there was no view. Love that lol. I think this was Bluff Mountain. There was a big rock at the top so I sat on it and ate another snack. I was very good about hydrating with both the Gatorade and the water. It’s so much easier with a light pack that I can just swing to the side. I filled up my water a few times as well. 
After Bluff Mountain it was pretty much downhill the whole way. I was starting to get tired. But I was also running on adrenaline because I was finally going to make it to Hot Springs. For real! I passed 25-mile. Haven’t seen her in a while. I just found out her name is because she wants to do 25-mile days, but she hasn’t actually done any yet. I took a picture for her of a pretty view and stopped for a bit. She was also headed to Hot Springs. I went ahead and passed a couple sitting under some big rocks. I passed a few groups of day hikers, but it was mostly quiet for the whole way down. 
There was one more Gap with cars parked and it said I had 6 or so miles left. Of course there was some climbing after that, but it was a long stretch of downhill. The pounding on my legs and feet was starting to get to me. I could see Hot Springs for a long time and it was just switchback after switchback leading down into the town. I was trying to picture the spots Hot Sauce and Prometheus has talked to me about like abandoned roads or stealth camps they had thought about. I passed the last shelter before Hot Springs and climbed a few more times. There was a gravesite near the shelter. I’m always so interested and saddened when I see memorials or graves on the trail. Some are for trail founders, others for people that died in plane accidents in the mountains, others for people who loved hiking here, others with no explanation. 
I finally started to make the final descent and boom, I was here!! AHH. The trail passes right by my hostel actually, which I didn’t realize before. I had to officially walk down into town on the trail though to make it all real. So I walked past my hostel and down to the main road. I asked someone to take my picture and hobbled around, almost 20 miles done for the day, noro still working it’s way out of me, and Hot Springs finally under my belt. I took a video to celebrate my arrival and it turned out to be in slow motion. How fitting of my experience getting to Hot Springs haha. I walked to the Dollar General to get WiFi so I could tell the world that I made it!! For real!! 
I ran into Nemo! I think I’ve mentioned him, but I can’t remember. He’s very entertaining and ridiculously fast. His pack is 9 pounds, base weight. I don’t even know. Okay dude, you do you! He’s already thru-hiked once and just keeps coming back, seeing where the trail takes him. He’s actually from Fairfield County, which is the funny part. We made this connection. He hates it though and totally rejects the culture there. Understandable. It had its ups, but the competitive and judgmental environment of the area we grew up in was tough for me. Anyway, I had met him before, but it was nice seeing him again here. 
As we were talking, a big school bus showed up and honked. A bearded guy waved and the bus said hikeryearbook.com. This guy, Otie I believe, makes a yearbook every year with a picture of you (looking good like a normal human) and a picture of you finishing the trail. You send in your photos and then can order the yearbook. I will have to do that! I didn’t know how this whole bearded-dude-in-a-school-bus thing worked, so I asked where he was going and if it was free (lol me and my money woes). He said he was going up to the hostel and that yes it was free. I was pumped! I did not want to walk anymore at all and I had officially made it through town, so I got on. The bus had long benches with cushions and sheets over them. It was actually pretty cool. We arrived! There was a chili cookout at my hostel, which I did not even know about. I was not feeling up for chili today especially, but I also just hate chili. I’m sorry I really do. It’s like a brown pile of mush and chunks. I hate chunks. I’m this way about most sauces and salsas actually. I usually just dip in salsa, but don’t scoop. And I prefer sauces that are puréed. I’ve gotten better about it. I make lasagna sometimes and I like making my own sauce from scratch, with chunks of meat and tomato and carrots. I’ve come a long way. I used to not eat pasta sauce at all; it was always pasta butter! But yeah, no chili. I don’t do chunks, beans, or brown mush. To each their own. They did have mac and cheese, but I’m picky about that too! There are some mac and cheeses that are just bad. It has to be the right cheeses and there has to be a crispy layer of broiled cheese and bread crumbs on top. It was probably too soon for that much dairy anyway, but I was starved. I put some in a bowl and went right for a coke, yay sugar! My stomach was not happy. After my first bite of mac and cheese I could feel my tummy lurching. I threw the rest out. I was truly hobbling everywhere. People were noticing and saying “you’ve got the hiker hobble going!” I sure did. It was like walking on knives. My feet were screaming. Pack or no pack, this was my longest mileage day so far! 
I headed inside, went to my private room, lay down on my bed, put my feet up on the folded comforter that was on the end of the bed, and processed the day. The hostel didn’t have great WiFi and I already had no service, so it took 20 minutes, but I posted an Instagram to share with the world how good I was feeling for making it to Hot Springs. Prometheus and Hot Sauce had left this morning after helping me get ready to go. Prometheus had also helped set up the tents for trailfest downtown. He’s always so helpful! I didn’t experience much of trailfest, unfortunately. I was sick or hiking, but I heard they had some nice bands and I did experience the chili dinner. There was music at the hostel all night actually, but I listened from inside. I was so pumped to make my pasta. 
I made spaghetti with sauce and that powdered fake Parmesan cheese. Boy was that a throwback to childhood. Wish I had fresh cheese, but Dollar General doesn’t exactly sell that. I couldn’t finish my pasta, so I left the rest in the pot with a note saying “up for grabs”. I knew people were probably full of chili, but I figured I’d leave it as an option. A lot of people were walking in and out anyway because they were up here to see the band, so they did stop and have some. I finally took a shower, did my dishes and went to bed. I was so tired. I stayed up til 10 or so and passed out. 
So glad I made it for real today and can finally leave Hot Springs. But I also pushed myself hard today while still recovering so I’m quite tired too. Onwards and upwards!

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612641,"Time to leave Hot Springs! Finally! Except chores. Ugh. I needed to do laundry. My clothes smelled like a combo of vomit and sweat. Really pleasant, I know. I got up around 8, so I was behind some others in line for the machine, but eventually put a load in and waited for it. I cleaned my stove, my utensils, my water bottles and my hydration tube. I packed my bag, but needed to unpack it again because I realized I had a package to go pick up from the Inn I stayed at with my parents. I had left some of the food they brought me since I knew I’d pass through the town again. I walked all the way across town, but left my pack at the hostel. The Inn was closed all weekend for a wedding, but it was Sunday, so I was thinking the wedding had already happened. I walked up the driveway cautiously, thinking I’d photobomb these poor people trying to have a romantic wedding, standing there in my grody camp slippers and stinky clothes. Luckily there was no one there. The wedding was definitely over. I walked to the side of the Inn and knocked, and saw the wonderful Innkeeper from last weekend. I came in and told her what happened to me and grabbed the box. She was very sweet and if I had to come back to Hot Springs, I’d definitely stay here again. 
I walked all the way back to my hostel and put the food in my food bag, and then repacked everything. It looked like it was going to rain and I talked with Chuck a bit, but it ended up staying sunny. I said goodbye to Chuck and Tigger and left! I walked through town with a skip in my step, so happy to be moving on. 
Now with towns, the fun part is that you descend forever and ever down into the town, and then you climb forever and ever back up. So today was a climbing day. Joy joy! Love having a pack full of food and climbing out of town! Ugh. It was very nice right by the water though. The trail goes down into this beach area with sand and dirt, along the water. There were tent sites and people sitting there as I walked by. That would’ve been a great place to stay! Then I climbed up Lover’s Leap, looking down at the water as I went. The climb hurt. I felt bleh. I got through a lot of it and just sat on a log, feeling poopy.
I saw a salamander, which made me excited. I’ve seen so many on trail! I had never seen one before, but I remember this children’s book about a boy finding them in the woods. They’re cool little guys. I was texting Prometheus about plans. He had purchased a new pack in Hot Springs because his was heavy, just like mine. His new pack is around 2 pounds without weight, so it’s 2 pounds lighter. He said he didn’t have a chance to adjust to the pack and get situated, so he and Hot Sauce did a short mileage day. It would allow me to catch up and he was encouraging me all day to make it to them. I had gotten a late start, but was looking forward to pushing on to the shelter they were at.
I got up and kept going. I passed a man who said there was a little pond up ahead. I felt tired by the time I got there, but it was very beautiful. It was a little pond that flowed into a waterfall, with woods all around and a bench to sit. It was peaceful and serene and I sat down. I texted Prometheus and was feeling a little slow and tired. He said I had 6 miles left to the shelter, so I pushed on. I came to a dirt road. I was very confused for a second because there was a white blaze on a tree, but no trail. It was completely overgrown. So I followed my instinct and went up the road. Thankfully I was right. It connected back to a path and then down to a Gap. There was a bridge that crossed a highway and then a parking lot. And then more climbing because Gap. 
I climbed for a while. I knew there was a firetower at the end of the climb, and I had seen it from the Gap. I wanted to get to it. I passed one guy who had left Hot Springs at the same time and was also feeling wiped. I had seen him before but forgot his name. The trail split with another trail at one point and the white blazes were faded, and I remembered AWOL saying something about an “old AT”, so I was worried and stopped on a rock to check. I asked Prometheus if I had gone the right way and I passed some folks who told me the firetower was .4 away. I made it up and dropped my pack. The tower was off trail, but those views! I was even considering sleeping up there because Hot Sauce and Prometheus had done that! 
I walked up and found Unicorn and NAB. I haven’t seen them in a while. Unicorn was surprised to see me because I was ahead of them before, but I explained what happened and we chatted about noro; she got it too. NAB did not, but he was feeling queasy. That was kind of enough for me to know I didn’t want to stay up there. It was getting late though. Prometheus said I could stay in his spacey two-person tent so I wouldn’t have to bother with a tent setup so late. I wanted to see them, so I passed on the firetower stay and walked down. There will be more opportunities I’m sure. 
On the way down, I ran into a girl who had had a very rough experience. For her sake, I’m going to name her X when I talk about her story. She came up to me and asked if I was staying here. I said that I was moving on to the shelter, but that she was welcome to walk with me the couple of miles or so. She said she couldn’t keep going and that today was the worst day on trail for her. She was sexually harassed last night and I was disgusted by the behavior she described. She burst out sobbing to me and I rubbed her back while she talked. These boys got super drunk and high and sat outside her tent, saying nasty things to her and grabbing her from the outside of her tent. They were so aggressive her ear was bleeding from an earring that fell out, which is technically abuse. One of the guys said “I wanna fuck you. But you have to shave first. I’ll buy you all the stuff to shave and then I’ll fuck you”. It literally makes me sick to my stomach just writing this. No one should ever have to go through that, but especially not on trail. We experience so much shit out here and we do not need to be harassed in addition. As a single girl out here, I felt horrified. We hugged and I held her and knew that we needed to hold each other and have this moment. We needed to be there for each other and all single girls out on the trail. She was blaming herself and saying she was too friendly. We’re all “too friendly” out here. We become best friends in a day and we form connections super fast. It doesn’t mean you deserve to be harassed and grabbed all night. She looked like she had experienced hell. She didn’t want to tell her parents because she was afraid they’d take her off trail. I was so angry for her and wanted to take my hiking poles and shove them where the sun don’t shine on those asshole men. We said we need to stick together as women, I told her I was here if she needed anything, I directed her to Unicorn, who I knew would comfort her too, and I carried on. 
I felt so unsafe the whole walk. It was getting dark and I was scared and angry. I was ready to charge like a bull. What I just heard about was not okay. For her privacy though, I ask that this remains here in my blog. She is doing okay now and the assholes are still assholes (I saw them and will update). I simply want to tell this story because it deeply affected my night and my feelings of safety on the trail. Part of the last few miles was downhill, but most of it was up. I was anxious. I got most of the way there and checked my phone. It said I had a half mile left. I powered through and arrived at the shelter. I was so happy to see Prometheus’ tent. I said hello and he and Hot Sauce came out. 
They came and sat with me as I ate dinner. Prometheus had water ready for me because he’s awesome. It was dark by the time I hung my food and changed and did all that, but I was so happy to be with friends. I was a bit overheated in the tent and didn’t sleep well, but it is a nice tent and I was thankful I didn’t have to set mine up at that hour. 
Happy to be out of Hot Springs and moving on, but disturbed by today too and processing it all.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612643,"More uphill! These long uphills days can be so exhausting. Prometheus woke up early. I hadn’t slept well and we had stayed up late talking so we were tired. I felt like I could be in better shape if I went back to sleep for a bit, but Prometheus and Hot Sauce were ready to go. They kind of had an ambitious plan for getting to the next town, Erwin, TN. They wanted to make it there in four days. It was about 70 miles. This mileage plan was stressing them both out and causing some tension for all of us. 
At this point our mileage should be in the low teens, but sometimes the terrain is pretty rough and that’s hard to do. Hot Sauce and Prometheus would need to do mid teens or 20s to make their goal. Today was just a hard day. And we were running on little sleep too. We had breakfast and packed things up. Mama Squirrel was there. Haven’t seen her in a bit! She’s so great! It was very chilly this morning and the wind was strong. I had my gloves on when we left. A mouse had chewed a hole in Hot Sauce’s snack pocket while she was in the shelter. 
We hiked together all morning, arriving at a road crossing with a little country store about four miles in. There was really nothing in the store, but they had cold soda and chips, which sounded delicious. I downed a cold Yoohoo, throwback to childhood! And then I had a coke and Doritos. Prometheus and Hot Sauce were hoping to resupply because their mileage and food plan was changing, but there was nothing to resupply with. It was kind of just a shack with a couple refrigerators and snack boxes and random furniture everywhere. The owner was very nice though and his mom ran this store for a long time before him. She even met Grandma Gatewood, which is so cool! It was a nice little stop. Mama Squirrel found us all. An Australian man named Dundee came in too. 
I was still feeling meh, but I was happy to have some snacks. We headed out and started climbing again. The soda and Doritos were not settling well and I started to get really nauseous. We all stopped and I took off some layers and had some water. I put sunscreen on too. It took a little bit for me to feel better, but I did, and then we continued on. We split up a bit for the uphill. Prometheus went first and Hot Sauce was a bit in front of me. I stopped for water a couple of times. We ended up at the first shelter of the day.
It had been a long day of climbing in the heat. We were all pretty wiped, but Prometheus and I were especially tired. We agreed to stay an hour there and have lunch and then carry on, but as I sat there, I knew I couldn’t keep going. There was more uphill to come and my body and mind were just done. I told Hot Sauce and Prometheus that I was going to stay and that they were welcome to go on. I know I had just caught up to them, but I had to listen to my needs today. Hot Sauce was determined to keep going another 7 miles. Prometheus felt torn and said he felt like he was playing “monkey in the middle”. I didn’t want him to feel that way at all. I’ve always made it clear that we’re all hiking our own hike and I will split off or join as I go. I was fully prepared to try to catch up another day and I was trying not to put any pressure on them to stay. 
They decided to carry on. I was sad at first when I realized I had lost them again, but I was happy with my decision to stay. Mama Squirrel showed up and we chatted for a while and had dinner. She had a huge food bag and offered me some food. I personally had enough to get through, but I knew Prometheus and Hot Sauce didn’t, so I was collecting some to try and help them. X showed up and I was so happy to see her. She’s truly a sweetheart. We have a lot in common and I enjoyed our bond as young single girls on the trail. She had dinner with us. There were several people that had arrived throughout the course of the afternoon. Some of them were literally coming from Hot Springs that day. That’s 20 miles, all uphill. They were all averaging 20-mile days. It kind of made me feel like crap. I will definitely get to that point, but I’m not ready for 20-mile days. I did one and I didn’t have any weight and it still totally wiped me. I was intimidated and a little annoyed by their mileage, but I had to remind myself that I pushed myself today and did the best I could. Every day is an accomplishment out here and even just putting on my shoes and pack and walking forward is something to be proud of. 
I was under the impression that the trail would not be as “up and down” constantly as it was in Georgia, but it is still up and down all the time. I knew there would be tough climbs, but I thought it would level out somehow. There are still a ton of Gaps and the trail doesn’t level out much. Up down up down up down haha it is somewhat annoying. Someone said the other day that the trail was created by a bunch of drunk red necks and sometimes that feels true. The trail sometimes shoots straight up, but sometimes goes all the way around a mountain and then up. It sometimes climbs for miles and then has no view. It borders North Carolina and Tennessee for what feels like forever. It is constantly changing. There are bypasses on some challenging mountains and ridiculously rocky ridges on others. Sometimes the white blazes lead nowhere. As much as I love this trail, sometimes it is comical to me how it is designed. 
I felt proud of climbing the amount I did today and chatted with the 20-milers. There was one couple and they did everything together, even at camp. They’d walk down to the privy and have a chat. I’m all for couple poop chats. Been there, done that. But if I were hiking with my boyfriend all day every day, I would want to poop alone. To each their own. There was one section hiker who went down to the bathroom 4 times and people were starting to wonder if he was sick. Who knows? 
We all went to bed. I wanted to stay up and blog and process through the frustrations of the day, but I knew I needed sleep and that was a factor in me stopping here anyway, so I fell asleep. I didn’t sleep very well, but got enough to prepare for tomorrow.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612644,"I woke up at 5am to one of the 20-milers leaving. I don’t even understand how you get to camp after 20 miles and then get up at 5am. My body is already screaming at me for getting up at 6:30 or 7. I fell back asleep and woke up for real around 7:30. I texted Prometheus. If he and Hot Sauce didn’t go too far today, I could catch them.  He took a while to respond to me. I sat and ate breakfast with Mama Squirrel and X. It was a nice bonding time. We were laughing about the climbs we’d have to do today, including one called Big Butt Mountain. Mama Squirrel shook her butt and sang. She’s so funny! She’s a preschool teacher back home and got her name from a little puppet squirrel she’d use for shy kids. She’s definitely got sass and youth in her though and it’s great to be around her. 
We all agreed we were headed to the shelter in 14 miles or so. Prometheus finally got back to me and said he was going to the one after that. I was not going to do a 20-mile day to catch him, so I just took my time and enjoyed the morning with Mama Squirrel and X. There were a few boys who came and ate with us. They had stealth-camped nearby, but ran out of water, so they couldn’t cook breakfast and had to walk to the shelter and water source so they could eat. They knew the boys that had harassed X, and apparently the boys said “they annoyed her”,  but left out all the details of touching her or sexually harassing her. Good to know their side of the story was going around. *eye roll* X seemed to feel open and calm about it now and told them exactly what happened. It was disgusting to hear again and the boys realized how bad it really was. We’re all on the lookout for the ones who did the harassing and are lying about it. Again, I’m not naming names here and I do not want to report this, as it is not my story to tell, it’s X’s. It just consumed me to worry about this kind of threat on the trail. 
We all headed out. I passed Mama Squirrel and we were both not enjoying the uphill. There was more! It was all morning and it was hot out. There were a lot of nice views though and I took my time to look at all of them. I wanted to enjoy myself and really take in the trail. That’s the point of this whole journey, not just pounding out 20-mile days to get to the next spot. I stopped at two cliffs, and the views were spectacular. There was a nice meadow view too, but that was far off trail. I shouldn’t have gone to that one. Too much time off trail and not worth the view. After looking at all of them, I found Mama Squirrel again. She was surprised I was behind her. I said I stopped at all the views and we hiked together for a bit. It had leveled out, but there was a pretty rocky ridge to get through still. I love Mama Squirrel, but she isn’t the fastest. Staying with her was nice, but I was losing time too. I’ve made this mistake in the past sometimes. I remember one cross country race in high school where I literally ran slowly the whole race to stay with a friend and I got a terrible time. When I actually ran for myself in later races, I did well. I’m not a fast runner at all, but I’m not bad when I push myself. I stayed with her through the whole ridge because I wanted to chat and knew she needed a buddy. It was quite rocky and sometimes treacherous. We reached the top of the mountain and the view was wonderful. Mama Squirrel took a video of us celebrating. We walked on and she fell. I helped her up and she said she was fine, but it looked like it hurt. She thanked me for staying with her and said she would’ve had a really rough time on the ridge without me. That made me feel better for slowing down to hike with her. We started to descend and were anticipating the 300-mile mark. It felt like forever, but we finally reached it! Someone had made a little 300 out of stones on the side of the trail. We took our packs off and took pictures of each other with the sign. I was so happy to reach another little milestone. The little accomplishments really feel good on the trail. 
I decided it was time to go ahead of Mama Squirrel, so I said I’d see her in a bit. It was mostly downhill or flat, but it had some uphill too for the next portion until a shelter. This was the shelter Prometheus and Hot Sauce stayed at last night. I desperately needed water. There was none on the ridge, and Prometheus had warned me, but I still drank all my water because the climbing was rough and I was thirsty. I filled up and saw X and the boys from this morning! We were all heading on for a little bit. 
We started to climb and it was leading to Big Butt Mountain. I had not eaten enough food, as my stomach was still not back to normal. But I was running on adrenaline. I got up to the top of the mountain before I knew it and the boys were taking pictures with the Big Butt Bypass sign. There were so many jokes to be had. “Why would you bypass the big butt?” “I mounted the big butt”. “What a pain in the butt”. I apologize for being crass, but it was kind of funny. Who decided to name this mountain? I have questions. Apparently there is a “swinging dick gap” on the trail. Sadly I missed that. Haha. Drunk red necks, I tell ya. The boys were wondering if we had to summit the other “cheek”. I was cracking up. They took my picture. I guess I missed them mooning for their pictures. I did not want to moon for mine, although I do have somewhat of a big butt. I’m not THAT comfortable with strangers out here lol. 
There was a rocky summit to the Big Butt, which I guess explains the bypass trail. After the summit, there was a grassy field (maybe cheek number two? Unclear). The boys decided to camp there for the night. I decided to keep going. It was getting dark and I really hate hiking as it gets dark, but I wanted to get to the shelter and I wanted to see Prometheus. He had ended up staying at the next shelter and texted me about it. It was mostly downhill, with some little ups. I passed a mass grave site, but didn’t want to venture over there. It was taking a while to descend, but I finally made it to the gap right before the shelter. I checked on my phone to make sure and I headed on. I found someone along the way and he said, “you made it! The shelter’s right down there!” I was so pumped. I arrived and X was there and Prometheus! It was so great to see him. 
There was another man, Rev, who I’m quite fond of. He reminds me a lot of my old boyfriend’s dad, one of the sweetest men in the world. He has a smile that just makes you feel safe and warm and loved. Rev is like that fatherly figure and he is taking his time and going the same pace as me. Rev, X, Prometheus, and the section hiker, Whistles (or sock monkey man?! idk), and I sat around the fire (Prometheus made it, shock). I made dinner, but couldn’t finish it, so Prometheus did. He’s been rationing his meals anyway so he was pretty hungry. I gave him the meals I had collected for him so he was set on food. I set up in the shelter next to him. 
Hot Sauce was not with us here. Prometheus had hurt his foot and that’s why he stopped here, but Hot Sauce did not want to stop for the day and continued on. There was some tension between them about planning and mileage, but I wasn’t really involved. I was happy to be with a familiar face, but I did worry about Hot Sauce and hoped she was okay wherever she was for the night. 
I got in my sleeping bag and saw a huge wolf spider on the wall. Prometheus killed it, thank goodness. That thing was freakishly big. I actually found one on myself the other day. I complained here about walking through webs. Well I walked through one with an actual wolf spider the other day and flicked that thing off myself so quickly. They’re so scary. Ugh. Mom, please come kill it! Prometheus and I shared headphones and listened to music for a bit. I stayed up too late yet again. It’s fun to have these times with him, but I do need to be disciplined about sleep too. Today was rough, but I felt good about the mileage and tough climbs of the day. I worried about Hot Sauce and Mama Squirrel. I was happy to be with X and Rev and Prometheus. I met another woman here who lost her big toe toenails early on in her trip and had to come off trail to let them heal. She started February 16. She had such strength to come back here after weeks off trail. That would be so hard for me. She also experienced some of the worst weather in March before I came on trail and all of those factors would’ve made it hard for me to come back. But she was lovely to talk to and her name was Guiding Light. She’s a special woman and that determination is admirable. Hopefully I get some sleep tonight!

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612645,"Today I got another pack shakedown! Prometheus should do these as a job lol he loves to give shakedowns. He emptied my toiletries and took a lot of random stuff out and then emptied my wallet. I’m a receipt hoarder because I worry about losing receipts and not being able to return things if needed. He threw them all in a trash bag and I sucked it up because I knew I probably didn’t need them anyway. It took a little while to complete the shakedown, but he removed a solid 2 pounds worth of weight and put it in a ziplock bag for me to send home later. We got packed up and headed out. It was later than he wanted and I knew that, but he also chose to give me a shakedown and that was his decision. 
We hiked down to a road and there was a hostel there. I had once thought of staying here and having a package sent here, but changed my mind when I talked to Hot Sauce and Prometheus about Erwin, TN. The hostel was pretty small, but it had some soda and frozen pizzas and a microwave. There was no one there, but there was a sign that said “if no one is here, we’ll be back soon”. We took a frozen pizza and heated it up and planned to keep a tab for when the owner got back. We each got a soda and an ice cream bar too. There was a doggie running around and we were both excited by her. A man drove in and said his wife was a hiker, so he grabbed a soda for her and left money in a little container on the table. The dog was going crazy at the car and a man walked over to settle the dog. I guess he was the owner. It was a little weird honestly. He was kinda “off”. I put money in the container, but kinda wanted to get out of there. We got our packs on and left to get back on the AT. I did weigh my pack because there was a scale there, and it was 38 pounds! Still heavy, but much better than before! Getting there!
As with any gap or road crossing, guess what we got to do?! A little louder for the people in the back. CLIMB! We climbed for a bit and arrived at a waterfall. It was really pretty. Prometheus spotted a good photo opportunity and went and climbed this ridiculous log suspended in front of the waterfall. He set up his camera for the shot and I took it for him. He took my picture too. I filled my water bottles here and we kept going. We finally got to the end of the up, but we still hadn’t gotten that far. We were both tired. Prometheus had gotten an email from Subaru saying they wanted to feature him in a magazine, but he didn’t have the picture and was upset. He was reaching out to people at home who might have it and we sat down in the middle of the trail to wait for it, as he only had until tonight to get the photo and he didn’t want to miss the opportunity. 
We saw some folks headed to the shelter for the night after a 16-mile day. We were about a mile from the shelter. We got up and started to discuss plans. It was getting stormy and we wanted to avoid the rain and get to town, but we were both tired and wanted to stay in the shelter. We thought it all out, but decided with pen and paper at the shelter we could really nail it down. We got there and it was actually a really nice setup. The privy was nice and there were a million tent spots. The only sucky thing was the water; it was two million miles away. That was truly the farthest water source I’ve ever been to. 
We sketched out the plan and decided to hike tomorrow to Spivey Gap and get off trail and out of the rain, and then slackpack the rest the next day. It was a good plan. We called the hostel to book a room and shuttle for tomorrow. We then walked down across the globe to the water source and washed our feet in the ice cold water and filtered our water. On the way back up, Prometheus tried to take a shortcut, but I still beat him. There was no shortcut to this ridiculously far source. 
We started to make dinner. I only had chicken teriyaki left. Ugh. The worst. Especially with my sensitive tummy, it was not happening. I ate maybe three bites and was chowing down on saltine crackers to get it all down. Prometheus finished it for me and admitted that he thought it was a bit heavy. He gave me one of his rice sides to have for dinner instead. I couldn’t simmer it, so I just let it boil a while, but it stuck to the inside of my stove pot. I ate most of it, but even rice was hard to get down. 
We were all setup in the shelter, but then I looked up and saw a mouse. I told everyone and they looked up too and sure enough, this little guy was running all over the log walls of the shelter. Prometheus wanted to kill it and we all were cool with that. Mice can ruin gear and they can also crawl on you while you sleep. I wasn’t letting a mouse chew my thousands of dollars worth of gear, and I didn’t want them crawling on me. There are stories of a woman who wore lip balm and a mouse eating her lips, and a woman who woke up with one in her stove, and another with one in her hair as she was having a dream about a haircut. And then of course the one that chewed Hot Sauce’s pocket. They’re unpleasant and I’m not a fan. I’ve seen some traps for them, but there weren’t any here. 
Prometheus found the nest inside the logs and was ready to go, but soon found the entire family of mice and they all scattered out of the nest. Yeah no. He couldn’t take out the whole fam, so it was the humans that ended up leaving. Stupid mice. Prometheus set up his tent and I helped move everything in there. I cleaned my stove and buried the rice leftovers. I got into the tent and actually managed to sleep well this time. We didn’t stay up talking, so I actually got a good sleep. Progress! And no mice! Looking forward to our town adventure tomorrow!

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612646,"Today started out uphill, of course. But then it went down to Sam’s Gap. There had been trail magic there yesterday and we were both upset that we missed it, but there was some stuff leftover. There was an empty cardboard container from soda cans and a water jug, and then a bag full of things like candy and ramen. We took some candy and topped off our waters. We walked out of the gap, which was actually a highway, and Prometheus got a call from his mom. He walked on so he could talk to her and I stayed behind to give him space. I put my headphones in and jammed out for a little bit. 
He got off the phone and it was his brother’s birthday, so he said he’d need to call back later to wish him a happy birthday. We walked together for a bit and chatted. He’s faster than me, so sometimes it’s hard to hear him, but we had a nice walk. My pack was bothering me a bit because the straps kept loosening. I started to grapple with the fact that I might need a new one. Mine is so heavy on its own and it does loosen like that as I go and it’s annoying. Unfortunately, my shoes are also an issue right now. I don’t like having both issues at the same time. I put Superfeet insoles in my boots, but now my pinky toes are being squished even more than normal and I’m getting blisters. It was annoying me today. 
We stopped for nice photos, but were trying to move quickly. We got out early today and that was awesome, but we still had a lot of miles to cover. The day was slowly climbing up to Big Bald Mountain. We had some pretty deep talks while walking up Big Bald and it helped the time go by. Timing is weird though and it was starting to rain. We put each other’s pack covers on and kept going. The top of Big Bald is actually awesome, but as we arrived, we watched as a rainstorm literally moved right over us. Great time to be on a Bald with no rain cover. Lol. We saw X too! We headed down the Bald quickly to get cover. We got wet, but it wasn’t too bad. It let up and we kept going. There were too more smaller climbs to do after that. We passed a shelter and then did those climbs. My feet were starting to kill me. I was whimpering on the downhills. Prometheus was hurting too. We passed up on the summit of the last uphill because we just wanted to get our shuttle and the rain clouds were circling us all afternoon anyway. 
We pounded downhill for a while to the Gap. We called from a mile away and the shuttle was there when we arrived. It was so exciting! The woman drove incredibly fast though and both of us were getting carsick on the winding turns. We arrived at Uncle Johnny’s. It’s a pretty cool place! I was so happy when we first arrived because there was a fence and a little doggie poked her head under the fence. Ahhh best surprise!! 10/10 would crawl under the fence to pet. We went inside and checked in. We put our stuff in our cabin and I was hobbling around because my toes hurt. Our cabin was quite small, but it worked for the night. I saw Red Wiggler and Wobbles, so that made me happy!! Two people from my old trail families. I miss them! I’m glad I’m just a few days behind them. 
We hurried back out to catch the shuttle that left for dinner. It would take us to Walmart and a few restaurants near Walmart. Prometheus and I were so pumped for Walmart. You never know how much you’ll miss Walmart until you’re on trail! Haha. Next to the Walmart there were a couple of restaurants. One was Italian and the other was Mexican. Prometheus and I had been craving Italian food, so we went there. We had met up with Heather back at the hostel. I don’t know her very well, but she had hiked with Hot Sauce and Prometheus before and met up with them the first time we were in Hot Springs when I was with my parents. Heather joined us for dinner and another man from Colorado, Yorkshire. 
Dinner was pretty crappy. Bad Italian food is just the worst. My garlic knots were good, but the pizza and pasta I got were so bad. The pasta sauce was runny and the cheese was just clumped on top and it was just gross. I was so happy to have food, but it did not live up to my expectations. I took it all to the hostel in boxes, but knew I probably wouldn’t finish it. Prometheus wanted to go to Walmart and we didn’t have much time before the shuttle came back, so I packed up his food for him and paid for it. He paid for the hostel so I owed him anyway. 
We saw Hot Sauce in the Walmart parking lot and went back to the hostel in the shuttle. The shuttle driver was funny and there were hikers from all directions coming to the van so she drove in a circle and the people were all chasing the van. One guy walked right up to the windshield when she stopped and it was so funny. Back at the hostel, I picked up my packages and Prometheus and I went to our room and organized things. We both showered and relaxed. I ate some of the garlic knots, but didn’t really touch the other food. Outside, I could hear some boys and they were talking about X. They were saying “does X hate us now?” And “she camped there, she asked for it, the story writes itself.” What assholes. I was so angry just listening to them. I was worried about X and didn’t want her to stay here and have to see her harassers. I told Prometheus and he was mad too. The guys were all drinking excessively outside and pretty rowdy. 
We went to sleep and our room was a little hot, but it cooled down outside as we slept. I was annoyed because my external battery wasn’t charging, but I knew we were staying two more nights, so I could try to charge it again. We also had ice cream before bed that we got at Walmart. The best treat!

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613962,"Slackpacking!! My fave! Today we were going to shuttle into Erwin and have breakfast with Hot Sauce and Heather, but we decided to just slackpack sooner instead. We packed things up and moved out of our room. I put all my stuff in a trash bag so I could just bring my pack, and put the trash bag in the main store of the hostel. Hot Sauce had Turkish Delight from home and shared some. I’ve never had it before, but it was delicious. Heather came with us because she had also come in from Spivey Gap before us yesterday. The lady driving us closed the trunk right on her pack belt and broke the buckle. I felt so bad for Heather. Packs are not cheap and having to replace things like that when you didn’t even make the mistake sucks. It’s an easy fix though and she can buy a new buckle. 



The woman drove very fast and we were a bit car sick again. We passed by a house with a skeleton riding a rooster. I have questions. We got to Spivey Gap and Prometheus headed out first. He said he was going to run the whole day. Heather then headed out and I grabbed some water from the gap and headed out. I had eaten ice cream and snacks for breakfast, so I didn’t have a lot of energy, but I was making good time without the weight. I hiked behind Heather for most of the way. My toe was hurting, so I was hobbling. I had taped it up that morning, but it was still hurting. Heather’s leg was bothering her too. We had both stopped a few times and stopping was always hard because we’d lose that momentum and speed when we started again.
We passed a few down trees that were hard to climb over. I always wanna yell “Parkour!” It really is like that sometimes. Someday someone will grab a chainsaw and clean it all up, hopefully! Other than that, the terrain wasn’t too bad. There was some up, but it was mostly flat or downhill. We got up to the top and saw a nice view of the river down below. We could also see the cars on the highway below. We could see Erwin for a while, but the downhill was long switchbacks that seemed to take a while. 


We finally got down to the road! Heather and I fist-pumped and celebrated. We walked right into the hostel. I got a Pepsi and we saw Hot Sauce. She said Prometheus was out back, so we headed back to see him. He had run the entire distance and was wiped. It was impressive how he ran it, but he was paying for it now. There was a passing shower and it poured and I was glad I missed that while hiking. We wanted to move to the Super 8 because the hostel room was small and hot. We found out they were shuttling a few people down there, so we joined. I grabbed my huge trash bag of stuff and unloaded some of it into my pack as I sat in the van. 


We arrived and waited a bit in line to get a room behind some other hikers. I paid for this to pay Prometheus back and we got a room with two beds for two nights. We set our stuff down and did laundry. We took showers and put the clean stuff on. We walked into town for dinner and decided to check out the chili cookoff. Another freaking chili thing. Lol not a fan! It was pretty far from the Super 8, but we walked there and took in the town. Prometheus tried the chilis and I just watched. We then left to get ice cream because there was a cool store nearby with homemade ice cream. I got vegan chocolate because it was the only chocolate they had left. It was not great. I also got a scoop of bourbon vanilla and that was good! We walked to Walgreens and Prometheus got a few things. I got a few snacks to eat tonight. We went to Bojangles after. I had never been there because they don’t have them up north. It was really good! The chicken I got was fresh out of the fryer and I got a huge Pepsi. 



The food was delicious, but didn’t sit well with either of us. We ran back to the hotel because it was raining, and when we got back we both just lay in our beds, a bit uncomfortable. Prometheus and I have had some drama. It’s personal so I’m not going to share it here, but tonight was tough. I think we could use some time apart.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613964,"Zero day! I remember back when I was so opposed to zeros, but now I’m a big fan of them. My toes were really hurting me, especially my pinkies. I had a callous on each pinky toe and it just hurt to walk on them. I cut the callouses off last night and aired my feet out with light socks. Today there was a festival in town. It was pretty awesome, even for a small town like Erwin. Prometheus and I were not saying much to each other. We had talked last night and I tried to address the issue then, but we just weren’t on the same page and no resolution could be found right now. He headed out before I did and I had breakfast at the hotel. They had bagels and donuts and a waffle iron, so there were some nice options. I walked over to town after. The same place where the chili cookoff had been now had pancakes. I had one, but was pretty full. 


I ran into Prometheus and Hot Sauce. One of the booths had these huge inflatable bags and we lay in them, which was fun. Hot Sauce got a white blaze painted on her arm and I later did too. We met up with Heather too. There was a masseuse there and Hot Sauce and Prometheus got massages. We all walked down through the tents and got some “tators”. I’ve never had tators before, but they were good! It’s basically french fries, but there are onions and other things in them. I got homemade ice cream from one of the booths, which was delicious. We all went to the Outfitter to do foot baths. They had Epsom salts and were offering hot foot baths. There were doctors there and they were super friendly, giving us some creams and bandaids to go. After that, Hot Sauce and Heather went to Taco Bell and Prometheus and I stayed at the Outfitter. Their selection was pretty limited. There were no big packs that I could try on just to see if I liked a lighter one. Prometheus bought a new headband and sticker. I love stickers and I regret not buying more of them on the trail so far. 


Prometheus and I headed to Taco Bell to meet up with Heather and Hot Sauce. I’ve never been to Taco Bell, and I didn’t get anything since I had the tators. I wanted to go back to get a white blaze painted on my arm and check out some of the other stands, so I left to go do that. I called my friend Rachel from home because I haven’t caught up with her in a while. That was so nice. I miss her so much. We’ve been friends since high school and she’s been my rock through all the ups and downs of growing up. I got my white blaze on my arm and bought a pizza for later from one of the vendors. They had a brick oven attached to their truck. Prometheus texted and said he had called a shuttle to Walmart, since we didn’t have enough time to shop there before. I headed back to the hotel and met him, and we caught the shuttle. 


We spent a long time in Walmart. I never need to resupply since I do mail drops, but sometimes I eat through my candy quickly or want something like Doritos, which are hard to pack out. I basically just wanted a few hotel snacks. I got a soda and some Little Debbies. I also got new inserts for my shoes. I had mentioned before that my Superfeet were not really working and that I was getting bad blisters from them, so I wanted to try something else. We got all our stuff and headed back to the hotel. Prometheus put on some TV and we hung out. He put on The Avengers. I’ve never seen any of the Marvel movies; it’s not really a trend I followed along with. I think I’ve seen Thor, but I don’t even know the connection of them all. I actually liked whatever was on TV and was hooked. Prometheus took a shower and made a phone call and I hung out and tried to blog. It was hard to focus and I was emotionally kind of having a hard time given the struggles I had had with him recently. I left the room and tried to blog in the hallway and process through it all and when I got back he was asleep. We had tried to talk again earlier, but again there was no resolution. 


I headed to bed and slept well. It was nice to have a zero day, even though I spent the whole day walking around and shopping. It was nice to veg out in front of the TV for a bit; it has been so long since I’ve watched anything!

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613965,"Prometheus woke up before me as usual. He gets restless without having something to do, so he was on the move. He packed up and headed out. We had agreed we weren’t going far today because it was raining and we were both still tired and sore from the past few days. He headed to Uncle Johnny’s to hang out and get going, and I waited til checkout. I got breakfast and took another shower, and packed up my stuff. Prometheus had cut my new inserts for me, so I tried those on and they felt great in my shoes. 


I chatted with a couple in the hotel lobby and two men named Nightingale and No Heart, and a church shuttle showed up. They said they’d be back soon, but I missed them by five minutes while trying to pack my stuff. They were so nice though and came back a third time to check for more hikers. There was a massive trail magic tent near Uncle Johnny’s, so they took me there. It was pouring rain and I put my rain gear on and my bag under the overhang. Water was still coming in under the tents, but it was dry enough. They had so much food. This trail magic was extensive and incredible. They had brownies, cupcakes, cakes, cookies, pies, hot dogs, burgers, mac and cheese, corn, coleslaw, brisket, and more. It was amazing!! Unfortunately I wasn’t very hungry. I was still upset about what happened with Prometheus and I was not feeling the rain and having to leave in it. 


I chatted with a few people. There was a man from Denmark named Camera Man, and his friend from Taiwan, Mountain Goat. Mama Squirrel was also there and 25-Mile. Hornet came by and said he was sleeping under the bridge to stay out of the rain, and this little kid looked up and said “why are you sleeping under the bridge?” And we just laughed because we always feel a bit funny as hikers, doing things we’d never do otherwise. There’s a guy named Wizard who was staying at the Super 8 with his mom (her new trail name is shots because she showed up to the hostel with little alcohol bottles for everyone) and he’s been pretty sick the past few days. He said he also slept under a bridge the other night, but classic boy just texted his mom “sleeping under a bridge tonight. I’m fine.” And meanwhile she’s like every other mom thinking “wait what?” I had a nice time talking to them all. Prometheus and Hot Sauce were there, but I was just taking my space. They headed out ahead of me to walk to that first shelter, as we had agreed. I was waiting for the rain to calm down a bit. It was supposed to by 2pm, and it definitely did calm. I only had 4 miles to walk anyway, but it was uphill, because leaving town! 



The first part of the trail was actually really nice. It was flat, which I love haha. We had to cross a train track and that was cool. I wanted to pull a “Stand by Me” and walk down the tracks, but the trail just crossed them. I made it to a river and saw two guys having a smoke. Their names were Smiley and Mama’s Boy. They were very friendly and Smiley had an entire baguette sticking out of his pack; a real mood. The sun was peeking out, but it was going to rain again at some point according to the forecast, so I kept my rain gear on and was sweating a ton.
After the nice flat, it was a nice big uphill. I was sweating so much and my pack felt so heavy; ahh the joys of leaving town. I made it to the shelter and saw everyone. Heather is now Denver because she took time off to go to Denver. She was there and Hot Sauce and Prometheus and a girl named Speedy Queen, who got her name because some drunk boys were trying to do their laundry and couldn’t figure out the machine, so she did it for them and was named after the brand of the washer. Unicorn and NAB were also there. Hot Sauce, Prometheus, and Denver were all on the top row with Unicorn and NAB. I really needed my space, but I also didn’t want to hike further today. I settled in on the lower floor next to Mama’s Boy. Smiley was chatting with me and helped me hang my bear line. I haven’t had to in weeks; I’ve been spoiled. There have been cables at almost every shelter! We found a great tree and I threw it and made it over, and then left it there until I was done with my food. Smiley was great moral support. I don’t hate bear bagging as much anymore, but I still don’t like it. 


I slowly ate my dinner, but again had no appetite. I buried the rest of my food because I just couldn’t finish it. You can dig a cathole in the woods for your food too, although it’s not recommended. I then went to hang my food bag. It was so heavy. Oh my goodness. It’s always full when I leave town, and I was excited about the goodies inside, but still. It was a pretty weak tree and I thought I was going to break it. I finally got the bag up though and I have to say, it was a pretty good hang. It was a thin tree and branch so a bear would have trouble climbing it, it was far from the trunk, and it was high off the ground too. Getting there folks!


I went to bed, but was feeling pretty poopy about the day. I was again wrapped up in drama now. I freaking hate drama. I definitely used to start some for sure when I was younger, but it was all I knew how to do. And when I think about how silly all that drama was, I wish I had never started it. But now I didn’t start it, I was just wrapped up in it. Will our group ever be in sync? Hot Sauce has issues with me, then Prometheus has issues with Hot Sauce, then I have issues with Prometheus. It’s like one of those math problems; how many combinations of people with issues with each other can exist in this group? It’s also like the Bermuda Triangle. And I want to sail away at this point.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613967,"Today was a late start. I told you all how this trail is so mental for me. Well it’s true. And it’s emotional. Prometheus and I got so close so quickly, and I was really hurting after what happened. I love him as my friend and love his presence in my trail life. He woke up early as usual and headed out. Hot Sauce was taking her time and I was chatting with Unicorn. I just needed to vent, so I told Unicorn what happened with Prometheus. I didn’t want to gossip at all, I just needed someone to talk to. Unicorn and NAB were headed to the shelter I was thinking about that was in 12 miles or so. Denver, Hot Sauce, and Prometheus were thinking about crazy miles. They wanted to go 19 miles or something like that. To each their own, hike your own hike, but I knew Prometheus was not interested in that mileage. He had told me they were pushing too hard and that he just wanted to slow down and enjoy his hike. But I needed to stay out of it all for the moment. 


A woman came up to the shelter while I was sulking. Her name was Rocky. She got that name because she fell and cracked her head open on a rock. She’s a freaking badass. She’s been through four marriages, and one of them was with an abusive husband who did horrible things to her and shot her (she still has pain in the spot where it happened) and she’s had cancer and had both breasts removed, and almost died from kidney failure. She’s literally amazing. She opened up to me about all of this and I was just blown away. My problems seemed trivial compared to what she went through. But despite that, I want to validate my problems too. At my age, everything hurts. I haven’t experienced enough to be able to brush it all off. I’m getting better at that for sure, but I still experience new pains that I don’t know how to deal with. I know it all makes me stronger and that someday I will be as wise and tough as Rocky. But right now I’m still young and vulnerable and keep getting hurt by things I don’t know how to deal with. It was wonderful to talk with her. Mama Squirrel came up too. I was so happy to be in the company of such tough, wise women who are out here doing what I’m doing, but at three times my age. Another woman who was younger, Snowflake, came up too with advice. I felt powerful with my fellow women around me, chatting about life. I have so much to learn, I know. And yet I was praised for my maturity by them too. Snowflake got a dog while on trail and trained it to walk with her, and the dog has been loyal and loving and active. It’s been the perfect companion. It made me think of getting a dog. I want one so badly. 


I finally left the shelter at a ridiculously late time. The terrain wasn’t too bad, but it did start to climb a lot. It was headed up to this spot called Beauty Spot. I stopped just before Beauty Spot to take a pack break. I sat in the grass and Rocky was stopped there. She was having a tough time because she had cut her head open and had stayed in the hospital, and then slackpacked to make up the miles, and this was her first day back on trail with full pack. I sat for so long. Today was just bleh. I finally got up and walked up to Beauty Spot. It was beautiful, as expected. It was sort of like Max Patch though; a big bald with a view. I met this guy sitting in the grass who said you could order pizza up here. We called the pizza place to confirm and they said no, so I guess it was a rumor on the Guthook app. The guy’s name was Pumpkin because he wears an orange rain coat. He’s adorable. He could see I was having a rough time and said “wanna be buddies?” We walked down to the next water source together and there was a campsite there. Pumpkin decided to set up camp, so I did too. I hadn’t walked very far at all, but whatever. I was so done. This trail is 85% mental for me and I just have to recognize when my mind isn’t there, even if my body is.


I set up my tent and got water and brought my food up to the campfire ring. It was chilly and I wanted a fire. Where was Prometheus when I needed him? I decided I could build my own fire and build my confidence back up a little bit. I got all the little sticks to start it and Mama Squirrel showed up. She was going to go farther, but she saw me and said “it’s one of my favorite kiddos!” She stayed and I was so happy. She gave me a bit of toilet paper to help with my fire and I started it up. It was slow to get going, but it worked. With any fire, you have to spend some time tending to it, and I was definitely doing that. When I make a fire at home, I obsess over it too. But it was worth it because I got a roaring fire going. Pumpkin left for a bit to go watch the sunset and take a time-lapse of that. Mama Squirrel and I chatted. There was a girl and her dad there, but they went to bed before us. Her name was John McCain and his was Chef Leroy. They were super chill. Chef helped me with my bear line. I threw it several times and missed every time, and he came over and threw it once and made it. Lol great. 


I was struggling to eat, shock. Pumpkin came down and helped me finish my mac and cheese. He is such a sweetheart. He’s one of the 20-miles a day people though. So I doubt I’ll see him again for a while. He’s pretty intense and was on the National Rowing Team and runs marathons and has his PhD. I could tell he wanted to go to bed because he seems pretty disciplined. He helped me pull my food bag up on my line, and then we went to bed. 


Today was rough. I thought about Prometheus all day and wondered where he was. I missed him so much and wished I could resolve everything that happened. For now, I needed the space, but it was really hard. I was so miserable. I was hoping I could go farther tomorrow and maybe catch him in a few days so we could chat again.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613969,"Another late start. Ugh. I still felt like crap this morning. Pumpkin was out way before me, shock, so I didn’t get to say goodbye. Mama Squirrel and I stayed by the fire ring and ate breakfast. She was nagging me to finish my breakfast because I wasn’t eating anything. If my emotions aren’t okay, I feel it in my gut, and I lose my appetite. I just couldn’t. 25-Mile wandered into camp and a couple with a dog. I can’t remember their names, but their dog is Raisin and she’s an adorable black lab. Rocky had ended up staying on Beauty Spot with a few guys, and they all walked down. One of the guys gave me “something” for my pain... I’ll hold onto it, but don’t know if I’ll use it. I chatted with 25-Mile for a bit. She’s very sweet and listened to me, and offered to hike with me today. I appreciated that. She actually said a prayer for me, which was nice. I didn’t know if drugs or a prayer would do anything to solve this, but I was happy to have people helping. 



They all left and I got my stuff packed up and headed out. There was a chance of thunderstorms and one of those ominous rain clouds hovering around. The day started with a big climb, but I didn’t think it was too bad. I caught up to Mama Squirrel, Rocky, and 25-Mile. There was a memorial tree on the trail for a boy that had killed himself, but had always loved hiking. His parents put his favorite ornaments and pictures up on the tree. It was very sad, but a nice way of remembering him. 25-Mile stopped for lunch and I kept going to the top of the mountain. And... no view. Lol my favorite! Climb for several miles and see nothing! I sat at the top, which was just a dense forest. It was pretty, but chilly too. I had a snack and 25-Mile came to sit. She was encouraging me to go to the campsite she was thinking of, but that was still a ways away. I told her I’d think about it, but that I was going to stop when I needed or wanted to.
I walked ahead and made it to a shelter. There were people sitting there chatting. I remember Hercules, Turtle, Basic, James, and Fish. Fish’s name stands for “Fuck it I’m staying here”, something she says when she’s done for the day. She’s super cool. They were all friendly. I filled up on my water and chatted. Fish gave me Jolly Ranchers. Chef and John were there too. 25-Mile arrived and got water too. The next campsite was 4 miles and I told her I was going to push for that, but she was thinking of one in 8 miles. It was 4pm, and I didn’t really want to nighthike, so I told her I’d see how I was in 4 miles. We walked together and chatted. She told me the story of her name. Some guy apparently called her a slow poke, and she told him she was going to hike 25-miles in a day at some point. She plans on doing that in Virginia. I would love to hike a 25-mile day too, but I’m not there yet. We found a campsite that wasn’t well marked. It was in a meadow. The couple with Raisin the dog was there and a guy named Ain’t Dead Yet, or Wes. I had seen him before, but a long time ago. 25-Mile knew him and tried to convince him to do more miles. I was pretty tired, but was down to do the 3.7 miles more, as I wanted to catch my friends in the next couple of days, and I wanted to make up for doing such low mileage. 


Wes joined us and we hiked on. 25-Mile asked me about my feelings about God. I told her about my church upbringing and how I was a spiritual person and believed in God, but that it wasn’t a huge part of my life. It made me think a lot about faith and its role in my life. And we talked about accepting Jesus as our savior, which is something my Uncle did. He was very spiritual and he passed away last fall. I was with him a few days before he died, and he seemed concerned about being forgiven and passing on. A lovely woman at the hospital came to talk to him about his faith, and had beautiful things to say. We prayed together. My Uncle died a few days later with a smile on his face, and we all wondered if he had made that peace with God and was ready to be taken from us. It made me think a lot about my faith, although I am still young and confused at times about where I stand. 


We finally got to the campsite that was 3.7 miles away and there was a man there, Hobo. He’s so awesome. We chatted with Hobo for a while and set up our stuff. It was late, but I was happy to have made it this far. Hobo helped us all with our bear lines, and we did all the usual camp chores. Water was far away and had a bad flow, so I was there for a while trying to fill my bottle. Hobo had started a fire and that was so nice to sit by and chat. We went to bed late because of all the chores and late arrival. I was thankful to 25-Mile for pushing me this far today and for a nice time by the campfire. I was still missing Prometheus so much, but I was happy to be surrounded by good company.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613971,"Today was going to be long. We knew that starting out because 25-Mile and I wanted to make it to this converted barn shelter called Overmountain shelter. It was 16.7 miles away. I got out earlier than the past few days, but still not that early. 25-Mile headed out before me, but I caught up to her at this overlook. It was a pretty view. I had felt good so far and was enjoying the hike. 25-Mile and I walked together for a bit and saw some beautiful scenery. It was a wonderful walk today. A lot of it was uphill because today we climbed Roan Mountain, and that beast was a 5-mile climb. But it was wonderful with the pine trees and dense forest. And there were spots with meadows that were equally beautiful. The climb took us a while and we stopped halfway for a lunch break. Speedy Queen was there. She headed out and then we did. We finally got to the top of Roan Mountain. There used to be a hotel there, so there were ruins and a sign about it all. There was no view because it had started to get overcast. It sprinkled rain, but nothing else really happened. I had put my pack cover on, but it didn’t get worse than the sprinkling. It looked bad though. There had been ominous clouds all day and the sun was completely hidden now. 


We kept walking til we got to the highest shelter on the AT, Roan High Knob. I had wanted to stay there when I originally left Erwin and didn’t plan on that low mileage, but at this point I didn’t want to stay there. It was really chilly and kind of creepy actually. It was stormy and the dense forest made it darker and I just didn’t like the vibe. We ran into Wes and he ended up staying there. I told 25-mile she didn’t need to press on if she didn’t want to, but she wanted to, so we kept going. I was anxious because it was again 4pm and we still had 7 miles to go. 


It was downhill for a bit, which was great, and then we had three little climbs to do. We came to Carver’s Gap, which had a lot of cars parked and going through and a restroom. The three little climbs were going to be balds, so wonderful views like Max Patch, and that’s why this gap was popular; you could go up the balds or Roan Mountain. I wasn’t sure what kind of view we’d get with the stormy weather, but I really wanted to get to Overmountain Shelter today. It would set me up well to get to Roan Mountain (the town) in a day, and I thought I might see Prometheus and I was missing him. I was getting really anxious because I didn’t want to get there in the dark. I am afraid of a lot of things, but the dark is definitely one of them. If I can avoid nighthiking, I’m going to. Plus, you can’t even see views at night. I hiked ahead of 25-Mile a bit because I was so anxious. You do need to hike your own hike out here and I needed to hike ahead to settle my fears and get where I wanted to be. I made sure to stop a few times to check for 25-Mile, but I was moving. 


It was gorgeous on the balds. We didn’t get the amazing view we might’ve gotten another day, but we did get a view. I loved it all. It was an incredible day of views and variety. We had pine trees and forest and then beautiful balds and meadows with stunning views. It was an awesome day of hiking. I actually thought to myself, “I need to come back here someday”. We arrived at another shelter and hobo had stopped to set up camp. He was tired and didn’t know if we were still carrying on to the barn, so he just set up here. It was a beautiful spot in a meadow, with little white flowers everywhere. I told him I was still going to the barn and 25-Mile came up behind me, also down to push on to the barn. 


I walked the next 2 miles faster than my normal pace and got there in 45 minutes. I was wiped, but so anxious to get there. It was so worth it. The barn was awesome. It had two floors and a ton of space, and a great view of the valley below. And there was a privy!! The past two days there were no privies, so I was digging catholes. We also didn’t have to hang our food because the bears weren’t likely to come into the barn, and we just hung our food up high in the rafters of the barn. I saw that entire clan that I ran into yesterday, with Fish and Hercules and all of them. I also saw Red Line. I met him at Laughing Heart Hostel a while ago. He was kind of annoying about space because I was trying to save a spot for 25-Mile, but there were plenty of spots around that weren’t next to me, so I didn’t fight him on it and knew she’d have a spot regardless. 


Prometheus was not there. I had no service, but I wanted to check in and see where he was. He had originally planned on staying at Roan High Knob the day before and then staying at the barn, because both were cool shelters. But I guess he skipped the barn. I hung out with Unicorn, NAB, and 25-Mile. It was cold. It wasn’t raining anymore, but it was chilly. In the distance you could see the mansion of the people who owned the area all lit up. I slept well and was so happy to have made those miles up. I loved the barn and was glad I made it there. It was a long day and I was pretty sore, but tomorrow would be a short 9 miles to town, so I was feeling good about where I was at.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613973,"Wind!! I got out super late today again. I missed Prometheus and was feeling sad. 25-Mile said another prayer with me and that was very sweet, but again I was struggling to shake what had happened. I let her head on and took my time. There were men there working on the barn and fixing some of the boards. They were very friendly and took pictures for us in front of the barn. Today had a few ups, but again had two balds, and those were beautiful. I met up with 25-Mile before the big climb. It was quite windy on both balds and I knew the big bald would be hard. 25-Mile went ahead of me and I had a snack. I powered up the mountain, but it was quite hard with the wind knocking me over as I was climbing. The views while climbing were so amazing though, it didn’t even matter. I was in love with this part of the trail. It really was stunning. It was hard to stand still at the top, so I didn’t stay long. 25-Mile had stopped for a snack, but I kept going. 


I finally got down below the windy bald and it was a nice downhill the rest of the way into town. I went quickly and was looking forward to town. 25-Mile caught up and we hiked together down to the road. I had planned on staying at the Doe River Hiker Rest, which was owned by the same people as the Station at 19e, another hostel, but Doe River was closed. I had my box sent there, but the owners brought all the mail drops over from one hostel to the other, so it was there. I guess the Station was doing well this year, so they didn’t need to keep both hostels open. It was about a half mile down the road, but they said they’d shuttle us, so we called them. We didn’t get an answer for 15 minutes of calling, so we just walked. They called us on the way and came and got us, but we were already halfway to the hostel by that point. 


We walked into the bunkhouse and I saw Prometheus! I was so happy, but also anxious because we needed to talk. The guy showed us to our bunks and we put our stuff down, and I headed down to see Prometheus. Unfortunately, people were in and out of the kitchen so we couldn’t really talk very much, but we talked a bit and were enough on the same page that I felt good. He came up to my bunk with me and chatted for a bit. It was so nice to be okay with him again. I really missed my buddy. I took a shower and did laundry and had a hot dog and a cider and mozzarella sticks down at the bar below the bunkhouse. Prometheus and I split a pint of Ben and Jerry’s. We had a nice time and Rocky and Mama Squirrel showed up, as well as Unicorn and NAB! 


Hot Sauce is sick with Bronchitis. Prometheus is convinced it’s because she pushed herself too hard, so they both said they were going to take it easy and slowly get to Damascus, VA. I had talked with 25-Mile about slackpacking, but now I was torn because I wanted to hike with Prometheus. I didn’t have a decision made yet, but I was happy to be with my crew. Prometheus was frustrated with the hostel for running like a business, and he’s made that point a few times. It’s definitely true though, the hostels here are not always catering to the hikers. It’s a base price, plus this, plus that. Rocky had wanted a bottle of wine and asked where the nearest liquor store was, and the hostel owners told her it was 34 miles away. Well that’s bullshit because Prometheus went to Ingles and it was 6 miles away, and there was plenty of wine there. So the hostel purposely lied to get Rocky’s business. That’s not catering to hikers. They had a little resupply, but had jacked up the prices of everything there, so when they could shuttle us to Ingles, 6 miles away, where we could buy affordable hiker food and alcohol, they said there was nothing nearby and we’d have to shop in their store and basically pay double. I didn’t need to resupply, but it still felt ridiculous to me. I know hostels have to make money too, but all these add-ons and lies are annoying. 


We hung out for a while and finally went to bed. Everyone was thinking of a low mileage day tomorrow to the first shelter, 8 miles or so away. Since I wasn’t taking a zero, that sounded good to me! I was so happy to be with Prometheus again and see Mama Squirrel and Rocky too. Today was a good day.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613974,"I got out late today, but I knew I wasn’t going far. I spent the morning organizing. Yesterday I organized my food bag, but today I needed to organize my pack. We went to a bakery in town for breakfast and that was delicious. I had some treats from friends at home sent to me at the hostel and we shared those last night and for lunch; they were awesome! Prometheus got out around 12 and I headed out around 1:30. I made good time and got to the shelter with plenty of daylight left. It was all climbing to get there of course, but I passed by two waterfalls! And the mile marker for 400!! That was so exciting. I stopped there for a bit and a guy named FKZ showed up. His name stands for “fastest known zero” because he was making jokes about beating the fastest known time on the AT and would not be able to beat it. He took a picture for me and sat for a bit. A girl named Kidney also showed up. She got her name from having kidney stones and having to get off trail. 


Kidney headed on with me to the falls, and we convinced FKZ to join us. He was hesitant about stopping for things like that if it was off trail, but we convinced him. It was worth it! It was a pretty waterfall. It looked like you could walk up it, and I kept thinking Prometheus must have done that earlier today because he loves adventure like that. I headed on in front of Kidney and we got to a little lake, which was also pretty. Kidney didn’t stop and kept going, but I stopped for a pic. It was not as beautiful as those balds, but today offered some nice attractions on the trail. I hiked along and the trail started to climb, so kidney slowed down. I passed her and powered through the uphill; I wanted to get to the shelter. There was another waterfall, but it wasn’t nearly as pretty. 



The shelter was really cool. It was three stories!! I was originally going to set up on the second level, but I looked up in the third-floor loft and it was cool. Prometheus and Hot Sauce were staying up there so I joined. Prometheus made a fire so we all ate our meals and hung out around the fire. We all didn’t want to hang our bear bags because we were in the loft and a bear wouldn’t come up there, but Prometheus decided to hang them anyway. He fiddled around with my rope for a while, trying to hang a line for us to put our bags on, but it didn’t work, so we just did a normal hang elsewhere down the trail. We put four bags on one line and it was ridiculously heavy. We all pulled and were able to get it up, but it was a lot. It was my food, Prometheus’ food, 25-Mile’s food, and Speedy Queen’s food. Hot Sauce ended up putting hers in the loft in the shelter.
It was dark by the time we finished that, so we all headed to bed. It was a nice day today, but not as wonderful as the past few days. It’s great to be with Prometheus again, although Hot Sauce has been pretty chilly with me, so I’m not sure she’s happy about me resolving things with Prometheus. I’m happy to at least be with the group and enjoy these times together.

",Mountaineer Shelter,"May 10, Fri",8.80
Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613975,"Today we all decided to go 10 miles or so to the next shelter. It was pouring rain when we woke up, so that was a factor, but Hot Sauce was also still taking it easy because of her sickness. Prometheus headed out early and Hot Sauce headed out a few minutes before me. We were joking around with two older guys in the shelter, Tom and Hiker Dan. Tom and Hiker Dan headed out before us, but I caught up to them soon and passed them. I was making really good time today. They were headed to Scotty’s Budget Solar Hostel. I had considered that place because I didn’t know much about Roan Mountain, TN, but once I was told about Roan Mountain, I decided to stop there instead. Scotty’s was a few miles past the shelter. It was a cold and wet day and it was slippery and muddy on the trail. 


I arrived around 1:30 to the shelter. I had left around 10, so I made good time and was really pleased with that. Hot Sauce and Prometheus had a clothes line up, so I hung my clothes on it and set up my sleep stuff. I went for water and it was ridiculously far. It was sprinkling rain by this point, but not pouring anymore. It was on and off as we sat in the shelter throughout the afternoon. 25-Mile arrived and asked if anyone wanted to keep hiking, but I didn’t. I wanted to be in a shelter, out of the rain, and with my friends. Unfortunately something terrible happened last night. I’m sure most of you have heard by now. There was a guy terrorizing hikers for weeks in the Erwin area, but no one pressed charges on him. He was let go from jail because they had no charges on him, and he ended up making his way back on trail and killing a man and injuring a woman last night. It was about 100 miles ahead of me. I had originally thought of hiking ahead of Damascus this week and then coming back for trail days, but now I knew I was just going to Damascus. They closed the trail where the incident occurred, but it did open a day or so later. 


Prometheus knew when I arrived at the shelter and broke the news to me. He had people from home reaching out to see if he was okay. I had no one reaching out so I figured it hadn’t made national news yet, but most people who knew me knew I wasn’t where the incident had occurred anyway. Still, I was craving contact because this was a pretty scary thing to have happen. I know it’s completely random and rare, but it happened 100 miles from me and I was afraid I might’ve known the victims, and I was genuinely scared. I’m so vulnerable out here anyway, being on my own. My life is in my backpack and I’m relying on social connections with other hikers to feel safe and comforted. It’s hard to be out here feeling so vulnerable and have this happen. There were lots of rumors going around and Prometheus was staying updated on Reddit, but we really knew nothing. 


We tried to make the most of the afternoon, hanging out and spending time with each other, staying comforted in the companionship. It came time to do camp chores and Prometheus went to hang his food bag. I was alone with Hot Sauce and I felt like talking to her about where we’re at because she’s been so chilly. Of course she was mean all over again. I was sweet to her and said “I’m sorry about all that’s gone down, but I resolved things with Prometheus and I’m happy to be with you guys again and I missed you” and she said “we’re not ready to start planning or doing things with you yet.” I will just mention that I had no drama with her recently. Nothing. I did nothing to her. What happened with Prometheus was between me and him, just like when she had drama with him a week before. But yet, somehow I’m always the problem, so of course Hot Sauce has to hate me even when I’ve done nothing to her. 


I was so upset and texted Prometheus to stay up there so I could walk up and talk to him. He had helped 25-Mile hang her bag and when she left, I was able to talk to him. He said that what Hot Sauce said was not true at all and that he was happy to hike with me. He had needed space too, but everything was good now. Why is this always the case with this kind of situation? The guy in the middle gets roped up into having opinions he doesn’t even know he has. Hot Sauce phrased it all as “we feel this way” when really “she” felt that way. Prometheus was fine having me back in the picture. I cried to him because I’m just so sick of this bullying and treatment from Hot Sauce. I’ve just tried to be a good friend and supportive hiking partner and she hates my guts because I walked into the situation and she got jealous. It’s just painful. I know it must sound trivial again, but it really is painful for me. I don’t hold grudges, I don’t cut people out in my life, which explains my hard friendship situations I’ve talked about before. But I was really trying to give Hot Sauce chance after chance to come around and warm up to me, and she just wasn’t. I just can’t stand not being liked by someone. It hurts my pride and my confidence and makes me hate myself. And she hates me simply because I walked into her friendship with Prometheus. 


Prometheus was very reassuring, but he opened up to me about something else while we were standing there and the whole thing with Hot Sauce went out the window. He’s leaving the trail. I don’t know when he officially decided, but tonight is the night he told me. He said it’s a variety of factors. The trail is run like a business in some places like the hostels and shuttles and he doesn’t like that and the same murders and violence that happen elsewhere can also happen here. There were also things at home that he wanted to get back to. I’m pretty upset because I just got to a good place with him again and now he’s leaving. I totally support him because he’s my buddy and I want the best for him, but this totally sucks. I’m going to miss him so much. I hugged him and it was such a long and special hug. I really did get so close so fast with him and that happens on the trail. I was going to the bathroom with the door open in our hotel room, something that took me years to do with my old boyfriend. I got to a comfort level with Prometheus so fast and that bond is so strong. I know I can stay friends with him. He is from MA and I’m from CT, so we’re not far from each other. But it still totally sucks to not have him here for the rest of my journey. But it is my journey and I have to remember that. Prometheus was a wonderful part of it, but he was just a part of it. There are many others that will be a part of it too. It was so hard to hear this news on top of everything else today, but I needed to know so I could prepare myself. 


We headed down and had dinner. Prometheus finished my dinner because I couldn’t, and we put our bags on his bear line. We went to bed and it rained a bit outside.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613976,"Today we were all slow-moving. It was not raining when we woke up, but it started to rain before we got going and that delayed us. Today 25-Mile wanted to go to Boots Off Hostel to do the slackpacking deal. I was still indecisive because I didn’t know Prometheus’ and Hot Sauce’s plan, but I was down to go to Boots Off and check it all out. It was 14 or so miles away, but there were two options to get off at a road crossing and a side blue-blaze trail before that. The road crossing cost money for pickup, but the blue-blaze did not. I didn’t want to pay for a shuttle, but I also didn’t want to go the whole 14 miles or so. We were all a bit rocked by the murder, and now I knew Prometheus was leaving, so I was emotionally dying. I decided to get off at the blue-blaze or the road crossing, but not go the whole way. The whole way included a huge mountain at the end anyway and I didn’t want to do that today.


Prometheus headed off first and then 25-Mile and then Hot Sauce. The rain let up and I called the hostel from this one place behind the shelter that got good service. They had me down with 25-Mile for bunks, but were prepared to pick me up now from one of those spots. At the same time, I got a text from Prometheus saying he was getting off trail too and going to Boots Off. I was so pumped because he originally was just planning on going to the next shelter, and I was worried about losing him with the whole slackpacking deal. I started to pack up and saw Tom and Hiker Dan, who were also headed to Boots Off, and Hobo too! Tom and Hiker Dan said there had been a fight at the hostel last night and that someone stole someone else’s identification and cards and then that person punched him in the eye and gave him a black eye. It was a loud mess and I was disturbed to find out this happened the same night we all found out about the murder.



There was also a guy named Hattrick that had been there last night, and another guy named Andy, who didn’t seem to want a trail name. A not so wonderful surprise came with my morning when I looked over in the shelter and saw “Sovereign” in red ink on the wall, with a drawing of an eye and a tower. “Sovereign” is the man who murdered the hiker and injured the other. He was literally here in this shelter and signed the wall in red and it was so creepy. I was ready to get out of there. But I also wanted to scribble out this asshole’s name. I left it, but was so disturbed after seeing it.I headed out late, but again made good time. Tom and Hiker Dan were slackpacking from Scotty’s to Boots Off, and I actually passed them, with pack! I was feeling really good. Tom yelled that I was kicking their asses. Maybe my body is finally adjusted to the pack and the weight and the trail?! Trail legs for real?! I powered through the little hills and came  to the road. I decided I could keep going, but it was a wet day. The next part was along the water and it was pretty, but slippery and muddy. I saw a girl inching her way down the rocks, and I totally understood. It was a bit of a mess with all the mud and water and rocks. I had my hood down and didn’t see the white blazes turning at one point, so I went the wrong way down the blue-blaze bypass. I realized and turned around, but it was an annoying detour, and getting off trail or lost at any point scares me. I found the part where I missed the blaze; it was a sharp turn left down a hill so I’m not surprised I missed it. 


I headed down, but it was all slippery rock steps. There was a family coming up and the kids looked absolutely miserable. One was having a total meltdown. I understood lol the kids had towels and bathing suits and were trying to climb these rocks in the pouring rain with sandals on. They had clearly been swimming in the falls, which I was about to see, but it was not a great day for that. The mom gave me a look of death just because she was probably realizing her mistake of trying to take the kids to the waterfall on a day like today, and I could imagine it would be a LONG walk back to the car for the family. I made it down and the waterfall was awesome. Definitely the best I’ve seen on trail so far!! My phone was wet, and even with the waterproof case was giving me trouble, but I was able to take a few pictures and head on. 


It was rocky and slippery along the water and I thought maybe the bypass was the way to go after all, but I would’ve missed the falls. There was actually one part of the trail that had about a foot of rock path right against the water, with a rock face on the other side. So I held the rock face and inched my way around, trying not to fall in the water. It was treacherous! I was expecting to pass a shelter and have that as a landmark, but I didn’t see it. I must have missed it with the rain and my head down and everything. I arrived at the blue-blaze trail. I was soaking. My clothes hadn’t dried the night before of course, ahh the trail life. So I had put on dry clothes and my rain coat, but was just a bucket of water all day. I decided to get off trail here and skip the big mountain for today. It was a long blue-blaze, but worth it. I got out at a parking lot and called Boots Off. It was free and they came and picked me up. 


I arrived and they showed me the bunkhouse. It was very small, but cool. It had outlets at every bunk and the bunks had different colored curtains for privacy. I  didn’t see Prometheus and was confused. I texted him and he said he had arrived there, but that they were full and he and Hot Sauce had to go elsewhere. I was so upset. I lost them again and now I wasn’t going to see Prometheus just days before he’s leaving. I settled in despite that and went to take a shower. I don’t blame the hostel, just the time of day, but it was the coldest shower. It was miserable. I had been soaking all day and just wanted warmth, and the showers were cold. I froze my way through the shower and put on as many dry clothes as I could find. 



The dinner shuttle left at 6. It takes you to McDonald’s and Subway, but I don’t like either place, so I went to Dollar General and got a frozen pizza to heat up. There isn’t much in the town of Hampton except a gas station, massive gun store, and those three stops I mentioned earlier. We headed back to the hostel and I quickly put my pizza in the little toaster oven. It took forever, so I socialized with everyone while I waited. I met Wild Violet and Flowers, and then there was Hiker Dan, Tom, Hattrick, Andy, 25-Mile, and Wes. There were a few more, but I didn’t catch their names. A group was playing spoons. I haven’t played that game in forever, but I passed for now because I was feeling poopy. 25-Mile was going to zero tomorrow and I was going to slackpack the 7 miles I didn’t do with the big mountain yesterday. We weren’t sure about the slackpack into Damascus, but I was thinking it through. I ate most of my pizza, but Hattrick finished it for me. I had some ice cream too. When I’m at a hostel for a few days, I’ll splurge on ice cream because I can have it multiple nights. Prometheus and I texted and he was at this house-turned-Hostel with Hot Sauce and it sounded so cool. I was jealous and wanted to be there too.
I headed to bed late since I just have a small slackpack tomorrow. It was such a cold and wet day and night and I’m still freezing. The air-conditioning is on in the bunkhouse. Hoping it warms up and dries out soon!!

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613977,"Short slackpack!! Today I got out late, but didn’t have far to go. It was free for them to take me back to the trail and it wasn’t far. I had breakfast, which was bananas, donuts, and cereal. I headed out around 1pm. I convinced another man to join me and he had gotten off from the blue-blaze yesterday too. His knee was hurting though so he couldn’t go fast. We headed out together, but I passed him on the uphill. I saw some other folks I had met before on the way up. It was a long up. Even without pack, I was annoyed at how long it took. There were several false summits and campsites, and finally it ended. No view of course though. One of the hostel owners said the trail originally went on the blue-blaze to town, but that someone rerouted it over this stupid mountain because why not. Lol classic, reroute the trail over this super long annoying mountain with no view. 



The downhill was good though and I was making great time. I walked out of the trail and spotted the hostel, which isn’t far. I walked to it and they were all shocked I made it back so early. They had named me “procrastinator” that morning and fine, I deserve that lol. I’ve been getting out so late. But I made great time! Late but fast! Haha. I finished 7 miles in 2 hours. It felt awesome. I decided to go down to the lake, as there is water right by the hostel. But it was quite cold, so I figured I’d just put my feet in. There was a group of guys called Riff Raff and they’re all kind of vulgar and rude partiers. The hostel owners were warning me about them. I kept my distance and 25-Mile and Wes were there, so I put my feet in and so did Wes, and we chatted. It was so cold. They headed back up to the hostel and I left a few minutes later. I put goofy town clothes on (fuzzy pajama pants and a flannel that did not match) and gave them my laundry and we planned the slackpack.
We went on the dinner run again and this time I got bagel bites and Totino’s pizza rolls. I heated them up when we got back and we finalized the slackpack plan. Boots Off will take you 21 miles away and you can hike back to their hostel southbound, and then the next day they’ll take you back to that spot and drop your pack off in Damascus, and you just hike northbound into Damascus. I was a little annoyed about going southbound. If you’re like that on the trail people call you a purist. I mean I tend to not like to skip blazes or hitch ahead or go the wrong way. I’ll let it slip if it’s a mile or so that I’ve missed, but for the most part I’ve hiked the whole trail with no skipping or shortcuts. And the southbound from this drop-off point was all downhill, which means it’s easier than the northbound, and to be a real “nobo” you’d be skipping a big climb and that felt off to me. Hiker Dan felt the same way and we both asked if there was a way to hike northbound. I was also trying to pace myself with Prometheus and Hot Sauce and didn’t want to get to Damascus too early. 



The owners said they could take my stuff in a trash bag to a hostel that was near the road 21 miles away, and that I could slackpack up to that hostel. I thought it was nice that they were working with me instead of screwing over another hostel just to get another night’s stay from me. Hiker Dan and I liked that plan. We weren’t sure if we’d slackpack the rest of the mileage to Damascus, but this would at least be one day of slackpacking and the right direction. And for me, if my friends were doing 10-mile days, I wouldn’t be too far ahead. The owners are goofy though and just like they gave me shit for procrastinating, they gave us shit for wanting to go northbound, so they wrote down “stupid people going opposite direction” and we put our names below that. Haha we were now the stupid people and it was pretty funny. “Stupid procrastinator” became a new temporary trail name. Haha.I ate my dinner and some more ice cream and my clean laundry was ready. I folded it up and spent time chatting with everyone. The man that slackpacked with me today said I was a “fucking beast” and it felt good. I do feel the change in my pace and it is making me happy. I love that my trail legs seem to be here! Someone had been kicked out of Riff Raff and was describing that, and everyone else was talking about the murder. It was on everyone’s mind. We still didn’t know names, but we knew a man officially died and that the girl was in the hospital. We were all still processing it, but it was nice to have the company to process through it together. 


I took a late shower because I thought I’d get warm water if it was later. I was partly right and got some warm water, but it got cold quickly and I still didn’t get my hot shower. I put on my clean clothes and went to bed. I still had to organize all my stuff, but I’d do that in the morning.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613979,"Big slackpack today! Hiker Dan got out super early because he wanted to make it there in good time. Everyone else left at 8 in the shuttle up to the road. Hiker Dan and I had another stupid person join us haha and her name is Flowers. She’s very sweet and she’s from Germany! She headed out before me too. I packed up and gave them my trash bag of stuff and then took my time and had breakfast. The start of the slackpack was nice, but muddy. It was right along the lake though, and I love views like that. I ran into Wild Violet and she had lost her cup. I had seen it, but hadn’t stopped to get it. I should’ve. I think we all think about weight though when we see that. I also worry I’ll never find the owner to the lost item and that I’ll just carry it around for weeks as extra weight. I didn’t know it was her’s. I think she went back and got it though so it’s okay. 



The climb uphill wasn’t too bad, especially without pack, but it was long. It was easier after, but still uphill. I ran into everyone going southbound. I was frustrated by the trail today because it was very overgrown. I was getting scratched constantly and had cuts on my legs. And I was worried about ticks. It was annoying. I wish I could’ve brought a lawnmower onto the trail and cleared it all. I saw Hot Sauce. I saw her yesterday too, slackpacking from the road she and Prometheus got off on. Today she was slackpacking from the same place Boots Off takes you to, so also southbound. I guess Prometheus is not doing any more hiking. He’s just done now. I support him either way. But Hot Sauce wanted to do the mileage, so she’s slackpacking. I guess I don’t need to worry about getting ahead anymore. Hot Sauce had the dog of the owner of the hostel she’s at. It was a beautiful dog and I was squealing. I was again jealous that I had not stayed with them at that hostel.
I finally got through most of the mileage and saw Flowers. She was surprised I caught up to her. I was too, but also happy because that means I made good time. I headed in front and she was close behind and we made it down to the road. A man was there with trail magic, so he had a cold coke waiting for me and that was awesome! So so great. He’s starting his own hostel called “The Discerning Hiker” next year. It was the best surprise at the end of my day to meet him. Unicorn and NAB were there. They were asking me about my pack and I stupidly said “I don’t have my brain” and didn’t realize what I said. So they gave me a look and I continued with, “yeah I didn’t need my brain so I sent it home”. At that moment I may have actually sent my real brain home. I got it late as I do with most jokes and then I laughed. 21 miles will wipe everything up there I tell ya. Haha. Flowers and I had sodas and snacks and I called the “Rabbit Hole”, where we’re staying tonight. 


They quickly came and got us. The “Rabbit Hole” is also a fairly new hostel. It has one main bunkhouse. No sheets, but towels and heat and fans. There are outdoor showers and outdoor potties. I liked it quite a bit actually. We had to wait a bit to get our stuff, but Rabbit, the owner, brought it up and we took showers and changed. The shower was hot!! It was hot for probably 20 minutes too before it got cold. I was so happy. They were watching “National Treasure” inside. That’s always on TV haha. We saw Hiker Dan. He had gotten there much earlier, but we all made it! Someone at the trail magic nicely gave me a bracelet for the Rabbit Hole that he had gotten a while ago and wasn’t going to use and that got me a free milkshake!! It was awesome!
The hostel owners made ribs and mashed potatoes. That may sound amazing to most, but that is literally the least appealing to me. Ribs or any meat on a bone grosses me out, and I don’t like mashed potatoes. Picky picky, I know. They had corn too and I do like corn, so I picked at the rest and had some corn. And then my chocolate milkshake for dessert! We watched TV and hung out. The hostel owner got a call from a hiker that had stayed the night before and was in a bit of a predicament. A bear ate her food! I’ve been lucky to not have any bear interactions yet. She was camping alone and had an ursack, which is a really tough material bag that you can just tie to a tree. The bears apparently “can’t rip through it”, but this bear did. She saw him take her bag down and paw at it, and she tried to look big and scary and scream at it, as you’re supposed to do. The bear didn’t give a crap and stood up on his hind legs and stared at her. She quickly packed up and got out of there, nighthiking two miles to the road because she had no food and was scared. The hostel owner picked her up and brought her back. Her name is Salamander.
Once we were all safely settled and relaxed, we headed to bed. Not sure what I’m doing tomorrow, but if Hot Sauce is slackpacking and Prometheus is going in by car to Damascus, I guess I’ll slack it too!

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613980,"Today people started getting going around 8ish. Hiker Dan and Flowers took the first ride back to the trailhead and I waited for the next. I left around 9:45. It was a chilly day again, but the sun was out. The start of the day was through a cow pasture, which was actually pretty cool! It crossed a few fences and then headed into the woods. There were a lot of teeny tiny uphills and that was annoying, but it wasn’t bad without pack. I ran into Raisin and her owners. I quickly made it to Low Gap (the five millionth Low Gap) and there was more trail magic!! It was the same guy from yesterday. He was making hot dogs and had lots of snacks. Such a cool guy! 


I had a hot dog and soda and cookies, but of course that stuff doesn’t always sit well with you when you’re hiking. It was uphill out of Low Gap, of course. So I could feel that hot dog and soda as I climbed and felt sluggish. I felt that way for a few more hours and then finally it all settled and I was good. And I ran into Hiker Dan and Flowers. They had joked with me about leaving late and catching up. Well I did!! I caught up to all of them! Hot Sauce and Hobo were there too. I passed them and stayed behind Hot Sauce. We were going to cross the border soon into Virginia and I really wanted to get pics there.


We made it to the border!! Yay!! It felt so good!! It took so long to finally leave Tennessee. We were back and forth with North Carolina and Tennessee for so long, and now we were done with both states!! Yay!! Virginia is going to be a long haul. They actually call it the Virginia blues because it’s close to 500 miles in Virginia alone. But I was still happy to have another accomplishment and feel that progress. We took a ton of pics and got a group pic too. Hot Sauce left first, but I caught up to her. We headed into Damascus together and took pictures under the wooden arch. It was so exciting!! Damascus is a big deal because they host Trail Days, the biggest hiker festival of the year. We could see the flags lining the sidewalk and tents up everywhere. They were still setting up, but it was so exciting to be here!! And we had done 42 miles in two days. And about 7 hours each day for me, which means I went about 3 miles per hour for 21 miles each day, and that makes me so happy! 


I waited for Hiker Dan and Flowers and called Rabbit to tell him we had arrived. We didn’t know where we were going to stay, but Prometheus had texted me that he was staying at the Broken Fiddle Hostel. I told Rabbit to meet us there and we all walked through town to the hostel. It was a long walk, but it was a cool town! The hostel had room for tenting, so we set up our tents in the backyard. I set up next to Prometheus’ tent. There wasn’t much room, so I decided to stay in his tent and have Hot Sauce in mine. I hadn’t gotten any time with him either and wanted to watch a movie and chat. Prometheus and Hot Sauce came back and we headed to dinner together. I got pizza and chicken tenders and it was all delicious, but I couldn’t finish it. I have no idea why, considering that I just hiked 21 miles. My lack of appetite really is frustrating. 


We walked back and headed to bed. Prometheus and I didn’t watch our movie; we were just too tired. But I was happy to be reunited with him and try to get as much time as we could before he leaves.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613994,"I’m sorry for the rant I’m about to go on, but I can’t take it anymore. Hot Sauce planned a hotel room with her parents and Prometheus, and she’s been talking about it for days. I’ve accepted that she’s not including me and I’m done fighting this situation, but she keeps bringing it up and blatantly ignoring me when she does. I’m sorry for my language, but she is being such a bitch. I complained a long time ago that I was done with female friendships. Girls are just awful to each other. I’m so over it. I went to a women’s college full of petty, exclusive drama and you’d think that women at this age would have outgrown those ridiculous and childish behaviors. It really is like middleschool immature drama. Omg Hot Sauce isn’t inviting Little Debbie to her birthday party, but everyone else is invited. But make sure Little Debbie knows that we don’t like her in our clique and that she can’t sit with us. What is this. Come on. And even though it’s stupid and immature, it still hurts just as much now as it did then to be the person excluded. It’s such a mean thing to do. And especially since I didn’t do ANYTHING to her to make her hate me, it just hurts that much more. 


She’s been talking about her stupid hotel situation for days and everyone we run into is invited, so it’s actually not just Prometheus. And she doesn’t give a crap that she’s talking about it right in front of me and didn’t invite me. When Prometheus told me he was leaving the trail, he told her a day later and when I ran into her slackpacking, she was pissed he had told me first. Why on earth does it matter who he told first?! 


And then when Prometheus had organized where to stay with me for last night, she ran into me again while slackpacking and was pissed I was staying in the same place. She’s literally bullying me. And if Prometheus didn’t matter to me, I’d leave them all. But he does matter, so I’ve been putting myself through this crap every day just to stay with a friend I’m close to. And a friend that’s not even defending me. Prometheus has watched this whole thing go down and said “yeah it sucks, but it is what it is”. He’s still all buddy-buddy with her, even though he’s been pissed at her too for pushing him and leaning on him at times. I’ve just been sitting here supporting him when he doesn’t like her and taking the brunt of her crap when they’re buddies again. I know guys don’t like to get involved in these things and I’m irritated because I didn’t want any drama in the first place, but it hurts so much to have her doing this and have him watching as the bystander, not doing anything. 


I know I’m young and this is trivial and I should shake it off. I hear you, adults. But it’s painful for me. Someone literally hates my guts and I did nothing to deserve it. I’ve been myself this whole time and I’ve been nothing but warm and bubbly with Hot Sauce since the first day I met her. I’m trying to enjoy my last few days with my best buddy on the trail and I’m being bullied and excluded by someone and that in turn is preventing me from seeing him. I just feel so upset and frustrated and angry. This is my journey and I’m trying not to let her ruin it, but it’s hard. This whole thing is really hard for me. 


Today started off well and Prometheus and I got breakfast together. We met up with Hot Sauce and Denver and headed to an Outfitter. They had special Trail Days shirts, so we got matching shirts and wore them out. I originally just wanted my own, but Denver decided to get one too, so Hot Sauce and Prometheus did too. We didn’t even get a picture in our shirts, but it’s not really my crew I guess since they’re all disappearing to a hotel and leaving me to my tent tomorrow. It was fun to shop around though and I was enjoying myself, despite the crap I’m going through. I’ve worked so hard on dealing with this kind of crap, but I just feel like I’m eternally going to be the dumping ground of every friend I have. Will anyone actually put me first and defend me? I can’t take it anymore. I can only give so much before I am completely done. My college friend who I’ve talked about did the same thing and pitted people against me, making me feel alone and horrible. And the worst part is that people really do follow the control. So she was able to get them all behind her, and so was Hot Sauce. It felt like Hot Sauce was “winning” and I was losing. I had no hotel room, no party with my friends, no car to go places, no inclusion. But I guess I am actually in a better place because I’m happy with myself and don’t need to do this to others to make myself feel good. But despite feeling great about myself and my life these days, this whole scenario was quite a blow to my confidence. It made me feel like everyone was watching me and knew I was alone and not included. It made me feel insecure and anxious and alone. Even though no one was thinking that, I felt like a bug under a microscope today. I almost just didn’t want to be at Trail Days anymore so I wouldn’t have to live with the pain of what she did. 


We headed back to the hostel and I took a nap. I woke up and walked into town with Prometheus. Earlier we had walked in and gotten free cookies and signed a board with where we’re from. This time we were on the hunt for dinner tickets. They had given them out at some booth earlier, but we never saw the booth. We didn’t find it this time either and headed back to the hostel. His friend picked him up for a bit and I walked down to dinner with Hiker Dan and Flowers, hoping to score a ticket there. Luckily we found a woman with extras and she gave those to me and Mama Squirrel, who had just arrived!! We got in line and ate dinner in the firehouse! It was fried chicken and mac and cheese with bread and a delicious crunchy salad. It had ramen noodles in it, and I’ve made a salad like that before. It was funny because hikers really do eat so many ramen noodles. I couldn’t finish my dinner... shock. I brought it back to the hostel for Prometheus and he and I walked to the Dollar General. I got some wine for later and we walked to a vigil. It was in a field and for the guy who died. Hot Sauce was using his death as her spotlight and was interviewed, later screaming down the road “I was on TV!!” *eye roll* Prometheus was actually having a hard time because his brother died suddenly a few years back and they held a vigil in a field like this and it was bringing a lot back for him. I put my hand on his shoulder as we stood there, and yet he went for a hug with Hot Sauce after. I just can’t anymore. The vigil itself was a wonderful gathering of support and love with the AT community. It was sad to hear about the great man who’s life was taken, but the prayers and words about him were comforting. He was a Veteran and he was using the trail to heal. I recognized his face, but I don’t remember really meeting him, maybe just crossing paths at one point. He was taken way too soon and in such a violent and disturbing manner. We all yelled “AT Strong”, as his trail name was “Stronghold” and we are staying strong together as a community of 2019 hikers. May he forever hike on in heaven. I will keep him in my thoughts and prayers as I walk on. 


Hot Sauce was again talking about her hotel plans with yet another person. With Prometheus basically ignoring my attempt to be there for him and her bullshit, I just left. I couldn’t take it anymore. My blood was absolutely boiling. I hate when I’m that mad, and I knew I needed to calm down. I walked down to Tent City. It’s kind of wild, which is why I haven’t camped there. It’s a big area with drugs, alcohol, and an equal amount of cops. But I did run into my old buds, Wobbles and Thunder Buddy and Tiger Bomb!! It was so exciting!! Green Slouch showed up too! My old squad!! They had separated a bit, but the reunion was amazing. Wobbles was super happy to see me and said I need to hike with them now. I’m so happy!! I have my old crew and a chance to start over and hike with them for real this time. It made me so happy. We chilled by the fire. People were screaming and a conga line was going through the whole city, along with a ton of cops. We could hear Riff Raff and their drum circle in the distance; a kind of insane cult-like party that I went to another night. 



Thunder Buddy walked me all the way home, which was so so sweet. He’s awesome! I’m so happy to have seen them all. I was still livid about my previous situation, but I was able to calm down a bit with people who actually enjoy my company. What a concept. I walked home to the Broken Fiddle and got into the tent. Prometheus was sound asleep, but woke up to me a bit later. We didn’t really talk. He knew I was pissed because I had texted him when I headed to tent city, and he validated how I was feeling, but again didn’t really do anything. Whatever. Tomorrow they’re all leaving for this hotel shindig. I’m honestly really depressed about it all, but I hope I can find a way to enjoy Trail Days despite it.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613997,"Today I blogged. I know people have been asking about my blog and I simply stopped because I was having a rough time with all the drama that’s been going on and I was trying to enjoy my time with my friend. But I knew I needed to write it before I forgot what happened. I write my blog to share my experiences, but also to help myself remember it all years down the road. I’m sure I’ll look back on the drama as a wise old woman and think it’s all silly. But for now, it’s a bit consuming. Prometheus left the tent early to go to the park and see all the vendors. He’s been pretty pumped about this weekend, as it’s basically his goodbye party. He has a crazy outfit with short-shorts and rainbow socks and he’s just having a blast. He should! I am totally in support of it all and I intend on going crazy for the parade tomorrow. But this morning I decided what I wanted to do more than anything was blog. I just needed to process through everything that’s been going on. 


It took me four hours, so you’re all welcome for the new entries. Haha. A lot happens on this trail! Prometheus came back to the tent and told me to stop sulking. I said I was blogging and he understood, but he knew I was dreading him leaving with Hot Sauce today to the hotel and he knew I was upset. I packed up my stuff out of his tent and he packed up his tent. Hot Sauce had moved out of mine. I can’t believe I let her stay in there with all the crap she’s done to me. I was way too nice to a bully. Waste of my niceness. Watch out world, if the assholes continue to take my niceness I’m going to be a mean old grumpy Scrooge-woman, walking around pointing my finger and saying “you dumb kids!” Hot Sauce hates her own tent because it’s a tiny one-person. I think I’ve mentioned that. But she’s wanted to stay in Prometheus’ tent for that reason, and I stayed with him this time so I could have that time to chat or watch something. And there was only room for her tent or mine next to his, so I let her use mine as a nice gesture since she hates her’s. Waste of niceness lol. 


But it paid off because my tent was all set up, so I just moved all my stuff into it. Prometheus and I left to go to town. I wanted to get my feet washed and massaged, a free service they were offering. They had doctors there too, but my feet are actually doing okay. My pinkies are eternally gross at this point, but otherwise my feet are good. The woman massaging them actually said the muscles felt good and there were no signs of Plantar Fasciitis or anything like that. Prometheus didn’t want to wait in line, but Hot Sauce was also texting him about her car and putting his pack into it. Wonderful. I left with my nice new feet and walked down to the park. It was a little late by this point and most of the tents were starting to pack up for the day. It was pretty cool though. They had every big outdoors company there: Big Agnes, Gregory, Hyperlite, Zpacks, DarnTough, REI, MountainSmith, GraniteGear, etc. I have had no issues with my tent or pad, but Big Agnes was great so if I had had any issues, they would’ve been awesome about it for sure. My pack is also not an issue, but its weight is, so I thought about replacing it. There’s a sale at REI this weekend so if I find something I like here, I may ask my mom to get it and send it. 



There were food trucks and a big stage with bands playing. It was pretty cool! I saw Prometheus and he showed me around a bit. He was really sweet and saw me eyeing a Titanium cup that’s super lightweight by the company Toaks. He bought it for me without me realizing, and it was so nice of him. He also surprised me with a new spoon, since mine is pretty gross and somehow turned green. He’s the best and I was so thankful for his generosity. He left to meet Hot Sauce and go to the hotel.
I was alone again. I saw Hiker Dan and Flowers though and joined them. I got a pizza from the food trucks and some ice cream too. Hiker Dan and Flowers were here to see the bands. A few old people were dancing. It was kind of an older, town vibe. The young hikers were not really here. I knew they were in Tent City. But it was nice to hang out for a bit. It was crowded and a dog jumped up and knocked someone’s pizza right onto the ground. The dog owner paid for a new one, but it was unfortunate. I left the vendors with a bunch of random gear somehow in my hands. I bought a Trail Days T-shirt and had a bunch of free stickers and the cup and free socks. 


I dropped it off in my tent and felt pretty damn sad. Prometheus was gone from his spot and someone else had moved right in. And now I was alone here. I rallied though and got my bottle of wine and headed to Tent City. When I arrived, they were all sitting by the fire. But tonight the fire was tiki torches, which was pretty funny. It started out just a few of us. Thunder Buddy had a huge handle of bourbon and was pouring a ton for me. It was delicious. We were all joking around and Thunder Buddy and I were dared to try the weight of the camp chair; it held both of us. Haha. More people showed up and it was both my original crews! Red Wiggler, Tiger Bomb, Natty D, Hermione, Green Slouch, Wobbles, Tinder (now Manager), Rocket (who I don’t know well but is really cool), Patches, Passport, Florida Man, Chug, Naners, FKZ, Honey Buns, and a few more. It was so much fun. Also I did run into Ringer earlier today and I missed him so much! He’s not doing too well and his knee and hip are both screwed up. He’s staying at the Broken Fiddle, but going home for a bit to recover. I think he’ll come back. He’s so awesome. I love that man. Sassafras is there with him and both were not there tonight, but are part of that tramily. 


We had such a blast tonight. I had a lot of bourbon. It was good haha. Red Wiggler showed up with a random bowl of pasta, so naturally I immediately needed to know the source of said pasta. And then found myself, several bourbons deep, wandering through the woods dragging Thunder Buddy along until I found a random set of lights and a woman standing with a big pot of pasta. I tell ya folks, the stuff you see in this place... I took the bowl of pasta from the random woman in the woods. Unclear if I was going to be eaten or cooked later, but I followed the pasta and I have no regrets. I had two helpings. Apparently I found out later I wandered into a cult, but they served me pasta so I don’t really see an issue here. Will Diana return to CT or will she join random pasta cult in the woods? New trail family? Stay tuned. 


I wandered back to the group and things were beginning to die down. I decided to head home and said goodnight to everyone. I made it home safely; not much is happening in the main town of Damascus at 2am. It’s a longggg walk from Tent City, but it was actually nice to come back to peace and quiet. The Broken Fiddle is kind of a “smoke a lot of weed and play the guitar all night” kind of vibe. Very laid back. I got into my tent and relaxed for the night. It was still sad not having Prometheus there, but I had an awesome night and I didn’t need that silly hotel party anyway. I passed out quickly too, so I didn’t need to stay up being sad.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613998,"Today I got up earlier. I wanted to enjoy more of Trail Days. I walked to the Post Office to get my mail drop and brought it to my Inn to store until tomorrow night, when I treat myself to the damn hotel! I also wanted to get my new shoes out of the box so I could walk around in them. I did that and then ran into Mama Bird (Mountain Laurel) and Balto (Chad)!! Ahh I missed them so much. Fave couple, they’re the best!! They invited me to breakfast at the diner. I had gone with Prometheus the other day and it was great, but today it was a bit lacking. I know they were probably overwhelmed, but my bacon was burned black and my eggs were dry. They also served biscuits and gravy and grits and I was not about it. Discovered I don’t really like that, but I’m not from the south so I don’t need to haha. We were sitting with two other girls, Keebler and another who I’m blanking on. They were awesome and we had a really nice time. It was funny because as soon as the food came, the table was completely silent and we were all digging in. Hikers! I’m going to have to re-train myself to eat like a normal human again. Napkin in lap, slow bites, dab of the napkin on the chin, head up, shoulders straight, bend and snap. But seriously apologies in advance for my downward trend on the matter. Pooping in the woods, bending over my food plate, I’m losing it folks. 


Next we went to the thrift shop and yes we popped tags and I only have $20 in my pocket. I don’t think I’ve ever been to one before actually. We were going to get outfits for the hiker parade and hiker prom!! I found a pink dress that I loved immediately and it was my size, ya gotta love when that happens. Prometheus texted me and came to meet me. He got a ridiculous outfit with some 80s flower-vest and a black blazer and a clip-on tie, paired with “chick-magnet” socks and his short-shorts. It was so great. I paired my pink dress with a cheetah-print blazer, which I’ve never worn in my life, but it was amazing. I got black platform flip flops too, which are actually really comfortable. It all cost me 8 bucks and it was quite the outfit. I think I’m wearing it all to prom, and for the parade I’m wearing my tie-dye shirt and getting some things to accessorize. We went to Dollar General next, where I got beads and a bow and glitter hairspray and my amazing koozie that says “I pooped today”. I was being unapologetically myself today and having a blast. 


We walked to the park with the vendors again and I sprayed glitter on his beard. I’m pretty sure I got it all in his mouth and eyes too, but it was hard to contain the glitter! It was a pretty great glitter beard, I must say. We walked through and I grabbed free sunglasses from REI and lay on their huge inflatable unicorn floatie. I pulled my shirt up a bit because it was ridiculously hot today. I was sweating buckets. And because I felt confident and good about my body. We walked around more and Prometheus sweet-talked all the vendors, no surprise there. I was hurrying his butt because we were going to be late for the parade. We got there and I separated from him because I knew he was going to find Hot Sauce and I’m completely done with her. I went to Wobbles and Thunder Buddy and that whole crowd. It was quite the scene. I guess the tradition is for men to wear dresses and women to wear blazers, but I mean wow. The men went all out. Most of the girls were in normal clothes. These are the most straight-arrow men I’ve met and they were all in dresses, with one even having mangoes in his dress as boobs. The freaking mangoes were bigger than my real boobs, but I’m not bitter about it. 


I was cracking up. Some of them had water guns and were squirting each other, but the real fun will come when the townspeople spray us all. Prometheus came over and sprayed my hair with glitter for me. He went back to Hot Sauce and I stayed with my crew. Hermione got her hair died purple and I actually saw several girls do that! I was debating it, but wasn’t sure how the dye would come out and how it would affect the current dye I have in my hair. We all lined up and started walking! Everyone was screaming and it was awesome! The firetruck leading the parade was spraying water everywhere and then the townspeople were going crazy too. It was on the sides mainly though, so Thunder Buddy and Quick bear and I were running back and forth to get sprayed. I got totally soaked and was loving it on this hot day. This one absolutely adorable little kid got me right in the face as I was talking a video. It was amazing. His sneaky little face omg he was precious. He got me good. Right in the face lol. It was so great to see all these people out here to support the hikers and all these hikers in ridiculous outfits having a blast and being themselves. I don’t think there’s a better crew out there than hikers. I mean you have some asses here, but for the most part everyone is so genuine and open and fun to be around. I felt like I really found my place and was just walking with my people. It felt so good. 


We ended the parade at Odie’s bus (the Hiker Yearbook guy). He was on top of the bus giving a speech about how amazing hikers are and listing the policies for having a good hike and respecting nature too. He also cheered for Stronghold and we all shouted AT Strong. I’ve been wearing two ribbons for Stronghold on my shirt all day and intend to put them on my pack too. What an amazing community coming together like this. The President of the ATC climbed up on the bus as well and chatted with us all. They were throwing out candy and bracelets too. They ended their speeches and we all dispersed. I had left my belongings all the way across town at the Outfitter so they wouldn’t get wet, so I trekked back over there to get them. I went into the gas station too and got some water and Gatorade. I walked back over to the park after (it was actually a lot of walking haha getting my miles in!) and went to the Visitor’s Center to charge my phone. I met a few folks charging their phones as well and one man offered me a ride to Hiker Prom tonight. His name was Man Dude. 


Prometheus showed up and sat with me for a bit. We ate pop tarts and chatted. He left to go jump in the river. It sounded tempting, but I had run my phone down to 1%, so I was waiting a bit for it to charge. After it was charged, I walked to Tent City. I wanted to get a video of this place in daylight so I could show people what it was like! I then took a shower in this random shower bus that the church has sponsored. It was a good shower, but the bus was shaking and it was an interesting experience haha. And right after I got out it started raining! I walked in the rain almost all the way back to my hostel, before Man Dude found me and picked me up. I changed into my pink dress and blazer and we headed to the Brewery. 


Man Dude did not stay long, it was not very exciting at first. But Wobbles and Manager were there, and pretty soon the whole crew showed up. I got a chocolate beer, which was pretty good!! Thunder Buddy walked all the way to the Brewery and we walked over to Food City together to get something to eat. I got some snacks and he got a sandwich and we went back to the Brewery. I met the nicest two men who lived in the area and were interested in my hike and they bought me a beer!! It was so nice of them!! I got a beer with CBD in it and it was relaxing and quite tasty. I listened to the band for a bit and they were actually quite good!! A lot of classic rock music, which is my fave. Naners, Chug, Thunder Buddy, and I decided to walk back. We tried to get a hitch, but were unsuccessful. We walked all the way back to Tent City. I dropped my snacks off in Thunder Buddy’s tent and we walked to the Drum Circle. This was my first time and it was very interesting. It was so loud. They were all drumming and screaming and there were flamethrowers as well. It was packed with people. We stayed for a bit and then walked back through. I found the random pasta lady again (omg two nights in a row, have a I joined the cult yet) and definitely got myself a bowl or two. With less bourbon in me I was able to sense a bit of a weirder vibe surrounding the random pasta lady in the woods, so Thunder Buddy and I peaced and went back to the crew. They were keeping it low-key tonight and we hung for a bit and then I decided to head home. I was pretty tired and it was a long day. I passed out quickly, but realized I sunburned my tummy (ugh I know I should’ve expected it) so that was a little uncomfortable to sleep on. What a day.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613999,"Today is my last zero here in Damascus and most of the festivities are over. I can tell because I actually have service and when it was crazy busy here my service was so slow. I woke up sweating buckets inside my tent and took it down so I could air my things out and get packed up. I chatted with Hiker Dan and Flowers for a bit. They’re leaving town today. They’ve been so awesome to hike with and get to know and I’m looking forward to seeing more of them! They gave me their extra hard ciders and wine, which was so nice. Wobbles, Naners, and FKZ showed up to do their laundry at the hostel since there was no option for that around Tent City. They sat with me while I packed and they packed up too. They’re all pretty ultralight, so they had much less gear than me. But hike your own hike! 



There was a freak rainstorm and I quickly moved all my stuff under the porch. I procrastinated moving for a while because I had so much stuff with me to carry to the hotel. I had new shoes and all this Trail Days gear to send home and whatnot. I finally walked it all over in two trips and said goodbye to the whole gang. Odie walked in and just as he did I picked up my trash bag of stuff and my hiking poles poked two holes. We all laughed and he said “I love hiker problems.” I definitely should’ve considered the decision to put poles into a trash bag, but sometimes my tired brain doesn’t want to deal haha.
I sat in my hotel room and aired out my stuff and relaxed. I watched Pearl Harbor on TV, one of the war movies I’ll actually watch with my father because it’s got a bunch of romance. Haha. I also watched Cake Wars and missed baking. Post-trail I’m going to go back to baking and gain 500 pounds thinking I can eat a whole cake because I need the calories. Lol. I blogged a bit and then went downstairs for dinner. I sat alone, but was enjoying the time to myself and blogged and planned a bit at dinner. I was thinking a bit about my old boyfriend because today is our old anniversary. It hasn’t been a year since it ended, but today is still what was an important date for a long time. It was ironic because as I was thinking about it I saw a big sign that said “Love” outside the window. Hm. I will always love him, he’s such a wonderful person. But I’m also at peace today and enjoyed my dinner and my time to think. 


Prometheus left today and didn’t get to say goodbye because Hot Sauce’s family wanted to leave. It hurt to not be able to say goodbye, but I got as much time as I could with him and hope to see him more in the future. I was texting Thunder Buddy and apparently they all stayed at the hostel and are staying the night, which is pretty funny because they were all convinced they were leaving today and then decided to zero. Even despite my zero, I’m still tired from the weekend. I’ll probably do low mileage tomorrow and get out late, but overall I’m feeling good and ready to hike. I’m glad the drama is behind me for now and I’m excited for more adventures and milestones with this amazing hiking community. 


I am watching Everybody Loves Raymond, such a good show, and snacking on some wine and chocolate. The life! Happy Anniversary to me haha. I love you Diana! Happy end to Trail Days too! What an adventure.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617224,"I want to start today’s blog entry by responding to a comment a reader left. I appreciate all those who read my journal and follow along, and I appreciate the comments and advice I’ve been given. I may not respond to all the comments (mostly because I’m bad with technology and don’t know how to on this site, but also because I just don’t have time), but I still am thankful for them. This blog takes a long time for me to keep up, and I could just write it for myself, but I want to share my experiences with everyone. I am responding to this comment because it made me angry. My experiences are my own, and my feelings and emotions in my journal are also my own. I’m hiking my own hike and living and experiencing it all on my own. I do like being alone with myself and don’t need to “learn” how to do that. I’ve hiked 487 miles as I write this and that is pretty damn impressive. I have had connections and drama along the way, but I am still out here walking every day, by myself, supporting myself with my hard-earned money and battling different challenges. You are all entitled to your own opinion, but my hike is not a “soap opera”. If you think my hike is a soap opera, you do not have to read my blog or leave comments here. Just because I want connections does not mean I can’t be alone. I came out here alone. I spent the first month alone. This trail is incredibly difficult both physically and mentally and so many people have quit. I’m still here. I’m an emotional person. This is my space to process everything I’m going through. It is my space to share MY HIKE. I did not come out here needing a trail family, a boyfriend, a best friend. I came out here on my own to fulfill my dream. I spent time preparing and buying all my gear and flew down to Amicalola, ON MY OWN. 


I found friends and we clicked and I decided to hike with them. The drama that resulted was part of my journey. It’s part of the learning and growing that I’m doing. It was not all drama, and if you’d care to read back through my journals, you’ll see the happy and fun times I had with these two. Sometimes it was non-stop laughs up a challenging mountain, other times it was Deb’s fifteenth pack shakedown, other times it was giggling on our sleep pads that we made into a couch, other times it was crying and holding each other through sickness and difficult days. I had good and bad times with them, but have no regrets about hiking with them. They greatly improved my life here on trail. I’m sitting here on my own at the moment, having done all my camp chores without problem: bear bag line is up, water is filtered, tent is up and sleeping bag is airing out, clothes line is up for my sweaty clothes, food bag and stove and extra water are here for dinner, and I am sitting on my sit pad against a tree in the sun, writing this. I did all of that ON MY OWN. I am proud of myself for what I’ve accomplished and I’ll take the “soap opera” drama over 2000 depressing miles of loneliness, monotony, and pain. I’m an extrovert and I enjoy people and crave social interaction. Yes I like space to myself, but not for 2000 miles. To each their own. Hike your own damn hike. End to the rant. 


I’m writing this a day later, but yesterday I left Damascus. The vortex sucked me in for four zeros, but today it was time to leave. I actually didn’t want to. I still wanted another zero. My zeros are never relaxing enough. I still spent so much of yesterday blogging and organizing that I didn’t just veg out and do nothing. I woke up today with still more to do. I needed to send a box home and I didn’t get to it on Saturday with all the other things I was doing, so I sent it today. I also got so much free gear and such that I wasn’t ready to send it all back on Saturday anyway. First I headed down to breakfast in the hotel. I love continental breakfast, but this wasn’t that great. I had a muffin and orange juice and cereal. I went back up to my room and organized all the stuff I had. It felt overwhelming, but I knew some of it was going home. I took a shower and shaved my legs and I’m just putting that here because boy that felt good. I haven’t shaved since I started the trip. I was scaring myself a bit and turning into one of those Wellesley girls that doesn’t shave because of the patriarchy. I respect their decision, but hair is hot and annoying and I personally prefer to shave. Shave your own shave?


I was frankly surprised how quickly I threw hygiene out the window on the AT, but I have actually been so happy with my body and that’s such progress for me. I’ve hated my body for the longest time and I have felt completely myself out here. Hair or no hair, I’ve really felt so good about myself. People have been so accepting out here too. We’re all a week out from our last shower, we’re all smelly, dirty, messy, hairy, etc. I just started to accept it. It was a hard adjustment. When I was at home I liked to straighten my hair and dress up. I’ve been doing that for years. My hair is ridiculously curly when I let it be itself, but I was so self-conscious I never wanted to. Now on the trail I let my hair go wild and I’ve just accepted it. I may still straighten it when I’m home because I genuinely like to change up my look and do that, but I’m happy that I can love my look natural too. I shaved frequently at home and have adjusted to not doing that. The trail is the first place I have not felt any judgment for my looks and it’s honestly pretty damn refreshing. I hope I can adjust back after it’s over. 


Anyway, I shaved and my legs were so smooth and it was amazing. It took so long because the hair was so long, but it was worth it. I finished packing up everything and asked if I could leave it downstairs while I mailed my package. They said I could leave it in the conference room, and there was another hiker’s bag there, so I felt safe putting it there. I went to the post office, which was right next door. I mailed two boxes worth of stuff home. Presents mom! You’re welcome for my smelly boots! Haha. I had some leftover alcohol, so I dropped that off at the Broken Fiddle because they had a hiker box. I hope someone enjoys it all. 


I went into the Outfitter to consider my pack situation. They had no Gregory packs, but after discussing it with them, we all agreed that if I couldn’t get the weight down inside the pack, it made no difference to get a smaller pack, because the smaller pack wouldn’t handle the weight inside. I am still working on the whole pack process, but my Gregory Deva has a lot of perks and holds my weight, so even though it can be a poop sometimes and the straps loosen and it’s a heavy pack on its own, it’s worked well for me so far. I remember getting this pack and walking around REI for four hours while I shopped for other things and it just felt like home. I actually hugged the pack when the REI employee handed it to me. It felt right. I’m stuffing it to the gills and it’s handling that. I may have to switch someday on this journey, but for now it’s okay. I am getting some other things from REI, but holding onto the pack. 


I bought this one shirt from the Outfitter that I spotted the other day, and it says “two roads diverged in a wood, and I took the one with the white blazes, and that has made all the difference.” The original is one of my favorite poems, and I loved this play on it. Unfortunately I couldn’t send it home since I already sent the boxes, but I’d hold onto it until I needed to send something else home. I went to Dollar General for sunscreen for my dumb lobster self and batteries for my headlamp. My headlamp made it this far and is just now starting to dim, so that’s pretty impressive to me. 


I walked back to the hotel to organize my food bag and pack, and called my mom to discuss plans for REI stuff at home and her next visit in Harper’s Ferry. It took me a while to organize and I was not looking forward to leaving. I didn’t get a lot of sleep last night and wanted to run back up to the hotel room and sleep all day forever. But I got going and headed out. It was all uphill of course heading back on trail. There was another option on the Creeper Trail, which is actually quite beautiful and runs along the water; it would’ve been an awesome bike ride. But I’m a bit of a purist and the Creeper Trail is 17 miles that isn’t on the AT. To each their own, but I didn’t want to do that. It’s also easier to go on that trail because it’s all flat, and the AT is all uphill, so I’d again be skipping the hard stuff if I did that. I stuck with my decision and went on the AT. I knew I wasn’t going far and it was pretty late, so I hiked a few miles out to a campsite by the water. There were 20 or so tents there. I had debated some other little stealth camp spots, but this was perfect. 


Today I downloaded Guthook. Someone told me there was a Trail Days discount and I just went for it. I had enjoyed it when Prometheus would look up where we were and 25-mile had it too, so I started to get used to knowing my exact location all the time. Because it was cheaper, I went for it. And today was my first day using it! I have mixed feelings so far. I don’t like how the elevation looks more drastic than it is for some climbs, or doesn’t look bad at all for others. I almost miss having the elevation in AWOL, as Guthook is hard for me to gauge and I am more nit-picky. I’ve found that I rely almost too much on it now to tell me location and elevation. It’s probably because it’s new and exciting. I also don’t like that it shows a million campsites on there, but most are stealth campsites. It was my first day back out and I wanted to find people, so I kept looking forward to the campsites I was seeing in Guthook, but most of them were tiny spots on the side of the trail and no one was there. Overall I liked playing around with the app today. I like knowing my location, but I don’t want to get too carried away with checking constantly. 


I used the app to find a campsite that had 20+ tent pads, so I figured people must be there. It was 6 miles out of town, but after four zeros and a heavy pack, I was pretty done when I reached there. I passed plenty of stealth camp spots and debated spending my first night alone on the trail, but I pushed on. There was a shelter not too far from the campsite, so I could’ve pushed on if I was that desperate for people. Omg Little Debbie wants connections and social interaction, what?! 


It was very late in the day when I started, but I arrived with time to get set up in daylight. The Creeper Trail was right next to the campsite and there was a nice bridge over the water. Apparently you could go to a little beach nearby on the Creeper Trail and swim. I didn’t find it after exploring a bit. I set up my tent next to a guy named Data. He had the same hat as Prometheus and it made me sad. I had extra food hanging from my bag today because I bought Doritos in town, so I put all my food and my stove by the fire and put the rest of my stuff in my tent. I was very thirsty and got water and drank a whole liter right after filtering it. I had to go get more after. The flow wasn’t great even though there was a lot of water, so this girl helped me channel it from a rock into my bag. Her name was Monster Mash and I’ve seen her before; I think at Boots Off. I went to hang my bear line next. Honestly I was very proud of the job I did! I found a great tree leaning over some rocks by the water. There was a hole in the rocks and it made me think of the Swiss Family Robinson and I was picturing a bear trying to grab my bag and falling into the hole in the rocks. I successfully threw my rock bag over and left the line up to go eat my food. 


I sat with Data, Monster Mash, and a few other folks I’m forgetting the names of. One of them had a clear plastic ukulele, which was probably the lightest instrument I’ve ever seen, and he was just strumming along by the fire. It was nice to chat with them all and it was a good way to spend my first night back on trail. I didn’t do heavy mileage today, but at least I left Damascus and got back on trail! I was a little stressed because I had no service at the campsite, and my friend Rachel is coming by tomorrow with her boyfriend. They’re road-tripping home from Kansas. She’s out there for grad school and has her car with her, but she wants her car in CT for the summer. They planned an awesome road trip and were able to fit in a stop for me!! I originally planned on meeting them at Whitetop Mountain, but I knew I couldn’t make that mileage early in the day and I didn’t go very far today, so I was anxious about where to meet them. Guthook was pretty helpful actually and it showed me a road I could stop at that was not too far from Damascus by car, and we could go in for lunch. I was looking forward to getting service tomorrow so I could make sure that plan worked. 


I was pleased with the amount of food I ate tonight. I think I’m finally getting that hiker hunger! I wouldn’t say I dive into my food bag like some other folks I’ve met, but I’m finishing my Mountain Houses now and snacking as well. I hope the food will help me get stronger as I hike. My bag was heavy, as it always is leaving town, and it was extra heavy because I hadn’t had my mountain houses or oatmeal for several days in Damascus and then had a whole new box of both. I knew I had enough dinners and breakfasts to last me a week. I hung my bag and was doing well. I had to step back far to pull the line, but I was successful. Data came to check on me and that was very sweet of him. It was one of the first times I refused help. I was so proud of my bear bag hang! I stood in the hole in the rocks and reached up and it was high above me. I felt really good. I’m alone again now, but being able to succeed at something I’ve struggled with for so long made me so happy. I headed to bed and slept well, with the sound of the water in the background.

",Random Campsite ,"May 20, Mon",6.90
Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617225,"Today I woke up at a reasonable time; there were still five or six tents up. Some people were gone, and Data was all packed up when I walked out of my tent. I got going quickly because I wanted to get service and meet Rach! I went to the bathroom pretty close off the trail, oops! I thought I had walked so far, but I could see everyone. We’re doing the wave and squat this morning I guess! Nothing to see here! Haha. I packed up and headed on. It was all uphill to the shelter I had considered last night. The shelter was off trail, so I didn’t go to it. I did get service after doing some of the uphill, so I called Rach and we were set for Beartree Gap. We planned on arriving at the same time, but I was moving a bit slowly. At least we had a plan! 


I listened to some podcasts this morning. I’ve had some great recommendations from friends back home, and I was listening to some from This American Life and The Moth. When I had people to hike with, I wasn’t really listening to anything, but now that I was on my own, music wouldn’t cut it anymore. I love these podcasts. Honestly it made a world of difference to listen to them. I was chuckling along to a podcast about being fat, something I’ve believed I am for a long time. It was very entertaining and uplifting and the time just flew by. I listened to a sad podcast about loss too. Both captured my attention and I was happy to have some mental stimulation being on my own again. 


I came to Beartree Gap and the trail to the road was .3. I was late and I felt horrible, but I knew I couldn’t have hiked much faster. I could’ve gotten up earlier. In the end it all worked out! Rach and JP were there! I was so excited to see them!! JP got out his phone to video me walking out of the woods and Rach was laughing because they had clearly planned to get the video of me and now they had to execute the plan. I was covered in sweat, but I hugged them both and was so elated. Rach has been my bestie since high school; I love her to pieces. Her boyfriend JP is amazing and such a joy to be around. They both make me so happy! They told me Damascus was 15 minutes away, which made me want to cry considering I had done two days of hiking out of Damascus and it was 15 minutes by car. 


We headed into town for lunch. We decided to go to the Wicked Chicken. I joked with them that I was a local now because I spent so long in Damascus, walking up and down the main drive too many times to count. But I had not been to this place yet. It was delicious! I got boneless (of course) wings and curly fries and a soda. I told them they’re my fave couple to third wheel. Haha they’re both my buddies and I know I’m not a third wheel, but it was kinda funny because they shared everything they ordered, and I’m sitting here with wings and fries all to myself. Hey, it pays to be single. I get all the food! My lovely friends paid for my lunch. I had no idea they were planning on that and I had gotten my wallet out to pay. It was such a treat and I’m so thankful. Trail magic and a hitch from my buddies! 



They supposedly had great ice cream here, but Trail Days totally wiped them clean. They had 4 out of 22 flavors left, and they were all some version of vanilla. Yeah no. We needed to get going anyway though. Rach and JP were going to meet her cousins on the opposite end of Virginia. I laughed because it would take them five hours, and for me more like five weeks. I took advantage of the service though and charged my phone throughout lunch, and that’s when I saw the blog comment that made me angry. I figured it would’ve been better to have no service at that point, but I was updated and charged up and we headed out. They dropped me back off at Beartree Gap. It was such a nice visit and the best treat after hiking alone out of Damascus. By the way, my buddies Wobbles and Thunder Buddy had gone ahead one of the days in Damascus, so they were already 10 miles out. It wouldn’t have been too hard to catch them, but with my Nero and just feeling sluggish, I didn’t. I was okay with that and knew they wouldn’t be too far ahead.I gave Rach my shirt that I couldn’t send in my boxes home. It occurred to me that I could hop in their car and make my way all the way to CT in a few days. Ahh so tempting. But I was here and wanted to be here. Slowest way to go home, but I’ll get there eventually! They had a fun day planned in Hershey and I was excited for them. We said goodbye and I walked back into the woods! 


I decided I’d go five more miles or so to the next shelter. I put in another podcast about women and speaking up, which was nice. I passed by more of the Creeper Trail. It really was pretty and I was kicking myself for not blue-blazing to have that nice walk along the water. But I guess my purist ways will continue for now! The AT was quite boring today. It had a fair amount of uphill, but it was just the same up and down in the woods. Yesterday I had passed by some water and nice bridges and today I passed those as well, but otherwise it was all pretty boring. I got to the shelter in good time. I found a really flat spot for my tent and claimed it. 



There were a ton of people there. I was thinking I had missed the bubble, so I was confused. But it turned out to be a philosophy class and they were out here section hiking for a week or so. I thought it was a cult haha because some man was preaching over the campfire, but now it made sense. That would be a cool class to take! Everyone else was section hiking or thru-hiking. I wasn’t feeling particularly social because I wanted some space to process and that’s when I wrote about yesterday and the comment. I was sitting on my sit pad against the tree. And I had indeed gone and hung my bear bag line (my best hang yet) and hung a clothes line for my sweaty clothes and gotten water. I felt good and independent and strong. I saw Mama’s Boy! His name is now Danran. He was super friendly. I also met a thru-hiker named Strider and two section hikers, as well as a man named Rover, who got his name from singing a song about a dog named Rover.I was having trouble finishing my Mountain House tonight, so I sat with them for a while and slowly ate it. I finally went to bed. The class was up late and a bit rowdy, but I didn’t mind too much and fell asleep. I had a fair amount of bug bites and I didn’t realize how many until I woke up itching. It was uncomfortable, but I eventually fell back asleep.

",Lost Mountain Shelter,"May 21, Tue",9.10
Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617226,"I woke up at a reasonable time today too, but everyone was gone. It was completely deserted. Lol bye! I know I’ve talked about my schedule a million times and how I sleep late and get to camp late, yadda yadda, but I’ve been trying to fix that for weeks, so after a certain point I’m beginning to accept my late starts. I don’t like it, but I’m just so tired in the morning. I wake up feeling like a zombie. My body doesn’t want to move and I just feel bleh. I’m sure coffee would help, but I don’t want to get back on coffee. It’s annoying. I feel like I can never get enough rest for what I’m doing to my body. I think I’d have to go to bed at 8, but if I woke up itching and couldn’t sleep even going to bed later, I certainly wouldn’t have stayed asleep going to bed at 8. I know my schedule can be entirely my own on the trail and I don’t have to get up at 6:30 to do this trail. But with the heat and bugs getting worse and worse, earlier in the morning is better. We’ll see if I can turn around my schedule. I just wanna sleep forever. Ugh! 


I went to get my bear bag and took a picture. I was really quite proud. It was my best bear bag hang by far. There was a privy, so that was a nice bonus. Someone had written the entire Lorax book on the walls of the privy. I speak for the poop? I ate breakfast and ate slow, but managed to eat a fair amount. I headed out and knew I was starting the day with a climb. Yay! I was finally at Whitetop, one of the tallest mountains in Virginia. The climb wasn’t too bad. It was gradual and I listened to more podcasts and some music too. I listened to a podcast about a woman moving across the world and being excited by a childhood toy after leaving a communist government. I arrived in a nice meadow with a wonderful view and then the trail headed back into the woods. It came back out to another meadow and I passed a little water spring, and then arrived at the road. I decided to take a break here and went and got some water from the spring. 


I moved on and saw a campsite. The philosophy class was there and they were cooking ramps, which are essentially natural onions and garlic put together. Hot Sauce had showed me them before and they smell really good. I wanted some garlicky onions, yum! They offered them to me, but I passed because I was already on my way. I had another climb to make too. The trail had both the highest peaks in Virginia together on the same day, so now I had to climb Mt. Rogers. I was tired, but still had stamina to keep going. There was a shelter at the top and a campsite a little further. I wasn’t sure what I was doing yet, but figured I’d see how I felt when I got up there. The trail passed through a road and a parking lot and I was excited because it had a trash can and a toilet!! I had my trash accessible, which normally isn’t the case for me. It’s usually buried in my food bag, but for some reason today I had kept it out. It paid off!! The hill that you could see from the parking lot was covered in pretty yellow flowers. I was excited for the scenery I was going to see in the next few days, as I was about to enter the Grayson Highlands! 


It was a nice climb up Mt. Rogers. It was a bit stormy and I was afraid it would rain, but it didn’t. There was a small view with some pine trees that was pretty, and then I ran into Danran! He was surprised we hadn’t seen any ponies yet. I headed on and out into an open bald and there they were!! The ponies! They were a good distance away, but I was so excited to see them! Danran caught up and we took pictures. And then the ponies came up to us!! I had been told about this, but wasn’t sure if they actually did like humans. The ponies seemed to be totally fine with both of us. They were licking our legs (nice and salty I’m sure) and following us around. I was a little nervous because I’m not very familiar with horses at all and they were licking me and I was just a bit nervous haha. Danran was nervous because there was a baby sitting in the grass, but we didn’t know where the mother was. 


We hiked on past the ponies. They followed for a bit, but then retreated. We arrived at the shelter and I was so excited by what I had just seen. I was in great spirits. I saw the same two section hikers from the last shelter, and I also saw Snowflake and her dog, D’Artagnan. Salamander was there too! She had two friends along with her, Peetree and Bananas. They were just section hiking for a bit with her. I laughed at Peetree’s name because my sister used to call my old boyfriend that. Petri and Petrismo lol it was pretty funny. Gotta love nicknames! The section hikers went upstairs and I claimed a spot up there too. I was debating going on, but this seemed like a nice crowd and fun place to be, and I was unsure of the weather situation. 


Salamander and her friends were lovely and we sat eating dinner. They gave me some Mexican hot cocoa, which was delicious. And then we had some visitors! The freaking ponies came right up to the shelter! They were eating everything in site, even the water bags on the table. We had to pull the bags out of their mouths like they were dogs. They were licking everyone and we soon had 20 ponies around the shelter. It was honestly kind of awesome. I was scrambling to move my stuff and that wasn’t so awesome because I had to move all my food inside the shelter and eat in there, but still. I mean how many times do you have dinner on a mountaintop with ponies? They licked my legs a bit, but also bit, so I was not a huge fan of that. They were licking everyone. We all have that lovely salt I guess! Yum! 


As amazing as it was to host our dinner guests, it was time for everyone to go home. One of the section hikers used a red bandana to gently swat at the ponies and they all slowly left. We named him Matador haha. We were getting ready for bed and a man and his son showed up. They were kind of disrespectful. They were also section hikers. The son threw all their stuff upstairs and spread it all out over my stuff and I was irritated. It felt cramped up there now. The son and his father ate Mountain Houses, which I later discovered in the privy. Really? You can’t pack out your trash? You’re here for literally a week! I’ve seen thru-hikers picking up trash that isn’t even theirs and carrying it for miles, even with their heavy bags, and you can’t carry it for a week? 



The privy was pretty sweet though. None of us had realized there was one, until Peetree yelled out. It was so funny because moments earlier, Snowflake had told everyone to go see the sunset down by the water source, and one man walked over, but when Peetree announced that there was a privy, the entire group of people at the shelter walked down to see the privy. Hiker priorities? Pooporities? Shouldn’t have told the man and his son about the privy; it’s not a trash!
I was excited that this shelter had a bear box!! Ahh! I missed you, sweet bear box! You beautiful, smart invention, you! I could’ve hugged it. I met two guys who were sitting by the box at a fire ring. There was a gorgeous view nearby. We chatted for a bit and they were my age, just out for a section hike. The box was fairly new because there had been bear problems at this shelter this year. The Grayson Highlands in general have had bear problems because they’re so touristy. I’ve actually heard some crazy bear stories lately. I had already heard about Salamander’s ursack, but I have some more for y’all. Apparently a mama bear and her cub tag-teamed and the cub climbed out onto the branch and cut the rope and the mama bear caught the food bag. And people say bears aren’t smart. Um! They’re clearly aware of how to get people’s food now and corrupting their own youth! I heard several stories like that and that’s why they put the bear box here. Everyone had hung their bags properly and followed the rules and the bears still got the food. I have to admit, the cub and mama bear story is kinda cute. And the cubs are so little and furry and fluffy and squishy, but yeah I know, I wouldn’t want to deal with those bears if they were hungry or protective. It is interesting though, a lot of these bears don’t seem to give a crap about the yelling humans trying to get them to leave. “What human? Stop screaming, I’m in the middle of something!” Lol that’s essentially what happens. The massive raccoons have outsmarted us. (PUT BEAR BOXES AT EVERY SHELTER) what? Sorry I didn’t say anything. 


I was further annoyed by the man and the son because the man snored. It was like we had a pony upstairs. It was so unbelievably loud. I know I’ve discussed my feelings about the snoring situation in shelters and I get that I might have to deal with it in shelters, but I was literally minutes from bed when this man came in and I would’ve gotten a perfect night’s sleep without his roaring. Ugh. I barely slept. I put in my headphones and debated setting my tent up it was so bad. I put up with it and eventually fell asleep. Other than that, the day was so wonderful. The scenery was beautiful, I climbed two tall mountains, I ate dinner with ponies, and I got to use a bear box. A great day on trail in the books!

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617228,"The ponies joined us all again for breakfast, interesting how they come around during feeding time. Haha. But this morning the horses were a bit... excited? Maybe I really do need coffee, but my eyes were woken up with another sight today. Let’s just say I know why the phrase “hung like a horse” exists now. Well the well-endowed fellow and a female pony had an encounter in front of us all. Nothing like some pony sex to start the morning off? Apparently it happened twice and I missed the first time. The ponies really get going early I guess! What a morning haha. Snowflake was teasing me because my jaw-drop was noticeable. I’m sorry, okay, this isn’t something you see every day. It was like a bad car accident. I didn’t want to see it and yet I couldn’t look away. Oh man.We shooed the ponies away and they slowly wandered off, tired I imagine from their morning... activities. I got packed up and out a bit late, but this morning it was purely because I was focused on... something else. I was awake with everyone else, but delayed by my young curiosity? I finally headed out a little bit before Snowflake. D’Artagnan followed me for a bit and it was really awesome actually. It felt like I had my own dog and was taking him with me on my hike! A couple saw me and asked me questions about him and I was like “oh he’s not my dog”, but the whole time I was wishing he was my dog! I want a dog. Ugh! He joined his mama and I carried on. And soon enough I reached... 500 MILES!! Omg! It was so exciting. It felt so good. Better than any hundred before this! 500! It was exhilarating. Snowflake took my picture. There was that same group of guys with the drugs and the music sitting there. I headed out, but went the wrong way. There was another trail that intersected with the AT. I realized quickly and turned around. They were all happy I made that mistake because they would’ve gone down that way too. 


I followed the right trail and it was pretty rocky. People have said that Virginia is “flat” and you can pump out more miles. This is false. We need to have a chat. Virginia is not flat, nor is Mother Earth. You’re entitled to your theories, but um no. Virginia is rocky and hilly and steep. My shoes were 30 miles old at this point and they already had the front rubber part coming off. Wonderful. Thank you, rocks! Despite the rocks, this part of the trail was amazing. It was the official entrance to the Grayson Highlands and it was stunning. Talk about jaw-drop. I was literally smiling from ear to ear all day. There were more ponies grazing throughout the entire morning, and a bunch of families and tourists taking pictures. This one little girl gave me the most judgmental look. Start em young, I tell ya. Kid, I may look like poop, but you’ll understand someday why I’m doing this. What a rush today was. 


I passed through the “Fat-man Squeeze”, a small slit in the rocks. My pack scraped the sides, but I got through! Lol another goofy name of a trail site. I stopped on a bench with Snowflake and the music dudes. They were all going to go to a general store from Massie Gap to get lunch and resupply. I considered it, but I wanted to press on. I had plenty of food. The only issue actually was my phone. I stupidly forgot to charge my external battery until the day I left Damascus. It needs an overnight charge and it only got a few hours. It did not have much juice at all, and it had been a few days so my phone had none either. I debated the general store simply as a place to charge up, but I knew that would take a while and I would pretty much be done for the day. I figured I’d have to use my phone sparingly. It was hard because everything was so wonderful and I wanted to post it all and share this beauty. I had had no service at the shelter last night so I was trying to post things from last night, but my battery was running out. 


I decided to push on despite the battery situation. Once the trail left the Highlands, it was boring again. It was a really rocky downhill. There was a shelter at the bottom and I stopped for a break. I ate lunch and met a girl named Cali. She had gotten off trail for a month to do some traveling with her family and other things, and now she was back. She had skipped the section from Gatlinburg to here so she could catch up to her friends. I wouldn’t want to do that section again haha. But I’m sure she’ll make it up and I’m glad she’s back on trail. She’s very friendly and we had a nice chat. She was going to push on to the shelter and I was planning on that too. 



The next section of the trail was all in a meadow. It was beautiful, but so hot. It felt like walking through a desert. I was getting overheated quickly. I tried to walk through it faster to get to the shade, but it was a long stretch through this exposed area. I was completely wiped. I arrived at a place called the Scales. And I saw what looked like a bathroom! And it was!! I put my pack down and took my trash out and threw it away, refilled my hand sanitizer, and went to the bathroom. I put on sunscreen because I was planning to go on and I had been baking in the sun. I had a snack and moved down the field to a shady area under the sign, where I saw Raisin the doggo and her owners, Tugs and Tank Top. I sat for a minute because I really did still feel wiped. I think I need to adjust to this heat and exercising like I am, in it. I ran a half marathon a few years back and the heat was killer and there was no shade. It totally wiped me then too. I had not gone that far today, but I was still exhausted. And I had slept terribly so I think that contributed. Sometimes we need to listen to our bodies and know when to stop, and on the trail I find I don’t listen enough. Doggo Raisin and her owners carried on.
Salamander and her section hiker buddies arrived! They were going to camp here in the field and I started to get tempted to stay. Cali came along and sat for a bit, eventually heading on to the shelter. We watched some cows and ponies moving around outside the fence of the meadow. I pulled a “fish” and said I was staying. It was a nice open meadow and would have a beautiful sunset and stars, there was a bathroom and a trash, I was wiped, and Salamander and her crew were pretty awesome. They put up their tents and I did too. We went to find the water source. It was a small pipe in the ground. There was a lot of cow and horse poop everywhere, so were were a little suspicious about the water, but the pipe seemed to run from a good distance away. It was slow, so Peetree and Bananas filled up and Salamander and I went exploring. The area looked a lot like a beach, with sand and brush, and it reminded me of Nantucket, where I used to go with my family every summer. I’m not a huge beach fan, but the island still has a special meaning for me. I had a great Diana moment. I heard this sound that was like rushing water and excitedly said “wait, I think I hear water”. We looked over and it was a cow pissing quite the river of pee. We cracked up. Not quite the water source we’d want! Haha. 


We went back and got water from the real source. We headed back to our tents and it was about time to make dinner. We saw two cars pull in. One parked on the field and set up a big tent, and the other parked across the field. There was a doggo in the back of that truck and we all got excited. The owner walked over and he was looking for a spot to place his hammock. There were not many trees here and he said he had forgotten his tent, but brought his hammock, so he ended up parking next to a small tree in a corner of the field and tying his hammock from the tree to his car. He brought us over some beers and was super nice. He said he was driving along the Appalachian Trail, but wasn’t a huge fan of camping anymore because he was a Veteran and had had some traumatic memories. I honestly think his way of camping is still cool. I would love to drive my car up someday and camp out. As most of you know, I wasn’t really a backpacker before this anyway. I had done three biking trips with Overland, one in Vermont, one in Nova Scotia, and one in Europe. All of them involved camping at night and carrying your stuff on the back of your bike, including tent. So I had experience with being out here, but I didn’t really backpack. My family and I day-hiked and I still like that. You can enjoy a beautiful hike and stay in a cozy bed the same night. Who knows what I’ll do when I get back! I can adjust to this lifestyle and really have accepted being filthy and smelly and tired, I think it just takes some adjusting. This guy seemed to have a nice set-up that worked for him! 



The beers were cold and refreshing. He brought two and I asked everyone how we were splitting them, meaning are we using cups or sharing the bottles, and Peetree answered in the most literal way possible and said “four people, two beers, we each get half a beer”. Well duh! She realized what I meant after and we laughed and we divided the beers into our cups. This amazing man came back and brought wine with solo cups!! AND THE DOG. Her name was Maya and she was a beautiful golden retriever. He had just given her a haircut for the summer, which I hadn’t even thought about with goldens. Pretty much everyone in my town has one and I’ll be honest, I totally want one. They’re such friendly and loving dogs and they’re so fluffy and playful. I know a ton of other breeds are too and I’ll keep my options open, but a big fluffy friendly dog is probably what I’ll end up with. But I rarely see goldens shaved like that. It makes total sense since they shed so much. Maya was only a year old and she was running about like crazy. She’d run over to me, then to Salamander, then to Peetree, and back around. She would come right up and put her paws on your shoulders or your arms and lick you and then run away. I was in heaven.
Maya went for my food and picked up something chocolate, so I immediately told her owner and he removed it from her mouth. Phew. That will be the hardest part of owning a dog for me someday haha. I need both chocolate and the dog in my house, both are priorities. But I’ll have to make sure to keep them far apart!! I really did think about how much I want a dog while I was sitting there. I’ve been asking my parents since I was young. They’re concerns were reasonable: dogs are a ton of work, they shed, you have to train them, someone has to be around to feed and walk them, vacations are hard, they’re expensive, they have to go to the vet and will eat things they shouldn’t or break things, the list goes on. But the maintenance is so worth it to me to have one. And especially now, when companionship is something I’m craving, I want a dog so badly. I’m 22 and can make that decision for myself now, but I’m still going to live at home for a bit to make up all the money I’m blowing on this trip haha and that means my parents’ house, their rules. But secretly I know they both would love a dog, they just don’t want to maintain it. I’ve made PowerPoint presentations to them on this in the past, but I really would devote myself to it. All you friends of my parents, ease the dog topic into conversation every time you see them! K thanks! Haha. My mom told me “you should have a dog”. Well woman I’m getting one! 


Anyway, dog talk aside, we had a really nice time having dinner and drinks and meeting Maya. Peetree has this amazing camp chair that is two foam pads with straps in between. You can tighten or loosen the straps and lean back in it. It’s so great and I sat in it and laid all the way back with my feet in the air. I talked about how happy I was to have met that man and his dog and how wonderful his trail magic was. Salamander said “this field is magic.” It really was a beautiful place to camp and I was having such a nice time with them all. And we had the luxury of a toilet and trash too. I was talking about how much I love privies at a shelter because I don’t like the whole process of going to dig a hole and Salamander said “privies are a privilege” and I appreciated her pun. She’s funny and down to earth and I really get along well with her. When Peetree and Bananas were at their tent, she asked me if we could hike together, as we had the same pace and mileage. I was totally down and said absolutely! But the only issue was that her friends were doing low mileage with her since they were visiting, and they had two more days, so I would have to slow down to stay with them, or she’d have to speed up to catch me after they left. I was anxious about slowing down because I’ve needed to pick up my mileage for a while and it’s been stressing me out. But she said she’d catch up and we’d figure it out, so I was excited!! Peetree came back over with her LED lamp that changed colors and we chatted for a bit longer. She has all these awesome accessories like the chair and the lamp that you could only bring if you weren’t thru-hiking, so I go back to those thoughts of section-hiking or day-hiking and being able to make camping fun and luxurious. I would really enjoy that after this trip. I’m so concerned about weight and whatnot that I just have the essentials. Which is good for this, but I do love those fun additions. 



The stars had come out and it was gorgeous. I think they were better than Max Patch. The whole sky was totally covered and it was amazing. I stared at them for a while and took it all in. These are the nights on the AT that I wanted to have. Sometimes I feel like this trip is just a “race to Maine” and I don’t get why you should stress so much. I do get that people have things at home to get back for and that Katahdin actually does close in October, so you can’t just do 8 miles all the way to Katahdin, but you can take a few nights like these and just enjoy the beauty and the peace of nature and life together. I come back to what I said a few days ago about loneliness and enjoying the trail with companionship, and it doesn’t mean I need people every day, but it is nice to have these times. This trail would be so unbelievably hard for me if I was on my own every day, just cranking out miles. It isn’t a “race to Maine”. The trail founders never intended for that. I read a book called “Grandma Gatewood’s Walk”, gifted to me by some lovely friends at home, and it was such a good book. And they said how the trail was actually meant to be section-hiked, not all at once. It was meant for people to come and enjoy the beauty for a little bit at a time, not race through it. But hike your own hike I guess, a phrase I’ll get sick of hearing, but one that is certainly said all the time out here. Here’s to enjoying the beauty of this beautiful country and footpath that was created for that. Tonight was magical.Little Debbie","Thomas Knob Shelter
",The Scales,"May 23, Thu",8.40
Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617230,"Today I was feeling good and motivated. I decided I was going to do some big mileage. And once that was in my head, there was really no way around it. I decided to go 17 miles to a shelter. Salamander, Peetree, and Bananas headed out before me, but I wasn’t too far behind. It looked like it was going to rain and there were fast-moving clouds coming in. I really wanted to make it to a shelter if it rained, and there was one in 3 miles, 7 miles, or 17, so I kept with the plan. The morning actually wasn’t too bad. There was some climbing, but then it flattened out by some water sources. I passed by Cali at the second shelter and pushed on. There was a bit of a climb up to some waterfalls, and that was a bit steep. I stopped before and ate lunch. I actually ate well and it was great! There were a few guys that I passed that did not look happy. It was certainly a hot day. A fly flew down my shirt and died on my back. Yuck. I’m killing flies here just with my filth, slightly concerning. Haha. 



The falls were pretty average. There was a sign on the short footbridge across them that said it was not safe to cross, and I had seen that in Guthook too. But the bridge looked totally fine to me and the Guthook comments said people had crossed it despite the sign. It was also probably 5 feet above the water, so worst case scenario it would not be a bad fall. The only way around was a 1.3 mile detour, so I went for it and crossed it. It was completely fine. I imagine a big group must have crossed it and that’s why they deemed it unsafe, but for one person, it really was fine. The portion afterwards was not bad, but I kept getting covered in cobwebs again. This happens daily and it’s actually so frustrating. I’ve heard people joke and say you have to let other people go out early in the morning so they can clear all the cobwebs. Prometheus once joked that you should hold your hiking poles in front of you and wave them up and down the whole time to clear the webs. Haha. Sometimes that’s tempting! I reached a road and parking lot and that would be the pickup spot to go to Troutdale, VA. But I didn’t need to resupply, so I stopped for a minute and then carried on. I had 4 miles to the shelter and I was tired, but ready to get there.
It started uphill and I ran into town day-hikers with their dogs. Eventually it went down a bit to the shelter. I was listening to a podcast about dogs today and how owners don’t clean up after them and I remember this funny line “humans can no longer run around pooping freely in the wilderness”. And I laughed to myself and was thinking, well I guess AT hikers are an exception, but I do poop pretty freely in the wilderness. Haha. I arrived at a sign for the shelter. It was off trail, but I wasn’t sure how far. I walked down to it and saw a few tents set up before I got down there. I was so excited when I arrived because Caboose was there!! Her daughter joined her on the trail for a month and was there too, and they were both so nice. Caboose is the woman from Sweden. I met her for the first time all the way back on Blood Mountain, but have seen her a few more times since then. There was another guy named Super, short for Superintendent and another named Tsalagi, which is Cherokee. 


It was so buggy and unpleasant at the campsite. I went to get water and the bugs were just going nuts. I could see the mosquitoes just going from one part of my body to the other. I was so drained from the day and annoyed. When I got back from the water, Tsalagi gave me Deet. Now I know the risks of Deet, I’ve heard many things about it. But it was unbearable to have that many bugs. I felt like I was being eaten alive. I used the Deet and could smell the strong chemicals that I was putting on my body, but it was worth it. It worked. The bugs stopped bothering me. I didn’t bring any bug spray on trail because honestly it has never worked for me. I’ll cover myself in Off or others and the bugs still bite, and that’s when I’m sitting at home in the summer. So if it doesn’t work there, it’s not going to work out here, where I’m moving all day and sweating it off. But I realized tonight that I may need to buy something or I’m going to go insane from the bugs. 


I set up my tent and went over to have dinner. A couple came in, Marathon and a guy who’s name isn’t coming to me. They seemed like those intense hikers that do 20 a day and they didn’t even cook food. The guy just cold-soaked something. They were very nice, but made me feel intimidated and a little inferior. Super and I were having a funny conversation though. And Cali showed up and joined in. We had a nice time and then I headed down to go to bed, but I still needed to finish my Mountain House. It was a new one, and it was a Mexican rice one, but it was a lot like chili and I don’t do chili, so I was preparing to bury it, but Tsalagi had made a fire, so I put it there. I know, not the best practices. But it’s not the worst. The fire was really hot and burned the food right away, and bears hate fire, so they’re not coming anywhere near. I’m very conscious about my trace in the woods, but tonight I just allowed the natural source of fire to take care of this. Tsalagi is very cool. He’s a bit rough around the edges, but you can tell he’s a good soul and would protect anyone from harm. But because he’s a bit rough, he was joking that he was going to put honey on Super’s tent to attract bears. Super and I have not seen a bear on trail yet. It seems to shock everyone that we haven’t, but I’m just fine with not seeing one haha. I think it has something to do with listening to music or podcasts and not hearing bears because sometimes people see them and they’re 100 yards down a hill. So I’ve probably passed by them, but haven’t seen one. With the food bag stories I’ve heard, I really would rather not. 


Tsalagi and I talked a lot about nature and earth and our impact on it. He had a wonderful quote that I love “cover the earth with our footsteps before it covers us”. And that’s what I’m doing! Trying to cover as much of this earth as I can see and really take it in and appreciate it. But sometimes it still feels so small. Only 2,000 of the east coast is just a sliver of America. It’s so vast. But I’m still covering a nice portion of earth and trying to minimize my impact by being out here on foot. We also talked about politics a bit and societal issues. We discussed the image that women feel they have to have, and it was so nice to open up to him about it. For a long time I’ve struggled with that image and it’s been refreshing to be entirely myself out here. Tsalagi told me I’m a beautiful woman. I guess I don’t really view myself as beautiful. I could pick out a million flaws about my appearance before I pick out good things. I have huge thighs, my smile is crooked from the tooth-surgery I had in high school, I have frizzy curly hair when it’s natural, I have pale, freckled skin, I have man-feet, the list goes on. I appreciated his comment, but it really was hard to really hear that. My mom can say I’m beautiful, but she’s my mom. And friends can say it, but what really makes me beautiful? What makes anyone beautiful? It made me think a lot about image and soul and just being me. I really love these deep conversations I get to have with people I meet out here. It’s so real and genuine and powerful. I’m sure I’ll conform back to society and it’s ridiculous standards when I return, but for now I feel so free and so much myself. 


Cali sat with us for a bit and then we all went to bed. Some bugs made it into my tent with me, but I’m sorry, if you enter my home bug, that’s it. I’m not sleeping with a big fly buzzing around my stuff all night. I still smelled like Deet and was itching all night, but I was so happy to have made that mileage today and had such deep conversations with other hikers. It was a good day!

",Trimpi Shelter,"May 24, Fri",16.90
Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617232,"Today was going to be a short day and I knew it ahead of time. We were 10 miles from Partnership Shelter, which is a big shelter near a road and you can have pizza delivered there!! But the road is also where you can get a hitch or a shuttle into Marion, VA. I had sent my boxes to Atkins, VA because I had enough food to get there, but I wanted some snacks to have at Partnership for the night, and had heard good things about Marion. People at the shelter also mentioned a hiker feed that was a mile away from the shelter, so with the stop for that, a short day sounded good. 


Tsalagi waited for me to pack up because he wanted to hike out with me and show me some natural fire starters, since I had been asking him about it last night. Cali was also getting going. Unfortunately, she broke her own collapsible water bottle by squeezing too hard on it, so I let her use mine, but she broke mine too. I was cool about it in the moment, but it really bothered me. Especially since she had just made that mistake with her own bottle. If I were her I’d be extra careful with someone else’s. I was also just annoyed because it’s a Platypus and it’s really only sold in Outdoor stores or online, so I wasn’t going to be able to replace it right away. She did offer to pay me, but we got separated for the day so I wasn’t sure if she would. 


Tsalagi and I headed out and he let me lead for a bit, stopping to show me a pine tree and the fire starter you can use inside it. If a pine tree is missing branches, there is a bit of goo in the holes where the branches were, and that goo is great for fires. You can pull it out and put it in a plastic bag for camp. And it won’t hurt the tree, which is great! I was very intrigued. Tsalagi and I kept hiking and got to the road with the hiker feed. It was a bit of a walk, but there was a man with a car there to take us to it. The hiker feed was in a church and it was extensive. Full BBQ, a million desserts, sodas, fresh fruit, medical supplies, toiletries, snacks, resupply, and more. These churches really go all out and it’s incredible. And they shuttled everyone to and from the trailhead. 


I saw 25-mile and Ain’t Dead Yet and Wild Violet, which was so nice!! I also met Yoshi and Eeyore. 25-Mile, Wild Violet, and Ain’t Dead Yet were going to get a ride to Partnership Shelter because they had hiked to it yesterday and then found out about the hiker feed, got a ride, and camped at the church. My slackpacker mastermind started thinking and I realized this was a great opportunity. If they could take our packs to this big shelter and store them somewhere, we could slackpack to the shelter for free. So I asked them if they could drop our packs off and they said yes and we had a plan!! I was so pumped. I knew it was a short day, but this would get me there even earlier and then I could go into Marion and get a temporary water bottle and check the town out. 



They took our packs, we ate some more, and then Tsalagi and I headed back on trail. I met a nice girl before we left who had the same pack as me!! But she was getting off trail for a week so I don’t know when I’ll see her again. Tsalagi and I got to the trail head around 12:30, which was the worst time of day to head out. And we were full of food and soda so I was in a food coma. We saw Tugs, Tank Top, and the dog Raisin at the hiker feed and they decided to slackpack with us!! I didn’t bring my water filter, which was stupid because I drank the one liter of water I brought pretty quickly. We hiked pretty quickly, but I was getting wiped with the heat. We saw a black snake and Tsalagi jumped up when he saw it. They’re not dangerous, but they’re big. I haven’t see snakes that big in my life, so it scared me, but I was glad to know they’re harmless. We met a guy named Blazer. We told him we were slackpacking and he had been at the trail magic, so we said he could’ve done it too, but he said he was a purist. I had never heard that a purist didn’t slackpack, but I guess I’m not a purist then!! We ran into Ain’t Dead Yet, who had left before the whole slackpack deal occurred, so he had his pack. He was headed to Partnership too, so I wish we had organized it all sooner!! But oh well. The last little bit of the day was a slow incline, which I don’t like, but we made it in good time. Partnership is a cool shelter. There was a whole closed off upper area, and they left our packs there. There was a visitors center nearby and we had asked them to see if they could put our packs there, but the visitors center said no. It was honestly kind of frustrating because I walked in there and they had a huge office that they could’ve stored our packs in. I guess I’m used to everyone on the trail being so accommodating, but we all have our limits.
Our packs were safe in sound in the upper portion, so we took them down to hitch into Marion. We weren’t planning on staying there, but figured our packs might get us a hitch easier. We saw Snowflake at the shelter and chatted with her for a bit. We walked across the road and held out our thumbs. Yoshi and Eeyore were there trying to get a ride too. A man pulled over into the visitors center and we all got in. He was an older man and spoke very softly. He didn’t say much. He dropped us off at Walmart and Yoshi and Eeyore went to the Econo Lodge. I bought some chips and soda to snack on at Partnership, and some little debbies. I guess I have to have them at all times with my trail name haha. I also bought a cheap collapsible water bottle as a temporary replacement. I texted my mom and she bought me a new Platypus and is mailing it to the next spot. Tsalagi and I went to China House for dinner. It was a cheap buffet, but the food wasn’t bad. It was nice to have town food! We were talking about hitching and Tsalagi was making a sign on cardboard that said “Hiker to Trail” and an old man nearby asked where we were going and said he’d take us there. It was awesome!! Again he was quiet though. Both hitches were not very talkative! But he was so nice and dropped us back off at the visitors center. We set up our tents because it was a nice night and I’ll avoid the snoring/body heat of a shelter on a nice night. I sat with Snowflake and Blazer at the fire for a while. I met a man named Mister Mom and was introducing myself, but realized I had an entire bag of little debbies on my lap. It was pretty funny and I guess I really do live up to my name. A man named Long Feather joined us. He’s from Italy!! I teased him about America’s version of pizza, referring to the Little Caesar’s in Marion. Ugh I wanna go back to Italy. I could eat so much food there right now omg. He’s super fast and hiked 30 miles today, but he was so friendly and enjoying the trail. 


I was hanging for a bit in my tent and we had an unexpected visit. Tsalagi had made a joke with his close friends on trail that he was going to burn their tents. As I said, he’s a rough guy. But he really was just harsh joking. But unfortunately, he didn’t realize that the guy who came on trail and murdered Stronghold also threatened to burn the tents before he attacked people. Someone overheard Tsalagi and reported it to the cops. I understand with the recent situation that things need to be taken seriously like that, but from my time with Tsalagi I knew he was a good guy, just rough around the edges. I think people are more sensitive in general these days and the older people who are rough around the edges are having to adjust what they say. Obviously a comment like Tsalagi’s was following a horrible incident and all of us hikers were on edge, but he really didn’t realize. I looked outside my tent to see the cops there with him. Thankfully nothing happened. I sprayed some more of the Deet on myself tonight because the bugs were oppressive again. My legs were out of my tent, but a little bit got in my tent. It came off eventually, but I was worried about damaging it. I went back to the fire and the cops were leaving. We asked them where the murder had occurred, as we were going to pass the site in a few days, and they showed us the campsite on AWOL. Cali showed up and gave me money for my water bottle, which I was very thankful for. She had also gotten me the cheap one I got myself, so now I had two of those 1L collapsible water bottles until I got my new one. I was thankful that she went to that effort to replace mine and am not upset about it anymore. 


I had a lot of fun tonight despite the cops situation and I was happy I got to go into Marion and stay with friends. Tomorrow is another short day to my hostel in Atkins, but I’m looking forward to it! Tsalagi said good night in the best way tonight. He said “good night John Boy!” And I said “good night Mary Ellen!” For those of you who know of The Walton’s, an older TV show, it was great. I appreciate being able to relate to people on things like that. I tend to like older music and older movies. Adults on trail don’t expect me to get their references with music or time periods, but I usually do. I am thankful to my nerdy parents for raising me with classic rock and The Waltons; some of the music and movies that are out these days is just so bad. But I do like some of it, so it’s a nice combo to have some of the past and some of the present. Hopefully I can still show this stuff to my kids someday. Good night all!

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617234,"Today I got out late, but I knew I was headed to my hostel, so it would be a short day. It started uphill. I ran into Caboose and her daughter on the uphill, which was awesome!! I hiked with them for a bit and then went ahead of them. There was a nice view today and then a long downhill that ended with an old schoolhouse and a museum. I ran into some people from the shelter at the school, Mad Max and Two Sticks. There was trail magic inside the schoolhouse, provided by a church!! It was great!! There were bins and bins full of medical supplies and toiletries, snacks, candy, and soda. I loaded up on some of it and hung out for a bit. Tugs and Tank Top and Raisin showed up and we took some pictures. I was laughing because the name of the school was the same name as my company back home, which is a private tutoring company. Working from the trail now? Haha. 


Caboose and her daughter showed up and said they were going to the hostel I was. We all left separately, but I found them again. We hiked through some pretty meadows and out onto train tracks again. Up the hill we could see two mansions and I actually took pictures because they were nice homes, but then realized one of those was the hostel! Wow that was a nice-looking hostel. I saw a turtle on the way there. Of course we had to go all the way around because why would the AT ever take you anywhere directly? Haha. We came out at the road and there was not much there, just a gas station and Mexican restaurant. We walked to the hostel on the road. 



This was truly the nicest hostel I’ve ever stayed at. We walked up the driveway and met a bunch of alpacas!! It was kinda funny because one peeked its neck around the barn and then they all did and came towards us. They’re funny-looking creatures haha. We took pictures and enjoyed this sweet surprise! We then came up to the house and met the owner. She was friendly and said they were headed to a dinner, but that some other folks were coming back from the store soon. We set up our tents and looked around. This place was incredible inside. It was clean and had a big, beautiful kitchen. I wish I had known sooner because I would’ve loved to get food and cook here. They had one private room that was beach-themed and then just tenting and the use of the facilities. I totally could’ve zero’d and was really tempted to. It had been a week since Damascus and I was a bit tired from all the heat and bugs. But I was telling myself it wasn’t time to zero and I should push on.The people from the store showed up. Mama’s Boy was there (he’s now Danran), Birdman, a British guy named Jukebox, and a girl named CW (for counterweight). CW already hiked the trail, but had come back for a reunion with some friends and met Jukebox. And a whirlwind romance ensued. The two of them were planning to get married and he thought he could move his job to the US. I mean to each their own, but 3 weeks of knowing each other... they did seem very happy together and on the same page, so maybe it really is meant to be. Someone told me the other day that it takes a certain kind of people to come out here and do this, so maybe if you find romance out here, it’s meant to be. Natural selection haha narrowing down the weirdos who would hike this whole trail and putting them together!! Haven’t found my future hubby yet haha but I don’t think I need someone as crazy as me. A day-hiker will do. Haha. Anyway, the British guy was debating giving up his hike to be with her and that part would not happen for me. If I’ve got my whole life with someone, I’m not going to pass up opportunities I may never get again. I hope he continues on, but again, hike your own hike. If his journey was meant to end here so he could be with her, so be it.CW is awesome and decided to do some trail magic for people at the hostel. She bought a bunch of food including fresh meat, veggies, and potatoes. Caboose, her daughter, and I wanted to check out the Mexican restaurant too, so we figured we’d do both and see how much we could eat, maybe saving some for tomorrow. The Mexican restaurant was really good and cheap, but they didn’t have any margaritas! Strike two with Mexican restaurants down here! So disappointing! We saw Tugs and Tank Top in the restaurant. They were debating the hostel, but were afraid Raisin wouldn’t do well with the other animals. We said goodbye and ate our food. The menu had a million options, which always overwhelms my indecisive self. I didn’t finish my food on purpose to save some room for the food at the hostel, but Caboose and her daughter ate a lot of their’s. Caboose said it was Mother’s Day in Sweden so she was happy to have had this dinner with her daughter and I felt a little awkward. We had all talked about going to the restaurant so I never felt like I was intruding, but now I felt a bit like the odd one out. Third-wheeling for life folks! 


We went back up to the house and I had some of their food too. It was really good. I miss chicken on the grill and corn and potatoes. Fresh food like that is just the best. I was definitely more full after my two dinners. CW and Jukebox were talking about plans tomorrow. He slackpacked 13 miles today and she drove him, since she has a car here. She was going back to the place he slackpacked to tomorrow, so again my mind started scheming and I asked if she could take my pack. She was totally willing and offered to take Caboose’s pack too. This was my second free slackpack deal. I have a talent haha. I was now excited for tomorrow, especially since I was craving a zero and this would be close to one. I also hadn’t organized my food bag and this would give me time to tomorrow when I arrive to the place that’s holding my pack. We finished dinner and cleaned up and then relaxed for a bit. We all decided to play UNO for a bit outside on the back porch. The view was stunning and there was a hot tub and tables and chairs to sit and relax. We played a few rounds of UNO and then it started to pour. My rain fly was open because it was sunny before, so I sprinted to close that, and CW had left her car windows open. 


We waited a bit and everyone stayed inside drying off. I was colder now and pretty tired, but we decided to finish the game. And guess who won?! Me!! It was a bunch of fun and we all went to bed. It was late and I was wiped still. I was looking forward to slackpacking though. The fireflies were everywhere and lit up the sky all night.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617235,"Slackpack! I headed out late this morning, as I wanted to do laundry before I left and without taking a zero, it’s hard to get some of the chores done. Caboose and her daughter left earlier, slackpacking as well. The hostel owner was very sweet and drove me down to the trailhead. She picked up Birdman and dropped him off too, and we hiked together for a bit. He’s got a great story for why he’s out here. He was doing a section hike with his mom around Hot Springs I believe and he met a ton of thru-hikers and just decided to stay on trail. So he’s hiked from there with whatever gear he had, switching some of it out as he went. He’s a really cool guy and we had a nice time hiking together. He’s carrying this brick that Danran gave him because they’re both part of Riff-Raff. I’ve heard bad things about that group, but both of these guys are awesome. I guess it’s initiation, but the brick gets passed on to different new members and they see who can get it to Maine. It’s actually a brick, it’s 6 pounds. There’s no way in hell I’d ever carry a brick in my pack. It’s heavy enough thanks! Lol. 


Unfortunately, Danran quit today and I had to say goodbye to him. He had friends taking care of his dog back home and they were moving, so he had to go home to be with his dog. He was really upset about it. I’m glad I don’t have any obligations like that at home that could end my trip, although I do want a dog and to move out and settle somewhere after I save some more money. Birdman and I passed a memorial for Stronghold a few miles in. It wasn’t in the spot where it happened, although we were only a few miles from that. We hiked together up a few steep hills and I was starting to slow down. It was another hot day and I was getting tired fast. I again did not bring enough water and was drinking through it fast. 


We passed by the quarter of the way to Maine mark and took pictures. It was so exciting!! I love these little milestones. We stopped for a break on the top of one of the steep climbs. I let him go ahead and decided to go slower for a bit. I felt slow and dehydrated all day, but was glad I had no pack. I passed through a lot of meadows today, and although they were pretty, they were without shade and hot. Heat will really get to me more than cold. I was certainly uncomfortable and cold at the beginning of my trip, but I’d take those days any day over this heat. I did pass by the campsite that the cops had pointed out in AWOL as the spot Stronghold was killed. I stopped for a bit and saw Tsalagi. He said he had lit some sage at the memorial before and was going to tonight at this campsite. It didn’t feel eerie like you’d think. There’s a picture in the newspaper that makes it look dark and scary. It’s actually a really nice campsite by the water. It looked like people had stayed here recently. There were bear lines abandoned on the trees, although I doubt those were from the night of the incident. Some section-hikers came through and decided to camp, despite knowing. I wouldn’t have wanted to camp there even though it was a nice spot and the danger was completely gone. I heard the girl who survived has left the trail and gone home, but now I was able to understand that 6-mile walk she had to make while injured, because I walked through it. I can’t imagine. There were lots of campsites near the actual one, and I heard that there were folks in a tent nearby and Sovereign stared at their tent as they stayed still until cops arrived. I could understand how people nearby may have heard screaming, but not seen what happened. With the layout of it all, it made sense. I was glad to have passed through and taken my time here to remember Stronghold and take it in. 


I arrived at the hostel I was going to stay in, where my pack was dropped. I hadn’t planned on two hostel stays, but I got a free slackpack, so it evens out. The woman was incredibly friendly and it was a nice quiet place. Caboose, her daughter, Birdman, and I were the only guests for the night. I immediately went for the water and then she showed me the shower stuff and I decided I’d shower too. She had frozen pizzas in the fridge so I went for one of those too and a soda. Two showers and town food for several days, I’ll take it! We hung out with the owners for a while and headed to bed. We had discussed slackpacking with them, but they only offered a 26-mile slackpack deal. I could’ve done it, but Caboose was worried she and her daughter wouldn’t be able to. I had already slackpacked, but Caboose was the one asking this time. She was worried because she and her daughter were headed to McAfee Knob and the other awesome Virginia sites, but weren’t sure they’d make it in good time to get all the way to DC, where Linda’s flight back to Sweden would be. They were thinking of yellow-blazing and Caboose would just make up the miles later. We all decided not to slackpack again, but tomorrow was going to be hard because we had a few small steep climbs, and one 5-mile climb. 


I set my sites on a short distance again simply because of all that climbing and having a full pack out of town. But I was frustrated that I’m still not doing 15s. It’s bothering me, but I have to remind myself that I’m still going every day. Denver quit from this hostel and I found out today, as the hostel owner said that she had left all her food here. So the entire trail family of Hot Sauce, Denver, and Prometheus is gone. Being surrounded by the quitting is sad and hard for me, but I support everyone in their decisions. I am still here. I’ll get to Maine, whether it’s 10 miles a day or 30. But hopefully soon I can kick some more out. Slackpacking definitely makes me happy and I’ll treat myself to it as a way to make up those miles. Someone did the math and said you can make it by October 1st if you do 13-mile days the rest of the way. I don’t want to finish that late, so if I did 15-miles a day, hopefully I could finish in mid-September. I’m enjoying my hike now and think that’s more important than anything else. I need to make sure I’m enjoying it, because it’s a long way still to Maine. And I won’t regret the zeros or the low-mileage days when I’m done, I’ll regret the days I pushed myself so hard I hated the trail. Yes I’ll still have really bad days, it’s part of the trail, but listening to myself and my needs out here is important. Slow and steady wins the race? It’s not a race though. It’s a journey and I’ve already proved to myself what I’m capable of. I did that 17 the other day by myself. But I still felt wiped even doing low-mileage on other days. We’ll see what happens, but tomorrow is low-mileage uphill and I hope it’s not too hot!

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617237,"Uphill uphill, yeah yeah. Today was hot again. Almost brutally so. I organized my food bag in the morning and chatted with the owner for a bit. She told me she had only done 12-14 miles a day when she was on trail. She said she had pushed more and would be so wiped she’d have to zero. It was helpful to hear and made me feel a bit better about my mileage situation, even though I can do longer days and not be fully wiped; it just depends on the day. 


I headed out and those two steep uphills were incredibly annoying. They were basically straight up. There was a down in between, but they were still a pain. I finally got to the big climb and was told it was gradual. It was not gradual. It was also straight up for at least three out of the five miles. I was dying from the heat. I actually stopped and cried halfway up from pure exhaustion. I was listening to podcasts to try and help, but I was just miserable. It was so hot and I was dehydrated and there was so much uphill. People think 10 miles a day is nothing, but when it’s like this folks, it’s like death. I was so drained. 


I finally made it up to this pond, 2 miles from the top. I stopped for water and went to go filter it all. I have the two bags now so I filled each and filtered them into my smart water bottles. I drank so much water just sitting there that I had to go back and filter it all again. I had also heard from the hostel owner that there was no water at the shelter I was headed to, so I carried 4 liters up there and clipped the two collapsible bags to the outside of my pack. I ran into two folks I didn’t get the name of, but they were having a rough day too. The heat and the climbs will do it to you!! I was also thinking about my water situation and how silly I was when I started this journey. I used to carry 4 liters at a time every day because I thought I’d need that much. It was silly and when I realized that one liter is 2.2 pounds, I was kicking myself. I now carry 2 at a time and filter whenever I run low. 


I hiked the two last miles up to the shelter. It was gradual now lol, but it was in a meadow and all exposed to the sun. I did listen to a good podcast though about music, and one about having no eyesight, but relying on sound to carry through an experience. Both were great to help me get up the climbs today, but it was still a rough day. I arrived at the shelter and there was a nice view. Sort of made it worth it? Haha. I found a nice spot in the tall grass to put my tent. I tried to put up a clothes line, but the wind blew it all down. My clothes were soaking wet from the sweat. I’ve said it before and will again, but IT WAS HOT TODAY. Haha. I walked over and set up my food and water by the fire. Birdman and Yoshi and Eeyore were all trying to get the fire going, but having trouble. They eventually got it and it was a raging fire! Caboose was talking about yellow-blazing from Bland, VA tomorrow. We were all pretty wiped. Today was Birdman’s first day with the brick in his pack, so he was struggling a bit too. We all sat around the fire and relaxed. We were talking about ticks and walking through so many meadows with tall grass. I was worried. I had ticks on my neck when I was younger from rolling in the grass with dogs, shock. My dad took them out and I do have a vivid memory of that process, even though I was young. 


Birdman made me all paranoid because he said ticks can crawl up your body when you’re sleeping and bite elsewhere and you might not even know. I was freaked out because the last thing I would want is an undiscovered tick bite that turns into Lyme disease. I told him I was going to do a personal tick check in my tent and all the guys joked about my “silhouette” from my tent. Haha nothing to see here men. I’m getting naked in my tent to check for ticks because I’m incredibly paranoid. No silhouettes to be seen. Lol. A few folks showed up just before sundown. I had seen them before and so had Birdman and Caboose. It was Shake, Tag, and another girl I’m blanking on. They were talking about 20 miles a day for the next few days and I was like well see ya never! But they were really nice and we had a good time chatting for a while. I didn’t have to bother with my bear bag tonight because the shelter had a door and was high-up. We all just hung ours inside the shelter from the hooks. 


I went to do my tick check and the guys teased me. I couldn’t see my back or butt so for all I knew I was going to die from a tick that night I was so paranoid. Lol. But I checked everything else and seemed to be good. I have a million bites on me and I itched so many into cuts that I have dark scabs all over my legs too and blood. But no tick bites as far as I can see? I’ll have to butt-check when I have a mirror haha. Hopefully no butt-silhouettes occurred from my tent. Ugh what a rough day today. But it ended with great company and laughs and I am proud of myself for every day out here. 


Little Debbie","Bear Garden Hostel

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622221,"Another “short day” today. I was just feeling like poop after the past few days. What I really needed was a zero day. I should’ve just taken one at the farm. I’m frustrated that I didn’t because now I’m mentally and physically wiped. It looked like it was going to rain all morning so I went inside to make breakfast and get ready. There was someone asleep on the bunk in the shelter the entire time I was making and having breakfast. While I was there, an older couple walked in. I had seen them before, but this was the first time we introduced ourselves. Their names are Rain and Sprinkles because he says “it’s raining” and she says “oh it’s just sprinkling”. They’re so awesome! He is a Veteran and they’ve traveled everywhere because of his job, and then they tried a thru-hike and he finished, while she supported with a camper. He cheered me up a bit by talking about his journey on the AT and how it was better than any other experience he had had. He said he’s always talking about the AT. 


I sat with them for a while since I wasn’t looking forward to hiking today, and they packed up just before I did. The man on the bunk woke up just as I headed out. Today started with a downhill, but it was so steep. I’ve noticed that downhills aren’t always something to look forward to on the AT, as they often are steep and it’s just a ton of pounding down on your knees and ankles with all that weight. My knees have been an issue for me in the past with running in particular. I tended to go from 0 to 60, and I did that once in college and my knee was worse than it’s ever been. For the trail I trained by walking on the treadmill and slowly increasing elevation and running for a bit and then walking. My knees weren’t bothering me with this better, slower method of preparing my body, but I’m finding that the downhills have gotten steeper and my knees are having a harder time. After the downhill, the walking was all on a ridge for a bit. It went up and down and was rocky, but not too bad. I still felt so poopy though and continued to feel that way even on the ridge. 



The ridge ended with another long downhill, but it was steep and was hurting my knees again. I was battling the mental game today mostly, but the physical was getting to me too. And the weather was looking bad. I originally planned on going 14 today to a campsite that was beside a road. I had heard they were doing trail magic there for four days or so. I reached a shelter at the bottom of the downhill and knew I’d have to go up to get to the campsite. I sat on the picnic table debating and passed out on my pack from exhaustion. I felt so wiped and so angry because I hadn’t gone that far. As I was sitting there I heard thunder and decided to at least move into the shelter in case. There were a few other folks in there, one man named City Slecka, and a girl and boy named Buttercup and Husky. Husky has bright blue eyes and some facial hair, so that’s how he got his name. They were planning to go to the same campsite as me, but went into the shelter in case it rained. City joked and said “there’s a 30 percent chance of rain until Katahdin”. Sounds about right! It will be gorgeous and sunny one moment, and pouring the next out here!
We watched anxiously and sure enough, it poured. The thunder was so loud and the rain was blowing into the shelter, making the first foot or so wet. At this point I pretty much knew I was staying here. I felt dead just sitting there looking out and I did not have any desire to walk out into a torrential thunderstorm. The rain did let up temporarily and I went to get water, but put all my rain gear on first. I was very thirsty, as today was hot. I know the heat probably contributed to my exhaustion, but I had tried to drink a lot of water throughout the day. I had a fair amount as I sat there waiting out the rain. A woman showed up named Wonder Woman. She was nice, but intimidating, as she’s doing 20-mile days. I know she probably didn’t mean it, but it felt a little condescending the way she addressed my food bag and my pack weight. 


I’ve accepted my pack weight situation. I’m strong enough to carry it, I’m not “ultralight” and that’s okay. You don’t have to be. You don’t have to do 20 miles a day. You don’t HAVE to do anything out here. It’s your own hike. I was already pretty depressed and then felt worse while talking to her. I pretty much accepted my fate and knew more people would arrive, having done 20 mile days. I mentally prepped for dealing with this and knew it would annoy me, but I was done for the day and I was trying to make peace with myself. City left and so did Husky and Buttercup. The rain had died down a bit, but it continued to rain all night. Had I carried on, I would’ve had to set up my tent in the rain and take down a wet tent tomorrow. 


Two more guys showed up, as expected. They had done 27 miles. Just great. Awesome. I felt like pure crap now and sat there wanting to scream to the world. This trail is just so god damn hard. And no one seems to realize!! I feel so alone out here and so worthless when I’ve done a 10 mile day. Why is that the case? Why on earth do I feel worthless when I’ve gotten up and walked 10 more miles than yesterday? Just why? At this point I’m pretty much only meeting 20-milers. It seemed like everyone started taking speed when they entered Virginia. Maybe it’s just because the people taking their time quit and now it’s just the fast people, or maybe it’s because the people taking their time sped up, or maybe it’s because the trail is “easier”, or maybe it’s because the people like me are hiding away all day from the intimidating 20-milers. Who knows. 


I will set the record straight though. Virginia is not easy. It’s not flat. This myth that “you can crank out so many miles in Virginia” and “Virginia is nice and flat” needs to be debunked. I am debunking it. Virginia is not flat. Fake news. Lol can I tweet this? Can I get this out to the world? Lol. I get that people think you can do more miles here, but I think that’s because it’s far enough into the trail that you have your trail legs and can get moving, it’s not because the trail is easier. But even with trail legs, no one seems to factor in the heat that’s come in, the bug situation, the humidity, the days of rain, the ridiculous amount of climbing some days, and more. Your body may be in better shape, but how about when your body is sweating all day and still pounding out miles and it’s lacking energy? And your mind. The trail is so mental. How do I carry my mind to Maine if every day I’m just pounding out more miles? It won’t happen. 


I chatted with the boys even though I was so furious inside about their mileage compared to mine. One’s name was Sunflower and I can’t remember the other’s. They were soaked from head to toe from the rain. They had gotten caught up on that ridge in the rain and thunder. Not appealing to me. They set up and ate and we all chatted. Rain and Sprinkles had walked into the shelter space, but I think they thought it was full, so they set up their tent. I got what felt like more judgement about my pack weight and mileage. It’s so amazing to me that people can be judgmental out here, but they can!! I could feel their judgement and actually later heard that they had told someone about my pack weight and how “big” it was. I even had rumors starting about my pack. As if it didn’t feel shitty enough to do 10 miles compared to 27, now I was getting a reputation on trail for my pack weight and mileage? That’s not how this works. Hike your own god damn hike. 


We all decided to hang our bear bags in the shelter since it was raining and no one wanted to go out and throw a line. I was happy they were at least on the same page with me there. We briefly discussed the trail magic I had heard about at that road 4 miles from us, and the boys claimed they “always missed trail magic” and that there was “no trail magic for late starters”. Bullarky. There’s been plenty of trail magic even into April, you’re just racing your way to Maine so you’re missing it all. They didn’t just do it for the “early starters”, trail magic happens all the way up to Maine. But whatever. I was just done with the entire day and didn’t feel like arguing with them. We all went to sleep. I tossed and turned all night and didn’t sleep well, despite my exhaustion. I thought about Caboose and her daughter and Birdman. Where were those guys? I know they must have gone past here, but I was so longing to be with them. 


Little Debbie","Chestnut Knob Shelter
",Jenkins Shelter,"May 29, Wed",10.70
Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622222,"It was still kind of rainy this morning as I got going. The 20-milers were all gone by the time I woke up, and I didn’t miss them. I saw Rain and Sprinkles taking things down, but I slowly sat and ate breakfast alone. I was still not feeling great, but hoping the trail magic at the road really was there and that it might cheer me up. The day started with an uphill, as I expected, but it wasn’t too bad. There was a bit of a ridge after the up, and then another down to the road. The four miles wasn’t too bad. I don’t think I would’ve liked doing it yesterday, but it was fine this morning. I got down to the road and saw two ladies. I asked them if they knew about trail magic and they said “yup, follow the AT a bit and it comes out to a parking lot”. I was so happy. There actually was trail magic! I came out to the parking lot and saw several men, a few women, and Rain and Sprinkles. 



There was a ton of food. They had a grill set up and sausage, hot dogs, and eggs, and a table full of fruit, candy, brownies, cookies, soda, granola bars, and more! I had chocolate milk and bacon and sausage, and pancakes!! It was amazing!! I chatted with Rain and Sprinkles for a while and we chatted with the men and women hosting the trail magic. It was run by another group of churches; they really are so wonderful to hikers here. I stayed for a while because I was just not feeling great about hiking. Rain and Sprinkles carried on. In came more hikers that again intimidated me and frustrated me. I met Principal and Iceman and a few others. They had all come from Chestnut Knob, so essentially hiked more than my entire day yesterday before 12pm. It was infuriating.
I was social, but really having a hard time. As the hikers came in and out, I was talking with the people running the trail magic and I was expressing my frustration with mileage and comparing myself to others lately. The lady I spoke with was so nice and seemed to want to help me in any way to get out of my funk. She recommended I slackpack to Lickskillet Hostel, which was not too far away. She said they were all going to drop the extra food off there tonight. It was a little too far for me to hike to today, unless I went in from the next road in 7 miles and then slackpacked the next day. The woman drove me 2 miles from the trail magic, where there was service, and I called Lickskillet, but unfortunately he said they were full. 


I thanked the woman for driving me and suggesting those options, and settled with my plan to just go 7 miles ahead and see how I felt. I know I slackpack a lot, or maybe it seems like I do. Often I find opportunities where I can do it for free and I take full advantage. But slackpacking is sort of like a zero day for me in what it does for me. It allows me to feel good about my mileage and accomplishments. If I can’t make the mileage other days, slackpacking gives me a change to make the mileage. And it gives my body a break from that pack weight. I’ve decided I’m not limiting myself anymore in things like zeros or hotels or slackpacking because I need to be happy out here or I will never make it. I was so frugal in the beginning and it was making me miserable. I was convincing myself that I had to have a certain plan and budget to do this trip. But I saved my money and it just means that now I’ll have less when I get back. And yes that sucks, as I was kind of hoping to buy a used car for myself when I get home and I wanted money for that, but at this point I’d rather have a really happy and memorable trail experience than limit myself. So slackpacking it is, when I can! 


All the planning took a bit and I ended up having a hot dog there too, so breakfast and lunch at the trail magic! I eventually left those nice people and headed on. There was a climb out of the gap, of course. It was not that bad though. I was not feeling great because I had so much soda and junk food in me, but I made it to the top. It was just a ridge line up there, and it actually wasn’t too bad terrain-wise. If this is what people meant by “Virginia being easy” fine lol. It was nice and flat for a bit. The people can have their way. But I was still annoyed and struggling because of the last few days. And there were no views at all the past two days. It was so boring and monotonous, which made it that much worse. There was a tiny view at the top of the climb after the trail magic, but it was really lacking. It was kind of fitting to then descend into Bland, VA haha. 



The descent was not bad, and ended with a beautiful view... of power lines. My fave! I got down to the road and there was a store there called Brushy Mountain Outpost. They served hot food, but also had some things for a resupply. If you were to go into Bland, you could take a shuttle or hitch from here. I didn’t need to resupply yet, as I was waiting for Pearisburg. I got into the store and saw 25-Mile and Wild Violet and Wizard! It was very nice to see them. I also saw Rain and Sprinkles. Everyone was there having food and I was so happy to be around people I knew. I was convinced to try the fried Oreos, which were so sweet, but so good. Rain and Sprinkles said they were camping out back of the store if I wanted to join them. They said they’d buy me breakfast; they were so so nice.
25-Mile and that crew were headed on to the next shelter, which was 2 miles, but uphill and a long side trail off the AT. Everyone else seemed to be going there too, even the people who had come all the way from Chestnut Knob, meaning they were doing my two days in one. I really couldn’t deal with any more people like that right now. I was just miserable around these 20-milers. And the whole pack was headed to the shelter. So even though I knew 25-Mile and that crew, there was no way I was going to be around all the other people. I was way too intimidated and annoyed. 25-Mile and that crew actually seemed to be at my pace. They’d get up late, get into camp late, and have slower or lower mileage days. But they were trying to push more miles, as I guess I was too. 


I ended up deciding to stay. I set up my tent and talked for a while with Rain and Sprinkles. I brought my sit pad out to the picnic table outside the store, with the intention of doing some blogging and relaxing with no one here. And then a whole crew of more 20-milers showed up. It was like I was being baked into a cake of my own misery. It was like 101 Dalmatians where she’s poured into the pot of batter and is trying to get out and ends up being baked. I was literally so f***ing done. I just wanted space and time to reflect on my hike, and more people had to come. One guy said to me “there’s a lot more coming”. I grimaced. He said “I’m going to have to set up really close to you to fit them in”. I grimaced again. “Sure that’s fine” I said, inside wanting to scream. I took my sit pad and my nice space and went into my tent. I didn’t want to see or interact with any of them. 


I blogged for a while, listening to them all come in and set up around me. One guy was saying incredibly negative and rude things to his buddy and I was done listening and dealing with it all. I was going to make dinner, but I didn’t even want to deal with that. I snacked on a few things. I was also kind of full from all that trail magic food and the Oreos. I eventually fell asleep, itching my bug bites and feeling frustrated.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622224,"I waited for all the tents to disappear and finally got up and went inside the store. Rain and Sprinkles were having breakfast and I went to join them, when who should I see but Hobo!! I was so excited. Hobo’s such a awesome guy. He was super friendly and I was so happy to see him. He had just come back from mile 688, where he skipped ahead to to do some hiking with his kids. That whole section was Dragon’s Tooth, McAfee Knob, and Tinker Cliffs, the Virginia Triple Crown and a well-visited section. He did that whole section with them to Daleville and then they left and he had come back to where he had skipped ahead from. He was happy to see me too because he said had been really sad to see his kids go and it was nice to have a familiar face. 


Rain and Sprinkles and Hobo and I had breakfast together and Rain and Sprinkles bought it for me, which was so nice. I had a sausage biscuit, eggs, and hash browns. I was discussing my plans for the day and Lickskillet was 13 miles away, so I planned to hike there and at least go to the hostel to have a night off trail and maybe slackpack. I convinced Hobo to join me in that plan, as he seemed a little hesitant to push bigger miles anyway. Rain and Sprinkles were out here section hiking anyway and decided to zero. We had a really nice breakfast together and I was thankful to be with them. Rain convinced me to get some ice cream. The ice cream was the best deal here! It was 3 bucks for a massive cone with a massive scoop. They didn’t have chocolate or flavors I’d like normally, but they had a caramel waffle one, and it was delicious. Not normally what I’d go for, but it hit the spot today. 


I bought a new thing of fuel; I am very impressed with my stove for being so fuel efficient. The last fuel I got was in Hot Springs!! But I realized that it was almost empty the night before and figured I’d buy fuel now. It was a bit pricey, but I was happy to help the small business. Creds to Jetboil for an amazing stove!! I was feeling hot and a bit off with the ice cream in my belly before exercise, but I headed out to do my 13 mile day! I called Lickskillet and put my name down for a bunk. 



The hike started with a road walk, which was HOT. It was a bad time of day too, but I felt like I was baking. I crossed a highway and continued down the road to the trailhead. There was a sign that said “no deer carcasses”. I laughed a bit because you know, let me just put my dead deer down here before continuing my hike. Lol. But I understand that apparently people have dumped deer carcasses there before and they had to deal with them. The hike after this was a big up, and in the heat it was quite tough. I passed some girls that I had seen at the store earlier and they were meeting their boys on trail, who were out for a hike. I was sweating so much it was dripping off my face. I made it up to the top, which had no view of course. The next few miles were up down up down, and it was starting to get rainy. I wasn’t seeing anyone except for one girl on the side of the trail. I find I don’t see anyone while hiking anymore for the most part.
I felt rain drops and accepted my fate. I put my pack cover on and my phone in my bag. It was too hot to wear my rain coat, but normally I’ll do that so I can still have my phone in my pocket and my music playing. It rained hard for a bit and I was soaking, but it felt good in that heat. I hiked on and came to 600! Yay! Another mile marker! I was so happy. And the rain stopped just for me to sit and enjoy it!! I wanted a picture so I figured I’d wait for 15 minutes and take a break since I hadn’t taken one yet, but no one showed up. I find that the trail really is thinning out. Today I felt like I was hiking the whole thing alone. I set up my phone on top of my pack and took a timed photo, which worked perfectly! 



There was more up down up down up down, and then I got to a shelter. I was so thirsty. There had been no water basically since Brushy Mountain Outpost and I was parched. I stopped at the shelter and got water. It had started raining again, but at this point I was only a mile from the road where Lickskillet picks up. I drank a whole liter right then and there I was so thirsty. I filled the other liter and called Lickskillet to tell him I was a mile away. I began the walk down and it wasn’t too bad. I went quickly and got to the road before him. The owner’s name is Mongo. He showed up and I put my pack in his car and we headed off. He is so so nice!!
Lickskillet is an awesome hostel. It’s in a old church and it has a bunch of beds spread out, a stove and fridge with free sodas for hikers, a TV with Netflix, and showers and laundry. And it’s donation based! One of the beds is also right in the old pulpit and it’s in an old wooden ship. It was so so cool. Mongo is an incredible man and worked so hard to start this hostel after a long and difficult past. He is an inspiration and his place was truly a hidden gem. I saw Hobo and met a few other guys too named Crypter and Cucumber. Crypter started the trail like all the other 20-milers and got injured, so he had to stop and zero and recover. I obviously don’t want anyone to be injured, but it does make me feel a little good when the fasties have to slow down a bit; they intimidate me so much. I didn’t take a shower or do laundry because I knew I was headed to Pearisburg soon and could do it there, so I basically just stayed in the bed and had a soda. I made one of my mountain houses for dinner, but couldn’t finish it. 


A girl named Tinkerbell and her dog Peter Pan showed up. They did a load a laundry and she threw my clothes in too, which I appreciated, even though I didn’t need to yet. My clothes were still a bit wet from the rain anyway so it was good to clean them. We watched a bit of TV and hung out and then headed to bed. I was glad to have come in here. It was such a nice hostel. I would ask about slackpacking tomorrow.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622225,"Mongo was leaving for a little section hike today, so he said he could drop our bags off 20 miles ahead at Woods Hole Hostel on his way and we could slackpack up. I was very thankful for this and had heard that he slackpacks, so I was glad it worked out! Hobo and Tinkerbell joined me and we prepped our bags and called Woods Hole to make a reservation. We sat for a bit and hung out. A man came by with a small white birdhouse that he made. It was meant to be the hostel and it had a little bear hanging out the window. It was fine craftsmanship and made completely out of wood. 


We gave Mongo our packs and he drove us all to the trailhead. It was hot and I was not feeling like hiking today, but at least I was slackpacking! We hiked together for a bit, but I took a break on the uphill to eat. I hadn’t had anything to eat yet, mostly out of laziness to not want to get my stove out and cook oatmeal, so I had a ProBar for breakfast and that did the trick! I had put Nuun tablets in my water as well. These things really work. They totally hydrate you in addition to your water, so even if you’ve had just a liter over a few miles, you feel hydrated. The uphills were hard and annoying today and I was getting tired fast. We knew we were going to pass Dismal Falls and Trent’s Grocery, and Hobo had said he’d get us beers from Trent’s Grocery to have at the Falls. That was so nice of him. 


He hiked on ahead to do that, and I caught up to Tinkerbell and hiked with her for a bit. We went rather slow and Peter Pan was the best. He kept looking back at me, almost to say “you coming?” Gah I love dogs. YES IM COMING AND IM FOLLOWING YOU TO MAINE YOU ADORABLE FLUFFY DOGGO. He took a little poo right beside the trail and I’m afraid I pressured him by still hiking. Haha. We arrived at the Falls. It was a side trail to them, and it felt a little long. They were not the best I’ve seen haha so the name Dismal was somewhat fitting. But they had a nice swimming area and it looked refreshing. 



The water was very cold though. I put my feet in slowly, but it was almost so cold it hurt. Hobo showed up with beers! There were a fair amount of people there doing the same thing. I found out later some had yellow blazed from Trent’s Grocery. I think more people yellow blaze out here than I realize. I saw Birdman, Shake and the two girls, and Cucumber and Crypter from last night, as well as some other folks. We sat for a while and talked. I had my feet in the water and was drinking my beer. The rocks under the water were so slippery I was sure I was going down and the beer was coming with me. That’s the only way to get me in the water lol if I slip! I’m such a chicken.
But this chicken was getting hot. I was feeling the sunburn and the heat and the beer! Tinkerbell decided she’d go in, so I decided to too. I walked down to the bigger swimming hole with her and she jumped right in. I slowly walked in, which is dumb because the water only feels more and more cold as you do that, so eventually I yelped and dunked my whole body. It felt so good. I was so glad I did it. Tinkerbell too a picture of me and slipped all the way out of the water, climbing back up. I sat for a bit to dry off and had a snack, but I didn’t pack enough food in my day pack, so I was hungry. 


After we dried off a bit, Hobo decided to head on and we were a few minutes behind him. I was just hiking in my boxers, but put my shirt on to prevent chafing and more sunburn. We passed by 25-Mile here; I think she must have zero’d. Tinkerbell and I headed out the side trail together, but then I headed in front of her. I was definitely feeling the buzz from the beer haha. I’ve never hiked buzzed, so this was interesting. The miles seemed to fly and I wasn’t bothered by the heat or rocks or things like that as much. 


I was a bit annoyed though because this whole group of “ultralight” 20-milers PASSED ME. I was slackpacking, and they still passed me and were on my tail for a bit. They were hiking as fast as me and doing the same mileage with packs. I’m sorry but just UGH. Really?! This is the crap that makes me feel like I’m not good enough out here. I let them pass and hiked on, catching up to them occasionally, but hiking behind them. Hobo and I found each other and hiked together for a bit. I stopped for water and a bathroom break and found the 20-Milers. I don’t remember their names, but there was a man named Shine. 


Tinkerbell caught up and then Hobo and I headed out while she took a quick break too. We had a bit of a climb coming up. Hobo and I talked for a bit and then I told him to go ahead because I was feeling poopy. I was definitely coming off of that buzz from the beer and I was starting to get tired. It was so steep too. I stopped for more water and the fasties passed me, one of them even laughing at me as I tried to scoop up the water at this small source. He said “how’s that working for you?” I could’ve exploded. Do you really need me to feel ten times worse right now? Just let me be. He left and I continued climbing. Tinkerbell passed, but we played leapfrog for a bit. We arrived at a view! An actual view! It was very pretty and we took it in for a bit. We hiked with one of the fasties, a woman who’s name I can’t remember, and then we all arrived at the top. There was a side trail to the view, but I was tired and it was getting late. 


Hobo had found some tent poles and brought them with him to the hostel. The fasties led the way and we followed them. They were nice, but intimidating. The woman went to school and studied the environment, so she knew a lot about the plants we passed. At one point she got her  hiking pole stuck in between some rocks and got behind us. It felt long to do those last few miles. It was the classic “mostly downhill” of the AT, but it had some little ups too. We finally arrived at the road. We were surprised to see several people from the Falls who had gotten there before us, but we had never seen them pass us. Later we discovered that there was a blue blaze trail and they had taken it. I think a lot more people than I realize do that. 



The hostel was .5 off trail, so a bit of a pain to get to. But we were pretty much done for the day and it felt good to have slackpacked and done those miles, even though people did them with packs on. We got to the hostel and the owners were away, but there were a few staff members who checked us in. Hobo and I got a room upstairs with three twin beds, and Tinkerbell was going to join us, but they were charging her ridiculous prices for her dog and she decided to tent. Overall I thought the hostel was pricey and a little unfriendly, but it was clean and had a cool vibe to it. Hobo and I ordered a milkshake to share and then snacked on our food bags for dinner. We each took showers and then relaxed and went to bed. Only 13 miles to go to Pearisburg tomorrow!

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622226,"Hobo and I got up fairly early for the breakfast they serve here. It wasn’t included, but it was good. The eggs were a little weird and had rhubarb and spinach in them, which for a picky eater like me was not great. They had homemade bread and apple butter, which was delicious. They had grits, which are another thing I’m not a fan of. The southern biscuits and gravy and grits thing is getting a little old for me. I don’t like any of it! Ready for my northern food again lol. The best part of breakfast was cinnamon rolls! They were INCREDIBLE. Homemade and covered in icing and absolutely delicious. I had three and was very full and content. 


Hobo and I packed up and headed out for our 13 mile day (Guthook and AWOL say different things lol something around that mileage)! It was hot when we left. We saw Yoshi and Eeyore and they were taking a zero, and then some of the fasties had actually decided to stay here (one’s ankle was hurting), so we saw them too. There was a little climb to start the day, but it was actually really gradual. Hobo said he liked my pace and we hiked together for pretty much the whole day. It was a lot of walking through meadowy forest. It was so nice to bond with him. Hobo is my mom’s age, so he’s like a trail dad to me! He has his own daughters and we talked about a lot of different life experiences. I don’t know if I mentioned, but he got his name because people kept giving him food over a period of time and one girl observed that and called him a hobo. 


He’s from Ohio and is so great to hang out with. We had a really nice hike together today and I was grateful for his company. We passed by Ziggy and another man, Texas Pete, and there was a very nice view. We stopped for a bit and had a snack, and then we kept going. It started to go downhill after this and we passed by Angel’s Rest Rock, what the hostel is named after! It didn’t have as great of a view as the other one, but it was still a nice view. We continued down and it was a rather steep downhill. We saw a man and his son walking up it and commented on how we thought it would be a steep and difficult climb going that way. 


We called Angel’s Rest from the first road we came to and walked a bit further to the next one. We passed some power lines and a little climb and then we were at the road! It took a little while for them to show up. I think they got confused, because there are two roads you can get picked up from and we called them from the first to say we would be at the next in 15 minutes. We thought we were clear, but they had apparently gone to the first road and waited and then decided to go to the second too. The man who picked us up was named Acadicus. He had studied owls on top of a Big Bald Mountain and the scientific name of what he was studying was Acadicus. I forgot it a million times in the course of what would become my week-long stay in the Vortex, but definitely got it down. 


We arrived at Angel’s Rest and another man named Tramp checked us in. I discussed slackpacking with them and they have a really great deal, but I told them I’d think on it and would just be staying the night and possibly zeroing tomorrow. I hadn’t taken a zero in two weeks so it was time. They gave me a tour. The place consists of the little office, which had a mural with wings on it that people like to take pictures in front of, a bunkhouse that was an old garage, and bathhouse with three separate bathrooms that have a toilet, sink, and shower in each, and a trailer with a TV, sitting area, and kitchen. I was staying in a bunk so I walked in to choose a bunk. All of the upper bunks were free, but none of the lower ones. I was going to go for an open lower bunk, but Tramp said that mattress was crap, so essentially it was only top bunks at this point. I don’t really like the top bunk in general. I never really had an issue with it before the trail, but now the top bunk means climbing up there and pulling your pack and stuff up and down the bunk. It’s just more of a nuisance, which is why there were no lower bunks left. 


I walked into the main trailer and saw someone I knew! Chug! I had met Chug for the first time at Trail Days, but she was part of that trail family. Unfortunately, she had a boot on her foot. She had gotten injured about a week ago, and was hanging out in Pearisburg, doing a work for stay at Angel’s Rest. She seemed a little anxious and tired of staying in one place, but it was good to see her! Hobo was staying in a private room in the trailer and we both threw in a load of laundry and I put some loaner clothes on. I put a pair of lucky charms spandex on and a shirt that said “happy go lucky” because I was told you needed to pull the craziest outfits out of the loaner clothes. It was crazy for sure! But I was having a blast and enjoying myself. I saw Birdman near his tent, and inside the bunkhouse I saw Wonder Woman, a woman named Camel, Ziggy, and Texas Pete. 


Hobo and I went to the Mexican restaurant for dinner. There’s always a Mexican restaurant lol. My issue with most is that they don’t have margaritas! There have been so many “dry” Mexican restaurants! But this one was not! They had huge margaritas and they made them frozen, which I love. Frozen margaritas are like slushies and I love crunching on the ice while sipping too. My dad actually makes very good margaritas at home every weekend and I do miss having those. He makes them frozen too so you can crunch on the ice. I can’t wait to have those again! Hobo didn’t get a margarita because he was craving soda instead. I had a Fajita Quesadilla, which was delicious. I got French Fries on the side lol I know I was at a Mexican place, but fries are fries and I was craving them.


Dinner was awesome and we saw Camel, Texas Pete, and Birdman at the bar as we left. I was pretty wiped, so I decided not to stay. Hobo went to the Dairy Queen for a shake and then we went back to the hostel. We went into the trailer to watch TV. Hobo put on The Bachelorette as a joke, but I was enjoying it haha. I do watch that show at home with my mom. I think it’s total trash, but almost more interesting to watch knowing that it’s trash because it’s just so ridiculous. Someone came in and vetoed it haha so we watched another show instead. I headed to my bunk and slept alright. They didn’t have sheets so I was just in my sleeping bag and I was a bit hot and itchy all night.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622227,"Zero day! Today I woke up knowing I’d take a zero. My goal was to do some blogging, but it was just hard. There were people walking in and out of the main space all day and the TV was on, and it was hot outside. I caught up on a few days, but was still pretty behind. It was honestly causing me a lot of stress on my zero day. I don’t like getting behind on my blog because then I start to forget what happened. I’m writing this two weeks later and I’m forgetting what happened, so it’s a bit stressful when you get behind on the blog. But it’s important to write it so I can look back on it all later. 


Some folks were thinking of slackpacking, so Hobo, Birdman, Camel, and Texas Pete decided to do it. I wanted to have my zero, so I didn’t join them. They did 20 miles southbound back to Pearisburg. I was thinking about that for the next day, but was hoping I could go north instead. I went to Walmart and got some snacks and food for dinner, and some new insoles. I set up my tent so I wouldn’t have to pay for another bunk night, since I wasn’t that comfortable in the bunkhouse anyway. I moved from tent to trailer a few times, trying to find a spot to sit and blog, but again kept getting distracted. Chug and Ziggy we’re watching The Office, which is such a great show. I have totally stupid humor like Michael Scott and have always found the show funny. 


I made pasta for dinner and had some Angry Orchard Rosé cider, which I enjoy. I prefer Rosé wine, but it’s a pretty limited selection at Walmart lol hiker trash looking for classy summer wine at Walmart. I met a few hikers at Walmart named Martha Stewart, Razzle, Ambassador, Green Bean, and Whistler. Ambassador was thinking of slackpacking too, but didn’t care that it was southbound. I saw them all in the trailer throughout the day and hung out at night. Acadicus came in to tell us all it was quiet hours. Some hostels really enforce it and others don’t, but Angel’s Rest definitely enforced it. We all left the trailer and I went to my tent and slept. I told Acadicus and Tramp I wanted to slack tomorrow northbound. They said I could leave anytime that way and just call when I get to the pickup spot, so I went to bed.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622228,"Miscommunication! Not my fave. Somehow they all thought I was slackpacking southbound today, but I was not. They were waiting for me and Ambassador was very rude later when I saw her. I had literally told them all I was going northbound and didn’t need to be on the shuttle because I was just leaving from here. But whatever. I was frustrated about the miscommunication, but got up at my own time and headed out. The owner Doc Peppa ended up driving me to the trailhead. I know I’m stubborn about the north vs south thing, and as my hike goes on, that will change as I begin to open up and embrace different ways of hiking this trail. But for now, Deb is a stubborn little butt. 



The day started uphill and it was hot. There was a bit of road walking first. The uphill was annoying, but better without a pack. Once I got up onto the ridge it wasn’t too bad. I heard some incredibly loud planes that felt like they were going to come crashing into me right in the woods. I wondered what they were doing. I ran into Cali, who was also southbound slackpacking, and Ambassador. I was making okay time, but going a bit slow. I passed a few more people and actually ran a little bit on some of the downhills, which felt really good. I miss that! I passed one guy who was about to go pee. Oops! He said “bad timing!” And I was like “haha I’ve seen it all you’re good.” I really have seen it all out here.
I called the hostel when I was a few miles away. I was climbing up Peter’s Mountain, which was a steep incline and a bit of a pain. It was all downhill after that though to the parking area. It worked out perfectly with timing and Acadicus was walking up the trail just as I came down to the parking lot! He’s really cool to be around and it was nice to shuttle with him. When I got back I took a shower. I saw Blazer and he and Acadicus were going to the Chinese buffet for dinner. Both that and Mexican restaurants are in every trail town lol. They invited me along and I said I had a frozen pizza to make, but decided to come along anyway. I ate a bit of one plate of food, but it wasn’t that good. It was half-price though so that was nice. 


Acadicus talked about the cult in Vermont that I met at Trail Days. This thing is REAL peeps! It’s not just amazing pasta in the woods!! Their main location is Vermont and they try to recruit hikers into the cult every year. Acadicus knew a woman who was in the cult for 8 years and found a way out, but they make you change your name, they take all your possessions, this place is no joke. Acadicus thru-hiked two years ago. His thru-hike is honestly the way I would do this thing if I were to start again. He started in January and took his time, playing music and enjoying the sites, averaging 10-mile days, and making it to Katahdin in October. It took him 9 months, but he had a blast and wants to do another thru-hike southbound. I’m feeling so much pressure these days, it would be so amazing if I could slow down and enjoy it and still make it to Maine. But alas, I don’t have that kind of time. Acadicus was in CT by now. Man if I was in CT right now, my timing would be so perfect. Oh well.


I got back to the hostel and watched TV with everyone for a bit. In the days I was here, we watched The Office, Community, Letter Kenny (which has to be the worst show I’ve ever seen lol sorry Tramp), and Brooklyn Nine-Nine. That show is my freaking jam. My ex introduced it to me and I love it so much. It’s so good. I joked with the peeps in the hostel that I was Amy because I really do see myself as her lol but a little less organized. I do like to plan though and clean and whatnot. And I’m super energetic and just ahhhh most of the time. But I end up hanging with a lot of hikers who are more like Jake, a hot mess lol. Ugh it’s such a good show. It’s one that actually makes me laugh nonstop. 


I ended up making my frozen pizza for dinner despite eating Chinese food too. I met a few other folks, Camelback Santa being one of them. I kinda find him arrogant and he brags about how much mileage he can do and all the marathons he runs back home. But he’s entertaining too. I went and hung out with everyone at the firepit tonight. There was no fire, but we were enjoying some laughs together. Acadicus was tapping on the wood with a metal thing and it sounded like the beat at the beginning of Crazy Train, so I began singing that and it was pretty funny. He was also playing with this chain they have that gets a hoop on the end onto a hook. They’ve been here so long Tramp and Acadicus have come up with new ways to swing the chain. It was pretty funny to watch. Ziggy and Chug and that whole crew was there and it was just an awesome time hanging with them.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622229,"Tramp kept joking with me that I was going to zero today. I was very firm about not zeroing and leaving today, but I knew I’d probably Nero because I was really not feeling it. I still had to deal with my food bag and sort through that, and I had to cut my insoles and just organize my life lol. There was a shelter three miles from the place I had slackpacked up to, so I figured I’d just walk there and it would at least get me out of town and back on trail. Cali was planning on this too. 


All day Tramp was like “right. You’re not zeroing.” And I laughed as the day got later and later. I was accepting my fate slowly, and agreeing to another zero, but still fighting it off, as if zeros are such a horrible thing out here. I guilt-trip myself so much for zeroing or low-mileage days. But it’s not worth it to give myself that guilt. It’s stupid. I didn’t feel ready and I knew that. I did sort through my food bag, but I really didn’t feel ready. Cali was still set on leaving, even though she seemed to want to zero too. 


Eventually Cali left and I just stayed behind. I accepted my fate. Tramp and Acadicus laughed at my attempt to protest the zero, but here I was. I fell into the trap, otherwise known as the Vortex. Many have fallen into Angel’s Rest’s Vortex before, and they have a patch that they give you after three nights of staying there that says “Zerolicious”. Lol this place! It really does suck you in! They’ll slackpack you all over and they have the patch, so it’s basically meant for people to come get sucked in. We hung out by the fire and tonight there actually was one! Acadicus and I were making jokes all night and I felt like I was becoming part of the fam here. He even offered for me to come stay in his camper for free cuz he had another bunk. It was very tempting since my tent was hot and gross from the past few days, but I refused for the night.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622230,"Today I was really set on leaving. I packed up my tent and moved all my stuff inside to pack up. My rain fly was a little wet from rain so I hung it out to dry. I was really set on leaving, but Tramp said I should talk to Acadicus about slackpacking deals and staying here. Acadicus and I talked it over and he suggested I zero again today. He said that it was going to rain and it was too late to slackpack today. I was a bit more reluctant this time to zero, but I agreed. My new plan was to zero today, slackpack 20 miles tomorrow, go to Trail Days in Troutville with him on the next day, and then slackpack one more 20-mile day the next day. It would be a total of 60 miles ahead of Pearisburg, and it would allow me to go to Trail Days in Troutville, which I would’ve missed anyway since my original planned arrival date for Troutville was Sunday. 


Acadicus said I was fam and could stay in the bunk in his camper for free, so I was set on housing too. I was worried about money since the slackpacking wouldn’t be cheap, but he said I could do a work for stay for the past two nights and then wouldn’t have to pay for stay. I talked with Tramp too and it was set! I was feeling really comfortable and at home with these peeps. Ziggy was staying with Tramp and he was like family too, so we were all kind of the new zero squad here! Ziggy knew them from before. He had met them in New Hampshire on their thru-hike since he is from there. Tramp said I could clean the kitchen for my work for stay, but really deep clean. I did just that! I vacuumed, I mopped, I scrubbed the counters and moved everything off and organized it all. It was about three hours worth of work and it was a good use of time. It made me feel productive. I like to clean and enjoyed making the kitchen look nice. It got dirty very quickly though with all these hikers! Haha. 


I met some slackpackers, Noodle, No Rush, and a girl who keeps changing her name. They had done three days of slackpacking too and were really awesome. They wanted to go to Trail Days so they got a shuttle there from Angel’s Rest and were going to make the miles up later. Acadicus went to go pick them up, and I was going to come with, but I was tired and didn’t want to sit in the car for three hours. It would’ve been fun though and I think Acadicus wanted the company on his long drive, so I should’ve joined him. 


I hung out at the fire with Tramp, Ziggy, Blazer, Chug, and a guy named Pop Tart. It was a funny night, as someone brought up “a moment you pooped your pants on trail”. Most people said “nope, never happened,” but Ziggy said “well I once had an aggressive sneeze.” I’m pretty slow and literal sometimes so I thought he literally meant that he had this big sneeze and it went everywhere and it was a mess. I later understood that it was not just a sneeze. Lol. I was laughing so hard and Acadicus has pointed out that when I laugh, I squeak. And they all found it so funny they named me Pip Squeak and Noise Box. Both awesome trail names honestly, but I love my Little Debbie name. Eventually Acadicus showed up after his shuttling. He seemed pretty tired. We all relaxed and chatted for a while and then he went to bed and I went to his camper too. I’m a little anxious about the zeros, but I’m also really enjoying being with these awesome peeps, so it’s a hard balance. At least I’m going to slackpack tomorrow!

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622232,"Slackpacking! Today Chug and Ziggy left because she was just totally done. She was anxious and ready to get out. I understood. She was going to skip ahead because most of her trail family was ahead and she had had to stop. She skipped ahead to Troutville and was convincing Ziggy to go with her. He seemed hesitant, but went with her anyway. So he skipped ahead even with no injuries and it made me think I could eventually do the same if needed. Acadicus and I were literally going to Trail Days tomorrow in Troutville, but Chug decided to hitch there because she was just totally done. They left when I was out slackpacking. 


I got back to the Peter’s Mountain Trailhead and began my hike. And it rained. Oh my goodness did it rain. It’s been on and off for a few days, but today it RAINED. Chug had made eggs this morning and I had some, so I felt good with plenty of food in my belly, but this weather sucked. It was three miles to that shelter I had originally planned on, so I made a stop there when I got there. I saw Husky and Buttercup there and they were making some jokes about carrying out 5 liters of wine in a bag to a shelter in Vermont on top of Bromley one day. I wonder if they’ll do it. 


I felt poopy at the shelter, but I put some Nuun tablets in my water and the rest did me good. I headed out. It was a ridgeline for a bit, but it was super rocky. It was a big scramble for a while and it slowed me down quite a bit. I met a girl and her mom who had slackpacked one day with Angel’s Rest. The girl’s name is Executioner, but I can’t remember what her mom’s is. They were being slowed down by the rocks too they said. 


Because of the rain, it was really hard to take my phone out and call because the surface doesn’t respond to my texts when it’s wet, even though it’s a waterproof case. I wanted to keep Acadicus posted, but I couldn’t get my screen to work and it was just nonstop rain all day. There was a dip down to another shelter, and I was going to stop here, but I just decided to keep going. People were totally hunkered down in the shelter, already in sleeping bags. I could understand. It’s been days of  rain on and off and today was just nonstop. It’s a real pain. I knew I had somewhere dry to go to, but if I didn’t it would totally suck. You just get completely soaked and then you put dry clothes on and hang up your wet clothes, but then the wet clothes never dry and so you have to either put them back on and accept your fate or wear the dry clothes and get them wet too and now have nothing dry to walk in or sleep in. It’s miserable. 


I walked past the shelter and there was another climb with another ridgeline. It was really rocky again. This time I decided I needed to call or text Acadicus because I was getting closer and now I was pretty anxious. I used my toilet paper to dry off the surface of my phone, even though that didn’t last long. I was able to send him a text and he got it. He said he’d come at 6 and it was all set. I was pretty anxious though despite that. The hike downhill after this was like a muddy waterfall. I also noticed someone must have come and painted blazes here recently, because there were white drops on the ground and the blazes on the trees were running down the trees. Poor timing here! But I was thankful for the new blazes, as there hadn’t been a lot before this and I couldn’t check Guthook regularly today with the rain as it was. 


I passed by a water source and got some on the way down. I met a man who was at a shelter nearby and getting water. He had a big poncho on. I went on and it was more muddy rocky downhill, but alongside water the whole time. I got down to a meadow and figured I had to be close. I was anxious again about timing, so I used my TP again to dry my phone and check. I was still .8 and it was almost 6, so I practically ran that last .8. It was through a meadow and I was booking it. I made it down and saw Acadicus! 


I was completely drenched from head to toe. I was so thankfully I had a place to go back to. We got back to the hostel and I took a long, hot shower. We all hung out by the fire again tonight, but it was quiet without Ziggy and Chug. We had such a fun night with them before they left. But I was looking forward to another Trail Days tomorrow! And I was happy to have knocked out another 20 miles.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622233,"Trail Days!! Acadicus got up early and shuttled some people, and then we got ready to go to Trail Days! I officially moved my stuff into his camper because I had it in the kitchen since I wasn’t tenting. Tramp joked with me that I “never really cleaned the kitchen”. Um yes I did! Lol. I cleaned it and then ya know, put my stuff in it. Haha. Acadicus’ dog was my primary concern cuz she’s insane. She’s super cute, but insane. And she licks everything and I didn’t want her getting into my stuff. But I stored it well in his camper and we headed out. 


Blazer and Pop Tart came with us, which was awesome! The drive was scenic through country roads and Acadicus had an awesome playlist going. We passed by McAfee Knob and Dragon’s Tooth, and the ridgelines in between. It was very cloudy so we couldn’t see them well, but we at least got an idea. We arrived in Troutville and parked next to Odie, the Hiker Yearbook guy! He’s such a hoot. We went into his bus for a while and hung out. Tambourine showed up in her car next to us. 


We eventually got up and went over to the park. It was raining all day, which made the turnout kinda small. But it worked out because we got a bunch of free food! One lady gave me an entire box of nature valley bars! And extra sour patch kids and lots of other snacks and goodies. I got a Big Agnes hat, proud to represent! We went to the main pavilion and found Blazer eating donuts straight from a trash bag. Hiker trash at its finest! Lol I had one of the trash donuts, although I was quite suspicious of their origin. Acadicus and I went to the general store nearby and got a few treats. He tried to buy them for me, but I wouldn’t let him. I got a croissant and a brownie baked fresh from a local market. 


We walked back and found Noodle. I had some bubbles and was blowing those and she was talking to us about Trail Days and plans and whatnot. We then headed to another pavilion and sat for a bit. There was food there so we had some snacks. Acadicus wanted to go to the homeplace restaurant for dinner so we didn’t eat much here, but Blazer was concerned about paying for the restaurant, so he wanted to eat here. We all went back to Odie’s bus for a bit and Blazer ate, and then we all headed out. 


We didn’t spend long at Trail Days, but there wasn’t much going on! I think there would’ve been more on a nicer day. There was a band and plenty of tents and gear repair and free food, but not much else. The drive to Homeplace didn’t take too long. I’ve been hearing about this restaurant for a long time. I’ll be honest folks, it wasn’t my jam. There was a band playing here too, and it was a very pretty, house-turned-restaurant, but it was typical southern food. I don’t want more biscuits and beans and gravy and fried chicken on the bone. I’m just not a fan anymore lol. Sorry, this Yankee is done with southern food! 



The restaurant is one fee for all you can eat, which I guess is nice, but the food was really lacking in my opinion. There was corn, but it was watery and looked like it had been scooped out of a can, and the same was for the green beans. I like my corn and beans crispy and sautéed and this was just watery mush. There were mashed potatoes, which I also don’t like, and biscuits and fried chicken. Everyone was practically sucking the chicken off of the bones and I wanted to vomit. No bones for me lol. Yuck. I ate some, but not that much. I was pretty disappointed. A lot of hype for some pretty average food. But hey, that’s just my opinion! I can’t wait to go home and make my own food that I like!
And my opinion really doesn’t stand for most. I absolutely hate Thanksgiving food and most are shocked when they hear that. But it’s true. I think turkey is so bland and gross and gravy is gross and we just lather it all over the turkey to make it suck less, but it all is gross lol. And then we have mushy potatoes lathered on top of that and I like my potatoes crispy. And then we have slimy cranberry sauce or jelly, and stuffing, which tastes like chicken broth and I can’t stand the smell. And somehow we all heap this stuff onto a plate and devour it. I probably set a record for least amount of food eaten on Thanksgiving. Thankfully my mom understood this past year and let me cook a potato gratin, which has cheese and cream, but a bubbly, crispy layer on top. Off course everyone just took the crispy layer on top, which was annoying lol, but it was still good and I ate more this year. I won’t even go into pies and how much I can’t stand most pies. I like chocolate pie and I like Chocolate Pecan pie, and maybe Apple pie, but I really don’t like most pie. And I certainly don’t crave it. Lol the pickiest Little Debbie is here to complain! I am who I am! My future fam is doing Italian thanksgiving haha we’re gonna make lasagna, none of this bland turkey mush that people eat lol. End picky eater rant. 


I took a picture on the bench outside the restaurant and I was in a dress that I found in the loaner clothes! It was nice to feel a bit dressed up and have a change of pace. We headed back to Angel’s Rest and dropped Pop Tart and Blazer off at the hotel; they decided to leave the hostel for a night. But they both earned the patch too and had spent quite a bit of time hanging out here. 


It was quiet at the hostel and a new group of people had come in, so Acadicus and I went to bed. One more day here, then I’m really leaving the Vortex!

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622234,"Today Acadicus drove me to my starting point for my last 20-mile slack. It was through a meadow to start, and then very similar to the other day. A lot of ridgeline and rock scramble and some sliding down rocks. There were two climbs and two descents. It was raining off and on today. But it wasn’t as bad as the other day. 


I arrived at the second climb and saw the Audie Murphy monument, the first real historical place on trail. I’ll admit, I had no idea who he was, but after I saw it, it was very cool to know that he was such an important and decorated Veteran and I was seeing his monument right here on trail. Of course the reason is sad because he was killed in a plane crash here, but it was still interesting to see history on the trail like that. I’m sorry I didn’t know who he was, dad! Lol my history buff dad would probably love passing this! I sat for a bit and took it in and then called Acadicus because I was less than 4 miles away.



The downhill wasn’t too bad coming down from the monument, but it was a bit steep, and I walked out to the road and a footbridge over the water. It was raining so I just stayed standing by the bridge and then he showed up! I was a bit early. There were two folks sitting on the other side of the bridge who I had seen up at the monument. Acadicus and I drove off and it was a lot of narrow back roads with gravel. We passed a woman in her car who was not sure how to pass since it was so narrow, so she got mad at Acadicus.
Otherwise the driving was smooth and we made it back in good time. We hung out in his camper and chatted for a while. Acadicus is such a cool person. I was finding out something new about him every day while here. He plays guitar and sings and composed his own song about the trail, he draws and is quite talented, he used to be a firefighter, he thru-hiked and is planning his next one, the list goes on. I was so thankful I got to spend so much time getting to know him! He’s like family to me now.


I saw Mama Squirrel tonight when I got back! I saw her the other day at Angel’s Rest, and she had hiked out, but the rain was so long and miserable that she came back from wherever she had made it to and was showering and potentially slackpacking now. I was so so excited to see her!! I gave her a big hug and told her I hoped we could reconnect and hike together!! She’s apparently doing 15-mile days now, which is awesome!! I’m so proud of her. Tonight was chill and I had a nice time hanging with the people I was now calling family. I spent a ridiculous amount of time here, but I had so much fun and I’m so thankful for the amazing experiences. That’s what this trail is about, for ME. Maybe for the fasties it’s about making miles and getting to Maine, and fundamentally I want that too, but I want a combo of making miles and having fun like this.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622235,"Today it was time to go. I hung out for a long time though. I was actually really sad to leave these peeps. Mama Squirrel took my picture for me with Acadicus and Tramp. Some would later judge the photo for me being pictured with bearded men. Lol every damn man on the trail has a beard. Acadicus had some interesting things to say to me when we talked about his thru-hike and CT in particular. He said CT was the most judgmental state on the AT and I’m not in the least bit surprised. He walked into the two towns in CT, with boarding school students in khakis and polos and Sperrys giving him scathing looks and cars refusing to give hitches. I wish I could say where I’m from is different, but not at all. I grew up learning to judge people and being judged. I had to have the right brands, the right weight, play the right sport. It’s all bull. I’m out here on the trail being exactly who I am and no one is judging me. And I don’t judge them. I could care less if you have a beard, or a dark past, or tattoos. I’m actually more uncomfortable around the hikers that somehow look like supermodels out here and still make me feel ugly and worthless. I’m more comfortable around those who just accept me and appreciate me. At Angel’s Rest I was family to them. It didn’t matter where we all came from. The trail is like that. There are some asses out here for sure and some competition, but for the most part, everyone is so genuine and accepting. I’m disheartened that I may pass through my own state and get judged instead of helped because I look like hiker trash and isn’t that so horrible. I can’t believe I spent so much of my life being that. Doing that. My ex actually called me out on it once. We were sitting in a restaurant and I was just staring at someone, face crinkled at them. He said “why are you giving them that look?” He was such an accepting and open-minded person and he opened me up to a lot of what I was doing wrong. And judgment can definitely come from insecurity and I often found that was the case for me, but now that I’m happier with myself, I don’t need to judge to make myself happy. I’ve grown so much even in the last year and I would never have realized what I was doing without him. I’m grateful and at the same time full of so much regret for how I lived my life for so long. And I was so unhappy for long, but that doesn’t excuse how unhappy I may have made other people. Environment plays a role. As much as I loved CT, man the rest of the US is so much nicer. I’m sorry to all AT hikers who don’t get treated well passing through CT. I’m hoping the rest of the Yankee north is friendly. At least my friends and family up there are and will be helpful. I have several friends in Massachusetts, Vermont, and New Hampshire and I’m looking forward to connecting with them all!! I’ll be there I promise!! 


Anyway, I said goodbye to Tramp and Acadicus and I made the trek back to the trail. He parked and we sat by the river on the footbridge for a while. We chatted and he said he was excited for me and all the things I was going to get to see. We hugged and I headed out. And it started pouring lol. Is that a cliché? It was uphill of course and there was a shelter in one mile. That would be quite the Nero, but it was pouring. So I stopped there and decided to stay. Tomorrow I’d do bigger miles and the sun was supposed to come out, so hopefully I could make it to McAfee Knob, the view I’ve been dreaming about for so long!  


I met three other hikers at the shelter. Two were a couple, 20 milers, and one was a section hiker. We all decided to hang our food in the shelter because it was pouring and no one wanted to go out to hang it. The shelter was very far off trail also. It was a bit annoying to get that far off trail, but worth it to stay out of the rain. We all headed to bed and I was a little homesick for Angel’s Rest, but happy to be back on trail.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622236,"Big day today!! I woke up and everyone was gone, but it was 7:30 so I wasn’t that worried about it. I walked down to get water and the source was a bit far, but it  was good and there wasn’t going to be a lot of water for a bit going up Dragon’s Tooth. I had oatmeal and dried fruit and protein powder! A new addition to my morning food!! I’ve decided I need to make my muscles even stronger for these longer days, and protein powder will help!! I put it right into my oatmeal and it’s chocolate flavor so it helps. I’m going to run out soon and I don’t know if I’ll be able to keep getting it in towns, but for now it works! 


I left the shelter at a good time and got back on trail. The sun was out, but that comes at a price! It was hot. And the spiders had a lot of fun after the rain, making cobwebs all over the darn trail. I walked through a million, like walking through a haunted house. It was a slow morning of climbing, and as I got closer to Dragon’s Tooth, it was all rock scrambles. But I passed 700!! Yay!! 700 miles ahhh it felt so good!! I set up my camera to take a photo again because there was no one around. It was good to take a pack break because I haven’t had a full pack on in a week and my back was like “wait what are you doing? This thing again? Nooooo!!” 


I scrambled up the rocks and through the cobwebs up to Dragon’s Tooth! It was a bit anti-climactic. It’s a big rock. You can climb all the way up, but I’m not about to slide down and die today lol. One man I passed said it’s “not for the faint at heart”. Yeah well I’m faint at heart lol I’m a huge chicken. I climbed up a little bit of the Tooth and got a good scary view where I would’ve slipped to my death so I slowly climbed back down and off of there. I again set up my phone to take a picture because there was no one here, and then had a snack. 



The downhill. Oh my lord this downhill. I don’t like to use the word hate, but I HATED THIS. Oh HELL NO. It was awful. It was all rocks and all scrambling down. And there would be random little spots with rebar sticking out to stand on. I was so scared and panicked the whole time. Facing my fears right here on the AT. At one point it was so steep and involved a five foot drop to the next step, and I had all this weight on my back, I just cried out of sheer fear. I was shaking and so scared. Sometimes you have to take the plunge and if you don’t fast enough, you just stand there getting more and more scared. I stared at the step and cried and eventually sat down, trying to edge my way down, hearing my pack scrape the rocks as I went down. It was okay after, but the whole descent was just hell. I will never climb that mountain again unless I need to lol. The view was okay, the Tooth was okay, and the downhill needs to be greatly changed. I know the whites can have this kind of climbing too, but my lord if I can find a way to slackpack the whites, I am going to do it. Having the weight made me ten times more scared. I was so afraid the force of my pack would just take me down. This felt like the whites today, and yes folks, I know what’s coming. I’ve been up there. And I cried the whole way up Moosilauke when my parents took my little 7-year-old self up there and I’ll probably cry all the way up again lol. But the whites are also beautiful so I’m quite excited to get there.
I was feeling wiped after the downhill and didn’t know how I could do more miles today and I was still shaking from fear. But I pushed on anyway. I knew it would be worth it for McAfee. I came down to a water source and filled up and had another snack. The bugs were all over me and that was annoying, but at least it wasn’t raining. It was a little up and down for a bit and then there was a little portion through a meadow, which was very exposed and hot. I ran into Noodle though! She was hiking southbound to make up the miles from their Troutville excursion. She said Cali and No Rush and the other girl were behind her somewhere. I hiked through the meadow and was sweating buckets. It went back into the woods thank goodness. I passed two day hikers, a woman and her son, and for the first time in my trail experience, got a very interesting reaction. The woman literally plugged her nose at me, and then waved, while keeping her nose plugged. I wasn’t aware I smelled THAT bad, but I guess I do? What a reaction lol. 


I made it to the top of this climb and then it was up down up down up down and I continued on until a parking lot, where I set my pack down and took a rest. I had seen Cali and she said someone had trail magic here, but there was no trail magic to be found. I saw a few people gathered around a truck, but no one called me over and the men closed the trunk of the truck. I guess maybe it was done? I met two hikers and one of them was very encouraging. I had four miles left up to McAfee Knob and he said the climb was not too bad, but it was definitely a good climb. He said he thru-hiked before too! I love meeting hikers out here that already thru-hiked. Keeping the trail in their lives!! 


I was pretty tired and it was hot. I carried on back into the woods to start the climb. There were two shelters within the first two miles, I guess because it’s so touristy here. I passed the first. I met a man who said “going to the next shelter?” And I said “no I’m going up McAfee” and he said “oh boy!” And I was thinking ugh what is this climb? How bad is it? I passed another man who said I “looked peeved”. I guess I was struggling a bit at this point haha. It was a long day and I hadn’t put my pack on in a week and I was going through some of the hardest, rockiest terrain so far. I reached the next shelter, got some water, and used the privy. It was completely empty and it was about 6pm so I was kind of shocked no one was there. But I figured everyone was up on the knob? It was strange to see it so deserted. It was a really nice shelter!!


I continued on, passing a few people along the climb up. I listened to a podcast to get me through and it was about a woman who had an estranged mother throughout her life because apparently she was abused, but it was unclear if her memories at 5 years old were correct or if she was manipulated. It was a very interesting podcast, but I got very into it too, frustrated with the journalist who decided to investigate without the woman’s approval. I passed two people who screamed down at me that there was a copperhead on the trail. I slowly walked up, thinking every root was a snake and getting quite scared. But it was fine and I didn’t see any snakes. It must have gone across the trail and away before I got there. 



The climb wasn’t too bad the rest of the way and the podcast helped. It was rocky and long, but doable. And I was so close! And then I arrived!! There was a sign that said “overlook” and I followed it over and saw McAfee Knob!! Finally!! It was so awesome. There was an incredible view all the way across and a long rock ledge that you could walk down to see the whole view. I put my pack down and walked down the rock ledge taking pictures and taking it all in. I thought I was totally alone, which surprised me since this is such a popular spot, but I guess everyone went down before sunset. I looked over and saw that I wasn’t alone and No Rush and the girl (Rachel) were there! They were sitting in their hammock watching the sunset. I guess they took a zero here today, although they originally planned to go where Noodle was going.
Rachel took my picture, which I was so happy about because I was worried there wasn’t anyone up here before I saw them. This is the iconic AT photo besides Katahdin. The view truly was amazing, so I can understand why, but it is pretty funny to me that people get so excited for this view. I was definitely pumped. I got my iconic photo and even jumped up into the air for a shot! I had a nice time with Rachel and No Rush for a bit and I used my GoPro to walk back and forth on the ledge and take videos. It was getting dark and I was debating watching the whole sunset with them, but I decided to go on to the shelter.


It was a bit of a rocky downhill, but I finished my podcast and quickly made it to the shelter. There was no one in the actual shelter, but some tents around. I plopped my pack down to set up my tent, but it was so late I just decided to stay in the shelter. I spread out since I was the only one in there. I thought I saw Raisin, Tugs, and Tank Top’s tent, but I didn’t wanna bother them. I was hoping they’d come out and hang at the shelter, but they didn’t. I got water and the source was a bit far. I ate dinner alone and it was pretty much dark by this point. I got a lot of anxiety about eating my food and it being dark, as I’m more on the alert for bears these days. So I couldn’t eat anymore because of my anxiety. Every sound I heard made me think it was a bear and I just took all the food and put it in the bear box. I was so happy there was one! It makes sense, being the first shelter after such a touristy view. Some of the tenters were section hikers, just here to see Dragon’s Tooth, McAfee Knob, and Tinker Cliffs. 


Today was a good day, but such a long one. My feet and body were aching after the 17, but I pulled it off and I know I’m capable of doing that kind of mileage. At this point it’s a mental game. And there has to be motivation to get me through the days, even just little goals. Today I knew I’d get to McAfee and I’ve been looking forward to that for so long. It was my motivation to go 17. I probably would’ve bailed sooner otherwise. I was hiking all day and that’s what’s so exhausting about this entire experience. It’s just all day and it’s so monotonous when there isn’t a view to get to. And some people can just bust those miles every day, but it’s so hard for me. I did it today though and I have that to pull me through. Still trying to hike my hike every day.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622237,"Town! I know it’s only been a few days since I was in a town, but today I was headed to Daleville. The trail crosses the main road in town, so it’s very convenient. I still had 15 miles ahead of me though and it was going to be a long 15. This section of Virginia is so rocky and difficult and today was brutal too. Definitely not a nero into town, but I just wanted to make it to town and crush some mileage after my Angel’s Rest resting?


I headed out about 9/9:30, which is a good leaving time for me on average. It’s so hot out I may need to change that and leave earlier, but I’ll be satisfied with that leave time otherwise. It’s much better than 11 or later, which has happened a few times and is right in the worst of the heat. I talked with a woman and her daughter for a bit who were section hiking, and they headed out before me. The day started with a little more downhill, but then I had to climb up to Tinker Cliffs. It was so steep and difficult, but I made it up to the Cliffs and they were wonderful. I met a few section hikers from the area and they asked me about my trip. I got the usual “do you feel safe as a woman?” questions, but they were incredibly nice. 



They left and I decided I wanted a pic, even though this wasn’t the iconic pic. So I set my phone up on my pack and took my picture. This method seems to do the trick! I was surprised by the lack of tourists here though. It was the middle of the day now and this is one of the three main hikes and views to see in this area. There was no one but those section hikers. Hmm?
I headed down and the elevation on Guthook made it look like it was all downhill from here, but it was so rocky. It was miserable. I was scaling rocks and hopping over them and lifting my heavy pack with me and I just hated it. And I just wanted to get to town. I had a few stop and cry breaks because this is all so mental at this point. I ate a few granola bars and headed on each time. There was a moment where I laughed because a blaze was pointed going off a cliff. And I actually believed that was the trail. I was prepping to climb down this cliff after following the “blaze to nowhere”, but turned myself around to check again and saw a blaze far in the other direction on a tree. I wouldn’t put it past the founders at this point to blaze off a cliff though. Lord have mercy. 


I then listened to Road to Nowhere and more Talking Heads as I went. There was another cliff blaze moment, this time with two pointing towards each other at the cliff. Lovely! Off another cliff, you say? I was losing my mind at this point. So many rocks and cliffs and the sky was looking pretty ominous. It was definitely going to rain and I thought I’d get stuck on top of this exposed ridge scrambling over wet, slippery rocks. Maybe I would end up sliding off that cliff blaze anyway. Ugh. I was 2 miles from Daleville and still scrambling on rocks. Where’s this lovely downhill I was seeing? Oh it’s in the last mile. Just scramble for 10 miles and then it’ll go down! 



The downhill was certainly short and it was starting to sprinkle. I was incredibly anxious. And what more could happen, but an uphill! It actually went gradually up for the last little bit! I was laughing from exhaustion, annoyance, and anxiety at this point. A deer came running right in front of me on trail and I wasn’t even phased. I just stared at him and continued. Sup bro lol. The deer don’t tend to scare me anyway though, there’s plenty in CT! And we hate them cuz they eat our plants and carry ticks and I’ve had a few near hits in my car that caused a ton of panic. Go back into the woods and take your ticks away from the trail! Lol.
I finally made it to the road. Alleluia. I could see the Super 8 from where I was, and I was staying there. I had to move the reservation when I left Angel’s Rest so late, but was all set. I showed up and knew I smelled. I was drenched in my own sweat, plus the sprinkling rain. It had only been a few days, but that’s all it takes out here. I smelled horrible all over again. The manager was very helpful though. I don’t know why I had two beds, but I did. I ended up spreading out on both. Beds, shower, room, rest! I had done two very difficult days. I was proud of myself for kicking out those miles after my Vortex stay. 


I took a long hot shower and headed to this Mexican restaurant right across from the hotel. There’s always a Mexican place! Lol. I had two large frozen margaritas, and they were on sale! Score! I had pork carnitas, which were okay. The margaritas were also only okay, they kinda tasted like slushees. I ate alone, which I don’t really  care about these days, but it would’ve been nice to have some hiker friends around. I saw none in there. Ever since Pearisburg, I hadn’t seen a lot of people that I knew. Salamander was a couple of days behind, which was impressive considering I slackpacked 60 and she just hiked that regularly. But I was so anxious, I didn’t wanna zero here. I knew we’d catch up with each other eventually! 


I got back from dinner and blogged a bit, and then passed out in a hotel bed full of pillows, my heaven. I still hadn’t organized my food, but I’d do that tomorrow.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622238,"Today I woke up not wanting to leave the hotel. It’s always hard to leave such a comfy bed! I got up and went to breakfast. I still had food to sort through for my food bag and didn’t feel ready to leave, so I asked for late checkout. I accepted that if I hiked out today, it would be a nero. As I ate breakfast I watched the news and they were talking about rain. The last week in Pearisburg and out had a ton of rain. They were talking about thunder on the weather and said “if you hear thunder roar, stay indoors”. Welp, that’s not happening! I mean someone actually did get struck by lightning on trail while up on the ridge, and he had a bloody gash on his head and passed out, later trying to “walk it off” before being convinced to go to the hospital and getting 10 staples. He’s now called “Lucky Strike”. This stuff is real folks! And it’s hard because we can’t skip every rainy day out here and just go to town or we’ll never make it, but the rain can just be miserable. Your clothes are wet and they never dry, even if you hang them up. You only have one dry pair of clothes, so you have to either wear those hiking the next day and get them wet with sweat, or wear the wet ones again. And the shoes get wet and take forever to dry! And if your tent is involved, it’s heavy and soaking trying to take it down or put it up. It’s all just so unpleasant. And yeah, it’s the reality of the trail, but day after day after day of that is just miserable. We’re not indoors, having to run 5 feet to our cars to go to work, we’re out here in the thunder and the lightning, stuck on ridges while the storm wails on us, soaking wet and freezing, chafing from the wetness, and just overall uncomfortable. Again, reality of the trail, it just sucks. 


Anyway, I was lucky to have been slackpacking for a few of the rainy days, and now it was looking better for the next week. I headed back to my room and went back to bed for a bit since I had late checkout. I woke up and brought all my stuff into the lobby to organize. I was a bit stressed because I had so much food leftover, since I didn’t eat out of my food bag a lot in Pearisburg. My appetite is definitely better and I normally eat through my food bag, but this time it was just a matter of towns and eating out. So I had basically twice the amount of food I needed and it was a bit stressful. I think I had 9 mountain houses. Um yeah! I decided with all those dinners I would try to make it to Waynesboro. 


As I was dealing with all of that, two thru-hikers came by. I had seen a few older folks who looked like section or thru-hikers, and these two looked more in their 30s. Their names were Silver Fox and Three. Silver Fox sat with me for a while, somewhat shocked by my food situation. As the hours wore on and we were talking, it became clear that I might not even do a nero. We had spotted Buttercup and Husky and they were going to nero 5 miles to the first shelter. That’s what I was thinking, but it was getting late. 


Silver Fox offered for me to stay in his room for free, which was very nice, so I decided to just stay. Salamander had also texted me that she was two days behind, so I figured the zero would help her catch up to me. Three, Silver Fox, and I went to the Mexican place again. This time I got a steak quesadilla, which was very yummy. We got these massive margaritas too to split and I probably had too much. I was having a blast, but was definitely feeling it. I was frustrated that I was taking another zero, but at the same time was having a good time. It’s a hard balance. 


We ran to the gas station after that and bought more alcohol. I never ended up finishing the drinks I bought because I was just full and knew I had hit my limit. We hung out in the hotel room and watched TV and then went to sleep. The Virginia blues are definitely here folks; I’m hoping I can bust out more miles soon.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622239,"Time to leave town!! This morning I woke up feeling rough after last night. And I was feeling uncomfortable with Silver Fox. He had been very nice to let me stay in his room, but now he was creeping me out. He was using references from my Facebook to try to relate to me and flirt and I was just not interested. I’m not limiting myself in life experiences, and I’ll admit, I’ve had a lot of attention and flirting from guys out here. But I was not interested in this case. Maybe it’s because there are no girls out here, or maybe it’s because they actually like me, but I’ve been surprised by the attention on trail because I never really got that at home, unless I was using online dating. 


I kinda just wanted to move on and hike, so I told Three and Silver Fox to head out before me. Animal House was on TV as I packed up and I almost got hooked watching, but was able to leave. My food bag was pretty heavy with all the dinners and food I never ate from Pearisburg, and I packed out the alcohol that was left too. My pack was painful to pick up. But I got it on and left. It was the middle of the day, so the hottest time. But at least I was leaving. Salamander would be arriving in town today, but I needed to leave. I knew she was close now and I’d see her soon. 


About a mile or so into the day, I reached 1/3 of the way! I felt accomplished. I may have only been 1/3 of the way to Maine, but that’s more than 700 miles and it felt amazing. I needed a boost to try to get me out of these blues. It didn’t fully work, but I felt good. It was all uphill after that to the first shelter, but I was surprised at how nice the uphill was. Maybe it was because it was after the rocks and roughness of the Triple Crown in the past few days. But it was nice and smooth, with plenty of switchbacks. I rarely like uphills, but I really didn’t mind this one. 


I ran into Three and he was stopping for a smoke. It was pretty funny because the shelter was literally right after where we stopped. That always surprises me. The shelters are sometimes right there even though they feel so far away. And the trail might curve around, so you think you can’t be seen, but realize the trail is below you too and someone might walk along. The woods feel so vast, so I’m always surprised when I see the layout of the AT shelters and the trail itself. 


I was just stopping here for a break, as the next shelter was 10 out of town and that was a good distance, especially with my late leave time. Three and Silver Fox were there, Ain’t Dead Yet, and Raisin, Tugs, and Tank Top!! I hadn’t seen them all in a while! It was so nice to see them!! We all chatted for a while and then slowly headed out one by one. Silver Fox hung around for me, but I wanted to hike alone. I was honestly feeling so lousy. Despite the milestone today and the nice uphill, I was really just unhappy. I felt like I just couldn’t be out here anymore. 



The rest of the day had several ups and downs, it was not super easy. But the terrain was not rocky, so that was nice. I passed several streams. And I ran into a section hiker named Oneida, and was so excited because she reads my blog!! I introduced myself and she immediately said that she had been following my journey and was so happy I was still out here. It was so awesome to meet someone who reads my blog! I know people at home do, but this was someone I’d never met! She said she loves the reality of my entries. And that’s what I’ve tried to do for a while. I really want people to know exactly what I’m going through out here. And some things are personal, as I know the world can be a judgmental place and I’d prefer not to share. But for the most part, I share everything I’m going through.
I want to share my perspective about this trail through my entries too because sometimes I feel completely alone in how I feel. I’m quite stubborn, but I do believe that the way I’m hiking this is the way it was meant to be hiked. And I know there’s no right or wrong out here, but I really do think this trail was meant to be enjoyed, and not all about the end goal. I honestly want to write a book about my experiences someday. I have so many thoughts and frustrations about so many things. It really frustrates me that this generation seems to be so focused on the end goal. We need to do something just for that end picture and post on social media, or for the fact that we can say we did it. Are we doing anything to actually enjoy it anymore? Or just racing through life to try to one-up each other and accomplish 10 million things just to say we did? Is it for show? Is it for enjoyment? I mean geez, we have such short lives already! I would much rather have the experiences I’ve had out here and share those with the world rather than race through it and just say, yeah I hiked it. What will I remember more? The day I hiked 8 miles and stopped to hang out in a gorgeous meadow with some amazing folks or the day I walked 17 miles and killed my feet and mind pressuring myself to get there? What will I enjoy telling people about? 


I am using this blog to share my experiences, but also my opinions. And I know that there are many opinions about all that I just wrote. But these are mine. This is how I feel. This is my trail reality. Oneida was awesome and meeting her motivated me to catch up on my blog a bit. Maybe it would help me process all my recent pain too. 


It was uphill to the shelter and I did not enjoy this up, but once I got there it was nice. I set up my tent and got settled. Silver Fox offered to hang my food with his, and I did think that was nice, especially since mine is so heavy. The water source was very far down a hill, and I should’ve planned ahead because there was a source before the shelter that I could’ve filled up at. But I walked down to the shelter source anyway and filled up. The flies were irritating as I tried to filter my water, but I was efficient and took all my water back up. 



There was stuff in the shelter almost all night without an owner, which was kind of creepy. I sat with two hikers I had never met, Baby and Fish. Baby is 19, which is why he has that name. Fish is kind of a rude, abrupt person. He had never met me, and yet was making fun of me and throwing sass. I did not need or want that at all given my current mental state. I threw the sass back and then pretty much disengaged. Silver Fox sat next to me. I made a new Mountain House, chicken fried rice, but found that I didn’t like it. Another one bites the dust! Oh well. I’ve decided that the ones I don’t like I’ll just donate to hiker boxes or friends out here. I bought them all anyway, and although I don’t want to waste money, I have to accept that there’s no point carrying mountain houses that I don’t like. And my mom can just send the ones I like, but then we have a bunch of ones I don’t like sitting in my house for the next 25 years. And I could sell them on eBay I suppose, but I’d rather give back to the hikers. This has been my community and my people. I worked hard to save my money and I know some people out here have much less, even though I didn’t really make much at all when I was home. I just didn’t spend much and was careful to save. But it’s easy for me to buy a few Knorr sides to supplement and donate the mountain houses I don’t like.
Tonight Baby had some of my leftovers. He couldn’t finish them though, so I went and buried them. I know, leave no trace, but I just couldn’t eat that, and I just left town, so I wasn’t sure when I’d have the next trash can. I tried to snack on as many other things as I could. I had trouble fitting it all in my bag so I asked if I could put some in Silver Fox’s bag since we were going to hang them together. He lifted the bags like they weighed nothing, but was kind of cocky about it, later texting me that I must have liked how strong he was. Again, a bit weirded out here. 


I was itching all night, but managed to sleep.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622241,"I woke up a bit late and saw Silver Fox leave, WITH MY FOOD! Ugh. He had my lunch and a few other things that I had stored in his bag. It’s hard for me to believe he didn’t notice that when he had breakfast. I texted him all day and he teased me, saying he was going to hold it so I’d catch up. It was honestly messed up. Like it’s my food, literally you can’t just hold it from me to get me to hang out with you. I was almost not going to fight to get my food back. But I told him to drop it off at the second shelter, and I hoped he would. 


I was filled with anxiety and frustration about the trail in general, and this just added so much more anxiety. It was just food, but it felt so crappy to have this situation going on. One highlight of my morning was running into Cali, No Rush, and Rachel! They had night-hiked and were just getting moving as I was making breakfast. Rachel was doing Yoga because she teaches it at home, and they were all relaxed and calm. Exactly the type of people I needed to be around. No Rush’s name is exactly why I connect with him. We had a nice time chatting and I planned on going 15 miles today (again a mixup with Guthook vs AWOL on this one). Silver Fox was headed 17 to a campground, and I didn’t want to go there. Cali seemed set on going 15, but wasn’t sure what her buds were doing. 


Noodle showed up and we chatted for a bit and then she headed out. I headed out in the hottest part of the day. I need to stop doing that lol. But this was a cool day of views. The trail starts to run along the Blue Ridge Parkway here. And for those who aren’t purists, you could absolutely just walk the road and connect with the AT. I didn’t do that, but considered it. The road actually would’ve been hotter and the heat today was pretty unbearable. At least the AT had shade!! 


I stopped at pretty much every overlook the AT passed. I was just moving slowly and feeling depressed and anxious and miserable. I met two lovely folks, Moonshine and Juicebox. They’re a sweet couple and seemed to be having the same blues. They were stopping at every overlook too and we joked, “see you at the next overlook!” every time. They do about 15 miles a day, so the same pace I’m aiming for, and that made me feel good. They didn’t seem to be in a rush either and it felt good to meet more of my people out here. We chatted for a while and then I headed on from the last overlook. I ran into Executioner and her mom. I had met them a while ago, and it was nice to see them again! I let them hike ahead and ran into them again when they spotted a deer! They were taking some videos of it and I walked right into the video. They were cautioning me and I was scared, thinking it was a bear, but when I saw the deer I was like ehh. Another one of you! 



They were headed for the campground too, so we parted ways and I headed on. I was surprised by how many ups there were today. And it was ridiculous considering you could follow the road and there would be no straight ups and rocks, but no, let’s put the AT on the hilliest sections and make it come all the way up and then all the way down to the next road. There was another huge up after I saw them and I tried my best to power through it. It headed down after that and then I was on the lookout for water. This whole stretch didn’t have much water, and the shelter I was headed to didn’t have any. People joked that you couldn’t hate Virginia more and then it took away the water! Lol. But No Rush had said there was water at a road crossing and I was hoping it was true. I got to this road crossing and it was a pretty small stream, but there was water. I filled up four liters because I’d need some for cooking at the shelter and some for breakfast. Moonshine and Juicebox showed up and got some water too. It was tough to fill our bottles because the flow was pretty terrible, but we made it work. Another hiker, Patient Zero, showed up. He decided to just eat dinner here rather than carry water to the shelter.
I headed out, almost 9 pounds of water on my back, and put a podcast in. It was about a woman who had worked at an airport and received a lot of discrimination and harassment. It made me angry and I like when a podcast engages me that much because it helps with the uphills. But I was angry about how she’d been treated, and I was dealing with my own uncomfortable male situations on trail. There are some that happen to me later that I may or may not share, but I definitely connect to my fellow women when sometimes we just don’t want it and they just don’t get it! 


I got through the uphill with my heavy water supply and there were some more views. It was getting late, so I pushed on. It was downhill to the shelter from there, which was nice. I finished my podcast and arrived there. I got some miles in despite leaving late, and even though mentally I’m just toast these days, I was happy to have done what I did today. I settled in and had dinner. There was a man in the shelter who was a section hiker. I told him how much I respect section hikers for getting out here and getting new trail legs every time, just to have their section end when they’re adjusted. He was very friendly and I enjoyed talking to him. Moonshine and Juicebox showed up and set up their tent. Patient Zero showed up and did the same. He mentioned to everyone that he had done a 25-mile day because today was “easy terrain”. I’m sorry but UGH. *eye roll* I didn’t find today easy in any way. It was up down up down up down and the ups were hard. This goes along with this myth that Virginia is flat. Today was not flat! Gah I’m just so done with this state and so done with people saying it’s easy. I have trouble respecting his opinion and I want to be respectful, but oh my lord I did not think today was easy. UGH. I figured since the section hiker was the only other one here, I would set up in the shelter, so I settled in for the night. Also, Silver Fox had left my lunch here. He still had some of my food, but I didn’t fight it. Whatever. 


I put my food bag in the privy because it was a super nice privy. It looked almost brand new. And it was closed with a door, and that seemed bear-proof enough. There were a ton of spiders in the privy and I wasn’t really into that. Some of them were massive. I’ve seen wolf spiders on trail and I already didn’t like the little guys in my house back home haha. So I certainly didn’t like these! All I could think is that they were going to crawl up my butt while I was on the privy! Ahhh shudders. 


I fell asleep and was a bit itchy and restless, but slept alright. Can I be done with Virginia already?

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622242,"Today there was a shelter in 7, 11, or 17. I mentally wanted to make it to the far one, but would see how the day went. I got packed up and did breakfast. I was joined by a couple with a dog. I’ve seen them before at Angel’s Rest, but could not remember their names. Their dog is Bentley! Always remember the dog haha. They had a lightweight skillet and made pancakes, which was super awesome to watch. Omg! Moonshine, Juicebox, and Patient Zero headed out before me and I headed out before the couple. 


It was a steep and difficult downhill this morning after some up down up down. I ran into a million cobwebs and was frustrated. It felt like they were every five feet. People who say the cobwebs are the worst early in the morning I can’t believe because I left later and they were bad! The spiders rebuild! Lol Tramp’s story of spiders being like “fuck” every time someone walks through and rebuilding always comes in my head now. The spiders must hate us and just rebuild all day lol. Just don’t put your webs there! Like ugh! 


I got to the bottom of the steepness and there was a bridge over a swimming hole. It was so hot, I considered swimming. I went down and there was a family there and a hiker across the river in his hammock. Noodle showed up too and it was nice to see her! I decided to stay and hang out a bit. I was not feeling any motivation to hike and this seemed like a nice spot to be. It was so hot today too. The family eventually left and Noodle and I just wandered through the water. It was pretty cold. 


A mom and her boy showed up to go swimming and he was nervous about jumping in, but then he just went for it! And I felt like a total chicken because I’d been sitting there waiting to jump in and he just went for it! He was adorable. I told him I liked his water shoes and he said “awww shucks”. *melts* the four of us swam and I finally jumped in! Chicken no more! I think I got so hot from not going in that I finally got the nerve to go in! Hah. I swam over to a rock and lay down on it to dry off. My clothes take forever to dry, so I was hoping the sun would help. It was a bit cloudy so the sun wasn’t fully there. The couple and their dog Bentley showed up and were nervous to jump in too, but they went in! Their dog didn’t want to go in, but they pulled him in so he could cool off and then he swam and seemed to enjoy it. Such a cutie that dog!! 


I heard a plop and looked over and saw a snake going into the water. It swam over to where I was and popped it’s head out and stared at me. Oh hell no. Lol I was wondering how I’d get back to the shore from the rock with the snake right there. I didn’t know if it was harmful or not because the water was murky, but I didn’t wanna swim with snakes regardless! The woman and her son said a rattlesnake lived under the bridge and was there today, but this guy didn’t rattle and was too small to be one. Maybe he was a baby rattlesnake? Unclear. He finally swam under and I quickly tried to get back to the shore. The rocks were slippery underneath the water!


I got to the shore and walked around and Noodle kept swimming, but I told her about the snake and she was nervous. We decided it was time to hike on, as it was getting stormy and late in the afternoon. There was a shelter 4 miles from here. My day would be a short one, but again I was just not feeling it at all. So I decided to do that. Plus the shelter in 4 miles was known for being a nice shelter with good craftsmanship and plenty of room. I was excited to see it. 


Noodle and I packed up and headed out to the trailhead. It was immediately a huge uphill, because of course once it goes down, it has to go up! So Noodle went ahead and we took a few breaks. We were sweating buckets and totally wiped from the heat. It started to sprinkle, but didn’t rain hard. We got almost to the top and there was a group of hikers taking a break there. Everyone hiked on and it started to go downhill. It was a steep down and then a slight up to the shelter. 



The shelter was very cool! It was just like I pictured; well built, large, and by a creek. We settled in, but didn’t set our stuff up yet. There were several other hikers there and more showed up throughout the night. I’ll be honest, given my mood, I didn’t really ask anyone what their trail names were. I just didn’t want to know any more people and hear how much faster they’re all going. There was a girl and man who looked like daughter and father, but I didn’t know. And there were two girls from Maine who made me envious. They had earrings and jewelry and were thin and pretty and made me feel fat and unaccomplished. They were perfectly nice, but my insecurities were just eating me away. I had only gone 7 miles today and they had gone 20. And they were going 20 tomorrow too. To top it all off, an ultra-marathoner named Seventy showed up. He was trying to do the trail in 70 days. He does 31 miles a day or something like that. His pack is super light. I knew I’d never see him again lol. But I socialized with him anyway.There was another guy I chatted with for a bit and then one named Rain. I felt so bad because Rain had left his rain coat by the swimming hole, and Noodle and I had seen it. It was folded into the pocket so it was small, and we had taken it out to see what it was. We didn’t know who it belonged to and hadn’t seen Rain earlier. There was a campground nearby that hikers went to so we didn’t know if the owner was ahead or at the campground. We should’ve picked it up, but it’s so hard to know if you’ll ever find the owner, and it’s heavy to carry that extra weight. And Rain had hiked on 1 mile before realizing anyway so he would’ve been gone and we would’ve had to hike with the coat the next day, or leave it behind at the shelter. Anyway, he came back the 1 mile and we sadly told him his raincoat was all the way back at the swimming hole. He kept asking if we saw a “pillow” because it was wrapped up in the pocket of the coat. He decided to slackpack the 4 miles to go get it. It was a nice coat and not cheap, so he really didn’t want to lose it. I suggested he call the campground because they have a shuttle that goes to the swimming hole and maybe they could pick it up and hold it for him, but I think he just ran to get there instead. When he got there, someone named Slow Poke had picked it up and was across the river, so he went to ask if he had seen a pillow, but since we had unfolded it, there was a lot of confusion. Slow Poke had seen the raincoat and gave it to him and it was all good! Slow Poke had added 8 miles of slackpacking onto a 17 mile day, craziness! He got back around 9pm.I set up my tent inside the shelter, which is know is kinda goofy, but the bugs have just been so bad and they’re eating me up when I sleep in the shelters. So I figured it was just a big bug net! It was a big enough shelter that I put my tent there and there was still a ton of room on the first and second level. Noodle set up in the corner. We ate dinner and chatted with folks for a bit, and Noodle and I opened up a bit about stresses and pains we were going through. We had some moonshine too! It was a hot night, and it rained a bit, but not as much as we expected it would. Unfortunately, my sleep pad made a lot of noise. I don’t understand why it makes more noise some nights than others. It was so loud tonight. Maybe there was too much or too little air in it? Or maybe it was having my tent in the shelter and the rubbing? Unclear haha. I felt so bad though. Hikers complain a lot about things like this and I completely understand and I didn’t want to be “that person” and have that loud pad, but I didn’t know what to do tonight. I got up to pee in the middle of the night because I really had to go, and two people woke up to me moving, even though I was trying to be so quiet. I also used my red light because that’s the respectful thing to do. But one girl said “ahh what’s happening?” And I was just frustrated because I was just trying to go pee. Ugh what a frustrating time. The trail is really not my jam right now; I am totally having the blues.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622244,"Another short day today. Noodle got out around 9/9:30 and I was pretty much ready, but I had spotted the girl that had exclaimed last night when I walked by and it turned out to be Cali! I stayed to chat with her. Turns out there’s been some drama with her and No Rush and Rachel and Noodle. They were a trail family, but they were having some issues. Cali told me a bit and Noodle had also told me a bit, so I was just there to listen. I didn’t have any issues with any of them so I just listened and planned to hike with whoever was there to hike with. 


Cali and I chatted for so long that I ended up leaving in the worst part of the day. It was so hot. Today was 92 degrees. And the day started with an uphill and that uphill crawled up and up for 9 MILES before finally going down. It was just death heading out knowing I had to get up that massive and long up while it was so hot. I was purely miserable. And it was mainly mental because I was hating the idea of this long uphill, but the heat didn’t help me physically. I was draining through my water. I hiked slowly and passed through a ton of greenery, or the “green tunnel” as some hikers call it. The spiders had had a field day and I was walking into web after web after web. It added to the misery and I was just so done. I sat on a rock and just sobbed. I wanted to quit and leave and just be done with this trail. It’s so long and so hard and monotonous and hot and just too much. I almost needed a reset.


I didn’t see Cali coming after me so I figured she was struggling too. There was no one on the trail, which must have been why the webs were so bad. Normally people clear them out. I felt so alone. I got to a shelter that was 5 miles from the last and I sat down. I was alone. It was sprinkling rain and I was miserable and so I sat to wait it out and wait for Cali. I was hoping she wouldn’t go past this shelter without stopping in. A few boys came in after already having hiked 18, and they were headed on even further. Great. I don’t remember their names. It started to pour and they sat with me to wait out the rain. I basically decided I was staying. I was truly miserable. This was just the worst I had felt on my entire hike and I didn’t want my trail experience to be this way. It was just not what I came out here for. 



The boys left and another man showed up. He set up in the corner and we chatted. It was just the two of us. I sat and waited, almost paralyzed with my unhappiness, and waited for Cali. She showed up a bit before dark. She wanted to night hike and I was not sure I wanted to. I really wanted to do more miles, but just couldn’t move. I was just done. We ate dinner and it started to get dark, and I heard a rustle, and a mouse came scurrying right next to my foot. I screamed and stood up and the mouse ran over to the man in the corner and he woke up. Ugh yuck! I knew they were coming to the food we were eating, so I told Cali we needed to get rid of our food. We packed it all up in our food bags and hung it in the shelter, and the mice didn’t seem to be a problem after that. We were more motivated to night hike after the mice, but we decided to stay.
We set up our stuff and went to sleep. I was hot and itchy from bug bites so I didn’t sleep well, but I slept.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622247,"The last of these short days before town. The heat was horrible again today and Cali and I again left too late. I was enjoying being with her because she’s very similar to me and I like No Rush and Rachel too, but we were both having a hard time. We saw Slow Poke and we asked if he was a thru-hiker and he said “I ain’t thru yet!” True that! He saw the mouse nest, which I hadn’t noticed until now, and he said he was going to move it. For some reason, Cali couldn’t deal with that and she flipped out. I wanted him to move it because mice are gross, but I tried to stay out of it. Cali threw her pot on the ground she was so angry. To be honest, as much as I really like Cali, it felt a little immature. She was really exploding and he wasn’t even harming the mice, just moving the nest. I’ve put so much work into changing how I react and handle situations and it was almost like I was seeing my old self, flipping out. When my blood boils like that I have gotten better at calming myself down and I was trying to calm Cali, but she just took her pack and went.
Slow Poke moved the nest when she was gone. I couldn’t have cared less if he killed the mice. Mice are full of disease and they’re in a home that was made for humans out in nature. Yes this is nature, meant for the mice, but it’s also a shelter made for humans. It’s our home too. I hate mice and seeing that one run across the floor grossed me out last night. I didn’t understand Cali’s reaction, but I supported her side and knew that she just wanted the mice to have a safe home too. 


I left next and Slow Poke stayed. It was uphill of course because I never made it to the top of the 9 miles. I walked behind Cali and she kept a good pace. When we got to the bottom of the last climb, we hiked together and motivated each other. She kept talking about town and chicken nuggets and all sorts of food that she liked and I talked about it all too and we just used food as a distraction from the pain of the hills and the heat. It went by faster and we made it to the top. There was no view. 9 miles folks, and no view. Literally f*** Virginia lol. There was something beyond the trees, but it was pretty much completely blocked by trees. 


Whatever, at least we were going down now! We sat for a sec to get service and screamed “I want chicken nuggets” and were hoping someone would magically drop them to us. Negative on that one. We saw one woman named Prim, and chatted for a moment, although I was on my phone and not really interested in social interaction. I had been before every social interaction involved “how many miles did you do?” “Yeah I’ve already done 4,000 miles today, gonna do about 20,000 more” “when’d you start?” “Oh I started yesterday, made record time to get here”. Yeah I just can’t deal with anyone right now. 


A young boy passed us named Thumper. He said his Uncle had Trail Magic ahead, so Cali and I moved on. She went ahead of me and was booking it. We were about to pass “The Guillotine”, and I had seen pics of it, so I was excited. It’s basically a huge boulder that’s stuck between two rock faces. I was thinking back to watching 127 Hours in the hostel in Hot Springs. Don’t fall on me boulder! Haha. I was alone when I got there so I set my phone up in my pack and timed a few photos. I then headed on to the road! Trail Magic! Yay! The Uncle was nice, but seemed a little critical of my pace; he had hiked it last year. Thumper was 19 and section hiking with his Uncle for the summer. There was another man, Red Bush; he had a big red beard. Cali asked how he got his name and people chuckled a bit. I’m slow too sometimes haha. 


We chatted for a bit and headed on to the shelter, which wasn’t far. We got there and I pretty much knew I was staying. It again looked like it was going to storm and I was anxious, and I was just so miserable these days. I set up my stuff and so did Thumper and Red Bush. Cali thought she’d hike on, but ended up staying. Thumper and I really clicked and were having a fun time looking at goofy memes and joking around. He’s basically a stereotypical 19-year-old boy. I tried to blog a bit, but he kept showing me memes haha. Some of them were kind of offensive, and he was from South Carolina, so I feel like he was not used to some of the political correctness stuff I’ve seen in college up north. Some of the stuff he showed me made me cringe. Boys would make those kind of jokes in my hometown before people starting speaking up about political correctness and watching what you say. 


Given Cali’s views, I was a bit worried about Thumper and what he was saying, but it seemed to be fine. We all went to sleep. Cali unfortunately didn’t hang her food bag, and she got hungry late at night so she snacked on it, and then left it by her head. Guess who came to enjoy it?! The mice. They ran OVER ME to get to her food and then back to their nest. It was all night and I was about to lose it. It was filthy and I was not into it. I eventually just picked up my sleeping stuff and moved it in between Red Bush and Thumper. Thumper woke up and we chatted and were going to wake up Cali and hang her bag, but we decided not to bother her. It was amazing to me that she didn’t wake up to the mice. 


Another short and hot day on the trail, but at least I’m still going. It’s such a challenge these days, but I’m trying my best. One day at a time.

",Thunder Hill Shelter,"Jun 18, Tue",5.30
Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622256,"Today was close to being a town day. I was 15 away from Glasgow, VA. I actually got out early! I didn’t sleep at all. The food bag and mice situation just kept me up all night. Thumper got up at 6 and headed out at 7, and I headed out at 8. Not bad for me!! I was happy about it!! But unfortunately I got derailed. There was Trail Magic! And it had ICE CREAM and soda and chocolate milk. I bonded with the guy doing trail magic and we smoked a bit. I have kinda let my guard down on the weed front out here to be honest. I had only done it a few times in college, but it’s so popular out here, I just decided to join in. It’s relaxing sometimes and especially when hiking is just painful and hard. I probably had too much this time and had a hard time getting going. 


So I had my early leave time, which was awesome, but now I was delayed. Ugh. I got out and had to deal with all the cobwebs, but was in my own world so it wasn’t so bad. When I was about 9 miles from town I called the hostel in town and they said they don’t pick up after 5:30. I would probably get there around 6. I was pretty disappointed that they weren’t more flexible with me. Thumper’s Uncle was going to pick him up, and I saw him at the trail magic, but I said I wouldn’t make it til late so he shouldn’t wait. So I thought I wouldn’t have a ride into town from the trailhead and the hostel owner suggested I stay at the shelter two miles from town and then catch the 8am shuttle in, so I decided to do that. 


It was mostly downhill, but there were a few climbs today. One being High Cock Knob. What a name. Lol. People on Guthook had the funniest comments. “1.2? I’ve climbed higher” “ready to mount the high cock!” Lol I’m sorry, it was just funny. What kind of name is that?! Big Butt Mountain, Fullhardt Knob Shelter, now High Cock Knob. And get this, the name of the gap before the Knob was “Petite Gap”. Lol. I’ll be honest folks, this climb was a dick. It totally sucked lol. It was steep and annoying. Would never climb again. Haha. But the downhill after was nice. A bit steep, but nice. It seemed like it was going to storm yet again. Every day it’s just been really hot with afternoon thunderstorms. I’m used to that summer weather, but it’s so unpredictable and annoying to hike in. I got to the shelter and there was a woman there, Stargazer. She’s awesome! She’s out doing a long section and calls herself a LASHER. It was just the two of us and she said Thumper had passed by and said he’d wait with his Uncle til 5. It was 5. I had told them not to wait so I was hoping they weren’t waiting, but it was 5 now and I wasn’t making it two more miles in time for either shuttle. I just kept with my plan to stay. I really had wanted to get into town and get a ride and hang more with Thumper, but the Trail Magic really slowed me down and Iost probably two hours of hiking right there. 


I accepted my fate and set up my camp stuff. Slow Poke showed up and now it was just the three of us! It started to pour and we all settled in for the night. A couple came by and stopped for a minute, and then kept hiking. I was glad I hadn’t tried to do those last two miles; I would’ve gotten stuck in the rain for sure. And without a ride for sure, I’d have to try to hitch in the rain and it would just be unpleasant. I planned to get up early and make it to the trailhead by the 8am shuttle. I ate dinner and chatted with them for a bit. We all hung our food inside the shelter because of the rain. I was sad I was missing town with people I enjoyed hanging out with, but I knew this was the best option. Town tomorrow!

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622259,"Today I woke up early! I got up at 6! I was motivated and had a bar for breakfast instead of oatmeal. I was efficient and got out a little bit before 7. It would be a little tight timing-wise, so I was hiking quickly. Slow Poke stayed behind and Stargazer hiked ahead of me. The map made it look like the 2 miles would be flat, but it wasn’t at all. It was rocky and up down up down the whole way. I was going fast and found it hot, even this early in the morning. I got to a bridge, the James River Footbridge, and walked across. The water was crystal clear. The bridge wasn’t the most attractive bridge, but it was cool to see. The trailhead was right after, and Stargazer was sitting taking a break. 


While we waited and chatted, Thumper and his Uncle Rick showed up so he could continue hiking. They said they had waited for me until 5, and I felt so bad. I really had hoped they wouldn’t, and I told Rick not to wait when I saw him at the Trail Magic. Thumper walked by without saying much and Red Bush sat for a moment. Rick seemed frustrated about the previous night. He had told the hostel owners that I was coming, so they reserved a bunk, but I literally called them myself and they said to stay in the shelter and come in in the morning, so they knew I wasn’t going to make it. But it was a big to do and everyone was confused. It’s hard because I had no service at the shelter last night and couldn’t update anyone. But it is what it is. 


As frustrated as he was, Rick offered us a ride back to town. The shuttle wasn’t showing up even though they told me it comes at 8, so he ended up taking us. He has a Honda Pilot and that made me homesick because we have one at home. Such a good car! He had a camper behind it that he uses to camp while he follows Thumper along on the section hike. He dropped us off at the hostel. He was a bit sassy and said “maybe I’ll see you again, but at the rate you’re going Little Debbie, probably not.” Stargazer and I both cringed and I did not like that comment at all. But he was nice to give me a ride, so I brushed it off and went inside.


And saw Ain’t Dead Yet!! I haven’t seen him in a few days! He was doing a work-for-stay at the hostel, so he was checking us in. I reserved a bunk and unfortunately all the bottom ones were taken, so I chose a top bunk and hung out. I tried to do some blogging since I’ve been so far behind on that. I went to lunch at this restaurant in town called Scottie’s, and treated myself to chicken fingers! Worth the wait for those nuggets I tell ya! Haha. I went to the Dollar General and got some stuff to cook for dinner since the hostel had a nice kitchen. 


I weighed myself today, and found out I’ve lost 30 pounds. Weight is an extremely sensitive topic for me and I’ve struggled with it all my life. I will forever be bothered by the way we idealize people like Kim Kardashian in this society and think we need to have her massive butt and tiny waist. Jeans are hard enough lol I don’t need a bigger butt. Haha. But seriously, it’s so ridiculous to me. Why should it matter so much how much makeup we wear, how thin we are, etc? I feel most beautiful when I’m caked in makeup, I’m thin, and my hair is straightened and that’s just not right to me. It shouldn’t be that way. Honestly I just want to be a healthy and happy me. I’m mostly happy about this weight loss because I’m healthy. As I’ve talked about, my last year of college was just horrible and the breakup and everything else I went through put me at rock bottom and a heavier weight. I needed to be at rock bottom because that’s the only way we grow. It was a wake-up call and a growing period. But once I worked on it with my therapist and myself, I was happy before I left for the trail. And I was 30 pounds heavier, but happy. Let’s repeat that. 30 pounds heavier, BUT STILL HAPPY. Again, I’m now lighter, but healthier. That’s what matters to me.


It has been hard for me to lose weight in the past. I’ve never actually asked about my metabolism or checked that out, but I do think mine is rather slow. It just takes forever to lose weight. And I still end up with relatively large thighs, even after losing weight. Yeah I know, muscle gain, but still, there are times I’ve exercised every day and still been heavier than this. Am I going to have to hike 10 miles a day from now on after the trail to stay thin? I was going to the gym for an hour or more everyday before the trail and I didn’t lose the weight then. I just stayed the same. It’s such a struggle. And it sends me spiraling because all I can think about is how I’ll gain all of this back after the trail and people will call me fat again and I won’t be able to take the weight off. It kills me. I’m happy now and I was happy then. But I’m healthier now at this weight. I don’t run out of breath going up stairs. I can easily be active. It’s nice. And I don’t eat as much as I should on trail, so I literally feel like I can’t eat anything at home and that also kills me. I fear I’ll get an eating disorder from missing the body I have now. I don’t know what I’ll do. But I can celebrate this right now and feel healthy and strong. For right now, that’s all that matters. The future is uncertain, my body will change a million times as I get older. But right now, I’m happy and healthy. And 30 pounds lighter and somehow a bit more free from all the weight that was dragging me deep into my depression last year. The load is finally off? I’m free? But somehow there’s still more weight being piled on. It’s like my pack is symbolic for the pressures I feel out here. But I guess I will carry that burden as I work through it.


I sat on the couch and watched some TV with Ain’t Dead Yet and Stargazer. We watched Black Panther, which I haven’t seen until now, and The Office. Ain’t Dead Yet made BREAD. HOMEMADE BREAD. Omg YESS!! I left to do my errands and came back to the smell of fresh bread. It was delicious. He’s quite the cook! Salamander texted me and Cali was in contact too. I wanted to do some slackpacking from here to Waynesboro, because Stanimals has two locations. Cali was interested in that, but decided not to. Salamander had a friend in Lynchburg who could potentially slackpack us too. She was a day behind me so it meant I’d have to zero tomorrow too. I was really feeling the pressure of the trail, but I also wanted to hike with her and thought it would be fun to see her friend, so I told her I’d wait for her. 


As I was hanging out, some new folks came in. One of them was named The Champ because he carries a big wrestling belt with him on trail. We had a lot of good conversations. There was a group of older folks who were slackpacking for several days and they were quite a hoot, snapping at each other like an old married couple. I made spaghetti for dinner and it was very yummy, but I couldn’t finish it all, so Ain’t Dead Yet finished it for me. The Champ and I stayed up talking for a while and I had the wine I bought at Dollar General and some cider gifted by another man hanging out at the hostel. Two girls walked in and stayed upstairs. 


I found the massage chair and made a home for myself there haha. I think I sat through 10 cycles. I wish it massaged more of my upper back and neck, as it was mostly middle back and a bit of lower, but it was still nice. My posture is so terrible these days and my back is just a big curve because of all that weight, so I hope the massage helps my poor back muscles relax. It was a pretty low-key, chill day, but I had a nice time chatting with everyone and liked this hostel quite a bit! I listened to Midnight Rider and relaxed. I’m looking forward to seeing Salamander tomorrow!

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622260,"I slept in this morning because I knew I was meeting Salamander and it would be another zero. Stargazer was going to slackpack or zero as well, so we chatted for a bit. We discussed the sections she’s hiked and she told me about the whites and the rocks and scrambling there. She’s done quite a bit of hiking through some difficult sections! Another inspiring woman  on my journey out here. And speaking of, I am giving women another chance haha. I really enjoy Salamander and I think we’d make a great team. I’m definitely still a bit bitter about what happened with Hot Sauce and the general competitive, judgement feeling I get with women out here, but Salamander is just lovely. She’s hilarious and sweet and my age, so we enjoy a lot of the same things. I can’t predict how the rest of the trail will go, but I’m opening my mind again to this partnership and friendship, as pained as I am from the past one I had on trail.



The Champ walked to Dollar General and the General Store with me to get some breakfast. The General Store was definitely pricier and honestly that’s hard for me, because I want to support the small business, but my pocket book is already screaming at me. I ended up getting food from Dollar General. I’m sorry small business! They had some cute quote plaques, the kind that people have in their homes that say “live love laugh”. Yes I’m one of “those people”. A cheesy quote fart. No I don’t have them all over my room (anymore) haha. I actually can’t peel the “live love laugh” off the wall of my room without the paint coming off, so live love laugh gosh people! The three best things! Haha. There’s one about dancing in the rain and storms or something, but after the AT, no dancing in the rain thank you very much. Look at my little idealist slowly turning into a realist-self. It has been funny for me to see that change in myself. Sometimes ya can’t just LIVE LOVE LAUGH. Lol.
I did like the quotes, but it’s a little hard to put a big plaque on the back of my pack, so I’m sorry again to the small business. The Champ and I walked around, spotting a lovely empty box of condoms on the ground near Dollar General. The beauty of the trail right here! We took pictures with the dinosaur. Such a weird and interesting thing to have in this tiny town. We went back to the hostel and hung around while I waited for Salamander. The Champ was waiting on a box so he had to stay the day too. 


Salamander texted that she was at Scottie’s, so I packed up all my stuff and walked to Scottie’s to meet her. The Champ came along. When we got there, she was at a table with a girl named George (like Nancy Drew’s best friend!) and a guy named Rukus. He is a hoot. Rukus has a tattoo on his chest that says “bring the mother fucking Rukus”. I don’t know how much I need to say about him more than that lol, you really get the picture from that alone. But he has been through quite a lot and “died” on the table several times and had testicular cancer and has one ball, which he seems somewhat proud of? I’m pretty sure everyone on the trail knows Rukus has one ball. Random person: “oh Rukus, the guy with one ball?” Lol. He’s definitely been through it all, but is now living life to the fullest I guess? There were a bunch of other hikers in the room and we all chatted a bit. I thought I was hungry enough for two things, but I’m always too ambitious with how much I order. 


Also I’m not Italian, but it really bugs me when people bake pasta and don’t brown the top! Like ugh! You need to brown the top! Lasagna, baked ziti, etc. is not good if there’s no bubbly crispy cheese on top! I like my texture peeps. I need some crisp on top of all that mush. And this place had almost no brown on top of my baked ziti. I wished I had a blow torch and could just brown the top myself lol. I’m sorry if I’m offending Italians! Just my personal preferences! 



The pizza was also not browned, just white melty cheese. What pizza is not browned on top? That’s an atrocity lol. I couldn’t finish either one, so I just got them boxed, even though I doubted I’d eat them later. Salamander’s friend showed up, Nancy. She’s lovely. She brought along two friends from Brazil that she had met when she was down there. It was their first time in the states, which was so exciting! She spoke Portuguese with them. We all hopped in the car and headed to Nancy’s home in Lynchburg. Her boyfriend Will was there when we got back and he’s awesome too! Salamander and I put our stuff in our room and hung out for a bit. Nancy and Will made a delicious dinner of roasted chicken, veggies, and salad. It was all fresh food from the market nearby and for dessert we enjoyed some fresh watermelon!!
We sat outside and could hear the neighbors’ kids playing nearby, and it truly felt like a classic summer night. I am missing those nights. Back home we’d grill out meat and corn and sit outside, listening to the crickets and drinking wine and enjoying the night. I’m not a huge fan of summer itself, because it’s always too hot. The heat has been hard for me on trail, and even though the cold can be hard too, I prefer the cold over the heat any day. My family went to the beach every summer and as much as I enjoyed the beauty of it, it was always just way too hot sitting in the sand for hours baking away. I’m more of a fan of the cool lake vacation, which we did do a few times to see my cousins in Maine. I opted for that over the beach, but we definitely had that attachment to the beach, so that usually won for vacation. Everything has its ups and downs right! Definitely don’t like the heat, but still miss those summer nights. 


We all headed in for the night and Salamander and I debated what we’d do the next day. We had several options. Will’s family had a lake house nearby that they were going to the next day. So we could go back to the trail before they left for that, or go back to the trail the next day and come to the lake. Decisions decisions! Let’s rest on it!

",Glasgow/Lynchburg ,"Jun 21, Fri",0
Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622265,"Salamander and I woke up and had to make our decision about what we were doing for the day. Both of us really wanted to go to the lake, but we were also feeling so much pressure to get a move on and hike. We decided on a big decision, and to my readers, if you disapprove of this decision, I don’t want your input. I’ve thought long and hard about this and struggled with it. I do not want or need any more criticism about how I’m hiking my hike. I’m so sick of it. Everyone has an opinion and they are entitled to it. But for my sake, please keep it to yourself. This is my journey and my decision. I did not come this far to be torn down. Nothing is ever good enough these days. It’s absurd. 


I’ve hiked almost 800 miles. That is a huge accomplishment. It’s good enough. I am clearly susceptible to criticism, as I’m a pretty sensitive person. And most people have told me that in my life as if it’s a bad thing. So it’s a bad thing to have feelings? It’s a bad thing to care? I have tried so hard to shake things off and I’m getting much better at it. I know the world will throw much more criticism at me. I know people will continue to judge me. I know people will still put me down and tell me I’m not good enough. I know it doesn’t get any easier. But I have sustained enough criticism in my life to think I was not worthy of being here, and I’m DONE. I am living my life the way I want to live it. I am hiking my hike the way I want to hike. I am HAPPY. Do not take away my happiness. Please allow me this time to actually enjoy who I am and what I’m doing. Going back to elementary school, if you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say it! I wish adults would somehow remember that phrase they try to teach kids. Hey kids, be nice when you’re young, but when you’re older you can be a huge ass hole! Lol. Aren’t all kid lessons somehow adult lessons too? Can’t we all learn a bit from each other? No, I don’t want to just bake a cake full of rainbows and smiles and have everyone be happy. We’re all bound to have painful times and feelings, and we’re bound to hate each other and envy each other and struggle. I am guilty of judgement and jealousy and anger and hate and all of those horrible things I wish I didn’t do. We’re all human, we all do it. But please, stay out of my hike if you don’t agree with how I’m doing it. I need the mental and emotional space to get through this, and as if my mind and emotions were not challenged enough by a 2,192-mile hike, your mean opinions just make everything worse. 


Salamander and I have decided to skip a section and come back to it after we reach Katahdin. This is actually a very common decision this year, as many are feeling the pressure of getting there before it closes. And many are realizing that this trail doesn’t have to be done in a linear way. The ATC will recognize you as a thru-hiker if you complete the entire trail within a year of starting. People go north, south, and flip-flop this trail. There are many ways to do it. I was putting myself in a box and convincing myself there was only one way or the highway. I’m very stubborn, in case you didn’t know. Lol. But putting myself in this box limited me and hurt me. I was so convinced I had to do it a certain way that I was just miserable. Did I come out here to be miserable? Hell no. Did I save my money, buy all of this gear, and take 6 months off of work to be miserable? No. I know the real demon I’m fighting here is myself. I don’t want to skip, but I also want to make it to Katahdin. I can’t have both if I continue to hike the way I want to hike; there just isn’t enough time. But it’s a bigger battle when I have strong opinions from other thru-hikers, day hikers, non-hikers, random blog readers, etc. so again, now that you know my decision, please GTFO if you don’t agree. I’m already having a hard enough time with this. I feel like it’s eating me away inside. 


Salamander and I seemed to be struggling mutually, but we both had considered doing this and now we were just following through. We knew we’d have an amazing time at the lake and couldn’t wait to do that. It’s an experience that doesn’t come often and for thru-hikers, it’s a real treat to spend some time off trail like that. We told Nancy our plans. She and Will were very supportive. We all went to the Farmer’s market for breakfast and I got a bagel and a fresh donut, so yummy! And I got some carrots as well. I love carrots. Definitely a fave veggie. Cooked or uncooked. Haha. 


Salamander bought peaches, and Nancy got some meat, watermelon, and corn. I love corn too! Carrots and corn, love them both so much! We packed up our stuff and drove to the lake! It was a beautiful day and a scenic drive to the lake. We stopped at a gas station and Salamander and I picked up some alcohol. She’s goofy and fun and wanted to “ice” people with Smirnoff Ices. I actually think that’s a really fun game. Some stuff in college I could go without doing, like beer pong or other messy drinking games, although I had fun doing them in college. But icing people is just funny. Watching their reaction is the best part! I didn’t really know that Will’s family house would be the place for this lol, but I bought the ices anyway. I’ll admit, I actually like the flavor of them! I love my sweets! 


I also got hard cider Rosé. That stuff is gooodddd. I love wine, but hard cider is good too! I’ve had a lot more of that and beer on trail. I always thought it was an acquired taste and I definitely like it more as I get older. We kept driving and arrived at the lake! It was a beautiful home on the water, with a huge dock and a spacious living room area to hang out in. It was awesome! We put our packs in the basement, where we were sleeping on bunk beds! We got in our sports bras and shorts and went down to the dock to swim! We blew up an inflatable paddle board and brought that down. Salamander and I tried to get on it together, but I am a total chicken, so that wasn’t working. I was so scared. Again with that fear factor and being afraid of getting hurt or falling off, etc. I’ve been on paddle boards before, but once I stayed on my knees for an hour because I was so scared to stand up and my knees were not happy about it. 


I need to trust myself a bit more though. I went out with my friend last summer and even took photos for him while standing on the paddle board. But somehow I was scared this time. And Salamander can be a bit playful, so I was worried she might tip it! I sat on the dock and unfortunately ripped a small hole in my boxers! Dang! I actually got a splinter in my foot too from walking around on the dock, so I hopped upstairs to get a needle to take it out, which worked! I’ve never taken a splinter out, but hey here we go! I headed back down, with shoes, and sat on the chairs, looking out at Salamander and our Brazilian friends, who were also trying out the paddle board and a small kayak. Salamander convinced me to jump in, I was again being a chicken. I jumped in and it was very refreshing! I got back out and dried off for a bit, blogging somewhat and just hanging out. It was the perfect relaxation I needed. 


At one point, Gabriel’s mom fell in and everyone rushed to make sure she was okay. That’s the fastest I’ve ever seen someone pull out a kayak and paddle! But she was fine and we all relaxed for a bit. We went back up to have dinner. Will and his dad tore down the shed outside, as they’re preparing to build an addition to the house to be more accessible for family members. We all helped move the wood and such into his truck. Will’s dad is awesome. He’s so funny. I was constantly entertained all day. He just throws out these hilarious jokes or one-liners and it’s so great. I felt like I could really be at home with him and was just cracking up. That’s the best kind of company, I tell ya! 


For dinner, we had corn, brats, and veggies. It was delicious! A wonderful summer meal by the lake, which is what I had been truly missing. I had some of my ices and my ciders, but we didn’t ice anyone. Although everyone was so chill and awesome here, we totally could’ve. A woman named Sue joined us for dinner and watching her interactions with Will’s dad was so great. They gave each other shit and had been friends for so long and I loved seeing that closeness and humor. 


We played Mexican Train. I learned this game with my ex’s fam and I enjoy it so much. Will kept trying to cheat and make trains everywhere and I again was just cracking up. And then we just ended up changing to dominos because the train was going two ways and it was definitely not right, but no one could remember the rules and we were all just having so much fun. And Will’s dad had some ice cream, and it was the best flavors!! He had chocolate and mint chocolate chip. A man after my own heart! No one ever buys those flavors! It’s always vanilla or some fruity thing. I was so happy and ate a ton. And we had a peach dessert as well, that was delicious. I’m normally not a huge peach fan, but I thought it was wonderful. 


I had the best day today, and was surrounded by such wonderful company. I have not laughed so hard all trail. I need Will’s dad to come along and crack jokes the whole time, he’s so awesome. I am so happy with my decision and I am thankful to this wonderful family and Salamander for taking me in for the night and allowing me to make such sweet memories and laugh my heart out.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622270,"Today we had breakfast made by Nancy and Will. They are so wonderful! They made eggs, sausage, and pancakes! It was all delicious. Gabriel woke up late and I was happy I wasn’t the last one up. I hate being the last one up. This always happens to me on vacations. Everyone thinks, “oh she’s so peaceful, we’ll let her sleep”. Don’t let me sleep! I don’t like that! I feel like I’m missing out! And then I wake up and everyone’s been up doing things for hours and I’ve missed it all! Wake me up! Lol y’all know I’m a deep sleeper and I sleep late, so I can’t get myself up easily. But I know you can! But everyone was chill and easy going and I was up with the crowd, so it was good! 


We hung out a bit today, but we were going to leave and go back to Glasgow I think in the afternoon. I spent some time on the dock and organized my stuff and blogged a bit more. And then we were off! Nancy drove us back to Glasgow. We had her drop us off at the shelter in town that was built for hikers. It was free and we knew we probably wouldn’t hike out today. We stopped at a view on the way and took a picture together! We tried to do piggyback, but were sliding a bit and quickly jumped down after the pic! Nancy was so wonderful all weekend and it was such a treat to stay with her and Will and our Brazilian friends. I was sad to see her go, but was very thankful for all she did! 


Salamander and I discussed the plan for the next day, and I said I wanted to slackpack. Salamander doesn’t tend to slackpack, so unfortunately I was starting to see an issue in this new partnership. I really wanted to be with her, but I slackpack a lot, and if she doesn’t want to, we may have a problem. But she seemed receptive for tomorrow, so I went ahead and booked it with Stanimals. At the shelter, we found ourselves with Rukus and several other partiers, including a girl named Cut-Off because she drinks too much, Real because she is almost too harsh and real with people, and Blazer, who I had missed seeing! 


We all drank quite a bit, and I wasn’t peer pressured, but I certainly felt like this was a party spot. And I was seeing us being sucked into the party and my anxiety levels about how far behind we were and all that just skyrocketed. But for the night, I let us have fun. I didn’t want to be a Debbie Downer! Haha. There was a ton of weed and alcohol and all that going around. I chatted with a section hiker who was critical of my decision to skip up, so screw that. But I stood my ground and said that it was my hike and left it at that. He did play some interesting music and we discussed that. I was a little disappointed in myself for how much I’ve forgotten since I graduated. It’s too bad. Not that I was necessarily going to use it anyway, music was always just an enjoyable thing, not necessarily a career. But still... 


I did actually have a moment tonight that made me thankful for my love of music. I picked up someone’s guitar and began playing a few chords. And then I started to sing, which I never do in public because I really have stage fright, but I sang. And people started coming over and standing by me in a circle. I was nervous and stopping singing because I was embarrassed, but one of the girls said, “no please keep singing”, so I did. She told me I have a beautiful voice and Blazer did too. I realized in that moment, when I was just playing and singing, why I love music. I was just there, and hadn’t even noticed the people around me at first. I was just with the music. I only strummed a few chords because I don’t know many anymore, but even a few chords can touch someone. Even a few chords could lift my spirits. I have not felt that happy in a long time, that much “myself”. I need to bring music back into my life. But mostly I wish I could have the confidence to play my music more often in public like that. I want to share it and when I’m in my element, I just jam out. It’s always been a small fantasy of mine that I could be a singer as a career, but the stage fright always holds me back. And the comparison. So many people can sing, I’m just one of them. It’s hard to “make it” and be that someone special that’s new to the music world. Someday maybe. Someone was talking about Taylor Swift the other day and saying how her dad funded her music career and was her manager. I don’t know much about that, but I could imagine if you had connections or people that knew how to get you to the top, and money, that you could make it. But again, singing in front of people...


I hope tomorrow we can get our slackpack in and make up some miles to get as far as we can before we skip! I think we’ll make this work!

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622272,"So... it’s not going to work. At least the slackpack isn’t. Salamander and I headed out to slackpack today and we were both pooped. I definitely partied too hard and was having a rough time, and she was in worse shape. I successfully hiked 12 miles, and she stopped around 6. She texted me and said Stanimals was picking her up, and I didn’t want to leave her behind, so I called and asked if they could pick me up too when they came for her. We didn’t finish the 20 miles we planned to do, and I was definitely discouraged. Especially since I was already feeling pressure, and now it was mounting.


We got back to the shelter, as we had planned. It was going to be a 20-mile slackpack south (wait, Debbie will slackpack south now? Debbie isn’t putting herself in a box? What?). And then we’d come back to the shelter since it was free, and have Stanimals take us back to the spot tomorrow. But now, I knew we’d have some trouble. We couldn’t do a whole 20-mile slackpack today, and we weren’t probably going to be able to do one tomorrow. And we had paid Stanimals and I was stressed about it all. I was just totally bugging out. And I didn’t think I could spend much longer in Glasgow hearing “B double E double R U N! Beer run! Beer run!” And being surrounded by bugs and flies and filth, which unfortunately comes with a “beer run” party shelter. 


I ended up saying to Salamander, “let’s just skip now. I’m miserable, we’re both feeling behind, let’s just do it now”. And she seemed very hesitant, but we had agreed we’d skip, so she said yes. And I called Stanimals and arranged for a ride tomorrow to Devil’s Backbone Brewery. It was not a huge jump, as it would’ve taken us two days slackpacking, and I at least had 12 of those miles under me now. But it was a jump that would work. We’d be at a fun place where hikers can camp for free and enjoy beer, and we’d only be 20 miles from Waynesboro, which was a nice town and a good place to get ready for the Shenandoahs. We had a plan. 


I was sick to my stomach trying to do this skip and I know Salamander was too. It was eating away at both of us, but she reassured me and we both seemed to make peace with it somewhat. But it took me a bit for sure. We went to a free pasta dinner at the church in Glasgow. It was not great (again they didn’t brown the top) lol, but my real reasons for saying that come from this one b**** church lady. I am sorry, but Jesus take the wheel. What she said to me, lord have mercy I could scream. 


At first, dinner was okay. We all went around and said our trail names and our reasons for being here/funny stories. Rukus said he got his name from a tattoo that says “bring the.... rrrukus” and we all cracked up, knowing it said more than that! There was another guy from CT here, NASA. He’s super cool! And an adorable girl who he’s hiking with, Joplin! She’s so great! She loves classic rock like me and the two of them are just a blast to hang out with. After dinner though, the lady at the church said, “well you’ve been out here a long time, did you ever expect to make it to Maine?” I’m sorry, get your BUTT out here and try this yourself and then sass me out like that. I stood up for myself and said, “I have plenty of time. And if I need to, I can skip up and come back and do it”. And then she basically chucked the knife in and stabbed several times. “Well you do know you’re not a thru-hiker anymore then, right? If you skip, you’re just a section hiker”. A man next to her agreed and said “yup you’re just a section hiker now. But that’s okay. That’s a great thing to be. But you’re not a thru-hiker”. The rage that was building was enough for me to literally flip the table over and scream. But I stayed calm. I fought them on it and told them the ATC would recognize me as one and blah blah blah, but there was no point. 



They were never going to agree with me. Isn’t there something about loving for who we are without judgement? Are these people even religious? Oh we’re so “Christian” and nice, yeah bullshit. You made me pasta and ruined my entire night. You suck.
I was crying the entire way back and sat on a picnic table just miserable. I have been over and over this and I have given myself so much hell for my decisions. It is just so unfair to be given more hell. Again here we go with opinions and when is the right and wrong time to KEEP THEM TO YOURSELF. I felt so low and depressed, I was having bad thoughts. I wanted to quit and to disappear. I kept thinking, well I can’t quit, because won’t everyone hate me then and tell me I haven’t done anything. And if I can’t quit then I can’t stay out here cuz I’m miserable. So maybe I’ll just wander into the woods and disappear. I was actually that depressed. And the church lady just put the nails in my coffin. I have not been this unhappy since last summer. This low, this miserable. I almost called my therapist, but I tried to get through it myself. I tried to sit there and process it and make peace with myself. I tried. But I was so completely done. Everyone was actually really supportive at the shelter and kept cheering me on. Cut-Off was an angel and Salamander was so great too. 



The section hiker from last night was even sweet and seemed to realize just how miserable I was now. He said “if it’s good enough for you, then it’s good enough for them, because it actually is good enough”. It helped a bit, but I was still so low. He said “it’s the teller not the tale”. And that’s true. This is my story, it’s MINE. It’s about how I want to do it, about how I’m feeling and processing. And it really makes me think about journey vs destination anyway. Again with my cheesy quotes, but this isn’t about the end. At the end, the best journey of my life will be over. I don’t want it to be over. I don’t want it to just be about getting to Katahdin and then being like “k guess I’ll go home now”.This generation has a way of making everything about the end destination. It’s always about how many accomplishments we have, how many trophies, how many things we can put on a resume, how many things we can be involved in, how many things we can BRAG about. But it’s never about our journey. It’s never about our growth as people, our paths. Someone will be a drug addict with a hard dark past that they worked hard to overcome, and yet all we focus on is the label that they were a drug addict. We don’t focus on their journey or how strong they are to have come out of that. It’s not fair. It’s not fair that I could quit at 800 miles and people will say, “well you didn’t finish” instead of “wow, tell us about your journey, tell us how you learned”. Or “wow, we can see how much you’ve grown, what a journey that must have been”. It’s always “when are you going to finish? How many miles a day do you do? Shouldn’t you be ahead? Shouldn’t you do more miles? When did you start? Isn’t that a long time ago? Aren’t you slow? Aren’t you a COMPLETE FAILURE for not doing this the way WE said you NEED TO?”.
I’m tired. I’m just so tired. It’s been a time. I’m sorry to my readers. This is such a low time. But I’m writing this after the fact and I promise there is good to come and I will be okay.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622274,"Today we headed out, by car, to the Brewery. We passed by towns and the guy driving was actually a thru-hiker who was just driving for Stanimals for a week to make some extra money. He was actually a dermatologist before trail and I had a huge bump on my neck, and he told me it was a cyst, formed by sweat and oils and such. I was thankful to know, since I’ve been confused for a few days about this bump. I hope it goes away. 


We arrived at the Brewery and I immediately felt better. It was just a cool place. So clean and nice. And the whole area for thru-hikers was really nice. We set up our tents and went over to get food. To be honest, the food was not good. They definitely had good beer, but the mac and cheese was bland and overpriced. And the fries weren’t even close to crispy. Gotta have that crispy stuff peeps! But it was a nice lunch and we both seemed happy with our decision. 


We went back to our tents and hung out all day. Cali and No Rush and Rachel were there, which was awesome! But unfortunately they were leaving today. I called Stanimals to slackpack tomorrow the rest of the way to Waynesboro. I knew Salamander wouldn’t want to, but I figured at this point I needed to do something to get my spirits up. Yesterday I was lower than low. I needed to be a bit selfish today and do what was going to help me continue out here. I love Salamander and want to hike with her, but I’m struggling right now. 


Stanimals told me they’d like it if other people were involved to make the drive worth it, so I tried to recruit people. There was a whole trail family with Sister, Sunshine, Cali, and a guy who’s name I can’t remember. They seemed hesitant and I didn’t want to force them, as I didn’t want to force Salamander. They said they would get back to me and Salamander and I went to have dinner. She got a huge plate of nachos and I got a big soft pretzel. We had an awesome time and she noticed someone had left a Busch beer in a bush outside and we were both cracking up about a “Busch in a bush”. We really get each other and our humor is the same, silly puns and all. I got chocolate beer, which was delicious. I do tend to like darker beers like porters, and this was so good. 


I went to ask Sister about the slackpacking because I was getting stressed about confirming with Stanimals. She was at the bar with her tramily and they all said they wanted to slackpack a smaller amount or just yellow blaze it. It was incredibly refreshing to hear that other people were considering the same decisions I was and they were so cool about it. They agreed to at least either ride with Stanimals or slackpack with them, so I called Stanimals and confirmed. That was a huge plus for the day. I now had a plan that would at least lift my spirits a bit! 


And Thumper had texted me and was at the Stanimals in Waynesboro, so I was excited for more jokes and memes and silliness with him. We made plans to split a room for lower cost. I went to bed feeling somewhat better. I was okay with what happened. I was making peace with it. And don’t worry, I will be back to make these miles up. And when I do, I’ll use Stanimals to slackpack all of it so I can get it done quickly.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622275,"This morning we all packed up quickly to get to the breakfast. They serve a “hiker breakfast” that’s only 5 bucks for a lot of food and you get a free T-shirt!! We made it and ate up! The shirts are cool! It’s funny because there’s technically a mistake on them and there’s a map of the AT and all the states on it, but an extra line in ME, adding a state. Maybe that’s why they’re giving them away haha. But it was still cool! And breakfast was yummy! And they had big bins full of supplies and toiletries! They really nailed it. I mean if there’s a way to treat hikers well, this is it. I was very impressed. I’ll definitely stop here again when I come to do these miles!

The lady who was coming to shuttle us from Stanimals was also a thru-hiker, Pink Panther, working for a week for a little extra cash. She was very friendly and helpful. We loaded the packs into the car and Sister and her gang headed off! I finished my breakfast and headed to the trailhead with a ride from the brewery, another wonderful service provided to hikers. I started my slackpack quickly, but was soon discouraged by a ton of rocks and slippery sections, which made me slow down. I got to a few nice views though, and the rest of it was not too bad.The most exciting moment happened as I was coming down towards a shelter. I saw a couple and they said, “watch out, there’s a bear down there. But he’s fine, he won’t bother you.” I was already very nervous. I haven’t seen a bear on trail!! I was sort of hoping he had run off, but also hoping I’d see him. And then, as I came down one of the switchbacks, THERE HE WAS! A big black bear! He was just sitting on a rock about 20 feet from me. I froze and stared at him, and he stared at me, and then he just bolted and ran down the hill. I was disappointed I didn’t get a picture. He ran off so fast! But I was also happy he ran off and I didn’t have to clang my poles or anything. The only issue was, he ran down the hill and I was going down there too! The switchbacks went exactly where he went! So I was shaking and quite nervous that I was going towards him, and as I went down every dark fallen tree looked like a bear and I was scared.
I made it to the shelter without seeing him again. I laughed when I saw a sign on the shelter wall that said to watch out for bears in this area! No kidding!! I sat and had a snack. I had about 7 miles to go. I was pretty nervous the whole 7 miles, again thinking everything was a bear, but I saw nothing else and ended up at the road! I called Stanimals and they sent someone to come get me. 


I got to the hostel and saw Thumper! And George and a woman named Falcon. Stargazer was also there and the old folks that had slackpacked. I set my stuff up in the room and hung out with everyone. They had sodas in the fridge and another massage chair!! Thumper and I got pizza at a place with slices the size of your face! It was very yummy. I tried to eat two, but was unsuccessful and only ate one and a half. Thumper told me last night that he had been at the Brewery before with The Champ and he had said “yeah Little Debbie, I’m gonna have myself a little snack”. Lol barf, eye roll, second barf. I thought we were friends. But no, I guess I’m just a “snack” to you. Not interested. 


It felt so good to do miles today and get my mind back in the game. Slowly getting through this tough period on trail. I remember a quote I heard the other day, “I’m out here to enjoy it, not to endure it.”

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622276,"Today it was time to enter the Shenandoahs!! But I knew it would be a Nero because I didn’t have my stuff ready and had to sort through my food box. Because Salamander and I made our skip and ate at the lake house, I hadn’t eaten all my food. So I hiker boxed some of it like the rest of my peanut butter and tortillas and trail mix, but packed out a good amount. My bag felt insanely heavy. I packed out Doritos and drinks from the past few days, so I knew my pack was pretty heavy. I heated up the extra pizza for lunch and then headed out in the afternoon. 



Thumper and I headed for the first shelter, which was about 7 miles. It looked very ominous outside so I was worried it would rain. It was uphill of course. We filled out forms at the entrance to the Shenandoahs, which was basically a small container pinned to a big wooden sign. We had to clip one to our packs for our stay. A park ranger actually came by to collect them, perfect timing! The terrain was rocky and up down up down. For some reason I was picturing the Shenandoahs as this flat, beautiful, scenic place. Well the first day was not that at all.
It was pretty much dark when we arrived, but we made it! We set up our stuff in the shelter and got ready to make dinner. And we saw Salamander! I was so happy to see her again. She had made it to the shelter where I saw the bear last night, and then today she had hiked from there to this shelter. She had her tent set up nearby and came and had dinner with us. She said she was thinking about 20 miles tomorrow to a campground in the park, and her professor from school was coming to hike with her. I felt ambitious and said that sounded good, but realistically a 20 with my heavy pack and mental state right now was not going to happen. So I realistically looked at other options and told her I’d aim for the campground. 


I shared food with her and Thumper in an attempt to eat through it. We tried to put our food on the bear pole, which is actually harder to use than I realized. My bag was heavy and it was swaying as we tried to put it on the pole. We got it onto a lower hook, which a bear might reach, but I was tired and just wanted to sleep. We went to bed, but of course I heard mice right away. I moved away from the wall and switched places with Thumper, who was very understanding since we had the mice encounter the last time we met before Glasgow. 


It was a slow and chill day that didn’t really help my mood or accomplishments, but I’m in the Shenandoahs and looking forward to what’s coming.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622277,"Today we all got up early, which was awesome! Salamander came over and we all ate breakfast together. There was a family of day hikers in a huge tent and they were packing up. I used the privy and noticed a lovely nest made out of poop paper from the privy. And those same mice are crawling over us at night. Yuck yuck yuck. Thumper and I got out at a good time and Salamander left a bit before us to meet her professor. There was a little detour at first around some power lines they were working on. 



The day had many ups and downs again. We saw Salamander and her professor eating berries and we all stopped at an overlook together. They headed on and Thumper and I continued. We didn’t run into them again. There were a few overlooks, which is what I had heard about the Shenandoahs, and they had very nice views, but there were climbs in between each. Up down up down up down. We stopped for a moment at one of the parking areas and I was really ready to lose it. Every day is just a struggle right now trying to beat my own demons, in addition to the heat and the bugs and the stress of it all. Thumper was very understanding. He’s a lot of fun to hang out with. He’s only here on a section hike, but he’s a good buddy to have and I’m thankful he’s hiking with me for a bit. I need someone right now to at least be with me, and as much as I love Salamander, I think she’s doing her own thing and I knew that might happen when we weren’t quite on the same page about slackpacking and such.

Thumper said we should just go to the next shelter and not worry about the campground. I was upset at possibly losing Salamander, even though we might not have hiked together. We were still buds. I was also just trying to push miles. But I agreed with him. Just the next shelter today. We got to another road and it was looking like rain. It sprinkled a bit and we put our pack covers on. We met a day hiker who was running down to her car out of the rain. She took some trash from Thumper, as we had had trail magic earlier today (some granola bars and water from folks in a parking lot) and he had the box and wrappers. That was very nice of her, it’s annoying to carry trash sometimes for long periods of time.

There wasn’t a lot of water today, so that trail magic was very nice. It was done by a trail maintainer and he was very friendly and enthusiastic about the trail. He made me feel good, although he also talked about the hard sections in New England and not having that much time and I was stressed again.Thumper and I got to the shelter and it was a bit off trail unfortunately. We got down there and there was tape across all the trees, but one tent tucked in the corner. We set our packs down and a ridge runner came out from the tent. Her name was Four Eyes and she explained that the tape was there because there had been an aggressive bear the night before. Ahhhhh. She said the bear had gone into someone’s tent and taken their pack! Umm!! They got the pack back, but there was damage to the tent. So as of today there was no camping allowed here, but people could stay in the shelter itself. The trail maintainers had come down today and installed a bear box and now Four Eyes was here to make sure no one camped and to enforce the new protocol.Thumper and I set up inside the shelter and two other folks showed up. They both had hammocks unfortunately, so they didn’t have sleep pads for a shelter, but made it work. Thumper and I made a fire and had dinner. The two section hikers were hilarious and pulled out a bottle of bourbon. And then in came Cakes! I met Cakes a few days ago. He’s so entertaining. He’s hiked both of the other trails so he’s going for his triple crown. He pulled out weed, so people were partying it up at this shelter and it was a lot of fun. It really raised my spirits. Thumper somehow had Brandy even though he’s underage. Four Eyes had an air horn ready and we all expected a bear to show up any time, because they often repeat the same actions and continue to come back. But he didn’t show up. No bear!
We had a good end to this day and it made me feel good after a difficult time. I was so happy to have good company and to have hiked more today. Slowly making progress in miles and mind.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622278,"Late start today! Lol at this point are any of you shocked? I probably had too much bourbon and brandy last night and was feeling poopy and sleepy this morning. It’s also combined with a painful mental state of just not wanting to hike or continue on, which I’m working on. We got out late and started the day with a climb. It wasn’t too bad. The top was all covered in rocks and a lot of day hikers! I took my pack off and climbed up on the rocks. It was a pretty sweet view and I had Thumper take my picture. 


He climbed back down like it was nothing, and I scrambled down full of nerves. There was an adorable little boy and he looked at me and said “hike hike hike hike!” He was the cutest. Another little kid screamed as Thumper and I walked away, “have a stinky day!” Gotta love kids lol. Trust me kid, every day out here is stinky for sure. The day was up down up down again, and hot. We stopped at a picnic area and had a snack. We met a man named Pilgrim who was slackpacking. We got to the blue blaze trail for the campground that Salamander had headed for yesterday. 


We wanted to at least stop here because Thumper’s Uncle was still following him along and was staying here. We passed a pretty amphitheater with a view and then ran into his Uncle, coming in his car. He had left a cooler with trail magic and was going to pick it up. He took us to a wayside and we got some food, and then we went to his campsite and we hung out for a while. We had some powerades and relaxed. Thumper’s Uncle Rick offered to slackpack us the next day, and once I heard that, I told Thumper we should stay. I knew I was behind Salamander still and that we hadn’t hiked much, but I’ll take a slackpack whenever I can!! And I thought it would be nice to keep Rick company since Thumper was out here to do this hike with his Uncle following along.



Thumper and I set up our tents and walked down to the camp store, where we got milkshakes. We walked back and made dinner and then headed to bed. The campground was a cool place. There were a lot of car campers with big fancy tents, as many would call “glamping”. It was like luxury to me though. A huge tent and a car, that is truly everything lol. Cars are soooo fast and a big fancy tent is so spacious. I want both. It’s funny how the trail makes you realize how great everyday items can be. I definitely would come camp like this in a campground and go for day hikes in the Shenandoahs. That sounds awesome to me. I’m looking forward to a slackpack tomorrow!

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622279,"Slackpack! We got out early and headed to a road 17 miles away to slackpack south. While we were driving, we ran into Salamander, who was walking on the road to a Ranger station. Her knee was hurting her. We picked her up and took her there, but when we got there, there was no one around. It seemed totally abandoned. The station is on Guthook, as it has a water spigot hikers can use, but it is kind of weird that no one is there. Rick said there was a town nearby that he could take Salamander to, so he went and took her there and dropped me and Thumper off. I hoped she was okay and getting treatment! 



Thumper and I started the day with a little up and ran into Cakes!! Yay! He’s so great. He’s a speedy one, so I was happy I got to see him. Today actually had a ton of climbs. It was harder than both of the past two days. There were some nice views, and we knew we’d pass the Ranger station too. We were going slowly and taking several breaks. When we got to the station we didn’t have much left to do. I had to go to the bathroom and was hoping someone was there. Two people drove by in cars, but no one was inside or around. It was just weird. I ended up going on the side of the road and was sure I flashed everyone, but when you gotta go you gotta go! Lol.
We got to an overlook that was about 4 miles from the campground. We found Rick’s cooler with trail magic that he leaves every day and we had some powerades. Thumper checked his phone and Rick had texted, saying he’d have dinner for us both ready at 5. It was almost 5. We were both a bit worried about not making it back on time, and as I’ve seen, Rick can be a little sassy, even though he’s been wonderful to us both. Thumper said that we were just a few miles by road and we should just yellow blaze to make it in time. I was definitely against the idea and it was stirring up all those feelings from before about yellow blazing and my hike and what it all meant. But I was also worried. I don’t like to get in trouble or let people down. I didn’t want to be late and have Rick be upset with us. Normally I could totally do a 17 mile slackpack by 5, but today was slow. Thumper and I have fun and I’m thankful for his company, but we don’t make great progress. 



Thumper asked a couple in the parking area before I could really decide and they said they could take us. I didn’t fight it, but was having a lot of trouble with this. The couple was very nice and they were from CT, so we bonded over that! We got back to the campground and Thumper didn’t want to tell his Uncle that we yellow blazed, but I was feeling ashamed and struggling, so ended up letting it slip. Now Rick believed in us even less and gave us sass for not even finishing a slackpack. Ugh I’m just struggling right now. The skipping, the judgment, the mental pain, the lack of progress, it’s just adding up.
Rick had grilled a pork loin and it was delicious. It was some of the best food I’ve had in a while. I miss fresh grilled meat. I ate at least half the loin. It was so good! I was very thankful for that. Rick has done a lot for me and for Thumper. Thumper and I went back for more milkshakes, but the machine was down. Sadness! We hung out at the amphitheater and got beers to share with Rick. It was actually very nice to chill with Rick and have some beer. I do think he needed that company too, but who knows. I sure as hell needed to be around people. 



Thumper and I went to bed. I was tired from the day and still struggling with the decision to skip today, even those few miles. I probably won’t worry too much about making those up, as I’m not going to die over four miles missed out of 2,192 at the end of this, but since I have to come back to VA anyway, I figure I’ll probably make it up.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622280,"Today Rick took us to town for breakfast. I didn’t really need to go to town, but Thumper wanted to. I think the temptation is there in this area with all the roads and waysides and campgrounds, but town was out of that and I didn’t see the need. We went to McDonalds and I don’t really eat fast food, so I didn’t get anything. Rick dropped us off at the road we slackpacked from. I was out of water and should’ve filled up at McDonalds, but I didn’t want to hold Rick up and there’s something about that pressure that I just didn’t want to mess with. There was a water source right near the road, but it was pretty filthy. I filtered it anyway though and it came out crystal clear! Yay Sawyer filters! 


We started our day with an uphill and then reached a picnic area. We had snacks here. Thumper used the toilet and noticed that someone must have missed the toilet because there was a pile of poo on the floor! Lol how do you miss? Asking for a friend. We headed on from there with some more ups and downs and reached another campground. We at least wanted to stop for the camp store. Judge me all you want (because at this point y’all are anyway right?), but I really do like having the campstores and waysides. I like civilization. A lot of thru-hikers hate the Shenandoahs because of all the tourists and civilization, but I love it. It means picnic areas with bathrooms and trash, it means waysides with hot food, it means stores with candy bars and soda, it means a place to camp with a bathroom and fire pit and sometimes a view. I personally like it and maybe that’s just because I’ve been in the woods so long it’s really nice to have some luxury living on the AT! Again I was never a huge camper. I love to hike, but backpacking and carrying this stuff around is just a lot every day. Having a car and being able to pack whatever you want, omg. I could have tiki torches and twinkle lights and candles and s’mores and drinks and all sorts of fun. I’ve seen people with a literal carpet they were sitting on to eat dinner outside their huge tent. #goals Prediction about whether Deb becomes a glamper or not? The real questions. 


After chilling at the store, we decided to stay. Shock lol. They were incredibly friendly there and had a hiker cabin with bunks for a really cheap price. So we did it and I got beers and s’mores stuff and we glamped! Sort of! We took showers and were nice and clean and hung out with the most adorable Corgi at one of the cabins. I don’t know who’s seen “Same Time Next Year”, one of my fave movies, but for some reason this reminded me of that. A cabin with a sort of 50s style feel and an old couple coming to visit every year as tradition. It’s got a sweet vibe here and I like it. Grandma Deb here to glamp in the Shenandoahs! 


We saw another hiker, Freebird, and invited him over to have dinner with us and s’mores. I was a little annoyed because Thumper offered our beers, and even though I definitely wanted to invite him and have time with other hikers, I’ve been buying the beers since Thumper can’t and I specifically chose out beers I wanted. If you didn’t buy it, it isn’t yours to offer! Lol. I’m stressed about money, who isn’t? But seriously, as much as I love these waysides and all and am trying to make myself as happy as possible given the circumstances, I’m spending money. And I’m trying to treat myself in an effort to help myself through this. And Thumper’s like, hey here’s our beer! And I’m like, THUMPER. He’s very social and I like that, as we really have a lot of fun together, but sometimes it’s annoying. I’m a generous person normally, but can definitely be stuck in a frugal mode where I don’t want to share. It’s not a good thing, but I was having enough issues already. Just let me have my beer. I communicated and it was all fine. Freebird is totally awesome and I was really glad he joined us. 


We made a campfire and s’mores and they were very good, a real treat! We had a tough time keeping the fire going, but it had its moments. Freebird went down to stay in his tent and we headed to bed. We offered for him to stay in the cabin, but he wanted to stay in his tent and I get needing space sometimes. Too many people maybe. Two raccoons walked right by us while we were hanging out and I was happy there was a bear box for food. They didn’t care one bit that we were there! I don’t know that I’ve ever seen raccoons so up close and personal! We quickly put the food in the bear box for the night. 


Tonight was a good night. It was a great campground with a nice peaceful vibe and our little hiker’s cabin was great. Everyday I’m working towards getting happier on trail. It’s nice to have Thumper for company and to be in such a fun place as the Shenandoahs.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622281,"This morning we got packed up and Thumper turned on his phone to a million texts. I’ve enjoyed having him as a buddy, but man he’s such a youngin. His mom was freaking out because Rick told her Thumper was going slower and hanging with me and his mom thought it was something else and the whole thing was just a mess. I did not want to be involved at all. I was just miserable and needed a friend and that’s what Thumper was for me. I just needed a friend. And now I felt like the cops were going to come after us because Thumper’s mom was on high alert and Uncle Rick is now somehow upset about mileage and I’m just stuck in this sticky situation more uncomfortable than ever. And young boys are the WORST at communicating to their mothers! I saw the stuff he was saying and he was so unclear about where he was and what he was doing. No wonder she was worried. I felt like a babysitter. I took his phone and did the communicating for him because somehow boys think one-word responses are going to cut it for anxious mothers of teens. Hate to break it to you, but ya gotta give mom more than that! I was having flashbacks to high school and parental concern, which I now realize is totally justified.
I’m almost 23 and can recognize a mom’s concern. When you’re 19, you think you own the world. I used to think “oh this person’s only 23, what do they know?” Well a lot. You learn a lot in between 19 and 23!! I’m not the same person at all. I may have some of the same personality traits and such, but I’m much more mature and aware now. You really don’t know everything at 19. Lol. Mom does. Give mom more than one word texts! When I texted Rick, he was so happy to have actual info about where we were, what we were hiking today, etc. and said that Thumper gives him nothing. THUMPER! Ugh. I was so frustrated with this whole thing. I literally just wanted a buddy and now I have mom and Rick after me and Thumper like we’re on the run. I’m just way past that. Been there done that. I don’t need to be 19 again. 


I’m 23 and like my independence out here. My mom worries, but I communicate with her and update her and she has this lovely blog to read and see everything I’m thinking and feeling. Wink mom! I felt like I was a little kid in this moment and I was just over it. I’m too old for this shit. I told Thumper to communicate better with his mom and Rick because I didn’t want to have any more blow-ups like this. Looking back it’s pretty comical. On the run in the Shenandoahs! Boy oh boy. 


Today we were going to pass another campground and I told Thumper to be realistic. The chances we’d stop for a “snack” at the camp store were 100%, we’d likely end up staying. I told him to tell his Uncle we were aiming for a certain shelter and give all the specifics, but say that we might stop sooner at the campground. I’m like mom number 2 lol. This is ridiculous. Also to be clear, I have told Thumper this entire time that he can hike on and do more miles. I have made that clear since we started hiking together. I didn’t want to slow him down. But I think we slowed each other down since we both seemed to want to do the campgrounds and such. But I really didn’t want to interfere with his section hike. I really did make that clear. But he said he enjoyed my company and we had fun and he had been bored on the trail before meeting me, so he said he wanted to hike with me til he was done. 


As we were getting ready to go, a woman waved us over to her cabin. She was so sweet and gave us leftover food from her weekend a the campground. She came every year and they were celebrating her parents, who had been married for 50+ years, which is just so adorable. *melts* this is the adorable sweet part of the Shenandoahs I was talking about. It’s got such tradition and history. We didn’t need too much snacks, but she wanted to be helpful and we appreciated it. The whole family was a true gem and made my whole morning.


We had a few climbs today and it looked like it might rain. We reached the side trail for the campground in good time and took it to the camp store. They were doing renovations, so there was no Wayside right now. There was a lodge and a campground though! We decided to at least check that out (aka stay). We walked towards it and got a hitch, but they only could fit one person. Thumper was complaining that people were asses and I was saying, “no they don’t have room. They’re on vacation with kids and suitcases and they can’t fit us and our packs”. Plus we’re smelly hikers in a nice tourist area. I never get hitches so I never expect it to work. 


He managed to get a hitch right after me and we got to the lodge. It was only a mile anyway, but who wants to walk that extra mile that’s not AT! We saw Stargazer there! She’s the best. Thumper and I saw the place and agreed to stay. We booked a room and it was 1000 percent worth it. I’m coming back here. It’s so cool here. We put our packs in the room and went down to the bar for food (that’s where the hikers go, it’s less classy). We found another hiker named Pickle. He’s super cool. We all ordered food and Pickle and I got drinks. We allowed Thumper to sip them, but we did not share them at all. Yet the bartender thought we were and scolded us because Thumper looks too young. I literally thought we were gonna get kicked out at first. I’m very thankful that didn’t happen. I really wasn’t trying to split my drink with him. I had gotten some ciders for later anyway. 



Thumper called his mom, per my request. I could hear her frustration and I was like woman, I feel ya. It was a long chat lol she had some THINGS to say. Don’t blow off mom. The food was okay, but not great here. The drinks were good, and I got one called the Debbie, which I was very excited about! We headed out and I met a trail angel who runs on the trail in the area and likes to help out. He looked super fit and intense and I didn’t bother sharing my daily mileage. He was very nice though. My mom called me to discuss July 4 plans, everybody call mom! Yay mom! Lol.The music and outfits were totally 50s jazzy vibe and I was digging it! We went up to the room and it was a cute cabin-feel. I love this place! I lay on my bed and it was so squishy and soft and comfy; man can I just pack out a bed? Like what are the logistics of packing out a bed? How do I make this happen? It was a heavenly cloud of mush and I was so happy. Yes happy. Finally, today, it seemed like I was breaking through my funk. Maybe!We had a view right outside our door. And we went into the main common area and people were doing puzzles and I had that cabin, Maine vacation feel just doing my puzzle. Ahh it was just perfect. We chatted with a woman and petted her dog for a bit, and she asked us about the trail. And Thumper is such a fart he let her believe he was a thru-hiker and I was just shaking my head watching it. I mean I really do get it. The kid is young and insecure and it’s relatable. You wanna seem as cool as you can at that age. I certainly did that too. I wasn’t trying to lie, just make myself look as cool as possible to hide my insecurities. Now I’m completely honest for the most part with myself and my decisions and with people, but if I think they’re going to judge, I don’t want to hear it and I won’t fully go there and be myself. Thumper said the other day that he thought he was allergic to chicken. I’m sorry but I just can’t with this kid. Rick was cracking up too. Thumper eats chicken all the time at home, but had one upset tummy and the shits and now he’s allergic to chicken. Lol. Oh to be 19 again. What a time. 


We headed back to our room and had our ciders and then passed out. I loved my bed and was just in heaven all night in those pillows and plush. Man it was amazing. Coming back to the lodge for sure someday haha. Gonna have my “Same Time Next Year” with my husband some day and come back here haha. And maybe Thumper won’t be allergic to chicken and we can have a reunion. This kid.

Diana Jackson,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622284,"This morning Thumper and I got breakfast at the lodge. They had a buffet, but the selection was not good. The food is never as fresh as it was when it first came out at buffets, but this one also had only an omelette type egg thing and biscuits and gravy and I don’t like any of that lol. I know, so picky, but hey I just like what I like! You could order from the menu or do the buffet, so I did the menu. I had a coffee, Thumper and I shared a waffle, and I got pancakes with scrambled eggs, bacon, and potatoes. It was very yummy. Freebird joined us for breakfast! He seems to be taking his time too and boy do I like to meet another hiker who does that.
Also by the way, it just occurred to me, Salamander is good peeps! She got a steroid shot and her knee is okay, but she has a friend in the area and is resting anyway. The section Salamander and I were going to skip originally was from the end of the Shenandoahs to Harper’s Ferry. The Brewery skip was not planned at all. But now we were getting to the skip we both planned on doing, so she jumped up with her friend, and I was going to jump up on July 4. That was my whole goal anyway because if you get to Harper’s Ferry by then, you’re pretty solid to make it to Katahdin in time. And my parents wanted to visit and I thought July 4 would be fun!! So I was prepping for my jump anyway at this point and that’s why I wasn’t rushing anything. 



Thumper and I checked out and I took a pic with the bear they have in the lobby. It was such a wonderful stay here. My mood has totally shifted. Today we were going to hike to a shelter (what not a campground?) and then hike 3 miles in the morning to meet Thumper’s Uncle, who nicely said he’d drive me part of the way for my skip. I was very thankful for that. Thumper and I went to the campstore to pack out beers because it was our last night and we wanted to celebrate some fun times together. Call your mom Thumper.
We realized then that the blue blaze was a walk and the other blue blaze was also a walk and it was a bit annoying. These campgrounds are pretty big! We decided to take the other blue blaze and walked all the way to it. Thumper was being grumpy about this and I was actually the positive one right now. We got back on the AT and went the wrong way for a second, but then turned around and headed north. Thumper went ahead and I had to pee, so I lost him for a bit. When I caught up, he was by a parking lot and said he wanted to yellow blaze. Ahh not again! These little skips are the worst to make up. But it was midday already and I felt pressure to get there so we could meet his Uncle tomorrow and I wasn’t going to chose a different spot because then Rick would give me sass and think I wasn’t capable and I just wanted to meet him successfully tomorrow. 



Thumper and I met a couple in the parking lot who had motorcycles and were headed out for a walk. We chatted for a while and they were super friendly and seemed impressed with the weight of the packs and all. Thumper again pretended he was a thru-hiker. Another woman walked along and saw my legs and ran back to her car to get me something for them. I told her I had tried so many things, but the bugs were just horrible no matter what, and she said she had an oil that would prevent them from biting because they would skip off my skin. At this point, why the hell not? I’ll try it!
So she went and got that, and the couple chatted with us for a while. And then we went to the road and the lady came back with pretzels and water too! That was very nice of her. We thanked her and went to hitch a ride. No one was stopping and I can’t say I was shocked. I never get a hitch part gazillion. Thumper is very assertive though and it was helpful here. He asked everyone that walked by if they could give us a ride. And finally a family said they might have room. They went to their car and we prayed they could make it work. We sat and waited and they pulled up to us with room in their car! Yay! 



They took us to a picnic area and from here we’d only have 2 miles to the shelter. We thanked them and they wished us luck and we put our packs down in the pavilion. I was laughing at the ridiculousness of what’s been happening the past few weeks. It’s been a slow adventure, but I’m really happy to have my happiness back. Happy to be happy haha. I’m getting through this.
We hung out for a while and Thumper was complaining about everything, including the trail magic that he claimed we didn’t need. Sometimes you don’t need trail magic, but someone wants to help you and they’re trying to give you something they’ll think you need. Just take it and be grateful. Gosh! This kid. Ahhh. We got packed up and headed out and got a huge slap in the face this evening, maybe deserved, who the hell knows. 


Since we had yellow blazed, we didn’t know which was was north or south and we went the wrong way. But guess when I discovered this? When I was a mile out the wrong way and Thumper was a mile ahead of me. Wonderful. I started to panic because it was getting dark and we had hung out so long at the picnic area because we only had two more miles to hike, but now we had more than 3 and less time. And it was going to storm and I could see the clouds forming and I was just full of anxiety. I pulled out my phone and had almost no service. Great. I tried to called Thumper over and over, but none were going through. I dropped my pack and ran down the trail to find him. My lost child lol. I honestly felt that worried. 


I was calling his name and he heard me finally and ran down to me. He was worried I was hurt and that reaction from him really made me feel good. If I was hurt, I would want my friend to drop everything and come running out here. It’s scary being alone sometimes. He made me feel safe and I didn’t just view him as a kid right now. He was there for me and wanted me to be okay. He was so worried too. The look on his face thinking I was calling his name because I was hurt, he looked so panicked. We walked to his pack and turned around and kept walking to my pack. I was so glad I found him, but he was so far ahead. We had so much to walk now and for sure would get stuck in the rain. 


I put my pack back on and we hiked together all the way back through the picnic area. Yeah I guess it serves us right for skipping. Karma’s a bitch. But now we were going the right way and continued forward. We passed by this super cool view, where it feels like you’re standing in a half dome, looking at a view from a ridge. The sky looked cool despite the storm. We then had to climb a peak and it was downhill after to the shelter. We got to the top of the peak and another view and saw rain pouring in the distance. Coming right for us I’m sure! 


And I was right. We started to walk down and boom. Hardcore pouring rain shower. It was a bit intense. I had had such a stressful time just now and I was even more stressed with the rain. We made it to the shelter though! And no one was there! Yippee we could spread all our wet stuff out and chill! So we did and we drank our beers and enjoyed our last night. It rained all night. Thumper and I thought we heard a bear and I was very scared, but we didn’t see anything. We did see some huge frogs in the puddles. Mice ran all over the floor all night and we found their hole and gently covered it up with tape. Sorry mice, not dealing with you running all over me at night. Especially when you’re making nests with my poop. Lol nope. 


Man what a time. Tomorrow I skip up to meet my parents and get back on track with this whole journey. Here’s hoping we make it to see Rick!
