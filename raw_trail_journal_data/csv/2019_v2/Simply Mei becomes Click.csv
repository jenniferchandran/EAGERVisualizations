Simply Mei becomes Click,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604863,"Ever since I completed JMT with my family 3 years ago, I have set my eyes on Appalachian Trail. I have been hiking and backpacking mostly in the western states of US, and around the world on some of the famous treks, but the green tunnel of AT has been calling me all the time. Just the  thought of walking more than 2000 miles, one step at a time, made my blood running faster. Plus the lure of the legends, the stories of the human interactions, and the passion spilled from Ex-ATers' blogs pulled me closer and closer to AT. I want to experience them all. I want to see if my body and my mental can take up with the challenge. 
Now I make up my mind to start AT next spring. I have not set a finish date yet. I don't want to set one. I just want to see how far I can go. I do want to complete the whole trail in one season, to be one of the 2000 milers.",,View Entry,"Oct 26, Fri",0

Having been trained as a scientist, practiced software engineering, now manage our family business, I have been bonded to office chairs 5 days a week. This is not real me. My soul wanders freely. When other kids were taking an after lunch nap, I was roaming near my house to either draw flowers or looking for worms. I was also dreaming about be a nomad while working towards my Ph.D degree. I longed for a simple life, a life can allow me stay moving and stay outdoors.With the progress of technology, we have been creating lots of trash, burdening the earth and damaging the environment. By going back to simple way of living, I hope I can waste less. I can leave less impact to the unique planet that has been so kind to us. Hiking the Appalachian Trail will give me the opportunity to do both.",,View Entry,"Oct 31, Wed",0

Just couple of days ago, I received the trail data book, planning book and a guide book. There are tons of information in these books. I will map out my rough itinerary in a couple of weeks. I also bought a wall hanging AT map that I put in my bedroom to look at it from time to time. It will give me an overall feeling of the trail at large. The most challenge task is to plan offload my work duties to someone else, with the possibility to multiple people so that our company will be still functioning as smooth as it is now.

Simply Mei becomes Click,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607890,"14 days before my start time!Tonight I packed all gears that I plan to take with me one more time. When I laid them out on the floor, my first reaction was “Gee, why so much stuff?!” They weighed 21 lbs for my summer gears and 24lbs for the winter gears. I know, I know. I have been trying to practice lightweight backpacking for a few years. But A few heavy items have been never able to leave me. The Olympus OM-D E-M1 mirror less camera is one of them! And I don’t feel comfortable without microspike for winter travel. The good thing is that I am not the one who can consume 2lbs of food on backpacking trips. At least not at the beginning two weeks. So my food weight will be lighter. I estimate my max pack weight will be about 35lb at the start, which is still manageable. In the past months, in addition to AT trip planning on paper, I also practiced snow camping, hiking in the rain, hiking with sandals for stream crossing. Mentally I am still nervous for the trip, especially with the weather report in the last month.Well, I am ready!In the next two weeks, I will prepare food for the first week. And my dear husband can join me for the beginning of the trip :-)",,View Entry,"Mar 11, Mon",0

In the past two weeks I have been doing more preparations for this trip. Cut my hair very short, I was mentally committed to this journey. :-)
Also I did meal planning and gathers all the food for 2 people for the first 6 days of hiking. The food I prepared for my husband and me are simple meals not much different from what we'd bring for weekend backpacking trips. For breakfast, it has oatmeal, milk powder, coca powder and crackers. We'll add bread or bagels before the day of our start date. For lunch, we'll have energy bars, dried fruits and nuts. Most of these were the things I bought from Beijing earlier this year. Even though I don't mind eating the ones available in US market, a change of the flavors is always nice. Lastly for dinner, we'll have angels hair pasta and home made seasonings and dried vegetables. We'll also have lentils and quinoa. Dried pork sung and salmon sung add to more flavors. We'll get a little bit of pickled vegetable later from Asian market.  My plan is to do about 8 to 14 miles hike for the first week. Get resupplies for the first time in Hiawassee, Georgia. From that place, I'd expect no exotic Asian food in our diet for quite a time.
Many of my friends invited me for lunches and wished me good luck. Thank you every one! Your encouragement meant so much to me.
As time gets closer and closer to my departure date, I felt more calm and peaceful. The nervous feeling in my stomach that I experienced a month ago kind of subsidized. Reading trail journals of the hikers who have already started their journey before me helped. Knowing the weather will be getting better by the time I am out there in the open also made me more comfortable.",,View Entry,"Mar 21, Thu",0
Simply Mei becomes Click,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608641,"2 days before startThe old pals ....Tent: ZPacks Duplex -- The tent only weights 21oz. I have used it in winter camping as well. It could be difficult to setup in high wind. I was debating with myself for a long time trying to decide taking the tent or a tarp. At the end, the tent will go with me, mainly for the bug protection. In the rain, the tent may be much better. When needed, my poncho will work as a small tent for cooking in the rain.Sleeping bag: GoLite 20 degree quilt -- It is like a blanket + a foot box. I like the warms and puffiness of this light weight quilt, only about 1.3lbs. Together with a winter hat some clothing, it is quite nice for 3 season backpacking. In cold night, I can wear my down jacket to add more warms.Sleeping pad: A closed cell foam pad similar to Therm-a-Rest Z lite. I cut off about 1ft from it, creating 2 sit pads. It is soft, never break, and can be easily used anywhere as a seat on both dry and wet surfaces. I had it for so long that I have already lost one sit pad. The sleeping pad still in great shape after hundreds nights of usage.Backpack: Lowe Alpine Zepton ND50 -- This woman specific backpack is a lightweight internal frame pack. It was the only lightweight pack that fit me when I was in the market shopping for one 8 years ago. I bumped into it in a local sports store that has been permanently closed its door :-(. The bag is very easy to fit a full sized bear canister horizontally. The super strong dyneema fabric hardly show much of wear and tear. I used it from Tanzania to Patagonia, it endured the journey on JMT. I used it in both summer and winter times. The heaviest load was 42lb on a snow climbing trip. There is only a couple of small holes in the side soft pocket. I attached a small nylon zipper bag on its hip belt to put small items in there for easy access. The bag is about 2lb and 3 oz in weight.Kitchen: JetBoil Flash cooking system -- I choose this only because I saw posts online saying that the fuel (canister) is easy to find along the trail resupply stores. Normally I use a tiny Esbit titanium folding stove (only 0.4oz) for my backpacking trips. including the JMT trail for my family of 4 for two weeks. But the fuel would not be always available on A.T.. So JetBoil goes into my pack. Adding to this I have a fuel canister stand, one pair of shortened chopsticks, one large spoon, biodegradable soap repacked in a small hotel sized shampoo bottle, a cut off section of wash sponge, some small containers with salt and seasonings. Total of the cooking system is about 1lb. Clothing: A non-brand long down jacket, a thin polar fleece pullover, one pair of hiking pants, one running short, 2 quick dry long sleeve T-shirt, one quick dry buttoned shirt, one quick dry long john, 3 underwear, 3 pairs of wool socks. One winter hat doubles as camera bag, a pair of thin gloves, a bandana. For the protection from the rain, I will carry an umbrella, a poncho (also can work as a tarp), a pair of ""legs"" (rain pants with only the leg section), and a pair of short lightweight home made gaiters. Personal Hygiene: To keep me civilized, I have a Ziploc bag of toothbrush with shortened handle, a small bar of soap, dried tooth paste cut into small drops. I can chew on each drop when brush the teeth. I used these many times in backpacking trips. It's like eating a jelly bean with tingling, quite nice as long as you don't swallow it. I also carry a small comb. It is good that I cut my hair very short so that I can just use the soap to wash my hair, saving the weight of shampoo and conditioner. A large roll of TP goes to a plastic bag with tent stakes as diggers. I also carry a 2 gallon plastic Ziploc bag for wash my cloth and a tiny folding bucket to fetch water.First aids: Home assembled Band-Aids, medicine for pain killer, diarrhea treatment, tapes for prevent blisters, electrolytes, rubber gloves, keen band, etc. in a nylon flower print bag. Total weight about 8oz. Also I will carry a double layer orange colored emergency blanket.Electric Gadgets: OK, I have to admit that going on the trail for many months does not mean I can cut off from modern world ruled by electronics! The list of my gadgets is long.1. InReach -- The communication tool that allows me to tell my loved ones about my location, text messaging by satellites, and a SOS button that connects to search and rescue management center. It's provide peace of mind for my loved ones and friends, as well as for myself. I have use it for over 3 years and loved the low monthly cost. Together with its free topo map  EarthMate on my phone, it also helps me with navigation on the trail. 2. iPhone 5 SE -- This is a small phone with a big storage of 128GB. It will be my pad for writing and reading. i have downloaded many books on it. I will also use the EarthMate topo map. And communicates with my folks.3. GoalZero solar charger + flip 30 -- It is heavy! But it has been kept my phone charge everyday on other long trips. Even though A.T. is covered by leaves. I am still willing to give it a try.4. Olympus E-M1 O-MD + 12-40mm lens -- I cannot go on a trail without it. In the past 4 years, it had accompany me to so many places (also with different lens). It is water proof, dust proof, drop proof and freeze proof. In my test, the freeze proof seams over rated, but the other 3 have been well tested on trails year round, from below sea level to above 19000ft. It's about 3.5lbs. The only drawback was the short battery life. So this means I have to carry 4 additional backup batteries and a charge and cable. It can take a large space in my pack. And total weight about 4lbs.New stuff ...Bear bag: Between Bear canister and Ursack, I finally decided to buy the Ursack major for the packability and weight savings. Plus a 50ft of bear bag rope. This cut at least 1lb from my wild-idea bear can. It can holds our 2 people's 6.5 days of food. I got to practice more on bad hanging technique on trail.Boots: My current Keen is at the end of its life. So last year during the holiday season, I bought two pairs of boots -- Keen and Merrelle. The Keen has lived well with its reputation in terms of waterproof. The Merrelle has been a disappoint. So I will start with Keen first. If it can last long, I don't need to replace it with the Merrelle. Both have been broke-in in the past two months. For water crossing, I have a pair of Merrelle sandals which I have used for a year and had good results for creek crossing.Folding bucket: I have to brag on this find. Sea-to-Summit ultra folding bucket. It is soooo cute. Only 1.5""x2.5"" in size when folded, it has 10L capacity and weight less then 2oz. I liked it. I'll see how good it is when put in use o trail.Stuffs left at home ...Microspikes -- Now that I read more blogs from trail (Thanks everyone who posted pictures), I don't think I will need it. Winter puffy sleeping socks, hand and toe warmers, and extra down vest.",,View Entry,"Mar 23, Sat",0

No rain, no pain, no Maine. This is the motto of A.T. On our first day on the trail, we got lots of rain already. With a little bit of pain, Maine is still more than 2189 miles away!
We started from the beautiful Amicalola Falls State Park. Our friends Iris and Hu drove 150 miles to send us to the trailhead. Thank you so much! We are in debt to them forever. I hope they will visit us in CA in the near future so that I can return their favor.
At 12:20pm, we left the state park after a short orientation by a park ranger. He suggested each one of us to pickup trash along the trail in Georgia, 5 pieces a day, before exiting the state park, I have picked up more than 7 pieces. And dumped them in the last trash can I saw in the park. I don’t plan to carry them all the way to Maine.
   The approach trail is very beautiful. After a short section of flat trail, we came to the base of the 728ft Amicalola Falls, we started to climb 600 stairs to the top of the Falls. It’s a powerful sight to watch the water tumbling down the cliff. It’s a disbelief to huff and puff up the steep stairs only to find out there is a large parking lot at the top of the Falls.
   After leaving the state park, we hiked a few up and downs on the approach trail for 7.5 miles to the top of the Springer Mountain - the southern terminus of A.T.  Along the way, the rain followed us on and off. As the ranger said, as soon as you put on the rain jacket, it stops. As soon as you take it off, it starts again. It was like that for about three hours before it got serious, and continued non stopping for two more hours. When we reached Springer Mountain, the sky is so dark that we were barely see more than 15 feet. So we decided to overnight at Springer Shelter instead of pushing for another 2.8 miles to the next one. It was proven a great idea, for in the next two hours, the rain turned to hail with gusty wind. And the water just slammed at everything horizontally. The thunder and lightening also lasted 30 minutes right after we set our tent up.
We are happy to get about nine miles done today, even though officially we are only 0.2 miles on A.T. I loved the overall atmosphere of today’s hike, especially when the rain was light, and the forest was engulfed in the thick fog. Also once we left the large parking lot at the top of the Falls, I hardly see any trash :-).
~ Sweet dreams for now. Tomorrow it may still be raining, and we plan to do more mileage.","Amicalola Falls State Park

The wind was very strong last night.. the rain didn’t stop till morning. The forested camp ground seams well protected. But it’s wet, wet everywhere. We used bandana wiped off water from our tent ceiling. The humidity was sure 100%.
When we started hiking again at 10am, the weather cleared. We had all nice soft trails for the full morning. We made good progress till our lunch break at Long Creek Falls. Along the way, the trail crossed 3 Forks, a beautiful converge of two wide creeks. The clear water, soft brown path lined with rain cleaned shiny green leaves. When we reached the lower elevation below 3000ft, huge areas were covered by rhododendron bushes. Many of them had flowering buds forming. Given a month or two, they will be very pretty.
Today’s trail also crossed an army base. We heard many gunshots and saw a few helicopters flying back and forth a few times.
During lunch break, we took almost everything out to dry. It’s a nice 45 minutes break at a campsite. It had a little breeze and intermittent sunshine, dried our sleeping bag, tent and ponchos nicely. It was crucial to dry our gears when it’s possible. By 4:00 pm. It started raining again.   The rain lasted 5 hours, and still going as I am typing the journal. We got wet again, this time mainly during the 15 minutes when we set up the tent. And today, our boots were all soaked. Tomorrow, we will have to hike in wet boots and clothes.
This morning I also got a bad news about my 94 years old father. He checked into an ICU last night in Beijing. I hope he can make it. While I hiked, I thought about him all the time. He’s my hiking and travel angel. His love of the world history, culture and nature’s wonders imprinted in my heart, too. While he’s fighting for his life in hospital, I am his eyes and legs to take the challenges on A.T. Dad, I want you to win this battle!","Springer Mountain shelter

In the morning, I put on wet pants, wet sock and boots, and wet pullover, claiming it was very refreshing, very refreshing! Within an hour of hiking, my wet clothes have dried up. The cold socks also warmed up and felt ok.
It was a blue bird day all day. Lots of sunshine. But temperatures were pretty low. So it was comfortable all the way. The forest also showed nice shapes of shadows. 
At lunch break, we reached Woody Gap TH with picnic tables, restrooms and trash cans. We took all of our stuff out to dry, on the table and hung on trees. It’s a great pleasure to have the sun and breeze. 
In the evening, we reached Blood Mountain shelter. It is the highest point on A.T. In Georgia. On the rocky top, we set up our tent and watched the beautiful Sunset. This is the first time for me to practice bear bag hanging. It was not easy.","Gooch Mountain shelter

The wind howled pretty bad last night. It only calmed down after 5:00 am. I didn’t sleep much. I dreamed of my father. He went back home from hospital. I was happy to see him. He seams happy to see me, too.
The sunrise was beautiful from the top of Blood Mountain, which consists of large slabs of rocks. Knowing that we’ll pass through the Mountain Crossing outfitter and gift shop, we skipped breakfast to go there straight. In there, at 10:00 am we had pizza, banana, coffee and hot cocoa. It filled us up nicely for none of us wanted lunch till after 5:00pm.
Today’s trail had more rocky sections. That takes more focus and careful footing. Whenever I got on the Flat soft dirt section of the trail, I felt so happy. It’s really funny to realize how little things can bring such a joy.
The A.T. May not have the splendid grand views as in JMT. But it’s a beauty in its own way. It is more humble and subtle, something brings peace and calm in me. Something that I can hold more closer. Walking in Georgia’s still leafless forest, to see the sunlights dancing from tree to tree, to discover fancy rock formations by surprise, I just feel as lucky as when I was on JMT.
In early afternoon, at Tesnatee Gap, we had our first Trail Magic. I never expected to meet this so quickly on A.T. But here a 4 persons crew laid out tables and lounge chairs. They displayed ice cold sugary drinks, hot coffee and chocolate, all kinds of snacks, candy bars and donuts. They are all free to thru-hikers. And they don’t even want any donation. They are doing this just for giving thru-hikers support. Thank you trail angels! 
There was a whole A.T. Map hanging on trees. We found the location of this spot. It was right near the beginning of the trail!
I have continued picking up trash from the trail. Majority of the trash were near parking lots or trailheads. So most backpackers have been doing a great job to keep the trail clean.","Blood Mountain shelter

We had a very short hike today in expectation of tomorrow’s two long uphill climbs. The tent was up before 2:00pm. It’s good to have a slow day. Many thru-hikers also camped here, and plan to go to Town of Helen tomorrow. We will skip that town and continue for two more days before recharge. 
I continued trash collection. A few pieces near our last night campsite ~ to keep the backpackers’ promise ~ always leave a camp cleaner than when you arrive. Also some plastic wrappers actually was on trail! Hi, hikers and backpacker, please be really pay attention to your stuff! I know people don’t trash around intentionally. Most of the trash was littered when they pull something out of pocket and the trash just fell out without knowing. So it is a good practice to always put your trash in a place that you don’t need to access to. 
While I was hiking and thinking about the differences between California‘s Sierra Nevada mountain range and Appalachian mountains, I felt the former is a place worth more for worships, and the later is more homey, a place nice to make it home.
I got messages from my sister that our dad condition has been improved. Still in ICU, but not getting worse. I am very happy to hear this.","Low Gap

We hiked 4 more miles than planned despite lots of elevation gains. In this way, we will have only 7.5 miles to reach our rest/cleaning/resupply spot tomorrow at noon time, leaving more time for us to do all the things in a civilized world.
This morning after we came down the steep rocky trail to Unicom Gap, we saw the Georgia Appalachian Trail Club plaque. We also met Susie, a trail maintenance volunteer, repairing the trail. Thank you for the great work! Overall, A.T. In Georgia is in great shape. It’s all the efforts of nice people like Susie.
Today we had two long sections of up hills, 1100ft and 1300ft each. The second one tops Tray Mountain. Many day hikers and thru-hikers stopped there to take in the views and enjoy the well earned breaks. The top is a tiny area of rocks, hardly fits 10 people. After Tray Mountain, we pushed on, with an additional 500ft and 4 miles, we stopped for camping before 5:00pm.
By now we have seen quite a few familiar faces ~ thru-hikers who are on the similar pace and stopped at the same camping location each night. All are friendly people. It felt like a village now when we camped.","Blue Mountain Shelter

Last night the wind and rain came rapidly after midnight. Fortunately after 7 am it became very light rain. But the wind was still very strong and and rain drops turned into icy drops. We packed fast and started moving before my desire to cook for breakfast. It was cold.
I walked briskly in the cold strong wind, “exhilarating” I shouted over and over to give myself more energy. After about 4 miles into hiking, at a turn of a hill, the wind suddenly stopped. All the howling sounds disappeared. The rain drops also stopped. The morning sunlight peeks through cracks of clouds. The mountains were quiet, it felt like everyone stopped breathing, just observing attentively for a new world to be born. A new clean world.
Before noon, we walked into the Top Of Georgia hiking center ~ a hostel that provides beds, hot showers, laundry, breakfast and free shuttle to the town of Hiawassee for resupplies and nice dinner. It’s a great place to stay for A.T. Thru-hikers. They have so many advices and stories for newbies like us. I got fully charged in here.","Sassafras Gap

The shuttle driver dumped four of us at Dick Creek TH “have a good hike, you all fools!” Don’t get him wrong, he is a really nice guy - 2 times A.T. Thru-hiker and the first one completed Erin cannel thru-hike. He also gave us so many good advices. One of that is - Try to get to the Hot Springs by all means! The hot springs is 275 miles from A.T. Southern terminus, we’ll pass the challenging terrain of GSMNP.
I also said goodbye to my husband this morning. Work duty calls! From today, it will be my own journey! For many hours in the morning, l let my emotions run lose. The moss and leaves were my Kleenex. And the trail had plenty of them! I missed him a lot. But going back with him never came to my mind. Actually I felt very lucky that he was able to do a section with me together, especially from the start when everything on the trail was only a concept on paper to me. I am very thankful to him that he allowed me to “feel the trail” with him as my assurance.
At 1:15pm, I reached the border of GA/NC. A wooden sign on a tree marked the spot. One state done, 13 more to go! In the register paper, I wrote “I am a fool :-)”.
Immediately after entering NC, the trail went straight up for about 2 hours! What a kind of welcome is this? The going was slow. But eventually I reached Muskrat shelter by 3:40pm, just in time to squeeze me in the shelter. Tonight it will be the first time that I will sleep in a shelter with 5 other strangers. It was cold today, hopefully the shelter will be warmer than tent.","Top of Georgia hostel

Sleeping in the shelter in a cold night was a mistake. The empty space beneath the wooden floor just sucked every bit of your body warmth  away. I went into my sleeping bag with warm feet. By midnight, my feet had lost all the feelings. I was restless for many miserable hours. The lack of sleep also made today’s hike more tiresome even though the route was not particularly difficult.
By noontime, I reached the top of the Standing Indian Mountain - the Cliff-top views to the south gave it the name “Grandstand of Southern Appalachians”! This was after all morning snow. The Sun finally showed up when I was on top of the mountain, making hot water for my lunch. The views were fantastic! There were even dandelions on the top! Someone pointed out the Blood Mountain far far away. It was amazing that we had walked this far in a week!
Overall, this was a very cold day. It was so cold that my phone was shutting down by itself when I was sending messages under the sunshine. I was all bundled up while hiking. 
When I was trying to boil hot water, the jetboil was hard to ignite due to cold. So I opened the back up matches container that I bought in REI in Greenville, SC. To my surprise, there is no single match in there, only two tiny strips of striking paper. The same thing that I bought from REI in Bay Area has 25 matches. I was so disappointed by this. Fortunately after keep pushing on the ignition on Jetboil, I had fire going. 
Tonight, I will sleep in my tent for better warmth. Tucked in at Carter Gap, and sweet dreams.","Muskrat Shelter

Today’s word of the day is “Wayah” - a Cherokee word for “wolf”. Wayah Gap, Wayah Bald and Wayah Shelter. The sound of Wayah was so exciting to me that I kept saying “Wayah, Wayah” all the way. They are places pretty far from  my starting point. So by the time I reached Wayah Bald Stone tower, I cannot help but shouted “Waaaaayaaaah!”
In the morning, there was a section that followed a singing creek. The sound of water was so pretty. So I started to sing my own song:
You sing a song,
I sing a song,
The song of water.
You sing a song,
I sing a song, 
The song of forest.
The morning Sun-shines warms the earth,
The birds also sing together with me.
You sing a song,
I sing a song,
The song of water.
You sing a song,
I sing a song, 
The song of forest.
The morning fresh air, breath-in deeply,
And it makes me smiling.
I made more friends on trail. They all want to help me with hanging of bear bags since it took me forever to throw the rope on high branches. Thanks friends!
I. Also met four grandma aged ladies on trail today - two backpackers, one thru-hiker and one day hiker. I really admire their attitude. Many my fellow Chinese ladies at their age would just stay home to take care of grandkids. Going into the wilderness by oneself is considered insane. But it is so common to see senior Americans still active the same as the younger generations.
In the past a few days, I realized that I have under estimated elevation gains for most of the days by about 500ft, some days even more than 1000ft. I did the calculation based on the AT planning tables. However, when landmarks are at similar elevation, doesn’t mean the trail is flat between them. Usually there is a hill needing to climb over. Only looking at profile charts can give the reader a better picture. Like today, My old calculation showed about 2400ft elevation gain. It was off by almost 1000ft! Now the trail sounds more challenging.
The forecast has rain for tonight and all day tomorrow. It will be interesting again.
For now, I just tucked comfortably in my tent. Sweat dreams.","Rock Gap Shelter

Today’s theme was mud and water. Just as forecast stated, the rain started at 9:00pm last night. And it rained till 11:00am. So the trails were full of mud and water. It took extra caution to keep my balance. There were skidding marks everywhere on the trails. The balance act taxed my knees. Especially in the afternoon when the downhill sections became very steep and I was tired after long walks.
Overall, my body had been reacting nicely to the trail. Before this trip, my biggest worry was the plantar fascia that had been bothered me for many years. Thanks to soft A.T. dirt surface and my small blue massage ball, the pain on my foot has not got worse. It was actually reduced a bit since I started this hike. 
I saw so many wild flowers along the trail today. Especially bunches of bleeding heart at a moist location, one of my favorite.
For the night, I checked into Nantahala Outdoor Center hostel. About 10 of our hiking friends had a nice dinner in the Restaurant on the river. It was always nice to have fresh cooked meals, especially with fun friends.","Wayah shelter

I had a video call with my dad in Beijing a little after 5:00am. He looks a lot more healthier. It worth to get up early for the call. After that, I ate breakfast in the river’s End restaurant and shopped for more resupplies while running the laundry. I left the NOC near 10:30am.
Today is all climbing, almost 4000ft, from morning till mid afternoon when I reached Cheoah Bald. In the middle, there is a section named The Jump-up for a reason ~ it was straight up on a rocky ridge. The going was slow.
My left knee still hurt in the morning. Climbing actually was gentler on the knees. After I fully warmed up the knees were feeling better. Or may be it was due to an IBprophen pill that I took in the morning, even though it’s been expired 5 years ago. I still very careful to not put too much weight on my left knee.
When I finally reached Cheoah Bald, I ate a huge cookie as an award. It says 230 calories. Sure I have 230 calories boost. Only after I finished it, I read the label again, it says 2 servings per package. I just consumed 460 calories of sweet cookie! Well, this will be part of my dinner. On the bald, the views were great. I could see the mountains we had walked before, the steep ridge that I traveled yesterday, and the Smokies I will soon to reach。The mountains are calling...","Nantahala outdoor center

From where I stayed last night at elevation 3700ft to today’s destination at 1800ft, the A.T.table showed an easy hike of only 1200ft gain. The profile chart put a doubt on this. The trail gave me a hard reality check! Only the last 3 miles was the real downhill. The rest were felt more ups than downs. At the end of the 17 mile hike, I was happy to take a shuttle to Fontana Village Resort with another hiker, instead of going to an additional 1.5 miles to the “Fontana Hilton” - the Fontana Dam Shelter. 
Today morning when the rain started around 5:00am, I was already awake. As soon as I heard the rain drops on my tent, I jumped out of the tent to get my bear bag down. I don’t want it to get wet with 2 hours in the rain. In the tent, I ate my breakfast and packed as much as I could. Right after the daylight was bright enough to see the trail, I started hiking. On the long climbs, I made up the following words:
An umbrella in the left hand,
A trekking stick in the right.
Walking over the hills I puff and huff.
Long and long is the winding path.
Expecting great scenery after another turn.
The heavy pack ~ no com-PLAINTS.
The wet clothes, just breezy-COOL.
In the rain, I walk and feel free.
When these words were said in rhythm in Chinese, it sounded pretty funny. 
During my hike today, I passed many slower hikers - people I didn’t meet before. I also thought a lot about my hiking friends in Sierra Club Day Hiking Section back home. With many years hiking with them on those tough hikes, I was pretty good prepared for the long hikes like today. Thank you Ron, Dara, Landa, Bonnie, Hailen, Piotr, Rosemary, and many other hiking leaders! I felt very lucky to be one of that legendary group!
Also in today’s hike, I found that if I put no weight on my trekking poles, my knees actually felt better. Because my weight was more centered so that my knees didn’t need to do the extra work to keep me in balance. 
Near the end of my hike, the shower was on and off for couple of hours. It was after 5:00 pm, when the magical sunlights shone underneath clouds for two brief moments. All of a sudden, the forest was golden with sparkling rain drops, sparkling grasses, leaves and bright white and yellow flowers. All sparkles as diamonds in the spotlight. The moments came and gone faster than I can adjust my camera to capture the sights. But they were truly magical moments.","Locust Cove Gap

Shortly after leaving Fontana Dam visitor center, I got a taste of what it’s means to have the most rainfall on A.T. It rained and rained and rained. I made a mistake that I didn’t use my poncho. The umbrella worked just fine for the most of the day until after 3:30pm when it started the down pour! In a few minutes, my whole pants were wet. My boots were wet anyway long time before that since the trails had been muddy throughout the day. Now the rain just runs through my pants into my boots like a water faucet turned on just below my knees. When the trail has slope, it became a small fast muddy river. When it flattened out, it became a water pathway in a meadow. Now it’s near the end of the day, there is no sign of the rain to stop anytime sooner. Hopefully, it will stop tomorrow morning so that I can move on more easily. Mollies Shelter is said can sleep 12. I saw it has squeezed at least 16. There are people setting up tents outside too. 
It was not all this challenge actually. Just after noon time, there was a break from the rain. I had just reached the Shuckstack fire tower. It was windy, but the views on the tower was so worth it. I could see layers of mountains in the Smokies 360 degrees. The Fontana Dam and the lake formed by it was in clear view. The best of all were all the water vapor raising up from the mountains, some vertically, many changing shapes and swilling around, like spills made by fairies.
In the afternoon, I passed a large section of flat area. Even though the trail was very muddy, the grassy areas on both sides of the trail were carpeted with white wild flowers. It’s like millions of stars spread from the Milky Way.
In the past two weeks, I have experienced Georgia’s gentle trails - a great introduction of A.T., and North Carolina’s “fun” trails - a good warning and testing of thru-hikers legs and wills on A.T. Please notice the “fun” word was squeezed from my teeth!  Well, one had to make the best out of everything, right? Coming into Smokies, I was thankful for the gentle trails again. I would be more exhausted if there were not enough switchbacks for today’s sub-4000ft climb! With the muddy currents on trails, I don’t know if I could ever climb up without these switchbacks.
In these two days, I met new people who had started their hike as early as 3/17, more than a week before my start day. I am looking forward to get to the Newfound Gap and take my rest day from there.
Someone I met today suggested I use trail name “Click”. As I walked towards the shelter in the pouring rain, I shoot 2 pictures of the full house of people in the shelter. I think this will do.","Fontana Dam

The heavy rain at night pounding on the shelter’s roof sounded like drumming before a battle. It didn’t stop until almost 8:00 am in the morning. This made today’s trail a water trail. And the trail changed from gentle Georgia status to challenging North Carolina status, plus the water. There was no avoidance of water and mud on trails. So my boots kept wet and dirty.
On a hill before Thunderhead Mountain, there are a few big boulders. On the biggest one, someone carved their names. One was Tom, 1817, there is one in 1920s , and one in 1938! I was wondering who was Tom, and where he ended up with. The Thunderhead Mountain was not impressive. There is only a very small rock in the middle of the muddy trail, bear a US Geological Survey maker.
Today the weather was nice. after the rain stopped in the morning, there was no more rain. Sunshine and cloudy alternate throughout the day. White small wildflowers were abundant every where.

Anticipation! On this beautiful sunny day, the A.T. led me to its highest point ~ Clingmans Dome at 6643ft. 
Overall the trail was not too hard. Yes, it was a climb of more than 3500ft and it is over 13.5 miles. But with trails were drier, and inclines were gentler. I didn’t feel exhausted at the end of the day. 
When it was above 5500ft, I entered a spruce forest. These evergreen forest was wet and shady. The temperature dropped at least 10 degrees when you stepped inside it. Everything was covered by fresh looking mosses. The only browns were the path of A.T. I felt like a flying little fairy like the one in Peter Pen movie was in front of me, waving a magic wand to guide me through this forest on a path made of dark chocolate. I could just follow her forever. It was a forest that you want to be in there for a long time.
The last 0.3 mile to Clingmans Dome was surprisingly flat. There were many tourists up there. It has great views in all directions. I took a picture of the south - the mountains that I had been walking through, and a picture of the north - the mountains that I still need to go. 
As I am lying in the woods in my tent, and the night fell, a few birds made the last song of the day. A lullaby to a sweet dreams. My tent is setting on a layer of thick cushion of dried spruce.","Derrick Knob Shelter

A super easy day today! Because finally I am taken a break day at Galingburg, TN today and tomorrow. It was funny that just thinking about get a day off in a town can occupy my mind for day and night. I even dreamed of great tasting roasted beef this morning. Actually I am not craving for any meat. I am craving for fish :-)
After 5 miles of hiking I reached Newfound Gap, a huge parking lot with super clean restroom and a TN/NC state line marker. A van of trail angels was also there. They provided us with so much delicious food and drinks. I ate an orange and an apple and a cookie! So full that I had to skip my lunch later. They will be there every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday for April. A shuttle from the same church will run multiple times every day in April as well. Thanks so much for their support!
At this parking lot, I also saw my hiking friends again. They were behind me for a day earlier because they have taken a zero day a few days ago at NOC hostel. Now they caught up with me. And they will be ahead of me from now on since they don’t need to stop at Galingburg. I am wondering if I will ever see them again. They are stronger hikers than me. They can push 20 miles yesterday! With my knees problem, I will slow down a bit, and only plan to do less than 12 miles per day going forward till my knees improve.
I still consider myself lucky that I have been gone this far without having any big issue. I saw one of my friends duck taped her three fingers. Another friend has both big toes blackened and duck taped. Another hiked today with one sole of his boot falling apart and tied with shoe laces, while another sole half falling as well. I met a couple who had to turn back on their first day in GSMNP because the wife had a twisted ankle. Still all of them have good humor and spirit. That’s the things make our thru-hikers so lovable!

Late last night I had a terrifying moment. I accidentally sat on my eyeglasses and one of the leg popped out of the frame! I was desperately trying to fix it since I would be half blind without my eyeglasses. With my survival little knife, persistently trying, and lots of luck, I was able to push the leg back into the small bracket on the frame. A struggle of 30 minutes! I have to be more careful going forward.
I left Galingburg in the rain early morning. Then started hiking just before 9:00 am from Newfound Gap. The church shuttle driver told us that there was a huge fire about 3 years ago started by two teens playing with matches on Chimney Trail. 9 terrible days later, the fire had destroyed many structures in Galingburg, and 9 lives lost. I can still see the aftermath of that fire near the Town - burned trees littering the hills like pickup sticks.
Today’s rain was soft and gentle. It was on and off for all the morning up to mid afternoon. But it was the caring, nurturing type of rain. The rain of creation without destruction. The rain that brought lives without hurt. The rain that you can claim “I hiked in the rain” with a smile, not the one that you claim with a scream. The soft spring rain has made the mountains covered with new fresh green colors over the old passing greens of the last year’s. 
The trails today also brought the most spectacular views in the Smokies. In addition to the very popular Charlies Bunion, where lots of day hikers also went, there was long sections of walk along the ridges. At some places the width of the ridge were only 2-3 feet wide. If there were no trees on both sides of the ridge, it would be quite exposed.  From time to time when the trees thin out, the views of layers of mountains would appear. It was like a wave of blue, with different shades, from darker blue nearby to light gray white blue far far away. As far as your eyes can see, the waves just go on and on in all directions. Somewhere between layers of blue waves, the white steam/clouds raise up, dancing with breezes. And me, a tiny speck on the ridge trail, was walking slowly under a forest green poncho. The wind filled my poncho with air. I felt like a big green balloon floating along the trail.
At one place on trail, I saw pillows of mosses, different types growing interwoven with one another. There is one type of very fresh looking moss on big rocks. They grow like pincushions. I cannot hold myself but to touch them with my fingers. They are dry despite the fresh wet appearance, felty but soft. They felt like a black boy’s curly hair.
By late afternoon, the Peck’s Corner shelter was filled. Because it was off the main A.T. for 0.4 mile, it was relatively not crowded. All hikers were able to find a spot in the shelter. This was very good because a strong storm will come by midnight tonight. Hope everyone keeps dry and has a peaceful sleep.","Galingburg, TN

The speed of wind reached as high as over 50 miles per hour. With the wind it also came the slating rain. I hiked 3 hours for 5.5 miles. Soaked from waist down plus all sleeves. My fingers were cold to numb. Time to stop at the TriCorner Knob shelter. Many thru-hikers had the same idea. I saw lots of people from the same shelter that I stayed last night. My waterproof boots became a pair of buckets. At the shelter, I dumped almost a cup of water from them.

It took me almost two hours to get the feeling in my fingers back after changed to dry clothes, pulled up my sleeping bag and ate a big lunch. The wind blew cross the front cooking section of the shelter, making it unusable. Thanks to a big tarp that covers the entrance of the sleeping quarter, we had at least a dry area that we can hung our wet stuff. But the tarp was flapping constantly in the wind. So it was still cold in the shelter. Tutu, a hiker with long white beard, worked tirelessly for almost two hours to get a fire going. It was a tough job since all the woods were soaking wet. He pulled his alcohol fuel to make the fire going. Sleep&Slide, who stayed here last night also helped him with Vaseline soaked cotton balls.

By 7:00 am I already started hiking. It was no point to make a breakfast. The bear bag that I hang on the bear cables had been frozen solid. I could not get any food out of it. 
It was extremely cold and windy. I had my warm hat, two layers of pants and three layers of tops all day long. I had my poncho on for added warmth and wind protection for most of the morning too. The rain was very light, but most of the rain drops turned into ice particles when they hit the ground. For the most part of morning, I was above 5200ft. On the ridges, I looked at left, it was a winter wonderland with ice forming crystals (rimes) on every branches. On my right, the valley of green displayed the springs scene. Wildflowers added to the list of lovely colors. Couple of days ago when I went to the Sugarland visitor center, I learned many wildflower names. As I saw them again, they became more enjoyable.
By the afternoon, the trail started steadily going downhill. When there were about two miles from Davenport Gap, I can’t help but made up a song again - Goodbye the Smokies:
When I was entering the Smokies, it was a bad weather day.
Now I am leaving the Smokies, it is a fair weather day.
Bye bye the Smokies n’ bye bye the Smokies.
I wish I someday I could return to you ~ to see the FALL-COLORS day.

Changes of plan due to the storm 2 days ago was costly today. In stead of planed 3000ft elevation gain in one day, it was actually almost 5000ft in the course of 15.5 miles. I went through two peaks - Snowbird Mountain and Max Patch Summit. 
On the Snowbird, there is a cool looking FAA station, all white, very streamlined, like a spaceship from outer space. I took a long time to reach Max Patch since it was at mile 13.6. 0.8 miles before the Summit, SR1182 dirt road intersects with A.T.. Just when I was hungry and out of energy to push the last mile to the Summit, there was a trail angle! It was a very beautiful young lady doing the trail magic. She drove almost 11 hours from Philadelphia to here. And it was the best trail magic I have seen: grilled burgers and hot dogs, lots of fresh fruits and veggies in addition to the usual cold drinks and sugary snacks! I ate an orange, an apple, two carrot sticks and many pieces of watermelon! The last mile to the Summit became so easy after this. Thanks a lot to the beautiful trail angel!
Max Patch is a very popular destination for locals and thru-hikers. Many hikers I met on trail decided to camp at the Summit area. It has plenty of space since it is a huge grassy bald, that is big enough to land small airplanes. It has great views all around. Since it has no water and it is pretty windy at the top, I pushed on to reach the shelter 2 more miles down the trail. One thing I think is pretty cool near the Max Patch are many very old wood posts with A.T. white blaze on them. They were so old that there are lots of lichen growing on them to make them grayish green looking. And many posts had rotted into funny shapes.
There are also a lot more wildflowers along the trail. Some has very interesting shapes at different stage of their lives. I found lots of mints, too.","Standing Bear Farm Hostel

A good weather makes an enjoyable hike day. Especially in the morning when everything was fresh. Today’s star was Trilliums - the wildflower with three big leaves and three petals. They covered slopes after slopes with their big showy flowers. Some have petals as pure white as fresh snow, some have petals as rich red as Cabernet Sauvignon all with yellow centers. There were also some greenish yellow trilliums, but they were not abundant here as they were before and in the Smokies. When I hiked with my self made A.T. song, they all nodded in agreement in the light breeze and patched morning sunshine.
The A.T. song:
I’m marching on the A.T.,
I’m marching on the A.T.,
I’m marching on the A.T.,
From Georgia to Maine!
I marched in the snow,
I marched in the rain,
I marched under the Sunshine,
From Georgia to Maine!
I slept in a tent,
I slept in a shelter,
I slept under the stars,
From Georgia to Maine!
I saw wildflowers,
I saw wild animals,
I saw Spring, Summer and Fall,
From Georgia to Maine!
You can add more to this song with anything you want - the foods you ate, the drinks you drank, or the new friends you made every day on the trail!
I also saw many butterflies, big and small, white, black and blue. They all looked pretty. There were also lots of busy bees working on the flowers. Oh, and I saw a big black shiny snake. This is the second snake I’ve seen on A.T. The days are getting warmer, animals are more active now. I need to watch more carefully on the trail.When I near the shelter in the evening, I heard sharp calls “Ah, Ah, Ah” from a bird of prey!

This is a small village type of town, A.T. centric at this time of the year. I bet half of the population now are A.T. thru-hikers! From the trail looking down to the town surrounded by trees with spring fresh leaves, it does look as a lovely little village out of a storybook.

It was a nice Victoria house with shared bathrooms. There is no laundry in the Inn, so I hand washed a few small items and put them in the windy and sunny backyard to dry.

Rain stuck in Hot Springs, NC. Stayed all day in Elmer’s Sunnybank Inn, reading, eating and sleeping. There is a skylight in the washroom outside of my bedroom. The sound of rain drops splashing on it made so perfect sense to stay out of the wet. It’s a soothing sound only one can appreciate after the experience of cold helpless wet rain when everything against your skin was against your wellbeing, and one has no place to hide from it.
Elmer and Scott prepared a big tasty breakfast for us: coffee, tea, granolas, fresh cantaloupes, oranges and grapes, warm hearty biscuits and grits with gravy, all sorts of jams and honey, almond milk and regular milk. And for dinner, we were served with brussel sprouts and mushroom soup, salad with over ten variety of vegetables and cheese, a Thai flavored vegetable stew over rice, and a dense flavor packed lemon tart for desert. We were pampered. Elmer has owned this place for decades since 1970s. He really made it a home for all the guests. This historical place is captured in the year 2000 movie “Songcatcher”
In the afternoon I took a short walk in town to take some pictures in the rain. The river, which was calm and clear yesterday, has become a muddy mad current today carrying lots of logs down its course. Many hiking friends who left town yesterday came back to get a break from the rain. It was nice to chat with them, but at the same time, it showed how challenging the weather can be.
Thinking about the hike and camping in the wilderness (at least when it is dry), the following that I just read described it perfectly. 
“It is a kind of life that has a potent charm for all men, whether city or country-bred. We are descended from desert-lounging Arabs, and countless ages of growth toward perfect civilization have failed to root out of us the nomadic instinct.

I left Sunnybank Inn at 7:10am. After crossing the bridge over French Broad River and turned right on A.T. I was stunned by what I saw. The trail was a part of the River with the water level looked as deep as over waist. It was definitely impassible! A black pickup was washed down and stuck in the river by a tree! Scouting around, I found a use trail past a barn. It was steep. A wet rope dangling down from it. Didn’t know that I have other options, I tried on that route. Oh, boy, it was so steep. And with a big backpack on, it was not easier. I had to use all fours pulling on tree roots and rocks most of the time. I followed the big rock - called Lovers Leap all the way up. Based on my topo map, the top of Lovers Leap should join back to A.T.. with 40 minutes of hard climb, I was on top of this big rock. At that time. There was even a little sunshine broke the heavy layer of clouds. The views of Hot Springs, the flooded brown river and the green hills around it looked amazing! Another 10 more minutes scrambling brought me to the junction of the A.T. where two other thru-hikers just came into view. They told me the alternative route that going up on a paved road, then another trail. Gee, if I was knowing that! I promised myself that I will not climb on that type of trail ever! The climb was only about 0.3 mile, but it took me almost 50 minutes.
Today the distance to the shelter is about 11 miles. By 11:30am, as forecasted, a light rain came back, at first as small hails, then light shower on and off for the rest of the day. I saw may edible plans along the trail, ramp, garlic chive, scallion, violet, mustard, plantain, etc. I even saw a rotten wood full of Woodward. It’s the first time that I ever saw fresh Woodward. In a nice day, I might pickup a few plants and put them in my dinner. But today, all I wanted was to get to the shelter so that I can keep myself dry.

The weather man promised our hikers of cloudy in the morning and sunny in the afternoon. I only see about 3 minutes sunlight after 5:00pm. The whole day was very foggy or very dark clouds, threatening rain at any moment. It had a few drops, but never wet enough for me to put on rain gear. But the aftermath of the rain in the last two days was well noticed. Not only the trail was very muddy and watery, for miles there was snow covered areas. Adding the heavy fog, it was kind of creepy walking by myself in the dark and cold forest for a long time. It was also kind of cool. When the snow melts in the quiet forest, it makes lots of funny sounds. So you can imagine many different things. I did hear a big tree fell down with a loud noise.
In the afternoon, the trail goes through an exposed ridge line. The section was built with lots of big rocks. It’s so difficult to build, they put a plaque on the top of the ridge to honor Howard, the trail master. When the clouds lifted a bit while I was on the ridge line, I can see a green plain laying below the ridge on the west side, wide and flat, very very green!
I also passed 300miles benchmark!
A few people asked my hike yesterday by the Lovers Leap cliff as a detour to avoid the flooded trail. No one believed I could do that. I was actually very careful and kept a cool head yesterday. I tested every head hold and foot hold of the roots, rocks and ropes before putting my weight on them. I felt it was difficult, but not beyond my ability to do it. Also it was at the beginning of the day when my body was very fresh from the resting of the past two days. One young guy also took that route, and kept saying it was crazy.

At lunch time, I also met a guy who’s section hike A.T.. He also hiked over 1000 miles on PCT and plan to start CDT this year, too. He’s the first person I met who is really doing the triple crown! He can go more than 30 miles per day. 
In the afternoon cross a road, Rob was doing trail magic. It was the 4th I have enjoyed on A.T.. Rob owns a hostel that housed many thru-hikers for many years. He loves the A.T. Thru-hiking community and comes out to do trail magic often with a white van printed “The AT friendly Van” on its side. One guy I met on trail also gave me an apple. Thanks for all trail angels!
Tonight dinner I cooked my multi-grain lentil soup with some ramp I found on trail. At the shelter, there are ramp patched near it, as well as wild basils. Yummy!","Jerry Cabin Shelter

There is no better gift than met my husband in the morning after 2.5 miles on A.T.. He was visiting a customer in Asheville, NC, about one hour drive to Sams Gap where A.T. and hwy 26 intersects. He brought me lots of goodies and a week worth of food and other needed stuff. Meeting him, even just a little over an hour gave me big moral boost! Thanks honey, I always love you!
The food added quite weight to my backpack. I was carrying about 10 days worth of food now! There were several tough climbs today. Fortunately the wildflowers were constantly distracted my attention. Under the warm Sun, spring beauty - a small white and pink flowers, carpeted the mountains. Their perfume was so strong, it intoxicated me. I can’t help but walked very slowly to immerse myself into the fancy world of the wildflowers. I bet it smelled better than Chanel No.9!
It was a long day with a heavy pack. At the end, my legs felt like jello. I was so tired that it was the first time that I didn’t cook dinner. Just picked out the heaviest Big Sur energy bar (one bar = 3 regular bars), ate half of it, and drank some water for my dinner.

In the morning, I picked a few wild scallions and garlic mustard from a side of trail thinking to use them in dinner. But in a hot day like this, they got mushy in the afternoon, and I threw them away.
For most of today the trail was hot and dry except in the morning and in the evening where the trail followed creeks. So there were many small one-side with handle wooden bridges when the trail goes across the creeks. Many of these areas have lots of rhododendrons, and today I saw the first few rhododendron blooming. They were just before the trail crosses Chestoa Bridge over the Nolichucky River.
I was not careful yesterday afternoon when I lifted my backpack and twisted my right knee. I had some knee pain in my left knee two weeks ago. But after couple of zero days and the continuous walking that had made my muscles stronger, it had been no issue in the past week. Now I got this problem which I cannot blame anyone but myself. Again, it was minor. I am ok to go uphill without being bothered. But I had to slow down a lot when going downhill. I am planning to do shorter distance in the next four days. 
On the trail about 2-3 miles to the river, there were switchbacks. I got so bored and started making silly songs of the switchbacks that I called zigzags. The song did not have any meaning, mostly just silly words that happened to come into my mind. And they were always linked by sound “Zi-O Geo”. I started by predicting how many zigzags would be there. Then counted them one after another. I did notice the views of the river and the town Erwin are the best on zigzag 6 and 8. It had 19 zigzags, very close to 20 that I predicted. 
When the zigzags were done, I came across a road and got in front of a hostel called Uncle Jonny‘s. I had heard its names many times in the past 3 days. Many friends that I met on trail decided to stay there in stead of their original plan to go to the next shelter. I hangout in there for about an hour, had a can of Lemon soda and a chill dog since “Peach”, the beautiful lady who did A.T. Last year is doing trail magic at this place. So when I got to the next shelter about 5 miles away, I had the shelter all by myself. There were only 3 tents at the shelter. A very quiet night it will be.","Spivey Gap campsite

It was that perfect day for hiking today. As the precursor of tomorrow’s storm, today was overcast with sprinkles here and there. So the temperature was low, and there was no hot Sun beating down on hikers. 
In morning at a place where the trail  took almost 350 degrees turn, I didn’t saw the turn but kept straight on an use trail. It led me almost bushwhacked to a top of a hill with large rocks. The view was great. But there was no more trail to go. Checking my Earthmate, I noticed it was off the main A.T. by about 0.2 miles. So I had to retreat my footsteps to get back on the main trail. Later at Indian Grave Gap, the trail angel “Brother Tom” told me there have been other hikers missed that turn too. It was funny that with my concentration on getting back on the main trail, my knee can do all the maneuvers without feeling any pain. This reminded me of a hiking guru I met two years ago. This man from Fresno, CA can hike up to 64 miles per day. When I asked him if that made his feet hurt. He answered “Yes. But I just ignored it. It’s all in your mind”. 
Hiking on the long distance trail let me experience the most treasured ideas of American: “Liberty as in freedom, Equality, and Fraternity as in universal love”. Freedom as that I can do the things I believe in, with proper preparation and my hard work, that I can achieve my goal. I am not limited by my gender, age, educational background, or my family’s status. I observed other hikers with the same determination and enjoying their freedom too.  As an immigrant to the US, this freedom means extra precious to me. Equality as all the hikers are facing the same challenges and getting awards from trail equally. They hear the same bird songs every morning. The wildflowers bloom the same way for all.  To reach their goal they put the same one step after another walking the same pathway from Georgia to Maine. Regardless what they were before, regardless how much wealth they have, the trail let them to discover themselves, and gave them the same dignity.  Love as expressed by looking after each other everyday whether they knew the other before or not. As expressed by trail angels who provided trail magic out of pure kindness to strangers. I have asked many of them if they take donations. All have said no. Some told me the best donation we can give is to do the same trail magic for next year thru-hikers. Some said that if they could not afford this, they’ll not be doing it. It is all just helping people with their needs, the love without any expectation of return back to the givers. This is the best of American values. This is the American that I always wanted to experience and introduce to people. 
I felt very lucky to be able to do this long trail. It is not something a weekend backpacking trip can provide. I am the privileged few who have the means and the supports to take on this journey.  To the forefathers who created this trail and to the people who worked tirelessly to maintain this trail, I am always grateful. Either the A.T. , the PCT, CDT, or the Great Redwoods Trail in the making, they are bringing the best out of American people.","Curley Maple shelter

The challenge started after8:00 am when the rain came and lasted for almost the full day. It was not as bad as last time when I was still in the Smokies. But when I reached Iron Mountain Gap, the strong wind drove the rain into my poncho like nothing in between. I got soaked in less than 15 minutes except my core. It was less challenging in the sense that there were a few breaks in the rain. And the wind blew dried my clothes somewhat in those brief moments. Near noontime, there was even a moment when the sunshine, no matter how weak it was, came through. It was a brief moment of hope. It really lifted my spirit. It was also so brief that in just a few minutes, the sunshine was gone. The wind blew in dark clouds and the hope disappeared faster than I can count to 3. Then I got soaked again the same way as it was. 
I was planning to stay in the next shelter 9 miles away. However when I got there in early afternoon, the man with mental problem was there by himself. I was not comfortable staying there with him. So I pushed on to Hughes Gap, hoping to camp there for the night. When I left the shelter, it started hailing. I was so determined that I hiked through the hail. On Little Rock Knob the wind sounded like hundreds of trucks on highways. I was grateful that the trees gave me some protection from the strong wind.
3 backpackers I met on trail told me someone was doing trail magic at Hughes Gap. When I got there, there are another 8 they-hikers huddled under a canopy around a BBQ stove with fires burning on in stove. Immediately they fixed a grilled garden burger for me, and let me warmed up near the fire. The best thing from this trail magic was that they called Miss Janet in Erwin. And she’s coming with a van to take all of us into her house for tonight! As I am typing this journal in Miss Janet’s house, warm and clean and being fed, more than 10 hikers are also here watching TV comfortably.
During today’s challenging hike, my knee kept quiet most of the time. My backpack also felt feathery light. As I wrote yesterday, it is all in your mind. The trick is how can I master the art to keep them out of my mind all the time!","Cherry Gap shelter

This could be one of the best day for hiking! The air was cool and fresh after yesterday’s rain. The visibility was miles and miles. The section was not difficult. All the climbings were done in the morning. And with lots of balds the views were really opened up. 
In the morning after breakfast, all hikers who stayed in Miss Janet’s house last night took a picture together. There were 18 of us. Some slept in her house, some camped in tent in her yard, some slept on her porch, and some slept in the school bus converted hikers bus. I slept in her living room on the floor. Then 7 of us were delivered back to Hughes Gap in the school bus. The happy music accompanied us happy hikers all the way for about an hour. When we reached Hughes Gap, we found two groups of people were doing trail magic - one group was cooking breakfast and the other was giving hikers prepared sandwiches and goodies. I had an egg and half chocolate chips cookie. 
The temperature was in mid-40s when I started hiking at 10:00am. The morning had about 2000ft climb to Roan Mountain. Quickly I warmed up nicely. But since the temperature stayed low for almost the whole day, I never got overheated. Just cruising along through the ridges, a fairytale like camping area, the spruce forest with the most delicious smells, and later the views through the Balds. 
A little after lunchtime, I reached the Roan High shelter - the so called coldest shelter on A.T. , also the highest shelter as it sits at 6285ft. It was a nice shelter. It was indeed very cold. I noticed lots of ice on the trail near the top of Roan High Bluff. I was glad that I came here today in a sunny day, not yesterday in the rain storm.
Being this is a Saturday, there were many day hikers and weekend backpackers on the trail. And we hit a record high of 3 trail magics in one day! The third one was near the Carter Gap just off Roan Mountain where day hikers were on trail in incredible numbers. One guy was holding a paper with a big “7”. He told me his the 7’s group of hikers today who joined the organized hikes.
At the end of day, many thru-hikers that I have aquatinted with came to Overmountain shelter for the night. There were also many weekend backpackers in here. Some are family with children. It is one of the best camping area near A.T.. the shelter itself is a large barn. And the camping area near the shelter has very nice views. 
After Roan Mountain, the A.T. Will stay below 6000ft for a very long time, till it reaches the Whites in NH.  Does this mean it will be a little easier?","Hughes Gap

In early morning I passed Litter Hump Mountain and Hump Mountain in cold high wind. The sky was covered in dark clouds which threatened to rain at any moment but never delivered a drop. I can see in the far distance to the east, the rain draft threads were touching down to mountain hills. There might be rained over there. At one time, a bright column of light pierced through a crack in the dark clouds, the light of heaven effect put on a dramatic show. Most of the time on the exposed balds I had no where to hide. I walked leaning against the wind to climb up the balds. A few times, the wind almost blew me out of balance. It was a lone traveler in vast empty space kind of feeling. Only cold dark rocks and a few sad looking small lone trees shared this harsh world with me. However sad looking, the views to distant mountains with fast rolling clouds still provided lots of entertainment and energy to the lone traveler.
The struggle against cold wind did come to an end after I got down into the forested level. By the time of early afternoon when I was near road US 19E, it was warm and sunny. The fresh green of the spring forest was so calming. The trails turned lazily turns. The creeks run lazily runs. Even the sound of water was the tune of slower tunes. Some of my fellow thru-hikers also slowed down. They set up their tents by a creek just an hour after noontime. The breeze moved the shadows of tree branches and leaves gently on their tents and their bodies, like a caring mother’s hands caressing her babies. And the trail again filled with the sweet smell of wildflowers, those closed petals had opened up responding to the warmth of the Sun.
Shortly after Doll Flat, I reached the sign “Leaving NC”. The A.T. finally done with North Carolina! I met bunch of hikers there. We celebrated and took a lunch break just before crossing that sign. Some mentioned that crossing this line means that there will be no more privy near the shelters. So no one wanted to cross that sign. Some even suggested that we walk back to Springer Mountain!  After sitting there for about 30 minutes, I finally got up and left NC for good! Soon all the young hikers caught up with me very quickly. For me I was happy to finish the section on NC/TN border. On this section, I lost the feel of belonging. I really didn’t know which state I was in at any given time. Even though it was just man made, rather randomly decided border to most people, and it really didn’t matter to the Mother Nature since the trees, grasses, flowers, animals and mountains on both sides are the same, it still put a confusing mind to people who are used to manmade rules. By finishing that section, my sense of belonging returned. I think it was also impacted me later in the forest that I felt extra calmness.
It was a sweet short day to me. I reached Mountain Harbor B&B and hostel around 2:00 pm. Resting well before returning to the trail tomorrow.","Overmountain shelter

Mountain Harbor B&B and Hostel makes very nice breakfast. Due to planed long hike today, I was thinking to skip the breakfast to leave the hostel early. But “Robin Hood” suggested strongly to have it. He had at least 3 times. So I signed up and very satisfied with the variety and quality of the meal. When I almost finished the breakfast, five big hungry thru-hikers came in. They said that they heard the breakfast is excellent, so they want to see if they can have some. The owner looked at the five big guys, all over 6 ft tall, and looked at the food on the counter. “Well, we can make some more for you, but not everything. Would that be okay?” All five immediately piled food high on their plates. The owner started making more egg dishes. I was amused by the scene. What would I do if five hungry men came to my place when it was not planned?
So I am in Tennessee! Sure and square! To me, Tennessee is always a romantic state: the country music, the southern hospitality, the idly way of life. I feel that even time runs slower in Tennessee. And the trail is definitely mellower. There was no killer climb today. Ups and downs were still added up to about 2800ft. But I didn’t feel them. In early morning, the green slopes covered with yellow, white, purple flowers. White clouds hung over the top of higher hills in the distance. Very soon, the trail skirts the bank of a happy clear river. Some campsite on the side of the trail were very inviting. Then just a short distance after I passed A.T. 400 miles mark, the beautiful Jones Falls was impressive and refreshing. Shortly after noontime, the trail passed Mountaineer Falls, a small but unique waterfall where the water leap over a big rock.
I hiked 18.8 miles today with 18.4 on A.T.. When I finally got to Moreland Gap shelter, I had only about an hour of daylight left. There was only one guy pushed to the same shelter today. Many people had set up camps along the way. So it will be a quiet night. The owls are out now. I can hear their “Ho Ho” calls.","Mountain Harbor B&B and Hostel

This has to be the best scenery on A.T. so far. 6 miles into the hike, I reached Denice Cove area. One creek was bubbling passing through flat rocks. It’s a perfect place to get fresh water and rest. Then the trail flattened out all the way to Denice Cove Road with beautiful fresh green leaves and bright flowers on both sides of the trail. An abundant barn with only frames left, blackened by the passing time, added to the imagination. On the road side, Rob - the A.T. friendly van was there doing trail magic. I had a nice cool Gatorade and a chocolate waffle cookie. He said he will be doing trail magic in these areas till June 22, then drive to Massachusetts for more trail magic. Thank you so much, Rob!
From Denice Cove, the trail entered Pond Mountain Wildernes. That’s where the beauty exists. It’s a flat trail following Laurel Fork River, at leisurely pace at first. Then it passed rocky cliffs on both sides. Many pink rhododendrons are blooming, some are over the cliffs and by the riverside. After a steep big rocky stairs pathway, I reached the great Laurel Fork Falls. It’s a quite large Falls. Over a huge rock, white water poured down in full force. It sparked under overhead sunlight. A few people were fly fishing standing below the white water wall. Their dark silhouette printed nice pictures against the white sparkle background. Down stream, the river jumps at multiple steps for a long long journey. And the trail, at some point, literally hugs the river on tilted rocks. At high water, hikers have to use another trail in this section. I was so happy that I don’t have to use the alternative trail, for that trail will not be able to see the waterfalls close.
The A.T. continues on the riverside for 2.5 miles with easygoing grade. It passed springs and two pretty looking foot bridges. At one point, a little sand beach was so inviting that I dipped my feet, up above my knee in the pleasure of the cold water. This area is so beautiful that it could be a great day hiking trip by itself.
In the afternoon, I had to climb up almost 1700ft in 2.5 miles. It’s hot and hard work. But that’s just what’s needed to be done. And I even saw orange yellow rhododendrons in this part of trail!
In the course of today’s hike, my hiking pants got a 3-inch long gush. The solution? I cut off a never used inner pocket from the pants and mended it this evening. I wished I had the matching thread for the work. But you can only do with what  is available. The sewing kit from hotel has 4 colored threads. I had to use 3 of them.

I left Boots Off Hostel in early morning. The A.T. along the bank of Watauga lake was still flooded. I followed a road for a little while, and reconnected with A.T. at a higher elevation place. Still around the lakeshore, the forest ground was covered by ferns and royal purple larkspurs. They looked like the best combination in the shades of tall trees. 
After I passed the dam that formed Watauga Lake, the trail goes higher in elevation following the ridge  of Iron Mountain for the whole day. In mid morning, I saw a pile of fresh bear scat. This is a bear active area. The forest service even closed the whole 5 mile stretch to camping, picnicking, or lingering. I was on the lookout for bears. But I didn’t see any today. 
However, I saw two types of flowers for the first time on the trail: may apples and blueberries flowers. Both of them were delicate white flowers. The may apple flowers are quite large. They look like a small globe before blooming. I never saw them in west US.
For many thru-hikers, each day we plan around the shelters. A shelter provided us with a sense of community, a reconnection place for hiking friends that you have made along the way, a sense of home, no matter how temporary it is. It also provides access to water, and sometimes bear cables and a privy - a little more convenience in the out country. The distances between shelters can be a few miles, or up to more than 18 miles. Each evening, when we reach the planned destination of a shelter, it is alway a relief for the rest of the day and the safe of the night. So I made a shelter song today.

In the early morning everyone rushed out of the campground. Many people wants to do high mileage today to get as close to the town of Damascus as possible, that was still about 26 miles away. My goal was to reach a shelter 16 miles ahead. So I had plenty of time to go mellow.
With the easy trail, I reached the old Osborne Farm in mid- morning. A giant AT marked the side of a weathered barn. In front of it, my fellow hikers had a great time taking video and pictures. And soon the will marked path led me back into the woods. 
The trail threaded on the ridges, passing some old home site with only a chimney still standing and a former fire- tower site with only a few bases of posts remained. Ah, the gone era in history!
In mid-afternoon rain came. More accurately it was shower. I could still see blue sky with white puffy clouds overhead, but the rain drops kept coming, and getting heavier. With umbrella I still got partially wet on the side where the wind blew in. The rain and breeze brought relief from the heat. It was quite pleasant for a while. Then it got too heavy, with thunder cracked near me. Fortunately there was an emergency shelter nearby. I went to there and waited for about 30 minutes for the heavy shower to pass. During that time three other hikers also got a break from the rain in the shabby emergency shelter. Because the clouds moved quickly, at sometimes it was sunny but pouring rain. It was always the most beautiful nature phenomenon when it happens. It’s one of my favorite sighting at all times. The rain brought water which is the stored energy from heaven. The plants soaked it up eagerly, every type of plants, all the trees, vines, bushes, grasses, wildflowers, all happily receiving the gift from heaven. Then the gift from sunshine came, brought more energy for the plants to grow. Every leaf danced in the breezes to welcome these gifts, they shine to show their happiness.

The early morning sun brighten my tent and the forest around the campground. In the morning cool air, I cruised through the last 6 miles of Tennessee mountains. Along the way, Patti Page’s soft song “The Beautiful Tennessee Waltz” swirled in my tongue, the sad but beautiful lost love fits perfectly in the pace of my hike. For the last five days, I waltzed with the mountains, forest and small towns of Tennessee, like a knife cutting through a piece of butter smoothly. Tennessee will always remains sweet and beautiful in my mind.
In early afternoon, I arrived in Damascus, VA - the most A.T. friendly town. But my guide book got me completely disoriented. After many inquiries in local shops, I finally got checked into The Broken Fiddle hostel which I thought should be on the second block in the town, it’s actually on the second block when get out of the town. So I got cleaned and resupplied here. Had a nice dinner in Mojo’s Trailside cafe. Tomorrow, despite the rain, I will continue for the long journey in Virginia.","Abington Gap Shelter

I left Damascus by 7:30am. All the hikers whom I talked to yesterday and this morning have decided to stay in town for a zero day. For a long time till mid afternoon, I felt I was the only NoBo on the trail. After 3:00pm, some NoBos caught up and passed me. I felt better that I would not be the only one in the shelter by myself.
The trail was full of rhododendron blooms now. Mostly are pink colored. There was one tree with orange and one with white flowers. Seeing them blooming reminded me our upstate New York house that had a sunroom surrounded by pink rhododendrons. In spring time, our backyard facing woods with oak and maple trees would turn green gradually from fresh light new growth new leaves to darker green mature leaves later. Staying in that sunroom either reading a book, drinking tea, or playing with my young boys were the best memory I had for the 6 years we lived there. Often I would stop doing whatever I was doing, and just stared outside on the young leaves of spring, holding that beautiful image in my mind. For the past 2-3 weeks, I have been reliving in that memory again, and still couldn’t get enough of it. 
Part of today’s trail intersected with creeper biking trail. That trail was converted from abundant railroad tracks. Since it was a Saturday, many bikers were on the trail. Their energy filled in the air.
Just as forecasted, the thunderstorm started at 4:00pm. I walked in the shower for about 1.5 hours before got to the shelter, partially wet, but not too bad. It turned out there were about 8 people were here, in shelter or in their own tents. The shower stopped after 7:00pm. Many birds sang their evening songs till it’s almost dark.","Damascus

It’s raining all day today with very little breaks for a few minutes couple of times. My plan was to hike 17 miles, but I only made it to 13 miles. Because I was in Mt. Rogers Area, and I want to see the wild ponies. By the time I reached the Thomas Knob shelter, I still haven’t seen any of them. And I was wet, cold and hungry by the time I got there. So a change of plan for today. I’ll see if I can see ponies tomorrow morning. They were right by the shelter 20min before I reach here. Other hikers showed me the video, there was even a baby pony! 
However disappointing with the ponies, I still have a great find this morning: at an edge of a pine grove, there were so many pretty fairy slippers- a pink flower with cute bubble shape. This was the first time I saw a fairy slipper flower. I never knew they are so big. All of them are size of chicken eggs. They made my day! For the rest of the day, I was in the foggy and mist of rain. So the magical forest feeling was back again.
The trail today also went through White Mountain - where it has annual ramp cooking/eating contest the weekend after Memorial Day. I did see many ramps on the trail. Picked 3 for dinner.","Lost mountain shelter

It was a right decision to stay in Thomas Knob shelter last night. By 7:00pm, the wind was howling and the rain slapped vigorously. The roof shook with heavy wind again and again. It lasted almost to dawn. When the daylight came, it was so cold. 
But the wild ponies also came to the shelter. They licked everything lick-able. From hikers boots to our backpacks. Anything that possibly has salt. When I took a video of a pony mom and baby, another pony started to lick my pants!
The sun was bright today. Shortly after a little more than a mile, I came to a junction with trail signs and big boulders. In front of the boulder, a stone marked 500 indicated the 500th mile from the Springer Mountain! Yes, today I reached 500 miles milestone! Continuously, I hiked through the Rogers mountain Wilderness and Greyson Highlands state park. More ponies were out to enjoy the Sun and tasty green grasses. 
AT&T cellphone signal almost nonexistent in VA mountains. I didn’t have any connection yesterday. In early morning not from the shelter, I got a little signal. Before I could finish one sentence with my sister asking about my father’s health, the connection was lost. Throughout the day, I checked on every hill and ridge without luck. I was only able to get connection until late afternoon at 6:00pm on the final ridge before my night camping place. All hikers have AT&T service complained about it. I may have to rely more on my InReach.","Thomas Knob shelter

Everyone planed to get to Partnership shelter tonight, which is 19 miles away. The big reason? Some restaurants in a town 6 miles from the shelter do food delivery! I was also aiming for the same shelter, only for the mileage, not the town’s food. It was a long way, but for my seasoned legs and mellow trails it was not that hard. I took many rest stops and still managed to finish the hike under 11 hours. There was a minor problem. With wet socks and boots yesterday, I had a couple of hot spots on my feet. So it was not a painless day. Also one of my trekking pole was broken yesterday. So I hiked with one pole and one stick. Kind of funny.
Along the trail, I passed a pretty little waterfall - Comers Creek Falls. Next to the Falls, there is a bridge with a note posted by US forest services. It says the bridge is unsafe. Hikers should either fold the creek or walk around using another trail, which adds about 1.3 miles. I looked at the fast moving, big boulder filled creek, and looked at the bridge carefully. I decided using the bridge is the safest option! So I crossed the bridge slowly and enjoyed the waterfalls from the safe end.
In the afternoon, when I was tired and slowed pace, I noticed lots of cool patterns with different leaves. Also there were so many shades of green in the forest. I started feeling being set free in this world.
Partnership shelter is the most beautiful one so far I have seen on A.T. . It assembled a log house with two level of sleeping floors and a big picnic table in its front porch. The privy is also the best one, more like the one you’ll see on road side trailhead restrooms than the basic rustic plywood construction of privy near other A.T. shelters. In fact, this shelter is next to the Rogers Mountains Recreation Area visitor center and next to its big parking lot. That’s why it is so nice and can call for food deliveries! Hikers tonight ordered larger pizza, huge calzone, foot long sandwiches, burgers, large fries. I believed everyone was over eating. On hiker had a huge bottle of Mountain Dew, must be 1.5 liter size, and he finished the whole bottle! I wonder if he can sleep tonight.","Hurricane mountain shelter

Simply Mei becomes Click,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612921,"VA continuously amazed me. Every day there was new discoveries. Today I saw many lily-of-the-valley producing flowering strings. Then on the trail approaching Glade Mountain, along the A.T. Line, it was an area of controlled burns. While I was climbing, on my left was green spring plants, on my right was blackened soil with nothing but large trees. I smelled the ashes all the way to the top of the mountain. All the birds stayed on the green side. The black side was a quiet zone.
By noontime, someone told me there is trail magic in the historical one room school house next to the Settlers Museum. When I got there, I discovered 4 large wooden trunks of goods in the school house. There were two coolers full of iced soda cans, one trunk of snacks and fresh fruits, and one trunk of supplies including medicines, sanitary items, sewing kits, etc. all provided by local church. Thanks for the thoughtful trail magic!
At the end of my hike in the afternoon before reaching highway 81, there was a swampy area with boardwalk. The plants in the swamp were all huge, must be about 20 times of the size of the same plants I saw on the hills. As I was studying the plants, a large rock caught my eye. And then I noticed the rock was studying me! It was actually a big old turtle! Its small eyes opened to stared back at me. I was amazed by the size of this turtle. Just its shell is the length of my lower arm.
Tonight I checked into a small motel, and kept thinking about that big turtle. Could it be over 100 years old? Did he already in this world when that one room school house was built in 1894? It’s very possible! WOW, that’s all I can say.","Partnership shelter

As soon as I crossed the highway and got on trail, a rabbit was 20 feet ahead of me. I smiled - turtle yesterday, rabbit today!
When I climbed on Little Brushy Mountain, before I was able to catch my breath, two sticks caught my eyes that were standing vertical. Next to them, stones marked 1/4 in a square of wood sticks. After a couple of seconds mind blank, I realized this marker means now I have reached a quarter of the total distance of A.T.! Great! Now I only have 75% to go.
From there, I was walking through a tunnel of rhododendrons for miles. This little mountain behaves as the most responsible child of Mother Nature. When mom says “Wake up, kids. It’s time for school play.” This one would be the first to respond “Yes, mom.” And he would be the first one to get out of bed, finish breakfast, and get ready for the show in school. His show would be always the best of the class. He might be mom’s favorite, but not so among his siblings. Maybe that’s why he got a not very respectful name: “Little Brushy”. The trees were covered with buds and blossoms. The buds are deep magenta, hot and energetic. They can burst with high energy at any given moment. The blossoms are light pink, partially transparent, so delicate that look like made of very thin glass. With a little touch, they might shatter. As I walked through this tunnel, my camera clicked constantly. Finally I had to force myself not stopping so frequently for I still need to cover about 16 miles today.
Many miles of today’s trail went through the easement of private properties. It passed ranches with black cows in grassy meadows. I like the way that the cows in American don’t wear bells. As the cows in Europe do (as I saw them in the Alps last year). It’s more peaceful for both the hikers and the cows. Passing through private properties also means the hikers had to climb many ladders over their wired fences. As first I was climbing the ladder with my backpack. It was hard to keep balance on top of the ladder when I had to turn 180 degrees on cross the wire. So in most cases, I took the backpack off, push it to the other side below the wire, carefully making sure the sticking part of the wire didn’t tear my backpack. Also push my hiking poles to the other side. Then climb up and down the ladders. I wish there was an easier way to do this!
In the evening a hiker walked into the camping area and told me he just saw a bear cub 300ft from here. So we better to make sure the food bags hang properly tonight. I have not seen any bear so far. I saw a huge black rat snake today as long as 3 feet, crossed trail from high grasses area. Also many dragonflies were out in the meadows.","Relax Inn near hwy 81

No bear came to visit us last night. I had a peaceful sleep of almost 9 hours. I had almost the same dream for the last 3 nights, and it was about the same food, my favorite desert. They were made of sweet rice flour. Four layers of sweet rice cake, layered with sugared paste of four flavors: black sesame powder, red bean paste, green tea powder, and sweet pea paste. Some also have walnuts and peanuts inside. They were soft, cool, sweet and chewy. Similar to Japanese desert of mochi, but replace in filling with layered sweets. People says hikers hunger would come to all thru-hikers. I maybe just get into that stage. I have seen other hikers, especially young ones, ate a lot of food, on trail and in restaurants. I am still just eat a fraction of theirs. But I also noticed that I need more lunch snacks in the past a few days. It was one energy bar + one serving of trail mix + a couple pieces of candy before. Now I need to add two servings of trail mix. And add a few more solid stuff in addition to oatmeal for breakfast. But in restaurant I still can only finish one cheese burger plus vegetable, forget about fries.
The rain didn’t come today even though the report said it had 30% chance. And it was good for the hike. I did 19 miles with lots of climbing in order to make it to a shelter. Almost 11.5 hours of walk. My knees have completed recovered, hot spots on my feet were gone, too. But I still keep the pace slow to avoid any new injury. At the end of the day, still very tired with sore muscles. 
Today’s first highlight was the view on Chestnut Ridge, with blackened clouds threatening for rain. The Chestnut Knob shelter is a stone building with a door and bunk beds in there. Could be rated as the best equipped shelter so far I have seen. The second highlight was a patch of lily-of-the-valley right after the rocky cropping on the Knob. They were in full blooming. Each string of flower looked like a string of pearls. And they have a very nice sweet smell. The ridge was very rocky. It has great views. But I put most of my attention to footing and flowers, so the views didn’t leave a clear impression in my mind.","Lynn camp creek

Instead of the original plan to do resupply in Bland, VA, I continued to next shelter. I still have enough food for 3 more days, just one day shy to reach next resupply town. And there will be two hostels on the way for next 3 days. This way, I will save one day time and the logistics to find a ride to the town. 
The walk was in the rain since 8:30 am for all day. Wet boots and socks, but dryish shirt and pants from knee up. The forest in the rain was very fresh and clean looking. The Laurel Creek under foot bridge was so happy jumping multiple steps of flat rock beds down its course, making small cascades along the way. The orange flowering trees, which I learned was fire azalea showed off nicely in darkened forest. When I reached VA road 52, out of the forest, I saw white steams rising and dancing all over the mountains. The green hills looked just like a landscape in a dream. At that place, a really nice food cooking smell led me into the little mountain outpost store. I had a cheese burger with Texas toast. Total satisfied my hunger. 
On trail today, I almost stepped on a cute little newt. I moved it to the side of the trail to prevent other hikers accidentally hurt it later.  The little cute newt has orange colored skin with green shining circles on its back. Back in CA, people says newt can represent the overall health of the environment they live in. So I hope I will see more newt in the coming days. 
For A.T. Thru-Hikers, most of them are responsible and decent people. Many are well educated and care a lot of the environment. But in the past a few days, I have met two young men kept talking about drugs they have taken, and bragging about how they cheated and stole goods from their previous employers. I felt so sorry for them and their family. How can someone so stupid to do all these things! I hope they can hike faster so that I won’t always in the same shelter with them.","Jenkins Shelter

I left the shelter in rain. The wet socks and boots don’t bother me anymore. The rain washed forest was refreshing to look and to smell. Over the day, it rained, then sun shined, then rained, sun shined, and rained again. The rain kept the air cool, which added comfort to the hike, also kept bugs at low level. 
In late morning, I passed the 600 miles marker, made of sticks, half mile from road VA611. 


After I crossed that road, a familiar figure came from the opposite direction. It was Mo “Lucky”, a trail friend whom I haven’t seen since the day I left Hot Springs. He was hiking at about same pace as mine before. So we had seen each other for many days and get acquainted. But since Hot Springs, he had been on different schedule, meeting other people off trail. I was glad to see him again. 


In fact I didn’t see any NoBo thru-hiker today in the 17 miles hike. Only Mo who’s walking to south, one day hiker, and another slakepacking NoBo at the end of day. So I was having the whole forest to myself almost entirely. To celebrate Mother’s Day, I mode a greeting out of two maple leaves and another leaf in the form of a heart. It spelled M❤M.


I passed long sections of the trail full of sassafras. Have you smelled their broken leaves? It is so sweet that I felt I was smelling a kind of flavored honey. The roots of this plant are used for making the root beer. The shape of their leaves looks like cartoon drawing of a dinosaur’s footprint. I also saw more orange newts as I wished yesterday. When the rain got heavier, the newts were trying very hard to walk (run) away from the rain drops to somewhere with cover. It’s hard not to laugh at them when they “run” really hard but couldn’t get going fast! A big drab green toad also jumped under a bush near my foot, quite surprised me. A really big surprise was a grand land turtle, a size of two hands, “standing” right in the middle of the trail, looking directly at me with its head tilted up. As if to say “who are you? Do you have my permission to pass this trail?” I bent down to talk to it. It didn’t bother to move even 1mm. Its shell was very colorful, with bright yellow and orange patterns. I talked to it for a few minutes before moved on, leaving the turtle still guarding its position.


By 5:00 pm I walked into Trent’s Grocery, booked a room for the night. I also got a really tasty strawberry milkshake, the first milkshake since I started the hike.","Helveys Mill Shelter

It was very sad that a fetal attack happened on A.T. on 5/11 night. Our hikers had been talking about how dangerous that person was, and felt very sad that the cops cannot do anything better to prevent this happening. While A.T. is safer statistically, it still cannot immune of crimes. Now everyone is thinking how to stay safer. 



The rain was light today, only a few drizzles and short showers. But the temperature had dropped quite a bit. Even going up hill for 1200ft, I didn’t sweat. There were mud everywhere. Some places were so muddy that you would need a gymnastics balancing skill plus some luck to get through it without have your boots submerged in the mud. It was also a pretty section, lots of creeks, bridges and a peaceful pond along the trail. Mushrooms were everywhere, some were dedicatedly growing on top of very thin branches.
At the end of the day, I was glad to be in Woods Hole hostel - one of the best hostel with legendary history, organic food from its own garden and farm, and got to meet many thru-hikers. Some of them have stayed for multiple days. It was nice to reconnect with hikers, even though I haven’t met any of them before.","Trent’s Grocery

I can see why many people do not want to leave Woods Hole hostel once they checked in there. Last night I met many who stayed multiple days already. It was just too cozy. The bed and beddings were soft and comfortable. The room was warm while I could hear the strong wind blew hard outside. The dinner and breakfast were very delicious, and everyone felt they belong to here. 


So I swallowed hard, and said goodbye to everyone right after breakfast, walked out of the house, and didn’t look back. It was cold all day long. It kept in the high 40s to low 50s, with wind making the trees swing constantly. I had my fleece jacket on all the time. While I walked in the forest, I listened to the talks among trees and rocks. The wind made their conversation more alive and full of energy. I felt as an intruder to their private world, didn’t dare to interrupt them, and didn’t dare to linger long at any location. But I did find interesting patterns in the trees, stones, and plants. A deer also looked at me with alert. I didn’t stop for 9 miles until about 1:00pm when I reached a view point from where I can see some houses down the mountain. And soon after that the view point for Angels Rest. At that location, the town of Pearisburg, VA was in clear view. For the night, I checked into Angels Rest Hostel with a bunk bed after I bought a new pole and send my broken trekking pole back home.","Woods Hole Hostel

Today was one of those perfect hiking days - not too cold, not too hot, breeze and low humidity. In little Godilack’s words: “it is just right.” Even with near 3000ft elevation gains, the trail just passed smoothly under my feet. Yes, some sections were rocky, I just went a little slower on those parts. There was a 12-mile section without water. But since it was cool, I didn’t need much water for the whole day.


For many miles, the vegetation on both sides of the trail were thigh high. If you were not on the trail already, it’d be hard to see it. With many curves, the trail just disappeared into a sea of greens. But once you were on it, it was not hard to follow the brown ribbon naturally. Many wild flowers in the color of pink, white and yellow decorated the trail. The fresh new growth light green are turning deeper to more mature green now. I even saw a few red wild strawberries hidden in their leaves. Summer is approaching.","Angels rest hikers’ haven

I heard people talked about Virginia blues on A.T. before. Basically the long stretch of VA mountains are very long(about 1/4 of the whole trail) and similar (you hike up to a Knob, then following the rocky ridge for some time, then you come down, and then repeat again and again.  Could it be that I have hit the Virginia blue today? The rocky section consumed all my strength and the ability to concentrate. The going was very slow in the morning. So when trail got flatter, I increased my pace. And before I enjoyed this power for long, I tripped on a branch and fell. Then near the end of day, I slipped and fell again 5 minutes before I reached the shelter. Nothing seriously broken, but I can only take shallow breath. Definitely start ibuprofen tonight!


In the mid afternoon, I met a few mothers taking their kids for a hike in the woods. That was very cute. Then at about 5:30 pm, a young man was running towards his parked cars. I still can hike more than 2 hours in the beautiful late evening lights. That’s the benefit of backpacking.","

I fell to sleep 3 times when wrote my blog last night. That’s how tired I was.


When I got ready to hike this morning, the lightening and thunder started. Soon the showers followed, with some intense moments. I waited for about an hour. When it was getting lighter, I walked from shelter into the rain. I welcomed the change in the weather. The rain made the forest much more alive, with greens sparkle and flowers fresher. Of course this rain was the type that makes you smile not scream. 


After about 1.5 hours the rain stopped. I happened to reach an edge of a grassy hill. The views opened up. Green hills floated with white steaming clouds. Nice houses and cows dotted the hills. The light purple grass heads heavy with rain drops and seeds nodded with the breezes. I stopped long enough to make a time lapse video.


Hiking a little further, the grasses had grown to the height of my chest. Blackberry plants were loaded with white flowers. I can feel and smell the summer. 


span class=""Apple-converted-space""> Keffer Oak. I was glade that “Budhi” and “Whity” also reached there at about same time so that we were able to take pictures for each other. I met them in Woods Hole Hostel, and we kept about the same schedule ever since.


Back to the forest and climbed up the Sinking Mountain, the trail got even more interesting. There were many rock caines lineup along the trail for almost a mile. They looked like fallen graves from very early age. Only a couple are still in nice shape. In the silence of the forest, looking at them half buried in the grasses, I was hoping someone can tell me the story of each one of them. Then on the northern section of the mountain crest, the trail went through slanted rocks. I guess that’s how this mountain got the name as Sinking Mountain. On the left side of the trail, it’s rocky cliff, drops a few dozens of feet straight. On the right side, the rocks sliding down to a void of valley far below, only a few short bushes are below the rocks. I was glad that I passed this mountain when it was not raining. This felt like the trail in Castle Rock State Park back at home, the rocky part that passes below Goat Rock. The difference is that this one is about 3.5 miles long vs. 0.5 mile in Castle Rock.

I was planning to reach 4 Pines Hostel by 5 pm for a 17.2 miles hike. In less than 3 hours, I have climbed up the first big up hill of the Brushy Mountain. Just before the intersection of the top, someone stacked many big bottles of Gatorade. Just what I needed! I took one bottle, and quickly finished the first 10 miles by 1pm. And very soon, I hit the 700 miles marker. Yes, today, I completed 700 miles on A.T.!

It was only 2.5 miles from the Tooth to the end of my planned hike for today. However the one mile from the Tooth down was the hardest mile on A.T. so far. Many big rocks, some with bolted hand hold bars as steps to get going, many don’t have anything. I used all fours, on my butts, with trekking poles, threw trekking poles down or over, whatever it felt safe to get down from those rocks! So 3 miles before reach the Tooth + 1 mile got down from the Tooth costed me 4.5 hours. I was so grateful that it was not raining when I was going through there. And the forest provided much needed shades in this very warm day. When I finally reached the Hostel, it’s about 7pm. It was nice that they run shuttles for dinner and resupply market. I was well fed in the Home Place restaurant, a local one famous for home style cooking of southern cuisine. Tasty meal!

I left 4Pines Hostel in early morning after a night of not good sleep due to the noisy fans that stayed on all night. The country was peaceful and quiet. I passed pastures where grasses were chest high. The heads of grasses dropped heavy with the weight of morning dewdrops. When I pushed them apart with my trekking pole, a mist of water, pollen and grass seeds was bursting into the air. It looked really cool. Very soon my pants were soaked with all of these, as wet as going through a rainstorm without rain gear. There were also many wild rose bushes with white flowers sparkling of the dews under sunshine. A few daisies opened big, they were also loaded with dews. Spiders had been very busy in these pastures. Many dry twigs held well constructed webs. They also dew covered. Against sunlight, they looked like sails. Hundreds of sailboats in the sea of grasses, ready to attack and conquer any enemy’s army. When I passed the narrow walkway between the grasses, I had to push many webs away, frequently clean my face for the threads of webs just stick to my face. I felt sorry that I had to destroy spiders’ hard work. 


It was a very warm day. But the trail going to McAfee Knob was very easy comparing to yesterday’s that went to Dragon Tooth. Being a Sunday, I shared about 4 miles of the trail with many day hikers. One couple who’s planning for a thru-hike in next year chatted with me for some time. They just came back from Trail Day, and started to prepare for their trip. It felt great to share some of my experiences with people of the same interest. 


McAfee Knob could be the second most featured images on A.T. (The most featured might be the Northern Terminus sign at Katahdin Mountain). The huge rock felt bigger than I expected. It was so picture perfect shaped! It was a great feeling to stand on it, after more than 713miles walk. I spent almost one hour at this place. 


In late afternoon I came to Tinker Mountain Cliffs. Another great phenomenon on A.T.. About 0.4 miles of the trail hugs the cliffs. Sometimes it’s so close to the edge that even me as a cliff lover wanted to get away from the trail just a little bit to the tree side. At about 6pm, the lovely low lights made the scenery even better. It was very windy. The trees near the cliffs swing swiftly. Making loud “shua, shua” sounds, as if telling a story of their own. Against sunlight, the ridges across a green valley looked like a long wall guarding a great treasure site. A hiker, sitting on top of a large rock at the Cliffs with his girlfriend, told me that they form the Tinker Loop, that can be backpacked in a few days. 


Just below the Tinker Mountain, I encountered 2 bear cubs and a mama bear. My first bear sighting on A.T.. The cubs were scrambling down the two trees when they heard my noise. The mom stayed closer to the cubs. And within one minute, all three disappeared.","4Pines Hostel

My original plan was to do a 20 mile hike plus resupply stop near noontime when crossing road 220. However I must be over spent my energy and felt it was unrealistic to complete these in one day. It was true. My energy level was low and hiking pace has been slowed noticeably in the past 4 days. So I only reached the road after 2pm with less than 10 miles done. I decided to rest for the half day and checked into a hotel. Looking at the next 9 days schedule, I will adjust it to slower pace. Also the weather reports showed temperature above 90s in next week. It will be harder to go fast. 


Today’s best views were on the ridges. One was overlooking Carvins Cove reservoir and another one was overlooking the valley and town below the ridge. Even though there was not hard climbs, on the ridge it was still rocky at many places. I have learned that flat profile can be deceiving. When it’s flat and rocky, the going can be very slow.","Lamberts Meadow shelter

At noontime, I stopped at Curry creek for lunch. A big black butterfly came on to my backpack, checking around the zipper part on the top pocket throughly, as if trying to find out whether the zipper is a good place for her to lay her eggs.It stayed for a long time, enough for me to take a time lapse video.

He stayed in various shelters and built beautiful fire rings, voluntarily! I met him yesterday at Bobblets Gap shelter. The stone work that he did for the fire ring and channel for the spring looked like pieces of art. His 5 days of effort. He also played guitar and sang with a wonderful voice. He will continue go on to other shelters and build fire rings for them.


Natural Bridge Appalachian Trail Club maintains about 90 miles of the trail in this section. I met two volunteers fixing water bars on the trail. They also cut off the downed trees that were blocked the trail. 


Max and all the volunteers who help to make A.T. better are the real heroes here! I cannot thank them enough for their contribution that allowed me to have great experience on the trail.
When I got to Jennings Creek, the shallow water looked so inviting with stones I can sit on. I enjoyed watching people fly fishing in the wide creek and soaked my feet to cool me down.


I have marched on tirelessly today for 16.5 miles. The plan was to do 13.5 and stay in Bryant Ridge shelter. But I got there at 4:30pm, still 4 hours before sunset. And the privy was swarmed with yellow jackets. So I lost my desire to stay and pushed 3 more miles, +1700ft to a small gap before Floyd Mountain to camp there.

It’s been 2 months that I have lived on A.T.. The trail still not bored me yet. Even though the excitement from observing the Spring wonders had subsided, the growth of the Summer has just begun. Many plans I saw emerging fresh and new at the spring time now baring young fruits. Many tender shoots a month ago now formed beautiful flowers. Blueberries, strawberries, mulberries, even wild grapes formed nicely already. Today I saw a few patches of tiny little purple flowers that form a cluster and surrounded by spiky hairs. They looked ugly and forbidden to be touched. But beauty is in the eyes of Lovers. Maybe it was very attractive to some specific  creatures. Nature always assign a purpose to everything.


In the past a few days, many rhododendrons have past their peak blooming time. Many petals dropped to the ground that made the trail colorful and a little sad. But today in James River Face Wilderness, there were still many rhododendron trees at their peak.","Foot of Floyd Mountain

I passed many bridges today. The most impressive one was James River Foot Bridge, built in year 2000 for the memory of Bill Foot, an A.T. thru-hiker in 1987. With his wife, they lobbied tirelessly to have this bridge built. The longest foot bridge on A.T., a very sturdy steel, cement and wood construction for all hikers easily and safely across the wide James River. Next to it is a railroad bridge. I watched a long freight train coming and cross that bridge from the trail. It lasted for almost an half hour!


Having big climbs in a hot day was tough. Having 90% of the big climbs in the afternoon in a hot day was even tougher. That was what I had for today. 18.4 miles to a shelter with over 3500ft elevation gain in the last 9 miles. The shelter name is Punchbowl. I really felt punches in my stomach when I walked up the steep hills in the hot humid afternoon. Thankfully I was mostly under shades and there were some breezes on the ridges. 


I saw two snakes today. The first was one big black snake just crossed trail, with the tip of its tail still brushing the trail. The second was in a creek next to a shelter I passed in late morning. It swam against the current trying to go upstream. The water was a little stronger then its effort. So it was washed down multiple times. Eventually it managed to climb the rocks on the side of the creek, and get to the upstream as it wanted to go. Near the end of the day, a rabbit jumped on the trail. When it noticed I was coming, it hurried into the bushes next to the trail and stayed there frozen. Even when I took its pictures, and walk passed its place, it was still not moving in plain sight. It’s good that I was not in the mode to hunt a rabbit!","Marble Spring campsite

My guide book says Punch bowl shelter is hunted by little Otties ghost - a little boy less than 5 years old disappeared and died in this mountain in 1891 when he was gathering firewood for his school house. I am not sure about the ghost, but it was a heaven for wildlife. Having a pond next to the shelter, last night I heard a concert of birds, bull frogs, and many creatures that I just didn’t know what were they. Near midnight, I heard loud voices of two creatures:”Ho Hoo Ha, Ho Hoo Ha...” for a good 20 minutes. It sounded from very big creatures, maybe like big foot! The concert of birds went well beyond sunset for one or two hours. A few nights ago in another shelter, we had birds talking well into darkness for about two hours. Whity deciphered their words as came from two birds. One was calling:”Great Fire!” The other was asking:”Where?” Over and over again. At the next shelter, there was a bird woke up one hour before sunrise, and started talking. I heard it saying:”I’m sorry!” in apologized voice again and again. Last night the birds, being so many of them talking at the same time, it can hardly make out any meaningful words. While the low vibrating call from bull frogs added additional sound track to balance it out.
When the trail crosses creeks, there are always honeysuckles nearby. Their sweet fragrance filled the air creamy and dreamy. The white and yellow flowers have been used in Chinese medicine for soothing throat. I loved the smell of them.


Talking about creeks, there were a few today. The Brown Mountain Creek was especially nice. Rocks formed many steps along the creek, creating cascades and dipping pools. Hikers soak their tried feet in the cool water so they don’t get over heated in the hot day. 


I was doing a short 11 miles day to get resupplies from town. Also save the big climbing to next morning. The afternoon shower was too short. It didn’t cool down the temperature. Only added more humidity to the air. 


Even though this section of the trail is said the follow Blue Ridge Parkway, the hikers can hardly see the parkway except only a small part of it in the first day. I always felt that I was in the middle of a large forest. The BRP was out of sight and out off mind for the last two days.","Punch bowl shelter

It turned out Buena Vista Motel was not a good choice for me last night. They don’t have laundry. I had to do my laundry 1.5 miles away. All extra walk should have been avoided. One thing I like in this small town was an ice cream shop where they hand make rolled ice creams with many flavors. It was so much fun to see liquid cream turned into ice cream, then rolled up for each customer’s order. 
Being a long weekend, there were many short distance backpackers on the trail. One of them gave me a sucker candy. I gave it to another hiker. On the trail in a warm day, the food I craving most was watermelon. Only real supermarkets have that. Only when a supermarket is easy to reach.


Overall this was a relaxed day. I got the my destination before 5:00pm and got to rest after 7.","Buena Vista Motel

Nothing makes me feel so good than a good night of sleep. It rained in the night but cleared in the morning. So the air was very fresh, full of moisture and oxygen. I slept nicely from 9pm to 6am. Sleeping in my tent in the forest feels much better than in hotels! 


In the morning I was happy and felt very energetic on trail. Singing along with silly songs when the trail was not steep or rocky. This easy going lasted for about 4 hours. One of the nice place I passed today morning was near Spy Rock. There were many blooming rhododendrons in that area, along with nice grassy campsites. On top of Spy Rock, there were nice views and cool winds!


After lunch the trail went straight down for 3200ft in about 4 miles. This slowed me down. But when it bottomed at Tye River, it was a nice resting place with many rocks near the banks of the river. I cooled my hot feet in the cool water. There were many tiny fish in there. Nothing bothered them. Other fellow hikers swam in the river. Later they said it was the best feeling when they dipped into the river.


Well, after the cool down, it’s all hard climb again for another 3100ft. Especially after dinner at the Harper Creek shelter, I continued the hike before sunset. From there to Chimney Rock and half way to the top of Three Ridges, the trail was very rocky and no suitable campsite for more than 3 miles. Finally I reached a place that was good to setup a tent. Just in time to finish that and watch the sunset!

The major climbing was done last evening. So I had an easy start today. Only half mile to the highest point of Three Ridges. In the forest, the most sound one can hear were bird talks. One bird kept saying “children, here.” After a while, another bird disrupted the ‘motherly ‘ call with “Zhi Dao, Zhi Dao! (知道，知道Chinese for I know, I know )” Very impatiently. Quickly I reached the Hanging Rock. It was so nice up there at the top of the big rock, not only saw the view of the low land, but also saw the mountains I had walked through in the past two days. The breeze was strong there, making it more enjoyable in the morning cool air. There was also good cellphone signal strength, so I uploaded photos and edited my trail Journals. I stayed there for almost an hour. When I expected a shorter easier day, I always ended up taking too much time on breaks. As a result, I have not been able to reach my destination before 6pm on almost any day!


At lunch break, I reached Maupin Field shelter. Yes, 4 miles took me 4 hours. That’s how slow I moved this morning. It was the first shelter I saw that has a bear pole. The spring water source didn’t has water from the pipe. So I gathered water from the stream next to it.


In the afternoon, the trail joined BRP twice, and was very rocky in between. The great areas were Cedar Cliffs and Humpback Mountain Cliffs. They provided views and cool breezes.


I also met another big black rat snake today in the middle of the trail. This snake had its head deep inside a big hole in the ground. The rest of its body occupied almost 2 feet of the trail. This time I didn’t bother it. Since its busy working on its meal, I run quickly around it. Phew!


After Humpback mountain I started to look for a campsite. Only after 7pm, almost 2-3 hours I found one. The next shelter was too far, so I was happy that I could rest for the day!","1 mile after Chimney Rock

I was going to Waynesboro today. Only 9 miles of gentle rolling trail to the town. Somehow I woke up extra early when it was just day break at 5:25am. By 7:00 am I was ready for the hike.


After a little less than 2 hours, I reached the Mill Creek and Paul Wolfe shelter next to it. This creek was a very cool place. Big stepping stones run across the wide path, forcing the water goes into interesting patterns. A frog jumped from under my feet when I crossed a rock, surprised me as well as the frog prince. When I bent down to take its pictures, it stayed still as handsome as a prince can be. This place is a photographer’s dream place.
Tonight I am staying in Stanimal’s hostel, a past AT and PCT hiker operating the place. He gave me free shuttle rides from trail head to hostel and to the shops in downtown. Great service and a neat  place to spend the day.","Camping spot just passed Bear Spring

I didn’t know Shenandoah National Park exists until after many years I have been in US, even though the park was established pretty early in 1926! In my last couple of years living in NY state, I was thinking to visit the park but never made the trip. Until now, I am walking through the park.
In the morning, the hostel owner Adam dropped a few of us back to the trail head. Soon, I reached the back country permits box and filled my permit. Attached this to my backpack and off I went. As all things have a good side and a bad side, the establishment of Shenandoah NP created the Yin & Yang as well. For a few hundred families of settlers who had to be relocated from the park, this means the loss of their life style and their memories. For millions of people who came to visit the park, this means recreation and adventure. For many wildlife being protected by the park, this means regain their habitats and their life. With this type of bitter sweet emotion I entered the park - on foot. I was not in a hurry, just walked at a slow pace of about 1.5 miles per hour, following the spine of the park’s Skyline Drive, trying to feel the spirit, or looking for the spirit along the trail. 
At one spot, shortly after I crossed the Skyline Drive and re-entered A.T., a rabbit was at the center of the trail. When it saw me, it run towards me against the norm. In 4 hops, it came almost to my feet while I stood there taking its pictures. Then it realized something was not right. It run away quickly almost to the same spot that I saw it at the beginning. It turned its head back, looking straight in my direction and stayed still in that position for almost 2 minutes. Only when I moved towards it, it jumped away into the bushes.
At one of the gaps, on both sides of Skyline Drive, there were pastures with grasses as high as my shoulder. They swing with the wind, making soft sounds to tell the stories of people who might have planted them long time ago. It did feel strange knowing that all the forest I saw in the park nowadays were planted by the CCC “boys” in early 1930s. One section of the A.T. was changed to a detour - a mile of gravel fire road. It was actually very nice detour for the road was easy to walk and there are many huge trees on the road side. It was also completely shaded. From time to time, honeysuckles gave away their secret location by emitting the sweet smell. A few apple trees have many small green apples already. And lots of wild grapes. Their curly young shoots provided very tasty snack, sour and juicy to make hiking in a warm day easier.","Stanimal’s Hostel

Today’s trail was so easy, the 15 miles just cruising by in about 8 hours including lunch break and many mini water breaks. It hugged Skyline Drive tightly to a point that I have lost count of how many times I crossed the road. 
Near one crossing after Black Rock Summit I saw a big single bear. It could be an adult male based on the size of the bear. It was foraging in the forest edge next to the Skyline Drive. A day hiker walked in front of me pointed out the bear to me. Once the bear noticed it was seen by people, it run away from us, keeping low in the bushes.


Whoever designed or approved the design of the trail signs in Shenandoah National Park should feel very bad of their decision. The characters on the signs are tiny, not much bigger than a ladybug. It’s also punctured on a narrow metal strip that has no contract of color. It positioned below chest level. So to read the signs I had to bend my head below my chest while carrying a heavy pack, put my eyes not far than 3-4 inches from the words to make out what are they. And it has to be in a good lighting situation. Why the park cannot make meaningful signs is a mystery to me.


It’s been couple of weeks without significant rain. The springs and streams have reduced their volume. At noon time when I filled my 23oz water bottle from a spring at Blackrock shelter, it took about 3 minutes. And talking about rain, in this mid afternoon, I heard thunder in the last hour of hike. Just as I reached the Loft Mountain camp store, it rained very hard for a good hour and half. While I was waiting for the rain to stop at the store, 3 SoBos asked me to join them for the night to share a campsite. When the rain stopped, we checked into the campground, and set up our tents in a hurry as the next round of thunderstorm was starting. We stayed in the tent for the rest of the day, hearing thunders and seeing flashes of lightning. Just 5 minutes before Sunset, while there was still raining over our head, the red lights from the Sun on the far west filled the sky from cracks in the boiling clouds. Half of the sky was bright red orange!","Camping after Turk Gap

I left Loft Mountain campground in early morning and took the Frazier Discovery trail instead of A.T. since it was more straightforward to go there from the camp store where I also refilled my water bottle. The morning sunlight was lovely on the trail. After last night extensive rain, everything smelled so fresh again. The rain drops were still hanging on all the leaves, my boots and pants got wet in no time. This detour ended up rejoined the A.T. after a few hundred feet climbing, and made the hiking about a little less than a mile longer. But there were cool rock formations and nice view at the top, so I enjoyed it.


Shortly after lunch at the Simmons Gap, I reached the 900 miles markers. Again there were three of them close to each other. And I used the one made of rocks as the real one. Since each year the distance grows longer. The first one made of small sticks might be more accurate. But rocks made it looked so cool!



>span class=""s1"">

Regarding my Knee boots, after more than 900 miles on trail plus about 150 miles before the trip, it was still in workable condition. Both sides got big cracks on side tops. But the bottom threads are still good. And my feet are still feeling good in them. There had been no blister in many weeks. The only problem is that they are not water proof anymore. So compare to others who used trail runners, I am pretty happy with my boots. Many of them had already bought the third pair of trail runners.","Loft Mountain campground

The trail was zigzagging from backcountry to front country through out Shenandoah National Park as I passed campgrounds and lodge. The front country provided all comforts for human beings: shower, flush toilet, shops to buy snacks and quick foods. The lodge has a restaurant and a tap room for real meals and drinks. So today I felt more like a vacationer than a thru-hiker.The trail was also well maintained and gently graded. Most hikers I knew did more than 20 miles or more. I even walked more than 18 miles without feeling exhausted. Before 4:00pm, the weather turned to windy. It thundered for more than 2 hours, but the rain only came as a few drops. This kept the weather cold in the afternoon. Ask I checked into the lodge, I took a hot shower to get warmed up. Had dinner with a few hiking friends. Went to watch the Sunset, had more soup and desert. Time for the comfy bed in the Big Meadow Lodge.","

With the trails so easy, and miles passed by quickly, I started to questioning the mileage accuracy in my guide book. Of course they are not the same as the posted trail signs in the park. But who can believe those signs anyway? Yesterday, one sign said a place was 1.4 miles ahead. After I walked in that direction for 5 minutes, another sign said the same place was 1.6 miles ahead. It just increased by 0.2 mile! All my steps were wasted!


And the trail really loves the front country. I passed Skyland resort at noon time and had a sit down lunch by a window seat in their big dining room. In the National Parks in CA, backcountry means half mile away from a paved road. Here, it is 50feet away. Today the trail went through a landmark called Pinnacle. I was expecting a needle like rock formation. That’s what I believed based on the pinnacles in California, class 5 rock climbing needles! But this pinnacle was a gradual walking trail to a rounded hill, an easy stroll. On one hand, I was glad the trail is easy and good foods are very accessible here. On the other hand, I was hoping to be more remote, away from traffic sounds.","Big Meadows Lodge

Couple of hours later, while I was walking down from Pass Mountain, focusing my attention to the footing, a big black shadow jumped in front of me. Looking up, there was a juvenile bear just run across the trail less than 20 ft from me. It was big and fluffy, cubby by any means. It must have been well fed! Good job, big Teen! You are on a great start for a successful life!


Another hour passed, following some ruffling sounds from the left of the trail, I saw a yearling bear. Small and skinny. By itself, it run across the trail and hid in the grasses. But it didn’t run away. Just retreated a few steps each time, studying me, watching my movements. This little bear must have a hard time to find food since its so small. I wish you the best. 
By 2pm, I reached Elkhollow Wayside. The country store has grill and the park’s signature blackberry milkshake. So my lunch was a cheese burger, onion rings and the milkshake. Every day is so convenient in this park! 


Near Little Hogback Mountain, there was a sea of ferns on both sides of Skyline Drive. Their leaves waved with breezes, forming dark and light patterns as fans waved away stall air. Large tall trees standing in the fern waves, pillars of mottled gray, pointing into the sky. Some with funny shapes.

Again, deer came to the hut to say good morning just after daylight. While I cruising down from Compton Peak, 3 bears, two adults and one cub run in the forest, trying to put large distance between themselves and the hikers. I can smell cinnamon rolls sweet smell at the location they were running away. Maybe someone cooking at home near there attracted them?
By noontime, I have reached the registration box at the park’s boundary. I put the permit tag back to the box and leaving Shenandoah for good. It’s been an easy week in the park with nice comfortable weather, a little bit on the colder side. I can see the park, being so different from the National parks in the western states, plays a very important role on conservation, restoration, and education in the eastern of US. Not all people can go to the far west to experience the wilderness there. But being so accessible near their home, they can also enjoy outdoors peace and awe.","Gravel Springs Hut

Scott who runs Mountain Home B&B was so nice to our hikers. He got up at 5am to prepare our breakfast which was made to order for each individual person. I loved his tea collection too. Hard to decide which flavor I should take. LOL! He also shuttled us to Front Royal downtown last night for dinner and resupply shopping. Gave a tour of the lovely town. It has a few unique museums, wonderful architecture of historic buildings, and many nice restaurant. Quite charming town, indeed. I was glad to have the opportunity to visit this town.
It rained last night. So the air was pretty wet in the morning. The sunlight put on nice “spot light from heaven” effect when it shone through the water vapor in the forest. It made the forest more special. At every edge of dense forest, honeysuckles always grew nicely, filled the air in seductive fragrance. Many mulberry trees have lots of ripe berries now, from creamy white, to pink, to red, and to purple colors. I snacked on them as I walked along the trail, finger and tongue colored purple. The berries were sweet and juicy - the pleasure of living in the forest in summer. Flaming red strawberries were also decorating the ground covers. But they are not as tasty as the cultivated variety. So they looked great, but not my choice of good eats. Blackberries and gooseberries are not ripe yet. Their fuzzy fruits are quite funny looking now.
Turtles were also out today in force. I saw two, other hikers told me that they saw 4 and 5!
Expecting tougher trail tomorrow on the infamous “Roller Coaster” section, I decided to hike longer, past the Whiskey Hollow shelter to camp somewhere between Sky Meadows State Park and hwy 17. When I got there in late afternoon, I found the sign prohibiting any camping in that area. So I had to push on to the hwy which made the total distance of today’s hike 20.8 miles. At that time, I decided the best option for me was to get a Uber to Bears Den hostel for the night. Then slackpacking from hwy 17 back to Bears Den tomorrow. I was very happy that this plan worked so nicely. Bears Den is so special and beautiful. The volunteers working in there were so nice. For $30 I got a very clean bunkbed, shower, laundry which I didn’t need, a large pizza, a Mountain Dew, a pint of tasty ice cream, a breakfast for tomorrow morning, and a shuttle back to the trail head!

I failed to locate any shuttle taken me back to the trail head where I had finished yesterday. So I decided to slackpacking SoBo for the day, and have my friend picking me up from the road in the evening.
It worked so well. I only carried my drawstring day pack with minimal stuff. It felt so light. Even though the drawstring cut into my shoulders and not very comfortable, I used my  bandana and buff as extra padding, it still allowed me to move quickly. Without the heavy pack, every step felt like walking on the air cushion. I was happily bunching up and down along the trail. When people were talking about the infamous “Roller-Coaster” I just thought “where is it?” and smiled inside of my mind. Another benefit of the doing SoBo was I got the chance to see hi to the friends I have made in the past a few days! Most of them surprised to see me walking in the opposite direction.
A little after noontime, I reached the $1000 miles marker! A nice achievement with so little effort today. It made me so excited and motivated. 
In the mid afternoon, I reached Rod Hollow shelter. Immediately a rabbit came to welcome me. Later two other hikers came. While I sat there chatting with them, a large black rat snake climbed up to the far side of the shelter, checking on the stuff one hiker spread out on the platform. It took a while to convince the snake that it should hide in the grass. When I left the shelter, there was another snake on the trail near the shelter. This place was a magnate for wildlife! Being on a Friday afternoon, many boy scouts also came to the place. Hopefully they share the shelter peacefully with the snakes tonight!My friend made so many tasty dishes for me. I ate a lot!

In mid morning after I stepped on top of a predominant rock with fine views, I knew that I have missed something. Two day hikers asked me and the other two backpackers if we had seen the Virginia/West Virginia state line trail marker? All three of us looked at each other, and answered in unison: NO! I can’t believe that after all these 500 miles, with the eagerness to get out of Virginia, I could miss that sign! We backpackers have been too focused on our footings that we don’t look around, especially when the terrain is tough. And yes, that sign was in the middle of a rocky field called “devil’s race course“.  The other two backpackers continued their way to the north. I run down to hill, found the sign and took proud pictures. Since 5/3 when I entered Virginia just before Damascus, it’s been more than a month, on 541 miles in this state. I think I indeed got some Virginia blue when I encountered PUD - pointless ups and downs, on at lease one hot and humid afternoon. But overall, I enjoyed the trails in Virginia. Now, the classic country song of John Denver’s “Country Roads take me home” filled in my mind.
The rain finally started in the early afternoon. By evening it was in a steady state. There were pockets of fogs in the forest, reminded me of the cold earlier times in the spring. The forest became magical again. The sound of rain and wind, accompanying my walking rhythm of footsteps and hiking poles hit the ground, was quite calming. It also gave me expectation of reaching Harper Ferry very soon. Before 8:00pm, I had emerged from the forest and taking in the mighty views of Shenandoah River on the bridge.

Before I could sing a full verse of “Country road, take me home. To the place I belong ...”, West Virginia was gone! Just like that! And I entered Maryland for more than 10 miles already. 
I stayed in Harpers Ferry for the whole morning, doing chores: got a new iPhone charging cable to replace the broken one, mailed unneeded stuff and souvenirs from Shenandoah NP back home, dried my boots and socks before resumed the hike. I also visited ATC office to register. They took my photo. I wrote my information and signed photo release. 
Back on trail, I enjoyed the view of Jefferson Rock, the historical downtown, and the views of Potomac River. The downtown was very charming with many shops, restaurants and museums. I can see it is a place that can easily consume a whole day there.
By crossing the foot bridge on Potomac River, I have left West Virginia behind. A.T. then runs flat along the river for about 3 miles, sharing a nice bike trail. A small creek goes in parallel with the river. It was filled with duckweed and decaying branches. The whole creek was bright green. Many turtles were in there, camouflaged with duckweed, staying perfectly still. A few little ducklings wandered around in the water. Here or there, bright red orange day lilies stood out on the bank. Large tall trees covered with leafy vines lined up the trail. Mosquitoes swarmed in as soon as I stopped to take photos. A lovely wildlife habitat in a peaceful setting. Only a passing train occasionally broke the silence.
Up to the hill, it’s as flat as a trail can be again along the ridge line. In the middle of civilized world not far below, I found a nice camping site. The sun had set, darkness filled the hill. A soft rain started to sing lullabies for the night.","Harpers Ferry

I walked through the area of battle ground in the civil war era over 100 years ago - battle of South Mountain. The battle was intense. Many casualties on both sides. Generals lost their lives together with soldiers. At the end, the Union took control of this area. At Fox Gap, the gravels of General Reno and General Garland marked that historical battle field. I stopped there for my lunch break, drying my tent at the same time. Across the small road from the graves, a black and two white hikers (2 young thru-hikers and one 18 years old section hiker) enjoyed each other’s accompany, music from their ukulele flew in the breezy air, their chatters and laughters reach my ears from time to time. All of a sudden I realized that without General Reno’s sacrifice long time ago, it may not be possible for these young men’s enjoyments and brotherly good time together today. That was a very moving moment for me to remember.


In the afternoon I entered Washington Monument State Park. The first Washington monument built. Along the walkway to the monument, wooden signs listed the timeline of his great achievements. The monument is under construction. So I couldn’t go up to have the view. But it was still a reminder of the greatness of our first president.

Last night I got lazy and didn’t prepare water. After breakfast, I had only 3oz of water left. Fortunately, the clear stream just a very short distance on the other side of the trail across the campsite. After I got water, I was cruising through Maryland. The weather was cool, the trail was pretty easy.
In 5 miles I reached a shelter and had an early lunch break there. Another lady was there too. “3rd Time” is from Australia, doing the A.T. for a third time. She had done A.T. they-hike two times, and half of PCT in the past 9 years! It’s so inspirational after I learned that she’s in her early 70s!

Around 5:00 pm, I reached the Pen Mar state park picnic area. It’s a huge area with excellent views of the flat land below. Built-in picnic tables and park benches are plenty. Many of them facing the valley below to take full advantage of the nice views. I took one table, cooked and ate my dinner in the park, bathed under warm late afternoon sun, enjoyed the view. It was a rare luxury to have a table for cooking and a bench to sit and eat while enjoying the views. To make it better, I can wash my pot in the restroom with running water after the meal. No need to drink the dishwasher water. 
By evening time, the State of Maryland was in my hiking history! Mason-Dixon Line was crossed. Goodbye Maryland, here I come, Pennsylvania. I have completed 6 of the 14 states!","Pogo mountain camp site

It rained pretty hard last night through the morning. I was lying in my tent, listening to the rain symphony and calculating when to get up. Thanks to my umbrella, I was able to get some chores done before the rain stopped at 7. By 7:30am I was ready to hit the trail. 
Between 2-4pm, there were a few breaks from the rain. In those delightful moments, I was near Buzzard Peak, far from any road crossing. In the absence of rainfall and wind, the forest was in complete quietness for brief moments. I slowed down to absorb those rare enjoyment. I hold my breath, or say something in whispering voices. The rain pool stood still, too. I didn’t even want my trekking pole to touch the water, for it would break the perfect reflection of the trees. Then all of a sudden, the rain would drop in a forceful way, shattered everything in peace. Then it would stop as abruptly as it started, brought the complete quietness again. Intermittently, the sunshine would break through the clouds and penetrate the canopy, painted the underbrush patchy golden. Those two hours brought me so much joy. 
By 4:00pm, it was serious thunderstorm. The forest was as dark as 30min after sunset. Thunders kept rolling in. Shower was heavy. The wind was strong and cold. Fortunately the lightenings were not too bad. But the trail decided to be challenging at that time. Many big rocks to negotiate. Throughout today, I had to focus on my footing, trying to avoid the wet slippery roots and muddy pools. So I was tired by then. The good thing was the rocky sections were not too long. When I reached the busy road PA30, the sun came out again and stayed clear for the night. 
I checked into a church owned hostel, stayed clean, dry. For dinner I ordered pasta and salad delivered to the hostel. Looking at the food, I realized how big the portion was. Almost 3 times as my dinner on trail. No wonder I have lost weight! It took me some effort to finish the meal. So stuffed.","Falls Creek Campsite

Today was one of the memorable day on my A.T. journey. I have been anticipating this in the last a few days. At around 3pm, I passed the midpoint of A.T.! There was a post for year 2018 midpoint, and there was a stone marked 1/2 sign about half mile later on the ground. There should be another halfway sign based on year 2011 mileage. I will pass that tomorrow early morning! So officially I have completed more than half of the hike!


Midway point is worth celebrating,
Midway point is worth mentioning,
It took a long time to get here,
And every step from here is one less step to reach my destination.
No hurry, no worry, just live one day at a time, and I will be there!


Today’s trail celebrated with me with super easy terrain. Almost no rocky section. At one stretch of the trail when it passed pine forest, the path was covered with cinnamon colored pine needles. Soft, spongy, and very comfortable for my feet. I bet the quality of this pine needles carpet is comparable with the red carpet fit for a king or queen’s state visit. While I was walking on this long carpet, the birds sang welcome songs for me. And the wind blowing leaves clapped welcome chatting, too. I felt proud and happy to receive this honor.


Earlier in the morning, three sightings worth my blog mentioning. One was a green tunnel of rhododendron-ish trees. Wooden and stone steps led me through the tunnel climbing up. It felt like going up a stage to receive a medal. The second scenery was the full blossom of mountain laurels. Their pink and white flowers filled the sides of the trail. Brightened the trail as well as hikers spirit. The third one was the beautiful Quarry Gap shelter. It was not just well constructed and maintained shelter. It was best decorated shelter, too. Fresh flowers in hanging baskets and pots made the shelter more like someone‘s well loved and cared for front yard. Overall all shelters in PA are in much better shape than those in other states I have walked through. The PATC really have done a great job. 


A few humble sticks made 1100 mile marker. It was also passed on the trail today. I felt very energetic and ready to face the challenges of the second half of my journey!","Trail of Hope Hostel

Not far from the last night shelter, I saw the year 2011 half way post. It was more artistic and much bigger than the year 2018 post. It’s a little bit strange to see the post sign says 1090.5 miles to both sides while I was actually already at mile 1100.5. Still it is something I was very glad to see.
I reached Appalachian Trail Museum in Pine Grove Furnace State Park by 9:40am. The museum has cool displays for A.T.. the one I loved most was the old sign at Katahdin Mountain and the book by Earl V. Shaffer - walking through Spring - his experience as the first thru-hiker on A.T.. At the nearby store, some thru-hikers were doing the half gallon ice cream challenge. It was a silly way to celebrate midpoint! But apparently some people can do it. I later met “Whity”,  who actually completed the half gallon ice cream in this cold day! He got a tiny wooden spoon as an award for finish one large box and one small box of ice cream! 
My cousin and her husband came over to the park to meet me today. She brought lots of yummy home cooked food. It’s a great treat at the halfway point. All of my favorite Chinese food and watermelon! We shared it with other young hikers: “City” and “Go Cool”. Today “City” carried two red heart shaped balloons. He bought them for his father. They will meet tomorrow on the Farther’s Day. His dad will throw a trail magic for him and hikers. How sweet this is!
After we finished the meal, and I packed all the goodies my cousin brought to me, we hiked together for about a mile. They got a baby taste on what the trail and backpacking are about. I was happy to have their accompany. We walked by the lake, beautiful creek, and a small swamp area. We also climbed a little bit up through downed trees. The forest was peaceful and enjoyable. 
After I said goodby to my cousin and her husband, I continued for another 3 and half hours to reach the James Fry shelter. It was still early for the day. But being over stuffed with food, I was sleepy. So I settled in my tent for the night. As a day hiker passed me today said that he will pray for his god to bring me good luck and protect me, I felt very blessed by my family and the caring of fellow hikers today.","Toms Run Shelter

I had lots of “fun” on today’s trail. In the morning it started as easy going. The cellphone signal has been great. So even I planed  to do more than 20 miles today, I was still very relaxed and had a long video call with my sister and parents. Then I reached the Rocky Ridge. It is true to the name. I called it rocky ridge, rocky maze! At least on two locations I had to remove my backpack and camera, put my hiking poles aside to pull myself up or get down on the trail. It’s only with the help of those white blazes that I could find my way out of the maze. Sometimes I still need to stop  for a moment, looked carefully around, then made sense out of the code by white blaze. So this was the real fun part of the day.



The reason that I had to make it a 20 miler was because in the last 10 miles, the A.T. goes through farmlands and highways. There was no good camping option. So I had to make it to a hotel. By the time I left the small town of Boiling Springs, the rain started. There was still 8.5 miles to the hotel. The rain came in full force. In just 5 minutes, my pants and boots were soaked. The trail became a small muddy river. The previous muddy sections became various sized mud pools. At multiple pools there was no way to go around them. So I had no choice but waled right into the ankle deep muddy pools. This reminded me of my child time. During summer, Beijing usually had late afternoon showers every day. One of my favorite play was to wear a pair of plastic sandals and splashed around in the rain pools, of course, without being seen by my parents. So to make the best out of the muddy situation, I sang silly songs about my favorite activity in the past. I just slipped and slid through the trail for about 4 hours. This made the 20 miler day much longer than I anticipated.
The last “fun” was in my last mile of hike. An old guy appeared abruptly in front of me. He carried an old gray backpack which looked as if made out of canvas. He’s tall, has long white hair and long white beard. He has a long eagle beak nose. Something about his skin color made me wonder if he’s a real person. The skin looked like porcelain. He spoke to me in a rather fast tune that made me hard to understood fully. He asked me about camping situation in the next many miles before the shelter, which was not good. Then he asked me if I came from far away, and if I will stay in super 8 motel tonight. He had met three other hikers who all will stay in Super 8. Since it’s been late, he sensed that I wanted to reach the motel as soon as possible, he let me go. I could tell that he wanted to ask a lot more questions. I also wanted to ask him where would he stay tonight since there is no good camping option for more than 10 miles and the nearest town to find a hotel in his direction would be 7 miles away. But in a hurry, I didn’t chat more with him. After I parted with him, I kept thinking that I might missed the opportunity with knowing a true forest wizard. As a punishment, in the last half mile in the woods, I walked right into mosquitos kingdom. In 30 minutes, mosquitoes swarmed around me. My hands and caps danced violently around my face, neck, shoulder, back and arms, trying to slap them away. When I finally reach the highway that led to the Super 8 motel, I had bitten for more than 20 times by those hungry mosquitoes!
Such a “fun” hike in the Father‘s Day. I did see many fathers and kids hiking together today. So happy Father’s Day!","James Fry shelter

Passing through the valley, I see the fields. Gold is the mature wheats, green the young corns. Mixed brown is the hay feeding the cows, I also hear a rooster calls.
Passing through the valley, I’m wondering what the life’s about. Is the work hard on your body, but good for your soul? You got it in your blood, you got it in your family. For more than two hundred years, you must have it in your heart.
Passing through the valley, I’m trying to figure it out. What’s it like working for no one but yourself, what does it feel listening to no call but that of the Nature God? How’s the outside world changes what you do, for better or worse on the land you own? 
Passing through the valley, I’m thinking of the future. Do your children help you when they finish school work? How do they value this land vs. their video games? Will they stay or eager to leave, the land in your family that’ll pass to them?
Passing through the valley, the grasses are tall. Purple, pink, yellow and white, flowers mix-in all. My fingers’re sliding through the leaves, touching the time of gone-by. Lives are so different, yours and mine. I’ve not met you, or may not ever know you. But when I’m passing through the valley, interacted we have.

It was hard to decide where to go for today. So my plan kept changing. That’s the life on trail when one needs to consider weather, distance, resupply needs and own ability to walk for the day. It’s also depends on if there is a decent place to stay for the night. So as I hiked down to Duncannon, I first decided to stay in town. Then I heard bad reviews on the hotels, so I thought maybe I would go to next shelter. Then at a gas station near the town, a lady told me and other two hikers there is a church that opens its basement to thru-hikers. That place has very good reputation. So the plan changed again. I stayed in the town in the basement of the church, on the floor with other 6 hikers. I also got my resupplies for the next 6 days, had my lunch with a sandwich and watermelon! Later in the town, I did a walk tour to see the historical buildings and ate a cup of ice cream. Duncannon is a town that needs some TLC. It’s bordered by a beautiful river with mountain views. But many businesses are closed, there is no one hotel has a decent reputation. 
On the trail earlier today, I was awakened by the heavy rain in early morning a little after 3am. Then I hiked through the rain and fog for about 2.5 hours to get to town. The trail down from the mountain was steep but with nice steps built with rocks. The foggy forest is always my favorite forest, even in wet socks and boots.","Cove Mountain shelter

The road is rocky,The road is curvy,But if you just follow the white blazes,
You will get to your places.
Be it a town to get your resupplies,
Be it a camp to rest an aching body,
Be it a shelter for protection from the weather,
Or a place for meeting your friends.


Just follow the white one, 
Follow the white blazes.
Away from busy highway,
Away from noisy world.
It will bring you to a world of wonder,
It will guide you in a world of your dream.
You may not know anyone on the trail,
But they all have the same dream as you.
You may become good friends,
You may become soulmates,
You will truly find yourself,
When you just follow the white blazes.


For most of the day, it said chances of rain. But the rain didn’t come till evening after I had find a place to camp. All of the hikers pushed beyond the Peter Mountain shelter today. We were expecting intense thunderstorm/hail/high wind tomorrow afternoon. Since the shelter for tomorrow is 18.3 miles after Peter Mountain, we wanted to hike a lot more today to shorten tomorrow’s distance. At the end, I stopped at a ridge campsite that will be 15 miles from the next shelter. So tomorrow will be an early start for me. 


Last night a SoBo told us the trail condition for today is very bad. But I found he was making extravagant claims. There were a small section that was rocky. And I did use my all fours to get through that one. But it was very short. Most part of the trail were reasonably easy to walk on and keep a balance. I hope tomorrow’s trail doesn’t get worse.","Basement in Assembly of God, Duncannon, PA

This was the earliest day that I started hiking. By 6:20am I was on trail. Last night campsite was very nice, flat, dry, all by myself. It rained in the night. So when I woke up before dawn, I saw many large spiders hidden beneath my tent rain fly, to keep them dry. There was a chasing game between me and the spiders before I dare to unzip the tent. I had heard from at least two hikers that they got very sick after a spider bitten them, and had to got off trail for a week. I don’t want that happen to me.
Due to the rain, the forest was foggy for the all time until later of the day. Getting off Peters Mountain was pretty fast and easy. But when I started on Stony Mountain, the trail became very muddy. At first, I could still walk on the sides of the trail to avoid mud and water. But just after I finished lunch, the promised heavy shower arrived. For an hour, it’s poured buckets of water from the sky. And the trail became a river. At many places, there were no where to walk except go through right into the mud or water. Even when the rain stopped, the river trail didn’t change. At many places, I walked through ankle deep water or mud. It remained this way till I reached the side trail to Rausch Gap shelter. I think this mountain should be named water mountain, instead of stony mountain. Later when I read other thru-hikers notes in the shelter’s registry, I saw the river trail was there even before we had rain today. It could be this Trail’s normal condition. Well, my boots would not be dry over night since the humidity is so high here. So it’s ok to hike in river again tomorrow!","3 miles after Peter Mountain

I wish I was a giant frog for the last two days. It would be so much easier for a frog to hop through the water pools and mud pools on the trail. It rained through the night and morning. When I left the shelter at 7:30am, the rain was still going strong. As of yesterday, the trail was still full of water. The Rausch Creek along the trail was roaring. When I crossed the bridge over the creek, I could see the water was a brown torrent with white foams cascading down the creek loudly. Very soon, I reached a junction with a plaque “Beaver dam ahead“. Another sign next to it pointed out the direction for an alternative dry route. I decided to take the beaver dam route since I like to see the dam. Also, if the water was high at the beaver dam, I could always turn around. On the way to there, a tall guy with a very light backpack run very fast and past me. Before I could ask him if he can wait for me at the dam in case the water is high, he’s already charged far ahead. I was thinking that he might be trying to break the AT thru-hiking record! After about a half mile from the sign, I reached the beaver dam. I was just in time to see the runner past the long water trail at the dam. The water level looked ok. So I carefully folded the water, placing my feet on the branches in the water as much as possible, and always tested the depth of the water with my trekking poles before place my feet on the spots. The water at its deepest part was above my ankle. This was a huge beaver dam. I can tell it took generations of a beaver family to build and maintain this dam. In the rain and under dark sky, everything looked black and white, except a few patches of green leaves. The water looked as black as ink. Just after I crossed the dam section, a family of five with three kids came behind me. They were section hike the trail, not sure for how many days. The youngest boy was the most energetic one. In early morning, saw him carried 5 empty bottles from their campsite to get water from the shelter 0.3 miles away. He was the one running through the water trail in front of the family. It took me almost 20 minutes to cross the dam carefully. It took him less 5 minutes to run through the same section!
A couple of hours after I passed the dam area, the rain stopped and the sun came out. I entered Swatara state park. Just when I thought the trail condition improved in the state park, it led me to a small creek with brown roaring water and no bridge. There was a log over the creek at a dangerous sloping angle. Between the bank of the creek and the log, someone placed a 2x4 wooden board about 10 feet long to close the gap. If it was dry and I could see the bottom of the creek, I might consider cross it. But the 2x4 was still wet and the log still held paddle of water. So I didn’t want to take this risk. I turned around, hiked an additional 1 mile back to the road, then followed the road to the next section of the A.T.. This put my total distance of today to 19.2 miles. 
For the rest of the day, the trail was either boring with overgrown plants and muddy pockets, or it was rocky, with big and small rocks that always got your trekking pole stuck or made you no good place to put down your feet. But at the end after 7:20pm, I finally pulled into 501 shelter. When the night fall, I came out from the sleeping building, fireflies were everywhere in the air. They were dancing around between the trees, above the grasses, and around you. It’s been so long since last time I saw fireflies by this large number! I stood there in the darkness, my eyes followed one firefly, then another, then another, round and round, I felt as if I was dancing with them, dancing with many spirits!","Rausch Gap shelter

Wow, I just realized that I have been on A.T. for 90 days today. It felt like I am calling the forest my home. Also I passed 1200 miles marker this morning! From today, the remaining distance to Katahdin is less than 4 digits! According to my guide book based on 2018 mileage, I have 981 miles to go!That’s all the excitement for today. The rest was pretty boring. The trail was either mud or rocks. Uninteresting mud and uninteresting rocks. Both made me walking as a drunken person. Thank god there was no traffic police patrol the trail, or they might send me to an alcoholic treatment center. There was a pretty pond formed by a very small man made dam. After I went to see the pond, I missed the turning sign of A.T. and got to a road. This detour cost me about 0.6 miles extra on the rocky trail. Every thru-hike said they want to get out of PA as fast as possible. Same here with me. I never feel so bored by the trail as today’s. Can’t wait to meet my friend tomorrow for some change. May be I will feel better when I come back to take on the next challenging week.","501 shelter

It was a very pleasant day today. There was finally some break from the rain, the muddy and rocky trails. At lease for a few miles. The temperature was also great for hiking. When I was in 501 shelter, the caretaker warned us about the steep and rocky trail on the last half mile to Port Clinton. I found it was not too bad. Even though it was steep, for most part it was well constructed with rock steps. So footing was great. Just when I got to the railroad crossing in Port Clinton, there were a family doing trail magic, with hot dogs, hamburgers and shrimp pasta, plus many drinks. Since I left Tennessee, this was the first real trail magic I got. For this family, the two sons are doing A.T. thru-hike. The parents drove from their home in NY to support the boys. So sweet! 
After I enjoyed the lunch with them and five other hikers, I met my high school classmate/friend in the peanut shop down the street. She brought me the new boots that my son sent to her earlier. So going to the next rocky section I will be more confident on the footing. After we did resupplies and back to hotel, I said the last farewell to my old faithful boots, put them RIP in the trash can.

What a wonderful day today. My high school classmate accompanied me for a slackpacking. We had great time to hike the Pulpit Rock and the Pinnacle overlooks by Appalachian Trail. The hike was a lot more easier through the rocky trail sections when I didn’t have my heavy pack. The views on both rocks were great. I especially loved that on the Pinnacle for there was a great bird of prey (can’t tell exactly what was it) circling around the tree tops just below the rocks. Earlier in the day, a hiker showed us pictures of venomous snakes hidden in the rocks near these areas. But I looked carefully and didn’t see any. 
We had lunch break on Pinnacle rocks. Since we only carried one lunch, we pampered ourselves with lots of fruits and small tomatoes, Hong Kong pastries, fresh cheese, and many other treats. One of the most delicious lunch I have had on the trail!

There was rain at night and early morning. So when I started at 7:30am the trail was very wet. The dirt part was muddy with gathered water, rocks were slippery. Then by 9am, the rain stopped. The Sun cracked open clouds, pushed away fog gradually, played hide and seek for a long time till afternoon, and remained sunny for the rest of the day.
For most part of the day, the trail was not difficult at all. Some sections were on old fire road and were very easy. Then it came to the Knife Edge Cliffs. All rocks decided to come alive. They stood up, pointing their sharp sides towards the sky. They were competing like plants to get more sunlights, one on top of another, like the young shoots push out of the soil and dead leaves at spring time. Nothing can stop them. The trail is put through these live rocks with both sides drop down vertically, therefore, forming the ‘Cliffs’. It lasted about half mile. I went very slowly and carefully, most of the times, found my trekking poles were rather in the way. It was better going through this with my all fours. Sometimes, butt was much trustworthy than feet. And that was how it was done. Once this section was passed, I cruised to Bale Oven Knob road, found a lovely trail magic waiting for me! For many young hikers passed me on the trail, they got to the road earlier, and told the trail angels that I was coming.
The trail Angels were “Mountain Goat” and “Chopper” families. The two brothers thru-hiked A.T. in 2016. They drove 8 hours from Virginia to do two days of trail magic. Immediately I got a place to charge my phone, served hamburger, a cold drink and potato salad. Later, sitting comfortably in a chair with my shoes off, listening to the brothers’ and other hikers’ stories, I was giving more fruits. Before that moment, I was so tired that I was thinking to find a tenting spot near the road for the night. But I was rested well, and encouraged by the experienced thru-hiker brothers to walk one more mile to Bale Oven Knob shelter - one of the original built in 1937. That one mile also had a big rocks section similar to earlier one, only a little bit easier. Not just myself wished to have longer legs today. But I made through them safely. I was so tired after 17.5 miles for the day. I fall to sleep before finishing two sentences. The rest of the journal was done in the morning at 5am.","Eckville shelter

In my plan before came to A.T., I saw there is little elevation for this section, and put 23.4 miles as the expected distance of my travel today. Then there were enough warnings from my fellow hikers for the big rocks near here. My plan changed to split the 23.4 into two days, each about 12 miles. With the shortened distance, I started a little late than normal. I hit the trail 10 minutes after 8am. 

There were some rocky sections than I passed slowly. They were not as bad as yesterday’s knifes edge. The big challenge was lying ahead at Lehigh Gap. It was said the worst before the Whites in New Hampshire. People warned me that I need to team up with others to get through this. Lucky, when I rested in a shelter, a ridge runner came. He told me that there is an alternative route that is being used as an alternative route for A.T. In winter! I was so relieved to hear that and immediately decided to take the. Winter trail.
Since The trail was running through the previous zinc mine, the water was contaminated that it Should not be used unless it is an emergency. So in order for having enough water for a dry camping I loaded up with more than 3 liters. My bag became very heavy. It must be over 35lbs. As was walking down the rock filled trail, think about how to find this alternative route, I didn’t pay enough attention to my footing. The last minute I realized, I was flying into the air. My knees hit some thing, my cheek kissed a rock,with a bang！And I was lying on the trail! Fortunately I checked carefully and no bone was broken! 
Earlier my new hiking pole was also giving me trouble. The lower section became too loose to connect with the rest of the pole. So with these two incidents, I was in no condition to hike the Rocky ridge. 

The alternative route was not bad at all. Except the afternoon was very hot, so the going was slow. After it went around the rocky section, it merged with A.T. . I got a good opportunity to try many blueberries. Along a fire road that goes on forever. Finally the humid weather turned into an evening thunderstorm shower.

Even though it was humid and hot today, the trail was almost flat. Small rocky sections, but mostly very manageable. 
Shortly after I left the camp area, I found more blueberries along the trail. I grabbed handful of them, their sweet juice made my complete breakfast. A few miles later, a day hiker Shara came from behind. She asked my trail name, told me that “Anchor” a fellow thru-hiker who dose slackpacking with “A Quest”, mentioned to her that I had a bad day yesterday. So Shara wanted to give me home baked chocolate chips cookie, raspberries and cherry tomatoes. What a trail angel! The raspberries were so sweet and juicy. Cookie was delicious! I saved tomatoes for lunch. Thanks a lot, Shara! I wish you could fulfill your thru-hiking dream soon.

The most issue in this section was water. Springs were a far from each other, and always far from A.T. down steep side trails. So I carried enough water yesterday for today, till I can reach the shelter 11 miles away. I got there at 3pm, with only 3oz of water left. The spring near the shelter was also dried up. It was a 10 minutes hike to get to the available spring. The water from the spring was cool and sweet. Really nice to quench my thirst. From the shelter, it would be another 13 miles to go for the next water source. So I loaded up again, enough for cooking dinner, brush teeth tonight, plus the demands of tomorrow. I hiked 3 more miles after ate dinner in the shelter before settling down in a campsite with nice views.Sweet dreams.","Near Little Gap

Everybody wanted to get out of Pennsylvania as soon as possible! No matter how it was planned, everyone said they’d push miles today to get to Delaware Water Gap. It felt like this little town has the magic power to stop Pennsylvania rocks spilling over to New Jersey side. 
I pushed too. For additional two reasons: both of my phone and battery power bank were dangerously low on power. In this modern world, even we are in the wilderness we still relies on the information on our digital devices. It’s a shame, but it is how does it work today. The second reason was that I want to find a place where I can have long noodles for dinner. It was my father’s 95th birthday. Even though I cannot go back to Beijing, I still want to follow the Chinese tradition to eat long noodles on loved one’s birthday. So I hiked a little over 18 miles in a hot day to reach the town. 6.5 more miles than I planned.

The first 6 miles on today’s trail was rocky and rocky. I needed to watch every step to place my foot in the right spot. A couple of young man hopped and jumped run passed me. I didn’t know how they were possibly done that without falling or twisting their ankles. I knew one of the guy was a hokey player and a marine. Maybe his training made him very capable of this!After the foot rolling rocks, came the bigger rock pile of wolf rock. Compare with others we had passed in the last two days, this rock was much easy to pass, though it still needs focusing, puzzle solving and balancing skills. The trail gave me a break after the wolf rock with a mile of fire road. Followed by more rocky sections. In the last 6 miles before the town, it was pretty nice. In one section the trail was a pathway between rhododendron blossoms. Not sure why these bloom later than the ones I saw in Tennessee and Virginia. But they were sure very pretty. It was as if PA was trying to leave us some nicer/calming impression before we finish. Thanks for the beautiful flowers, but, no, thanks PA, I would not miss your mean rocks and sucking mud!
By 7:30pm, I rolled into the town, has a Japanese ramen dinner, showered and stayed in the hikers center of Church of Mountain. Tomorrow I will cross the state line. The locals already set July 4 celebration in full swing. Fireworks mixes with the sound of traffic, and the dances of fire flies.","A mile from Wind Gap

This was a sweet and short hiking day today. I only walked 1.2 flat miles to meet my friend from elementary school. So I got a late start, had breakfast with a slice of apple pie, a fresh lobster roll, and milk in the country bakery before I packed anything.
It was a founders ‘s day, a day for celebration. In this small town, it had a classic car show and craft show. I walked through those and passed the Downtown to The bridge. In the middle of the bridge it laid the sign of the state line! I was officially completed Pennsylvania and started to go into New Jersey! I was so glad to leave the big rocks and muds behind in Pennsylvania!

My friend picked me up from the closed Kittatinny visitor center. She took me to Edison for an afternoon of relaxed spa and Asian food experience, did resupplies shopping, then met another elementary school classmate for dinner! What a nice zero day!","Delaware Water Gap

Ah, sweet New Jersey! That’s all thru-hikers say when they are done with PA and resumed hikes in New Jersey. The trail did get better and less rockier in the first full day of my NJ hike. There were also more interesting scenes along the way. It started alone a bank of a creek, as soon as I enter the forest, it felt as least 15 degrees cooler. When the trail went higher, the shade was given away to hill tops with open views and blue berry bushes. Most of the berries are not ripe yet. But there are some tasty ones for me.
I started late from my friend’s home after passed 10am. We reached the trail head at above 12:20. With about 9 miles of hike, I got an easy day. Halfway through the hike I reached the Sunfish ponds - the first glacially formed pond on A.T. from the south. Piles of rocks formed its lake side trail, picturesque but hard to pass. On the hill, the Delaware River curved a slanted S on left hand side. A dam formed a lake and a few irrigation pond on the right hand side. The wind blew loudly, making unwanted bugs staying away from my face. Even though it was still rocky at some points, it was more manageable to go through. By evening time, I have checked into AMC Mohican outdoor center, where many families with children can rent houses for their lake front vacations. With a hot shower, I was ready to go sleep.","Friend ‘s house

This was the first day of the second half of the year. It started out pretty cool. I worn polar fleece jacket in the morning. Only after climbing up a hill when I needed to remove it.
I reached the catfish fire tower in about 1.5 hours. On top of the tower, the views were wonderful, as well as the cool breeze. I got refreshed up there by the wind.
A couple of hours later, a neon green sign at the trail head of a road crossing announced a trail magic up front. On the other side of the road when A.T. crosses it again, 3 ladies set up tables, chairs and a grill. I was directed to sit down, then they Gave me first class services: grilled a cheeseburger, filled a glass of orange juice, handed me a plate with fresh berries and a piece of pound cake. I was also served with deviled egg and potato chips. The hunterton hiking club has been doing the trail magic for 20 years. I was their first hiker for today. Thanks so much for the treat. I had my lunch really early today with all the food they served. I didn’t feel hungry for the full day.
Shortly after I left the trail magic place, a water lilies chocked pond came into my sight. Frogs made lots of calls in here. Salamanders darted in the water too. The pond was calm, the reflections formed still painting. Further up the trail, some fall colors have started to show off in the fallen leaves. Added warmth to the green forest. Suddenly a family of wild turkeys came near me, mother with 4 chicks. The mother stayed cool while I videotaped them, no running around in panic. The trail also climbed up a rocky ledge with big steps that I needed to use my hands pulling me up. It reconnected to a fire road very shortly. I was wondering if this was a fun way to just show a little challenge of A.T.. Up on the open ridge, there were so many blueberry plants. Most of the berries were not ripe yet. But I still can get two handfuls of sweet berries easily. 
By the time I reached Blink shelter, I decided to stay for the night. The bear box and privy are too convenient to leave behind.","AMC Mohican center

100 days has significant meaning in Chinese culture. For a new born baby, once he/she survived the first 100 days, the likelihood of the child to grow up to adulthood increased tremendously. Therefore there is always a big celebration for a baby to be 100 days old. For me being on the A.T. for 100 days means that I am thriving in the forest. It had been my home and my spiritual garden for the 100 days. It could be simple, humble, beautiful, and sometimes even hostile. But I loved it for the past 100 days. And I will continue to love it for the coming whatever number of days.


To expecting a long day of hiking today, I started very early. By 6:30am I had left the shelter. It was always peaceful and beautiful in a sunny morning when the air was cool, the sunlights were low and golden soft. Very soon I came upon a view point with big rocks and a large shiny lake below. It’s Culvers Lake. It’s water surface reflected the sunlight like a steel board. Shortly after, I came across a fire tower with a picnic table on a side of a cliff, great view point for taking a break there. By noontime, I reached the Sunrise Mountain pavilion. A family was doing trail magic there, with cold drinks, cookies, crackers and bananas. I stopped to enjoy the goodies and a comfortable chair to rest my tired body. There was still 10.6 miles to go. The blackberries on Sunrise Mountain were very ripe now. I picked handful of the sweet berries. Down from the Sunrise Mountain, another trail angel loaded 5 large bottles of drinking water at a shelter. He does this once every 4 days. The water source near that shelter was rather staggering water, not good for hikers.
In the afternoon, the trail entered High Point State Park. For a few hours, I suspected someone had gone back to PA with a big truck, and transported those rocks to here. My pace slowed down. By 6pm I reached the headquarters of the park. But the visitor center had closed by 4pm. So I missed a free soda there. But it has a drinking fountain. I got the water I needed, cooked and ate my dinner before going forward to the High Point shelter. On this last 1.8 miles, The highlight was the monument For the Highest Point of New Jersey - a slightly smaller version of Washington Monument in DC.","Blink Shelter

New Jersey in Chinese translation has a word “泽”, means water, marshland. It is very suitable for today’s trail. Lots of marsh/swamp fields that I walked through on temporary wooden boards, or on beautifully constructed boardwalks. There are also lots of bugs. So I almost wear my bug net all day, and still got bitten on hands, arms and legs where they were covered by clothes. There was no win when we face bugs!

The forest and swamp were nice to wildlife. I constantly heard birdsongs and frog calls. A frog with shiny green top and shiny brown bottom hopped near me. Then it froze for a very long time when I photographed it. It was a hot day for hiking. It was a day better spent swimming in a pool, or napping at home. Even the maple tree under the sun had leaves shrunk to conserve evaporation. When the trail went through uncovered areas, which were a lot today, I could feel the heat coming from both underneath and overhead. My clothes were constantly wet with sweat. So drinking water was always occupied my mind. It was nice that I carried enough water today from last shelter. It was also a heavy load to carry so much water.At the end of the day, I checked into a motel for a chance to get more food and cool drinks.","High point shelter

Happy 4th of July!  I got on trail by 8:00 am. The hotel owner shuttled me to the trail head. It was a very nice hotel, newly renovated with upscale fixtures, large clean shower room, and build in 2 USB charging outlets. I wished the laundry could be much cheaper than $10, and have tea in addition to coffee. The first 2 miles were steep climb on rocks. It was good to get this done before it got too hot. At the first road crossing, a cooler with many cold drinks was there for trail magic. I was hot and thirsty from the hard climb earlier. So I was really happy for the cold drinks. Then at another road crossing, another cooler full of cold drinks was there again. I grabbed a string cheese and another cold iced tea! Thanks for all the wonderful trail angels to provide us with much needed drinks!Before 2pm after a few purple rocks scramble, I arrived at the state line between NJ and NY. It was emotional to me. My family had lived in NY state for about 6 years before moving back to CA. It’s been almost 19 years since I left. It felt like coming back to my hometown! After crossed the state line. I sat there for some time, just to let the homey feeling wash over my mind before moved on. The moves were mostly on large rocks. It went on for a long time. Some sections were more challenging then others. The rocks all have purple color, with white crystal inserts embedded. An American flag was set on top of a huge rock, added more atmosphere to 4th of July Celebration. 
While I was walking fast on an easy section of the trail in the afternoon, all of a sudden a loud rattling sound made me almost jumped. A large rattle snake was right there about a foot from my left in the fallen leaves by the trail side. It was well camouflaged in the leaves. I must surprised it too for its rattling warning was the most earnest I had heard! I quickly moved away from it. It slithered forward to further investigate me - a large object that could mean extreme danger. I carefully backed out, keeping my distance, but looked at it carefully too. Its skin had a beautiful shine, its belly bulged with the last meal that it might had not long ago. A well fed, healthy, large, beautiful rattler! My first encounter of a rattlesnake on A.T..

It was a hot and humid day. For the first time my sweat run down my face constantly. At the end, my skin hurts from drying with bandana. The trail was challenging too. Many large rock scrambles. Even though some places can be easily pass around, the A.T. built on rocks! Sometimes it felt the challenges were done on purpose- to make it tougher. As a place called lemon squeezer, the AT goer had to squeeze up and out from two rocks formed narrow crack - barely enough to get one person squeezed through without pack. Fortunately “moon walker” was there when I got there. So he helped me lifted my backpack so that I could walk through the crack with no backpack!
In this hot day, thru-hikers relied on good wills of local mountain club people. They put drinking water on trailhead of road crossings. Without them I don’t think I could make it through. And I carried about 2.5 liters of water to start with. I added at least 1 liter more from their bottles. The fingerboard shelter doesn’t have reliable water near by. So I hope my water will last to tomorrow morning when I get to the first water source. This shelter had bear problems. I see a bear trap was set up in here. The bear cable is nice to have.","Wildcat shelter

I plan to meet my classmate after about 15 miles hike today. So I started early at 6:20am. It was hot and humid even in the morning. Because the shelter doesn’t have water near by, I planed to get water from the public beach on a lake about 1 mile into the hike. When I reached the road that would reach the beach house, there were bottles of spring water at the trail head putting there by the mountain club volunteers. What a nice gift they gave to hikers! It saved me at least 40 minutes for the round trip to get water from the beach house.
Just before the noon time, the thunderstorm rolled in. The shower brought very nice relief from the heat. Instead of covering myself with poncho, I let the rain soaking my shirt and pants, feeling refreshed and renewed. The sticky layer of salt and sweat washed away. The forest became alive again, so was me. The shower came and go several times, breaking with lovely sunlights dancing in the breeze moved leaves. At lunch break, I cooked pine needles tea. My heat clogged stomach instantly felt so much better. It was a Saturday today, many day hikers were on the trail. As they learned that I am thru-hiking the “WHOLE THING”, their eyes opened big, admiration and encouragement were delivered. I was proud and blessed. 
In the early afternoon, I entered Bear Mountain State Park. For the next 4 miles, the trail was the best constructed trail on the A.T. Up to now. This is the New York State that I had remembered: sophisticated and beautiful. Man made beauties blended nicely with nature’s wonders. My state tax dollars were not wasted when I was a resident here, so are the current residents now. Even after l left this state for 19 years, I still love it a lot.

So my heavy backpack was in their car. The whole 12 miles of light and cruising through the forest. We picked blueberries and tasted blackberries during the hike. There were some short rocky sections and three hills on today’s route. But all were very manageable. The bugs were still problematic at some areas, though. 
Even though there was no great view point today, I liked their accompany, and happy to share anything they liked to know about A.T. .
For dinner, we went to a Spanish restaurant in the lovely downtown of Peekskill. Very tasty dishes with salads, seafood, cheese and meat platter.

It drizzled in the morning. But it didn’t make the hiking more difficult. Before noon time, the sun came out, and it was hot and humid again. That’s the typical summer in the east coast. 
I came to Canopus Lake shore in the drizzle. The water was quite and gray. Going up hill, the panorama view of the hill hugged lake was more impressive. A sign showed the side trail to beach front campsite. Up on the hill I can see the beach, and people canoeing down there. It was very attempting, but it was a long way down. I kept walking.
Up to a hill top, a large American flag was painted on the rocks. God bless America! I felt the patriotic hearts beating here. No body loves their country as much as the Americans do. We proudly and deliberately put our beautiful flags on everything, everywhere, and in every imaginable forms. 
In the early afternoon, I reached RPH shelter. It was a pretty property with cozy lounge chairs and picnic tables. There were two bird houses on a post in the lawn. Orange day lilies and purple basil decorated the garden area. I wish I could stay for the night. But it was too early to stop hiking. Also 5 miles down the trail, it has a Pizzaria. I wanted pizza for my dinner. I was not disappointed. The pizza with its crispy thin crust tasted so good. Last time when I ate a pizza, it was more than 1 month ago, and it was a frozen pizza.

I got out of tent in early morning and saw the forest was draped in fogs. When I hiked under big net, it became a fog catcher. The cool moist air felt good for my skin and lung. By 8am, the sunlight warmed up the mountain, heavenly lights broke through the fog. Lots of birds started to sing their morning songs, making the forest alive and busy. “Here, children, heeeeere!”, they called earnestly.
Several of large oak trees stood out surprisingly on the trail. They don’t have a name like the big one called Keffer on the south. But they are compatible sizes. 
Near noontime, I reached the Nuclear Lake - a clear lake with an alarming name due to its history of nuclear fuels processing research facility at the location. Most lakes and ponds I’ve seen in NJ and NY were overly nutritious and choked with water plants. This lake was still relatively clear with mostly open surface. In the sunshine it looks pleasantly blue. 
When I got water from Morgen Stewart shelter, I used an old fashioned hand pump. It reminded me of a similar pump I used in the 1970s back in Beijing. It was fun to use it here again. 
In later afternoon I reached NY road 22. Got a cold outdoor shower and drinking water from the Native Garden Center next to the trail. Their garden was very beautiful. The ice cream and cool iced tea were very satisfying.

The last 4 miles in New York State was easy and peaceful. At one point in the quiet forest, I saw a half dead tree with the profile of a joker face in black. It was a surprise since it appeared suddenly after a corner. It made my heart jumping, at the same time made me laughed at myself.By 10:00am I have arrived at the Connecticut State line. Nine states done, five more to go!
From there I climbed up to ten mile hill, then the trail soon followed a lovely creek and later a river. The song of water accompanied me into Bulls Bridge - a covered bridge. Along the river, cascades flowed through boulders, forming deep water holes in many places. I can tell it’s a local favorite recreation place. Trout and bass are managed in here for fishing. In a country general store, I bought cold drinks and sandwich for lunch. A nice change from my usual energy bar and trail mix.

The weather was pretty hot as the high was 88 degrees. All the serious climbs were in the afternoon. For me the climbing part was not too bad. The real challenge part began after the climb. From the top, the trail started to go up and down, up and down for countless times. And it was very rocky and steep, too. Thankfully I had bought cool Gatorade in the store and put most of it in my thermos bottle. It helped a lot.By 7 pm, I finally reached Algo Mountain shelter to rest my tired body and feet.","Pawling Nature Reserves

It’s humid and buggy today, even in the morning. I was sweating hard the whole day. The going was rough in the first a few miles especially when it was down a big boulder after St. Jones ledges. For a person as me with short legs, it means I needed to use all fours, and sometimes my butt to reach the stepping rocks below. Two men passed me on that section, their long legs allowed them to go one step after another much easier. It also didn’t help that my left knee started to feel funny in the middle of the climbing down. But as soon as I reached the river road, it’s heavenly flat! The following 5 miles were great for me to makeup the lost time when dealing with the rocks. And I really needed it to complete the 17 miles in daylight time. The walk along the slow flowing river was also very soothing. An old guy cut branches at couple of sections of this trail that he maintains. I thanked him for his kind job.
For most of the afternoon, I was on the trail with many ups and downs, some was steep, too. For the last mile before I reached the Pine Swamp Brook shelter, there was a shorter version of the lemon squeezer. When I went through the crack, I kept looking for snakes. If there was one, I’d be doomed. Fortunately there was none. In NY and CT, I had not seen as many snakes as in the southern states.
I made to the shelter before 7:10pm, much better than I estimated.","Algo Mountain shelter

It was still humid in the morning. But  it was on the cool side. So the going was easy, as well as the trail. In less than 4 hours, I had finished more than 6 miles and came to the Mountainside Cafe. I ordered 4 different things: 2 pastries, 1 fruit cup, and a milk tea, still felt empty after I finished them. I requested a roasted cauliflower salad with tofu. Only after eating that, I felt full. It kept me from feeling hungry for the full afternoon.
For the next two hours of hike, the trail was almost flat along the Housatonic River. It was well maintained trail in the form of a boulevard lined with benches. It let me to the hiker friendly Hydroelectric plant. A cold outdoor shower head and a portable water faucet sticking out of the thick vines of a brick building. A few hikers were sitting there for their lunch break. An iron bridge was near by, marked for A.T. crossing the river. I followed it to Amesville, a small helmet of Falls Village. A man made water fall is nearby on the river, partly utilizing the natural rock formation in the river itself. Electricity is generated from there. It was a quite impressive water fall. Up to the Prospect mountain, I can see a race car track down below. And the noises from race cars constantly disturbed the beautiful bird songs, sometimes unbearably loud. Half mile from road 44, I reached 1500 miles marker! Another milestone for my trek!

In the past week, I space warped to Beijing to visit my hospitalized father. Leaving him in there and knowing that he will be released from hospital lifted a heavy stone from my heart. My friend in Albany, NY helped me a lot to make this trip possible. I cannot thank her and her husband enough!
Today I came back on trail to continue my A.T. journey. Being confined in the airplane for more than 15 hours made me sick. My throat was hurt, l lost my voice, and I think I had a fever for the most of the day. It was like walking on soft cotton mattress with sour joints. So I only did less than 5 miles today, pulled into Brassie Brook shelter around 2pm. The trail was very easy today. I am glad that it stayed that way. My friends day hiked with me to Lions Head before turned back to home. It was still in the heat wave that had been lasted for the whole week before. By chance I had escaped from the heat wave except this very last day. Tomorrow the rain will bring much needed cool temperatures.
I met “So Far So Good” at the shelter. She’s also just back on trail from a two weeks break recovering from an illness. It’s nice to meet a lady with many things in common between us. Later a young “Pegasus” walked into the shelter. I had seen him in Woods Hole hostel over a month ago. Being off trail gave me opportunity to meet hikers whom I had passed long time ago.

I slept for 10 hours from 7pm to 5am. The rest was great for me to recover from the traveling and getting better from my sour throat. Fully rested and refreshed, I started hiking by 6:10am. 
It was much cooler today. Humidity was also down. It was very pleasant to hike all morning. Shortly after leaving the shelter, I came to a junction that goes to Bear Mountain along A.T. in one direction, and goes around Bear Mountain in another. I chose the longer but easier option: goes around the mountain top. I still don’t trust my knee to go down steep rocks. If there is an alternative, I’ll choose that. So I went to the side trail. It’s almost flat, and passed through a bog trail, an AMC cabin, and a trail following a small creek nearly parallel to CT/MA state line. In about 30 minutes it rejoined A.T. right before the state line. At the location where CT/MA state line intersects with A.T., there was no official marker! Only a line drawn by hiking pole on the ground marked that crossing. Later I understood why. The trail goes along Sage Ravine Brook for about 1.5 miles. Even though most of that area is within Massachusetts, it is actually managed by Connecticut. Therefore the Massachusetts message only appears when the trail leaves Sage Ravine Brook. This area is a fragile environment, bubbling creek with many swimming holes, dense forest, twisted roots wrapping around mossy rocks, cool, dark, and has that magical fairy tale forest kind of atmosphere. When I passed through it, I held my breath unconsciously, afraid of making unnecessary sounds that could break the magical spells casted on that area.

This magical place was followed by open views on Race Mountain. The A.T. runs along open ledges where I saw green forest and shiny lakes down below, rocky paths with one side of dropping cliff, weather beaten pines and oaks only grow to dwarf size. Blueberry bushes were at ankle height loaded with ripe berries, so tasty and sweet. I put my backpack down to go berries picking. In 5 minutes, I got many handful of juicy berries.
Before noontime, I reached Mt. Everett. A few foot posts of a fire watch tower marked the top of the mountain. The tower burned down in 2002, leaving the posts as a good bench for hikers to take a rest.   When I got down from Mt. Everett to Guilder Pond trail head parking, a few day hikers were doing trail magic with ice cold water and cookies. It was very nice to have the  fresh clean cool water available when the water from nearby creeks was all brown. 
I had my lunch at Glen Brook shelter tenting area. This was my planned camping location. But since it was so early in the day, I had not felt tired, and the rain was still not coming yet, I decided to hike more, down to road 41. 
An hour later, the rain started, firstly light drops, then steady rain. I was looking for camping spots, but didn’t found anyone good enough to stay. So I kept hiking till I reached that road at 4:30pm. By that time I was pretty wet. Even though I was not tired, I had given up the camping option and booked a hotel about 6 miles away in the town of Great Barrington. Getting to the hotel was a lot more difficult than I expected. After more than 10 calls to the hotel and taxi company, 3 tries on Uber, more than 30 times raised my arm and thumb to hitchhike, I was still at the trail head with pouring rain for 2 hours. In desperate, I called Karen - an A.T. thru-hiker of 1994, whom was listed in the A.T. guide book. I contacted Karen earlier today at noontime hoping she would have available room for rent. But she had full house today and cannot spare any room for me. When I called her again after 6:20pm, explained my awkward situation, she immediately came to my rescue! In 5 minutes, I was in her truck on the way to my hotel. She’s not only helped me today, but also arranged her partner to pick me up from the hotel tomorrow morning to send me back to the trail head. What a wonderful trail angel she is! Thank you so much, Karen! With Karen’s help, now I am dry and comfortable in the hotel room ready to have a good night sleep.","Brassie Brook shelter

My experience in last night hotel “Latern House motel in Great Barrington, MA” was awful. The people who run the hotel were either cold blooded or they have hatred towards hikers. I wrote my review on TripAdvisor and sent an email to ATC requesting them to remove this hotel from future hiker’s guide book. To be brief, they said my backpack was ugly and cannot stay in their front porch for even less than 5 minutes. Their breakfast was so lean, only half bagels and some cereals. Anything you ask for a little bit help from them, they kept repeating that it is not their job to help you. Anyway I will never stay there again.


Talking about something positive, Karen’s partner David came this morning to help me get back to the trail head. He told me Karen is a triple crowner, and an author of many award winning books on hiking and music. I was honored to meet Karen and David. I also have read one of her books about PCT a few years ago. What a great person she is. 
There have been chances of rain for most part of the day. But all the chances had been just a little drops here and there. Not even worth of putting on my rain gear. But the trail was still pretty wet and slippery. In the first hour of my hike, I have also collected more than 20 mosquito bites in the damp forest. But the forest was so beautiful. Lichen and moss covered to rocks and trees made the forest very colorful and interesting to look at. It was dark and quiet. Wet leaves, shining super green, made my clothes wet, too. In the afternoon, I traveled in east mountain. It was a monotonous trail with low bushes lined both sides, and many small ups and downs for a long time. By 4pm, I reached Tom Leonard shelter for the night. I only saw 3 hikers in early morning today until more hikers showed up at the shelter after 5:30pm. For most of the hike today, I had the solitude on trail.","MA 41

It was that perfect day for hiking! It’s been long time since I had a perfect hiking day. Temperatures were between mid 50s to mid 70s. Sunny and low humidity, a little breeze throughout the day. I left the campsite before 7:00am. The first mile was filled with fragrant of an unknown wildflower. The sunlights filtered through leaves leaving patches of gold, making mosses so green that when you look at them you have to half close your eyes. A couple of hours later, I came to Benedict Pond. A few large rocks half submerged in clear water, making a great spot to rest and catch a little breeze. Mosquitoes didn’t like the wind, which gave me a nice relief. Blueberries were abundant here. Very soon my hands were busy picking them. 
Near the Wilcox South shelter, I met a group teenagers. They call themselves “Greenagers” - a volunteer organization to fix the trails. These are the hope of the great American.
When I reached Jerusalem road, I found a trail stand from Running Spring farm. It had soda, snacks and FRESH EGGs! I bought one can of Mountain Dew and two eggs, hard boiled them on the spot. They tasted so delicious! As I am writing about the eggs, I wish I got 4 instead of 2. The extra food and drink gave me more power. I continued for 3 additional miles with 1000ft elevation gain before called it the night.

The trail went around so many lakes/ponds today. They reminded me of a movie “On Golden Pond” in the early 80s. It was one of the a few American movies played in China when the country just opened its door to foreign culture. The beautiful scenery was very memorable to me even though I did not fully understand that movie. For all the ponds I have passed today, if I need to pick a favorite one, it would be the Finerty pond. Near the shore, pink flowers grow in the water, a plant with spiky fruits and water lilies also call it home. Blue dragonflies darted from one plant to another, many flat rocks littered on shore, so I could walk on them effortlessly.The trails has many muddy sections. Some of them reminded me of the sections in Pennsylvania. But people in MA has done a better job. They lined the trails with either wooden planks or steppingstones. So my boots are dry and not muddy.My favorite activity happened near evening. I came to a hiker friendly blueberry farm near the trail. I picked a bucket of blueberries- much larger than the wild ones found on trail. I ate half in dinner and will have the rest for tomorrow ‘s breakfast. The farm also have fresh eggs. I had them in my dinner too. The farm lawn is breezy, it kept mosquitoes to minimum!","Webster road

A hiker wrote in a shelter registry book that he saw a moose with its baby yesterday. I didn’t know moose is down so far south in MA. I did see something looked like moose droppings in the past couple of days. May be they are around here. You never know what is hiding behind the dense forest.
Today evening the trail passed a cobble hill. The whole hill was made of white marble. The size of it was very impressive. I visited a marble museum in Vermont many years ago. The texture and the patterns on those marvelous stones gave my great memory. Now think about this whole mountain contains the half transparent rocks, made me smile to walk on it, even though it is not as well polished as the ones in palaces. Some part of the path were covered with marble sand, pure white, sparkling in late afternoon sunlight. 
Today I also crossed Dalton, MA at noontime. It’s community recreation center allows hikers to take a shower with $5 donation. I took the advantage of it. Once cleaned, I ate a nice lunch in Dalton Restaurant across the street. This made me not feeling hungry for the whole afternoon, much longer than the energy bars and trail mixes can last. Also, it prompted me to hike 4.4 miles to reach the little town of Cheshire. As I walked into the town, I heard music blast. Two seniors stopped their car to chat with me about my hike on A.T., they told me the town was doing a block party tonight. After I set up my tent in the lawn of the Saint Mary’s church, I went to join the party. A band was playing music, kids with painted faces and hands running and dancing while holding their balloons. There was also a food truck sailing burgers, hot dogs and sodas. An ice cream stand was next to the truck. Here comes my dinner with another cheeseburger and ice cream! I got a lot more calories today. Oh, there was also a day hiker did trail magic in the morning. I took one blueberry donut from his stock. In the evening at the church, a 12 year old boy also did trail magic. He gave me an apple and filled my water bag. So my intake of calories should definitely close to the 5000 recommended amount!","Webster road

Even though Cheshire is small, one resident had a great influence in American history. Elder John Leland played an important role in the creation of the first amendment of the constitution: the freedom of speech! In the lovely morning sun, the star spangled banners lined up on the street near it’s elementary school. Walking on A.T. sometimes felt like reading an American history book alive.
Massachusetts section of A.T. is well graded and maintained. Walking in its forest is an enjoyment minus the bugs. It has enough ups and downs to keep one’s heart pumping and exciting, but without too much worrying of a twisted ankle or a broken leg. 
Since I left Shenandoah National Park, it was the first time that I went to a peak higher than 3000ft. And by noon time, I was standing on Greylock Summit, the highest point in MA. The war memorial tower was the most artistically designed and best constructed monument on A.T. that I have seen. Comparing to this, the Clingmans Dome in the Smokies felt too raw! In the nice comparably grand building Bascom Lodge next to the tower, I had a sit down lunch with grilled cheese sandwich and cool orange juice. One guy, who was day hiking in the state park, kept asking me questions about my A.T. thru-hike. Recently I have gotten a lot more compliments from people when they learned that I have been walked to “here” from Springer Mountain in Georgia. Because it was too far to walk from, and not doable for most of them. Most of the people wished me the best on my journey. Thanks for all the wonderful comments and wishes from all the strangers.

There were also many SOBOs now. One day I saw about 10 of them. In the campsites where hikers aggregated, we swapped information and stories.Before 5pm, I reached route 2 near North Adams and Williamstown. My college classmates picked me up. They drove more than 3 hours from Boston to meet me. With them having a car, we checked into a motel near the border of Vermont, showered, did laundry and had a good dinner. In the evening, we learned there was a fireworks show in Pownal, VT. We went to join the party. The show was great. Party food, cotton candy, nighttime illuminated toys made the kids and kids-at-hearts so happy. The band played very nice country music songs. We danced to the music along with local folks. When the darkness fell, fireworks began. All the Ahs-and-Awes came in rhythm with the lights in the sky. The kids went wild! It was such a wonderful night in the cool summer breeze on the expansive lawn in a heart of a small town.","Cheshire, MA

In this Nero day, my classmates and me visited Natural Bridge State Park and Mass MoCA in North Adams after I did shopping for resupplies. Natural Bridge is next an old marble query. The query had stop production and converted to a nice looking U shaped marble cliff over a green lawn edged with bushes and flowers. The Natural Bridge is over a water pathway following down a marble dam - yes, the only dam made of marble blocks! The power of the water was for a historical mill that had been destroyed in a fire more than 70 years ago. The power of the current created deep chasms with circular pools and cut under a piece of marble to made it a bridge. Colors of green from lichen, moss, small plants , yellow and cinnamon from minerals depositions combined with white and gray from the stones made the deep and curvy chasm in nice contrast patterns. A short flat trail in the woods near by added more relaxed atmosphere in the park. We had a snack break before noontime under a big shaded tree in cool breeze.
In the afternoon, we spent about 4 hours in Mass MoCA - a very large contemporary art museum in multiple brownstone buildings converted from an old electronic factory. There were many exhibitions with different media. Modern and expressive. It was also a popular place in here, with restaurants and coffee shops close by. We had our late lunch in there, too.
Back on the trail after 4:30pm, my friends offered to carry my backpack for a while to “experience the A.T.” as they said. Then we said goodbye and went to our separated ways. I hiked alone again. The sound of thunderstorm started to roll in closer. By 5:50pm, I reached the campsite of the night. Set up my tent just before the shower poured water from the sky. With great timing, I was lucky to keep dry for today!","Route 2 near North Adams

In the morning at 10am, I said goodbye to Massachusetts and stepped on to Vermont. 11 states done, 3 remained. The place looked damp and muddy. Not long after that state line, a sticks marked the 1600 miles of A.T.. less than 600 miles to go! In this section the AT follows another famous trail: long trail. It was actually the inspiration of AT.


To summarize today’s trail I can use just one word: soggy. Many places had mud 2-6 inches deep. Even though the terrain was not difficult, I walked very slowly picking my way through the mud. A 12 miles day lasted so long. I spent almost 9 tiresome hours excluding 2 hours of phone and lunch time. Every dry stretch was a blessing. Here toads, big or small, call it home. Some as small as my thumbnail. They hopped around on the trail. I was afraid to step on them accidentally. 
Finally I pulled into Congdon shelter just before 6pm. There was no energy left in me. Sweet dreams!","Sherman Brook Campsite

I knew I was in Vermont when every direction I looked I could see marbles. Even some of the gravel road is made of crushed marbles. So for lots of steppingstones in the muddy part of the trail. When I step on them, I was extra careful since they were well polished and looked slippery.
Today there were less mud on trail. So my traveling speed was improved. For 14.4 miles, I spent 1.5 hours less than yesterday, even though the elevation gain was slightly higher today. I hope this condition holds for tomorrow because I need to hike more than 17 miles to get a good camping place.
Still see lots of jumping toads and maybe some frogs, too. Some art of the trail passed by water bodies. Wooden boards were placed over watery swamp. There was no good view of any pond today, overgrown forest and bushes blocked all the views. In morning it was humid and warm. In the afternoon, however, breeze came over the ridges and made climbing so much enjoyable. I am expecting rain tonight. The sound of rain drops will make me sleep better.","Congdon shelter

An enchanted forest has these characters: lots of trees, carpet of mosses and ground cover with flowers, creeks and springs, large interesting rocks. And the forest has to be so dense that sunlights can only sparsely penetrate through the canopy. Green Mountain in Vermont has all of the above. Its canopy forever keeps the sunlight away, leaving ground moist all the time. The dropped leaves made the ground so spongy, walking on it felt bouncy. Its green mosses grow very long, with their spurs sticking out on hair thin stems that made them look like floating in the air. Its springs are so cold that when I used it in a bucket to wash my feet yesterday, my feet can only stay in water for a few seconds before they felt hurt. 
Walking through an enchanted forest, especially after last night rain, or even better in the rain at noontime today, not only I felt joy to watch the shining clean leaves, nodding wet flowers, orange spotted salamanders, but also I needed concentration on my footing. It’s mud, mud and mud everywhere. It’s passing through mud maze all the time. The only good thing was less bugs due to cool temperature. One less thing to distract me from my focus on the muddy trails.
Stratton Mountain has a special place in the heart of all A.T. thru-hikers. It was here more than 80 years ago, Benton MacKaye’s idea of a very long trail to link all Appalachian peaks was formed. It is a sacred mountain to behold. The trail to the peak was well maintained and easy to walk. The 1700ft elevation gain from the trail head parking lot didn’t feel difficult at all. It was late afternoon. When I reached the fire tower at the peak close to 6:20pm, thunder could be heard roaring nearby. The trees were all in the fogs. It was too late to go down the mountain to the shelter 3 miles away. I decided to stay overnight near the spring 3/10 mile from the peak. After I set up the tent, late afternoon sun peeked through clouds for a short hour before sunset. The enchanted forest around my tenting place felt magical once more. I felt lucky to be right here in the very mountain where A.T. was born.","Goddard shelter

Today was a super easy day with a perfect weather. I hiked into town of Manchester Center in about 13 miles. It was mostly down hill on gentle grade, not much uphill. I still picked my way through mud. And there was a lot of mud. The Green Mountain Club that maintains the trail has such a difficult problem to deal with. 
At noon time, I reached the Prospect Rock that had wonderful views of the town below. It looked so far away from there. But within 2 hours, I have reached the beautiful town. The town is not big, but have everything people need to live comfortably. Abby from California, who’s doing summer work in a farm here, saw me walking on the busy road and offered me a ride for the last mile into the town center. She used to work in Hidden Villa, one of the local farm in San Mateo county where I had hiked into many times. What a small world. 
In the afternoon, I did laundry, resupplies shopping, visited their farmer’s market, and had dinner in a taco restaurant which only gets ingredients from local suppliers. All set to go back to the trail tomorrow.","Stratton Mountain

In the early morning, “Wheels” shuttered me back to the trail head. Her husband “Daddy long legs” is doing thru-hike flip-flop style. They are from Georgia Tech. He retired earlier this year and planned to do this hike. But in the Spring, he found out that he had cancer. A surgery was scheduled 2 months later. Instead of waiting at home for his surgery, he did over 600 miles of A.T. going north from Harpers Ferry. Then he went back home for the surgery. After recovery from surgery 6 weeks later, he’s back on trail, trying to finish the rest of the northern section, then flip over to Harpers Ferry and walk south back home. “Wheels” meets his every week to give him support and make sure he’s taking a rest day. I happened to stay in the same rental house with them last night. They were so kind to give me a lift to the trail head. 
5.5 miles into the hike, when I approach an unpaved forest road, a trail magic sign was there. “Spineless Cougar” from Albany,NY was there giving out watermelon, oranges, bananas, donuts, cookies and cold drinks. He has been doing this for 5 years after retirement. When I was hot, sweaty just came down from a mountain peak, the cool watermelon tasted as the best food in the whole world. Thanks for the magic!
In early afternoon, I reached Peru shelter. This shelter was first built in 1935 and rebuilt twice with the last one in 2000. A well constructed sturdy shelter. A happy singing stream is right in front of it. Half mile later, I was a lake. Like most lakes in the Northeast, it was already super crowded with water plants.
After a few hours of ups and downs, the last climb was Baker Peak before the trail decent to my planned campsite Lost Pond. It was a big surprise near the top of Baker Peak. Out of blue there were slanted rocks. Big slanted rocks made up the pathway of the trail, like they were dropped out of the sky. I haven’t seen this type of rocks  since PA. And it was so different from the soft muddy peaks in Vermont so far. After climbed the rocks and took in all the nice views around the peak, I saw a sign a little bit down hill pointing out a “bad weather route”. I have not seen such a sign before climbed on the rocks on the other side of the peak. Was the sign only there because going down through these rocks would be a lot more dangerous than going up?
There were more than 10 people in Lost Pond shelter area. I have got to know many of them on trail. It was nice to chat with them, exchange knowledge and information.","Manchester Center

The rain came quickly in the morning just before I packed my tent. It left quickly too, 20 minutes after I started hiking in the rain, the sun came out again. But I had to carry a wet tent for the rest of the day.I started hiking with “Stripe” who carried am American flag on his backpack. He proudly telling the hikers that at his home which is close to an airport, he hangs a huge flag so that every plane can see it.
Before 10am, I reached road 10 where there were 2 trail magic going on. The first one was a guy from Syracuse area. His decorations were also  very cute with colorful tablecloth,lots of toys, and flowers. I ate a lot of food there, including 2 fried eggs, some potato, a sausage, two large pieces of bread, and 2 pieces of watermelon. A short distance later, another group of local people also setup trails magic to cook full breakfast and lunch. I only took a few pieces of gummy bear candy and took a picture of the set up.
In early afternoon, the trail passed an area with large boulders. People put many rocks on top of the boulders for the balancing art work. It looked cool.
After a hard climb in the afternoon, I was ready to set up tent and settle for the night. A group of young Boy Scouts cooked too much food. So each hiker at the shelter shared their bean and rice burrito. Consider this as the third trail magic for today!","Lost Pond Shelter

Big climb was expected today for going up to Killington Peak. But before that 2200ft climbing in the afternoon, there was a steep walk going down to a gorge, then climb back up about 700ft in the morning. This plus some minor ups, made the total elevation gain for about 3700ft for today. It turned out all was manageable. Even though it was steep, there was hardly any big rocks to negotiate on the route. So I just took baby steps to get it done. Along the way there was a nice view point to look at the Rutland regional airport. It was fun to look at it from one ridge, then went around, climb up a hill and look at it from another angle. The creeks in the gorge was very clear and happy too. There was quite a few of bridges to cross today. The bid boulders in the creeks were nicely rounded. 

The final 2200ft climb was mostly walking through the roots. Lots of roots, live and dead trees roots, along a narrow pathway on steep slopes. I had the company of young “Orange”, chatting along the way. So time passed quickly. Before we stopped for a break, we were already only need to climb less than 500ft!
There were also two trail magic today. One was in two coolers at a road crossing. Cool soda and cookies were satisfying for my energy needs. Then a guy with a truck was doing trail magic yesterday and today at a later road crossing. Thanks for all nice treats!
After I reached the Cooper Lodge shelter near Killington Peak, I was informed that the water source has dried up there. Two young boys told me there could be water at the peak lodge. I climbed the 0.2 mile spur trail to the peak. The views wowed me. At over 4200ft, on large rock bed, all mountains in 360 degrees view were lower than where I was standing. Late evening sun lit the rocks a soft yellow gleaming color. I walked to the peak lodge, but after searching for half hour, I found no place to get water. However, the views were still worth the effort to get up here. On top of the peak, there were 12 NoBos sitting here waiting for the sunset. Some of us might be go together all the way to Kartadin.

It was pretty cold last night and this morning. I can feel the nippy air from north. When I started hiking, I wear three layers. Since there was no water at the shelter last night, I had only 4 oz of water left this morning. So I didn’t cook breakfast until I reached a stream 20 minutes into the hike. It was fun to cook and ate a hot meal on the trail side. Especially at a place carpeted with hemlock dry leaves and velvet cushion of mosses. 
A few miles into the hike, I saw a stone marked 1700 on the ground. Here I have completed 1700 miles of A.T.. Yeah!
Even though climbing up to Killington Peak yesterday was steep, coming down from it today was more gradual. The real hard work was in the afternoon after the trail passed Thundering Falls. It helped that I had a big ice cream cone and a can of sugary lemonade at Gifford Woods State Park before climbed the Quimby Mountain. I don’t know how many peaks are on this mountain. It felt one after another, and another, and another. When I reached Stony Brook shelter, I was tired, so was my trekking pole.

Recently I have been more and more aware how obsessed hikers are with food. Not all types of food, but food cooked by a human, less processed, or naturally edible, such as fresh fruits. I observed this not only on other hikers behavior, but also on myself. Yesterday in the Gifford Woods State Park, a camper offered me two peaches. He said that I could eat one at that time, and carry another one with me. I ate both on the spot. The peaches never tasted so good. Secretly I wished he could gave me more. If he gave me five, I would have ate them all on the spot! Through out my hike, especially in warm weather, I craved for watermelon the most. Any trail magic that had watermelon, believe me, I wanted to kiss the trail angels for that. 
Being said this, a hiker would also walk extra miles in order to reach a restaurant or a farm stand for the cooked food and fresh produce. As of today, the guide book said that “On the Edge” farm stand is only 0.2 miles from A.T. crossing a road. Every hiker I had met today planned to go there. Unfortunately, it was not open today. When I learned this information, I was disappointed so much that I felt my stomach sank. When I told other hikers about this, I can see their expressions as the news sinking in: disbelief, denial, sad, maybe a little bit of anger, then withdrew. Everyone’s dinner plan was ruined! Fortunately, there will be another farm market open tomorrow 6 miles further at another road crossing. This thought lifted everyone’s spirit. It was amazing to see and realize how our humans life depends on food and controlled by food. It is built into our DNA. We just can’t help it. Hiking for many months had robbed our easy access to home cooked meals and fresh tasty produces. So our body naturally reacted with cravings of them. 
For today’s hike, it was mostly small ups and downs with a few hundreds feet couple of times. Some were steeper than others. But all were not too bad. Trail conditions were also nice, little mud and little rocks. A few places were blocked by broken trees where I had to go around. The next a few days look like similar profile as today.

It turned out that the Cloudland farm market was a disappointment. They only got some jerky and one flavor of ice cream. Their restaurant is for reserved dinner only. However, on the trail at one road crossing earlier, a yellow sign pinned on a tree led me to A.T. thru-hiker in year 2016 “Firefly & Loon”’s back porch. They bought this property 2 years ago, only 100 yards from A.T.. on their back porch, they stocked lots of goodies, drinks, hard boiled eggs and fresh fruits for very reasonable prices. I got my sweet watermelon, chocolate milk and a cheese stick for $3.50. Relaxed on their nice porch, overlooking their beautiful yard with many colorful flowers and nice vegetable garden. A swallowtail butterfly danced in their day lily patch while I was eating the watermelon. This was a pleasant treat for today.
In the afternoon, the trail led me through a town of West Hartford. There’s a nice river in the town. Many people were swimming in there. A sign announced farmers market for today. There was only one guy selling a few vegetables. He was the only vender in the farmers market. A village store was closed for good, and the church looked very sad too. I really hope the town can do better.
In late afternoon just when I started to climb the last hill for the day, a shower brought thunders and rain. If you have not hiked in a shower in a forest before, you really missed something in your life. In a thunderstorm the forest becomes dark and quiet, a little bit prohibitively fearful, but full of energy and excitement. The only sounds you can hear are the roaring thunders and rain drops. As you walk through the forest, all the green leaves become wet and shiny, looked cleaner and greener. You could see small fragile salamanders wandering out to get as much moist air through their skin as they can. You might discover all colors of mushrooms, white, yellow, orange, red, brown, black, or even green, eagerly pushing out through the moist soil. The rocks would be also wet and shiny, remind you to be careful for the slippery surface. But their colors would be more intense, Black would be more dark, white would be more bright. By contrast, the green mosses would be greener.  For the best part if it is a fast moving storm as today’s was, in a short time, the Sun would be breaking out and having patches of golden light shine on the wet leaves. So next time when there is a shower, don’t run back home, take some rain gears and go for a walk in the woods.

It drizzled last night and this morning. I walked the last 5 miles in Vermont. In the moist air and trail, I noticed there were many orange spotted salamanders. I started to count them. There was 3 miles of forested trail. I saw 31 salamanders!  They were really out there. Please slow down for them. They looked so cute but helplessly fragile. 
In mid morning, the trail went on Elm street in Norwich, VT - the last town in Vermont. It was so hiker friendly. Many homes had hiker trail magic boxes and coolers at the drive entrance. Chairs, candies and drinks were provided. It rained hard when I was there. So I only stopped for a piece of candy. But I had a good breakfast break in Blue Sparrow Kitchen while waiting for the rain to go lighter. I didn’t have more time to visit other side of the town. But along the street where A.T.  is part of it, I can see this is a town with lots of history and charm.
Before noontime, I crossed the bridge over Connecticut River. The VT/NH state line is in the middle of the bridge. Now, Vermont is done, New Hampshire, I came!
It was busy on the road that led to Hanover, NH. Traffic, road construction and houses construction all go on here. The town of Hanover was nice and hiker friendly. For $5 I got a shower and laundry done in their community center, which also serves as a daycare center. The people on the street and in town hall were all very nice to hikers, helped me with directions and restaurant choices. I wanted to spend some time in the art museum. But after I did resupplies shopping and sorted out all the stuff I washed and bought, it was too late for the museum. I only had time to have a dinner with two fellow hikers in a Thai restaurant before go out of the town for camping.
Just by a soccer field at the edge of the town where the trees concealed everything from the hustle bustle place, I found a nice spot to set up my tent. Sweat dreams accompanied by street noises.","Happy Hill shelter

This was the first full day in New Hampshire. My original plan was going into the woods for 5 days, then check into a hostel. But I met two hikers and they asked me to join them for slackpacking. So today was a slackpacking day.I walked 0.8 miles back into downtown Hanover. At the post office the hostel driver picked up my heavy backpack, leaving me, “Brave Heart” and “Cowboy “ with only daypacks. We walked into the forest, light as if we can fly. A few hills later, we had walked 9 miles. They walked much faster than I did, so that I always lagged behind.  It was nice to have some accompany, and some one close by to take pictures. We also admired NH’s trail signs. They were just cute and clear!
 By 5pm we came to a road and find our driver has been waiting for us. 
There were lots of discussions on the slackpacking. At the end,we decided to go back to backpacking way.","In the Woods outside of Hanover

Back to backpacking style today. It will take two days to reach the next hostel. It was on the cold side, great for hiking and literally bug free! I loved it. We got a late start since “Brave Heart” needs to return her tent from post office. So we only started hiking after about 9 am. In a couple of hours we started to climb Smarty Mountain. It was steep on the upper side. Still manageable. At a point there was a great area with boulders on trail. It was open views. The first boulder field was sunny, rolling clouds formed dramatic forms. The second boulder field had many blueberry shrubs. The berries were small but very tasty. By the time I reached the third boulder field, it started drizzling, only for a few minutes. On the top of Smarts mountain there is a fire watch tower. On the windy top, I could see the mountains after mountains, layers of green, blue and grey, in all directions! An old fire Walden ‘s cabin had converted into a shelter for hikers. On the way down from the mountain, I think I found the rabbit hole fit for Alice in the wonderland. And I saw a fuzzy green puppy (a tree trunk covered by a layer of green mosses) waiting patiently for its master to come back home.
In the afternoon just before we reached the intersection to Hexacuba shelter, a shower came rapidly. It was a very cold shower. Within a few minutes my fingers numb. We decided to hike another 1.6 miles to stay on top of mountain cube to watch the scenery since the showers were predicted short live. It was a hard climb with many boulders, slick and wet. Slowly we pushed near the top while admiring the power of the rolling clouds on the ridges. Before we could reach the top, it was getting late. Time to stop going and settling down for the night. In the deep forest, I am rested and grateful for the views and the fine hiking day whilst my wet clothes were put aside. Sweat dreams.","Lyme-Dorchester Rd, Skiway

I had a late woke up at 6:30am. By the time I hit the trail it’s already 8:00am. It was chilly. Everything was still wet from last night rain. My wet pants and socks felt cold. It was like going back to the wet days in April. When I got to the top of Mountain Cube, the views were incredible. White clouds spread in the low valley like a white river. Rain washed sky and mountains peaks were clear and clean. I breathed in the cold air, felt my soul renewed. A sign at the top says it is only 2909 feet. It definitely felt much higher with surrounding mountains were lower, the clouds were very low and the temperature was also so low.

Then I got a long way down followed by more ups and downs for the rest of the day. But there was no difficulties. Near Mt.Mist, I met many kids doing a 17 miles hike over big Mt. Moosilauke. Even with the long and hard hiking day, the kids were in good spirits. Some of them looked like less than 10 years old, super boys and girls. I was very impressed.Checked in at Hikers Welcome Hostel after 13 miles hike. The staff even fixed my hiking poles! I also liked their outdoor shower and restroom with all the hot water plumbing but rustic outdoor setting. Great place for hikers.","

Last night stay in the Hikers Welcome Hostel was nice. “Buffalo” the staff in there was so helpful that he fixed both of my trekking poles - changed a new tip on the black diamond, replaced the bent section on the other. The outdoor plumbed shower and restroom were also cool. But sleeping was not too good since some hikers kept walking on the squeaky floor all night long.
I am officially in the Whites now! And I reached 1800 miles marker! Today I climbed Mt. Moosilauke - the first above tree line mountain peaks in the Whites. I teamed up with 3 other hikers, going north to south to be on the safer side since the large rocks in the north side of the mountain were steeper and wet year round. Some places there are wooden blocks installed, some had hand rails too. As we climbed up, it was strenuous, but less scary. I can picture the hikers coming down, looking at the path almost vertically downward for at least 50 to 80 feet with only wet wooden blocks for footing with nothing to hold on. I would have go down that mile on my butt all the time! When we were at the top of that section, we met “Doc” and “Champy” - two NOBO thru-hikers we had seen earlier. “Champy” just had a fall on the rocks. His leg was bleeding. It was lucky that he didn’t get hurt more seriously.
In about 3 hours we reached the treeless top of the mountain. All of a sudden the trees became short and gnarled. Branches grew longer in the windward direction only. The harsh cold wind stunned their growth. Large piles of rock canine marked the trail to the wind swept summit. Even in a summer sunny day, I felt more comfortable to put on a fleece layer and a windbreaker with the hood on. The Summit offered stunning 360 degree views of mountain peaks, river, lakes, and forest below. The landscape reminded me of the Wild West - alpine peaks in Colorado and California. I felt home on there.
At the summit, many hikers enjoyed their world. We took turns to take pictures with the summit sign post. Even this was a Monday, there was still a short line for picture taking. One guy was doing “50 at 62” challenge. He’s 62 years old, need to complete 50 miles of mountain trail run within 24 hours. A group of his friends were there to support him. He was steaming when he came up to the summit, wearing only a pair of shorts! 
The down hill from the Moosilauke was relatively easy. There were one mile gentle slope that also goes to the south peak, followed by 1.5 miles of steeper but not challenging trails, and the rest of strolling grade back to the trailhead. All done before 2:30pm. A first rewarding and beautiful day in the Whites.","NH 25 - Hikers Welcome Hostel

Took a zero today in Notch Hostel and went to North Woodstock and Lincoln, NH. The two little towns are connected by a sidewalk, separated by hwy 93. They are resort towns for winter snow sports and summer hiking and river activities. “Brave Heart” and me walked the 2.5 miles stretch for both towns, exploded the shops along the way. We did resupplies shopping, went to multiple outfitters, and watched Hobbs & Shaw action movie. 
The little town of North Woodstock has a very efficient government. In one small building housed its police department, town offices, clerk/tax collector, and the library. At the Roadside rest graveyard, a beautiful poem was written as shown in the picture. It’s the most heart touching poem I have seen.","Notch Hostel

Perfect backpacking day in the Whites today. I left Notch Hostel’s cozy house at 7 to start the hike. It was very steep right from the mountain Trail head. Before I left the hostel, I weighed my backpack, it was 33.5lbs including camera. Gee, it was heavy for the Whites!
Off we go, me, Brave Heart backpacking style, another lady, slackpacking style. From Kinsman Notch, it’s steep but easy going with steps. Then good trail for couple of miles. When we near Wolf Mountain climb, it’s steep again with lots of mud. That slowed us down. We got to Eliza Brook Shelter just past noontime for a lunch break. There were many creeks near the shelter with nice water. By this time the slackpacking lady had gone ahead of us long ago. 
For the next 2.5 miles, the trail was easy climbing at first, but about a mile before Kinsman south peak, we met with lots of boulders which I need to use both of my hands to pull me up. It was exhausting with a heavy pack. But at the same time, it’s definitely not boring. I kind of liked it. Some places were steep. Many times we felt we’d done more than 0.8 miles, we found out that we only progressed about 0.3 mile! 
Finally we pulled ourselves up to the south peak, exactly 2.5 hours for the 2.5 miles. The views on the peak was nice, but not as spectacular as on Moosilauke.
From South Peak to North Peak was mostly flat and easy. Only the last 0.1 mile was steep and rock scrambling. Then it was the dreaded down hill part. We had to butt slide a few times. Also it was taxing on our legs and knees. Finally we reached Kinsman Pond shelter just before 6:00 pm, leaving us no desire to push to Loonsome Lake, 2 more steep miles down hill from the shelter. 
The water for the shelter is a pond. It was murky and brown, looks very unpleasant. But after filtering or boiling it was okay, without any odd taste and didn’t make me sick. Setting up ZPacks’s dueplex tent on wooden platform was tricky. With a few tries, we were settled. At the shelter I met a guy 70 years old. He had decided to go home. After the hard 1800 miles, he had enough. I thought the fun just began.","Notch Hostel

In the morning Kinsman Pond was very peaceful. I found a moma duck and two ducklings welcomed me when I reached the shore of the pond. 
Knowing this is a hard day (hardly any day is not a hard day now), we started by 7:00 am. The two miles to Lonesome Lake was like the last half mile in yesterday, steep, rocky and need to slide on my butt many times. It took me more than 2 hours for that 2 miles. Lonesome Lake Hut was in the very pretty setting. The Hut itself is beautifully designed and built. Many years ago, I read an article talking about the huts in the Whites and their caretakers. I was very excited to be able to enter one today. The caretakers were all young, handsome young men and beautiful young ladies. They were very nice to us. Even though I had an oatmeal breakfast in the morning, by the time I entered the Hut, I was very hungry again. They gave us leftover breakfast: oatmeal, scrambled eggs and sausage patties. Yesterday at the campground the caretaker there gave us an orange card after registration. With the orange card, thru-hikers can get two free backed good and a soup. So I got a piece of free tasty coffee cake. I also bought a cup of tea. Sitting in the sunlight filled dining room, and later at the picnic table on front porch, eating the yummy food while looking at the trees and lake, I felt it as too good to be true, a piece of paradise!

The hard climbing was after lunch once we crossed hwy 3. At fist the uphill slope was gentle. That actually made me more anxious. Gentler at the lower part means steeper at the higher part. As predicted, the last mile to the top of Mt. Liberty was very steep. It went up more than 2000ft. But it was very little rock scrambling, just steep to walk. Therefore I was tired but not over spent. And we made good progress to reach Liberty Spring Campsite. Once we reached Franconia Ridge, the views were incredible. Blue skies with puffy white clouds were floating above Little Haystack Mountain and Mt. Lafayette. A nice gravel path on the ridge threads through the peaks. Ankle deep blueberries covered large areas on the ridge. They sure tasted sweet and juicy. Later after we summited Mt. Lafayette, I saw Mt. Lincoln, threaded by the nice walk path over its three peaks.
It took us some time to get done from Mt. Lincoln and went below the tree line. Looking at the clouds I imagined the sunset would be spectacular. But we need to get down to the protective area of trees. Finally nearly at 7:30 pm, just before the sunset, we found a good camping spot and settled for the night.","Kinsman Pond shelter

I finished writing trail journal 10 min after midnight, with dozing off a few times. The rain and wind started after that, and lasted a few hours. By 6:30am, the rain stopped. Wind still blew quite strong. I packed everything and left the camp spot by 7:45am.
Our first peak today was Garfield Mountain - a small hump on the map, a tough challenge on the trail. With wet condition, I need to pay extra attention to wet roots and slippery rocks, which were covering the whole trail. There were a few places the I needed to pull or push hard to get on the next big step. At one cliff of about 15ft high, I had to put my whole weight on two fingers that were gripping a crack on the rock. On the top of Garfield Mountain, fogs enveloped everything. So I didn’t stay long there. The going down was always harder than going up. Right after Garfield shelter and camp site, the trail went through a waterfall. The water followed the steps as a river. At this place I set the slowest record: in 15min I hiked 0.1 mile! When I reached AMC Garland Hut, 4.8 miles from the last night camp spot, it’s already 12:45pm, about 5 hours! 
We had a bowl of rice and beans stew for lunch in the Hut. They had no bread left. So I didn’t got the chance to use my orange thru-hiker card on the free backed goods. There was seven miles before we can reach the next huts in our plan. Considering my speed, I was for eager to resume hike. 
The steep climb was for Twin Mountain, about 1200ft higher in 0.8 mile. It was rough going, but nothing I have not seen yet. So I made “good” progress in the afternoon. The trail was also easier on the down section, only a couple places that I need to scramble. It even had a couple miles of flat section! By 6:50pm, we got to the Zealand Falls Hut. There was no good work & stay option in this Hut. And all other paid guests had already finished their dinner. So I hiked another short distance, and camped near the waterfall! For now, listening to the rushing song of the four level falls I am ready to fall to sleep.","A mile south of Garfield Pond

It rained again at night. But by 6 am, the rain stopped, and I started the day with the beautiful waterfalls next to my camp spot. While I was getting ready, I left my phone on a rock and did a lovely time lapse video of the Falls. 
For the first 5 miles, I expected flat trail. Yesterday a south going hiker told us and I got very excited for the information. For many days I had forgotten what a flat trail was. It was truly smooth, at least for a good part of it. One section was over a ledge with nice views on one side. So many blueberries along the the ledge. I ate more than I should, and picked two handfuls for later. I put them in a small plastic container that I used for eating oatmeal in the morning. Even though the 5 miles were not all smooth, many sections had piles of rocks, and too many muddy sections in there too, we still loved it and made good miles in the morning. 
By noontime, we (Brave heart and me have hiked together for a few days now) came to Crawford Notch. AT thru-hiker class 2017 was there to do trail magic! It was one of the best trail magic I had - many choices of healthy food: oranges, apples, watermelon, pasta salad, vegetable chili, kombucha, pancakes, stir fried potatoes with onion and bell peppers, plus the food hiker likes: beer, soda, lots of sweets, etc.,etc... There were even pecans pie and apple pie! I ate so much and rested for a good one hour before continued my hike. 

The trail magic did a wonder to boost my energy. From hard hikes in the past week, I was dragging my feet today morning. Even on flat trail I felt tired and thinking about getting off trail for the rest of the day. But after the good food in my tommy I gained energy back. The climb to Webster Cliff was very steep with going up for 1750ft, mostly in less than a mile. The profile in my guide book draws a vertical line for this part. But I felted strong when climbing up. Once I got to the cliff ledge, the views were excellent. Fogs blowing from right across the rocks. Nearby mountains showed and hidden in the fogs. Short trees added to the mystical atmosphere.From the cliff, it was only 500ft to go up the Mt. Webster Peak. The profile looked nice in the book. But, man, it was a hard rock scrambling one after another. I think there might be more than 10 big rocks/cliffs we need to go through. Every one of them required hand over hand pulling/pushing. By the time we finally stand on top of Mt. Webster, we were exhausted and steaming in cold weather. At that time we realized that we cannot make it to Mizpah Hut before dark. So we started looking for a camp spot. The vegetation on these mountains are so dense, the short flat sections were so damp or muddy, it took us more than an hour to find a small place before Mt. Jackson that could hardly fit two tents. The place in the middle of nowhere would be our home for the rainy night.","Zealand trail junction

As before it rained at night. I slept well listening to the rain drops splashing on my tent. The matted floor of the fallen leaves from hemlock and fir was at least one foot thick, making it the most comfortable mattress in the world. 
I woke in the morning to find a thread of sunlight hitting a corner of the tent, painting it golden. It was a bright day. Partially cloudy with good amount of sunshine. When I was below tree line, the gold sun rays patched the rain washed forest  as if from a fairy tale book. Everything was so new and clean. The forest smelled so nice scented by pines and firs. The trail was still wet and muddy, the rocks still needed to scramble over, my pace was still slow. But I was making progress in a wonderland.
After most of the morning hikes, we were finally above the tree line. The trails got easier there - no big boulder scrambling anymore. And the views were fantastic! White low clouds stayed in valley crevices far below us. Green mountains near by with stunned trees and blue mountains far away layers after layers. Mount Eisenhower, Mount Franklin, and mount Monroe came into view one by one and been passed one by one. The clouds over these mountains were also gradually moved away as the air got warmer near noontime. After a while, the peak of Mount Washington appeared with the communication towers into view. The clouds just loved to play with mount Washington peak. The view of the towers was in and out of the clouds every few minutes. I was excited and felt lucky to see the peak at all. It was said to be visible only 45% of the times.
My hiking plan changed many times as I go. Just because it was really the terrain and weather determine how far I can go for the day. In the past 5 days, only one day I was able to complete the distance as I planned. Same for today. There was no chance for me to reach Madison Hut as I originally planned. After I got to Lakes of Clouds Hut just 1.4 miles before Mount Washington Summit, I discussed with the very friendly caretaker at the hut for 3 different options for tonight. At the end I decided it was the best to stay in this hut and do a short day hike to Mount Washington. It was a nice decision. We put our heavy packs at the hut and carried only a daypack to the summit. I felt flying through the trail without the big backpack. In a little over an hour I reached the summit. By that time we had been in the clouds for at least 40 minutes. There was a few seconds of an opening for the blue sky at the top. I only had time to capture a picture of a tower. There was also a long line of people (tourists) for photos at the summit sign. We waited about 20 minutes for our turn. Then we visited the historical hotel building and visitor center. We got soup and pizza as dinner- real food! After almost 1.5 hours at the summit, it’s time to go back to the hut with about 2.5 miles hike. We took the A.T. down the north side of the summit, then took a side trail back to the hut. Tomorrow we can use the side trail continue our hike without the need to summit again, saving us half mile distance and 1000ft elevation gain.

There were so many guests at the hut. Some were children as today’s a Sunday. They paid about $150 for a bunk bed and breakfast & dinner. For the night, the hut allows thru-hikers to pay $10 to sleep on the dining room floor. There were about 20 hikers took this option. Some hikers choose work for stay option to get free sleeping and free food. But we wanted to get going early tomorrow before the work shift. So we paid that $10. At least I would be dry if it rains again tonight.
The cloudy sky gave us a nice show for sunset. It’s been a long time since I seen a nice sunset for this was the first time I stayed above tree line on A.T..","Mt. Jackson

Rocks, rocks, and more rocks! Today is rocks day all day - rough, gnarled, pointed rocks for almost 8 miles. Plus fogs and high wind on the open rocky trails above the tree line. I had to be very focused with footing, like solving puzzles, every move of my feet needed to find the possible move to spot of the next movement. The strong wind, especially gusty wind made aiming my trekking poles uncertain and made myself hard to keep my balance. A few times the gusting wind threw me off balance and I banged my arm against large rocks next to me. One time I needed to step on a big rock, the gusty wind lifted me and my backpack on to the rock effortlessly. Most of the times the wind and the rocks just kept me in a drunk state and prevented me from going fast. A lot of NoBos past me as they seam to defy the gravity and fly on the rocks. The estimated 4.5 hours hike in morning turned out to be 6 hours!

The cool thing was the landscape, in fog or under the Sun. The fog moved very fast. I started just under the edge of it. I could see mountains have tops hidden in the clouds, but the bottom still sunny. It was like a ship slicing through ocean. When I was completely in the clouds, it was dark and grimy. The wind blew brown colored grasses in a sea of black rocks covered with yellow green lichen, forming the waves of motion. The vast emptiness of the dark rocky sea was very powerful. I felt humble and peace in it, never fear.I ate black beans soup with a thick piece of bread and a large piece of lemon bar when I finally reached Madison Springs Hut after 6 exhausting hours for lunch.
The 3 miles after Madison Spring Hut was still filled with rocks. I never worried about climbing the rocks in uphill sections, even when the trail was steep as it was up to mount Madison. But going down slowed me to a snail pace. That 3 miles took me 4hours. So instead of reaching Pinkman Notch, I camped next to a beautiful rushing river for the night 4 miles before the Notch. Another day that was for short from the planned destination. The sound of the cascade and rustling leaves will rock me into sound sleep tonight.","Lakes of the Clouds Hut

The campsite I stayed last night was very nice. Dry and breezy. When I woke up in the morning, or the soggy items from last few nights of rain had dried.It was a beautiful clear day. The sunlight hit through trees around 6am. A light patched forest morning  always cheers me up, and I think it is the most wonderful thing to see.
I hiked about 4 hours in the morning to reach Pinkman Notch. The trails at lower elevation was much easier to walk on. After I came into Vermont and New Hampshire I noticed how silent the forest was. In the southern states, there were so many birds chirping throughout the day, even many hours in the night. Squirrels, chipmunks, snakes were in sight many a day. But they were hardly here. This morning I met two college students doing research on squirrels. They confirmed that this year, they have not seen many squirrels either. Their theory was the squirrel population changes every year, a year of boom usually followed by a year of doom. And this has been the doom year. I hope their theory is right. I hope the wildlife in this forest just going through their normal cycles, not disappear for good. A silent forest is not a comfortable forest.
I reached Pinkman Notch AMC visitor center before 10am. Plugged my charger for the phone battery, did a much needed hot shower, packed food resupplies for the next 3 days, and ate a nice lunch of real food. All within less than 2hours. By 11:45am, I was on the trail again to take the Wildcats.

The mountain on the north of Pinkman Notch is Wildcats - D,C,B,A, four peaks. Peak D is a ski mountain with a gondola. The trail of Wildcats Ridge up to Peak D had been the most challenging one (technically) with great cliffs and huge vertical boulders. In two miles the trail raises more than 2000ft. At least three boulders of 20-40feet are exposed, needed mountain goat skills and camel’s endurance to climb up. I was so glad that I don’t need to go down on this trail. It was pretty terrifying if I need to go down there. I had my full sympathy and respect to the SoBos who have to do this in the down direction.The gondola runs out in summer to bring visitors up the hill for a view. But there was no other services on the top. So after rested a few minutes, I continued to hike the rest of the Wildcats, each has a few wild spots for a wild and exhausting climb. By 5:30pm, I reached peak A and in another hour, after endless stairs, down 1100ft, I finally reached Carter Notch Hut, sitting by two pretty little ponds -one half covered with water lilies with yellow flowers and cool looking grasses, the other littered with large brown rocks, more as an alpine lake. I happily found that the hut still have room for more quests. So I checked in, and had a terrific dinner right away. The lentil soup, bread and butter, vegetables, Mexican lasagna and lemon cake tasted to wonderful. It’s a nice treat for me after a week of hard climbs in the Whites.","Campsite on Madison Gulf trail

Carter Notch Hut Croo were awesome. They prepared tasty breakfast, performed a funny yoga to educate guests folding blankets, packing out all trash, leaving tips, and entertained kids. I loved my hut stay, one more satisfied customer.
The hike to Carter Dome and the rest of Carter mountains were steep but not too difficult. But the down hill part from North Carter Mountain to the Imp campsite required lots of butt sliding, and really slow me down. Then in the afternoon, there was one last climb to Moriah Mountain. The rain started from there, too. It was light rain at the uphill section, easy to manage. On top of the Moriah Mountain, the rain stopped for a few minutes. I was presented with flowing white clouds among the hills below and valley far. That was a fantastic sight. Then the rain picked up power. I had almost down pour going down the mountain. Soon my clothes were soaked inside and outside. I didn’t wear my poncho for it was long and easy to trip over on this steep trail. I used poncho as pack cover, wearing rain jacket on top. This setting was perfect in light rain. But useless in heavy rain. I felt cold, worried about hypothermia, eager to find a spot to camp. I force myself to rest, drank water and ate as much trail mix as possible to keep me hydrated and stay warm. After almost two hours by a stream, I finally got a spot good enough to set up tent. Soon I changed into dry clothes, cooked and ate dinner, happily to stay warm and cozy in my tent. Tomorrow I will be getting into Gorham before noon.

A resupply day in Gorham with only 4.2 miles hike in the morning. I was lucky that the rain stopped before I woke up the early morning allowed me the luxury of making breakfast and packing in dry condition. Of course everything I packed was wet. But I was so happy to take the trail down more than 2100 ft to road 2.  The trail was slippery and steep for the first 2 miles, but nothing required Spider-Man’s action. The last 2 miles were very smooth and gentle. I really enjoyed it. It followed Rattle River all along. There were many beautiful swimming holes and large flat rock slabs in the river. It would be a wonderful place to take a weekend trip relaxing along the river. 

There was a 300miles mark on trail this morning, pronouncing the left over distance to Katahdin is only 300 miles! It made me excited.I checked into a Royalty Inn in Gorham, a small town stretched long along road 2. Finding a ride to do resupplies was not very easy. With some luck, a TriCounty transit driver went out of his way taking me to Walmart, and made sure the local bus driver picking me up when he runs the last round from the store. The hotel people were also very nice. They allowed me to use their laundry room and club center for shower before the check in time. They also got my room ready more than an hour before their normal check in time. All was well, and I’m ready to go for the next leg of A.T..","Camp above Rattle River

I got back on trail at 10am. The mild temperature and low humidity made this a perfect hiking day. At the trail head, I run into Gumby doing a trail magic there. I have not seen him since mid May! It turned out that he didn’t like the heat in Virginia and came back home that is only 10 minutes drive from here. He’s very happy to see me again. A lover of photography himself, that he always talked about cameras on trail with me. It’s great to see him again. 

This was the last full day of hiking in NH. The trail was a lot easier than any section in the past week. It felt like NH wants to leave a gentle impression on hikers with the last day. Just before Trident Pass, the sticks made 1900 miles marker made me proud and excited. Yeah, I had walked 1900 miles so far. A long way indeed. The trail passed several ponds today. At the outlet area of Dream Lake, there were lots of water plants with fuzzy dried flower heads. They looked amazing against the back lit of the Sun, too cute to pass them quickly without admiring them. That’s the thing that can make you forget of time.A little after 7pm, I arrived at Gentian Pond shelter for the night. The opening side of the shelter has views of mountains and sky full of bright stars. One object stranded out very bright, too low for a planet, too high for an airplane. I guessed it could be the space station.","Gorham, NH

The last mountain in New Hampshire is Mnt. Success. It was not a very difficult one, but not an easy one either. There was rock scrambling at several locations and as many as four false Summits. I walked to the Summit in heavy fog. Kind of cool scenery. I took a picture in heavy fog, trying to capture the satisfaction feeling of reaching mnt. Success!At noon time I walked into the NH/Maine state line and had a nice long lunch break there. One last state to go! 
Maine’s trail was as hard as New Hampshire! In the first 5 miles today I have encountered many rock scrambling locations, and many metal bars, ladders and boards. Some of the later are in really wired angles. I only made a little less than 10 miles today, due to slow moving. Brave Heart said I was a spidy (spider) woman as I went up the large boulders easily. But I was an injured turtle when I went down. Very slow and unsure. There were same notches cut into rocks to help hikers with better foot hold. But they were far and sparse.

The forest had more wildlife today. In morning before entering Maine, a chipmunk was on trail eating blueberries. In late afternoon, in Maine, a pheasant was walking on trail and flying around. It even sat on a tree branch two feet from me, frozen in there for more than 5 minutes. I also heard lots of calls like wild turkeys in late morning. Not sure what were them.With 277 miles to go in Maine, some say it would take a month, some wanted to finish in two weeks. I hope for 23 days. It is a tough state for the A.T..","Gentian Pond shelter

I updated the slowest record today! Going through Mahoosuc Notch, with distance of 1.1 miles, I spent 4 hours and 10 minutes. That was 3.8 hours per hour! Instead of just walking, I used lots of my upper body strength to crawl, push and pull. I went under, over, and around big boulders, many times passed my backpack and trekking poles to Brave Heart to hull to the other side of the boulders. Without her as a team, it would have taken me much longer to go through that difficult Notch. It was deep and cold in the Notch. I saw snow and ice in some crevices down there. The sunlight might never hit those spots. Many rocks were wet and slippery. I was thankful that it was a very nice sunny day today. There were many beautiful looking wild star flowers in the area where it had sunlight, the flowers that I saw they were blooming in the cool spring of mid April. Some hikers call the Notch Jungle Gym. Many of the young hikers passed me quickly. On one slippery big rock, I was trying to sit down and slide off it. But I slipped while squatting on it, hit my tailbone. So for the rest of the day I had to hike with pain in my tailbone. That included most of the Notch and the following steep climb up to Mahoosuc Arm. People I met on the trail coming from the North all said Mahoosuc Arm was really bad. But I did not feel it was any more difficult than any section in the Whites. It was definitely much easier than the Notch. For 1.6 miles going from the end of the Notch to the summit of the Arm, it only took me 1 hour 40 min. 
Once I got up to the Summit, the view was wonderful and dragonflies came to visit me while I sat down on the warm rock bathing in the Sun for a break. It was wonderful to have the most difficult part of A.T. behind me. I also took some Advil to reduce the pain caused by hiking, crawling, pushing, pulling and slipping. I think I will be on Advil for a few days. Shortly after the summit there was a field of bog. The trail has many of bog sections, and they are lined with wooden planks. One of the plank waved sideways when I walked on it. I lost my balance with one foot stepped in the mud. It was a bottomless mud, quick sand! In a blink of eye, my knee went under. I still felt emptiness under my foot. Quickly I rolled over to the side of grasses to pull my leg out. Luckily the grassy area was solid. I was safe, but got really muddy pants and boot. 
In the early days on A.T. I only heard the Whites are tough. When I was in the Whites, I started to hear South Maine was tough. Now I really think South Maine is tougher than the Whites. For today, I only made 5.1 miles with 9 hours of hiking. When I see the first shelter after Mahoosuc Arm, I was ready to stop for the night. 
I cooked and sat at a bench next to Speck Pond. The warmth of sun dried my pants and socks. The water in the pond was sparkling under sunlight. All perfectly beautiful and peaceful. The hardest was in the past. I am looking forward to start the rest of the journey tomorrow.","Full Goose Shelter

Got on to trail by 7:25am. It was nice walkable trail for a while till I got about 500 vertical feet from the Old Speck Summit. It then turned into an easy rock climbing route with exposure on a granite dome. The views was great on the route up. Low clouds filled the valley like a layer of pure white liquid. A sea of green hills spread out from my feet, forming layers after layers of mountain waves - green in front of the blue, blue in front of the gray. A few hikers in front of me looked like little ants crawling hand over hand on the exposed slope. From a far, it looked scary and risky. But I loved this type of climbing. I got excited every time doing this, as I did a few times in Yosemite NP. The dry rock gripped very well under my hiking boots. Not even slightly slippery. My hands touched the cracks and notches on the rocks too. I felt at home with the rocks. 

Three and half hours later, I reached a nice creek and filled my water bottle with sweet clear stream water. By noon time I reached road 26 and had a lunch break there. Someone left cherry tomatoes and a bottle of grapefruit juice at the parking lot. I assumed it was for trail magic and had some of each as part of my lunch.After lunch, the climb to Baldpate mountain was over 2200ft. But the trail was in excellent condition with well constructed stairs. Even though it took time to reach the west peak, it was a smooth sailing. From the west peak, I can see the bald east peak, not far from me, with all the exposed dome shaped granite. I felt alive again and enjoyed every step on the exposed rocks. A wind farm was in the view as I walked. The blueberries were everywhere on these peaks, bearing large ripe sweet berries every where my eyes can see. Right after the east peak, there was the Little Baldpate mountain, with exposed top, only a little lower. From the east peak, this little bald looked like a cream colored chess play area sitting in a green carpeted field, a chess board played by giants. I enjoyed all three baldpate peaks. They were my favorite things on A.T..
Getting down from Little Baldpate mountain was a little nerve racking as the slope was steep and not many good things to hold on. The going was slow from there. By the time I reached Frye Notch Lean-to it was almost 6:30pm. Another day that was short of planned distance. It has been really hard to plan for any day since the Whites. All depends on the trail conditions.","Speck Pond shelter

After I emailed my friends that I have hiked into the last state Maine, a lot of support messages came in. I was so blessed and moved by their encouragement and support. Hey, all of you, thanks so much! I really cannot do this without you!
Finally Maine showed its gentler side, or took a mercy on me. Today’s trail was so lovely: mellow rolling hills, no rock scrambling. Some sections even have lots of soft spongy dirt, smooth as dirt can be. Plus the low humidity cool air for most of the day. I could not ask for better condition. The easy strolling in the morning made me sing along with a Taiwanese campus song that was popular in the 80s after I saw a few fall colored leaves in the otherwise green forest. It translated as this: “I walk on the side of fields. The fields are filled with fall color. ... How big is the blue sky, floating a few white clouds. Blue mountains have no boredom, flowing clear brooks in them...”. These mellow trails gave me a feeling of wellbeing, a feeling of making good progress towards my (goal) destination. I was not as helplessly weak as a couple of days ago when the hard trail beat me as bad as it could. I could set up my goal for the day and got it accomplished. I made 14.6 miles today, back to my normal range. Two thing on trail had my attention today. In a section about half mile long, it was full of moose droppings. I named it moose privy section. The droppings were dry and old. Moose was nowhere to be found. Where could they hide? Another thing was the lovely neon green moss under trees. Uniformly carpeted the forest floor, not leaving any tiny area uncovered, dry to the touch, spongy when pressed. It gave me the desire to walk on them bear feet.
I have to admit that the last hill Moody Mountain was no joke. Somehow I miss read it and thought the climb would only be 500ft. It was actually about 1500ft, and very steep. It was also in the late afternoon, when my body was already tired. So  I dragged and dragged, kept wondering why this 500ft was so hard and so long. One section of the trail was a mess. Trees were in every direction, alive and dead. Rocks were in every form but flat, dirt was dusty and loose. It looked like bombs were dropped here not long ago. My hiking buddy commented the metal bars were nice to have. But I looked at her blankly: “Bars, what bars? I did not see any.” 
By 6pm, I reached Black Brook campsite ready to catch the morning shuttle from a near by road  to a hostel tomorrow for resupplies of the next five days of food and Advil! The campsite looked very cozy with warm late afternoon sun next to the quiet brook in a young hemlock grove with straight trunks.","Frye Notch lean-to

I got to Human Nature Hostel for a zero day, relaxing and getting resupplies. It didn’t have to be a full day off. But the weather was expected to be bad for the night and taking a day off after hard sections was so appealing. I am glad for this decision now. As I am writing the journal, the outside just pouring with cold water from sky.

The hostel was very nice. Unique design of a dome shaped three level house with so much detailed craftsmanship inside, from the restored cool stove, customized counter tops and tables, posts and stairs with sailers rope railings, to hand made pouches and necklaces. Very artistic and in great taste. Even the pancakes had “AT” symbol to decorate. The owner has plans to make here a full service resort.

I got a late start since the hostel shuttle only reached the trail head a little before 9:00am. One SoBo hiker said Old Blue Mountain was the toughest for him in Southern Maine. I found it was quite manageable. The climb was 2200ft. But I was well fed in the hostel with gigantic pancake, blueberry source, maple syrup, butter, biscuit, meat gravy and sausage in the morning. So the hike to the top of Old Blue was pretty easy. Once I got to the top, I was above the clouds and had a great open space with flat rocks to sit on. I took a snack break there.
By lunch time I came to a view point before Bemis Mountain. There is even a bench to sit on for the lunch break. That was a rare find.
The plan for today was to hike to road 17 and camp near the overlook point to watch sunset. However from Bemis Mountain the trail gets a little more challenging. There were lots of muddy pockets which needed extra attention. Then the down hill got worse with long slippery slopes had nowhere to hold on. These trail conditions slowed down my pace considerably. At the end by 7pm, I was tired, didn’t want to climb the 700ft on to road 17, but ready to camp by a nice creek, one mile short of my planned destination.","Human Nature Hostel

The first thing in today morning wa to climb up 700 ft to reach the Height of Land scenic overlook. Last night I cannot reach the point to watch sunset. This morning the overlook was gorgeous. It lined with lots of flowers. The lake of Mooselookmeguntic sprawls under the overlook to the right, the hills I hiked yesterday stands on the left. The sky was filled with cotton ball clouds. The morning sun moved the shadows of hills gradually to reveal the green of the trees and bright yellow and pink of the flowers. Cool winds brought the freshness of the forest to fill up the air. A sight of paradise might be similar to what I saw this morningFor the whole day I had fairly mellow trails today. It was a great break for my tired body. It was not the type of smooth trail where one can walk fast and worry free. There were still many bog/muddy pockets to watch out, still many gnarled roots that could cause one to fall unexpectedly. But by Maine standard this was as good of a trail as it could got. Especially the last mile before reaching road 4. For a while it was very smooth and very pleasant to walk on. I even purposely slowed my pace just for enjoying it longer. By the end of my hike, I had done almost 14 miles in 10 hours including all the resting times. Knowing there will be another 5 days of tough mountains ahead of me, I was very happy with today’s progress.
I met a group of trail builders. They were setting rocks for a water runway on trail. They told me it would take them 2-3 days to build a  ten feet length of stairs for trail. I was shocked to hear it would take that long for just 10ft. That’s tons of work to make the trail safer and “easier” since I noticed how many spots on the trail would be better for hikers with heavy packs if there were stairs. 
For the night I checked into Hiker Hut with tenting. They provided warm outdoor shower by the creek ( or sandy river), hot dinner and tea, solar powered charger for my phone. The property is off grid, and well kept with beautiful flowers, campfire ring and picnic table. I loved their outdoor shower. The water was from the creek. You use a bucket to fetch water and put into a container. A tankless water heater heats the water when it is turned on. Then you’d get warm water for shower. The dense trees along the road blocked view from the passing cars on the road when you take the shower.","Bemis Stream

I left Hiker Hut at 7am. The owner Steve filled me with hot tea, eggs & cheese sandwich, and a sweet donut. I had full of energy to climb the Saddleback Mountain - a very challenging one according to many hikers I had talked with. It turned out not as difficult as people said. Even though the route was steep and climb was high, nothing was hand over hand. I ended up to the Summit by 11:15am, still felt energetic. The weather on the exposed ridge was another beast. The wind blew so strong and so cold. I kept moving to keep me from freezing. There was a rock formed circle for wind blocking. I went there for the lunch break, put my fleece jacket and down jacket on, as well as gloves. There had been lots of blueberries on the ridge above tree line. I gather some berries and made blueberry trail mix wraps with tortilla wrappers. They were so delicious. I finished 3 for my lunch.

The next peak was the Horn. It’s lower than Saddleback mountain but I expected getting down from it could be hard as it’s profile indicated. Unfortunately it was true. Getting down from the Horn took a pretty long time than I liked due to larger rocks. Also between Saddleback and the Horn, there were many mud pits. While trying to avoid getting my shoes wet at one of them, I lost my balance and fell backwards into the watery mud! As the result my clothes were dripping wet as well as my boots and socks. In the howling wind, I had to change into dry socks, t-shirt and pants - not a pleasant thing to do. Good thing that I had all my stuff in waterproof bags, so I had enough dry clothes to keep me warm and comfortable before getting to town in two days.After tackled the Horn, there was still a Saddleback Junior mountain to go over before the day. Someone told us it was all stairs going up to this peak. It was not. The last mile had lots of gnarled rocks. Going down from it was also slow going since I need to figure out where to put my feet down. By 5:20pm I reached a shelter. Still had energy I pushed for another 2 hours to the river down almost 2000ft. I was glad to complete this section today and saved the time tomorrow.","Hiker Hut

Click can only click her iPhone today. The camera has been dead since yesterday late afternoon when it was accidentally submerged partially in water/mud. I thought it would be ok since it was water proof. I was wrong. Because the camera was more than 6 years old, som e seals already not working properly. So when I get to town, the camera will be sent to home. But in just a few days, my husband will be re-join me for the final walk on A.T.. I am sure we’ll have a good big camera by then. 
Today I was easy sailing. Going up to lone mountain and sprawling mountain in the morning took some effort but without any difficulty. Even in the afternoon after 3pm I did much better when going up to the two peaks of Crocker Mountain. 
After I was going down from Crocker, two sighs arranged with stones were there, pronouncing mile 2000! I was very excited to see them! Earlier there was a sign telling us that there was only 200 miles left to Kathadin! How cool is that! 
Near the last 2000 miles sigh, there were some flat spots in the woods. Because the sun would be setting soon, I wanted to investigate tenting place. Big mistake! Looking down most of time, I didn’t notice there was a huge wasp nest hung over my head. In a buzz sound, a wasp followed me and later stung my right ear. Immediately, I reached my Benadryl. Hopefully the swallow would not be too bad and no other medicine would be required.","Old rail bed

I marched on the trail this morning in the cold rain to road 27. The wet shiny leaves were not all green anymore. Some had turned yellow, orange, and even red. The wind blew, carried colorful leaves swirling down beside my feet. Each rain drop felt colder than the one before. At road 27, the chill drifted deeper into my bones after I stopped moving.

Biglow mountain after the rain is slippery. So I was happy to participate in slackpacking today. Total 16.7 miles. The hostel shuttle brought us to the North end of the mountain and we started hiking backwards towards road 27 by 7:30am. 

The fog was thick and full of water. I could feel the drizzle in the fog. But it was very pleasant drizzle, it kept me cool without feeling wet. There were many large rocks on the side of trail. Many of them had green moss grew on then. Making them so green and soft to touch. Most of the rocks just lay on the side of the trail. They don’t block any traffics on the trail.At near noon , l reached the Avery peak of mountain Biglow. As I sat down for a lunch break, the clouds started to drifting apart. I surprised to see there were lakes behind the clouds curtain. It was a paradise slowly revealed it beauty. It was a perfect place to have lunch break at a perfect time.

The excellent views accompanied me through the multiple peaks on Biglow Mountain range. In the afternoon, the trail dipped into green forest again with fresh scent of Christmas trees and green moss on giant boulders.We managed to finish the hike by 7pm before it’s dark.

So I decided to hike only in the morning to the first shelter 6.3 miles away and stay there to wait out the storm. I arrived at the shelter by 11:30am. It rained hard for about couple of hours. Then strong winds just blew the dark stormy clouds away from our area. I felt like being chickened out this time since I really didn’t want to get my boots soaked wet. They just dried last night after they were wet in Monday rainy day. After 6:00pm all of a sudden a  hiker said That she heard thunders. In couple of minutes the storm hit our shelter hard with pouring rain. You never know when it could hit you, really!
Now I had passed the most difficult part of the trail. Today and tomorrow are ‘easy’ sections. Saying it easy is the expectation from looking at its flatter profile in the guide book. But I can only find out the truth after I finished this section. There will be lots of roots and bog areas on the trail which could be hard when they are wet. On the trail I noticed more leaves changed colors or fallen. Each day the Nature is trying to give me hint about the autumn coming up. Keeping warm will be my concern from now on.","Stratton hostel

I fell to sleep before the rain stopped. Sometime in the night the wind started to howling loudly. I opened my eyes but couldn’t see anything. It was pitch black. I couldn’t see even my hand in front of my eyes. The backpacks hanging in the entrance of the shelter showed nothing was there. The blackest black I had experienced. The whole world was just wind and tree branches dropping on to the roof of this tiny shelter. I felt the cold air on my head. I buried my face deeper and deeper into the soft warm cozy envelope of my quilt, dozing in and off sleep through the windy night.
When the daylight broke before 6am, the wind was still vey strong. I was glad that the wind had dried everything. In the chilly morning I got dressed quickly, had a warm breakfast of oatmeal and started hiking by 7am.
Along the edge of the pond, the wind was very strong. It made the pond into a little ocean with waves pounding and splashing the rocky shore. As soon as I turned away from the pond, the wind had disappeared all of a sudden. The forest became so peaceful that I heard bird chips but nothing else. 
It was a fast march to complete the 13.7 miles before the man powered canon stopping the official A.T. ferry to cross the Kennebec River at 2 pm. For almost 7 hours I walked and walked fast on unstable single boards, on wide boards, on rocks and over mud. I only took the heavy backpack off my aching shoulder once for 7 minutes. I reached the ferry crossing location 20 minutes before the official closing time. Brave Heart was waiting for me about 10 minutes. She was very happy to see me made it. And we ride the boat to the other side of the town. Till then, I felt relaxed and relieved.
We walked a short distance to Caratunk Hikers B&B. In there I learned that they off a slackpacking for about 5 miles to the north for free if I stay in the hostel. After a milkshake and pulled pork sandwich, I was on trail again to slackpacking the 5.3 miles. It was a pleasant walk. No big ups and downs. And in the cool forest, I didn’t feel any humidity nor hot air. A perfect hiking condition. Before 6pm the hike was finished and we were shuttled to a local restaurant for dinner.","Stratton hostel

Instead of having a tasty breakfast in Caratunk House B&B, I opted out to have an early start hiking. Before 7am, I was on the trail to climb the mountain. Halfway up, I stopped for a break to cook my oatmeal breakfast. I got more food than I can finish before entering next town Monson-my last full resupply location on A.T..
The going was smooth. Even though I was tired from yesterday’s big miles, I was still going on a good 1.5 miles per hour pace. There have been so many variety of mushrooms today. I found a perfect huge orange red one with yellow speckles on it. The one came from Alice in the wonderland mushroom. The yellow speckles looked like sesame seeds on a bun. So the mushroom looked like the top of a giant cheese burger. There were also so many different shapes and colors of mushrooms, some were really cute, some were impressively huge. I also saw three grouse today morning. One of them was a chick. The mom was trying to protect her child by acting stupidly in front of human. It felt like I can catch her with my barehand. In the evening I saw a few moose tracks in the mud. But still I Jane not seen a moose yet.
In the afternoon I climbed on top of Moxie Bald mountain. There were many glacier polished rocks. The open summit was long with great views in every direction. There were also lots of tasty blueberries on the summit.
Back down from the summit past Bald Mountain, there were many rocks lined perfectly on trail to form a rock hoping path. This path made walking on trail so easy. Thanks a lot to all the trail builders.","Boise Cascade logging road

As usual I started hiking at about 7:00am. I want to reach Monson, ME - the last resupply location on A.T. As soon as possible. My husband should have arrived in town yesterday, but I haven’t been able to contact him yet. There were small ups and downs on the trail. Nothing was really hard. However after more than five months of walking day in and day out, my body was tired. Plus it is approaching the end of the journey, psychologically my body gave out signals to slow down. It’s now more than ever for me to focus on my goal and mentally reminded myself to hold on and be tough.
On this section of the trail there were even more interesting mushrooms as yesterday. Some were mother/baby pairs, some were as round as pearls, some were upside down bowline pins, some were silvery gray, and some were orange red. They were everywhere in abundance. I noticed big moose footprints, still no sight of the shy giant.

There were two places that hikers need to ford river where the water level could be high. The west and east branches of Piscataquis River. Some hikers left comments about the water could be as high as their waist. Those comments made us nervous. I crossed the river with water level below my calf. The water was cool but not too cold. I actually found it was quite nice to have my feet soaked for a while.When I reached the shore of the east beach, someone was calling me from across the river. I looked up, on the bank of the river my husband was smiling and waiving at me! It turned out that he had arrived in town yesterday afternoon. This morning he has walked 6 miles to meet me. It was such a happy surprise to me! With him leading the way we walked together back to town. When we were still about a mile away from the town, a red pickup stopped next to us. They offered to gave us a ride to Shaw’s hostel. We were gladly accepted their offer, climbed up the back of the pickup, sat nervously with our packs on the borderless pickup.

We got a late start for the trail since there were many hikers needed shuttle to trail head. We got the second shuttle and only started walk at about 9am. So I have been expecting that we will not meet our planned destination at 15.1 miles away. Even with a relatively moderate trail, doing 15 miles with a heavy pack full of 7 days of resupplies would not be easy, especially for my husband as his 1st day. At the end we hiked about 12.2 miles and stealth camped about a mile and half shy from Wilber Brook.

This section was not as easy as yesterday’s trail. But still quite manageable. Nothing was technical. I did slip once on a slanted rock and sat on my left butt. It was not hurting badly. Having my husband here with me had some advantages. When the trail got difficult descent he would lend me his hand to help me get off big steps. When there was difficult ascent, he would give me one extra push upward. But later he got tired and had to walk slowly. He was not able to keep up with me since I have got used to walk 11-12 hours everyday for the last five months.
On trail I still see lots of nice mushrooms, I also saw a cute little waterfall.  Some day hikers crossed the river above waterfalls area. I would never do it. Always do water crossing below a waterfall. Any misstep could be fatal. I have heard too many accidents in Yosemite just above Vernal Falls in the emerald pool. So we followed the A.T. Blast and crossed the river about half mile below the falls on Little Wilson river. Our big challenge of today was ford the big Wilson River. The water current was fast. The water level was up to my thighs. When I crossed the river and looked down to the water, I felt dizzy. The current made me less stable even with my hiking pole. It took a while for me to get crossed. My pants also got very wet. Fortunately it was a quick dry pants and when I started to hike it dried completely within 2 hours.
Tomorrow we’ll get an earlier start and we’ll have another river crossing. There will be more climbing of mountains. So sweat dreams for now at 9:15pm. The half moon shone above my tent.","Shaw’s

We got going before 7am. It was easy trails for a couple of miles. We saw many nice campsites along the Long Pond stream. Much better than the site we stayed in a hurry last night. Well, only if we could have made this far! In two hours we crossed the stream. I changed into my sandals for a wet crossing. Current was strong but I managed to stay on high rocks for the most part. So it was easier than yesterday’s Wilson River crossing. My husband managed to rock hoping cross this stream and kept his boots dry. 
After that the climbing began. We climbed about 2100ft to Barren Mountain. Had a relaxed lunch near the old fire lookout tower. I even made mushroom soup for my husband who sweated a lot and lost lots of salt. At that time I already realized that we may not get to any water source till late afternoon. So I didn’t drink much water until a few hours later that we saw a small stream with good water. This water source and another usable one 0.4 mile later were not in my guide book. 
The trail condition changed after the stream crossing to something rougher. Especially going down hill and cross many mud pockets. We were again slower than I expected. Now it looks like we’ll need 4 days to finish the 43 miles in the wilderness instead of planned 3 days. By 6 pm we made it to the West Chairback Pond Falls, 1.7 miles away from the Chairback mountain lean-to. Total we did only 12.1 miles. After crossed West Chairback Pond Falls, we saw a nice stealth camp site, enough for our tent and Braveheart’s tent. So we are settled for the night. The rushing sound of the waterfalls will rock us into sweet dreams.","A mile before Wilber Brook

This was a lovely day for hiking. From early morning the birds sang happily, the sunlight lit up the forest before 7am, light cool breezes kept me alert and got going fast to keep me warm. We got Columbus mountain under our feet within an hour. The views from the mountain top was awesome. There was not much clouds in the blue clear sky. It’s hard to believe the forecast of rain for tonight and tomorrow. It felt like there would be no trouble at all for eternity, well at least until we’d finish our hike on Katahdin.
Many people warned us about the difficulty going down the north side of Chairback Mountain - which was the next one we passed. Except a short section of only less than a hundred feet with manageable rock scrambling, the mountain was actually quite easy to go up and down. As Braveheart said “for us pros this is nothing”! Ha, I felt the same.
We were still going at a slow pace and only did 11.6 miles today, before we could do any of the four peaks in next 6 miles - the last major obstacle before Katahdin in the 100 miles wilderness. One thing was that we didn’t want to rush, another thing was that my husband still not feeling well. He had lost appetite and threw food out after he ate. So for us to do 11 to 12 miles a day was already a lot to ask for him. I think all the around world traveling for him in last week had put his biological clock in a confusing state. He really just needed more time to adjust. I have been making warm soup for him at lunch time. Hopefully with time and better rest he could recover soon.
I took more pictures of lovely mushrooms today. They were not stopping to amaze me with their various shapes, colors and variety. In addition I saw a nice little frog in a stream. It has a green head and upper body, but brown lower body. Shiny and slimy. It tried very hard to hop away from me. Poor little creature got scared of me. Then in a dark forest of hemlocks, two jumpy squirrels, one was riding on top of another, looped around a big tree trunk. They noticed me coming, stopped for a second, separated, and jumped around for a while. I tried to capture them in the photos, mostly just got blurry images. They were so fast! Later when I filter water at a creek near my campsite, another squirrel skirted across boulders littered in the steam. The gaps between the boulders were much longer than its body length. But it crossed them so fast and easily like nothing in between. I was so jealous of the squirrels for I am very scared to rock hopping in bog and water.
The rain actually did started at 7pm just as the forecast said. In my cozy tent, I hope everything would be kept dry. Hope the rain would stop by next morning so that we could have a good day to move on.","West Chairback Pond

The rain lasted for the whole night and morning. It was the type of rain that makes people want to stay at home, lazy out the whole day with a cup of hot coffee/tea/chocolate or all of them, and an open book at one’s lap. I would also want to sit by a window, looking to the outside from time to time, watching the rain water sprinkle on the window glass and be happy that I would not need to go outside. But today was not that day. We started packing after 8am and were on trail before 9am. The rain had already delayed our start time by almost 2 hours. We need to get moving and get going, or we would not have enough food to reach the next store at Abol Bridge campground 63 miles away. In couple of hours my boots and socks were soaking wet. My pants and underwear were also wet even though I had both rain jacket and poncho on. That’s just the way it was. My husband got newer gears with waterproof books and heavy duty gaiters. So he’s able to keep his feet dry.
We have four peaks to pass for the day, the last major obstacles before Mount Katahdin: Gulf Hagas, West Peak, Hay Mountain, and White Cap Mountain. All of the peaks had moderate grade and relatively easy trails. We reached Hay Mountain when there was a few minutes of break in the weather, long enough to allow us a peaceful lunch break. But only a few minutes of the lovely sunshine. When we reached the White Cap - highest of the four, there was a brief breakthrough of the dark gray clouds that gave us a fantastic view of sunny valley and lakes down there. A range of mountains were also appeared behind the opening and closing curtain of the flying clouds, layers of mountains, all looked too low for Katahdin. We were told that Katahdin can be seen for the first time for NOBOs on this peak. I was disappointed for not be able to see it or identify it. The break was too short for me to check my topo map. In just a few minutes, the dark gray clouds rolled in, not only all mirage of mountains and lakes disappeared, but also heavy rain rushed in and whipped us with threads of wind and water. Rain drops as heavy as soybeans patted our body. Braveheart wanted to dry her tent in the wind before the rain wrapped us tight. Her tent was wetter than before. I tried to pull my poncho over me. In the two minutes that I struggled for that with the helping hands of my husband, the water already soaked my whole pants, boots and socks. I had to walk with a bucket of water slushing in my boots for the next hour. On the darkened stormy mountain top  my only thought was to get down below the tree line as quickly as possible, for it was the worst place to be if the storm was a thunderstorm.
No matter how tough it was today, I was still very happy to have a brief moment of seeing the miraculous views of the mountains and valley in the sunlit drifting clouds. Also in the rain the forest was more lovely. All colors were enhanced by the wet condition. The red was redder, the green greener, and the yellow yellower. On the ridge where the trees thinned, many branches of ferns had turned into cinnamon and yellow colors. They had nice contrast with neighboring green ferns, making great patterns as abstract painting. And all red berries were so bright among the green leaves. 
After 3:30pm, we were done with the mountains! Our last 4 miles were “all rolling hills” as we were told to expect in Northern Maine. Though the elevation was lowed, trails were flatter, there were still mud pockets to be avoid at all cost, and slippery roots to watch out. We do expecting hiking more distance each day in the next three days, even though we’ll have to do it in the rain for some days. It was a relief to put big mountains behind us, and only to worry about Mount Katahdin when we get there.","Carl Newhall lean-to

What a difference an easy trail can make! Today we only got a small hill to climb in the morning with the rest contained either gentle down hill or flat, especially smoothly flat sections without much roots nor rocks. Finally we got what people had told us weeks ago: the rolling hills of Maine. Easily we walked 16 miles to reach our campsite at about 5pm. Even my husband, who’s still suffering from food digestion problem without much intake of meals, said today was finally an enjoyable day. People says “no pain, no rain, no Maine” about A.T. thru-hiking. My husband tripped on roots and rocks today, fell and hurt his hand. Yesterday he got poured by raging rain on top of White Cap. Therefore he experienced the full glory of A.T.. We joked that he’s now part of us, the A.T. thru-hikers. 
We crossed so many creeks and passed many ponds today. Many of the nice stream flowing with cool clear water were not listed in the guide books. We loved these water sources. For many water sources near ponds and brooks that are in my guide book, we felt they were not as clean as the stream water. But maybe they are more reliable in drier years. 
Our campsite was at the west side of Lower Jo-Mary Lake. Also named as Turkey Tail Lake on my topo map. We set our tent near the tip of a little peninsula. It only took 2 minutes walking from the west facing shore to the east facing shore of the peninsula. But at sunset time it was very beautiful. Shortly after sunset in the west, there was a bright full moon rising from the east. It was so surreal to see the bright full moon rose above the peaceful lake that was still holding a purple hue after the sunset. In the quiet hours at night, the shallow water slapped softly at the shore making bubbly sounds while the full moon shone over the forest of our campsite. Dark shadows of pines patched on the ground and on our tent. Time had stopped at hundreds of years ago.","East Branch Lean-to

Our camp sat at the tip of the little peninsula was perfect for watching Sunrise. Before 6am, the eastern sky had showed color of orange. The flat lake surface was as smooth as a huge piece of silk fabric, occasionally there was a small ripple caused be little insects or small fish, it quietly enlarged to expanding circles, till it quietly dispersed for the lake to return to its flat surface again. White water vapor from the lake slowly rose up, drifting even more slowly to one direction in the almost non-noticeable breeze. Gradually the orange sun came up, turned the silky lake into a piece of glass orange at the far distance near the sun, radiant gradually to blue towards us. Everything that showed up above the lake surface with part of them in the lake formed mirror images at the surface. Our hikers at the shore watching sunrise all draped with golden hue, faces turned bright, full of hope, excitement and energy. A beautiful new day was ahead of us. We had breakfast at the camp, warmed up nicely by the morning sun. It was hard to pack and leave the beautiful place.
But we had long distance to travel and there was no time to waste as we started to hike. In the morning we climbed up a little hill to get to a shelter (called lean-to in Maine) in two hours. Near this lean-to there was a 15ft large spring flowing with cool clear yummy water. Green mosses covered rocks filled the path of the spring flow. It looked as lovely as in any fairy tale picture book. Someone commented that it was the best water on A.T.. I don’t know if it was really the best, but it was indeed one of the best. We loaded up here. I got 3 liters to carry. It was heavy, but worth every drop. 

The trail was more challenging than yesterday. Lots and lots of roots. The Maine forest roots - gnarled, slippery, frequently to catch hiker’s boots to trip him/her over. Combining the roots with rocks and mud, then duplicating and stretching them for almost all 16.7 miles of today’s section. At one point where the twisted roots were so annoying that I almost screamed at them. A few minutes later, I came to my senses: there was no point of screaming at roots since they wouldn’t care anyway! Of course there was also a little mountain to climb near the end of the day. We were very tired by the time we reached a logging road to camp. Maybe tomorrow some smooth trails will be there for us.
We had seen so many big moose foot prints in the past two days, on trail, near a shelter, and in a sandy beach by a lake. Still we had not seen any moose. A big rabbit was running around near us today. I had not seen a rabbit for months. In late afternoon and after dark, we heard some animal calls. Could they be from owls or water birds in the lake nearby?
At the view point of Nesuntabunt Mountain I think I saw the Mount Katahdin cross a lake. It dominated the skyline of all mountains in my view. But somehow I didn’t feel the excitement or intimacy of that peak. It felt like just as another mountain that I could need to climb. “Poet” a thru-hiker who operates the Shaw’s hostel in Monson told us that he had the urge to touch the peak when he first saw it on White Cap. I only felt it is a normal mountain.","Antlers Campsite

This was a special day for me. I just realized that tonight might be the last night that I’d sleep in the forest on A.T. Thru-hike. We walked 16.5 miles, just 3.5 miles shy from the car accessible Abol Bridge campground in Baxter SP. Tomorrow we’ll be out of the 100 miles wilderness with only 15 miles to the finish line. It would be done as a day hike.
Throughout the day it was dreary and dark, under the threat of rain. But really rained very little. It only wetted my poncho slightly. I was very glad that my boots and socks were kept dry. But that rain was enough to make the trail wet and more slippery. The dark clouds coverage also made the forest darker. In mid afternoon it felt like dusk of after 6pm. There were again many ponds and lakes we passed today. At Crescent Pond, a large slab of rock was used by people as boat landing spot. A few kayak and a roll boat sat there, a rare sight in the wilderness.
Rainbow lake was so big. It has a 5.1 miles trail from west end to the east end all on A.T. with many small ups and downs and slippery knotted roots. We had our lunch break at a campsite near the lake. In the rain I set up a tarp with my poncho, cooked soup for my husband who was still not eating much food.
In the afternoon, we came upon Rainbow Ledge - a beautiful rock garden by nature. Maples started to show bright red, ferns were green/yellow/cinnamon/orange/brown. Blueberry bushes were turning red and mahogany, resting among creamy colored cotton ball mosses. Another type of bush were full of bright bubblegum pink berries, also showed red and purple leaves. Lichens and mosses hung on tree branches in the air, light green, creamy white or bright yellow. The plants were sectional divided into garden beds with granite rocks paved the walking path. Under the gloomy sky, the rock garden felt uplifting for my spirit, also felt magical as it was so different from the green dense forest below. All of a sudden I had forgot the hard walk over those roots and mud. Life is good here, I have to agree.
By 6pm we made it to Hurd Brook lean-to. No one else was there. The shelter has a sleeping floor made of round sticks-so called baseball bats floor. Maybe that’s the reason no one wanted to sleep there since it was not as comfortable as flat surface. But we decided to stay for the night.","Gravel logging road

The last night was the last night that I slept in the forest. Today was the last day that I hiked full day in the delightful forest. We woke up early before sunrise, no need to cook breakfast for everyone wanted to get to Abol Bridge camp store to eat the “real” breakfast. By 8:15am we came out from the 100 miles wilderness north boundary and walked into Baxter State Park. The paved road led us to the bridge over the Penobscot River. Autumn colors had shown in the trees along the banks. Across the river the green slope of Mount Katahdin rose into white clouds cap, hidden from view - a mystery world to me.
At the camp store, we ate lots of food, bid goodbye to my husband who went to AT lodge in Millinocket for the rest of the day, leaving me to slackpack the rest 9.5 miles of A.T. to Katahdin Stream Campground.
Baxter SP is such a treasure that worth all the protections for generations. The 9.5 miles of trail from Abol Bridge camp store to Katahdin Steam campground ranger station were filled with countless treasures. There were all types of mushrooms, some were as black as ink, some were as orange as a ripe pumpkin, and some even had lavender color. The smooth trail was like a melting chocolate river, flowing effortlessly through the green moss carpeted forest floor. Mushrooms sprouting out of the green carpet in groups in riots, gave me the impression of mushroom villages. Fall colored birch leaves drifted to the ground, spray the chocolate river and carpet with golden yellow. Yearling maples with bright red leaflets invaded green mounds of moss covered logs, hoping to get a foothold in the soft surface. Along the Penobscot River and later the Nesowadnehunk Stream red maples were also started to show their colors. Waterfalls and numerous cascades flew through the stream, sometimes making soft songs and sometimes roaring to race down. The water in many streams were so clear that I just wanted to stare at them to see if I could spot any fish in there. I took tons of photos, hoping to keep this treasured forest in my memory and capture the full glory of the wonderland. I was walking in a dream world today, a sweet dream world. I will sure miss it.","Hurd Brook lean-to

In the high wind and swirling clouds/fogs, I climbed the last mountain on A.T.-Mount Katahdin, and reached the northern terminus of this great trail. I COMPLETED THE Appalachian Trail! I am a proud 2000 miler now!
In the unforgettable past 168 days, I lived in the woods, drank spring/stream/river and lake water, walked 2192 miles (3654km). Loved every moment on my journey. Thanks every loved one and friend for the support, without you, I cannot done this. Especially thanks to my dear husband who walked with me on the first and last 100 miles together.
Similar as in the past month and half, today’s trail was not a piece of cake. 2.5 miles before Katahdin peak, it was a lot of vertical climbs where rock climbing and gymnastics skills were the most valuable to have. Without heavy large backpack, I actually enjoyed the hand over hand exercise. My arms and legs were strong as well as my mind. I was aware of safety tolerance and kept cool when other hikers hesitated to move in the cold gusty of wind. I felt like a mountain goat in a steep terrain, confident with my every move. I was slow, but steady, just like other times on the trail: set my goal, set my safety boundary, and work to get to where I wanted.
