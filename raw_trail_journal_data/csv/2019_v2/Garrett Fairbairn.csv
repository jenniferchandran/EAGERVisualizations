Garrett Fairbairn,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608064,"I’ve been slacking. Six days ago I started hiking the Appalachian Trail and it has taken over my life. Communicating with family and friends has been a struggle but slowly I’m getting the hang of it. My first day on the trail was surreal. Years of slowly gathering gear and thinking about the trail had culminated in this moment at Amicalola Falls State Park in northern Georgia. I had an 8.8 mile hike just to officially start the trail and as of right now that has been the most challenging part of the hike. Steep unrelenting inclines had me questioning if I was in good enough shape. Since then I’ve stopped questioning and started really enjoying the trail. Northern Georgia is tough hiking. There are no ridge lines to walk on. Steep climbs are met with beautiful views and then an immediate downhill slope. The mountains themselves remind me of back home in the Catskills, with plains abruptly ending in an overwhelming mass of mountains. As I hike all day I’m encompassed by mountains until I descend into a tunnel of trees and streams. I try and take breaks often for food, water and simply to rest. I go back and forth between being in my head and really taking in everything around me. As I go on I’m excited to see if I’ll be able to be much more aware of my surroundings and hardly ever in my head. The people I’ve met help make the trail a really incredible and fun place. From couples in their 60’s to wandering 20 somethings (me) everyone has a story to share at the many shelters along the trail. The shelters themselves are three sided wooden structures, minimal but some of my hardest laughs have come from inside them. Life out here is at a much slower pace than what a modern day northeaster experiences. I wake up with the sunrise, hike most of the day, cook dinner and go to bed not long after the sunset. Currently I’m resting my legs in the Swiss-German style town of Helen, Georgia after walking about 60 miles in six days. My knee has some pain but a little bit of vitamin I (Ibuprofen) and rest should do the trick. Everyone is excited about only being 25 miles from North Carolina but as for me, I’m taking it one step at a time. I’ve walked in clouds, slept through a thunderstorm, walked upon a field of deer, hitched a ride 3 times, eaten more food than a full grown whale and met people I really connect with. From now on I’ll hopefully post once a day now that I have a better feel for the trail. Until then, I’m gonna keep eating.

Garrett Fairbairn,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608162,"With my knee still hurting I decided to take a zero day in Helen. The usual laundry, dollar general resupply, and planning the next week of hiking took place. The plan is to arrive in North Carolina on Sunday. With beautiful weather all week I hope to make the most of every day. Time to eat.","

Garrett Fairbairn,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608489,"Aside from overall physical exertion I would have to admit that keeping up with a blog is the hardest part of my hike so far. Between a lack of service in the mountains and a strong desire to endlessly sleep after 16 mile days, blogging has become an event best accomplished from a hotel bed. Currently I’m taking a zero day in Franklin, North Carolina. I feel obligated to mention just how generous the people of Franklin have been in my short time here. Upon exiting the woods we were greeted with trail magic from a former thru hiker (1997) in the form of cookies and bananas. An older gentlemen, he told stories from his days on the trail as well as the time he and his friend were dropped off by float plane on Turquoise Lake in Lake Clark National Park, Alaska. About the time his story ended a shuttle that brings hikers to town pulled up and a flyer made us aware of a free breakfast for hikers. Since 2008 a church is Franklin puts on a delicious all you can eat breakfast for thru hikers. The generosity of people living near the trail in Georgia and North Carolina has made me feel at ease even though I’m somewhere entirely new. 
Last I wrote I was in Helen, resting a sore knee. Uphill was the name of the game immediately after returning to trail. Rocky Mountain, Tray Mountian and Kelly Knob required constant mental fortitude and numerous breaks to catch my breathe. That night at deep gap shelter I met a hiker named Thirsty Boots. In his 60’s, he proceeded to tell me that at age 50 he decided to start hiking. He has since hiked the triple crown (AT, PCT and CDT) twice and is now attempting to do it a third time. Before my hike I was always incredibly worried about age. I foolishly questioned whether or not I was too old to be hiking the Appalachian Trail. People like Thirsty Boots have opened my eyes to a whole new way of thinking about hiking. 
Like many AT hikers I had watched several people on YouTube complete thru hikes of the AT, partly for enjoyment and partly to get a feel for what the trail would be like. In almost every video one of the highlights is crossing over from Georgia to North Carolina, knowing that no matter what happens after, at least you were able to hike through one state. The day after meeting Thirsty Boots I was able to accomplish just that. There were a few hikers I had previously met at the border and they welcomed me to North Carolina. Any relief I felt was immediately taken away upon hiking into this new territory. By far the steepest climb of the hike was right after the border. Completely vertical climbs for miles continued until I felt I could go no more. The next day kept up the pace with a climb up Standing Indian Mountain (5435 feet) and a daily total of 16 miles. I should mention that for the last week I have been hiking with a couple people from the far too densely populated state of New Jersey. Slim and Bearbell went to high school together but weren’t really friends in those days. Now the three of us have become a tramily, or trail family. The day after summiting Standing Indian we woke before sunrise to climb up 5250 foot Albert Mountain and reach the 100 mile mark of the trail. That morning as we reached the fire tower I can truly say I’ve never seen anything quite as beautiful on the east coast as the mountains of North Carolina with the possible exception of the Adirondacks. From there we trekked for what felt like another 100 miles (but was really 10 miles) to where we received the cookie and banana trail magic. 
So far the trail has been physically challenging. Muscles are sore, chaffing occasionally happens and yes, I can eat over 1000 calories in one sitting and still lose weight. The mental side of things has yet to be a challenge. Everything is still new and exciting, many people are still on the trail and the idea of going into a town to resupply seems like a much needed break instead of a hassle. I’m more than aware this will change. From what I’m told the Virginia blues are a real thing and will really push me mentally. Days and days of walking through “the green tunnel” with no views and people quitting daily will attempt to force me into my head instead of the scenery around me. I’m looking forward to this challenge more than anything on the trail. Seeing how I react when things are going horribly, when the novelty of the situation has worn off, when I truly start to question why I’m putting myself through this, that could be the largest reason I’m out here. For now though everything is going excellent. We hit Fontana Dam and Great Smoky Mountain National Park in a week. Several mountains with clear views are ahead. The weather looks near perfect for the next week. Oh and I almost forgot, I have a trail name. If you follow me on Instagram you already know it. It involves that park in Montana I always seem to mention to everyone. Until the next town.

Garrett Fairbairn,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608673,"I’m in a hotel again. I know, I know, it hasn’t been that long since Franklin. The decision to hitch into Bryson City, North Carolina was not made lightly. The decision does give me the opportunity to talk about something I’ve always heard and am now experiencing first hand: listening to your body on the trail. 
After spending a sunny, food filled day in Franklin, Slim, Bearbell and I called a shuttle service listed in my guidebook. This service was a man named Jim. Pushing his upper 60’s, Jim spoke to us as if he was teaching his grandkids a lesson. Work hard, put in your time and be respectful we’re just some of the moral tidbits Jim mentioned in our 11 mile car ride. He went on to tell us that during wartime he spied and relayed intelligence about the Russians. Upon dropping us off at the trailhead, we received more trail magic (hotdogs) and of course noticing a Montana bumper sticker on a car, I sparked a conversation with our hotdog providers about glacier. 
Since we started hiking much later than normal that day (noon) we only managed 11 miles. I was alone when I reached Siler Bald, a 5000 foot mountain summit which had been mowed for tourist purposes, I was later told. The views I’ve seen in Georgia and North Carolina are much different than in the northeast. Here the only way to describe the mountains are in layers, one layer behind another, gradually taller until the layers fade into the horizon. After Siler Bald came Wayah Bald which had a stone observation tower (since the first two wooden fire towers burned down). Again waves of mountains we had already climbed could be seen. That night we stayed at the Wayah Bald shelter and dealt with strong winds all night. Waking in the morning, I lifted my head from my sleeping bag to find a coating of snow on the ground. Happy that the total accumulation wasn’t the usual foot or more we often receive back home, I was inspired by the white landscape to make it 16.3 miles to the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC), a huge outdoor store that the trail runs next to. Almost every person I watched hike the AT on YouTube showed this spot and I was excited to reach it myself. 
The day started with mostly uphill climbs until reaching the summit of Wesser Bald. From the observation deck I had a clear view of the Smoky Mountains. Towering ominously above everything, the smokies have their own unique snow covered look. The rest of the day was a steep downhill climb. Part way down my decent my right knee and ankle began to bother me in such a way I had to make frequent stops to rest. With the excitement of reaching the NOC I walked all 16.3 only to realize my feet were killing me, I had painful chaffing and the NOC was completely booked, even tent sites. Upon hearing this news my heart sank a little for the first time since starting the trip but I held my emotions in check and didn’t overreact. Other hikers at the NOC had said they were going to hike a little bit further to find tent spots but I knew better than to push my body. That moment, when you hear other hikers are pushing on and you know you shouldn’t is a moment I think many hikers face. Just like when you feel obligated to have one more drink because everyone else is, the decision to hike on or not is your personal decision. Listening to your body and not the group around you could easily be the difference between finishing a long distance hike and not. It can be so easy to say “well I don’t want to fall behind everyone and I’m not hurting that bad” but in reality those small decisions can add up and end a hike. And so my tramily and I decided to take a day off in Bryson City, two days away from Fontana Dam and the Smoky Mountains. Immediately it seemed like fate as we got a hitch with a 2014 thru hiker who is visiting family here but currently lives in my favorite city, Missoula Montana. He explained that he also took it easy when first starting his thru hike and then pulled big miles once he got his trail legs. And now there is nothing left to do but rest and get ready for more incredible scenery...... and eat.

Garrett Fairbairn,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609572,"Why am I out here? It’s a question I’ve been asked only a few times by hikers and interested friends. To be honest I’m not sure if I can even come close to articulating a high quality answer. There are several ways to answer the question, from the simple “because it’s there” to the more challenging idea of walking the line between order and chaos. Over the past week and a half I’ve had a little time to reflect on this question while walking through some of the most gorgeous areas in the eastern U.S. 
Upon leaving Bryson City I was greeted with a steep incline up Cheoah Bald. For those unfamiliar with the terminology, a bald is a mountain whose summit has been cleared and often mowed, often creating incredible mountains views. Cheaoh Bald did not disappoint, with an endless sea of mountains cast before me. The next day Slim, Bearbell and I arrived at the Fontana Hilton, a famous shelter on the AT, known for its large size, cell phone charging station and showers. This would be our last stop before Great Smokey Mountains National Park. The village of Fontana is a small resort nestled in the mountains of North Carolina. Because it’s so early in the year only a skeleton crew of 25 employees was working the village. I arrived at the lodge expecting to pick up a package of food I had mailed myself from Franklin. Slim, Bearbell and I mailed our packages at the same time and yet somehow both of their packages were there and mine was not. With no real options to resupply before the smokies I began to get a bit frantic. Looking back I see there was no reason to become upset as my package was in that days mail but in the moment I was overwhelmed. 
After a night in the Fontana Hilton it was time to enter Great Smokey Mountains National Park for the first time in my life. Something about walking through an entire national park made me eager and ready to take on the steep challenge. Entering the smokies was a time of change. During my time there I would hike ahead of Slim and Bearbell (neither of whom go by those trailnames anymore) and I would be given a new trailname (Legs, because I’m one of two people I know of not using hiking poles). I would also start hiking with two new people, Lobster (from New Hampshire) and Scoutmaster (from Philadelphia). The smoky mountains lived up to their name when I first arrived in the park. Clouds fit in the valleys between mountains, almost as if they were gently placed there. For as long as you could see not a building or road was visible. During most of the smokies I was above 5000 feet, eventually reaching the highest point on the AT, Clingmans Dome. At just over 6600 feet I had incredible views of both Tennessee and North Carolina, two states I had been going back and forth in since entering the smokies and am currently still zig zagging between. At higher elevations a coniferous wonderland awaited, much like the taller peaks in the Catskills and Adirondacks. Scenic views were almost guaranteed to happen every other mile and the trail itself was in great condition. In the smokies you have to sleep in a shelter unless it is full and at the time I was fine with that due to the colder temperatures but since then I’ve come to love sleeping in my tent. The REI Quarter Dome 1 hardly has enough room for me but it gives me privacy, allows me to go to the bathroom at night without waking an entire shelter of people and it packs and unpacks in under 5 minutes. 
After the smokies Lobster, Scoutmaster and I had a couple days walk before reaching Hot Springs, North Carolina. A small town on the French Broad River, it catered to hikers with cheap lodging, great food and even better craft beer. Since Hot Springs we have been walking the border of North Carolina and Tennessee, passing milestones like Max Patch (huge bald) and the 300 mile mark all the way into the town of Erwin, Tennessee where I currently am writing. Erwin is a decent sized town on the Nolichucky River which is home to some high quality rapids. Right off of interstate 26 it has every convenience one would need and access to incredible outdoor activities. Both Hot Springs and Erwin have had cheap hostels where I have met up with several hikers I had not seen for at least two weeks. 
Since entering the smokies I generally hike alone for the majority of the day. Between scenery, intense uphill and downhill climbs and people stopping to ask if I’m actually trying to walk to Maine, I have a rather busy and exhausting day before I even get to camp. Despite the business there are several lulls in the days, particularly as the days become just a little more flat and my surroundings become a little more stagnant. During these times I think about friends, family, what the future might look like and honestly all kinds of things I never expected to pop into my head. Occasional though I go back to the question of why I’m out here. As I mentioned before it partially has to do with the idea of committing to something regardless of how bad it gets but on a higher level I think it might have to do with order and chaos. People need order in their life, small goals that obtain larger goals which orient us in the world. Putting procedures in place to succeed in those goals is essential. At the same time people also need chaos, that unknown area which can easily overwhelm but also provides the excitement in life. Walking the edge between order and chaos can really make life feel incredible. The Hawaiians saw surfing as sacred because when a surfer was mastering a wave he was physically embodying the balance between order and chaos. And in a sense I think that’s what thru-hiking is; a semi controlled environment where one can attempt to find the balance between order and chaos. Everyday I go through the same routines to get me from one area to the next. If something doesn’t work well I do my best to fix it. At the same time Im dealing with new terrain and Mother Nature which is always throwing curveballs at you. Being able to physically keep walking for almost 2200 miles really means you have mastered the balance between order and chaos.

Garrett Fairbairn,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615112,"The trail has taken over me. Days blend into weeks, television seems strange, cars appear to drive incredibly fast at road crossings. Through walking in the woods I’ve learned things about myself I never knew but even more startling are the things I always knew about myself yet could never accept. Being alone in the woods day after day takes away all the distractions of modern life and allows you to delve deeper into yourself. Getting to know myself has been the most terrifying and liberating event in my life to date.Virginia was an incredibly long state to walk through. For over a month I saw mountains, rolling hills, farms and a couple bears. I was given free food from strangers and I met more people than I can possibly remember. I walked through the town of Damascus, saw ponies at Grayson Highlands State Park, stayed at the incredible Woods Hole Hostel, got incredibly sick in Waynesboro, ate the best breakfast on trail in Shenandoah National Park, and stayed at a shelter with a solar shower and horse shoe pit. Walking into West Virginia and crossing the Shenandoah River didn’t feel real. As an AT hiker you think about that moment for a long time. The river itself was massive, stretching at least twice as long as the Delaware in upstate New York. The town of Harpers Ferry had more history than I could ever learn, including a Lewis and Clark museum and an actual rock that Thomas Jefferson gave a speech on. Maryland was short with incredibly well manicured fields and trail. Several points in Maryland along the trail had kiosks about Civil War battlefields I was standing on. And now I find myself in Pennsylvania or Rocksylvania as it’s known on trail. In all honesty the rocks have not been horrible yet. As soon as I crossed the Mason Dixon Line I could practically feel the difference between the north and the south. Pine forests began, maple trees became much more prevalent and yes the hospitality has decreased slightly. I can feel the pull of New York from here. I’m incredibly excited to be in my home state and possibly see some friends. But first I have more rocks to contend with as well as the many boardwalks of New Jersey. 




I’ve always felt naive when it comes to knowing myself. “I picked the wrong major in college.” “I really don’t belong in this group.” “I don’t know what I want to do with my life.” “I truly don’t know where my morals lie.” In vicious cycles these ideas have swarmed my head from time to time creating a sense of such uncertainty about myself I was left with no choice but to be incredibly insecure. From that insecurity stemmed indecision and an intense fear of making the wrong decision. It was as if I thought one day I would wake up and finally see myself only to hate the choices I previously made. When I originally planned to thru hike I spent months going back and forth on whether it was the right thing to do. I felt foolish and stupid for contemplating such a long hike, I chastised myself for running away from responsibility and the real world. I never had confidence and conviction when saying I was attempting to hike 2200 miles, instead I would generally use humor to deflect the scale of the situation. When I say things have changed I mean that just typing “things have changed” brings a tear to the eye. Somehow the simple act of walking and depriving myself of modern day conveniences has given me the confidence to accept myself and realize that for some time I’ve known much more about myself than I ever gave myself credit for. 


Perhaps I’m just getting older but it now seems incredibly obvious that I’m the kind of person who thinks the grass really is greener on the other side. For a few years before this hike I watched people hike long distance trails on YouTube. I read about them in books and magazines. The idea of waking up somewhere new every day and seeing the most beautiful parts of an area and really immersing yourself in nature seemed like the ideal way to live. Nothing seemed better or more perfect to me. At the time of these thoughts I was working regular jobs with regular hours, living in apartments with running water and toilets and roofs to protect from thunderstorms in towns with supermarkets and restaurants that sell more than instant mashed potatoes. Now that I’ve been on the trail for over 80 days I can see all the incredible benefits of working a regular job and living a regular live. For a good portion of Virginia the grass was greener in the real world, that same place where I so desperately wanted to be thru hiking. I didn’t want to be on a mountain in a lightening storm or sitting in front of a dollar general waiting for it to open. Thru hiking wasn’t exactly what the YouTube videos had shown me. I had to go back to my core reasons for being out here to stick with it. Becoming violently sick in Waynesboro and having to go home for a week really tested how much I was willing to put up with in order to persist. And I have persisted. And while I still have over 1000 miles to hike it’s as if I’ve come out the other side a different person. I’ve come to love and accept who I am. I can see how even when I was thru hiking, that thing that seemed perfect before I did it, the grass seemed greener somewhere else. And it’s that ability to step back and see where my mind tends to go that allows me to try and lead it in a new direction. I’m now able to truly enjoy every moment of thru hiking, the few incredible moments and all the rest. My attitude is calmer and less reactive. It’s come to my attention that I may not be able to fund the entirety of my hike. Money spends as fast as I walk. Before this hike that thought would have greatly upset me. Now I accept it for what it is and continue to press forward. Oh and I almost forgot, I’ve acquired a new trail name. Due to my unending love of blizzards and ice cream I am now Dairy King. Until next time.Dairy King","
