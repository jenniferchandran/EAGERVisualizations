Crazy Heart,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/557061,"Buying gear and getting ready for section hike on the AT to work out the kinks. I am not starting the thru hike until March of next year but want to get in several section hikes in preparation. My first section hike will be 04/23/2017 where I will start the AT near Elk Park, NC and end up in Damascus, VA hopefully seven days later. I am also planning a week in August in the Wind River Range with a couple of buddies. Even though the thru hike is a long way off I want to spend the tie to get in good physical shape and make sure I have the right equipment.","

Crazy Heart,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/558876,Still have just under a year for my thru hike of the AT. Will be doing a section hike from Elk Park to Damascus (app 75 miles) on the AT starting this April 23. Hope to see some of the people I have been reading about on the trail journal. I have also been training so I can get this 63 year old body to handle the trail. Over the past 3 months I have dropped 25 lbs to 185 and do weights and aerobic 3 times a week. With the added pack weight I will be at about the total weight of just myself at the beginning of the year.Feeling Good!,"

Crazy Heart,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605118,"Well it is less than 4 months until I start my thru hike in March 2019.  I had planned to thru hike in 2018 but life got in the way especially with my youngest daughter entering a new high school.   Dad needed to be around.  But now she is settled in and my wife has said to ""go for it"".  This past July, I section hiked the AT from the southern entrance of Shenandoah National Park to Harpers Ferry,WV or about 160 miles.  This taught me several lessons.  First is I need to lower the weight as much as possible.  The biggest culprits are food and clothing.  The second is that the pack needs to fit right or I am going to be miserable.  I got my Granite Gear pack online and did the adjustments myself.  I realized that the size was not right and much of the pack was resting on my shoulders.  I will be taking my pack into REI and either making adjustments with their help or get a new pack that rests more on the hips.  Finally, I learned that it is vital to start slow.  I jumped into 10+ miles immediately and moved up to 16 in less than a week.  For a 64 year old this is asking for trouble.  In my second week of the section hike, I developed shin splints which progressively got worse as I was hiking through the ""roller coaster"".  I limped into Harpers Ferry and proceeded to soak my feet in a cooler of ice water for 2 days.  When I got home, my doctor said it was the worst shin spints he had seen.  It took a couple of weeks to get back to normal.  I plan to start under 10 miles for several days at the start and to listen to my body.  I will force myself to not try to keep up with the younger crowd.  Finally I am going to be very conscious of the downhills and take shorter steps and side step if necessary on very steep sections.
I am excited and hope to share my adventure in a few months.
