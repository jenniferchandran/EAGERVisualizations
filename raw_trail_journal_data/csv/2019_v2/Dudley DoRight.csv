Dudley DoRight,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/592366,"Dyno Mite and I are exercising 5 days a week and have been climbing the mechanical steps of a stair master machine in addition to lifting weights, walking, playing racquetball and pickleball as much as possible.
We had to miss trail days due to several graduations of our family from college and even from pre-k.  You know, everyone gets a trophy for participating now days.
We had a couple of great hikes in Huntsville State Park north of Houston and have the video's on our Facebook and You Tube channels.
Training will escalate next week as we prepare for an August climb up Mount Washington and the Katahdin to ready ourselves and our knowledge for what lies before us next year.  We are still weighing the possibility of a Flip Flop in the event we are not making the progress estimated to put us in Maine before August 1, 2019.  Last thing we want to do is not be able to summit Katahdin due to weather, runing out of time or injuries.  We will keep our options open as we hike to Harper's Ferry as our first goal location.  Should be there by Trail Days next year, pending weather and our physical conditions.  
This Fall and Winter will be full of prep hikes to further test our cold weather gear which came through with flying colors in 28 degree nights.  Just wish it had been 15 degrees.","At home training

We will be releasing ""What's in our BackPacks"" as well as some ""Big Agnes Tent Assembly"" and others.  One unique video on a idea I had which will show assembly and usage.  It could be a game changer!

Dudley DoRight,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/596661,"Pre-hiking videos coming soon!
We are about seven (7) months out from the beginning our hike of the Appalachian trail.  Videos are coming very soon.  We have been waiting for several of the hikers this year to summit Katahdin Mountain in Maine.  We have seen several in the last two (2) weeks reach their goal.  ScoutMaster, Mainer, BlackBeard (all trail names) have completed to mention a few.  A large group is in Maine and New Hampshire, less then a month out from completion.
We like input from those following the hike so if you have any questions about how, what and why, please email me and we will address them in coming videos.
Please tell your friends about our quest and “Share” at the bottom of the site with your Facebook and Twitter friends.  Many who we have shared our desire with have started hiking and are thinking of joining us for “section hikes” along the way.
I am also excited to announce that my son, Chris, is going to join us on the trail as well.  He is an EMT so his training and knowledge will be great on the trail,
In August, we will be in New Hampshire and Maine training with day hikes.  We hope to be at the top of Katahdin when some of the hikes we follow come up to the top!  Happy Days!
Stay in touch and check out our latest videos.

Dudley DoRight,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/603789,"One question our friends are asking us a lot is, “How are you going to stay warm in sub freezing weather?”  This is a great question I want to address in this post.
The answer is….it is all about the gear!  Having the correct gear on the trail is imperative to success, especially when dealing with cold and rain.
Our cold weather gear includes excellent 850, water resistant (Pertex), down mummy sleeping bags with micro-fiber liners. (We will be wearing layers of clothes along with down jackets and a rain jacket if needed.)
REI Magna 10
My sleeping bag (pictured above) is rated for 10 degrees and Dyno Mite’s is rated at 17.  We both have microfiber liners that add about another 7 degrees to the lower limits.
Our greatest concerning is being cold AND wet.  This should not take place due to our equipment use, BUT, if it does, we have contingencies.
At night, we also will wear head, neck and face gear as needed along with gloves and down booties.  This decreases temperature loss when really cold.  Of course, we will also have on our sleeping clothes that will add to the mix. We will also be sleeping with our water filters and electronics in the foot bags to keep them from freezing.  (Water filters will freeze and become worthless).
If we are “tenting”, the tent adds a few degrees to the mix as well.  You are more exposed in a “shelter” (3 sided wooden structure) than in a tent. If the shelter is empty, we can put the tent in the shelter and have the best of both worlds. (Another reason we are leaving in February!) This keeps the tent from getting wet.  Nothing worse than packing a wet tent!
The coldest recorded temperature in the Smoky mountains was -32 degrees on the top of Mt. LeConte on Jan 13th, 1986.  We will not be camping in either a tent or shelter if it is that cold.  Weather forecasts will tell us a few days out if we are going to get a cold snap like that while on the trail. My big concern is a prolonged snow storm for 2 plus days.  Tenting is not practical if accumulations exceed 2 inches.  A wet snow on the roof of the tent can get heavy fast. (Yes, there are dry snows).
We will not be at high altitudes to be exposed to those temperatures at night.  By researching the data, the coldest we will have to deal with is in single digits. If it is going to be prolonged nasty weather (cold, snow and high winds), then a hikers hostel or motel/hotel will be a good place to wait it out. We call days of no hiking…”Zeros”. A “Nero” is hiking only a few miles a day.
Osprey Atmos 65A full video of “What’s in my back pack!” is coming this week! It will be followed by Dyno Mite’s “What’s in her pack!”.  I invite you to comment and let us know if you see anything we are leaving out.  Bear in mind, there will be a little more electronics than most due to our Vlogging.  This is a calculated weight I will have to bear.  Bear? Where?","Home

Dudley DoRight,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605841,We have been training and vlogging on Youtube several recent hikes.  We have started our cold weather training and gear shakedown.  Felt it was pre-mature to do a gear video when we are still making changes and eliminating weight.  Have parred down 6 pounds but am still heavier than I want to be.66 days and counting to our staging in Dawsonville looking for a weather window.,"Home
