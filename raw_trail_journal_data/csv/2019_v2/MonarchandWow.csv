MonarchandWow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606472,"… So where were we?  Ah yes, we were planning to return in 2016 to complete the PCT.   (See MonarchandWow PCT 2015)
Oops …… that didn’t happen.  If you want to give the Gods  a laugh, tell them your plans!  

So this is what we have been doing.  Having retuned from the PCT, Monarch wanted to grow green vegetables and put her feet up at home where as, Wow, still full of the explorer archetype decided to head to the remote areas of Western Australia (new territory for us). Missing Monarch, he returned to Tasmania singing the praises of his sojourn.  Convinced, Monarch packed her bags and off they set again.  This time with a plan to travel the infamous Gibb River Road which is a former cattle route that stretches in an east-west direction almost 660 km through the Kimberley region between the towns of Derby and Kununurra.   Known for shaking your 4WD vehicle so hard that bits drop off if they are not bolted and glued down and where nobody in their right mind would travel without at least two spare wheels, we ventured forth.   Often closed due to flooding during the wet season it boasts stunning scenic views of geological formations and natural scenery.   There is much aboriginal and pastoral history to read in this landscape too.  We could not believe the amount of aboriginal rock art throughout the six-week trek, it was simply breath taking.  

When we arrived in Kununarra, we realized we were not done with the location and chose to stay to experience the ‘wet season’.  Stunning, we just could not get enough of this place and Wow picked up a contract, which facilitated us with a comfortable stay for the next two years. 

But we knew it was time to get moving again, so headed back to Tasmania to prepare for the Appalachian Trail 2019 but this time Monarch has opted to remain at home and write, hence Wow walking while Monarch writes.",,View Entry,"Jan 18, Fri",0

How, you may well ask, did we get our trail names?It started back at the beginning of this century when Monarch and I started “stepping out” together.   At the time Monarch had little experience of trekking but assured me that she liked to sleep under the stars - 4 stars were acceptable but 5 stars preferable! 
I was able to promise her that she would sleep under a million stars on our forthcoming  adventures.
Needless to say she took to outdoor adventuring like a duck to water and has not looked back. Having completed a number of treks including The Overland Track here in Tasmania, we lifted our vision wanting to explore other countries. We settled on The Lycian Way- a stunning trek along the south-west coast of Turkey. It is about 316 miles (509 km) long and took us about a month.
In the early mornings, during that trek, I would inform her that breakfast was ready (gentle word-speak for – ‘time to get up’). The response I got was as follows: the tent zipper was raised a few inches then a hand with an already hooked finger would be extended towards me, ready to receive the cup of tea. Once the cup was in hand it would retreat back into the tent and the zipper closed. When the porridge was ready I would get a repeat performance except the hand would be flat. Not a word would be spoken. Hence the trail name of Queenie was bestowed upon my beloved. 
On another multi-week trek along the remote west coast of Tasmania Queenie had her birthday and other team members presented her with a pair of long white gloves and a tiara!
It was while watching a David Attenborough film on the Monarch butterfly that we were having a discussion about a name change for Queenie – she felt that she has outgrown her trail name. Needless to say it did not take much to see that Queenie had matured into Monarch.
And how did I come by my trail name - Wow? 
Let me start by saying that we all know that feeling, I call it – The ‘cringe factor’, where you reflect on certain words/actions of the past and it causes your inner being to involuntarily assumes a tight foetal position and you close your eyes and shake your head. “Did I really do that?” Well this is how my trail name came about. 
Wow is an acronym for “Words of Wisdom”.   I was with a team retracing the steps of an escaped convict Alex “cannibal” Pearce through inhospitable terrain on Tasmania’s west coast. I wrote an article for the Australian Geographic about the trek. (Google - Trekking Tasmania –When driven by Hunger). I videoed the expedition, filming team mates as we struggled over, under, through, across and round the various obstacles we encountered. As they approached the camera I would say “Have you any words of wisdom for the book of knowledge?” It is only on watching the unedited 4 hr replay of the video that I became heartily sick of the sound of my own voice as I am sure did most other people. My team mates gave me a “words of wisdom” plaque just so I don’t forget. Thinking of you Stitch, Larry, Honey, Scary and MacGyver.

MonarchandWow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/606606,"The road trains are big in the Kimberley region where Wow and myself have been living these last three years.   And believe me, when you encounter them barreling down the dirt road at over 90 km an hour towards you, you make way by slowing down on the side to where the winds blowing from otherwise you loose all vision or worse, get buried in the dust!

A 52-year old grandmother is driving this one – they breed them tough out here! And they need to be as its not unusual for them to work a six day week for eight weeks straight making an 800km round trip each day.   That's a 12-13 hour day, which can quickly turn into 17 hours if they blow a tyre or get stuck in the red dirt.  Not to mention the three-day wait if they get stuck in floods!

During this time we haven’t been on extensive walks with boots an all – in fact, most the time Wow has been wearing Crocs!   Out here you tend to 4WD or boat to a location and then follow a watercourse which weaves through the bush like a well strung necklace, each bead being a waterhole fed with a pristine waterfall, in which you cool off and enjoy a swim (providing there are no crocodiles present)!

However, now that we’re back home here in Tasmania Wow has been walking some 10kms a day in a stunning coastal location which, forms part of the Narawantapu National Park (known by the locals as “Now I want a Poo”)! - All kitted out with a heavy sack, boots and all.

He presented to triage with a letter from his GP, which started by saying that Ken was a legendary bushwalker. On getting to know him, I found he had not only decades of bush walking all over Tasmania but had spent decades introducing many young people to “the joys of life under the stars”.  He has also started a bushwalking club, which is thriving.  His only “near fatal “ flaw is that he thinks he can tell a funny joke!

 

So, big shout out to Ken “LBW” MacPherson you are indeed a Legendary Bush Walker! 

 

As for myself, I am maintaining the schedule of daily walks, which is needed.  The sack is now fully packed and feeling pretty good.  I have never gone out on an extended bushwalk with one as light as this but for the Appalachian Trail it's the only way to go!

 

So I’m continuing to gear test, even walking for days in the same clothing to see how it all stands up.  Kuhl airspeed shirts are performing well.  After wearing one for a few days, I don't have to chase after it, to put it back on!  They have a cotton back panel, which is comfortable and when taking the sack off, eliminates that dreadful feeling of a cold wet shirt pressing on your back if there’s a cool breeze!",,View Entry,"Jan 30, Wed",0

Shoe Trees such as the one standing at mountain crossing's Neel’s  Gap on the Appalachian Trail are an embodiment of the American spirit.   

These trees are festooned with the boots of trekkers that having completed their hike and have returned to place their shoes in the tree, or people who have given up the trail once they experienced what it is like!

But did you know they are catching on here in Australia?   We were coming home down a winding back road the other day and spotted this piece of artwork.   Our local councils have stopped removing dead trees in public places and just chop out what is necessary to make them safe for passing traffic.  

We liked the idea of nailing the much-loved footwear to it.  Not so easy to do in remote places we grant you but think of all the extra habitat opportunities for the little critters in the area (insects that is; not the locals)!!!

Training continues and the rucksack contents have been reassessed.  I have had to incorporate trekking poles as I’ll be using a Z-pack tent for the Appalachian Trail and they will act as tent poles.

They have informed my decision making process regarding what type of equipment to take.  My last major trek was in 2015 and since then a few items have been manufactured which offer greater comfort, practicality and/or less weight than those I was carrying back then.  In particular, the Sea to Summit Thermolite Reactor Extreme sleeping bag liner; true it’s heavier than silk but it should help with getting quality sleep during any cold snaps.

MonarchandWow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607261,"I touched down in Atlanta Georgia on Sunday 17thFebruary.  But the fun had started way back in Los Angeles Airport!!  
Contrary to what the staff member at Melbourne airport had told me, which was that my luggage would go directly through to Atlanta, a member of the airline crew told me on the Melb/LA flight that I would have to reclaim my baggage in LA to go through customs, being an international visitor. Once we had landed, other staff members in the airport confirmed this request.  So I hung around the carousel in LA for sometime watching all the other folk happily collecting their baggage but nothing for me!
On asking what was happening and where my rucksack is, I was told that all I could do was to continue to Atlanta and make a claim there when I arrive. No one had the time to discuss the matter; they simply fired a couple of quick questions and then quickly move on.  
So here I am in America ready to hit the Appalachian Trail with no rucksack.  I tell you, if I wasn’t so bald I might have torn my hair out!  
I spent the all the waiting hours and the duration of the flight to Atlanta trying to come up with alternative strategies. Great start!!
In Atlanta I joined the line for customer service and they kindly told me that when the rucksack is found they would have it sent to the hotel. Then, just as they were talking, out of the luggage Shute popped my Sack!!  The crew was totally baffled and had no idea how or why this should have happened.
 So with a less contorted expression on my face and a rucksack on my back I caught the MARTA train to Sandy Springs and walked to the hotel. 
I spent the next day putting together two food drops and then locating a Post Office.  Again another hilarious experience!  There I was walking in the rain with my rucksack on my back and a parcel of food under each arm, both of which were getting soggy and very sorry looking by the minute. 
I asked a few locals for directions to the nearest Post Office and judging by their reactions to my appearance I had obviously acquired the “poor homeless guy” status, more commonly known as “Hiker Trash”!  When I finally found the Post Office it was automated and there were no boxes or tape to be purchased and looking around I was not the only one cursing the machine.  
Finally I went further down the road to the UPS who were very helpful. 

 

Job done!  I’ve done my winging, and I’m now tired but happy and returning to the hotel for a hearty meal and a good nights sleep!

MonarchandWow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607262,"Appalachian Trail Shuttle Drivers who act as a driver, guide and advisors are the perfect solution to the problem of getting to the trailhead.   Bret “Suches” Eady is one such fellow.   He picked me up from my hotel and drove me to the Amicalola Falls State Park visitors centre to register. There I received a quick pep talk from the ranger and was allocated the number 197.  He said that I was the first to register for the day and that it was probably due to weather, as it has been raining for some time now.  
Saying goodbye to the Ranger we walked up to the stone arch and posed for our photo.  Then we continued driving up to Springer Mountain car park via a forest trail as I had previously decided not to hike the approach trail. Thanking Bret for a job well done, I started the one-mile return trip to the top of Springer and return to the car park to continue on down the trial.  
The rain continued as I hiked through rhododendron forests but it was enjoyable enough.  Given that it was late start I planned to stay in a shelter at Hawk Mountain.   
On hearing that I had never stayed in a shelter before, I was made welcome by the other trekkers as they kindly made room for me. The shelter is a three-sided wooden structure.  Inside there are two-tier sleeping platforms holding twelve people but it was pretty tight with just ten.  But what the hell, its dry – or so I thought!!
Just as I finished laying out my sleeping bag a fellow on the upper tier knocked his stove over, spilling water all over us folk below.  My sleeping bag is now pretty wet - welcome to shelter life!","From Springer 0.0 miles to Hawk Mountain Shelter

The heavy rain continued today with some thunder and lighting thrown in to keep it interesting.  

On reaching Gooch Gap shelter I met up with a mum/daughter hiking team who had stayed in the shelter last night.  If I had a complaint about water spilling onto my sleeping bag in the shelter back at Hawk Mountain it was nothing compared to what they put up with at Gooch Gap as the whole place was flooded, sleeping platform included!

Still, to cheer us on our way there was trail magic from Fresh Grounds at his Leap Frog Café. Over a roaring pot-bellied stove Fresh Grounds recounted his own AT trek back in 2015 as he served up hot dogs and toasted cheese sandwiches.  He had a fair few other food items for sale too.  

Fresh Grounds was with Jim the Oracle who was kindly arranging to find accommodation for the mum/daughter hiking team that I had bumped into at Gooch Gap and also slack packing three young hikers over the next section.  

With rosy cheeks and a full belly I grabbed my sack and having thanked the lads I headed off down the trail.  Then it came to me that I had left my over-gloves back at Leap Frog Café. Nothing for it but to turn and walk back a mile to retrieve them.  But what do you know; they were in the lid of my sack all along, OUCH!  That’s 2 non-trail miles!!
I did make it to Woody Gap that night and managed to set up my new Z-pack Duplex tent, just before the heavens opened.   It was a massive storm, full of thunder and lightning and although it continued for most the night I could still hear shouting and rapid gunfire at times.   It would seem Camp Merrill is close by and they do Ranger maneuvers 24/7 365 days a year.  I guess that would explain all the spent ammo cases and clips of ammo along the trail!","Hawk Mountain

The three young fellows including Roster came past as they were being slack packed by Jim the Oracle over this section. 
 

Today was about climbing to the top of Blood Mountain. It’s the highest peak on the Georgia section of the Appalachian Trail and the sixth-tallest mountain in Georgia, with an elevation of 4,458 feet (1,359 m). 


There are various theories on the origin of the mountain's name. Some believe that the name of the mountain comes from a bloody battle between the Cherokee and Creek Indians and others believe that it got its name from the reddish colour of the lichen and Catawba growing near the summit.
The climb to the top is along a well-constructed switch back trail but today mist kept you guessing where the top was located and the thick vegetation closed in on both sides as if to add to the intrigue. 
But just as I reached the top, the light rain eased, allowing for a distant view of “ hilltop islands” in a sea of mist as I looked out from a large rock formation.
I took the time to check out the historic summit shelter, which is a beautiful two-room stone cabin with a dark interior smelling of wood smoke.  It was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1934 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in January 2013.  

I made it to Neel Gap and visited the Mountain Crossing outfitters, as they are fully equipped outfitters with a good resupply.  There I spent time chatting with the fellow about his caving expeditions with his wife. 
Unfortunately the hostel attached to the outfitter does not do laundry and I needed to dry my sleeping bag so I went to Blood Mountain Cabins where for the AT hiker-rate, you can get a cabin for $72 and Missy did my laundry for free!!!

Last night, as Banjo Patterson (who’s poetry and bush ballads speak to the heart of most Aussies) would have explained, “the air was clear as crystal and white stars fairly blazed” – which resulted in ice on the trail the next morning.

And of course it soon clouded over, though with a cool wind to keep me company.   

As is often the case when climbing mountains, the ascent and descent can vary greatly and this was my experience on Standing Indian Mountain.   I climbed a lovely trail to the top in reasonable time but the other side morphed into an assault course due to all the wind-blown trees on the ground.  Great work out!

Nah! Just kidding I woke up early to see it was overcast with rolling fog bringing in rain.  

I was out on track soon enough though and met Mad Dash and his elder brother T who had just had a zero day at Siler Bald Shelter. Needless to say they zipped past me (Oh! to be young again).  

 As I approached Wayah Bald I soon found myself in a high-altitude treeless open area with large rocks strewn individually on the ground.  It was presumably from these same rocks that the historical Wayah Bald Observation Tower located at the area’s highest peak (5,385 ft.) was built.   It was originally built in 1937 by the Civilian Conservation Corp in 1937 for fire detection but old photo’s show it in pretty poor state back in 2007 so it must have been rebuild since then.  
 Wayah Bald received its name from the Cherokee natives. It was named ""Waya"", the Cherokee word for wolf, after the red wolves that once inhabited the area. Spear points found on the bald indicate that indigenous people used the area as hunting grounds more than eleven thousand years ago. 
 A very pretty place and I can see that it would have been an even more inspiring visit had I seen it with all the rhododendrons and azaleas out in full bloom.  I might even have been inspired to write poetry myself!

Today started with a walk along a ridgeline in rain and fog.  Rather then diddling around a mountain, it was more like a roller-coaster experience and with low visibility, things got a little precarious whenever the trail became narrow!   

Worst still, on the steep descents, wet leaves cleverly disguised gnarled tree-roots and other obstacles.  

I’m not usually prone to performing arabesques whilst trekking but I did it with great aplomb today!  

Then, with one mighty leap I landed, snapping my ultra light Black Diamond carbon fibre trekking pole. Seriously though, I didn't put much weight on it and I was very surprised that it broke.  

A little further down the trail, Mad Dash and T passed by and T mentioned that he too had broken his pole which is the same model, and at the same location.  Buyer Beware!!!

Apparently it’s now a part of a facility where the U.S. Olympic athletes in kayak and canoe events train.   A popular form of kayaking in this region is called duckys, or an inflatable kayak to make it easier to go down the river and back up quickly. The duckys are suggested for experienced river rafters who are looking for a more high-performance trip down the river.

 The word Nantahala is Cherokee and means ""Land of the Noonday Sun"".   The river runs through a narrow and steep gorge where in some areas the sun reaches the ground only when it is directly overhead during the middle of the day.
The center also has a clothing store, lodging, and three restaurants.  

 So naturally, I’ve been sorting out my resupply for the next week and doing a general “shake down” of my gear. In addition to my iphone, I still have a 3 1/2 pound camera that to date has not come out of its waterproof bag!
 I went to the outfitters to sort a few things out and on arriving I noticed a young man sitting on the pavement being tended to by his partner.
 I could tell from his body posture that he had possibly dislocated his right shoulder. 
 Having brought what I needed from my sack, I went over to him and introduced myself and had a chat. On asking the young man about his obvious distress, he told me he was trying out his new canoe and had dislocated his shoulder. His partner was getting instructions over the phone and said that help was on its way and mentioned that the NOC run Wilderness/Remote medical courses.  They were using the hang technique, a method to relocate his shoulder. 
 Tentatively, (not knowing the legal ramifications off the top of my head) I offered my help and the young man promised not to sue me.   So with my mind at ease, I was able to apply a prolonged steady traction to the arm and the shoulder was relocated.   Many Blessings!
 Having had poor weather for the last few days I am so enjoying a fine sunny day today - with tomorrow’s weather prediction being poor again.   I’ve given myself a seven-day resupply then I noted that tomorrow is a long steep climb.  Oh dear!

We all knew that it was going to be hard day today and indeed much of it was spent climbing up to Cheoah Bald at 5,062 ft.   As has become the custom, Swede, Catmando and Lucky whizzed past me as they headed off for the next shelter.  Can’t say I blame them, as they wanted to arrive before the impending change in the weather.  And change it did.   By midday the rain belted down and then eased back a tad, to continue at a steady pace for the rest of the day.   
I finally got to the shelter where T-Rex, Kenny, Noodle, Corb and 15 Minutes quickly made room for me.    Then the fun began, as selecting a “good spot” to hang up your food-bag makes for a great sport.   Clearly too much frivolity as I lost control of the swinging food bag and it took flight.  

Interjection by Monarch: I know your not quite there yet but I’ve been singing this ditty all day long whilst thinking of you and have now changed a few lines for this occasion:

“On Top of Old Smokey” Lyrics by Monarch

On top of old Smokey, 
All covered with snow, 
I’ve just lost my food bag 
By moving’ too slow.

It rolled down the steep slope, 
And into a stream, 
 Did this really happen 
 Or am I caught in a dream?   
(Reply by Wow - hey Monarch it did happen and what’s more I was not messing about it was freezing with horizon snow - note to self must have a word to my   poetic editor!!! )
Then for a bit more fun, it was thought to be a good idea to hang a bear proof bag so it was just visible from the hut, that way they  could get a good view and education of exactly what these furry critters get up to when we are not looking!","Nantahala Outdoor Centre

MonarchandWow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607594,"Clearly Monarch is more intuitive than I give her credit for as at the shelter overnight, the rain did indeed turn to snow as the temperature plummeted.   All wet things became frozen, causing some problems starting out in the morning.
And if last night, we thought chasing after flying food bags and swinging them into trees was fun, I can tell you retrieving them this morning was just as good, as most had frozen in situ.
Now, I’m more than used to putting on wet socks and ramming my feet into a pair of soggy boots but attempting to put on a pair of frozen socks was new to me and judging by the expletives coming from all corners of the shelter it was new to others as well.  Everyone was having problems in one form or another but the frozen boot situation was the worst of it, absorbing a good thirty minutes of my time. 
 Well, as most of us know, the only thing to do when cold, is to get moving.  
And so we did, all the while praying for an up hill climb just to warm up.  But what do you know?  Today’s trail was basically down hill to Fontana Dam and needless to say, the covering of snow made some sections pretty tricky under foot. 
At one point I slipped and while my body fell to the right, my sack hit a tree trunk throwing me leftwards, causing a chronic lower back problem to “talk to me”.   I tried to straighten up but could only manage to mimic a half opened pocketknife.
It’s too early in the trip for medical issues, so I opted to stay in a comfortable bed for the night to ensure the back-pain settles down.  I’ve not had a good long soak in a hot tub in years but I had one as soon as I could and things seem to be improving.
 Let’s see what the morrow brings.","Brown Fork Gap

MonarchandWow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607756,"I awoke at dawn and got myself on the track pretty quickly at its awfully cold, so there was no point dawdling around.  I was to be reward, for it was still first light, and as I walked across the Fontana Dam, engineers were releasing water from below.  It was like witnessing a creative process of art right in front of me.  For the water vapour produced as the water gushed forth, landed on the trees and softly and slowly turned them all glistening white, right before my eyes!    
Today is the beginning of the Great Smoky Mountains and I am so looking forward to the privilege of being in its ranges.   The mountains are said to be 2-300 million years old, making them one of the oldest mountain ranges on Earth.  Also known as the Salamander Capital of the World and there are said to be over a hundred species of native trees to be found here (most National Parks are lucky to boast twenty)!  
In this beautiful snowy environment, with the weather crisp and clear, the azure blue sky seemed to go on forever.  Buoyed by such beauty, I ascended above the snow line and then, of course, the breeze began to pick up.  With every tree having wind driven snow on its branches this proved a little tricky as I don't know about you, but anything icy-cold and wet dripping down the back of my neck whilst I'm walking, usually drives me nuts!   The sun lifted in the sky and provided its delicious warmth but now, the slightest wind insured that a personal shower of ice-shards were received and if that didn't drive me mad, an occasional hard lump of ice was thrown in for good measure!  
Well, it was far too icy to climb a fire watchtower that I came across on the ascent so I pressed on towards the next shelter. 
As I reach the shelter, the sun was still shining but the only warm place to be had was in my sleeping bag, which is where I am now.  
Another great day in the hills!   Thank you for sharing it with me.","Fontana Dam

MonarchandWow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607801,"I awoke to everything frozen, including the rubber plugs on my air mattress and pillow. Basically anything with moisture in it was iced.  Slowly I managed to get packed for the day ahead, only to note that my water bottle was also frozen solid.   This was a bit of a problem as all available water on the trail was frozen too.  In fact, the only running water to be had was at the shelter itself.  Note to self:  Empty my water bottle before I go to sleep!
This mornings trek was more like an assault course as the trail took me up and down numerous knolls with ascents and descents that resembled ice chutes.  In summer there would be numerous small streams crossing the trail.  However following heavy rain and floods they freeze over the entire length of the track - which made for slow progress.

 I met a fellow heading south who said he had had enough. I wished him well.
 At one of the shelters where I stopped for lunch (it turned out to be a lump of frozen tuna) and I noted that someone had left a sizeable bag of hiker type food behind. 
 Well today my legs were not interested in walking and told me so on numerous occasions.
 Still it was another beautiful day with clear skies, albeit with an occasional chilly wind.  The icicle showers continued as did the slip sliding - another great, but tiring day on the hill.","Russell Field Shelter

This morning I enjoyed a beautiful sunrise seen from the trail as it took me along a ridge line and into a beautiful pine forest.  Pine forests in the snow are so quiet, and gentle compared to the stony high ridges. 
The trail then led me out onto Clingmans Dome, the highest point on the AT and in the Great Smoky Mountain range, at 6,643 ft.  I hope you’re as impressed as I am!  It feels great to be here!  
The descent once again was via a total ice chute - that was the trail.  It literally went on for miles. If I had known it was going to be like this, I would have brought ice skates and my favourite tutu and made a video clip for Funniest Home Videos.  Needless to say, it made for slow progress and required a great deal of gymnastic ability.
At one stage, with the sun in my eyes and trying to watch my every step, I walked into an over hanging branch which sent me flying backwards, where I ended up flat on my back, like an upside down turtle. 
It was great to see a number of young day hikers out and about, enjoying life. 
As I rambled into Newfound Gap (which is a mountain pass located near the center of the Great Smoky Mountains Nat. Park) I met up with Fresh Grounds and his people providing trail magic.   Many thanks to them all!  They were telling me how thick and extensive the ice was on the trail ahead and I had miscalculated the distance to the next shelter.  So being short of time, I had to quickly thank everyone and head up the hill, as I did not want to be travelling by head torch over this kind of terrain. 
The pizza, doughnuts and coffee (a dieticians nightmare) that Fresh Grounds had provided gave me fuel to cover the last few miles quickly!   Thank you once again, my friend!","Silers Bald Shelter

I started out the same way that yesterday finished.  Picking my way through an ice flow and reminding myself that come spring/summer, this will be an inviting track once more.
As the day progressed the weather closed in with a chilling wind.  My technique on the track alternated between side-to-side ridge walking and/or sliding down a mountainside.  There was little visibility all day. 
I met a couple of hikers doing a trip involving a number of tracks in this National Park. They were saying that it was possible to do nine hundred miles of tracks within its boundaries.
I also met a young female ridge runner who had a huge pack on her back with two large canvases on top.  It must have been hefty.  I hung my head in shame as I thought my pack was heavy!
The day continued to require much concentration and at one point, swinging round a tree to avoid the ice, my water bottle made a bid for freedom and flew down the steep snow covered mountain side.  Let’s just say that retrieving it was not fun.
The Weather Gods sent a another light snow covering which concealed the ice my under boots, making it difficult to detect until it was too late.  Naturally I found a good deal of it and have to admit I don’t bounce like I use to!
Every now and then I get a fleeting glimpse of the solo walker called Hawk who is doing huge miles per day. Fresh Grounds said that he has completed the whole of the Appalachian Trail in only a hundred and nine days!!  At present he is doing a Yo-Yo trip of the AT.

The rain we had in the last twelve hours meant that I woke up to a misty morning and soon discovered that the trail had turned to slush.  No complaints, that's got to be easier than the ice-chutes I’ve been negotiating all week!
The much-welcomed lift in temperature also meant that my trail bars were defrosted and I could chew them rather than gnaw them.
The trail took me ridge walking for most of the morning and descending in the afternoon. 
I had initially decided to stay at one of the shelters but on arrival it was still early.  So after a conversation with my legs, “we” decided to push for Standing Bear Farm Hostel where a shower awaited. 
I passed down to Davenport Gap, which marks the northern end of the Great Smoky Mountains and along the way I met a number of day hikers and runners.  I even had my photo taken with them as they celebrated the fact that I was from Australia. 
Finally I arrived at Standing Bear Farm, which is a beautiful turn of the century farmstead, nestled in the Cherokee National Forest.  The shower was worth the wait and they generously provide room in a clean, comfortable rustic bunkhouse, all up for just $20.

MonarchandWow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607942,"The miles were hard won today, as it was a long slow climb from Standing Bear Farm to Snowbird Peak then a roller coaster trail up and down numerous knolls.   But rather than monotonous it turned out to be quite eventful, for at one point a big athletic-looking young man came hiking past me.  He had jet-black hair, all black clothing, black boots and a black backpack.  Not only that, he was spotless and with not a hair out of place!   I almost expected a booming voice to shout “Cut - get that old scruffy hiker (me) out of there – he’s spoiling the commercial”.  It was quite surreal and, unbeknown to me; it was to set the tone for the day.
By mid afternoon I climbed to the grassy bald known as Max Patch, which gave great 360-degree views of the entire area. There was a cold chilling wind and only a few people on top. 
Just after starting to descend off the summit, following the trail, a large collection of people came into view (see photo to understand what I’m about to describe).  They appeared to be up to all sorts of antics and were spread across the trail. As I approached, I saw an antique chair with a bunch of silk flowers on them.  I then noticed about five “bride and groom"" couples just milling around.  
Just off to the right of the photo there was a “bride and groom” sitting on the grass with fifteen young good-looking females surrounding them, all with good quality cameras, pretending to take photos of this couple. 
Then behind the group of “female photographers“ there is a couple kissing who are also holding cameras while being photographed by other photographers. (Are you confused yet)?    The remaining “bride and grooms” stood separate from each other until a lens was pointed in their direction, then they too would instantly become intimate and Oh, so lovey-dovey!  
As I passed by one young ""groom,"" I offered him my congratulations on his ""wedding"".  To my eye, his dress sense was a tad over the top - I felt he would have been more at home at the Mad Hatters Tea Party. (Hey!  This observation is coming from a bloke who thinks he is the height of fashion when he buys himself a new pair of hiking-trousers).   The only thing I can say about the whole surreal scene, was there were a large number of seriously good quality cameras on display.     
Well back to reality.  Arriving at the shelter I was soon joined by Jim and Britta known collectively as Better Together. I had seen them at Standing Bear Farm the previous night. These guy are clearly well organised and they had completed a three hundred mile training trip.  In describing her experience of the trail today Britta stated, “there had been far too many PUDs (pointless ups and downs)”.  I know where she’s coming from.

I set out pre-dawn, using my head torch to illuminate the way ahead. 
Very slowly by the light of a cool sun the day crept in.  The birds are just stirring and I‘m in awe of the peaceful silence that still hangs in the air.  A stirring in the undergrowth and I look down to see a multi-colored carpet of leaves looking jewel like in this dappled light.  
There’s now an increase in the bird song and the woodpeckers are going to work on the tree trunks, the sound resembles something like the flat ringtone of an old phone. 
Then as I rounded a corner I came face to face with a deer.  We stood looking at each other for a while, and then we both went about our business. 
The morning is in full swing now, and as you would expect on the AT, whenever the trail crosses a gap or road it means that you have to descend down to it and then climb out of it.  Let me tell you there is a large number of gaps and road crossings on this trail!
Just past Deer Park Mountain Shelter off to the left, I noticed a well-worn track. I have always been fascinated by inviting little turn-offs and I found myself wondering where this track went  - I followed my fascination and going about 10 yards of non-trail steps I came across a number of grave sites.  I paid my respects and retraced my steps, then headed off into Hot Springs.","Roaring Fork Shelter

I have been spending time with Britta and Jim along with Raven, Hugs and Zack, as they are all great company. As always, trail talk was the topic of the day and today the mystery behind the full food bag I had seen at one of the shelters was revealed (see journal entry for Wed 6th March).  
It turns out that Jim and Britta – (the Better Together team) were staying at the shelter with some others hikers. The weather was foul and two section-hikers arrived soaked and hypothermic.  
On witnessing one of the hikers audibly shivering uncontrollably Britta quickly alerted Jim.  Seeing the distress of this young man Jim immediately gave his dry clothes to the man put on.  
Turning to the second hiker (who turned out to be the brother of the first) they saw that he too was greatly distressed.   So they quickly got him to lie down between them in their sleeping bags to get him warm.   
This worked. Then in the morning they contacted the Rangers who got the section-hikers and others to take a side trail, where they would pick them up. 
And the big bag of hiking food?  Well, on departing they left all their food behind for others, as it was no longer needed. – Mystery solved!
A huge shout out to Jim and Britta for their selfless actions! - Doing the right thing irrespective of the personal cost. To me this epitomizes the spirit of the trail community. 
I spent the rest of the day resupplying and relaxing.  It was then that I reflected on our 2015 trek on the PCT to Timberland lodge.   I had the whole trail planned. However, for this AT trip I have deliberately not planned too far ahead because I want each day to be, an empty handed leap of faith into the void.

I tossed and turned for the next few hours and then recalled being told that the restaurant down the road was open at 06:00hrs. and served substantial breakfasts. 
Given that dawn is not till about 07.15hrs I paid them a visit. I soon regretted the decision, as there was a sharp and steep climb up from the river location of the restaurant and doing that on a full stomach was mighty uncomfortable.
 While I was in the hostel the couple in the next room introduced themselves.  It turns out that Kevin is a chef and he had samples of food that he had cooked and dehydrated and was wondering if I would be happy to take them on trail with me and send him a review.

I spent them morning following the trail up and down passing a hut.  Then the afternoon was mostly in rhododendron forests and along rocky trails with some exposed ridge walking.  This was made all the more difficult in that the terrain was concealed behind rolling fog driven by strong winds.
I was hoping to do more miles today but at the shelter I met some section hikers who said that there is nowhere to camp until the next shelter, which is another seven miles down the trail. 
Given the strong winds and the large amount of dead trees still standing, I erred on the side of caution and stayed at the shelter.  My body thanked me, especially my left foot, which had been holding a conversation with me for the best part of the day!

The trail ascended to Big Butt Mountain and it had a bypass route! Is this political correctness gone mad? The actual route was a rocky rambling trail.
In the heavy fog I passed Shelton Graves on a spur.  These are the graves of two union soldiers killed on this spot while visiting family in the Confederacy during the Civil War.
 

Now I don’t know about you but I was bought up proper and told not to take sweets from strangers but as a hiker passed me, he turned and asked if I was a thru hiker.  On finding out I was, he said he had some trail magic for me!!!    As if from nowhere he kindly produced a sausage burger still nice and warm.  When I had wolfed that down he then produced a box of three doughnuts all of different flavours:  Amazing!   I had to decline his generous offer of fruit and coke to wash it all down.

So I had camped just above Sams Gap (which is Interstate route 26) in a little spot that was sheltered from the falling temperatures. 
Now, I find myself walking with a chilling, westerly wind. The rising sun is doing little to abate the situation.  As I head down to the pass under the freeway, a particularly chilling wind attempted to snap-freeze me dry!   So I guess you could say in this battle of the elements, the wind is winning!
I climbed to the Big Bald – which as the name suggests, is a cleared hilltop mountain, the highest summit of this Bald Mountains Range, rising to an elevation of 5,516ft.  I can see an interesting building off to the east but I’m not too sure what it is.
The trail is becoming rocker. I passed Bald Mountain Shelter on my way to Little Bald.  The climb then continued up and around High Rock followed by a descent to Spivey Gap.  There’s a nice little campsite here by the stream but I pressed on with the steep climb out of the gap.  I found myself on a very pleasant traverse of a steep-sided valley and that eventually led me to No Business Knob Shelter.
It’s been a long day; I think I might just take off my boots and call it a night.
As I settle in I am reminded of my friend TAZ, a fellow thru-hiker and who is well on his way to his earning a triple crown.  He messaged me saying - “ No rain, No pain, No Maine.” Yep! this I understand.

On our return, Scabs and Young Blood ( a triple crowner) were staying at the hostel and doing trail magic out the back of their bus.  We were treated to sausages imported from Ireland (Happy St Patrick’s day!) with mash potatoes and beer.  (I’m sure you’re all scratching your heads, wondering how we managed to still wolf that lot down – believe me, its possible)!
Scabs shared a story about trekking the PCT and meeting three Australians who had walked together till monument 28 at the Canadian Boarder.  The weird thing was, these three Australians did not know one another until they met up on the PCT even though they all lived, within a stones throw of one another back home in Melbourne!  She kept friends with them and has enjoyed visiting all three of them in Aus.

MonarchandWow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608477,"I’d like to share a few impressions and observations as I come into Cherry Gap Shelter at the end of the day.  Trekking the AT is all quite strange to me, as when I go for a hike I more often than not, go off trail and don’t see a soul for days or even weeks. 
So today really started at 2 am when I was outside Uncle Johnny’s Hostel in my underwear, walking towards the toilet block all the while wondering why the Bladder Gods had failed to give me the 10 hr. bladder that I had diligently prayed for each night.
I got a few more hours rest and then set off at dawn and as usual headed up hill following a stream and crossing it a few times.  When I got to Indian Grave Gap I met a lovely fellow called Brother Tom and his equally engaging bulldog named Moses. They have been providing trail magic for years.  Many thanks for the food, good company and a chat.  Much appreciated.
Then a moment later I found myself pushing hard up hill again but this time not wanting to stop although my body was screaming for a rest but the wind-chill factor informed me that it was not a good option in the given climate!
Then, within the blink of an eye, I found myself talking to Dave in a Pizza Hut.  He is proudly, part Cherokee Indian and an EMS (ambulance) volunteer.  Within no time at all we had discussed life, the universe and spirituality. 

Then there are also, two syndromes that I have noted worthy of mentioning. 
Firstly, the T-Rex syndrome.  I first encountered this on the PCT as all the young fella’s had gotten their bodies into fine shape for the trek and were really quite concerned about maintaining and indeed, improving their good looks.  They soon discovered that their calves and thighs were getting bigger by the day whereas their arms were loosing condition and shrinking in size due to lack of use.  Maybe that's why they get Hiker Hunger; after all, Tyrannosaurus Rex was one of the biggest meat eaters!(I have ordered my trail legs from Amazon- they should arrive any day now!!)The second is “Hiker Brain”.   This is where all your energy goes on hiking with a sack on your back and little energy is left for non-essential things like thinking!  If you were to ask me what mile I am at, you’d get an instant answer and the same goes for what gear I’m carrying and how many days food I have onboard.  Outside of that, there’s usually a short pause as I desperately try to retrieve the information required before answering. Ask me what is happening in the world and there will be a very long pause followed by an answer like “Dah… I guess the world has not ended as I am still hiking”.
 Pat OD left a message asking how Monarch can be writing when she is back in Tasmania?  If you ask me, I send Monarch good comprehensive notes, which she proofreads, then possibly spell checks before putting it up on the web site.  In reality what actually happens is, I send Monarch “ hiker brain” ramblings with confusing notes.  Monarch knows me and knows my hiker brain as well and is able translate and assemble some form of a blog. The major thing with the exercise, is that it polishes the connection between us while I am out here walking.  Many blessings Monarch and thank you x
While I’m at it, a big shout out to Meg McKay back home in Tassy, who Monarch tells me has been following the blogs. I’m still feeling that big hug you gave me in Exeter.

Young Blood had been leaving “trail magic” on the track for future hikers.  This is a great kindness, which is felt by all trekkers who come across these generous stashes.  Whilst in America, I have known them to consist of an icebox full of cool drinks and edibles, all the way up to walking into an area in the middle of nowhere and seeing a lovely shady spot decked with tables, chairs, drinks etc.  Indeed, one trail angel on the PCT even managed to set up a portable shower facility!  We don't have anything like this back home in Australia that I know of (but that’s probably because I’m off trekking somewhere very remote), their idea of a shower is a leap of faith off a rock into a pristine, ice-cool waterhole.
Anyway, what do you know, today was another hard slog!  The legs felt like lead weights swinging from my hips and like the old pendulum clock at home, they had the rhythm of an old squeaky gate rather than a quick, brisk tick-tock motion.  (Steady on Monarch- You cut me deep Shrek)
The climb from Hughes Gap to the shelter was all ascents.  The higher I ascended the more ice had to be negotiated over frozen ground.  I was concerned that there may be no water at the shelter so I picked up two litres at the lower campsite.  However, at the end of the day I was happy to see the water is running at Roan Shelter which is amazing considering its the highest shelter on the whole of the AT!  How do they do it?","Cherry Gap Shelter

I was just settling down to sleep when the door from outside opened and what a beautiful picture. Framed by the doorway, the light of a roaring fire illuminated the three youngsters.  Then two of the girls, obviously well practiced, started singing songs with great harmonies, which lasted about thirty minutes.  They were just singing to the Universe.  It was absolutely transfixing. Totally true and the best form of trail magic!   
The next morning I continued to make my way up, down and through the Balds.  The trail went through some lovely woodland with open vistas.
Arriving at Highway 19E I soon found myself on a free shuttle ride from the trailhead to Station Hostel.  It’s a really good place and was responsible for the free shuttle ride. 
On arrival, Eddie and his dog Gizmo gave me the grand tour. The operation is smooth and the people are friendly and professional. There is a large bunk room and you can sign your name on a bed that you choose for yourself. Each bed has a draw curtain to give the sleeper privacy. There’s also a bar, which serves draft beers and food. 
On going to the bar/tap room, I was delighted to find my first beer was free. Wondering how this worked, I was introduced to the “pour it forward"" board, where you pay for a future hiker to have a beer or food.  What a great idea!  I signed up.","Roan High Knob Shelter

MonarchandWow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608635,"At the hostel I met up with Johnnie Walker, Bill and Muffet. Bill had fallen and injured himself on trail and was calling it a short day so he could rest up at the hostel.

When Dave (the owner of the Station Hostel) gave me a shuttle back to the trailhead, he warned me that sleet / snow was the predicted weather for the afternoon.
The trail gave me some gentle miles along a river.  Then by mid afternoon it did indeed start snowing.   
On arriving at the shelter two young ladies had put their tent up in the shelter and hung a tarp for protection.  This was a very smart move, as the wind was blowing hard and the snow was being driven directly into the shelter and onto my sleeping gear!There was not enough room to follow suit so I employed some other inventive strategies to protect the gear. 
The situation in this little shelter is further complicated by the arrival of another hiker.   I understand there’s no such thing as a full hut but it’ll be interesting to see what else the night brings.
Meanwhile I’ll try to get some shut-eye.  Night-night!","Highway 19E - Station Hostel

MonarchandWow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608636,"Last night at the shelter, it would have been a different story if the young ladies had not hung their large tarpaulin up for wind protection. 
The shelter is small so the tarp covered most of area exposed to the wind; that is except for the section where myself and the other hiker were sleeping.  It was pretty uncomfortable with the wind driven snow being blow directly onto our down sleeping bags and gear.  I had to use my waterproof rucksack liner over the bottom of my sleeping bag and mat to protect them.  Thankfully I was warm but the wind chill factor was serious, as I found out every time I lifted my head out of my sleeping bag.  This was not a situation to be taken lightly. 
The next morning, while we were still attempting to protect ourselves from the elements, Miss T and Grease Ball (the young ladies who had set up their tent in the shelter) were cooking up a storm from within, which included bacon sandwiches - it smelt delicious. 
We were all pretty keen to get on trail early and get moving out of this icy wind. It was still dark as we ventured out into the pristine snow. Thankfully the trail took us up hill, which got us generating some heat and we were able to maintain that warmth, till the sun came up and took over. 
The highlight of this part of the trail is the stunning Laurel Fork Gorge.   To get there we walked along a lovely peaceful riverbank and them climbed up high to traverse along the top of this steep-sided gorge.   Then suddenly, we found ourselves dropping down, down, down almost to the bottom and continued to follow the track as it went winding around a rock buttress just a few feet above the rushing river.   Stunning!
A little later Bill caught up with me but soon showed me a clean pair of heels as he disappeared down the trail. 
Naturally, there was a steep long haul out of the gorge.   As I chugged my way upwards, the child’s nursery rhyme “The Grand old Duke of York“ kept playing in my head.   As the climb progressed the rhyme changed to:
The Old AT Designers
Had many hikers to strain
So they zig-zagged up to the top of the hill

And they zig-zagged them down again!

Well strain I did, but I managed to catch Bill again when I checked into the ‘Boot Off hostel’ and negotiated a shuttle to Shirley’s all you can eat diner.  Judging by the look on the young waitress’s face, I don’t think she had seen thru-hikers with “hiker hunger” before.
The bunkroom at this hostel is warm, well built but the bunks spaces are quite compact making me wonder if the designer / builder was a sub mariner in a previous life? 
Thankfully, I've been able to have my sleeping bag put through the dryer to remove any moisture. 
But even better, there’s a good phone service here, so I've managed to have a nice long chat with Monarch - all is right with the world.","Moreland Gap Shelter

MonarchandWow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608698,"Dare I say that this morning, I was as hungry as a bear?  Just as well the price of the bed last night included a hearty breakfast.  For despite eating a pretty substantial meal the night before, Bill and I still managed to tuck in like there was no tomorrow. 
Having had our fill, we sauntered on down the trail towards the edge of Watauge Lake, which is actually a reservoir.  I think the old township of Butler, Tennessee lies beneath the surface, minus the residents of course; they got moved to “New” Butler just in time.  
Then following the ridge line as it gained height, I met a number of day hikers.   I also passed Silverfox and Duke who were camping. Then I came upon Vandeventer Shelter, which is in a spectacular location. 
Finally I arrived at Iron Mountain Shelter where I soon discovered a large number of scouts all mucking about in their hammocks.  Ging Gang Goolie, anyone?    This should be an interesting night.  Maybe I’ll pass it by telling you a story in honour of my fellow companions for the night:
 The Ging Gang Goolie Yarn
This yarn goes with the Ging Gang Goolie Song.
During the first World Jamboree B-P was looking for a song that everyone could sing, no matter what their language was.  Ging Gang Gooli was the result.  It is of no language, but it means a lot of fun.  The story was apparently created later.In the deepest darkest Africa there is a legend concerning the Great Grey Ghost Elephant.  Every year, after the rains, the Great Grey Ghost Elephant rose from the mists and wandered throughout the land at dawn.  When he came to a village, he would stop and sniff the air, and then he would either go around the village or through it.  If he went around the village, the village would have a prosperous year, if he went through it, there would be hunger and drought.The village of War-Cha had been visited three years in a row by the elephant and things were very bad indeed.  The village leader, Ging-Ganga was very worried, as was the village medicine man Ha-la-shay.  Together, they decided to do something about the problem.  Now Ging-Gang and his warriors were huge men with big shields and spears.  They decided to stand in the path of the elephant and shake their shields and spears at it to frighten it away.  Hay-la-shay and his followers were going to cast magic spells to deter the elephant by shaking their medicine bags as the elephant approached which made the sound  shallawaly, shallawaly, shallawaly.Very early in the morning of the day the Great Grey Ghost Elephant came, the villagers gathered at the edge of the village, on one side were Ging-Ganga and his warriors, (indicate right) and on the other was Hay-la-shay and his followers (indicate left).  As they waited the warriors sang softly about their leader Ging gang gooli, gooli, gooli, gooli, watcha, Ging Gang goo, Ging gang goo, Ging gang gooli, gooli, gooli, gooli, watcha, Ging gang goo, Ging gang goo.As they waited the medicine men sang of their leader Heyla, heyla sheyla, Heyla, sheyla, heyla ho, Heyla, heyla sheyla, Heyla sheyla, heyla ho.As they shook their medicine bags, shalli-walli, shalli-walli, shalli-walli, shalli-walli.  And from the river came the mighty Great Grey Ghost Elephant’s reply, Oompa, oompa, oompa….The elephant came closer, so the warriors beat their shields and sang louder (signal warriors to stand and beat their thighs in time).  Ging gang gooli, gooli, gooli, gooli, watch, Ging gang goo, Ging gang goo, Ging gang gooli, gooli, gooli, gooli watch, Ging Gang goo, Ging gang goo.The medicine men rose and sang loudly, Heyla, heyla sheyla, Heyla, sheyla, heyla ho, Heyla, heyla sheyla, Heyla sheyla, heyla ho.  And they shook their medicine bags, Shalli-walli, shalli-walli, Shalli-walli, shalli-walli.  And the mighty grey elephant turned aside and went around the village saying Oompa, oompa, oompa…There was great rejoicing in the village and all the villagers joined together to sing … Ging gang gooli …From:  Australian Scout, August 1996","Boots Off Hostel and Campground

MonarchandWow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608773,"Last night we all made room for Co-Op as he had arrived to join us in the shelter. He knew Bill and before you know it, we were all catching up on the trail talk, checking out who was where on the track.  
The next morning I managed to get out on trail at sunrise – it looked like it was going to be a lovely day.   I met a few day hikers as I walked towards Uncle Nick Grindstaff Monument.  Nick was the son of Isaac Grindstaff and Mary Heaton. He and three siblings were orphaned at an early age, and raised by relatives. Like young men back then, he sold his share of the family property and went west to seek his fortune.   However, he was robbed of all his assets, so he returned to Tennessee and eventually settled on the highest peak of Iron Mountain on the county line between Johnson and Carter Counties (between Doe Valley and Stoney Creek). For over forty years he lived as a hermit, building himself a hut made of logs and boards. He cleared land, built fences, had a garden and gathered roots and herbs which he traded for supplies. He was found dead in his bed one day, guarded by his favourite dog. Local men laid him to rest near his cabin, next to the Appalachian Trail and now the Cherokee National Forest maintains the monument that marks his burial site.  In case you can’t make out the inscription in the photo, it reads: ""Lived alone, suffered alone, and died alone.""
Having paid my respects, and moving on, Co-Op and Bill kept leap frogging me as they both pushed for the town of Damascus.  I decided to push on to Stealth Camp so that tomorrow I would not be tempted to take a Nero. 
That is tomorrow, if I have to walk about 10 miles to get to town I would be tempted to get a hostel overnight and get my re-supply together.   But, if I only have 6 miles or less to go, I would get into town re-supply and head straight-off back on the trail and get a few more miles under my belt for the day.
Don’t worry, if this sounds a little convoluted – its all good in my head!
Oh, and before I forget, some friends back home have been asking what I mean by Slackpacking: Well its backpacking without all that hard work of carrying gear or having to sleep outside.  While I might be setting up camp or sleeping in a lean-to (shelter), a slackpacker is jumping into a car and either driving home or driving to a hostel/hotel each night, all the better to enjoy the dignity and convenience of indoor plumbing and sleeping arrangements.","Iron Mountain Shelter

MonarchandWow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608957,"I arose early and headed down trail. I’d like to say that I caught up with Bill but I’m pretty sure he was walking slowly so I could catch up to him.  Anyway, together we descended into Damascus and head straight for the diner.   
Naturally, I am in hiker-hunger mode but there is a little trepidation coursing through my veins as I enter the facility.  Please understand, I’m all for having a choice but in Australia, you simply walk into a café and order a big breakfast.  The reply comes “No worries” and within minutes a big hearty breakfast is in front of you.  Done.  
But in the States, the waitress smiles, and holding a pen and paper at the ready, she quickly fires off a whole barrage of options!  Woo! My poor hiker-brain. Previously this would force me to retreat under the table and then to come out, shyly stuttering like Oliver Twist “Please miss, can I, just have some food”?
But today I was ready.  I took a deep breath and trying to walk nonchalantly, I took my seat.  Then when the questions came rapidly, like cards being dealt at a casino table, I fired back in equal quick succession, my well-rehearsed reply.  No Worries!
And to add to my arsenal, under Bill’s tutelage, I was educated in the correct way to eat biscuits and gravy.   For folks back home; it is basically a scone with white sauce +/- sausage bits randomly sticking out of it.  Looks a bit like an unformed cosmos!  However, it is with some degree of satisfaction that I can say, learning and appreciation has occurred.  
And talking of food, I’m pleased to report that my re-supply plans are working out. I’ve brought five days food to carry, posted five days food ahead of me and re-directed my bounce box  further down the track. Now with a “Subway” in the top of my sack I am happily back on trail!   Oh! And I have sent to REI for my “trail legs” hopefully they will be coming soon!
Oh yes, and I was going to mention that I met “Shiner” and “Jack” who are thru hikers but they were slack packing a section because Shiners wife was in town and if the truth be known I think one of them was sensibly trying to avoid the that rain was forecast!    I chatted with Jack who at sixty-eight years old, was telling me about his “twenty-mile days”.  We had a laugh about us oldies still being able to perform.
The rain came and was steady for most of the day.  Strangely I quite enjoyed it as I made my way up the steep climb to the hut.   Must have been all that good food!","Stealth Camp

MonarchandWow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609054,"I made another early start and feelings of disorientation began to visit me as I climbed the long ascents shrouded in dense fog.   
It is in the cold pre-dawn with the trail inclining that the eyes are fixed on the pool of light cast by the head torch.  The mouth is open and the audible rhythm of the in-breath and out-breath can be heard.  The rhythm of the arms swinging backwards and forwards with the rhythmical “click” and “clack” of the trekking poles contacting the ground.  The rhythm of the legs pumping forwards and backwards with a “crunch” and a “munch” as the boots hit the ground and the “squeak “ and “ eekk “ of the rucksack as the hips roll.When all these rhythms are in harmony the miles appear to come effortlessly and you watch as the mind lifts to thoughts and images of Maine- Baxter- Katahdin.
However when the rhythms are discombobulated the poles trip the feet up, the rucksack hurts and is heavy - in fact everything hurts and you watch as the mind looks for the next road or hostel to take a zero at least. In these times you focus the mind on the rhythms of the in/ out breath, the “click” and “clack” and the “ crunch” and “munch”. As long as these are present forward motion should happen - just a little further......”This too shall pass”........
Such is the Rhythms of the Walk.

(The only rhythm not mentioned is the nasal drip rhythm, which does its own thing and is not a team player)

When I eventually reached the top I felt like I was in the wild landscape of Dartmoor, back in the UK.   That’s very bleak indeed and usually blanketed in low-lying cloud of dark extended gloom!   
Later that day I met Shiner who was a southbound slack packer. He’s wife Ju Ju was in the area so naturally they wanted to spend time together.   We took time to chat for a moment then, he choose to tell that Ju Ju was providing some trail magic in the next day or so but that I would miss out. When I protested that he should not have told me, he was already disappearing in the mist but I did catch his wave and a promise that he would make it up to me!
Finally I arrived at Thomas Knob Shelter and the fog cleared and the sun came out revealing fabulous vistas. At the entrance to the shelter a wild donkey had taken up residency hoping for food. 
 Monarch interjects:  Really, WoW?  Since when do donkeys have long flowing tails?  – It must be all that disorientation – you’d better take a rest!)
 On a practical note:  The spring here is very poor and I would suggest you collect water prior to your arrival.","Saunders Shelter

MonarchandWow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609069,"I am in the Grayson Highland, which has forests like those on nearby Mount Rogers, as well as a number of mountain meadows or balds. These meadows provide excellent views of the surrounding area and present a striking change in scenery from the surrounding forests. The balds are dominated by large rocky out croppings, clear of vegetation excepting the occasional windswept tree and low grasses.  Following the trail by headlight over the rock outcrops this morning made for an interesting trek.  And later, this area was all the more stunning when seen by the light of a silvery moon. The Thomas Knob shelter I stayed at last night was comfortable enough but of course, with the lack of cloud cover during the night it was again, pretty chilled.   The wild ponies decided to do a hoof dance with accompanying vocals at four o’clock this morning!  Needless to say, I did not get back to sleep so I was on trail by 5 am and greeted by a crisp frost.
Still by torch light, I was looking forward to experiencing the “Fatman Squeeze” which as the name suggests is a very narrow rock tunnel but I was initially unable to find it and had to turn back southwards before finding the narrow walkway between a cliff and a boulder which leads to it. The trail itself bypasses it. 
Much later that day, further down the track I had some trail magic from a trail maintenance crew - thank you!
I met Tar a seventy-two year old, who was about to complete his flip flop of the AT.  Well Done!  I know he has forged ahead despite the recent circumstances of his dear mother getting ill and unfortunately dying and around that time Tar also broken his leg!  A great display of fortitude and resilience, I take my hat off to you! 
I arrived at the shelter after a long day and I soon had the company of America, Ewok and J3.  Another hiker with an enormous 70 lb. pack arrived.  He hadn’t earned his trail name yet but that was to change, as Ewok named him Atlas!

MonarchandWow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609071,"Yesterday’s high mileage was due more to my suffering “hiker brain” and not being able to do my sums rather than an attempt to do big distances.  As a rule, I consider it a good day if I get between eighteen and twenty miles completed! 
You know, back at home I’m a bit of a “late owl” rather than an “early-bird” but I seem to have no trouble at all getting up early and being on trail pre-dawn most mornings.   I was moving well to start with but then I re- injured my left Achilles’ tendon, which has caused me to hobble a bit. 
I was mainly ridge walking today, which brings the added bonus of actually get phone reception high up on the hill.   Monarch and I had not spoken in a few days and although I was aware that it was around midnight back in Tasmania I gave her a call. Yeah!  All is all right in the world.  It always does me good to hear her voice.  
I arrived at the Partnership Shelter near the Mount Rogers National Recreation HQ.  An impressive shelter but as someone was fast asleep in the upper tier I did not go exploring.  The shower is none functional.  
Then J3, America and Ewok arrived and were discussing their plans to resupply in Marion. 
My initial plan has been to resupply as close to the trail as possible to avoid hiking / shuttle to near by towns which I have managed to date.  However, I needed to get strapping for my left Achilles’ tendon.  
So I started walking and hitching but the road was winding with very narrow verges so I did ‘t fancy my chances.  However a fellow pulled up and offered me a lift. He had been a thru hiker back in the 1990’s.  He was glad to be of service and drove me to town and offered to return me to where he picked me up at bit later. Great trail magic!   
For the record, the tape made little difference to my tendon. Word on the trail is, I should invest in a low cut trail shoe rather than the mid ankle boots I am wearing - the jury is out on this one.
I got to Atkins and booked into the Relax Hotel.  I was trying to decide whether to take a zero tomorrow or not - however my mind was kind of made up for me when I experienced the standard of accommodation.

When I did get underway, I found myself enjoying a lovely walk in the woods, with a relatively easy trail taking me across farmer’s fields.
But meeting up with Mad Dash (Aca) and his big brother T. has got to be the highlight!  The last time I met them was in North Carolina where Mad Dash was making snacks for the two of them.  It was memorable, as I had watched him place a ‘quarter’ of a very large jar of peanut butter into a burrito before neatly wrapping it up!
I’m not the only one in awe of their capacity to eat anything moving.  The brothers had been re-named the Tape Worm Brothers by Fresh Grounds (a trail angel), as he could not fill them up!  
Clearly these jovial brothers are much liked, as when Fresh Grounds found out it was Mad Dash’s birthday, he went ahead on the trail and hung a birthday cake from a branch where they’d see it - when stumbled upon by the now delighted brothers, it was eagerly demolished.  Yum!

This morning, seeing the weather forecast is for a good down pour of rain, I planned to push hard and get myself into Jenkins Shelter, which is twenty miles from here.  
I spent the morning crawling up switchbacks of course and that was before I grunted my way directly up the steep spine of a ridge. But then came the rewards.  The mountain tops out at 4,400 ft. into a beautiful open meadow called Chestnut Knob! The shelter here is an old fire-wardens hut.   Moving on through the open forest on the northern slope I came to a gap in the canopy and as I looked out through the clearing, I was greeted by vast panoramic views of the southern end of Burkes Garden.   
Burke’s Garden is an oval, bowl-like valley that was once a seabed but now very fertile farmland.  Apparently it looks like a large volcanic crater in satellite photographs (about 8 miles long and 4 miles wide) but was in fact formed when underground limestone caverns collapsed (in other words, a giant sink hole).  As for the name, it is said that when the area was first surveyed back in 1748 one of the party, namely James Burke, threw away some potato peelings whilst cooking in the area.  When they returned a year later, it was said they found potato’s growing there!  Hence as a joke it was dubbed Burke’s garden and the name just stuck.  
The trail had us weaving in and out of the escarpment at the northern side of the rim for another eight miles. It is a lovely section of the trail.

As I wasn't going to hang around making breakfast I decided to munch on a pop-tart whilst trying to climb uphill.  What a laugh, if the puffing and panting didn't make eating difficult, the full-blown nasal drip ensured it nigh on impossible.  So totally out of rhythm, I think I might have inhaled the pop-tart!
Despite having had two dinners the night before I soon found myself feeling as though I was running on empty.  It was not that the miles were hard today it was the yards!  I witnessed my mind whispering sweet suggests of a Nero or a Zero break at the next stop.
The only thing to do was to head downwards – My mind began to focus:  In breath, out breath. Then came the sound of my sticks, click and clack.  Followed by my boots, crunch and munch.  All the while I am telling myself “This too will pass”.   
Eventually I got to the road and headed to Trent’s Grocery to get some fuel for this machine that was having difficulties performing today and to look at having a zero.
I arrived and ordered two enormous burgers with chips.  As I sat there eating like there was no tomorrow, whilst trying to drown myself in a bucket of piping hot coffee, an elderly local wondered across the floor and wanted to know my history. 
It turns out he was an eighty-year old retired Cardiologist.  I felt myself recoil slightly, fearing that I would get a lecture about healthy eating.  However when his food arrived I saw that he had ordered a hot dog with the works and a big bucket of coke.  He took one look at my surprised expression and said, “We all have to die of something”!  With that, we decided we would sit in the “naughty corner” and talk about things other than “ healthy eating”.
Well after some great company and good tucker, I decided to carry on and hit the trail feeling greatly revived. It was obviously a food issue.
It was a quite a gentle trail for the rest of the day, alternating between dense hardwood forests and the more open rhododendron forests with flowing streams. 
In what seemed, no time at all, I arrived at the Wapiti Shelter and was greeted by a large number of both section and thru hikers.

Over the last few days I’ve been having trouble with right lower leg shin splints.  I had the same problem on the PCT back in 2015 and I know they can be a game changer. 
As it was, the shin splints ensured a slow and painful afternoon as I made a long descent into Pearisburg. 
Bill was also feeling the impact of the high mileage he'd been doing over the last few days, so that he could catch up.   By the way Bill has now accepted the trail name “Hound” which was unanimously decided upon by the lads back at the last shelter, ‘because he was always trying to catch up to someone’. 
Thru hikers, B and Mouse came whizzing past, as did the Tape Worm Brothers and Sundowner.
Finally we all reached the bottom of the decent where we called for a shuttle to the Angels Rest Hostel.  There we did the usual but not before being introduced to the fine array of haute couture which was offered to us on loan, until such time as our laundry was done.  There are a number of hostels that offer this ‘perk’ to thru hikers, if only to save embarrassment to other guests and the hikers themselves, as inevitably they are not carrying spare clothes to change into!  
And believe me, (or take as closer look if you dare, at the above photo) this makes for some very interesting choices of attire.  It took Hound six hours before he could tell me that I had girlie shorts on!  And if you think that's bad, this is what I was wearing when I sauntered into the restaurant – there is no shame when a man’s hungry!

Not wanting to do this in the bunkroom, I went outside and having pulled up my trouser leg, began shaving the area to be taped.

Secondly, here's a random photo of an Ozzy's idea of a Christmas Tree.  I didn't get a chance to share this with you earlier and well, what else is there to do when your held up with a gammy leg, other than to flick through photo's on your iPhone?????
Being that this is my second zero the “ hiker brain” is starting to relax and defocus on the daily task of getting from A-B.  
So, I’m now witnessing my brain firing up with and array of abstract thoughts.  And as I try to stand back and watch the process I begin to detect the “poor me” syndrome wanting to rise.  Permission to quiver the bottom lip!
Here I am, essentially a homeless foreigner, wandering in a northerly direction on a trail that's only a foot wide, hoping to walk the entire length of two thousand, one hundred and ninety miles with a doggy leg! (Cue the violins and the sympathetic tear-jerking music).   On that train of thought, I’d better jump the carriage.
Angels Rest Hostel is a great place to stay.  The staff is friendly and helpful and has provided good, clean accommodation.  
As I write this I am lying in a hammock and I’m pretty impressed with it.  A number of thru hikers are using them on their trek. I might just get one for myself and give it a whirl.  
I mentioned this to Monarch and of course, she cracked up laughing as in her mind, she was picturing me either taking a flying leap to get in it, only to twirl round and round until I’m wrapped up like a cocoon, or I forget to put my sticks down and try to climb on board with them and almost break a leg in the process!    Nice one Monarch!  
Hound headed out early this morning stating that he was going to do big miles.   He’s been doing a great job and yesterday was his first zero of the trip! I do wish him well. 
I have resupplied for the next five days and I’ve booked my shuttle back to the trail for 07.00 hrs. tomorrow along with Underdog, Magic Mike and ‘merica.   

It’ll be great to hear the steady rhythm of click and clack and crunch and munch again.  They have been sorely missed (if you’ll excuse the pun)!","Pearisburg

MonarchandWow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609883,"Remember Shiner who back in March, who kindly joked with me that I was to miss out on some trail-magic that his wife was rustling up for hikers?  Well, yesterday he and his wife Ju Ju arrived, as they were bringing hikers from the trail head to the hostel.   Not long after this, J3 came cruising in.  Then to my absolute delight, Ju Ju produced some beautiful homemade iced cakes, which I can assure you, were delicious.  Thank you Ju Ju, your kind effort was very much appreciated by all of us.  And Shiner my friend, all has been forgiven.

The shuttle from Angels Rest Hostel did a good job of getting us back to the trail head and dropped us off so that we could start at the exact same spot that each had come off at. 
It was raining, with a rolling fog and wind. At one point, I vaguely heard Magic Mike calling out to me. My head was down, the hood of my jacket was up and my mind was busy thinking about all sorts of things. 
As it was I had missed the turning.  I gradually became conscious of this fact as my mind unraveled that eerie call I had heard on the wind and I realized what had been conveyed to me.  Many thanks Magic Mike; there is nothing worse than doing “non trail” miles. 
The first shelter I called in at, I met Two Ways who gave his directions to a water source, which was of poor quality and had little flow so I had a dry stretch of walking.
I kept going, best I could but when I noticed it was still early in the afternoon and I only had another five miles to do, I slowed my pace down to help my r) lower leg that had been “talking” to me since starting the walk. Hopefully it will run out of conversation one day soon!   See what the morrow brings.","Pearisburg

MonarchandWow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609884,"Well today started well!  I got off to an early start, with the trail dropping to a road, followed by a long steep climb to a shelter. 
All was going well until the trail became sections of boulder-hopping which ripped my r) lower leg and caused all kinds of problems. This ensured I would limp and also it felt like someone had “unplugged” me. This was very unsettling. 
My initial plan was to do about 18 miles to Laurel Shelter but that plan had to be modified to the War Spur Shelter.
Magic Mike and Underdog were at the shelter and two other section hikers all of whom complained about the on trail boulder hopping causing them pain.  Nothing to be done, but to take it one day at a time. 
 

On a lighter note - While I was having a double zero, Catmando, Lucky and Togs had resupplied in Pearisburg and got back on trail. 
I tell you this because of the jungle drums beat loud.  As people move at a different pace and most hikers stay at shelters, the “Trail Gossip” is strong. 
 I have heard a lot about Togs; a fellow Australian who emigrated from the UK.  Despite never having met her, she is almost family! 
Now that they’re ahead of me I’m getting friendly comments like “Where are you Wow”?  In this photo you can see the type of message to be found on the trail.   It’s very heart warming and gives the morale a boost and let’s face it, all good fun!  
Well I’ve made it to the shelter and Co-op has just arrived having set out from Pearisburg at 6 am and has just completed a 33-mile day!   I saw him at Angel Rest Hostel where he was staying for 5 days so that he could attend to a number of interviews for teaching jobs.  He’s planning another 30+-mile day tomorrow.  Must remember to ask him exactly what type of cereal he eats for breakfast!","Pine Swamp Shelter

An early start was needed so there would be enough time to consider different options should my leg play up. 

I headed out on the trail, which dropped to a road then gave me a steep long climb. 
Thankfully I had a welcomed change in pace and scenery as I found myself crossing a number of farmer’s paddocks. (a paddock is the Aussie term for a field)
Then more climbing and a ridge walk that required “angled slab traversing”.  
It was a full, tiring day. I kept leapfrogging Underdog and Magic Mike.
I have now arrived at the shelter. The rain has started and seems to be getting heavier.
Honesty time- the short entries are as much due to challenging psychological / emotional states as due to tiredness. However even when the mind gives attention to these transient thoughts it still is a great place to be - on trail.Dear Reader just a quick ps. When Monarch starts seeing these transient states creeping in her response is quick and decisive.

MonarchandWow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610052,"Guess what?  I was up early. 
The trail descended to a road then it took a long steep climb and followed a ridge walk to the Audie Murphy monument.  
Audie Leon Murphy (20 June 1925 – 28 May 1971) was born into a large family of sharecroppers in Hunt County, Texas. He was one of the most decorated American combat soldiers of World War II. He received every military combat award for valour available from the U.S. Army, as well as French and Belgian awards for heroism. Murphy received the Medal of Honour for valour that he demonstrated at the age of 19 for single-handedly holding off an entire company of German soldiers for an hour at the Colmar Pocket in France in January 1945, then leading a successful counterattack while wounded and out of ammunition.   As you can imagine, he suffered from what would today be described as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).   Murphy slept with a loaded handgun under his pillow. In his last few years, he was plagued by money problems but refused offers to appear in alcohol and cigarette commercials because he did not want to set a bad example.  Shortly before his 46thbirthday, Murphy died in a plane crash here on Brush Mountain, not far from Catawba, Virginiain 1971.  In 1974, the Christiansburg Post of the Veterans of Foreign Wars erected a monument (Shown in this photo) to honour him.  He was interred with full military honours at Arlington National Cemetery, where his grave is one of the most visited.    

So having paid my respects, I continued on the trail as it descended down to a road and then followed a long steep climb and a ridge walk to the Dragons Tooth which is a rock monolith of Tuscarora quartzite straddling Craig and Roanoke Counties just west of Catawba. I was well rewarded, as the rock stands out on its own at the top of Cove Mountain and was even more impressive than I thought it would be.  (See the photo on my blog site).  

A storm was gathering and I could detect thunder and lightning off in the distance. It started raining and I thought it best to get going as the descent from Dragons Tooth entails a bit of a rock scrambling and I could do well without it being wet underfoot on these slippery rocks! 
Too late, the heavens have opened up and I’m in a deluge; nothing for it but to put my head down and descend as quickly and as safely as possible. 
As I look back, today’s trail was great and despite being hard it was also enjoyable.
I finally arrived at the road and my intended campsite was looking very wet indeed.  Feeling not much better myself, I turned on my heels and made my way to the nearby shop for a pizza.   From there Underdog made a phone call to the Four Pines Hostel, as we need to get myself warm and dry.
I can’t tell you how blissful the steaming hot showers are in this place! Now, feeling clean, warm and well fed, I’m ready to get my head down for the night.   The problem is, that lights out is 10 pm, which is way past “hiker midnight”!  And I do so need my beauty sleep but there are a few section hikers here who seem to have “ lost” the volume control!   Am I beginning to sound like a grumpy old man or what?
Before I sign off for the day I just want to give a big thanks to Lee for the words of encouragement. Thanks my friend, the shin splint problem is definitely improving.","Niday Shelter

MonarchandWow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610053,"I awoke from a rather poor nights sleep at the Four Pines Hostel still mustn’t complain as I am well rested at least and my clothes are all dry.
The day got underway at 7:15 as Underdog ,Magic Mike and myself headed off towards McAfee Knob.  This spot is considered to be the most scenic point along the Appalachian Trail and offers panoramic views of the Catawba Valley  (1,600 ft. below).  The lads were planning to stay in this stunning location to create some amazing video footage of the sunset and sunrise.  
But along the way, as we arrived a VA route 311 also sorts of dramas were unfolding. A large truck was pulled over and had its enormous engine hood open. Milling around were Firemen, Ambulance officers and support crew. As we watched additional people kept turning up along with more fire engines, ATV’s with stretchers were being unloaded by yet more support crew.   I’m still none the wiser as to what it was all about and eventually I left the spectacle and moved on with the day.  
We passed a few huts and then arrived at McAfee Knob.  I stood high on the cliff in awe of the mighty great vistas - it was indeed a feast for the eyes! 
We took the time to have lunch here and then after the obligatory photos I said farewell to the YouTube duo and headed on down the trail, which took me to Tinker Cliffs with further great views. 
I wanted to get close to Daleville where I needed to resupply.  I was able to stealth camp on the cliffs overlooking the valley and was treated to a great sunset. 
Looking back, the day was full of great vistas, the leg is improving but best of all, I was able to talk to Monarch.   So all in all, my world is in excellent shape! 
I bid you goodnight from the best Stealth campsite of the trip - to date!","Four Pines Hostel
",Stealth Camp,"Apr 09, Tue",19
MonarchandWow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610132,"The picture today is my “Oh! What a Feeling” moment on top of McAfee Knob.
The last time I felt this good was as a young lad, having climbed the face of Half Dome in Yosemite and then posing nonchalantly on “the Visor” at the summit.   I went back there whilst on the PCT in 2015 but of course, took the cable route and was shamefully shaky as I looked out at the top.  I can even remember (whilst my knees were shaking) begging my friend who was taking a photo to “hurry up”!   

You know, come to think of it, quite a few people have asked me:  “Why Walk the AT”?
There are as many answers to this question as there are people doing the trail.
For me walking the AT allows for the simplicity of life to reveal itself.

However in that simplicity there is a depth of understanding that is not available to most folk in daily living.

As the mind defocuses the illusory belief of the boundary between the inside self and outside world is revealed and dissolves allowing for the true celebration of life to manifest or be revealed.

The mind may asks the question “why walk the AT” however it is direct experience that answers on a daily basis.


And on that note, I woke early and was pretty quick in getting up and on trail, as I was heading to Daleville today. 

Don’t laugh, a hiker that I met at the last shelter casually told me that the trail today was all down hill, and I fell for it!  
Usually its me telling couples who are obviously new to the outdoor environment (you can tell because they look pretty and smell nice) that there’s a cappuccino machine set up at the top of the next ridge.  
Anyway this resulted in an incline being begrudgingly ascended and then the trail showed me Daleville far below but as if to add insult to injury, the trail kept leading me away from the obviously shortest route down!
This frustration was best expressed by Underdog as we sat down in a restaurant waiting for our grub.   He threw his hands in the air and said “it was fine to show a view of Daleville far below us but we didn’t need SIX other views from different angles before the trail finally descended!
Never mind.  I managed to get together a 6 x day resupply (ouch, I'm hurting already) but more importantly I got some new underwear!   I've lost so much weight that the only way I can keep my undies from dropping down round my knees is to hitch them up like Harry High Pants and secure them with the belt of my rucksack!

Despite gaining height, this morning’s section of the trail was gentle and well constructed.
I met Rocky who is a young woman from the Netherlands who has come to American to work for a short period.  
She told me she had little hiking experience but was keen to enjoy the beautiful wild outdoors and so has kitted herself out with the necessary gear and is now enjoying a nine day hike.  May it be the beginning of a life-time passion for experiencing all that nature has to offer!
When I arrived at the shelter towards the end of the day, I met two SoBo’s Porcupine and Columbus. 
It was good talking trail with them and getting plenty of useful information about what’s ahead and because they had been noting all the NoBo’s that they had passed in the last few days, I was able to catch up about where a few of my trail mates were on the trail.","Daleville

MonarchandWow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610488,"Today, the trail kept crossing a road and offering wonderful vistas.   On a fine day this would have been nice but just now there is a low cloud ceiling, and large patches of rolling fog.  (But I did manage to witness one or two).

 

And of course this meant intermittent rain so a great deal of effort was spent struggling in and out of waterproof gear.   This led to further frustration as concentrating on getting the rucksack off and the jacket on, I took a wrong turn at a poorly marked trail intersection and headed off in the rain.   I followed the faded white blazes on trees for few miles before realizing I was on an old track and doing non-trail miles and had to retrace my steps.

On the upside, the Bryant Ridge Shelter is in a lovely wooded valley and is worthy of a visit and indeed a stay. It has a large capacity being able to shelter around twenty people and has a unique dual-level design that is well thought out. For a start, there’s a skylight so you can see what your doing, there’s tons of pegs to hang your gear on and with wrap-around seating there’s room enough for everyone to relax and catch up with one another. 
It was here that I met up with Rocky again.  The last time I saw her was on my approach to McAfee Knob. It turns out that she is from the Netherlands and doing an internship with a medical company.  Rocky, with only about five days previous hiking experience, had decided to do a section of the AT.  As youngsters do, she’d watched YouTube clips as part of her research and then bought all the gear she needed on the Internet, including her boots and a hammock! Unlike Monarch and myself; we get the books, the maps, and then take days walking round the ‘outdoor’ adventure shops comparing design, quality and price of just about everything, before making a decision.  True, we do buy some things online, but only if its not available on the shop floor.  
 Anyway, Rocky liked the look of McAfee Knob so she started her nine-day hike from there, which as I said, is where I first met her.
 She has a steep learning curve ahead of her but I do admire her adventurous spirit and I hope she goes well. 
 There’s no better way to learn than from direct personal experience, as it validates ones reality.","Bobblets Gap Shelter

Well Cornelius shelter was not quite as salubrious as the Bryant ridge Shelter I had passed by on the walk yesterday and being smaller, was full.  So I camped out in the rain but it was bright clear when I awoke this morning.  

I arranged to meet Rocky at the Matt’s Shelter despite her telling me she had not had a good nights sleep.
The trail was gentle for most of the day and along the way I met a few day hikers. 
On arriving at Matt’s Creek Shelter, I met with Renee and Alan who had trail magic for me.   Yum!

For most of the hike there was a low visibility fog and of course rain. 
I was heartened to see a few day hikers on the track who were willing to brave the elements.  
This section promised beautiful vistas and I’m sure they are out there somewhere but I wouldn't know, as the fog had them locked away. 
There was nothing else for it but to put my head down and walk.

Hey sunshine!  I’ve just discovered this awesome website for sports advice with some handy hints for trekking.  Here goes:  “The rain has negative ions which are good for you.  While it sounds like magic, and negative isn’t the best title, negative ions can have a positive impact on you. The rain is great at spreading them around. They help refresh the air, and help to reduce asthma and fatigue. So the next time you go out to take a good breath of fresh air, wait until it rains to get all the benefits"".   
Te-hee – Are you feeling better now?

My concern was how many miles to resupply and number of day’s food still in my sack.   It is always possible to stretch one’s food supply but not a good option and to be avoided if possible.
As I approached the hut there was a river crossing to be negotiated.  The crossing stones looked slippery and were well submerged in the fast flowing water.  I looked, left and right for other options but there were none to be found.  So with one deep breath I sprinted across like a pro. and thankfully arrive at the other side without any mishap. 
Just as I dumped my sack down in the hut, the heavens truly opened and I watched as the camp ground, which was nestled by a quiet stream, now become a subterranean landscape and the stream, a raging torrent. 
My only hope is that we do not have to cross the stream again in the morning.

MonarchandWow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610810,"Today has been a full day. 

Early start as usual and there was a very long steep climb to start with.  This was made even more arduous, as I was accompanied by a very strong, chilling “ lazy” wind.
Physics soon passed me, as he had arranged a shuttle to take him to town for treatment on his feet and we are not talking pedicures here! 
As the trail crossed the tops of the mountains, the wind attempted to blow me back to Georgia!   It literally forces you sideways, off the trail.
I passed two female section hikers, one of whom said she had been reading the blogs  but again I forgot to ask her name.  Honestly I was “brung up” better than that, so maybe as I’m heading to the Priest Shelter I’ll confess my lack of manners. If you’ll excuse the pun! 
As I took a short breather on one of the ascents, a familiar face came into view.   It was ‘merica followed by Lucky and Catmando who I had not seen since late February and finally Togs.  Fabulous!   

You may remember that within a week of starting the trail, hikers were telling me about an “English girl” who lived in Australia. 
As the weeks went by, more and more information about this “English girl” (who I now know is called Togs) came from the passing hikers.  And finally, today we caught up! 
Togs has worked with doctors from the same hospital I worked in for 30+ yrs. 
Togs also comes from Sheffield in the U.K., where I have a brother who is a Doctor in Emergency.
It was great to see them all and what a great “Tramily” (trail family) they make. And believe me, they are doing big miles.

Because I was high up on the hills this morning, I had AT & T reception.   

 

So I spent a fair bit of valuable trekking time, attempting to recharge my phone’s SIM card.  

I had tried a number of times previously and in slightly more comfortable circumstances but with little success.   As usual I find myself resisting a chilling “lazy” spring wind as I try to stand in the only spot with good reception to complete the task; All very tedious.  Anyway a degree of success in that they took my money!   I’ll just have to see how it performs over the coming days. 
I had great views over what I think was vineyards but climbing has taken its toll on me today.   Despite enjoying the vistas and the day in general, I felt that I needed to phone REI for a “wheeled walking frame”.  The legs “shut down” on me, forcing me to “camel up” and go hunting for a campsite. 
Despite eating quickly and getting straight into bed, sleep did not come at the same pace. I awoke at 2 am with a strong full moon.  It was so bright; I could sit up and read something without putting a torch on!  I decided that since I was awake I might as well venture outside.
As I look out towards the town nestled below, I saw lines upon lines of flickering lights and the image took hold that they, the lights, were the fires of the opposing army with whom we would be engaging in hand to hand combat at dawn the following day.Seen from this perspective the sheer number of lights sent a shiver down my spine and I retreated to the warmth of my sleeping bag. The men of yesteryear were made from different metal.
For as John O’Donohue once said:
“Real intimacy is a sacred experience.  It never exposes its secret trust and belonging to the voyeuristic eye of a neon culture.  Real intimacy is of the soul, and the soul is reserved.”

As I started the descent into Rock Fish Gap, my feet were buoyed by the thought of food, especially those eateries that display a hikers four favorite letters, ‘AYCE’. (All You Can Eat) but I soon realized I was running out of gas! 
For a start, on the uphill sections (even when your supposedly descending there are always bit to climb) my legs just didn't want to know. The sack started to feel heavy and I started fighting with it, as it was not sitting well on my hips.  
I think perhaps the “carrot” dangling in front of me was not enticing enough or my “town legs” had simply arrived too early.

You may recall I walked for a while with Underdog and Magic Mike as they video-blogged their way along the trail.  I’m impressed as the time and effort it takes to create the video would be too much for me.  However, if you go to YouTube - Underdog on the Appalachian Trail 2019 - day 62 you will see the effect that the trail is having on me and right at the very end of the clip there is a message from me to Monarch.

Hiker Brain Pickings.
I hadn’t been walking that long, when I witnessed my “Hiker Brain” emerge and take control. 
Firstly, it ensured that I was walking to the right beat  (see blog of March 26th) In breath, out breath. Then the sound of my sticks, click and clack.  Followed by my boots, crunch and munch.
Secondly, Hiker Brain clearly thinking its fully in charge, goes through the following check list:
1.         Ensure that the body is actually moving forward.
2.         Ensure there is a place for everything and that everything is in that place.
Apparently, Hiker Brain is happy that I brought a sewing kit to repair my cap but unhappy that I forgot to secure the loose button on the hiking shirt.
3.         Recheck by visualizing each item in the rucksack and making sure it corresponds to the feeling that it is where it should be.
4.         Review that  process again, just to make sure the “to do” list is valid and complete.
This “Hiker Brain” gets its energy from “eating” up the miles. It does not care how many miles  
It just goes on churning out its motto again and again: “These miles don’t walk themselves! One step at a time!  NoBo ever NoBo”!
However, Hiker Brain has a near fatal flaw, in that it is unable to judge or calculate distance travelled and again and again it  overestimates the ground covered.  
But so confident is this Hiker Brain; that it insists I stop and confirm its proclamation on my phone app.
When Hiker Brain realizes it has made a blunder, it then starts twisting, turning, and justifying, resulting in its own little dance of frustration. 
I’m sure by now you understand Hiker Brain is a menace. To deal with it kindly but firmly, I have resolved that prior to setting out, I will set a destination for the day and ONLY check distance travelled at lunch time and around 4 pm.  
For me the hardest miles on the AT are the last 1-2 miles of each day. This is when Hiker Brain will kick up as at this point it starts mixing anticipation with expectation that my destination is in sight and almost trips me up!
Such is life with a Hiker Brain.
 
Well the trail today, basically follows a skyline drive through Shenandoah National Park.  Rain was forecast and sure enough we got rain and dense rolling fog. Visibility was very poor, so with my head down and my nose to the ground I followed the white blazes with Pavlovian slavishness.
At one point it had started to rain,  So I stopped to get myself kitted out in my waterproof gear.  Just as I started to walk again, a hiker dressed in a tee shirt, shorts and trail shoes ( totally soaked) passed me and said in all seriousness that I was totally overdressed - I just agreeing.

We managed the 7.9 miles in relatively smart order, and then we ate very well.
By the way, I just had to send you a picture of this sign for keeping your dogs on leads, as to my mind it's a most peculiar looking animal, or maybe its my Hiker Brain kicking in, in which case, perhaps its time to send the men in white coats to come and get me!
Anyway feeling totally fortified, we made our way back to the trail.  It was skillfully constructed and being well designed, it invited you to view the magnificent vistas, which were many.

While back on trail, Dusty Papa decided that he’d stop at the next shelter while No Service and myself hiked on to a known spring, where we hoped to find a spot to camp for the night.
No Service was out in front and just as the day was coming to a close, I came across two trekking poles with a sign saying “Wow trail magic” with an arrow sign pointing just off-trail. 
This baffled me but having scratched my head, I donned my cap and followed the arrow.  To my utter amazement, there was Bottles with No Service, eating pizza and drinking beer out the back of a car.  It turns out that Bottles (a Thru hiker) is No Service’s son.  He decided to surprise his Dad with some Trail Magic.

This works fine for me as I need to stop and replace my boots, as the inner linings, particularly at the back of each heal, are breaking down.  It will also be good chance to resupply.

I came upon a campground and so I headed to the toilet block to top up my water and noticed that it was installed with a shower, which had hot water!   Whoopee! 
Ten minutes later I was freshly showered and heading down the track.  I then came upon the Old South Mountain Inn, which just happened to be serving AYCE buffet lunch.

I met Data and True Grit with her dog Harley. True Grit is from Maine and was able to give me valuable information on the resupply options in that area.  Many thanks for that info. 
As I was going through Pen Mar Park I started talking to a gentleman who ended up kindly giving me a lift to Waynesboro PA to get some snack food.  He had recently retired and has decided that he will be doing Track Maintenance and providing Trail Magic in the coming years as a way of giving back for all those years that he has been able to enjoy the track himself.  So it looks like I’m his first customer!

When I got to the shelter this evening, it was full of AT thru hikers.  So as you can imagine, there was a good deal of catching-up going on.   
To add to the fun, a large group of young folk came across and gave us all their spare food, which was greatly received and quickly demolished.
Also, for this group of trekkers, it has become something of a tradition prior to going to bed, for each member to tell the rest of the group about their high and low points of the day and so one at a time they reveal all.

The Mini Bubble Crew I met at the last shelter had planned to do 25 miles today but I had not committed to a destination. 
I seem to have passed a number of halfway marks today, as the distance of the AT this year is 2,192 miles, the longest it has ever been. 
I passed a general store so naturally I stopped for a burger, coffee and a few chocolate bars. 
Having this fuel on board I was feeling good and the legs were happy so I pushed for the shelter. 
 

On the way I ran into Sonoma Songbird and her brother Glow Worm (see Photo) who you will notice has the same style of dirty-girl gaiters on as I’m wearing. 
Glow Worm and I both agreed that at our age we could either live a quite life of desperation, or grab life by the throat and grow old disgracefully, we were both definitely in the latter camp. 
 

Later that day another  rather funny incident took place. There I was, head down and trudging along when I walked past a lookout, where a couple of women taking their dog for a walk, had stopped to enjoy the view. 
As I approached the dog ran off. 
I continued walking as you do, and as I passed the lookout one of the women came up behind me on the trail and whistled for her dog. 
On hearing the whistle I stopped and quickly turned to her and said - “How do you know that whistle“?  She looked puzzled.
I said “That’s the whistle my wife uses when she wants to call me to heel” 
The woman started to laugh. 
I followed this with “You don’t look like my wife - you’re not my wife in disguise, are you”? 
By now the woman found this so funny that she had literally creased up laughing and was now squatting on the ground. 
I continued by proudly saying “ I am house trained you know - I even bark when I want to go outside!! 
At this point the woman held her arm up and begged me to stop because she was laughing so hard, she was unable to breath. 
I turned and disappeared down the track leaving both women in gales of laugher.   –  Come to think of it, I wonder if they got their dog back?!

Having had breakfast with most of the crew, I headed to the outfitters to check on a new pair of boots.  The only problem being this outfitter is known for it’s fly fishing equipment.
I went in and started looking at the boots which all appeared a bit on the small side.  A gentle voice from behind me said, “Those are the women’s boots”.   I sheepishly went to the next display of boots but they looked a tad heavy.   “Those are the fly-fishing boots,” the gentle voice continued.  Finally having made a total idiot of myself the 'gentle voice' stood by the display of men’s boots to be sure I knew where to look next!!!
Well in no time at all, I had a new pair of Obōz size 13 and a pair of Darn Tuff socks.   I’ve never tried these brands before nor have I have purchased a new pair of boots off the shelf and immediately hiked 20+ miles in them, but all went well. 
The trail meandered through farmland and along nature strips/divides.  There was talk of a 14mile stretch without any water being available but all went well. 
Finally I arrived at the shelter and was greeted by two section hikers, Dave and JP but no sign of the crew.   The shelter was large and to enter it, you had to jump up an enormous step with a metal covering.   The reason for this construction, was to stop a local porcupine that had a nasty habit of just wandering in!
Later, Frosting and Legolas turn up and were quite perturbed that the rest of the crew were not around.   We later found out, they had trudged an extra 4 miles into town, as one of the crew’s grandparents lived there.

Of course, when it saw me it made a run for it!  But I quickly followed it outside and for a moment we stopped and looked at each other.   Then as I approached the 'intruder', it started climbing the nearest tree.   I was fascinated, as I had no idea that porcupines could climb trees!

I seem to have spent the day leapfrogging Power whom I had met a few days earlier. 

 

The miles were gentle underfoot so I’ve been able to cover a reasonable distance today.   There’s no point in pushing this body of mine any further or faster as it just complains the next day.  

 

The campsite I’m aiming for runs parallel with a dirt road that has a wide stony grass verge.

MonarchandWow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/612815,"Monarch had suggested that I give an indication of how the body is holding up and the problems I encounter. 
The feet have had x1 blister each and even with the new boots, are doing well. 
A couple of toe nails are loose but still intact. 
The L) Achilles that I seriously “twanged” still gives problems and is the cause of my hiker hobble. 
It is however improving although I still cannot take full weight on the ball of my L) foot and push off. 
The major concern remains the calorie deficit, whereby I burn off more calories than I take in.  For me this deficit makes me feel that I’m walking “on empty” - you can almost feel the body chewing up muscle mass. 
The result of this is that walking requires concentrated effort and negatively impacts on the emotional, psychological and motivational aspects of this adventure. 
The solution is that one needs to get a good fresh calorie intake of non-hiker food every 3-4 days. For me this is important, although I can find it difficult to achieve. 
 

Take today for instance. 
I got up early and started negotiating a steep decent into Port Clinton because a good solid breakfast could be had there.  But no sooner had I started out, Hiker Brain was attempting to thwart the intended plan because it would require my walking two non-trail miles. 
Thankfully the other intelligences within the body silenced Hiker Brain and a good big breakfast was enjoyed. 
On returning to the trail I passed the Port Clinton Peanut Shop.  I of course stopped and put by head round the door and found the place full of almost every conceivable lolly/candy imaginable.  In a previous life I had helped to run a sweet stall on a market - it was a lot of hard work and one actually ate very few.  Not this time though – Yum!
Back on trail the difference of having a good breakfast on board rather than an empty tum made the walking most enjoyable. The Rhythms of the Walk were most harmonious.  
Monarch Interjects:  Please see: Tuesday 26thMarch journal entry if you’re confused!
However I still made problems for myself, as I’d looked at the map earlier and gauged that the track would be gentle for most of the day and therefore, I reckoned I should be able to cover 20 miles even though I was only starting out at 10:30 am having gone off-trail for the breakfast.   
With still 2.5 miles to go, I scanned the app to see if there was much elevation lift coming up.   I squinted at my mobile phone, as I was too lazy to get my glasses out. Unfortunately, I read the miles as the elevation and deciding that it was flat, I’d be okay.
I came across a stream and took the opportunity to have a wash and then I started out on my “flat” walk.  However I soon found myself climbing some 800 ft. and sweating profusely - clearly learning had not occurred! 
 

I am now in camp and as I write this journal, there is now a full-blown thunder / lightening storm happening.   I do hope my food bag, which has been strung up in a tree to keep the bears from rummaging through it, stays okay!

The descent into Lehigh Gap was short and a road walk across the Lehigh River placed me at the foot of the famous steep climb out of Lehigh Gap.
The ascent was indeed steep and in places, required rock climbing skills. 
Steve tells me that my young inspirational hero Mountain Goat actually did this climb in the WET. To me that is truly amazing (see photo). Congratulations my young hero and well done to Steve for making it possible. 
We were aware from the information available, that this was a 20-mile waterless section - so we were carrying extra water.  There is however a stream a couple of miles after the climb. This is supposed to have high heavy metal content and is for emergency use only. 
The trail after the ascent was gentle but for me it was tiring and I was thankful to arrive at Wind Gap. 
I passed Snow White who had been walking with her friend and now was camped awaiting the arrival of the other members of the Mini Bubble Crew (who were camped near the shelter last night).

In the microcosmic world of a Thru-hiker what is important at the 1300.2-mile marker is as follows:

 

Maintaining and polishing the connection with Monarch through, the blog and frequent phone calls. Without this connection life would just be a monochrome dance of shadows.


Dear reader, thank you for reading along with me as I walk these miles. Your company is much appreciated. 


Big shout out to Hound who takes the trouble, despite being 100+ miles ahead, of messaging me about the best places to go and places to avoid. Many thanks young Hound.


Power’s grandmother is in ICU following a CVA. Here’s hoping that life gives Power the understanding  to deal with whatever the outcome may be.



As always it was great to catch up with the Mini Bubble Crew who were heading towards a taxi to find some resupply. For the last few days there has been talk of the Friday Music Night that many were going to.  However, there is a $15 cover charge, which has put a dampener on the idea for a few of them.  Also, I do tend to forget that the legal drinking age is 21.
After the climb out of Wind Gap the trail was gentle but the rain and cold temperatures have turned this rocky terrain into an ice-skating rink. 
It took its toll and as I descended into Delaware Gap I was beginning to consider getting a room and just relaxing for a while.  I needed to go into the Outfitters for a new gas canister anyway and then as if to help with my decision-making, Hound had suggested (via phone) a visit to the bakery. 
So there I was in a nice warm bakery.  The waitress rocks up and I asked for a toasted cheese sandwich.  She then asks me “What cheese would you like in that”? Seeing my opportunity I replied “East Guatemala Yak Herders soft cheese please”.  Without missing a beat she said, “We don’t have that cheese”.  I was hoping this quick repartee would lead into a Monty Pythons Cheese Shop sketch but she was too young to know them – a missed opportunity!
Monarch Interjects:  WOW you’ve just said Hound is 100+ miles ahead of you, so not too sure how you’re now sitting down with him, munching the tucker and being lippy with the waitress!  - Please Explain!!  - p.s.  I love you too!!!
Dear Monarch - problem fixed  I was using the royal “ we” again ( after all I am married to Monarch!!!) Hound messages me his suggestions - please forgive old hiker brain ( ok that’s enough grovelling!!!!)
While I was eating my way through one of their large apple pies, Hobo aka Silver Streak came across and we talked trail. It turns out he started on Feb 17th but has had two weeks off trail with leg issues and is now back on trail heading NoBo.  That’s impressive considering he is 66 yrs. old.  He too is keeping a trail journal blog.   
Having eaten I felt like a new man and happily continued for another few miles much rejuvenated.
Today, while crossing the long Delaware Gap Bridge, I walked out of Rocksylvania and into New Jersey. Bye-bye Rocksylvania my ankles and knees will not miss the rocks!","Wind Gap

MonarchandWow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613231,"Up early and on trail by 06.30 am. 
The reason for the slightly earlier start is because I was reliably informed that Mohican Outdoor centre has a breakfast. 
Unsure whether I had to book or not, I phoned en route and was told by Josh that breakfast would start in 15 minutes. Trouble is, I’m still 3 miles away!  Josh was sympathetic and said he would do his best to hold onto some the supplies for me. I moved quickly and arrived just as everyone had finished. 
Josh is an executive chef from New York and was good on his word.  He made a fabulous breakfast for me and in between prepping for the lunch he took time to explain each dish he was creating. 
So, with freshly baked bread and a bottomless cup of coffee, I spent the next 90 minutes eating and drinking.   Josh also brought me some biscuits and cakes he had made.   Lucky, lucky me!
 


The trail today was stunning and with an open canopy this time. The rocks were also “friendlier” and the vista’s terrific.  What a joy!  Even crossing a beaver’s dam was like a walk in the park. 
Then as the afternoon kicked in, it started to get hard going, as the strenuous push to get to breakfast earlier this morning was having an impact. 
Never mind, as I arrived at the shelter, the Mini Bubble Crew turned up and were quickly followed by Silver Streak, both having come in from Delaware Gap.","Backpackers Camp

MonarchandWow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613366,"We all stayed in our sleeping bags this morning, listening to the rain, which had been pouring down all night.  
Imagining how awful it was outside, no one wanted to move. 
Eventually someone brave soul stirred and reluctantly everyone else followed suit - these miles won’t walk themselves. 
Like a turtle, I tried to tuck my head well back into the hood of my jacket and every bit of waterproof gear I had was put on. There’s nothing to be done really, you know your going to be soaked through.  
 

As I left the shelter a line from “Duck’s Ditty” The Wind in the Willows, came to mind:
Everyone for what he likes
We like to be
Heads down, tails up,

Dabbling free!

 

Tally ho and all that!


Well it wasn't long before some of the Mini Bubble Crew scrambled past me. 
When I arrived at the first shelter they were all trying to get warm.  I continued not wanting to stop, as I knew I would cool down. 
By mid-afternoon Silver Streak passed and talked about heading for the Secret Shelter which is on private land, owned by a previous AT thru hiker.
The torrential rain had turned the trail into quagmire and in some areas a flowing river!   There was no chance of avoiding these stretches and aquaplaning was all the go!
With Silver Streak setting the pace, we finally arrived at the shelter and it was well worth the push.  
The shelter is an outhouse with power and very well insulated.  There is also an outside shower which none of us tried.  It was so good to get the wet gear off and get ourselves warm and dry. Imagine what it would have been like if we’d had to crawl into our tents!
We met up with Perk who had been on trail since early February. 
Then, Hound sent bad news: a bear has made off with his food bag!– We’re all hoping the situation turns out alright for you young Hound and that you’re not too far from somewhere you can re-supply.","Brink Road Shelter

MonarchandWow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613449,"All three of us, that is Silver Streak, Perk and myself, needed to resupply and given that rain was forecast for about midday, we were up early and moving. 
The trail felt like it was passing through suburbia and farmland with many sections requiring boardwalks and elevated walkways due to the “bogfest” underfoot, akin to some tracks back home in Tasmania.
We covered the 13.6 miles by 11am.   Silver Streak had book rooms at the Appalachian Motel, who provide a free shuttle to and from the trailhead. 
The motel is very well appointed and we were able to do laundry ($10 a load) and shuttle to town ($5 each return) to eat and resupply. It is a whole different experience to the Gateway Motel at Wind Gap.
 
There are some interesting developments occurring associated with Silver Streak. I will keep you up dated when / if the situation firms up. Watch this space.   

The rain did come at about 12-midday and had been very steady all “arvo” (Aussie word speak for afternoon).   Not that it bothered me as I’m sitting back on a very comfortable bed, fully showered in clean dry clothes having just eaten.
Lucky, lucky me!","

MonarchandWow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613523,"We were dropped off at the trailhead at 07.30 hrs. 

The trail was like a small roller coaster with some rocky ridge walking which did give some vistas. 
The target for the day was a hotdog stand at NY 17 A. Unfortunately it was closed, as we were too early in the season.  Never mind, it did its job as an edible target to work towards!
So we compensated and went to the Bellvale Farm Creamery.  I just wanted a descent cup coffee and seeing it on the menu asked for a cup but alas, it was coffee ice cream!
While eating the ice cream it started to rain, so the race was on to get to the shelter as quickly as possible as there were a number of hikers on the trail. 
The shelter filled up quickly and there was much trail talk, which helped me keep abreast of where people are on trail. 
 

It’s always good to be in a shelter when it’s raining outside, even if we're packed in like sardines!   All in all, it was a good day.","NJ Route 94 Trailhead
",Wildcat Shelter,"May 14, Tue",17.20
MonarchandWow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613606,"Up early and on trail by 6am. 
New York State is green and beautiful but has more ups and downs than the roller coaster section that I did a few weeks ago. 
It was like trekking in a mini Himalayas. Most ascents were on rock and required climbing / scrambling skills. At one stage we ascended through a rock fissure known as the “Lemon Squeezer”.
For the record we did not take our sacks off, nor did we take the easy route around the rock climbing boulder problem, which one encounters just after it.
 
We did pause momentarily and had a moment of silence as we passed the Fingerboard Shelter where Hound had his food bag taken by a bear.

We met a young Brit going south with a huge sack, who was complaining about the rugged terrain he had just come through. (For the record, Americans call Englishmen “Brit” while Australians call them “Poms”).  We ‘reassured’ him, where he was about to go the trail was about to get a whole lot harder!
The shelter we were heading towards had no water, so we thought we had better “camel up” with a supply from the base of the final climb for the day. Given the recent rains and early season we passed about 5 x viable sources of water on the long ascent !!!!
We started for the shelter (about .4 non-trail miles) where it is said, you can get good views of the New York skyline but lost interest when we came upon a campsite with views. (the NY skyline would be too far away, to capture on camera anyway and we had managed to catch a glimpse of it from one of the overhangs).    We set up our tents and other hikers who had been with us at the last shelter, came along and joined us.  All stated that they had found the day hard but had enjoyed the challenging climbs.  At least we were rewarded with wonderful vista’s, on top of each hill.We had to cross the Palisades  Interstate Parkway. It’s one lane at a time, as it is a fast stretch of road only 30+ miles from New York City.  Can it be any worse than crossing the 10-lane traffic circling the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, I ask myself – (Every visiting Pom’s nightmare)!
 

Well its “Good Night” from us happy campers breathing in such beautiful clean air and so close to the city.","Wildcat Shelter

The hotel is very hiker friendly - they even allowed us to take our sacks with us into the restaurant. It was indeed a very salubrious setting for us thru hikers to have breakfast.
We continued on, bypassing the zoo as it was not yet opened and walked across the Bear Mountain Bridge, which crosses the Hudson River.
Finally we arrived at the Appalachian Market on route 9. 
We (Silver Streak and myself) have decided to walk together and needed a Nero day to synchronise our resupply.  We did this with the help of Najee and Woodrow from GCHH.org - Check out their web site. More about this later as plan firms up. 
We stayed at the Bear Mountain Bridge Motel who are very hiker friendly and do provide a shuttle. 
Tomorrow Woodrow will also be walking with us - here’s hoping he goes well.","Stealth Camp

We (Silver Streak and myself) walked with him till about 14.30 hrs.  Then we helped him to set up his camp and hang a bear rope. 
Ensuring he was happy, we headed out to gets some miles under our belt to maintain our desired average of 20+ miles per day.
 

When we arrived at RPH Shelter the place was full of hikers and large pizzas were offered and consumed with much trail talk, as the Mini Bubble Crew were back in town! Yeah!!

This shelter is also known as the “Hiker Hilton” as it has lounge furniture, picnic tables, plaster walls, clean floor, working windows and a nice privy and yes, a takeout delivery service, hence all the Pizzas!
If you want a laugh, check out the legs coming out of the ceiling in today’s photo.

MonarchandWow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613880,"We were awake and up to hear the beautiful melody of the first songbird for the morning and headed out on the trail soon after.  
 There were many ups and downs to the day. 
For a start, we were gradually overtaking other hikers who obviously had left the shelter before us - and here we were, thinking we were first on trail! 
 

The aim was to get to the Garden Centre so Silver Streak can get a new pair of shoes. 
Silver Streak is a tri-athlete and has only one speed - flat out, which is detrimental if he does it day after day. 
Well clearly the excitement of getting new shoes was too much for him and he made a dash for it, saying that he’d meet me later at the Centre.
 

As I approached, I found a rather new looking iPhone in the marshes.  If anyone is looking for it, I’ve left it with the women at the Garden Centre.

 

Well obviously the Garden Centre was the place to be today as no soon had I arrived, Frosting and Dr. Thunder came on in, as they had been offered a zero by a trail angel who was going to pick them up from there.  Lucky, lucky them!  

The Honeymoon Couple also arrived and said they were going to camp a bit further down the trail. 
Sadly, I didn't get the cup of coffee that I was so longing for today, as they simply don’t serve any here – be warned!
 

 We pushed on to the Wiley Shelter, which was surrounded by camping groups but the shelter was thankfully unoccupied. 
Turned out to be another good day on the trail after all.","RPH Shelter

MonarchandWow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614003,"Well this Hiker Brain, who seems to be my constant travel companion, insists that I start off this blog with “CONNECTICUT IS NOT FLAT”.
It was way back down the trail that it had listened into someone else’s conversation and had picked up on this little bit of information about the walking being relatively flat through Connecticut.
So naturally, as we said our goodbyes to New York State this morning, Hiker Brain was fully convinced we were heading for some easygoing flat terrain. 
Now how Hiker Brain manages to listen into a stranger’s conversation and create an enormous ‘expectation’ from a throw away line, beggars belief!  
So now I have to walk with this companion for the rest of the day whilst it whines on about how disappointed it is, and how ‘the other person’ set him up!
Poor old Hiker Brain, learning has not occurred!
 

So what was it like today?
Well the trail was hard, although there was a little flat section whilst the trail followed a river. 
However, there was a steep and at times, tricky descent from St Johns Ledges which would have been very difficult in the wet, given the leaf litter covering the stones.
Monarch Interjects:  Well I hope Hiker Brain was grateful, that it wasn't pouring down!
 

On top of the mileage we covered today, we did walk an extra 2 x non-trail miles into Kent for non-trail food, sandwiches and coffee. 

This was a great psychological boost for both of us. 
Monarch Interjects:  Dear Reader, please understand that WOW is talking about himself and Silver Streak now and has gotten over his hiker brain moment. 

Kent is an artisan town with a huge number of motorcyclists parading backwards and forwards, many without helmets.   This was a bit of a surprise as in Australia it is illegal to do so and if caught, you’ll be out of pocket some AU$100 each time.  
While we were walking the flat river section, we came across Trail Clown / Cloud (I am going deaf).  He was with his wife and was himself a section hiker that has almost finished the AT and it was great to see the passion that the trail evoked in him.  They very generously gave us fruit, beer and water. Many thanks! 
We arrived at an empty campsite and using the hand pump to access water, we were able to wash. The water must have come from the bowels of the Earth because we had to spend a fair time pumping before any grey water arrived.
Rain is forecast, so we are set up under the roofed pavilion.
Hankster, thanks for your comments - both Silver Streak and myself remember meeting you and as we walk, the spirit of the Hankster is with us - we feel you.
Todays photo is of a piece of artwork I spotted in Kent. Now, I”ve been going on about the weight loss and calorie deficit but this is clearly taking it a little too far!","Wiley Shelter

MonarchandWow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614061,"We got up at around 04.45 this morning on hearing the first birdsong and we we're on trail by 6 am.

 

 

Today the trail took its toll on me and I made heavy work of it.

 

When we arrived at the first river, Silver Streak spent time washing his clothes whilst wearing them, claiming “ this is how we do it on the John Muir trail”!   I will, forever know this style of washing yourself and your clothes at the same time, as a “JMT”.  

 

 

We finally arrived at Falls Village trailhead and contacted Woody and Najee who had our resupply.

 

Having resupplied we went in search of coffee and food. The Guthook app talks of Toymakers Cafe.

 

On arriving it was closed - opening from Wednesday to Sunday. The lady gardening outside turned out to be the owner. Having put on my best pathetic face, she offered to warm some coffee up. 

 

This then developed in to Ann calling her husband Greg  who kindly came in made us some toasted sandwiches and offered us some of his delicious homemade cakes. 

 

Many thanks to Greg and Ann for opening their closed Toymakers Cafe for us. 

 

The weather forecast stated that a thunderstorm was coming. 

 

So we changed our plan and aimed for the Limestone Spring Shelter.  It is 0.5 miles down a deep descent but it is worth it. The spring water is stunning and the camping is great.  As I write this blog though, there is still no sign of rain only mosquitos. 
 

Still, now we’re here I’m just going to enjoy the facility and location and put the knowledge that we’re going to have to climb a steep ascent first thing in the morning, where it belongs!","Silver Hill Campsite

MonarchandWow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614293,"A Day of contrasts.

We were up at first bird song 04.50 hrs and having packed, I headed for the trail leaving Silver Streak to follow.
I had gone 3.5 miles and given he is a faster hiker than me, I decided to wait for him. 
No sooner had I turned my phone on, I received an avalanche of messages. 
It turns out that Silver Streak had returned to the trail but had headed south back the way we came yesterday. 
After travelling a few miles downhill he realised his mistake and decided to do a road run to meet up with me. He was not happy.
Having met me, he then had to do the 7 miles return trip to complete the missed miles I had done. Naturally, I waited for him.
The net result was that by 10.30 we had only 3.5 trail miles completed.   
While Silver Streak had about 10 non-trail miles completed.


I have suggested that he change his name to SILVA ( they make compasses) Streak. 
He defends his position by saying “he was not lost - just heading on trail but in the wrong direction”. 
My suggestion still stands - what do you think dear reader? 

By mid afternoon we had accepted that we would have a low mileage day and given that tomorrow was a Nero we would enjoy the day.  We sat and discussed our plans on a rock ridge line with great views.  It made for a very pleasant interlude. 
We left Connecticut and headed into Massachusetts. Bear Mountain also rendered us some great vistas and the ridge walk around Mt Race and up to Mt Everett was absolutely stunning. There was a warming sun and a cooling breeze appearing just as one needed it. 
Heading towards the shelter there was a nasty steep climb to keep us entertained. 
 

On the way, I found a Mont-Bell down jacket, which I thought might have belonged to a thru hiker ahead, so I carried it to the shelter. On further investigation I found a receipt in the pocket with phone numbers.  So I was able to post the jacket back to its owner. 

We arrived at a spacious yet empty shelter and settled in for the night.

As we passed through a swampy area we were swarmed by mosquitos, which attacked in squadrons. 
There was nothing for it but head down and aim for the trail head.
 

We were picked up by Woody and Jameison and taken to town for our Nero. 
We managed to get rooms at the Days Inn hotel. 

 

How funny it is to note, one can tell all the rooms with hikers in because there are old boots outside the door - even we cannot put up with the smell of them!!!

As I trudged along, I began to recall the recent events following my finding a down jacket on trail, which had a receipt in the pocket showing the owners mobile number. 
Naturally, I called the number and told the owner that I would leave her jacket at the hotel reception, where we were staying. 
The women concerned said that she had friends who were hiking in the area and she would arrange for them to pick up the jacket in a few days. 
However, having then chatted to hotel receptionist, I decided the easiest option was to post the jacket, to its owner, which I did. 
Then later today, as we were about to walk past a couple of hikers we fell into conversation with them, as you do.   Let me introduce you to April Shower and Diamond Days who it turns out, had been hiking with the lady when she had lost her jacket! 
In fact, they were the folk who had been requested to pick up the jacket from the hotel reception!! 
Between them they were Triple Crowners having completed the AT a number of times. 
But further still, their next trip is to do, the Coast to Coast walk in the UK which passes through the Lake District and the Yorkshire Dales, where I spent all my youth rock climbing.   
Ha!  I think that’s exactly what Carl Jung, would have called a ""meaningful coincidence"", who would’ve imagined?
 

As we approached the Campsite for the night we spotted a bear at the base of a tree. I found out later that her two cubs were already up the tree but I did not see them.  Phew!

We were going to have to do big miles today if we want to stay in a shelter tonight.
Thankfully, overall the terrain was gentle but it was an absolute bogfest with many fallen trees creating obstacles.

It has a ‘bank’ of different types of filtered coffee (my weakness) with free refills, drinks of different types, all forms of sticky buns, chocolate in many forms, sandwiches and rolls, plus hot food and some hiker food. A place, to spend time!
Silver Streak had to drag me out and remind me of the miles still to be done. 
So back on trail we started our ascent towards Mount Greylock, the highest point in Massachusetts but not before a lunch stop in Cheshire, at another gas station.
We spent the day climbing and were rewarded with the occasional vistas. 
Given that it is Memorial Day long weekend, there are many day hikers out on trail. 
Again Silver Streak has to remind me to stop talking to all and sundry on trail as we have to coordinate our resupply and “the way we we’re going, we would take forever”.
We finally arrived at the summit with its 93 ft. war memorial tower. 
Had we been hungry we could have eaten at the Bascom Lodge but we met with Woody and Jameison and resupplied, then set off for the shelter. 
When finally arrived at the shelter, we found the site was packed with tents. The Mini Bubble Crew were in residence, as were many weekenders who had walked in from the near by car park, with large tents and even larger coolers! 
We were able to congratulate Starfish, Frosting and Flamingo for their achievement of finishing the Connecticut challenge, whereby they complete the 51 miles of trail in Connecticut within 24 hrs. It is an amazing feat given the terrain!! 
They were paced by Physics. (Big hello to Physics’s Mum– yes, Mum Physics knows us well.)
And of course I have to shout out to Silver Streak for putting up with me and for being good company.

On track I’m in bed as early as possible and will sleep till about 1 am.  On waking I do my blog entry and then back to sleep until first bird song.  I have tried to do the blog entry before sleeping but end up writing total gibberish while falling asleep at the keyboard. 
And talking of today’s trail, I have to report that it was pretty non-memorable with a few steep climbs.  I guess the highlight was passing a couple of beaver ponds along the way.

The trail name for Vermont is Vermud and it did not disappoint.

Wet leaves over wet rocks and slippery tree roots; a recipe for disaster. 
This kind of trekking requires much care.   However, the chilling wind made sure that we kept moving. 
Clearly, it cannot be stressed enough that one must balance between moving fast enough to keep warm but slow enough not to have an accident. This requires a constant focus of attention on one’s footwork.

The trail started very much as it was yesterday; a waterlogged bogfest. 
The problem is that you can’t get a rhythm to your walking, as you have to manoeuvre around the deep mud holes and over the many obstacles strewn across the trail. 
A highlight of the day was taking the upper part of the trail, heading up towards the watchtower on top of Stratton Mountain. 
Good news is we managed to get some phone reception, once we had climbed the tower. 
I’ve been trying to contact the Oboz Boot Company and had made numerous attempts to complete their warranty online claims form, without success. 
I phoned them directly and explained that the boots I had brought from them at the beginning of the month had started to have problems. Within the space of 5 mins I had another replacement pair being sent to a hostel 7 days down trail.  Impressive.  In fact with this company you can get two replacement pairs of boots, as long as you’re a thru hiker.
 Silver Streak kindly went on Amazon and ordered another rucksack cover for me, which should arrive on Friday. 
 Well, these miles don’t walk themselves and we still have a distance to cover.
So onwards, ever onwards!   As we move along a trail we’re passing through an area covered in what looks like Queen Anne’s Lace Bush, as least that’s what it looks like to me. 
We were planning to go to the ski patrol hut which has good views but a couple of hikers, who were ‘hammocking’ at the last shelter, told us that there were a number of people there already.  So, we’re planning to settle into an empty shelter further along the trail tonight. 
 

A hard but a good day.","Story Spring Shelter

MonarchandWow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615264,"This morning, the dawn chorus was a non-event as heavy rain was thundering down on the roof of our shelter.  
Silver Streak was perplexed as his weather app showed clear skies. 
It turned out the racket was due to the wind blowing massive raindrops from the trees onto the roof.
 

Confession time - last night at about 23.30 a hiker came passed the shelter with his head light on to get water. 
He then returned and sat in the shelter, headlight still on, and merrily started playing on his phone. 
Having woken up both Silver Streak and myself, we politely inquired if he was staying. 
“No” was his reply, “I’m waiting for ‘my crew’ to catch me up and I wanted to get some water as we’re planning to go on to the ski patrol hut.” 
Within 5 mins, the others arrived and they too headed down for water and returned to have a ‘chat’ with the fellow sitting in the shelter.  
Now they were all sitting there, each with their headlights blazing!  They finally left.  Needless to say we did not tell them that tonight, a rather large school party was enjoying the ski patrol hut facility.

Well, this morning we climbed to the top of Bromley Mountain and as we passed the Ski Patrol Hut, and who should we find ‘camped outside the shelter’ and still soundly asleep in their Z-Pack tents but our late night visitors! 
Oh the joy of it!   As Silver Streak and myself both have Z-Pack tents with us, we were “overcome” with the need to stand beside them and extol the virtues of the tent in loud voices for about 5 min.  I don’t know what possessed us? 
Having felt that we had balanced things out between us, we disappeared into the fog covered summit and continued on our way, onward forever onwards.

Even now, having trekked this far I still have an expectation, that if the trail climbs then there ‘should’ be a decent vista to behold – but of course, on the AT this is not always the case.
Actually, having said that, we did get a good vista from the rocky ridgeline on Baker Peak.  

Then, as we continued to climbed Bromley and Styles Mountains in the rolling fog there was a palpable primordial feeling to the day, which more than compensated for anything we might have felt we had missing out on. 

 

A big thank you to Jameison who patiently waited for us at a trailhead so that we could pick up a resupply.

And again, we met a couple that we had seen earlier on the AT. They have their own unique way of doing the trek. They have a camper van and a car, which enables them to take advantage of the numerous road crossing and do the AT as a series of day hikes – it appears to be working for them.  What luxury!

Following a steep descent we found ourselves in a tall forest and came across the White Rock Garden.  This is a place where people have made numerous small balanced rock piles, which makes for an interesting landmark. 
 

Today was a long haul with an added 0.6 non-trail miles to the shelter. Thankfully it’s empty – so here’s to a good night’s sleep!","Bromley Shelter

It harps back to a shelter where Physics and myself were staying. 
I got into my sleeping bag early, to which young Physics cheekily remarked “it must be because your so OLD that you have to get into bed so early”. 
To which I replied “Yeah but I get out of bed at first light, which you cannot do because you’re so YOUNG”.
As a total aside, if you (Physics Mum) need a trail name, I would suggest “Curie” after Marie Curie, who was considered the Mother of modern Physics - Just a thought.

However, as our primary goal of reaching Katahdin emerges from the fog and takes shape, our plans change.
For the weather forecast is threatening severe thunderstorms and the next shelters are about 14 and 26 miles from our start point – so neither are suitable as they don’t fit with the desired ‘miles per day’, target.
Silver Streak floated the idea that if we still did our miles we could get picked up by Jameison in the GCHH support van, which would also help us avoid the expected thunderstorms.
With this plan in place, we set off ascending and descending the woodlands of Vermont making sure we still took time to enjoy the occasional vista.
The weather was sunny with a light shower making it reasonably easy to trek.  
However, the latter part of the trail turned into an assault course with numerous trees across the trail.

As you cross the bridge to turn left, there to your right is an AT symbol above a garage.  This is the home of Trail Angel Linda, who kindly gave us a soda and some watermelon.  Many thanks. 
We headed back into the woods and emerged some time later onto Elm Street where we were met by Small ‘n sweet and Greybeard, who have a cooler outside their house, which contains homemade chocolate chip banana cake.  Yum!  They also provided us with local knowledge and information.  A lovely spot, and as we looked around we saw they had found a creative use for a pair of old hiking boots (see photo). Many thanks for your kind generosity!
Now we begin a long road walk. 
But before we start, we walk to the bottom of Elm Street and turn L) to Dan and Whit’s General Store and Gas Station.  Word is, if they have any of yesterday’s sandwiches left, they give them free to AT thru hikers.

The long road walk continued and we crossed the Connecticut River, which forms a geographical boundary between Vermont and New Hampshire.   This then takes you through the town of Hanover, passing a number of eating-places and a Co-op. 
As we had concerns about water at the Velvet Rocks Shelter, we called into the Hanover Community Centre (which was just about to close), to get some.

I need to get to the Glencliff Post Office, which unfortunately only opens between 12 and 2 p.m.

 

This means that we need to do a ‘big mile day’ today, so that tomorrow will be a relatively easy day, enabling us to get to the Post Office to collect my boxes. 

 

 

Having crossed a few roads we climbed Moose Mountain North and then Moose Mountain South. 

 

Following another ascent up Holt’s Ledges we took a moment to enjoy a vista. 

 

I think it is only fair, that if one clambers up to the top of a mountain one should be rewarded with some type of vista, don’t you?

 

Sadly this is not always the case. 

 

We passed along Lambert Ridge, which did yield some views and along a number of ledges up to MT Cube. 

 

The highlight of the day was the ascent up Smarts Mt. which had a fire watch tower which offering stunning 360 degree views.  Wonderful!

 

 

“We left the tower happy little bunnies”  (Monarch Interjects:  Sorry folks, your guess is as good as mine, as to what WOW quite means by this?!)  and headed for the Hexacuba Shelter, which as the name suggests has six sides.

We were able to quickly resupply for the next section of the trail and enjoyed ticking it off our checklist last night, as it gave us a free morning, this morning. 
We had decided to hit the trail but a hiking friend of Silver Streak’s had invited us out to dinner this evening. 
However, to ensure that we did our miles we decided to hike over Mt Mousilauke and get picked up at Kinsman’s Notch. 
 

The ascent was long and steep but very doable. On reaching Mousilauke South, which was on a tree-lined ridge, the trail became a corridor, offering glimpses of the vistas below. 
As we passed above the tree line, the way was marked by large stone cairns. Then low and behold, the track presented the hiker with magnificent 360 degree vistas.  Sublime! What joy!
Having been banging on about there being no vistas at the top of climbs - all is forgiven.   AT track designers this is stunning! I eat humble pie.  A great job on this section of the trail!  Thank you, thank you. 
At the summit the obligatory photos were taken and the eyes feasted on the views. 

We then noticed a large group who were sheltering behind the small crescent-shaped stone windbreaks that had been built near the summit. 
All were celebrating their 50th Anniversary of climbing Mt Mousilauke from their college days.  Being all around 70 yrs. old, I had to ask them, who their Plastic Surgeon was, as they all looked great! I told them I would meet them all in 10 yrs. time on the summit. 

On the descent the trail initially contoured round the mountain; then dropped steeply and followed a lively river that was cascading down the mountainside.  As the river flowed down and down in ever widening twist and turns, the light caught and highlighted different patterns of movement at its surface.   
Clearly, the descent was for me, simply spectacular. 
  
Unfortunately Silver Streak fell while trying to eat and walk at the same time.   This broke his trekking pole and he ended up injuring his finger.  This is of concern. 

Still we returned and went out to dinner with Scarlet, who had hiked with Silver Streak in the High Sierra's and had detailed information on the Whites. Thank you for the meal and the information.  Very much enjoyed and appreciated. 
Given the terrain over the next few days, we need to be sure that Silver Streak can manage with his finger injury.  So rather than attempt to carry a full pack, we have opted to carry day sacks and requested that the supply vehicle pick us up.

There were the occasional vistas to take in but for most of the trail, it was head down and a hard clamber up hill.  
As it had rained yesterday, the trail was pretty wet in parts then a flowing stream in other parts that occasional swelled into a river. 

The hardest section of the trail is between Mt Wolf and South Kinsman. 
 

It is a very steep and narrow part of the trail.  There are a lot of large boulders to negotiate and a bogfest thrown for good measure. 

We took it carefully and finally we arrived at the summit of South Kinsman which had great views. A fellow with his dog who was at the summit took the time to show me the next part of the trail which was very kind of him  
The descent was pleasant enough, although we had to negotiate some rather steep sections on our way down.

We could tell that this was a popular section with hikers, as it was well constructed. 
The Franconia Ridge leads you past Mt Liberty and over Little Haystack Mt, Mount Lincoln, Mt Lafayette and Mount Garfield. 
It was at the Garfield Ridge Campsite that we decided to stop, as we both had had enough for the day. 
We eagerly found ourselves a tent site as we could see the place was filling up pretty quickly with hikers arriving every five minutes; or so it seemed. 
As the golden sun slowly dipped behind a stand of trees, I looked around at the multi coloured domes all squeezed in tightly together and felt sure, that who ever designed the layout of this site must have worked in a sardine-packing factory!
Well, if any of you are about to walk this section of the trail, you might like to know that your passage through the Whites consists of long steep ascents and descents with sections that require rock hopping.  Then again, on other sections you’ll be needing your rock scrambling/ climbing skills.  All up, I can promise it will give you a full body work out!   And, if you’re going to hike in bad weather know it adds another level of difficulty.
Be sure that your Hiker Brain is not writing cheque’s that your body cannot cash.  That is, don’t expect to be doing big mile days!

",Route 302,"Jun 09, Sun",17.50
MonarchandWow,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616060,"OUR ORIGINAL PLAN:
Today’s plan is based on the knowledge that there are two storm systems combining into one and heading our way.

We are presently experiencing clear weather, so the plan is to quickly resupply and to climb up Mt Washington.   This is on the understanding that we will be picked up at the top and brought back down again, so that we can have a zero day on Tuesday.
 



THE LOCAL KNOWLEDGE:

This plan takes into consideration what the locals are telling us, as they have advised us to stay off the mountain on Tuesday.

We are respectful of the fact that this area can generate its own weather patterns that at times are quite unpredictable!
This can be a recipe for disaster, as the history of “lives lost” shows.
That said and given the easy accessibility of vehicles to Mt Washington’s Summit, we made the call that our plan to shin up to the top today (Monday) was sound. 
 

 PLAN B:
However, on checking and re-checking our plan Silver Streak found out that today the authorities are only allowing motorbikes up the road to the Summit.  

Therefore, we have no way to getting off the mountain if we continued with our original plan. 
Factoring in the fact that Silver Streak has still not had an X-ray of his very swollen and painful finger, we have made the difficult decision to have a double zero.

A Hard but Right Decision
For me, this is hard decision but the right decision. 
 

My primary goal
Has always been to “kiss the plaque” on Baxter Peak on Katahdin. 
 

The secondary goal

Is to complete the Washington section of the Pacific Crest Trail within the allotted time of 180 days that my visa allows. 

 

So the quicker I get the AT done, the greater the chance of my being able to get to monument 78 on the US / Canadian border i.e. the northern terminal of the PCT.
Building a “buffer” of days, gives me the security that allows me to deal with unforeseen situations and events.
We have in the past adjusted our plans to allow for pending storms that have either not-eventuated or that have been re-directed.  
So sitting here with a calm day, clear sky and sunshine, good old “Hiker Brain” is not happy!  Only time will tell how this will all pan out.
 

 

Update:
The results of Silver Streak delayed visit to the doctor is that he has an oblique fracture of his proximal phalanges of his little finger L) hand. 

It’s a game-changing result.  Unfortunately Silver Streak’s thru-hike is over for now.  Had the terrain ahead been a simple walk in the park he would have continued but cannot do so with all the climbing required on this demanding section of the track. 
 

So again my plans have changed.  I will keep you informed as it unfolds.

Rather than have the carpet pulled from under us - We learn to dance on a moving carpet.
 

 

On a lighter note:

Having seen a bear, both Silver Streak and myself are now hanging out to see a moose. 

We have become so focused that every unexplained noise is a moose. 
The other day we spotted a small deer on the trail and we enjoyed conjuring up all sorts of cunning plans whereby we could photograph it and claim it to have been a moose! The things we do to keep our spirits up!  
Well unfortunately and sadly, given the radical change in plans, this is as close as Silver Streak will get to a moose on this trip.( see photo)

He also showed me the nuances of living life from the American perspective. 
However he did not complete my “ how to speak American English” lessons so I will still get ‘confused looks’ when I open my mouth. 

He is a great hiking buddy and I will sorely miss him on the trail.  Go well Silver Streak.  Go well. 
 

The weather did deteriorate, with heavy rain and high winds recorded on Mt Washington.  The next two days are forecast to be reasonably stable. 
Having had two zero days I am now experiencing whole body ache. 
The disabled bars around the toilet have suddenly become almost essential.
The only time there is little pain, is when I’m on trail.

Some folks have difficulty in understanding that, despite my profession, I have to date not taken any pain killers, or anti inflammatory medications as I prefer to monitor the aches and pains. 
As most hikers know, the most important three lines of treatment for any pain or injury one gets while on trail are: 
1  Rest

2 More Rest

3 Even more rest.

I could still feel the presence of Silver Streak walking with me, as the climb to Mt Washington began. 
The trail up to Mt Webster and Mt Jackson was steep and long. 
As I passed Mizpar Spring Hut, I called in for a coffee and a sticky bun. My timing was spot on as they kindly gave me sautés left over from breakfast.
Back on trail I kept climbing and passed by Lakes of the Clouds Hut where I collected water and then continued the climb. 
I eventually arrived at the heavily populated summit. 
The cog train had just arrived, so we had to wait in line to take a selfie by the summit plaque. 
 

There I met up with Catmando, Farmer, ‘merica, RD, and Frozen.  It was really good to catch up with them again.

I lost some “bark” but I will access the extent of my injuries in the morning. For now the priority is getting off the hill. 
 

The trail descended down a stretch of snow. Frozen, who was ahead of me, slipped and was about to make a very rapid descent down the snow which ended in large boulders but I was able to grab his rucksack and stop him, which was lucky.

The day started with a boulder field ascent and descent of Mt Madison.  We were accompanied most of this stretch with very strong gusty winds that kept trying to literally blow us off the mountain. Progress was slow.  As I got below the tree line things did improve a tad. We had heard that there had already been a person die of hypothermia on the mountain this week.
Just as the rain started, I finally made it down to Pinkham Notch Visitors. 
The expensive soup I brought was cold but there was endless coffee which did warm me up  
The temptation to stay was strong but I needed to cover a few miles to reduce the distance to Rattle River Hostel tomorrow, where I plan to pick up my new boots and resupply.
Let me tell you, climbing very steep wet rock with a painful wrist makes for very slow progress.
The trail ascends Wildcat Mt and grabbing the small trees to pull yourself up (as you do) one gets a nice cold shower EVERY time!  
Well by now I’m wet and chilling down pretty quickly.  I’m keenly scanning the terrain looking for a relatively sheltered stealth campsite.  Ah! I’ve found one!
I’m now tucked up in my warm, dry sack and the rain has stopped for a while.

Back on trail I met three young trail maintainers who were polite but all business.

 

I then met two Irish southbound section hikers who had done this part of the trail 24yrs ago. Redman asked me to keep an eye out for a bandanna that he had on his initial hike, dropped. He also told me he studied history and that he had been to Tasmania to study the Irish convicts. 

I told him about how a group of us had retraced the escape route that Alex “ cannibal” Pearce had taken, back in the 1820’s.  I told him to Google - “trekking Tasmania When Driven by Hunger” as he would then see the Australian Geographic article I wrote.  
By the way I did find his bandanna!!

A shower ensured that the rocks stayed wet. 
It was on Mt Moriah, the last major peak in the White Mountains that Farmer, Catmando and ‘merica caught up with me and we descended together.

So I continued onto Gorham and the Rattle River Lodge and Hostel, which is the cleanest and best-organised hostel I have stayed at to date.

Many thanks for the great company and the food which was much appreciated and helped to lift the spirits.

Today’s trail started with a climb - I was to climb over 8000 ft in one today. 
The trail passed a number of ponds and lakes. However the most important event was the selfie taken at the NH / MA border. 
The final state that the AT passes through!
The day was long and demanding.  The terrain was anything but flat.  
However, for all my moans and groans, I did enjoy the open vistas.

There was snow and ice on much of the floor, with Shelter Brook running the length of the Notch. 
Finding the route itself was a little challenging but with time and care it was no real problem.
One is then faced with the Mahoosuc Arm, which is an ascent of nearly 1500 ft. over slabs, for the distance of about a mile. 
Again, nothing I haven’t faced already.
I finally arrived at Grafton Notch to get my resupply from Jameison and to purchase another litre water bottle as I had lost mine on one of the many steep descents.

The campsite at South Arm Rd has swarms of insects all hell bent on getting your blood.

It can get so noisy in here that you can’t leave any loose items near the culprits for fear they may inhale them and make retrieving them in the morning a tad difficult. 
By sunrise the rain had stopped but the wet undergrowth ensured you got wet.

The trail was gentle and good time was made. 
Fresh Grounds had set up along the way and it was a joy to spend time talking trail and catching up on who’s where. 
It turns out Snow White had left the trail, as she had only planned to do a section, so had flown back to Germany but had then returned in 2 days to continue with her Tramily (Trail Family). 
The Mini Bubble has grown in size to over 20!  And they are about to be caught up by The Blue Men.  This is going to make fitting into shelters and campsites very interesting!

The rain continued all night and despite having poor nights sleep I was up and back on trail by 08.00. 
The day was overcast and the fog was rolling in. 
As you would expect everything was soaking wet. 
Having passed a couple of ponds, I climbed up Saddleback Mountain and then the Horn, which includes almost 3 miles of above tree line slab walking. 
The gusty winds kept the fog rolling along and made a few attempts to push me off the mountain.

There are now an increasing number of South bounders (SoBo) that I am meeting. 
One couple told me that they had suffered hypothermia crossing the mountains yesterday in the heavy rain and had to set up camp very early, just below the tree line to get warm.

Having done a number of rather wet, steep ascents and descents, I came to the Oberon Stream, which is now in fact a river and of course, the crossing stones were all well submerged. 
I spent time changing into my camp shoes to cross the knee-deep water crossing. 
 

Then after a short climb, I found myself on the Sluice Brook Logging Road, which as the name suggests, is an old logging road.  

As time was getting on and the next few miles were another ascent over Lone Mountain, I erred on the side of caution and camped on the logging road beside the stream and above the waterfall.  
A great spot but for the bugs! 
It took military precision to put the tent up and get in it without inviting all the “locals” to join me. 
Others have camped here before and there is a fire ring in the middle of the road.

Then the whole pattern repeated itself!
The trail took me past Spaulding Mt where the trail turned from a bogfest into an assault course due to the fallen trees across the trail. 
The wet steep ascents and descents continued.   I enjoyed North and South Crocker where views of the surrounds enabled me to watch the rolling rain storms pass over the entire countryside.
I passed many day hikers who were dressed very ‘trendily’ and smelt great but were however, soaked to the skin.
I met Bruiser who is a south bounding section hiker. She saw my dirty girl gaiters and said that Glow Worm had the same style. 
She was amazed when I told her that I had a photo of Glow Worm and myself from some time ago. I told her that the photo was taken by his sister who was called Sonora Songbird - she had slept next to me in the shelter and had snored all night long, not 2 inches from my ear!
I took to pronouncing her name as “Snorer” as she had sung her “song “ all night long, just like a nightingale!

This was followed by a dipping ridge walk onto Bigelow Avery Peak (named after the architect of the AT).  
Then onto Little Bigelow Mountain and the Lean-to of the same name where I filled up with water.

The miles covered over the last few days have been to enable me to arrive at the Kennebec River in time for the canoe ride between 9 -11 am. 
The trail was gentle and I arrived at the Lean-to by mid afternoon. 
I have been walking with Lightfoot, Avatar and his son Tic-Tac.
En route I came across two dry bags of personal belongs that had obviously been dropped accidentally.  The items included a wallet, credit cards, glasses and medication, which did have a birth name on the container but not a trail name.
What to do?  Did these items belong to a North or South Bounder?
I was just deciding to leave a note and carry the items when Lightfoot came and thankfully recognised the birth name as Avatars. As you can imagine Avatar was mightily relieved that the items had been found.
The trail continued meandering along the edge of a pond.  
We came across a couple of girls who had just had a swim. They showed us the leeches that were in the water. These leeches were 6 inches long and very active!  Brave girls.  If a few of those got on you they'd cause severe anaemia!
Having set up camp, it was sheer bliss to sit and shoot the breeze for a while. 
We decided to pay a visit to Tim at the Harrison’s Pierce Pond Camp sporting / hunting lodge which had been given a good wrap by other hikers. 
What a sheer joy it was to go and spend some time there. 
We were planning to have his pancake breakfast for which, you need to book the day before. 
Essentially Tim caters for the sporting / hunting guests but is very Hiker friendly. 
It is truly worth a visit to experience the lodge - it is stunning. 
Tim gave us some left over food and coffee/ lemonade. I spent time sitting in his kitchen talking with him.

Fuelled by the pancakes and the bottomless coffee, I headed out with Avatar, Tic-Tac and Lightfoot for the canoe trip across the Kennebec River.  Despite it being early in the season, there was a queue on both sides.

As is the habit, I was up early this morning, full of good cheer as I started heading up the hill, expecting a long steep climb.
The weather was cool and clear with an occasional breeze - a perfect day to summit. 
The trail took us steeply up a ridge line, which plateaued out as it passed along Thoreau spring, we then continued upwards on a well-defined path. 
Confession time – As some of you will have read/heard; my major complaint against the AT is that, if you walk a hiker to the top of the hill, no matter how hard or easy, you have to give them a vista!  The AT does not always do this. Then again, when I do get a good vista, I say it reminds me of the PCT. This was my mind-set up until to today! 

The vistas are 360º, totally stunning and unique – and guess what?  It did not remind me of the PCT.   In fact, the PCT didn't get a moment of air space in my head; so awesome was this view

Leading to the summit, I could just make out the old battered summit sign; a sure indication that the end was in sight!  From the summit the boulder strewn trail continues along a spectacular knife edge with dramatic drops on each side. I could almost hear it calling my name. I could see a number of day hikers slowly negotiating this alternative descent. Where was my camera!!!!
I was totally transfixed as I breathed in the glorious topography.   
It is now in these final steps that the AT revealed its most precious treasures.  
Truly, the impressions created here while standing by this summit sign are far more powerful than being able to call myself a thru-hiker and that insight was totally unexpected. 
For me, the best day on the trail was today and not because it was my last day. 
Of all the trail magic I have been honoured to be the recipient of over these last few months, these moments on the summit were by far the best trail magic I have ever had!  Absolutely awesome!

Well dear friends, it has been a joy to share this journey with you.  Thank you for your support, messages and your company along the way.  It is my intention now to fly to Oregon and to finish off the PCT trail before heading home to Tasmania.  In the coming days I’ll let you know how I’m going, so that those amongst you that would like to come along in spirit, can do so.
