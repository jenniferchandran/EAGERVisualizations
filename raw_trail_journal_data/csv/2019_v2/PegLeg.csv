PegLeg,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568365,"A few months ago, my husband and I went to pick our youngest up from college.  On our way home, she says, ""Next year when you come to get me, I want you to drop me off at the beginning of the Appalachian Trail.  I want to hike it home.""  We live a few miles from the Trail in VA.  I said that I would love to go with her.  This is how our plan to hike the Appalachian Trail started.  While I am overweight and have high blood pressure, I am relatively healthy and live a less than sedentary lifestyle.  My husband and I sometimes go for walks on the weekend.  What we do is nothing like hiking the Appalachian Trail.  Ever since I said I was going to hike the trail, I've been sick.  Now that I feel better, I am going to begin training in earnest.  Yesterday, we went to the Skyline Drive.  We hiked the South River Loop.  It was about 3.3 miles.  I took my time going down my husband and daughter went ahead with the dogs.  It seemed like the climb out took forever, but I made it!  I can do this!  Tomorrow, we are going on another hike.",,View Entry,"Jun 12, Mon",0
PegLeg,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568569,"Yesterday, I hiked to Dark Hollow Falls.  It was an easy hike.  I am trying to ease into training.  My hiking buddy went with me.  I'm not too sure of her trail name yet, So I will call her Bug.  She has been that to me since she was knee high to a grasshopper.  The hike itself was fun.  I was tired after, but I was also determined to swim a mile after.  After getting startled twice (it was dark).  I decided to call it a night.  Today, our plans include a rather fun hike to  white oak canyon/ Cedar run.  It is  ""strenuous"" and 8 miles.  I will see how I fare.  Also, I am starting to accumulate gear.  So far, not much, but I am getting excited.",,Dark,"Jun 14, Wed",0
PegLeg,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/568705,"So, yesterday, we went on a longer hike.  We went to White Oak Canyon and did the White Oak Canyon/ Cedar Run Loop.  The NPS was not kidding with their trail rating of strenuous.  Not being an ardent hiker, it was difficult.  It was however not impossible.  We probably should have turned back after half an hour, when the thunder started.  We listened to the thunder all the way up to the apex of our hike.  Then it started raining.  I wasn't concerned, I was already drenched with sweat.  Some of the rock stairs were tall, but not all of them.  It was SLOW going, but we did make it.  Maybe, it would have gone faster if there was no rain.  Maybe not.  I can do this hike by putting one foot in front of the other.  One step at a time.",,View Entry,"Jun 15, Thu",0
PegLeg,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/605642,"I had decided to wait until 2019 to begin my trek, because my father was in questionable health and my Aunt's health was failing. I didn't want to be on the trail and learned the worst had happened. That having been said, my aunt Kai has been a great inspiration for me.She always had a take no prisoners, unapologetic attitude. She lived her life with few regrets. That's my goal. I am determined not to succumb to the family curses (obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure). I already have two of those and am determined to become healthier. I have been trekking around the area recently. I am planning to train in earnest. My Dr. has told me to build up my quads and to work on my upper body because I have sticks for arms, besides the flab of course. I changed my trailname because my hiking group gave me the trail name. If you have met me, PegLeg would make sense. Or Ducky.",,View Entry,"Dec 05, Wed",0
PegLeg,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607090,"Everything is coming together in my prep for the Long Walk. I have been hibernating instead of walking, though. Last weekend and this, I went on a hike with Goldilocks, Captain Morgan, and a few others. Friday, I walked around town for a short walk. I still need to dehydrate more food, but I am getting packed this week so Goldilocks can give me a shakedown. I tried to talk Twinsie's Spouse into going with me, but she was apprehensive about pack weight and distance to walk. I am so excited to get going already. Less than 2 weeks!",,View Entry,"Feb 16, Sat",0
PegLeg,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608964,"We walked through what I expect will be majestically gorgeous in later seasons. Our path was lined with tall mountain laurels on either side. It was so quiet in the woods there.  As we passed through Gathland state park, we got closer to the main road. We heard road sounds all the way to the shelter after that.  After a cold walk uphill on ice and in sleet and freezing rain, Goldilocks and I arrived at the shelter. Our bottom layers were soaked with sweat and our top layers were wet from weather. We sealed the shelter with a fly and cooked dinner. After that, we rolled out out beds. Even with hot hands sandwiching my feet, tucked between my knees, under my bra and under my hat, I was still shivering all night. That is not an exaggeration. It was good that I was so close to home. the next day, we hiked to Weverton and my husband picked us up there. I went home to reevaluate my equipment and also visit with Bug because she was on spring break. I was waiting a few weeks for warmer weather. Also, I find that SNP is still clearing winter storm damage. I will restart from Harpers Ferry on the 29th with much shorter hikes to begin with.","Washington Monument State Park, MD
