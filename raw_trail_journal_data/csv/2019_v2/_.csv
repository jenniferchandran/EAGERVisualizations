???,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604277,"Last Saturday I took an in & out hike on the Big Butt Trail in the Pisgah National Forest north of Asheville with my friend Caroline. We were caught in a few showers which gave me a chance to test out my new Outdoor Research Helium II rain jacket. I wasn't disappointed. Despite the fact that it was super humid and I was already warmed up, I found it dry and breathable. Woo hoo! The weather did clear up later and we enjoyed a nice sunset on the way out.Side note, I also tried on my down coat under my OR rain jacket upon my return and was pleased to find that it fit nicely underneath. I was a bit worried because the rain jacket was a good fit (without under layers) and I was staring to wonder whether I should have sized up. I'm happy that I will also be able to use this rain jacket as a dry shell during the winter portion of my thru-hike.",,View Entry,"Oct 10, Wed",0
???,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/604521,"I spent this past weekend in Hot Springs, NC. I did some light hiking on the AT, NOBO out of town, past Lover's Leap. It was an In & Out from Hot Springs campground and back. This weekend was more of a leisurely one to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday, so I wasn't too concerned with making miles on the trail.We enjoyed the cooler weather and I had the opportunity to test out my new full length under quilt for my hammock (gifted and rigged up by my boyfriend). I was TOASTY! I still may need a more substantial sleeping bag liner for Feb/March weather as I sleep cold. We also soaked in the hot tubs at the spa and had a delicious dinner at Iron Horse Station!I am looking forward to hitting the town of Hot Springs early in my 2019 thru-hike. I know that it will feel like coming home and hopefully there will be some familiar faces of family and friends there to greet me. Also, I will be familiar with many sections of the AT leading up to and following this town--Max Patch, Big Bald, Grayson Highlands, Iron Mountain, and Roan Mountain areas so I'll sure that this stretch will be comforting.",,View Entry,"Oct 14, Sun",0
