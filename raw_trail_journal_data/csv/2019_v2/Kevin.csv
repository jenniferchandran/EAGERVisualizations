Kevin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610238,"When I was 11 years old, my dad took me to Yosemite for my first backpacking trip. I think it was 6 days and 5 nights and after the first day of hiking all I wanted to do was be anywhere but Yosemite. My back hurt, my feet were sore - I was dirty and the food sucked. I couldn't see how I would keep going for five more days... but I did. Every day I felt a little stronger, I bonded more with the other kids and hikers in our group - I made it up Halfdome and made it out the other side with a great sense of accomplishments and memories that will last my whole life. But I definitely didn't think after that - ""why don't I do this for six months""?
I went on many more trips during high school and college but after college got a demanding job in Boston and caught up in trying to make ends meet - pay rent, student loans, and try to save anything I could. I went over 3 years without spending a night in the woods. 
Finally, I made my way back to NH and rediscovered my love for the outdoors. I would do a lot of day hikes and some weekend trips and every time it never seemed long enough. I wanted more - a bigger adventure where I could really challenge myself, meet new people, see new places, feel how I felt in Yosemite.

After a lot of research, thinking things over and talking with friends and family - I decided that 2019 would be the year I did the Appalachian Trail. I'm 27 years old and the timing would probably never be better. I don't own a home, I'm not in a committed relationship, and finally have the financial ability to make it happen. 
I started I've never done a solo overnight hike before - now I'll be spending 5-6 months in the woods. It certainly is a little nerve racking but I'm much more excited than anything. I can't wait for all of the memories I'll make, the people I'll meet, and the lessons I'll learn. It should be one hell of a ride.

Kevin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611317,"Week 1 is in the books and things are off to a great start. I’ve gone 110 miles so far and feeling good overall. Staying in Franklin, NC tonight to rest and resupply and then back at it tomorrow.I started at Amicalola Falls last Monday, registered as a a thru hiked and did orientation and instantly met another hiker, Clark, who I have been hiking with since.Stayed at Springer Mountain Shelter the first night and mistakenly put my tent under a “widow maker” (dead overhanging tree). Woke up in the middle of the night to it creeping above me and ran into the shelter. While talking about it the next morning I received my trail name, Crypter, from a Air Force veteran (he said it was a term they would use for out of commission planes - what I could have been if I had stayed put). Its unique and stuck - so I’ve got a kick out of telling the story and will not make that mistake again.I’ve met tons of people already. The names I can remember so far are Camelback Santa, Soup, Ragnar, Death by Snoring, Phoenix, Catch Up, Flavor Town, Rev, Sunshine, Poppins, Phat D, Chef, Copilot, Rainman, Indie, Memorial, Fisher, Wind, Cloud, Peach, and many more people that don’t have trail names yet. I’ve only had one bad day so far, staying on top of Tray Mountain (4200’) after hiking through snow and sleet when temps dropped into the 30’s. My sleeping bag and liner kept me warm but it was a very long night. Most days have been 65-75 degrees although nights generally get into the 40’s. I go to sleep and wake up with sunset and sunrise typically and hike 8-10 hours per day. Most full days I’ll do 15 miles with my longest day so far being 16.5. The difficulty can vary a lot depending on elevation changes and weather but I’ve already summitted 5 4000 footers including Standing Indian Mountain at 5435 ft.I’ve had some blisters and a bad sunburn but overall cant complain. Can tell I’ve already lost some weight- it is very difficult to have an appetite to eat enough when you’re burning so many calories every day. Meeting lots of great people and have a group of 3 I’ve been hiking with (myself plus Clark, Tim, and Camelback Santa). I should be in the Smokies in a few days which is one of the most beautiful areas of the trail and will try to send another update when I’m out (service is generally pretty bad on the trail, at least so far). Katahdin here I come!","

Kevin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613146,"Sorry for the long delay- WiFi has been tough to come by on trail. I’m now 345 miles in and still going strong. Staying in Erwin, TN today to rest up and relax and then will be back at it tomorrow.
Ive been in NC/TN for three weeks now. The three guys I started hiking with have had to take zero days (days you don’t hike) for injuries and so I’m now a couple days ahead but I’ve met plenty of new people and always see friendly faces when I stop for the night at shelters.
The toughest section of the trail for me so far were the Smoky Mountains which I reached on 4/30. I was greeted a couple miles after entering the Smokies by a 4 foot Rattle Snake in the trail. I heard it when I about ten feet away and bushwacked around it. I heard a lot about Bears and Wild Boar in the Smokies but didn’t see a single one. There were plenty of deer though and they were not shy about getting close to humans. I had one walk up to me as I was resting on a log and hit within about 20 yards.
In addition to lots of challenging terrain and elevation gain, the Smokies has far fewer water sources and strict restrictions on where you could camp. The shelters were all packed with lots of section hikers and sometimes would have over 20 people at them meaning I would have to find a rough spot to throw the tent up.
I also was dealing with some large blisters and got a nice burn on my knee from spilling boiling water so safe to say the Smokies were a challenging section for me.
Luckily, my Dad and his friend Chris met me halfway into the Smokies (we had planned this before I left) and cooked a great dinner of burgers and potatoes that raised my spirits a lot. My brother Paul joined after the Smokies as well and hiked a challenging section with me featuring 3000 feet of elevation gain in 7 miles.
It was awesome to have Paul, Chris and my dad on the trail and they left my with plenty of food for the next leg of the trip.
I’ve hiked about 90 miles since they’ve left including mostly rural NC terrain and the town of Hot Springs, NC that the trail literally goes right through. I enjoyed a big dinner at the local diner with a bunch of other hikers and stayed at a motel in town. My friend Achilles and I saw some local kids playing basketball and joined them for a fun game of HORSE. It was one of the more enjoyable times I’ve had in town and the kids seemed mesmerized by meeting someone from NH that was 6’ 3”. 
My body is definitely getting used to hiking now and I’ve been able to do a couple of 20 mile days this week. My blisters are gone now and I am mostly pain free. I have lost about 10 pounds as well- it is very difficult to eat enough to maintain weight when you’re burning 4-5,000 calories a day. I try to eat as much as possible when I’m in towns and might have eaten a whole pepperoni pizza last weekend.
Overall, I’m in good spirits mentally and physically and excited for the next stretch. There hasn’t been a single day where I thought for a second about getting off trail. I should be in VA within 10 days.

Kevin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614234,"I’m sure most of you have heard about the tragic events on the trail since my last post. The trail is a well connected community and I learned there had been an attack the morning it happened but heard conflicting reports about how many people were involved and how serious it was. Sadly, the day after it was confirmed a thru hiker names Ron Sanchez (“Stronghold”) passed away. Ron was about 200 miles north of me and I didn’t know him or anyone near the attack but it certainly was shocking and very sad. There are a number of great articles about Ron, a veteran who served 3 tours in Iraq and found solace in the woods, and I especially liked this one - https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.providencejournal.com/news/20190520/traumatized-ex-soldier-died-trying-to-find-peace-on-appalachian-trail%3ftemplate=ampart - . It is terrible what happened but I still firmly believe the most dangerous part of the AT is your drive to the trailhead. This was the actions of one crazed individual and incidents along the trail are extremely rare. I’ve personally never felt unsafe on the trail and have not let what happened affect how I hike or approach strangers. I’ve noticed the AT community really coming together in the wake of this incident and many pictures and tributes to Ron along the trail. If I hear of a fundraiser or way to help honor him I will post on here.On a lighter note, I have made it to VA and am just about a quarter of the way through the trail. It’s crazy to think it has already been over 5 weeks. Slowly but surely, my body is getting used to the pack and walking all day and I feel like a well tuned hiker now. I’ve hiked 135 miles in the past 7 days including a marathon day (26.2 miles) and should be able to increase my pace a lot in VA.Tennessee featured some difficult terrain in the northern part of the state including the Roan Highlands - a series of 5000+ foot mountains and balds that can be very cold and windy. I suffered through some freezing cold mornings where temps dropped into the 30’s with biting wind chills but survived with all my fingers and toes intact. It took some long days, but I made it to Damascus, VA on Saturday (5/18) for Trail Days. It is a big hiker festival that draws a lot of alumni and current hikers together. Think of a cross between the Sandwich Fair and a Grateful Dead concert. There were tons of booths set up to repair and showcase gear from all the major hiking brands as well as free food, showers, live music, games, and gear giveaways. One night was plenty for me but I got to see tons of people I’ve met during my hike including friends I hadn’t seen for weeks and overall had a great time.The trail has been pretty crowded after Damascus but I’m enjoying it. I’ve had a nice bubble of 8-10 hikers that have been at every shelter with me the past few days. The highlight so far if VA has been the Grayson Highlands which featured amazing views and wild ponies all along the trail. We had a great campfire and stayed up late talking and telling stories last night and I’m now in Marion, VA resting and resupplying with a few other hikers.Weather has been great so far in VA, looking to do 100 miles in the next 5 days and my next stop will be Pearisburg. I appreciate all the support and thanks for reading.-Kevin “Crypter”

Kevin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/614768,"Well, after being mostly injury free for the first six weeks of my hike I’ve been sidelined with shin splints. For those of you who haven’t experienced them before, it’s a common overuse injury where your tendon starts to detach from your shin bone. I started feeling pain in my left leg leaving Marion but aches and pains are typical while hiking long distance and didn’t think much of it initially. Unfortunately, the pain got worse and I realized it wasn’t something that was going to go away. I was in a tough spot though, being 20 miles from Marion and 30 miles from the next road crossing. I didn’t want to backtrack so (with a lot of help from Advil) hiked through the pain for a couple days and was very fortunate to find a ride from a church group doing “trail magic” (giving out free food and sometimes toiletries to hikers) at a dirt road crossing.I made my way to Bland, VA (about as exciting as the name implies) and was dropped off at the only motel in town on Saturday. The owners quickly informed me they were all booked up. I asked if they knew of anywhere else to stay and they told me my best chance was to go into Wytheville, a much bigger town 15 miles south. I got a ride from a local named Bubba to a small motel on the edge of town and have now been resting up, icing heavily, and doing rehabilitation stretches for three days waiting for my leg to heal. I also got a ride from the cleaning lady at the motel to a mall and got to watch a movie and get my first haircut since starting. At first it was nice having some down time but I’m definitely ready to get back on the trail now. Shin splints can linger and I’ve talked to multiple hikers who have said it is usually a 2-4 day healing process and you need to slowly work back up to big mileage. I’m hoping to get back on the trail tomorrow and will probably be doing only 8-12 miles a day for the next week.Most hikers on the AT get some sort of injury along the way and I’m not letting it dampen my spirits. I have some friends as well that I started hiking with who will now catch up to me which will be nice. Minor setback and I’m hoping to be back to 20 mile days in a couple weeks. I will keep you all up to date, I got off trail at mile 585 and should hit 600 before the end of the week. - Kevin “Crypter”","Marion, VA

Kevin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/615478,"My shin splints are getting better, slowly but surely. I was really disappointed when I first had to get off trail because I was finally starting to feel good doing high mileage days (18-20 miles for me). I had become very single minded on accomplishing mileage goals and hitting one checkpoint after another. 300 miles, then 400, 500. But I also think I was not fully enjoying all the trail had to offer- the viewpoints, the hostels, the downtime in trail towns with friends. Those are really what makes the trail so enjoyable, the hiking is more the work you do to reap those rewards.Since my injury, I’ve been taking things slow and enjoying the trail a lot more. I’ve met a lot more people and had a number of “old” friends catch up to me again. I stayed at two amazing hostels this week including Woods Hole Hostel - one of the oldest on trail that features a picturesque bunkhouse, gardens, farm animals and dogs running around and the best homemade meals I’ve had so far in the trail. I ended up liking it so much I stayed two nights. It’s one of the places that really highlights the trail community and I hope to visit again someday.I finally left the motel in Wytheville last Wednesday and have been taking it easy, doing 10 or so miles a day. My leg still has some tightness and gets sore after a long day of hiking but is definitely improving. Doing low mileage has allowed me to sleep in late, spend more time at shelters and enjoy cool spots along the trail like Dismal Falls- one of my favorite spots so far that had cliffs over a swimming hole (picture is me jumping in- it was pretty cold). I ended up spending two hours there with about 15 other hikers and had a great time.This next stretch will be a tough one- 90 miles to the next town with few hostels and resupply options along the way- but I’m resting up today in Pearisburg and am ready to start increasing my mileage. Hopefully I’ll be back to full strength soon but for now I’m enjoying the ride.- Kevin “Crypter”

Kevin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616186,"This week certainly had its ups and downs. On the bright side, my shin splints have healed as well as I could have hoped and I was able to up my mileage with minimal pain. On the other hand, this week was by far the worst weather I’ve experienced in the trail.It rained a bit on Wednesday as I was leaving Pearisburg, then poured Thursday through Sunday with no breaks at all. I knew I’d have to hike through the rain plenty on the AT- it’s part of the challenge of thru hiking that you have to hike in all weather on the trail. But I had been pretty fortunate so far to have minimal rainy days on the trail- that all changed this week.Hiking in the rain can be very mentally exhausting. I wasn’t just wet this week, I was drenched. All my hiking clothes were soaked and I had no ability to dry them. Waking up and putting on wet socks, underwear and shirts is a demoralizing feeling. My hands and feet looked like prunes for hours even after I got to shelters and I was honestly worried I might get trench foot or something. My phone got wet and wouldn’t work making communication very difficult. And the smell of wet and sweaty hiker clothes when people are packed into small shelters is just awful. I also passed by two of the marquee sites on the trail - Dragon’s Tooth and McAfee Knob - where all you could see were clouds. The descent from Dragon’s Tooth was extremely challenging because of how steep it was and the large, wet slabs of rock I had to navigate down. It was very tedious and nerve racking at times wedging my feet into slippery foot holds and holding on to anything I could with my hands. I don’t have pictures because of my phone issues but it’s worth a google.Sunday night I finally got a break by making it to a hostel. The hostel offered a shuttle to an all you can eat southern restaurant that was amazing and I had a great time playing cards and chatting with about 20 other hikers also seeking refuge from the weather. It didn’t, however, have any towels for the shower which was pretty odd and disappointing. Despite the weather, I gained more and more confidence in my leg and did two 17 mile days as well as an 18. It was probably more than I wanted to do (was hoping to stick to 15s) but my options were usually limited to a 10 or so mile day or a 17 or 18 if I wanted a roof over my head in a shelter (which I definitely did). I’m taking a day off today and should be back to full strength this week.Having a day off has been nice and allowed me to visit a great outfitter in town where I upgraded my sleeping bag, pad and water filtration system - cutting almost three pounds out of my bag. It may not sound like much but makes a huge difference over hundreds of miles and should help take strain off my legs.I’m excited to get back to the trail tomorrow with the new gear and will cross the 1/3 of the way mark about a mile after leaving town. I’m on pace to reach Katahdin in early October but hope to pick up the pace a bit and get there for September. Finally, I want to wish a very happy 65th wedding anniversary to my amazing grandparents Ed and Barbara Vanderhey. I knew I would miss out on some things when I decided to do the trail and was sad I couldn’t be with my family to celebrate last weekend. I was able to FaceTime them from the hostel which definitely lifted my spirits. My grandparents are a huge inspiration and very supportive- 65 years together and still going strong! If you’re still reading this, I appreciate all the support- it means a lot. Until next time.- Kevin “Crypter”

Kevin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/616915,"I made it into Waynesboro today after my longest stretch on the trail since my injury - 7 days, 6 nights and 130 miles since Daleville. Along the way I saw a naked man, a glass dinosaur, three deer and some amazing views. Now views and deer are pretty common, the other two you might be wondering about. This stretch was a lot of fun in that I was able to up my mileage again, hike with friends, and the weather was great. But part of the excitement of the AT is you never know what you’re going to see or who you might meet on a given day. After traveling three days and 57 miles from Daleville, I hitch-hiked for the first time into the small town of Glasgow. I was with two friends at the time and it was pretty easy. Along the trail, people get used to seeing AT hikers hitching (backpacks and trekking poles are a dead give away) and you can usually find a ride wherever you need to go. Glasgow was unique in that it had a town run shelter with a shower, trash cans and porta-potties  - a thru hikers dream. It also featured a twenty foot tall glass dinosaur in the middle of town. Besides that I think it had two gas stations, an Italian restaurant I went to that evening and a dollar general. Safe to say they are known for the dinosaur. A couple days later I was hiking up to a road crossing when I saw a man probably in his sixties walking down the trail in sandals, a backpack and nothing else. He acted like it was the most normal thing in the world and said something like “great day isn’t it?” I just looked straight at the ground and replied “yup” and went on my way. The AT is weird sometimes.I’ve wanted to do a write up about trail lingo for a while and figured this would be a good time to do so as I did my first “hero” day this week and found out I’ll have a good amount of friends “aqua blazing” the Shenandoahs next week. Below is a list of definitions for common AT phrases.Zero day - pretty self explanatory, a day you don’t hike. Typically a day you stay in town or in a hostel.Nero- a day you hike less than ten miles, frequently a short day you hike into town and then spend the night.Hero Day - a day you go into town to resupply and still hike 15+ miles. I did mine into Buena Vista, VA. Picked up new shoes at the post office, got food at the dollar store, then cut my insoles to fit the shoes and packed up my bag at a booth in a Hardee’s before getting back on trail.White blazing - following the exact path of the AT. Purist - someone who follows only the white blazes and does every possible mile of the entire trail. I would put myself in this category.Blue blazing - taking side trails or shortcuts to cut mileage while on AT. Yellow Blazing - getting in a car to skip miles or sections of the AT. Very frowned upon by purists.Aqua blazing - floating by canoe or raft down the Shenandoah river to bypass hiking the Shenandoah National Park. Bit of a gray area.Slackpacking - having someone stage all of your gear except food and water for the day up the trail so you can hike a section without the weight of your whole pack. Typically offered by hostels for a fee.Trail Magic - free food or goods (toilet paper, hand sanitizer, etc) set up to help thru hikers - typically at parking lots or road crossings. Always a treat and often done by former thru hikers.Trail Angels - people who do trail magic or give hikers free rides or places to stay. Some of the nicest people you’ll ever meet.I’m sure there’s a lot I’m forgetting- I’ll try to do another list later in my hike. All in all though, things are going great. I’m staying at my friend Fisher’s house near Waynesboro tonight (he graciously offered to let me stay for free and even gave me free food from a grocery store he owns) and will be heading into Shenandoah National Park tomorrow which features some of the easiest (in terms of elevation gain) terrain on the AT. I’m hoping to be out of Virginia and cross the Mason- Dixon lone in a couple weeks. I’ve already been in VA for a month and will be glad to see another state line. Thanks to everyone still reading this and sending support - it means a lot.- Kevin “Crypter”

Kevin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/617440,"This week I entered the second major National Park of my thru hike, Shenandoah NP, and it did not disappoint. After having somewhat mixed feelings about the Smokies due to overcrowding, lack of water sources, and difficult terrain, the Shenandoahs were one of my favorite parts of the trip.The trail in SNP is just over 100 miles and it is relatively easy compared to the rest of the trail so far. There were no major climbs, well groomed trails, and so many facilities. It was like being in a hiking dream to walk by facilities every day with trash cans, bathrooms, and running water. In addition, the trail follows Skyline Drive fairly closely and crosses over it a number of times. With this being the case, there were multiple “Waysides” (casual restaurants), lodges, and camping areas to eat at or stay at. These were a huge treat and allowed me to carry far less food than normal.The first night in SNP, I stayed at Loft Mountain Campground- sharing a site with five other hikers. I met a Park Ranger named Mark who told me he had thru hiked in 1974, one of only 30 people to complete the trail that year. He drove me and my friend Camelback Santa to a nearby restaurant and shared stories from his trip while I enjoyed a steak and cheese, french fries, and ice cream. When we got back to the campground we found out an amazing Trail Angel named Tambourine was giving out trail magic and I got a dessert of hot dogs and Doritos.I did 20 mile days four out of five days in the park including a 22 yesterday that was my longest since the injury. I finally feel like I’m completely back to full strength and it’s a great feeling. When I started, I had little doubt I could complete the trail but the injury certainly gave me second thoughts. Now that it’s healed up, I’m fully confident I can do this.I was sad to leave the Shenandoahs yesterday but can’t wait to be out of Virginia. It’s a beautiful state, but I’ve already spent five weeks here and it’s time for a change. I’ll pass the 1000 mile mark in two days and be in historic Harper’s Ferry, VA by Sunday in all likelihood. I’ve certainly gained a new appreciation for the South but looking forward to crossing the Mason-Dixon Line and getting closer to friends and family in the north. The next week should be full of milestones as I’ll likely hike through four states (VA, WV, MD, PA). There are only 40 miles of trail in WV and MD and some people do it in 24 hours in what’s called the Four State Challenge. I’ll probably do it in 2 as that sounds miserable to me.

Kevin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618541,"It’s been a while since my last post so this will be a long one, bear with me. Since my last post I’ve covered over 200 miles and been in three new states. I’ve crossed the halfway point as well as the Mason-Dixon Line and it feels good to be back in the north after spending over 5 weeks in VA alone. Once I finished the Shenandoahs, I only had about 40 miles left in Virginia but man were they tough. The last section of VA is known as the “roller coaster” and lived up to its name. It featured about 8 climbs and descents on mostly rocky terrain - over 5500 feet of climbing. On top of that, it was very humid and 85 degrees. I hiked almost 20 miles that day and it was probably the single toughest day on the trail for me but made it through and was in Harper’s Ferry, West Virginia the next day.Harper’s Ferry was awesome, it is the “spiritual halfway point” of the trail and the trail goes right through the historic downtown including the site of John Brown’s raid. It also has the Appalachian Trail Center national office where I got my picture taken and saved in the hiker records for posterity.There are only 4 actual trail miles in WV and then only 42 in Maryland. MD featured wide, well maintained trail with little elevation gain and the nicest shelters yet. It was also much less remote than the southern states and I walked across multiple roads and state parks. The trail also goes by a number of Civil War sites (the trail goes close to where the Battle if Antietam took place) that I made sure to explore. I was also treated to a meatloaf and potato dinner by longtime family friend Chris Horsch who met me at a shelter the second night I was in MD. Thanks again Chris!I crossed the Mason-Dixon Line and made it to Pennsylvania on July 3rd. Southern PA was relatively flat and crosses multiple cornfields and developed areas. It certainly felt strange walking by people’s houses and through someone’s backyard even. I crossed the actual halfway point my first day in PA and then went to Pine Grove Furnace for the Fourth of July with some friends. There is a store there where there is a thru hiker tradition of trying the “Half Gallon Challenge” - eating a half gallon of ice cream in one sitting. I eat an early and light lunch in preparation and was able to complete it in under 30 minutes. I then ate trail magic KFC about an hour later. Thru hiker hunger is no joke.A few days later one of my good friends from Colby, Forrest, picked me up at a road crossing and I spent a needed rest day at his parents house in Lancaster eating sandwiches, hamburgers, hot dogs and watermelon as well as catching up (I hadn’t seen Forrest in over a year). Thank you Forrest, Mark and Deb for the hospitality!Pennsylvania doesn’t have a lot of big mountains but has a lot of rocks, mud and snakes. I’ve seen 7 since I’ve been here including a big rattlesnake yesterday that let me know it wasn’t happy with how close I came to it. I’m feeling good physically and I think I’m catching up to the bubble because there are a lot of hikers around now. I’ll stay in Port Clinton tonight and should be in New Jersey by Monday. Until next time.- Kevin “Crypter”

Kevin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/619729,"I am so close to New England now it feels kind of surreal. Almost two thirds of the way through the trail and the last two weeks have been awesome. The middle portion of the trail has had a distinctly different feel to it than the south had. It doesn’t feel as remote now - towns are closer together, there are a lot more people on the trail (day/section hikers especially), and frequent highway/road crossings. I can definitely tell I’m in more densely populated areas which is nice because I can travel light (carry less food) and there are a lot more services/stores close to the trail. It also doesn’t hurt having decent cell service most of the time.New Jersey only has about 50 miles of trail but was a fun state. It featured board walks, a wildlife refuge, and lots of trail magic. It wasn’t particularly difficult but the heat wave did mean I had to alter my strategy a bit. The temperature got into the 90’s my second day in NJ with a heat index over 100. This meant that I really didn’t want to hike through the hottest part of the day and would try to get most of my miles done in the morning. The first town I stopped at in NJ to was actually just over the border in NY - Unionville. I stopped and got pizza there with two friends, Zippy and Diggs, and a local pastor (former thru hiker names Bonzai) let us use his house to shower and get out of the sun. We didn’t really want to go back out into the heat and heard about a local drive in that let thru hikers camp and watch movies for free so got a ride to the theater in Warwick and had a great time watching the Lion King and eating popcorn and candy. There were probably 15 thru hikers there that night including a few friends I hadn’t seen in weeks and it was a lot of fun.We crossed over into New York on Sunday and finally the weather cooled down the next day. New York was possibly my favorite state so far - gentle terrain, delis and parks along the trail, and plenty of lakes to swim in. Swimming is something I’ve really missed being on the trail and it felt great to go to a beach and cool off in an actual lake for once. The trail also went directly through a zoo near Fort Montgomery, NY for about a quarter mile- probably the most unique stretch so far.The highest point in New York is bear mountain at just over 1300 feet so there weren’t many tough climbs and descents. I did the 85 or so miles in New York in 5 days and am feeling great. I’ll be in CT today (Friday) and MA on Monday. I’ve been moving at a good pace through the easier middle states and should be able to meet my goal of finishing in five months (before September 16). I’m really excited to return to New England where I have lots of friends and family close by. I can’t wait to get back on trail today after spending last night at an inn - resting up and enjoying some NY pizza. Until next time.- Kevin “Crypter”

Kevin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620543,"10 states down, 3 to go! It seems like just last week I was in VA. The mid Atlantic and northern states really have flown by and I can’t believe I will be back in New Hampshire in 10 days or so. Since Harper’s Ferry, I have averaged 17.5 miles per day. I averaged under 14 for the first half of the trail. I’m feeling good mentally and physically. The miles and days seem to just melt away at this point.New England has been a lot of fun so far. I haven’t seen hardly any rain and have got to visit areas that I have never seen before despite living here my whole life.Connecticut was short (about 50 miles) and I flew through it, spending only two nights in the state. There were a couple very nice flat stretches along rivers and I got burgers and watermelon at a trail magic stop the second day. Besides that, Bear Mountain was a beautiful view and the bugs were really bad (I’m talking 20 bugs swarming around your head bad) but it wasn’t particularly memorable.I heard a lot about MA being an easy state and it lived up to its reputation. Clean, wide trails and nice campsites and shelters. I stayed in Great Barrington and then the trail went directly through the towns of Dalton, Cheshire, and North Adams. In MA you walk through some neighborhoods and even someone’s back yard - it didn’t feel very remote but was a really fun state with a lot of great people. To say I’ve been shown kindness by strangers along the trail would be an understatement. So many folks have helped me along the way and a couple trail angels in MA really stood out. Papa Joe lives in Great Barrington and gave me a free ride to and from the trail head. He also left water for me and other hikers at a trailhead in a particular dry stretch and gave me fuel when I was out and had no idea how I’d get more. He gives rides to hikers constantly during the summer and asks nothing in return, a truly awesome guy. Tom Levardi lives in Dalton, MA and has been letting hikers sleep on his lawn for 40 years. He provided me and four other hikers not only a place to stay but also cheese and crackers, snacks, and coffee and donuts in the morning. He even let my cousin park in his yard. I’ll be sure to send cards to Tom and Joe as well as many other trail angels after this is over. There were a few highlights in MA - I got to stay at one of the more unique places in the trail, the Upper Goose Pond Cabin. The cabin was donated to the AMC for hiker use and is only a half mile off the trail. There were two caretakers, Maggie and Sara, who gave me the lay of the land and made everyone pancakes and coffee in the morning. I got there early in the afternoon and decided to take a half day so spent the rest of the day swimming, reading and hanging out with other hikers on the porch. It was a great place to spend the afternoon and watch a sunset from the docks. I also met up with my cousin Tyler and uncle Jim for Mt Greylock, the highest peak in MA. Greylock was the biggest mountain I climbed since VA and you can see 5 states from its peak. It is a historic mountain for many reasons but is pretty commercialized with a road up to the summit and restaurant near the peak. It was great to have Tyler and Jim along for the journey and we spent the night in Williamstown. Jim even got me my own hotel room and a full resupply while Tyler brought me new shoes, bug spray and soap. Thanks for the support guys! I crossed into Vermont on Sunday and did 60 miles in 3 days to make it to Manchester. In VT, the AT coincides with the Long Trail for 105 miles until it splits east toward Hanover, NH. Vermont has certainly felt like I’m back in the wilderness again - few road crossings, rough trail, and no cell service. It’s been nice after being in more developed areas for a while. I’m staying at one of the more we’ll known hostels on the trail, Green Mountain Hostel, tonight and probably taking a zero day tomorrow here. Next up, my brother Zack will join for Killington and then on to Hanover, NH! -Kevin “Crypter”

Kevin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622199,"I’m currently sitting in a hostel in Carrabassett Valley watching the rain come down and enjoying a day off. Since my last update I’ve gone through the hardest stretch on the trail, the White Mountains and Southern Maine, and Katahdin is almost in site. The end is close, less than 200 miles away now and people are starting to think about things like finish dates and what they will be doing post trail. As many hikers at this stage, I’m filled with a mixture of emotions. A sense of almost surreal bemusement at how I possibly hiked this far and excitement that a goal I have been working towards for almost five months is almost complete. But also a feint and growing sadness that this amazing journey is almost over. New Hampshire was challenging for sure but amazing and one of my favorite sections. I had hiked a lot in the Whites before doing the trail but it was an entirely different experience this time around. The Whites just had a different feel to them than other sections of the trail. I found it similar to when I played basketball, like mentally preparing for a playoff game versus a team you know you should beat easily. Mileage expectations went out the window as some 15 mile days in the Whites were harder than a 22 in Virginia. The climbs were tough, the descents were tougher, and the views were just epic.I got lots of hospitality at the AMC huts along the way and ate plenty of left over sausage and eggs (in exchange for washing some dishes). I only stayed at one hut though, Lake of the Clouds near the summit of Washington, and went to hostels, friends houses (shoutout Renee and Pete) or stealth camped the other nights. While every day in the Whites was difficult, the descent down after Washington and Madison was particularly tough on the body/knees. The trail is above tree line for almost 12 miles in that section and you navigate from cairn to cairn on lots of loose rock and boulder fields. My knees were hurting really badly after but all I could think of was how fortunate I was that it wasn’t raining. After Washington, two of my friends from work, John and Ryan, came and joined me for Wildcats and got a taste of the trail. I met up with my dad and family friend Chris Horsch that night and ate a great hamburger and potatoes dinner. I had been planning to go home that weekend and my dad left a car for me at a trailhead in Gorham to drive down to the lakes region.After not driving for four months it felt very strange to be behind the wheel again and I think I went about 10 miles under the speed limit for the first half an hour before I got my bearings.Being home was great and I got to see a lot of friends and family for the first time since I left. I ate tons of food and slept in a bed for three nights in a row- what a treat. I got back on the trail a week ago today and hiked through another very difficult stretch in Maine featuring Mahoosuc Notch, Old Speck, the Crockers, and lots of mud and rough trail. Maine definitely has a different feel to it, more remote and rugged than New Hampshire with far fewer people on the trail. I stayed at a hostel in Andover and then hiked two hard days to Carrabsset Valley. I now have exactly 189 miles left and think I can finish by September 14th at the latest, putting me right under my initial goal of five months. I’ll miss the hell out of this trail but definitely looking forward to having a warm bed and indoor plumbing again. A shave and haircut will also be nice. My next post will be a post-trail recap. On to Katahdin! - Kevin “Crypter”

Kevin,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622967,"After almost 5 months and 6 million steps, I reached the summit of Katahdin around 1:30 pm on September 13th, 2019. It was a long and amazing journey, I met so many wonderful people and saw views that took my breath away. I hiked in rain, baking sun, whipping winds, sleet and snow. I crossed 14 states and 2,192 trail miles, taking it one day at a time. Now I can finally say I officially thru hiked the entire Appalachian Trail, every single mile.As I walked up the final miles to the summit of Katahdin, I thought back to sitting at my dads house the day before leaving for the trail dreaming about making it to that famed summit. Back then, it seemed so distant and abstract. I knew I was capable of accomplishing this feat but that the journey would be a long and difficult one. So many things could happen along the way - sickness, injury, gear braking or events happening at home that might take me off the trail. I knew the statistics - that less than 1 in 4 people who set out from Georgia ever reach the end - and that this would be an enormous and challenging journey that would push me to my limits. I was worried about bears and falling trees and ticks and much more.But through it all, I had tons of support from family and friends that always got me through the tough days. My body became fine tuned to long days of walking and my pack got lighter as I figured out what I really needed and what I could do without. I made lifelong friends and got help from countless strangers along the way. What seemed so foreign became familiar. I started to feel at peace in the woods and truly enjoyed almost every day on the trail. I am so grateful for this experience and it ended up being everything I was hoping it would be. I made friendships and memories that will last a lifetime and gained a new perspective on life and what’s really important. I will now be returning to work and moving to the next chapter of my life but the trail will always be apart of me. I look forward to the future and am filled with optimism. I want to thank everyone who has supported me along the way - I couldn’t have done it alone. - Kevin “Crypter”
