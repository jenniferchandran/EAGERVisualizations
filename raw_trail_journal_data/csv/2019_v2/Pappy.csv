Pappy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/607854,"Last year we left off at Cheshire and this year we will pick up right where we left off.  We will switch over to completely hammocks using double whoopie slings and pole to hang next to each other with a larger tarp.  We have dropped another 12oz each from our pack weight, we will keep on adjusting our gear as we go.  We have taken several practice hikes even with snowshoes!  ",,Rutland VT,"Mar 10, Sun",0
Pappy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608013,"As I work in Vermont it is easy to drive to Manchester Center and take the bus to Bennington and then the other bus to Williamstown and then the other bus to North Adams and then the other bus to Walmart and then the other bus to Cheshire where we left off.  Whew!  We will stay at the Green Mountain House the night before our journey, hope to visit Lincoln's sons home near there.  Working out three times a week and doing hikes in the Loess hills, learning to love that stepper! Not!",,View Entry,"Mar 13, Wed",0
Pappy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608014,When I get to Vermont I forgot to mention I will do a short hike from Manchester up to Rutland.  I usually hike the Long Trail too at some point.  Looking forward to the AT hike this year.  Maybe next summer we can do more than ten days.  We had hoped to do Smokeys and Shenandoah in the not too distant future.,,View Entry,"Mar 13, Wed",0

Pappy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609868,"We have made some minor changes to gear.  Did get my wife a camp stool for 17 ounces, that is her luxury item.  Our first night is at Bascom Lodge on the top of Mt. Greylock, we really enjoy that place.  After that we are roughing it all the way.  My pack is right at 25lbs with food and water, Grammy's is at 23.5lbs.  We have been working out twice a week and adding hikes several times a week.  Lots of stretching and core work.  I hit the stepper, my nemesis.  Last summer the grandkids hiked part of Greylock with us, more of that in the future we hope?",,View Entry,"Apr 07, Sun",0
Pappy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610687,"We have been faithfully working out.  Grammy usually passes me and gets to the summits then waits for me.  At 6'5"", 275 It is a load to carry up but I have been doing the stepper and steps where I work.  We are getting very nostalgic for the trail.  Had such a good time last year.  Our time at the Cookie Lady's house was so special.  She needed someone from Iowa for her book and we were it!  I must have eaten half a dozen hardboiled eggs.  We talked with her for quite awhile and picked blueberries which we added to our oatmeal the next day.  She is a treasure.",,View Entry,"Apr 17, Wed",0
Pappy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618523,"We had a beautiful day to begin hike.  Stayed at Green Mtn Hostel in Manchester then bus to Bennington, bus to Williamstown, bus to N. Adams, bus to Walmart, bus to Cheshire!  Began hiking at 11am, reservation at Bascom Lodge for great meal and room.","Cheshire, MA

Pappy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618524,"Heading down the hill.  Thank the Lord for switchbacks!  Looks scarey in AWOL's guide but actually wasn't as bad as down to highway 9 in Bennington.  The rain complicated matters but then we called The Willows motel and they picked us up, wonderful overnight and great Greek food next door.  Met John and Mary and made some good friends.  The motel gave us ride back to trail as well, great people.","Hwy 2 Mass Ave

Pappy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618527,"This little Tarp from HG weighed 9oz with straps and guidelines but was so useful for shade and rain.  Went up in a flash, normally use over our hammocks.  Very crowded shelter campsites but great folks, met Walking Home who is on his way to Maine, God Speed!  Terrible storm that night but we stayed dry.  The next day we hiked to Congdon Shelter and then on to Harmon Hill.","Seth Warner Shelter

Pappy,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/618529,"We had a great section hike, lots of steep ups and downs but we had fun.  We stayed at the Catamount Motel (Great People say hi to Alan and his wife and Peter) before I had to go back to work at St. Michael's Playhouse.  We took several side trips to Robert Frost Trail, Lincoln Family home in Manchester Center, Mt. Mansfield, Nebraska Notch, and even Lake Placid.
This fall we are canoeing in the Boundary Waters of Minnesota, next summer maybe Shenandoah National Park AT?","Coming down the mountain
