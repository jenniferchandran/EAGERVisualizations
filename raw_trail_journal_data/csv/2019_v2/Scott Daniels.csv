Scott Daniels,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571820,"Welcome to my Trail Journal!  I appreciate that you’ve taken time to stop by and read my entries.

My intent for this journal is to document the what’s, why’s, how’s, etc. of my endeavor to complete, in 2018, a “flip flop” thru hike of the Appalachian Trail.  That’s approximately a 2200-mile walk done in around six months or less.

Let me take a moment to define a couple of terms for you.  A “flip flop” thru hike breaks down as this.  First, a thru hike is defined as completing a hike from one end of a trail to the other in one year.  The Appalachian Trail (the AT) starts at Springer Mountain, Georgia.  That’s between Atlanta and the Tennessee border.  The other end is atop Mt. Katadin, Maine.  All told, the hike is around 2200 miles.

A “flip flop” is something that’s being promoted more and more to take some of the pressure off the Springer Mountain start.  There are so many people starting during the February to April time frame that the trail is really showing the pressure from too many people.  The AT Conservancy (The organization in charge of the AT) is promoting people start somewhere in the middle of the trail.  They even have a “Flip Flop Festival” in April at their headquarters in Harpers Ferry, WV to see people off.  Flip floppers typically will start their journey north with the goal of getting to Mt. Katadin.  Then they will return to where they started and then head south, finishing at Springer Mountain.  This removes some of the pressure on the southern end of the trail since only 1 in 4 people usually complete the whole trip.  I am planning to start somewhere near the northern end of the Shenandoah National Park or Harpers Ferry.  It all depends on the date of the 2018 Flip Flop Festival.

In future pages, I will document my reasons for attempting this hike, training hikes I have done, the gear I use, definitions specific to thru hiking, some of the web sites I use and even some of the books about the AT I have read.

Please feel free to ask questions!  It may take a while to get you an answer, but I will try to answer it here.",,View Entry,"Jul 12, Wed",0
Scott Daniels,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/571951,"I am glad you came back! 
Every time I tell people that I am going to walk 2200 miles in six months, I get the same question.  WHY!!.......   Well, in order to answer that, I have to give you a little bit of history about me.

Starting back in the early ‘70’s, I was extremely involved in Boy Scouts in Michigan.  I camped out all but 2 or 3 months out of the year.  We not only camped, but also hiked.  I enjoyed it, especially during the cooler months.  During my senior year of high school, I heard about this crazy hiking trail called the Appalachian Trail along the mountains out east.  It sounded intriguing. I decided one day that I wanted to attempt doing it.

Well, between finding money for college, going to college, getting married, having kids.  You know, all of the normal things that go on with having a life, the “hike” got put on the back burner.  I did get to do a lot of stuff like playing beer league ice hockey, bicycle and cross-country ski racing, having a professional life, coaching my daughters and many trips to Disney World with my wife.  So not too bad of a life.  However, the itch was still there.

When the itch got its first real scratch was when my youngest daughter was coming to visit her mom and I before her wedding.  We took a quick trip to Harpers Ferry, WV.  In doing my research for what we could do, I discovered that the Appalachian Trail Conservancy was head quartered there.  After doing the tour of the National Park and the obligatory tourist shops, we went up the hill to the AT headquarters.  There, I got to talk to a few people along with obtaining a couple of books. 
It took a couple of months, but I finally admitted that I caught the bug.  However, before I could start hiking the trail, I had to overcome a few obstacles. First and foremost was getting off the insulin I was taking every day.  As a Type 2 diabetic, I was under fairly good control with pills and insulin.  However, I knew that I was not going to do the “hike” carrying insulin.

I found a good internist that helped me get things under much better control.  I changed my oral meds, upped my exercise, changed my diet again and slowly got off the injections!  What a day that was.  A big hurdle overcome.",,View Entry,"Jul 14, Fri",0
Scott Daniels,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572102,"Last Saturday (July 8), I did my first backpacking overnight.  My goal was to spend the first night actually hiking and backpacking.  I have spent many nights in the basement and backyard sleeping in my hammock.  I tweaked my hammock system during the past few months.  I actually sewed a second hammock after I found out my original one was a little too short.  
I have been hiking in the Shenandoah National Park with my backpack building up to Saturday’s hike.  Little did I realize that the extra weight I would carry was going to make such a big difference.  I did hike with about 15 pounds on my day hikes.  However, the extra 12 pounds combined with an almost totally uphill walk was something I was not prepared for!

My wife dropped me off at the Appalachian Trail where it crosses VA 522 near Front Royal, Virginia.  The plan was to hike southbound to the Tom Floyd Wayside (shelter) and spend the night.  It was “only” 3 miles and about 1000 feet of elevation gain according to the guidebooks.  Well, according to my iPhone, it was 4.4 miles and “59 sets of stairs!”  I do not know if it was the extra hike to the campsite, the multiple trips to the spring for water or a combination of the two.  I just know that I was tired!  It only took 2.5 hours to get to the shelter but since I was planning three, I was pleased.

I got camp set up and made dinner.  Ramen noodles with a tuna packet worked well.  I cooked the noodles with boiling water in a Ziploc bag.  I added the water and placed it in a cozy for 10 minutes.  The noodles were all cooked and the tuna was hot.

After cleaning up, I changed into my camp clothes and crawled into my hammock.  After about 20 minutes, I had to get up and remove the bug net.  It tends to keep things warmer inside of it.  I pulled it off and crawled back in.  Between the 64 ounces of water consumed before bed and the calf cramps, I was up four different times at night.

Sunday morning, I got up and made my oatmeal for breakfast.  Two bites and I knew it was not going to work!  I packed everything up and started down the hill.  About half way down, I was looking down at the trail watching for roots and rocks so I would not trip.  I looked up and saw a black bear crossing a downed tree maybe 100 feet from me.  I was so surprised that I did not get a photo!  I did yell at him.  He stopped and looked at me.  I yelled again and he did not move.  It took a loud whistle from me to get him moving away from me.  He stopped maybe 50 yards away and I whistled once more.  He bolted away and I never saw him again!

My wife met me at my drop off point just as I was arriving.  Boy was I glad to see her!  Overall, it was a successful trip.  I learned some things that I need to tweak including my fitness!  One was my cooking system needs to be better setup before I start cooking.  Two is my water filter works better if air in the “clean” water bottle is periodically allowed to purge.  The pressure builds up and does not allow the gravity system to work.  The third is that I HAVE to remain hydrated!  I need to drink more water while on the trail.

Here's the elevation profile from my hike. It's from ""Guthook's AT Hiker"" iPhone app.",,View Entry,"Jul 15, Sat",0
Scott Daniels,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572171,"During my research for this hike, I read a number of books by thru hikers.  I will compile/post a list soon.  One common thread throughout the books was on the condition of the trail itself.  The authors noted how rock covered the trail could be.  They also talked about the exposed roots waiting to trip the unwary.  Well, I have posted a couple of pictures showing a couple of examples of the different terrain I ran into on my first overnight.  
This first one is one in which you are walking through a small clearing in the woods.  It is not terribly long, but it is sunny.  You can clearly see small rocks in the path.  Please note that they are not imbedded in the soil.  If you step on one wrong, you can roll your ankle.  

It was nice to run into a sunny spot however, as most of the trail I walked was in the woods.  They call the AT, the “green tunnel” for a reason.

This next picture shows a section about 50 feet long of just loose rock.  You have to pick and choose your footing.  Just take it slow and watch your feet.



The reason for this posting is so I do not forget my first tumble on the trail.  Not three minutes after leaving the campsite Sunday morning, I took a fall.  I landed on my side with nothing hurt but my pride!  I do not know what tripped me.  It was rocky and there were roots exposed.  Maybe I was just getting cocky!  I suspect fatigue had a part in it.",,View Entry,"Jul 16, Sun",0
Scott Daniels,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572558,"As promised, here is the list of books written by thru hikers about their experiences while hiking the Appalachian Trail that I have read to date. They are in no particular order other than alphabetical. As I would run across one, I would read it.

Take A Thru-Hike: Dixie’s How-To Guide for Hiking the Appalachian Trail       by Jessica ""Dixie"" Mills

There were a few common threads throughout:


 The trail was not a concrete sidewalk. You needed to pay attention to where you put your feet.
 Zero days (no hiking days) were a necessity. Some needed more than others did.
 Pennsylvania was the worst for rocks.
 Hiker Hunger was a real phenomenon.
 Getting soaked from rain sucked, but you learn to live with it.
 HYOH (Hike Your Own Hike) - Do the hike your way, not someone else’s.
I enjoyed some more than others. I do not want to influence anyone, so I will not pick a favorite. I tried, and usually did, learn something from them all.
What I will say is that reading is NOT a replacement for actually getting out and backpacking. You cannot feel the work effort required to climb with a full backpack without doing it. You cannot actually taste the filtered spring water without actually filtering it yourself. The hot meal at the end of the day is so much better than reading about someone else’s! 
Get out and try it. You will not be sorry!",,View Entry,"Jul 19, Wed",0
Scott Daniels,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572784,"This entry was prompted by an article written by Alan Dixon from http://www.adventurealan.com.  It is titled “7 Reasons Why Hammock Camping is Fantastic – How To Get Started.” Here is the link: 
http://www.adventurealan.com/7-reasons-hammock-camping-fantastic-get-started/. 
As people around me know, I have caught the hammocking bug.  This article is a good explanation for why!  One thing the article does not address is that there is a huge DIY community for hammocks.  Not only hammocks, but also the associated supporting (pun not intended!) gear such as tarps, bug nets, quilts and suspensions.  
That DIY community, for cost reasons, was the driving factor in my foray into this part of backpacking.  I figure that I have about $200 into my sleep system.  That does not include the labor for the sewing of said parts!  I have to thank my wife for her sewing of my underquilt and first hammock.  She was able to teach me enough so I could sew a new, longer and lighter hammock.

Here is a listing of my current sleep system: All DIY items include eleven-foot long hammock, underquilt and bug net.  My top quilt is a self-modified Costco quilt.  Suspension is a collection of purchased items from various vendors.  My current tarp is a Kelty 12 foot purchased for $40 which will be replaced this winter with a lightweight silpoly tarp, maybe DIY. 
If you are intrigued by what hammocking might offer, here are a couple of links to internet forums that were useful to me.

Finally, I would be remiss if I did not mention Derek Hansen, author of The Ultimate Hang.  Both his website and book were extremely helpful in teaching me the basics.",,View Entry,"Jul 22, Sat",0
Scott Daniels,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/572908,"As a newcomer to the east coast (growing up in Michigan), I was concerned about the “tick problem” I often heard about.  I have done a fair amount of reading on the prevention and removal of ticks since moving here.  I am, by far, not an expert.  However, what I have discovered is that prevention is the key.  Repellent use is a must along with daily inspections.  If you have pets, they must also be checked.

The article “Visiting physician sheds new light on Lyme disease” by Barry Stringfellow of the MV Times was just posted on one of the hiking forums I follow.  Although it is a year old, nothing I have found has disagreed with it.  Here is the link: http://www.mvtimes.com/2016/07/13/visiting-physician-sheds-new-light-lyme-disease/.

Dr. Nevena Zubcevik, attending physician at Harvard Medical School and co-director of Dean Center for Tick Borne Illness at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Charlestown gave a presentation to a group of Martha’s Vineyard Hospital physicians on Lyme disease.  It is a worthwhile article to read for anyone who may be concerned about exposure to ticks.  
I will end with a quote from the article quoting Dr. Zubcevik that repeats much of what I have read from others:

“Dr. Zubcevik also said many people need to know proper tick removal — using tweezers to grab the head of the tick, not at the body.

Don’t don’t squeeze the belly of the tick, it will inject the bacteria into your bloodstream. Do not use oils; it can make the tick vomit the bacteria into the bloodstream. If the tick is deeply embedded, go to the doctor.”",,View Entry,"Jul 23, Sun",0

 Out of state family wedding in middle of August Move to a different town in September Another out of state wedding in October Kids in town for Thanksgiving Daughter in town for Christmas Two out of state funerals in early January Wife with daughter at Disney World while I dog sat late January
I did get an overnight in early November. I spent it at the Tom Floyd shelter near Shenandoah National Park. Having purchased a new (lighter!) pack made the hike much more enjoyable.When I got to the shelter, I thought I would have it to myself. Unfortunately, a Boy Scout troop showed up. I decided that some peace and quiet was more important than staying out of the rain under the shelter. I pitched my tarp and hammock between the intermittent rain showers. I did stay dry but was thankful when morning showed up!While lying in the hammock, I concluded that I am not ready for a “thru” just yet. I have decided to take this next year and spend more time developing my skills and fitness. Plans include attempting a section hike of the AT through the Shenandoah NP in one go. If that goes well, then I know I will be ready for the full thing.",,View Entry,"Jan 30, Tue",0
