Dale Ford,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608232,"We've actually been thinking about this for over a year now ... discussions, affirmations, really?, affirmations ... Then the gear purchasing began last fall.  Yeah, we are new to the lighter gear weights and long hike trekking, but we have always been an active family with camping, short family hikes, crosscountry skiing, snowshoeing in local Regional Parks, and the various school and club sport stuff.  Now it was time to make commitments with appropriate gear procurement and picking a start date!  March 26th we'll start from Springer Mt as set and ready to go as we will ever be!",,View Entry,"Mar 16, Sat",0

Dale Ford,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608453,"The pace around here at home is increasingly frantic as our AT travel day is coming closer and closer.  Completing some last minute house chores and discovering I need 4 more lightweight tent stakes to be able to stake down all available tent tie-downs...We will start our trail pace intentionally slow with 7 - 8 mile days.  And though this may be weather dependent, I'm not sure whether this means we'll put on more miles to get to the next shelter in inclement weather, or whether it means we'll be staying put to avoid getting totally wetted-out.  On our first day we'll start at the P off USFS42 and walk the 0.9 miles southward to Springer.  (I'll be seeing my first white blaze backwards!)  We'll signup and boldly go ... northward where we've just been!  Can't wait!  I'm ok with probably getting to Neel Gap/Mountain Crossings on the 4th day and to the GA/NC border after 10 days.  That would be a 7.81 miles a day for our walk through this Georgia section.  A nice way to initiate this journey, but, I'm sure the trail will have some input!",,View Entry,"Mar 19, Tue",0
Dale Ford,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/608613,"Friends and family are asking what will we be eating and about food prep.  I added a Food item to the Gear List - but am disappointed on the way it posted.  Below is another attempt to paste this info into this site.  This supply scheme is my adaptation from the great advice of darwinonthetrail.  Basically, there are trail towns along the AT every 3 - 4 - 5 days for the most part.  So every so many days there will be an opportunity to re-supply in town ... and burger-up! The idea on the trail is to carry dehydrated food, boil water, re-hydrate in the food package, and steep for the dinner meal.  Note: this method means no cleanup - but carry out the used food package.  Power bars and other misc will be food for breakfast and lunch.  There is lots of water along the trail, in springs and small creeks, that we will filter (meticulously) for drink and food prep. Below then is a our 4 day initial food supply divided into day by day ziplocks.  This 4 day supply weighs 7 lbs 4 oz - so estimating average is 2 lbs per day.  This supply also uses Knorr Rice Dinner Packs and Tuna Packs, with good calorie and protein count, which are a lot cheaper than typical commercial freeze dried dinners - though I will be using those as well to mix things up.  The cost totals are at the bottom of this info paste.  But this home bought supply averages to $394 a month for the trail food - so planning on $400 - $500 a month for food cost on the actual trail (not restaurant food in town).  Bon Appetite!  Adapted from darwinonthetrail



  4 Day Plan / Re-supply Scheme

  Separate into Day Ziplocks

  Tip: On the way out of town: Get Town food & carry with you for lunch or 1st nite  (burgers, subs)

Dale Ford,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609926,Springer Mt start!  Jake sand I shaved our beards and mustaches for a fresh start - tradition has no shaving on the trail. Heidi drive us up the narrow gravel USFS42 to the Springer Mt Parking lot where Jake and I said our goodbyes and actually started south on the trail for 0.9 miles to get to the start. A nice sunny day for hiking and a rocky up and down from Springer! There are rocks and roots and boulder fields on that trail ... Oh my! On the way down back to the parking lot we met a woman having problems with her pack and a broken trekking pole. Goodness! We made sure She had a cell connection and was talking to her husband about picking her up before we continued on. Got to Hawk Mountain Campsite in good time despite our late start but it was sprinkling. Also surprised not too ma y in camp. Went to filter water first and cooked our first dinner by the little stream as the rain had let up. But as soon as we started setting up tents a harder sprinkle started again. But we mana g ed to stay mostly dry inside working together to get tents covered quickly. A great first day!,"Springer Mt
",Hawk Mt Campsite,"Mar 26, Tue",7.40
Dale Ford,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609928,We started wet on the outside after the notes rain but today was mostly cloudy. The trail was in good shape despite the rain. We broke camp and we decided to each go our own pace this morning. Jake was out front. I got to a stream 0.6 miles down the trail and needed to filter water. I could not find my Sawyer Squeeze filtering system! Others were also taking a break at the stream so I told them I had to go back to the campsite to look for the Sawyer Squeeze. Jake was going to wait for me at some point along the trail so I told them to pass the word I would be more delayed if they so that guy wkith the green backpack. At the campsite I found the filter after checking several sites. On the way Back to the stream there was a spit with cell signal so I gave Jake a text also suggesting he go ahead to the next shelter to ensure tent sites.  He did not fully understand my text but by word of mouth on the trail the situation finally got better explained to him!  Lesson 1 (among many lessons 1 to be sure) double check the tent site before leaving!Sassafras Mt was a most difficult climb. It is about 700 ft climb in a mile but very rocky with big steps up and very direct with little switchback. Not a tall mountain but very difficult thus early on. Finally met up with Jake at Hooch Mt Shelter with a clear evening and a chance to exchange the forgotten filter stories.,"Hawk Mt Campsite
",Gooch Mt Shelter,"Mar 27, Wed",8.30
Dale Ford,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609929,A good day for a hike with good trail conditions. Jake and I decided to head for Woods Hole Shelter 11 plus miles. We took the shelter side trail not really realizing the shelter itself was 0.4 miles away. But once we got there we had it all to ourselves!! A beautiful spot and sunset. Also saw many lit campfires in the distant hillsides. We stayed inside the shelter first time.,"Gooch Mountain Shelter
",Woods Hole Shelter,"Mar 28, Thu",11.80
Dale Ford,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609930,Blood Mountain is the highest mountain on the AT in GA. (Maybe the 3rd highest in GA?)  Thank goodness it was a dry day!  Going up was difficult but managed with frequent breathtaking stops. On top is an old stone building now used as a shelter. Very neat views from this summit! Now the way down was treacherous!  Normally white blazes are painted on trees to mark the AT. A significant number of these rectangle blazes were painted on sloping rock outcroppings to mark the proper way down!  This was knee jarring!  A most difficult descent! At the bottom of the descent is Neel Gap and the outfitter Mountain Crossings. Jake and I bunked there in the hostel and Resupplied. The place is also famous for shoes slung into a big oak out front: some frustrated hikers!? I put my heavier boots in a box with a few other non-essentials and Jake added a thing or 2. We sent that 6 pound box home to Eagan! The nite was a cacophony of snores saws and coughs but inside and dry. Bought fresh brewewd coffee in the morning. A good stay.,"Woods Hole Shelter
",Neel Gap,"Mar 29, Fri",3.60
Dale Ford,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609190,After bunking at Mountain Crossings Jake and I got an earlier start with a 7am lights on! Showered last night gear together and brewed coffee. Off for a target 11 mile day. Beautiful day. Trail magic atTesnate Gap.  Chips fruit and vitamin I by Antenna Papa G Mama G. The 1/2 mile up and down the next mountain to the next gap and more trail magic!  White bean stew with pulled pork pieces and rice hot!  Also bowtie pasta salad. All served in the parking lot at the gap.  From then on a lot of not too difficult trail hiking to get here at Low Gap. Word does have it there be a storm tonight. We are set. All tented in !,"Neels Gap Mountain Crossings
",Low Gap Shelter,"Mar 30, Sat",11.50
Dale Ford,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609259,An awesome rainstorm last night. The wind was really strong coming up the gap. We did get wind at ground level but mostly you heard that almost unearthly sound as it whirled thru the trees wave after wave. The morning was cold and wet but the tents held up fine on the inside. An icy start on the finger tips as we packed things away. And a cold wind on the leewardard side of the mountain trail. We learned at Blue Mt Shelter others on the trail were going into Helen for the night. I desperately needed to sanitize my close so we are doing the same. This entry is from the laundry mat getting clothes done! Sure Stay Hotel tonite at hiker rate. Back on the trail tomorrow! Oh and a little trail magic at Unicoi Gap. Thanks Solo!,"Low Gap Shelter
",Unicoi Gap,"Mar 31, Sun",9.70
Dale Ford,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/609326,Yesterday the 31st was probably the most difficult so far. A very cold start and the wind was still howling when the trail strayed windward. We stayed in Helen last night; a great little German theme village. Sure Stay Hotel was great with the hiker rate. Hot shower laundry then a great dinner at Vendys!  Burgers fries nuggets!  Hitced out of town after about half hour with a ride from a retired 3Mer. Talked shop for the 10 mile ride to Unicoi Gap.  I believe his last name was Hill in sales with Specialty Materials Division. Today's hike was shorter but up and over the 2nd tallest GA mt on the trail. Tray Mt is 27 very shorter than Blood Mt. We got to Tray Mt Shelter on the down side and set up camp tenting a little earlier than normal for us. 3:45. A nice clear cool day. Expecting a 30 degree nite. There's a camp fire by the shelter. We're going to get dinner going now. Will probably be a frosty morning!,"Unicoi Gap

The burger and cold water was great!  Also meant we really did not have to plan for another lunch break. A great help and super much appreciated to both these groups. But now the .3 mile comb up Albert Mt came in earnest.  Not much switchback and rock climb footholds. There wet 2 times I used my hands to grab balance to the next level- and not the trekking poles! At the top (5250 ft) we were rewarded with a fire tower to climb and great views! See pics. The north side trail down Albert Mt was much easier and we soon crossed our 100th mile from Springer start!  Made it in to Rock Gap Shelter a little late but kit of sun left. All flat tent pads w ere full but a woman that had gotten in earlier offered to make space.  So we pulled up stakes and moved her tent a few feet then managed to get our 2 tents setup in the same flat space as well. A thing about Rock Gap Shelter: the path from the tenting area and the shelter to the privy crosses 2 spring flows that use rock stepping stones to get thru slightly wet muddy areas. Really?  This is very difficult to negotiate at night when footfalls to the privy are to be conserved, not lengthened !  Nuff said bout that! Had a surprise shower in the early morning nite.

A scout group also showed and pitched tents in a nearby camp area. I spoke with a leader of the troop, asking about weather.  He said the forecast was for rain bout 1 am carrying into the next day. Seems they ""always go hiking in the rain"". It did rain overnight into our Sunday June 9th. But there was a break around 6:30 so Jake and I broke camp had a quick breakfast and hit the trail.  This day we were not the last to leave!  And the trail was quickly foggy and drizzly. Our 1st destination was Elkwallow Wayside along the Skyline Highway thru the Shenandoah park. There with our rain gear on we stopped for a second breakfast: mine was 2 egg & bacon sandwiches and hot chocolate. Once we finished that breakfast we finally got our BlackBerry shakes!  We are all this outside under a roofed open shelter as other hikers showed up looking to do something similar. As we hit the trail again more rain with water now collecting on the trail forming formidable puddles and running streams. You play a game with the AT for awhile...even though your feet are already wet, you still try to avoid going directly thru the puddles or walk simply upstream thru the center of the collecting rain water. But the AT always wins ... And as the day progressed it rained harder. Just when I'd think it might let up the wind would blow and we'd get an additional dumping from the sopped trees! I finally started to get a little chill as we were getting thoroughly soaked. Our best defense was to keep warm by keeping moving to the next hut. I finally honestly mentioned to Jake that I would really like to find a simple way off the trail for the day!  But we had miles to go and only a hut or tent setup to look forward to. Fortunately within 5 miles of our target a couple of fellow hikers that were at the same shelter this morning caught up to us (Steady & Flipper).  They were targeting a hostel that was .5 miles off trail and not on our radar. So we decided to all 4 go there together. They set the pace and I certainly hustled to not be left behind!  We were all now trekking midstream and though Steady went dead center thru the path ponds I still did hang toward the edges. The rain continued ad we came to the final direction post in the North end of the Shenandoah. And ... We took a left turn instead of taking the path that went straight. We continued on the AT over a rock scramble for .4 miles before realizing our mistake.  The guide info said to go straight if going to the hostel. Anyway, we retraced our steps back up the rock scramble, and back to the sign post...in the rain. We finally did get to the hostel, but all bunks were taken!  Fortunately the owner had been a hiker himself so he made sure we could sleep on futons on the floor. We still did get hot showers, laundry, a personal size pizza and a pop with the stay price of $30 per person!  On this night a great deal! ...and on This rainy night we got to watch the Bruins beat the Blues in the 6th game of the Stanley Cup Series.

So we trekked back to the ATC headquarters and made calls to other hotels and hostels ... full, not open yet (until 1pm) and expensive (hotels).  I was looking for some unique AT t-shirts at the HQ but was disappointed - no purchase.  Harper's Ferry?  Anti-climatic!  So we walked back down to lower town, got a burger and some brewskies and made a reservation at this hostel 1.5 miles north of town.  I still needed new shoes so we stopped at the outfitter a couple of blocks away from the restaurant and I ended up buying a pair of Altra Timp 1.5.  So with this pair I am back down to a 10 1/2 size ... the last 500 miles I had a size 11 Altra Lone Peak 4.0.  The size 11 was just to long for me ... I seemed to be stubbing my toes a lot.  The first pair of shoes were also a size 10 1/2, Timp 1.0.  But the 1.0 has a different fit than my current 1.5.  We'll see.  I have wide feet so am very particular about getting the right fit.  This is my 3rd pair of shoes for this trek, the first two about 500 each.  (Typically 3,4,5, pairs are needed for this trip.) I wear a pair of Injinji ""toe socks"" as a thin liner with an over sock.  Now with these new shoes, I'll have to watch for blisters closely over the next few days.  So ... we are not spending any more time in the Harper's Ferry area, but continuing north tomorrow into Maryland.  We have camping choices at about 12 miles, 15, and 20.  Happy Trails!","Stony Brook Organic Farm and Hostel

But it is a lot to ask to solidly dam up a river/small stream. We could definitely not walk the dam. Too treacherous!  So we walked the shallows below the sieve, carefully, basically shin deep.

As we got to the base of the more vertical section everyone put away their trekking poles and used foot and hand holds on the rocks or mountain side to get to the next level. Between levels there was a short path or rock surface trail. So there were good spots to regain your equilibrium and good solid rocks to hold onto! But it did take some balance and nerve to get thru the climb. Fortunately it was mostly cloudy with moderate temps when we started at about 8:45. I was the last in the group of 5, with Jake patiently waiting and showing the way at strategic places. It took my about 1/2 gr8 to make the climb - But I was expecting much worse.

As I was filtering the water into my water bottles Jake said, ""Dad, look up.""  There nearly straight above me was an old snake skin dangling from the roof rain water gutter. We quickly finished our water business and got outta there! We carried the full bottles and bags up the additional 300+ feet to this shelter area. Had water for dinner and got water for breakfast tomorrow. And ... there's supposed to be a great deli just 6 miles down the trail ... perfect for a lunch break!","High Point Shelter

Dale Ford,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620298,"Jake and I are stealth camping tonite a couple of miles past the top of Stratton Mt and Shelter. We are about 1642 trail miles from Springer Mt GA. We have less than 550 trail miles to go to get to the top of My Katahdin. Today's hike was all about getting up and over Stratton Mountain. We went from 2230 ft to 3935 ft in 3.8 miles. Fortunately the climb was not technically difficult, just long. Also today was a beautiful day for hiking. Once at the top we climbed the observation tower and had beautiful vistas of Vermont! The descent was relatively easy. We hiked past the Shelter and tenting platforms a couple of miles and found a cleared tenting spot not far from a water source. So after the almost 16 mile day we settled in and set up our stealth camp for the night.  Tomorrow we'll hike the 9 miles to the VT 11 & 30 trail head and hitch 5.5 miles into Manchester Center VT for a resupply. Chilly tonight. Should be great sleeping!£","Kid Gore Shelter VT

Dale Ford,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/620613,"Today Jake and I are taking a zero at the Yellow Deli Hostel in Rutland VT.  We have hiked over 1700 trail miles from Springer and have less than 500 miles to Katahdin! We expected severe weather in the area so are laying low. Yesterday we hiked over Mt Killington which was a significant 3.8 mile climb (But not like the upcoming Whites). All was good till about 2/3rds the way up.  The ttrail went across a series of small up a and downs that were filled with tree roots and embedded small boulders. That section took the wind out of my sails!!! Did make it over the top though and eventually we completed a 16.7 mile day.  The day started as we left our campsite by us turning the wrong way on the trail. Instead of north we bolted south! Discovered our error after about 1/2 mile. Ouch! But to brighten the day we actually luckily hit 2 bits of trail magic before the big climb.  The 1st was a couple of coolers set near a road crossing with water pop chips. The 2nd Mike and Mary had 2 card tables setup with pasta, fruit, and were preparing hot dogs on a burner stove!  That stop was a much gratifying lunch!  The saber is to eat to much for the hike ahead! On the trail down the mt I really started to feel the tops of boulders and stones as I made those hard downward footfalls. Disconcerting! So this aft I walked to an orthopedic shoe store and bought my first ever insoles! The test will be the trek between here and Hanover! (Thunder coming on!) I am now apparently nearing the end of my 4th pair of shoes. Might buy my 5th pair in Hanover that will take me to the top!","Yellow Deli Hostel

Today we completed the last segment of The White Mountains! The first of the Whites was Mt Moosilauke at 4802 ft elevation on 8/14. We climbed My Washington (6288ft) on 8/19. It was cloudy and windy that day but broke clear as we approached the top. Had lunch at the restaurant with clear views! Today we exited the Whites; 8/22. This last week has been the most strenuous part of our AT hike.  But the views have been tremendous above tree line especially! I am super glad to have completed this segment, but we do have 300 more miles to go. We have completed 1892.6 trail miles since Springer Mt on our 149th day. Tomorrow we'll take a zero and resupply.

A great coincidence that they are both in this area this summer - and what a break to see a show!  Jake and I are all resupplied for 4 days out:  our next resupply stop is planned to be Andover, Maine.  Because of the mountainous up and downs, we are trying to scale our trek to 10 - 12 miles a day, then we have to ""match that"" to where the designated shelters and campsites are at or potential stealth sites. Weather is always an unknown and can be chilly this time of year up here.  In this segment we will be going through a 1 mile long boulder field. It is also called out as one of the most difficult sections on the AT, climbing over, under, and around boulders/rocks to get through. And sometimes passing the backpacks through separately.  It could take 3 hours to get through that mile alone. We are staging our pre- and after- campsites as close as we can to this section to dedicate a day to safe passage.  But tonight we have a play to get to ... so as this Tamworth Public Library is about to close at 5pm ... I'm off to get myself an ice cream treat!  Less than 300 miles to Katahdin!Happy Trails!","Tamworth NH

Dale Ford,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621669,"The photo shows Madison Spring Hut nestled in the White Mountains. To the right out of view is Mt Adams. Behind the hut is Mt Madison. The AT bypassed the summit of Mt Adams, but as you can clearly see, it goes directly over the summit of Mt Madison! (No I couldn't see it either very well...kinda a rock scramble...). The AMC runs a series of huts in the Whites: day hikers will pay more than $100 for a bunk space for a night, which includes dinner and breakfast. Us thru hikers can also reserve a place at that cost or there is a ""work for stay"" program. At Mizpah Spring Hut Jake and I showed up at the right time ( 4 pm) and got to work in the eve for an hour or so - clean leftover dishes, pans, stove. And we got a full dinner and were able to sleep inside on the floor of the common room.  (Setup our sleeping pads of course.) We had to be up by 5:30 so the staff could prepare the area for breakfast. We could have stayed for a free breakfast but we eat our own stuff and got an early start that day to cross over Mt Washington.  We tried the same thing at the Madison Spring Hut arriving just before 4 pm. They did not have an evening shift but after stalling and talking til that magic 4 pm, they offered a morning shift; cleaning up chores after breakfast. But that would have given us a start too late.   A 3rd person joined our talk wanting the morning deal as we declined it. The hut person we were talking to stepped away to talk with her manager...came back and offered Jake and I a free stay-totally free all food and bunks included! Apparently someone had cancelled 2 spaces, already paid, and donated their spots to the next 2 people to show up. Us! So we ate well, slept well, had breakfast ... Then trekked over Mt Madison! 
This eve we are back in Gorham at the Barn Hostel after a great evening in Tamworth.  We saw a very good and funny show directed by Jake's friend Buddy! But now with 2 zeros in a row it's time to hit the trail again.  On to the trail head at 7:10 tomorrow morning and our next resupply in Andover Maine in 4-5 days!","Tamworth NH

Dale Ford,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/621822,"We are in Maine! We actually crossed the border a couple of days ago. Yesterday was one of my most difficult days on the trail! Smack in the middle of the day was the infamous 1.1 mile long notch. This segment was a small canyon like / valley bottom / gulley filled with boulders! That was the path! We w ent over under around again and again as we, inched toward, it seemed. It took me about 3 hours to get thru with much help and guidance from Jake! I had to remove my pack 3 times to get thru tight spots. We went under and thru different rock formations twice. The trail to get there and the trail after that section were not easy either. We are still in the mountains in southern Maine! After t he notch was another mountain climb getting just above tree line.  On the way down near the top was a mudhole with a typical plank crossing. For some reason my balance went to the right. I stuck out my trekking pole to catch and make a correction. No bottom! The pole went in, as did my arm up to my elbow and my right leg up to my thigh. My left leg was still on the plank and I was holding on to the plank with my left hand . I yelled for Jake ( though not in so many words) who was just ahead. He came back and pulled me back onto the plank - me half muddy! So the next couple miles to the shelter I was a frustrated mess! Fortunately the shelter was next to a pond so I was able to wash off the sticky mud shoes, legs, arms and all.  Dried off with camp towels and put on dry clothes.  There was just enough time to make and finish dinner. Slept in the shelter fortunately dry and warm.  Today was a beautiful day with a better hiking trail. We are stealth camping near a stream about .5 miles from a road. If weather holds, we'll hike a rugged 10 miles tomorrow then hitch into Andover to resupply and wash some muddy clothes! Warm in tent tonight!","Pond Shelter

Dale Ford,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/622718,"On Sept 7th Jake and I camped together at Pierce Pond Lean-to.  That morning we got up early and broke camp just before 7, like about 8 other hikers, and made for Harrison's Pierce Pond Camp for a hearty breakfast of eggs, sausage, pancakes, juice, coffee!  A wonderful early morning start in a rustic Maine Sport Lodge.  From there we hiked about 4 miles into Caratunk, ME for a short term resupply for our real target of Monson another 2-3 days away.  Monson is on the doorstep of the much anticipated ""100 Mile Wilderness"" which is the last segment, taking you into Baxter State Park and Katahdin.  At the Caratunk hostel we bought a few supplies and I had a coffee flavored milkshake (delicious!) and sloppy joe for second breakfast.  As we left, there was a slight drizzle so we were in rain gear for a couple of miles, but that dropped off and off came the rain gear.  The terrain leading to the next Lean-to was not too bad, but as we crossed on dirat forest road the sky seemed threatening rain to me.  Trail talk said it was remnants of Doria and no-one knew whether it would rain or not.  At the Pierce Pond Lean-to, about 1:30 in the afternoon Jake and I decided to split and meet in Monson.  I was already getting tired and with the weather threatening (or not) I did not want to get caught in a rain event like we had just encountered days before.  Jake said he ""still had a mountain in him"" so after much consternation we did split up.  So I had a boring afternoon at the shelter, then as mealtime approached I remembered that I was going to share Jake's fuel canister to boil my water until we got to Monson, purposely putting off buying a higher priced canister in Caratunk!  Finally around 4:30 others showed up to stay in the shelter that night and I was able to borrow a canister from Letters to cook that nights meal.  We had a camp fire and place 6 of us shoulder to shoulder in a 6 person shelter.  It did rain that night but only short time and nothing serious.  The next day (8th) I crossed the 2 next mountains and after about a 13 mile trek, stayed at Pleasant pond Lean-to.  And luckily, 2 others showed up at that lean-to so I was able to get another fuel dosage donation from Lost and Found to cook that night's meal.  And a great campsite on the shore of a lake.  Jake was ahead somewhere also heading to Monson.  Quite different hiking by yourself for the day!  Although good hiking alone, thoroughly enjoy hiking with Jake instead!Happy Trails","Pierce Pond Lean-to

We are staying at Shaw's Hiker Hostel, taking a zero to resupply and ready for this next part of the trek.  We have 114.5 miles to the peak of Katahdin (5260 ft).  At Shaw's tomorrow we'll start with a full breakfast of bacon eggs pancakes coffee juice, then get a shuttle to the trailhead.  It is supposed to rain tonight and scattered showers tomorrow ... so we'll see!  We plan to do the Wilderness in 6 days.  That will take us to the entrance to the park (Abol Bridge) where we can get a short term resupply.  From the bridge we hike another 9 miles to the Katahdin Stream Campground and Ranger Station - where we camp on that 7th night hopefully at the free Birches Campsite.  So then, 8 days from this writing, on Sept 18th is the date we plan to summit Katahdin.  The first half of the 100 Mile Wilderness will be the toughest, with still some ""mountain""  climbing / rough terrain.  There are lots of ups and downs at about the 2500 ft level and one section has a series of peaks leading to a 3600 ft White Cap Mountain.  The second half of the Wilderness goes down to below 1000 ft and runs ""pretty smooth"" profile-wise between 800 and 1500 ft.  However, I am always cautious with the AT:  in Maine - boulders and roots and mudholes - oh my!Today is a zero for trek prep.  Yesterday Jake and I were hiking separate and arrived in Monson at different times.  I got to the trailhead at 10 before four on Monday the 9th; Jake at about 11 in the morning. I spent 10 minutes trying to hitch into town before getting a ride. I started yesterday at Moxie Bals Mountain Lean-to (Shelter):  had a nice tent site with soft pine flooring by a lake shore with the sound of loons putting me to sleep (at hiker midnight).  Yesterday's hike was 17.9 miles over a relatively ""flat"" profile ... but once section made me crazy as the trail tried to follow a river shore line, going up and down the shore banks/valley seeming just to keep in view of the many rapids in the river.  Neat rapids, but arghh the elevation changes!  Also actually had to wet ford 2 streams for the first time yesterday.  Much rumor on the trail as to how deep the fords were, but I crossed where the ripples were so the water was only really ankle deep.  I hear there are a couple of more wet fords in the 100 Mile Wilderness ... take them as they come ... wet step by wet step!I believe I will not be able to provide any updates until after the 18th.  But sometime before the end of this month I will wrap this up with more day entries and photos.Happy Trails!  Arduous","Monson Maine
