Wanda 3 Sox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610458,"Drove down to Lexington, VA from Indiana yesterday and spent the night at the Day's Inn.  This morning I drove to Stanimal's Hostel in Glasgow to get a shuttle ride.  Lee was the driver  and I followed him to Thunder Ridge Overlook to park my car and then he took me to the Jenning's Creek trailhead.  We had one glitch...the Blue Ridge Parkway was closed for work on trees after the parking area so Lee had to turn around and backtrack all the way to Glasgow and go around an alternate route to get there.  He had an appointment that day and the reroute made him late even though we left an hour early.  But he did make it.  
Bringing my car is already proving to be a challenge.  But I'll continue on and see how it goes.
I started hiking around 11:45 and guess what...it was a big climb up from the river.
With this being my first day back on the trail this year it was a tough day but flowers and trees are budding and it was a pretty hike.  Made it to the campsite a little after 6:00 and set up my tent.  I only saw 3 hikers today...one SOBO slackpacker and 2 NOBO section hikers that I flip-flopped with all day until the last 3 miles when I was too tired to keep up.
I was concerned that I would get rained on overnight because the forecast was for the rain to start at either 5pm, 11pm or 5am.  I am hoping it holds out until I get packed up in the morning.","Jennings Creek

However it started raining at 5am so I packed yo as much inside the tent before 7:30 and then took down the tent between rain spurts until the last one got me but I was almost done so sprinkles in most of my stuff and the tent got really wet.
It rained all day, much steadier when I started hiking.  Add in a few ice pellets and it was a miserable 6 hour hike back to the car.  Got in the car and turned on the heat full blast.  That made me glad I had my car!","Campsite

Wanda 3 Sox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610559,"I'm moving to Stanimal's Hostel in Glasgow.  The rain was constant most of the day.  Around 5:00 there were tornado warnings that lasted for most of the evening with heavy rain and wind.  The hostel has a side porch and the wind was knocking over chairs and blowing things off the clothesline even though they were attached with clothespins.  Finally things calmed down after dark.
There was a girl from the Netherlands at the hostel who had to be taken to the hospital in the after because she had been sick all last night.  Luckily they found out she just had a virus and were able to give her fluids and medicine so she was feeling much better after getting back.  It wasn't Nurovirus and wasn't contagious, still horrible to be sick on the trail.  All of us at the hostel were section hikers (Regina, Marilyn and John-Ironheart).  I went to Scotto's for dinner and had a delicious hamburger and fries.  It was really, really good!","Lexington, VA

Wanda 3 Sox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/610561,"I'm slackpacking today.  The wind is very strong with gusts of 35-40 mph, making it a little cool.  The good thing is that the sun is out and lots of beautiful blue sky.  Ironheart and I are hiking the same direction (SOBO) so we flip-flopped all day. Okay
The views of the surrounding mountains are spectacular all day long.  Of course, with all the rain, the streams and river are swollen and running fast.  At one of the stream crossings I took off my boots and waded across because it was moving fast and I didn't trust my ability to rock hop.  It was only just below my knees and I made it across safely.
Just after putting on my boots and resuming my hike I stopped to get a drink from my water bottle and happened to look down and there was a black snake.  It raised it's head and just looked at me but by the time I got my camera ready, it had slithered away.
It was a good day and by doing this section out of sequence, I'll be in a better position to get out of the rain on Friday.  Got to my car at the James River Parking Lot and drove back to Stanimal's for the night.When I got back to the hostel I found Justus there.  We met last year in NH and at the top of Mt.

Wanda 3 Sox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611247,"This morning I moved my car to the Tye River Parking Area. I was
following Lee (shuttle driver in his car) on the Blue Ridge Parkway
and he had gone around a curve and I heard an awful dragging noise
coming from under my car. I stopped and checked to see if my muffler
or tailpipe had dropped but everything seemed to be in place, so I
figured whatever I had run over had dropped off and I was good to go. Unfortunately, I drove a few feet and still heard that awful noise,
so I stopped again. This time I saw the problem….a two-foot stick
had wedged in the undercarriage and I couldn’t get it out. Decided
to back up for a few feet and see if it would dislodge and it did. By this time I had no idea where Lee was, but he had stopped in a
mile or so and was waiting for me. We got to the parking area and
then Lee drove me back to Punchbowl Overlook and I started hiking
north at about 11:00.

It was a beautiful day with no big ascents and nice hiking trail. I
was making good time until about 4:00 when I came upon a rushing
stream and needed to find a place to cross. My boots are waterproof
but have vents on the top and side so it takes them a long time to
dry if they get wet. I walked up and down the stream with no luck
finding a place. But I did take a fall trying to walk up the stream
bank which was muddy. I hit my elbow and got a couple of scratches,
but I was fine.

Finally decided to put on my camp shoes and wade across. I was a
little nervous because I hadn’t seen any other hikers all day and
it felt like I was out there by myself. I made it safely across and
as I was putting on my boots, I noticed a big goose egg on my arm
beside my elbow. It didn’t hurt as long as I didn’t touch it and
my elbow and arm still worked fine. Just as I got ready to hike
again a hiker came across the stream by rock hopping. Guess he
didn’t care if his boots got wet.

Started hiking again and was passed by another hiker (Good Samaritan)
who stopped to talk for a minute. Soon we came upon another stream,
wider than the first one and I started looking for a place to cross
as Good Samaritan walked upstream to look. I saw him walking across
the stream on a log several feet above the water. I walked up to see
how easy that crossing would be and decided there was no way I could
do it. Good Samaritan encouraged me to come across and talked me
through it (I sat sideways on one log and put my feet on the other
one and scooted sideways across). Then at the end of the log, Good
Samaritan grabbed my hand and talked me through the rest of the way. I never could have made that crossing without his help. Thank you!

We had a slight trail detour due to a bridge being out, but it was
less than two miles to the shelter. I camped by the stream with
Regina and Marilyn. Got a good night’s sleep.","Punchbowl Overlook
",Brown Mtn. Creek Shelter,"Apr 16, Tue",9.10
Wanda 3 Sox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/611250,"Today was a difficult day. It was a 2700 ft. ascent that took most
of the day. It was a warm day and there were few trees and they
hadn’t leafed out yet so there was no shade. Luckily I carried
extra water because there were no streams until Hog Camp Gap. I did
use sunscreen but still got burnt.

Seemed like I would never get to the top but when I did there was a
small descent and then the trail went right back up. I was so glad
to get to Hog Camp which was a huge open meadow with plenty of room
to camp. The spring was .3 mile from the trail, but at least it was
running well. Met a couple doing a flip-flop thru hike, who had
started at the NJ/PA line. I camped with two women from Georgia who
I had flip-flopped with all day.

On the way back from getting water at the spring, I decided to go
home for a few days. If I kept hiking tomorrow, there was no way to
get a ride to my car and I’d have to hike all day in the rain on
Friday to get there. So I started asking people in the parking lot
if they could give me a ride, but had no luck. Was able to text Gary
(shuttle driver) and he agreed to pick me up in the morning. I felt
much better after getting that arranged. It is less expensive for me
to drive home than to stay in a hostel or hotel for 2-3 nights. It
will be nice to be home for Easter.","Brown Mtn. Creek Shelter

Wanda 3 Sox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613093,"Drove back from Indiana yesterday and stayed at the Super 8 in
Waynesboro last night. Oma (owner of the former 3 Springs Hostel)
picked me up at Reed’s Gap where I was leaving my car and took me
to Hog Camp Gap at 9:00am. When we arrived, there were controlled
burn notices that said the trail at Hog Camp Gap, over Tar Jacket
Ridge, to Salt Lick Gap was closed today and tomorrow. Since we
didn’t see any activity or smell any smoke I went ahead and hiked
that section. I sure was in a hurry because I didn’t want to get
caught in a burn area. When I got to Salt Lick Gap there was not
activity there either, so I suspect they had postponed it due to high
wind. 

It was a cool morning and I wore my rain jacket most of the morning. It was a smooth hike and I was impressed that there were 2 mountains
that the trail didn’t go up to the top, as the AT usually does, but
went about halfway up and then wound around the mountain instead of
going over. However, there was a killer climb at the end of the day
up to Spy Rock. I camped there in a flat, grassy area. I didn’t
go out to Spy Rock because I had read that it was dangerous,
especially if you were alone. I’ve climbed enough rocks on my
journey and didn’t have the desire to climb this one. A day hiker
came back and said it was muddy and slick and she slid in a couple of
places, so I was glad I didn’t go.

I had hoped someone else would camp in this area but everyone else
went another 4 miles to The Priest Shelter. So, I fixed dinner and
then got in my tent around 7pm because I was getting very cold. Put
on my wool base layer and got under my liner and quilt and soon was
warm. I answered a call of nature and was completely enveloped in
fog. Kinda spooky. The wind picked up and my tent was blowing. In
a couple of hours the temperature seemed to rise and I had to
reposition my quilt so it wasn’t too warm. The wind really started
blowing hard and swirling and I realized that if I had been at home
in Indiana, I would have been heading for a basement expecting a
tornado. I had no where to go so I just stayed in my tent and
listened to the wind all night long. I got only about 2 hours of
sleep, if that much. At least it didn’t rain.","Hog Camp Gap Campsites

Wanda 3 Sox,https://www.trailjournals.com//journal/entry/613094,"Wind had calmed down by the time it got light this morning. Ate
breakfast and packed up and was hiking by 7:30. The next 4 miles to
The Priest Shelter was no picnic. Those that continued on last night
had a tough hike to get there. When I arrived there were 4 hikers
who confirmed my thoughts that those 4 miles were tough and they had
to do part of it in the dark. I ate an early lunch and started the
huge 3,000 ft. descent down Priest Mountain.

The sun had come out and it was in the low 80’s that afternoon. The trail down wasn’t too difficult but it was very long and I was
hot, tired and exhausted when I got to the Tye River. There was a
pickup truck sitting in the parking lot when I arrived and I found
out that the driver was Rusty, the owner of Hiker Hostel (I’m not
sure that’s the name), who was advertising for his hostel that he
is re-opening. It was open in the 80’s and he enjoys helping
hikers and wants to get it running again. He lives right on the Blue
Ridge Parkway. Anyhow, I was so hot and tired that I asked him for a
ride to my car. He agreed and we took off up a mountain road which
was under construction. It was an eventful ride in his ‘65 Chevy
truck. It overheated and stalled, but I made it to my car. Rusty is
a very kind and generous friend of hikers and I wish him well with
his hostel.

When I got to my car I realized I didn’t have a plan for what to
due next, so I went back to the Super 8 in Waynesboro to regroup.","Spy Rock

bridge over Tye River and it was bouncy and fun. The ascent from the
river to 3 Ridges Mountain (3,000 ft.) was not. It lasted most of
the day. Everything was fine for the first hour or so to Harper’s
Creek Shelter, then I walked for what seemed like a long way and
didn’t see a white blaze. I got worried and pulled up Guthook on
my phone and it said I was .9 off trail. I didn’t want to turn
around and go back because it was rocky and I couldn’t imagine I
had lost the trail. So I moved forward hoping to find it again. A
few minutes later I saw a blaze and was so relieved. I stood by the
blaze and Guthook said I was 1.1 mile off trail, so I shut it down
and realized it must not have been able to recalibrate and so
it gave
me an incorrect
location. I hiked on and an hour later I
hadn’t seen another blaze and there
were 2 hikers coming toward me and I asked them if they were on the

were already gone with the exception of one that was from 2016. Also
saw the W J Mayo Homeplace ruins. All that was left was the rock

I started hiking at 9am.  The elevation today is from 3500 ft at Thunder Ridge to 848 ft. at the shelter.  As usual, the AT couldn't go a day without throwing in a couple of climbs and some PUDS (pointless ups and downs).  It was a gorgeous day and the leaves have come out so there's shade on the trail most of the time.  The rhodadrendron are blooming and they are just beautiful.  It was a good hike most of the day until the huge descent at the end of the day (1800 ft).   My knees were just killing me when I got to the shelter at 5:30 (8.5 hours minus an hour for lunch isn't too bad for me).

There were a lot of hikers on the trail going both directions today.  Several hikers I had met last night at the hostel (Scratcher, No Name and a couple others).  It was fun running into them going SOBO.  Only a Dad and his 2 20-something daughters were at the shelter when I arrived.  Neat seeing them enjoying time together.  3 others came in a few minutes later.  I'm camped right by Matt's Creek, so I sat on a rock by the creek and ate dinner.  Nice, peaceful time.

It was a good hike today -- short day with only one 1,000 ft. climb (out of Port Clinton).  I got to the shelter at 3pm and ate lunch.  There had been a short rain shower, but I still had the energy to hike.  I checked the options further up the trail and didn't find a campsite available so I stayed put at the shelter.  It was good trail today, not many rocks or mud and smooth trail most of the way for a change.  Lots of hikers here tonight.  There was a rain shower at 5pm and 8pm.  The privy is closed and there is a red port-a-potty instead...even had TP!  It's the small things that make hikers happy.

The trail this afternoon smoothed out, but my feet already hurt.  As I came down to Hawk Mtn.

the sign for it, I was at the bottom of a ravine and didn't get a good vibe and decided to hike on.
Immediately the trail went back up the steep side of a mountain. I was carrying extra water
because I had prepared not to go to the shelter. I was worried about where I was going to camp
because the next shelter was 6.6 miles further. After I made it up the steep climb I ran into the
ridge runner for this section. I immediately asked hum if there were any campsites ahead, then
realized he was a ridge runner. He informed me that I wasn't supposed to camp except in
shelter or designated campsites. I was so hot and tired that I argued that I felt there was
nothing tong with camping at existing campsites whether they were ""designated"" or not. He
went on to say I needed to hike to the next shelter. After arguing a little more I walked away.
I didn't find a place to camp for another 3.5 miles, so I camped in an area close to a road
intersection. I figured if anyone complained, I'd just ask the police to take me to jail so I could

We had been rationing water because we didn't know how far we had hiked and when we would find water.  We drank a bunch and carried a lot with us to the .campsite.The campsite was only .1 mile north of the stream.  We're camped with a SOBO section hiker from Buffalo and a thru hiker from Denver.","Long Pond Stream Lean-To

It started raining and we had to put on rain jackets and pack covers.   We then climbed up Little Boardman Mountain and enjoyed the view.  We also  had a signal so made some calls.  We stopped for lunch at Crawford Pond, but the mosquitos were so bad we didn't enjoy our stop.  Later in the afternoon we ran into a hiker (Nature Boy) I had met at Partnership Shelter in 2017 and then again last year just beflore we got off trail to go to Andover.  He's trying to do a thru hike this year.We got to the shelter at 4:00 and had to dry out our tent.  The guide says there are falls and a swimming hole which is correct, but a couple of people told us there were leeches in the water so even a possibility of that kept us out of the water.  There is a spring here also so we got cold water for the second time today.  We're really tired and need a good night's sleep so we can hike 11.3 miles tomorrow.","East Branch Lean-To
